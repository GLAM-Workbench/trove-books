1ts PIONEERS
THE OLD WOOLPACKINN
270 Valuable Pages


INTRODUCTION.
In the following pages is concentrated a wealth of historical informa-
tion concerning Bacchus Marsh district and its pioneers.' The first 231
pages represent the valuable research work of the late Mr. William
Williams, 8.A., first published in “The Express” in regular instalments
during the years 1913-17. There follows an authentic record of early
Bacchus Marsh, written by the late Mr. Charles Hegarty, who contributed
same to “The Express” in 192 9, using the nom-de-plume, “Pyrette.” To
make this book more complete we have added the important story
(traced only quite recently) of the Bacchus family, and some early history
of Mount Blackwood. Although not claimed to be a comprehensive
historical survey we believe that this publication definitely supplies a
long-felt deficiency, and is certain to become more and more valuable
with the passage of time.

HISTORY OF BACCHUS MARSH
I purpose giving a lengthened his-
torical sketch of Bacchus Marsh. To
carry out the project I have inter-
viewed many - old residents of the
district, and. consulted many records
—for the community is not without
its ancient literature.
I regret that 1 cannot have the
active assistance nor counsel of
Mr. Christopher Crisp, who has
had his fingers on the pulse of local
life for the past 40 years or so. Had
he taken this matter in hand,; he
would have performed the task in
a masterly way, which it would have
been, futile for anyone to try to
emulate. Mr. Crisp has the pen of
a ready writer; he has acquired a
mass of local information, and this,
coupled with his versatility, would
have made a recapitulation of the
growth of the* locality interesting,
indeed, most valuable.
The railway traveller is always
ready for a view of that patch of
perennial green, known as Bacchus
Marsh. As the train having almost
circumvented the Horseshoe Bend,
scales the plateau, the Marsh stret-
ches before him as a panorama, and
constitutes a thing of beauty. It is
virtually a basin of verdure, the
greenness of which, like an oasis in
the desert, only intensifies as Old
Sol sheds the greater heat, and the
scene is enhanced by a view of pla-
teau and hill, upon which play the
ever varying tints of light and
shade. In the State there is only
one Bacchus Marsh.
Mounts Bullengarook and Black-
wood are distinctly seen in the dis-
tance, rising from foothills covered
with amplitude of foliage. Indeed,
Coornmill, which is at present a
closed forest, we hope some day will
be of commercial advantage to the
Marsh. It is a delightful trip via
the Pentland Hills and Myrniong to
Mount Blackwood, for the undulat-
ing country has a never-ending
charm, and when the Mount is nego-
tiated the view obtained is simply,
superb, for the eye takes in a range
of vision reaching from Ballarat to
the sea. If Nature is spectacular,
then Bacchus Marsh has a fair
share. It is fayored of the gods.
There is a decided geological taint
to local knowledge. Said a young-
ster to the scribe as soon as foot
was set in the locality: “Please, sir,
can you tell how the Marsh was
formed?” He had his own theory,
which, youthlike, he exploded before
you could give a reply.
Professor Gregory and other geo-
logists aver that Nature did big
things in and around 'Bacchus Marsh
in prehistoric times. To be in the
third greatest lava plateau in the
world is indeed something to boast
of, and the community is proud of
such legacy. “It took about
1,200,000 years for the Werribee to
wear its way down to its present
bed;” and verily, why should we,
the inhabitants of Bacchus Marsh,
not be as assertive of this record as
the sport is of. some cricketing, rac-
ing, or football performance?
There are distinct glacial traces,
arid the Werribee gorge is a fair
cornucopia of geological wisdom, not
to speak of it, in some respects, as
a geological -piece de resistance. The
well-known amateur naturalists, the
Brittlebank brothers, found in the
Gorge a volume holding secrets that
only became revealed by assiduous
observation, and they spent labori-
ous days deciphering its hierogly-
phics.
We have had much freedom of
conjecture as to originating cause,
but what was the fact? Was the
Marsh a lake in which saurians
sported their three or four hundred
feet of elegant anatomy? Or did it
form a pleasure-ground for the in


habitants of the stone period, where
they occasionally battered one an-
other with stone clubs? When did
the great glacial slide occur, filling
valleys, forming plains, perhaps
stopping abruptly and thus causing
the basin ?
Did the Werribee wear out the
Gorge? Anyhow, Bacchus Marsh
has a soil of such richness in potash,
&c., as bears every evidence that it
was washed away from the neigh-
boring hills, and the Werribee on
pure circumstantial proof is charged
as being the delinquent. The Marsh
has a surface soil of some 2 0 feet
over an immense bed of drift. On
this side of Bald Hill, three miles
from the town, there is a natural
curiosity. The hill is bereft of trees
save one small belt, and this is
formed of Murray pines. The con-
undrum is, How did they get there,
and why do they specially grow
there?
The soil on the flat is intensely
rich, producing luxuriant crops of
lucerne, which form such an excel-
lent fodder. The farmer who has a
good lucerne patch has sleek cattle
with bursting udders. There is
some humanity in extracting the
milky liquid from a cow who suffers
from comfortable obesity, rather
than from one on whose ribs you
could nail battens. Mr. Elwood
Mead evidently has his heart set on
lucerne, and it is his opinion that
in irrigated areas it should be the
staple product. I believe no land has
changed hands on the flat for years.
This speaks for itself: You generally
hold on to a good thing. The late
Mr. McGratJi was the last purchaser,
and he gave some £l3O per acre.
To see Mr. Jas. Kerr’s neat lucerne
patches under the wooded height, on
the Lerderderg, is refreshing. The
£l3O per acre given by Mr. McGrath
was the absolute value of this land
for productive purposes, without
any increment which might spring
from advantageous residential area.
That is, if these blocks were situ-
ated in Collins street you could
quite understand the lift up in price
by juxtaposition to congested hu-
manity. But Bacchus Marsh is only
a moderate hamlet.
On the hills west of the town —
Pentland Hills—and Myrniong, the
land ranges from £lO to £3O per
acre, and there is a large scope of
it. The question is—Why is there
such comparative scarcity of popu-
lation with such fertility of soil and
in such quantity? In asking this
question there is no attempt at in-
cipient Henry Gedrgism, or the still
more absurd Communism. But the
general opinion is that 30 acres of
flat land, or 200 acres on the hills,
are quite enough for any one man;
that is, if the ground is utilised to
the best purpose.,
Probably some day it will be re-
garded as a national crime, offence
against the well-being of humanity,
if land is not made to produce of
its fatness. Mr. Alf Slack kept a
splendid dairy herd on 30 acres.
His beasts were a perfect picture,
and, according to all accounts, par-
ticularly profitable.
On the flat there is ample room
for a couple of hundred more fami-
lies if land was worked to any ad-
vantage at all. This would not
necessarily mean parting with own-
ership, but it would signify access
of population, whether on the "hir-
ing labor,” leasing or sharing sys-
tem.
But what occurs at Bacchus Marsh
is found in other parts of the State.
There are great stretches of produc-
tive country, from some of which
cattle are sent that top the Mel-
bourne markets: but there is only
the one homestead, and little em-
ployment of labor. I have stood on
an elevation which has commanded
a view of the great Avon Valley,
but, save the “closer settlement” of
Boisdale, the homes were few and
far between —as few as the plums
in an economic baker’s bun.
Tillage is a hundred times better
for the individual and the nation
than grazing—that is, in areas which
admit of the former. Tillage would
automatically ensure disintegration
of large estates, and possibly some
day Bacchus Marsh —and it may not
be in the dim distance together
with the surrounding country, may
be uniformly dotted with home-
steads. It would then, indeed, be
transformed into a veritable hive of
industry.
The Marsh is very suitable for the
growth of fruit. There are two fine


orchards, James Cowan’s and A. C.
Simon’s. The osage orange border
around that of the latter rises 20-ft.
high, looks imposing, and forms an
impenetrable barrier. The flower
assumes the appearance of a partic-
ularly large orange, and is to say
the least spectacular. The osage
orange avenue through Mr. Simon’s
property is one of the sights of this
locality, and is renowned throughout
all the State. The Agricultural De-
partment considers there is no finer
avenue. It seems almost weather
proof, and in the hottest day of
summer the shade is cooling. The
hedge forms a splendid shelter for
the dairy cattle.
It is interesting to learn how Mr,
Simon got the idea of using this
growth as a protection to his pro-
perty. He was reading an Ameri-
can journal, and reference was made
to the Osage orange as a useful and
ornamental border, and he at once
set away for some seed. The Civil
war in the United States was being
waged at the time, and no seed ar-
rived, but years after, when Mr.
Simon had quite forgot about the
matter, a parcel arrived and the out-
come that stately collection of um-
brageous trees that makes the or-
chard of Mr. Simon so noticeable.
The apple —the Jonathan variety
particularly—is abundantly produced
and as Bacchus Marsh is so near to
the Melbourne market, one would
expect that the fruit industry would
become more and more important ;
but lucerne gets so far overwhelming
attention, and fruit has to take a se-
condary place. Later on I shall
dwell more fully upon fruit produc-
tion. I find the time chatting with
Mr. James Cowan on possibilities of
the Marsh, in regard to export of
fruit, pass only too quickly.
Mr. Simon is the pioneer orchar-
dist of the district. He bought the
property, Greenbank, from the late
Mr. W. Grant, who had received it
as a legacy from his brother. Dr.
Grant, “the public benefactor” of
Dacchus Marsh. The remains of the
doctor lie in the cemetery in the
grounds of the local Anglican
Church.
It is seldom. If ever, that one
comes across a cemetery attached to
a church ; but there, adjacent to the
building, are the old graves, tomb-
stones decaying with age, with the
epitaphs in some cases almost oblit-
erated. Some repairs had to be
done to the church, the foundations
sinking, possibly on account of hav-
ing been built on graves.
Dr. Grant introduced this famous
lucerne somewhere about the year
1840. He recognised its usefulness.
At first people had a prejudice
against the plant for the simple rea-
son that they were of the opinion
that if it once got into the soil it
would be hard to eradicate. In
other words, it would become a nox-
ious weed.
Dr. Grant was an enthusiast in
agriculture and horticulture. Ul-
timately, through his persistency, it
asserted its importance, for it was
able to combat unpropitious seasons,
and give a return when other plants
were dry and withered. Further,
it was proved that the locality by
constituents of the soil was the con-
genial habitat of this fodder, and
ceaseless cropping only intensified
the foothold.
Necessarily the memory of the
good doctor is fragrant. The in-
scription on his tombstone reads as
follows :—“ T was sick and ye vis-
ited me.’ Sacred to the memory of
J. Grant, Esq., surgeon, &c., born
at Edin. This stone was erected by
his friends and the inhabitants of
Bacchus Marsh in token of the value
of his labors in visiting the sick and
afflicted, and administering to their
want, labors which were continued
to the very day before his death.”
Lucerne plants have been known
to last in the ground from 25 to 30
years. There is a patch which was
grown from original seed sown by
Dr. Grant, and it is now alive and
vigorous. The tap root goes down
some 2 5 to 30 feet ; but such a state-
ment will not be regarded as extra-
ordinary when the scribe testifies
that he was shown a parsnip, pro-
duced by Mr. Patterson, former
manager of gasworks, 5 feet 7 inches
long. Some maize, grown by Mr.
P. A. M'Farlane, on Kelvin Grove,
was 14 feet in stem, and glancing
over some articles descriptive of the
place in 1887, I find that the writer,
describing the horse-breeding estab-
lishment of the Miller’s at the lower


end of the Marsh, states that he
saw carrots which had been grown
on irrigated land, one or two of
which were sufficient to satisfy the
appetite of the famous Cup horses
Boolka and Malua.
The deserted residence of the
Miller family ; a flour mill in utter
disrepair, the Woolpack, once a
pretentious hostelry, where visited
the Governor when a-hunting bent,
but now only used as a slaughter-
ing establishment to a butchering
business, attested only too signifi-
cantly the decline of the bottom end
of the Marsh.
Yet in this part Is some of the
richest land of the flat. Here meet
the Lerderderg and the Werribee
as it were to combine their strength
to force a passage through the
rougher country. The two streams
converging have in time of flood
deposited richer stratum of silt,
which fact is proved by the greater
luxuriance of growth.
Of late the establishment of dairy
farms indicate that the- bottom end
of the Marsh is no longer to remain
in primeval state. The sooner this
innovation and the renovation come
the better, for nothing makes more
for the welfare of a nation than a
“bold peasantry,” and the fact that
France consisted mostly of small
landowners was the reason why she
was able to pay off so quickly the
heavy war indemnity of 1871, which
Germany fondly anticipated would
for generations cripple her opponent.
It has not made for the advance-
ment of the community that so much
productive area should be only par-
tially developed. But there are evi-
dent signs that the barriers to in-
tense cultivation are to be removed.
It may be that it is Elwood Mead’s
irrigation policy that is effecting the
transformation. As to who pos-
sesses the land the community is in-
different; title of possession can be
freehold or leasehold ; one possessor
or many, but the community is in-
tensely interested that there should
be production. i
I am not going to argue that
there should or should not be absen-
tee landlordism, for there is such a
thing as the liberty of the individ-
ual, but, undoubtedly, where wealth
is extracted, there should also be the ,
shouldering of responsibility. Every
community makes its demand upon
public spirit, and the absentee land-
lord may have a tendency to be neg-
lectful of those duties which he owes
to the locality from which is drawn
his affluence in the shape of profit-
able prize stock. The history, of
Camperdown is the consistent inter-
est which the Manifold family take
in the welfare of the district, and
right in the centre of the town is a
clock tower raised by the family to
the memory of a relative departed,
but it also renders a public service.
It seems almost preposterous to
suggest to those that possess, but
what a splendid opportunity for wise
beneficence, when some institution
of public utility may be endowed,
say, public baths to be erected, and
named after the donor, to keep fresh
his memory so long as the commun-
ity shall last. The lavish outlay
in social functions will not bear
comparison with the permanent good
that is obtained in the providing of
that which makes for the comfort of
the community as a whole. It was
written that such and such a man
loved his nation “because he hath
built us a synagogue.’’ Bacchus
Marsh needs public baths : who will
serve the people ?
“The Woolpack” could tell much
history. Picture it in the early days
before the railway. The Melbourne
and Ballarat road was simply a
stream of vehicles, and “The Wool-
pack’’ was one of the important
stopping places. In those days it
was considered architectural, pala-
tial. The paintings on the walls of
some of the rooms, evidently per-
formed by some stranded artist, are
still distinguishable mid dust and
lumber.
The traveller, as footpads were
not in those days a rara avis, would
prefer to seek accommodation for
the night at The Woolpack rather
than camp on the public highway.
The yard at the close of the day
would get full of vehicles, and the
ligfit streaming from every window
would make a landmark to cheer
the belated traveller as, coming
down the rise now known as An-
thony’s cutting, he would picture
every stump to be a bushranger.


Despite elements of danger and
hardship, they were gay times. The
miner journeying from the gold-
field to the metropolis with a well-
filled belt would during his brief
sojourn at the inn make the pace
fairly hot, and incredible are the
tales told of the amount of money
that would cross the bar in a single
day.
But there stands the old Wool-
pack, and no one so' poor as to do
it reverence. A new order of things
has arisen. Yonder across the field
on the plateau is heard the deep-
chested heaving of the big engine
A 2, as it hurls along its procession
of handsome cars as if it were draw-
ing a perambulator. In a short
time the traveller is at his destina-
tion, Ballarat, which in the good old
Woolpack days would have meant
hours and hours of journey, and pos-
sibly much danger. The train has
put at a discount the road, and the
old Woolpack, like an abbey in ruins,
is a relic of its former greatness.
The Marsh had been generally
shifting towards Maddingley (that
is the railway station) and the
comely residences of the Messrs.
Pearce Bros, and of George Ramsey
on the eastern side had all the
appearance of the end of a section.
But recently there has been a halt
in the movement of the town Madd-
ingleywards, for in 'Lerderderg
street, on the north side of tli>
town, a number of fine brick villas
have been erected, and the name
Toorak has already been applied.
Probably there will never be a more
attractive residence in the Marsh
than that of Mr. R. H. Dugdale,
auctioneer, which, in the course of
a year or two, will be set virtually
in the greenest of domains.
It is taken as a postulate that a
town will ever grow towards or
around the railway station. Hence
we have New Gisborne. The town
of Sale, in Gippsland, affords an-
other striking example of the general
law, for Victoria street, with its fine
business places, is practically de-
serted, and is secondary to Raymond
street, formerly of no consequence,
but now a hum of activity, being
nearest to the railway station. But
locnlly, we give the converse of this
rule, for the town is not extending
to, but away from the station. It
may be taken for granted that, on
account of many reasons, the Main
street will ever be the principal
street in Bacchus Marsh. The mo-
tor traffic, between Ballarat and Mel-
bourne, alone is considerable. Geo-
graphically, the Main street is situ-
ated advantageously, the flats of the
Lerderderg on on© side, and those
of the Werribee on the other.
The time must eventuate when
Darley will be an independent ham-
let. It is no stretch of the imagina-
tion to picture such realisation. It
is all within the water area, and
every allotment must become pro-
ductive, and therefore valuable. The
flats cannot be worked without labor
—presume the canning industry is
started—and there must be the homes
of the laborer. His eyes will look
towards Darley as affording plenty
of scope, and every convenience. I
repeat it is no stretch of the imag-
ination, for trade follows the flag,
and some day the fertile slope of
Parley, adorned with numerous hab-
itations, will resound with the sound
of the blacksmith’s anvil, the car-
penter’s hammer, perhaps have its
own business thoroughfare.
The drainage of the higher land
surely is desirable, and how effective
the appearance of the town had it
stretched along Stamford Hill, right
on to Darley !
Alas our main thoroughfare is,
also, too cramped. The fathers of
the hamlet were not far-seeing
enough; it never occurred to them
that in time the flat would become
closely settled, and that the road
taking a short-cut from plateau to
plateau would be a high-way of
traffic, and that a town would spring
up. Unhappily to-day, though we
appreciate much the labors of the
founders of our town, we cannot
supply what has resulted from that
want of oversight.
Are the lucerne flats ultimately
to be largely taken up as residential
areas, for the town is growing ?
One part of the flat has already been
given up to that purpose. It is re-
grettable. It seemed almost sacri-
lege to me when I observed the
beautiful black soil being ruthlessly


displaced to make room for the foun-
dation of a building. You know the
soil, for it springs under your tread.
On the flat there is road upon road
which can only be likened to a mine
showing splendid prospects being
deliberately shut down.
Lerderderg Park, of many hun-
dreds of acres, is the place for re-
cuperation of horses. The proprie-
tor (Mr. Wills) is very courteous.
The various yards and boxes are in-
spected. A beautiful animal comes
up, tractable, friendly. There is a
natural dignity. The beast seems
to know he is * a topnotcher. He
will directly at some race carnival
be the cynosure of all eyes. It was
Mooltan, and his value went into
several thousand guineas.
The noted Carbine at one time
had his home at Lerderderg, and
drew a great number of admirers.
Mooltan liked his quarters ; the lu-
cerne suited his taste, and in the
yard which is so well protected from
inclement weather, but which affords
ample space for merry gamble, he
would probably like to have spent
the rest of his days in a state of
otium cum dignitate.
Some yearlings are frisking about.
Each represents a big price : some
are imported, and all are under
careful supervision. At a certain
hour all are marched into their
boxes. Poor youngster ! As a “two-
year-old” his troubles will begin.
Mr. M'Arthur, former proprietor, in
giving some idea of the responsibil-
ity of managing the Park, said that
he was at times accountable for
£20.000 worth of horseflesh.
The horses in many cases seldom
remain for more than two or three
weeks, but' during that time the in-
creased girth shows that this retreat
has had its manifest advantages ;
and who knows but that Bacchus
Marsh lucerne may not be respon-
sible for that handsome bay mare
some day at some great event, be-
ing the first to catch the judge’s
eye down the straight ?
(Further on I shall give a fuller
account of Lerderderg Park, under
management of Mr. John Wills).
I am going to quote fully, as it
suits my purpose, and the neglect of
parenthesis will not. I hope, sub-

Disguise it as you will, we all un-
blushingly enter other men’s labors,
reaping what others have sown. In-
deed, one reputable journal heads
its columns of extracts, “The Judic-
ious Thief,’’ and a most appropri-
ate title it is.
There is a purple patch in that
descriptive article of 18 8-7, though
1 will be frank enough to say that,
clever as this article is, it does not
generally appear to my limited judg-
ment to be overwhelmingly readable.
Possibly it may be the evanescent
reading taste that accounts for our
want of appreciation of the sus-
tained workmanship of journalists of
days gone by. The writer has gone
to rest, so peace be to his literary
shades, and scribe look to thine own
escutcheon.
Was Capt. William Henry Bac-
chus really contemporary with the
Accession ? We can answer nearly so,
for this is the story as gathered up
from the old men of the district, the
one or two relics of the time
and the sons of the earliest pioneers
who have kept the record. On the
2 4th March, 1836, the schooner
Hetty left Georgetown (Tas.) hav-
ing on, board Mr. Kenneth S. Clarke,
a representative of the earliest Aus-
tralian land companies, commissioned
to spy out and secure some portion
of those fat lands already described
by Sir T. Mitchell and Batman with
his associates. On 2 9th November
of the same year he started out from
Port Phillip to find and take up
country.
We have no records of the journey.
We. do not know whether he made
the regulation six miles a day, more
or less, or whether he grazed up the
Werribee river or struck out on a
more westerly track and worked
back again along the foot of the
mountains. Only this is certain,
that in less than two years from the
time when Batman anchored for the
night in the mouth of the Werribee
Mr. Kenneth S. Clarke drove ht
little flock of sheep into the big
fiat on which the same river issues
from its great gorge and mountain
cradle.
Very nearly 50 years ago ! And
what did he see on his first entry ?
Let iis try to picture him working
down from the tableland somewhere


about where Anthony’s cutting is
now. The *feheep would see the water
trickling bright and pure over the
boulders in the river bed, and there
are many trees on this river bank
that saw these parents of Australia’s
sheep rush down through the wat-
tles on the cliff-like face of the
tableland to drink.
Mr. Clarke would be ahead, of
course, and looking curiously out.
A blackfellow might accompany him.
The shepherds and pack-horses
would follow behind the sheep. If
the sun was declining, right west-
ward would be black mountain
range, which remains unchanged to-
day. Rising over the lower densely
timbered spurs, the Pentland hills,
bold and bleak, and the Bald hill
patched with wattle, but with open-
ing spaces promising fair pasturage.
The flat would be white, for the
year must have been near its close,
and when the low light struck
through the crowns of the occasional
great gums there must have been
the glory such as Buvelot saw and
painted in his “Waterpool at Coler-
aine.”
To the left he would see the black
grove which overshadows the meet
ing of the two rivers, and to the
right the long flat stretching like a
tongue to the opening gorge of
mountains then unnamed. The tall,
dry grass would brush his girth in
all the open country, and kangaroos
would only be seen as they jumped,
and emus when they raised their
heads. A rising smoke by a pool
far up the river would bid him halt
and turn his sheep back to the
mountain foot, and make his camp
and set his watch.
Thus 50 years. Shall we leap an
other quarter of a century ? We shall
And many changes. The old mili-
tary settlers have gone —Captains
Bacchus, M'Crae, Pines, Atkinson,
Commissaries Beal and Lindsay.
Only one name is familiar now. In
1838 Mr. Clarke, writing to his em-
ployers, gave the name of “Bacchus
Marsh” to the country he had sur-
rendered to Capt. Bacchus.
But Capt. Bacchus did not live
long. for the stone in the grave by
the church bears the date of 1848.
He saw not the marvel 0 which
marked the close of the first quarter
of a century.
Mr. Christopher Crisp in an ac-
count of the founding of the Marsh
writes in 1891, as follows :—This is
one of the oldest settlements in Vic-
toria, having been entered by white
men with sheep in 1836. Its name
is derived from one of the earliest
settlers. Captain W. H. Bacchus,
born in 1782, and formerly a Cap-
tain of the 18th Light Dragoons,
subsequently Captain of the Second
Surrey Militia, a member of an old
English family called Bauhus or
Baccus, which has been traced back
to the Battle of Boroughbridge in
1322. Early in 1838 this gentleman
and his son (the former died in
1849 and the latter in 1887, both
aged 67 years) came to the east or
Melbourne end of the valley with
sheep from Tasmania, and camped
at the Pyreete creek. The land to
the west, up as far as Mt. Black-
wood, was then occupied by Mr.
Kenneth S. Clarke, manager for the
Great Lake Company of Van Die-
man’s Land. This gentleman left
Georgetown Heads, Tasmania, in the
schooner Hetty on 2 4th March, 1836,
with 600 sheep and other stock. Mr.
Clarke started on 2 9th November,
1836, for the valley since known as
Bacchus Marsh, and at the beginning
of 183 8 moved on to the hills called
by him and since known as the
Pentland Hills, where he had already
formed out-stations. Mt. Blackwood
at that time was called Clarke’s Big
Hill. Mr. Clarke gave up the country
about the valley to Captain Bacchus
and son, on the understanding that
they did not occupy any country
which" he claimed on the Pentland
Hills. Mr. Bacchus, jun., took up
his quarters at the hut vacated by
Clarke on the Lerderderg (or Larde-
dairk, as it was then called by the
natives). The name “Bacchus’s
Marsh’’, as all old colonists called it,
arose from Mr. Clarke giving it that
name in 1838 when informing his
employers of the arrangement he had
made with Captain Bacchus, and that
name was adopted by travellers and
others, also subsequently by the. Go-
vernment. The locality seems to
have been known even in those early
days as good country, for Messrs.
Whyte, also from Tasmania, took up
a portion of Clarke’s run, and had


to be bought out for £IOO. They
took up country on the Wannon, to
which they had been directed by Mr.
Bacchus, jun., who had seen it when
travelling overland to Adelaide with
cattle. A desperate attack was made
upon them by the blacks, who could
not be driven off until thirty or forty
had been killed. The first survey of
Bacchus Marsh was commenced
about the end of 1839, by Mr. W. W.
Darke, who was instructed by the
Sydney Government to mark off a
number of allotments for retired
officers of the army and navy who
had land orders from the Home Go-
vernment which were taken as cash.
Mr. Darke named the parishes, select-
ing wholly native names. The fol-
lowing is an extract from one of these
old Crown Grants : —“3oth Nov.,
1842. Parish of Korkuperrimul,
County of Bourke. Acres 101. Grant
to Alexander M'Crae, entered as No.
387, folio 110, Register No. 1, of
Port Philip Land Purchases, in the
Surveyor General’s Office, Sydney,
30th December, 1842. Enrolled in
the Supreme Court of N.S.W., for the
District of Port Phillip, in Land Pur-
chases Book A., page 33, 22nd Feb-
ruary, 184 3. Under Regulations of
sth December, 1840, Alexander Mac-
Crae purchased 101 acres for £1 per
acre. Allowed £9 7 as balance of
£2 00 authorised for him as a late
Captain in H.M. 84th Regiment of
Foot of upwards of twenty years ser-
vice, under regulations of Ist August,
1838. Sir George Gipps, Governor.’’
Could the writer who in 1887 gave
such a doleful account of the train
to Bacchus Marsh rattling and rol-
ling over rocks, and in particular of
some passengers looking perturbed
as “that pale pilot who seeks in vain
to find his course ’twixt tidal and
river water on the mighty Orinoco.”
only have had a glimpse forward 2 0
years “at the dimly-lighted station
where a few poor, stunted buildings
are seen surrounded by a thick dark-
ness” being supplanted by the pres-
ent commodious edifice, and also at
the noble “expresses” gliding along
the roadway with all the ease and
speed of bird with swiftest pinion,
what a mighty revelation he would {
have experienced ! Bacchus Marsh I
must ultimately become p, suburb of
Melbourne.
It is many ways now regarded as
within the suburban radius, but as
transit becomes more expeditious
and less costly its identification with
the metropolis will be all the more
certain. The local business man de-
plores the fact ; the average inhabi-
tant does not. The marvel to me is
that those coigns of vantage, those
hills with such glorious outlook, are
not seized by the metropolitan mag-
nate where he might locate his coun-
try residence, and so escaping the
fumes of the city, within easy radius
retire at evening to breathe the
i purer and rarer atmosphere, and
during the days feast his eyes upon
the products of intense culture on
the green flats below.
Maddingley, where the railway
station is located, would fain become
the centre of traffic, but the Marsh
must have had its weather eye open
in early days as to possible devel-
opment. In the purest spirit of
self-denial the Marsh quite approved
of its neighbor, Maddingley, getting
all the parks, show-grounds, police
reserves,, church reserves, &c. By
the law that trade follows the flag,
that is the railway station, Madding-
ley should be the business centre;
but what with the said parks, re-
serves, &c., there is not room enough
to swing a cat in, and the Marsh
retains all its trade pre-eminence,
and Maddingley has to content itself
with the glory of affording such un-
bounded facility for sport and re-
laxation. It was a master move on
the part of the Marsh folk, while
those of Maddingley, like the pro-
verbial Presbyterian kittens, had not
their eyes open.
But truly we are all proud of our
park. It is indeed a place of beauty,
and may the time never come that
any section of it will be desecrated
by being devoted to business pur-
poses ! During the season it is a
popular resort for picnics from the
metropolis, and it is no uncommon
sight to see two large special trains
lined up at the station, pouring out
the living freight who on the grassy
sward and in cooling shade will
spend the day drinking in the beauty
of the scene, inhaling an atmosphere
which as compared with that of the


begrimed city is as the breath of
Heaven.
It is always interesting to know
the beginning of things, how this
settlement became a city, that poor
lad a millionaire. I picture the
original start of Bacchus Marsh.
Now there are substantial homes,
macadamised roads, stately churches,
and all the concomitants of civilis-
ation ; but in the early days the
teamster, avoiding the circuitous
route of the uplands, makes a bee-
line across the marsh, swampy and
covered with wild fowl. The Wer-
ribee had not then a deep bed as it
has now. Inhabitants can remember
when it was a graceful stream, with
surface of water just below level of
banks, and in time of heavy rain
gently submerging the flat; but its
bed has been scoured out, and deep
is this channel rough and stony.
Says an old inhabitant : “The
Werribee will neve, be right until
all along there are constructed silt
dams, and the river regains its orig-
inal bed.” However, the aforesaid
teamster takes the bee-line, and the
Marsh becomes with continued traf-
fic a bog. Some say this was the
genesis of the town. First a hotel,
then a blacksmith’s shop, and hence
Bacchus Marsh.
The boggy state of the Marsh was
vouched for in early days, so my
old friend Mr. O’Hagan tells me,
by a rev. gentleman who related the
incident many years ago at a public
meeting held in the old Mechanics’
hall, now a private residence. It
appears that the rev. gentleman was
proceeding to the meeting, really a
soiree (that word is becoming obso-
lete, we prefer conversazione), when,
just beyond the Woolpack, he noticed
a hat on the road. Dismounting, he
lifted up the hat, and to his as-
tonishment observed a head under-
neath. The owner thereof, in cour-
teous tones, asked the rev. gentle-
man if he would kindly help him
(the individual up to his neck in
the beg) out of his predicament.
This was done, and afterwards a
further request was made that as-
sistance might be given to get the
bullocks out, who were still deeper
down ! I am not quite certain
whether Mr. O’Hagan was pulling
the guileless scribe’s leg, or whether
the rev. gentleman was doing the
same with his audience. In any
case, cum grano salis.
Ultimately, to navigate the Marsh
four hotels were needed —Leahy’s
hotel, the Woolpack Inn just within
the valley, the Border Inn midway,
and the stout stone house on Stam-
ford hill, which has had its day and
ceased to be. This was mild, for I
have known in a town with a modest
population of 100, a crossing place
for stock, there to be seven hotels,
whiich vied with one another in early
times in offering accommodation to
the thirsty drover.
I will close this article with an-
other quotation, “And the laborious
teamster and weary traveller doubt-
less stopped at all three inns, and
the bullocks and horses had reward
for their labors in the rich clover
paddocks, and the hotels hummed
and roared, and ounces and sover-
eigns passed up and down in the
quaint row of brick houses which
then, as to-day (1887) bore, the
name of Little Bourke street. There
was the constant debauch and fre-
quent riot ; the thin-edge shriek of
a woman dividing the shuddering
night at times, and the roar of a
Bacchanalian chorus giving unin-
structed travellers erroneous ideas
as to the naming of the place. Wild
times then in the Marsh, as else-
wnere. But the fifties and sixties
past, and the seventies in general
dull monotony, and at length the
decade of the eighties arrived with
its dream of marvellous progress
and practical schemes of rapid de-
velopment.”
Many years ago I traversed fre-
quently what was afterwards to be
the site of the Poseidon goldfield.
I knew every inch of the ground.
It was a lonely spot, no house in
sight, and beyond was the wooded
valley of the Loddon. I little
thought that beneath my very feet
and at the roots of the tufts of
grass, lay ensconced the famous slugs,
and that over 2 0 years subsequently
would break out the big rush.
It was just my luck not to dis-
cover some of those “welcome
strangers,” which would have given
me the requisite pleasure of driving
a motor and of wearing creased
trousers for the rest of my natural,


You see, after all, the child is father
to the man. I am reminded of the
youngster who when asked what he
would do if he had wealth, replied
that he would have his fill of bacon
and swing on a gate all day.
I would draw the analogy that as
the diggers rushed to the Ballarat
Eldorado it little occurred to the
wealth-seeker that those flats over
which roamed in sparse numbers
Capt. Bacchus’ sheep would some
day have wonderful productive out-
put, would in many respects be bet-
ter than a gold mine ; for the re-
turns would be reliable, not inter-
mittent. intensifying rather than
diminishing.
Said an old Gippsland farmer as
he despatched trucks of cattle to the
Melbourne market : “That beats 2-oz.
to the ton ! ” If at present the Marsh
runs £l3O p.ac., what will be its face
value when distributing channels
ramify the locality, making every
inch of it of marketable use ? Mr.
Elwood Mead has great conception
of the Marsh. He has remarked
what a magnificent storage basin it
would make, and at little cost. But
the land surely is too valuable to be
submerged, and one Tabilk scheme
is sufficient.
The response of tbe local soil to
moisture, whether on the uplands
or lowlands, is marvellous. At the
end of summer, * particularly at the
close of a period of drought, the
hills are black and bare, but let
there be a fall of rain, and with
almost magic touch is the transfor-
mation, for the country in every
direction becomes a carpet of re-
splendent green.
The Marsh is indeed pictorial.
Stand on Lerderderg Flat and look
towards Coornmill. On moist morn-
ings the wooded spurs are clothed
in deepest purple, and in the gorges
lies mist like so much drapery.
There is repetition of hill and gorge,
but with varying tint, right round
to Mount Bullengarook, and in the
hazy distance are observed Mount
Macedon and The Hump. Mr. W.
P. Robertson, of “The Highlands,”
says that his altitude means a dif-
ference of eight degrees during
times of high temperature.
We have only to go back into past
conditions to understand why the
digger disregarded the fertile area
for that which was auriferous. Agri-
culture was only then a synonym for
long hours, hardship, monotony,
with, at best, only a meagre margin
for profit; but mining was full of
bustle, excitement, and at any mo-
ment the striking of a reef might
mean a permanent competency with
a return to the Old Land.
It has been alleged that the ex-
traction of every ounce of gold
means that it has cost more than it
is worth. This may be a calumny,
it may not have any basis of fact.
I am constrained to say, however,
that a locality whose resources of
wealth is a chocolate soil proves to
be immeasurably sounder than one
which is characterised by poppet-
heads.
Personally, I would prefer 300
acres of these lucerne flats to scrip
even to the same superficial extent.
I have lived in a mining town for
a great many years: I have lived in
an agricultural district for a great
many years ; and I would say, give
me poddies, fats, stores, lucerne,
maize, or potatoes every time.
Now for some more “practical”
facts concerning the said Marsh.
1 spoke some time ago to a local
producer, to a farmer who owned
2 5 acres of good flat land. He had
20 cows, 2 horses, 1 bull, and 2 or
3 heifers. That was the live stock
inventory of the farm. Those 2 0
cows one year made £SOO. It must
be granted that on account of
drought, high prices ruling, that
was above the average.
I enquired about method,' and I
was told that one of the first things
was to get a good strain of cow. A
cross between an Ayrshire and a
milking shorthorn, and one between
a Jersey and a milking shorthorn,
were distinctive of the herd- which
gave such an excellent record.
Another necessity prescribed was
that there should be regularity of
feeding and my informant had
nothing but hand-feeding. Hours
of feeding were 5.30 a.m., 8 to 9,
midday, 6 o’clock, 7.30, and 9
o’clock. Tbe animals were fed in
stalls, and each ox knew its own
crib. They were let out at 9 o’clock
into a paddock which served as a
camping ground.


We talked over the possibility or
probability of improvement (en-
hancement would be better word)
to district when the elaborate water
scheme was in full swing. There
were four cuttings of lucerne in the
year, the watering on flat serving
for two cuttings.
When these facts were given the
Pyke’s Creek scheme was yet in
process of formation. Water was
only obtainable up to the end of
October ; if a wet season, later. If
a supply could be got in January,
about double the stuff could be pro-
duced.
Four years kgo the scribe made
some comments. Experience is pro-
ving their accuracy. “When the
great Pyke’s Creek storage is com-
pleted it means ample supply of
water in the driest season ; it may
also mean that under the water
rate imposed, hundreds of acres of
valuable soil, which now are only
devoted to grazing, may be given to
intense culture. If so, then the
Marsh will decidedly be on the up
grade, and who knows but that the
object lesson may be contagious,
and instead of occasional tillage,
the fruitful Pentland Hills and the
region of Myrniong may not more
freely be put under the plough ?”
In regard to irrigation, 1 under-
stand that Bacchus Marsh was the
first to introduce the use of the can-
vas hose, which, up-to-date and
clever an irrigationist as Mr. Elwood
Mead is, was a new thing to him. He
is reported to have contributed an
elaborate article to a prominent
American scientific journal on his
“discovery.” Undoubtedly the local-
ity is highly suitable for a perfect
system of water application—an area
fairly longitudinal, with elevated
country on every side like a saucer
to carry the races, and there.are un-
dulations throughout the flat which
will bear the distributing channels.
The hills are quite as fertile as
the flats, if there is water, I am
told that on some of the hills the
rich chocolate soil goes down 100
feet. The Lerderderg flat up towards
the Gorge probably in earlier days
gave the best returns, for there it is
narrow, and each of the farms com-
mands a supply of water in its own
ground from its own channels. But
when the full system is operative the
lower end of the Marsh will take the
record. From the Lerderderg flat
came a milk return with very little
outside labor of £l2O per month.
I have before me an article on
“Lucerne Growing,” read by the late
Mr. Thomas Cain before the Annual
Convention of the Victorian Cham-
ber of Agriculture. It is very prac-
tical, and I have to refrain from
making copious extracts. His testi-
mony is—“ According to my experi-
ence as a dairy farmer, extending
over 40 years, there is no fodder
plant that will at the same cost, and
from the same area of land, furnish
landholders with the same amount
of fodder per acre, quality and quan-
tity both considered, as lucerne.”
I must quote another paragraph,
however :—“Opinions differ in dif-
ferent districts as to the relative
methods of sowing lucerne broad-
cast and drilling the seed. At Bac-
chus Marsh, the broadcast system is
most favored. My reason for sup-
porting broadcast sowing is that the
“crowns,” or “hearts,” of the luc-
erne roots have a tendency to force
their way up above the level of the
surface, which is very objectionable,
and when grown in drills this pro-
jection of the hard 'crows’ of the
roots overground is encouraged.
With drilling, too, there is always
the liability of small ridges to gather
between the rows, which, coupled
with the hard, knobby growth of
projecting roots, not only hinders the
free distribution of the water, but
also operates against a close and
clean cut being made of the crop by
the mower. W T hen sown broadcast,
it is easy to keep the lucerne plants
level with close cutting ; and this,
in addition to securing a uniform
distribution of water, pat-
chiness in growrii, and' gives an
evener sample of lucerne when cut.”
Chicory in early days was grown
largely by Messrs. Pearce Brothers,
30 and 40 acres being devoted to
such purpose. When the price came
down from £3 0 per ton to a much
lower figure, it was not found so
profitable, ‘ as a great amount of
labor was required, particularly to
keep the fields clean. Just as the
hop kilns along the Mitchell, now
affording only a resting-place for


the tramp and cattle, attest to what
was once a flourishing industry, so
in the Marsh we have the same
experience on a smaller scale. A
chicory kiln was no slight undertak-
ing, as it meant an outlay of close
upon £I,OOO.
I have referred to the late Mr.
Thomas Cain, and never did the lo-
cality have one more interested in
its progress. He was in every sense
a true citizen. He had been a Shire
Councillor since the seventies. He
was one of those men who, by sheer
grit, by business shrewdness, rise
above their circumstances.
It certainly is not demeaning to
the memory of the late Mr. Cain to
say that, when a night school was
opened at the local State school, that
he sat down at forty years of age
humbly to acquire the rudiments of
learning.
Surely it is not to the discredit of
Sir John Quick, the jurist of the
Federal Constitution, to state that
as a boy he drove a whim in Ben-
digo. Mr. Cain became a very
graceful public speaker, and the
duties of the various offices which he
filled, he discharged with great capa-
bility. He has passed away.
Requiescat in pace.
I have struck the personal note.
No one has endeavoured to do more
for the advancement of the district
than Mr. Christopher Crisp, the
editor and proprietor of the local
“Express”—a journal vigorous, gra
phic, conducted with much ability.
Mr. Crisp is, as he tells you, an
Imperialist. It gleams out from
every leading article, every para-
graph, from every footnote. In stir-
ring periods it is declaimed weekly-
in our ears that cosmology is con-
centrated in the expansion and un •
ification and glory of the British
Empire. As a truly patriotic people
we endorse this sentiment.
Mr. Crisp states that he will not
be restrained by the limits of edi-
torial conventionalism. His paper
is not a paper ; it is Mr. Crisp’s
weekly letter to the people of Bac-
chus Marsh ; and year in, year out,
for 40 years he has been a guard-
ian of the public welfare, advocat-
ing in season and out of season
public needs at much pecuniary sac-
rifice to himself. As he moved
about the town, any deficiency was
duly noted, and there followed the
paragraph that the official concerned
might do well to see to its rectifica-
tion, and all done in kindly spirit.
Years ago Mr. Crisp published a
brochure, “Christopher Crisp in
search of Cosmology,” and evi-
dently by his intellectual activity he
is still after this Holy Grail. After
all, a community depends upon its
units, and Bacchus Marsh may well
be proud of such citizens who have
laid the foundation as Messrs. Cain,
Crisp and others.
Sir Walter Scott was an anti-
quarian. To him, to be delving into
the past was of absorbing Interest.
“Old Mortality” stands out graphic.
As X peruse some records of the
doings of Bacchus Marsh in the
morn of its history, a strange fas-
cination exerts itself. There is
every reason for the establishment
of that Historical Society recently
formed in the metropolis, whose
purpose is to gather early facts of
the history of our State as narrated
perhaps, by participators anyhow,
by those of the first remove—before
they sink into oblivion. Such data
may seem to some unimportant, but
to others they have an atmosphere
of attractiveness peculiarly their
own, and by the historian of a sub-
sequent period may be regarded as
valuable. To a Thomas Carlyle
there is no such thing as Dryasdust.
Kindly allow a brief digression.
I like to be reminiscent. I go back
in imagination to the early times of
that mining neighborhood in which
my boyhood’s days were passed. Aye,
money was made easily in those days
—easy come, easy go. Can you pic-
ture men not knowing how to spend
money quickly enough, playing
marbles £IOO aside ? As a lad I
remember hearing of Cornish miners
of the early days in Bendigo, wear-
ing the gaily-colored sash with tas-
sels depending gracefully from the
side, and it was not discarded even
when they were able to appear in a
silk hat.
And what of the stirring incidents
of Ballarat’s Eureka Stockade ! Are
these not as poetical as the deeds
of Clancy of the Overflow, which
were or were not embalmed in song
by the Man from the Snowy River ?


Verily I have been on the spot in
Gippsland where Allan M'Lean,
afterwards State Premier and Fed-
eral statesman, watched his sheep as
a shepherd, and composed poetry.
Old inhabitants will tell you they
remember the future statesman pass-
ing by on his nag, carrying his
bundle. The association gave inter-
est to the place, lonely and out-of-
the-way as it was. And this Marsh
in which I make my habitat has
history, much of which is vivid.
I speak to Mr. Cornelius Mahoney,
in his 9 3rd year, and be thoroughly
revels in recounting the life of the
Marsh in the sixties and seventies.
Indeed, he is an authority. He was
before the public footlights for a
lengthened period, a Shire Council-
lor, Captain of the Prince of Wales
Light Horse, Justice of the Peace,
&c.
Just a word or two about “the
most noted Troop of the sixties.”
Among those who started it was Cr.
W. H. M'Farlane, who rose to Cap-
tain. Cr. Molesworth Greene, of
Greystones, became the first Cap-
tain. Sword exercise was held in
the old Mechanics’ Institute, and the
riding school was between the
R.C. Church and the Manor House.
Inspectional drill was generally
taken on the Common at Darley ;
while for big gun practice there
was a target in Miller’s paddock,
just under the hill. The Troop was
important enough to have a howit-
zer, drawn by four horses, and great
was local interest in this formidable
piece of artillery.
Despite his , great age, Mr. Ma-
honey’s faculties are very sharp.
His relaxation is mathematics, pos-
sibly the binomial theorem in par-
ticular. His utterance is clear, and
his converse betokens a personality
as vigorous as if manhood's portals
were only opening.
Aye, we later generations, nursed
in the lap of the refinements of civ-
ilisation, are dropping off one by
one ; but the pioneers, whose cover-
ing in their various itinerary was
only the canopy of Heaven, are out-
living us. They had stamina, but
ws might metaphorically be likened
to that culinary delicacy called
“trifle.” Hunger, roughing it, was
the pioneer’s sauce ; our epicurean
taste needs a diet which insidiously
destroys.
Is the Marsh conducive to longev-
ity ? For one, Mr. Mahoney is
vigorous at 93, and there are num-
erous others whom I have inter-
viewed, collecting data, who are just
bordering on 80. Mr. Mahoney for
a continuous period was the facto-
tum of educational activity locally.
It is interesting to read of the
growth of State School No. 28. The
school is hoary with antiquity. I
am indebted to Mr. T. Anderson, of
Border Store for much valuable in-
formation, via “Express,” of certain
dates. Many interesting particulars
were supplied by the Secretary of
Education Department in 1906. It
appears that the school had existed
many years before the separation of
Victoria from New South Wales,
coming for that period under the
Board of Education of the latter
State.
The first head teacher was Mr.
H. G. Ball, and the number of chil-
dren attending was 34. The first
documents that could be found re-
lating to school was a letter from
Mr. Ball addressed to H. Childers,
Esq., school officer, Melbourne, ac-
knowledging receipt of cheque for
one month’s salary—£3/6/8.
This official was afterwards the
Right Hon. C. B. Childers, at one
time a Secretary of State, for the
Colonies. Evidently the salary was
not satisfactory to Mr. Ball, for
there was the intimation—“l intend
to proceed to the Ballarat diggings
with the hope of benefiting my cir-
cumstances.”
Mr. and Mrs. Ball were succeeded
by Mr. and Mrs. Simon Morrison.
Mr. Morrison, after retiring from
teaching, was appointed Secretary
of the Ballarat Agricultural and
Pastoral Society.
Sir C. Hotnam, the Governor,
visited the school in 1854, and en-
tered in register a record—“ School
seems to be well kept”—a laconic
utterance that was capable of some
misconstruction. Under and sub-
ject to the National Board of Edu-
cation, the affairs of the school were
administered by a Board of local
patrons—Messrs. C. E. Labilliere,
Charles J. Griffith, W. H. Bacchus,
and E. Goodman. Of these two last,


one appears to have left the district,
and Mr. Goodman to have gone to
England prior to April, 18 52. The
places were taken by Mr. R. N.
Clarke and Mr. Jas. Young, and at
the same time Mr. Richard Minchin
was added to the list and appointed
Hon. Secretary.
The first report (1854) was favor-
able to the teacher, but condemned
the total unfitness of the rented
school-house. The inspector conven-
ed a meeting of local patrons, whose
numbers had been increased by the
appointment of Dr. Grant and
Messrs. R. Grant, W. Grant, J. Watt,
J. Leahy, Henry James, and William
Crook, to consider the steps to be
taken to erect a permanent school.
But evidently a battle royal' en-
sued among parents as to best site,
until we have the Inspectorial re-
port. “The site selected is about the
centre, and pleases neither party.”
Eventually this was adhered to, de-
spite much correspondence ; three-
quarters of an acre near the Ler-
derderg being purchased from Mr.
H. James, and, on the residents
subscribing £2OO, the National
Board supplied and hart erected one
of a number of iron houses imported
by them from England. The amount
of carriage and erection was £4 30,
the contractors being Malcolm C.
Forbes & Co.
The Common Schools Act was
passed on 18th June, 1862, and the
first local committee for Bacchus
Marsh, of which James E. Crook was
the honorary correspondent, at once
commenced to take action for the
erection of a new school-house, which
was said to be urgently required. It
was decided by the Department to
grant permission to sell the iron
building, the proceeds to be remitted
to the Board ; but a memorial, with
119 signatures attached, was pre-
sented urging the retention of the
old iron school-house. The advo-
cates of removal, however,- alleged
that many of the aforesaid signatures
had been “obtained by stratagem,”
After protracted negotiations, a
new site was obtained, which has
served up to date. The land cost
in purchase money and conveyance
expenses £67/4/, of which the
Board only paid half. The convey-
ance, dated 22/2/66, was from John
Atkins, and Robert Nalder Clarke to
the Board of Education. The total
cost of the new building was £7 82,
and of this sum £3 82 was granted
by the Board, and £4OO was pro-
vided by local subscription. Such
is the Departmental history (much
abbreviated) of the school.
We get a little sidelight as to the
state of educational comfort and fa-
cilities in the beginning of things
at the Marsh by the reminiscences
of the second school-master, Mr.
Morrison. I have a copy of a re-
port of a complimentary social to
that gentleman as appearing in the
“Express” of 19 06. I condense that
report. Mr. T. Anderson was the
chief speaker on behalf of old Bac-
chus Marshians.
He called to memory when he
used to go to the old school in what
had been Betty Cullen’s old hut.
School was next held in a slab hut
on the Maddingley side of the river,
in Pat. Kennedy’s little paddock, be-
hind where Michael Reynolds now
lives. The fees were 1/ per .week
for one scholar, lOd. for two, 9d.
for three. There were numerous
blackfellows and their dogs about —
King Billy, Jimmy Cockatoo, Sulky
Dick, Jacky Jacky, and lots of lubras
and picaninies. Mr. Morrison lived
in a tent; they were fashionable in
those days. The common motor of
the time was a bullock-dray, and, in-
deed, people often drove to church
in a farm dray. Mr. Anderson has
vivid memory of Mr. Morrison having
to pull up his trousers and take off
his boots to cross the Werribee, for
there was no bridge then.
I now extract from Mr. Morrison’s
reply. When he opened school in
185 3, on the Broadlands Estate, in
a cottage belonging to the late Mr.
Henry James, dwellings were few
and far between. There were no
bridges between Melbourne and Bal-
larat. There were only 12 schools
in connection with the Government
then. As population increased there
was application for one school to be
opened at Maddingley and another
at the Marsh. He opened the school
at Maddingley in 1855. It was a
very novel schoolhouse—a small slab
hut on the eastern side of the police
paddock. There was little Garniture.
The second school, that near the


Maddingley ' bridge, was the most
unique of all —two windows, large
fireplace, one door, bark roof, and
earthen floor. It was a complete
museum of natural history, pre-his-
toric nature study. There were in-
sects, winged and wingless. Mr.
Morrison carried many a bucket of
water like a Chinaman to keep down
the dust on the floor. Eventually the
inhabitants set to work, and with
the aid of a Government grant a nice
stone building with wooden floor
was erected. After serving a term
of eight years, Mr. Morrison was
transferred to another field. He was
thoughtful enough to note down the
ruling prices of commodities of those
days. Cereals paid well then —flour
£6O per ton. He had paid £l3/2/
for two bags of flour. Potatoes went
to £4O per ton. Butter, 4/,per lb.;
bread, 2/3, and 4/ per 4-lb. loaf
This was in 1853-4. He once meas-
ured a hay-stack on # Mlr. John Mac-
Kenzie’s farm. It contained 9 tons.
The owner got £ls per ton for it, or
£135 for a little bit of a rick. Culti-
vation was carried on by bullock
teams; Horses were scarce. A pair
of greys imported from Tasmania
cost £360.
The traffic through Bacchus Marsh
to the diggings was enormous.. The
now deserted Woolpack Inn was a
fair, and the roads were so bad at
the foot of the valley at Leahey’s
hotel that drays were sail to sink
out of sight.
The Russian war of 1854-5 roused
the martial ardour of the country-
side, and Bacchus Marsh raised its
famous Company of Garribaldians —
the best volunteer regiment, Mr.
Morrison said, the State ever saw.
Their dress was extremely pic-
turesque—red blanket over a blue
tunic —and it hit public sentiment of
the time immensely. They had one
of the best drill instructors in the
late Sergt-major. Bowser, an old In-
dian officer of great experience, and
one borne to be a commander of men.
He was father of Mr. John Bowser,
M.L.A.
From Bacchus Marsh Mr. Morri-
son went to Learmonth, and in 1864
he was appointed secretary, of the
Ballarat Agricultural and Pastoral
Society. During the evening Mr.
Morrison was asked to give the I
toast for which he was noted on
Pentland Hills. It appears he used
to visit the Pentland Hills in the old
hook and scythe days to measure up
the harvesters’ work, and upon such
occasions the neighbours would meet.
The toast was supposed to have
been given by an elderly bride at
her marriage feast in Scotland long
ago :—“Here’s to the young folk :
confusion to the auld folk that
wadna let young folk like folk ; for
if young folk would get leave to like
folk, folk wad like folk as well as
ever folk liket folk since folk was
folk.”
Orthodoxy is each man’s doxy,
and heterodoxy is the other fellow’s
doxy—so runs the gentle satire. Al-
though there are a thousand more or
less,' definite lines of ecclesiastical
demarcation, Bacchus Marsh is com-
mendably not too assertive in this
direction. We believe in a fair thing.
We have only five denominations —■
Baptist, Catholic, Anglican, Method-
ist, and Presbyterian. It is only
right to add that seldom in the com-
munity is heard the grating which
accompanies the sharpening of the
croscut saw of sectarianism. We are
all in a delightful state of unani-
mity.
The Protestant Church have united
in many movements. There is a
United Literary and Debating So-
ciety, a united public questions com-
mittee, and during the winter a ser-
ies of united services. Such pulpit
luminaries as Prof. Rentoul, Canon
Sadlier (now Bishop Sadlier) Rev.
J. Thomas (now President of Meth-
odist Conference), the Yen. Arch-
deacon Tucker, Rev. J. Buntine and
others have occupied one or other of
the local pulpits.
I will review the development of
the different Churches, without any
regard to ecclesiastical precedence.
The Methodist Church is not
strong. It came last into the field,
and does not seem to have struck
deep root. It has been mostly con-
ducted as a Home Mission station.
The present circuit- consists of Bac-
chus Marsh, Staughton Vale, and
Melton. Methodism in other parts
of the State is by no means deca-
dent, for in mining districts it is
particularly strong, and it is said to
have captured the Mallee.


The Baptist body, before it had a
sanctuary, used to worship in the
old Mechanics’ Institute, the first ser-
vice being held in 1867. The site
of the old church is just opposite
the Roman Catholic Presbytery,
where the remains of a baptismal
font still exist to mark the spot.
The land was the gift of Mr. Ed.
Waters, of the Patents Office, but it
has passed into the hands of the
Catholic Church. The old church
was built in 1868, and services were
conducted there until 189 8, when it
was shifted to its present position,
being rejuvenated by being adorned
with a handsome front of quite mo-
dern architectural design. The plan
of the building is very good. On
either side of the vestibule is a large
room, opening into the auditorium,
and so arranged that an overflow
can be accommodated and still be
part of the general congregation.
The foundation stone was laid by the
Rev. S. Chapman, of the Collins
street Baptist Church. The local
Baptist cause in the first instance
was a branch of the. Collins street
Church, and it remained in connec-
tion with that Church until the
early part of the pastorate of the-
Rev. James Martin, when it as-
sumed virile strength, and became
an independent body. The land of
the new Church was bought from
the late Mr. S. T. Staughton, M.L.A.
In the earlier days of the cause a
tower of strength was the late Mr.
G. G. Paterson, who frequently oc-
cupied the pulpit. During the his-
tory of the Church there have only
been four residential ministers
Revs. W. Jones, J. C. Martin, G. P.
Rees, and P. J. Masters. The value
of this Church property is £7 50, on
which not a penny is owing. Many
argue that an overdraft in Church
life promotes activity, but how such
bears upon spirituality it is hard
to define. There is also a manse
(£350). The Baptist folk are proud
of their organ, which cost £8 5 ; it
has been found most advantageous
in regard to recitals. To show spon-
taniety' of response, pledges to the
amount of £2OO, to run 10 years,
and undertaken by a number of
prominent adherents, was cleared off
in three years. Without belittling
the ministration of the different pas-
tors, the source of energy has been
undoubtedly Mr. T. G. Pearce. He
is a successful business man ; he has
worked up a flourishing business
concern, and that faculty for organ-
isation stimulated by religious con-
viction exercises itself signally for
the benefit of the cause with which
he has been for so many years iden-
tified. Mr. Pearce’s place would in
Baptist matters be hard to fill, and
such is the consensus of opinion of
his fellow-adherents. Mr. Pearce is
also a public man—Trustee of the
Mechanics’ Institute, Chairman of
Trustees of Maddingley Park, from
which position he has just recently
resigned, against the wishes of his
colleagues; a former President of
United Churches’ Literary and De-
bating Society, &c. He has not only
self-reliance upon the platform, but
he is a ready, strenuous speaker,
and apt at debate in practical mat-
ters, for which his long business ex-
perience has’ fitted him. Whatever
Mr, Pearce does he does well. He
has given some excellent lectures
from time to time, and has neither
spared time nor expense in procur-
ing illustrative material. His “even-
ings” on Shackleton’s experiences
in the Antarctic, and on the Pan-
ama Canal, will not readily be for-
gotten.
I take another communion. Go
where you will, the Scotchman holds
his own. In every centre the kirk
is substantial, probably ornamental,
its elders among the prominent cit-
izens of the locality. While Sandy
has business prudence and enter-
prise, and has a peculiar knack of
scooping in the coin, he never for-
gets the faith of his fathers. The
first placed Presbyterian minister
was the Rev. Alex. M’Nichol son of
Rev. A. M’Nichol, gave some inter-
esting particulars of his father’s
ministrations.
Mrs. Anderson, sen., described to
me the primitive character of the
first services. These were held in
Mr, James Young’s flour mill, which
until lately was the concentrated
milk factory of Mr. T. Anderson.
I asked whether there was any
Church furniture —the cocoanut aisle
carpet, the silver offertory plate, the
vestry with its mirror. There was
only a smile. “We all sat down on


the bags of grain scattered indis-
criminately around.” Are we the
more devout worshippers with cush-
ioned seat, choir stalls, and the peal-
ing anthem ? The first Presbyterian
Church was near Mr. Pearces’ dwel-
ling, and was afterwards acquired
by that gentleman. When the old
building was demolished by him,
an interesting document was taken
from the foundation-stone. It showed
that it was laid in 1853, when the
Rev. Mr. Scott was minister. The
old Church served till 1865, when
the present Church was opened. The
text of the document, still in a
wonderful state of preservation, is
worth quoting :—“The foundation-
stone of this Church was laid on
4th April, 1853. It was built by
voluntary subscription. The rule of
faith acknowledged the Scriptures
of the Old and New Testament, with
the longer and shorter Catechism.
The principle of constitution —that
members elect their own office-bear-
ers/ and have management of all
temporal affairs. All expenses are
defrayed by the free-will offerings
of the people. Trustees : Messrs. J.
Young, miller ; W. Grant, farmer ;
R. Kerr, storekeeper ; J. P. and H.
Jamieson, storekeepers ; J. Watson,
mason ; R. B. Scott, minister. There
is placed beside or with this paper
a gold nugget, one threepenny piece
of year 184 3,. one penny of year
184 6, given by Mrs. Young, R. 8.5.”
The nugget I am given to under-
stand, was the size of a pin’s head.
The present Church was opened un-
der the superintendence of the Rev.
J. Scott, of the United Presbyterian
Church of Scotland. He accepted a
call to Hobart in 1870, and was suc-
ceeded by Rev. Hugh M’Kail, who
on 27th October, 1873, was succeeded
by Rev. Geo. Graham. He held the
pastorate till 1878, accepting a call
elsewhere, being followed by Rev.
Hugh M’Farlane, up to 1883. The
next minister was the Rev. James
Mark Innes, who died in 1886.
The Rev. J. A. Stuart was inducted
on 15th July, 1887. Mr. Stuart was
formerly of Scots' Church, Soldiers’
Ballarat, from 1880-4. Mr. Stuart
was a typical Scotchman, with a
Scotchman’s predilection for hard
thinking, and erudition. As a nat-
uralist, he had done good work, so
much so that he had earned the
qualifications for the bestowal of
F.L.S. Mr. Stuart died in Sept.,
1905, after being in charge of the
Church here for 23 years.
The pastorate of the Rev. Benja-
min Williams commenced four years
ago, and it has been very successful.
True, there has been much accession
of population, but the addition of a
fine hall, costing something over
£SOO, and the general swing of
Church activity, prove that the pre-
sent • pastorate is making for solid
advance. The value of Church pro-
perty Is put down at anything over
£4,000.
The largest congregation in this
community is St. Bernard's. If the
Protestant churches have occasion
to complain of irregular attendance,
the Catholics never swerve in rigid
fidelity to their faith. Subtle forms
of rationalism and indifference do
not interfere with the Catholics'
reverential conception of the super-
natural.
Father Dunne was the first priest
who said Mass in the Marsh ; he was
afterwards Dean Dunne, of Albury.
He belonged to the Melbourne dio-
cese, and journeyed about the coun-
try in the fulfilment of his religious
duties. The first Mass was cele-
brated in the barn of Mr. Leahy,
Hopetoun. i Mrs. O’Connell, daughter
of the late Mr. Leahy, has dis-
tinct memory of many of those vis-
itations by different priests, and she
vividly ‘ recounts them. A little
church was afterwards built where
Hopetoun cemetery is situated, on
ground given by Mr. Leahy. There
were no buggies, &c., in those days.
Mrs. O’Connell can well remember
the Catholics coming from various
places—Coimadai, Maddingley, &c.
—in drays nicely painted, seated on
bags of straw; and the same .form
of conveyance served for worship-
pers of other churches. There were
few. Catholics then, and Mass was
said at first at intervals of three
months, then six weeks, and event-
ually three weeks. The church cost
£BOO, and was dedicated on 15th
Oct., 1850. Archdeacon Dowling
had occasionally visited the Marsh,
celebrating Mass at residence of Mr.
Leahy, and it was he who built the
church.


I find that the Keilor Mission in-
cluded Bacchus Marsh up to 1854,
when the latter was formed into a
separate mission under the charge
of the Rev. William Shinnick as its
first pastor.
The first Presbytery was a house
below the Woolpack, formerly occu-
pied by Mr. Ball, schoolmaster, and
later by Mr. Morrison, his successor.
It must be remembered that Hope-
toun in those days was a much more
flourishing place than to-day. Res-
idences were dotted all around, not
very pretentious, of course, for set-
tlement was then in its infancy.
The Rev. Eugene O’Connell was
the next resident priest. His devo-
tion to duty was untiring, and he
is held in grateful memory among
the older Catholics, His pastorate
covered an immense extent of coun-
try, including Daylesford. Before
his death, in 1871, he had erected a
larger church than that of 1850,
just behind where Mr. John Cun-
ningham now lives. I have read
some beautiful memorial verses ded-
icated to this priest, composed by
Mr. P. K. O’Hara, father of Mr. Jno
B. O’Hara, M.A., of South Mel-
bourne College, who has the repu-
tation of being of Australia’s
leading poets. Father O’Connell
must have been a singularly saintly
character, for I have learnt from old
inhabitants of other faiths that he
was revered by all.
The next priest was the Rev. T.
J. O’Callaghan, but he chose Gis-
borne as his headquarters, for the
very reason that the Marsh Catholic
was slow to build a presbytery, and
the Gisborne Catholic was corres-
pondingly quick. St. Bernard’s was
built during his pastorate, at a cost
of £4,000, and for a country church
it is an imposing structure, and its
appointments are in keeping with
the general character of the build-
ing. Situated on an eminence, it is
observable from all parts of the
Marsh. The foundation-stone was
laid in 1872 by Arch-bishop Goold,
and the church was opened in June,
187 4. Father O’Callaghan also built
in 1876-7 St. Dominic’s, at Melton,
costing £1,400. In Father O’Calla-
ghan’s time a Presbytery was built
at Darley, land granted by the Gov-
ernment for the purpose. The house
was recently bought by Mr. James
Taylor, of Darley.
In 187 5 Bacchus Marsh was
placed under the supervision of
Father Ellis, who resided at Gordon.
In 187 8 it was again granted a resi-
dent priest in the Rev. Wm. O’Brien.
In 188 6 Bacchus Marsh was re-
united with the Gordon parish
(Father Ryan), but in the same
year the Rev. D. Horan assumed
charge of the local church, and he
remained until his death in 1910, a
period of over 2 0 years. The rev.
gentleman did not let the grass grow
under his feet. He built the pres-
bytery (£1600), which was out of
debt before completed. An addition
to the Convent (£1,500) was uner-
taken, as well as a new church at
Mount Blackwood (£2,000). No less
an authority than the present Arch-
bishop has declared that this is the
most perfect church he has ever
visited in the country. Mount Black-
wood and Melton were under the
care of Father Horan and his cur-
ate.
Father Horan was held in respect
by all classes of the community.
That, was proved by the length of
the funeral procession. His acts of
benevolence, done unostentatiously,
were not confined to his own people.
Father Horan, driving his longest
distance, to Mount Blackwood, must
have felt on velvet in comparison
with those terrible journeys he had
to take in the earlier days ( of his
ministry when stationed at Sale.
There might be the sick call from
Walhalla, and despite 6 0 miles
mostly of unformed bush roads, the
last '3O miles being a mountainous
track, yet away through Maffra, Tin-
amba, Cowwarr, Toongabbie would
he speed on horseback, and thence
up and down precipitous slopes to
his destination, gnd if the weather
was inclement he would have to dis-
mount and lead his horse through
the gloom of night along the greasy
track, perhaps missing his way and
becoming stranded in a gully until
the morning light. How many fatal
accidents have happened on that
Walhalla road through coaches turn-
ing over, even since it has been
formed.
Father O’Rielly was the first cur-
ate to Father Horan and was gen-


erally esteemed. A farewell was
given' him, in which all sections of
the comunity took part. Father
T. F. O’Sullivan, another curate to
Father Horan, and his locum tenens
when he went on a visit to Ireland,
was very active, the Convent Ora-
tory, and the fine brick church at
Korobeit, being mainly due to his
efforts.
Father Ryan succeeded the Rev.
D. Horan at Bacchus Marsh, but
virtually he came to the locality to
die, as he was only in charge a
little over a year. He had effective
pulpit gift, and the wonder was that
with such power as a preacher he
should be taken from a city charge
to the country.
The present Parish Priest is
Father P. J. Gleeson, who is whole-
souled in the performance of his
sacred duties; having as curate.
Father Flannery. The former cur-
ate, Father Hayes, was a general
favorite, of fine physique, and much
musical capability.
The Bacchus Marsh mission has
had a splendid record, as statistics
up to date will show Churches,
£11,600 ; presbyteries, £2,200 ;
schools, £4,000; maintenance, £5,500.
Total, £23,300. Since the compila-
tion of these statistics, a big outlay
has been made on the Bacchus
Marsh Presbytery, which is a sub-
stantial two-storied building, and
has a fine appearance, in addition to
being commodious. Such figures
prove that the Catholic’s love for his
Church is not divorced from his poc-
ket.
The first Catholic school was held
in the little chapel, Hopetoun. The
first teacher, Mr. Berry, and others
followed. Settlement gradually mov-
ing up the Marsh, a school was built
at the back of Mr. John Cunning-
ham’s. Mr. Marshall, the teacher,
shifted his quarters from Hopetoun
to the new school, and his successor
was Mr, P. K. O’Hara. Mr. O’Hara
was very cultured, and he drew to-
gether a school of 120.
When the State school system was
established, the Catholic teacher of
the time, Mr. O’Brien became First
Assistant of the local State School.
The Catholic School eventually fell
into . the hands of lady teachers,
until finally it merged into the man-
agement of the Sisters of St. Joseph,
who for years, under the direction
of Sister Irene, achieved excellent
results ; and with new control is still
doing good work.
Undoubtedly the Catholic cause
is strong in this community. Two
Masses are said every Sunday, and
hundreds attend.
Mrs. O’Connell’s graphic picture
of the limited few, in painted drays,
traversing the ill-made roads or mak-
ing their way through boggy pad-
dock, to the little chapel of Hope-
toun, is in striking contrast to what
obtains at St. Bernard’s. There is
the constant succession of vehicles,
with every sign of prosperity, and
the motor car is also in evidence.
There is not the limited few wor-
shippers', but at termination of Mass,
out of the building surges a crowd.
I now turn to the Anglican
Church. I have had some little dif-
ficulty in getting at the early his-
tory. I am indebted to Mr. A. G.
Simon for a copy of the “Express”
of 9th June, 1877, which I glance
over with much interest. Therein is
given the account of the opening of
the present church ; but previously
there had been an old iron church,
and a Church of England place of
worship had existed from 1847. The
“old iron church” had become de-
crepit with age, and when one of
those strong winds came from Coorn-
mill, even as in the times of Job, it
laid lown “the tower” and the porch.
What a triumph of architecture must
have been “the tower” as appearing
above “the.old iron church!” I
should like to have seen that Catholic
Church of Blackwood, all made of
canvas, capable of holding 500, in
the times when Blackwood contain-
ed 20,000 souls, and was part of the
Bacchus Marsh mission.
It occurred to the local Anglican
body over 30 years ago, when the
comely "“tower” fell prone to the
earth, that the ark must be removed
from the threshing floor and placed
in the goodly temple. Hence the
graceful cathedral-in-embryo edifice
that crowns the slope. Archbishop
Clarke and Archdeacon Hindley have
publicly stated that this church sur-
passes anything of its kind in the
State. It is the embodiment of ec-
clesiastical feeling as proceeds from


“storied windows richly dight cast-
ing a dim religious light,” and other
appointments' that stimulate rever-
ence. A church may be brick and
mortar, but it was a noble conception
that God’s House should be regard-
ed as full of sacredness as God’s
Acre is full of pathos.
The Right Rev, Dr. Moorhouse
opened the new building. It is not
recorded, but probably with one of
those masterpieces of pulpit declar-
ation, such as was given in con-
nection with the “Galatian Lapse.”
The foundation-stone had been laid
by his predessor, Dr. Perry. The
project of building the church might
have slumbered many years had not
the late Mr. Shuter, P.M., pointed
out to the incumbent (Rev. A. J.
McCausland) that a grant of £4OO al-
lowed to the Bishop-in-Couneil would
have lapsed into the general funds
of the diocese and been divided with
the new diocese of Ballarat unless it
were claimed by July, 1876, by the
expenditure of £BOO upon a church
in Bacchus Marsh.
Mr. McCausland, so we are told,
mentioned the matter to some mem-
bers of the Church, and the late Mr.
Samuel Staughton, of Bynesbury,
first gave encouragement by donat-
ing £lO ; Cr. Molesworth Greene
and the late Sir W. J. Clarke, fol-
lowing with like amounts. The build-
ing of the church was let to Mr.
Jonathan Coulson, of Ballarat. A
peculiar incident occurred in connec-
tion with the laying of the founda-
tion-stone. As this had been laid by
Bishop Perry upon what was found
subsequently to be land granted by
the late Captain Bacchus for par-
sonage purposes, it was deemed expe-
dient to relay the stone upon church
lands, also granted by Capt. Bacchus,
and as the Melbourne diocese Was at
this time without a Bishop, the
building committee resolved to invite
the Bishop of Ballarat (Dr. Thorn-
ton) to relay the stone, which he did
on 20th May, 1876. I think I read
somewhere the mistake cost £220.
While to the activity of the Rev.
Mr. McCausland much was due in
securing the new church, still his two
predecessors, the Revs. J. Garliek
and W. H. Cooper (the latter now
Bishop of Grafton and Armadale)
had also done their share. At a
meeting held immediately after the
opening in the schoolroom, Cr.
Molesworth Greene stated that as a
balance of the £4OO was yet due, he
would give £SO, and there was the
same donation from Mr. Samuel and
Mr. Stephen Staughton. Mr. J. E.
Crook was the hon. Secretary of the
church building committee. Mr. A. C.
Simon gives particulars, the official
records being non est.
The “old iron church,” bricklined,
was built in 1855 at a cost of nearly
£IOO by Mr. W. Anderson. The Rev.
John Theophilus Schliecher was ap-
pointed minister for Bacchus Marsh
and Ballan on Ist October, 1856.
Ballan was made a separate charge in
1859. Mr. Schliecher left for New
South Wales in the early sixties. The
Revs. Cole, Wilkinson, Sabine, Coo-
per, Garliek, McCausland, Williams.
Shields, Gibbs, and Brewer follow-
ed. The original Trustees are record-
ed to have been Messrs. J. M. Mat-
son, H. A. M'Leod, W. H. Bacchus,
R. Pyke, and James Watt. The
total cost of new church was £2 414
7/3. The late Sir W. J. Clarke was
a liberal donor in money, and also
gave the pulpit, reading desk, &c.
Mrs. C. A. Brewer, wife of Rev.
Charles A. Brewer, M.A., through her
labors presented a brass lectern to
the church.
A commodious brick Parish hall has
been erected, and found useful in
many ways.
The rectory is a fine prperty, with
ample grounds. But the church has
a series of blocks stretching right
down to the main street, which must
become more and more valuable as
business sites as the community
grows, for where Grant street sweeps
round into Main street is regarded
as strategic from a business point of
view.
The present incumbent (Rev. T.
Wakelin Davis) has seen a fine bus-
iness place erected during his term,
costing something over £7 00, and it
is proving a profitable investment to
the church. The Rev. Mr. Davis is
an earnest worker, and the congre-
gation is increasing under his pastor-
ate.
The church outlook is particularly
roseate. It Just means that, in
years to come, in rental returns there
will be a splendid endowment, and


already is it suggested that the ser-
vices of a regular curate should be
secured. The number of adherents
of the local church should fill it
twice over, but the Anglican, while
sensitive to any doubt placed upon
his churchmanship, does not seem to
feel that attendance at the service is
compulsory. Probably he gives fin-
ancial support freely, but the sense
of responsibility appears to go no
further.
i look over a diary of 1865, of Mr.
James Elijah Crook, guide, phil-
osopher and friend to a large num-
ber of people ; and there was no
more earnest worker for the Church
of England here than this gentle-
man, owner of the Woolpack, and
later, Manor House. He had an ex-
tensive auctioneering business, and
the diary is full of notes on his fre-
quent journeys to Melbourne, and
to different parts of the district, not-
ably Ballan. I am amused to read
that a Bachelor’s ball was held at
the Woolpack, and if was a very fine
function. The diary is very inter-
esting, and on every Sunday is there
the record that church had been at-
tended morning and evening—“Went
to church, morning and evening, and
partook of the Sacrament on Lord s
Day,” Wherever located on the
Sabbath—Ballan, Melbourne or the
Marsh, his churchmanship always
led him to the services of his churcu.
I hoped that I would- have found
entries throwing light upon Anglican
doings in the Marsh in the sixties,
but I am disappointed.
Mr. Seton Williams, barrister, is
a son of the rev. Mr. Williams men-
tioned in the list of incumbents of
the church, and at one time there
was a lay reader, who had a most
eventful career, which will be
touched upon later.
A note in diary —“Went to church,
preacher Mr. Scott, lay reader.” Mr.
Scott was afterwards the notorious
“Captain Moonlight.”
I have before me the first minute
book of the Bacchus Marsh Protec-
tion and Reform League, the first
entry of which bears the date 10th
September, 1876. The book is in
a good state of preservation, and the
Penmanship, neatness, and general
arrangement, are creditable to the
Secretary of the time (Mr. T. An-
derson), who, judging by his organ-
ising ability, as evidenced in these
minutes, has not done himself jus-
tice in later years by hiding his light
under a bushel. Carefully made out
balance sheets, stamp accounts, &c.,
are interspersed throughout the
manuscript. I got possession through
the courtesy of Mr. Mark Kyle. Aye,
those were stirring times. There
were the reformers, Messrs. W. An-
derson and his son, T. Anderson, Cr.
W. H. M'Farlane, Watson, the Kyle
Brothers, H. Meikle, Forsyth, Thomas
Heath, Mathew Lindsay, Sloss, Low,
Reid, Cox, Murdoch, Cuthbertson,
and others, and there were the Con-
stitutionalists, Mr. Geo. Wood (store-
keeper), Mr. David Robertson, Cr.
George Dickie, James Elijah Crook,
Jeremiah Ryan, Walker Brothers, of
Greendale, and G. G. Paterson. Mr.
George Wood was a born leader, pos-
sessed of much ability, and any
amount of courage. In some pre-
served correspondence of Mr. Geo.
Wood to the “Argus” I admire his
vigorous style. He hits out. He
refers to the “meanness, hypocrisy,
cowardice, and dishonorable tactics”
of the other side. There is a min-
ute in the aforesaid book recording
communication from Mr. A. Deakin,
in which the following paragraph ap-
pears :—“As far as I can judge at
present, I shall remain outside the
political arena, and would, therefore,
urge upon you the necessity of en-
quiring in time who is likely to come
forward, &c.” In a letter to the
“Age” on 22nd December, 1879
(duly gummed in the book), Mr.
Deakin says : “The atmosphere of
discussion, both in Parliament and
out of it, is at present so thick and
turbid, and the decencies of debate
are so entirely neglected, that even
if the ends of party warfare were
more attractive than they are, the
means employed to get them partake
of a repellent character.” There was
no quarter asked for or given in
those days. Political feeling ran
high. Under the strain at meeting
the audience would surge forward,
lights were extinguished : one indi-
vidual got great satisfaction by forc-
ing the straw hat of an opponent
down on to his shoulders. The old
Mechanics’ Institute, erected in 185 8
(as it still indicates above its por-


tals) was the scene of many tumul-
tuous gatherings. Mr. Deakin, how-
ver, was not to be circumvented, so
he spoke from the top of a post. The
very post can be pointed out to this
day. The Reformers looked upon
the Constitutionalists as so much
impedimenta, delaying the progress
of humanity. The Constitutionalists
regarded the Reformers as insidious
advocates of spoliation. My old
friend, Mr. O’Hagan, with a most
humorous touch of Hibernian hyper-
bole, declared that during the period
in question “the hot place” was
empty, for all its inhabitants were
collected at the Marsh. To-day a
local political gathering is decorum
itself, and all those riotous upheav-
ings are conspicuous by their ab-
sence. Sweet reasonableness is
ever more effective than unreasoning
bias.
A profitable time may be spent
with this minute book, and I have
only one opinion, after a lengthy
perusual, that Mr. Thomas Ander-
son must have played a prominent
part in matters political of those
days. In short, that he was a born
fighter. I am given to understand
that he was only a stripling when
he was made Secretary of the Bac-
chus Marsh Protection and Reform
League. Of course the veteran Mr.
Mark Kyle (then in the hey-dey of
his strength) was a great force, and
apparently he only took second place
to his brother, Mr. A. Kyle ; and the
name Thomas Heath pops up here
and there as mover and seconder of
various motions. Mr. Heath is still
a politician.
I read the objects of the League.
One was that there should be a tax
on the National value of all land
over 6 40 acres of first-class land,
valued at £4 0 per acre ; 850 acres of
second class land, valued at £3 per
acre ; 1,2 50 acres of third class land,
valued at £2 per acre ; and 2,500
acres of fourth class land valued at
£1 per acre ; held in fee simple by
one or more individuals. To-day,
with the value which the Marsh has
attained, under what category would
it come ?
The League had an auspicious be-
ginning. At the first election the two
candidates it selected —Messrs. D.
Cameron and J. T. Smith were
elected. Some Mr. W. J. Lobb canje
under the castigation of the League
for the Secretary was instructed to
inform him that “he had treated
West Bourke in a most uncalled for
manner.’' This is only one of various
resolutions in which Messrs. Kyle, T.
Anderson, T. Heath, and the rest hit
out with vigor. In the first annual
report much pleasure is expressed
that the League had been instru-
mental in getting addresses deliver-
ed in the Mechanics’ Institute (now
Mr. D. Morton’s residence) by such
notabilities as Messrs. Graham Berry,
Peter Lalor (of Eureka Stockade
fame), J. Munro, and Rees, repre-
senting Grant. There is a good deal
of vim in that first annual report,
and finance was so good that a con-
siderable credit balance remained.
Verily, the League did not lack in
due knowledge of its status. In ima-
gination, I picture Messrs. Kyle, N.
Burt, Heath, W. Robertson, T. An-
derson, G. Marshall, A. Forsyth, E.
Sloss, W. Melkle, M. Lindsay and
the other members sitting in solemn
conclave, with all the earnestness of
a national deliberative assembly.
The League went properly to work,
There was no indifference to vital
public subject, as happens to-day,
but Messrs. Peter Murray, Jewell,
Marshall and T. Anderson were ap-
pointed a committee to draw up a
list of questions to be submitted to
candidates, and candidates evidently
in those days were as thick as leaves,
for a communication was read at a
meeting mentioning the names of
fifteen who were likely to contest the
electorate.
Great things are now to take place
in West Bourke. Mr. A. Deakin is
to be drawn from his Press obscur-
ity, and placed upon a pedestal of
greatness. He was absolutely un-
known. I will refer later to the call-
ing of Mr. Deakin, and deeply in-
teresting are those incidents which
served as the first steps in the
ladder of parliamentary distinction
of Australia’s greatest orator and
Imperialistic statesman.
The stock tax comes in for de-
bate but it is moved by Mr. W.
Anderson, seconded by Mr. Wm.
Lyle—“ That this League approves
of the continuation of the Tax upon
stoQk, and that the Chief Secretary


informed to that effect.” I like
that term “approves” immensely. It
is strongly reminiscent in a degree
of the three tailors of Tooley street,
“we, the people of England.”
I notice more than once in the
record that expenses of selected can-
didates should be paid, and in a
balance sheet such outlay is shown.
Evidently the political creed of the
League was serious enough to affect
the pocket. The Secretary reported
that several persons had left the
district, and that they might come
to vote if their expenses were paid.
It was unanimously agreed to pay
the railway fares. Messrs. Cox, W.
H. M'Farlane and Mark Kyle were
appointed a Committee to look after
refreshments on polling day. No
details were given as to type of re-
freshments. I must ask our old re-
peated townsman, Cr. W. H. Mac-
Farlane, whether he has any recol-
lection of the refreshments being
hot coffee.
Mr. T. Heath again. He moved
that Mr. Cameron, M.L.A., intro-
duce a bill into Parliament to abol-
ish plural voting.—Carried. Mr. W.
H. M'Farlane supported an increased
duty on oats and maize. Mr Wm.
H. M'Farlane was persistent in con-
nection therewith, for on various
occasions did he table motions to
above effect. Mr. Wm. Lyle was of
the opinion that the action of the
Government should be condemned
for delaying the opening of Parlia-
ment. The league you see covered
a good deal of territory in their de-
liberations. Mr. M. Lindsay gave
many cogent reasons why Mr. Wm.
Lyle was right, and the Government
wrong.
There was, as I have already said,
high feeling between the Constitu-
tionalists and the Reformers. I am
given to understand that, proceeding
to a political meeting at the old
Mechanics’ Institute, one party kept
one side of the street, and the other
Party the other, but matters got to
a white heat over alleged bribery
eases. It would have been a general
melee had parties got mixed up.
Mr. G. Wood was most militant. He
wrote two fiery letters to Melbourne
Press, copies of which are pasted on
the front cover of the book. The
following statement had appeared
in the “Age”—"Mr Thomas Ander-
son said he had a declaration
made by an elector of Bacchus
Marsh division to the effect that
he the elector had received £2 to
vote for Messrs. Staughton and Har-
per, and that he voted for them for
that consideration, and that another
elector had been offered £5 to vote
for Messrs. Staughton and Harper.”
A minute appears—“ That inasmuch
as Mr. Wood has. without cause,
publicly accused the members of the
League individually and collectively
of “meanness, hypocrisy, cowardice,
and dishonorable tactics,” that he
be no further recognised, unless he
apologises for the use of his insult-
ing language in the "Argus” and
the “Express,” and the Secretary be
requested to inform the Bacchus
Marsh Constitutional Union that de-
claration can be seen immediately
Mr. Wood publishes hi s apology.”
The solicitors of the League (Messrs.
M'Kean & Leonard) advised that no
legal action be taken. Mr. G. Wood
evidently according to minutes, had
the final shot —“ Mr. G. Wood wrote
that as the League refused to pub-
lish the names of the parties charged
with bribery and corruption, he was
instructed to receive no further cor-
respondence on the subject.”
Here is a sigulncant entry—Sat-
urday, 30th Oct., 1880—The Chair-
man (Mr. M. Kyle) congratulated
the members on the inclusion of the
Bacchus Marsh line in the Railway
Construction Bill. The League kept
its eye upon Mr. Deakin. The Sec-
retary was instructed to inform Mr.
Deakin “The League was of opinion
that he had committed an error of
judgment in failing to support the
Ministry.” Sir Bryan O’Loghlen,
too, gets into hot water. Moved by
Mr. C. Mahoney, seconded by Mr. M;
Lindsay—“ That this League con-
siders the action of Sir B. O’Logh-
len, in moving a vote of confidence
in the Government, meets with the
unqualified disapprobation of all
honest Liberals throughout West
Bourke.” Sir Bryan reigned as
head of a Government for some three
years thereupon, notwithstanding.
This finishes our review of the Min-
ute book. I have to run through the
line of parliamentary represen-
tatives, but the minute book only


gives partial information. Other
sources had to be probed.
I regret that the records of the
Bacchus Marsh Constitutional Un-
ion have vanished. It would be in-
teresting to have the presentment
of the case from the other side. I
have only one more comment. Time
works changes. Some of the mem-
bers of the Bacchus Marsh Protec-
tion and Reform League, who still
remain with us, are not to-day polit-
ically sailing in the same craft. It
was then Constitutionalist and Re-
former : it is now Liberal and Labor.
I have found considerable diffi-
culty in getting Information con-
cerning earliest parliamentary elec-
tions held in the locality. Probably
the population being limited, and
the franchise equally so, very little
interest was taken in the subject
of the representation of the district
in Parliament. The liberty of the
people was in embryonic state, but
eventually there was to be that on-
ward movement, as signified in Re-
form, and men began to value that
franchise which should be the right
of every individual.
After separation from N.S.W. in
1851, the Government of Victoria
was carried on by Legislative Coun-
cil till 1856. On 21st Nov. 1856,
the first Legislative Assembly met,
pursuant to proclamation by His Ex-
cellency the officer administering the
Government—Major-General Edward
Macarthur. Writs had been previ-
ously issued for election of members
to serve in the Legislative Assembly.
The electoral districts then number-
ed 37, returning in all 60 members.
The first representatives for West
Bourke electorate Were Patrick Phe-
lan and Robert McDougall.
Mr. Thos. Anderson can go back
to the candidature of Mr. Joseph
Wilkie for Legislative Council. Hus-
tings were erected in front of the
Wooipack, made of saplings and
wood, from which the candidate
spoke. Mr. Anderson remembers the
first election in Maddingley. It was
held in a calico tent, where Mr. J.
Daley now lives, and the Liberal
candidates were Messrs. Quarter-
man, Carr and Lalor. The first was
not successful, being defeated by
Mr. Geo. Cunningham, an iron-
monger of Geelong. The represen-
tatives of West Bourke in earlter
times were Messrs. M. L. King, J.
C. Riddell (father of Commissioner
Riddell, Chairman of the Metropol-
itan Board of Works) and Mr. J.
T. Smith, who was Mayor of Mel-
bourne for many years, and who has
gained undying fame as being the
first to import donkeys into the State.
Certain events make history. Mr.
J. T. Smith, member for West
Bourke, died, and Mr. Mark Kyle
and Mr. T. Anderson were instructed
to proceed to Melbourne by the local
Reform League to select a suitable
candidate. Mr. Willie Gaunson had
come up to the Marsh “on his own”
and delivered an address ; but the
local Reform League would not have
him. Mr. W. M. K. Yale was waited
upon, and, granted the Government
would support his candidature, he
was willing to stand. But Sir Bryan
O’Loghlen, who was the head of the
Government, said that the mountain
would have to come to Mahomet,
which Mr. Yale, high-spirited as he
was, was not disposed to do. Mr.
Kyle and Mr. Anderson then inter-
viewed Mr. David Syme. Mr, Syme
recommended Mr. Wrixon (after-
wards Sir Henry), but the deputation
found that he was not at home. They
returned to Mr. Syme, who then said
that he would not like to “see them
stuck,” and added that he had a
young man on his staff named
Deakin, but he would be very sorry
to lose him, as he had already made
his mark as a journalist. Still, for
party’s sake, Mr. Syme was prepared
to make the sacrifice. The deputa-
tion was then introduced to Mr.
Deakin. Mr. Kyle and Mr. Ander-
son, being Scotch, were cautious.
They asked Mr. Deakin what proof
could he give that he had oratori-
cal powers. Mr. Deakin referred
them to Mr. Windsor, who was then
editor of the “Age.” Mr. Windsor
was duly asked what sort of speaker
Mr. Deakin was. That gentleman’s
reply was that there was not a better
speaker in Melbourne.
The Bacchus Marsh deputation
were satisfied. 't’hey little knew
their voice was to be the great
Federal leader —one who would move
nobles and statesmen in the great
ancient halls of the nation with his
oratory-—the Demosthenes of pictur-


esque fluency, the Cicero of forensic
declamation. Edmund Burke’s
stilted ornate periods only resulted
in his becoming “the dinner bell of
the House,” but there was a rush
to hear, when the word went round
that “Deakin” —as was said of Ma-
caulay—“was on his feet.” Mr.
Wind f or accompanied our Bacchus
Marsh deputation to Sir Bryan. Sh
Bryan was asked what the Govern-
ment intended to do in the matter
He said that it was resolved to leave
the selection in the hands of the
Reform League. The nominations
for West Bourke were taken that
night. Mr. James Mirams was in
the chair, and there were also pro-
sent Mr. James Munro and Mr.
James Patterson (afterwards Sir
James). The nominations were—W.
Stutt (in early days member for
South Grant), Fisher, Dr. Knaggs,
J. J. Walsh, Zevenboom, and A.
Deakin, “who was proposed and se-
conded” by the said Insistent depu-
tation. Cries came from all sides,
“Who is Deakin ?” It was suggested,
that Mr. Deakin’s name should be
withdrawn : evidently politically he
was a nonentity. But our worthy
deputation kept the bit within their
teeth. It was pointed out that
Barry’s Reef (then populous) and
Gisborne would act in conjunction
with the Marsh, and (using the depu-
tation’s words) “as we had a stiff
battle to fight, we were prepared to
go on with it.” The meeting lasted
from 8 to 12 o’clock, and the final
result was that the matter was left
in the hands of Reform committees
of West Bourke. Mr. Deakin that
night sent a short advertisement to
“The Ballarat Courier” announcing
his candidature, and the next night
he proceeded to Flemington to de-
liver his opening speech. By arrange-
ment, Mr. J. B. Patterson occupied
a seat on the platform. Mr. T. An-
derson adds : “I saw Mr. J. B. Pat-
terson on the following Wednesday,
and I asked what he thought of Dea-
kin, and he replied that when Mr.
Deakin had finished his speech, he
said, “I’ll be god-father to you
whether the Ministry go for you or
not.” Bacchus Marsh may well be
called the political birthplace of Mr.
Deakin.
The Marsh also had as one of its
representatives as portion of West
Bourke a rising barrister, now Sir
John Madden, Chief Justice and
Lieutenant-Governor, who, too, has
remarkable fluency and elegance of
phrase, not to speak of the faculty
of saying the most appropriate thing
at the most appropriate time. Sir
John is an undoubted factor in the
life of the State. He is intensely
popular, and has earned his emin-
ence by merit.
The constituencies of Grant and
West Bourke were separated by the
Werribee. Over the river as a rep-
resentative was Peter Lalor, of strik-
ing personality. From Eureka
Stockade to Speaker of the House of
Assembly ; from felon to First Com-
moner in the land, was a remarkable
crescendo movement ; but Peter
Lalor accomplished it, and to-day his
framed photo in our Shire Hall re-
minds the Marsh that wonderful has
been its history when it has been
honored by having such a represen-
tative as good old Peter Lalor, the
man who stood up against oppres-
sion.
Another who courted the favor of
the Marsh as part of West Bourke
was Sir Bryan O’Loghlen. When Sir
Bryan on one memorable occasion
assumed Premiership all the Press
and country laughed at him, but the
fact that ne retained hold of the
helm for three years or more prov-
ed that he had more prescience than
those whose mirth was so pronounc-
ed. I also should refer to Mr. R.
Harper, who had such severe tussles
with Mr. Deakin. The Harper fam-
ily are talented. Professor A. Har-
per is admitted to be the greatest
Hebrew scholar south of the Line.
Mr. R. Harper, argumentative, a
powerful platform speaker, tenacious,
was a fitting antagonist for Mr. Dea-
kin, and certainly held his own. What
other constituency has had such an
array of legislative giants ?
In later days, for a lengthened
period, right up to the time of his
death, Mr. S. T. Staughton possessed
the confidence of the electors. He
donated without any personal gain
a large portion of land for railway
purposes. He gave to the A.N.A.
the block on which their fine hall
stands, the clock tower of the post-
office. He erected the memorial


fountain in Main street. It would
not be out of place here to note
other public benefactors —the late
Mr. Isaac Evans, who gave the large
pavilion to Maddingley Park ; Mr.
A. D. Hodgson, who presented the
ornamental fountain in the same
park; and the family of the late Mr.
Geo. Dickie, who gave the band ro-
tunda, which so graces our popular
resort. I remember well an incident
which illustrates the large-hearted-
ness of the late Mr. S. T. Staughton.
When Mr. Trenwith, the then Labor
leader —later Senator Trenwith —be-
came afflicted with some growth in
his sight, political opponent as Mr.
Staughton w T as, he initiated a sub-
scription list to raise funds to en-
able Mr. Trenwith to proceed to Lon-
don to get skilled assistance, and he
himself gave a donation of £2 5.
Capt. S. Tom Staughton, A.D.C.,
D. 5.0., the first to volunteer for First
Y.M.R. Contingent to South Africa,
succeeded his father in the repre-
sentation of this district. Elected
twice to Parliament without opposi-
tion, the young member’s career was
cut short by appendicitis.
I should refer to a local produc-
tion —the late Mr. Geo. T. Dickie,
M.L.C. Never was there a more
popular victory when he was return-
ed. He was a singularly beautiful
nature, and there was the possession
of much natural ability, but alas, he
was physically not strong, and death
claimed a victim mid the deepest
sorrow of the whole community. Mr.
Dickie’s father was a great fighter
in politics, and, with the assistance
of the then member for Grant (Mr.
Geo. Cunningham) he was instru-
mental in having the Maddingley
Park rescued .from the 42nd clause
marauders of the sixties. The pre-
sent member for the Assembly (Hon.
A. R. Robertson) and the late Mr. G.
T. Dickie, received their education
in the State school No. 2 8, as did Mr.
John Bowser, M.L.A. Mr. Robertson
has done well ; he is recognised as
one of the leaders of the Country
Party. He held a portfolio without
salary, and it was his misfortune that
Sir Thos. Bent should be defeated, as
he was about to take full Ministerial
responsibility.
But this record of Bacchus Marsh
would he incomplete if special re-
ference were not made to Mr. Mark
Kyle, who once opposed Mr. S. T.
Staughton, but was unsuccessful. A
politician to the backbone, the old
veteran still lives to discourse upon
the state of the political atmosphere.
Politics are not to him so much by-
play, but he views legislative doings
with all absorbing earnestness, and
it is his firm opinion that every man
should have definite judgment on
the questions of the day. He is a
ready speaker, particularly apt in
debate, and full of information on
measures that have come under the
cognizance of Parliament. But his
entry into the House was not to be,
and he is too balanced to groan at
the dispensation.
One would have thought that
Bacchus Marsh would have had a
plethora of bushranging incident, as
it is located fairly half-way—and
on the main road—between Mel-
bourne and Ballarat, in the days
when gold diggers were returning
to or visiting the city with a good
quantity of gold in their belts.
These highwaymen were plentiful
enough in different parts of the
colony, but the road from Ballarat
to Melbourne evidently was in a
great degree immune. Bushranger
Burke was captured not a great dis-
tance from Melbourne.
Anthony’s cutting (or rather the
hill where Anthony’s cutting now is)
would have been an ideal place for
the command to be given to “stand
and deliver.’’ Mr. W. Kerr, of
Parwan, pointed out to me a parti-
cular gully in his neighbourhood
where gentry of the sort used to
hide, and an effectual hiding place
it should have formed, but I get no
definite data as to any “sticking up.’’
It was the custom of many travelling
to or from Ballarat to keep to the
top of the plateau, thus avoiding the
boggy road of the Marsh, and pos-
sibly there were many instances of
minor kinds of theft, but Mr. Kerr
could not describe any encounters
where the coach was bailed up by the
picturesque gentleman on horseback,
who gracefully bowed to the ladies
and relieved all the passengers of
their purses.
The average Australian bushran-
ger was a villainous looking fellow;
not a gallant Robin Hood, a cour-


teous Dick Turpin, or a highbred
Paul Clifford. The Australian bush-
ranger was generally low-down
careless as to whether he shed blood
or no. Captain Starlight must have
been an exception ; anyhow his con-
freres were bad enough.
Mr. Con. Mahoney describes an in-
cident. He was just arriving at the
Marsh ; there were only four dwel-
lings then. As he came over the
hill at the lower end of the Marsh
he states he saw four fellows lying
down in the bushes with their guns
covering the -road, Mr. Mahoney
proceeded along ; he was on foot.
He expected every moment he would
be challenged, but strange to say he
was allowed to pass. As he was
crossing over the creek he was ac-
costed by a horseman, well mounted
and armed, and wearing a silk hat.
Mr. Mahoney had his suspicions, and
kept his gun in hand ready for- any
emergency. Conversation took place,
but Mr. Mahoney was determined
that the stranger should not get be-
hind him. “At last,” said the old
hero, “I told Mr. Bushranger if he
did not clear I would put daylight
through him.” The knight of the
road disappeared. Mr. Mahoney was
quite satisfied that it, was Captain
Melville, but I have asked old in-
habitants if they remember the re-
doubtable knight of the road ever
having been so near to Bacchus
Marsh, and they state they do not.
What makes me feel that Mr. Ma-
honey must have been mistaken is
that Melville’s scene of operations
was confined to another part of the
State. For example, in the granite
hills near Kingower there is an open-
ing in the rocks which is called “Mel-
ville’s kitchen,” where he used to
find shelter for himself and his
horse. The humor in Mr. Con.
Mahoney’s case to me is that possibly
when the stranger galloped away he
may have imagined that Mr. Ma-
honey, with his finger on the trig-
ger, was the bushranger.
It was related by one person (de-
pending more upon an exuberant
imagination than-upon stern fact)
that Power and Ned Kelly once
passed through the Marsh, boiling
their billy at Edwards’ forge. This
great historical event seems to be on
all fours with the educational at-
tainments of the individual who de-
clared that he had gone through col-
lege ; that is, he had passed in at
one door and came out at another.
A lady relates that as children they
were greatly excited on one occasion
seeing one of the gold escort return-
ing all torn and bleeding from a
rough and tumble with the footpads
in the Pentland Hills. Mr, Hy. Hodg-
son, one of our oldest residents, has
no memory of anything thrilling ever
done in the bushranging line,
nor has another old resident, Mr.
Martin Cosgrove. Mr. Hodgson says
that it was the gold escort from Ben-
digo which was so frequently attack-
ed.
Mr, Donald,-of Yaloak-Vale, whom
I met by chance, gave an account of
the tragedy at Ingliston. It appears
that Mr. Henry Densley, now of Dal-
ian, and Mr. W. Thomson, of Pykes’
Creek, called at the hut of a shep-
herd, by name Pierpoint, on the Ing-
liston Estate. Finding the door fas-
tened on the inside, Densley climbed
down through the chimney, and as
he was pulling aside the bag screen
which separated one room from the
other, a bushranger sprang out and
made a savage blow at him with a
knife, also, I believe, using a revol-
ver. A terrible struggle took place,
with the result that, though Densley
had received many stabs, his super-
ior strength was too much for the
other. Mr. Donald’s words were that
the bushranger was nearly half kill-
ed. Mr, Henry Densley, of the
Marsh, tells me that his uncle, who
was 16 to 17 stone weight, nearly
strangled his assailant. The bush-
ranger was brought out to recover,
and seated on a log. . Mr. Densley
leaving Thomson, armed with a gun,
in charge, set out to Ballan for po-
lice assistance. The account of sub-
sequent events given me is that the
bushranger attempted to move from
the log towards a tree, possibly with
a view of escaping, and Thomson
fired at him. When the police ar-
rived he was dead. Densley lost
much blood, and suffered consider-
ably, but the district showed their
appreciation of his bravery by pre-
senting him with a gold watch and
handsome cheque. A trial, of course,
followed, but the verdict brought in
was “Justifiable homicide.’’


I referred in a previous number
to the lay reader of the Church of
England, whose life reads like a
romance, but so deplorably dramatic.
From holy calling to scaffold is a
fearful descent, and Scott trod the
fearful road. He was in every way
intelligent, gave every evidence of
good breeding, had fair pulpit and
lecturing ability. Indeed, he was
one of the forerunners of local irri-
gation, having delivered a lecture
on the necessity for the same in the
old Mechanics’ Institute. He had
been educated as an engineer. Scott,
prior to his residing here, had had
a very eventful career, having passed
through the Maori war, receiving
many gunshot wounds in his legs,
which made him lame. He always
seemed interested in weapons. He
carried a sheath knife, and was con-
stantly practising with pistols. Still,
nothing untoward was noticed in his
conduct, and apparently he dischar-
ged his religious duties conscienti-
ously. My old Hibernian friend
tells me that he often chatted with
the man, and, to use his words, “I
loved him.” Mr, Hilton indicated
the very bedroom which Scott occu-
pied, and the general testimony is
that he was a fine fellow. But still,
there must have been an ugly trait
in his nature, and the question may
well be asked, “was he only adopt-
ing religion as a covering to carry
out infamous purpose ?” I am told
that there had been some cattle duf-
fing in the locality, and with some
he was not without suspicion.
Plausibility has often been inter-
preted as goodness. The Egerton
bank robbery (in which Scott was
afterwards concerned) proved that
he had all the cunning of a clever
criminal. Details might be supplied,
but space will not permit. I have
been frequently told that Captain
Moonlight was really the basis for
the conception of Rolfe Boldrewood’s
Captain Starlight. I communicated
with Mr. Molesworth Greene of
Greystones (who is a relative of
Rolfe Boldrewood) and he courte-
ously forwards the reply from the
author himself : —“ ‘Captain Moon-
light Scott has no connection with
‘Starlight’ : that character was only
a type, not founded on any one in-
dividual.”
Scott was charged with the Eger-
ton bank robbery, but was acquitted.
He proceeded to Sydney, stopping
for a time at the Woolpack before
he did so, but growing careless he
displayed some of the bank gold. In
the second trial he was found
guilty. He served a sentence. When
he came out of gaol he lectured in
several centres, but gradually worked
into the bushranging life of New
South Wales, and taking life was
found guilty, and executed. He had
developed into the notorious Captain
Moonlight. Many lengthy sketches
of Moonlight’s career are to be
found, but undoubtedly his amiable
manner during his sojourn in the
Marsh won him many friends, who
sincerely expressed pity at such a
tragic culmination to a life that
might have been so useful.
A valuable record has come to
hand. I have to thank Miss Mahoney.
All will agree with that lady that the
doings of the pioneers who founded
a community should not pass into
the limbo of forgetfulness. The
Minute Book of the First Road
Board of Bacchus Marsh is bulky,
but it is wonderfully preserved. A
public meeting was held at the Bor-
der Inn on 6th Nov., 1856. It was
convened by the Stipendiary Magis-
trate, Mr. Shuter. Mr. James Young
was voted to the chair. After leng-
thy perusal, I have come to the
conclusion, that Mr. J. Young was a
most important factor in early Bac-
chus Marsh life. It was determined
that nine should be elected by the
ratepayers present to serve as mem-
bers of the Board for twelve months.
Those who were successful were
Messrs. James M. Matson, Henry
James, James Watt, Robert Pyke,
James Crook, James Young, James
Gordon, Robert Aitken and William
Grant. Mr. James Young was ap-
pointed chairman, but only on cast-
ing vote, his competitor being Mr.
James Gordon. This gentleman was
elected Treasurer. The salary of
Secretary was fixed at £2 50. Appli-
cation was immediately made for
£50,000 from the Central Road
Board, so as to make and repair road
between Melton and East Ballan, and
Messrs. Phelan & M’Dougall, Parlia-
mentary representatives, were re-
quested to support the application.


There were 3 3 applicants for post of
Secretary. Mr. Thomson being ap-
pointed. What was wrong with this
gentleman is not stated, but at one of
the earliest meetings on motion of
Messrs. Watt and Pyke, it was car-
ried that his services be dispensed
with, in consequence of his having
absented himself, without the sanc-
tion of the Board. An account was
opened with the English, Scottish and
Australian Chartered Bank. Captain
Clarke and Captain Pasley were
thanked for the very efficient man-
ner in which they have discharged
their duties. Unfortunately, those
duties are not specified. Mr. Mor-
dannt Maclean was appointed secre-
tary and Collector. It was resolved
that notices be put up in the Marsh,
Ballan and Melton calling for appli-
cations for Assessor and Valuator to
the Board, to be remunerated at rate
of 3 0/ per day for each day employ-
ed. What can be a more interesting
local historical relic than the report
of the committee appointed to in-
spect the road through Bacchus
Marsh. I abbreviate ; 1. That the
whole of the road, comprising 17 8
chains, commencing from Mr, Grant’s
slip-panel on the hill upon the wes-
tern side, to Mr. James’ boundary
fence upon the eastern, be immedi-
ately formed by cutting a drain on
each side, and raising centre so as
to render it in a fit state to lay
metal upon afterwards. 2. That
from.the last-named boundary to Mr.
Leohey’s paddock fences (where
road has been made) some repairs
are required, to be done as piece
work. 3. That the top of the hill
beyond the last-mentioned place (Mr.
Leahey’s fence) may be attained at
a distance of 36 chains by cutting a
road in the gully above the present
way very lately made by the Messrs.
Aitken, which would effect a saving
of upwards of half-a-mile in dis-
tance contrasted with the road now
used round the point of the hill. The
report added that present road was
not passable during winter. Mr.
Greenhill was appointed Assessor.
On 21st May, 1857, tenders were
called for forming road through
Bacchus Marsh. Mr. Watt moved,
and Mr. Aitken seconded, that a four
feet footpath be left on each side
nearest the fences, then a four feet
ditch two feet deep, the road to be
raised for 22-ft. in centre by the
stuff taken from the ditches, and
also from the side of the road near-
est to ditches to the extent of twelve
inches. Carried. Thus did our main
highway get its origin. Those fore-
fathers had shortness of vision. They
did not know that the Marsh was to
become an important business centre,
and it would have been well had that
footpath been twice as wide.
The Read Board had held its
meetings at the Border Inn, but Mr.
Young offered an office, which was
taken at rental of £2 6 per annum.
Mr. David Anderson’s tender for
road through Bacchus Marsh was
accepted. Forming road, per chain,
£2/17/6. ; cutting all necessary side
and outlet drains, per chain, £l/5/ ;
trimmed at per cubic yard, 8/; mov-
ing earth form hill, and forming
road on flat, per cubic yard, 2/7.
The assessors were instructed to
commence assessing lands, mess-
uages and tenements as follows :
One farthing per acre on unalienated
Crown lands ; one penny per acre on
cultivated lands ; one shillings per
acre, and one shilling in the £, on
actual annual rental, or valued an-
nual rental of messuages, tenements
and dwelling houses. It was resolved
to hold meetings each alternate Sat-
urday at 3 p.m. The Board needed
£2OO to defray current expenses.
The English, Scottish and Australian
Bank would not recognise a £2OO
promissory note, signed by members
of the Board, and it was duly passed
that the account with this bank be
closed, and one opened with Bank of
N.S. Wales, a promissory note for
£3OO being accepted. An amount
(£1242/3/9) certified by Mr. En-
gineer Penell, was paid Mr. David
Anderson for Bacchus Marsh road
contract. Mr. Inspecting Overseer
Lane was paid £l2/9/. There was
no “Express” then, for T. B. Frank-
lin’s account of £6/15/ for printing
was passed. Another instalment of
£2,000 was paid to Mr. David Ander-
son, on recommendation of Mr. Pen-
ell, engineer. The first dayman was
Robert Clarke, who was engaged at
the rate of £3 per week, to rake the
grave! and keep the road in repair,
and Alexander M'Kenzie to assist, at
the same rate.


There were complications in
connection with the road contract,
and three or four pages of the book
record evidence, reports, and minutes
of meetings in connection therewith.
Evidently, the matter was regarded
as serious. It appears that as In-
specting overseer Lane, Mr. D. An-
derson, and the timekeeper, were
measuring heaps of gravel, the over-
seer detected the last-named holding
two or three feet of end of tape in
his hand. He charged him with
fraud. The excuse given by the
timekeeper was that he had a bad
hand, and could not hold the ring.
A statement is signed by Mr. D. An-
derson that if anything had been
done wrong it was contrary to his
wishes, and that he had discharged
the employe on account of the tran-
saction. The gravel was remeasured,
and a discrepancy of 40 cubic yards
found for the first mile of road from
the commencement of Leahey’s fence.
The full deficiency was estimated at
1910 yards. A deduction of £7 5 was
made, and Mr. D. Anderson was paid
£4,966/17/6 altogether.
Mr. D. Syme’s tender (£195) for
erection of two bridges, one across
the “Toolam Toolern/ creek, and the
other across Parwan creek, were ac-
cepted, 27th June, 1857. Mr. Syme
evidently did not carry out this work,
as Mr. W. Anderson tendered after-
wards for same at £2 8 9, and he erect-
ed the bridges. At three meetings Mr.
W. Anderson’s claim for travelling
expenses was considered, but was not
entertained. Meetings 31st October
and 6th November, 1857, lapsed—no
quorum. The annual election of
Board took place 6th November,
1857, that is, one year has passed
since inception of the Board. A
great number were nominated. I
notice that the recorder uses the
word “elected,” but a ballot took
place, and ■ the following were elect-
ed :—-Messrs. Young, 75 votes ; Mat-
son, 6 2 ; Meikle, 5 8 ; Watt, 56 ;
Crook, 50 ; James, 47 ; Aitken, 45 ;
Grant, 4 3 ; and Mahoney, 34. Messrs.
Pyke, Muirs, Kerr, Brown, Sweet-
apple, Marsh, and Main were rejected.
Messrs. Kenneth & Lord were paid
five guineas for auditing accounts of
Board. They were the first auditors.
One of the New Board Mr. J. Watt
was elected Chairman, and Mr.
James Elijah Crook, Treasurer. In
connection with the Parliamentary
grant to Road Board (£5,500) for
1857, a balance of £4O/18/2 re-
mained. Assessment rates for same
period brought in £638/19/1. The
new Board of 185 8 has to express its
astonishment and regret that such a
small sum (not given) was placed on
estimates by Parliament for current
year. The minute is voluminous.
Inter alia it was stated that district
of Bacchus Marsh would produce
2 00,000 bushels of wheat, and pro-
portionate quantity of oats and bar-
ley, sufficient to supply the whole
colony of Victoria for one month.
The minute is vigorously worded —a
reflex of the progressive spirit of the
Board. Objection was not taken to
money being spent on Bendigo and
Geelong roads, but why neglect that
to Ballarat ?
Things were not pleasant in those
days with farmers beyond the “Ler-
derdearg” river. It was passed that
Secretary communicate with proper
authorities for surveying of a road,
as the farmers beyond the “Lerder-
dearg” were unable to obtain the
use of a machine to thresh their
corn, or to remove any produce to
market. The Secretary was directed
to learn whether money voted for
roads in Bacchus Marsh district was
available, as it was urgently re-
quired ; for proof, the late accident
at Djerriwarrh Creek. The. particu-
lar nature of accident was not re-
vealed. Meetings 13th Feb., 1858,
2 7th Feb., 13th March, lapsed—no
quorum. The Board takes a firm
stand, for it was resolved that the
Board inform President of Land and
Works, in reply to his communica-
tion, that it declines to admit the
principle that it should pay compen-
sation for any road that is absolutely
necessary to enable purchasers to get
on their land, the road that has been
laid out by Government.
Messrs. Phelan and Wilkie,
M’s.L.A., were urged to draw atten-
tion of President of Board of Land
and Works to the necessity of com-
pleting that portion of the main road
from Melbourne to Ballarat, com-
mencing at a point being the term-
ination of a macadamized road al-
ready made over Pyke’s Hill, to the
I Werribee bridge, passing through


East Ballan; and also calling his at-
tention to the state of the road on
Pyke’s Hill, Stamford Hill, and Djer-
riwarrh Creek. If to-day the roads
in our vicinity are comfortable for
transit, it is due to the watchfulness
of these earlier inhabitants, who
mostly have passed away. A road
across the “Lerderdearg,” through
Mr. Joseph B. Perry’s land, is pro-
claimed. Mr. James Partridge is
appointed the first bailiff to the Bac-
chus Marsh Road Board. Tenders
are called for supplying gravel on
main road, from Grant’s gate to top
of Stamford Hill. I notice it is now
“Grant’s gate,” not “Grant’s slip-
panel.” Civilisation is increasing.
Side streets are now to be looked to.
The first, Young street, from the
main line of road near Breen’s store.
This detail had to be given, for evi-
dently the exact whereabouts of
Young street was not generally
known. Further civilisation. Two
carts were hired from Mr. W. An-
derson, and one from Mr. W. Mur-
doch, to draw earth from the rear
of Cr. Crook’s property, at the rate
of £l/2/6 per diem, to the road near
Mr. Bence’s shop, to form footpaths.
Roads Board Minutes.
Valuable Records Destroyed.
Now we enter on something par-
ticularly interesting. A communi-
cation was received from the Com-
missioner of Roads and Bridges, re-
lative to establishing tolls in the dis- ■
trict. The Road Board did not con-
sider it advisable to erect tolls on
the road from Melbourne to Ballarat,
through Bacchus Marsh, until the
Djerriwarrh approach to the Pent-
land Hills and Pyke’s Creek be made
passable fc T traffic. The Standing
Road Committee was requested to
arrange with the contractor for the
removal of a gum tree on the “Gis-
bourne” and Geelong road, on the
north side of the Werribee river,
near Maddingley bridge. Tenders
were called for bridge across “Kor-
obeit” creek. Messrs. John Brown
and John Martin were successful, at
£2 80. The Secretary was instructed
to write to President of Land and
Works requesting that the road from
Keilor to Ballarat, via Melton, Bac-
chus Marsh and Ballan be proclaim-
ed. Tenders were called for erection
of a bridge across “Lerderdearg” ri-
ver, near the National school, upon
the land of Mr. H. James. A special
committee had been appointed to in-
spect road over Pentland Hills. A
petition from Pentland Hills comes
in, but could not be entertained un-
til such times as Messrs. Robertson
and Evans granted permission to
make the road through their lands.
Carried that road passing through
Mr. M'Laughlin’s land, to the main
Ballarat road, be recommended. The
specifications of the “Lerderdearg”
river bridge appear in full. The
erection of bridge was delayed on
account of great difference of opin-
ion among concerned ratepayers. The
state of the Ballarat and Melbourne
[ road was such that it was considered
imperative that there should be an
outlay of £50,000. A great battle
was proceeding over Lerderdearg
bridge, Mr. James Young has a
strong protest entered in minutes.
Mr. Connell received a written docu-
ment from the Board, addressed to
Government, representing the neces-
sity for opening the road surveyed,
leading to Ballarat road through
Messrs. Clarke, Atkinson, Crook,
Scott and Crook’s properties, being
the Geelong road to the Marsh, and
that the Chairman be requested to
desire Mr. W. Anderson to open the
road immediately. That is the way
the road that swings round the
Woolpack came into being. Battle
over Lerderdearg bridge still pro-
ceeding, and vigorously at that. Mr.
D. Anderson’s tender, for £236, fin-
ally accepted ; the other tender,
£9OO, that of Mr. J. T. Taylor. A
protest was lodged by members of
Board, Messrs. Hugh Meikle, C.
Mahoney, James Watt, and Henry
Jabes, that assessments for 1857-8
were illegal, never having been
agreed to by the ratepayers, as re-
quired by the Act. Great row over
minutes, and Chairman was compell-
ed, at point of bayonet, to sign with
certain exception. Probably, a pro-
verbial “storm in a teacup.” It is un-
fortunate there is no record from
185 8-63. No reason is given for
such omission, but a note appears on


one of the otherwise blank pages,
and the writing is infirm; '‘Complete
blank from 23rd October, 1858, to
2 sth July, 1863, because of disagree-
ment twixt wire-drawers ; no discip-
line. All further records of the old
Road Board from the above date,
23rd Oct., 1858, to 28th July, 1863,
burked by interested persons having
access to the books, so as to conceal
political Knavery.” Signed by “One
who knows.” The minutes record-
ing the doings of 1857-5 8 are splen-
didly written up ; they give all in-
formation ; but from 186 3 to *65 the
scanning is unsatisfactory, as there
is neither legible penmanship nor
orderly arrangement. The minutes
are bare ; in the earlier part of book
they were informative. I cannot
withhold expression of the great dis-
appointment I felt when I came
across this great gap, as undoubtedly
from 1858-63 was a constructive
period of Bacchus Marsh history.
That five years must have caused a
change in personnel of the Board. I
find in first minutes of meeting held
23rd Sept., 1863, that members pre-
sent were Messrs. James Young, Jer-
emiah Ryan, William Grant, Robert
Lawson, George Grant, John Myers,
Robert Grant, James Elijah Crook,
and David Lindsay. The Bank of
New South Wales is no longer recog-
nised by the Board, for I find ar-
rangements being made with Nation-
al Bank of Australia, Bacchus Marsh,
for overdraft. Previously reference
was made to correspondence re tolls.
It was moved by Mr. Crook, second-
ed by Mr. Lindsay, that the toll near
Djcrriwarrh creek is felt to be a seri-
ous tax upon the agricultural inter-
ests of the district, that already the
farmers pay a fair tax for the mak-
ing and maintenance of road, which
the said toll is upon, by the rates im-
posed by the Board, and so on, spe-
cial mention being made of prohibi-
tive charge on bullock team ; but an
amendment was moved by Mr. Law-
son, seconded by Mr, Grant, that the
toll be removed altogether. Amend-
ment carried. A special minute is
made in connection with Mr. James
Elijah Crook for meritorious ser-
vices rendered. A bonus to Secre-
tary ; he is allowed one shilling per
head for all dogs registered. Dog
Act must have been passed at this
time. A Mr. Stanfield has appeared
on the scene as Engineer. 6th Aug*
186 4, tenders were called for clear-
ing of road from Maddingley town-
ship to cemetery. In accordance
with the provisions of the Local Go-
vernment Act, steps were taken to
effect an equitable division of the
Bacchus Marsh and Maddingley Road
District into three several electoral
divisions.. Mr, Young retires, and
there is a minute recognising his
long and faithful services. A depu-
tation from Melton Road Board
having waited upon the B.M. Board,
and proposed that the local Board
should be apportioned one-fourth of
money collected from Djerriwarrh
toll, a motion was carried that the
Bacchus Marsh Board was justly en-
titled to one-half of the toll. Toll
question still to. the front. Messrs.
Ryan, Grant, and Meikle were ap-
pointed a deputation to wait upon
the Minister of Roads and Railways
with reference to the proposed toll
at the Keilor Road Railway station,
and that these gentlemen be allowed
£1 each for travelling expenses. The
deputation reported later that toll
had been proclaimed, • and Govern-
ment had not power of causing its
removal. A public meeting was call-
ed of the merchants, tradesmen, mil-
lers, farmers and other ratepayers of
Bacchus Marsh, for the purpose of
taking into consideration the toll at
Keilor. Tenders were opened for
erection of bridge over the Werribee,
near Woolpack. Mr. P. Byrnes’, at
£4 80, was successful. Mr. Ryan re-
tires from Board. Authority was gi-
ven for erection of new bridge over
Korkuperrimul creek, on the new
line of road. Carried that the Board
take the steps necessary to put them
in possession of the Common, and
other Crown lands, in accordance
with Amended Land Act. Mr. Grant,
M. 8., resigns. Beginning of an im-
portant movement, that very much
bears upon the prosperity of the
Marsh to-day, occurs in minutes of
meeting, 11th Nov., 1865. A depu-
tation, .consisting of Messrs. Young,
Crook, Saunders andGreenwell, wait-
ed upon the Board for the purpose
of explaining the projected scheme
of irrigation, adopted by the provi-
sional Irrigation Committee. The
meeting was adjourned for further


consideration, and for getting the
engineer’s opinion as to the practica-
bility of obtaining a supply of water
for irrigation purposes from the
creek in the western part of the dis-
trict.
I have finished the review of this
interesting record. The second part,
that is, from 186 3 to 6 5, was dreary
reading ; but the 185 6-58 historian
was a master chronicler. He evi-
dently was writing for posterity,
and every community should pre-
serve, as far as possible, the story
of its birth, but those later paid
municipal scribes were in perfect
accord, in giving a transcription of
business that was, to say the least,
slipshod, and to those who would
have to review made the task not
one of pleasure, but laborious.
Thomas Carlyle has left on record
his experience in ransacking dry-as-
dust documents. I must again refer
to that absolute loss when all record
of those momentous five years in
the life of this community disap-
peared.
Opeping Of The Railway.
“Bacchus Marsh, May Bth, 1879.
Your attendance is respectfully re-
quested at a public meeting to be
held in the Athenaeum Hall (near
the Town Hall) Collins street, Mel-
bourne, on Tuesday, 2 oth May, at
2 p.m., for the purpose of urging
upon the Government the desirabil-
ity of providing in the first schedule
of the new Railway Bill for the
construction of a line from Keilor
Road to Gordon, thereby supplying
the much needed Direct Line
between Melbourne and the whole
North Western District, besides giv-
ing a local line to an extensive,
long neglected, thickly populated,
and fertile district, having claims
to be provided with a railway second
to none in the colony.-—Signed, on
behalf of a pubic meeting held in
Bacchus Marsh.—Geo. Dickie, Presi-
dent, Shire Council of Bacchus
Marsh. Note—The expenses of
meeting provided for.”
I am informed by Mr. Thos. G.
Pearce that that particular confer-
ence was an immense success, A
previous conference had been held
at Ballarat, but the Athenaeum Con-
ference was the climax, and the
district, after much laboring on the
part of redoubtable leaders, eventu-
ally saw the fulfilment. If the proof
of the pie is the eating of it, those
numerous trains that speed up and
down via Bacchus Marsh is abundant
confirmation that the merits of the
case were by no means overstated.
I have a copy of “Express” for
Feb. 19th, 18 87, which gives a splen-
did description of the function which
celebrated the opening of the rail-
way. The town was properly en
fete. Never had there been seen
such a procession in the locality.
Everybody rejoiced, and the oratory
on the great occasion sounded the
general feeling of jubilation. I wish
I could give the fullness of detail.
It is an instance of reporting at a
high level. Undoubtedly Mr. Crisp
has stamped his personality upon
the history of this locality. The ac-
count of the movement alone takes
up 5J columns. I summarise. Some
time about 1853-4 attention was
turned to providing a direct road
from Melbourne to Ballarat. In
18 57, Captain Clarke, later the well-
known Sir Andrew Clarke, suggested
a line very nearly on present route,
but bifurcating near Ballan, one
branch south for Ballarat, the other
north for Bendigo. In 1859, a Bac-
chus Marsh Railway League was
formed, but influence of Geelong,
Kyneton and Castlemaine shelved
the direct line, and accented the
Geelong to Ballarat, and Bendigo
lines. From 185 9-72 the projected
railway to Bacchus Marsh slumbers.
In 187 3, “Express” advocated a line
starting from Digger’s Rest, taking
Coimadai, Bacchus Marsh and Ballan,
en route to Blackwood. The “Ex-
press” works hard, and is backed up
by the community, not forgetting
the Shire Council. A Mr. D. D.
Bower, of Coimadai, is particularly
active, eventually becoming Secre-
tary to Railway League. Major
Smith, of Ballarat, favors the Bac-
chus Marsh claims. Mr. Gillies, too,
declares that the next Railway Bill
must supply the great omission. The
question of route now became burn-
ing ; powerful influences at work,
some for north route, some for
south ; the “Argus,” Geelong “Ad-
vertiser,” and Ballarat “Courier,” all
oppose a direct line. In 1876, a


new Railway Bill, but no inclusion
of Bacchus Marsh, In May, 1877,
Mr. Bower leaves the district. The
struggle over' Reform overshadows
the demand for railway. In May,
1879, Mr. J. B. Patterson (after-
wards Sir J. B.) visited the district,
and promised to support a railway.
We now come to that circular letter
of the President of the Shire, Cr.
Geo. Dickie. It was a masterly move
to carry the agitation into the city.
The joint honorary Secretaries were
Messrs. T. G. Pearce and C. Crisp.
Mr. Graham Berry (afterwards Sir
Graham) promises to include railway
in next Bill, and in January, 18 80,
redeemed his promises, and the line
was estimated to cost £9 9,8 0 9. On
July 3rd, a public meeting was held
in the Marsh to have the station as
near Stamford Hill as possible. Sur-
vey party tried Selby’s route into
Marsh, but condemned it. Then
tried a line crossing the valley at
Mahoney’s, and back across Stam-
ford Hill, which was said to be too
severe in grade. Mr. Darbyshire,
Engineer, had years ago declared
that a railway up Pentland Hills was
impracticable. On October 2 3rd, Bill
introduced, with Bacchus Marsh in
it. Mr. Staughton offered and gave
land free for construction. Novem-
ber 2 0, line passed, but Mr. Berry
stated that it was not likely to be
made for a generation, an announce-
ment that caused the local baro-
meter to subside to zero. Line end-
ing at Ryan’s Corner (near Parwan
station) was not acceptable, but 9 9-
hundredth of a loaf was better than
hone. Sir Bryan O’Loghlen came
into power, and he promises the
whole line as a part of ministerial
policy. At instigation of Cr. M.
O’Connell, Mr. Bent visited the dis-
trict, and while Direct line is to be
constructed, the valley can only be
served with a cockspur. Mr. Darby-
shire advises that he could bring the
main line to Maddingley Flat, and
continue it on up Kennedy’s Gully
to the toe of the racecourse hill at
Rowsley. Mr. Leo. Cussen (now
Judge Cussen) succeeds in obtaining
a line by this route, and total cost to
Bacchus Marsh was £22 3,7 31. In
1885, a contract was let, which com-
pleted the Direct Line, costing in all
some half a million of money. The
hundred miles to Bendigo involved an
outlay of £4,688,849 ; and the 53J
miles from Geelong to Ballarat,
£1,766,205.
The horseshoe bend of the rail-
way near the town is a puzzle to
many. The question is asked : Why
did the line undertake this acrobatic
performance? Why did it not pur-
sue its even course on the plateau?
Then follows an ominous shake of
the head —“I suppose some job
again,” and immaculate, departmen-
tal purity suffers defilement at the
hands of an undiscerning public.
For a passing moment the pictorial
style of diction is indulged in. I
see the train like an elongated cat-
erpillar crawling up yonder summit,
with two engines before, and one
behind to ' give a friendly help in
time of need. Straight across to the
plateau is only two or three miles,
and yet to reach that identical spot
the concentrated procession of en-
gines and cars has travelled a cir-
cuitous course of eight miles. On
the face of it some mistake appears
to have been made, especially when
it is remembered that the section
is part of an inter-State line, in con-
nection with which time is the es-
sence of the contract —mail contracts
particularly. I must quote from Mr.
Crisp, what he in reality obtained
from someone else, evidently an
authority on such matters. Mr.
Crisp seems to hold a brief as re-
gards the solution of the Gordian
knot, and I purpose, as he has gen-
erously given me permission to help
myself, to extract the quoted part
of his defence :
“The line as constructed between
Parwan station and the Dog Trap
reservoir is about 2 4 chains longer
than the route surveyed via Ryan’s
corner (near Parwan station) and
Collie’s bridge (close to the Dog
Trap reservoir), between the same
points. The two lines rejoin at the
road about midway between the
crossing of the Parwan Creek and
the Dog Trap Gully on the Ryan’s
corner route ; and therefore the long
gradient of 1 in 48 from the Par-
wan Creek on towards Gordon must
have been the same upon either line.
On the Ryan’s corner route the
gradients would have been compar-
atively easy between Parwan station


and the crossing of the Parwan
Creek, where the steep ascending
gradient of 1 in 4 8 commences,
which is common to both routes. The
length of ascending gradient of 1 in
4 8 upon that portion of the Ryan’s
corner route between Parwan station
and the Dog Trap reservoir would
have been about 110 chains in
length, against 240 chains of 1 in 48,
and 2 7 chains of 1 in 50 ascending,
and 90 chains of 1 in 49 and 4 5
chains of 1 in 50 descending gradi-
ent upon the line as constructed be-
tween the same points. If the line
had been constructed via Ryan’s
corner it would have been necessary
in order to accommodate Bacchus
Marsh, to construct in addition a
branch line to that place. And a
viaduct would have been required
over the Parwan Creek of similar
construction to that over the Werri-
bee. The length of this would have
been about 300 feet, and the height
about 120 feet. This detour of four
miles has its exact parallel on the
old Geelong route to Ballarat, solely
to touch Geelong, and not on ac-
count of engineering difficulties. The
through trains used to run two miles
into Geelong and two miles back
again in order to resume the main
line journey. No one ever noticed
this, and therefore never complain-
ed of it ; but it was a thoroughly
useless encumbrance on the through
traffic, which is not the case on the
Bacchus Marsh route, for the detour,
although so noticeable, was quite un-
avoidable on account of the natural
configuration of the country. A si-
milar bend of about six miles oc-
curs between Mitcham and Belair on
the Adelaide end of the overland
route. Those places are about two
miles distant from each other as
the crow flics, but are eight miles
apart by railway line, the cause be-
ing that Mitcham is 2 41 feet above
sea level and Belair, 1,008 feet
above the sea.”
Now let the doubter for ever hold
his peace. Abundant evidence is
supplied that from an engineering
point of view “the horseshoe” is a
valid performance, without the faint-
est approach to any “fishy” aroma.
It was a great engineering feat to
make that railway call at Bacchus
Marsh, and then to scale the plateau,
and the glory involved in same is
to be shared by three engineers, Mr.
Leo. Cussen, Mr. G. C. Darbyshire,
and Mr. W. C. Billings. Versatile
indeed was the genius of Mr. Leo
Cussen, for how seldom in the one
mind is there the conjunction of the
literary and the mathematical fac-
ulty ; but law now claims the erst-
while Engineer as one of its bright-
est ornaments, for in Judge Cussen
we have one whose judgments are
almost invariably beyond successful
appeal.
It was a great day indeed at the
opening of the railway. The weather
being perfect. Only one hitch oc-
curred, the banners, bearing the as-
piration, “Advance Bacchus Marsh,”
which were to sideboard the visiting
engine, and also the flags, were all
mislaid. The street was a wealth of
bunting. The waggons lent by Mr.
MTntosh (so the picturesque report
says) had been etherealised, and at
the same time magnified to the pro-
portions of ships in full sail by ela-
borate decoration with willow
wreaths, flags, and mottoes. The
Egerton brass band (when will the
Marsh ever get a band?) in hand-
some four-in-hand drag, led the
way ; Cr. Molesworth Greene’s car-
riage, with His Excellency the Go-
vernor (Sir Henry Loch) following;
then the typically colonial four-
horse “jack” coach of Cobb & Co.,
loaded with guests, conspicuous on
top being Messrs. John Saunders and
D. G. Stobie, former well-known re-
sidents of the Marsh. The pageant
stretched a distance of three-quar-
ters of a mile, closing with a group
of horsemen. Mr. Alexander For-,
syth, who appeared in his handsome
Hussar uniform was Chief Marshal.
Mr. Wm. Meikle, -in less showy but
appropriate costume of Victorian
Mounted Rifles, was second Marshal.
Other Marshals were Mr. G. A.
Bence and Mr. T. G. Pearce, “our
übiquitous townsman.” Upon the
arrival of the train (a bit late) His
Excellency was received with “God
save the Queen” by band and chil-
dren. The line was then declared
open by His Excellency, amid ring-
ing cheers. A great picnic in Park
to 500 children, and hundreds of
adults, supervised by Messrs. Voysey,
Hodgson (of Board of Advice) Howe,


W. Grant (Millbank) and others.
Abundance of eating and drinks ; it
took days afterwards, so report avers,
to correct internal troubles. G. S.
Buckley & Sons were specially com-
plimented on their display.
While the picnic was In full swing,
a banquet took place in the Mech-
anics' Institute, and 12 U guests sat
down. In addition to His Excellency,
there were present three members
of the Ministry, Sir W. J. Clarke,
Messrs. Staughton, Rees and Cooper,
M’s.L.A. Mr. W. H. Bacchus, J.P.,
son of Captain Bacchus, was among
the company, also Mr. D. D. Bower,
and Mr. Fincham, Parliamentary re-
presentative of Ballarat. The Pre-
sident of the Shire (Cr. MoleswOrth
Greene) occupied the chair. He gave
the toast "The Governor” dwelling
upon certain incidents in His Excel-
lency’s career, particularly when in
captivity in a Chinese prison he sat
for days face to face with death,
forming one of the most thrilling
episodes in our military history.
"The Ministry” was proposed by the
Chairman, but he severely comment-
ed on the imposition of a land tax
upon a helpless minority of 802 per-
sons. It w T as his opinion that much
of legislation recently passed was of
a curfew character. The Hon. C. H.
Pearson replied. He stated that he
had much pleasure in being present
to represent the Chief Secretary (Mr.
Deakin) who was prevented from at-
tending. The hon. gentleman pre-
dicted a great future for Mr. Deakin,
The Chief Secretary was absent to
take part in the first Conference ever
called for by the British Government
as a recognition of the unity of the
Empire. He .would be in England
for the Jubilee of the Queen. Mr.
Dow, Member of Ministry, also re-
plied. Mr. Wm. Grant, of Border
Mill, proposed "The Parliament of
Victoria,” and said the Hon. Alfred
Deakin was Bacchus Marsh’s own
particular pet; Mr. Staughton was a
man after their own heart ; the Hon.
Peter Lalor was facile princeps of
Speakers, and Mr. Rees was like
good wine, the older the better he
got. Sir W. J. Clarke, Mr. Cooper
(Chairman of Committees) and Mr.
Staughton, replied. Mr. Staughton
caused vociferous applause in stick-
ing out for completion of the lihe.
Cr. George Dickie proposed the toast
of the Railway Commissioners and
officers of the Department; replied to
by Mr. R. Watson, C.E., Engineer-
in-Chief. He had surveyed the line
30 years previous under instructions
from Mr. Darbyshire, who was then
head of Roads and Bridges Depart-
ment, and the site he had selected
for crossing the Werribee had been
adopted. The deviation to accom-
modate the Marsh only lengthened
the line 2 3 chains, and if a branch
line had been given in lieu of that
it would cost £5 a day, or £1,500
a year, sufficient to pay interest on
£30,000. The Hon. C. H. Pearson
proposer "Local Bodies,” Cr. Long-
hurst, of Ballan Shire, and Mr. J.
E. Crook, ex-Cr., responded ; Mr.
Crook estimated that the passengers
from Melbourne to Ballarat in 80
years had paid £37 5,000 excess
fares, their loss per hour at 1/ per
hour was worth half a million of
money, and on the goods traffic there
was double the loss as on passen-
gers; added to this, the Department
lost £BO a day in working the extra
30 miles, and they had a total loss
of two millions of money. Cr. Hugh
Meikle, J.P., proposed the "Contrac-
tors”; replied to by Mr. G. Buckley,
sen. Mr. T. G. Pearce proposed
"Our Guests.” Mr. Pearce contri-
buted a fine purple patch ; "They
trusted that in a few years when
they had the water flowing over now
desert places, and gentlemen’s villas
studding the heights round about,
they would be able to count their vi-
sitors by hundreds, coming to see the
suburb of the capital of a Federated
Australia.” Mr. Anderson, Member
for Creswick responded. Mr. Cus-
sen. Engineer, had a special toast,
to which he responded. The Hon.
T. F. Derham proposed success to
Bacchus Marsh and District, and this
was acknowledged by the Chairman.
Cr. T. Cain, J.P., proposed "The
Press,” coupled with name of Mr.
C. Crisp. Mr. Crisp replied at
length, a rather unusual proceeding
for him, and the speech reads well.
His Excellency the Governor propos-
ed the health of the Chairman. He
had the pleasure of knowing Mr.
Molesworth Greene ever since he
came to the colony, and he recognis-
ed him as one of the earliest of the


young pioneers, who left the old
country to make the colony—what it
is. Great applause, and the Chair-
man responded.
This ended the function, and Bac-
chus Marsh entered on a new
career. Mr. T. G. Pearce’s forecast
has not been consummated, but the
progress has been none the less ex-
traordinary.
Missing Records Found.
Early Municipal Problems.
Mr. Con. M'Farlane (grandson of
Mr. Con. Mahoney) has unearthed
the Minute Book recording trans-
actions of Road Board for 1858-63,
and kindly brought it along. The
instinct of being interested in local
civics is evidently common to the
Mahoney race. I have to make
qualification in regard to former
statement : Firstly, that the record
from 185 8-6 3 has not altogther
vanished, but only from 7th April,
1860, to 21st Nov., 1862 : secondly,
that the Secretary, or Secretaries,
who compiled the concerned minutes
were not guilty of bald statement
and illegibility, for the Minute
Book, which now lies open before me
for that period is a pattern of ord-
erly arrangement and fine penman-
ship. I was misled by the note
which appeared in the Minute Book
reviewed two Saturdays ago. Evi-
dently the unfinished part of this
book was brought into requisition for
the purpose of taking rough min-
utes, and was not the official record.
The latter is now, as I have said, be-
fore me, and it is in an excellent
state of preservation.
I continue the review. Mr. Mor-
daunt M'Lean’s facile and correct
pen particularly makes easy peru-
sal. A fine bold hand is that of Mr.
Stanfield. The election for Board of
1858 took place. A great number
of candidates ; voting is given fully.
Messrs. James Young, Cornelius
Mahoney, James E. Crook, J. M.
Matson, John Thomas, James Watt,
Henry James, Hugh Meikle, and
Joseph Anderson, were elected. The
chronicler attaches ‘‘Esquires,” and
does not preface “Messrs.” Assess-
ment for 1859 was fixed at 2i per
cent, on annual rental value of
; houses, messuages and tenements ;
6d. per acre on cultivated land ; id.
per acre on grass. Mr. John Thomas
is elected chairman. Evidently in
those days ratepayers were particu-
larly alive in regard to management
of public affairs, for the following
appears : —-“In consequence of the
ratepayers having demanded the
Books belonging to the Board, and
the books being now sealed illegally
by the auditors, it is the opinion of
the Board that the said auditors by
sealing the books have acted con-
trary to law, and without authority;
and in consequence to prevent fur-
ther litigation we now authorise the
Chairman to break open the said
books in order to give the ratepayers
the right of perusing same.” Fur-
ther minutes are explanatory that
there had been some rumpus. Mr.
Crook proposed, and Mr. Matson se-
conded, “that the conduct of Mr.
Main, one of the auditors, by accus-
ing members of the Board of em-
bezzlement at a meeting assembled
is grossly and extremely offensive in
the extreme, and that in the opinion
of the Board a vote of censure be
now accorded in the minutes of the
day. Carried.” Auditors would
not audit accounts, and a Mr. Part-
ridge was engaged to draw up bal-
ance-sheet to be transmitted to the
Treasurer of the Colony. Mr. Par-
tridge was paid two guineas for his
services. One protest embodied in
minutes and signed “Hugh Meikle”
—“I hereby protest against the pre-
sent Balance-sheet.” Good times for
ratepayers, as indicated in a motion
by Messrs. Watt and James—“ That
not considering, that we can legally
lay any assessment for the year
185 8, in consequence of the rate not
having been fixed at public meeting,
the collection of the same be aban-
doned.” Evidently the fathers of
the hamlet were sticklers for legal
procedure. Much correspondence
over “Lerderdearg” crossing ; bridge,
not yet erected, that coming later.
Secretary voted £6/2/ expenses for
cases brought against him. What
cases not stated, probably in con-
nection with rates, arising out of
“illegal” assessment. The assess-
ment was "moral” but not “legal,”
and probably everyone of the fathers


of the hamlet went devoutly to
church tne next Sunday. Madding-
iey is asserting itself—a road from
the Melbourne and Ballarat road to
Maddingley is referred to the Com-
missioner of Crown Lands and Sur-
vey, with a request that it may meet
with immediate attention. Thus
Grant street, with its now increas-
ing traffic, came into being. A big
fight, January 22, 1859, over the
“illegal” assessment of 185 9, Messrs.
James Young, and J. E. Crook bring
forth an elaborate minute, that the
said assessment was valid. Too long
to quote, but Messrs. Con Mahoney
and Meikle are just as firm that the
assessment should be not made
“that Mr. Young’s motion be not
entertained, because of the proofs
that can be adduced to the contrary,
and also of the unworthy personali-
ties contained therein.” In those
days they used to hit out. To-day
Crs. James Watson, Molesworth
Greene, W. H. M‘Farlane, and their
confreres live in peace and happi-
ness, so long as the moon and sun
shall endure. Hard lines for Secre-
tary—salary reduced to £IOO from
£2 50. A right-about-face on part
of Board—“ That the resolution that
no assessment for 185 8 shall be paid,
be rescinded, and that fresh notices
be issued, only assessing the land
or houses and not both, and that
their own case is to be tried in
Court against any ratepayer who
objects to the payment upon the
plea that the rates have not been
legally fixed.” Carried with two
dissentients, Messrs, Henry James
and Cornelius Mahoney, the latter
evidently having nailed his colors to
the mast. Road from Blackwood to
land of Mr. M'Lachlan, in
the parish of Korkuperrimul,
is referred to the Commissioner of
Roads and Bridges, and it is directed
that road from Bacchus Marsh to
the Railway station, near the “Un-
ion Inn,” should be made passable.
General geography will be at de-
fault to know where Railway sta-
tion or “Union Inn” was.
Bacchus Marsh District is divided
into five portions, foundation of
“Ridings.” Mr. James Mahoney,
jun., appointed assessor. A motion
to remove Secretary lost. Another
protest, 25th June, 1859 — the at-
mosphere always seemed to be sul-
phurous—“l, James Moon Matson,
chairman of 8.M.D.R.8., hereby pro-
test against any proceedings what-
ever being taken by the persons at
present acting as the 8.M.D.R.8.”
Things no better 2nd July. A min-
ute signed by James Young and J.
E. Crook —“that this meeting stands
adjourned until 16th inst., and that
circulars be sent to members of
Board informing them of illegality
of several gentlemen who had been
acting as members of this Board,
and requesting them to meet and
take matters into consideration.”
The plot thickens —Carried “that the
Secretary write to Mr. J. Thomas
demanding from him an apology
for instituting proceedings in Po-
lice Court against Messrs. Matson
Young and Crook.” I make bold to
state that no novel could afford such
thrilling incidents as is recorded in
the annals of the 8.M.D.R.8. Messrs.
Crook and Young and others are on
the war-path—“ That this meeting
as now constituted is the only legal
Board, and that we now declare the
names of Messrs. Thomas, Meikle,
Mahoney and Anderson altogether
ignored as not having any right,
&c.”; also, “that if Mr. Thomas did
not make that apology he was to
be proceeded against.” Much wrang-
ling but little road business; one
move however, that live and dead
trees be removed from road near
Darley. Memory of assessment still
lingering—-all persons who have paid
rates for year 1858 shall have re-
spective amounts returned on appli-
cation. It was deemed inexpedient
in the judgment of the Board the
separation of Pentland Hills from
8.M.D.R.8. —two pages of close writ-
ing on report on petition. Thus
those fertile uplands producing
under the skill of the Lidgetts and
Dugdales prize Royal Show stock,
to-day are still identified with the
interests of Bacchus Marsh, Tenders
called for forming road from Blow’s
Plat to Blackwood. Mr. John
Thomas, formerly of Bacchus Marsh,
later of Oakfield, must have been
worsted in the Court proceedings.
The Secretary is instrucetd to trans-
mit to Mr. Thomas Mr. Gile’s ac-
count of legal expenses, With
a request that he will defray same.


upon the settlement of the amount
by Mr. J. Thomas the Board will
undertake to hold him harmless
from any liabilities which he may
have incurred while acting as Chair-
man of 8.M.D.R.8. in disposal of
funds of Board. The first evidence
of the existence of a district news-
paper, 11th Oct., 1859, among ac-
counts, “Gisborne Express,” adver-
tising, £l/17/6. No Bacchus Marsh

Roads Board Elections.
Annual meeting, 185 9, convened
by Charles Shuter, Esq., Stipentiary
Magistrate, Mr. John Sidney took
the chair. Board had its opposition
—3 9 votes that it be dissolved, 51
that it continue. The election of
members resulted in return of
Messrs. James Young, J. M. Matson,
R. Kerr, W. Grant (Millbank), T.
H. Pyke, Joseph Anderson, J. E.
Crook, William Grant, jun., William
Brown. In all ballots, so far, that
have come under notice, James
Young always led. Assessment was
fixed (carried 60 to 57) one farthing
per acre on cultivation land, one-
twelfth of a farthing on grass land,
one-forthy-eighth of a farthing on
land held by lease from Crown, and
one-farthing per pound sterling on
the annual rental of buildings. Mr.
J. E. Crook elected chairman for
ensuing year. The Attorney-Gen-
eral was to be consulted as to valid-
ity of assessment for 1859-60, on
the ground once bit, twice shy. A
matter is under review, 19th Dec.,
1859, when Board is specially sum-
moned to consider the desirability
of erecting a toll upon the main
road through Bacchus Marsh from
Melbourne to Ballarat. Particular
meeting was held, and outcome that
two toll gates and two toll houses
be erected at Djerriwarrh Creek,
and also at foot of Pentland Hills,
on spot most suitable, persons pass-
ing through gates to pay toll at one
gate and to be cleared through the
other by ticket issued by Board.
Patrick George Murphy, of Pent-
land Hills, forwards a letter, to-Com-,
missioner of Roads and Bridges,
■which occasions an elaborate repdrt
from Board to Commissioner, and a
minute is entered, 17th Feb., 1860,
which expresses indignation at the
proceedings by the said Patrick Geo.
Murphy, stigmatising as untrue that
there was a want of unanimity on
the question of the dismemberment
of the Board ; indeed the Board was
unanimous that such dismember-
ment would be prejudicial to Bac-
chus Marsh and Pentland Hills dis-
trict. That assessment is always
proving a bugbear. Notwithstand-
ing that an assessment was fixed for
current year, the Board as a body
resigns, giving the reason that no
suitable assessment had been made
by annual meeting. Resignations
were therefore tendered that a levi-
able rate might be fixed. Pursuant
to a public notice, a meeting of
ratepayers was held 7th April, 1860.
Mr. Robert Lawson, of Blackwood,
occupies chair. No business could be
done, as there was no written
evidence of Governor’s acceptance
of resignations. It has been observ-
ed before that the fathers of the
hamlet were sticklers for legal de-
corum ; those inserted protests are
proof of this tendency of the Bac-
chus Marshites in the fifties and
sixties. Another public meeting was
to take place, and we have now
come to the blank already referred
to in the minutes from 7th April,
1860, to 21st November, 1862. Pub-
lic meeting on later date, Mr. Jere-
miah Ryan is in the chair. For mem-
bership of Board a ballot is taken,
and James Young, Jeremiah Ryan,
Wm. Grant (Millbank), Robert Law-
son, George Grant, John Myers, Ro-
bert Grant, J. E. Crook, and David
Lindsay, are successful. The assess-
ment rate was fixed at 6d. per acre on
cultivable lands, and in same pro-
portion on other lands as allowed
by the Act ; and a 2J per cent, on
annual value of property. At meet-
ing 22nd Nov., 1862, Mr. James
Young, J.P., is appointed chairman.
He must have just got the Commis-
sion of the Peace, When reviewing
the labors of these past leaders of
the community, you feel it just fit-
ting that their descendants should
be occupying responsible positions
in our midst. Dr. T. B. Ryan, and
Dr. W. B. Ryan, are in the line of
descent of Mr. Jeremiah Ryan, an
active member of Road Board of the


early sixties. A Secretary and En-
gineer is now required. Mr, Mor-
daunt M'Lean was appointed Asses-
sor, but he got permission to with-
draw, and Mr. T. Kissock was elect-
ed. Six full pages are given to Bye-
laws to regulate the proceedings of
the Board.
Construction Of Roads.
Lerderderg bridge not yet con-
structed, and Messrs. J. E. Crook,
D. Lindsay, and Jeremiah Ryan are
appointed a sub-committee to report
upon suitable site. Mr. T. Kissock
agrees to prepare a full roll, taking
all responsibility for £2 5. Report
re site of Lerderdearg bridge adop-
ted, and tenders called twice in
“Argus,” once in “Age,” and twice
in “Ballarat Star”—no local paper
yet. Tenders called for footbridge
across Werribee, 10th Jan., 1863.
Site for Lerderdearg river bridge
gives occasion for another sub-com-
mittee to report. A new newspaper
account, that of “West Bourke
Chronicle,” for advertisting. At
Road Board Conference (where held
not stated) there was a query as to
qualification of members of District
Council. Moved by Mr. George
Grant, seconded by Mr. John Myers,
that the qualification be £3O for
freehold, and £5O for leasehold pro-
perty, have passed the Civil Service
examination, are members of any
University, or who belong to one of
the learned professions. A. For-
syth’s tender for building a foot-
bridge over Werribee, for £2l/15/,
accepted. A stone crossing over the
Lerderdearg river, on the road from
Korkuperrimul to Merrimu, is con-
structed at a cost of £35. Mr. Pat-
rick Nagle’s tender, £23/10/, for
Ryan’s ford, is accepted. Requests
from many quarters that roads shall
be formed or attended to. Petition
signed by Mr. Vere Quaille and
others requesting that road be made
from Reserve No. 1, in the Parish
of Gorrockburkghap, to Maddingley.
What is more interestingly historic
in the genesis of a town than to
learn how the roads sprang into ex-
istence, for along these pulsate the
life blood of traffic. The Engineer
is requested to report on the road
from Maddingley Bridge to Morton’s
farm, and to make the road along
the Werribee passable for drays. A
Morton homestead is still along the
river. The Board is now looking to
the hamlet —that tenders be invited
for cleaning the channels, and rais-
ing the footpath through the town-
ship of Bacchus Marsh. The towns-
people are notified that Road Acts
should not be infringed upon—how
not stated. Six shillings per day is
fixed as the rate of wages for
Board’s laborers. Messrs. Ealam &
Brown’s tender, £3 0, accepted for
raising footpath and clearing chan-
nels on main road, from M‘Lean*s
bridge to Edward’s gully. Good
deal of attention paid to Pentland
Hills, and much correspondence had
been with Ballan Road Board that
it should share expense for certain
culverts on main Ballarat and Mel-
bourne road, and near Myrniong.
Watson & Cuthbertson’s tender,
£lOl/10/, for stone culvert at Myrn-
iong, is accepted. Ealam & Brown’s
tender for two log bridges, one from
Crook street into main road, the
other from Fisken street into main
road, accepted. 2nd May, 186 3, the
Engineer is instructed to prepare
plans and specifications for making
and metalling main road through
township of Myrniong. Young St.
and Gisborne road are favored with
an expenditure of £4O. 30th May,
1863, Engineering department of
Board not being satisfactory, ar-
rangements were made with Mr.
Harris, Engineer and Surveyor of
Ballan. 6 per cent, on all works and
plans carried out by him. Secre-
tary's salary now only £52 per an-
num. A fair amount of money spent
on Werribee road. Mr. Grover is
appointed Secretary of Road Board.
The review of the period is fin-
ished. So far, it has only been main
roads that have claimed attention;
side streets are scarcely mentioned.
—Grant and Young streets, and Gis-
borne road, being the only ones fa-
voured.
It was recently stated that Queen
Mary, whenever she has to pay an
official visit to a locality, takes a
delight in becoming conversant with
its past history, and it is safe to
say that, limited as our community
is, could any other —a city if yon
will—give to its rising generation a


more interesting account of its de-
velopment ?
The battle of the early fifties
and slxites we now pass away from
There is no longer a Road Board,
yet we, too, are making history, to
be regarded as ancient by our des-
cendants a few decades hence. It
may be recorded yet that there was
once in the history of Bacchus Marsh
some very prominent men, who did
their best to help on the good old
ship of the locality, perhaps a
humble chronicler included, who
deemed it desirable that what records
were extant should permanently be
preserved.
Progress Of District.
I propose breaking fresh ground,
and I therefore proceed.
It has been demonstrated time
after time that land values on the
Marsh are fictitious. I am told that
the producer, in consequence of Fed-
eral and State land taxes and water
charges, has to live on the smell of
an oil rag. I don’t know how many
times, it has been clearly proved to
me that every land-owner in the
locality, in consequence of heavy
imposts, must become insolvent; and
must appear on Sunday in dunga-
rees.
Some of us are gullible ; we ac-
cept what others affirm so dogmat-
ically ; but there is an old proverb
that the proof of the pie Is the eat-
ing of it, and’ in the general im-
provement all round I am reminded
of the rich man enlarging his bor-
ders and building his barns than
of the owner of the tenement with a
bark roof, who does a dodge when
se sees the bailiff coming to sell
him out, lock, stock and barrel.
Land on the Marsh still carries
a high value, and heavy water
charges only seem to have one effect
of solidifying that value, and blessed
is the man who possesses 30, 40,
50, 60, 80 acres of the lucerne sub-
stratum. His lines are cast in happy
places.
Please do not misunderstand the
historian of the favored spot. I am
not arguing that the charge for the
liquid should not be diminished, as
beer from 6d. was reduced to 3d.—
a glorious reformation to thirsty
mortal so Inclined, but I am jealous
of the good name of the community.
The Marsh, with the arteries spread-
ing over the flat in a network of
channels, carrying the life-giving
fluid to every acre, is only fructify-
ing to a greater degree, and it is no
stretch of hyperbole to say that irri-
gation is making her as a bride
adorned to meet her husband.
I might quote the prosperity of
the Bacchus Marsh Dairymen’s Co-
operative Association Limited as a
proof that local land values have not
receded, nor are they likely to do so.
The factory was opened in the se-
cond week of November, 1910, or
some time thereabouts. I think it
can be said that its success has been
phenomenal, and has been rarely
equalled and never excelled as an
example of what the co-operative
principle can achieve, backed by
loyalty and good land.
Prior to registration of this com-
pany, the market requirements of
the district were met by the Bacchus
Marsh Concentrated Milk Proprie-
tary Company, and also by Mr. T.
Anderson’s Concentrated Milk Fac-
tory (privately owned), known as
the Merrimu Factory, but the pro-
prietary company buying out the
other, a number of producers, not
satisfied with the state of affairs,
held a meeting, and decided to form
the Bacchus Marsh Dairymen’s Co-
operative Association Limited.
It was resolved that the capital
of the Association should be 6000
shares of £1 each, 3000 of which
were sold and calls up to 10/ paid
on them. The factory thus started
its life with a working capital of
£1,500, but such was not found suf-
ficient, and it was deemed necessary
for the directors to sign “a joint
and several” with a local banking
institution for an overdraft, which
at one time reached £2,500. But
the phenomenal success referred to
in a short space of three years has
wiped off the overdraft, torn up the
“joint and several,” erected and
paid for plant, building and machin-
ery to the value of £6OOO, and, con-
current with this effort, paid the
highest price for butter-fat of any
factory in Australia. It is the voice
of the enemy to say that land values
in the Marsh are becoming uncer-
tain.


Most of the co-operative enterprise
of Australia, especially at commence-
ment of the movement, had to fight
for their existence. Vested interest
is generally unscrupulous ; at least
if not unscrupulous, very assertive.
The history of the co-operative
movement is to this effect, that it
has always been attended with sore
struggle induced by disloyalty of
supporters, possibly engineered by
some powerful rival, and owing to
that very fight for existence it took
many years to establish the co-oper-
ative principle.
But the local Dairymen’s Co-oper-
ative Association was lucky in hav-
ing among its promoters men who
knew how to port the helm in time
of stress. They firmly decided be-
fore commencing their enterprise
that they would put it beyond the
power of any opposition to cause
them a moment’s uneasiness or con-
cern. The safeguard was to make
all shareholders sign a bond, and
as this has undoubtedly been the
foundation of the company’s success,
I think I cannot do better than
quote from the bond. Before being
incorporated in the Articles of As-
sociation it was submitted to three
leading legal lights, and deemed by
them irrefragable :
“Each member shall, subject to
the special powers conferred upon
the Directors, and hereinafter set
forth, supply to the Company for
seven years from date of his be-
coming a member, or until his death,
whichever period shall first expire,
all milk obtained from his cattle on
any land, whether freehold or lease-
hold, within 15 miles of the Bacchus
Marsh post-office and available for
sale, and no member will proffer such
milk or sell the same to any other
person. Any member who shall com-
mit a breach of the Articles shall be
liable to pay to the Company and
its assigns as and by way of liqui-
dated damages the sum of three
hundred pounds.”
The bond caused so much atten-
tion that a number of other factor-
ies about to be formed requested a
copy of the Articles of Association
for their guidance. Two noted ex-
amples were the Gippsland and
Northern Bacon Curing Company,
and the Western District Bacon Cur-
ing Company.
The two main avenues of produc-
tion of Association are pasteurised
milk and casein. The company’s
pasteurised milk output grew so rap-
idly—reaching 2 000 gallons per diem
within the first few months of the
company’s existence—that it became
necessary to duplicate the whole of
the freezing power'at a cost of £7OO.
and so effective is this portion of
plant that it is possible to receive
2 000 gallons within factory walls,
heat up to 180 degrees F., with an
almost instantaneous reduction to 30
degrees, and to place in a truck
cooled by ic© manufactured in fac-
tory in space of four hours. All
milk that is not forwarded to city
depot is skimmed ; the cream is
turned into butter, and skimmed milk
into casein.
Development of Bacchus Marsh
Dairymen’s Co-operative
Association.
In dealing with this enterprise I
would like to say a few words in
favor of the cheapness and efficiency
of suction gas as a motive power.
The advantage of the gas is appar-
ent in the company’s doings. Wood
is a costly item, 7/6 per ton mea-
surement, and if the whole of the
motive power had been steam the
weekly bill of firewood would have
been £l4 per week, but owing to
the success of suction gas the power
supplied for all the company’s
needs, including steam for pasteur-
ising and washing up purposes,
costs only £6 per week, thus result-
ing in a saving of £B—or £416 per
annum —which is a good profit in
itself for any company.
The company’s place of operating
occupies a very fine site in the heart
of the town, within a few moments’
walk of the post-office. And, as
showing the wholeheartedness of
one of those interested in this
movement, the site was a free gift
from the late Hon. G. T. Dickie,
M.L.C., on behalf of the Dickie fam-
ily; and when you have such stal-
wart support in the birth of an in-
stitution, it is small wonder that
the progress should be continuous.
In passing, I might say that the
late honorable gentleman was the


first Chairman of the Association,
and there is a full-sized portrait of
him hanging in the Board room.
The mantle has descended on the
shoulders of Mr. Charles Dickie,
who has ably discharged the duties
of chairman, to which position he
was elected at his brother’s de-
cease.
The battle, as I have said, was
severe. The duties of the Directors
were onerous, for there was much
timidity on the part of shareholders,
and certain untoward events occur-
red, but in spite of every obstacle
the Directors persisted, and they
must rest satisfied to-day with the
result of their labours.
The Directorate has throughout
remained the same — C. Dickie, J.
Watson, J. Wills, T. H. Kyle, H.
O’Hagan, M. Shea, T. B. Nagle, P.
A. McParlane and G. F. Ramsey.
The outlook of the Association is
most buoyant, but in my opinion it
is the nucleus of a company that
will have a much wider sphere of
activity. It will undertake new
products, assuredly dipping deep
into the canning Industry. Bacchus
Marsh is admirably endowed by
nature for production that should
in manufactured state reach the
four corners of the globe.
If so, there will be no end to the
Marsh’s possibilities of develop-
ment. The Articles of Association
are so comprehensively drawn up
that it allows any horticultural or
agricultural activity to be exploited.
Forecasts and Suggestions.
Is it too sanguine a foresight to
picture the Dairymen’s Co-operative
Association. Limited a hotbed of in-
dustrial goaheadness, turning out
unlimited quantity of varied pro-
ducts, illuminating the town with
its powerful electrical dynamo, ahd
with its buildings extending Up-
wards and onwards ?
The Directors are shrewd business
men; they have a great interest in
the Marsh; and, blessed with initi-
ative, we may expect them to em-
bark upon other industries at’ any
moment that must have great influ-
ence upon the welfare of the com-
munity generally.
One man may make a city. Sir
Titus Salt, where there was scarcely
any population, founds Saltaire;
and Mr. H. V. McKay gives an ex-
ample in Sunshine as to what one
individual may accomplish. The
Bacchus Marsh Concentrated Milk
Company is a success; but the Bac-
chus Marsh Dairymen’s Co-opera-
tive Association Limited is equally
so. There is room for the proprie-
tary; there is room for the co-oper-
ative; and it is a bad thing for a
community where there is monopoly
for the one kind or the other.
There is only one Bacchus Marsh
in the State. Its location is unique,
its fertility unparalleled. The good
folk who -live in the modern Land
of Canaan must prove true to their
heritage, and the overwhelming
momentum is that water charge, be
it great or small. Naturally the
producer prefers to get the preci-
ous liquid, if possible, for nothing.
It is of no moment to a commun-
ity that it should have the honor of
producing a Carbine. That blood
stock look handsome as they career
around, showing off their delicate
proportions, breeding observable in
every movement, but such is mere
sentiment. The earth was made for
man to live upon, and the Marsh
can yet support a heavier popula-
tion, ahd closer settlement even in
more intense degree must yet be
the result.
Has the Marsh been exploited,
that such marvellous sinew of
strength has not built up more ex-
pansive profitable industry? Verily,
if a portion of this fertile flat, can
well support two factories, then
why should not the remaining,
from an industrial point of view,
fulfil a like noble purpose, and
cease to lie quiescent. Land locked
up is always the black hand work-
ing death in the midst of a com-
munity. But the embargo is being
gradually raised, and the town is
growing, and more money circulat-
ing, and better is it for all The
faithful historian has to declare
that there has been one cause oper-
ating that has prevented the town
assuming its rightful status.
“Morven,” A Typical Farm.
In our review, the present has
fairly been reached. I intend to
take a couple of typical holdings of


the district, first visiting “Morven”;
I find the owner, Mr. James Kerr,
busy. He is making a sluice-gate
for one of the gullies, so that when
the torrent has exhausted itself
after the storm the paddock may
still be fence-proof against .rabbit or
any other kind of depredatory stock.
I am delighted with “Morven”;
it is a model farm, outbuildings
commodious and convenient; not
scattered all over the ship—the cow
yard in one part and cooling appara-
tus in another; but rather a collec-
tion of buildings, as it were, under
the one roof; smithy, carpenter’s
workshop, saw-bench, bails, chaff-
cutter, &.C., all contiguous, and I
learn at once that I must expect
organisation on this farm.
It is so. The garden produces
rotation of fruit and vegetable.
The farm is self-contained, for
there is system. The hens know
just where to lay, and yon lordly
bull has a pew to himself; and as I
look over the fence he gives me
friendly recognition as if we were
old-time acquaintances, but personal
safety seems to dictate that the
lordly gentleman had better be at
one end of a 40-acre paddock and
the local historian at the other.
The farm is beautifully situated.
The verbal landscape painted could
just do this part of the description
properly. There is ample opportun-
ity for use of picturesque terms.
Leave the open flat of the Marsh
and follow the tortuous windings of
the Lerderderg for two and a half
miles and you see “Morven” nest-
ling under Coornmill, which dense-
wooded stretch reaches right on to
Macedon. The farm consists of a
narrow flat of extreme richness, and
much volcanic country that is in
continuity to Coornmill, but not of
it.
Coornmill is Silurian, and bears
heavy growth of timber of little
marketable value, but the volcanic
country is treeless yet most produc-
tive. These volcanic highlands that
overlook “Morven” are in reality
the beginning of the the Pentland
Hills, which are justly celebrated
for their productiveness.
Every farmer is not an organiser;
he does not get the best out of his
possessions. Mr. James Kerr has
perfect management, hence his is a
model farm. Not that he has thou-
sands of acres and multitude of
sheep, not that he grows potatoes in
galore,- but he has 400 acres, and
those 400 acres are made to pro-
duce of their virility. He never
buys a vegetable, kills much of his
own meat, even the rabbits (as I
see by the big roll of skins) that
infest the boundaries of the pro-
perty are part of a most profitable
concern.
The homestead —a fine brick
residence and secure outbuildings,
also neat garden—has water laid on
everywhere, and I notice a spray
playing over the gentle . fronds —I
hope that term is correct —of the
French beans and turnip tops.
There are orange, lemon, apricot,
peach, apple, &c., trees; not a great
orchard for export, but producing
sufficiently to keep the home stock-
ed with preserves.
The water is pumped up from the
Lerderderg by a windmill, and every
tap you turn has a splendid flow ;
and if you wish ablution in the bath
there is full and plenty.
I understand that Governor Car-
michael was specially brought to
view the property, and that he was
very pleased at what he saw. I
repeat that it is good management
that makes a farm, for the number
of by-products is simply astonishing,
I tell Mr. Kerr my object in vis-
iting him. He is somewhat diffident
to descant on the features of his
possession, though I may tell you
that in two or three prominent agri-
cultural journals has it already been
written up, but may we hope that
the last shall be better than the
first.
I ply Mr. Kerr with questions,
and he is too courteous not to reply.
The original owner of this neat little
property was Mr. Blow, formerly
squatter, of Myrniong, for years
called Blows Flat, a cousin to that
elevation not too distant from Bal-
larat called Mount Blowhard.
In that great calamity. Black
Thursday, Mr, Blow was one of the
greatest sufferers locally, being com-
pletely burnt out; a part of the run,
what is now called “Morven,” the
squatter in question had bought as
a freehold.


Mr. Kerr took possession of the
property in 1885, and so far as im-
provements were concerned there
was none; but the father of the pre-
sent owner saw its possibilities,
bought it, and handed it over to his
son. “Morven” then consisted of
13 6 acres ; now it contains 500 to
600. A recent purchase has made
the increase from 400 to what now
obtains.
Mr. Kerr’s flat is quite equal in
value to the best land in the Marsh
further down, and that the highlands
were bought at £2 6/10/ per acre
just recently gives some idea of the
goodness of the soil. Those high-
lands seem to me to be somewhat
bereft of verdure ; but I am assured
by Mr. Kerr that as a matter of fact
they are very fattening ; the seed
dropped is of a most nutritious na-
ture, and he instanced selling two
young fat stock in the very prime
of condition the day previous at a
high price. Facts are stubborn
things.
I noticed that the lucerne crops
are particularly strong looking,
equal to anything lower down in
the Marsh. I am anxious to know
the cause, because in the one case
there is the regular , water supply.
Mr. Kerr tells me that for an aver-
age of two months the Lerderderg
goes dry ; but a thunder storm may
cause an occasional freshet in the
river. Anyhow, there were ■ the
crops looking beautiful, and I am
Wondering whether all these herder-
derg flats are not subject to a bene-
ficial drift.
When Mr. Kerr said that the Ler-
derderg goes dry for two months in
the year, I thoroughly understood
that he meant it ceased its contin-
uous flow for that period, for 1 ob-
served water-holes, and the fact that
fishing for black fish is a favorite
pastime with many Marsh anglers
at this time of the year proves that
waterholes abound in bed of river.
Mr. Kerr has had a wide exper-
ience, and his opinion is that in
irrigation matters the State should
go slowly—that present extent of
Population hardly justifies too lavish
an expenditure in this direction.
The local historian was just about
to hazard a conjecture that irriga-
tion facilities might attract the heav-
ier population; but as I did not
want to divert Mr. Kerr from his
line of thought, I bottled up the
precious conjecture for use on some
future occasion.
Mr. Kerr may fairly claim to be
a pioneer of irrigation; indeed, he
must be recognised as an expert, for
he has been called upon to visit
other parts of the State to report as
to their suitableness for irrigation,
besides giving evidence before cer-
tain Boards.
“Morven” has - had visitors from
South Africa and South America.
The most novel visit was that of a
party from Uruguay, who were ac-
companied by Mr. Temple Smith, of
the Agricultural Department. Not
one of the party could speak Eng-
lish, and Mr. Smith had to interpret.
I remarked to Mr. Kerr on the
fine appearance of his lucerne. It
was well in flower, and the foliage
of a deep color. The aroma from
the plant made the a'ir redolent with
perfume. It is just glorious to walk
through a heavy lucerne crop.
The plant has a peculiar softness,
and there is such consistency of
growth; it stretches all around you
an even surface of a refreshing
green, and you have knowledge how
profitable it is.
You see the sleek dairy herd, and
in close association in your mind
are those interminable cans o,f milk
wending their way to the milk fac-
tories. You can’t count the ribs of
the horse who draws the vehicle ;
he, too, participates in this product
of nature’s bounty.
Mr. Kerr properly opens out on
the subject. Your Bacchus Marsh
dairyman knows lucerne from top
to bottom ; is acquainted with every
peculiarity of its growth; it is to
him as the orchid to the gentleman
gardener.
Mr. Kerr speaks with much em-
phasis in response to my enquiries.
First of all we get on to irrigation.
I am told that irrigation can only
be a success on small holdings. The
application of water- to soil is expen-
sive, and the return from the soil
is so multiplied and labor is so dear
that the industry must be reduced
to family work; that is, it must be
done on small holdings. There are
three fine, stalwart sons on Morven,


who are interested in the develop-
ment of the property.
Mr. Kerr states that he knows
every inch of Victoria, and a good
deal of some of the other States ;
that he had seen the irrigable parts
of Victoria ; but he must give the
palm—not because his home was in
the locality—to Bacchus Marsh.
My informant looks at the subject
scientifically. He says that the first'
essential in all application of water
to soil is to be able take it off the
soil or through the soil. Mr. John
Cunningham, another successful lu-
cerne grower, says that such is a
truism in irrigation economics. The
Bacchus Marsh land is so splendidly
drained in a natural manner that
there is no expense incurred in re-
moving surplus water. You have no
bogs, as of Quid Oireland.
Then, continued Mr. Kerr, there
is the fertility of the soil. Please
do not accord the scribe credit for
all the wealth of irrigation and lu-
cerne detail. I am only giving you
a rescript or digest of what passed
at the table as we sipped our after-
noon cup of tea, dispensed by Mr.
Kerr’s daughters.
The fertility of the soil was su-
perb ; it was composed of the wash-
ing of volcanic elements, which un-
doubtedly helped to build up the
richest plant food that could be ob-
tained. The water, on account of
the porous character of the soil,
necessarily required to be carried
by some method to the spot where
it is to be applied. The experience
of the Bacchus Marsh grower was
that canvas hose was the best for
the purpose.
In the matter of irrigation there
are two schools in the Marsh. One
believes in sectional grading, the
other in the canvas hose with a due
observance of grading. Mr. Kerr
expresses himself freely. Sectional
grading is right enough when you
are applying water for grazing pur-
poses, but multiplicity of levels is
found to be an obstacle for culti-
vation. On account of the porous
nature of the country, you have to*
make the sections so small, and
therefore that multitude of eleva-
tions already referred to for im-
pounding of water.
In cutting, the growth the ma-
chine has to work over embank-
ments. This is detrimental to the
machine. Swamping the land is all
very well for grazing purposes, btit
when you come to intense culture
an over-abundance of water is npt
advantageous, for the simple reason
that you drown the crops, or you
are spoiling one portion for the
benefit of another.
Undoubtedly grading is essential
to irrigation. By grading your land
you distribute the water more evenly,
and more than that, you control the
supply, and just give to land what
it requires. Without grading it is
very palpable that you have no con-
trol, for by a natural law water will
seek the' lowest level, and the de-
pressions are thus Inundated.
I tell Mr. Kerr that his exposi-
tion is as plain as the nose on one’s
face. Probably I shall interview
Mr. John Wills, who is an exponent
of sectional grading, and w§ will
have his presentment of the case.
I ask, what is the best kind of
lucerne ? Hunter River, because in
every way it has proved the most
profitable ; it seems to have become
more acclimatised than the others.
It grows far more quickly and gives
longer season. Peruvian ranks next;
but French Province lies six weeks
dormant before Hunter River, and
takes two or three weeks longer in
getting off the mark in spring.
Five to six crops are taken off
every season ; average yield of dry
hay, 30-cwt. per acre ; prices varying
from 50/ to £6. The bulk of the
lucerne is used as fodder for dairy
cattle, and the surplus is sold, and
there is always some surplus. If
you keep the stack damp-proof lu-
cerne improves with age, and it has
immunity from mice and any other
pests, which cannot be said for cer-
eal crops.
The conversation drifts to the
splendid patch of lucerne on the
other side of the swing bridge. Mor-
ven is on both sides of the river,
and the bridge must be particularly
serviceable in winter. Mr. Kerr ac-
counts for the fine character of his
crops by the care which he ever ex-
ercises. The paddocks are kept
clean. Foreign growth is disagree-
able to lucerne. Let weeds and
grass take possession, and your lu-


cerne will pack up its kit and clear
out.
To make lucerne long-lived, the
proper treatment is to graze it as
little as possible. There is a couple
of months in the year that to feed
off it is no detriment, but at least
once a year the growth should he
allowed to pretty well mature —that
is, it should be allowed to get well
out in flower. For some reason or
other, it seems to get reinvigorated.
People have got a wrong idea that
you can’t cut lucerne too often, but
it is a well-known fact that you can
kill any plant by too much cutting.
In regard to the plant being allowed
to mature there is deterioration in
that there is produced a woodiness ;
but the' advantage is that you pro-
long the life of the plant by six or
eight years.
I am informed that lucerne was
cultivated in Mexico 200 years ago,
and Mr. Kerr avers that lucerne
properly treated should last 20 years.
He himself has lucerne patches which
have survived such length of time.
Under irrigation you get abnor-
mal growth, and by over cutting you
so weaken the plant that ultimately
a dry rot sets in in the crown of the
plant. The consequence is you lose
your lucerne patch. Heavy irrigation
undoubtedly shortens the life of the
plant.
Evidently Mr. Kerr had not ex-
hausted his special knowledge of the
subject ;■ every inquiry only elicited
explanations, but the fine dairy herd
attracts my attention, and we dis-
course thereon ; that is, Mr. Kerr is
the dominant speaker, and the local
historian the passive receiver.
A man who has taken prizes regu-
larly in stock at the Royal Agricul-
tural Show ought to know. what a
beast is. Mr. Kerr would vote every
time for a purebred Shorthorn of
the milking strain. He has a strong
opinion that a Shorthorn type of
milking cattle will have ultimately
to be adopted in this State. Year
by year the, country is getting cut
up into small holdings, and for that
reason our meat supply will have to
be drawn from the farmers ; former-
ly large stations were the source.
Thus as small, holdings were becom-
ing the general rule, and dairying
i§ an essential part of welfare of
small holders, a duel purpose animal
would have to be produced.
It was all very well having in view
a pure dairy animal, but is is an un-
doubted fact that along with milk
you must have meat. The animals
bred for milking purposes are in no
way suitable for the butcher, and
we are educating ourselves to eat
inferior meat, and the milking aspect
is the main consideration at present.
Mr. Kerr states that some people
argue that Shorthorns can never be
made milk-producers. This he posi-
tively denies. He has been dairying
all his life, and has tried all breeds
of milk producers, and his firm con-
viction is that Shorthorns properly
bred for milking purposes stand out
an easy first. Mr. Kerr added that
his judgment was not mere guess-
work, but based on experience, for
the milk from every cow on his pro-
perty was carefully measured, accur-
ately tested every season.
It was a profitable afternoon, and
by the time the interview was over
tea was announced, and the inter-
viewer was invited to remain. It
was a happy company, and the fresh
air had proved a stimulus to one’s
appetie.
I must close. Morven is undoubt-
edly a model farm ; not that it is
pretentious, spectacular; but it is run
on a system, and I thank my friend,
Mr. James Kerr, heartily for having
extended an invitation to visit his
homestead, which is so educational
at every turn.
“Ijerderuerg Park.”
Lerderderg Park has a history.
This property was originally pur-
chased by the father of the late Mr.
Thomas Cain, from the grandfather
of the present Clarke family. That
was in 1850. It was managed and
run for a period of 30 years by the
late Thomas Cain whose possession
it became.
Then sold to the late Donald Wal-
lace, who turned it into a stud farm,
making it the home of the celebrat-
ed Carbine, who has greater fame
than even Kings and Princes ; “that
Kings for such a death would wish
to die.” Not altogether out of con-
nection.
I would quote the story of the
little boy at Flemington, who, asked


by the school inspector what was
“Modesty,” said “it was a bay mare
by Tim Whiffler.”
I have referred to Carbine. I
might mention something perhaps
not uninteresting. When in New
Zealand Mr. Wallace went to a sale,
intending to purchase a certain horse,
hut the animal reaching a higher
price than he expected, he content-
ed himself by buying one at a lower
figure, and a fortunate misfortune
thus led to the acquisition of Car-
bine, whose famous performances
have been even more sung than the
heroic and self-sacrificing deeds of,
say, Gordon, the Martyr of the Sou-
dan. Here is the sober local his-
torian, who never knows the winner
of a Caulfield, Derby, or Melbourne
Cup : yet when the stranger accosts
us we point to Lerderderg Park and
instance as the greatest character-
istic of the hamlet, that down yonder
in that clump of trees rested the
greatest racehorse that was ever
under the Australian sun.
As I wander through the property,
there, with every promise of great
things, is a noble son of Carbine,
a yearling,- imported by Messrs.
Baillieu, owners of Almissa ; it is
now grazing at the home of its
great progenitor, the said redoubt-
able Carbine.
When Mr. Wallace died the es-
tate passed into the hands of Mr.
Sproule, who again sold it to Mr.
C. V. M'Arthur. Mr. M'Arthur re-
vived ancient history, for he again
turned the property into a stud
farm, which it remains to the pre-
sent day.
Mr. John Wills was the last pur-
chaser. This gentleman had done
well in South Gippsland, and it was
his intention of in Queens-
land, but as he passed through Mel-
bourne Lerderderg Park was brought
under his notice, and after due in-
spection he was a ready buyer. He
has sub-divided and sold a large
portion of the estate, on which 14
families are already settled. He has
retained about 100 acres. This is
now the stud farm, and, judging
by the improvements which are go-
ing on, I think it Is Mr. Wills’ am-
bition to make it the model stud
farm of the State.
In order to accomplish this end,
the owner is grading the whole of
the surface of the land, and really
it will be a subject for the artist's
brush to picture a sleek, graceful
blood stallion grazing in a three-
quarter acre with box attached, with
its beautiful sward of lucerne or
prairie grass like a bowling green
kept perpetually fresh by regulated
irrigation, each paddock having its
check bank, and dense border of
growth sheltering animal from in-
clemency of weather.
The land in the Lerderderg runs
bn an average of £BS per acre ; to
carry out his grading process Mr.
Wills is putting on another £2O per
acre. Probably if grading were done
by contract it would mean an extra
£4O per acre, but Mr. Wills is a
worker as well as organiser. He is
expert with the theodolite, marks
out the levels and carries on active
superintendence.
As I mentioned in article dealing
with. Mr. James Kerr's farm, Mor-
ven, there was a difference of opin-
ion as to the best way of irrigating
the land, but is it not proverbial
that doctors differ ? and the battle
over the better process is now being
fought.
Mr. Wills is comparatively a new
comer, but he believes in exercising
his own judgment, and is convinced
that sectional grading is the proper
thing, and he is spending that £2O
per acre on every inch of his pro-
perty. I have already seen won-
drous change, for an acre of billa-
taong and most uneven country has
now all the appearance of a gentle-
man’s domain, and great is the
growth of the prairie. Seven acres
with particularly undulating surfaces
are now a series of lawns of differ-
ent levels, and comparatively easy
is the application of water by which
such prolific growth is secured.
Am I asking too much that you
should refresh your mind with those
arguments, which Mr. James Kerr,
of Morven, has advanced against
sectional grading, and just read now
Mr. Wills’ presentment of the case.
James Kerr believes in grading,
but not sectional grading, preferr-
ing to use hose to distribute water.
Mr. Wills, on the other hand, con-
siders such a system to be out of
date. It might have had reason on


ats side before, hut it certainly has
not since the -establishment of the
Pyke’s Creek, water supply.
Mr. Wills j contends that failure
in the hosing system is too much
waste of water and too slow in the
application. Hence his reasons for
preferring sectional grading, as un-
der the scheme of sections it is pos-
sible to handle a far larger volume
of .water with much greater econ-
omy, and this economy is interpreted
as saving 5.0 per cent, of water and
75 per cent, in labor of application.
When it is remembered that the
compulsory charge is £1 per , acre
foot, and every subsequent foot used
is 10/ per acre foot and used to the
value of £3 per acre, it will be seen
that a 50 per cent, saving is a very
strong factor in economical manage-
ment.
I have no trouble in following
Mr. Wills’ exposition ; I had none in
listening to Mr. Kerr. Both gentle-
men are quite positive that they,
individually, hold the right end of
the stick, but Mr. Wills as the in-
novator has to establish the super-
ior worth of his innovation. That
will require time, but he is making
an experiment, in which the Marsh
lucerne grower is naturally greatly
interested, and the result may yet
revolutionise methods that have had
general adoption since lucerne has
been regularly grown here as a fod-
der.
Mr. Wills is quite prepared to ad-
mit the loss of time in the mowing
of the crops, since the sections, be-
ing about 3-acre, it stands to rea-
son that the machine will not cut
as many acres per day as it would
when engaged upon reasonably sized
paddocks from 10 acres upwards.
All this is granted as against sec-
tional grading, but advantages other-
wise make up the leeway and go a
great deal beyond.
Mr. Wills institutes another basis
of comparison of two methods of
watering, that a man with hosing
will barely cover 2 acres in 2 4 hours,
but under sectional system he can
easily, according to volume of water
supplied from Pyke’s Creek reser-
voir, do from-10 to 12 acres per
day. Mr. Wills estimates cost of
■water by hosing, allowing men 1/6
Per hour, to be 12/6 per acre and
sectional treatment at 2/ per acre.
So in his opinion the saying in the
cost of water and application
amounts to £2 per acre per annum.
It is a battle of the irrigation
giants, men who are dealing with
the water probably .every day dur-
ing the season, and know what they
are talking about. Mr. Kerr’s laboy
is his own family ; Mr. Wills has to
employ labor; but in-either case a
saving would be a saving whether
expenditure goes into a family or
out of a family.
Mr. Wills is making great Changes
in Lerderderg Park. I observe this
as I walk around viewing those
yearlings, one of which, may some
day appropriate a Caulfield Stakes,
a Derby blue ribbon, or a Mel-
bourne Cup. They are prancing
about on those Sections of rich fod-
der, skipping over checkbanks, or
standing with nostrils distended and
mane streaming at the appearance
of a stranger.
I have listened with only too wil-
ling an car to that plea that horse-
racing is demoralising, but there
are views .of Australia’s alleged Sa-
turnalia, that you do- not get on the
racecourse. I see that racing is al-
most an industry ; labor ■is largely
employed, coin is freely circulated
and. your racehorse-owner is really
in many cases a fine fellow, and in
a chat with him you are struck with
certain outstanding characteristics.
Then there is the breeding of the.
finer animal, and, my dear fellow,
every individual that runs a horse
is not a rogue, and there are plenty
of humbugs that go to church and
piously carry up the collection plate.
The world in its ideas of pleasure
is taking wider views ; it is that so
long as a sport is in itself pure we
have no right to damn it because
wrongdoing may become associated
with it. Why, the most harmless
relaxation under the face of Heaven
may be subjected to some sort of
taint. Rather let respectability pat-
ronise and indulge in all kinds of
rational pastimes, and roguery must
eventually make exit by the back
entrance.
I admire those graceful yearlings
—I suppose none of them could be
obtained under a thousand guineas
—and yonder, bless you! is the se-


date Uncle Sam, who looks a sprin-
ter inch of him, and years
ago did I not see Mooltan the fam-
ous : a quiet, demure sort of chap
who was friendly to an extreme,
coming up to the fence and allowing
you to rub his nose, affability itself.
Yet as we go into another box I
am told by the trainer to keep my
weather-eye open, as the vicious ten-
ant could kick through the eye of
a needle.
I couldn’t help moralising: same
with man, same with beast ; you
have all kinds of disposition ; some
genial, some disagreeable, some full
of fidelity, others ready to take you
down.
Evolutionist, I pray you, play this
as your trump-card. Mooltan was
geniality, Uncle Sam is a real good
sort, also Anna , I forget the
rest of her Russian name ; but that
ugly-tempered brute over yonder
would without the slightest warning
kick below the belt every time, and
do the Highland fling on your re-
mains if he were only allowed.
Mr. Wills has a great ideal. All
the old fences are passing away, and
the forests of Gippsland are laid
under contribution for the new. But
nothing does like the local box for
posts, and the supply is getting very
scarce, £8 per 100 delivered on the
ground. I notice particularly the
substantial character of fence being
erected ; but Mr. Wills recognises
that blood stock is only so much
capital, which must, as if in iron
safe, be kept secure. The fence is
high, and along the top rung a
cable, kept taut by means of eye-
bolt at end. Further protection is
aimed at by dividing fence being
double.
In speaking of grading, and sta-
ting approximate price of improve-
ment at £2 0 per acre, I trust read-
ers will not think that the local his-
torian is pulling the long bow ; but
you can’t fill depressions and billa-
bong for nothing. Mr. Wills has ob-
literated depressions of from 5 to
15 feet deep. One, five chains long,
averaged 36 yards wide by 7 feet
tfeep. In addition there were the bil-
labongs to be operated upon with
most tortuous windings. In one por-
tion of 41 acres, 18 chains of billa-
bong had to be filled up before level-
ling processes commenced.
Many folk that peruse the descrip-
tion wonder where the great quan-
tity of earth could be got ; but the
whole level is simply lowered, and
when I say that surface soil is
stripped to a depth of 4 feet, and
sustenance is still afforded to a
strenuous lucerne crop, it will help
to convey some idea of the richness
of the deposit which makes Bacchus
Marsh the cynosure of all eyes, to
the producer of the parched North
as the Garden of Eden.
Mr. Wills has a happy knack of
just saying what he thinks, and, I
may add, he has the prospect of be-
coming a capable platform speaker,
cogent in argument, and fertile in
illustrative resource.
He says that before the Marsh
comes to its own his treatment must
be general ; that is, Lerderderg Park
must not be isolated, and he can
see nought but that with the coming
generation hosing will pass away.
I wish I could produce a florid
passage that fell upon my ears. The
older must give way to newer and
more virile blood before the Marsh
will develop its possibilities, and
there must be the unqualified prac-
tical appreciation of that bountiful
water scheme which Mr. Elwood
Mead has by his far-seeing discern-
ment, conferred for all time upon
the Marsh Valley.
The sober local historian felt in-
clined to fling up his hat at the
purple patch, for Mr. Wills honestly
can regard Mr. Elwood Mead as
nothing else than the irrigation
evangel of the State. I may be per-
mitted to add my quota. I have
lived in the Marsh some five years,
and the locality has gone along by
leaps and bounds under the Elwood
Mead regime. The Marsh should
be as a first love to Mr. Mead, for
the Pyke’s Creek scheme was the
first undertaking recommended by
him on being appointed to his pres-
ent position.
Is the water charge relatively ex-
cessive ? It is patent to the impartial
onlooker, taking the small cost of
railway carriage into consideration,
also the rapidity with which people
can get their water after ordering
it, as compared with delay in con-
nection with huge schemes of the


North, that it is the cheapest water
supplied to the land in any part of
the State.
At Lerderderg Park there are no
fewer tljan 10 valuable blood sires
recuperating, and the value of horse-
flesh often runs up between £15,000
and £2 0,000, and at times there is
in attendance a little army of re-
tainers. There are 96 loose-boxes,
plenty of accommodation being af-
forded for mares and geldings.
It appears that Mr. Wills grows
both lucerne and prairie grass, as a
field and Flemington swear by prair-
ie-fed horses ; hence both kinds of
fodder are provided.
Mr. Wills' management is seen In
the constant supply of manure for
the paddocks. He has a large pit
into which refuse straw from stables
is placed, and on this a spray is
constantly playing, thus expediting
the rotting. The pit holds 100 tons.
The spray is fed from three tanks
placed one above the other, and into
the top tank the Water is forced by
a 4J-h.p. engine from the Lerder-
derg.
The paddocks are liberally dress-
ed with lime, and Coimadal lime
kilns are close handy. On the pro-
perty I notice a nbble elm 4J-feet
through the trunk, and a chain
across the foliage.
Mr. Wills is able, enterprising,
and it is a certainty that ultimately
he must be regarded as one of the
strongest men in the community.
Mr. Hodgson’s Reminiscences.
I get back again into early his-
tory. Mr. Henry Hodgson is very
Interesting, as his memory is tenac-
ious. In the early fifties he came
straight out with his parents from
North of England to Melbourne.
The capital of the State then did
not give much promise of becoming
the Queen City of the South that
she was destined to be. Streets were
laid out, but not much formation
undertaken. Collins street hill had
not been cut down. When the river
rose, the water backed up, and boats
could go up the gully, which is now
Elizabeth street; planks being laid
across here and there in narrow
Parts of the current for any pedes-
trian traffic. Cattleyards were at
the end of Elizabeth street. There
was no pier, but a landing place at
Leharditz Beach, somewhere about
the locality of Port Melbourne.
Governor Latrobe landed there. Only
a track to Melbourne; all bush right
down to the water’s edge. The jetty
was really some stakes driven in,
and saplings laid across. Only one
house down on beach, a sort of hotel,
a shabby little place. Ships lay off
the shore about a couple of miles;
a small steamboat conveyed luggage
up the Yarra. Fellow passengers
were the Sargood family ; one son,
Fred, afterwards became very prom-
inent in State life ; he founded a
big business, was elected to Legis-
lative Council, and knighted Sir
Frederick Sargood. Fred’s first bil-
let was office boy in a Government
building in King or William street.
We came up to the Marsh in a
horse dray, with emigrant boxes, no
furniture of any sort. The journey
was not too disagreeable, a long day
in middle of summer. The hill as
we came into the Marsh was most
dangerous, had to tie both wheels.
You ask what made family seek the
Marsh. My father happened to fall
in with a Mr. Young, who was a
prominent resident of the district
In those days, and he recommended
the Marsh as a suitable place to
settle in. My father accompanied
Mr. Young on horseback. The first
house we occupied was a brick cot-
tage where now stands the new
buildings of Rocke, Tompsitt & Co.,
in the Main street, the remains of
the old cottage were just pulled
down the other day, to make way
for the new structure. I have said
that the hill leading into the Marsh
was very dangerous. A road down
Stumpey Hill, a mile north of An-
thony’s Cutting, was found, and
came into general use. My father
was returning from Melbourne on
one occasion, and as he was going
down the hill after dark the cart
upset, and he lay all night uncon-
scious. He recovered about day-
light, and found the horse was still
attached to the cart by some of the
harness. He managed to get it
righted, collected his goods, and got
home without further mishap. I
have mentioned James Young. He
was a miller, and lived in the house
which still stands at the back of


the mill. Mr. Young kept a store in
the building wjidre Mr. T. Anderson
now lives. Mr, Kerr occupied it af-
terwards. „ A slab stable stood near
the east end . of .mill, and it was car-
ried away in, a flood, caused by the
Werribee overflowing its banks just
below the water, channel in Mr.
Grant’s paddock. It was quite usual
for the river, to. overflow at every
great downpour above the Concen-
trated Milk Factory, filling those de-
pressions which can still be seen be-
tween the river and the Main road,
from Grant street down to the Wool-
pack. The course of the overflow
was through where Edwards’ forge
now stands, across Church street at
"Express Office,” across Cell street
below "Inglewood,” along where
Chamber’s buildings are now situat-
ed, through the Mill grounds, back
north again across road from Pater-
son’s to Heath’s, thence across Young
street through back yards, through
Barradell’s allotment, into Mhh-
oney’s ground, back across the road
into Geo. Ramsey’s, finally finding
its way back into the Werribee in
Tuilarnore paddock. Two brothers,
Edward and John. Clarke, had land
east of Mr. T. G. Pearce. Most of
land west of Mr. Pearce’s holding
belonged to a settler called Fisken.
I think he was a relative of late Mr.
J. O. Inglis. The first racecourse
was south of Mr, T. Pearce’s. The
Manor House jwas. built before he
came. The Portland road went
where Lerderderg is now, and in-
clined north, thence up the hill in
Vallence’s coming . out on to pre-
sent road, crossed the. KorkuperriV
mul near Condon’s, and followed- up
the gully, striking the present road
at Meikle’s. This^track avoided all
the hills and cuttings used at pres-
ent to get through the Box Forest.
I ply Mr, Hodgson with questions.
A little wheat was grown about the
district, and the old mill was pui
to work when the grain was brought
in. The dual capacity uf the mill,
being utilised on the Sabbath as a
church, was referred to, but this
has already been described. The
Main street was just a bush road,
a certain amount of traffic passing
through, teams going up country
with goods. There was no footpath,
this was quite a modem arrange-
ment. There was a big rise in tront
of Grant street was not
formed, the land for that road was
given conjointly by Mr. Grant
(father of present Mr. Grant, of
Miilbank), and Mr. Pilmer, owner
of ground from Grant street to mill.
Throughout the district were large
settlers —Messrs. Molesworth Greene,
Griffiths, Labeliere, and others. Not
much produce. In all I should
think 100 inhabitants, in scattered
dwellings. No bridges, and the
mailman (wii,h mail at first weekly),
then twice and later thrice a week)
George Lodge, father of Joseph
Lodge, carried the mail on horse-
back, and he lived in a hut on side
pf hill near Symington’s, Hopetoun.
The site of dwelling was dug out
of side of hill. The excavation is
still to be seen. Often when he ar-
rived at Marsh he couldn’t deliver
the mail for want of daylight, and
impassibility of roads during win-
ter, particularly In time of flood.
The Woolpack was a hut, and a
few outbuildings of same class. Mr.
J. E. Crook was lessee. Mr. James’
house was in existence ; remains
back in paddock S.W. of Woolpack.
There was no other building till
you came,to Maifbr House, owned
by Captain Bacchus. He had died
just previously, and was buried in
Anglican cemetery. Shortly after
we came to the Marsh Captain Bac-
chus’ son was married to Miss Hob-
bler, whose parents lived at present
residence of Mr. Percy M'Farlane,
the old homestead of Hobbler family.
They left for the gold fields.
About this time gold had been
found in the State, and had not
been made public. ' The first gold
I heard of. having been found was
at ■ Ararat. This was discovered in
digging a race for a small flour
mill on a station. Singular to state,
when we were in London waiting
for our ship to sail, we heard that
there had been discovery of gold,
but when arrived in Melbourne
no such thing was heard of. Father
came out under the auspices of Dr.
Dunmore Lang, he was a Presby-
terian Minister in Queensland, and
fostered immigration. He had been
twice out to Australia, and he was
on board ofir ship with his family.
On-rbyage he interested passengers


very much with his descriptions of
Australia, he used to deliver ad-
dresses on the subject. Naturally
he was most interested in Queens-
land, being specially eloquent over
the Darling Downs. On the ship
there were four ministers, and 20
students. A few of these remained
in Melbourne, but bulk went on to
Queensland. I remember the names
of the ministers—Revs. R. M'Nicol,
Gibson, O’Dei, and Gotul.
Mr. Grant, father of present pos-
sessor, was residing on Millbank.
There wasn’t a church. Several
years elapsed before first land was
thrown open, commencing on top of
Stamford Hill, and sold by auction
in Melbourne. The flat was all pri-
vate property. The land known as
Connell’s was formerly owned by
Lady Franklin, wife of the great
explorer, granted as recompense for
his services. The land which Mr.
Mahoney, father of Mr. Con. Ma-
honey, acquired was given to him
in lieu of cash for work done at
wharf known as Cole’s on Yarra at
foot of Spencer street. The original
holding extended further east, and
also included a good bit of land on
other side of road and the home-
stead, that is, hut, barn and stock-
yard, was located somewhere about
the present residence of Mr. Geo.
Ramsey. There were no houses at
Hopetoun. The diggings broke out
and my father, T. C. Hodgson, who
was a baker, was kept doing his
utmost. He had to carry the bread
Up to Korkuperrimul Creek on
tramp, 100 people at a time camping
there. After five years’ close pur-
suit of his business, he purchased
his farm on Pentland Hills. The
Border Inn was a small weather
board building, built by Pilmore,
pn site of present two-storied build-
ing. Later on, brick and plaster
wings were added, and later still
the present brick building took
Place of the weather board section,
stood between. The M'Leod’s,
a noted Scotch family, occupied sta-
tion at Goodman’s Creek. They
Presented a large number of books
to the Mechanics’, with their coat
°f arms. The men were great
s Ports, rode fine jumping horses,
Pover stopped to open a panel or
Sate, but swept over brush or chock
and fences in great style.
I regret my interview with Mr.
Hodgson was abruptly terminated.
Unfortunately, I had delayed my visit
until the night before his departure
for Queensland, but possibly inci-
dents of early Bacchus Marsh history
may yet come to his mind, which is
to the advantage of the community
to have chronicled.
A thought occurs to me, and it is
this, that it is only by dipping into
the past that a community becomes
aware of deeds done in the interests
of public welfare. Otherwise they
would vanish into deepest obscurity.
The benefaction of Messrs. W. Grant
and Pilmer in granting land for
Grant street certainly should not be
forgotten. In view of such a high-
way of local traffic and convenience,
the memory of these public bene-
factors should indeed smell sweet.
They have passed away, but their
works do follow them.
Mr. O’Keefe’s Memoirs.
Young Mr. O’Keefe is certain that
his uncle knows much of the early
history of Bacchus Marsh. I make
a visit. I call .on his parents first.
Mrs. D. O’Keefe is one of the well-
known Kelly family, of Werribee.
Captain Kelly, who lost his life in
the Boer War, was a brother, and
the testimony forthcoming from all
quarters was that he died like a
soldier. Mr. O’Keefe settled at
Rowsley in the early sixties. The
country was covered with dense
scrub ; only bush and log fences.
A fair number of men were employ-
ed by the large landowners of the
district —Messrs. Molesworth Greene,
Staughton and Chirnside —in build-
ing stone fences. These were to be
found as far as Geelong road on the
other side of Bald Hill. Shepherds
were necessary to protect the sheep
from dingoes, &c. On the runs of
Mr. Staughton were large mobs of
Hereford cattle, and young half-bred
Arab horses. Mr. O’Keefe, when he
first settled, visited the homestead
of Mr. Staughton for the purpose of
buying cattle, but the Herefords were
so wild that he could not think of
purchasing them. Mr. Staughton
had the reputation of being very
generous. Though no business was
done, he offered Mr. O’Keefe a fine


Shropshire ram. The Arab horses
were shortly afterwards sold. Mr.
O’Keefe gave a graphic description
of Maddingley hill, as it appeared
in those early days. It was an ab-
solute forest, and when driving
sheep into the Marsh he always
dreaded them getting into the thick
scrubby country (where Mrs. Sloss
and others live now) as their re-
covery was almost impossible.
In the district there was a certain
enclosure, which had quite local no-
toriety—the Quarantine where dur-
ing times of drought and pleura,
cattle were turned in to die. Mr.
O’Keefe has vivid recollections of a
drought which occurred a few years
ago, when he had to send his herd to
Coornmill, but there were bigger
droughts in earlier days, to which
his recent one could bear no compar-
ison. Blacks were accustomed to
call frequently at the home, but evi-
dently were perfectly harmless. One
day a lubra came, and carried a dog
in a blanket on her back, instead of
a picaninny. I ask about the dog-
traps. They were principally placed
in the gully known now as Dogtrap
Gully. They were conical in shape,
with opening at top, and roof so con-
structed that when the animal jump-
ed in to seize the bait it could not
get out.
Stories From Mr. Keefe.
I pass on to the uncle. Mr. P.
Keefe was for years in charge of
the Police Station at the Marsh, and
his memory is very keen. One bro-
ther prefixes “O” to his surname,
the other omits. Probably Mr. P.
Keefe can give good reason for the
omission, for I noticed that on the
table of his sitting room there are
many books that betoken he is of
studious turn. Some years ago Mr.
Keefe made a tour of the world, and
if report be true he did it on money
which had accumulated through a
resolution, consistently kept, to
place aside on deposit what he had
been accustomed to spend on tobacco.
I am not long with Mr, Keefe before
I find he has a mind of his own. I
admire such physical activity in one
so advanced in years, but in spite of
a somewhat strenuous interview, we
got on very well. I am certain that
the retired police officer could have
regaled me with many an incident
of personal bearing that occurred in
early Bacchus Marsh life, but which,
perhaps, had better remain in ob-
scurity. My purpose in writing this
series of articles is to trace the de-
velopment of the district, and only
matter that is of local historical value
should be chronicled. Mr. Keefe
asks me if I had heard of the ghost
of the Werrlbee Gorge, of the early
sixties. There had appeared in the
“Police Gazette” a notice that Dr.
Wilcox, of Egerton (who had been
an officer in the Indian army) was
missing. He was known to be of
eccentric habits, and in searching
for quartz reefs had left his home,
accompanied by a little brown dog.
The animal several times returned
to the doctor’s residence at Egerton,
and, dragging at the dresses of the
inmates, in its own way tried to
convey that help was needed. At
this time a large number of men
were making the Ballarat and Bac-
chus Marsh road on Pentland Hills.
A dispute occurred between two of
the workmen, and had such a term-
ination that on the police being
sent for one of them took shelter
in Brisbane Ranges. In passing
over the Werribee, .at the Gorge, he
heard a dog barking, and, going to
the place, found a- man lying help-
less, in a crevice, between two large
stones. The individual escaping
from the police had evidently in
mind his own safety, for he con-
tinued his journey, and as he was
passing over the plains met with one
of Mr. Molesworth Greene’s shep-
herds, Avhom he told what he had
seen. When the shepherd had yard-
ed his sheep for the night, he went
on to Glenmore station, and inform-
ed Judge Chomley of what had been
told him. The judge rode into the
police station at the Marsh and in-
formed the police. In the early
morning a trooper was sent to the
gorge. He searched about, but could
only find the remains of a few de-
serted fires, and some parts of a
plant known as pig’s face, which had
been roasted. Eventually, he heard
the barking of a dog, and he went
to the place where the sound came
from, and found the doctor between
the rocks in a helpless state. The
trooper made the injured man as


comfortable as possible, and hasten-
ed back to the station. Accompanied
by the Senior-constable, he returned
with blankets and brandy. It must
have been seven o’clock on a sum-
mer’s evening when they reached the
Gorge. The doctor was wrapped up
in a blanket, and tied upon the
trooper’s back, who had to climb a
distance of 6 00 yards to get to the
cart, which was to convey the in-
jured man to the Marsh. Dr. Bone
was in attendance, and remained
with Dr. Wilcox until he passed
away. Egerton must be 2 5 miles
from the Gorge. There is no know-
ing what became of the little brown
dog. Some say that he died on the
grave of his master in the Madding-
ley cemetery. There was a farmer
who lived close to the place of the
fatal misadventure, who, with his
dog, was accustomed to look for
sheep which wandered at night, and
being seen by some fearful traveller,
there arose the story of the “Ghost
of the Werribee Gorge.”
Mr. Keefe recounts his story very
well. We got on to cattle stealing,
and I am told there were some queer
cases. In the early sixties the Bac-
chus Marsh Trooper had occasion
to go to Woodend, about 30 miles.
When returning home in the after-
noon the trooper wore an old coat,
and was not distinguishable as a
police officer. As he came on by
the Breakneck into Coimadai he
noticed a man driving two head of
cattle. At his appearance the cattle
driver left the road for the beaten
track down Goodman’s creek. The
trooper also deviated, and met the
man face to face. The information
given on inquiry was that the two fat
bullocks had been got from the
herdsman of the Bacchus Marsh
Common, and were being taken to
the butcher’s at Gisborne. The
trooper’s suspicions were aroused,
and he suggested that the herdsman
should be interviewed, and went to
turn the bullocks, which were a
couple of chains away. While he
was doing so the man put spurs
to his horse, and galloped away.
The trooper followed, but his horse
being wearied with the long jour-
hey, the other soon disappeared in
the scrub of Pyrete Creek. The
trooper took the bullocks back to
the station, and one was claimed by
Mr. Staughton as one of a team
that had been given to a contractor
that was building a stone wall. The
other bullock found an owner. The
case was tried at Bacchus Marsh,
the herdsman being the accused.
Several witnesses were examined.
Police Magistrate and one J.P. on
the Bench. The P.M. suddenly be-
came ill, and had to leave the Bench.
The accused was acquitted, and the
man in whose possession bullocks
were was committed for trial at the
Supreme Court, Melbourne. Judge
Barry asked the police to explain
how it was that the herdsman had
been discharged. The reply was
that the J.P. had done so on ac-
count of local friendly influence (in
our days known as unconscious bias).
The J.P. threatened to sue the pol-
iceman for £I,OOO, for defamation
of character. The policeman threat-
ened to get the J.P’s. name struck
off the roll. But the affair termin-
ated with parties in amicable spirit.
Policeman and J.P. became great
friends, and agreed to live and let
live. Mr. Staughton sold his bullock
for* 20 guineas, the other realised
14. The accused was discharged.
Mr. Keefe gives a wealth of detail,
but I have to abbreviate on account
of pressure of space. Mr. Keefe
uses some fine rounded sentences,
but reluctantly I omit to record the
ornate expression. Another . case is
a valuable saddle and bridle were
stolen from Mr. Daniel, a shepherd
of Mr., Molesworth Greene, at Ballan.
One Sunday the Senior-constable and
trooper of Bacchus Marsh station
went to make some inquiries rela-
tive to a man who was seen riding
across the run close to Daniel’s
hut, on day of theft. They got to
three-chain road, at Geelong finger
post. The trooper remarked to the
senior that there were fresh cattle
tracks on the road, and that they
might be run up. After a gallop of
a couple of miles, a man was seen
driving a mob of cattle. The senior
being in plain clothes went ahead,
the trooper remaining under the
cover of a tree. The result of the
interview was that the senior was
informed that the man was taking
his bullocks from, farm at Bungaree
to his other farm at Wyndham. The


police were aware of the man having
just before done a month in Mel-
bourne gaol for being found carry-
ing a sucking pig in a bag. He was
taken into custody. Communication
with the police at Ballarat resulted
in its being known that a Mr. Ed-
wards, in Ballarat district, had lost
15 bullocks. The accused was com-
mitted for trial at Supreme Court,
Melbourne. The counsel for defence
was the celebrated Mr. Aspinal, and
Mr. Keefe remembers to this day
the extraordinary ingenuity of the
appeal made on behalf of the pris-
oner. He spoke of the minions of
the law hounding down innocent
citizens, &c., &c., and the accused,
who had had something to do with
the military, was transformed by
counsel into a Waterloo veteran, and
now the victim of such ingratitude,
a hero who offered, if necessity had
been, to die for his country. The
accused was acquitted. The saddle
and bridle in his possession he
could give no satisfactory account
of ; doubtless the lost property of
Mr. Daniel. These were placed in
the Bacchus Marsh station for safe
custody, but the next morning they
had disappeared.
Mr. Keefe is very interesting, and
has the Hibernian neatness of vig-
orous and picturesque expression.
He has read to some purpose. He
has more incidents he declares up
the sleeve of his coat. He says he
will produce, conditional on the first
instalment being properly served up.
I hope that the recounting has not
rendered nugatory the promise'd ful-
filment.
Mr. Lodge Interviewed.
Mr. Joseph Lodge has led the
local Agricultural Imperialistic for-
ces so often to victory in those Royal
show campaigns—even though get-
ting a reverse, never dishonored ——
that I am glad to find that he is
able to make a contribution to our
subject. Mr. Lodge was born on
Maddingley hill, just behind the
railway station, and he has lived
his whole life in the district, and
has been an acute observer. I have
to admit that for purpose of writing
up the history of a locality the old
resident, with a good memory, is
invaluable to the chronicler. Many
have passed through most interest-
ing incident, but unhappily the
memory has been as a sieve, and
nought remains. In front of a
snug little domicile on Reservoir
Hill, we sit down on Sunday after-
noon to a profitable chat, only dis-
turbed later on by Mrs. Lodge
bringing in a snug little afternoon
repast. “Now, what do you want ?”
abruptly asks Mr. Lodge. I wish
to know I replied, all about the
blacks, what part they played in
early Bacchus Marsh life. Were
they a menace to public safety ?
Was Bacchus Marsh the meeting
ground for rival tribes, and was
there knowledge of fierce encounters
having taken place ? I have heard
that the Bacchus Marsh and the
Geelong blacks met in fierce en-
counter out at Parwan, and the Bac-
chus Marsh police were sent for,
but they kept at a distance, and
beat a hasty retreat. The informant
was so sure of his information that
he actually gave me the names of
the officers. But Mr. Lodge knew
nothing of the conflict. He was in
dined to think that such had never
occurred. I am told that three to
four hundred blacks used to camp
on the Marsh. There were three
camps—down near the gasworks, the
old showgrounds, and near the Rec-
tory, in front of Mr. Hodgson’s. In
the year 1860 Mr. Lodge estimated
that there were on the Marsh two
blacks to one white. In those days
he used to go to Morrison’s school,
located just behind Henry’s hotel.
The blacks would remain for a fort-
night, or month at the one stretch,
and then shift up to Yaloak Vale,
and work up Ballarat way, making
periodical visits to this locality while
doing so. It was not the same tribe
that came, but different tribes. The
blacks used to go round the houses
here begging a little tea, sugar,
clothing, and tobacco. They were
absolutely harmless: too lazy to be
otherwise. They could be seen lying
like helpless logs round a fire, and
always a small fire at that. Limited
as their intelligence was, they had
their own opinion of the white man’s
idea of making a fire —-“White fel-
low, big fool, him make big fire,
can’t get near it ; blackfellow him
make small fire, get close to it.”


Three or four times a year a big cor-
roborree was held on the old show-
grounds, and whites were invited.
The blacks used to color their
bodies and decorate their arms
and legs, and dance to noise by
gins rattling old kerosene tins. When
the affair was over they would col-
lect money from those around —a
"sickpen” being a great treasure. Mr.
Lodge has seen as many as 200 na-
tives lying in the water, known as
"Harry’s hole.” Picanninies used to
come and play with the children dur-
ing school hours,
Mr. Lodge gives a little of his
own personal history. In those days
there were no plush-covered go-carts,
and handsome cane perambulators.
Mr. Lodge in his infancy (like many
others on the Marsh) was wheeled
about in an up-to-date vehicle, con-
sisting of a gin box, neatly placed
on a couple of wheels, and a black
gin was employed to be the "nurse
girl.” The blacks were not without
bravery. Mr. Lodge remembers on
one occasion two stallions fighting
in the old show grounds, and a black
—he hailed from Queensland —was
the only one who would venture to
separate them. He succeeded with-
out getting any injury. The nat-
ural diet of the native was ’possum
and pig-face. The native method of
climbing a tree is well known—cut-
ting nicks on the tree just big
enough to get a toe in, and at least
3 feet apart, and then going on to
end of limb and chopping out the
opossum. It was thrown down to a
lubra, who would carry it to camp.
The skinning took place by means
of a piece of glass. The skin' was
stretched on a piece of bark, cut
from tree, and when dry was stit-
ched together with sinews got from
opossum or kangaroo’s tail, when
the latter were caught. ’Possum,
otherwise intact, was placed on coals
of fire and roasted, and when suffic-
iently cooked was taken out and
oaten with pigface or bread. Each
mia-mia had from one to three dogs,
mostly skin and bones, and they
Blade night hideous with their con-
stant howling apd yelping.
We, the Bacchus Marshites of
Present day, can scarcely believe
that behind the Post-office, in front
the C. of E. rectory there
was a big swamp, frequented, by
numerous wild duck, and as there
was no restriction on shooting in
those days, the swamp gave rise to
much sport. Mr. Lodge chats away,
and tells me that it was no unusual
thing in the evening of a hot day
to see as many as from 50 to 70
kangaroos coming down to the old
hole (now the lake in the Park)
from the bush at Parwan to drink.
They did not venture as far as the
Werribee, as country was too open.
All around the Maddingley slopes,
from Watson and Scott’s holdings,
right down to Millbank, was dense
scrub, very thickly studded with
black wattle, and when in flower
made a glorious sight. No wonder
the wattle has become the national
emblem of Australia. Many emus
were also to be found on Greene’s
Bald Hill. There was a resident
named Robert Clark, living near the
Woolpack, and it was a common
thing to see him out hunting kan-
garoos or emus ; getting near them,
he, would pull off his stirrup strap
and strike the game on the head
with the iron. Mr. Lodge dwells
with enthusiasm upon the appear-
ance of Maddingley Hills, which
must have been particularly beauti-
ful before civilisation came and des-
troyed the growth- of foliage.
No fences scarcely between Werri-
bee and Little River. What were
found were the stone walls of the
large landowners of the district,
with an odd fence. There was much
open country, and cattle used to
wander, their whereabouts being
known by a tinkling bell which was
attached to one of the herd. The
children of the house were told off
to bring in the cattle, and generally
barefooted, for every home was not
in a position to supply boots and
shoes to the family. I remark to
Mr. Lodge that there could have
been no compulsory clause in the
Education Act of those days. Mr,
Lodge smiles, for education had to
be paid for. It was not as in these
more favored times, thrown at the
parent’s head, and in some cases
unhappily not duly appreciated.
The Australian is called a "gum-
sucker” and Mr. Lodge’s explana-
tion of the origin of the term Is
that in those early days children


had little chance of getting sweets,
and it was a custom of the juveniles
to gather gum from the wattles,
and chew it. As a lad Mr. Lodge
earned his first money by doing cer-
tain work for the lay preacher (Mr.
Scott) of the old iron church. His
opinion of Mr. Scott was that he
was smart, intelligent, and earnest
in every way. He never dreamt that
the preacher would come to such a
tragic end.
In 1860 Blackwood diggings were
in full swing. There was much
carting by means of bullocks from
Geelong to the goldfields. Mr. Lodge
describes his first visit to Werribee,
on the occasion of the first review
in the State being held there. The
party consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Jas.
Dunn (commonly known as Ned
Dunn) forming one team, old Mr.
David Tyler and his wife, with the
lad Joe Lodge and his father and
mother, the second team ; and Geo.
Morley (brother of M,rs. Brown, of
Parwan) the third team. We get
an idea of the great celerity of loco-
motion in those days. The excur-
sion party for Little River left the
Marsh some time in the morning,
camped for dinner somewhere near
Daniell’s hut, in the vicinity of
Greene’s Bald Hill ; stopped for the
night at Ripley ; drove into Little
River the next day, and saw review.
It was the first time Mr. Lodge had
seen a train. Among the volunteers
Mr, Lodge saw Mr. J. E. Crooß
mounted on his old stager, W. H.
M'Farlane, Con. Mahoney, warlike
on old “Werribee,” also Mr. Peter
Robinson, bugler. The boy, Joe
Lodge, got very frightened at the
noise of cannon, and he clung on to
his father’s hand. One waggon
stayed at W’erribee while the others
went on to Geelong for loading.
Returning to Werribee the loads
were apportioned, and a start made
for the Marsh. Mr. Lodge went on
to say that he and his father accom-
panied David Tyler’s waggon to
Blackwood. They stopped at Phil-
lips’ on the Mount, to cut timber
to build a house on side opposite
station, which buliding remains to
this day. There was no metalling
on road ; the teams came across a
gentleman in abbot buggy stuck in
the mud, from which he was unable
to get out. Four bullocks were
hooked on, and horse and buggy
soon pulled out. Mr. Lodge men-
tioning these matters to show char-
acter of transport in early times.
A little family history is communi-
cated. Mr. Lodge’s father was told
off as a special constable at time of
Ballarat riots. Bullock drays (not
bullock waggons) were the mode of
transit, whether for carrying pas-
senger or load. Dozens of settlers
in the district lived by this means,
carting principally from Ballarat to
Melbourne. When Blackwood was
in full swing Chinamen used to
come down to the Marsh, and there
was great trade in fowls and pigs.
The Chinese used to carry the fowls
aliVe with legs tied, on bamboo
across shoulder, and weight balanced.
Pigs were driven by a string at-
tached to the leg. It will be read-
ily granted by those who have fol-
lowed up these articles that Mr. J.
Lodge’s recital has not been the
least interesting.
Penny Readings and Light Horse
Tales.
The name W. H. McFarlane is to
all intents and purposes familiar in
Bacchus Marsh. Cr. W. H. McFar-
lane, J.P., too, can go back a great
length of time into the life of this
community. He interests me with
an account of the balance of power
that obtained in the control of the
old denominational school. On the
Board, the Anglican and the Pres-
byterian representatives were equal
in voting power—four on each side.
Mr. T. Pearce was a Baptist, and
held -the balance of power, and Mr.
McFarlane was greatly amused as
he related the efforts that were made
by the two factors on certain mo-
mentous occasions to capture the
vote of Mr. Pearce, for in reality he
occupied a kind of dictatorship.
Mr. McFarlane has vivid memory
of the successful Penny Readings,
held in the old Mechanics’ Institute.
I ask him what prominent part did
he play in the entertainment. It
appears that he being a Scotchman,
a most responsible duty was assigned
him. He was the doorkeeper, and
had to gather in the pennies. Mr.
T. Cain, J.P., was always the Chair-
man, and invariably opened with a


good speech. Mr. O’Hara, Catholic
school teacher, father of Mr. J. B.
O’Hara, M.A., poet and principal of
S. Melbourne College, gave fine
readings. Mr. J. B. Crook’s special
items were a song and a step-dance.
He was very active on his feet, de-
spite that he carried weight (22-
stone). Mr. Cooper, Clerk of Courts,
was very acceptable : he principally
read. Peter Robinson, the ginger-
beer manufacturer, rendered phases
of Scotch character. The funny man
evidently was Mr. Harbord, Engi-
neer, who . had a very popular ditty
about “three blue bottles on a mile
stone.” It was sure to bring down
the house. Pianoforte accompani-
ment was considered superfluous :
concertinas were not even used.
Mr. McFarlane evidently was very
proud of that “military unit” estab-
lished in the Marsh, known as the
Prince of Wales’ Light Horse. There
were 70 in the troop, as stated in
a previous article. Cr. Molesworth
Greene, of Greystones, was the first
captain. Captain T. Pearce later
had a long reign. I read Mr. Mac-
Farlane’s commission. His outfit as
Lieutenant, which he has to this
day, involved some outlay, costing
not less than £4O, and the allow-
ance towards same was .only £3.
The tunic cost 14 guineas, the busby
6 guineas. There were three differ-
ent dresses. Private horses were
used for gun, allowance for same,
£1 per day,
A correspondent, who was a mem-
ber of the troop, writes as follows ;
The dress consisted of a scarlet
jumper, full made, and buttoned at
the waist, a dress similar to what
the Liberator of Italy wore. I
joined when the troop was formed.
We had over 60 members, and at
one time could mount two Cannon
and their accessories ; these required
eight horses, and were always placed
in position as the leading division,
Kyneton coming second, to the dis-
gust of the Melbourne troop. We
had a splendid instructor in the per-
son of Sergeant-Major Bowser, the
father of the M.P. for Wangar-
atta, and editor of one newspaper
of that town. He had been in the
Lancers, and drilled some of our
hien in military evolutions. The men
■did some excellent target shooting
under his instruction. The target
was near the late butts, on' the
Broadlands estate, and we fired the
old howitzers from the lane leading
from Miller’s bridge. The best shots
hit the hill somewhere, although
aimed at the target. Our drill
ground was between Young street
and the Manor House. James E.
Crook lived there. He was Quarter-
master, and the cannon, and the
gun harness were kept there. The
camps were held at Geelong, the
Werribee, Carisbrook, Kyneton, Sun-
bury, Melbourne, and Cheltenham,
where Trooper Heath nearly lost his
life. He and I were riding on the
limber, and were the leading gun,
going at the gallop. The grass was
very long, and we just missed a
stump, when Heath looked behind
to see if the next gun cleared it.
Just then his side wheel dropped
into a hole, and he was pitched off
his seat. In falling, his foot caught
between the wheel and the trace
bar, his head just touching the
ground. Thus hanging by one leg,
he was dragged 100 yards or more
before the horses could be pulled
up. When released, we found that
his leg was terribly torn, by the
wheel grinding it. He was taken
to the field hospital, where his leg
was dressed, and he was sent to
Melbourne hospital. Had his foot
not held in the limber, the wheel
following would have gone over
him, and crushed him to death, as
that part was loaded with the can-
non. Mr. Heath received compensa-
tion.
Jackson’s Creek, near Sunbury,
was the roughest place the troops
ever had to tackle, but no serious
accident happened, although men,
horses, and guns got capsized. One
of the camps, known as the wet
Werribee creek, was held on a large
open plain, not far from Chirnside’s
shearing shed. It was raining and
blowing a gale when we arrived,
and lots of the tents were down.
Five were allotted for our troop,
and as they were likely to fall, we
went to the firewood heap, and got
a lot of stakes, to drive into the
ground to try and keep the tents
up. One was blown down, and the
owners had to seek shelter along
with the others, and soon lots of


other poor fellows came begging to
be taken in. They had to be re-
fused. Their tents were down, so
they were recommended to go to the
woolshed. Soon there was a great
commotion at the horse lines. The
posts got pulled up, and the horses
were mixed in every way ; a good
deal of kicking was done, and any
number of animals were loose. It
was very dark, and the rain was
failing in torrents, which rendered
it unsafe to go among them, and the
owners were away to seek shelter at
the men’s homestead, so the horses
had to be left to look after them-
selves. There were 14 men in our
tent (6 or 8 at most was the com-
plement) so we were packed like
herrings, but managed to get some
sleep. I awoke to find something
hard in my mouth, which I found
was a spur, and the spur was on the
heel of a boot, and the boot was on
the leg of Bowser ! I was sorry to
disturb him, and ask him to move
his legs the least bit, if he could
find room to do so. By daylight the
storm had passed, and when we
looked around our four tents were
the only ones standing. About 50
horses, out of several hundred, were
so entangled in the ropes that they
could not get one way or the other.
The others were not to be seen.
They had wandered in every dir-
ection, and were found during the
day. My nag and many others were
found near Melton ; some went to-
wards Melbourne, some got to Little
River and other places, and a few
were never recovered. Then the dry-
ing and cleaning of clothes, bedding,
and accoutrements were something to
remember. However, we had fine
weather after that, and had a good
time. I think only one man got
hurt ; he was too near a cannon when
it was fired, and the wad caught him
on the face. The day before the
camp broke up, a number of the
B.M. girls rode over, and on the
quiet we rigged up a spare tent,
and got clean straw for them to
sleep on. Their horses were tied
along with the others, and extra
feed was easily got from the Quar-
ter-master (our own Mr. Crook)
and a tip procured bread, meat, and
a bucket of tea from the cooks, and
this was repeated when required.
Sentries were told off to guard their
tent at night. Camp broke up early
next forenoon. The girls were got
away before this. After we had
got well out of sight of the camp we
were dismissed, and soon discovered
the ladies in waiting, and a pleasant
scamper home finished that year’s
camp.
At another time we had a big
Review on the Flemington race-
course. We were halted near the
river, and on the other side several
mines were laid. One of these, just
across from where we were, exploded
prematurely. We saw what we
thought was a dummy blown high
in the air, and shattered to pieces.
But when we got back to town we
heard that it was a man who had
thus been killed. When we went to
these camps it was usual to secrete
away a few blank charges, and when
we reached the top of Anthony’s
cutting, on our road home, a halt
was made, and a few rounds were
fired, just to let the B.M. people
know that we were nearing home.
Snakes were plentiful at one of
the camps, and a 3-feet black one
was killed near our tent. One of
our boys said he would play a hoax
with it, so he tied a string to its
head, and passed it into the tent,
and then waited for someone pass-
ing and then drew the snake with
a wriggling motion into the tent,
and under some straw. The passers
stopped, and called out, “A snake
in your tent !” A voice from inside
called out, “Oh, never mind,- it
won’t do any harm, we’re used to
snakes ! ” This trick was repeated
many times, and one telling the
other, the hoax was discovered, and
his snakeship was hung on a post
for inspection.
The Geelong camp was an enjoy-
able one. It was in the showyard,
and very near the bay, and many
had a dip in the briny. One even-
ing the camp was open for the pub-
lic, and was thronged by people of
both sexes. The bands played, and
a lot of dancing was indulged in.

Some time ago a Bacchus. Marsh
motor cycle party (Messrs. H. I*.
Simon, O. D. Coventry, H. G. Camp-


bell, W. D. Hogan, W. D. Simon,
C. and D. Williams) were on a four
days’ tour in the Western district.
After negotiating the three miles’
interesting stretch of Stony rises,
beyond Colac, we had a
splendid run along the level country
of Pomborneit, and, as we pass a
most pretentious looking factory, we
are surprised and delighted to see
the conspicuous lettering—Bacchus
Marsh Concentrated Milk Factory.
When stationed at Stratford, 1
frequently visited Maffra, and it was
always a caiise of wonderment to
me why the factory there should be
called the Bacchus Marsh Concentra-
ted Milk Factory, or some title to
that effect. When starting this ser-
ies of articles on the history of
Bacchus Marsh I felt that any re-
view of the past would be singu-
larly incomplete if it did not con-
tain an account of the development
of that small beginning at Bacchus
Marsh which has resulted in the
establishment of one of the most
important dairying undertakings in
Australia. The insignificant mus
tard seed has indeed produced a
tree which spreads much foliage.
Mr. W. Grant, of Millbank, is too
modest. His particular doings in
this notable enterprise ought to be
chronicled, but a promise having
been given, must be kept. But I
must state facts. Mr. Grant is the
Chairman of Victorian Directors of
the company, and hence it does not
require the exercise of much intel-
ligence to grasp that a gopd deal of
responsibility rests upon his shoul-
ders in connection with the manage-
ment. Cr. W. H. McFarlane, J.P.,
is another local representative on
the Board.
I interview Mr. Grant, and he
gracefully submits after some re-
luctance, to the inevitable. In those
early days of Bacchus Marsh, when
our old friend Mr. Joseph Lodge
was wheeled about in that impro-
vised perambulator, under the
kindly tutorage of a black gin, and
bullock drays were the motor car
of that day, Mr. Grant had a good
deal of milk, which he used to send
to the cheese factory of Mr. G. G.
Pearce. Mr. Pearce started at the
lower mill, Hopetoun. It was for-
merly the flour mill, of Aitken Bros.
Evidently wheat was, in earlier
times, most extensively grown in
the district, for there were three
mills to meet the requirements of
the farmer —one at Myrniong, Jas.
Young’s, and the Hopetoun flour
mill. I naturally inquire why there
was a slump in the production of
wheat locally. Mr. Grant could only
think that other crops paid better,
and that fields had become dirty,
running into wild oats, not to speak
of risk of rust. Barley supplanted
wheat, and the whole district was
given to production of that cereal.
Aitken & Co., Gough & Go., of Mel-
bourne, were large buyers ; the cart-
ing being to Keilor Road station,
and Mr. Grant has taken loads to
the Werrenheip distillery, carried
on by Dunn & Co.
When Mr. G. G. Pearce came to
Bacchus Marsh, he started a cheese
factory in lower mill. But the In-
flow of milk increasing, he erected
a factory in Waddle street. Some
lofty pines, and two big under-
ground cement tanks, alone mark
the place to-day, where the build-
ing stood. Those pine trees were
planted by Mr. Pearce. He was ac-
customed to get as much as 3,500
gallons per day, the price reaching
at times 6d. per gallon. It was a
flourishing industry, tons and tons
of cheese, being stored. After a
time, Mr. Pearce made up his mind
to close up, and suppliers were left
stranded. The dairy farmer had
counted on the regular taking of his
milk, and there was accordingly no
pig breeding. Mr. Grant, with
others, had a good deal of milk on
hand, and the question was what
to do with it. Inquiries were made.
Mr. D. A. Little had just come to
the town as rabbit inspector. He
informed local producers that he
was quite sure the Pioneer Concen-
trated Milk Factory of Romsey
would establish a branch factory in
Bacchus Marsh if they had encour-
agement. Two representatives of
the Company, Messrs. Beard and
Derrick, came over, bringing with
them a Mr. W. J. Anderson. Mr.
Grant said a meeting was soon
called, for the disposal of milk was
becoming an aggravated problem
It was decided to form a company,
to be called the Bacchus Marsh Con-


centrated Milk Company, which was
to be run in conjunction with the
Pioneer Factory at Romsey. Every-
thing- was arranged. Provisional
directors were appointed, and Mr.
W. J. Anderson elected Secretary,
The first directors were Messrs. T.
Cain, P. O’Hagan, D. Robertson,
Manning and Grant. Mr. O’Hagan
retired, and Mr. W. H. McFarlane
was elected in his place. As time
passed on it was decided that it
would be to the advantage of the
Company if a Melbourne man, ac-
quainted with the business, occu-
pied a' seat on the directorate, and
Mr, Francis Forrest, representative
of Pears’ Soap Co., became a mem-
ber of the Board, and eventually its
chairman. Mr. Manning left, and
sold out all his interest. Mr. J,
Byrne, of Mullaly & Byrne, ship-
ping agents, took his place. Meet-
ings of shareholders were held in
the Mechanics’ Institute, but the
Directors met at the factory. Things
went on in this way for a long
time. The Board now has its meet-
ings at the Company’s offices, Mel-
bourne.
After a couple of meetings had
taken place, it was resolved that the
factory should be run on its own,
altogether independent of Romsey,
Mr. Grant, as one of the pioneers
of the dairying industry in Bacchus
Marsh, was determined that he
would not rest until there was a
proper output for the milk. Others
shared the same determination, and
arrangements were soon made to
erect a building.- Mr. Grant offered
the company the site where Mr.
Little’s residence, “Pentland,” was
afterwards built. But as it did not
give good water supply, or drain-
age, it was deemed unsuitable.
Afterwards a piece of land, in front
of Mr. W, Grant Morton’s shop, was
chosen, but so many difficulties were
found in digging for water in the
gully that this was abandoned, and
the present site, on the bank of the
river, resulted in permanent occu-
pation, as having the most advan-
tages. The original area has been
added to recently by the purchase
of a block from Mr. Grant, to erect
manager's quarters. The plant first
consisted of one pan, vacuum
pump, boiler, and separator. The
staff consisted of Mr, Tenbosh, man-
ager, and three others. Mr. Ten-
bosh having' resigned, Mr. J. Tan-
cock was appointed condenser. He
is still in the employment of the
company, occupying a responsible
position in the Sydney factory. Mr.
Robins succeeded Mr. Tancock, he
afterwards went to Maffra. Mr. E.
Lawrence followed, and he in time
left for Maffra. The next manager
was Mr. Joe Gorrie, again succeeded
in order by Mr. Basil Purbrick and
Mr. A. Shaw. Mr. Basil Purbrick,
brother of Mr. R. Purbrick, General
Manager of the Company,' is in
charge of the Pomborneit factory.
The Bacchus Marsh factory started
under splendid circumstances, giving
a good price for milk, '4d. to 7d., ac-
cording to season. The factory had
its own peculiar history, to relate,
which would not serve any good
purpose, but in the main there was
progress. The Company began to
look afield. There was £1 great de-
mand for milk. Maffra somehow
was recognised by the Company to
be a desirable place in which to
operate. Mr. Grant had met Mr.
Foster, of Boisdale —40 tenant farms,
with brick residences, and in some
instances silos, form the flat of
Boisdale, which is the possession of
Mr. Foster, not omitting the town-
ship, with its cheese factory, and
fine hall, in which is a piano, cost-
ing over 100 guineas, the gift of
Mr. Foster. Boisdale is just a few
miles from Maffra. At this par-
ticular time Mr. Stephen Staughton
was taking a great interest in the
factory. __
But allow me, to go back over
some of the ground covered.
The factory at Bacchus Marsh was
originally established for the pur-
pose of manufacturing Concentrated
Milk, which was sent down to Mel-
bourne and distributed in bulk to
householders. This has grown to
such a size that the Company has
now some 40 of these carts distri-
buting this product daily in the city
of Melbourne and suburbs. The de-
mand for this product spread, and
the Company then started to pack
it in herihetically sealed tins, and
supplied it to the Shipping Com-
panies, until to-day every passenger
steamer trading to Australia uses


this milk for its passengers, and
most of the ocean • liners carry it
abroad for shipment, and use it in
their other ships, whicn do no.t trade
in Australian waters.
With the discovery of gold in
large quantities in West Australia,
a further stimulus was given to this
trade, and the Company shipped the
milk in the earliest days to W.A.,
and up to the goldfields, where it
was a great boon to the miners and
others there, and it speedily obtained
a large turn-over, which it holds to
this day, in spite of the subsequent
advent of other forms of preserved
milk.
The development of the trade, as
I have already pointed out, required
increased manufacturing facilities,
and to this end a number of the
shareholders floated another Com-
pany, and built a factory at Maffra,
which was worked in conjunction
with the factory at Bacchus Marsh,
and a little later these two Company
ies, for the purpose of convenience,
wore amalgamated, and the business
carried on entirely by the Bacchus
Marsh Concentrated Milk Company
Ltd. The Company at this time was
suffering from some severe compe-
tition with the Jersey Milk Co., in
N.S.W., with two factories there —
one at Bomaderry, and one at Cool-
angatta—and after protracted negot-
iations, the two Companies were
amalgamated, by the absorption of
the Jersey Milk Co. by the Bacchus
Marsh Co. '1902) who, further,
opened an office in Sydney, and con-
ducted the business in both States,
closing down and dismantling the
factory at Coolangatta, and removing
the plant to the Bomaderry factory,
which was enlarged for the purpose.
The operations under this amalga-
mation, however, were* not carried
on profitably, and early in 1907 a
complete change in the personnel
of the Directors took place Mr.
Alec. Hay being appointed Chair-
man, the other Directors being
Messrs. Wm. Grant, A. M. Foster,
and W. H. McFarlane. They ap-
pointed Mr. Regiald Purbrick gen-
eral manager, and from then on the
Company steadily progressed, and
soon converted its losses into pro-
fits. .
Shortly after this re-organisation,
the Company acquired the factory
and business of the N.S.W. Concen-
trated Milk Co., who were compet-
ing with them in the shipping-trade,
and acquired their factory at Bel-
ford, on the Hunter River. In the
meantime, the Company entered into
trade in Condensed Milk, similar to
the well-known Swiss product, and
after the usual experimental losses
they produced this article satisfac-
torily, and to-day have the largest
trade of any Australian Company,
selling not only in Australia, but ex-
porting to Africa, the East, and
elsewhere.
They 'also undertook the manu-
facture of unsweetened condensed
milk for the British Navy, which,
from a small beginning, ran into
large figures, and upon the estab-
lishment of the Australian Navy the
Company not only secured the con-
tracts for the supply of'this article
to the Australian Navy, but con-
tinues to supply the British Navy
for their foreign stations in China
and Africa, and in New Zealand.
In 1909, the Company acquired
the distributing business in Mel-
bourne of Chas. Dunn & Co., and
shortly after the Factory
at Bacchus Marsh, owned by Mr.
Several years later the Lowood
Milk Condensing Co., in Queens-
land, which met with misfortunes,
was in .the market, and this also was
acquired by the Bacchus Marsh Co.,
who enlarged it, and opening their
own offices ih ’ Brisbane, are now
both manufacturing and distributing
in that centre.
. The factory at Belford having
proved too small for requirements,
a very large and up-to-date factory
was erected oh a neighbouring site,
which is now working in full swing.
The expansion of the. Company’s
trade required further manufactur-
ing facilities, and to this end a
modern was erected at Pom-
borneit, in the’ Western District of
Victoria, and subsequently, haying
acquired certain dried milk patents,
the manufacture of dried milk and
infants’ food was undertaken there,
which is now carried on to a very
large extent, the Company’s latest
product being an infants’ food, mar-
keted under the name of Lactogen,
which is fresh cows’ milk, modified


in its composition to approximate as
closely as possible that of human
milk, both in nutrition and digesti-
bility, and which, by competent
medical authorities, is considered to
he the best infants’ food in the
world.
The Company has very large and
complete canister works, both in
Melbourne and Sydney, at which it
makes all its own tins by the most
modern machinery, in the most econ-
omical way, for the supply to its
factories in the respective States.
From the small beginnings the
Company has now a paid up capital
of just under £200,000, and an idea
of its operations can be guaged from
its wages sheet alone, which amounts
in the busy season to over £7 50
weekly.
Its importations of tinplate alone,
for the making into canisters into
which the milk is filled, run into
many thousands of pounds per an-
num.
In last season's spring flush the
Company was treating one hundred
tons of milk a day—more milk than
is treated by any other concern in
Australia. *
In 1912, the Company found its
premises in Melbourne were too
small to carry on their business,
and they purchased the property
situated in Little Collins street,
which is now the Company’s Head
Office, and recently acquired the
land adjoining it, on which they
have erected temporary buildings,
and on which they contemplate, in
the near future, erecting a large es-
tablishment, at the cost of some
£20,000.
Mention has been made of the
Hay family—large landed proprie-
tors in New South Wales. The
family have gone extensively into
the breeding of dairy cattle, and
established dairies, largely adopting
a Closer Settlement policy in con-
nection with their property for that
purpose.
I have finished the restrospect, and
verily has example been given of
an industry commencing under hum-
ble circumstances, in a small pro-
vincial town, and extending its
borders over a wide area.
Memoirs Of Light Horsemen.
“I, Viscount Canterbury, Baron
Bottesford, of Bottcsford, in the
County of Leicester, in the peerage
of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, by these pre-
sents, do appoint you, Thomas Geo.
Pearce, Captain and Officer Com-
manding of the Bacchus Marsh
Troop of Light Horse. You are
therefore carefully and diligently to
discharge the duty of Captain by
exercising and well disciplining
both the infantry officers and soldiers
in the said corps,” so on and so on.
So reads the commission of Mr. T.
G. Pearce, and I was deeply inter-
ested as Mr. Pearce elaborates the
history of the corps, and relates all
the thrilling experiences of tented
field and sham battle.
Notes also come from Hon. John
Bowser, M.L.A., son of Sergeant-
Major Bowser, who, in the days of
the local military, was the beau
ideal of an officer. Mr. Pearce is
enthusiastic over the Sergeant-
Major, and is good enough to supply,
at request, an appreciation in the
shape of a character sketch.
I proceed to give tl.e history of
the unit of defence that existed for
so many years in the Marsh, duly
acknowledging the valuable data
supplied by the ex-Captain, and the
equally valuable notes forwarded by
the Hon. J. Bowser. When the 40th
Regiment was withdrawn from Mel-
bourne, there was a feeling of inse-
curity in the colony, and the Govern-
ment decided to form Volunteer
Regiments of Horse and Foot.
Colonel Pitt, an army veterkn, who
had seen much service in India, was
commissioned to form the Regiment
of Victoria Volunteer Light Horse.
Amongst the Drill Instructors ap-
pointed by Col. Pitt was Sergeant-
Major Bowser, who had done much
instructional work in India. I notice
the other day that in the appoint-
ment of Drill Instructors for the
military there was a large number
of Sergeant-Majors imported from
India.
Sergeant-Major Bowser had seen
much service—took part in thirteen
battles and engagements, was three
times wounded in action, twice sev-
erely, and was and continued the


recipient of an Imperial pension.
He came up to Bacchus Marsh in
1860, and formed a troop there,
with contingents at Peiltland Hills
and Melton. Evidence will be sup-
plied with what success raw mater-
ial was transformed into absolute
military precision. Drill took place
at fixed intervals.
The first encampment was held at
Werribee, in April, 1861. Instruc-
tor Bowser also formed and drilled
for some years the Geelong, Balla-
rat, and Kyneton troops. The en-
campment of April, 1861, at Wer-
ribee, is described in the files of
the “Argus” of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and
sth April—-“At mid-day the first gun
was fired. We took our position on
Mr. Chirnside’s look-out platform.
Prom thence the approach of the
cavalry regiments was first noticed,
and when the cavalry rode into line
few such military bodies could have
presented a much finer appearance.
This was especially noticeable in
the Bacchus Marsh Rifles, with their
red Garribaldi shirts, and shiny
Huzzar cloaks, they looked espec-
ially picturesque.” A later account
—“The Garribaldi jackets and Hus-
sar coat and cap of the Bacchus
Marsh men were the observed of all
observers.” I ask Mr. Pearce, as
Mr. Bowser is not present, who sug-
gested the novel dress. He could
not recollect. Possibly some old in-
habitant may know. The “Argus”
report reads on : —“By the way, I
cannot omit to chronicle the splen-
did style in which these same Gar-
ribaldians rode into camp, halted and
dismounted at the word. Everyone
who saw them praised them highly.
I saw also that their horses were
cared for in true soldierly fashion.
The superiority ol their discipline
was manifest throughout the
manoeuvres.” Mr. Pearce has a
couple of photos, of the troop, which,
duly framed, occupy a conspicuous
place on the walls of his dining
room. The appearance is that of a
body of men spic and span and under
strict military discipline. Quarter-
master J. E. Crook gets well before
the camera, Captain Pearce is rather
retiring, and with a beard, repre-
sented as black as the ace of spades;
and there is Lieut. Mahoney, on
“Old Werribee.”
Sergeant-Major Bowser lived on
the farm afterwards purchased by
Mr. Simon, and, showing the spirit
of the members of the B.M. troop,
they'came one day with horses and
ploughs, sowed and harrowed the
field near the present suspension
bridge in one day. A merry party
they made at dinner in the little
cottage. After the honors of the
first encampment they presented
their Instructor with a gold chain,
and a purse of sovereigns, the purse
of netted silk, in red, white and
blue, made by Mrs. McLean, the
wife of the Captain. Both watch
and purse are in possession of the
family, A little personal note—The
Hon. J. Bowser writes that his
mother, who is 82, is still hale and
busied with her home duties and
church work, at Sandringham.
The powder magazine of the troop
was the old log lockup, near the
Manor House, the door of which re-
mains to this day. The Manor
House with its fine garden, was the
best appointed residence in the
Marsh. The lock-up was built of
gum-tree logs, mortised at the ends.
The boys of school No. 2 8 soon got
on to the track of powder, each
charge made up in flannel bags.
Many a big dry stump on the school
grounds went soaring and twisting
into the air in the dinner hour when
the master was away. A tunnel was
made beneath the stump, and the
bags of big grained powder stamped
well in, and connected with fuse got
from Mr. Woods’ store. lam sorry
the Hon. J. Bowser has not drawn
on his memory for more of these
reminiscences.
Mr. Pearce gets into the history
of the troops. The 40th Regiment
having been recalled, home, the Col-
ony—for Colony it was then, not
State—was defenceless, and some-
thing had to be done in the way of
affording protection against a pos-
sible enemy. There was, accord-
ingly, the inception of the volun-
teer movement: a wave of excite-
ment seemed to pass over the whole
land, and no locality caught the en-
thusiasm in a more pronounced way
than Bacchus Marsh. The move-
ment was initiated particularly by
Mr. Mordant McLean. He was one
of the McLean ■ family who were


among the earliest settlers of the
Marsh. The McLean's lived where
the Convent is now situated. Mr.
Mordant McLean was most enthus-
iastic over the establishment of the
troop, and became the first Captain.
The Government was duly commun-
icated with, and an old Indian offi-
cer residing in Melbourne, to wit,
Sergeant-Major Bowser, was immed-
iately sent up to “lick into shape”
the said particularly raw material.
The troop was sworn in by batches
in the old Mechanics’ Institute.
There has been some confusion, Mr.
Pearce states, in the description of
uniform. In reality, there were
three stages. The original was the
red Garribaldi, dark blue Hussar
jacket, with red facings, generally
worn thrown over the shoulder, but
always available as a jacket when
required. Dark blue pants, with red
stripes, glaced leather below knee,
strapped to Wellington boots, red
blanket (an emergency cloak) neatly
rolled up and strapped on the saddle.
Later on the uniform was changed
to a dark blue tunic and busby,
with red plume, and dark blue rid-
ing pants, all trimmed with white
braid. The officer’s dress was a
finer cloth, of same color, heavily
braided with silver lace, a costly
but very handsome uniform. The
volunteers found each his own horse,
saddle and bridle, and saddle cloth
of dark blue, with Prince of Wales’
feathers in the corners. The Ser-
geant-Major was inexorably punctil-
ious thal his directions should be
carried out, and to this day Mr.
Pearce unconsciously adopts the
same method in folding up his
photographic gear as was taught the
troop in the strapping up of the red
blanket. Mr. Pearce produces a
relic in the shape of a piece of the
emergency cloak, which he has
pleasure in preserving to this day.
A sword was worn, but no firearms,
presumably because headquarters
had some change of accoutrement in
view, which afterwards did take
effect as the > mounted troop blos-
somed into the Prince of Wales’
Victoria Light Horse. Mr. Pearce
stated that as yet there was not that
military unification as obtained
afterwards. Each troop was in a
sense a law unto itself, It was in a
sense independent. It had its own
Drill Instructor ; its own uniform ;
and it could not be denied that such
had its advantage in the inciting of
a spirit of emulation. One unit
competed with another. Bacchus
Marsh evidently was' determined to
get the blue ribbon, and it succeeded
mainly that it did possess such a
competent wholesouled Instructor as
Sergeant-Major Bowser. A full dress
parade was held on the open ground,
facing the school, at 1 p.m. every
Saturday. A monthly drill compul-
sory ; at this 3 0 had to be present,
to render it effective, otherwise the
annual “effective” allowance money
could not be claimed.
After the formation or the Prince
of Wales’ Victoria Light Horse, it
was decided, by authority, to have
a battery in connection with the
regiment,, each troop to have a nine-
pounder. The regiment was com-
manded by Major Cobb Anderson,
of Castlemaine, and it consisted of
Melbourne, Geelong, Kyneton,
Ballarat, Castlemaine, Bacchus
Marsh, and Sandhurst detachments.
One of the consequences of the new
movements was that when troops
were mobilised the officers were al-
lotted duties in accordance with their
seniority. Mr. Pearce remarked that
when the local troop went to camp
he might be put in charge of an-
other body, and not come in con-
tact with his own during the whole
Review. The troop itself might bd
divided, and attached to other corps,
but throughout the whole of its ex-
istence the Bacchus Marsh section
maintained to the full the high pres-
tige which it had gained at the
Werribee encampment. The addi-
tion of the Howitzer made the drill
more interesting, and enlarged the
scope. Artillery drill was added to
ordinary cavalry drill, and when
away at encampment or review the
good horsemanship of gun drivers,
and the high discipline of gun de-
tachment, always won for the troop
the distinction of having most ardu-
ous duties assigned to them, and
never once did they fail in execut-
ing same. Mr. Pearce gets quite en-
thusiastic as he fights the battle
over again. He recites stirring in-
cidents at the Sunbury campaign.
The gun had to be taken down a.pro-


cipitous descent, and then across a
pontoon bridge, thrown by engineers
over Jackson’s Creek, and over a field
laid with mines. The driving of the
gunmen down the incline was some-
thing to be remembered, especially
when other guns failed. Mr. Pearce
tells of an incident at the Fleming-
ton review. The troop saw a mine ex-
plode, and the body of a man thrown
up into the air. The whole troop
laughed at the spectacle, as they
took it to be a dummy, but a mine
having prematurely exploded, the
result was the loss of a life. The
father of the Bence’s was an ex-
pert horseman : it still runs in the
blood. He usually rode the leading
horse. Mr. Pearce relates an amus-
ing story. It was after the review at
Memington, as the troops were re-
turning to the city. Crowds thronged
tne streets, and the guns were going
along at a pace. Kyneton was jeal-
ous of the pre-eminence of Bacchus
Marsh, and one of their drivers, to
show his dexterity, stood up on his
saddle and waved his whip triumph-
antly at Bacchus Marsh. But Bac-
cuus Marsh was not to be outdone,
even though it was infraction of
regulations, for Driver Bence, too
stood up on his saddle, and waved
his whip towards Kyneton, just as
triumphantly. The acrobatic per-
formance was observed by Captain
Pearce, but, like Nelson of old, he
put the telescope to his blind eye,
and Driver Bence was not put into
irons. Mr. Pearce has to stop in
his narrating, as he says it would
take the “Express’’ weeks and
weeks to publish the many incidents.
But I am particularly amused at
what he recounted took place after a
rifle practice. I should state that
rifle practice took place under
Ryan’s hill, now part of Broadlands.
The percentage of good shots would
compare most favorably with that of
any other troop. Mr. Willie Mar-
shall was a splendid shot, and also
Mr. James Young, bootmaker. The
Lancaster riflle was used, and long
and short Enfield ; no breech-loaders
in earlier stages ; later newer pat-
terns. Now for the incident. Mr.
O’Hara, Roman Catholic schoolmas-
ter, was in the habit of visiting the
butts, and on one occasion bet that
uo one could hit his belltopper at a
distance of 200 yards, a shilling a
shot. A good many entered —but
missed. It came to Mr. Pearce’s
turn, and he was the last. Mr.
O’Hara had unwisely, instead of just
placing his belltopper on top of the
post, rammed the hat right down on
it. Mr. Pearce tired, struck the
post, and a big splinter tore the bell-
topper so that it was almost unrecog-
nisable. Needless to state, great
mirth prevailed.
Mr. Pearce remembers with ap-
preciation the courtesy which an
Officer in those days was always ac-
corded at headquarters. In addition
to Col. Pitt, there were Col. Ander-
son and Col. Ross, responsible offi-
cers, but there was a Captain Stubbs
who was generosity itself, in his
dealings with the Officers who
sought information.
The 'list of Officers was as follows:
Captain Molesworth G-reene, Capt.
Brown (of Labilliere’s station), Capt.
Mordant McLean, Capt. John Sisson
Cooper (Clerk of Courts, and later
Police Magistrate of Gippsland),
Capt. Pearce, Capt. George Grant,
Lieutenants Shaftesbury Cooper, W.
H. McParlane, C. Mahoney, Staff-
Sergeant Porysth, Quarter-master J.
E. Crook, and Dr. Rae, Surgeon.
In addition to these we must not
forget the Trumpeter—Peter Rob-
ertson. Robertson was a man of
many parts—cordial manufacturer,
our first local photographer ( before
the advent of dry plates), Presby-
terian precentor and wielder of the
tuning fork (no organ in Presby-
terian Churches in those days, but
a grand choir for all that) and the
best singer and reciter of Scotitsh
humorous songs and pieces ever
heard —quite as good, or better, than
the subsequent Kennedy.
A Mr. Wm. Grant, the original
owner of the Hopetoun property and
mill, was an enthusiastic member of
the first Mounted Rifle Troop. He
composed a ballad of 2 0 verses, or
more, on “The First Werribee En-
campment.’’ The opening stanzas
ran something like this ;
‘Twas in the year of ’6l,
On April’s early day,
The B.M. Mounted Rifle Troop
To the Werribee went its way.
John Bowser was our Sergeant’s
name —


A soldier without flaw.
“Attend to your drill, and learn
with a will.
And I’ll make you a slashing
corps.”
And so on. This ballad became a
great favorite at Troop concerts, and
always brought the house down.
John Tyson, blacksmith, of Myrn-
iong, was Farrier to the Troop, and
a most useful member of the force.
Mrs. Jones, of the Border Inn,
had till recently a large engraving
of the Review at the first Werribee
encampment, showing the march
past of the Mounted Rifles, with the
B.M. Troop well depicted. Unfor-
tunately, she disposed of it to Mr.
Chirnside, but if that gentleman
would allow it to be photographed,
a copy should certainly find a place
in our Shire Hall.
I append, as a conclusion, the
appreciation of Serg-Major Bowser
by Mr. Pearce, already referred to.
SERGEANT-MAJOR BOWSER.
First Drill Instructor to Bacchus
Marsh Troop of Mounted Rifles.
AN APPRECIATION, by Thos.
G. PEARCE :
The year 186 0 will ever be mem-
orable in the annals of Victoria, for
during its currency two notable
events took place. The first being
the withdrawal of the British 4 oth
Regiment from our shores; and the
second, the inauguration of a Vol-
unteer System of local defence. A
wave of patriotism flooded the Col-
ony. The call to defend hearths and
homes met with a hearty response,
and in addition to the ordinary In-
fantry Regiments, and batteries of
Artillery, in many provincial centres
Troops of Mounted Riflemen were
formed. Of course such a whirl of
excitement quickly made itself evi-
dent in Bacchus Marsh, and the pro-
posal to create a District Mounted
Rifle Corps was received with ac-
clamation. Representatives of every
grade of Society land magnates,
magistrates, municipal officers, the
yeomanry of the country side, doc-
tors, schoolmasters, tradesmen and
artizans, alike flocked to the Stand-
ard, and the tide of enthusiasm rose
high and still higher, till at last the
number of intending members was
very little short of 100. Taking ‘the
current when it served,’ the Defence
Department promptly made avail-
able for Bacchus Marsh the full time
service of a competent Instructor.
I can well remember the eagerness
with which the advent of Sergeant-
Major Bowser was anticipated ; the
rigidness of the scrutiny to which
he was subjected when he first made
his appearance ; and the contrast
on the early parades, between
the calm, soldierly officer, and the
mass of excited, struggling horses
and untrained recruits, mixed up
again and again in apparently in-
extricable confusion. Through the
long years, of over half a century,
the scene comes back to me as
vividly as though it were but yes-
terday, and once again I hear the
clear distinct word of explanation,
or command; and anon, after some
breathless burst of attempted ma-
noeuvre, when both men and horses
were fairly winded, the welcome per-
mission of the Sergeant-Major, de-
livered in his cheeriest tones, “Make
much of your horses,” this direc-
tion being followed by the sound
of continuous patting on the necks
of our steeds.
Instructor Bowser was the perfect
model of a trained and disciplined
officer —a man of splendid physique,
in the prime of life, with a face
bronzed by the Indian sun; and
lined, even in those early days, with
the marks of many a strenuous cam-
paign; a capable organizer, tactful,
courteous, yet firm; the possessor
of a magnificent voice; and withal,
perfectly faultless in regard to neat-
ness and thoroughness of equipment,
he thaught as much by example as
by precept. The very fact that a
Trooper had to come into juxtaposi-
tion with the Sergeant-Major, made
it impossible for him to turn out
with a horse badly groomed, or ac-
coutrements unburnished or dirty.
In such conditions slovenliness be-
came a shame.
In addition to the weekly parades,
classes for sword exercise were form-
ed, the Mechanics’ Hall, in Young
street, being the drill room. Basket
hilted canes were also furnished,
with which the Troopers had many
a merry hout, the after effects, as


they left the hall, reminding them of
their schooldays, when they had had
a few words with the master. A
rifle range was also established,
under Ryan’s hill, and a course of
musketry instruction entered on,
which proved of lasting benefit to all
concerned. Many excellent shots
were discovered, and till compara-
tively recent years, the late Mr. Wm.
Marshall kept up the old Troop’s re-
putation by good shooting at Wil-
liamstown. But all these varied en-
gagements did not satisfy our In-
structor’s craving for hard work, so
an early morning Riding School was
started. This became very popular,
an attendance of 15 or more being
secured. The horses took a remark-
able interest in the exercises, and
became quite proficient, obeying
words of command as readily as the
men.
Such capable tuition could not
fail to produce marked results. Six
months after his duties as Instruc-
tor commenced, Sergeant-Major
Bowser had the pleasure of seeing
the aforesaid heterogeneous mass
of recruits transformed into a smart
troop, which, at the Werribee En-
campment of April, 1861, arrested
the attention of the general public,
won the unsolicited encomiums of
the metropolitan Press, and took up
a premier position in regard to the
other Troops —a standing never after-
wards forfeited.
Respecting our Instructor’s kind-
ness and consideration for the
younger members of the Troop, no
words of praise could be too warm.
In common with others similarly
situated I, an immature youth of 17,
was taken thoroughly in hand,
taught, and encouraged, and made to
feel that the young members were
the special objects of his patient
care and interest.
Years after, when the Corps of
Mounted Rifles, remodelled, was
transformed into a Troop of the
Prince of Wales’ Victorian Volun-
teer Light Horse, at a time when
false Departmental economy had
abolished the position of Drill In-
structor, Sergeant-Major Bowser
(who still resided in the district)
loyally retained his membership in
the local Troop. At this time the
'Writer, who in the interim bad risen
from the ranks to the honoraJble
position of Captain Commanding,
was placed in the anomalous posi-
tion of having to drill the officer to
whom he was indebted for every
atom of military knowledge he pos-
sessed. It was truly a “Reductio ad
absurdum,” but so considerate and
gentlemanly was our former Instruc-
tor, that any feeling of embarrass-
ment on my part' was quickly dis-
pelled, and his kindly advice and as-
sistance were ever at my service.
Old Bacchus Marsh is rapidly
passing away. The Boys of the
Old Brigade, who can now respond
to the Roll call, are few and far be-
tween. A new generation has enter-
ed upon its inheritance, and present
day youth knows little of the stirring
events of the early sixties. It is
surely fitting that some acknowledg-
ment should be made of the services
rendered by a loyal soldier of the
Queen, at a critical time in Colonial
history, and it is to this end, and
likewise as a token of personal gra-
titude and lasting esteem, that these
lines have been penned.
Early Memories Of Mr. Hodgson.
Our old friend, Mr. Henry Hodg-
son, now residing in Wynnum South,
Queensland, is particularly interest-
ed in the chronicling of early history
of Bacchus Marsh, and during the
week I received a lengthy epistle.
He goes back to “somewhere about
the year 1853.” Mr. Hodgson’s
memory is really remarkable, and
I have to thank him for forwarding
such excellent material and without
any soliciting or interviewing. The
fecundity of historical data in con-
nection with the community is ex-
ceptional, and I am very much en-
couraged in drawing the veil aside
from the past to hear the numerous
expressions of appreciation on every
side. Probably the end is in view,
but possibly some of the older gen-
eration may have yet knowledge of
local events that transpired in
“those good old days,” which should
not go into oblivion. Mr. Hodgson
thinks they should not, and though
he is living at such a great dis-
tance his heart is still in “dear old
Bacchus Marsh,” and he forwards
some very graphic descriptions. Mr.
Hodgson tells of an “amateur


theatre” in the earlier times of Bac-
chus Marsh. Some of those comed-
ians (if they have not passed from
the scene of action) are to-day
sober-sided grey-headed veterans.
One can scarcely believe that one
of our now respected dignified citi-
zens (for so I have been informed)
was in his youthful career a suc-
cessful “Bones” in a local Minstrel
Troupe, and used to bring down the
house with his “corner jokes”; and
just picture Cf. W. H. McFarlane
allotted the responsible position of
doorkeeper of the “Penny Readings,”
scooping in the pennies.
Surely Mr. Hodgson is not the
only one who is able to contribute
interesting reminiscences. I trust
that those Who can supply will do
so. However, this note will be of
advantage in the reproduction of
the earlier life of the community.
I propose to let Mr. Hodgson now
tell his story :—“Just a few more
reminiscences of dear old B.M.
Aitken & Clark (don’t know any-
thing about where they came from)
bought the Manor House and a lot
of the flat land on tbe east of the
river, where Miller’s homestead
stands. The district Cotlrt of Petty
Sessions was held in the house, and
presided over by Messrs. Griffiths,
Babiliere, and perhaps Greene and
others. There was a substantial
lock-up, built of logs, with a small
brick room where the Constable
stayed when he had a prisoner.
Some years later the property was
divided and sold. Mr. J. E. Crook
bought the house and land bounded
by the Main road on the South, by
Young street on the North, and
Crook street on the East. A Mr.
M'Naraar'a got a portion of land be-
tween Miller’s and the “butt’s” hill.
Previous to that, he lived on the
Parwan Creek. He bought an al-
ready framed Tasmanian house, and
I put it up on the newly acquired
farm. The shingles for the roof
were 15 inches long. I had to steep
them a day before nailing them on.
There was no soft wood about the
house, except the sashes. Some time
after this Mr. M'Namara met his
death near Rockbank, while riding
home after seeing visitors on their
way to town. Then that farm came
into the possession of Mr. Jeremiah
Ryan, father and grandfather of
our present resident doctors. Later,
Mr. J. Ryan lived in the Manor-
house, and others have tenanted it
since. A worthy descendant of the
Crook family now occupies this fine-
old landmark, where he was born.
I go back to the time when Mr. J.
E. Crook lived in the Manor-house.
He had a tutor for the boys named
Scott. A part of the present State
School was in existence, and known
as the Common school. Well, the
teacher (a Mr. Wilson) with Scott
and several young folk, started an
amateur theatre. As no boards were
available to make the stage, the
doors were torn off their , hinges and
placed on the backs of the forms.
Then a rehearsal was commenced.
A lady amateur took tlxe boards.
She weighed 14-stone, and treading
on one of the panels of a door she
partially disappeared, that is, as far
as her stoutness would allow her to
go ! Scott rushed to her assistance,
and he followed suit by going through
another panel, for he was a pretty
heavy young fellow, too. These
doors and other school furniture had
to be taken to the carpenter for re-
pairs before use., Scott was lay
reader for the Anglican Church, as
well as tutor. He finished his career
by robbing the bank, and was after-
wards known as “Captain Moon-
light.” The full account of his ad-
ventures has appeared. I must give
a flood incident. When the river
overflowed, and filled all the depres-
sions between the Main road and
river, communication with Madding-
lay was entirely cut off. There was
a hut on the bank of the river, oc-
cupied by a blacksmith who worked
for Vere Quail. The smithy stood
where Cosgrove’s fruit shop is now.
An extra big flood came down and
surrounded the hut. The man with
his wife and little girl, got through
as far as the big gully near Mr. C.
Dickie’s residence. A number of
Marsh people brought ropes, which
they threw across the gully. The
man tried to get his wife pulled over
first, but she would not go, so he
had the rope tied to himself, and
was pulled safely over. Then the
rope was thrown for the wife and
child, but the mother said she would
return to the hut, and take her


chance. She stayed in it till the
water rose above the table, on which
she sat. There was a very big red
gum tree standing right in the
centre of what is now Grant street.
Fortunately for the woman there was
a ladder at hand, so she with the
child climbed up the tree and sat
in a big fork all night, and the flood
went down during the next day.
The hut was nearly washed away.
That big tree was taken down some
years after, when the road was
opened. A batch of the unemployed
were sent to do the work, and it
cost the Government over £3O, and
then the big butt laid in the road
for years, being finally burst up with
powder for firewood. Mr. James
Watt, of the Border Inn, tried to
put a bridge over the Werribee. He
got a lot of the principals set up in
the form of a house-roof. The traffic
was to go over at the collar ties, but
the whole affair collapsed before it
was completed. The river could be
forded at a great many places be-
tween the numerous waterholes,
which have totally disappeared.
Blackfish and platypus were plenti-
ful in these beautiful holes. Harry
Hider, a splitter, lived west of the
factory. Thus the name of “Harry’s
Hole’’ arose. Alex Murdoch, a then
well-known resident, was nearly
drowned in this hole while bathing.
Mrs. Tilley, of Coimadai, is the only
one living of the Hider family, Mr.
Win. Anderson had that piece of
land now occupied by Dairy Inspec-
tor Morris. Fie had bricks made on
the north side of the allotment, and
built his house at the north-west
corner. The remains of the brick-
hcle exist to this day. A five-year-
old brother of mine was drowned in
it. Anderson had a bullock team,
and carted timber for himself and
others from Mt. Blackwood, where it
was cut by hand. It was this team
that was almost drowned while cross-
•ng the Lerderderg with lime (this
Was previously mentioned). After
the gold digging rush, Anderson dis-
posed of his business to Robt. Ait-
kin; the workshop was on the same
allotment. I was there apprenticed
to carpentering. Aitkin removed to
North Melbourne soon after, and 1
Went there with him, and stayed five
years. ' I assisted in building one of
the first houses, counting from the
Stork hotel in Elizabeth street.
Afterwards Aitken Bros, had the
Hopetoun flour mill, at bottom end
of the Marsh, and established Ait-
ken’s mill in Elizabeth street, which
is now a furniture factory. Win.
Grant (not Millbank) used Hopetoun
mill for cheese making, and kept
the cows on the flats east of the
mill. It was not a success, owing to
the Quality of the grass. The cheese
was too rich in fat, and would not
keep. The Miller’s bought that and
a good deal more property about
this time, and later added the Wool-
pack and land right up to Mr. Con.
Mahoney’s property. Before this
time quite a small township started
near the Willows, on the main road.
There was a shoemaker, and Clifford
the tailor. The wife of Tom Breen,
the Constable, kept a tiny store.
After a time she had the shop on
main road, afterwards known as
Hollis’ bakery. I don’t know if they
built it, Mrs. Breen was a splendid
woman, and before marriage was
housekeeper to the Dean or Bishop
of Melbourne. After the death of
Mrs. Breen, Mr. Breen lived in a
small hut situated about where Mr.
Caspar’s stable now is, near the
saleyards. It was completely hid in
the scrub, which covered all that
hill. That part and Grant’s hill
were the favourite camping grounds
for the blacks. When one part got
too dirty they moved to the other,
and had a Corroboree as their house
warming. They obtained water for
making tea from the swamp, which
is now Gell street. The Macedon
tribe came on a visit, and had a
big Corroboree, which ended in a
boomerang and spear fight, with
plenty of lubra and dog howling.
Several were lamed ; only two were
killed. They were buried near the
Convent, in an upright position, the
head being only just below the sur-
face. The skulls were removed, and
taken to Melbourne some time after.
The Werribee tribe was a very large
one, previous to the advent of the
white man. Mr. Crisp gave me the
name of Rambler when I used to
drive him to the out-of-the-way
places which abound at 8.M., espec-
ially up the ranges by the Blue
Gum flat and Nuggety Gully, where


I discovered the only easy, spur in
all that range, from J. Kerr’s and
northwards to Trenthani.”
Before leaving for Queensland,
Mr. Hodgson handed me some three
or four copies of the “Express” of
1905, of different dates, in which is
given in Mr. Crisp’s best style an
account of the said peregrinations
through the rough country. If the
history of Bacchus Marsh should
ever be collected into book form (as
has been suggested in numerous
quarters) the articles referred to
should be incorporated.
Mrs. C. Mahoney Interviewed
Mr. Hodgson took us back to
the fifties. I am fortunate that I
am carried back to the forties. I
visit Mr. Con. Mahoney, J.P., 9 4
years of age, but I regret that his
state of health is such that it will
not permit any lengthened inter-
view. Mrs. Mahoney, though 8 4,
has very keen memory of what tran-
spired in the early days. As a little
girl she arrived, in Melbourne, 3rd
Oct., 1841, leaving the ship Agricola
at Willamstown, but no “Williams-
town” then, only a depot for people
not fit to be landed at the beach now
called Port Melbourne. Mrs. Ma-
honey gives the same description of
early Melbourne as Mr. Hodgson,
who saw it later. No footpaths, no
formed roads, a good many shops,
but township only covered from
Swanston street to Queen street,
from Yarra to Latrobe street ; all
around was wild country. Where
Melbourne gaol is now located was
all bush. Emigrants were accom-
modated with tents on the other side
of the Yarra until they secured
better quarters. Down Elizabeth
street, after I’ain, a course of water
ran that nobody could cross on ac-
count of the numerous channels.
Mrs. Mahoney as a girl remembers
a gentleman very kindly offering to
carry her across Elizabeth street.
Her parents settled on Solomon’s
Ford, on the Saltwater river, eight
miles from Melbourne, where they
had a pastoral property. There was
only another family resident in the
district. The Solomon’s were on the
other side of the river. Where Es-
sendon now stands was only bush,
and civilsation at North Melbourne
was represented by an isolated
Pound. Mrs. Mahoney shows me a
print of Swanston street in 18 37,
She described the deserted appear-
ance of Melbourne when the gold
diggings broke out; the rush of men
to find the precious ore. Some had
wheelbarrows to carry their belong-
ings, others had handcarts —one man
in the shafts, and one or two push-
ing behind ; all going up to the gold
fields. I ask Mrs. Mahoney a deli-
cate question. How did the young,
lady. Mips Hogan, of Solomon’s Ford,
come in contact with that vigorous
young gentleman, Mr. Con. Mahoney,
of the Marsh, for the record which 1
find of our old friend proves that he
had superabundance of vitality ? I
get a frank answer. The mode of
transit in those days was by bullocks,
and Mr. Con. Mahoney, travelling
to and from Melbourne, was accus-
tomed to call at the home, at Solo-
mon’s Ford. No further account of
the result of those visits was given
save that the young lady comes to
reside in the Marsh as a bride, and
lives with her father-in-law and
mother-in-law in a slab hut, situ-
ated in that spot now occupied by
the residence of Mr. George Ramsey,
The slab hut was considered rather
pretentious architecture in those
days, and it had another excellence
that -the slabs had all been hewn
by) the family. Please remember
those good old pioneers were not
living in the twentieth century.
There were very few families on the
Marsh when Mrs. Mahoney arrived,
but 1849 to 1914 is a fairly long
spell, and that has been the length
of the bright old lady’s residence
here, and during that time she has
raised thirteen stalwart sons and
daughters, though some unhappily
have been removed by death. 1 am
anxious to get the names of the
first settlers of the Marsh. Mrs.
Mahoney regrets that her husband
is not physically capable of testing
his memory, for he had played a
prominent part in local life, and
could - have recited many interesting
events that took place in those
early days. I am kindly given per-
mission to inspect a number of re-
cords which the daughter, Miss Ma-
honey, and the nephew, Mr. Con.
McFarlane, place before rue. Tin-


doubtedly the first law of nature
is order, and Mr. Con. Mahoney ob-
served it, for all those letters, cir-
culars, plans, &c., have been most
carefully kept, even retained in their
original envelope if correspondence.
For instance, here is a list of con-
tributions towards the erection of
a building for a Central Common
School at Bacchus Marsh, in the
form of sums of money or providing
material or labor, opposite the re-
spective names. I select a few:
James Young, £2O ; Joseph B.
Perrey, 12/ ; and Mrs. Perrey, 5/
in potatoes. How potatoes entered
into material of school is not stated.
Thomas Brown, £5 ; Cornelius Ma-
honey, £3 ; and so on. Subscription
list is dated 186 3, only 51 years
ago. In giving history of the Bac-
chus Marsh Contingent of Light
Horse, Mr. Mahoney was listed as
a Lieutenant, but in the numerous
letters from head-quarters which I
peruse he is addressed as Captain
Mahoney; and in the retired list of
1881, published by authority, Cap-
tain Mahoney is recorded as having
retired on 28th January 1876. A
newspaper cutting informs that the
old volunteer force was disbanded
with much regret, by His Excellency
the Marquis of Normanby, 17th Jan.,
1884. A paragraph in the Governor’s
memorandum is worthy of being
quoted —"lt is to be regretted that
this purely voluntary and honorable
service has not received more hearty
recognition from the public, and that
the wealthy mercantile, professional
and leisured classes, which at the
initiation of the volunteer movement
joined in considerable numbers, both
as privates and officers, have for
many years ceased to belong to, or
take any active interest in the force;
but this only augments the honour
and credit due to those who, not-
withstanding, remained perseveringly
at their posts.” A document in, re-
gard to Trusteeship of new Mec-
hanics’ Institute claims attention. It
is dated 1883. The gift of Mr. Man-
ning of a piece of land on which to
erect Mechanics’ causes some uncer-
tainty. Legal opinion is given clear-
ly as to liability of the two original
trustees, to the effect there was none.
The document is just as if • it had
been written yesterday. A notifica-
tion of the Government Gazette,
Sept. 7th, 1877, Ordering the Bac-
chus Marsh Troop 7th P.W.V.L.
Horse to return into store at Quarter-
Master Crook's residence, Bacchus
Marsh, all arms, appointments, uni-
forms, &c., the property of the Go-
vernment, and the uniforms of the
Cavalry Regiment, within fourteen
days from the date, under certain
penalties if order is not obeyed. Cap-
tain Mahoney gets a special letter of
thanks from Officer Commanding the
Forces for the care and trouble taken
relative to the ordering into store
of the arms, accoutrements, &c., of
the late Bacchus Marsh Troop of
Light Horse. The list of enrolment,
December 12, 186 3, is well preserv-
ed. It is in reality a valuable his-
torical heirloom, so far as locality is
concerned. Seventy-two names ap-
pear, and age, height, and profession
are given. Mr. Wm. Llye, J.P., is
recorded in stature 6-ft. IJ-in. Not
bad for a youth of 17. I come across
another enrolment earlier, the date
of being sworn in October, 1860.
John Sisson Cooper heads, one list,
and a Mr. Grant of Pentland Hills
the other. A plan of the Marsh in
earliest times, when under Sydney,
is particularly interesting. It
shows signs of the decay of age, but
not of rough usage. There are five
sections, each running from river
to river, and a road marked "from
Melbourne to the Portland district.”
Only two homesteads, both same
owner, “Bacchus’ Station.” Sections
are lettered as follows : 103 acres,
selected by A. McCrae, Esq., rich
black soil, thinly timbered, 89 acres,
selected by P. Inglis, Esq.; 60 acres,
selected by P. Inglis, Esq.; 107 ac.
selected by A. McCrae, Esq., fine
alluvial land, clear of timber ; 84
acres, selected by F. A. Jeffreys, Esq.
A crosswise cart track is indicated,
a road to Pentland Hills, Werribee
and Lerderderg rivers, otherwise plan
is bare. The report of the Engineer
which led to forming the main road
is voluminous, and from a literary
point of view is rather fine diction.
I feel that it is a great loss that
Mr. Mahoney is not able to go back
upon the past, for in the life of the
community he has ben no incon-
siderable factor, but Mrs. Mahoney
is able to tell us much of the for-


ties, and in response to that request
commences at 1849. On the other
side of the river , there was a family
living called Crowe, renting land
form Moore & Griffith. Moore was
afterwards connected with Savings
Bank of Melbourne. Moore & Grif-
fith lived at Glenmore station. They
occupied country right down to the
river Werribee. They ran sheep
and cattle, but sheep chiefly. Two
very nice gentlemen. The holdings
of James Cowan, Vallence brothers,
&c., is still called Crowe’s flat. Be-
yond was .a family Steiglitz, after
whom the town “Steiglitz” is named.
Captain Bacchus with his son Henry,
lived in Manor House. Captain
Bacchus had bricks made for the
house, the brick kiln being in front
of Mr. George Ramsey’s residence,
very few resided on the Marsh in
the forties. A family called Speed
lived on Lerderderg river, kept a
dairy farm. Where Mr. James Wat-
son now 1 resides Ganger & Cook had
a holding. Cook lived in town.
Ganger retired and Cook bought
out his interests, Charles Densley,
father of the Densley brothers, had
a house somewhere in the vicinity
of present residence of Mr. McGrath.
He used to drive a team of bullocks
backwards and forwards to Mel-
bourne. Leahy, down at Hopetoun,
was farming—a very good farmer—
with his two brother-in-laws, John
and Michael Egan. He rented that
place from Lady Franklin, wife of
the Great Arctic Explorer. He shifted
higher up the hill, where Miller’s
home afterwards was located, and
eventually established a hotel.
Clarke who lived by shearing, and
Bailey, a blacksmith, occupied that
brick house near Mr. Harvey Barra-
dell’s. Clarke sold out his share,
and going further down the Marsh
built a house near the present home-
stead of Mr. Alfred Slack. The
bridge close by is named Clarke’s
bridge. Mr. Crook built Woolpack,
and kept it for years. He had hotel
in a wooden house before that was
built. No Border Inn then. Mrs.
Crook’s father and mother, Mr. and
Mrs. Athorn, lived other side of
Woolpack, Captain McCrae and
Lieut. Jeffrey never lived here. Cap-
tain Bacchus ran sheep on their al-
lotments. Mr. Con. Mahoney, as a
young man, was sent by his father
up to Inglis’ homestead at Ingliston
to ask Peter Inglis to fence a part
of boundary between two holdings
on flat. He offered to sell his allot-
ment, rather than fence it, at 7/6
per acre. That land reaches now
about £IOO per acre. Mr. Mahoney
replied that he had enough of land
and didn’t want- any more. The flood
in those days used to go all over
the land. Mr. Mahoney owned 200
acres. The Portland road was never
surveyed nor gazetted. After having
fenced his property on both sides of
Portland road, he had again to fence
when survey of road was made, but
Mr, Mahoney never got compensa-
tion. Later on comes a Mr. James
residing near Woolpack, but this
house was formerly occupied by a
Mr. Barton. Mr, James kept fine
draught horses, and in reality a
stud farm.' Mrs. Mahoney went on
to relate that when “Argus” first
came out they used to get it twice
a week, and Mr. Mahoney kept for
years copies of the Port Phillip
“Patriot,” first paper established in
Melbourne. The Woolpack origin-
ally, in addition to being a hostelry,
was a Court house and Post-office,
A cellar underneath was the lock-up,
The Oddfellows held meetings in
the Woolpack. lam shown a black-
fellow’s waddy. When Mr. Ma-
honey was returning from a meeting
of the Oddfellows Lodge one night
he came across an aboriginal
Tommy Woolley, who was belaboring
his gin with vigorous blows. She
appealed to Mr. Mahoney for pro-
tection. Tommy Woolley’s explan-
ation of the cause of the strife was
that his dusky partner had been
partaking of too much brandy, pre-
sented to her at the Woolpack, and
he was thus using force to get her
homewards. Mr. Mahoney appropri-
ated the waddy. In the S.W. corner
of IVIr. Peter Cain’s allotment was a
burying ground, and the remains of
five or six people were interred
there, an old woman named Nash, a
couple of children belonging to Mrs,
Clarke, a consumptive young man
who stayed with her, and others.
Mr. Mahoney read the burial ser-
vices over the greater number of
these. I am told of the first bus-
iness place in Marsh. When Mr.


Young came first to Marsh his mil-
ler was Mr. W. Lyle, who dwelt in
a cottage in mill yard. Mrs. Lyle
opened up a little shop which served
to be of great convenience. It was
hitherto,- a custom to beseige anyone
going to Melbourne to do certain
purchases, from a reel of cotton to
a ship’s anchor. They were not al-
ways fulfilled. Eventually Mr. W.
Lyle, gave up milling, and settled
on what is now termed Lyle’s creek:
in the opinion of Mr. James
Urquhart a property with possibili-
ties second to none. Mrs. Kerr
succeeded in the little shop, but in
time sold out and took a farm at
Parwan, now in possession of a
son, Mr. W. Kerr.
It was entertaining to listen to
Mrs. Mahoney, as, with pleasant cor-
rect utterance, she described the
past of a community in which she
has spent the greater part of her
life. She had nothing but good to
relate. Probably there was the
little scandal that might have been
mentioned, you know just in confi-
dence, but Mrs. Mahoney could only
speak well of her neighbours, and at
the bottom of her heart I knew there
was poignant sorrow that her hus-
band was not able to do the recount-
ing, who she said would have done
it much better than herself. It will
be acknowledged that Mrs. Mahoney
has contributed much interesting
matter to . the chronicles of the
earlier life of Bacchus Marrsh.
Stanclfield’s Engineering Tasks.
Reference has been made more
than once in these memoirs (if such
a term may be used) of the early life
of Bacchus Marsh, to the main Bal-
larat and Melbourne road. The fra-
grant chestnut still has currency, and
is related with much gusto, as to
the boggy nature of the highway
traversing the flat before the prin-
ciples of Dr. Macadam were applied
locally. That road from Balldrat
and Melbourne was indeed boggy, as
it passed through the Werribee and
Lerderderg basin, and Mr. J. E.
Crook, an enterprising man, kept
that splendid team of bullocks on
hand for hire in cases of emergency.
Safely negotiating that boggy pinch,
the teamster, with a continued help
up the rough broken steep ascent to
the plateau, might then pass on to
Melbourne with some reasonable
amount of success. ‘ But the passage
through the Marsh, during a wet
season, was the piece 'de resistance.
The Lerderderg and Werribee in
those days had shallow beds, and
any downpour would cause the whole
flat to be flooded. We all know the
said old chestnut —how a traveller
getting near the Woolpack saw a
man sunk in the road, with his head
just appearing above the surface.
He was extricated from his perilous
position, and then asked if the
stranger would kindly help him to
•unearth his bullocks and waggon,
that were still further down below!
Evidently with the progress Of time
the highway was not at all satis-
factory, especially as much traffic was
arising between Melbourne and Bal-
larat. Cobb’s coach —I wonder was
it driven in those times by our late
respected old inhabitant, Mr. Johnny
Lovelock ? —had some vivid experi-
ences. Mrs. Mahoney tells how the
coach and four had a bad time just
along their paddock. The wheels
were thoroughly engulfed, and the
driver and passengers pulling down
a few panels -of Mr. Mahoney’s fence
were earnestly engaged in trying to
lever the coach up. Mr. Mahoney
observing what had happened, went'
across and offered his services. They
were accepted. He took twq of his
working bullocks, and putting them
in the place of the two leading
horses, the coach was soon drawn on
to firm ground. The coachman of-
fered payment. Mr. Mahoney stated
he was pleased to help anyone, but
added that if ever the coachman got
into difficulties again, would he kind-
ly not remove two or three of his
panels without his permission. I
peruse a letter from Mr. Standfield,
Secretary and Engineer, July 31st,
1883, to concerned landholders in re-
gard to preservation of the Ballarat-
Melbourne road from injury by
As the scheme propounded
by the Engineer included banking
and improving the channel of the
river Lerderderg for a considerable
distance, it was essential that the
consent of the landholders through
whose properties the portion _of the
river proposed to be dealt with ran,
should first be obtained. I propose


to condense that elaborate statement
by the Engineer, for it really is of
historical value to the community.
The main Melbourne to Ballarat
road, from Tullamore cottage to the
commencement of Meikle’s contract,
at the east end of the Marsh, about
100 chains, had been exposed for
many years to the overflow of the
Lerderderg river and was in such a
state of bad repair as to be almost
impassable. The causes were cited ;
the deposition of sludge brought
down from the Blackwood diggings,
and the protection works undertaken
■ by Mr. Ryan and the other land-
owners to save their properties from
destruction by floods. The Black-
wood diggings opened in 1854, and
the process' of silting up had been
augmented by the erosion of the
river banks between McKenzie and
Darley flats. Mr. Ryan’s protection
works had momentous results—the
closing up of the main channel that
carried the storm water through his
flat lands in a north-easterly dir-
ection, towards the foot of the hill
behind the willows, and thence across
the main road above, and under the
three bridges west of the brewery.
As long as this channel was kept
open, .the road between Tullamore
cottage and Meikle’s contract suffered
little injury ; but in consequence of
the enormous body of water precipi-
tated across the road at the brewery,
the inadequacy of the bridges to
carry it, and the silting up of the
channels below them, the road at
this place was completely destroyed.
Aided by a Government grant the
Council, in 1874, cut a direct channel
from the end of the willows to the
Werribee, raised the road for a dis-
tance of about 50 chains, and by
providing culverts and other flood
accommodation, eventually repaired
this section of the road. Contemp-
oraneously, almost with the progress
of the Council’s works, Mr. Ryan
was proceeding with his scheme for
protecting his valuable flats. He
opened out, as far as the east bound-
ary, the small branch creek which
carried the surplus waters past the
foot of the Woolpack garden, and
then embanked river frontage along
the whole length of his property.
The flood waters were thus forced
on to the road between Tullamore
cottage and the Woolpack, and
thence into the Werribee near Mr.
James’ house. The small channel
behind the'Woolpack being also sur-
charged, and furthermore obstructed
by an irrigation dam, discharged a
large volume of water on to the
road at Costello’s house. Sludge in
large quantities was left on the ad-
joining lands; thereby raising their
level. The road on the other hand
owing to its comparatively smooth
surface, afforded no lodgment for
the silt, and being exposed to long-
itudinal and transverse scour, was
gradually lowered. It was not till
Mr. Ryan raised an embankment in-
side the fence of Gleeson’s farm that
the overflow through Mahoney’s pad-
dock caused an accumulation of silt
on the' road between Tullamore and
the iron school; and in the adjoin-
ing section as far nearly as the
Woolpack Inn, a similar result fol-
lowed the embanking executed by
Mr. Miller immediately within the
fence of the Broadlands home pad-
dock. The road in time of freshet
or- flood was subject to longitudinal
scour along its whole length, and
became in consequence of being the
lowest ground, a channel i for the
conveyance of storm water. Such
was the state of an important por-
tion of the highway as depicted in
the terse expression of Engineer
Standfield. If that able officer could
to-day visit the locality, and notice
that particular section of the road
being a victim »to the longitudinal
scour of sewerage waters of the com-
munity I have an idea that his re-
port would be rather sensational. 1
like Mr. Standfield's power of des-
scription. Here is a sample : “It is
evident to the most superficial ob-
server that almost as soon as the
Lerderderg enters the fertile allu-
vial flats in-the Bacchus Marsh val-
ley, the channel of the river is con-
stricted to such an extent as to be-
come altogether too small for the
efficient discharge of the floods that
periodically flow down from the
Blackwood watershed. The narrow
waterway is moreover tortuous; the
banks are fringed for a consider-
able length with a heavy growth of
scrub, saplings, and trees of large
size, whilst the bed of the river is
in many places obstructed with logs


and other debris so firmly impacted
in silt that the force of the severest
flood is insufficient for their re-
moval.” The engineer has a mathe-
matical paragraph. He gives elab-
orate data for his computation that
in round numbers 1,000 square feet
of water passing underneath Barley
bridge is thrust over the south bank
and on to road, the first point of
overflow being the large bend a
short distance above Mr. Henry
McFarlane’s house in Barley (pre-
sumably Cr. W. H. McFarlane).
Engineer Standfleld expresses his
opinion that the only radical way
of coping with the difficulty was by
so enlarging and improving the
channel of the river as to enable it
to carry between its banks the whole
of the storm water collected within
the watershed. He was entirely
against such schemes as raising the
road either on an embankment with
or without flood openings, or even
on open timber work, apart from
their expense, and the -certainty of
involving the Council in future
legal liabilities, as being ineffective
unless river was primarily dealt
with. Owing to impossibility of en-
suring transverse fall, silting up
would continue, Mr. Standfield’s re-
commendation was that a conference
of the Council and the persons
whose lands were affected by the
proposed work should be convened
for the purpose of devising a scheme
of river and road improvement, the
main feature of which would be
embanking, clearing and otherwise
enlarging the channel of the Ler-
derderg, from a poiht above McFar-
lane’s bend to Pezet’s bridge, near
the brewery, a distance of 160
chains ; and reforming and metal-
ling (without necessarily raising)
main road between Tullamore cot-
tage and Meikle’s contract. Minor
details of plan would comprise re-
moving iron school and erecting a
more suitable structure in Lerder-
derg' street ; all scrub saplings and
greater portion of large trees to be
cleared from river channel and sides,
and crest of the embankment, which
should present long flat slopes com-
mencing a few feet below the level
of the summit of the present banks,
should be at least one chain from
the main channel on both sides. By
adopting this course the grazing and
arable area would not be interfered
with —on the contrary there would
be slight increase, and ample space
would be provided, for the transit
of flood waters. To provide shade
and shelter for stock, native and
exotic trees might be . planted on
the ridge of the artificial banks.
By the use of temporary and easily
removable weirs, with pipes perfor-
ating the banks, and fitted with
sluices, irrigation could be carried
on as effectually and with as little
expense as at the present time. The
reputation of Mr. Standfleld as a
sound engineer remains to this day,
and the ingenuous report which has
been freely condensed, will only ac-
centuate the justness of that repu-
tation. Approximate estimate of
various works, included in suggested
scheme, were appended : 320 chains
of embankment, at £3, £960 ; earth-
work, clearing and trimming banks,
£320 ; taking down school and re-
erecting, &c., £550 ; enlarging Bez-
el's bridge, £300; reforming road,
&c., £600; incidentals, £300; total,
£3,030. The “Express” fought tooth
and nail for that Simmons’ * Reef
storage, but a siphon under the
Lerderderg has evidently obviated
it, and the Lerderderg, instead of
being made amenable to the treat-
ment, as propounded by Engineer
Standfleld, may periodically make
serious depredation on area of richest
soil at its own sweet will, laughing
at the futile efforts of Mr. Thomas
Anderson and other landowners of
providing screen in form of dis-
used 400-gallon iron tanks, and even
concrete work, and that innocent
little gutter, put by authority of
Council, to free the land from the
surplusage of water, is now the bed
of a river.
I am indebted to Mr. Crisp 'for
material. I get possession of a man-
uscript of notes, &c., all bearing on
our subject. A couple of extracts
from Romsey “Examiner” catch my
eye at once. “April 9, 1886. Mr,
D. A. Little will enter upon his new
duties as rate collector, valuer, and
rabbit inspector at Bacchus Marsh
on Monday next. He takes /with
him from this Shire the hearty well
wishes of a large circle of friends,


who will always be glad to hear of
his success in the world.” “Janu-
ary 7, 1887. We offer our congratu-
lations to Mr. David A. Little, of
Bacchus Marsh, upon his marriage,
on New Year’s Day, with Miss Han-
nigan, of Lancefleld.” The congrat-
ulations were not misdirected, for
Mr, Little has risen to responsible
position, and his family have achiev-
ed notable academical ' distinction.
Mr. Little was for over 20 years Sec-
retary and Engineer of Bacchus
Marsh Shire, succeeding Mr. Stand-
field.
Earliest Colonists.
A letter in the accumulation of
ancient data is interesting:—“Benev-
olent Asylum, 2 3rd . August, 1887.
Mr. C. Crisp, Dear 1 Sir, I am sorry
I cannot give you any particulars of
the gold obtained in Cockatoo gully,
as I never worked there. As regards
the plain, I, with Bruton and Thomas,
put in four tunnels under the same,
and obtained some nice'samples of
gold, driving east from Goodman’s
creek side. Nuggets up to 30-dwts.
were found, but it was extremely
patchy, and difficult to follow (date
May, 1871, of finding nuggets). The
tunnel furthest 'north was driven
about 6 00 feet from the mouth, until
it rose up too high to continue work,
and all trace of wash disappeared.
We drove numerous branch drives,
but could not get any trace of a run.
After I left Bruton, he tried on the
other side of. the Plain, that is, the
east side, and got some nice gold,
but not sufficient to induce him to
go to any great expense to follow it.
I am sorry I cannot give you any
further particulars. I can, however,
say that if I had any wish to pros-
pect further I should continue a
drive or tunnel across the plain to
the opposite side, from Goodman’s
creek, and I think a good patch of
gold would 'be found, but whether
it would pay for the trouble I can-
not say. Your truly, Marshall Per-
kins Farrall.”
Goodman’s Creek was opened in
May, 1854, by Mr. Cornelius Ma-
horiey, who says • that a man at
Dandenong obtained £2,000 worth of
gold put of it. I come across some
biography : Charles Carter (proper
name Densley), resident at east end
of Bacchus Marsh valley for about
30 years. Came to Bacchus Marsh
in 1837 or 1842 (accounts vary) as
a bullock driver of Captain Bacchus.
Ran away from his parents in Tas-
mania, hence took the name of
“Carter,” or “Charlie the Carter.”
Twite married ; always a sober man,
quiet, never used bad language. First
lived near Mahoney’s; died Septem-
ber, 1905 ; supposed to have been
over 90.
A letter by Mr. Cornelius Mahoney
appeared in the “Argus”—“Sir, 1
noticed in the “Argus,” of which i
am a constant reader, an account of
the passing away of Mr. Robert
Laidlaw, who arrived in Melbourne,
June 15, 1839, with the query as
to who now has the honor of being
the oldest colonist. I beg to inform
you of one older still left, namely,
myself. I arrived in Melbourne in
May 24, 1838. Yours, &c., Cornelius
Mahoney.” Mr. Crisp has full notes
on Mr, Mahoney, who came to Bac-
chus Marsh with his parents 'in
March, 1844. I produce the notes ;
Left for California in August, 1849;
was away till November, 1852, when
he returned to Bacchus Marsh. Walk-
ed from Melton, was dressed in
Arherican style, and carried an
American rifle over his arm. Was
privately warned at Melton that there
were bushrangers on the road, Kept
a careful look out. On nearing Deep
Creek caught sight of four cabbage-
tree hats above the bushes. Pre-
tended not to see them. Went to the
creek, drank some water, at the same
time watching the hats. Walked on.
They did not stop him. At the top
of the hill, overlooking the Marsh,
a tall thin man, with hooked nose,
well dressed, mounted on horseback,
and with two pistols on his saddle,
asked Mr. Mahoney if he had seen
any cattle on the road; as he had
lost some, and was looking for them'.
“No,” was the reply, “have not seen
any living thing." “Oh, you are
from the States, are you not ?”
“Yes.” “That is an American rifle
you have; will you let me look at
it ?” “Yes, there it is” (holding it
out). “But won’t you let me exam-
ine it ?” (at the same time wheeling
his horsp to get at the back of Mr.
Mahoney). “No.” (also wheeling
round) “I. never give up my arms


unless compelled. You had better
be off out of this. It is not cattle
you want,- but men ; where is your
stcck-whip ? I saw four men below,
they were the cattle you wanted me
to see.” ‘‘Oh, you are mistaken,
really,” (laughing) and so rode off,
Mr, Mahoney found, afterwards that
this man was a noted bushranger—
Captain Melville. He and his mates
had been camped near Deep Creek
for some weeks, stopping men re-
turning to Melbourne from the dig-
gings. Mr. Mahoney tried to get the
Constables at Bacchus Marsh to re-
turn with, him to clear out the gang,
but they would not do so. The men
heard this, and left. I have be-
fore given reasons for doubting that
Captain - Melville was ever in the
vicinity of the Marsh.
Notes —Thomas ’ Manley, of Grey-
stones, Rowsley, came out with late
Richard Manning, in Mr. Molesworth
Greene’s service, in 1847, having been
engaged in Ireland by Mr. Greene’s
fattier. Remained in Mr. Greene’s
service ever since, until about 1901.
Mr. Louis Scott arrived in Bacchus
Marsh 1850, aged 29. Died in 1904.
His son John died 10th October,
19 05, aged 42. Mr. James Hegarty
arrived in Bacchus Marsh 1850, was
shipmate with. Mr. L. Scott.
History of Woolpack Inn : Was
built by late Mr. J. E. Crook . in
1849. He opened the old Woolpack
hotel in 1845. Mr. Crook was the
first postmaster. The mail to Port-
land used to be taken on horseback
through Bacchus Marsh. W. Sterritt
carried the mail. The lessees of
Woolpack were J. E. Crook, Pyke,
Galepin, Reeves, Living, W. Crook,
Ottaway. License ceased in 1862.
■ Property sold to Mr. Albert Miller
in 1896. In 1910 leased to Mr. Ed-
ward Simpson as an abattoirs. Mrs.
Crook died at Mentone 6th February,
1908, aged 83; was buried in Church
of England grounds, Bacchus Marsh,
surrounding the church, the last in-
terment allowed therein.
The manuscript, is not arranged,
because Mr, Crisp just dotted down
the information as he gleaned it
. from different sources, and on dif-
ferent subjects. Mr. James Cowan,
of Pentland Hills, was born in 1818.
Came to Bacchus Marsh in 1852.
Took, up land on McKenzie’s flat.
Lerderderg. Walked to Melbourne
in 18 53 to see Surveyor-General. Ap-
plied to have land thrown open for
sale. The Surveyor-General explain-
ed steps to be taken by petition sign-
ed by not less than seven persons.
Mr. Cowan got three surveys of 2,000
acres each made, covering the Pent-
land Hills, up to Greendale. He then
bought one piece, where he lived at
time of (leath. He paid £1 per bush-
el for seed wheat. Mr. Cowan once
judged the whole of six sections at.
an early Bacchus Marsh show, from
draught stock down to poultry, in-
cluding cattle, sheep, and pigs. He
had two colleagues, W, Thurston and
R. Parkinson, who left all judging
to him. Parkinson would give a
bull a prize because it had been
placed 'first at two other shows, but
Mr. Cowan declined to be guided by
that. It was the opinion of Mr.
Cowan that any animal will show at
one year what it will be at five years.'
It -will change in all directions dur-
ing the intervening years, but will
come back at five years to what ,it
was at one year. He stated that
Ayrshire cattle will breed at one
year, therefore all their tendency is
to make milk. The breeding deteri-
orating by crossing with Devons, to
get size. Mr. Cowan died at Rose-
bank, Myrniong, on Ist November,
19 06, in his 8 9th year. He was
born at Ayr Scotland. Mr. Jas.
Cowan, the well-known orchardist,
Mr. John Cowan and Mr. Thomas
Cowan, residents of Bacchus Marsh
are his nephews.
Mr. W. Henry McFarlane, sen.,
J.P., came to Bacchus Marsh in
1854, started farming for himself in
18 56. Cr. McFarlane is still hearty,
a prominent and useful citizen. It
was evidently Mr. Crisp’s intention
to have given the biography of the
old inhabitants. I find certain head-
ings. Cr. John Graham, Greendale,
born December, .1830. Mathew Lind-
say, born Ist February, 183 8. \V.
Morton, Werribee Vale, born in 18 34.
T. Rutherford, Racecourse road,
born in 1834. W. Grant, Millbank,
born in 1857. Mr, Thomas Cain,
J.P., born in 1849, It is to be re-
gretted that the axactions of an ac-
tive life prevented Mr. Crisp glean-
ing details, for what could be more
interesting to a community that those


sidelights of the career'of its foun-
ders ? Many have passed away, and
the opportunity is lost. But the life
of the late Mr. Robert Kerr, Parwan,
is given in full.
Biographies Of Pioneers. (
Mr. llobt. Kerr.
The late Mr, Root. Kerr, Parwan,
was born at Anstruther, Fifeshire,
Scotland, on 24th May 1811. Left
for America, June, 1837 ; was five
years in Pittsburg managing a store;
was brought up to bootmaking.
Left Pittsburg on his mother’s death,
and returned to Scotland. Left for,
Melbourne, as his brother James had
preceded him. Came out from
Greenock, in the “Thomas Arbuth-
not,” on one of her first voyages,
bringing emigrants, the first free
batch who arrived here. Reached
Australia 1841. Opened a bootshop
in Collins street, two storey house,
site of George & George’s first shop,
now Glen’s, property owned by
Fleming. Landed at Liardet’s beach
now Port Melbourne; two houses
there. Melbourne post-office was a
small wooden place, where it stands
now. A big gully there. The Yarra
Falls, to keep back the saltwater
was just completed. Went into Fawk-
ner’s hotel in Little Collins street,
to see the first gold that came down
from Ballarat. Paid 1/6 to see it,
and got a “nobbier” for 1/. Mr.
Kerr spent eight years in Melbourne,
St. Francis’ Church was then out of
the town. The principal buildings
were in Swanston and Queen streets.
Little Bourke street was the limit in
one direction; Elizabeth street the.
main street. Had to go up to Queen
street to avoid a gully near the old
cattle yards. Sir William Stawell
was a prominent man in the colony,
also Sir Redmond Barry. The con-
spicuous structures were the English
Church (St. James’) Dalgety’s stores,
and Turnbull & Orr, Mr. Grant’s
shop (father of Mr. W. Grant, Mill-
bank) was in little Collins street,
Mr. Kerr bought a property in Smith
street, Collingwood. In that part it
was all bush. Patterson & Grant
bought a cattle station at St. Ger-
man’s, Western Port. No metalled
streets. All hotels lit with candles;
no street lamps.
Mr. W. Grant came out in the
Lysander, with Thomas, Alexander
and John Patterson. Mr. Thomas
Patterson went on the .wharf. He
was a forester, and he got work at
the first wharf put up in Flinders
street.’ Alex. Patterson ."was at Ade-
laide two years before, and he ad-
vised his father to come out. Mr.
Thos. Patterson, sen., brought out
his family on death of his wife.* It
was an emigrant ship, 300 on board,
and a 96 days’ passage. He went to
diggings in 1851. O’Shanessy (after
Sir John O’Shanessy) arrived about
same time as Mr. Kerr. He had an
hotel at one time in Little Collins
street. The late Mr. Michael Crocker,
of Blackwood, was a shipmate of
O’Shanessy. He left Melbourne when
diggings opened, and his destination
Blackwood.
Mr. Kerr did not see any blacks
in Melbourne. Biggest camp was at
Merri Creek, above Clifton Hill, The
natives were mostly begging. Buck-
ley was sent away to Van Diemen’s
Land about 1840, because the blacks
threatened to kill him for sending
so many white people out. Mr. Kerr
imported, per Lech Nagar, a large
lot of boots, the best assortment ever
consigned to one man, comprising all
kinds, from baby’s shoes to those fit
for an actress on the .stage. As
times were dull (boiling down was
resorted to by squatters to pay their
way) he called a sale of his stock.
The late E. Cohen, afterwards Mayor
of Melbourne, &c., conducted it, as
his first sale. It was stopped for
want of bidders shortly after it
opened. Some of the stock was sold
at. Geelong. Governor Latrobe was
in charge when Mr. Kerr came. Re-
member an attempt to increase his
salary. All the water supply was
carried in barrels. There was a
Theatre in Queen street; J. T. Smith
owned it. The “Argus” was carried
on by W. Kerr. The first paper was
produced by J. P. Fawkner. People
took up land to suit themselves, and
paid a licence of £lO for each hut.
Mr. Kerr had recollection that Simon
Staughton was a bookbinder. In
1850 Mr. Kerr came to. Bacclius
Marsh; had been persuaded to do so
by the late Mr, Jas. Young, miller
and storekeeper, who had come from
Kilmore. He was formerly in busi-
ness at the Wannon. Mr. Ken-


brought a lot of stock with him, and
opened at Bacchus Marsh in Mr.
Young’s store, for which he paid £1
a week rent. This store was after-
wards the office of the Road Board.
Mr. Kerr married Miss Catherine
Fleming, 13th October, 1848, the
ceremony being performed by Rev.
Hatherington. Mrs. Kerr had arriv-
ed in the ship Ann Millen, on the
last day of December, 1846. Among
the passengers was the late Rev.
Ramsey, also the grandmother and
mother of. Madam Melba. Madam
Melba’s mother’s name was Dow.
Among passengers were Dr. Thom-
son and his wife, whose sons had
preceded them to Australia. One of
the sons boarded the vessel in rough
blue serge shirt, and on entering his
mother’s cabin she fainted away, as
she thought a bushranger had seized
the vessel.
Mrs. Kerr soon resolved to get a
store of her own at Bacchus Marsh,
and bought the place latterly occu-
pied by Mr. John Saunders. ' She
bought it from a bricklayer, named
Rhodes, a very honest man, and
equally honest his wife, though
they were assigned servants to the
Hobbler family, who came from Tas-
mania, and had wliat was after-
wards McLeod’s station, then Mr.
Young's. This was before the dig-
gings broke out. Mr. Watt, land-
lord of Border Inn, was a very su-
perior man, most public spirited and
enterprising. He first told Mrs. Kerr
that gold had been found. Advised
her to buy up all the flour she could.
She did so at Young’s mill, but he
afterwards refused delivery of half
of what she had bought. Mr. Kerr
used to travel with a hawker’s wag-
gon. Did this for years. He travell-
ed over a large extent of country, and
afterwards made a round of the dig-
gings. He was accustomed at night
to light a lire near his waggon, but
<Kd not sleep in it for fear of being
attacked by bushrangers. He would
sleep within sight of the fire. Mr.
Kerr through his wanderings, was
able to relate much incident. A man
named Tom Forsyth was employed at
Spatt’s station, Wimmera. He went
to town with a waggon, and took a
black boy with him. He gave his
to the boy’s tribe that be would
bring him back. He camped out one i
night, leaving the boy in the waggon
and slept himself at the station. Dur-
ing the night some strange blacks
killed the boy. It was supposed
they did this to show their disap-
proval of a blackfellow working for
a white man. Forsyth had to leave
the station from which he took the
boy, because he could not return him
to the tribe. Mrs. Kerr was a par-
ticularly good recounter. What she
herself had experienced and what
she had learned from her husband
she could relate freely. There used
to be a good many blacks on Stam-
ford Hill. They came for Govern-
ment blankets, which Mr. Young
used to distribute. There was once
a corroboree of 15 0 blacks, seen by
Mr. Kerr. They used to leave in the
winter for Leigh road, Geelong dis-
trict. Mrs. Kerr was not afraid of
the blacks in Bacchus Marsh, but
when she lived at Par wan she had
fear of them, and when she heard
their voices, or suspected they were
coming, she would lock all the doors,
pull down the blinds, and with her
children creep under the bed. Her
husband was frequently away, as he
continued his occupation as a haw-
ker. Mrs. Kerr carried on the store
until 1854, when Mr. Kerr bought
the Parwan farm. He did this be-
cause Dr. Grant advised Mrs. Kerr to
leave storekeeping, as it was affect-
ing her health. She sold the busi-
ness to Mr. W. B. Marsh. His father
came out from London, and built
the stone store (now occupied by Mr.
F. Ashby, saddler).
Mrs. Kerr used to go to Melbourne
occasionally to buy goods. In 1-852
she started in a bullock dray with
the late Mr. John Simpson. Bush-
rangers frequented Deep Creek in
those days. When the dray reached
the Woolpack Inn, the late Captain
Dana came out and advised them to
return home, as he expected the
bushrangers to attack the township.
There was supposed to be a gang
of six. He had been watching for
them the preceding night at the
Woolpack. Mr. Simpson accordingly
turned back. Mrs. Simpson, who
had watched their departure, was
very glad to see the dray returning.
Mrs. Kerr slept that night in a hay
loft with the servant girl. The store
was not attacked. On one occasion


an attempt to rob Mrs. Kerr’s store
was made by a man named “Flash
Charlie,” who was afterwards hanged
for murder. This man had been
putting up stockyards for Mr. Watt,
at what is now Howe’s corner, of
Maddingley road. He got on Mrs.
Kerr’s books, and went away to the
diggings. He returned, pretending
to be wealthy. He bought a few
things with a £5 note, to see where
Mrs. Kerr kept her money. Next
morning he came again, before she
■was up, with another £5 note, for
which the servant girl had to go
into Mrs. Kerr’s bedroom to get
change. This changing of £5 notes
made Mrs. Kerr suspicious. She
peeped out, and saw the man com-
ing from behind the counter. That
day she had expected a man named
Ned, who was employed by Mr.
Watt’s, to bring her some cauli-
flowers. He did not come. On mak-
ing enquiries she found that Ned
was lying helplessly drunk, having
taken a glass of porter which “Flash
Charlie” had given him. It was
supposed to bo drugged. Charlie
came later in the day with another
£5 note. Mrs. Kerr .again *saw him
going behind the counter. She asked
him if he were robbing her. He
caught her by the throat, and she
defended herself with a piece of
merino. A mate of Charlie’s tried
to push Mrs. Kerr into her room.
Just then Mr. Young and Mr. Watt
came into the shop, and shut the
door on the men. There was a con-
sultation as to what was to be done.
Mrs. Kerr didn’t want the trouble
of prosecution, as this would take
her away from home. Mr. Young
asked what she would do. She said
if “Flash Charlie” paid his bill, and
promised to clear out, she would not
take proceedings against him. He
agreed to this, and paid the bill. On
another occasion an attempt was
made to rob Mrs. Kerr’s bedroom.
She had employed two men to cut
some hay, and had paid them. That
night Mr. Kerr came home unexpect-
edly. He had brought a good deal of
gold with him. During the night
she rose to shut a window, and saw
two men stealthily drawing near the
house. With the noise of the win-
dow being shut they ran away. Ser-
geant Roberts told them the next
day that the. store had been entered.
The men had tried the Border Inn,
but were disturbed by an old soldier
who lodged there. Mr. Kerr and
Mr. Young were among the first to
visit the Ballarat goldfield. They
saw the man who discovered the
gold. He was a blacksmith, from
Geelong. They had a view of the
gold, which was not a great quan-
tity. The man used to carry each
day’s find in a piece of paper. Mr.
Watt bought largely of hay, and
lost heavily by wet weather. He
paid Mr, Kerr £SOO once for a crop
taking off 18 acres'of Crowe’s Flat.
When the Kerr’s came to the Marsh
Mr. J. E. Crook had a slab hotel at
the Woolpack. Mr. Kerr had many
gold digging experiences to relate.
On one occasion, at Mt. Alexander
rush, lying in his tent, he saw a dig-
ger kill his mate accidentally. The
latter had left the tent. Some tin
dishes had been placed in 'the tent
opening to give warning if anyone
entered. The man who had gone
out of the tent for some purpose re-
turned and either not challenged or
not answering was shot dead. The
place was called “Murderer’s Flat’’
after that.
Mr. Crisp gained a wealth of
local historical incident from these
two old inhabitants, who have pas-
sed away. Mr. Robert Kerr died at
Parwan on 31st October, 1899, and
Mrs. Kerr at same place, 6th. Janu-
ary, 19 04. Mrs. Kerr’s memory must
have been very keen, and undoubted-
ly she must have had great powers
of observation, for nothing occurred
in the early days of the Marsh with
which she was not apparently con-
versant. I proceed to reproduce.
Miss Hobbler married Captain Bac-
chus’ son. The two sons of Mr. and
Mrs. Hobbler left Bacchus Marsh for
California, about 184 8. They
there met the late Mr. Cornelius
Mahoney, while the three were tak-
ing shelter under a tree. They wrote
to their mother telling her about
the meeting, and she informed Con’s
mother, who was anxious to know
what had become of him’ mail facil-
ities probably not being plentiful
those days. Mr. Mahoney and the
Hobbler Bros, experienced that the
world is only small after all. There
was a great flood in Bacchus Marsh


in 1853. The water was right up
to middle rail of fence. Thousands
of mice took shelter on fences. The
river Werribee crossed the main
road near .Paterson's shop. It was
up to level of mill verandah. Kerr's
kept the flood out of their shop with
bags. A man called Carter was ly-
ing with a broken leg at Hopetoun.
He was removed by Mr. James
Young. In Mrs. Kerr’s ' house the
flood waters actually raised the car-
pet. A rope was stretched from the
mill verandah to the road to enable
people to keep their feet while going
thropgh the water. The river was a
third of its present width and depth.
The late Mr. James Young was a
very sanguine hian. He had serious
losses. On a return from a visit to
Scotland, the first news he heard on
the ship arriving in the bay was that
a man at Blackwood, who owed him
£1,500, had absconded. Mr. Young'
had a store in Bacchus Marsh a short
time before Kerr’s came. The mill
was opened in 18 50. The machinery
was made at Langland’s foundry.
Mr. James Dow came up to start it.
Mr. Young paid a visit to Scotland
in 1854.
The late Mr. and Mrs. Kerr’s de-
scendants make a numerous family,
in children and grandchildren in our
midst, and to-day they have much to
thank ,their forebears, who had to
sustain all the hardships of pioneer-
ing life, and who, by self denial and
persevering diligence, made acquisi-
tion out of which they to-day reap
such benefit.
The Kerr family has achieved
academical distinction in the person
of Professor Grant Kerr, of the
Adelaide University. The Profesor
id a native of Bacchus Marsh, and
a grandson -of the late Mr. Robert
Kerr, of Parwan. A sketch of his
career appears in the Sept. “Lone
Hand,” under heading “Notable
Australians”:
NOTABLE AUSTRALIANS. ’
(Some account of Australians who
have made their mark in the
World.)
The Secretary in South Aus-
tralia in connection with the British
Association meetings is Professor
Kerr Grant, Professor of Physics at
Adelaide. Professor Grant is tall
and well-built, a good specimen of
the Australian type. He is a pro-
found mathematician, and excels in
the laboratory where experimental
work is like second nature to him.
Already he has achieved some dis-
tinction as an investigator. The
Professor is president of the South
Australian branch of the British
Science Guild, a body which is doing
most effective work for the com-
munity. He is well on the sunny
side of 40, and was born at Bacchus
Marsh, Victoria. He began by wim
ing a State school Scholarship at
Maffra in December, 1891. With
this he entered South Melbourne
College, where he continued as a
resident boarder for five years, and
the Principal of that well-known
school, Mr. -J, B. O’Hara, M.A.,
may well be proud of the achieve-
ments of his brilliant pupil, in' whom
he early recognised exceptional
talent, and did his best to help him
in his success.. Young Grant 'passed
his matriculation examination at the
close of his first year. At the end of
1904 he was first in the list of
Government exhibitions. The fol-
lowing year he won the matricu-
lation exhibition with first-class
honors in physics and chemistry, and
next year the Exhibition in Math-
ematics with first-class honors.’ En-
tering Ormond College he started his
University career most auspiciously
With exhibitions and scholarships.
His college career was eclipsed by
his achievements at Melbourne Uni-
versity. His University scholarships
and prizes represented a total value
of nearly £IOOO. He won every ex-
hibition and every scholarship for
which he competed, and with two
exceptions all with first-class honors.
He concluded a conspicuously bril-
liant course by winning the final
scholarship in Mathematics with
first-class honors. This was in 1900.
That Professor Grant has already at-
tained fame on the other side of the
world is shown in a remarkable note
in Professor J. Cox’s book “Beyond
the Atom.” Professor Cox writes :
“The work of Gray and Ramsay was
only rendered possible by an achieve-
ment in the Southern > Hemisphere
which well illustrates the gain o*f
power to science through the world-


wide co-operation of disinterested in-
vestigators. Dr. Steele and Mr.
Grant, of the University of Mel-
bourne, have constructed a balance
with a girder beam made of fine
silica rods, and devised a method of
weighing by displacement with it,
which allows the estimation of one
quarter of a millionth of a milligram.
The limit of sensibility of the finest
assay balance has hitherto been one
two-hundredth of a milligram. .
The credit of a wonderful feat of
manipulation is thus sha.red between
two hemispheres.” Dr. Bertram
Steele, who shares the credit of this
achievement, is now Professor of
Chemistry in the University of
Queensland. Professor Grant was at
the time on the teaching staff of the
Melbourne University.
I have made frequent mention of
Hobbler family, whose homestead is
now the property of Mr. Percy Mac-
Farlane. In the manuscript of Mr.
Crisp I find this cuttng, from “Aus-
tralasian,” Jan. 3 0, 1910 :
“The late Mr. George Hobbler was
for many years settled on the
Hunter, near Maitland. It was here
that he founded that herd of Here-
fords, which has for many years
past, under the guidance of the late
Mr. Charles and .the present Mr.
Frank Reynolds, done so much to-
wards improving the cattle-breeding
industry of Australia. This pioneer
seems to have been one of the most
unfortunate of men, and to have
made acquaintance during his pas-
toral career with more horrifying
misfortune than has befallen to the
lot of any others. His home was in-
vaded by bushrangers, and he was
pluckily saved from being murdered
by them through his wife’s presence
of mind. Though carrying a child
in her arms, she succeeded at the
critical moment in knocking up the
hand that held a pistol within a few
inches of her husband’s head. Her
child subsequently died from con-
vulsions, brought on by this episode.
When forced by droughts and finan-
cial collapse to throw up the sponge,
and relinquish his property in 1841,
Mr. Hobbler sold 300 head of cattle
for £6 0, that is to say, at the rate of
4s. per head. The same sort, of mis-
fortune persistently dogged his
career in this country. He had more
than his full share of smashingly
low prices and droughts, until finally,
in disgust, he left Australia, and
made tracks for California. There
his old pastoral instincts redeveloped
as strong as ever, and in like
manner along came a repetition of
previous horrors, and the worthy
battier was in the end forced to part
with all that remained of his sheep,
700 head, at lOd. a piece. From the
same herd that this pioneer sold to
the Reynolds family a few years
later —to be exact, on the 18th
August, 185 9 two oxen were sold
singly, at auction, to Messrs. Long
& Dodds, in Maitland, and brought
£4O each. So far *as the writer
knows, and can ascertain, this is
easily a record for beef. The pur-
chaser of one of these beasts is said
to have largely recouped himself
over his outlay by placing it on ex-
hibition to sightseers at Is. per head.
Small blame to him, in the absence
of any record of the weight being
sufficiently sensational to otherwise'
clear him.”
Another item of biography. Mr.
John Patterson, of Pentland Hills,
was born at Berwickshire, Scotland.
Scotchmen have undoubtedly proved
excellent colonists —perhaps success-
ful would be the better word. In
the Hospital Sunday collections,
Scotch church, of Collins street, al-
ways leads the way. Mr, ' Patterson
came to Victoria in 1841. He was
engaged in the baking business in
Melbourne for the late Mr. Wm.
Grant, of Millbauk, for about eight
years. He then went to Western
Port to his brother Alexander, at
St. Germains. He remained until
Ballarat opened. Went there in Oct.,
1851, and remained about three
weeks. Went to a rush at Castie-
maine. John Pilmer, who built the
Border Inn, was one of. the party.
Left Castlemaine, and commenced
carrying, with George Grant. Came
to Pentland Hills in 18 54. Bought
land in Oct., 1854 ; started on his
present place in Jan., 1855. Pilmer
and Waddell had the Bunyips hotel
at the Wannon. The late James
Young the store next door. Young
started milling at Kilrnore with
Allen. They separated. Allen had
the ‘money. Young was .a sort of


general servant. He came over and
joined John Lyle. Lyle’s was the
first mill in the colony, with Allison
& Knight, Flinders street. They
built a mill at Fujtons foundry.
Grant used to get his flour there
until Dight opened his mill to work
with water. Waddell bought a
station at Western Port. Piimer
built the Border Inn. There was an
hotel before then. Piimer was a
Border man. He was a groom at
home ; came out later than 1846.
Mr. Patterson did not know how the
name “Stamford Hill” originated.
He believed it was christened so by
Higgins, who lived on Stamford Hill.
He was a parson for a time. .Ser-
vices used to be held in the old mill.
There was no road from Bacchus
Marsh to Maddingley. There were
two crossings, one at the foot of
Stamford Hill, and the other at Mh-
honey’s. Piimer and Grant each
gave half a chain of the Maddingley
road. Watt commenced to build a
bridge. A few spars were put up,
but they were washed away. Watt
failed. The Road Board took the
bridge in hand. Watt used to buy
up the hay and supply Government
contracts. David Anderson (Win.
Anderson’s brother) had a wheel-
wright’s shop where Edwards’ forge
now stands. He made bricks out of
hole on property now occupied by
Mr. E. Morris. David Anderson sent
for W. Anderson and his family.
David Anderson was with the Pat-
tersons and Piimer at the diggings.
Mr. Patterson said the first part of
Melbourne metalled was at Town-
send’s corner, at junction of Eliza-
beth -and Collins street. A big gen-
eral store there did the best business.
Captain Dana, with his black police,
used to search for Buckley in Gipps-
land. The children of the blacks
were educated at Merri Creek. It
Vas supposed that blacks had killed
a white woman. Mr. Patterson was
at St. Germains on Black Thursday.
Everything was destroyed by the fire,
except buildings. Mr. Patterson was
at Dandenong races; met his brother
there and messenger came to warn of
approach of fire'. Went five miles or
s o to meet fire, and fought with it all
When they got home they found
the fire had passed. Only Mrs. Stev-
e hson and another woman there. A
creek diverted the fire. Big flood in
the Marsh in 18 57. Millbank Grant
had the ploughed land swept by the
flood. The Road Board blocked up
the old gully. Flood in Werribee in
1891 biggest since white man came-.
Took an acre from Patterson’s. It
rose feet above previous highest
flood. Late James Young got as
many farmers around him to grow
wheat as he could. Patterson and
Grant used to bring timber from
Macedon as back loading free to
build the old Presbyterian Church,
afterwards Pearce’s old store. Mr.
James Young was a carpenter by
trade. He erected huts on stations.
Mr. R. Kerr’s business in Melbourne
was not a large one. Mrs. John Pat-
terson died suddenly, from heart
failure, 10th November, 1907; she
was a daughter of the late Joseph
Anderson, of Lerderderg, who came
from Sydney to Melbourne in 1849.
He had five sons and five daughters.
Mr. John Patterson, who contributed
these notes to Mr. Crisp, is now liv-
ing at Ballan with his daughter.
Another biographical sketch.
Henry Alfred Living, lessee of Wool-
pack, was born in Surrey, England,
August 14th, 1826. He came to Bac-
chus Marsh in 1852. Woolpack was
built in 18 50. He remembered the
soldiers camped there at Eureka
time, and there was good business;
as takings at the hotel amounted to
£560. House open day and night
for a week. He was third mate of
barque Elizabeth, arriving in Mel-
bourne 184 8. Stopped three months
for cargo, went back through India
and China. Left England in 1857
per Persia, full rigged ship. Stopped
in Melbourne for a year; came to
Bacchus Marsh in 1852. Married in
1854 to a sister of Mr. J. E. Crook.
Mr. “Johnny” Lovelock, born in
183 9, native of Berkshire, came to
Melbourne from New York on 12th
August, 1853. Nine ships left at
same time. Spent his 16th birthday
at Border Inn, Bacchus Marsh. Went
to Blackwood rush. Was employed
at Golden Point store of Oxenham,
Cohen & Hagard. Had driven coaches
for Cobb & Co. on several routes in
Victoria. Died at Carlton. 26th
April, 1912. An affable unpreten-
tious man.
A. Hine, sen., came to Glenrnore


in May, 1853. He was then only
seven years of age. Could well re-
member the soldiers going through
that way to Eureka. It was then the
coach road. Ralph Wing Farmer
had a store at Parwan creek, where
bridge is now. Never saw such a
bad year as 1907, 1869 was the worst
previously.
Obituary notice : —On 7th July,
1887, at. his residence, Peerewur,
near Ballarat, William Henry Bac-
chus, aged 6 6 years. A note added
—Died worth £IO,OOO gross, left a
widow, a son, and a daughter.
“Martin Cosgrove, in the early
days, was as neat and clever a little
jockey as ever mounted a winner.”
So spoke an old admirer of Mr.
Martin Cosgrove, who, though the
years are accumulating, still holds
up his end of the stick. I thought
Mr. Cosgrove might have something
interesting to communicate of the
early days of the community and
we have an agreeable chat. The
family Cosgrove (father, mother
and children) sailed from Ireland in
the ship “The Persian,” and in May
1852, landed in Hobson’s Bay. They
were then brought up the Yarra in
a small steamboat to the jetty at
foot of Spencer street. “The Per-
sian” carried immigrants, and the
Cosgrove family with the rest were
taken to the Emigrants Depot, which
stood between Little Collins street
and Big Bourke street, and the West
Melbourne police station is on the
ground.
Readers of colonial history must
have recognised the part which “im-
migrants” have played in the build-
ing up of the State in times of early
settlement. The term “immigrant”
had not to many a pleasing sound,
but undoubtedly those so assisted
largely entered into the bone and
sinew of the colony; and our old
friend, Mr. Martin Cosgrove, is, in
the racing world at least, in evi-
dence, being the progenitor of one
of our greatest steeplechase riders.
The early' immigrant has this to his
credit, that if his purse was empty
his heart was filled with courage to
face all the discomforts and dangers
of pioneering life.
Mr, Cosgrove has not the kindest
recollection of the accommodation
afforded at the Emigrants’ Depot.
A shed formed three sides of the
yard, and each family occupied a
section, the whole having the ap-
pearance of stalls of a stable, and
there was a general cooking kitchen
in the middle of the yard. As each
family came out to get their food
they had to show their number.
Within a week Mr. Cosgrove, sen.,
obtained work at Brighton. He spent
twelve months there, in the employ
of Mr. William Swanston. Swanston
street is named after him. He kept
an ironmongery shop at corner of
Collins and Swanston streets. At
the end of the twelve months Mr.
Cosgrove, sen., came in to Melbourne
to live, and rented a big tent in
Madeline street, then called North
Melbourne, now Carlton. He bought
two cows —plenty of run for cattle
then, and the family vended milk
over the town, carrying same on
foot. Price of milk, 6d. a half-pint.
Mr. Cosgrove, sen., eventually got
tired of milk vending, and set off for
the gold diggings, but possibly hav-
ing no luck in finding the precious
ore returned to Melbourne and then
engaged in cattle dealing. Pursuing
such calling, he came up to Bacchus
Marsh about 1854, and bought some
cows from Mr. Richard Taylor, a
settler ; also from station of Mac-
Leod’s, situated on Goodman’s creek.
Through buying from McLeod’s he
made arrangements to find grazers
from Melbourne. McLeod was to
find the grass, Cosgrove, sen., the
cattle and a boy to look after them,
and they were to share proceeds
equally. The young lad Martin thus
appears on the scene; it would be
about ’5 8 or ’59. The district he
has never left. There were no
fences then, the country was all
open; right to Geelong all sheep and
cattle runs, with very few houses.
There were only 4 8 acres then
fenced in between Bacchus Marsh
and Melbourne, belonging to a man
called Croppley, just where Rock-
bank now stands. In the bush there
were great numbers of wild cattle,
and Mr, Cosgrove relates what a
great time was mustering, how the
party engaged used to go to a Shep-
herd’s hut on the Boggy creek, and
wait till the moon rose. One man
would quietly get on his horse, and
ride round the circle of clear coun-


try to see where the cattle were
grazing. He would come back to the
hut again and tell where they were.
Then all saddled up like soldiers, and
made a circle right round these
cattle. They would start the ani-
mals, and off the latter would go,
making for scrub, about 2 0 in a mob.
There was nothing heard but whip-
cracking and yelling, and very likely,
although perhaps eight men were
employed, not more than one or two
out of the 20 would be secured. This
mustering took place for the stations
McLeod’s & Barbour’s, of Bullen-
garook. When Mr. Cosgrove came to
.the Marsh McLeod’s had an import-
ed thoroughbred horse, called Dolo,
which produced a lot of fine race-
horses, amongst them an old gray
horse called Flatcatcher. He ran at
Flemington, winning a big race. His
progeny was all over the district.
■Mr. Con. Mahoney’s noted war horse,
“Old Werribee,” was a product. Mr.
Cosgrove had a mare “Catherine
Hayes,” from this sire, and he won
several races with her. He ran two
dead heats with her at Ballan, be-
ing beaten in the third race by a
half-head by a mare “Alice Gray,”
belonging to Sam Cole, a butcher
at Heidelberg. Mr. Molesworth
Greene was riding in the same race.
He was one of the finest horsemen
(that is a gentleman rider) we had
in Victoria. McLeod in early days
was a racing man in Melbourne. He
came over from Sydney, and selected
station at the Marsh. He had a black
boy called “Black Billy,” a good
jockey. He used to ride McLeod's
horses. Mr. Cosgrove does not think
he ever saw a better horseman than
Mr. McLeod; he had a good seat,
was daring, and could ride anything.
In 1861 McLeod’s left, and Mr. Cos-
grove, sen., rented the property for
n couple of years. The pleura set
in among the cattle, and he lost £4OO
pr £SO 0 in the one year. That was
In ’62. He remained there two
years. Mr. Cosgrove, jun., had a
selection alongside of it, at Good-
man's creek. Afterwards spent 13
years at Yaloak Vale, where he was
c verseer at Mr. T. Brown’s sheep
station, then came back to Good-
man’s creek.
Peter Cosgrove, son of Mr. Martin
Cosgrove, rode his first race at nine
years of age, at Melton. He was
then apprenticed to Mr. Miller a
little while after that for two years.
He was very successful. He won
22 races with a horse called Sladen.
He got uneasy, and thought he
could do better for himself. He left
Miller’s, and was employed by Mr.
McArthur (of Warrnambool). His
first race was at Warrnambool he lost
but won the next six right through,
including two Grand National
Hurdle races, on a horse named Mar-
mont. He has had a lot of tumbles,
but did not receive much injury, save
a collar bone and arm broken.
Mr. Cosgrove is rather diffident
at recounting his own performances,
but I press him. Yes, he had done
a good deal of horse racing. The
first horse he rode was a brunette,
owned by “Billy” Hider ; won two
hurdle races with her the one day
on the Marsh racecourse. After that
he thought himself capable of rid-
ing anything. He won .five hurdle
races at Melton in consecutive years,
and with such a performance Martin
Cosgrove, jockey, felt that he was
in the first flight of horsemen. The
horsey spirit entered into his blood
so much that he would go any dis-
tance for a “bucker,” especially
when he heard he was a bad one.
I expressed the opinion that so much
jockeying and rough riding must
have battered him in a great degree.
Oh, no, he had been particularly
lucky; he had never dislocated his
neck ; indeed had a clear run from
accidents. He had only all his ribs
broken at one time or other, and
also a collarbone. Mr. Martin Cos-
grove has loyal feeling to the Marsh.
He has lived for a lifetime some-
where or other in the district; mar-
ried, and raised up a family here ;
and it is his earnest desire that
what part of life is yet assigned
him may be spent in “good old Bac-
chus Marsh.”
I turn again to Mr. Crisp’s notes.
Charles Ross, Coimadai, was 77
on 2 4th August, 19 01. Born at
Dumbarton. Served his time as a
mechanical engineer with Wingate,
of Whiteinch, near Glasgow. He
worked at Smith & Rogers, ship-
builders, Glasgow. Later was en-
gineer of David Napier, of London,
who built a passenger steamer with


a rotatory engine—the first, and
most successful. Ross was selected
out of 300 mechanics to drive it.
The steamer travelled 22 miles per
hour on the Clyde. After Ross left
to come to Australia, in 1852, the
steamer did not get on well, and it
was sold for river use in Ireland,
but the peat fuel did not suit it, and
the last heard of it was that parti-
ally wrecked it fell into the posses-
sion of salvors. About 1852 Ross
came to Melbourne; worked putting
up imported quartz crushers; was
later on foreman at Wright & Ed-
wards. Superintended most of the
tramway work. Formerly was in
employ of Cornish & Bruce. Erected
turntable on the first section of line
to Bendigo. Was working foreman
on Moorabool and Melton railway
viaducts. Came to Cockatoo gully,
Bacchus Marsh, about 1860. Had
got £3 a day in gold dust there.
Now (time when notes were taken)
owns 100 acres of what he believes
to be the reefs which fed Cockatoo
gully. Ross’s mother lived to age
of 105 years and 9 months. She
was the daughter of Carpenter Swan,
R.N., a native of Hull, Yorkshire,
who made the coffin in which Lord
Nelson’s body was placed after
his death at the battle of Trafalgar.
This may be true, but it is not ac-
cording to traditions of navy, for
Nelson’s body was put in a barrel
of rum, and “tapping the admiral”
refers to the broaching of that bar-
rel by the “tars” on the way home.
I extract from “Express” of late
date : —“Mr. William Bennett, of
Coimadai, hotelkeeper and farmer,
died there on the last day of 1912,
and was buried in Maddingley cem-
etery on the first day of 1913, the
funeral being largely attended. He
was born at Bristol, County of
Gloucester, England, on 15th July,
1820, or ’2l ; we have a record of
both years. He was particular about
County of Gloucester, probably be-
cause Bristol is on the border of
two or more counties. He was a
most genial and shrewd individual-
ity, combining the characters of the
two Weller’s, as depicted by Dick-
ens. Like so many other Victorians,
there was no adequate scope for
his abilities in a village. He built
a large hotel in expectation of tour-
ist trade to Coimadai mineral
springs, which will develop some
day, the water being •of value for
gout and similar affections. Mr.
Bennett was a first class baker by
trade, and master of all the arts of
pastry cook and caterer, in which
capacity he came to Bacchus Marsh
in 1852, under engagement to Mr.
Watt, of Border Inn. He probably
left for Coimadai about 1860, for
the Cockatoo gully rush. He had a
most picturesque bush hotel before
he built the brick one. He knew all
about the Christopherson—Coimadai
reservoir, and just recently sug-
gested by Mr. Nally that he should
be interviewed respecting it. We
forwarded at the time a photograph
of Mr. Wrixon’s survey camp of 5 0
years ago on that scheme. Mr.
Bennett made a bet with Mr. David
Dale Bower affirming that Coimadai
scheme would never be carried om.
Mr. Bower was enthusiastically cer-
tain it would be. He was proprietor
of the limeworks at the time. It is
singular that Mr. Bennett’s death
should be recorded in the same paper
that resurrects the Coimadai scheme,
Mr. Bennett had a large family—six
sons and four daughters. Bennett
street, Bacchus Marsh, was named
by John Barter Bennett, solicitor
Mr. John Lyle, miller, afterwards
in Bacchus Marsh, landed in Mel-
bourne in 1841. It was a sensa-
tional voyage. The barque “India,”
of Greenock, in which he embarked,
was burnt in the South Atlantic, in
July, 1841, in her passage to Port
Phillip, with 180 emigrants on board,
all of whom (except 19, who were
drowned) were saved by the whale
ship “Roland,” of Havre-de-Grace,
Captain le Cozinnet. A framed
sketch of the burning of the barque
is in the possession of Mr. Wm.
Lyle, J.P. It is the work of one of
the cabin passengers, Mr. Allan, who
was afterwards in partnership with
Mr. John Lyle in Kilmore as a
miller. The sketch is in water col-
ours, and very realistic. The pas-
sengers rescued by the whale boat
were taken to Rio Janeiro, and
came on by the “Mary Ann Grim-
ley” to Australia. The whaler was
paid £2l per head for saving pas-
sengers and crew. Mr. Lyle was
under engagement to manage a


flour mill for Allison & Knight,
Melbourne. It stood between Little
Collins street and Collins street,
about on the ground of the present
New Zealand Loan buildings. Mr.
W. Lyle, J.P., was born in the mill,
Little Collins street, and when he
was 12 months old his father re-
moved to Kilmore, where, in part-
nership with his old schoolmate and
ship companion, he built a flour
mill, the, first outside Melbourne.
He remained at Kilmore two years,
ultimately selling out to Allan. Bac-
chus Marsh having good prospects,
from a milling point of view he
came here, and built the mill, which
is still standing in Anderson’s yard,
taking Young, a carpenter, into
partnership. They ran the mill for
two years, but Mr. Lyle, who was
suffering from asthma, purchased the
Werribee farm, and Young bought
his share in the mill.
I ask Mr. W. Lyle what were his
first recollections of Bacchus Marsh.
He said he could remember the
Marsh when there were very few
houses in it. He remembers his
father and a Mr. Quaile and others
going to the old diggings when
they r broke out. Quaile owned the
shop now Edwards’ forge, which
was formerly a butcher’s shop,
owned by John Simpson, father and
grandfather of the present race of
Simpson’s. Quaile was a black-
smith. The first post-office was at
Taubman’s general store. Mr. Lyle,
sen., and party went to Ballarat,
and thence on to Peg-Leg gully,
Eaglehawk. Peg-Leg gully was so
named after an old convict. The
gold was so plentiful that they saw
Peg-Leg picking out the nuggets.
Mr. Lyle did fairly well, but never
made his fortune. In one place the
Party put down a hole, getting a
match box full of gold in the first
dish, but the sudden rush of water
caused them to abandon the claim.
Afterwards two Americans went into
the hole, and using a California
Pump, took out £30,000. Mr. Lyle
Was away about nine months.
“Underbank,” the well-known farm,
Was bought from the original Clarke,
father of first baronet. Clarke had
farms all over the hills and flats.-
ffe was dealing and jobbing in land,
cattle and sheep, thus laying the
foundation of the family fortune.
The next day following the transac-
tion, when he sold the farm to
Mr. Lyle, “Big Clarke’’ (as he was
familiarly called) passed on to Bal-
larat, and purchased Dowling For-
est estate. The original Ballarat
road passed up Lyle’s creek gulcu,
and there were dangerous parts.
Cobb’s coach had six horses. It was
rather a coincidence that on one occa-
sion the coach was capsized con-
taining Mrs. Lyle’s mother. The
coincidence was that afterwards her
daughter was to become the wife of
a member of the “Underbank’’' fam-
ily, with whom she was then un-
acquainted. The coach fare from
Melbourne to Ballarat was five
guineas ; and £3 from Bacchus
Marsh to Melbourne. G-enerally
about a dozen or 14 passengers were
carried. Two coaches ran from Bac-
chus Marsh to the city. Watt, of
the Border Inn, running one, and
Cobb & Co. the other. The opposi-
tion coaches naturally tried to outdo
one another. One driver of Cobb
& Co. was particularly reckless, he
was known as “Hellfire Jack.” On
one occasion he determined to pass
his competitor, and although a deep
gutter barred his progress, he went
across it full gallop. Mr. Lyle well
remembers a bushranging incident.
There was a good deal of horse
stealing in early days. One morn-
ing he saw three horsemen riding
across the flat, and told his father
so, but the latter regarding such as
only an ordinary occurrence, took
no notice of the men. The family
were having breakfast, when two
men came to the door, one carried
a very big whip. They were asked
what they wanted, and one replied
that they wished to buy oats for
their horses. Mr. Lyle, sen., said
that he had no oats, but only bar-
ley, which would be no good for
horses. He could, however, give
them a truss of hay. The two men
were satisfied with this, and handed
a sovereign for payment. They
would take no change, and said
that it should be given to the boy.
They then left. After breakfast,
as Mr. Lyle went to look for cattle
in the forest (for it was open in
those days) he saw a crowd consist-
ing of waggoners mounted on their


draught horses, Sergeant Roberts,
and Tom Low (Mrs. Edwards’
father who kept a hay and corn
store on Ballarat road, where Mr.
Griffin now lives) coming excitedly
along, and they made known that
they were in search of bushrangers,
who had stuck up the waggoners,
and nearly beaten an old man named
Chambers to death, leaving him in-
sensible. The visitors to Mr. Lyle’s
home at the breakfast time were
none other than the desperadoes,
The whole concourse set off in pur-
suit of the gang. They tracked
them by the loose hay. right up to
Mrs. Simon Dixon’s farm, but here
all clue was lost. The hay was
there, but the bushrangers had gone.
The sequel remaining to be told.
The old man, who had been nearly
beaten to death by the very heavy
horsewhip of the bushranger, was
taken to the Ballarat hospital, and
was an inmate for fifteen months,
and when he got out he passed
some prisoners in chains working
on the road. He identified two of
them as his assailants. They were
taken to Melbourne —tried, found
guilty and were hanged. When
they visited “Underbank,” one of
the bushrangers acted in rather an
insolent way, and Mr. Lyle’s mother
cried sharply, “stand back, I am in
a bad humor this morning.” She
never had any idea, of course, of
the men she was speaking to. Prob-
ably why the bushrangers did not
attack the homestead was that there
were a number of men in the hut,
who were employed on the farm.
The three were Tasmanian convicts.
I ask Mr. Lyle to probe his mem-
ory for more bushranging incident.
Yes, there was something, later. The
notorious Saunders and Kelly stuck
up farms along the road, and Har-
vie’s hotel on Keilor road. Every
house they visited they robbed, and
left the inmates tied up. One girl
they treated most cruelly, not only
binding her, but stripped her al-
most naked. Kelly got 15 years,
and Saunders was executed in Mel-
bourne gaol. The two lots of bush-
rangers for years were represented
in the Melbourne waxworks. Read
early life of Tasmania, by Marcus
Clarke, and you will not be sur-
prised at the terrible atrocities
which any Tasmanian convict might
commit.
And in the early days there were
also moving accidents by flood and
field. Mr. James Ennis Murray,
who had built the Royal hotel for
Mrs. Miller, his sister, with others,
were victims of a terrible accident.
Murray, Captain Partridge, and an-
other of same name, but no relative,
left Bacchus Marsh in coach driven
by a Frank Hanna. It had been a
very wet night. The bridge on
other side of Melton was covered
with water, and the decking t had
been washed away. The driver
made a rush to cross, but the coach
toppled over in the current, and
the three passengers were drowned,
the coachman escaping.
Mr. Lyle told me there was much
cattle and horse pilfering in early
days. Mr. Lyle, sen., had a fine
blood mare. It disappeared. Two
years afterwards he saw a man lead-
ing a black horse. On being, asked
where he had got it, he said that
he had bought it at Ballarat, pro-
ducing a receipt. Mr. Lyle went to
the police station, and laid an ac-
cusation. The man was taken in
charge. No J.P. in town at that
time: apparently only large landed
proprietors were so honored. The
nearest J.P. was at Yaloak Vale.
The man was let go, but an order
upon the auctioneer was given him
to get back money for stolen mare.
Mr. W. Lyle, J.P., Interviewed.
I enquire as to products of “Un-
derbank” in early times. Barley
was the staple crop. It did very well.
Mr. Lyle, sen., took first prize for
barley at Ballarat, a gold cup, £5 0,
presented by Dunn, of Warrenheip
distillery. By the way, “Underbank”,
and indeed all Lyle’s creek, right up
to Griffin’s present farm, was all for-
est, great trees of white gum. The
first piece of ground cleared on “Un-
derbank” was about 10 or 12 acres.
John Simpson carted the barley to
Melbourne, which was sold to Aitken,
of Aitken's brewery, at 22/6 a bush-
el. John Lyle used to breed draught
horses, also went in for dairying.
He died at the farm October 6th,
1 880.
Mr. W. Lyle, J.P., for I must dis-
tinguish between father and son,


remembers Grant, of Millbank, com-
ing here to settle, Anderson’s, and
Simpson, from Phillip Island. Mr.
Simpson built a “wattle and dab”
house on same site as Edwards’
house. When diggings broke out
Simpson bought a team of bullocks.
Mrs. Simpson and two children lived
ki house on “Underbank” farm.
Mr. Simpson was getting £lOO per
ton for cartage from Melbourne to
Ballarat, a journey taking a fort-
night or three weeks. In wet wea-
ther a terrible road. Mr. Lyle tells
me that has seen in the Box forest
four Or five teams of bullocks yoked
on to a waggon, and then not suc-
cessful. After rush was over, John
Simpson, butcher by trade, bought
ground where shop to-day stands,
and the first cattle killed were his
team of bullocks. The sign on the
shop reads “Simpson & Co., estab-
lished 1850.” He died in 1890.
Simpson, Field (whose son was
afterwards M.L.A. for Collingwood),
and Charlie Carter were carting into
Melbourne on one occasion when the
usual crossing was not fordable.
Simpson, who was very venturesome
choosing another part of the river,
boldly pushed across, and the others
followed. This meant a new road,
and that is how a Melbourne street
came to be called Simpson’s Road.
He was a most daring horseman;
indeed, Mr. Lyle called him a superb
horseman. He never forgets him
one day at “Underbank” chasing a
steer. The beast galloped down a
precipitous bank, and the horseman,
never abating the speed of his
horse for one moment, careered
down it in pursuit. The steer plun-
ged into a deep water-hole, 8 00 or
9 00 yards across, and so did the
horseman, and only the head of the
horse was to be seen. But the beast
was turned, driven to land, and
safely yarded.
No man looked after his horses
like Mr. Simpson. They came out
of the stable looking like race- ;
horses, clean and groomed.
Mr. Lyle’s recollections go back
to his school days. A brother of
Mrs. Bacchus, one of the Hobbler
family,' taught school in part of the
border Inn, owned and run by Mr,
Watt. At the time there used to be
lot of water about the Marsh. Be-
tween the mill and Border Inn it
was nearly knee deep. At back of
present A.N.A. Hall was a big
swamp, covered with wild-fowl,
which was generally called a lagoon.
Said Mr. Lyle, “I was often carried
to school at the Border Inn on the
back of a black lubra, and returned
by the same means of conveyance.”
After the Lyle family removed to
the farm, it resulted in attendance
at another school, taught by the late
Mrs. Laughton, who lived on a pro-
perty known as “Haley Park,” on
Stamford Hill, lately sold to Mr. B.
O. Love, in wind-up of late Thos.
Cain’s estate. Lyle, junior, went
there for about 12 months; and his
next teacher was Mr. Simon Morri-
son, in Maddingley. Tom. Ander-
son, W. Grant, J. McDonald, Mrs.
W. Grant, Pat. Murphy, the Simp-
son’s, Tom. Pearce, alone remained
of his schoolmates. School was held
in old Betty Cullen’s hut. After
that it was shifted further up Mad-
dingley, to paddock now owned by
Mr. Michael Reynolds. The school-
master lived in a tent in Kennedy’s
gully. A stone school was put up
at back of what is now Connelly’s
hotel. When the school was closed
it was turned into a store, kept by
a Mr. Howden, afterwards in pos-
session of Mr. Alford, who pulled it
down and built front of hotel with
material. Lyle, junior, attended two
schools after this: one was the
Church of England denominational
school; Mr. Goodman, brother of
Canon Goodman, of Geelong, was the
teacher; and the other, which finish-
ed his schooling, was the iron school
near Woolpack, taught by Mr. Milly.
A quiet life at “Underbank” for
many years, and Mr. Lyle removes
to Bacchus Marsh. About 3 0 years
ago he was appointed a Justice of
the Peace. I notice a framed certi-
ficate. Mr. Lyle received the Royal
Humane Society’s bronze medal and
certificate for saving the lives of W,
J. Humphrey and Fred. Penrose.
Llumphrey was a man of 6ft. 2in. in
height, and Penrose a youth of 18.
One Sunday Mr, Lyle relates he
went for a swim at junction of Wer-
ribee and Korkuperrimul creek,
with the two just named. There
had been a very heavy flood, and-
the current at junction of the two


streams had formed a very deep
hole. Fred Penrose’s father was
also one of the party, but he soon
got out of the water and went up
to the house. Humphrey (a “new
chum”) could not swim, and chose
shallow water.- Fred Penrose and
Mr. Lyle, after having had a good
swim, went out to dress. The sec-
ond son of Mr. Lyle was standing
on some stones watching the bath-
ing, and noticed Humphrey, who
must have been overcome with fear,
gradually getting into deeper and
deeper water, and the boy called out
for help. Fred Penrose sprang in,
and swam to Humphrey, but he was
immediately clutched by the drown-
ing man, and both sank. Mr. Lyle
hastily undressing plunged in, and
diving where the two had disap-
peared, grasped the hand of Humph-
rey, and coming to the surface swam
with both to land. When Humph-
rey felt his feet on ground he let
Penrose go. Both Humphrey and
Penrose were at the last stage of ex-
haustion.
Mr. Lyle was reluctant through-
out to communicate. It was ex-
tracted. I ask how came the name
Stamford Hill. He said that Stam-
ford Hill was owned by the late
Rev. W. Higgins, and he cut up a
lot into blocks of 10 acres on one
side of the road, and half-acre on
the other. He called the estate
Stamford Hill, after a place in Eng-
land.
“Hilton Park” Described,
When describing “Morven” and
“Lerderderg Park,” I heard fre-
quently that Mr. James Urquhart’s
“Hilton Park” should not be over-
looked,. that in a district competi-
tion it had taken first place, and the
judge an outside, man. As an ad-
mirer of Mr. Urquhart’s property
remarked, not even a grain of wheat
is out of place. I visit “Hilton
Park,” and if orderliness and clean-
liness count for anything this farm
certainly achieves such results, and
in my wanderings scholastically in
country districts I have never seen
such absolute punctilious observance
of care of those thousand and one
properties that make up a farm.
There is a place for everything, and
everything lias a place. The man-
agement goes down to the slightest
details. I notice that all imple-
ments are housed. A typical
“cocky”—l don’t use the term of-
fensively—believes that all his
agencies of cultivation should have
plenty of fresh air, and a blistering
sun is somehow regarded as adding
to the life of a harvester. Again I
say that it is in little things that
good management appears. Mr.
Urquhart has his hay drays in a
shed, but above them is suspended
the frame, so that when suen is
needed, there is no unnecessary
waste of perspiration in depositing
it in its proper lodging place. The
floor of the stables is built high,
and allows for drainage. The har-
ness is daily oiled and hung, not
covered with two inches of dust in
the chaff shed, and the breeching
missing. All the sheds are covered
with corrugated iron, and tanks
provided, so that when there is any
fall of rain it is conserved. Mr.
Urquhart has, in consequence, not
to spend days in carting water with
a 4 00-gallon tank. Mr. Urquhart
conducts his farm on a system, and
he has been a tiller of the soil all
his life. I have come to the con-
clusion that farming is as much a
science as to practically apply say
electricity. Mr. Urquhart made a
very pregnant remark. He said that
after he had ploughed a field to the
best of his ability he walks around
the fences to see that they are se-
cure, and he then is contented that
having done what mortal can do, he
may leave the rest to conditions of
weather, which is beyond human
control. I notice that the cultivated
paddocks are tilled as perfectly as
if they were extensive bowling
greens. You see no clods; all the
soil is turned- up to the nicest con-
sistency, and the blades of corn were
peeping through with the most
methodical regularity. I ask how
he obtained such evenness of culti-
vation. I am directed to a spiked
roller, which must have cost a tidy
sum, and Mr. Urquhart holds that
the increased results justify its use.
It is an old truism that the cheapest
thing is often the dearest, but a
dear thing may be very cheap in the
end. In ploughing, Mr. Urquhart’s
motto is, ‘whatever you do, do well.’


He has good horses, with plenty of
heart on the foundation of good
hard feed, ploughs in excellent or-
der, ploughman well looked after,
and the result, that bowling green
clothing the sides of those hills.
The perspect from the farm is de-
lightful. The Marsh lies at your
feet; away to the south is Lyle’s
Creek, a deep green showing won-
derful strength of growth as the
creek approaches the Werribee, and
to the north Bald Hill, with its vol-
canic soil. I have come to one con-
clusion, that Bacchus Marsh does
not know its possibilities. Just
recently I visited “The Highlands,’’
the property of Mr. W. P. Robert-
son, 800 acres of splendid land; in-
deed a valuable property. Those
fairly steep Ascents make communi-
cation not too convenient, but some
day aeroplanes are to be common,
and could there be a more ideal
place from whence to start our air
ship than those heights? A pano-
rama stretches out before us, and
beyond with the naked eye, under
favorable atmospheric conditions,
you can see steamers passing up and
down the bay, while you can trace
the train stopping at the various
stations, Parwan, Melton and so on,
till the cessation of smoke indicates
that it has at last disappeared in
Melbourne.
In Bacchus Marsh Farm Compe-
tition of 1909 Mr. James Urquhart
gained first place. The judge was
Mr. A. V. Belcher, Dairy Supervisor.
The farms judged, in addition to
“Hilton Park,’’ were those of- Messrs.
James Lidgett, Myrniong ; James
Kerr, Bacchus Marsh ; Thos. Myers,
Myrniong; O. Burgess, of Staughton
Vale;' D. Robertson, Myrniong ; H,
Lidgett, Myrniong: Mrs. Scott, Par-
Wan ; and Robert Dickson, Green-
side. The points gained were as
follows—l 74, 166, 163, 151, 148,
13 4, 123, 111, and 102. It w’as only
on the solicitation of Messrs. Hy.
O’Ha gan and J. A. Johns that Mr.
Urquhart entered his farm, and no
one he states was more surprised
than himself that he had scored the
highest marks. The soil of “Hil-
ton Park’’ varies: in reality three
kinds, red clay, clay loam, and lime
s tone deposit. Wheat sometimes
grown, sometimes oatte. Mr. Urqur-
hart had tried rape, but though
partially successful a very dry sea-
son put on the finishing touch. Rape
needs not only a moisture, but a suit-
able season, and the prevalence of
frosts in the Marsh would be against
the growth of this fodder. The high
country will grow lucerne, but the
necessity of irrigation is evident. Mr.
Urquhart compared sandy with
clayey soil. In the former the growth
is more rapid, but crop cannot stand
the drought. The clayey land pro-
duces a more payable, and a greener
crop, while the sandy, just as you
have it on the Melton plains, looks
well for a time, but the approach of
dry weather soon causes it to shrivel
up. Mr. Urquhart stated that he
had been following the plough all
his life time, and took great inter-
est in cultivation. In regard to root
crops, these wanted a real good
black soil, and in his opinion Lyle’s
flat was superior to that of the Marsh,
certainly better than the higher
ground he occupied. There was too
much seepage on the Marsh flats ;
the soil was too silty, and another
carrying only half the water would
utilize it better. It was a wonder to
Mr. Urquhart that there were not
more diseases on the Marsh, seeing
that there was no proper drainage.
I did not stop my friend Mr. Urqu-
hart to put a query to him, but it
does appear to me that if the water
so freely percolates through the soil
as he says, there is a natural drain-
age that prevents the conserving of
stagnant water.
Mr. Urquhart compared the growth
of the higher country around the
Marsh with Pentland Hills, to the
disadvantage of the latter. The Pent-
land Hills grew produce, but it was
too soft, lacked weight, and did not
make the finest chaff. There was
not enough substance or sweetness
in the straw. Melton had a higher
name in Melbourne for the simple
reason that it grew a harder straw.
The producer, Mr. Urquhart con-
tended, should not only look for
quantity, but also for quality. The
more gravelly, the more volcanic the
land, the sweeter would be the
growth. Much of the higher ground
around the Marsh conforms to these
conditions, and hence the strength
and heart of stock. Mr. Urquhart


chats away. Successful farming in
his opinion only comes down to one
thing, and that whatever is done
should be done well. Plough the
soil well, and give all the chance you
can. All lumps should be broken
down and seed carefully sown. Hust-
ling is no gocd. Mr. Urquhart
strongly beiie\es in a subsoiling
plough. He read of the improved
results by subsoiling. You want to
disturb the surface under the orig-
inal ploughing. Mr. Urquhart’s
plan is to go a little deeper every
year. If you are always ploughing
same depth it is like standing on
the same hard surface ; the plough
runs on the same bottom, and soil
gets adamant, and roots of plant
cannot pass through. Plenty of
good horse flesh, keep plough in
perfect order, deep furrow, and
these are the conditions I am told
must result in a heavy return. Mr.
Urquhart says that out of an ordin-
ary plough one for sub-soiling could
be easily made. Take off mould-
board, also part of wing of plough
share, and the deed is done. More
practical information is given which
gets beyond the scribe’s depth, or
rather familiarity with the subject.
Mr. Urquhart is every time against
that “slap-dash” way of getting in
two or three hundred acres of crop.
He is quite sure that if it produces
quantity, it will not quality. Disc
ploughs are also condemned by Mr.
Urquhart. It is a pity he says that
ever they were put into the field.
Naturally any maiden land on the
first ploughing must give a crop,
but with a disc plough the next
year’s crop is not so good, and the
third year you are ploughing your-
self out. They throw over in a
rough state like a saucer, cutting on
a slant. A shovel, Mr. Urquhart
says, will soon reveal the poorness
of the ploughing. The old style of
ploughing was to have a square
bottom. Subsoiling will undoubtedly
do away with the disc plough.
Twenty-five years ago Mr. Urqu-
hart’s father came from Braybrook,
and settled in the Marsh. He had
been manager of a station at Ander-
son’s, Deer Park, now belonging to
Mr. F. L. Pairbairn. Eventually he
bought present property from Mr.
Alex. Murray, part of it belonging
to Mr. Paul Johnson. Mr. Urqu-
hart’s father died 18 years ago. The
proprietor of “Hilton Park” does not
confine ail his attention to tilling.
He is a good judge of a beast, and
he does much, cattle dealing, and if
rumor be true is most successful.
He attends local, Ballarat, and Mel-
bourne district markets. Mr. Urqu-
hart can recall when in Bacchus
Marsh district a hardy kind of light
horse was reared, but the present
generation seemed to have lost that
interest in the breeding of a good
animal. Dugdale family, Shanahan,
and others being excepted. With
milk such an excellent output, one
would expect “Hilton Park” to be
given also to dairying ; and I have
to say that never did I see more per-
fect milking yards. It is not too
much to say that the bails are abso-
lutely spotless, and all the numerous
appointments, feed mangers, &c., are
neatly and cleverly contrived. I
have just one opinion, after a close
survey of his premises, that Mr.
Urquhart is a born manager.
Mr. W. Bissell Interviewed.
It is only right and proper that
Staughton Vale should not be neg-
lected in our retrospect. Mr. K. L.
Simon, on a recent Sunday landed
me at the residence of Mr. W. Bis-
sell, who has lived in Staughton
Vale district for the last 4 3 years,
and nothing has transpired locally
with which he is not conversant.
Mr. Bissell runs over his career, how
4 3 years ago he came a beardless
boy to the Staughton Vale station.
He is only another example that it
is not absolutely essential for suc-
cess that one should be born with a
silver spoon in the mouth. Mr.
Bissell has a snug property, over
150 acres in all. The family is
united ; sons who still frequent their
home; and our party—five passen-
gers in f he car—sit down to a din-
ner which is served up by Mrs.
Bissell and daughters in fine style,
and afternoon tea comprises a var-
iety of dainty viands. The farm is
nicely situated right at the foot of
the Brisbane ranges. A few hundred
yards behind the house we ascend a
spur covered with vegetation, and
the view obtained therefrom is splen-
did. There stretches the flat down


below us. The original estate of Mr.
S. Staughton was something over
16,000 acres. What glorious legis-
lation that such productive area
should not be in the exclusive pos-
session of one, but should be con-
verted into a hotbed of Industrial
activity for tiie many. The pros-
pect extends away yonder to a pur-
ple expanse of water, which we are
told is Corio Bay, and evidence is
forthcoming that it is so for we can
easily detect the extensive buildings
close to the foreshore of the Church
of England Grammar School, now in
course of erection. On the left rise
the You Yangs, on the right the
“Three Sisters,” of which Mount
Anakie is most important.
The beardless noy 4 3 years ago
came to work at a sugar factory,
just below the homestead of Mr.
Staughton.- The beet was grown on
the flat. But two years saw the col-
lapse of the industry, and the cause
was alleged to be bad management.
It was successful for a time, for tons
upon tons of sugar were produced,
and also a great quantity of spirits
was made at the distillery. Mr. S.
Staughton in the early days took up
Staughton Vale, Eynesbury, Exford,
Brooklyn. He was one of the early
squatters of the State, a monopoly
Avhich Graham Berry was aferwards
to disturb. “Dummyism” was a
familiar term in those days, and the
“Age” gained great notoriety and
public support that it did expose a
great obstacle to the country's pro-
gress. The original name of the es-
tate at Staughton Vale was the Bris-
bane station. It got the name of
the Staughton Vale station at the
time of the sugar factory. When
Mr. Staughton died at Brisbane sta-
tion he divided his estate among
his sons. Brooklyn was left to Mr.
Steve Staughton, Exford to Mr. H.
Staughton ; Eynesbury to Mr. Sam-
uel Staughton, who afterwards re-
presented the district in Parliament;
and the Brisbane station to Mr, Fred
Staughton. Mr. Fred Staughton only
worked 2,000 acres of the Brisbane
station ; the rest was leased to Mr,
Frank Armytage, who had married a
sister of Mr Staughton, afterwards
iu succession to Rugg & McArthur,
C. B. Fisher, Joe Kiddle and finally
reverted back to the son, Mr. S. S.
Staughton. Mr. Simon Staughton’s
main home was Exford ; he included
in the run a great part of Brisbane
ranges, fencing with top rail and
■wire, and some of the posts among
the ravines remain to this day. 1
ask Mr. Bissell of what valv*e were
the ranges from a grazing point of
view. I am told that despite the
roughness of the country, and the
abundance of timber, grass in earlier
times in the gullies was plentiful,
and he, Mr. Bissell, had seen fat
cattle come out of the ranges fit for
market. The rabbit to-day is the
cause of the disappearance of the
grass. Mr. Simon Staughton never
had less than 16 to 17,000 sheep.
When station was in full swing
never less than a sheep to the acre
was shorn at the sheds, and besides
there were a good many head of
cattle, not to speak of a fair number
of horses in the paddocks. Mr. Bis-
sell says that 40 years ago farmers
were paying Mr. Fred Staughton £1
per acre as rent. Even paying that
rent, the return was such that there
was no reason to grumble. . Wages
too were satisfactory. The beardless
boy, working at the factory, got
6/6 per day. Staughton Vale to-day
is honored by being apportioned be-
tween three Shires. The Ballan
Shire coming across the ranges in-
cludes Mr. Bissells’ property as a
corner, and the Shire of Meredith,
and that of Bacchus Marsh, take np
the remainder, the latter the greater
portion. Formerly what is now
within the Bacchus Marsh Shire was
part of Corio Shire, but there was
great dissatisfaction with the Corio
Shire that fair treatment was not
being meted out. Corio was the
richer Shire, but on this side of the
river there was no representative,
and the change was made on the in-
itiative of the concerned producers.
Mt. Anakie stands out most prom-
inently, and I learn that it is a
reserve which Is in the power of the
Council of Meredith to let. Over the
saddle in front of Mt. Anakie I am
informed goes the watercourse from
Stony Creek, 12 miles back, which
is part of the water supply of Gee-
long. ' The reservoir away back in
the ranges is said to be very pic-
turesque, and is worth a visit. Mr.
S. Staughton sold portion of his


Staughton Yale property for closer
settlement to the Government, and
other sales were to Messrs. Locke &
Lennon, 3.700 acres; 2,500 acres of
Granites to Mr. W, Brown, of An-
akie, 2 80 acres to Mr. Alex Ford, of
Balliang ; and 32 0 acres to Mr.
Reither ; and the balance to Mr. A.
Whinfield, who recently disposed of
his estate to Mr. Edols. Six years
last January the Staughton Vale
Closer Settlement estate, purchased
by the Government, having been
parcelled out by surveyors, was duly
apportioned. Applications were
made before the Board in Melbourne,
and farms duly allotted. The ap-
plicant who could give proof that he
had the best means of getting on,
was generally successful. The es-
tate consists of 5 0 blocks, on an av-
erage containing 200 acres. There
is a general appearance of prosper-
ity. Messrs. Fry, Phalp, Coe, Beggs,
Ford, Burgess, Bird, Yanstan, the
Redden’s, Loates, Davies, Heinrich,
Ward, and others, have erected sub-
stantial buildings on their holdings,
Thus do we have a graphic example
of the advantage that is gained from
a national point of view, when the
land is made to produce of its good-
ness. Under the control of one
landlord, at best, from 6 to 12 men
were only employed, now there are
over 3 0 families settled on the flat,
and some of these employ labor.
Cereal crops and hay are plentifully
produced. It is regrettable that the
season so far has not been propi-
tious. There are at present droughty
indications, but with such adverse
climatic conditions, the crops in pad-
docks that approach the hills are by
no means of a despairing character.
There must be some seepage from
the hills. The rain hangs closely to
the ranges. At Burgess’ the record of
rainfall is half-inch lower than in the
vicinity of the higher country, just
3J miles distant. Settlement means
the facilities of education, and there
are two schools on the estate, and
one has an average of about 50 chil-
dren. Rowsley, of course, is the
railway station that is the most con-
venient, and Melbourne is the. mar-
ket. Three-fourths of “living” trade
goes to Bacchus Marsh. Geelong is
2 5 miles, as against 12 to the Marsh.
The new proprietor of the Staughton
Yale homestead is evidently very
enterprising. He Intends to put at
least 500 acres under lucerne. A
paddock of 40 acres had been for
the last 16 years a fine' lucerne
patch, being always a picture to
look at. The soil should lend itself
to the cultivation of the great fod-
der, for there is a depth of 12 feet
of the black loamy soil. There is
no possibility for conservation of
water for irrigation purposes, but
water by sinking is to be found all
over the flat. Mr. Bissell has never
known a hole to go down deeper
than 30 feet for inflow of water.
Mr. Staughton put a windmill over
a hole which had been sunk for
gold, and he was able to fill a dam
which supplied the house. Mr. Bis-
sell, in a gully just behind his house,
sank a shaft 40 feet. The water
rose 14 feet in 12 hours. T ask if
it was brackish, but am told that it
was beautifully clear, the flow being
too heavy for the water to become
brackish.
Mr. Bissell, if he has great failh
in the productivity of Staughton
Vale, has even greater in those hills
as containing deposits of golden ore,
He has done a good deal of pros-
pecting on his own, and is satisfied
that if only operations were carried
on in a proper way there would be
good yields. We are taken to where
there has been some delving done
into the side of the hill, and at the
home we were shown a small bottle
containing pure gold specimens §oz.
from half a bag of dirt. As Mr.
Bissell was cutting down a tree to
split rails, a piece of stone attracted
his attention. He dollied it, and
found some nice colors. Afterwards
he loamed up the side of the hill,'
opened a trench, and struck on an
outcrop of reef, A syndicate was
formed by six local people —Messrs,
Staughton, Gavin, Smith, Peter
Patterson, and Bissell. An exper-
ienced hand was employed to assist
Mr. Bissell. A tunnel was driven
in 210 feet, and a narrow reef was
cut; it did not prove to be gold
bearing. A trench was opened on
top of the hill, and 13 tons were
taken out and crushed for H-oz 18-
dwt. of gold. Then lease was put
into the market to sell it. Minins
experts inspected, but owing to dif-


ferences among the syndicate (which
Mr. Blssell detailed the whole affair)
fizzled out. The tunnel is there
right enough, as we examined it. It
is five years since the lease was for-
feited, but Mr. Bissell’s faith in the
hills as a valuable auriferous area
has not diminished. The tunnel, un-
fortunately, was all dead work. On
an adjoining hill a party from Ber-
emboke had done some work, but it
was fruitless. McPhail’s reef is 1J
miles due north. Some of the stone
from this claim gave a result of 8-oz.
to the ton. McPhail put five men
to work on tribute. They took 364-
oz. within three months ; then put
their pegs in and jumped claim.
McPhail brought the case before the
Warden’s Court but lost the day. The
Inspector of Mines was sent down
from Ballarat to inspect the mine,
and he condemned the whole of the
workings. A bush fire came later,
and burning all the timber, the
mouth of the shaft fell in, and the
mine has been lying idle ever since.
Per favor of Mr. J. McMahon, a
native of Staughton Yale, and Mr,
F. Lee, I gain possession of certain
interesting statistics. During the
years 1889-90-91, hay, 60 tons ;
sheep, 16,000 ; say 2,000 lambs ;
wool, 40 tons ; cattle, 300 ; horses,
20 ; beef and mutton, £1,200 ; per-
manent hands employed, about 7,
with extra at shearing time ; machin-
ery and rolling stock, £SOO.
Note the transformation. To-day
—-grain, 5 6,000 bags ; hay, 2,000
tons ; straw, 1,800 tons ; sheep,
5,000 ; cattle, 300 ; horses, 400 ;
machinery and rolling stock,
£IB,OOO ; population, 290. This is
an average for last three years.
Past —Hay, £l2O ; lambs, £I,OOO ;
wool, £2,240 ; cattle, £1,200; total,
£4,560.
Present —■ Grain, £2 8,000 ; hay
£4,000 ; straw, £I,BOO ; sheep profit,
£I,OOO ; lambs, £2 50; cattle, £1.000;
total, £36,050. The district also car-
ries, £IB,OOO worth of plant as
against some £SOO.
Early “Express” Files Perused.
I have before me the first copy
of “The Bacchus Marsh Express.”
The “Express” has not the honor of
being the pioneer of journalism in
the Marsh, for a paper called “The
West Bourke Guardian” was estab-
lished in 1865, and the first issue of
“Express” was on 7th July, 1866.
The origin of the West Bourke
“Guardian” was traceable to the
1865 Land Act, which allowed the
selection of land in 20 acre blocks,
but all applications had to be ad-
vertised locally. An enterprising
Mr. James Walter Swords saw an
excellent opportunity of doing well.
He started the “Guardian,” and ran
it with the assistance of his sons.
It lived three years, and the pro-
prietor found the venture profitable,
particularly while he held a monop-
oly, for the charge of said applica-
tions was 12/6 per advertisement.
The “Guardian” was of humble pro-
portions. Mr. James Walter Swords,
editor of “Guardian” did not exer-
cise business tact, for in regard to
the comfort of a certain prominent
local magnate he was a two-edged
sword, and an opposition paper
conies into existence. The “Express,”
established by a local syndicate,
consisting of Dr. Rae, Rev. James
Scott, and Messrs. John Saunders,
William Watson, George Lane, Jas.
Elijah Crook, and James Young.
Dr. Rae did the first editing. Mr.
Lane had had a small printing press
on the Marsh before 1865, being the
first printer here. The syndicate
came to an end in three months,
having exhausted its resources, and
the paper was ultimately taken over
by Mr. Lane and Mr. Christopher
Crisp. Mr. Crisp assumed editor-
ship, and has conducted the journal
ever since. He was born on 20th
May, 184 4, at Prospect Place, Is-
lington, a suburb of London. At
a very early age he went into The
Queen’s Printing Office, Eyre &
Spottiswoode, Great New Street,
London. He was employed as a read-
ing boy. His hours were from 8
a.m. to 8 p.m., and a walk of three
miles to and from work had to be
undertaken. His father, Hiram Crisp,
was a Freeman of the City of Lon-
don, and died in 184 8. His parent
elects to go to Australia and left
England on 26th November, 1856,
per ship Herald of the Morning
with her two sons and two daugh-
ters. Arrived in Hobson’s Bay on
Ist March, 1857. Mr. Crisp was ap-
prenticed to Francis Burdett Frank-


lyn, of the “Herald” Mel-
bourne, for five years, and when
term is finished is employed by
Mason & Firth on Australian re-
print of Baxter’s “Napoleon 111.,
Destined Monarch of the World.”
It was at this juncture that Mr.
Lane, of the “Express” (one num-
ber having- been published) sought
extra help in Melbourne, and Mr,
Christopher Crisp was recommended
as a suitable journeyman printer.
In short time he becomes editor,
and commences that life of journal-
istic activity which would take up
much space to adequately outline.
I have been permitted to see many
records bearing high testimony b>
leaders in the political world of the
calue of Mr, Crisp’s contributions
on questions of deep moment in pub-
lic affairs. The testimony is
very flattering indeed, and must be
satisfactory to Mr. Crisp that his
life has been one of such useful-
ness.
I purpose now to glance over the
file, 1866-6 7, and make extracts
which I trust the readers of the
“Express” will not deem unworthy
of perusal. Crime evidently runs
through the ages. It has been from
the beginning. Mr. Staughton, of
Exford, reported at police station
that a boy whom he had recently en-
gaged for the station had absconded,
taking with him a concertina, and
one shilling cash. Probably pianos
were not numerous in the sixties,
and the comparative importance of
concertinas. Agricultural item —In
some parts of the district the crops
are suffering from the ravages of
magpies, who go about in vast num-
bers and pull up blades as soon as
they appear above the ground; they
then pluck off the grain and eat it.
Ex-constable Keefe, of Racecourse
hill, may have memory of following.
He said in our interview with him
that he had a good many more inci-
dents to tell when it suited him. An
assault of a very serious nature was
committeed on a man named Phillip
Connelly, working at the cutting on
the main road, Pentland Hills. Con-
nelly, it appears, had asked a fellow
workman to hand him a drink of
water, when another man
named Michael Shea made an offen-
sive remark about his (Connelly’s)
“crawling” propensities. Connelly
made some reply, when Shea, with-
out any further provocation felled
him to the ground by dealing him a
murderous blow over the head with
his spade. The workmen close by
were so much taken by surprise that
they had not presence of mind to se-
cure Shea, who at once ran off across
the fields. Connelly was picked up
insensible, and bleeding from nose
and ears. He was removed to his
home, Pyke’s Creek, and examined
by Dr. Rae, who saw him shortly af-
terwards. Fears at first were enter-
tained for the man’s life, but he has
since rallied considerably, and we be-
lieve there is fair chance of his re-
covery. Shea was cleverly captured
the same evening by Mounted Con-
stables Quinn and Keefe, who having-
heard that he was at the lower end
of the Marsh, making preparations
for a bolt, set out in quest of him
in plain clothes. They had informa-
tion that he had provided himself
with firearms, and as he was known
to be rather a desperate character,
they took precautions to ensure his
capture. Keefe made a circuit so
as to get in his rear, while Quinn
proceeded along the main road to
his lair. He discovered Shea on the
watch in the scrub on the brow of
the hill, and as he left the road to
approach him Shea took to his heels,
but soon found himself face to face
with Keefe, revolver in hand, to
whom he at once surrendered. Sen-
tence, six months with hard labor.
The police authorities granted to
Constables Keefe and Quinn a re-
ward of £2 each. Death of an abo-
rigine.—An aborigine, known by the
name of “Old Mary,” but whose
native name was Me Memiuny, died
at her mia-mia, in Mr. Young’s pad-
dock, on Thursday morning, Aug.
2 6th. “Old Mary” was the wife or
lubra of “Old Jonathan” the
former a remnant of the Carnghan
tribe ; the latter claims kindred
with the Bunninyong tribe. “Old
Jonathan” is from appearance at
least 80 years of age, and his lubra
looks older than that. The two
frail old creatures have been “quam-
bying” in Mr. Young’s paddock for
about three months. Mr. Young is
one of the Honorary Correspondents
to the Central Board for the Pro


tection of Aborigines, and he has
paid great attention to the wants
and comforts of the old people. “Old
Mary” was buried in the Madding-
ley cemetery. “Old Jonathan” her
husband, Jacky Smith, her grand-
son, chief mourners ; Mr. Young and
Mr. A. Forsyth formed part of the
funeral cortege. “Old Jonathan”
and Jacky Smith will leave the
Marsh in a few days for Corndarrek,
where the Inspector of Aborigines,
Mr. Green, has been successful in
establishing a station for training
and educating the blacks to useful
and industrious habits.
Great trouble in control of Bac-
chus Marsh Central Common School
over appointment of Head Teacher.
Committee evidently consisted of two
strong factions, Church of England
versus Presbyterian, with two out-
side as independents. Mr. Thos.
Pearce representing Baptist church,
and Mr. Dyer, a resident and lawyer,
the Catholic church. Committee and
public meetings were held, and dis-
cussion was very acrimonious. The
Church of England arid Presbyterian
pastors evidently did not try to pour
oil on the troubled waters. There
was one very large meeting of par-
ents at the Mechanics’ Hall, and
proceedings were not brought to a
close till half-past eleven o’clock.
The report takes up columns. Evi-
dently platform speakers abounded
those days .in the Marsh, and I have
to say that the correspondence on
the subject was of a very high liter-
ary standard, Latin quotations being
as thick as the leaves that fall at
Yallambrosa. The speaker was evi-
dently received with much disap-
probation, for he prefaced his re-
marks by saying “You may hiss
away, gentlemen ; I can stand it.”
The “Express” thus homilies in a
later issue : —“lt is very much to be
regretted that for some time past
the meetings of this Committee have
been characterized by a painful
amount.of excitement and harsh lan-
guage. The gentlemen who have
been most prominent in the business
which has recently occupied the at-
tention of the public are deservedly
respected in public as well as priv-
ate life, and it is a pity that such
unseemly ebullitions of temper
should occur to interrupt the har-
mony that is wont to exist between
them. We sincerely hope for the
credit of the school, and for the re-
putation of the Committee we have
witnessed the last of these unpleas-
ant meetings.” Evidently the repri-
mand by the “Express” did not
avail much, for subsequent meetings
of Committee were marked by much
wrangling, and Mr. Con Mahoney ul-
timately announced his intention of
resigning, as the Committee only
existed for the perpetuation of sec-
tarian strife, and both sides ad-
mitted that such was the case.
Minutes of successive meetings only
reveal how intense was this denom-
inational aspersity. At length In-
spector Budd, of the Education De-
partment, visits to devise some means
of restoring harmony, and resolutions
were carried at public meeting,
which led Mr. Budd to refuse to be-
lieve that the Committee would not
act harmoniously in the future. So
far as I have searched the file har-
mony must have prevailed after-
wards, for I find no further records
of Common School Committee invec-
tive.
Inception of Irrigation. What ir-
rigation would do for lands in Bac-
chus Marsh and neighbourhood has
been ascertained by paying a visit
to the farm of Merrimu, the property
of Mr. McDonald. Thus discourses
a September issue of “Express,”
186 6. In a paddock of 34 acres may
be seen (not only grazing but up
to their knees in clover) 228 sheep,
51 head of cattle, and 5 horses, or
about equal to twenty sheep to the
acre —-an astonishing number, but we
believe with irrigation from 10 to
18 sheep could be grazed on the
lands in the neighbourhood of the
Marsh all the year round. If the
present moist weater continues Mr.
McDonald says he will require to
put more stock on his land, or the
grass will be ahead of the stock
pasturing on the field. Surely it is
time the farmers and others were
taking steps to have the long-talked-
of scheme of irrigation carried out
either with or without Government
aid. Such vegetation, extraordinary
to say, followed an August which
is noted elsewhere was marked by
prevalence of hot winds, and pro-
ducers were despondent on every


hand. That was August of 1866,
but a welcome change came in Sep-
tember, and there was continuous
downpour, with result that verdure
was knee-deep. Says the paper, a
very fine specimen of rye was
brought to the office (Sept.) taken
from the fields of Mr. Thos. Cain.
It is about four feet in height, and
many of the heads are already well
formed. If the weather prove as
favorable as it hitherto has done,
Mr. Cain cannot fail to reap a large
crop. He is one of our most per-
severing and industrious farmers,
and we trust that his perseverance
will meet with a fitting reward,
Sign of progress—a branch of a
most useful institution, the Post-
office Savings Bank, was opened by
Mr. Taubman, posmaster in Bac-
chus Marsh. There is also a note
on the discovery of a quartz reef
near Bacchus Marsh, precise locality
not stated. An expert had visited
and described reef as well defined
and extremely good looking, one
having every indication of gold
bearing. The width of the portion
open was about six feet ; the gold
in the specimens obtained was prin-
cipally got from the casing, com-
posed of cement. Gold was also
found in the body of quartz, and the
reef could be traced for a consider-
able distance. The “Express” la-
ments that the Marsh is fated to be
the arena of personal discussion,
Scarcely a meeting of any descrip-
tion can be held without a display
of temper, and an interchange of
personalities between some of the
members, so that the meetings often
remind one more of an assemblage of
quarrelsome school boys than; of
sober', experienced, thinking men.
The “Express” heartily coincides
with the sentiment expressed by Mr.
T. Grant that all personal antipa-
thies or illfeeling should be left
outside the walls of the building
wherein men meet for the transac-
tion of public business. I notice
this peculiarity of hard hitting that
obtained generally among the fath-
ers of the hamlet in the sixties. For
example, there is a letter from a
Mr. David Mairs, of Pentland Hills,
and he goes straight for the rival
paper, “The Guardian.” The first
paragraph reads —-“Sir, I see that 1
the ‘pet paper’ has been snarling at
me. It is a vicious cur, but it has
got no teeth. Like all poodles, it
licks its lips, and wags its tail at
the feet of the Council tables, and
when it gets a bone into its kennel
it snarls, and cries bow wow !” It
would be just interesting to know
how Mr. Swords, editor of “Guard-
ian” drew his sword on this momen-
tous occasion. Did he spit Mr.
David Mairs, as the French soldier
served recently the German Guards
drummer ? But in those early times
all was not bitter personality. It
is related that Mr. Dyer asked a
witness in the local Petty Sessions
Court if he were not “hailed” by
two men when he was half-way up
Anthony’s cutting. The witness re-
plied with great simplicity that he
had not drunk very much, as he and
the others had only about a pint of
“hale” each when in the Marsh.
Evidently the mining prospects
above alluded to were not of a sub-
stantial character, for the right,
title and interest in the property
were advertised to be sold.
I am much impressed with the
work of the special correspondent of
the “Express” at Ballan. Here is
a fine piece of philosophy—“ What
religion is to the soul of man so
are politics to the body of man.
Religion saves the soul from the
pains and penalties of the world to
come; polities save the body from
the tyranny and misrule of this.
Religion teaches men how to live,
and how to die; politics teach men
how to act and how to govern. The
former is a doctrine whose princi-
ples regulate the vast and vital in-
terests of the spiritual world; whilst
the latter is a science whose prin-
ciples govern the mighty compli-
cated business of material life. Re-
ligion and politics are twin-born,
they go hand in hand. We can no
more separate them than we can the
Siamese twins. What is life to one
is life to both. Destroy religion
and the immortal empire of the soul
is lost. Destroy politics and the
grand old temple of freedom will
fall, and bury beneath its ruins the
triumphs of a thousands years in
art, science, and in literature.”
Throughout the early issues of the
“Express” there are numerous ex-


amples of such strong thinking, and
equally strong expression, and the
question may well be asked —Has
the character of journalism since de-
clined? Mr. James Young must
have been a very capable man. The
full text of a lecture delivered by
him on Irrigation, taking up six
closely printed columns, is given in
“Express” of Sept. 29, 1866. Ad-
mission was by ticket, and proceeds
were devoted to the funds of the
Melbourne Hospital. Dr. Rae,
J.P., occupied the chair. The
lecture was published in pamphlet
form. I deduce from lecture that
Mr. James at the lower end of the
Marsh was the only one that had
consistently applied water for irri-
gative purposes.
The Committee of the Presbyter-
ian church are enterprising. They
hold a Stock Bazaar, and consider-
able donations of stock are made by
the farmers and other residents in
the neighborhood. The proceeds
are to be devoted to clearing the
debt off the new church. £7O was
result. The notorious Lepp, alias
Stanley, who lately swindled Mr.
Tanner, of the Courthouse hotel, out
of a horse and some money, has at
last been overtaken by justice. He
was brought before the magistrates
on Thursday last, and on pleading
guilty was sentenced to twelve
months’ imprisonment, with hard
labor. We understand that Lepp,
after leaving the Marsh, victimised
Mr. Shebler, of Melton, to a small
extent.
On October sth, 6th, and 7th,
Bacchus Marsh was visited by a
storm of wind and rain, unequalled
in severity since the great gale of
Dec., 1863. I condense. A heavy
flood came down the Werribee for
three days. It rose above the bank
at Mr. Simpson’s paddock at the
lower end of the township in a
stream considerably larger than is
usually to be found in the bed of
the river itself. The overflow took
a bend to the left, ran round Mr.
W. B. James’ house, and into Mr.
Mahoney’s culvert down which it
Poured in a miniature Niagara. The
Lerderderg was also in flood, and
destruction followed. Ryan’s ford,
°n water subsiding, was rendered
Quite impa' sable by a deposit of
silt on either bank from five to six
feet in depth. The iron school and
Mr. James’ house were insulated.
The coach had a narrow escape from
being overturned, but a fatal acci-
dent occurred at Melton, resulting
in death of a man named Kenneth
Mills.
A novel feat was attempted to be
performed under novel circum-
stances on the evening of Novem-
ber Ist, 186 6, opposite the office of
the “Express,” Mr. Bennett, of the
limekilns, undertook to pick up
singly and place in a bucket at the
starting point, 100 stones, placed
one yard apart, in 45 minutes. The
backer of time staked £2 against Mr.
Bennett’s £l. As the night was
dark a profusion of candles had to
be provided to enable the feat to be
attempted; and the" extraordinary
appearance given to the locality was
very remarkable, and attracted a
number of spectators. Mr. Bennett
commenced his task about nine
o’clock, and persevered with it in
true professional style until time
was called, when it was found that
82 stones had been placed in the
bucket, leaving 18 on the ground.
I have said before I notice dis-
tinct little touches of literary grace
in that journalism of early days,
which perhaps is missing in our al-
leged survival-of-the-fittest age. Par-
ticularly was I struck in this regard
with a letter from Mr. Richard
Lethridge, of Melton, who, defend-
ing himself in controversy, makes
apt classical quotations. The weather,
any accident, crops, &c., are all
neatly described by editorial pen in
news of the day. Here is a para-
graph taken at random: A singular
occurrence has been reported to us
as having taken place in Bacchus
Marsh on Tuesday last. While two
persons were sitting in a room in
Mr. Kerr’s house, a child drew at-
tention to a snake which was issuing
from a hole in the hearth. Of course
great consternation was caused, and
an effort was made to get out of
danger, and also to obtain some
weapon with which to kill the snake.
Unfortunately in the confusion it
turned round and went “bach
again,” as the orchard robber said
when its owner accosted him creep-
ing under the hedge. However,


efforts were made to at least “scotch”
or “scorch” the reptile, for a large
fire was made in the vicinity of the
retreat, and an application of boil-
ing water was made. We have not
heard what success attended these
operations, but Mr. Kerr is deter-
mined not to have a second visit
from such an unwelcome “cricket
on the hearth.” Another snake epi-
sode is recorded a couple of issues
later : A snake story, so extraor-
dinary in its incidents that we on
first hearing declined to give it pub-
licity, has since been thoroughly
confirmed, and we recount it. Two
little boys of the name of Dugdale,
both under ten years of age, had
the courage to attack a large snake
with stones merely, and actually
succeeded in killing it. The occur-
rence took place on the Pentiand
Hills, and Mr. H. Meikle, a resident
there, happened to be in “at the
death,” and was much astonished
to find the smaller of the two boys
dragging the snake along as a
trophy. He measured it, and found
it to be some inches over five feet.
We may take this opportunity of
mentioning that the snake which
intruded upon the hearth and home
of Mr. Kerr, Bacchus Marsh, has
been found dead, upon the removal
of the hearthstones; from the effect
of boiling water poured down the
hole from which it made its un-
welcome egress.
December 15, 186 6, a site for a
Presbyterian church has been tem-
porarily reserved. It consists of one
acre two roods, and location is de-
scribed. A notification in sub-
leader of same date that “Express”
would be conducted and owned by
Messrs. Christopher Crisp and G-eo.
Lane, “who intend to maintain the
position now established for the
‘Express’ of being—if not the ‘maj-
esty of the local press’ (whatever
that may mean) —at any rate the
leading journal of the district.” The
“Guardian” was in full fling at the
time, and judging by certain com-
ments in the said sub-leader it must
have been a very bellicose journal.
In 186 6 the town must have been
in a ■ sort of primeval state, for
horsemen are advised not to ride on
the footpaths. The footpaths were
declared to be scarcely worthy of
the name, but they were not im-
proved by horses’ hoofs, and there
was a danger to children by a horse
suddenly passing a person’s door-
step. Apparently the footpaths were
bad enough, but they were better
than the middle of the road.
An old custom which has died
out is brought to mind in reading
that an entertainment, partaking of
the character of a “harvest home,”
was held at Mr. Louis Scott’s resi-
dence on Christmas evening. A big
company was present, and dancing
was indulged in “till daylight did ap-
pear.” I notice that sports were
held at McCanny’s hotel, Bacchus
Marsh, on Boxing Day, and the
names of two winners catch my
eye : Quoits and standing jump,
Cuthbertson; pole leap, Pat Murphy.
Bread in the Marsh has not al-
ways been dear, and in the para-
graph which I am about to repro-
duce humor evidently was not an
unknown quantity with the new
management. We remember a story,
so the paragraph runs, a story told
of an old woman who desired to ex-
pend equal sums upon the purchase
of bread and gin, and sent her
daughter to carry out this intention,
but before her messenger had pro-
ceeded far on the errand the old
lady called her back, and said —
“Bring all gin, for bread is so con-
founded dear I can’t afford to buy
it.” This anecdote has been brought
to my mind by the present keen
competition on the Marsh in the
sale of flour, and consequent cheap-
ness of bread, for certainly had this
ancient dame been a resident
amongst us she could have availed
herself of such an excuse for in-
dulging her liking for gin; albeit
she might be of opinion that “if
bread is the staff of life, gin is life
itself,” as another well-known anec-
dote affirms.
A robbery on January 5, 1887, at
Border Inn: A sum of £2 5 in notes
was abstracted from cash box placed
by Mr. Jones on his dressing table
for the night. Suspicion eventually
rested upon two travelling shoe-
makers drinking in various public
houses of the town. Shoemakers ar-
rested, and guilt proved. Senior-
constable Kiernan was particularly
active.


Hot summer, and snakes preval-
ent. A laboring man named Finnin,
at bottom of Marsh, whilst walking
through a paddock near his house,
is bitten by a snake, which coiled
round his lleg. Fortunately Finnin
had on a pair of thick moleskin
trousers, and worsted stockings,
which prevented poison fangs from
entering deeply into skin. Dr.
Tweeddale was shortly in attendance,
and applied the actual cautery, and
Finnin recovered.
February a splendid harvest. Re-
liable intimation of the yield of one
of the best crops of barley grown in
the district : Mr. W. H. McFarlane’s,
which has produced forty-five bush-
els to the acre.
Bacchus Marsh racehorses to the
fore—February, 1867—At Creswick
races, Mr. J. E. Crooke’s mare, Kaled,
won the Maiden Plate; and Mr.
Cuthbertson’s horse, Cartouche, the
Selling and Novel Race.
The advent of Sgt-Major Bowser.
February, 2, 1867. Arrangements
have been made between Captain
Cooper, of Bacchus Marsh, and Cap-
tain Windridge, of Kyneton, for se-
curing services of Sergeant-Major
Bowser as drill instructor for their
respective troops. He may be ex-
pected in Marsh in a few days. The
first half of each month he will de-
vote to Bacchus Marsh, the second
to Kyneton.
Those footpaths. Marsh 2, 1867 ;
A letter —Sir, Will you allow me to
urge upon the Road Board the con-
sideration of the fact that the foot-
paths of the town require a little
attending to ? They are very nar-
row, and every winter the gullies
which exist instead of gutters get
wider, and thus the pathway gets
narrower, and in the course of time
will disappear altogether, causing
some trouble to replace. Perhaps
as the Board has not much money
to expend in large works they will
turn their attention to the execu-
tion of a few small works in the
immediate vicinity of the township.
Yours, &c., —W.L.
McKenzie’s Flat comes into prom-
inence. The much talked of Mac-
Kenz ie’s flat is to be sold by auc-
tion at Melbourne, on the sth April,
1 867, at the auction rooms of Messrs.
Gemmell, Tv.ckett & Co. The fol-
lowing are the particulars, it will
be seen that the upset price is very
low : —County of Bourke, Parish of
Coimadai, at McKenzies’ Flat, be-
tween the Lerderderg and Good-
man’s Creeks, immediately west of
Mr. H. McLeod’s pre-emptive sec-
cion. Upset price, £3 per acre.
Myrniong news, March 16, 1867:
We are glad to see that the pro-
jected Mechanics’ Institute for Myr-
niong is being satisfactorily brought
before the public. The Committee
has appointed Mr. N. P. Webbe
Secretary, and collectors will be
authorised to receive subscriptions.
We believe that it is intended to en-
rol members at once, and hold meet-
ings in the schoolhouse, Myrniong,
pending the erection of a suitable
building upon the site granted by
Department.
Business enterprise We have
pleasure in calling attention to the
establishment of a new industry in
our district. Messrs. Turnbull &
Dugdale are prepared to supply bone
manure at a cheaper rate than it
can be procured in Melbourne. There
can be no doubt as to the fertilising
properties of bones being superior to
those of any other manure, and when
they can be obtained at a moderate
price a large demand is sure to arise.
Bacchus Marsh has ever been not-
ed for apple growth. In 1867, Mr.
John Payne showed some splendid
apples, grown at Broadlands. They
all weighed a trifle over a pound
each, and one of them measured 121
inches in diameter. The quality
was excellent.
In one regard Bacchus Marsh of
1867 was above Bacchus Marsh 1914,
as may be deduced by the following
item of information : It is gratifying
to know that Bacchus Marsh is to
possess a local solicitor among the
other institutions of the township.
Mr. Gell announces that he may be
consulted daily at the premises re-
cently occupied by Mr. Dyer.
It is interesting to learn how
stock sold in 1867. Mr. J. E.
Crook reports breeding sows £6 to
£7/15/ ; young pigs, £3 to £4 ;
suckers, £1 ; cattle brought from £lO
downwards. Sheep satisfactory.
A site for a Common School at
Limekilns gazetted. Two acres
county of Bourke, parish of Coiraa-


dai, at Pyreete Creek.
Messrs. Denis Ryan, John Tyson,
and George Drysdale have been ap-
pointed trustees of the land set apart
for Mechanics’ Institute purposes at
Myrniong.
A further note on McKenzie’s
Flat. McKenzie’s Flat which some
persons in this district a short time
ago seemed very anxious of pur-
chasing, was offered for sale in Mel-
bourne as per advertisement at an
upset price of £3 per acre, but fail-
ed to obtain any purchasers.
I came across a fine biographical
compilation in sth October’s issue,
1866. The family of Symington, of
Plopetoun, have the great honor of
being direct line of descent from
William Symington, the real inven-
tor of steam navigation. This com-
pilation was probably the workman-
ship of the early editor. Dr. Rae.
William Symington, in 17 89, fitted
a boat with steam propelling appa-
ratus, which was tried on the Forth
and on the Clyde Canal with such
success that Lord Dundas and the
Duke of Bridgewater earnestly as-
sisted Mr. Symington to further de-
veloping his invention. However; un-
toward circumstances, prevented the
inventor from obtaining such a re-
ward for his services as their merit
deserved, but some recognition of
them was made by George the
Fourth, who granted him £IOO from
his privy purse, and a further sum
of £SO a year or two afterwards,
He died on 2 2nd March, 1831. “An
inventive son of an Inventive father,’’
Mr, William Symington, C.E., dies
at his residence, Bacchus Marsh, on
17th March, 1867. He had been a
colonist of some twelve years’ stand-
ing, nearly nine of which were
passed in Bacchus Marsh. He gave
every proof of inventive faculty, for
he had besides other inventions per-
fected a plan for preserving pota-
toes, and also one for preserving
milk. The former invention was
sold to a company in England, who
in turn obtained £I,OOO for it. Mr.
Symington had in his possession a
model of the first the
“Charlotte Dundas.” An exhibit of
the granulated preserved pota-toes at
the Intercolonial Exhibition in Mel-
bourne, of 186 6, obtained for Mr.
Symington a gold medal for the Com-
missioners. The recognition of the
merits of the invention must have
been gratifying during the last few
weeks of his existence to the inven-
tor. Mr. Symington was born in
Falkirk, Stirling Shire, on 2 2nd
March, 1802. In 1844 he received
the gold medal of the Society of
Arts for his invention for dessicat-
ing or extracting moisture from var-
ious substances, such as woollen and
silk fabrics, wood, &c., and for puri-
fying casks. Several of these kinds
of apparatus were supplied to Her
Majesty’s Government for use in the
Crimean Hospitals during the Rus-
sian war for drying and disinfecting
clothing. The invention was also
used in all cases where drying or
roasting powers were required, such
as for roasting coffee, chicory, &c.,
or for warming large buildings, and
was subsequently applied to assist
the processes of preserving potatoes
and milk above mentioned. Mr. Sym-
ington also exhibited at the Great
Exhibition, of 1857, an improved
gun wad, made of wood, which was
then rejected by the Admiralty as
unsuitable for adoption by them,
but at the time in which sketch was
compiled this wad was almost ex-
clusively used in the service, and
Mr. Symington fitted up in Wool-
wich Arsenal one of his dessicating
machines for the very purpose of
seasoning or drying gun wads of his
own invention. lie also effected an
improvement in projectiles for
smooth bore guns, obviating the
necessity of rifling. This was brought
under the notice of the Treasurer of
Victoria of the day, but no notice
appears to have been taken of it,
and Mr. Symington did not care to
pursue the matter.
On his arrival in Victoria, Mr.
Symington turned his attention to
effecting improvement in quarto-
crushing and amalgamating proces-
ses, more particularly the latter, and
took out a patent for a process, the
principal feature of which was the
introducing amongst the pulverised
quartz of quicksilver in a state of
vapor. Other matter prevented his
following up this invention. Amongst
the minor improvements made by
Mr. Symington one might be men-
tioned as showing the inventive bent
of his mind. He had occasion to


cure a smoking chimney, and im-
mediately devised a plan as simple
as it was effectual, namely, fixing a
few inches above the top of the
chimney proper an outer casing (or
larger chimney) of metal, leaving a
space all round between it and the
chimney for the smoke to escape so
that any wind which otherwise blew
directly across the top of the chim-
ney was broken by the edge of the
protector, and the smoke had time
to escape down the side.
The late IviT. Symington, during
his residence in the Marsh, devoted
himself to brewing pursuits, and
although the occupation was said
not to be congenial to his tastes, yet
public opinion was unanimous that
he produced a good article. He
built his own dwelling house . and
brew house ; constructed his own
vats and casks ; and in fact nearly
everything required for the business.
The sketch ends, "The funeral took
place on Tuesday, and was numer-
ously attended. Every mark of re-
spect was paid to the deceased, and
thus closed the career of one who in
a manner links Bacchus Marsh with
one of the important achievements
of science, viz., the consummation
of steam navigation, and who be-
sides was considered to be a bene-
factor to mankind as having added
considerably to the knowledge of
mechanical appliances.”
I pass on to cull other items of
interest.
A gratifying sign of the durabil-
ity of the place in 1861. Mr. James
Reid is erecting a new brick work-
shop to replace a wooden one. The
"Express” throws out a hint that
"Penny Readings” should be estab-
lished in the Marsh. These enter-
tainments were successful elsewhere,
and even Myrniong had read the
signs of the times aright by having
"Penny Readings.” Bacchus Marsh’s
-'min street in 186 7 was not the
free-for-traffic thoroughfare that it
is now. There was a tree in the
main street opposite Mr. Young’s
(Mr. T. Anderson’s) which the paper
said should be cut down, for during
a thunderstorm bourns had been
blown from it, to the danger of
Passers-by, and the tree was seen
to be a source of danger. A limb of
it did fall, but without harming any-
one, and there is now a large branch
suspended in a very dangerous posi-
tion. Thus the main street of 186 7.
I have now to reproduce an extra-
ordinary happening. The unusual
event of a birth of triplets occurred,
the wife of Mr. E. Lynch, market
gardener, Bacchus Marsh, having
presented her husband with three
sons. "Should His Excellency the
Governor feel it his duty to make
the customary Royal donation on
such occasions, as the representative
of His Majesty, doubtless the gift
will be acceptable.” Liberal presents
by the public were made, and a
substantial contribution came from
Lady Manners-Sutton, also from
Mayor of Melbourne, through repre-
sentative of District, M. P. Smith.
Much public satisfaction that tenders
were called (May 11th, 1867) for
the conveyance of mails, three times
a week, to and from Bacchus Marsh
to Coimadai (then known as Lime-
kilns, or Pyreete). On 6th May,
1867, inauguration of Bacchus Marsh
Racing Club. The first committee,
Messrs. J. B. Crook, T. Burtt, T.
Taubman, J. Saunders, T. Brown,
E. Jones, D. Harbord, J. Cuthbert-
son, W. Grant, and W. E. Stanfield
(Sec.). The attendance of the Com-
mon school in 1867 was 122. Credit-
able neighbourliness was displayed
on the Pentland Hills when 2 3
ploughs assembled to give a day’s
work for the benefit of Mrs. T.
Fairbairn and family. The result
was that 20 acres were ploughed.
Penny Readings commenced. Messrs.
G. G. Patterson, A. Forsyth, Con.
Mahoney, W. Grant, Gell and J.
Hanlon read', and Messrs. Wilson,
Richardson, W. Watson and P.
Robertson (accompanist) sang.
Piano lent by Mr. J. Young. Mr.
P. Robertson’s comic song, "Get up,
and bar the door,” was evidently
the hit of the evening. It is re-
ported that a mushroom was found
at Bell’s station, near the Stony
Creek Reservoir, Beremboke, meas-
uring four feet five inches in cir-
cumference, with a stem eighteen
inches round. It is not stated how
many pints of "catchup” was made
therefrom. Agitation was fairly be-
gun re those footpaths. Mr. John
Henry Scott signs his name to his
letter, and hits out. In dry weather


he said the footpaths were toler-
able, but in wet, an excursion
through the mud was anything but
enjoyable. If anyone walked as far
as the post-ofrice he need not ask
where was the Marsh, for unfor-
tunately the appearance of the road
if not suggestive of a marsh was
most undeniably, and remarkably
like a bog. Authorship on the
Pentland Hills. A pamphlet en-
titled Anabaptism briefly examined
by the Rev. Joseph Black, M.A.,
of Ballan and Pentland Hills, is
advertised. On sth February, 1866, a
public meeting was held at the res-
idence of Mr. Louis Scott for the
purpose of establishing a school for
the children of Parwan, being too
great a distance to attend the
Marsh school. The following gentle-
men were appointed as local com-
mittee —Messrs. C. Gumming, W.
McDonald, L. Scott, R. G-reenwell,
T. Oliver, T. Edwards, and A. Mac-
Rae. Mr. Boyle was appointed
teacher. The rate of school fees,
1/ for a single scholar, and 6d. for
each child after the first from each
family. Mr. Boyle started with 30
scholars. There was some dissat-
isfaction judging from the amount of
correspondence that the locality
should be called Bacchus Marsh.
One correspondent was quite sure
that the god of wine was not more
dominant here than in any other
township of the colony, and neither
was it a Marsh as its name indi-
cates. The correspondent declared
that if you travelled one hundred
miles round it you would say it
was the driest and most pleasant
place you were able to find. One
suggested name was “Werribee,”
another “Merrimu,” but evidently
as “Bendigo” was preferred to the
more classical name “Sandhurst” by
the concerned inhabitants, so the
local community has elected to keep
to “Bacchus Marsh,” not “Bacchus’s
Marsh,” as is sometimes heard from
some old pioneers. Strange to know
that in free Australia tolls were
imposed, but a notification appears
that Mr. Thomas Hancock Light-
foot has been appointed manager
of Common Toll Road. It is within
the recollection of many of the older
inhabitants of the town the toll
gate at Deep Creek.
An accident is recorded of a very
serious nature that befell (August
3rd, 1867) the eldest son of Mr. R.
Kerr, of Parwan. It appears that
he had been engaged with a roller,
drawn by two horses, one in the
shafts and one leading, and was
returning home. In passing through
a gate, the noise of the roller on the
hard ground alarmed the horses, and
the youth was jammed against a
fence. He attempted to get on the
fence, but before he could do so
the side of the roller came in con-
tact with him, and he received very
severe injuries; indeed he had a
narrow escape from being killed.
The youth of 15 years recovered,
and to-day is Mr. James Kerr, of
“Morveu.”
Many meetings of “Penny Read-
ings’’ have already been held up to
date, August 3rd, 1867, and were
highly successful, the house gener-
ally returning some £5. What struck
me as a peculiar musical combina-
tion was a number evidently very
popular, for at every meeting it, “a
medley on violin and concertina was
well received.’’ The said instru-
ments sometimes rose to a trio,
harmonium being added. The enter-
tainment of August 3rd, 186 7, con-
cluded by the playing of Auld Lang
Syne on the violin and concertina
by Messrs. Carlton and Baine. But
those Penny Readings were not with-
out a disagreeable alloy, for the re-
port of this particular gathering had
to make comment that many persons
attended the Readings with the in-
tention of ridiculing the performers
because they were amateurs. Such
conduct was annoying to the greater
part of the audience, and was very
unbecoming, but it was conceived
that thoughtlessness rather than
malice actuated the offenders, but it
was hoped that “this hint will be
sufficient to prevent the recurrence
of such conduct.’’
Deemed worthy of record, as indi-
cative of progress of district, that
Mr. Janies Cuthbertson had taken
Ist Prize for Brahma Pootras at Mel-
bourne Show. August 7th, 186 7, the
shock of an earthquake was sharply
felt at Bacchus Marsh, Parwan and
Limekilns. The more classic name
Coimadai has not yet been applied
to Limekilns. All agree that the


shock was a severe one, and to have
resembled the noise of a vehicle
travelling along at a rapid rate.
No damage was done, not even to
the extent of a serious fright, but
it was reported that a loaded gun
was caused to explode (without
harming anyone) by the shock. A
great soiree and concert, in aid of
Central Common School, Bacchus
Marsh. The Head Teacher stated that
if the average attendance was only
a half-child more another assistant
could be appointed. Mr. W. Grant
(Union Mills) on responding for
vote of thanks to ladies, stated that
he could not contribute even that
one half pupil to the school. That
Mr. Peter Robertson must have been
a most popular comedian. I notice
that he was to the fore in all the
readings in light comedy. At the
soiree he gave “Soda Water,” and
the criticism was that of course the
audience roared with laughter.
A correspondent bewails that Mad-
dingley cemetery is in a very neg-
lected state ; the fences were out of
repair, and the graves unfenced,
presented unmistakable evidence of
the devastation caused by horses and
sheep being allowed to trespass
within its boundaries.
Church Progress. Sept. 7, 1867 :
Tenders are called for the labour
required to erect a Baptist Church,
on a site near the Central Common
School. This building will doubt-
less be an ornament to the township,
and we hope the Committee may
meet with no great difficulties in
the way of the speedy carrying out
of their plans. When the Common
School is fenced in, and the Roman
Catholics proceed to erect their
church on the same hill, the locality
will be an imitation of the Eastern
Hill at Melbourne, and an additional
reason will exist for beautifying the
roadway by planting trees. Mr.
Cuthbertson in a letter in a subse-
quent issue ventilates a grievance
that though the lowest tenderer he
did not succeed in getting the con-
tract for the erection of the build-
ing. An extraordinary condition in
specifications was that contractor
must be a “bricklayer.” Mr. Cuth-
bertson apparently wasn’t, and his
tender was ruled null and void.
The popular Penny Readings on
the wane. The Secretary found it
difficult to get assistance, and there
was editorial comment that it was
a pity such was the case, for the
public were by no means tired of
the readings.
A peculiar piece of information —
Mr. A. Forsyth has been lucky
enough to select a very nice piece of
land at the head of the Korkuperri-
mul valley, with his £SO volunteer
certificate.
Goodman’s Creek gold mining pos-
sibilities again to the fore, Oct. 5,
1867. The “Express” is informed
that very good prospects had been
obtained by Mr. Gulliver, of Lime-
kilns, and if plenty of water could
be got there is no doubt that sluic-
ing operations, upon a large scale,
would pay well, as the sinking is
shallow, only four feet. The “Ex-
press” mentions that some potatoes
grown by Mr. Warren, of Breakneck,
between Melton and Limekilns, were
sent to Ballarat, and when the earth
upon them came to be washed off
gold was found. Gold was thus
found over a large extent of ground,
not actually recognised as auriferous.
Forty-seven years ago such was the
outlook of Goodman’s creek in re-
gard to the precious ore; it appar-
ently has marked time ever since.
But the Heathen Chinee was
located at Goodman’s creek in fair
numbers, and had exercised their
ingenuity in the manufacture of
spurious gold. It appears that the
National Bank of Bacchus Marsh
had.been in the habit of buying
gold from the Chinese. On sending
down a parcel of gold to Melbourne
for melting it was discovered that
it contained an alloy in such quan-
tity as to reduce its presumed value
some £6O. On this becoming known
to Mr. McCausland, the manager of
the Bank at the Marsh, the police
were communicated with, and it was
resolved that the next gold offered
by a Chinese should be carefully
examined, and the man secured,
should the gold prove spurious. Ac-
cordingly the first lot of gold offered
by a Chinaman was tested by nitric
acid, but it was found to be good.
It was then feared that the Chinese
would know that the Bank was on
the watch, and any further delay
in searching the huts at Goodman’s


Creek would enable the manufac-
turers of the spurious gold to either
leave the district or destroy their
implements of trade. Accordingly
a warrant was obtained for the ar-
rest of a Chinaman described as
about 2 8 years of age and very
thin. Senior-constable Kiernan,
Trooper Johnston and Mr. McCaus-
land proceeded to the Chinese huts
at Goodman’s Creek, and all the
inmates that could be got together
were placed under the surveillance
of Johnston, while huts were
searched by Mr. McCausland and
the Senior-constable. Ah Souey,
who is believed to have been the
principal culprit managed to escape,
and although the two policemen re-
mained on watch all night, and made
a thorough search on the following
morning, the man was not to be
found. Two Chinamen were taken
in custody, and the police found
some gold, believed to be spurious,
together with a small clay crucible
supposed to be used in the manu-
facture of the gold. The two Chin-
ese in custody were named Chin
Hock and Min Chow, Ah Souey
was afterwards arrested at Dayles-
ford. He was rather cleverly cap-
tured. The detective, afraid that
he might not answer to his right
name, asked him if he were Ah
Kat, and he said “No, me Ah
Souey.” Chin Hock, Min Chow,
and Ah Souey were sentenced to two
years’ hard labor.
A terrible local tragedy occurs.
It appears that Mr. A. Lewin, ac-
countant at the National Bank, went
out shooting, accompanied by Chas.
Crook, second son of Mr. J. E.
Crook, a lad about 12 years old.
In a short time Mr. Lewin returned
exhibiting great anguish of mind,
exclaiming, “Mr. Crook, I have shot
your son.” Of course the statement
caused great consternation, and on
proceeding to the spot where the
poor boy lay it was found his skull
had all been shattered. At the in-
quest, Arthur Lewin deposed that he
“started from Mr. Crook’s house at
5 p.rn. on Bth (Nov., 1867) and went
over to an island near Nagle’s,
about 1-mile distant. Deceased was
walking behind witness, who had a
gun for rabbit shooting; the gun
was full cocked. Deceased said
‘there’s a rabbit.’ I turned round
with my gun, which went off. De-
ceased was behind me four or five
feet. I threw the gun from my
right shoulder to my right arm when
it went off.” Verdict of jury—death
accidentally inflicted.
Loyalty reigns supreme in the
issue of the “Express,” Nov., 30,
1867. The instigating cause was
the arrival of His Royal Highness
the Duke of Edinburgh, in Victoria,
and the “Express” looks handsome
with its thick red border and blue
type. Picnics in honor of the Royal
visit are recorded elsewhere, and
the leading article was couched in
thought most patriotic.
December 21, 1867, a great bush
fire out Racecourse way. Flames sped
along grass at great pace, until they
reached farm of Mr. Hine, and con-
sumed all his crop of wheat, which
was a fine one, and had just been
placed in stock the night previous.
Dwelling house was saved, but
stables burnt. The fire went from
Hine’s to Keefe’s selected land,
where it burnt several hundred acres
of pasture, but luckily the dwelling
house, which was of wood, was sur-
rounded by trench, which saved it
from destruction. An adjoining
paddock, belonging to Mr. Silcox,
had some long grass in it, which
flamed up in a second, but as a por-
tion of wheat crop, which was green
stayed the fire in that direction.
Mr. Clarke was a heavy loser on ac-
count of the fire.
The children’s picnic, in honour
of the Duke of Edinburgh, Dec. 28,
1867, was a notable affair. Each
child received a Duke of Edinburgh
medal. I wonder have these medals
been preserved ? The programme of
sports, together with names of win-
ners, will doubtless be amusingly
interesting to “old boys” of the
district. Handicap race 50 yards,
boys 5 to 8 years old. Ist, G-. Cuth-
bertson, 2/6; 2nd, Burbidge, 1/.
Ditto 7 5 yards, 7 to 10 years old,
Ist, Carter, 2/6 ; 2nd, J. Munro, 1/.
Boys under 11, James Young and
J. Carter, equal 2/ each. Hurdle
race, boys under 14, Ist, R. Simp-
son, 5/ ; 2nd, Mcßae, 2/6. Vaulting
with pole, Ist, R. Reid, 5/ ; 2nd,
G. Simpson, 2/6. Sack race, Ist,
Clarke, 2/6; 2nd, Bowser* 1/. Han-


dicap race, boys under 15, Ist, R.
Simpson, 5/; 2nd, B. Patterson, 2/6;
and so on.
Probably a pertinent letter —Sir,
Who is responsible for the wanton
and disgraceful desecration of the
graves of the departed, both in the
old burying ground, adjoining the
Church of England, and in the
Roman Catholic ground at the foot
of the Marsh. If 20/ cannot be
found to repair the fences, in the
name of humanity keep cows, horses,
pigs and goat from trampling on
the dead. Yours truly, Homo.
We are now on the file 186 8-69.
Maddingley Reserve history. The
parties who had pegged out land
under 42nd clause on the ground
known as Maddingley Reserve had
been successful so the notification
runs in “Express” of Jan. 4th, 186 8,
in inducing the Minister of Lands
to accede to their request to occupy
the land under license. A public
meeting (2 00 in attendance) had ap-
pointed Messrs. J. Ryan, W. Watson,
and T. Cain, jun., a deputation to
interview Minister, but they got
such an unfavorable reply that it
was thought that the application to
the Minister would have to be aban-
doned. However, on a subsequent
date Messrs. J. Ryan and W. Wat-
son, accompanied by 20 of the men
who had pegged out land, were in-
troduced to the Minister by Messrs.
King and Lalor, M.P’s. The Hon.
Peter Lalor’s photograph hangs to-
day in the Shire Hall. Mr. Ryan
was the spokesman, and his plea
that the opening up of reserve would
be a great benefit to the neighbour-
hood, for such had been the opinion
of 200 inhabitants, with only three
dissentients. The minority had a
counter memorial, their contention
being that Reserve for years had
been used for recreative purposes,
and also a drill ground for volun-
teers. The dissentients especially
urged that the reserve, which was
thickly timbered, furnished firewood
for the whole surrounding neigh-
borhood. A member of deputation
said that he had been a member of
the volunteers for eight years, and
a drill ground elsewhere had been
Used. The deputation had no inten-
tion of applying to have Flat por-
tion opened for selection. The Min-
ister’s decision was that he would
reserve from sale 200 acres for a
township, and 100 acres for other
purposes, and throw the remainder
of land, about 500 acres, open for
selection.
In the news of the day appears
following : —The prizes in Jones’
Border Sweep upon Port Phillip
Stakes fell as follows :—lst, £2 5,
Mr. Frank Hanna ; 2nd, £lO, Mr. I.
Pear; 3rd, £5, Mr. C. Wilson. An
ancient industry of the Marsh,
Congratulation is expressed that the
Union Mill, at the lower end of the
Marsh is no longer to stand empty
and idle as a monument of local de-
cadence, but that milling operations
would be resumed with great vigor
under new ownership of Messrs. W.
& H. C. Grant. The machinery was
fully described, and indeed an in-
spection of the mill generally was
claimed to be most interesting. In
the process of time the mill has
again become the monument of local
decadence. Another snake story. I
give the exact wording of the para-
graph. We saw recorded a short
time back in one of the country
newspapers that a snake had been
killed while emerging from the bot-
tom of a harmonium in church. It
would appear that snakes have a
liking for music, for it has come
to our knowledge that Mrs. Peter
Alexander sat down to her piano
with a view of running over a piece
of music, but she found that the
keys would give no sound. On ex-
amining the interior of the instru-
men, it was seen that a snake, some
4-|-ft. long, had placed itself under
the hammers, and hence the obstruc-
tion. The snake was killed as it
lay by means of an ordinary dinner
fork, and afterwards pulled out. It
is singular how the reptile got into
the piano, the more especially as
the dwelling place in which instru-
ment was placed had only been re-
cently erected, and was altogether of
a more substantial kind than most
habitations in which snakes make
a lodgment.
Much about. West Bourke Minis-
terial candidates, Messrs. Riddell, J.
T. Smith and M. L. King, but I
had better avoid the recording of
political struggles. But I cannot


resist noticing something that oc-
curred at a meeting of the opposi-
tion candidate, in 186 8, a Mr. L.
S. Joh'nston. I am amused at a pre-
liminary remark of the Chairman,
who hoped that as it was a custom
to question candidate the electors
present would only question one at
a time. There seemed to be a sug-
gestiveness in this, that at meetings
of the Bacchus Marsh electors it-was
the custom for half-a-dozen to be on
their feet at the same time, question-
ing the candidate, and at this par-
ticular meeting the candidate was
considerably scotched, notably over
his action in connection with the
Darling Grant, and indeed the noble
electors so far forgot themselves as
to hiss when Mr. Johnston told them
straight out that he was proud that
he had signed a petition for the re-
call of Sir Charles, whom he be-
lieved to be doing all he could to
injure the colony. The feeling of
the meeting evidently reached fever
heat, for Mr, Watts moved, and Mr.
T. Anderson (Lerderderg) seconded,
that Mr. Johnston was not a fit and
proper person to represent the con-
stituency. Mr. H. Tanner moved as
an amendment that Mr. Johnston
was a fit and proper person. Mr. P.
Robertson seconded the amendment,
“amidst roars of laughter.” The
amendment was voted on, and about
ten hands were put up for it. The
rest of the meeting, 190 strong, en-
thusiastically voted for the motion.
Mr. Johnston stood on his hind legs,
and told the meeting that he did not
care a snap of his fingers whether
they voted for him or not.
Boys will be boys, and if a quarrel
took place it ever is considered a
fair thing to shy a stone at the
enemy, and an item runs that a boy,
eight years of age, named Joseph
Booth, did land a brick fair on the
temple of another boy, George Wil-
son, of same age. Dr. Tweeddale
had to be called in, but though pat-
ient was in a dangerous state for a
time, under medical attention he was
in a fair way to recovery.
The personality of Mr. James
Young J.P., is stamped upon Bac-
chus Marsh history. Evidently he
was an all-round man, and no pub-
lic question popped up unless he was
a kind of guide, philosopher, and
friend to the community. There was
another strong man, and that was
Mr. J. E. Crook, ana I take it that
the Marsh was none the worse for
having such leaders. The continu-
ous record of Mr. James Young
proves that he was public spirited
in the extreme, and it does appear
that in all his undertakings on be-
half of the community his motive
was transparent; perhaps from a
business point of view it would have
been better that on some public
matters he was not quite so asser-
tive. But there is no doubting his
ability. It is not that anyone has
told me anything about James
Young, but I guage his usefulness
from those numerous paragraphs,
letters, addresses in which he is
concerned, directly or indirectly. His
public utterances were informative,
and his letters weighty, and I would
scarcely think that to-day we had
a citizen that was such an important
local factor as Mr. James Young, or
Mr. J. E. Crook. However, I re-
produce a paragraph. *A meeting of
the Committee of the Mechanics’
Institute was held on specified date,
1868. There was a good attendance.
The Secretary reported that in ac-
cordance with the instructions of
the Committee he had waited upon
Mr. James Young, J.P., for the pur-
pose of ascertaining upon what
terms that gentleman would grant
to the Institute an additional strip
of land on the north side of the
building, so that a fence might be
erected. Mr. Young had agreed to
let the Committee have as much
land as they liked without payment
in the meantime, but as he contem-
plated selling the frontages contigu-
ous to the Institute, he would charge
the Committee the average price
realised at the sale. This offer the
Committee considered to be very
liberal, and after some discussion it
was decided to take up twenty feet
additional frontage to the land upon
which the Institute now stands, with
corresponding depth. It was thought
this would allow sufficient scope for
enlargement of building. Mr. Jas.
Reid called attention to the fact that
though Mr. Young had given the
site for the building and other as-
sistance, yet no acknowledgment of
his liberality had been made. He


thought this an unaccountable over-
sight. He therefore moved that Mr.
J. Young, J.P., be made a life mem-
ber of the Institute, and that an
address be presented to him for his
services. All present concurred, and
resolution having been seconded by
Mr. Greenwell, was carried with ap-
plause.
Vegetable supply in 186 8. As a
proof of the scarcity of garden land
and gardeners in the Marsh, it was
mentioned that vegetables were
scarcely to be got in the township,
and yet the demand so great that a
dealer in the line found it profitable
to come all the way from Melbourne
to sell.
Greendale’s educational facilities
are outlined in a communication,
Feb. Bth, 1868, that the school would
be held in Mr. Graham’s barn pend-
ing the erection of the school house.
Land values in their increase or
decrease are interesting to most.
Mr. W. Anderson’s sale of Mr.
Young’s land, 1868 , realised prices
considered to be high. The average
was nearly £lO per acre. The lots
were all on the Lerderderg side of
Gisborne road. The block of 11
acres adjoining Mr. Kiely’s farm,
was bought by that gentleman and
Mr. Tanner for £9 per acre. Pre-
sumably that land was sold the other
day and brought twice that amount.
The “Guardian,” the rival paper,
is duly reprimanded by “Express”
for presenting garbled reports of
gold discovery in the locality, bring-
ing down upon the community the
animadversion of the “Age” news-
paper, who complained of the sad
lack of intelligence of the Bacchus
Marsh gold discoveries. The “Ex-
press” charges its contemporary with
“largely dealing in intelligence
drawn from the imagination.”
Litigancy in high life of Bacchus
Marsh, two medical practitioners, a
Clerk of Courts, &c., to wit Dr.
William Bone versus Clerk of Courts,
John Sisson Cooper. Grounds of
action : —Dr. Bone was driving his
buggy about a mile and a half this
side of Myrniong. He met Mr.
Cooper driving two horses in a
buggy ; soon after Mrs. Cooper on
horseback. Mrs. Cooper said some-
thing to her companions and gal-
loped close to Dr. Bone. Two coun-
sel for one party, and one for the
other, and numerous witnesses. The
doctor’s evidence was that Mrs.
Cooper’s horse pranced, struck the
shaft and broke it with its hind
leg. A high society horse indulg-
ing in high kicking. All the ani-
mals were spirited, for the doctor’s
horse plunged, and nearly kicked the
doctor’s head; another instance of
high kicking. The end of the cal-
amitous accident was that the rein
caught the splashboard and cap-
sized the vehicle. Possibly the rein
never did any such thing, but that
is the evidence of the doctor on
oath as reported, and it must be
accepted. Evidence for the defence
was somewhat contradictory. Every-
one was on his or her right side
of the road. The gallant Sergeant-
Major Bowser gave evidence that
Larry, Mrs. Cooper’s Kingsburgh
who did the damage was afterwards
scarcely worth a cent; a “vet” that
the outside of the stifle joint was
damaged. The Sergeant-Major stated
that the horse was originally worth
about £35, and on account of the
accident had decreased in value to
a moderate thirty shillings. His
Honor of the County Court nicely
solved the intricacies of all this high-
kicking, and duly elucidated same
by giving the verdict to Mrs. Cooper
in the one case, and one for Dr.
Bone in the rebutting charge. Both
sides had to pay their own costs,
and the expenditure involved in re-
pairing the vehicle was accordingly
only added to so far as the worthy
doctor was concerned, and “Larry’s”
thirty shillings value rapidly reached
the vanishing point. Thus the ham-
let though secluded had its little
squabbles, dramas, comedies and
such will ever be the case where
humanity, with all its virtues and
foibles dwells. And somehow, as
I glance over the old files, I am re-
minded that even a quiet neighbor-
hood has its interesting annals. I
have come across the uglier, but
that shall remain in obscuriy for
there is such a thing as scandal, and
it should for ever hide its dimin-
ished head.
I can hardly pass a case in same
County Court, as humor was not al-
together absent. One farmer at the
bottom of the Marsh made the


offensive remark that a fine animal
of his neighbor looked as if it had
the “belly-ache.” I get this from
the sworn evidence. This was taken
as personally offensive, ' and result
that both neighbours pummelled one
another on the road. I really was
not interested enough to read to
the end and find whether the indi-
vidual who made the terrible accu-
sation against the blood animal was
made to swallow his words or
whether the horse, did really have
“abominable” troubles !
March 7th, 1868. Extraordinary
occurrence. A mishap happened to
some children, who were poisoned
by eating berries, or seed pods, from
a plant called Stramonium, or thorn
apple, the outward appearance of
which is not unlike that of a filbert,
while the inside contains small
white seeds. The victims of the
disaster are the son of Mr. T. B.
O’Callaghan, schoolmaster, Bacchus
Marsh, aged about four years; and
a grand-daughter of Mr. John Daley,
of Tullamore cottage, Bacchus
Marsh, and daughter of Mr. Keys.
The three resident doctors were in
attendance, and the stomach pump
was used, but the boy’s case is con-
sidered hopeless, while the girl is
out of danger. The children got the
poisonous berries from near the
banks of the Werribee. The latest
accounts stated that both the child-
dren were improving.
March 14, 1868. A long account
of the opening of the Baptist
Church, and really a branch of the
Rev. James Taylor’s Collins Street
church. ' The general execution of
the building was left unreservedly
in the hands of Mr. J. F. Taylor,
bricklayer; Mr. Nelson, carpenter;
asisted by Mr. T. G. Pearce, Secre-
tary to the congregation. There
were many speakers, and the Rev.
James Taylor, of Collins Street,
occupied the chair. The several
addresses read well, but the closing
remark of the Chairman particularly
catches my eye. The purpose of
these articles is to give a reflex of
the early life of the community, and
I am influenced to believe that the
congregational singing in those
early days of the Marsh must have
been of a most vigorous character.
The Rev. James Taylor said, in con-r
elusion, that he was not much of a
judge of music, but he would ask
the local Baptists to sing a little
softer. He fthe speaker) was very-
fond of plaintive and soothing har-
mony.
April 4, 1868. Sergeant-Major
Bowser started a Bacchus Marsh
Rifle Association, to afford shooting
practice to civilians as well as vol-
unteers. Association formed. Sub-
scription, 5/ per quarter. Dr. Bone
was elected Secretary, and Mr. Mac-
Causland, Treasurer.
Industrial beginning of Bacchus
Marsh. April 11, 1868. Mr. G.
Wood commenced chaff-cutting by
horse-power in the newly-erected
addition to his store; and a require-
ment long felt in Bacchus Marsh
and district was supplied in the
person of Mr, Terence Davis, who
commenced business as a plumber
and tinsmith.
An uncommon item in programme
of sports at Pyke’s Flat—horses
used by bullock drivers will com-
pete for a new saddle. It is easy
to understand that the bullock-driv-
ing cult was no inconsiderable sec-
tion of society in those days; any-
how it can’t be denied that in those
early days bullock-driving laid the
foundation of many an opulent fam-
ily of the present day.
On May 30, 1868, is recorded re-
sults of a subscription match of
Bacchus Marsh Rifle Association,
and the selection of prizes reads
somewhat humourously: Lieutenant
Pearce, 59, bag of flour and Dork-
ing cock; W. E. Standfleld, 57, doz.
Colonial wine and pig; J. Young,
48, cheese and half-a-dozen porter:
Sergeant-Major Bowser, 44, pair of
Brahmapootra pullets and ham; P.
Robertson, 43, tin of biscuits and
pig; Corporal McFarlane, 38, calf
and wether; Con. Mahoney, 38, bag
of potatoes and pig; Corporal Wat-
son, 36, volume of Leisure Hour
and pig; Dr. Bone, 36, lamb and
pair of fowls.
The Bacchus Marsh Caledonian
Society has a most successful gath-
ering. There were two pipers on
the ground. Nineteen events were
too much for the day, and the walk-
ing match was concluded in the
dark, and thereupon arose a fiery
controversy as to who ran or walk-


ed. Prize was not awarded, and
race had to be contested for on a
subsequent date, on the Maddingley
road. Todd came in first, but Com-
mittee held that Henry was the one
entitled to the prize, grounds for
said judgment not given. Appar-
ently this was not satisfactory, for
a challenge match presumably was
afterwards won by Mr. William
Watson, of Parwan.
June 6, 1868, cash box of Border
Inn stolen; thief convicted, and sen-
tenced to three months.
A scholastic problem of 1868, or
education as she was in the sixties
—The Chairman, Central Common
School Committee. Sir, —When it
was proposed to erect the Central
Common School we were told that
if we were to give up the then ex-
isting schools, and concentrate them
all in one, a better staff of teachers
would be engaged, the children bet-
ter attended to, and they would re-
ceive a better education under the
new system than under the old one.
If there has been any alteration, I
consider it is for the worse, not for
the better. When I sent ray boy to
school after the harvest he was able
to work any question in the first
book of arithmetic up to reduction.
Instead of his being allowed to woik
reduction, as anyone would expect,
he is made to work compound addi-
tion, subtraction, but never a ques-
tion he has not done before. When
I spoke to Mr. Wilson, the teacher,
about it, he said he could not help
it, for there were rules laid down
for his guidance, and he could not
advance in arithmetic, for the rea-
son that he was not a good reader
and writer. If he is not a good
reader, why is not more attention
paid to him in his reading lesson?
Surely six reading lessons in three
weeks is not sufficient to bring on
a bad reader who is not allowed to
proceed with his arithmetic until he
is able to read a certain lesson. I
would ask what is the use of supply-
ing a boy with a book and slate if
he is not allowed to use them, but
has to work all the sums required
at a blackboard in a class? Surely
the Committee do not call that the
superior method of instruction we
were promised. I consider that the
present system of teaching in the
Central School should be altered as
soon as possible. If not, we may as
well keep our children at home, and
the money in our pocket, and not
pay it out for nothing. I would
suggest that the school fees be con-
siderably reduced, and altered in
such a manner that the charges
would rise as the pupil advances. I
am, yours faithfully, W. Anderson,
Lucknow, Bacchus Marsh. 1 find no
account of how Mr. Anderson’s
problem was solved.
We do not hear much of the Ivy
Lodge of Free Gardeners as an in-
stitution amongst us to-day, but I
came across a description of the
second anniversary of the Lodge. It
was celebrated at the Border Inn,
June 17th, 1868. Great satisfaction
was expressed at the way the dinner
was supplied, and the health of the
host and hostess cordially given.
The Bacchus Marsh Central Com-
mon School Committee again at log-
gerheads, the attainments of the
lad George Anderson, and inferen-
tially the capabilities of the head
teacher, being the basis of disagree-
ment. The Presbyterian section is
unitedly against; the Church of
England section unitedly for the
C. of. E. nominated headmaster. It
makes puerile reading. Adjourned
meetings are held; members threat-
en to resign; and evidently on the
past history of the hamlet, Presby-
terianism and Church of England-
ism were irreconcilable factors, with
the respective pastors prominent.
It is considered worthy of being
specially mentioned in news of the
day, July 4, 186 8, that the large
tree, which stood opposite Mr. Jas.
Young’s (now The Border Store) has
been removed, and has improved the
appearance of the township consid-
erably. That tree, which constituted
such a menace to public safety, was
rightly removed, and Bacchus Marsh
of 1868 heaved a sigh of relief, for
goodness knows how many citizens,
after some social going home in the
early hours of the morning, got
mixed up with that bough, which so
dangerously hung to the ground.
That was in 1868; we are now liv-
ing in 1914. Many handsome speci-
mens now adorn that thoroughfare,
which in 186 8 was in such a primae-
val state. And lo! a danger in 1914


is alleged to assert itself, and it is
callously suggested that such a glor-
ious avenue shuld be ruthlessly laid
low. I venture a forecast that the
woodman will spare the tree, that
when Bacchus Marsh numbers ten-
fold its present population that
noble avenue will still continue a
thing of beauty and a joy forever.
Still scanning through the file of
186 8-6 9. I find the occupation, not
task, most pleasurable. A long re-
port of the opening of Parwan
School, July 6th, 1868. £244 was
outlay, and all items of expenditure
are noted: 23,500 bricks, £29/7/6;
lime, £7/6/; iron bars for windows,
13/6; and so on. Subscriptions
amounted to £IOB/15/6; grant
from Board of Education, £l2 2;
leaving a debt of £l3/4/6. The
success of the movement was due in
a great measure to Mr. Boyle, the
teacher, who was most enterprising
and persevering. Mr. Louis Scott
also came in for great credit; he
took the chair at the opening cere-
mony. The names of certain young
ladies were also mentioned, who
collected funds for the tea —Misses
I. and M. Grant, Miss McDonald,
Miss G. Watson and Miss Kerr. The
subscription list is given—Louis
Scott, £l9; T. Edwards, £5; E.
Toomey, £4/7/6; D. Harboard, £5;
William Watson, £3/10/; R. Green-
well, £3; C. Gumming, £2; C. Gum-
ming, jun., £2; T. Oliver, £5/3/6;
and so on. Mr. James Young spoke
as usual in an informative way,
also addresses from Revs. W. H.
Cooper, J. Scott, and Messrs. Har-
board, J. E. Crook, McNichol, Oliver
and Dr. Bone.
A Coimadai romance: —The resi-
dents of Coimadai have been the
victims of an amusing swindle, at
the hands of a man who was travel-
ling in search of a horse, which he
said had been stolen from him out
of a paddock at the Greenhills, near
Melton. He was an elderly German
and professed to be a vine grower
The farmers and others of Coimadai
sympathised with him in his loss,
and he spent some days with them,
enjoying their hospitality, as he
said he had traced the thief to the
neighbourhood, and was watching
an opportunity to seize him and the
horse. He told a young man named
M’Crae, at whose dwelling he was
residing, that he had seen the mys-
terious thief and horse in the scrub,
and that he would watch him while
his host went into Bacchus Marsh
for a constable. This was agreed
to, and in a short time, Senior-con-
stable Wood and a numerous party
were hunting for the supposed horse
stealer. A great many turned out
to rid the neighbourhood of the
common enemy —farmers even leav-
ing their ploughing. After some
two hours beating about, and nei-
ther thief, horse, nor its real owner
being seen, Constable Wood began
to be suspicious of a hoax. His
companions, however, would not
hear of such a thing; and there
were actually those who had seen
the horse and its captor. Of course,
the constable was unwilling to show
any inclination to shirk what was
thought to be the pursuit of a wrong
doer, and for the whole day the
scrub was thoroughly beaten, but
without the slightest sign of suc-
cess. In the evening, the messenger
of the morning went back to his
hut, and then had the pleasure of
discovering that the old German had
made himself scarce, and the better
to aid his pedestrian labors in
searching for his horse, had taken
a new pair of boots and left his old
ones in exchange !
Wrong-doing not only exemplified
in the person of an old German, but
“The Express,” August Ist, 186 8,
gives a Kyneton journal a nasty
knock that it did “systematically
appropriate our Gisborne news with-
out the slightest acknowledgment,”
a practice which was declared to
have crept into colonial journalism
to an extent which required to be
checked.
News from Myrniong: A ewe gave
birth to five lambs, on the farm of
R. Lawson, Landsberg, near Myrni-
ong. Mr. Muir stated that the
sheep was kept by herself, in an
outbuilding, and that the lambs
were of the usual size.
A very clever piece of poetry,
nearly two columns long, by Mr. W.
Grant, of Hopetoun Mill, on “The
Late Deadlock,” a political crisis
that much convulsed the colony in
the sixties. It was read by Mr.
Grant at the Bacchus Marsh popular


readings, and indeed shows much
poetical versatility. I have to make
this remark, that politicians of the
sixties were singularly earnest in
their principles, and judging by
much correspondence, pro and con,
had a fine grasp of the same. Even
in the elections of the Road Board,
the speeches of Mr. Jeremiah Ryan,
J. Young, and others, make good
reading, and interest in public af-
fairs was such that both sides had
able exponents in the press, in the
form of correspondence.
Mr. Crisp tells me that the dis-
trict in earlier times was largely
Presbyterian. I notice much Pres-
byterian coloring to the news of
those early times. For instance,
here is an item—The prizes offered
by the Rev. J. Meek to the boy and
girl in attendance at the Sabbath
school who could give the best writ-
ten account of the sermon he
preached to them, have been award-
ed by that gentleman to Robert
Kerr, Parwan; and Jessie Anderson,
Lucknow. I presume Robert Kerr
is now Mr. Robert Kerr, of Rows-
ley.
Drought Revives Irrigation Question.
Droughts have not been confined
to 1914. In 1868 not a crop was
reaped in Bacchus Marsh district.
A strong hot wind played havoc
amongst the already suffering crops,
and there fell no rain to revive
them, and the cattle were dying foi
want of grass.
The Bacchus Marsh Popular
Readings keep up their popularity.
The teacher of the Catholic School,
Mr. O’Hara, made a great hit one
particular evening by reciting an
epilogue which he had composed. It
is not to be wondered at that his
son should become one of the fore-
most Australian poets, volumes of
whose songs are now to be found in
the local Mechanics’ Library. Mr.
W. Grant had also composed an
epilogue, in ignorance of the fact
that Mr. O’Hara had already done
so. The comment was that although
Mr. Grant’s production of the kind
Was able, it did not receive so much
applause as that of Mr. O’Hara, the
Pointed allusions of the latter catch-
ing on splendidly. Mr. Con. Mahoney
is reported as having recited, en-
tirely from memory, the whole of
the lengthy speech of Ulysses, while
claiming Achilles’ armour.
Another snake incident. A more
than usually exciting adven-
ture occurred in Bacchus Marsh on
Sunday. The snake was first ob-
served in the yard at the back of
Mr. Heath’s saddler’s shop, from
whence it was seen to take refuge
under the bridge over the gutter,
opposite Mr. Forsyth’s timber-yard.
After considerable poking with a
long batten, the snake was induced
to come out, although he tried to
conceal himself on the top side of
the channel. He was of course
quickly killed, and duly measured,
being something over four feet, and
of the diamond species.
The prospertiy of Bacchus Marsh
is built upon irrigation. Irrigation,
in 186 8, is becoming the topic of the
day. Many are the conversations
held upon the matter. A public
meeting had been held. Quite a
number of people are taking steps
to carry out irrigation for them-
selves. Example had been set by
Messrs. James and McDonald. Mr.
Pearce had ordered a force pump
and other apparatus. So had Messrs
Dawson and Le Couteur. The re-
sult of this enterprise was closely
watched. The Coimadai scheme
survey was being completed. It cost
a lot, and has been held up ever
since. The Irrigation Committee
appointed by public meeting (Messrs
P. Boyd, Paterson, Young, Connell,
Ryan, Harboard and Crook) had duly
investigated schemes. Mr. Crook
was in favor of Werribee scheme;
Mr. Ryan, of Werribeee and Ler
derderg schemes; Mr. Young was
afraid Werribee would not give
what was wanted. Mr. Hugh Meikle,
writing from “Meikleriggs” gets to
business in a letter to “Express.”
He would build a dam in Werribee
Gorge, consisting of 1500 perches of
masonry, which would raise a dam
100 feet high. He would place a
sluice at bottom, and another 50ft.
higher up. This should irrigate
5,000 acres; cost of outlay, £5,250.
Mr. Meikle proposed by this to
water both sides of the Weribbee,
the Racecourse, and all under it,
Lyle’s Creek, as far as D. Robert-
son’s, Stamford Hill, and the whole
of the Marsh. “The Australasian”


has a lengthy article that Bacchus
Marsh should undertake irrigation.
Mr. A. G. Scott (Captain Moonlight)
enters into controversy, and delivers
a lecture on Hydrostatics and Hy-
draulics. It must have been an
interesting effort. He traced con-
struction of waterworks historically.
One of the aqueducts of ancient
Rome was carried on 7 000 arches,
some of them 100 feet high. In
Peru, water had been carried 360
miles to irrigate a place smaller
than Bacchus Marsh. The proposed
schemes for Bacchus Marsh were
referred to. Mr. Scott found that
the watershed of the Coimadai
scheme was set down at 12,000
acres, and the average rainfall at 2 9
inches. He did not believe that
amount would be obtained. Even
presuming that there was 29 Inches
rainfall at Coimadai, and one-third
of it could be stored, the loss from
evaporation and filtration in forty
miles of main channel would be so
great that in the end there would
scarcely be enough water to drink.
It would be difficult, the lecturer
declared, to get good clay for a dam
on the Lerderderg nearer than one
mile from the spot, and suitable
stone was not at hand for a weir.
He favoured the Werribee Gorge
scheme. Mr. Harboard, Engineer,
was of the strong opinion that for
storage of water, the capacity of the
Gorge would be insufficient, and
many local irrigation experts seemed
wedded to the Gorge, but Mr. Har-
board was firm. He honestly be-
lieved that there was no place so
suitable for a dam as Pyke’s Flat,
or one where a reservoir could be
more cheaply made, compared with
the area irrigated. He was decided-
ly of opinion that they would never
be able to store water on the Ler-
derderg, owing to silt filling the
dam, but he would advise that some
assistance be got from the river.
Meeting after meeting held on irri-
gation. Mr. Crisp gives after his-
tory. A scheme by Mr. Wrixon,
Government Engineer, next takes
up attention. He first recommended
Rowsley, and then Pyke’s Creek.
The matter drifted on, and it was
only quite recently that the latter
storage was adopted. The late Sir
Thomas Bent authorised it, with a
view of irrigating the Werribee
Park estate, which the Government
had bought, and it was not carried
out till Mr. Elwood Mead arrived —
the first job given him. What had
proved subversive to all the early
schemes was local rating, which was
strongly objected to.
Dec. 5, 186 8. Deemed of public
interest —Hares have been seen by
two gentlemen, at different times in
the Ironbark Ranges, near Bacchus
Marsh, and it is believed that spar-
rows are in the township.
Establishment of Hibernian Soci-
ety, 2 3rd Feb., 1869, in Bacchus
Marsh. Title —■ Bacchus Marsh
Branch, No. 4, of the Ballarat Hi-
bernian Society. It was opened by
Mr. Mark Young, President of the
Directory; Mr. Francis Byrnes, Vice-
President ; Mr. Michael Deegan, Sec.;
and Mr. Fahey, Warden of Moora-
bool Branch p who attended in re-
galia. The object of the Society was
stated that it was for the reason
that Roman Catholics desired to
meet socially and commune with
each other. “It is for this reason,
and not through any motive of bigo-
try, that the Ballarat Hibernian So-
ciety consists exclusively of Roman
Catholics.” The following were
unanimously elected : —Mr. Michael
Connell, President ; Mr. P. O’Hagau,
Vice-President ; Mr. T. Cain, jun.,
Treasurer ; Mr. J. F. Taylor, Secre-
tary ; Mr. Martin Cain, Warden ; Mr.
William Mahon, Guardian.
Cricket in April, 1869. A cricket
match was played at Maddingley,
near Bacchus Marsh, between eleven
World players and sixteen Colonial
players, selected from the members
of the Bacchus Marsh Cricket Club.
The former won with nine wickets
to spare. I am at a loss to under-
stand what is meant by “World”
players.
A drought has occurred in IS 14.
There must have been a very serious
one in 1869. I find in the news of
the day that Friday, April Bth, 1869,
was observed as a close holiday in
Bacchus Marsh, on account of it
being proclaimed a day of humilia-
tion and prayer for a cessation of
the drought. Have we got to-day
too non-religious, or too irreligious,
to adopt such procedure in connec-
tion with the abolition of a time of


scarcity ?
Some indications of denomina-
tional unity—On Easter Monday the
scholars of the Trinity Church Sun-
day school, and those of the Presby-
terian Sunday school, were enter-
tained by the Rev. Mr. Cooper, on
Maddingley Flat. This Rev. Mr.
Cooper is later on to become Bishop
Cooper.
April 10, 1869. Our readers will
regret to hear that on Saturday last
Mr. Robert Lawson, of Landsberg
House, Myrniong, while on his voy-
age to Melbourne in the “Great
Britain,” jumped overboard and was
drowned. Mr. Lawson was an old
colonist, and one of the earliest
principals of Scotch College, Eastern
Hill. He was highly respected in
the district, held office as J.P., and
was for a time chairman of the Road
Board. He was liberal in promoting
any object for the general good, and
a generous landlord. His mind must
have been deranged when he jumped
overboard, and his conduct prior to
and since his departure for England
had been very strange.
Public conveniences are increasing
in the Marsh. The stay of a Hair-
dresser in Bacchus Marsh was stated
to be a convenience to the many
hairy Esaus that abounded on the
Marsh. The barber announced that
he would be found at the Courthouse
hotel, thus the historic start of the
barber in our midst, April 17th,
1869.
The virtues of irrigation. Irriga-
tion meetings have been held in
galore, and in a preceding article 1
epitomised the agitation. But a
short expressive letter appears in
“Express.” Sir,—-Anent irrigation,
I am not quite mad on that subject,
yet like fair play, consequently beg
your acceptance of two heads of cab-
bage (Enfield market) combined with
that of my horticultural tutelar,
Saint Parkinson, of the Melton bone
mill, and stable manure in unlimited
quantity. The cabbages are of 2
months and 19 days growth since
planting out. Yours truly, Tom
Kissock. An editorial note to same:
The cabbages referred to were very
fine, being large, free from blight,
and remarkably tender, owing to
rapid growth. Mr. Kissock, we be-
lieve, holds the opinion that the
farmers in Bacchus Marsh should
lay down their lands in lucerne and
prairie grass, for dairying purposes,
instead of spending money on irri-
gation.
The start of bikes.—May 29, 186 9.
“We may shortly expect to see veloc-
ipedes in Bacchus Marsh, as they
are being made in all parts of the
colony. The latest idea is a single
wheeled machine. The rider sits in-
side the wheel. Nearly every maker
exercises his own ingenuity to render
propulsion as easy as possible, and
one has hit upon a device whereby
the hands can be used instead of the
legs. This is a vast improvement
we should imagine.” The term
velocipede, so familiar many years
ago, appears to have gone out with
those big and small wheelers. In
186 9 there was no idea that propul-
sion as easy as possible would be
consummated in the invention of
the motor bike, but as for the device
of the man sitting inside the wheel
has yet to come to light.
I have commented already upon
that tip-top way inhabitants of
the Basin had of firing away at one
another in those early times, and I
have come across I don’t know how
many protests by minorities against
what the majorities had carried. It
had got to such an acute stage that
on July 3rd, 1869, the leading ar-
ticle of the “Express” opens—“lf
ever the name of Bacchus Marsh
should be changed—and a new power
has been put in the Land Bill to en-
able the Governor-in-Council to
change the name of any place—the
township should be called Wrang-
lers’ Valley, for really for the size
of the place it has not its equal foi'
fomenting quarrels, and the power
of attracting notice to them. Not
content with two local papers in
which to vaporise the fermenting
elements of discord, we find the
Melbourne journals occasionally
drawn in to afford a vent for the ex-
cited feelings of some one or other
of the several sections into which
our community has been said to be
divided.” The dissension this time
was over the alleged ritualistic prac-
tices of the Church of England in-
cumbent, and bitter was the contro-
versy. The Rev. W. H. Cooper fell
foul of some of his vestry and par-


ishioners. The leading article is
a neat bit of work. It appears that
the Dean of Melbourne, in a visit
to the parish, had ripped off some
crosses from the bookmarkers which,
by the way, does not seem to have
been a very indictable offence, (that
is, the use of crosses) and a mono-
gram from the altar cloth which he
had burned. The article reads well.
A paragraph thus : —"Another Mel-
bourne paper, ever ready to pounce
upon the slightest topic of a com-
bustible character, in order to get a
light for its literary fireworks, came
out on Wednesday with a leading
article, placing everything in the
plural number. Churches were in-
vaded, monograms torn from the
altar cloths, and the Diocesan hymn-
book flourished over the heads of
the astonished congregation. To
parody the article—This may all be
very well, and speaks volumes for
the ability of the writer in the
"Telegraph” to manufacture one of
those delicious morsels for break-
fast table readers —a newspaper scan-
dal —but upon cool reflection does he
think his zeal entirely according to
his knowledge ? Most probably he
will not give a second thought to
the subject, but we can tell him
that his knowledge is very far from
being based upon the actual state of
affairs at the Marsh.” The "Express”
sums up—"lt is really ludicrous to
see so much made of the paltry
squabbles of a congregation, some
100 in number, whose church is com-
posed of two corrugated iron bed-
rooms placed together, with a gum
tr ee for a steeple whereupon to fix
the church-going bell.” Evidently
with this the ritualistic controversy
died out.
The first apppearance of a bicycle
in Bacchus Marsh, August 21, 1869
—not called bicycles then, but veloc-
ipedes, Master Robert Reid has the
honor of being the first rider of the
bicycles who has appeared before the
Bacchus Marsh public. The veloc-
ipede was made at Mr. James Reid’s
establishment. Mr. Carlton has
also manufactured a bicycle, but he
has not had time to acquire such
skill and dexterity in using it as
Robert Reid has. There is some
talk of a Caledonian Gathering at
Maddingley on 9th Nov. next, and
a prize will most likely be offered
for a velocipede race.
Mr. Peter Inglis, founder of Ing-
liston, dies, and property is sworn
at £70,000. Highly eulogistic sketch
of career of deceased. "To his two
sons he had left a better possession
than even the Inheritance of ample
wealth —the heritage of an unsullied
life and an honored name.”
One is rather struck with the
straightout comments of the Press
of the sixties. There was no gloved
hand business, but knocks were
given with bare knuckles. The local
"Guardian” and "Express” must
have made excellent reading, as in
the most candid way they summed
up one another’s gentle foibles.
The candid characteristic even en-
tered into appreciation.
Mr. James Young, who has occu-
pied such a prominence in the life
of the community, is the subject of
a most favorable paragraph:
"We believe him to be a man of
more than ordinary ability, and
fitted in many respects to take a
lead in public affairs, and willing
to assist his neighbors at his own
loss and inconvenience, but (now for
the straight speaking) he has des-
ired to take too absolute a lead in
the district, and is responsible for
the existence of very much of the
bitter sectarian and national feelings
which crop up in all public matters
in the district.” The paragraph con-
cludes with some wholesome counsel:
"With the advice to Mr, Young not
to neglect his own affairs in the
future for the sake of what he con-
siders the public good, we wish him
all success in his new location.”
Dec. 4, 1869. A natural curiosity.
A curious bird’s nest has been shown
us, which is largely made up of
pieces of wire thrown off the bot-
tles used by the Coimadai Mineral
Water Company. The bird which
selected this singular material, in
lieu of the ordinary twigs/ is known
as a Mina, and considerable force
appears to have been used in twist-
ing the wires around the branch
upon which the nest is fixed.
Dec. 6th, 186 9. A great day for
local Anglicans. The Right Rev-
erend Bishop Perry laid the foun-
dation stone of the Holy Trinity
Church. The scroll deposited in a


jar placed under the stone read as
follows: —The Foundation stone of
the Church of England, called Trin-
ity (mark, not Holy Trinity) situate
at Bacchus Marsh, in the colony of
Victoria, was laid on Monday, by
the Right Rev. Father in God,
Charles First, Lord Bishop of Mel-
bourne, and in thirty-third year of
our Most Gracious Majesty, Queen
Victoria, Sir H. T. Manners Sutton,
Governor of said colony. Officiating
minister —Rev. John Garlick. Trus-
tees —James Elijah Crook, John
Saunders, George Wood. Church
Wardens — James Elijah Crook, A.
Charles Simon. John C. McCaus-
land, Hon. Sec. and Treasurer. Arch-
itect, Floyd Taylor. In jar were
also placed, among other things, a
half sovereign, shilling, sixpence,
fourpence, threepence, and one
penny. At night, the Bishop de-
livered a lecture in the Central
school, but there was much discom-
fort as room was insufferably warm,
owing to defective ventilation. There
were windows, but the peculiarity
was that they were never made to
open!
I make some extracts from the
Bishop’s lecture. He compared the
position of the colony in 1851 with
what it was in 1869. In 1851, the
population was 80,000. He detailed
the localities which were populated,
including Bacchus Marsh, that is
Bacchus Marsh is hoary with antiq-
uity. In 1851 the Church of Eng-
land had six churches, six parson-
ages, and sixteen clergymen. The
population, 1869, was 700,000. The
Church of England churches had in-
creased to 180, the clergymen to 120,
and the parsonages 70. Above all,
the Bishop declared, without flattery,
that the colony had a population
that would compare with any for in-
telligence and industry, and speak-
ing in comparison with some, a
sober, moral and religious people.
The whole audience, who belonged
to the population, applauded. The
cause of the advancement was the
discovery of gold. The Bishop re-
membered his Archdeacon lamenting
the influx of a gold-seeking popula-
tion as a misfortune. He (the Bis-
hop) argued that it should be re-
garded as a providential discovery,
and he failed to see that it was a
judgment against the colony. For
a time events were rather what he
anticipated, not what he hoped. It
was a complete upturning of society.
The Bishop had walked through
Melbourne during the height of the
first excitement, and scarcely saw
a score of able bodied men, and of
these many were engaged packing
up drays for diggers. The excesses
of the diggers who returned. The
new Governor, Mr. La Trobe, nar-
rowly escaped being stuck up. He
remembered a man being shot at
Prince’s Bridge. A vessel in Hob-
son’s Bay was robbed of its gold.
Population poured in during all
1852, He remembered a gentleman
calling upon him who said he had
brought out a landing net, with
which to fish the gold out of the
streams! All necessaries of life were
very dear. Canvas town sprang up;
it was like a military encampment,
without its orderliness. The lecture
was interesting throughout.
Dec. 11, 1869. “The Coimadai
Mineral Company are busily engaged
in supplying Melbourne and Balla-
rat with the water from the spring
at Coimadai.” And to-day those that
are interested in the development
of the district might well ask —Are
not the waters of Coimadai of as
great value as the mineral waters
of Germany, which obtain such a
ready sale in the State? But there
has been the craze —“Made in Ger-
many,” but now !s the opportune
time for Coimadai to raise its voice
on behalf of its lime springs.
An item appears Dec. 2 4th, 1869.
The Border flour mill, Bacchus
Marsh, lately belonging to Mr. Jas.
Young, was bought at auction in
Melbourne by Messrs. W. and H.
G. Grant, of Hopetoun mill, Bacchus
Marsh. The competition was brisk
between the purchasers and Messrs.
Anderson & Edward Richardson.
The reserve price was, we under-
stand, £1,620. Mr. W. Anderson,
the present tenant of the store fac-
ing the mill, bought that property,
including a wooden dwelling house
adjoining, for £6 00; this is exclus-
ive of the fittings. Both properties
are considered to have realised full
value. The mill is not likely to be
used for corn grinding this season,
if ever again, as it is much out of


repair. It will probably be used as
a store house in the meantime, and
eventually may be turned into a
malting house.
Dec. 24, 1869. The break-up of
Central Common School. Prize for
the best conducted boy in school
awarded by the scholars —Ebenezer
Pearce, and it might, without fear
of contradiction, be asserted that
Mr. Ebenezer Pearce ever since has
not been a riotous boy. I don’t
mind telling the reader in strictest
confidence, that reading over the
“Express” files I have come across
one or two spicey episodes in which
some who have occupied public posi-
tions in the community were in-
volved ; I have refrained from notic-
ing same ; but at same time I must
state that I do not find any record
that ever they were awarded prizes
at a Sunday School !
I come across, in 186 9, the first
report of a cricket match, presum-
ably the days when underhand bowl-
ing was the form of trundling. The
first English cricketers, to the Colony
appeared on the ground in belltop-
pers. The match in question was
between Melton and the Marsh. The
Marsh won easily. Of the local
cricketers who played, three names
only now appear familiar —Murphy,
Grant and Simpson.
A snake adventure. In December,
Mr. Lyle was engaged reaping his
crop with a pair-horse machine,
when the horses were set off into a
terrified gallop by an immense snake
passing between their legs. Mr.
Lyle was capsized and lay insensible
for some minutes. In the meantime
the horses broke the. main cogwheel
of the machine, and were in full
career towards the precipitous bank
of the river Werribee, where, if
they had tumbled over, they would
have immediately been killed, when
they were stopped by one of the
men employed on the place. The
snake had been seen for two or
three years, and was at least over
six feet in length.
The last of the Deep Creek Toll
Gate, January 15, 1870. Editorial
comment —“We are glad to notice
that Mr. J. E. Crook has received
instructions to sell the toil house
and gates at Djerriwarrh Creek on
27th inst.”
The search for goxd continues. Mr.
Greeves, a miner of Cockatoo Gully,
found a piece of quartz very rich
with gold. The specimen was
three-cornered, not at all water-
worn, and all the diggers of the lo-
cality are of the opinion that a
quartz reef was near by. Apparently
Bacchus Marsh district is not a gold-
field, if we judge by the lack of
prospecting to-day, but in the six-
ties there was much confidence ex-
pressed that gold was to be found
locally. The geological expert, Mr.
Brough Smyth, a Government offi-
cial, made a report on the possi-
bilities in regard to gold deposits,
but it was declared to be very
guarded. The Marsh in prehistoric
or ancient times was the scene of
the loosing and devastating action of
vast volumes of water. Therefore
if minerals of greatest specific gra-
vity be found after the action of
tumultuous torrents and currents of
water in the hollows and channels
most deeply furrowed in the rocky
beds of valleys down in the lower
strata of the Marsh, gold should be
found. Such evidently was the rea-
sonirig, but a critic on Mr. Brough
Smyth’s report held that gentleman
somewhat halted between two ©pin-
ions. I give the critic’s rendering
of the report “You might find
gold—and thank me for my advice —
but then again you might not —so
the least said is soonest mended.”
Mr. Daintree, geologist, who spent
many months at Bacchus Marsh, was
of the opinion that an auriferous
drift extended from the gorge of the
Werribee to Bacchus Marsh proper,
and there was no reason why pay-
able gold should not be found in
the Marsh itself ; the pick of the
digger could alone decide that, but
all the geological conditions were
there. The question is whether lu-
cerne as the top dressing is not the
most effective type of gold mine.
You might well express the regular-
ity and consistent value of lucerne
hay return as so many ounces per
ton. A lode, never mind how pay-
able, must sooner or later be ex-
hausted, but the returns from lu-
cerne are intensifying year by year
to the district, and it is possible
that some day the owner of the
most insignificent holding will re-


gard it as suicidal if every square
inch is not placed under cultivation.
Gold mining is always accompanied
py a certain amount of devastation
to the surface, and it is desirable
that Mr. Brough Smyth’s guarded
report should be ever accepted by
the community. There may or may
not be deposits of gold away down
below the abnormally fertile drift
stratum. At present the Marsh is
a gold mine in its natural produc-
tivity, which cannot be improved
upon. Leave well alone. The face
of the ranges abutting on the valley
of the Marsh and tributaries have
been narrowly searched for indica-
tions of the outcrop of the denuded
edge of ancient beds of wash dirt
traversing the elevated plateaux
around the Marsh, but those aban-
doned shafts and tunnels prove that
the geologist is only dealing with
Hypothesis when he asserts that all
the geological conditions are here
for the discovery of gold.
Stray blacks yet visit the com-
munity. An aboriginal couple were
charged before C. Shuter, Esq., P.M.,
with being drunk and disorderly.
They belonged to the Buninyong
tribe, and had come to Bacchus
Marsh to obtain blankets, supplied
by the Government. They were dis-
charged, being cautioned that there
must be no repetition of offence.
Land values in 1870. It is an-
nounced that Mr. J. E. Crook sold
nine acres of land belonging to
Mr. Henry Worthy, and close to the
township of Bacchus Marsh, for £l4
per acre. The purchaser was Mr.
Nagle, an owner of adjoining land.
A man, Michael Playes, inflicted
injury upon the Messrs. T. and M.
Cain by burning maliciously about
£IOOO worth of their property. He
deliberately set fire to haystacks.
The “Argus” commented, “The only
motive assignable by the Commis-
sion of the crime was revenge—re-
venge, not for injuries inflicted, but
for benefits received. The eccentric-
ities of crime are beyond calcula-
tion.” The accused was convicted,
and received a sentence of five
years’ hard labor.
A long report is given to
the opening of the Presbyterian
Church, Parwan, May 14th, 1870.
The report opens picturesquely. This
place of worship is a brick building,
with cement quoins and mouldings,
and shingled roof, standing in a
pleasant undulating piece of coun-
try, known as the Yale of Parwan.
Dimensions are given ; internal fit-
ting also. Total cost, £4OO. Mem-
bers of Committee Messrs. P.
Boyd (Sec.), J. Brown (Treasurer),
P. and W. Alexander, J. Watson,
C. Gumming and J. McCrae. The
first two were credited with having-
borne the burden of work, Mr.
Brown specially mentioned as hav-
ing been most enthusiastic and gen-
erous in the matter, his contribu-
tions in labor and money reaching
some £4O.
Snake data : —The body of a very
large snake was brought to our
office last week by Mr. Joseph Gul-
liver, of Coimadai. It was a black
snake, and measured eleven feet. It
was found dead in an old mining
shaft, at Goodman’s creek. Mr. Gul-
liver has sent the snake to Mel-
bourne. Probably Professor McCoy
will get hold of it.
Mr. James Elijah Crook's inter-
ests and activities are diversified.
He is a moving spirit in church
and educational matters ; is to the
fore in any movement or institu-
tion that affects the progress of the
town in material affairs, and the
“Express” of June 4, 1870, spec-
ially notes the performance of Mr.
Crook’s racehorse, Saladin. Mr.
Crook must have been a particularly
all round citizen. Saladin ran at
the Caulfield races on the previous
Saturday, and was made a hot fav-
ourite for the Prahran Handicap,
for which he came second, owing to'
the bad riding of the jockey named
Kerr. Great disappointment was
felt, but Saladin won the Consola-
tion stakes with Enderson up. I
turn to November’s file of same
year and find that on Derby Day
Mr. Crook’s horses, Saladin and
Prince Douna, are recorded to have
run well ; but in Melbourne Cup
Saladin, the Bacchus Marsh horse,
did not show in the race.”
It is rather peculiar that as I
have written thus about Mr. J. E.
Crook, a book, “Recollections of a
Victorian Police Officer,” by John
Sadler, former Inspector Super-
intendent of Police, should be put


in my hands, and Host Crook, of
the Woolpack, comes in for special
mention. The author had just
joined the police cadets, that is in
1852, and when the training was
complete the whole detachment was
drafted to Ballarat. I extract the
following :—“Our provisions on the
march were plentiful bu- very rough.
The fact is there was not a single
bushman amongst us, and our cook-
ing was not a success. Crook, the
landlord of the Woolpack Inn, at
Bacchus Marsh, heard of our ap-
proach and prepared a royal feast
for us. Fowls, joints, green peas,
puddings and other dainties such as
none of us had tasted since leaving
“Home” were provided, for which
the good old man had our thanks.
It was reward enough for him that
he was able to entertain those who
were in the services of the Queen,
and to see them enjoy his hospital-
ity. Our Commandant showed how
well he could refrain from over-in-
dulgence when on duty, and drank
very moderately of the liquor our
host provided. The Woolpack Inn
is now but a memory, though it is
not many years since I saw portions
of the main building still standing.”
In “Express” of June 4, 1870,
Mr. Lawrence Dugdale informs us —
so the paragraph reads—that his
old favorite cow, Lily Jones, had
again had two calves, making the
increase of four in eleven months,
all of which, together with the cow,
were doing well. Where was Mr.
Grant, of Hopetoun mill, that he
did not', like Robbie Burns, sing the
fame of the cow (in this instance)
“Wha multiplies the number ? .
“Let other heroes boast their scars
The marks of sturt and strife;
And other poets sing of war
The plague of human life ;
Shame fa’ the fun, wi’ sword and
gun
To slap mankind like lumber
I sing his name and nobler fame
Wha’ multiplies our number.”
Bacchus Marsh of 1870 was ahead
of Bacchus Marsh of 1915, in one
respect. It had an excellent drama-
tic society, and plays like “Othello”
were essayed, and comedy also was
introduced. Mr. Wilson, the head
teacher of the Central School, must
have had histrionic gifts, while
special mention is made more than
once of the way In which Master
Bowser sustained his reputation for
playing female parts. He was par-
ticularly successful in “Mrs. Squif-
fem,” whoever that lady may be. I
am not in a position to state
whether Master Bowser was the pre-
sent Member of Parliament, or a
brother. Master Bowser also ex-
celled as a comic singer. The crit-
icism reads : “With clear conscience
we can set it down that Master
Bowser bewildered and delighted the
audience by his singing, in character
as a female, a comic song, the name
of which we cannot give, but it was
wittier than such compositions usu-
ally are. His manner of doing this
was all but inimitable, both in man-
ner and deportment.” As Othello,
the critic says that Mr. Gell, soiic-
itor, had a noble presence, and trod
the stage well. I am afraid that
to-day Othello would locally bring
a poor house, even if we had some
dramatic celebrity with noble pres-
ence, and one who could tread the
stage well. My friend, Mr. J. Mac-
Lachlan, of such musical capability,
will not misunderstand me when I
say that Othello has to give way to
something much lighter to secure a
good house. But the world changes,
and an age which is supposed to be
the survival of the fittest cannot for
one moment enjoy, and be profited
by, those masterly creations of a
Shakespeare, which were the delight
of our forefathers. The informative
lecture, too, has also become a back
number. If Mr. Wilson, schoolmas-
ter, somehow could reappear with
his Othello company of local artists,
the takings would hardly pay ex-
penses. There must have been a
boom in the amateur dramatic busi-
ness in the early days. At a later
dramatic performance twenty local
actors took part, and the stage actu-
ally had a proscenium. I pick out
one little “mention”:—“The two
young ladies in the piece were re-
presented by Masters Bowser and
Frank Crook, and very ladylike they
both looked, which was all that was
about required of them.” I presume
Master Frank Crook is the said Mr.
Francis H. Crook, Secretary of Me-
chanics’ Institute, and local Clerk


of Courts.
Newspaper war at the Marsh —■
“Guardian” and another versus
“The Express”; that is, James Wal-
ter Swords, Editor and proprietor of
“Guardian,” and Patrick Kelly
O’Hara, versus Crisp & Lane, of the
“Express.” The notification of same
is characterised in issue of “Ex-
press,” July 9th, 1870. “Messrs.
James Walter Swords and Patrick
Kelly O’Hara have served writs upon
the proprietors of this paper for
£l5O damages each, for an alleged
libel, contained in our issue of the
2 3rd April last, in reference to elec-
toral matters. We intend to defend
both actions to the last shot in the
locker. To assist us we have to re-
quest that all persons owing money
to the proprietors of this paper will
endeavor to pay same at once.”
The cases were heard before his
Honor, Judge Skinner, in Bacchus
Marsh County Court on the 27th
inst. The following jury were em-
panelled : Messrs. James Muir (fore-
man), J. Brown, P. Cain and Robert
Frame. The evidence takes up five
columns of “Express.” Mr. Gell
appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr.
Mclesworth (afterwards Justice Mol-
csworth) for the defendants. The
evidence makes interesting reading.
Our old friend, Mr. Thomas Heath,
was called as a witness. The Judge
having summed up, the jury retired,
and after an absence of a few min-
utes, returned into the Court with a
verdict for defendants, the foreman
observing that the decision was
unanimous. The verdict was re-
corded with £l6/14/ costs. I should
have mentioned that the action
brought by Mr. P. K. O’Hara,
against defendants, was taken sep-
arately, but after a conversation be-
tween legal gentlemen, the case was
withdrawn, on the defendants agree-
ing to a verdict of one shilling, and
£lO costs, and stating that they did
not intend to attribute anything
criminal to Mr. O’Hara.
The history of a community is
Written in the biography of its in-
habitants. Leahy’s hotel, in the
early days, was one of the landmarks
of the district. In “Express” of
August 13th, 1870, I find a sketch
of the life of Mr. John Leahy, who
arrived in the Marsh some twenty
five years previously—that is, about
1845. The biography is as follows :
The late Mr. John Leahy, who died
at Bullengarook, near Bacchus
Marsh, on Tuesday, 2nd inst., was
one of those men frequently met
with in this colony, who, although
dying comparatively young, have yet
outlived their day and generation.
The deceased at one time took a
very active part in all local matters.
He was liberal in the extreme to all
and sundry, and particularly to every
purpose connected with the Roman
Catholic Church and school here.
He was the donor of the two acres
of land upon which the old church
stands ; and in the churchyard sur-
rounding that building he was bur-
ied. His funeral was one of the
largest seen in Bacchus Marsh, ex-
tending about one-third of a mile
in length. The deceased contributed
something like half to the old
chapel, and also subscribed a por-
tion of the sum of £4OO now in
the bank at Bacchus Marsh towards
erecting a new place of worship for
the denomination to which he be-
longed. His subscriptions to school
purposes were likewise liberal and
constant; indeed up to within a very
recent period his house was the resi-
dence of the Roman Catholic school-
masters, stationed from time to
time in Bacchus Marsh, and he like-
wise extended his hospitality to the
clergy, whenever they chose to avail
themselves of it. He rented and
owned a considerable quantity of
land, some of it belonging to Lady
Franklin, which has now passed into
other hands. He was largely inter-
ested ip the erection of Hopetoun
mill, and, truth to say, he acted
foolishly in refusing some good of-
fers to rent or purchase that mill.
However, it is easier to be wise after
the event; and while it is a matter
of regret that Mr. Leahy did not
leave his family even a tithe of the
wealth he at one time possessed, it
must be pleasing to them to know
that he lived so as to deserve and
receive the respect of a very "vide
circle of acquaintances, and the tid-
ings of his death will be universally
received with a regretful remem-
brance of his many good qualities
He was a native of the town of
Tipperary.”


Sept. 3, 1870, a long article, and
capable, on the war which had
broken out appears. I am struck
with the conditions as existed then,
as regards communications with the
outside world. I extract this from
article : “The outbreak of war
was so recent when the mail which
has just arrived was despatched that
we have little knowledge as to the
attitude of Austria, Italy, Belgium,
America, &c. We hope that the
next news received will show that
the war has ended.” That is, months
would intervene before any know-
ledge of the progress of the war
would be received. To-day, we have
cablegram and wireless telegraphy
that give us almost momentarily de-
velopments of events. Further, the
mail was not called the “Suez”
mail, but the Panama. In those
days Mr. Crisp wrote lengthy art-
icles. Indeed, in particular issue in
question, there are a leader and a
sub-leader of sustained argument.
To-day Mr. Crisp elects to give us
homoeopathic doses of concentrated
essence of thought, and highly epi-
grammatic. I am curious to know
what was the editorial attitude in
regard to the war. The same atti-
tude to-day could not be taken, or
‘‘The Express” office would soon be
a mass of ruins. But the article
faithfully reflected British opinion
of the time. I reproduce : —‘‘At pre-
sent the home country is neutral,
but should it be drawn into the con-
flict, it will be on behalf of Prussia,
we have little doubt. The latter
nation has not been thoroughly pop-
ular among Britishers on account of
its treatment of Denmark. (Of
course reference is made to the war
in which Prussia and Austria united
to down a feeble little country like
Denmark, for the sake of ac-
quisition of Schleswig-Holstein
where now Kiel Canal stands.) But
on the other hand the late cordiality
with France has been somewhat in-
sincere, and seeing the present war
has been wantonly commended by
Napoleon, we hold that. Prussia is
entitled to the sympathy of Britain
in the present struggle.” The en-
tente with France had not yet then
come into being. Prance was re-
garded as the hereditary enemy of
the British, but Prussia was even
then working up that militarism,
which in our day has caused Europe
to be the scene of such horrible
carnage. The concluding portion of
article is a side light as to the pos-
sibilities of defence by the colony,
should the mother country become
involved in war : —“A system of de-
fence has been partially commenced
in the colony, and we cannot there-
fore throw ourselves on the generos-
ity of any foe on the plea of utter
defencelessness, which plea indeed
might be of very little avail. We
hear that it is proposed to rely upon
the present police force as our ‘reg-
ular army,’ and probably the men
will be instructed in military prac-
tice, as the large guns in the colony
at present are undergoing altera-
tions to make them as effective as
possible. It is thought that torpe-
does will be used to guard the en-
trance to the Bay until the armour-
plated Cerberus arrives, which is
now on its journey out, or nearly so.
The Volunteer Force will also be re-
organised, and should the next in-
telligence from Europe show that
England has joined the war, we
may expect that a militia force will
be called into existence in this col-
ony.” The notable Cerberus in time
arrived, but at present she is only
so much scrap-iron, but we have
the Australian fleet of powerful ves-
sels, one to gain immortal glory by
smashing up the notorious raider
Em den, while on land there has de-
veloped a defence which aims short
at nothing but that 100,000 Aus-
tralians, fully equipped with horse
and ordnance, shall be fighting the
battles of the Empire on European
soil.
1914. —War and drought. 1870 —■
War and flood. The most disastrous
flood that had occurred in Bacchus
Marsh district, for at least 10 years
previously, visited the locality on
Thursday, Sept. Bth, 1870. Such is
the beginning of a long leader, giv-
ing flood description. Three miles
up Ballarat road, from Anthony’s
Cutting, was a sea. The part of
bank of Werribee river, through
which waters had escaped at pre-
vious flood, had been dammed up,
and the bed of the river had subse-
quently widened. The township felt
a certain amount of assurance that


in consequence all would ever be
safe. But from the said breach
water was seen to be issuing, and
in increasing volume. It came
through the paddock of Mr. Grant,
of Millbank, and meeting with a
check in Maddingley road, the
stream divided. One branch dashed
across the paddock on the other side
through a blind gully. The other
came down the west side of Mad-
dingley road, and made its appear-
ance at the rear of the Courthouse,
Bank, Border Inn, and Border Mill,
where it overflowed the ordinary
channels, and spread across the road.
Bacchus Marsh inhabitants were sud-
denly transformed into “navigators,”
some clearing a passage for the
flood waters, and others erecting
banks to prevent entry into house-
hold. Mr. Thos. Heath’s property
is specially mentioned as having suf-
fered on account of low situation,
the water being two feet deep, and
flowing over the road 12 inches
deep. The article goes into most
elaborate detail. Mr. Pearce was
reported as having made provision
as a likely sufferer in case of flood.
He had built a dam against any
depredation of the Werribee, and
forewarned was in his case fore-
armed. He only suffered in conse-
quence moderately. That was the
Marsh in flood time of 1870. 45
years have passed. The bed of the
Werribee has deepened, and Pyke’s
Creek Reservoir impounds much
flood waters, but the recent thunder
storm was proof when the street was
a banker that the municipality needs
some initiative in its Councillors to
prevent its main thoroughfare again
becoming a turbulent torrent.
Mr. T. Fairbain, of Pentland
Hills, had some sheep stolen, and a
prosecution followed. The literary
attainment of a witness named
McDermott caused no little amuse-
ment. McDermott was Mr. Fair-
bairn’s shepherd. He swore posi-
tively as to the identity of a pair
of dirty looking fleeces, which to-
gether with the sheep they had
covered, formed the subject of the
criminal prosecution, and he had
no doubt at all about the capital T.
with which they had been branded.
The lawyer for defence was not
Quite so sure about this, and after
having provided the witness with
the requisite stationery, asked him
to sketch the letter T. With all
native modesty, the Hibernian Mac-
Dermott blushingly declined the in-
vitation, and upon being pressed
closely, confessed that neither read-
ing nor writing had been a part of
his education. Slightly annoyed at
the laughter which his answer elic-
ited, he said he could not do much
with his pen, but-—suiting the action
to the word —he could make as good
a T as anyone in the Court if he
only had the brand ! This was a
little too much for the gravity of
the bench, and it was not without
some difficulty the laughter in the
court subsided. The accused was
found not guilty by the jury, on ac-
count of “McDermott's inconclu-
sive evidence.”
“The Express” speaks, Nov. sth,
1870. “Bacchus Marsh (as the
township used to be called) will
soon deserve the first part of the
name, even if the latter remains to
some extent a misnomer, for we are
to have another hotel, to afford ac-
commodation to the devotees of the
God Bacchus, who cannot get their
needs supplied at the four hotels or
beershops at present existing with-
in half-a-mile of the Courthouse.
The new building is now being
erected next to shop occupied by
Mr. Heath, and it is to be tenanted
by Mr. McNamara.” Presumably, in
1870, the temperature, in spite of
flood, often stood over 100 in the
shade, and created a general thirst
that the said four hotels were not
able to accommodate.
Mechanics’ Institute’s balance
sheet, for 1870, does not compare
with that of 1914. In the latter there
is a clear balance of £l2O odd, and
this is the genuine revenue producing
of the Institute, while the balance
sheet of 1870 shows that there was
a deficiency of assets of £ll/6/10.
In the beginning of 1871, election
matter swamps everything. Candi-
dates numbered many. Among
others, Dr. John Madden seeks the
suffrage of West Bourke. I read
his address, and And that he ad-
vocates for our defence that we
should copy the Prussian system.
Dr. Madden was positive that the
military organisation in question had


much to commend it. But the Ger-
man militarism to-day is anathema
to the judgment of the world, and
there is consensus of opinion, not
to say determination, that it must
be obliterated. The noble electors
of this corner of West Bourke had
no idea, as they listened to the
studied oratory of the young bar-
rister, that he was to rise to such
distinction, for of the State’s prom-
inent men, surely Sir John, by com-
mon consent occupies the highest
pedestal. A Mr, Dugal Macpher-
son speaks, Feb. 18, 1871, and he
has to submit to the conclusion of
his speech to much questioning. 1
extract the following;—“L. Wells:
Would you put a duty on bricks ?
(Laughter). Candidate : I cannot
see my way to do that. L. Wells :
Are you in favor of the Eight
Hours’ system ? Candidate : I should
not like to compel a man to work
only eight hours. For my own part.
I have been working sixteen hours
per day for the last fortnight. L.
Wells : You would make a good
brickmaker, then. (Laughter.)
The Editor of the “Express” (Mr.
Crisp) has in his day come in con-
tact, either personally or by corre-
spondence, with many of the world’s
notabilities. The issue of March
11th, 1871, has a half-column which
bears thereon, Professor Holloway
being concerned. To the Editor of
“Express”. Dear sir, —It is but sel-
dom that I have an opportunity of
writing to you, as my advertising in
your paper is conducted through
Messrs. Gordon & Gotch; nevertheless
you have frequently obliged me by
conferring upon me many little acts
of courtesy of which I trust I shall
never be unmindful. Enclosed I
take leave to hand you a little par-
agraph, written, I believe . by the
editor of the Brisbane “Courier.”
May I ask you, at your perfect, leis-
ure and convenience to give it one
gratuitous insertion in a course of
your paper ? By so doing you will
greatly oblige. I, of course, under-
stand that the article mentioned,
though kindly intended, is in the
shape of a burlesque on the Pills
and Ointments; these have sometimes
a better effect, in fixing attention to
any person or thing than praise
would be likely to have. Nobody
will heed if we cite a neighbor as
being better than others, but if we
bespatter him with ridicule, it is not
likely to be forgotten.—Hoping you
will do me the little favor I ask,
with kind regards, I remain, dear sir,
yours faithfully, Thomas Holloway.
533 Strand London, Nov. 19, 187 0.
[We are not aware that we have ever
“conferred many little acts of court-
esy” upon Professor Holloway, but
as he spends a great deal of money
amongst printers in all parts of the
world we willingly insert the above
as well as the paragraph referred to
therein. —Ed.] “A Queensland Dick
Turpin cured of lockjaw by a pistol.
—A correspondent of Gayndah sends
us the following : “I feel it my duty
to make public a most miraculous
cure effected by the use of Hollo-
way’s Pills and Ointment. I had a
very dear friend who was suffering
from a very severe attack of lock-
jaw. All the medical men from the
surrounding district were called in
to no purpose. It was their unani-
mous opinion that my poor friend
must die. Pie had taken their bo-
luses and pills, but they had no
effect upon him. I did not know
what to do. At last I thought I
would try Holloway’s Pills, but I
was utterly at a loss how to admin-
ister the dose. At last a happy
thought struck me. I got a small
pistol, and putting about twice the
ordinary charge of powder in it, I
filled to the top with pills, and
padded them down with the oint-
ment, and taking advantage of my
friend’s being asleep, I prized his
jaws apart with a screw driver, and
hastily inserting the muzzle of the
pistol I fired it quickly down his
throat. The effect was instantan-
eous.” Our correspondent might as
well have finished the story, and
saved us the trouble of doing so.
It seems that after the administration
of the pills and ointment in the
novel manner recorded the patient
got well at once, went across to the
nearest “public”, and shouting for
“all hands” got into a quarrel with
some bullock drivers; and, after
thrashing some eight or ten —“one
down another come on” —stole the
best horse he could find in the
township, and is now on the road
as a bushranger. The dose infused


too much animal vigour into the
man. —Brisbane “Courier,” July 9,
1870.”
Death of Mr. Jas. Young.
Undoubtedly some persons are ad-
apted for public life, and some are
not. Some again may have the ad-
aptability, but not the inclination.
You may frequently hear the frank
comment that the man who would
lead in public movements is a fool,
for he gets no thanks for his trouble.
Rather that he does so occupy a
prominent position in the community
brings him under criticism. Because
he did not do this or the other, he
offends this one and that; and hence
the proverb : “Uneasy lies the head
that wears a crown.” But I pre-
sume that in the main those who
feel a responsibility for the public
welfare act from a pure motive, have
no idea of personal aggrandisement
As I scan the back files of the “Ex-
press,” and read the doings of our
mighty little hamlet of the sixties
and seventies two characters stand
cut who verily were pillars of the
community—James Elijah Crook and
James Young, and we enter into
their labours. Both men evidently
had advantage of good education ;
if not, they were wonderful examples
of self improvement. I am forming
my opinion not on anything that has
been communicated to me, but I
peruse the “Express” carefully, and
there is a splendid record of varied
activity. Whatever the public ques-
tion, both men have something pro-
fitable to communicate. Further,
both were blessed with initiative.
They seemed to feel they were the
custodians of public interests, and
unceasingly they propose or support
what will make for local progress.
Evidently both were fluent speakers,
and proficient in expressing them-
selves with the pen. He being dead,
yet speaketh. Those files bear testi-
mony that these two citizens did
what good they could to make Bac-
chus Marsh solidly prosperous,
fought for its legitimate rights, and
had those rights respected. True
two such strong spirits did not see
always eye to eye. There was some-
times divergence of opinion, and
many a public scene resulted. For
instance, in connection with Com-
mon School matters. Presbyterian-
ism, as led by Mr. James Young,
and Anglicanism, as led by Mr. Jas.
Elijah Crook, month in and month
out almost rose to a feud. The
modern Bacchus Marsh is too sen-
sible for such recrimination. I pre-
sume that these two men were not
without fault. Who is so let him
cast the first stone. But those pages
reveal that meritorious service, year
in and year out, was rendered to
the community, and while there may
not be the memorial tablet, surely
there can be the appreciative ac-
knowledgment. Because Jas. Young
failed eventually in his own private
business should not, for one moment,
diminish a whole-souled recognition
of the distinctive part which he
played in the advancement of Bac-
chus Marsh.
I do not wish to make comparison,
but is the Marsh to-day so blessed
with any citizen who would sub-
ordinate his own interests to the
public weal as these two leaders of
the sixties and seventies did ? A
community is interdependent: it is
not a collection of isolated atoms,
and that man is a benefactor who
does most for the sake of others,
who makes two blades of grass grow
where only one grew before. Self-
ishness directs that one’s own indi-
vidual self be the constant objec-
tive. Citizenship has a nobler ideal,
and I honestly believe, from the
data supplied me in those records,
that James Elijah Crook and James
Young, with many possibilities of
limitation, and many possible errors
of performance, did try to live up
to the ideal of citizenship.
James Young passed away March
15th, 1871. I give the sketch Of
his career as appearing in the “Ex-
press” of March 18, 1871 :
Another old colonist, and one who
has been closely identified with the
history of Bacchus Marsh, has fin-
ished his mortal career. Our read-
ers will read with regret that Mr.
James Young died very suddenly on
Wednesday last. We are not in
possession of further particulars
than that he was attacked in much
the same way as on two former oc-
casions, when he suffered from neu-
ralgia, but we believe that an affec-
tion of that kind is not fatal unless


the heart is reached. However, be
the cause what it may, it is deeply
to be deplored that a life which
promised to be vigorous and useful
to its possessor and his family, and
the community generally, for many
years to come, should have termin-
ated in so unexpected a manner.
Mr. Young was born at Flodden, in
Northumberland, in or about the
year 1818, consequently he was about
5 3 years of age at the time of his
death. He came to this colony in
the year 1841 in charge of a cargo
of cattle, and on his arrival he was
for some time engaged in exercising
his trade as a carpenter. He also
commenced storekeeping on the
Wannon, in the then most settled
part of the colony. About 184 9 he
settled in Bacchus Marsh, and, in
partnership with Mr. W. Lyle, now
resident amongst us, he built the
Border flour mill. He remained
possessor of it until the latter end
of 1869, when he left Bacchus Marsh
for Nagambie, in the Goulburn dis-
trict. During all the years of his
residence in Bacchus Marsh he was
a prominent member of the commun-
ity; indeed, at one time he was
called, and no doubt was, in a cer-
tain sense, “King of Bacchus Marsh.”
He was an intelligent man, a tee-
totaller, and industrious, therefore
it is not surprising that he was very
prosperous up till about 1853, when
he paid a short visit to his friends
in the old country. From that time
his affairs became somewhat in-
volved, mainly owing to bad seasons,
and unsuccessful speculations in
farming and squatting, until at
length the crisis came in 1869, and
his estate was assigned, the result
being that he left a district in which
he had resided over twenty years,
and no. doubt looked to make his
final resting place upon earth, and
commenced life anew at Nagambie,
where he erected a flour mill, with
the help of some wealthy Melbourne
friends, and was, we believe, doing
well at the time of his decease. He
was married in 1850 to a sister of
Captain Gardiner, a well-known
squatter, who survives him, and has
left a family of six children, of
whom the eldest son is able, we be-
lieve, to carry on the business which
has fallen from the father’s hands.
Very many persons now settled in
freeholds of their own in Bacchus
Marsh and surrounding districts can
trace a connection between Mr.
Young and the cause of their settle-
ment in this part of the colony.
Some were advised by him to emi-
grate from their native land; some
were employed by him in various
capacities ; some were his relatives,
and others he assisted to settle down
under the Land Acts of 1862 and
1865. He was always a public man
—both in local and general politics,
and at one time contested Kilmore
against the Hon. John O’Shanassy.
He was Chairman and member of
the Road Board for many years; he
was a Justice of the Peace, and in
all matters of public kind he took
a prominent part. As a supporter
of the Presbyterian Church, he was
particularly ardent. In the early
days his house was the manse, and
his mill the church of that denom-
ination, and up till the time of his
leaving the district he was, un-
doubtedly, the mainstay of the con-
gregation. He had a great idea of
the importance and future prospects
of Bacchus Marsh —too much so, wg
are afraid, for his own benefit, and
that of the Presbyterian Church here.
He spent much time in advocating
a scheme of irrigation for the dis-
trict, and in former years, joined in
the agitation to procure a railway
to Melbourne ; in fact, he was mixed
up with all , public matters, and
amongst other things took a great
interest in promoting the erection
of schools. Although he had enem-
ies, of course, and latterly lost many
friends owing to their making pe-
cuniary losses through him, which
they thought, and perhaps with
reason (but of that we need not
express an opinion) he should not
have allowed them to suffer, he was,
on the whole, well respected in this
neighbourhood, and we, and many
of those who had differed with him
on local matters, looked forward
with pleasure to his regaining a
competency and living to a ripe old
age to enjoy it, both in private life
and as a public man —his career in
the latter capacity being tempered
by the experience he had gained in
Bacchus Marsh. [Since the above
was in type we have received in-


formation that Mr. Young was taken
ill on Sunday afternoon last, and
was attended by two doctors, who
stated the illness to be inflammation
of the bowels, Which ended in mor-
tification and death at 8 o’clock on
Tnursday evening.]
Bacchus Marsh Races, of 1871.
Horse racing must have been em-
bedded in the Crook family. Hon.
Sec. was our late old friend Mr.
Cornelius Mahoney. Two of princi-
pal races were won by horse owned
oy J. R. Crook —Saladin and Prima-
Honna. F. Crook was the mount in
both races. I find some picturesque
writing on the meeting, not from
editorial pen, but a lady records her
impressions. I have an idea that
the nom-de-plume, ‘‘Amelia Grundy,”
is fictitious, for the whole cast of
production bears too much evidence
of masculinity. The contribution
runs into a column. Miss Amelia
Grundy is accompanied by Mr. Fitz-
boodle. ‘‘At the pressing invitation
of Mr. Fltz, I drank a lady’s blush
in Mr. Canny’s booth, ‘‘pro salute
aniraae,” and we returned to the
hill. The bell sounded to prepare
for the next race —the great race of
the day. Fitz and I could not re-
sist the temptation to witness the
start of both horses. As they step-
ped gaily forth, their prepossessing
air attracted‘the eyes of the whole
crowd, and a buzz of admiration
echoed from all sides towards Sa-
ladin, who henceforth became the
centre of attraction as the first fav-
orite. His lovely grey and white
spotted coat, his magnificent form,
combined with his swiftness of foot,
completely wedded him to my good
opinion; and wasn’t I angry that
no one would be against him, that '*>
all ? The race being started, the in-
terest in it became intense, and was
ten times intensified at each turn
of the course, as both kept neck and
neck together, as it seemed, when
coming up the straight. Foam was
at one time ahead, at another be-
hind, until near the winning post,
when excitement reached its climax,
for Foam giving a spurt, came up
with invincible Saladin {Fitz says
they called him the “Wonderful
Scamp”) but the grey, not to be
beaten summed up his courage to
the sticking point, and flew away
from his wonderful antagonist, win-
ning the race amidst quietly ex-
pressed but genuine pleasure. Pitz
huzzaed, while I clapped my hands,
and I had the pleasure afterwards
of patting the gallant Arab as a
reward of his well earned victory.”
A backward move in civilisation.
It is recorded, April 15, 1871, that
the Gap toll was to be re-established,
being erected at or near the resi-
dence of Mr. Ed. Baker. The fees
were to be as follows : —For small
stock, Jd. per head; cattle. Id.;
horses, 3d.; for spring vehicles, 6d.
for each animal; for drays, &c., six
inch tyres, 1/ for each horse ; and
6d. additional for each horse above
one.
Peculiar epidemics in 1871—An
invasion of house mice in the fields;
they literally were swarming every-
where. Also a disease prevalent
among horses in the district. The
beast at first presented symptoms of
gripes, but before long the hind
quarters were paralysed, and death
ensued in a very short time.
Bacchus Marsh was 1 rapidly be-
coming civilised, but there was a
great problem over which the Shire
Council had long and grave deliber-
ation, whether Mr. McCanny should
be allowed to retain the well which
had existed in connection with his
horse trough for so many years, and
therefore had been such a public
convenience. It really seemed un-
desirable that a well should exist on
the footpath, but it was contended
that no inconvenience or danger
arose to the public on account of
the said well. Mr. McCanny had
requested that he should not have
to remove the well, but the Council
did not lend a favorable ear to the
petition, and though that gentleman
was ready to enter into a written
agreement to keep the well in good
repair and safely covered, the Coun-
cil remained obdurate, and Bacchus
Marsh took another great step for-
ward.
Obituary notice, July Ist, 1871,
The Rev. Eugene O’Connell, the
resident pastor for a number of
years of the local Roman Catholic
inhabitants of Bacchus Marsh, died
yesterday morning at .8 o’clock, of
.general paralysis, after an illness
of some years’ duration, it now being


three years since he ceased to ac-
tively perform his duties. The de-
ceased gentleman was about 60
years of age. He was most ardently
beloved by his people here and at
Ballan, and frequently old acquaint-
ances of his came from distant parjts
of the colony to get his advice and
assistance in time of trouble or
sickness. His charities, not merely
of money, were continual and wide-
spread. Indeed his whole career
was a practical inculation of peace
on earth and goodwill towards all
men, so that he earned the respect
of all denominations, inducing them
to recall Pope’s lines, “For modes
of faith let graceless zealots fight,
his can't be wrong whose life is in
the right.” The deceased will most
probably be buried in Melbourne
cemetery, where a mausoleum has
recently been erected for the recep-
tion of deceased priests.
The regrettable death of a local
inhabitant, well-to-do, publicly use-
ful and enjoying the respect of the
whole district happened. The edi-
torial honiilising strikes me as con-
veying profound wisdom, especially
applicable in these modern days,
when mankind lives at such a pace.
His unhappy fate should be a warn-
ing to others not to allow their
minds to dream over real or fancied
troubles, otherwise it is only a mat-
ter of time how long their intellect
will stand the constant pressure upon
it. The question as to what consti-
tutes insanity is an abstruse one,
and it is said that every human
being is insane upon one or more
subjects. Without attempting to
discuss the topic at length, we think
il well worth mentioning that Dr.
Adam Wyntek, a noted writer upon
the subject, cautions persons, as we
do, against allowing their mind to
dwell upon one topic, because “all
power of the fancy over reason is
insanity.” And to the paragraph
might well have been added that
Byron, great poet as he was, was
not mentally balanced when, as his
mother’s body was being conveyed
to the grave, he was observed play-
ing his fiddle. Hugh Miller, one of
the most intellectual sons of Scot-
land, a true believer in Divine
things, put an end to his own life.
The mind is an organism very "del-
icately adjusted, and is easily sus-
ceptible of derangement. There was
no apparent reason why Miller
should take away his own life. The
lesson to be learnt is that death,
whether self inflicted or natural,
should find us having done our best
to develop kny humble - talent that
we havd, to discharge any duty as-
signed to us. It found Hugh Miller,
who, as a child had to be carried to
the quarry pit to work, as one of, it
not the greatest geologist the world
has ever seen.
I enter on 1872. A poet, Thomas
Bracken, probably not the New Zea-
land author of that delightful poem,
“Not Understood,” is quoted ;
Our fields are'fair; our flowers rare;
our forests ever green;
On every hand, o’er all the land,
the Master’s mark is seen,
A fruitful soil for those who toil,
and work for all to do ;
Then let us cry, “Thank God on
High,” and welcome seventy-
two.
Coimadai in its infancy. Jan. 13,
1872. Mr. W. Bennett has comple-
ted a new hotel at Coimadai, which
is truly an ornament to the locality,
supposing it is admitted that such
buildings ever are ornaments. It
is built of brick-with freestone fac-
ings, and contains ample accommo-
dation for visitors. The landlord
expects to have boarders from Mel-
bourne, and elsewhere, who wish to.
have a few weeks’ sojourn in a quiet
place ; and certainly he has good
reason to expect such customers, as
the locality, although perfectly se-
cluded, is quite near to Melbourne,
being only fourteen miles from the
Diggers’ Rest railway station. The
scenery is good, and there is the
additional attraction of die Coima-
dai mineral spring.
Jan. 14, 1872. Foundation stone
of St. Bernard’s Church laid. Many
local Catholics of 187 2 thought that
building was erected on too large a
scale. The large attendance at each
of the two masses that are now held
on a Sunday is proof that the Rev.
T. J. O’Callaghan’s faith in the pro-
gress of the community was justi-
fiable. The plan of building was as
follows :
100-feet, of which 2 5-ft. is for sanC-


tuary, which is 2 0-ft. wide ; while
body of church 30-ft. wide ; two
sacristies, one 12 by 20, and the
other 14-6 by 12-8 ; in addition, an
octagon tower and a porch. The
estimated cost of the building was
something over £2OOO, of which at
the time £IOOO was available. The
architect was Mr. H. R. Caselli, of
Ballarat. The superstructure, of
brick cemented, mostly 22-inch work,
the roof of slate, and the ceiling of
stained wood. The foundation stone
was laid at one of the corners of the
tower by Bishop Goold. At conclu-
sion of ceremony I read that about
£9 0 was received on the foundation
stone, a good proportio-n of which
came from Protestants. The com-
munity has luckily had a history
free from Protestant versus Catholic
rancour.
A new agricultural industry estab-
lished at Staughton Vale, getting
into full swing beginning of 1872,
namely, growth and treatment of
sugar beet. The crops were said
to be looking magnificent. Messrs.
Staughton and Lewis had 100 acres
under cultivation, some of early sown
producing 40 tons to the acre.
Messrs. Wood and Arnold were cul-
tivating 35 acres, and crop looking
well. It was contended that the in-
dustry would cause a revolution in
Marsh district, alleged to be suited
by nature for the growth of sugar
beet. The Sugar Company had
5 000 tons of beet delivered at their
works for the season. There is no
cultivation of the sort at Staughton
Yale to-day. Possibly further on in
the files it will be recorded how the
new idea in farming declined and
fell. Mr. Bissell in his account of
the rise of Staughton Vale, gave us
what he conceived to be the reason.
• Emerson says “that in each town
there is some man who is, in his
brain and performance, an explan-
ation of the tillage, production, fac-
tories, banks, churches, ways of
living and society of that town.”
The “Express,” Feb. 24, 1872, in
a leading article, commenting upon
the departure of Mr. G. G. Paterson,
claims that he was such a man. It
states that during the whole time
of his residence in Bacchus Marsh
Mr. Paterson had, by sheer force of
Ins ability and upright character
occupied a leading place in local
social life, and it was even added
the foremost place during the final
few years of his residence in the
town. The character sketch is done
with much cleverness. Mr. Pater-
son’s prominence was said to be due
to his uncompromising outspoken-
ness, scorning expediency in any
shape, but causing him monetary
loss, as it frequently does to those
who “will not truckle to a lie, sell-
ing honesty for interest.” It is not
usual in a country paper to find
such analysis of motives actuating
a career as 4 appears in the following:
—There is something of a fault, in-
deed, in his not tempering outspok-
enness with prudence, for “mingled
well with prudence honesty of pur-
pose hath its praise,” but this arises
from constitutional excitability, or
what some would call infirmity of
temper, and a French writer says,
“there are none but men of strong
passions capable of going to great-
ness.” To which Emerson adds,
“Passion, though a bad regulator,
is a powerful spring.” And Shakes-
peare, in Measure for Measure, ex-
presses the same thought in the
words, “best men are moulded out
of faults ; and for the most become
much more the better tor being the
little bad.” As I read the masterly
sketch, I was expecting every mom-
ent citation of Goldsmith’s famous
line “And e’en his failings leaned
to virtue’s side.” I must make again
a personal comment. As I read Mr.
Crisp’s work, he tells me he had no
scholastic opportunities such as
abound in our day. I cannot but
feel how persistent a student he has
been in his reading. He must ever
have been, consumed with a passion
for absorbing the best which wise
men- have produced. Mr. Crisp ca'n
convey more in a phrase than other
men in a paragraph—such was the
remark I recently heard. It does
not necessarily follow that know-
ledge only comes through the pro-
fessional seminary. The mind
can become equipped by the mean-
est of mankind. It needs only one
lubricant —determination to apply
oneself. Great thinkers are to-day
easily approachable. In almost six-
penny editions the most intellectual
pabulum can be secured. Mr. Crisp


has been not only a student of books,
but of life, the world abroad —State,,
municipal and individual. I am par-
ticularly engrossed in this character
sketch of Mr. G. G. Paterson. It
starts off, “ we find a difficulty in
framing our remarks, so as not to
be distasteful, owing to his aversion
to flattery (which is one of his
claims to the public regard) and yet
commensurate‘with his merits as a
public man, ana member of our
community generally.” The article
ends : Some will probably think our
remarks rather hyperbolical and
effusive, but what we trunk we
utter, and to one or two of that
class, “who in another’s merit see
their own demerit (using the words
of Tupper) did ye never hear that
censure by the bad is buttress to a
good man’s glory ? What, if the ig-
norant still holds out, obstinate in
unkind judgment, ignorance and cal.-
umny are paired. Let them stand
round about, pushing at the column
in a circle ; for all their toil and
wasted strength, the foolish do but
prop it. And note thou this : in the
secret of their heart they feel the
taunt is false, and cannot help but
reverence the courage that walketh
amid calumnies unanswering.” A
presentation was made to Mr. Pat-
erson by C. Shuter, Esq., P.M., on
behalf of his many personal friends.
It took the form of a cabinet, con-
taining Chambers’ Encyclopaedia of
ten volumes, handsomely bound in
half Russia.
From time to time as I peruse, a
forcible personality protrudes. What-
ever he has to say, he says vigor-
ously. He signs all his communica-
tions “Tom Kissock,” probably his,
birth name. lie \yrites pn agricuL
ture, irrigation, municipal' i&attei’s,
local scholastic differences. To say
the least, he must have been orig-
inal in every sense of the word,
At meetings I notice by the reports
that he calls a spade a spade, and
commendably has no respect of per-
sons in saying what he believes to
be fact. I have an idea that he just
likes an occasional “rough and
tumble.” Even the editor of the
“Express” has to stand an occasional
fusillade from Tom Kissock. But
he seems to know generally what he
is talking about, and evidently must
have been very quick at repartee,
and that of a humorous variety.
Coimadai once more. Coimadai
March 2 3rd, 1872, ,celebrates tiie
opening of its new school-nouse. U
is recorded that 200 were represen-
ted, which, was stated to he some-
thing that had never occurred in tnc
history of Coimadai before. The in-
evitable tea meeting, peculiar to a
past generation, was held. Our fore-
fathers believed that while there
could be “the feast of reason and
the flow of soul,” every individual
also had his “innards,” which needed
replenishing. Our forefathers be-
lieved in edifying the mind but
fortifying the body. The crowd was
great. From the ranges waybacks
tumbled in, the means of locomotion
being bullock waggon, or ordin-
ary dray, perhaps with wheels dis-
tinctly painted, and cushions on
seats —bags of chaff. Alas, in those
days no motor bikes, or motor cars!
Are we the better or the happier
with our higher civilisation ? How-
ever, I must proceed with the ac-
count of the opening of Coiniadai’s
new seminary. Mr. Grieve, the
chairman of the School Committee,
occupied the chair, and mentioned
that Mr. Burnip (these names are
familiar to this day) the honorary
correspondent, would make a finan-
cial statement, which he did. The
building cost, with appointments,
£299/15/, to which the Education
Department contributed half. Mr.
J. T. Taylor did the brickwork; Mr.
Forsyth, the carpentering work; both
of whom were declared to have given
great satisfaction. The Committee
(Messrs. Grieve, Burnip, Morgan
Bveret, H. Allen, P. Cain and J.
Cain) were thanked for their ardu-
ous efforts, necessitating an expend-
iture of, money and time. I look
through the subscription list. They
knew the value of education in those
days. Learning was a sparse com-
modity, and men who possibly had
been denied the opportunity of learn-
ing the three PCs determined that
their offspring would not be subject-
ed to the same penalty, assisted
liberally. To-day the irony of events
in some cases is that education free
is only to be partaken of when the
parent is threatened with prosecu-
tion in the Court. Some of the con-


tributors : —George Burnip £5 ; Pat-
rick Cain, £5; James Bourke, £3;
William Wightman, £3 ; J. F. Tay-
lor, £2; A. Cruikshank, £2 ; Rich,
warren, £3 ; William Jeffrey, £2;
W. E. Standfleld, £lO, and so on.
The Werribee was once a great
problem, but the establishment of
Pyke’s Creek reservoir seems to
have solved it in a great measure.
The Lerderderg is still a problem,
borne landowners in 1872, attempted
to obviate destruction of their pro-
perty by depredation of \vernbee
when in flood. Messrs. Pearce com-
pleted some extensive cuttings and
embankments on the Werribee, with
the object of straightening the course
of the river through the land they
held, and thus preventing overflow
in case of floods from which they
had suffered in times previous, and
which they had fought against pluck-
ily, with varying success, until at
length they had crowned the edifice
they hoped by effectively keeping
out the water, and confining it to its
proper channel, which they had con-
siderably widened. The neighbours
(Messrs. Kerr, White, Cunningham
and Simon) were said also to bene-
fit by tne works undertaken; the first
three co-operated in them, the last
had already protected his bank. The
“Express” was of the opinion that
the Werribee might be prevented
from overflowing to the injury of
roads and lands. The river was as-
tonishingly narrow and tortuous in
places, and it only needed the ex-
penditure of a few pounds to secure
adequate protection.
Schools in the sixties and seven-
ties were evidently ill equipped. Mr.
Thomas Anderson has often given
me a description of the “scnool-
house” in which education was dis-
pensed in primeval Maddingley. My
eye catches a note in an Inspector’s
report—“ The present desks and
forms are a serious drawback to the
conveniences of the classes.” But
evidently the calibre of the instruc-
tor did not partake of the character
of poverty of appointment. Mr. Wil-
son, of the Central School, had abun-
dant histrionic gifts. Mr. Boyle, of
Parwan, was most active in public
movement in regard to musical cap-
ability. He was the leader of the
Bacchus Marsh Choral Society and
apparently was ready to help any-
where in the district. Mr. McNicol,
of Myrniong, impressed himself upon
the community as being an able man,
but the schoolhouses were just the
four bare walls, and the curriculum
was by no means pretentious.
I was struck with editorial com-
ments on the second progress re-
port of the Royal Commission on
Foreign Industries and Forests
(June 2nd, 1872) absolute prescience
of the Tate reform of education,
that all teaching should be real. It
should be remembered that there
was nought taught in those early
days but the three R’s, and it was
only a decade ago it is contended
that the “real” aspect of education
was accentuated. Yet, in 1872, Mr.
Crisp wrote as follows :—“The Com-
mission state's that the replies re-
ceived to the queries contained in
a circular issued by the Commission
show that the climate and soil of
this country are, suited to nearly all
the rural industries of the warmer
parts of Europe, but there is a want
of knowledge as to the ground and
preparation of the plants, &c. The
knowledge the Commission suggests
may be supplied in a variety of
ways. By causing all Common school
teachers to be supplied with speci-
mens, illustrated cards, models,
pamphlets, and even experimental
gardens, including mulberry trees
and silkworms. Training the schol-
ars in the knowledge and practice of
rural industries would be beneficial
in many ways. It would make the
school more attractive to the child-
ren, and in the country districts
the experimental gardens would ren-
der the school more attractive to the
parents. The children, too, would
be early led to see the true mean-
ing of the oft quoted line ‘Life is
real, life is earnest,’ by this practi-
cal training which otherwise would
not commence until they left school.”
Education in the sixties, seventies
inert, continued so in the eighties,
nineties, right into the twentieth
century, but some eleven or twelve
years ago, throughout the wide
world, there was the movement of
an inspiration in the valley of dry
bones, and school was not to be
then an academy presided over by a
Squeers, where the most prominent


piece of furniture was a ffagellator,
but it was to be to all intents and
purposes real. It was to become
beautified and beatified. It was to
be a true training ground of char-
acter; discipline, if you will, but not
for military precision, but to pre-
vent degeneration, the teacher know-
ing mere of the laws of child life
following principles that would per
se attract the whole hearted atten-
tion of the child. Mr. Crisp fore-
casts utilitarian and aesthetic re-
sults. He did this in 1872. Some
attempt at consummation is being-
made in 1915.
The issue of “Express” of June
15th 18 72, is a splendid example of
journalistic activity—five leading
articles —one particularly long, all
examples of strenuous writing. The
subjects are varied —composition of
Ministry, Mining Surveyor’s Re-
ports, Foot and Mouth Disease
among Cattle, Programe of Min-
istry, and another political theme.
The articles in all make four col-
umns of original discourse, with
scarcely a quotation. Mr. Crisp had
great admiration of Premier Duffy,
and he deprecates that any man
should be attacked on account of
his nationality or religion, and about
the only quotation is as follows:
“A tendency to indulge in strong-
sectional sympathies and antipathies
is one of our national failings. We
entrench ourselves in our own little
camps, into which we admit few
strangers, and from which we rarely
make excursions ourselves. Intimate
social intercourse between men of
different religions and political opin-
ions is comparatively rare, and the
result is that we fall into the most
absurd mistakes, and indulge in the
most uncharitable notions relative
to each other. It is a misfortune
when those who ought to guide and
mould public opinion, instead of
correcting, minister to these narrow
feelings.”
Exploits of Captain Moonlite.
Andrew George Scott (“Captain
Moonlite”) has been frequently al-
luded to. Undoubtedly he was pos-
sessed of much ability, and many
were the friends he made locally,
but there was that malignant strain
in his make-up, the bar sinister,
and you can only come to one con-
clusion —that his life here as a min-
ister of the Gospel was a living he.
I have already outlined his career,
but the “Express” of June 15, 1872,
reprints from Ballarat “Evening
Mail” Scott’s daring escape, witu
five other prisoners, from the Balla-
rat gaol, and I believe just a new
structure. He was in prison await-
ing his trial for bank rouDery.
The two leaders were Scott and
James Plunkett, alias Roach, an ar-
rant scoundrel, who only narrowly
escaped hanging, and was under a
sentence of three years for robbery
under arms in Learmonth district.
Scott and Plunkett occupied adjoin-
ing cells ; about 18-in. of brickwork
formed the partition between the
two cells. The final round of inspec-
tion was made at 10 o’clock this par-
ticular night ; all the prisoners were
safe in their respective cells, but it
would appear that subsequently
Scott and Plunkett each set to work
in his cell, at a spot near the door-
way, to remove the brickwork. A
hole was made big enough for the
latter to crawl through into the cell
of the former. To look at the door
of the cells one would imagine, so
the record reads, that nothing short
of a battering ram would remove-
them without unlocking. They ap-
peared all bar-bolts, riveis and
sheet-iron. Scott seems, however, to
have discovered the weak spot in
the domicile. On the inside, the
lining proved to be nothing harder
than either tin, or tin and lead —a
material which could be easily torn
off by the hands, after a hole had
been made to obtain a hold. This
covered the whole of the inner face
of the door. Once removed, there
was exposed to view nothing but a
thin pine door, of the softest de-
scription, with lock uncovered by
wood, and at the back of the lock a
wooden bar, as easily removable by
the hand as a paling from a fence.
Scott and Plunkett removed the metal
covering and the bar, and lay bare
the bolts of the lock. To attach a
string to the bolt and pull it back,
and thus open the door, was no
task; not, however, before a sight
of the warder had been taken. That
official was standing not far from
the doorway when the men stole


out, seized and overpowered him.
The warder was bound with rope
and gagged, whilst the two ruffians
went to the doors of the other cells,
and liberated four other prisoners.
The liberation was effected by the
removal from the outside of all the
locks on the cell doors. The pris-
oner Scott seems to have possessed
himself of a small piece of iron
which, by being placed between two
pieces of wood, and these tied to-
gether, made a screwdriver. By
this means, with the help of two
bars taken from the grate of the
subterranean kitchen, the locks were
unscrewed and forced off, and the
inmates set free. Once at liberty,
the men were not long in making
their exit beyond the walls. From
the kitchen, knives and two forms
had been obtained; from the body
of the gaol a large rope, which was
removed, and from the door leading
directly into the north or north-
east yard, the lock had been taken
by ihe same process as before. The
gang were thus in the exercise yard.
The warder, bound and gagged, was
tied down on the table in the yard
where the prisoners take their din-
ners, and all was ready for the
final stage in the movement. The
forms were placed against the wall
near the tower, and the rope thrown
over (it is presumed caught on the
other side) so as to allow of prison-
ers going over and sliding down on
the other side. All the men got off,
and it was not until 6 o’clock in
the morning that the escape and the
position of the warder were dis-
covered. Scott ere this had served
a sentence in Darlinghurst, N.S.W.
The prisoners when they escaped
must have dispersed. In “Express”
of June 22nd, 1872, the recapture of
Scott is described, the source of
information being the Bendigo “Ad-
vertiser,” and Ballarat “Evening
Mail.” I give a paragraph in full :
Andrew George Scott, known as
Captain Moonlite, who escaped from
the Ballarat gaol on 9th inst., was
captured by four policemen in a
hut off the Marong road, near Sand-
hurst, at 3 o’clock in the morning
of Wednesday last. He was sleep-
ing with a single-barrelled gun and
a revolver beside him, both loaded,
but the police rush him before he
could use them. The “Advertiser”
speaks of Scott as rather relieved
than otherwise when arrested, as
he was no bushman, and the rough-
ing did not agree with him. He is
described as looking like a Nuna-
wading woodcarter, who had not
shaved for a week. The Sandhurst
correspondent of the “Telegraph”
gives a somewhat different account
of the capture : —Scott appears to
have intended to walk as far as
Echuca, thence into New South
Wales, and keep a good deal to the
railway line. When near Sandhurst,
in cutting across the bush, he ap-
pears to have missed his way, and
ultimately brought up at a hut on
the Marong ranges. A boy was
sleeping here, and he asked for
water. Having a loaf with him,
which he ate, he asked the lad to
let him sleep for a few hours, and
when he was asleep the boy, who
was afraid of the customer he had
to deal with seeing that he was
armed with a pistol and gun, told
a man about it who was working
a claim near the hut. This man
communicated with the police, and
Sergeant Drought, and a couple of
detectives, set out for the spot. Ar-
rived at the spot, the boy was sent
forward to ask for the billy which
had been used to fetch the water
with, and when Scott opened the
door Sergeant Drought rushed in,
and caught him by the wrists. He
was, of course, easily overpowered.
Scott, who was identified by several
persons here who knew him, was
brought up at the local police court,
and remanded to -Ballarat. Scott
maintained a composed demeanour,
and stated that if he had not been
knocked up he would never have
been captured. A great crowd ac-
companied him to the station.”
Three of the prisoners are now in
custody, and these the men the
police were most in fear. It is not
unlikely that the remainder will soon
be apprehended. Plunkett and Mar-
shall have already been punished for
their misdeeds —the former having
been sentenced to 12 months’ im-
prisonment and the latter to nine
months’. It is anticipated that
Scott, as the ringleader, will receive
a very heavy sentence. When Cap-
tain Moonlite was brought up at


Sandhurst, Mr. Martly, barrister,
asked him, at the instance of a
photographer, to allow his likeness
to be taken, but Scott declined, stat-
ing that he did not wish for his
present notoriety to be perpetuated.
Later particulars confirm the story
of Scott being captured by means of
the boy asking for the billy. He
stated to the police that it was his
intention to have shot all he could
who tried to seize him, and then
have shot himself. He also says
that he and Dermoddy came to Bac-
chus Marsh after breaking out of
gaol. We cannot believe that, as
the news of Scott’s escape from the
gaol was known all along the road
from Ballarat early on Monday, and
he is well-known to nearly every
person in Gordon, Ballan, Bacchus
Marsh, or Melton. He blames the
press for describing him as a ruf-
fian, as he considers he has not
shown himself to be one, and that
in breaking out of gaol he was only
following the instincts of human
nature. About a thousand people
assembled at Sandhurst to see him
taken to the lockup, guard 3d by six
policemen.
A following file of the “Mail” re-
cords that when Scott was brought
before the Ballarat Bench, charged
with escaping from legal custody,
he appeared anxious, but neverthe-
less firm and collected in his de-
meanour, saluting the justices with
military precision, and assuming the
attitude of “attention,” in which he
remained till the close of the pro-
ceedings. He admitted the offence,
and said he had been led away by
his feelings, which were utterly be-
yond his control. He expressed
deepest sorrow for what he had
done, and asked the Bench to be as
lenient as possible, as he had al-
ready suffered greatly in body and
mind. The Police Magistrate point-
ed out to the prisoner the gravity
of his offence, and remarked that
the punishment awarded by the stat-
ute was a severe one. He did not
think the present case called for
additional severity, nor yet for par-
ticular leniency. The Bench had de-
termined that a similar sentence to
that passed on Plunkett, an old of-
fender, which the prisoner was not,
but still who had been the principal
mover in the escapade, would meet
all judicial requirements. The pris-
oner was sentenced to twelve months’
hard la Dor, the first six months in
irons.
Again, August 3rd, 1872. The
trial of Andrew George Scott, for
the robbery of the Egerton branca
of the London Chartered Lame,
took place at Ballarat on 2 4th ult.,
before Judge Barry, and a jury of
twelve. Prisoner defended himself
after the first half-day’s questioning,
and he disagreed with his counsel.
Brunn, the clerk in whose cnarge
the bank was, was positive in his
identification of Scott as the robber.
His evidence was contradicted on
many points by witnesses, who de-
tailed conversations with him in
which he stated facts differently to
what he did in the box. Evidence
was given that Scott sold to the
Sydney Mint some gold similar in
quality and quantity to that stolen
from bank ; it lost more in assaying
compared to its weight than Egerton
gold did, but that was accounted for
by the prosecution stating that gold
will absorb a considerable quantity
of water. Scott cross-examined the
assayers with great skill and per-
tinacity, showing, says one paper,
more knowledge of the subject of
assay than the witnesses. He ad-
dressed the jury for more than two
hours, stating that he was innocent;
that he was an ex-officer of Her
Majesty’s navy, and an ex-ofiicer of
Volunteers in New Zealand; that he
had received several wounds in the
service of his country, and that he
nad been complimented in several
Government Gazettes. He admitted
that he had told a falsehood in say-
ing that, when charged with the
robbery, he had come from Mel-
bourne that night. He would not
say, however, where he was. This
reticence seems to have told more
with judge and jury than all the
rest of .evidence. They appear to
have thought that as he had the op-
portunity of addressing the Court,
being his own counsel, he should
have said where he got the gold in
Sydney, and where he was on the
night of the robbery. He was con-
sequently found guilty of robbing
the bank, and sentenced to ten years
hard labor on the roads. The sent


ence was generally regarded as a
heavy one, but the crime was one
of considerable magnitude, and had
caused anxiety and expense to priv-
ate individuals and to the Govern-
ment. On all hands regret was ex-
pressed that Scott’s ability and many
good qualities should have been
so prostituted. He left the dock
calling upon God to witness that he
was innocent, and asserting that
those who had blasted his life and
consigned him to a living tomb
would wither away before their fel-
lowmen.
As I read this, in a sense, pa-
thetic record of a perverted life, it
comes to my memory what I had
come across in the diary of a local
inhabitant, many years deceased ;
“Went to church ; a good sermon ;
preacher, Mr. Scott.” The preacher
was surely drifting to his doom.
1872 must have been the heyday
of Mr. Crisp’s journalistic activity.
I count no fewer than six articles in
one issue, good solid writing, and
covering diversity of subject. Mr.
Crisp had not then developed that
laconic picturesque diction which has
become his noted vehicle of expres-
sion of more matured age, and which
is impressive, because it is striking.
August 31, 1872. An item from
Myrniong. Rather an unusual oc-
currence took place on the farm of
Mr. Dugdale, when a very fine ewe
gave birth to five lambs, four of
which perished in the snow, one is
still alive and well, and the rest
would have been saved had help
been at hand to shelter them from
the inclemency of the weather.
A literary curiosity. August 31,
1872. The name of the resident
who favored the “Express” with an
inspection of a book, printed in
1642, is not given. I am sorry. An
editorial . comment is particularly
worthy of quotation: “Milton speaks
of books as having a life beyond
life, and says ‘he who destroys a
good book kills reason itself.’ We
may well suppose that the book be-
fore us has fallen into the hands of
people having that reverence for a
good book, or otherwise it would not
have survived the chances of over
two hundred years.” The ancient
Volume really consisted of three dis-
tinct pamphlets, the first the Religio
Medici of Sir Thomas Browne; the
second, a criticism of the first by
Sir Kenelme Digby; the third, a cri-
ticism of the other two. This love
of books —I am tracing history, and
therefore duly note differences in
mode of thought evolved with the
process of time—interest in an older
generation seems, under the ad-
vancement of civilisation, strangely
to have fled. We live in the age
of “penny-dreadfuls,” “yellow-backs”
colored pictorials, while the press,
overburdened with details of social
puerilities and vacuities, dispenses
any intellectuality in homeopathic
doses. Probably to-day the Editor
of the “Express” would not be able
to hide his astonishment if a sub-
scriber should favor him with an
inspection of some precious old heir-
loom, in the way of literature, which
was being conserved with jealous
care. Two or three decades ago a
library—the bookcase —was an im-
portant feature in the appointment
of a “front room” or “parlor.” Our
earnestness in the accumulation of
book lore to-day is a bundle of light
literature, sixpence per copy, cover
highly embellished, not to say gor-
geously sensational, the villain being
scruffed by the hero, and the heroine
fainting in his arms, indifferently
stowed away in a corner of the pan-
try.
August 31, 1872. An Inspector
of the Educational Department who
in the course of his official career
has been stationed in many parts of
the State, and it would be only cor-
rect to add, the most picturesque,
declares that the most attractive
stretch of road he has ever travelled
on is that from Myrniong to the
Marsh. It was not always so. Many
were the sharp pinches from Melton
to Ballan. The “Express” of date
in question devotes a sub-leader to
the question of reducing gradients
in certain hills. lam amused at one
argument adduced for retaining the
sharp pinches : —“Another aspect in
which the question may be looked
at is that these pinches act as
natural toll bars, to prevent exces-
sively heavy loading. At present
great complaints are made of the
terrible cutting up in all Shires
which roads receive from waggons


with narrow tyres carrying eight or
ten ton loads. A stiff hill here and
there is not a bad check upon that.”
This argument evidently did not
gain popular credence, for Anthony’s
cutting, Stamford Hill, and road at
head of Korkuperrimul creek, not
to speak of Deep creek, were in
time attended to. Indeed the sub-
article referred to these reduction
of gradients as luxuries, in view of
other things which were absolute
necessities.
The District Mourns.
Sept. 7th, 1872. Bacchus Marsh
is suddenly plunged into gloom. A
public identity was removed by
death, and there is much public
mourning. The name of the deceased
was on every man’s lips, and all
spoke with bated breath of the not-
able character that had gone to the
Beyond. I quote Pope for animal
immortality.
“And thinks admitted to that open
sky
His faithful dog shall bear him
company.”
“Great regret is felt in Bacchus
Marsh, owing to the death of Mr.
Crook’s horse Saladin, the truly
“gallant little grey” as he has often
been called. He had been at Mr.
Crook’s stables in Bacchus Marsh
for some weeks past. As the horse
refused to eat, he was given a dose
of physic; but as he did not improve,
Mr. Miscamble, veterinary surgeon,
came up from Melbourne, and con-
sidered the case hopeless, and said
Saladin would die about mid-night,
which proved to be correct, as the
horse toppled over about half-past
eleven, and died a little before
twelve, moving his legs as though
galloping when breathing his last.
A postmortem showed the horse died
of some affection of the chest. The
heart was weighed, and found to be
BJ-lbs. This is said to be an unusually
great weight, and certainly if pluck-
iness is caused by largeness of heart
Saladin must have had a heart of
more than the usual size, for his
gameness was not surpassed, and
probably not equalled, by any horse
that ever ran in this colony, ample
proof of which was given by his
running two dead heats with Flying
Dutchman for the Australian Cup,
and then beating him the third time.
Although but a pony he has run in
the best company, under all sorts of
weights, and a variety of training,
and has always been first or second,
no matter how many races he may
have run that day or just previously.
He was eight years old last August,
and during the time, (about four
years) he has been in training has
won something like £2,500. If ever
a horse was entitled to the name of
the “little wonder” it was Saladin,
and we can well understand that the
owner feels that he has lost “one of
the truest friends he ever had,”
which feeling will be participated
in, more or less, by the many thous-
ands of people who have seen, ad-
mired, and won money on Saladin.”
I like that pathetic touch in the
obituary notice, “moving his legs as
though galloping when breathing his
last.” It is the obsession of one’s
vocation even unto the last. It is
again the dying schoolmaster, as he
passes away, seizing hold of a ruler,
“his ruling passion in death.” 1
presume the movements of the legs
as though'galloping again to catch
the judge’s eye was what many an
old crock, who had never done a
sprint in their lives, only on rare
occasions when a bushel of oats ap-
peared above the horizon, had ex-
perienced as they gave up the ghost.
Hut Saladin, the “gallant little grey,”
“the little wonder,” was dying, and
hence he must die spectacularly, and
I am sure, had there been closer
observation, one might have observed
a silent tear dropping from the eye
of the noble animal that he was not
spared to meet “The Plying Dutch-
man” again.
On 9th Oct., 1870, a child roamed
away at Coimadai, and although the
whole country around was searched
day and night, no trace of the lost
one could be found. It was as if
the child had been abducted. That
was in 1870. I read, Nov. 16, 1872,
that a portion of the skeleton of a
child had been found at Coimadai-
The readers of “The Express” were
reminded that some three years be-
fore the three-year-old daughter of
Mr. Farrington, then residing in the
district, had strayed from the house
of a neighbour, while the mother


was there on a visit. The prolonged
and difficult search had fruitless
ending, although it was continued for
days and days after the child’s dis-
appearance. The remains were ac-
cidentally discovered on the side of
some rising ground, about a mile
to the northward of where the child
strayed from. A pair of boots and
a hood had been certified to by the
parents as those worn by the child
at the time of its disappearance.
I scan along. Ah ! here is some-
thing worth reviving. A Mr. Geo.
Farmer was a respected resident in
Bacchus Marsh for some time, but
it appears that he was titled, being
no less a personage than Sir George
Farmer, K.C.B. He thought it only
fitting, in view of his altered cir-
cumstances, that he should dispense
with his title. The Bacchus Marsh
folk appreciated such decision, and
did not tattle about it. Sir George
removed to Footscray and got em-
ployment in the General Post-office.
The statement was made that “he
was not a K.C.B. either, but a bar-
onet.”
As I continue to peruse the cor-
respondence of those early days, the
poetical and other productions, I
have to repeat that the status of
general thinking was higher than
what obtains to-day. It is true that
we modern folk have better facilities
of education; the three R’s are cer-
tainly more widely spread ; but in
the domain of pure literature, have
we to-day men who could pen such
strenuous lines, express themselves
so forcibly, use such classic illus-
trations as I come across in the
“Express” of the sixties and seven-
ties ? It is true that we can read and
write, and figure in the mass better
than the earlier generations, but,
the question is, “Do we think ?”
and one can be learned and yet be
and idiot. ' I fall into these reflec-
tions as I read the lines composed
by the .late Mr. Cornelius Mahoney,
on the occasion of a visit to Pent-
land Hills. The annual tea meeting
(Nov, 16, 1872) of the Pentland
Hills School was held. Mr. Geo.
Grant, J.P., occupied the chair ;
several songs, &c., were given by
Mr. and Mrs. Ninnes and their
pupils ; Messrs. Windham Redding
and C. Mahoney contributed read-
mgs. The original effort of the
latter I will produce, for it has
induced the said reflections. The
metre may be slightly halting, but
undoubtedly much poetic adaptabil-
ity is displayed, and the thought
reaches a high level.
PENTLAND HILLS SCHOOL.
Nov. 16, 1872.
My worthy friends and neighbours
here to-night,
By the respected teacher’s invitation
I avail myself with pleasure of the
right
With kindly folk to seek, through
conversation,
The enjoyment that we socially unite
In, and share together, too, what-
e’er our station,
Country, creed, or calling ; ’tis no
matter
Whate’er one is—farmer, man or
squatter.
Some seven-and-twenty years ago, or
more
With wakened feelings I roamed
o’er these hills.
The scene was then a solitude, and
bore
No trace of civilisation, save what
filled
The arr at sundown, when the fleecy
store
Went bleating homeward, halting at
the rills
Of water—after yarded at the hut
of Blow;
I know the spot, I’ve been there
long ago.
The face of Nature then was pure
and clean;
The people, as a rule, were hospit-
able.
No matter what his former lot had
been,
Or whence he came, or whether he
was able
To discourse on divinity, physic, law,
A team of bullocks drive, or use a
saw.
The land of Pentland Hills all
round was good ;
Ballan, and likewise that of Bacchus
Marsh,
Was fair to look upon; the neigh-
bourhood.
For stock and pastures could not be
surpassed ;
Whilst all alone the Aboriginal
stood


Contemplating the scene ; himself he
asked
“What has the whitefellow come
here to do ?
Just steal my land and kill my
kangaroo.”
Fate has willed it so, we may reply,
And the Aborigine, he disappears ;
Pray don’t forget my friend, that
you and I
Will have to do so in a few short
years.
Our days, perhaps, are numbered,
and we die
To live again beyond this vale of
tears.
I trust there’ll be nought remorseful
to remind us
Of all the joys and sorrows left be-
hind us.
The naive blackfellow, in going be-
fore,
The question is whether his fate is
better
Or worse than ours —time alone will
disclose
Dame Nature’s favored race, and
which has met her.
One thing certain, though, wo may
suppose;
If from the other side we’d get a
letter
Its flood of light might possibly con-
found us.
Or dispel the mists of night that yet
surround us.
“Like leaves on trees the race of
man is found.”
This simile was Homer’s years ago.
To Mother Earth our bodies still are
bound,
And from her store their nourish-
ment doth flow.
They will return again, as years
come round,
Into her breast some time when we
don’t know.
That time from. us so mercifully
hidden,
When we —by Heaven —may hope to
be forgiven.
Like fire ascending—purest ele-
ment—
Our souls shall leave our bodies when
the time
Appointed for our short sojourn, is
spent
On earth by will of Architect Di-
vine.
immortal part that animates
our clay
Will not be buried in the graveyard
mould ;
Long ere the burial ’twill be far
away.
Borne aloft in guardian Angel’s fold.
But we must not forget that we still
are here,
And ere we go let us our duty do
To the Posterity we hold so dear,
Committed to our charge, for ser-
vice true.
By just Providence, that will not
bear
Injustice at our hands, that we may
rue
Our own neglected sloth in this our
station,
If we should mar the hopes of our
young Nation.
Then let us train the youth, and
build the schools ;
Strive for our rights, and always un-
dismayed
Seek the respect of honest men—not
fools ;
And never be of bigotry afraid.
This action to adopt among the
rules
When all else fails—it suits to every
grade.
Adhering to this course we shun all
ills.
While grass grows green, or stands
the Pentland Hills.
“Express” Files, 1872-3.
In view of recent developments
the following item (Sept. 21st, 1872)
is interesting. “What is likely to
be a valuable discovery, has been
made by Mr. WTlliam Bennett, of Co-
imadai. He has found a deposit of
antimony ore, technically called
oxide of antimony. This is worth
about £l4 per ton in its rough
state, and is usually exported to
England. It generally contains suf-
ficient gold to pay for the raising
of it. Mr. Bennett has applied for
a lease of 50 acres of the land on
which ore is found, and Avhen he has
secured that we will give -further
particulars. Antimony has a vari-
ety of forms and uses. In its me-
tallic form it is used for Britannia
metal, printer’s type, &c.”
In a later issue:—“Mr. W. Ben-
nett, of Coimadai, has secured the
lease of 50 acres of land, upon
which is found the antimony we
have referred to. The locality is


on the Djerriwarrh Creek, near the
residence of a farmer named Hjorth.
So far as we know Mr. Bennett will
work the mine himself for the pres-
ent, and will send the rough ore for
export to England. It is probable,
however, that a company will be
formed. We find that Mrs. Essen-
leigh was the actual discoverer of the
antimony reef. She picked up a
piece of surface stone, and not-
icing that it was very heavy for
its bulk showed it to a person on
the Green Hills, who thought it was
nothing extraordinary. It was then
shown to Mr. Bennett, who submit-
ted it to Mr. Brough Smyth, Secre-
tary Mining Department. Mr. C.
Newberry, analyst, reported that
sample contained 6 5 per cent of
antimony. It remains to be proved
whether the deposit will be pay-
able.”
There is a dearth of historical
matter as I turn over the ‘‘Express”
file of 1872-3, but I notice a par-
agraph re Maddingley Park. “The
Trustees of Maddingley Park have
concluded an agreement with Mr. E.
Sloss to rent the twenty-eight acres
forming the Reserve for 10 years,
on condition that he surrounds it
with an approved three-rail fence,
entrance gate and side entrances,
using it for grazing only, and gives
public access to it at all times, also
permits the Trustees planting trees.
It is estimated that the fence will
cost over £IOO, to which is to be
added the cost of keeping it in re-
pair, pacing Shire rates, cutting
thistles, and handing over the fence
in good order at end of 10 years, so
that the rent is equal to about 10/
per acre.” The bargain made by
the Trustees was considered to be
a good one.
May 17, 1873. St. Bernard's
church has a Bruce Auction. Mr.
Crook was the auctioneer, and the
result of day’s work was £550.
In same issue is a report of a lec-
ture by a visiting clergyman, on
British poets. The report is apprec-
iative, but includes a criticism, ex-
pressed characteristically :—“Like
most clergymen the lecturer has a
lingual -mannerism which takes the
form of making nearly every word a
distinct sentence, which greatly
breaks up the cumulative force of
the language.”
May 24, 1873. Just fancy the
hamlet of 187 3 moving on such a
high plane of specularity .’—‘‘There
will be a full-dress parade of the
Bacchus Marsh Cavalry this day, in
honor of Her Majesty’s Birthday.
A salute will be fired.” Bacchus
Marsh of 1915 would celebrate the
occasion with a Football or Golf
tussle, not forgetting afternoon re-
freshments. Behold, how the mighty
are fallen ! ,
In the year 1873 the Thistle Act
was vigorously put into force by
the local Shire Council, and the
first victim was the President him-
self. Possibly this dignitary was
annoyed, but the head of the body,
which ordered the prosecutions,
should not have been an offender.
It may be taken for granted that
the incident was not without its
amusing side in the eyes of the local
public. The humor got richer when
the second victim was the officer in
charge of the local police station.
A note from Myrniong, May 31,
1873. ‘‘A remarkably fine specimen
of the bovine race, in the shape of
a fat ox, was driven through this
township on Wednesday last, its
destination being Mr. Simpson’s at
the Marsh. It was the property of
Mr. L. Dugdale, and was fattened in
his paddocks here, and was sold for
£2O. It is thought it will weigh
nearly 15 cwt. The Pentland Hills
for beef after this.” If that corre-
spondent from Pentland Hills of
187 3 could only have had a glance
into the' future at the splendid .re-
cord of Dugdale’s and Lidgett’s in
blood stock, he would not have
apostrophised mere beef, but rather
the perfection of breeding.
August 23, 1873. A poem ap-
pears, much prophetic. It consists
of three stanzas, and is of local pro-
duction, signed ‘‘Fun.” The last
verse reads thus :—■
The day will come, as come it must —
Old world notions in the dust
When art and science make a stride
Rising like the flowing tide,
In this our goodly land of gold
Australian clime so famed of old.
Tyrannous man will then reflect
And share the proper intellect
Well-known, dear woman doth pos-
sess


To aid him in his dire distress
Elect her to her proper station
In leglislating for the nation !
The poem is absolutely bereft of
humor, and therefore why nomde-
plume “Fun,” but a sober predic-
tion has become sober fact, for wo-
man to-day possesses the franchise.
The bowling green idea was con-
ceived locally August 30, 1873, but
it did not come to fruition. That
was reserved for 1915. I quote a
letter : —Sir, we see by your last
week’s issue that certain councillors
would wish the Trustees of the Mad-
dingley Public Recreation Reserve
to spare one acre of same, but the
majority of the Trustees fully in-
tend to make a public bowling green
of that corner at the bridge* sur-
rounding it with banks and fancy
trees. The trees were promised free
of charge, when time and circum-
stances will allow. —Yours, &c., “Let
it Alone.”
Dec. 20, 1873, a crowded meeting
was held in Mechanics’ Institute for
the purpose of urging Government
to undertake without delay, the sur-
vey of promised railway line to
Melton, Bacchus Marsh, Ballan, &c.
The President of the Shire (Cr. R.
Kerr, J.P.) occupied the chair. A
resident of Coimadai was evidently
the moving spirit of the meeting.
In previous issue of “Express” he
had contributed many excellent art-
icles on district railway require-
ments, showing the possession of
much literary grace, not to speak of
argumentative forcefulness. The
speakers of the evening were Mr.
Riddell, M.L.A., the Hon. J. T.
Smith, M.L.A., Mr. Hugh Meikle,
Dr. Rae, Cr. H. W; Staughton (Pres-
ident of Melton Shire), Cr. T. C.
Fraser, Cr. John Connell. A hearty
vote of thanks was accorded Mr. D.
D. Bower “for giving his time and
his pen to advocate the movement.”
One enthusiastic admirer of Mr.
Bower declared that, though the
latter was only a little man, he was
able to take on all and sundry, and
wipe the ground with them. A re-
sume of the meeting in rhyme ap-
peared in the following issue of “Ex-
press.”
BACCHUS MARSH RAILWAY
MEETING.
A worthy lot of ger >en
Met here the other night
To talk about the railway
And set the'matter right.
Our David read statistics
Both true and interesting.
Then next arose a gentleman
On railways many years;
Pleasantly he smiled indeed
And greeted was with cheers.
Naively then he related how
By rail the milk of old
From Ayre to Glasgow it was sent.
And never caught a cold,
But every morning it was hot,
Aye hot as whisky toddy.
So hot it was and good it was
It suited everybody.
Again our doughty David said
The line to Coimadai
From Digger’s Rest it should be
made
—Aye that’s the time of day ; —•
That’s the route to fix upon
The cheapest and the best,
The shortest and the easiest
Coimadai to Digger’s Rest.
Then arose some discontent,
And the original motion
Again was read by full consent
When ceased the slight commotion.
It plainly stated that in short
A railway was desired,
Too glad to have it all would be
And take it where required.
To this course now all agreed,
And called on those invited
To speak aloud and say indeed
If with the powers they’d right it.
The members nobly did respond
And promised very fairly.
Their constituents’ interests
They’d serve both late and early.
Concluded with some sage advice
That all should be united
Boldly to demand their rights
Hitherto they had been slighted.
Urge for no particular line.
They were not engineers ;
Too much talk might steal the time
Leaving work undone for years.
The meeting now was over
And votes of thanks accorded.
The chairman and the speakers
They felt themselves rewarded.
Then stood up and smilingly
They showed their happy faces,
Returning thanks politely
As usual in such cases.
All present then as one man rose,
Retiring in good order,
Some adjourning to the Royal


And others to the Border.
An Old Hand.

Has the local poet become non
est in these alleged more intellec-
tual and progressive times ? Is sci-
ence, as applied to industry, having
a baleful effect in checking the ex-
pression of sweet fancy ? Local
poets abounded in 1873. There was
schoolmaster O’Hara (father of the
well-known Australian poet, J. B.
O’Hara), Mr. Grant, of Hopetoun,
and other, appearing under such
nom-de-plumes as “Frolic,” “Fun,”
&c. The only singer we now pos-
sess is the bard of Pentland Hills
(Mr. Robert Lidgett) who has pub-
lished a book of metrical composi-
tion ; but of late, he too, has been
mute.
Is this one of the penalties of an
advanced civilisation, of our super-
excellent “Kultur”? I have more
than once made mention of the
strenuous form of diction as used in
“correspondence” of those early
days, and I quote one, bearing upon
Mr. D. D. Bower, as an example :
“Sir, —I have with some surprise,
and more disgust, heard that an as-
sertion has been made that Mr.
Bower, in his correspondence rela-
tive to the Bacchus Marsh Railway
has played the part of Sir Fretful
Plagiary, and availed himself of my
literary powers—Heaven save the
mark ! —to assist him in his composi-
tions. To anyone acquainted with
that gentleman’s acquirements, this
charge will at once be repudiated.
I beg to assure you, and the people
in general, that although in daily
communication with him, I never
saw one of his letters on the subject
until printed in the “Express.”
Trusting that this avowal of my
part will remove the stigma attemp-
ted to be cast on his character to
the shoulders (broad enough, I
should imagine, to bear any weight
of infamy, of the caluminator, I re-
main, yours ever faithfully, James
Bamford. Coimadai, 10th Dec.,
1873.”
“Express” Files, 1874.
The year 1874 now engages our
attention —just 41 years ago. The
first item of interest that catches
hiy eye is an account of the break-
ing up of the Bacchus Marsh State
school for the Xmas holidays. Mr.
Wilson, with all his troubles has
gone, and a new head teacher reigns
-—Mr. T. W. Lewis, who was after-
wards before his retirement to as-
sume the headteachership of one of
the largest schools of the State. The
schoolroom for the occasion was de-
corated “with green leaves and
flowers, also with a landscape paint-
ted by the local artist, Mr. Camp-
bell,” which is said to have done
him great credit. At the west end
of the room a large gallery was
erected, upon which the scholars
were staged, and “they afforded, it
need scarcely be said, a very pretty
and interesting sight.” There was
no commodious Mechanics’ Hall,
and the Bacchus Marsh promoter
of entertainments had to cut his
cloth according to his measure. The
report said that admission was by
invitation, but some turned up who
were not invited. Probably the ex-
igency of limited room accounted
for the fact that invitations were
issued. Dr. Rae, J.P., occupied the
chair. The doctor must have been
a very useful citizen; he was con-
spicuous in many local functions.
I am interested in the programme.
Recitation, “Voice and the Pen,”
James Cuthbertson; recitation, “Cas-
ablanca,” Andrew Burbidge; recita-
tion, “Battle of the Baltic,” James
Watson; recitation, “May Queen,”

Year,” Grace F. Anderson ; recita-
tion, “The Two Flags,” Cornelius
Mahoney ; recitation, “The Grind-
stone,” Arthur Crook ; recitation,
“Meddlesome Matty,” Annie Watts;
recitation, “Mother’s Thimble,” Eu-
gene Bradley; recitation, “The
young Orator,” Joseph Taubman ;

prizes were as follows : —Dux of
school (Dr. Rae’s prize) Annie
Watts ; best grammarian (Mr.
Pearce’s prize) Cornelius Mahoney ;
best arithmetician (Mr. Woods’
prize), Grace F. Anderson ; geogra-
phy (head teacher’s prize), James
Lane, 1; James Watson, 2.
Cricket in 1874. The cricket
ground was at Darley, and “it was
as hard as any ground could pos-
sibly be, and almost as bare as a
metalled road.” Darley some day


will have a verdant turf, but not
yet. The Gisborne men who played
Bacchus Marsh, Jan. 10th, 1874,
were dissatisfied with the pitch, and
voiced their complaints, but the
paper wanted to know why there
was such dissatisfaction, when Gis-
borne scored such a decisive victory.
It appears that Gisborne was “hot
stuff,” and included players of Mel-
bourne Club, who had actually been
home to England; the Rev. M.
Gough, and Hon. T. F. Hamilton,
M.L.C., being specially mentioned.
The sporting reporter of the “Ex-
press” wanted to know why Mad-
dingley reserve was not chosen in
preference to Darley. When the
match was over the cricketers had
dinner at Cain’s Royal Hotel. The
first innings of each team gave evi-
dence that the ground was as hard
as could be, and as bare as a met-
alled road, for the Marsh made 2 8
runs, and Gisborne, despite the
prowess of those great bats who
had visited home, only reached 60.
The Marsh eleven comprised Messrs.
Oliver, Grant, Greeves, Chadv/ick,
Reid, Barrie, T. Anderson, Simpson,
Pearce, G. Anderson, Watson and
“byes.” I mention “byes” for he
made six, when eight of the team
were clean bowled for ducks ; Mr.
T. Anderson was among the slaugh-
tered.
I come across a paragraph of col-
onial history, that should be pre-
served. The founder of the Clarke
family was well-known in the Marsh
in those early days ; he frequently
passed through the locality. The
“Express” of Jan. 17, 1874, com-
ments on his death. The celebrated
W. J. T. Clarke, or “big Clarke,”
as he was generally called, died at
his residence, Essendon, on Tuesday
afternoon, aged 7 3 years. For some
four years past he has been bedrid-
den, and required constant atten-
tion, night and day, but retained
his faculties, and transacted his
business to a great extent, almost
to the last; rumors having it that
part of his business lately was mak-
ing gifts to his relatives, so as to
reduce his legacy duty as much as
possible. The duty is expected to
be large, as he is supposed to have
died worth two millions. The de-
ceased has been described to us as
generous to those with whom he
came in contact as landlord and em-
ployer, and there is no doubt that
he was a clever business man, as he
acquired property with great judg-
ment. He was a native of Somer-
setshire, and emigrated to Tasmania
in 1830, taking with him farm stock
and other property, which enabled
him to get a free grant of 1000
acres of land under the regulation
which allowed that area to anyone
possessing capital to the extent of
£IOOO. He tried squatting in Tas-
mania, and also in New South
Wales, afterwards returning to Tas-
mania. His first station in Victoria
was Station Peak run, not far from
Bacchus Marsh, which he shortly
afterwards left for Dowling Forest,
where he took up 30,000 ac. by virtue
of having sufficient stock to entitle
him to that area. He next took up
a station in the Wimmera, but still
resided most of his time in Tas-
mania. His principal exploit in
land selecting was taking up 30,000
acres in Sunbury neighborhood, al
£1 per acre, after much opposition
from the Government and others.
We have heard it related that Mr
Clarke told those who objected to
his taking so much, that he would
take more if they did not let him
alone. His subsequent purchases of
land in Victoria, both town and
country lots, have been so numerous
that they cannot be recorded, and
we doubt very much if Mr. Clarke
himself knew exactly what he owned.
He was considered one of the best
judges in sheep and cattle in the
colony, and he used to attribute
his success to the profits from Lei-
cester sheep, which he introduced
into the colony. The “Age” was
quoted—“ The deceased leaves three
sons —Wm. Clarke, of Sunbury ,
Thos. Biggs Clarke, of Quorn Hill,
Tasmania; and Joseph Clarke, of
Norton Maudeville. His wife, who
at present resides in Tasmania, sur-
vives him. It is impossible to form
anything like an exact estimate of
Mr. Clarke’s wealth at tirfie of his
death. His landed property in Vic-
toria was known to be 120,000 acres,
50,000 in Tasmania, 75,000 in S-
AustraPa, and 50,000 in New Zea-
land. He had valuable properties
in Melbourne. He owned 15,000


shares in the Colonial Bank, and a
large number of shares in other
banks, gas and insurance companies,
besides which he lent large sums on
mortgage.
The Werribee is apostrophised in
charming metre, Jan. 17, 1874. 1
presume that the poet, “Old Hand,”
gives a faithful portraiture of the
Werribee, as it was then, with its
wattle and blackwood trees perfum-
ing the air surrounding, nay further,
as a flowing river, bounding on its
ancient course, still flowing on for
ever. I have to say that an admir-
ing poet to-day would have to pos-
sess a fertile imagination to paint
in picturesque colors the good old
Werribee. No, the good old Wer-
ribee is a “has been.” However,
let “Old Hand” warble :
A FRAGMENT.
Along the banks of Werribee
One evening while I wandered
The sun was sinking o’er the lea
On days long past I pondered.
When the wattle and the blackwood
trees
Perfumed the air surrounding
Gave out their fragrance to the
breeze
’Mid grateful shade abounding.
’Twas pleasant then to walk, I ween
Beside the winding river,
And bathe in its pellucid stream
Still flowing on for ever.
But hearken to the wild bird’s song
Proclaiming Nature’s gladness,
Which oft was given loud and long,
The songsters knew no sadness.
The native race then lords of all.
Of mountain, plain and river,
Of trees and game, both great and
small,
They owned the bounteous Giver.
Often have they camped along
The banks of Werribee water,
And gambolled in its gravelly bed,
With sporting childish laughter.
That race is gone, the white man
came.
And yet the flowing river
Goes bounding o’er its ancient
course,
Still flowing on for ever.
Feb. 2 8, 1874. A complimentary
dinner was given at Cain’s Royal
Hotel, Bacchus Marsh, to Michael
O’Connell, Esq., J.P., on the occa-
sion of his leaving the district, to
reside on selections held by him in
the Riverina. Cr. Geo. Grant occu-
pied the chair, and Mr. Peter Mac-
Cluskey, J.P., the vice-chair. Mr.
O’Connell was presented with an
illuminated address, in which the
long, faithful and disinterested ser-
vices he had rendered to the dis-
trict were duly acknowledged. The
address was not couched in any way
in the usual formal terms. For ex-
ample, I extract : “It is not easy to
get persons to work honestly and
disinterestedly for the public. And
when we do find such persons they
are, as a rule, respected. You are
amongst the chosen few; and hence
our admiration of your conduct.”
The address was fairly lengthy, but
conveying throughout evidently earn-
est appreciation of good work done.
Father O’Cailaghan read the address.
Cr. Kerr had the highest opinion of
Mr. O’Connell. Mr. D. Robertson,
called upon, made an amusing-
speech, so runs the report, but the
humer is not given in substance, ex-
cept some jocular. interjections by
company in regard to Kissock and
thistles. Mr. Robertson concluded
by remarking that Mr. O’Connell
had done well in the Marsh, and
that he believed that the guest of
the evening had got it into his head,
as the speaker had, to turn squatter.
Many toasts were honored. There
was a programme of songs, includ-
ing items from Fathers O’Callaghan
and Gough. The report concludes:
“And Auld Lang Syne, very vocif-
erously given at half-past two in the
morning, ended a festive gathering
which has not been surpassed in
Bacchus Marsh in the matter of jovi-
ality.”
The “Express” in the early
days was not only a local expression
of opinion, but I notice much solid
literary information extracted from
best of sources, and also some poet-
ical tit-bits. Of the last here is an
elegant little sample :
I’d swear for her. I’d tear for her,
No one knows what I’d bear for her;
I’d lie for her, I’d sigh for her,
I’d drink a “grocery” dry for her;
I’d go without a sleep for her ;
I’d fight for her, I’d bite for her,
I'd walk the street all night for her;


I’d plead for her, I’d bleed for her;
I’d go without my feed for her ;
I’d shoot for her, I’d boot for her,
A rival who’d come to suit for her;
I’d kneel for her, I’d steal for her,
I’d slide for her, I’d ride for her,
I’d swim against wind and tide for
her;
I’d try for her, I’d cry for her, *
But hang me if I’d die for her !
N.B. —Or any other woman. ■
* * *
I find the reading of these ancient
files of the “Express” most informa-
tive. There was one particular art-
icle—“ What has become of the
Land ?” Five counties only are
taken Grant, Grenville, Hampden,
Polwarth and RipOn, in the review,
and a list of the owners of the land
in fee simple bolding areas of 5,000
acres and upwards in these counties
showed that no less than 2,428,080
acres had become the property of
12 0 proprietors, giving an average
for each owner of 20,2 34 acres. I
give some names on list : Austin &
Maidment, 44,733 acres ; George
Armytage, 31,800; Austin (Barwon
Park) 26,968; Josiah Austin, 22,992;
Armytage (Lara) 22,036; A. & L.
Chirnside, 86,518; A. Chirnside
77,204; F. Chirnside, 30,029; Grif-
fiths and Greene, 22,000; Staughton
Bros., 30,566; H. Staughton, 16,000;
and so on. And all this aggregation
of estate bore no land tax, and the
reasonable question was propounded
that, inasmuch as the owners of
these estates participate to a far
greater extent than other members
of the community in the benefit of
protection to property, which is
secured by the machinery of Goverif-
ment by a vast annual expenditure,
should the favored not contribute
their fair share to the revenue of
the State. Possibly the Legislative
Council of 1874 constituted of the
wealthy proprietory class, was sin-
cere that to impose a land tax was
shocking iniquity. But if they lived
to-day, how the scales from their
eyes would have fallen off, they
would have seen that taxation,
which led to Closer Settlement, only
improved their financial status; that
accession of population only brought
grist to the mill; and surely, from a
national point of view, it is better
that from Bacchus Marsh to Geelong
should be a succession of well cul-
tivated farms than that it should be
a mere pun fop sheep, two or three
land magnates scooping the pool.
Thursday, April 2nd, 187 4. Great-
est flood seen in Bacchus Marsh for
12 years previous, and unfortunately
one life was lost, that of an infant
two months’ old. The rivers, under
the heavy rain rose, not by inches,
but by feet. The channels on each
side of Main street assumed form of
creeks, and there was three feet of
water on crown of road opposite
Pearce’s store. Mr. Cornelius Mah-
oney lost fencing to the extent of
£5O; Mr. Jeremiah Ryan was a heavy
sufferer; Mr. A. C. Simon, as his car-
rots were torn up by the roots, and
the osage orange hedge in some parts
laid low. Mr. James Vallence,
“whose hotel is close to the bridge,”
had his house flooded, and lost some
pigs. The Barley bridge, a wooden
structure of considerable length,
erected some years previously at a
cost of £9OO was so twisted and
torn about that it was not fit for
repair. At Goodman’s Creek a
more substantial bridge was carried
away. On Lyle’s creek the scene
of destruction required to be seen to
be comprehended; logs and trees
stranded in all directions, some torn
up by the roots, and scarcely a fence
standing. Mr. Low estimated his
loss at £l5O. The gully in Mr. W.
Grant’s paddock, which subsequent
to a prior flood had been embanked
to a height of three feet above any
.known flood level, was on this occa-
sion overtopped by the water and
had it not stood, all the houses on
.bPjth sides of Main street would have
been flooded. The losses to Shire
Council amounted to £300,0. At the
inquest on the death of the infant
Clark, the father deposed that on
the evening of the flood he was at
home, on the Korkuperrimul creek.
His wife and five children were
there, the infant in its mother’s
arms. Heard a noise of water com-
ing down behind' the house. Looked
out and saw the body of water
coming down, 300 yards wide. First
assisted four children into a spring
cart standing in front of the house.
Went back for baby. His mother
was standing with him at the
door. She gave the child to him.


and he was handing it to the child-
ren in the cart when something
knocked against him, and he lost
his balance. The child fell, and he
saved himself by holding on to the
shafts. The child was washed under
the spring cart. He ran around to
try and overtake it, and followed it
twenty yards, when he lost sight of
it. Pie tried to get back to the
spring cart, but the flood overpow-
ered him, and he could not. The
water carried him down about 150
yards, when he caught a rail, and
that was not sufficient to keep him
above the water. He saw the dray
floating down the creek, upside
down, and he caught it by the
wheel. The wheel turned round,
and took him under the water. He
then managed to catch the shaft,
and got on the dray, which stopped
and he remained there for over two
hours, until the flood went down,
between 10 and 11. Saw nothing
further of child that night. The
children were in the spring cart,
and his wife in the house on the
window. The water rose four feet
in the house. The fate of the child
is gained from evidence of Thomas
Low, who deposed that about seven
o’clock following morning he was
investigating what harm had been
done to his property. When going-
up the old Ballarat road, about
quarter-of-mile from his house, as
he was lifting a rail, he saw the
child on the road. He went back
and told his wife, and Mr. Simpson,
who had stayed with him that night.
Mr. Simpson accompanied him to the
spot. One of witness’s , boys
came with a bag to cover the child,
and witness went down towards the
creek to see whether it .could be
crossed, when he met the father of
the child and Mr. Robertson. Mr.
Clark recognised the child, and took
it away -with him. The child was
lying a mile from Clark’s house,
and far away from the creek. The
verdict was :—“Found dead, and we
believe that the deceased was acci-
dentally drowned.”
April 11, 1874. A Working Men’s
Association was established in Bac-
chus Marsh. President, Mr. James
Young, of Coimadai ; Vice-President,
Mr. W. Martin, jun.; Committee,
Messrs. W. Meikle, jun., J, McCar-
ney and W. Dodemaide; Secretary,
Mr. H. A. Living. The reason for
the movement —that as the eight
hours had become firmly established
in the large towns of the colony,
there was need for extending it in
the country districts, especially in
connection with Shire Council con-
tracts, for while some contractors
observed the eight hours, others did
not, and this resulted in much ill-
will. The “Express” believed that
such consummation could be if all
the working men of the district be-
came'identified with the movement.
Thus started the Labor Party, under
the designation Working Men’s As-
sociation in Bacchus Marsh 41 years
ago, and the tiny mustard seed
throughout the States have developed
into a tree of a good deal of foliage.
In 1874 the trouble was not the
eradication of the boxthorn, as in
1915, but that of the thistle, and
stringent evidently in some direc-
tions was the administration. But
I come across a letter by the late
Mr. Cornelius Mahoney, a really ex-
cellent production. The argument
and mode of presentation are most
effective. Substitute “boxthorn” for,
“thistle” and possibly the conten-
tion might have some application to
present day conditions. I must say
I admire the neat forensic style of
the letter ; there is a decided echo
of the phrase of a Daniel O’Connell.
If education was so scant in those
early days, how is it that the pioneer
could indite such strenuous expres-
sion of opinion, using choice lang-
uage, and, as one reads, creating
the impression that the dialectic art
had been studied, while to-day, mid
the wide distribution of knowledge,
there is apparently an utter want
of such facility. I give the letter in
full, so that the reader may form
his own judgment. Comparisons, I
know, are “odious,” but let us make
the matter practical—does the cor-
respondence column of the “Ex-
press” of the present day ever con-
tain a contribution reaching such a
high standard ?
Sir, —Will you accord me space in
your widely circulated journal for
the following remarks, which I feel,
in duty bound, to make on my own
behalf, and on that of other rate-
payers. The Bacchus Marsh Shire


Council have, in my opinion, made
a grave mistake, because of their
abortive administration of the
Thistle Act during the past season.
As a proof. When the provisions of
an Act of Parliament, intended for
all, cannot be administered gener-
ally, and made to apply to public
bodies as well as to private individ-
uals, the enforcement of such pro-
visions against a few, by virtually
irresponsible agents, becomes, I
think, oppressive, harassing, ine-
quitable and unjust. It is not at-
tempted to be denied that thistles
are and have been growing on the
reserves under the immediate sup-
ervision of the Shire Council, and
only partially eradicated. It is sought
to be pleaded as an excuse for this
that the physical conditions existing,
and the nature of the ground (ranges,
&c.), as also the great expense that
would be necessarily incurred by the
Shire Council in clearing the thistles
from such inaccessible localities,
effectually precludes the eradication
of the outlawed pests. Would the
Shire Council, in their wisdom, accept
this excuse from persons whose pro-
perties are similarly situated ? I
think abundant evidence has been
shown that they would not. There-
fore, I ask, where is their consis-
tency in enforcing a law that can
only be partially administered ? Or
why does the Shire Council seek to
evade the same law which is wielded
by them for punishment of others,
If the same offence is clearly trac-
able to their own doors, i.e., of leav-
ing thistles uneradicated on the re-
serves ? Portions of the low lands
on Bacchus Marsh are so sit-
uated —the fact is clear to all-x-that
at every inundation of the Werribee
and Lerderderg rivers—witness the
late flood —that they receive the
drainage of a large area of the ad-
jacent country, the Maddingley and
other reserves included, where this-
tles luxuriantly flourish and mature
their seed under the fostering care
of the Shire Council, for the special
benefit of the fortunate recipients
at every overflow of the rivers afore-
said. Until our worthy and re-
spected Shire Council can devise
some means, which- of course, is
possible by laying their august heads
together—for preventing the intro-
duction of thistle seeds among other
flotsam and jetsam by water to our
lands, ’twill be quite as reasonable
for them, and perhaps a little more,
to make the presence of the famous
silt from the Blackwood diggings
penal also. In conclusion, I wish
it to be distinctly understood that
in making these remarks I am not
actuated by any personal spirit of
hostility to the Council. On the
contrary, I beg to state, for the
gentlemen composing it, I entertain
individually friendly feelings. Yours,
&c., Cornelius Mahoney.
April 20, 1874. Mr. R. Boyle,
the musical head teacher of Parwan
school, is honored by a complimen-
tary entertainment in the Mechanics’
Institute. He had given his services
gratuitously at many local concerts,
&c., as conductor. The Mechanics’
was crowded uncomfortably. On ac-
count of the “inconvenience” of sit-
ting for over two hours in a crowded
and ill-ventilated room,” the “Ex-
press” contended that it was fully
time that the public of the Marsh
had a larger assembly room. It re-
commended that the then Mechanics’
might be sold, and another built in
Main street, where it could be made
a Free Library, and would therefore
get Government aid, besides being
used possibly as a Shire Hall. Bac-
chus Marsh has properly moved since
those days. The new Mechanics’
appeared in the Main street, and as
a Free Library, with Council cham-
bers incorporated, but the Shire hall
was afterwards built on adjoining
land. The process of development
only ceased the other day, with the
renovation and enlargement of the
“new” Mechanics’, and is it an ex-
travagant prophecy to state that
some day, when Bacchus Marsh is
a hive of industry with every inch
of the flat land under cultivation,
and largely in regard to the fruit
produce that a Technical Institution
will be affiliated with the Mechanics’
and its appearance proportionately
improved, and its usefulness in-
creased.
April 25th, 1874. The Central
State School, which for years was
the subject of so much criticism,
makes greater strides under the head
teacher, Mr. Lewis. The attendance
increases rapidly, and great weight


is given to the performance of Mr.
James Mahoney, pupil teacher, who
succeeded on the first trial in ob-
taining a second-class certificate as
a teacher. The new building at
the time had just been opened, and
the school altogether was said to
present an imposing appearance, but
there were rifts in the lute. The
interior of the old building was de-
scribed as requiring whitewashing
and painting, and guttering needed
attention to stop rainwater leakage,
observable on walls. But the para-
graph concluded—“On the whole,
the Bacchus Marsh school was never
in such a prosperous .state before,
and the residents ought to be proud
of the whole establishment, teachers
included.” Sp much for the judg-
ment of our forefathers. They knew
little of hygiene. That is a science
of later growth. A later generation
condemned that ill-lighted ill-venti-
lated building, notwithstanding its
“imposing” appearance, and the ex-
penditure of £IOOO has made it hab-
itable.
May 9th, 1874. Departure of Dr.
Rae. Mr. Robert Kerr, J.P., occu-
pied the chair, and made the pres-
entation. The Doctor’s health was
drunk in champagne, with usual
musical honors. Messrs. C. Mahoney,
Forsyth, Chadwick, P. Robertson and
P. McCluskey all testified as to the
professional skill and social capabil-
ities of Dr. Rae. The champagne
days for better or for worse have
evidently gone by. A later genera-
tion prefers cordials at 2/3 per doz.
The doctor had been most useful in
local affairs.
May 16, 1874, has significance
that it witnesses the inauguration
of local football. It is not attended
with much success. It appears that,
owing to the small attendance at the
Free Gardeners’ hall to establish
club, it was considered advisable
to mark time until a greater interest
in the attempt was displayed.
May 26th, 1874. The 6 a.m. mail
coa,ch from Melbourne was capsized
at Anthony’s cutting at about half-
past nine. The coach, which was
built like an omnibus, and was made
originally for use during the Amer-
ican Civil War, had some 16 passen-
gers, a full load, but not particu-
larly a heavy one. While descend-
ing the cutting the brake broke off
short, and the coach became un-
manageable. To add to the danger,
there were three waggons on the
hill, advancing towards the coach,
with enormous loads of straw, taking
up nearly all the road. The coach-
driver (Arthur Ward, who, poor
fellow, was fated to meet his death
on this occasion) skilfully and with
great self denial, manfully struggled
with the danger and succeeded in
passing two of the waggons, but be-
fore he could pass the third, the
coach lost its balance and fell over
with such violence that it appeared
to rebound with the concussion.
Conflicting accounts were forthcom-
ing as to cause of the capsize,
the unevenness of the road, the
horses entangled in harness, &c. The
driver (Ward) was thrown on his
head, and never spoke afterwards.
The horses broke away with the
forecarriage, the king bolt having
jumped up and become bent, liber-
ated them. Doubtless it was fortu-
nate that the animals did thus get
detached from the coach, as other-
wise the passengers would have been
dragged along with the upturned
coach, and seriously injured. As it
was they all escaped with what it
is not an exaggeration to say were
miraculously slight injuries. The
distress of the wife of the driver,
during the time her husband was
lying speechless and dying in a
strange hotel (Border Inn) among
strangers, was most painful, and on
the arrival of her father and brother
from Melbourne, they wisely per-
suaded her, after her husband had
breathed his last, to return home to
Ballarat. The passengers included
Mr. Shuter, P.M., and Mrs. Shuter,
and Mr. Hodgson, solicitor. The
straw waggons belonged to Mr.
Mawson, of Melton. The inquiry
lasted nine hours, one hour being
taken by jury in deciding as to their
verdict. The verdict was not unan-
imous, two of the jurymen dissent-
ing, being in favor of one more
severe. The verdict stated that de-
ceased died of concussion of the
brain ; that the brake was made of
inferior wood, but there was not
sufficient responsibility to fix the
blame on anyone. The jury recom-
mended that coaches carrying over


eleven passengers should have a re-
serve brake, and that the present
brake system was faulty, and should
be superseded by some better
method.
As the locality is named Bacchus
Marsh, naturally the history of the
family of Bacchus is of interest. I
find Saturday, May 4, 1874, a re-
port of the proceedings of Ballarat
Farmers’ Club, and a Mr. Bacchus
whom I believe to be a son of Cap-
tain Bacchus, read two papers, one
on the ‘‘Cape Sheep Bush” —pentzia
virgatu; and another on ‘‘Fluke in
sheep.” Later on as he visits the
Marsh, at the opening of the rail-
way, but was not invited to speak
on that occasion. This was regret-
table, because he undoubtedly would
have made family references, which
if recorded would have been of ser-
vice to the compiler of the history
of the Marsh.
June 27th, Sunday, 1874. A great
day .for local Catholic community.
Opening service of St. Bernard’s
Church was conducted by Rev.
Fathers O’Callaghan, Gough and
Kelly. The singing of Choir of St.
Bridget’s was said to be of high-
class character. The preacher was
Father Kelly. The criticism of the
sermon was as follows :—‘‘Father
Kelly spoke with great animation,
without notes of any kind, and his
reasoning was remarkably close for
extemporaneous discourse. The sen-
tences were also well constructed,
and on the whole the congregation
must have felt that they had enjoyed
an intellectual treat in listening to'
him.” The collection amounted to
£220. The total expenditure on
church was £3,600, of which by
time of opening £3OOO had been
raised.
This, is the way Cormadai asserted
herself in 1874. It was by no means
a sleepy hollow. In 187 4 Coimada-
ites had great ideas. The following
is from the Coimadai correspondent,
June 20, 1874 : —“lf Coimadai has
failed to obtain for herself a line of
railway near to her, she has reason
to be proud of her name in another
respect. Our township (the prover-
bial one public house, a church and
a blacksmith’s shop) has obtained
almost world-wide celebrity in the
matter of her mineral waters. She
has obtained the proud distinction of
a first-class medal at the late London
Exhibition. I have had the pleasure
of hearing it described, but have
not seen it. It was a matter of re-
mark that the present lessee of the
spring, though singularly fortunate
in this instance, has failed in his
usual courtesy in not showing it
to the discoverer and proprietor of
the spring.”
One touch of nature makes us
wondrous kind. That is the human
race, though there are wars and
heartless competition in trade, is
held together by some indestructible
tie of sympathy. I find, in 1874,
that the schools of the district vied
with one another in raising money
for the victims of a lamentable oc-
currence in Portland, particulars of
which are as follows :—On Tues-
day, at about 2 o’clock, Mr. D.
Kay’s bark mill, was the scene of a
frightful accident, by which Thomas
and John, eleven and nine years of
age, sons of Mr, Anthony Burns,
have been mutilated and crippled
for life. The boys, on their way to
school, went to play at a mill, which
is now sub-let to a number of boys.
The eldest boy, Thomas, commenced
feeding the machine with bark,
while the youngest boy, John played
in the shed, or assisted in driving
the horse that worked the mill in a
circle. In another part of the shed,
some boys were shying about some
pieces of bark, already prepared for
milling, when one of the pieces com-
ing in the direction of young Burns,
his attention was distracted, and both
hands got caught in the machine
with spiked rollers, and in an in-
credibly short space of- time both
arms were drawn in to the shoulders.
The lad driving the horse ran away,
terrified ; when the younger Burns,
after a vain attempt to stop the
horse, ran to the assistance of his
brother. But the poor child himself
was caught, the right arm was drawn
in above the elbow, and the left.
hand and wrist dragged in between
the rollers. In this dreadful posi-
tion both children remained, until
some person had sense enough to
reverse the machine, when the child-
ren were taken up more dead than
alive from fright and loss of blood.
The boys were at once taken to their


father’s home, but some time elapsed
before the arrival of Dr. Brewer,
and both children at this time had
bled so much that little or no blood
followed when the quadruple am-
putation was subsequently per-
formed. They are now doing well,
and, despite the sad mutilation to
which they have been subjected, are
likely to recover.” An appeal to
provide for the future maintenance
and’ education of the terrible suffer-
ers, signed by Robert Scanlon, Cath-
olic Priest, J. C. P. Allnutt, Incum-
bent of St. Stephen’s, Portland, and
Wm, Tranter, Baptist Minister, was
made to the practical sympathy of
the charitable people of the colony.
All the schools of the district splen-
didly assisted. The Bacchus Marsh
State school forwarded the sum of
£l4/0/9, and regret was expressed
by the Secretary of Committee (Mr.
Taubman) that it was not larger.
I find in a later issue that the
Central school’s contribution was the
second largest made by any State
school in the colony.
.Sept. 19, 1874. Mr. R. Manning,
of Melton, purchased the Royal
hotel, Bacchus Marsh, with the store
and the cottage adjoining. The price
was said to have been £1,600, which
was considered “dirt cheap.”
Of Antiquarian interest. Oct. 24,
1874. “An old Colonist” writes:
(I wish there were more of such
letters, for then early history would
be in a good state of preservation)
Sir, —As some of the lawyers of the
colony may, when time for leisure
arrives, turn antiquarians, like
Scott’s Mr. Oldenbuck, the aborig-
inal names of places and their deri-
vation may become legitimate sub-
jects of interest and inquiry. The
native names seem like those who
used them—to be dying out. Can
none of the oldest inhabitants re-
member a native lord of the soil
give any other name than Mount
Blackwood to the most striking feat-
ure of our varied landscape? Why
has the name Laradock, which came
so glibly from the native tongue,
been ground by the Britisher into
Lerderderg? The proprietor of a
Valuable rainera 1 establishment in
the district might easily complain
°f a popular name given to his
e state the ominous name of Come- ,
and-die being substituted for Coima-
dai. It is not known what this
name is derived from, but tradition,
which has taken root, points to the
numerous inequalities on what is
called the Kiln Hill, and says that
the mortal remains of the friends of
the original proprietor are concealed
there. Any information on this in-
teresting subject would, I am sure,
be grateful to many of your sub-
scribers, and prized by the future
antiquarian and historian.”
The “Argus (Dec. 5, 1874) re-
cords that Mr. Fred. Woodho-use had
just completed a large picture of
the stud herd of shorthorn cows be-
longing to Mr. H. Stevenson, of Es-
sendon. The portraits of the ani-
mals were said to be very faithfully
done, and the artist was complimen-
ted on the more than usual pains
with the background. The “Argus”
added that Mr. Stevenson’s herd was
but a small one at the time, but
judging by the picture the quality
of the animals was all that could be
desired. The painting, I believe,
now hangs on the walls of the Me-
chanics’ Library, Bacchus Marsh, it
with others being handed over to
the institution on the death of Mrs.
Stevenson, who had resided the
latter part of her life in the Marsh-
Early Bacchus Marsh was inter-
ested in Mr. W. J. T. Clarke (Big
Clarke). His son, the late Sir W.
J. Clarke, was a subscriber to build-
ing fund Holy Trinity Church; his
grandson is one of our Upper Blouse
representatives. A note is taken
from Mt. Alexander “Mail,” Dec.
5, 1874;—“A large block of granite,
weighing over 10 tons, and intended
for a monument to be placed over
the grave of the late Mr. W. J. T.
Clarke, lies at the Harcourt station,
ready for transit to Melbourne, so
soon as it can be placed on the
trucks.”
A paragraph taken from the
“Age,” referring to a brother of Mr.
Thomas Heath , of Bacchus Marsh,
and son of Mr. Heath, sen., of Wynd-
ham, appears in the “Express,” Dec.
26, 1874:—The late Mr. John James
Heath, Drill Instructor of Ballarat
Rangers, was Sergeant of 55th Regi-
ment, Light Infantry, and was
present at the battle of Inkerman,
where he was wounded, also at the


storming of Redan and taking of
Sebastopol. Out of fourteen hun-
dred men he was one of sixty-six
which composed the regiment on its
return to Ireland. He received the
Turkish war medal, the Crimean
medal, Inkerman and Sebastopol
clasps for bravery. He has been
Drill Inspector in the Victorian
force for ten years, and died at his
residence, in Ballarat, on Thursday
last, from paralysis, at the age of
43. He leaves a widow and three
children.” He came to the colony
in 1864, and was at once appointed
Drill Instructor of the North Mel-
bourne Rifles, and was subsequently
attached to the Creswick and Clunes
companies, and about two years
since was transferred to the B.V.R.
A nephew of Mr. Thomas Heath is
Mr. Hy. Heath, Commissioner of
Titles, Melbourne. Mrs. Heath,
wife of the old soldier, still resides
at Ballarat; and the martial spirit
still runs in the blood, as a grand-
son (Private Ernest Halse) is now
at the front as a member of the
First Australian Expeditionary
Force.
“Express” Files, 1875.
We start on 1875. In 1874-5 the
district folk had only one subject of
conversation, and that was—thistles!
thistles ! thistles ! The Council had
decreed that the pest should be ex-
terminated. The Shire Council of
1915 evidently is not so zealous over
the eradication of the boxthorn. An
inspector was appointed, a Mr. Tom
Kissock, to whom reference has been
made more than once. Apparently,
Mr. Kissock gave no quarter. Any
landowner that had thistles on his
possession had to face the Police
Magistrate, and Mr. Tom Kissock
was no respecter of persons. One
of the first to receive a summons
was a Councillor. Bitter letters ap-
peared in the “Express.” At social
functions any illusion to the thistle
crusade was properly topical, but
Mr. Kissock was far more abused
than praised. In “Express,” Jan.
9, 187 5, appeared some satirical
verses. A Mr, Tanner, I understand,
owned a much-frequented pub., and,
reading between the lines, probably
the Thistle Inspector occasionally
visited the sanctuary.
Half a league, half a league, half a
league onward.
All on his gallant grey charged the
Inspector.
Wisely he ne’er delayed,
Nor felt the least afraid,
Not for the screw he made,
Charged the Inspector !
Thistles to right of him, thistles to
left of him, thistles in front of
him.
He rushed through and sundered.
Sommonses now his cry
“I’ll have you hy and by,
I mean to do or die.
Though it hailed, rained or thun-
dered.”
Council so good and brave, Council
so wise and grave,
Council who’d never enslave,
Cheered their Inspector !
For that he did begin
Summon poor honest “min,”
Make ’em fork out their tin,
Gallant Inspector,
flp to the Courthouse came, some
who were not to blame,
There they stood all the same,
Though lawmakers blundered,
Thistles they shouldn’t grow,
Whether they would or no,
The town, it was all aglow.
Poor mortals wondered.
When the grand charge was made.
Never one felt afraid
Of the Inspector’s raid.
That auspicious day.
Each his own course was sent.
After his money spent,
Some into tanner’s went, over the
way.
—“Old Hand.”
Tom Kissock in next issue replies
to “Old Hand.”—
Thanks from the right centricle,
Thanks from the left ventricle
of the Inspector ;
Whose nervous frame thrilled
with emotion as he read your classic,
martial, and spirit-stirring lines in
the “Express”. Never has it been
his good fortune to meet with such
a marvellous display from one of
your class, the nearest approach to
it being the world-wide created pro-
logue, written and spoken by the un-
fortunate though gifted Barrington
at an amateur theatrical perform-
ance, somewhere in the “Dust Hole,’
which commenced with these words -


“True patriots we, for be it under-
stood
We left our country for our coun-
try’s good.”
Even corresponcence upon such a
subject as thistles, you see, must
have a fine literary dress, and Tom
Kissock, as well as “Old Hand,”
must have had some partiality for
classics. I think I am establishing
my point that, notwithstanding the
increase of educational opportunities
to-day, diction is far more slip-shod,
is on decidedly a lower level, than
that of the sixties and seventies..
Coimadai has a snake story. Feb.
13, 1875. A few days ago, so runs
the account, Mr. Thomas Seerey, of
Goodman’s Creek, hearing a sharp
cooee in the vicinity of his house,
proceeded in the direction of the
cry. Upon nearing the spot indi-
cated by the sound, he was sur-
prised to see a young fellow of some
18 or 2 0 years standing against a
log with one foot firmly planted
against it, and holding on like grim
death to what proved to be the tail
of an immense snake, his lordship
wriggling and struggling to get
under the log, and the young ath-
lete as energetically trying to get
him out. Seerey was immediately
about to immolate the reptile with
his axe, when the youngster begged
him to desist. “If you hit him,”
he said, “he will turn himself and
bite ; let me manage him,” and,
with one vigorous pull, he actually
snapped the monster in halves. After
extracting the decapitated portion,
his length was found to be six feet
three inches.
The Dugaales, of Pentland Hills,
have always been noted as breeders
of blood stock. Note this item of
news from Myrniong, Feb. 27, 1875:
Mr. Lawrence Dugdale, of Spring-
field farm, is determined to lose no
opportunity of improving his al-
ready fine stock of shorthorns by
the introduction of animals amongst
them of a high-class pedigree. In
the “Argus” account of the great
sale of Mt. Derrimut shorthorns, a
draft from the famous herd of Mr.
Richard Morton, I find the follow-
ing : —3B, Rose, red, 6-yrs-old; got
by 2nd Wyndham; dam, sth Kora,
by Sir Henry Lawrence; purchaser,
R. Dugdale, Pentland Hills, llOgns. 1
The inception of “Greystones.”
March 13th, 1875. “For a number
of years past it has been rumored
from time to time that Mr. Moles-
worth Greene, of Glenmore station
Bacchus Marsh, purposed building
a large house on that property, for
his own occupation. We hear that
Mr. Greene (who has recently re-
turned from a trip to Europe) has
had an inspection made of his pro-
perty by a landscape gardener, and
this has led to a revival of the
rumor, alluded to, which we hope
may eventuate in a fact, as the
Bacchus Marsh district has bene-
fited in the past from having Mr.
Greene as a local resident, and could
not fail to do so in the future.”
The rumor proved correct, and the
editorial testimony as to the pro-
spective usefulness of the owner of
Greystones has been amply fulfilled
in that record of service of the latter
in connection with public affairs.
As a Shire Councillor he has been
most regular in attendance, and
needless to say. has taken an active
interest in all deliberations. There
has been no deserving local institu-
tion or movement which Mr. Moles-
worth Greene has not freely and
substantially supported, and in a
ripe old age does he becomingly
bear his many honors thick upon
him. He is the oldest surviving
member of the Council of the
Church of England Grammar School;
he is a Trustee of the Melbourne
Public Library; his contributions to
the “Argus” from time to time have
always had respectful attention. In
social life Greystones has been
prominent, for visits from guber-
natorial party have been frequent.
He has also faithfully supported his
parish church, Holy Trinity. Mr.
Molesworth Greene is a type of the
old English squire, and while he
has somewhat of the exclusiveness
of the lord of the Manor, it is cer-
tainly not to be classed as hauteur.
I don’t like the descensus avernus
but I have to follow the file. Pigs
in the Marsh in olden time, May 22,
1875. “A great many persons feel
much interested in pigs of excessive
bulk, and prize information upon
such matters as highly as some other
persons do used postage stamps.
Persons of the former class will bo


interested to know that Mr. Simp-
son, butcher, Bacchus Marsh, has
now on view a pig weighing 6 60
lbs., and six feet long. It has more
the appearance of a rhinocerous than
a pig.”
Ah, here is a recovery from pic-
kled pork. May, 22, 1875. Our
own correspondent from Melton, thus
writes :—The mansion at Brookland,
(now Brooklyn) which is the
title given by S. G. Staugh-
ton, Esq., to the property re-
cently in the occupation of the
Messrs. Harkness, was the object of
considerable attention during the
sale. The building, which is fast
approaching completion, is situated
on the junction of the Werribee with
the Djerriwarrh creek, commanding
an extensive view of both, and the
scenery must be an object of inter-
est to all visitors. The design of
the building, which is purely orig-
inal, has emanated from the pro-
prietor, who, as sole architect for
the work, displays an amount of taste
which shows that he must have made
that branch a special study during
his educational career. The material
is brick with cemented cornices, and
a corrugated iron roof. The house
contains from 2 5 to 30 rooms, and
is fitted up with all the modern im-
provements for comfort and conven-
ience of both servants and principals.
The front bedroom, drawingroom,
dining and billiardrooms, are each
25 x 20 and 15-ft. high. The whole of
the others being of proportional
sizes. Communication to the vari-
ous rooms is conveyed by means of
the patent pneumatic bell which is
a decided improvement upon all pre-
vious inventions, not only for its
simplicity and perfection in indicat-
ing the required room, but because
it is not so liable to get’ out of order
as any other kind. In the front of
the building a large plot of ground
is being enclosed for a garden and
orchard, and the whole of the fertile
valleys of the Djerriwarrh belonging
to the estate are intended for the
reception of every variety of remun-
erative English tree, designed as a
legacy of no mean order for' pos-
terity. It is intended to have the
building completed by July, when
the family, who are at present at
Eynesbury, will remove to give place
to S. T. Staughton, Esq., the owner
who is at present on a visit to
Europe.
May 2 9th, 1875. The previous
Wednesday a carbine match was
held at the Bacchus Marsh butts,
between the Maryborough and Bac-
chus Marsh Troops of Cavalry, for
a sword, presented by officers of
Bacchus Marsh Troop. The weather
was clear and warm, with little or
no wind, and good scoring was the
result. The sword was won by
Trooper W. Meikle, of the B.M.
troop, because his last shot was bet-
ter than Lieutenant Watson’s (Mary-
borough.) The totals were equal, but
by the rules victory fell to Trooper
Meikle, as his last shot was a bulls-
eye, while Lieutenant Watson’s was
an outer. In the evening, between
30 and 40 volunteers, and a few
civilians, sat down at Cain’s Royal
hotel to an excellent dinner. Cap-
tain Grant occupied the chair. Major
Cabel Anderson was present. There
was a good deal of mutual appreci-
ation. Maryborough said everything
it could of Bacchus Marsh, and Bac-
chus Marsh of Maryborough. Mary-
borough wasn’t sorry a bit that Bac-
chus Marsh had won, and Bacchus
Marsh was sorry that Maryborough
had lost. This, of course, all fol-
lowed the “excellent dinner,” with
of course a reasonable amount of
liquidation. The report is over a
column long. But just a little com-
plaint to the end, that the proceed-
ings evidently suffered from the
anxiety of most of the company to
get away to a ball and supper,
given by Quarter-Master Crook.
Captain Grant presented Trooper
William Meikle with the sword.
Trooper Meikle returned thanks, and
was glad to be such a good shot as
to beat Lieutenant Watson. He
would keep the sword as long as he
lived, and would hang it over the
mantelpiece for generations to come.
The generations have passed, and I
presume that the sword hangs still
over the Meikle mantelpiece.
In 1875 Coimadai must have been
a flourishing settlement judging by
a description of a school gathering,
organised by the Head Teacher, Mr.
Bamford. There were about 150
children present—where did they
come from ? The schoolroom was


beautifully festooned with ever-
greens, chrysanthemums, and other
flowers, peculiar to season of the
year. Not less than £5 was paid out
in prizes alone. The books were
handed by Miss Bamford to Mr.
Eurnip (member of the Board of
Advice) who presented them to the
happy prize winners in succession.
I read that over the stage were em-
blematical designs—“ Advance Coim-
adai !” “Knowledge is Power !” But
also, to-day, where is the Coimadai
Water Bottling Factory ? A diversi-
fied programme : a song in charac-
ter, by Mr. John Carroll; recita-
tion, Master John Burnip; and so
on. The correspondent is humorous
“Duet by Mesdames Bamford and
Vincent, “The cousins,” this fairly
brought down the house, but strange
to say, it is still standing.” Fancy an
advanced audience of the present
day listening with admiration and
deepest concern to a lady warbling
“Put me in my little bed !” I like
the style of the correspondence of
those days :—-“Everything has been
evidently done with the hand of
steady, persevering and untiring in-
dustry, and if the moving spirit in
this instance will not receive the
thanks of the public for all that has
been done, an approving conscience
will undoubtedly reward for aching-
limbs and overtaxed energies.” Who
the individual was with aching limbs
and overtaxed energies is not stated.
June 5, 1875. Djerriwarrh Creek
gets a wooden schoolhouse at a cost
of £350.
July 31, 1875. Bacchus Marsh
Troop. Meikle again to the front.
This time not W. Meikle but J.
Meikle; not a sword, but a silver
medal, presented to troop by Messrs.
McFarland & Sons, watchmakers,
Melbourne. Day was tempestuous,
wind variable. J. Meikle came top
with 52 ; Trooper Heath next, with
51 ; Trooper Anderson, 49; Trooper
Murray, 48; Trooper Marshall, 48 ;
Trumpeter Bowser, 46; Lieut. McFar-
lane, 45; Sergeant Bowser, 45; the
winner of the sword, 45.
We have recorded the perform-
ances of Mr. Crook’s horse Saladin.
Mr. J. O. Inglis won the Hunters’
Stakes, at the Caulfield Races, 1875,
With his horse, Nimbook. Another
sporting item : In August, 1875,
Torn Cat (by the way, an extraor-
dinary name, King Comedy is a
thousand times better) the second
best dog at the late Wyndham meet-
ing, had a Bacchus Marsh pedigree,
haying been bred by Mr. Alex For-
syth, who was said to have an un-
tried sister or brother of same ani-
mal.
August 14th, 187 5. Another coach
accident. On this occasion at Lyle’s
creek, not Anthony’s Cutting. The
coach was proceeding at a steady
pace at the time, nevertheless, the
horses managed to break away with
pole and one of the wheels, with
which they proceeded to the town-
ship and were stopped. The coach
turned over on its left side, and fell
upon the left shoulder and arm of
Dr. Marr, of Ballan, who was sitting-
on the box seat with Mr. Cheri Mars,
of Gordon. Seven passengers, but
all escaped except the doctor, who
suffered a shoulder dislocated as
well as fractured. The cause of ac-
cident was the breaking of an axle.
Mr. Boyle, the musical head
teacher of Parwan, conducts an en-
tertainment at Myrniong, in Sept.,
1875. The local correspondent is
critical. Mr. Boyle gets irate, and
indites a vigorous composition. “The
British Lion” was rightly rendered
humorous, Mr. Boyle contended, as
it was a buffo song. The Myrniong
scribe can handle the pen, and he
responds fully, and gives Mr. Boyle
two or three ugly musical “lefts.”
He (the correspondent) is quite
aware that “The British Lion” was
a buffo song, but he certainly
thought comedy was overdone when
the brother of Mr. Boyle took upon
himself the responsibility of imitat-
ing the wagging of the lion’s tail
with his left hand, which he artisti-
cally waved behind him from side
to side, ever and anon receiving the
approving smile of the audience, and
making things so ludicrous that to
preserve one’s gravity was out of
the question. Evidently in the past
Myrniong had had stirring events,
not forgetting Mr. Boyle's brother’s
wagging of the British lion’s tail !
Old age has its penalties. The
thousand and one aches make great
inroads upon the muddy vesture of
decay. I come across (September
2 sth, 1875) an extraordinary in-


stance of loss of sense of locality.
Mr. Gumming, sen., farmer, aged 80
years, residing at Parwan, wandered
away from his home, and although
he was Immediately missed, and
search made, was not found until
Wednesday evening, when one of
the sons of Mr. Robert Kerr, of Par-
wan, and Mr. Timothy Connell, also
of Parwan, found him, some seven
miles from his home, and making
apparently for the Brisbane Ranges.
He had no hat or coat on, and one
boot off. He was walking alongside
a fence, supporting himself by it,
and when asked where he was going
to, said he was going to visit a
neighbour. The clothes he had taken
off were found, by his direction,
near at hand. All day on Wednes-
day some 50 or 6 0 horsemen, includ-
ing the police, were out searching-
tor him, and it was fortunate that
he was found before dark, as prob-
ably he would have been out a
second night during which a sharp
frost prevailed. Mr. Gumming is a
remarkably strong and rapid walker
for his age, and is not much, if any-
thing, the worse for his wandering.
Spelling Bees were very popular
in the seventies, even in the City
of Melbourne. The Mechanics’ hall,
October 9th, was uncomfortably
crowded. Mr. T. G. Pearce, Chair-
man of Board of Advice, occupied
the chair, while Messrs. W. T. Lewis
and O’Brien (State School teachers)
conducted the test. Audiences were
differently constructed those days to
what they are in modern times.
Fancy a moving picture audience
sitting out a spelling bee ! The
words were something terrific, and
on this particular occasion three boys
were left for . the last lap—Marcus
McCausland, R. Meikle, and J.
Reid. Scarcely a fair .method was
adopted to select the winner. Ten
words were given to the lads to be
spelt orally, but they were not the
same for each. Master McCausland
misspelt four; Master Meikle next
essayed, and spelt two correctly.
Master Reid failed to spell five. A
very fine performance with such ex-
traordinary jaw-breakers as were
given. I have an idea that State
school teachers Lewis and O’Brien
must have been up all the night
previously ransacking the dictionary.
Master McCausland came first, Mas-
ter Reid second.
Dec. 14th, 1875. An interesting
paragraph on local Church of Eng-
land history, and incidentally that
of landed proprietary, in which the
district was not altogether uninter-
ested :—“We are pleased to be able
to state, on the authority of the
Rev. A. J. McCausland, of Bacchus
Marsh, that Mr. Samuel Staughton,
of Eynesbury, has promised him
£IOO towards building the long-con-
templated new Trinity Church, Bac-
chus Marsh. The present structure,
known by that name, has for a num-
ber of years presented a most un-
sightly appearance, and some three
or more years ago active steps were
taken to erect a new church. An
exceedingly pretty design for a stone
church of a Normandie character
was obtained from Mr. Terry, ar-
chitect, and a quantity of stone
carted to the proposed site (one, by
the way, which would have shown
the church to great advantage) but
then funds ran out, the grant of
something like £4 00 from the
Bishop-in-Council lapsed, and the old
church has continued to be used to
the present day. The offer of Mr.
Staughton has revived hope that it
will shortly be replaced by a more
suitable structure. Mr. McCausland
has reason to believe that the £4 00
can be recovered, and that another
£4OO or £SOO can be raised locally,
which would give the sum of £IOOO
for building purposes.
We think it not amiss to mention
in connection with this subject, now
that large landowners such as Mr.
Samuel Staughton are so much
abused, that he and his brothers
have been the principal support of
the Melton Church ever since it
existed ; and moreover, as respects
the “bursting up” of large estates,
the history of the Staughton estate
shows how these large estates will
eventually be broken up, and if
legislation is to have much to do
with dividing them it will have to
do so by insisting upon partition
at the death of owners. This is
the law in Prance, we understand.
In the case of the Staughton estate,
it is now divided into three or four
separate properties, since the death
of late Mr. Simon Staughton, and


as years roll on probably it will be
yet further divided, and more rap-
idly, because there will be three or
four families instead of one to re-
ceive portions.’ The Robertson
estate at Colac is being similarly
divided, and it is natural to expect
that the large estate of the Messrs.
Chirnside, in and about Wyndham
Shire, will be similarly dealt with
some day. The colony is young yet,
and considering that most of the
large estates so much complained of
(and justly so) as threatening to
depopulate large areas of the colony,
are still in the hands of their first
owners, the progress made in lessen
ing their size as they pass into the
hands of the second generation has
been most encouraging to land re-
formers, and considering that there
is not the inducement here, which
exists in Great Britain to entail
estates upon eldest sons, in order
to support a title of nobility, there
is every probability, we think, of
the large estates rapidly ceasing to
obtrude themselves as a source of
social danger.”
A paragraph, Dec. 11th, 1875, is
appropriate, and further, in regard
to one of the persons referred to,
significant, showing the good feel-
ing between the different religious
bodies that reigned at the time in
the community: "Mr. Jeremiah Ryan
has presented a cheque of £lO to
Rev. A. J. McCausland for the
building fund of the new Trinity
Church, and has promised to give
more, if required. The support
thus spontaneously and unexpect-
edly afforded by Mr. Staughton, and
by Mr. Ryan, will necessitate the
formation of a building shortly. Mr.
McCausland is now in communica-
tion with the Church authorities in
Melbourne respecting the lapsed
£4OO. Mrn Moles worth Greene, of
Glenmore, donated £100.”
Express Files, 1876.
Holy Trinity Church history. The
original design of the church was
changed to lessen estimated cost.
This was of a castellated character,
"which would have been uncommon,
and exceedingly effective. The cost
of it, however, owing to the quantity
of stone work in the tower, and the
high walls, led to its rejection, on
the advice of Mr. Wyatt, who sub-
mitted a plan showing early Eng-
lish characteristics, and estimated to
cost £2,000.” This was in Jan.,
1876. Sir W. J. Glarke, who did
not own any property in the district,
contributed £IOO to the building
fund.
A paragraph, Jan. 8, 1876, from
"Telegraph,” anent A. G. Scott, the
notorious Captain Moonlite, at one
time resident in Bacchus Marsh ~
In the search after notoriety, Cap-
tain Moonlite Scott, of Pentridge,
has hit upon a new device. Failing
to get up a sensation at Wee-
church’s trial, he has had recourse to
fresh tactics, with what success re-
mains to be seen. An application
was made to interview Scott, in
Pentridge, for the purpose of ob-
taining from him a full statement
of all the facts of the Egerton rob-
bery. Scott stated that he is pre-
pared to make a statutory declara-
tion in reference to crane in presence
of Mr. Harbord, said to be a sur-
veyor, formerly of Kyneton, now of
Ballan; Mr. Moran, with whom Scott
lodged and was known as "Scrip-
ture Reader” at the time of rob-
bery ; and Mr. Brett, manager of the
London Chartered Bank at Mel-
bourne, whose branch was broken
into by Scott. Scott made it a con-
dition that no officer of Police should
be present at interview, only Justice
of Peace. Prison authorities had
not decided whether interview should
take place, and Mr. Moran was said
to have such little faith in anything
that Scott might divulge that he was
not prepared to go to Melbourne,
unless provided with a free pass.
Barley grown in Marsh in 187 6 :
Not a very heavy crop, more straw
than usual, but Mr. Jeremiah Ryan
had a great number of stacks, and
the average, at least 60 bushels to
the acre. Time works its changes.
Barley has gone, and lucerne reigns
triumphant, milk (not whiskey) be-
ing the more profitable objective.
Jan. 29, 1876. A bullock from
Glenmore station, killed by Mr. John
Simpson, butcher, Bacchus Marsh,
was found to have an iron buckle
(probably that of a stirrup leather)
firmly embedded in and encircling
the substance of the tongue, about
three inches from the tip of it, and


from the size of the buckle it was
evident that the bullock must have
become possessed of it in his calf-
hood days.
Honor, Jan. 29, 1876, to a local
contractor. Mr. P. Murphy has fin-
ished his contract for the repairs
to the Bacchus Marsh courthouse,
and deserves to be complimented for
the handsome appearance the Court-
house now presents.
Myrniong ingenuity. Feb. 12,
187 6. A snake was caught in a
novel manner by Mr. Myers, of Pent-
land Hills. He had been watching
unsuccessfully for some days to get
a shot at a snake, which had been
seen to take refuge near the kitchen
chimney, and at last bethought him
that as snakes are fond of mice,
he might catch the snake by baiting
a fish-hook with a mouse, although
a dead one. Accordingly, he placed
a fish-hook between the forelegs of
a mouse, and took precaution to
fasten the string holding the fish-
hook to a piece of copper wire. The
bait was placed where the snake was
expected to find it, and some time
afterwards, on pulling the wire up,
Mr. Myers had the satisfaction of
finding that a tiger snake, between
two and three feet long was firmly
held by the fish-hook.
Lerderderg street, “the local Too-
rak,” in 1876 was only a bye-road.
“Last week a large gum-tree fell
upon one of the bye-roads in Bac-
chus Marsh, known as Lerderderg
Street.” Lerderderg Street was thus
so unimportant that thus it had to
be specified. The tree had de-
cayed in a singular manner, as al-
though showing a quantity of green
leaves and standing 40 or 50 feet
high, with a girth of 8 or 10 feet
in places, the only sound part of
the trunk was but a few inches in
thickness, and only on one side. It
is surprising that the tree stood so
long. A number of children attend-
ing the school passed the tree daily,
so its fall is noticeable in the ab-
sence of accident. There are no
gum trees in Lerderderg Street to-
day, and Lerderderg street, is not a
bye-road, but a street, graced by
many attractive residences.
The accident to Dr. Marr, of Bal-
lan, by the breakdown of Cobb’s
coach, near Bacchus Marsh, August
of the previous year, was the cause
of a law case. The doctor was off-
ered £SOO compensation, but refused,
claiming £3,000. The case resulted
in a verdict for the defendants.
Different people, so adds the report,
have different ideas of human en-
durance. The plaintiff swore that
I the driver on the day of the acci-
dent seemed to be dull and de-
pressed. The Chief Justice asked
what had that got to do with the
case. The plaintiff said that the
driver attributed his want of energy
to being up all night dancing. The
Chief Justice ridiculed the idea of
a man being unable to drive a coach
because he had been up all night
dancing. On either side there was
a strong bar, and the costs of the
trial must have been very heavy.
The name of Taubman frequently
appears in early history of the town.
He had been in business in this
locality for about 20 years, that is,
he commenced to reside here in the
fifties. He evidently prospered for
he purchased the Bournefield estate
at Woodstock, eighteen miles from
Melbourne, and that was the cause
of his leaving the district. The par-
agraph states that Mr. Taubman
had always enjoyed a high reputa-
tion as a busines man, and although
not an active participator in any
local enterprises (except perhaps
race meetings) his subscriptions and
regular support to all local objects
had been among the largest and
most readily obtained. His depart-
ure was regretted.
I am interested in value of local
property, 1876. The sale of Mr.
Taubman’s properties attracted a
sufficient number of buyers to allow
of the disposal of three out of the
four properties occupied. The store
and dwelling with one acre of land,
were knocked down to Mr. Brooks,
and it was subsequently announced
that no sale had been effected. The
brick house, now in the occupation
of Dr. Backhouse (I quote para-
graph verbatim) was purchased by
Rev. A. J. McCausland, for £485.
The third, an acre paddock fronting
the Main street, and a good site for
building purposes, to which it is
now put, brought £lO7/10/, the pur-
chaser being Mr. Manning of the
hotel opposite. This sura seems a


large price to pay for an acre of
land to be devoted to such a pur-
pose, and it shows the value of lu-
cerne. The lot was a bargain, for
a rent of from £l2 to £l4 could be
got from it easily. The last lot
offered was a 2 8-acre paddock, about
half-a-mile from Main street, con-
taining fair grazing land.
May 2 0, 1876. The new Anglican
Bishop of Ballarat (Dr. Thornton)
visits Bacchus Marsh to lay the
foundation stone of Holy Trinity.
The building of the Church was hur-
ried on by knowledge of the fact
that a grant of £4OO from Diocesan
would lapse within a certain time.
The total cost of church alone was
put down at £2,500. Mr. Moles-
worth read to the Bishop an address
of welcome, which thanked him for
liis attendance, and expressed ad-
miration of his zeal since his arrival
in the Colony, also the hope that
he might be long spared to hold
his office. Bishop Thornton replied.
It is not every church that has had
two ceremonies of laying the foun-
dation stone. Bishop Perry, six
years previously, carried out this
function, but a variety of adverse
circumstances prevented the erection
of the building, and among them
being the discovery of the fact that
the foundation stone had been laid
upon land granted for parsonage
purposes.
As I proceed through the files of
the “Express” some little tit-bits I
am constrained to omit*. I have no
doubt that the local public would
have enjoyed this and that particu-
lar scandal which the early Bacchus
Marshite spoke .of with bated
breath, for Bacchus Marsh was not
one whit better than other commun-
ities. 1 find lengthened police court
proceedings ; and serious charges
were made, and sentence passed.
But why revive these ! The incident
and perhaps the participators are
dead. Charity dictates that a veil
should be thrown over such frailty,
and let the scandalmonger take heed
lest he, too, fall. I am tempted
though, just to reproduce an in-
stance of the amenities of those
early days, which I come across in
Police Court proceedings. There is
a subtle humor about the evidence
as given in the witness box by the
belligerents. I say I must not men-
tion names, but this one particular
case reads intensely funny. Two
prominent inhabitants, one coming
up the Hopetoun road, the other
with a pair proceeding to the city ;
have to pass each other, and the gen-
tleman with the pair—very restive
apparently—after he got past,
looked back and used elegant lang-
uage in respect to the individual
whom he alleged had not kept
enough to the right. Indeed, he
said that he would give it to him in
the ribs. The other belligerent said
you had better try it on. So on and
so on. The police court sifting of
the matter resulted in the charge of
having used ornate language, those
indescribable expressions that Aus-
tralians utter at Gallipoli being sus-
tained, and a fine Of £2, with £2
2/6 was recorded. Thus blank lang-
uage for once was made to sit up.
I am happy to state that no ribs
were broken.
Ah, I have struck a real good
patch of history. It is a great pity
that the early fathers of this and
other communities of the young
colony did not feel a responsibility
that every incident, however ordin-
ary, should have been entered up ;
the manners, customs, social relax-
ations, commercial enterprises, land
values, land occupation, should have
been recorded from year to year in
a Doomsday book. What does the
modern inhabitant of Bacchus Marsh
know of Captain Bacchus, whose
name we perpetuate . I give a sub-
leader of June 24th, .1876: —As Bac-
chus Marsh, Ballan, and neighbor-
hood were among the very earliest
settled districts in Victoria, a record
of their early history would be in-
teresting, and we should be glad If
any person or persons acquainted
with any part of it would send us
an account of what they know, as
we believe the publication of it
would be interesting to our readers,
and ultimately a connected history
might be compiled from the frag-
ments thus supplied. We have been
led to make these remarks by notic-
ing the following letter in the “Aus-
tralasian” from Mr. W. H. Bacchus,
the son of the original settler after
whom Bacchus Marsh is named :
Sir,- —The enclosed statement,


made up from portion of a letter to
me from Mr. Kenneth S. Clarke,
now in New Zealand, relative to a
query by “Old Colonist,” in your
issue of the 2 sth of last March, as
to who sheared the first sheep in
Victoria, may be interesting to some
of your readers who, like “Old Col-
onist,” take an active interest in
the history of the early days of this
colony.—l am, &c., W. H. Bacchus,
Peerewur, June 9.
The schooner Hetty left George
Town Heads, Tasmania, on the after-
noon of the 2 4th March, 18 36.
Passengers (cabin) Mr. George
Russell, Mr. McKillop, and Mr. Ken-
neth S. Clarke. She had on board
6 00 sheep, 4 bullocks, one horse,
the property of Mr. McKillop, in
charge of Mr. S. Clarke. Entered
Port Phillip Heads about 3 p.m. on
the 2 sth, it then blowing strong
from the S.W., flood tides; passed
the brig Chili, ashore in the Eastern
Channel, with the nucleus of the
late Mr. John Aitken’s since cele-
brated sheep on board ; came to
single anchor about five miles south
of the Red Bluff. Gale increasing,
parted from her anchor and went
ashore ; landed the stock next morn-
ing with loss of one sheep. A pas-
toral association, called the Great
Lake Company, chartered and fitted
out the brig Henry, Captain White,
to take their stock from Tasmania
to Victoria, the Hetty having been
condemned. Mr. Clarke returned to
George Town, and took charge of
the company’s stock as manager,
which were brought over by the
Henry in three trips, with a loss of
17 sheep. Mr. Clarke camped with
his sheep at the Saltwater river, op-
posite the present racecourse, and
commenced shearing on the 9th No-
vember, 183 6, finished on the 2 7th.
Tfhe sheep were like all those then
in Tasmania, scabby ; they were
dressed by the manager as they
came from the shears, with a mix-
ture of tobacco, water, salt and soap;
they were cured of scab and re-
mained clean for three years, until
infected by scabby sheep which were
brought into the neighborhood.
On the 2 9th November, Mr. Clarke
started with the sheep for where
Bacchus Marsh now is, where he re-
mained until the beginning of 1838,
when he decided to .occupy and re-
side at the locality called by him,
and since known as, the Pentland
hills, where he had already formed
out-stations. Mount Blackwood at
that time was called Clarke’s Big
Hill. Mr. Clarke gave up the coun-
try about the Marsh to Captain Bac-
chus and son, who had brought sheep
from Tasmania, and were then en-
camped at the Parete Creek. The
members of the Great Lake Com-
pany were Thomas Winter, Hilaries
McLaughlan, manager Bank of Van
Diemen’s Land - Dobson, father of
Judge Dobson, of Tasmania, and
James Clarke.
Pentland Hills, no wonder, is
noted for quality of stock. It is
recorded, June 2 4th, 1876, that Mr.
Dugdale’s young bull “Double
Brunswick,’’ for which he had just
paid £25 0 to Messrs. Brisbane, of
Epping, was taken to his new mas-
ter’s home. The bull is red and
white, and particularly docile. His
pedigree stamps his value, and his
appearance does not belie it, his
hindquarters being specially good.”
Chicory production, in 187 6 ; “Mr.
T. G. Pearce has grown some ex-
cellent chicory this season in Bac-
chus Marsh, and in land covered to
a good depth with Blackwood dig-
gings silt, but with a good black
soil beneath. He has shown us two
roots, which weighed 6 3-lbs., and the
largest of which measured 19 inches
long, and 13 inches in circumfer-
ence at the 'top. At Lancefleld re-
cently some prizes given for best
2 4 roots of chicory fell to roots
weighing 3 8-lbs. in all, while Mr.
Pearce’s crop would give several
score of roots, each of which weigh-
ing about the same as those shown
to us, 2 4 of which would give a
weight of about 80-lbs. Unfortun-
ately, owing to the absence of a
railway to Bacchus Marsh, Mr.
Pearce cannot deliver the chicory, so
cheap by 5/ per ton as chicory grown
at Phillip Island can be laid down
in Melbourne.”
In 1876, Mr. Molesworth Greene
had a “King Comedy.” Mr. Moles-
worth Greene’s dog, Faith, won the
West Bourke Plate, of £IOO, with a
trophy valued at 50 guineas.”
Evidently a winter of drought,
that of 1876. Bacchus Marsh had


hardly ever been so badly off for
grass and water. Farmers were de-
pendent upon produce dealers to
keep their stock alive, and water
had to be carted from the river.
The “Express” said that if a twenty-
four hours’ rain could be got by
means of a public meeting it would
be the largest ever held in Bacchus
Marsh.
July 20th, 1876. Bacchus Marsh
agriculturally progressive. A para-
graph in “Leader” stated that Mr.
Jeremiah Ryan, of Bacchus Marsh,
challenged the owner of any other
farm in the colony for £lOO to
compete against his farm. The tes-
timony of the “Express” was that
Mr. Ryan’s farm was a good one,
and well managed, “from all we
hear.”
Queries, August sth, 1876. Dear
Sir, —Can you or any one tell me
when we are going to have a good
fall of rain, and plenty of grass?
Can anyone tell me if Mr. Ryan’s
challenge for £lOO has been taken
up? Can anyone tell me how and
wnen the Bacchus Marsh Cavalry
and V.R.A. dispute will be settled?
Gan anyone tell me how much but-
ter has been sent to Melbourne this
week from Bacchus Marsh ? . Can
anyone tell me how many head of
cattle have died of starvation with-
in the last two months in Shire of
Bacchus Marsh? Can anyone tell me
do the officers of the B.M. Troop
take their yearly allowance to pay
for their uniform? Can anyone tell
me how often Drill Instructor Price
has drilled the B.M. Troop within
the last three years? Can anyone
tell me when we’ll have a railway
to Bacchus Marsh, and a station at
Bridge Inn? Can anyone tell me who
is the owner of Diana, winner of
Melton Cup?—Yours &c., Querist.
This letter caused some very vig-
orous replies. That of “Persie” is
humorous. He takes the questions
seriatim. I give “Persie’s” answers
to two; —How many cattle died in
last three months? This is a ques-
tion for Cornelius Mahoney, or
some other learned mathematician.
It can be answered another way.
Find number of blades of grass that
have been capable of sustaining life
within the period named; they are
few and far between, but an active
man, such as Tom Kissock, will do
it in a year or so; deduct from it
the number of blades each animal
has been able to crop within the
time specified, and the answer will
resolve itself into the very natural
query—how can there be any alive
at all? The other question—Who is
Diana ? Diana is the daughter of
Jupita and Latona, imported from
Greece sometime before the nine-
teenth century, famous in many
courses before the Melton one. She
was formerly a goddess; when she
became a dog it would be difficult
to find out.
Mr. Bamford, head teacher of Co-
madai State School, retires, Dec.
Ist, 1876. I am struck with his
valedictory address : “With the New
Year’ he would retire into private
life, and the school would pass into
other hands. He could truly say,
‘Othello’s occupation’s gone.’ He
earnestly prayed that every indi-
vidual in Coimadai might be blessed
with long life, health and wealth ;
that their children might be so
trained as to become their solace in
their declining years, and that the
little place might furnish its quota
of learned, religious and scientific
men as ornaments to Victoria.” He
concluded his address as follows :—•
“Adieu to the spot, where from
destiny cast,
Though the bond of affection can
never be past.
My love for the young, who so
long were my charge,
Their manners to form, their minds
to enlarge.
I’ve led them while present as
Master and friend,
Shall love them when absent, till
life has its end.
Oh, send them another, who better
can show.
More able to guide them —■ the
track they should go.
To child of Coimadai, my feelings
will ever
Warm true as the compass, naught
shall us sever.
Adieu, then, my pupils ! God send
to each youth
With learning, wisdom, health,
virtue and truth.
“Express” Files 1877.
A snake about four feet long was
killed in the Courthouse yard, Bac-


chus Marsh, by Senior-constable
Rogers, on Saturday morning. His
attention was called to it by his cat,
upon whose body “each particular
hair did stand on end.” Neatly and
classically put, scribe of 1876.
Scott (Captain Moonlite) the ir-
repressible. The “Age”, of Feb.
1877, reports :—“One of the most
daring acts ever committed by a
convict took place at Pentridge
Prison. Scott, a long sentenced
prisoner requested permission to
see Senior Warder Kelly, in charge
of B division, where at present he
is confined. The warder on duty
allowed him to do so, and Scott
proceeded to the office, and on en-
tering deliberately drew a table
knife (used for cutting bread) from
under his waistcoat and placed it at
the breast of the officer, who was
sitting at a desk, at the same time
demanding his watch, which he de-
liberately snatched and decamped
with, rushing to the bathroom
where he locked himself in. He
was ultimately secured and placed
in the cell, and will probably receive
a sentence from the visiting justice
that will deter him from any further
exhibition of the kind.”
A malicious perpetration, March
10, 187 7, at Darley. Mr. Thomas
Duggan had a grass paddock on the
side of the road secured with slip
panels, and a lucerne paddock se-
cured in the same way. One partic-
ular night these panels were taken
down, and the dairy herd turned
into the lucerne, with the result that
two were suffocated, and the rest
with difficulty relieved of the excess
of lucerne they had eaten. Mr. Dug-
gan offered a reward of £lO for the
conviction of the perpetrator.
Sectarian prejudice did not exist
in this district in 1877. I deduce
this from the fact that, in April of
that year, Mr. Frank Gavan Duffy
lectured in the local Mechanics’ In-
stitute, in aid of the building fund
of Holy Trinity Church. The lec-
ture was well attended, and the sub-
ject, “American Humorists.” The
criticism was appreciative. Mr.
Duffy had complete self-possession,
and gave the remarks introductory
to the examples without notes of
any kind, and also recited several
lengthy pieces from memory. In
these respects he showed the indis-
pensable qualities of a lecturer. The
Rev. McCausland moved a vote of
thanks to Mr. Duffy, and specially
mentioned the kindness which he
had received from the Roman Cath-
olics of the district, which had been
crowned by the assistance given by
the lecturer. The latter, in replying
said it was very pleasing to him to
notice how harmoniously the de-
nominations worked together in the
district.
Opening of Holy Trinity Church,
June sth, 1877, by Dr. Moorhouse,
Bishop of Melbourne. Mr. Moles-
worth Greene read the address. Sub-
sequently, during proceedings, lie
said it was desirable that balance
owing on church should be collect-
ed. Mr. Greene led off with £SO,
Mr. Samuel Staughton followed with
£SO, Mr. Stephen Staughton, £SO;
the Bishop gave £10; Mr. Box £5;
Mr. Jeremiah Ryan, £5, in addition
to £lO already contributed, and Mrs.
Ryan a second donation of three
guineas; Mr. Shuter, P.M., £5. The
financial statement, as read by Mr.
J. E. Crook, showed that total ex-
penditure on church was £2,414
7/3. Mr. W. J. Clarke was present
at the opening. He had already
donated £IOO to the building fund.
The Melton correspondent, July
7th, 1877, gets quite graphic, but
alas, one reflects upon the penalties
which civilization brings with it.
The noble kangaroo has been ruth-
lessly exterminated. However, let
the Melton correspondent take the
rostrum. “A day among the kan-
garoos at Exford,” must be the
heading of these notes; and a more
enjoyables day’s sport could not well
be desired than that afforded on
Saturday last to those who were for-
tunate enough to be able to accept
of Mr. W. H. Staughton’s invitation
to hunt the Australian emblems in
the forests of Exford. The morning
broke somewhat ominous, but to-
wards midday the clouds lifted, and
the day was all that could be desired
for hunting. The company was
considerable, and was composed
principally of residents of the dis-
trict, to whom the idea of a hunt
was very acceptable; indeed it was
quite amusing to witness the gloomy
and dejected countenances of those


whose amateur hunters had perhaps
broken away during the night, and
could nowhere be found when
wanted. Leaving these unfortunates
behind, we cantered on to Mr.
Staughton’s comfortable and well-
kept residence, just in time to see
the cavalcade move away from the
trysting place across the Werribee
and up the Exford road to the
haunts of the kangaroo. Entering
a gate, we were soon set in pursuit
of a regular flyer, which afforded a
capital run across several log fences
which were quite sufficient to make
one feel what Gordon says —■
“And then the rise from the springy
turf.
The rush through the ambient air,
And the light shock landing—the
veriest serf
Is an emperor then and there.”
Several more were run down, and
tnen a run was made into a lunch
cart, which Mr. Staughton, with his
usual kindness to his guests, had
provided. Full justice having been
done to the viands, a move was
made across another paddock, where,
in one of the bends of the river, we
encountered a mob of upwards of
twenty long-tails. Two were sighted
out, they being designated “old
men.” The first was compelled to
take a jump for his life into the Wer-
ribee, where he sank to the bottom,
came to the surface, gave a kind of
“sickly smile,” then sank, and the
“subsequent proceedings interested
him no more.” The other, after an
exciting chase, was also despatched
as were several others. Having a
long way to travel, and the shades
of evening fast approaching, we
were obliged to retrace our steps
for home, well pleased with the
day’s proceedings, and having a
longing desire to be one of such
another pleasant party on some
future occasion.
Another correspondent (Myrniong)
July 2 Bth, 1877, has an excellent
contribution of a different type from
that of the Melton scribe.
“Sir Walter Scott, in Marmion,
calls women “a ministering angel
thou.” That was not so bad of Sir
Walter, considering that he had
rather a low estimate of the fair
sex—than which nothing could be
more unworthy of the “great magic-
ian.” Allow me to use Sir Walter’s
dictum to hang a remark or two on.
An old man of the name of Cove
fell sick in our township some time
ago, and died there. He was soli-
tary and friendless. Let me inform
your readers that two widows in the
township were ministering angels to
this poor sick man, whilst hardly
any body else knew, or perhaps
cared, anything about him. Cove
had seen better days, I believe, and
ought to have been independent of
the philanthropy of the place. But
vreman does not argue points of de-
bate in such cases. She acts on her
instincts, and those are generally
right. She, it, is said, has a cell
less in the brain, but if so she has
a fibre more in the heart ; and I
fancy the heart is generally correct
when an appeal is made to pity. In
any case it redounds to the credit
of those referred to the part they
acted to this poor man when they
might with more reason than most
others have let him alone. But no,
he was watched, soothed, and cared
for, as religiously as if he were a
relation. The conduct of the widow
of scripture was watched by a
friendly eye and commended. “She
gave all that she had” when she
cast her mite into the treasury. The
people of the vicinity of Myrniong
would be untrue to their instincts
and antecedents if they did not ac-
knowledge such generous and kindly
conduct in a substantial manner.
Entertainments have been held in
the past for all sorts of things, and
I doubt if any have been more de-
serving aid than the object I allude
to.”
A meteoric phenomenon came
under the observation of “J.W.,”
of Parwan. He observed a large
and beautiful meteor fall on the
night of Tuesday, July 31st, 1877.
The fall lasted visibly for nine or
ten seconds. Its course was in a
slanting direction westward. The
meteor appeared to be about the
size of the rising moon, and shed
such a brilliant light that it en-
tirely overcame the light of the
moon. At the expiration of about
10 seconds the meteor appeared to
fall or break into fragments. I
listened, expecting to hear the ex-


plosion, which is said to follow such
circumstances, but not hearing any-
thing, walked leisurely towards the
house. About three minutes after-
wards the sound of the explosion
reached me, and I was not a little
astonished. The sounds were re-
markable, somewhat resembling
thunder, although there can be no
room to suppose it was, as the sky
was quite clear. They continued for
about three minutes, and resembled
the discharge of artillery at the dis-
tance of 20 or 30 miles.
In same issue “Express”, the
Blackwood correspondent refers to
a very large meteor that fell on
Tuesday night between Blue Moun-
tain and Barry’s Reef, and in the
general notes of the paper there is
this mention, that a meteor was
seen from various parts of the col-
ony on night instanced by J.W.,
Par wan.
August 24th, 1877, the Broad-
lands Estate was sold for £20,100.
The family of the late Mr. James
were the purchasers. There had
been much probability of litigation
in connection with the sale. May,
sth, 1877, so many months prior,
the “Express” commented as fol-
lows :—The late Mr. James’ will pro-
vides that his children shall receive
their share of the estate when the
youngest is 12 years of age, which
has now happened. Mrs. James,
who was appointed an executor to
the will, conjointly with Mr. Isaac
Evans, is now dead, and her place
as executor has not been nor can-
not be filled, we are informed. Con-
sequently, the responsibility of in-
terpreting the will rests with Mr.
Isaac Evans and his legal advisers,
and their decision is that, as some
of the sons and daughters of the
late Mr. James are minors, they are
incapable of making any arrange-
ments with their sisters and broth-
ers to postpone the realisation of
the estate, or to arrange as to how
it shall be divided, or dealt with in
any way. It will be a great pity if
mutual friends cannot prevent this
Estate being placed in hands of the
Court. Mr. Evans has no other
idea, we understand, than to pro-
tect himself against any possible ac-
tions at law by members of family
for having wrongfully exercised his
functions as executor. On the other
hand, it is natural that the family
of the late Mr. James should be
averse to selling the estate at pres-
ent. The moral for the public in
the whole matter is that wills ought
to be carefully drawn up, and that
the duties of an executor cannot be
undertaken without anxiety.” These
comments were made May sth, 1877;
the sale took place August 2 sth,
1877. An application was made to
the Court the day before to stop
the sale, but Judge Molesworth re-
fused the application, as he said
the trustee, Mr. Isaac Evans, had to
use his own judgment as to the
time of exercising the powers he
was entrusted with of selling the
property.
The Bullengarook correspondent
of the “Express,” Sept. 2 9th, 1877,
must have had a bad liver. His
portraiture of elevated Bullengarook
is not inspiring : “Mr. Editor, this
Bullengarook is a dull place; a man
might as well be in Pentridge. The
only difference in living here is you
know we are free, slaving in ignor-
ance all the year. If you meet a
neighbour he can converse about
nothing beyond his own circle; that
is his own affairs and those of his
neighbours. If you go into politics
you have all the talk to yourself. If
you ask about the war (Russia v.
Turkey) they will ask “who is beat-
ing.” If you go into a bootmaker’s
shop, a blacksmith’s or any other
tradesman’s, you will And men who
can converse with you on any sub-
ject, but Bullengarook, thy name’s
enough. The sooner I leave you
the better, even should I earn my
bread by chimney sweeping.” After
such a gross libel on Bullengarook
whether the correspondent was muti-
lated or exterminated by the irate
Bullengarookites I have searched
diligently, but have found no record
of such.
But list to the joyous warble from
“Our Own,” in issue of same date :
“Thus with the year the seasons re-
turn,” sang Milton. Spring is de-
scending on us again in a shower of
shadowing roses in beautiful bloom
and green foliage. The rains of the
last fortnight have transformed the
face of nature in our district. The
dry, cheerless prospect has been


changed, vegetation bursting forth
into new life on every hand, grass
growing, corn shooting up at a rapid
pace, cattle browsing in the fields,
sheep nibling the fresh grass, lambs
frisking in the exuberance of their
happiness, and horses careering and
flinging their feet into the skies to
show their speed and power. Mother
earth has responded generously to
the generous soak, and is benevo-
lently pouring forth her products to
gladden and “confirm the trembling
year.” “Your Own,” and no doubt
many others, is desirous to acknow-
ledge the goodness and beneficence
cf the Being that has thus scattered
our fears and rebuked our murmurs
by the timely promise which those
rains have given us that th®re will
be “food for man and beast in the
land,” “abundance in our basket and
in our store.” The Pentland Hills
are now draping themselves in their
summer garb—a mantle of the most
exquisite green varied with every
shade of nature’s almost universal
color, so soft and so lovely to the
sense of sight and will appear in
their most attractive form for the
next two or three months. If the
travelling public knew the aethetic
pleasures and hygienic benefits
from a drive over our Pentlands
they would not be so supine about
a through line of railway from
Keilor road to Ballarat via Pentland
Hills. Thus discoursed the Myrn-
iong optimist, but the Bullengarook
pessimist failed to be impressed by
the charms of nature, that mantle
of exquisite green, &c. He fully
deserved to be mutilated or exterm-
inated.
Mr. Taubman, on his departure,
is honored. He is presented with a
gold watch and chain. Mr. J. E.
Crook made the presentation. Stress
was laid upon his etroius m connec-
tion with the erection of the State
school, to which he was one of the
largest contributors, and had collec-
ted more money for building than
any other person.
Deemed worthy of record, that
Mr. J. R. Crook had brought to the
district a handsome Arab horse, Ali
Baba, recently imported at great ex-
pense from India. Sept. 23rd 1876.
Oct. 13, 1877. Mr. Inspector
Rasse reported favourably to Edu-
cation Department respecting need
of a school at Rowsley, and one
would shortly be erected there, at
a place known as Goat Hill. Mr.
F. P. Boyle had been conducting a
school at Rowsley for some months,
and it was added that about 50
children would attend the new
school.
Nov. 3, 1277. Mr. David Rob-
ertson, of Lyle’s Creek, obtained a
22-lb fleece of unwashed wool from
one of his Leicester rams. The
length of staple shown to us was
13 inches.
Who would believe that organ
manufacture ever existed in the
Marsh, but it was so in 1877, and
strange to say, that Mr. John Camp-
bell, who was engaged in building
an organ, had no practical know-
ledge of organ building. He had
succeeded in getting the instrument
so far completed that tunes could
be played upon ft, but he was com-
pelled to abandon the undertaking
for want of funds. The organ was
of large size, and was said to be
creditable to the maker’s ingenuity.
Nov. 17, 1877. Presbyterian
Church property, at Parwan, was
sold to Education Department for
£l2O.
Obituary notice, Dec. 1, 1877.
Messrs. Crook, of Bacchus Marsh,
sustained a loss last week, by the
death of Nutleaf, the dam of the
celebrated Saladin. She was being
driven to Melbourne, on the way to
Wonga, and when near Melton she
broke away to get back to Marsh,
and injured herself so much on a
wire fence that she died. She only
had three foals, one being Saladin,
another filly by Robin, which was
nominated for Derby and Oaks of
next year, and a third, a colt by
Ashbourne. Nutleaf was 20 years
old, and was very fresh. She won
races at Bacchus Marsh as a three-
year-old, but was only raced at
three meetings.
The Commercial hotel has been
changed into a Coffee Palace. It has
a history. Mr. Ryan had enterprise
enough to purchase the building,
which was built by Mr. Daley for
an hotel, and had been rewarded by
securing a license for it without
the slightest difficulty. Opposition
was at one time afoot, but the resi-


dents seemed to think, as the house
was a large one, and would doubt-
less be respectably conducted, that
it would be less objectionable than
it had been during any part of its
existence. There was no doubt,
said the “Express,” that it added
to the business appearance of the
township, whatever might be thought
of the prettiness of seeing six hotels
all within sight of each other.
“Express” Files, 1878.
Early attempts at irrigation, Jan.
5, 1878. Mr. Crook’s irrigation
work, by means of a water gate in
the Lerderderg was in successful
operation during the preceding few
weeks, and good results were shown
in pasture paddocks. The gate was
an ingeniously designed affair, which
had cost much trouble and expense,
as provision had to be made to lift
it clear of floods. This was accomp-
lished by means of winch and pul-
ley, which lifted the gate on to the
top of the posts, and thus elevated
it above flood level. Much difficulty
had to be overcome in order to make
the gate act as a dam, as the water
escaped under it through the soft
silt. By means of sandbags, mas-
onry, &c., sufficient hold was ob-
tained, and the gate worked well.
It was so regulated by sluices that
it did not stop the flow of the
creek.
May 18, 187 8. A most interesting
article —“The Scottish Bard King,”
by “Austral,” and “The Scottish
Bard King,” is none other than
Robbie Burns, Scotia’s great poet,
and “Austral” none other than J.
H. Bowser, son of Sergeant-Major
Bowser, the family having formerly
resided in the Marsh. In same is-
sue, the “Express” comments —-
“Many of our readers will feel in-
terested in knowing that the article
“The Scottish Bard King,” was
written by Mr. J. H. Bowser, a not
long since pupil of the Bacchus
Marsh State School, and more re-
cently an apprentice at this office.
He is now in Scotland, engaged as
a reporter upon a newspaper there.”
Mr. J. H. Bowser has risen to
greater altitude since then, even
that of a representative of the
Fourth Estate. For years he has
been a member of the State House,
and has attained Cabinet rank. The
article in question fully repays pe-
rusal. Mr. Bowser, in those early
days, had acquired a most attractive
style in presenting what he had to
say. I quote a paragraph “Coin-
ing as I did from the Antipodes,
with the freshness of Victoria’s na-
tive beauty still new in my memory,
the solemn grandeur of Scotia’s
ruins, and the contemplation of
scenes from which spring the pedes-
tals of Britain’s fame—the memories
of her great men —would seem to
give force instinctively to the dig-
nity of the mother country, and to
command respect.’’ Poor rantin’,
roarin’, rovin’ Robbie’s end is de-
lineated in a few lines :—“Passing
out of the Globe we pause at the
spot—the fatal spot—where the too
easily influenced songsters, drowsy
and benumbed, on his return home
from a party one cold night, lay
down in a state of insensibility ;
“the dread prelude,” as Robert
Chambers has described it, “of the
sleep of death.”
A meteor was seen in different
parts of the colony, June 15th
187 8. A Mr. G. G. Pierce, an in-
habitant of Bacchus Marsh, thus
wrote ; Last Saturday, when driving
from Bacchus Marsh to Keilor rail-
way station by coach, I was startled
by the appearance of an extraordin-
ary meteor, moving northwards, and
leaving a brilliant, curved, tapering
train behind. It increased in bril-
liancy and volume until it burst,
appearing much larger than the sun,
and oblcng in shape. When it
burst it scattered fragments of red
and blue most beautiful to behold.
I heard no sound from explosion.
The prominent men of Bacchus
Marsh of the past. Mr. G. G. Pat-
erson, in his usual happy style,
made his debut as a lecturer, and
at once claimed file sympathy of
the audience by announcing himself
as a debtor who had come to meet
his creditors for the first time in
the hope of discharging his liabil-
ities in full. He then proceeded to
sketch the life and character of the
great American sailor preacher,
Father Taylor, from the time he
went to sea at seven, to his death
at age of eighty-one. He read sev-
eral critisms from different writers


who heard and were charmed with
the wonderful orator, and inter-
spersed the lecture with many quaint
anecdotes and sayings of Father
Taylor, passing from grave to gay,
and lively to severe, in a manner
both amusing and instructive to his
audience.
A prolonged controversy over Ed-
ucation Act, in “Express,” 1878, in
which “Observer,” J. G. Taylor,
“Fitz,” and “Auditor,” took part.
Controversy at a high level, but I
have to admire the judicial sum-
ming up of editor. The pros and
cons were unconscious partisans.
For years there had benn no more
devoted citizen of Bacchus Marsh
than Mr. James Young. In course
of time he removed elsewhere, and
apparently fell upon evil times, for
July 27, 1878, a subscription was
initiated to provide funds to place
a railing and headstone upon his
grave. He was buried in Nagambie
cemetery and his widow was anx-
ious that his grave should not be
left untended and unnoticed. .
Mr. Hugh Meikle, August 24th,
187 8, speaks : Sir, —I am not a mem-
ber of the Council, therefore what
I have got to say cannot be of much
account; but, as a friend of mine
once said, at a meeting of the- Pent-
land Hills, “It’s no muckle sense I
hae got, but what I hae ye are wel-
come tilt.” So here goes. It is the
opinion of many people that there
is gold at the bottom of the Marsh;
it is also my own belief, and why
should there not, seeing that there
is gold in all the creeks and rivers
running into it ? If there is not gold
there is coal on the Pentland Hills,
and I think the Government (the
only people’s Government we ever
had) would let us have the use of
one of the diamond drills if we
would only ask for it. Trusting the
Marsh people will see to this.
Beef in 1878. A 600-lb bullock,
bred by Mr. Michael O’Connell, of
Bacchus Marsh, was killed by Mr.
Simpson, butcher, and contained the
large amount of 5 6-lbs. of kidney
fat.
Mr. P. K. O’Hara, formerly of
Bacchus Marsh, afterwards assistant
in a State School at Collingwood,
issued a poem in book form, “The
Maid of Millewa.” The book was
really the first canto of the poem.
The editor of the “Express” indulges
in criticism ; “The local coloring is
far too slight. The versification is
smooth on the whole, but the ideas
lack verve, and the dramatic inter-
est of a complete tale is wanting.”
But in P. K. O’Hara, Cornelius
Mahoney, G. G. Paterson, and others,
what naturally clever men did Bac-
chus Marsh of the seventies possess.
Sept. 14, 1878. A note to the
effect that Mr. Andrew Connell, son
of Mr. J. Connell, of Bacchus Marsh,
for seven years head teacher of a
Footscray school, and at time of in-
formation being given was head-
teacher at Maryborough school, had
obtained splendid results in his
school (details were supplied). Honor
for Mr. W. T. Lewis, Head Teacher
of Bacchus Marsh School, that his
school had been inspected, by Mr.
T. Brodribb, M.A., and that in or-
ganisation, tone, discipline and in-
struction was easily the first in the
Inspector’s district.
I presume that Mr. “H. McF.” are
the initials of the Presbyterian Min-
ister of the time (Rev. Hugh Mac-
Farlane). “On Bacchus Marsh” is
the title of a poem appearing Sept.
21,. 1878 :
With slight poetic taste wert thou
so named,
Thou lovely valley, clothed with
emerald green.
With rippling streams and fair sur-
rounding hills,
A sweeter vale the eye nowhere
could greet;
Thy mountains girdling thee on all
sides round
Enclose a scene rich in all natures’
loveliness,
And fairer than the painter’s art
could trace.
Surveyed from Stamford Hill or
height of Maddingley,
Or other of the eminences all
around',
The eye rest upon a scene that
thrills the heart
With purest gladness. There, thy
lovely streams,
With willows fringed, flow swiftly
on their way.
Thy woods are vocal with the native
songsters’ lays.
Thy fields are clad with verdure,
and the herds


Of lowing cattle find a generous
store of food.
Thy pretty cottage homes, with gar-
dens neatly trimmed,
Proclaim the abodes of thrift of
comfort and content :
God’s blessing on the honest industry
of man.
There are thy church spires pointing
up to Heaven ;
Thy churches, though by name of
different creed,
Gather within them worshippers of
the one Good Lord,
Who humbly hope at length to meet
in Heaven.
The scene reminds me of old Scot-
land’s hills and dales,
Nor would I longer wish to call thee
Bacchus Marsh ;
But, linking Scottish and Australian
tongue
Henceforth “Strath Werribee” should
be thy name.
—H. M‘F.
Sept. 28, 1878 Those of our
readers who are not already aware
of the fact will hear with regret
that Mr. Thomas Cain, sen., a
very old colonist, and quite a patri-
arch, was accidentally killed on
Tuesday night, or early on Wednes-
day morning, by falling into, a
gravel pit at Darley on the banks of
the Lerderderg River, and within
a few yards of his own residence,
which adjoins those of two of his
sons (Messrs. Thos. Cain and Mar-
tin Cain). The deceased had been)
in the township on Tuesday at the
County Court and was last seen
alive at nearly twelve o’clock that
night, by Mr. Henry Worthy, who
parted with him at the corner of
the Gisborne road and the main
street. He lit his pipe for him, and
Mr. Cain seemed to be able to take
care of himself. He was a very ac-
tive, strong little man, notwith-
standing his great age (82 years),
and being somewhat self-willed he
was left more to his own care than
a man of his age usually is. His
absence from home on Tuesday night
did not create any alarm, but when
Wednesday wore away and he did
not return enquiries were made and
subsequently a search, carried on
during the whole night by about a
score of neighbours and by the local
police. They searched incessantly,
making minute examination of the
river and its neighborhood and also
of several growing crops. The
gravel pit in which the poor old
man was lying dead all the time
was not overlooked, but the body
was not seen until daylight on
Thursday, when the poundkeeper
(Mr. Hanson) found it. Some time
before the hat of deceased had been
found some distance off, and it ap-
pears he wandered about for some
time on the banks of the river, and
was making his way for the Darley
bridge when he fell into the gravel
pit, a distance of eight or ten feet.
He was found with his head buried
in the sand and his arms folded in
front of him. Apparently he had
not moved after his fall, which had
stunned him, and the shock caused
his death. Dr. Nolan’s evidence was
to this effect, as no bones were
broken. It is the general opinion
that the gravel pit should be fenced
off, as an old track leads to it, and
there is also a dangerous place
where an old metalled track leads
to the site where the Darley bridge
used to be. Of course the whole
locality is unavoidably a dangerous
one, owing to the banks of the
river being precipitous in places,
but the dangers ought to be reduced
as much as possible. Mr. Cain had
outlived his compeers, and was
necessarily but little known to the
present generation, but he enjoyed
the respect of everyone, not only
on his own account but as the head
of a family filling a large space in
our district. He is reported to havq
died worth a considerable sum of
money. He has left a widow and
four sons. The funeral took place
yesterday afternoon, when a long
procession wended its way to the
burying ground at the old unused
Catholic church situated at the east
end of the Marsh valley.
The editor and Mr. Cornelius
Mahoney, particularly in 187 8, have
many a tilt. The clash of opinion
makes excellent reading, both being
dexterous in the use of the pen. I
shall not trouble the reader with re-
ference to the debatable matter that
came under review, but one partic-
ular letter of Mr. C. Mahoney’s
catches my eye. Mr. Mahoney gen-
erally discoursed on the heavy side,


but there is a sly Hibernian humor
in the introduction of the said
epistle : —-“Sir, —Perceiving by the
editorial footnote that, like a New
Zealand Chief, you have kindly with-
drawn the taboo from your columns,
I venture once more —although al-
beit sore against the grain—to
trouble you with a little matter con-
nected with our mutual friends the
Council, which I hope will not hurt
their sensitive feelings. If any-
thing written by your humble ser-
vant should have so undesirable
effect by the powers I’ll hold myself
in readiness at a moment’s warning
to do penance with sackcloth and
ashes, and walk with peas in my
brogues from the Tullamore Cottage
to the Iron bridge school in flood
time, and back again, if I can.
Look at that now I”
Bacchus Marsh was not a Mutual
Admiration Society in the seventies.
I instance the report of a lecture of
Rev. Hugh McFarlane, Presbyter-
ian minister, for frank comment.
Neither the hall, the audience, nor
the lecturer was spared. The sub-
ject of lecture was Recollections of
Paris. It might be stated that the
editor was determined that the hall
should be enlarged and any oppor-
tunity he had he duly took advan-
tage of. “It is but seldom that a
lecturer attracts so large an audi-
ence in our township. Mr. McFar-
lane hardly came up to expecta-
tions. • This may be accounted for
by 'the disconcerting effect which the
extreme impassiveness of the audi-
ence would have upon a stranger.
It is a singular characteristic of
Bacchus Marsh audiences that they
are frequently as mute as a church
congregation, or as noisy as a Boxing
Night house in a London theatre.
The atmosphere of the hall was op-
pressive enough to devitalise any
audience, and spoil the “points” of
any lecturer. The windows were
all nailed up, except one small aper-
ture; the doors were carefully kept
closed all the time, and the audience
were left in much the same plight
as Bismarck is reported to have said
the Parisians were left during the
seige.” Shakespeare says we should
hold up a mirror to nature. Mr. Crisp
did so, and that is the way he
secured local reforms.
Oct. 12, 1878. The new bridge
over Werribee, at Maddingley, quite
finished. It was said to be a great
credit to the Shire and Shire Engi-
neer, Mr. W. E. Stanfield. The
contractor' was Mr. W. T. Pezet.
The iron work was made by Mr. W.
Marshall, of Bacchus Marsh. The
contract price was £B4O, but addi-
tional masonry, and lead guttering
increased it to £9OO. The bridge
was designed to carry a moving load
of 36 tons, and the breaking strain
was over 700 tons. The bridge gave
tho maximum of waterway, with the
minimum of expense. A full de-
scription of the structure was given
Messrs. Sharp & Sons, Melbourne,
supplied the Oregon and red gum,
but the sawn timber came from Mr.
Blake’s mills at Ballan.
Landed property in 1878. Mr.
Henry Vallence has purchased Mr.
P. Devereux’s property at Par wan,
at £36 per acre. This is an instance
of the value of land on the Bacchus
Marsh flats in 1878, not in 1916.
Note hymeneal. Nov. 16, 1878.
The marriage at Trinity Church,
Bacchus Marsh, of Miss Crook to
Mr. R. P. Russell, one of the Inspec-
tors of State Schools, attracted a
good deal of interest, as the display
was more than usually great. The
church was filled with spectators,
and the smart carriage and more
colonial buggies, made up a spec-
tacle which deserves a local chron-
icle. So ran the paragraph.
Further instalment of Broadlands
Estate history: Dec. 28, 1878:“ The
Broadlands estate has passed from
the possession of the James family
to that of the Hon. Henry Miller,
for the sum of £14,000, it is gener-
ally believed. About 15 months
back it was sold by the executor of
the late Mr. Henry James for
£20,100, the purchasers being the
elder members of the James family.
At that time the price was thought
to be a high one, although strangers
would have given £19,000 for the
property. The depreciation is
chiefly due to the low price for
stock.’’ The culminating stage of
the history of Broadlands is yet to
be written, when, instead of being
an area with much of its fertility
lying inert, it will become a verit-
able commercialised beauty spot of


orchards. Tullamore has been meta-
morphorized, and what has happened
to Tullamore should happ'en to that
extent of prodigality of soil known
as the “bottom end” of the Marsh.
A spasmodic dairy farm dotted here
and there is not to be the develop-
ment of Broadlands ; but productiv-
ity involves responsibility, and as-
suredly will there come the transi-
tion, when the bottom ■ end of the
Marsh will not have the appearance
of neglect, but flourishing ten-acre
orchards, with attractive dwellings,
will gladden the eye of the motorist
as he passes by, will ensure a com-
fortable livelihood for the owner of
the holding. Will increase the local
population, and raise the status of
Bacchus Marsh industrially and
from a general business point of
view. It is "high time that his last
stage of the history of the estate
was written. The history of Camp-
erdown has been the history of the
family of Manifolds : the immense
progress of Colac was due to some
concern at least from local land-
owners ; it has been to the disad-
vantage of Bacchus Marsh that the
proprietory of Broadlands has been
non-resident.
Church music, 1879. A letter by
“Music” caused quite a rumpus,
“Music” was of the opinion that if
the organist of Trinity Church
would practice organ playing more,
and try and forget the feathery
touch of the piano, the singing and
playing he was sure would be a
success, and would give more pleas-
ure to performer and hearers. Mr,
Boyle, at Presbyterian organ, also
came in for criticism, and advice
was submitted that if the playing
was a little faster the singers would
not drag, get flat, and in short the
result would bring him more credit.
The Baptist Church singing was des-
cribed as being tastefully conducted,
marked by smoothness and correct-
ness. Three or four heated letters
came in response, probably from the
outraged performers in question. I
should have noted that a branch of
the Provincial and Suburban Bank
had been just established in Bacchus
Marsh, and a letter appears in issue
of Jan. 25, 1878, that he Mr. Joseph
Francis Smith, manager of the new
branch, who had been alleged to be
“Music,” knew nothing of the author-
ship. The editor footnotes that
“Music” was not a resident of Bac-
chus Marsh, therefore the criticism
was probably to be accepted, having
no local bias.
Mr. Alfred Deakin, Feb. 15, 1879,
addresses his first meeting at Bac-
chus Marsh. In this record of the
history of Bacchus Marsh I have
studiously avoided touching upon
political matters. It is advisable to
do so, but I cannot resist referring
to Mr. Deakin’s reply to the vote of
thanks. He thanked the meeting for
their courteous hearing, and said he
was young and inexperienced; he
spoke openly ; perhaps he might
temper his views, but he did not
think he would change them.
Feb. 22, 1879. Messrs. Kyle and
Dryden, neighboring landowners on
the Upper Werribee, hit upon a
novel plan for destroying rabbits.
Strips of fibrous material were
dipped in melted brimstone, to
which was tied a piece of wire, and
by a string to the tail of a live rab-
bit, which was then sent into a bur-
row with the sulphur ignited. The
rabbit it was stated, travelled in as
far as he could before being over-
powered with the sulphur fumes,
and in this way, the suffocating
effects of the sulphur permeated the
burrows in a more thorough manner
than by any bellow’s process, and if
the outlets were stopped with tarred
wrapping paper, or any -similar
cheap material, the fumes killed
every living thing in the burrow.
It was admitted that the plan “at
first sight” seemed somewhat cruel.
A paragraph, April 1879, is
not uninteresting, even in 1916 :
We were very nearly having a sen-
sational parragraph for this week’s
issue, arising out of a visit paid by
a young man, a newcomer in Bac-
chus Marsh, to a place called the
Werribee Gorge, about six miles up
the river from Bacchus Marsh. He
climbed up the rocky banks there
on Saturday afternoon last, and
found, as some other visitors have
done, that it was not possible to
return by the way he had come, and
seemingly impossible to ascend to
the top. In this predicament a
youth who accompanied him report-
ed, on his return to Bacchus Marsh


in the evening, that he had left him.
As the night was cold, several of the
residents felt it their duty, to their
credit be it said, to go out and en-
deavor to help him in some way.
Accordingly about 20 persons
made the journey, including Ser-
geant Rogers and Mr. Lewis, of the
State school, the latter making hjs
second trip that day, at considerable
inconvenience, but he went as he
knew pretty well where to find the
missing young man. On arriving
at the spot it was found that he had
succeeded in getting to the top of
the river bank by cutting holes in
the soil, and was comfortably await-
ing daylight beside a fire. Never-
theless he was glad to get back to
Bacchus Marsh, and his letter of
thanks elsewhere to those who en-
deavoured to assist him in what
might have proved a very serious
difficulty requires this additional ex-
planation of the circumstances in
order to make it understood, and it
is at the same time pleasing to be
able to record that so many resi-
dents in Bacchus Marsh did a credi-
table act. The river banks are some
200 feet high, and the spot is one
that has often been spoken of as an
admirable site for a reservoir. “Cap-
tain Moonlite,” when a resident in
Bacchus Marsh, lectured in favor of
the scheme, of which he professed,
as claiming to be an associate of
the Society of Civil Engineers, to
be competent to judge.
April 2 6, 1879. As the wells in
Bacchus Marsh nearly all contained
a layer of decayed wood, some local
folk had an idea that the Marsh was
in reality a coal bed. Specimens of
deposit associated with a mineral,
obtained from a well 2 4 feet deep,
were forwarded to the School of
Mines, Ballarat. The following re-
port was received ; —“The mineral
appears to consist of woody matter,
partly covered with lignite, and
strongly impregnated with iron py-
rites, deposited by ferrunginous
waters. Similar deposits of pyrites
occur in fossil wood found in deep
leads of Ballarat and elsewhere. The
occurrence is interesting as illustra-
trative to the natural chemical ac-
tion in the comparatively recent de-
posits of the Bacchus Marsh valley
analogous to the action that has
taken place in far older deposits.”
The pipe of Bacchus Marsh was
blown out ; it was not a coal bed.
This is the way, in old days, that
a medical man was received journal-
istically in Bacchus Marsh. There
had been much dissatisfaction in re-
gard to previous medical attendance.
A public meeting had on one occa-
sion been called, and was largely at-
tended, to remove ( or rather to boy-
cott) one medico, and there was ex-
traordinary unanimity in the
speeches. “Dr. George Cecil Jack-
son, from New Zealand has become
a resident in Bacchus Marsh, and
we find by the British Medical Reg-
ister that he possesses following
qualifications. (These were stated).
As he is likely to meet a want long
felt in Bacchus Marsh, it is to be
hoped that the inhabitants will give
him every encouragement short of
getting severely ill to test his skill.”
Mr. P. K. O’Hara, schoolmaster
poet, June 28, 1879, publishes sec-
ond canto of ‘‘The Maid of Miliewa.”
The editorial criticism— “extremely
limpid poetry, but lacking dramatic
interest.” And further “Mr. O’Hars:
has so far succeeded in threading
the dramatic element through his
verses as to have excited interest
in the continuation of what he calls
“a poetic romance of our early days
as a colony”; and it is quite true,
as he says in the preface, that gen-
erosity of criticism and pecuniary
support should be given to promote
a something that no intellectual
lover of our young country should
wish to see crushed in the primitive
stages of its existence, therefore we
hope he will meet with all the sup-
port. he could wish for, so that it
may entirely rest with himself
whether his Maid of Miliewa, when
completed, will prove to be a spec-
imen worth preserving of Victorian
poetic literature, or will be laid
aside as a clever piece of versifying
lacking poetic fire.”
I have already stated that politi-
cal history cannot be recorded. I
: egret that a resume of those public
questions that caused such stirring
times must be passed by default. I
notice particularly an account of an
epistolary bout between the Hon.
Robert Harper and Mr, Thomas
Anderson. The reformers, Messrs.


Mark Kyle and Thomas Anderson
must have worked like Trojans in
the advocacy of principles which
they considered would, under legis-
lative enactment make for the bet-
terment of the colony. I must de-
sist, however, to refer to those strug-
gles conducted with much party bit-
terness. Columns of the “Express”
are given to individual meetings,
and the most succinct review of
same would prolong this record of
Bacchus Marsh history into abysses
of continuity.
A note from Ballan, July 12,
1879 : “They say Christianity is dy-
ing out, I don’t see it. Last week
three gentlemen met in a store.
[Note. —It’s always a store : no pub.
over the way, oh, no ! ] One gentle-
man remarked that it was time to
travel, the night was frosty, and he
had no overcoat. Straightway a
genial resident said “Take this,”
and peeled off his own coat. An-
other traveller present (no Christian)
seeing the disposition of the gent.,
remarked that he, too, had to travel,
but had no coat. Without more
ado, off came the undercoat, and the
self-sacrificing saint strolled home
shivering, but happy. We're all like
that in Ballan.”
Captain Moonlite —-July 19, 1879.
The “Age” reports as follows :—•
“Since the discharge from Pent-
ridge of the notorious Egerton bank
robber, Scott, alias Captain Moon-
lite, he has been kept under con-
stant surveillance by the police-force,
who during the course of his lec-
tures in town have noticed that he
kept close company with three
young men all well-known to the
police. Scott in one of his lectures
complained of the way in which he
was watched by the police, but dur-
ing the past few days circumstances
have been brought to light which on
Tuesday caused a member of the
detective force to swear an informa-
tion against Scott and his three
friends, and warrants were at once
issued for the arrest of the quart-
ette. The police are very reticent
on the subject and refuse to divulge
the nature of the offence for which
it is now sought to arrest Scott. It
is alleged that Captain Moonlite and
his friends have left Melbourne, and
made their appearance in the Kelly
district, but little importance is at-
tached to this rumour.” Scott and
a companion gave themselves up at
Clunes, and state that the charges
against them are unfounded.
Myrniong venture in blood stock.
August 16, 187 9 : “Mr. Geo. Grant,
of the Pentland Hills, has purchased
from Mr. T. Brookless, the imported
Clydesdale entire, Scotland Yet, for
950 guineas. Scotland Yet is a bay
horse, five years old. The breeders
of horses in the district, to which
this celebrated horse is being taken,
will appreciate the spirit displayed
by Mr. Grant.”
Erection of schoolhouse, Nov. 22,
1879, at Rowsley. Land was pre-
sented to Education Department by
Mr. Thomas Manly. Contractors,
Messrs. R. Reid & P. Murphy, of
Bacchus Marsh.
Bushranging, Nov. 22, 1879.
Final episode in Captain Moonlite’s
career. The Kelly gang evading
capture for over twelve months had
an encouraging effect upon criminal
class. Six men, fully armed, stuck
up the Wantabadgery Station, 25
miles east of Wagga Wagga. Leader
of gang, Captain Moonlite. The man-
ager of station proving intractable,
had to apologise, after receiving sev-
eral kicks, upon his knees. He was
ordered to the roof of the building
to keep watch. The hands, 19 in
all, were bailed up, and kept in
durance for ten hours. The mail-
boy arrived; he was at once secured,
and the mail appropriated. One of
the inmates managed to escape, and
hastened to the police at Wagga.
A hot contest between . police and
bushrangers for two hours and a
half. The four police were forced
to retire ; they were subsequently
reinforced by five policemen, but
the marauders had decamped. The
police in pursuit. The offenders
were overtaken two miles from
Wantabadgery station. The fight
took place near the hut, lasted about
an hour, and was witnessed by a
large number of persons, who looked
on from hills in the vicinity. On©
of bushrangers shot dead, the rest
took shelter in hut. Another was
shot dead in hut, and a third wound-
ed in arm ; two surrendered and
the remaining one escaped. Captain
Moonlite at trial makes one of his


plausible speeches. He had beer-
refused rations at Wantabadgery
station, and had had nothing to eat
for 48 hours —statements which were
proved to be utterly untrue, as he
had been living on the hospitality
of the Riverina people. After Lance-
field bank robbery, he had promised
the police that he would live hon-
estly, and taking his word, they no
longer kept him under surveillance.
Instead of acting upon his word, he
organised a band of desperadoes in
Victoria, and about four weeks later
crossed the Murray six miles above
Albury. Having no money, they in-
duced a boatman to row them over
the river gratis. The boatman, not-
icing that the party carried revol-
vers, concluded that they were bush-
rangers, but fearing that they might
pay him another visit, refrained
from giving information to Albury
police, until thirteen days had
elapsed. One of the police who was
wounded while attacking the bush-
rangers subsequently died. At his
trial, Scott (Moonlite) showed won-
derful self-assurance, and in truth
might be said to have been insolent
to magistrate, which led the latter
to say that if any lawyer had used
same language he would have him
turned out of the court. “Well, your
Worship,” said Moonlite, mid great
laughter, ‘T wish you would turn
me out of it, too, and if I thought
you would, I would use much
stronger language,” An outline of
the defence, as made by Scott, is
given, Dec. 6, 1879, extracted from
Sydney “Town and Country.” The
prisoner addressed the court for an
hour with fluency and force, and ex-
hibited signs of considerable emo-
tion at times. As you read the ut-
terances of the criminal (for SCott
was nothing else) you can only come
to one conclusion, that in low cun-
ning he was an adept. A sketch of
his career is given. He was a native
of London. His father was a min-
ister of the Church of England, in
which he was carefully trained. It
was originally intended that he
should study for the church, but
being of a very lively disposition,
his father allowed him to choose
his own calling. In 185 6, at 11
years of age, he was a cadet on
board H.M.S. Britannia, and a relic
—a Bible—given to the lad by his
acectionate mother, has a certain
pathetic significance :—From Bessie
Scott, to her son, A. G. Scott, wish-
ing that he may read, mark, learn,
and digest these blessed contents.
Born in Dublin, 1845, baptised,
1846.” In 1859, Scott is found
fighting under Garibaldi in Italy.
On August 19, 1861 Scott left Lon-
don for Auckland, N.Z., in the ship
Black Eagle, as a practical Engi-
neer. In New Zealand he enlisted
as a volunteer, and joined the cam-
paign against the tribes of revolted
Maories, and continued until he was
wounded, being shot in both legs.
The slugs were extracted, but they
left their marks. The next move
was to United States, where he
joined Northern Army. In 1867, he
turned up in Melbourne for a short
time, whence he went on a cruise
(probably of “blackbirding”) to
Sydney in Captain Pile’s schooner,
and, as the latter had a good opin-
ion of Scott, he took him to his
own house, where he resided for a
short time. Soon after, in Sydney,
he was sentenced, on 21st Dec.,
18 70, at Darlinghurst sittings, to
18 months’ imprisonment in Mait-
land gaol for uttering a cheque.
Two charges of forgery followed, 12
and 18 months hard labor, current,
being the sentence. This was in
1871. 30th March, 1872, brought
back to Darlinghurst from Mait-
land, under remand, charged with
assault and robbery. He behaved
himself well in gaol, but his mind
got deranged ; he was sent to Par-
ramatta Lunatic Asylum, and soon
recovered. He was discharged April
6th, 1872, receiving his full remis-
sion from Parramatta gaol. He then
went to Melbourne, and having ex-
cellent introductions, which he ob-
tained from his parents in the mean-
time, and being a plausible fellow,
he was appointed lay reader by
Bishop Perry, and was sent to Bac-
chus Marsh to assist Rev. Thomas
Cooper. Such is extract from Syd-
ney “Town and Country,” but
chronology is not quite correct, for
editor of “Express” notes that it
was about middle of 186 8 that Scott
came to the Marsh; further, he was
not appointed a lay reader. “He
acted as one, apparently by author-


ity of Rev. H. W. Cooper, who had
ritualistic aspirations, and liked
plenty of assistance in conducting
church services.” Scott was execut-
ed on 20th January, 1880, in Darl-
inghurst gaol.
We are hastening on in this re-
view of the history of the Marsh.
1879 was most exciting from
a political point of view. Local
party feeling was intense. Mr. T.
Anderson and Mr. Mark Kyle were
fairly on the warpath. No half
measures with these gentlemen. Mr.
T. Anderson was not slow with the
pen nor Mr. Mark Kyle with speech.
Mr. Thos. Anderson tackled big
game. Mr. Deakin had been elected
for West Bourke, but through some
informal proceedings at a booth,
chivalrously resigned. A new elec-
tion was held, and Mr. Robert Har-
per was returned. The Education
Act caused much mixing up of
things. I would like to dilate upon
those stormy election meetings, but
I pass on.
“Express” Files, 1880.
I find in early part of 18 80 file a
fine series of articles—-eight in all —
on Gippsland and its Lakes, by
“T.G.P.” and interpret the initials
as those of the late Mr. T. G. Pearce.
The editor, in a sub-leader, refers
to “the papers descriptive of
Gippsland, which have enlivened our
columns, and pleased our readers
for some weeks past.” The regret
is that the late Mr. Pearce did not
find more time for the exercise of
much literary capability. I have
pleasurable memories of his lectures
on Shakespeare, the Panama Canal,
Shackleton’s expedition to South
Pole, &c. The late Mr. Pearce was
intellectually strong, and was a
shrewd business man in every respect.
The series of articles descriptive of
Gippsland, must have been written
when Mr. Pearce was in manhood’s
glow. Perhaps the expression has
a suspicion of being a little florid,
but there is no doubting the ability
that is conspicuous throughout. The
Gippsland “Times,” Sale, a journal
of repute remarks that the writer
of the “impressions,” as recorded in
the ‘Express’ has an observant eye,
and his letters are far beyond the
average of such lucubrations in
style, and freshness of vigor of
description.” T.G.P. returns from his
tour, and thus the eulogy of “home.”
I like it very much ; “Returning
home, the next afternoon, on arrival
at the top of the hill which over-
looks the level tract of Bacchus
Marsh, we pulled up our buggy
horse (we had rechristened him
“Tanjil” as a memorial of our trip),
and halted a moment. Below us
spread out a prospect something
similar to that which must have
greeted the eyes of Abraham and Lot
of old, when, from the lofty Judean
range, they gazed eastward upon
the rich green valley of the Jordan,
lying under the shadow of Moab’s
nills. The well-known pasturages
of the east end of the Marsh lay
at our feet ; lines of timber among
which Buvelot might find endless
studies in gum trees, marked out
the courses of the various streams;
the fields were dotted over with
cattle : distance lent enchantment to
the cluster of houses at Hopetoun,
while, as a background to the scene
rose the hills on either side of the
far-reaching vale of Parwan. “We
have gazed upon nothing fairer in
all our travels,” I said, the poet’s
conviction being forced upon me —
“A man’s best things are nearest
him.
Lie close about his feet.
Though ’tis the distant and the dim
He ever strives to greet.”
“Ah,” replied one of my friends
“If but where yonder white road
winds along,, a noble river like the
‘Mitchell’ took its course, there
would be no place in Victoria com-
parable with this.” “And do you
think,” I replied, “that we are doing
our* best with the resources we have
at command ? Look at our two small
rivers sending daily to the sea those
priceless waters, the conservation
and distribution of which would
clothe in perennial verdure this fer-
tile spot and endow our town with
all the beauty of a Damascus. Is it
not a fact, that the future prosper-
ity of Bacchus Marsh depends upon
the attainment of two objects, viz.,
the speedy completion of railway
communications with the metropolis,
and the solution of the awfully dif"
flcult problem of how to raise water


twelve feet ? With the gradual fall
of our rivers, a system of weirs and
locks might be established, the cost
and supervision of which would be
nominal, in comparison with the
enormous benefit to be 'derived by
their erection, immense sheets of
water would be thrown back for
miles, and who knows,” we contin-
ued, in a sudden burst of inspira-
tion, ‘‘Who knows, the day may
come, which shall witness the ad-
vent of the Bairnsdale rowing club,
boat and crew arriving per special
train, for the purpose of meeting in
friendly rivalry the rowers of Bac-
chus Marsh and Ballan, upon the
conserved waters of the upper Wer-
ribee ?” “That will do,” said my
philosophical friend, shaking the
reins, “That will do, go on ‘Tan-
jil.’ ”
Addendum to Broadlands history,
May 22, 1880 : —“Mr. W. Grant’s
Hopetoun property has been ab-
sorbed by the Broadlands estate,
Bacchus Marsh, now owned by the
Hon. Henry Miller. The price paid
is a moderate one (£4O per acre)
considering the value of the land
and the improvements upon it. Mr.
Miller seems to have a strange crav-
ing for adding to the Broadlands
estate, as other properties are under
offer to him. It is said that he in-
tends to make the place a home-
stead for one of his sons, and that
a handsome, house will be erected,
and extensive establishment kept up.
If so, the district may not suffer
from the buying-up process, and cer-
tainly Mr. Miller has spent a good
deal of money in Bacchus Marsh,
since he purchased Broadlands, in
fencing and cultivating.”
Sept. 11, 1880. Great flood in
Bacchus Marsh. Heavy rainfall from
the S.E. continued the whole after-
noon and evening. Both rivers car-
ried and dispersed over the flat
larger bodies of water than they
had done, except on one or two pre-
vious occasions. Flood of Oct. 1861,
and that of 1874, not so great. The
Lerderderg overflow had never
reached so high up the township be-
fore. A number of residents, in-
cluding Messrs. Pearce, Hollis, Slack,
Unsworth, Bottle, Mrs. Reid, and
others, had to leave their properties,
and some took refuge in Mechanics’
Institute. From John Cunningham’s
down to Woolpack the road was one
sheet of water. Mr. Crook, at
Woolpack, had some 60 valuable
racehorses in the stable, so that
prospects for a time were not too
pleasant. Many residents of lower
part of Marsh sought shelter in
Woolpack. The Woolpack bridge
was washed away. Mr. Simon’s or-
chard was covered as well as ad-
joining areas belonging to Messrs.
White, Kerr, Richardson, Green,
and Scott. Had either river risen
another six inches the whole town
would have been under water, from
Stamford Hiil to the Woolpack. In-
cidents of adventure and peril dur-
ing flood were numerous. Chief
among these was the removal (If
not rescue) of Mr. Cornelius
Mahoney, from his residence, situ-
ated between the two rivers, and
surrounded by blind gullies, which
were full of water. The flood was
18 inches deep in the house. As
the situation of the family was per-
ilous, some of the township residents
determined on Sunday morning to
give Mr. Mahoney the opportunity
of leaving by going to him with a
dray and structure —half-boat and
half raft, and made out of some
packing cases and barrels. On arri-
val near the house attempts were
made to throw Mr. Mahoney a rope
by weighting the end of it, but these
efforts proved too tedious for the ad-
venturous persons present, so Mr.
Thomas Anderson undertook to
swim across the deep current, and
in this way communication was
established by means of a rope. The
boat was next attached to it, with
Mr., Basham as navigator, and the
Mahoney family were all brought
off safely but well soaked. Mr.
Robert Simpson made a splendid
rescue, from Werribee suspension
bridge, of a young man named
Mealand, who was drifting out into
the Werribee, having been carried
off his feet while searching for rab-
bits. The greatest sufferer was Mr.
Jeremiah Ryan, who lost two miles
of fencing and had 40 acres torn
up and silted over. Mr. Pearce lost
a kiln of 20,000 bricks. One good
effect of flood was said to be that
hundreds of rabbits were drowned,
and their burrows destroyed. Mr.


W. McDonald, lower down the stream
lost 70 acres of grass, in addi-
tion to whole being badly
silted over. The Broadlands
estate estimated loss at £lOOO. The
accumulation of flood waters, at ex-
treme end of Bacchus Marsh val-
ley, formed a torrent which a resi-
dent in neighborhood describes as
sufficient to float the Royal George.
It was estimated as being 30 feet
deep over adjacent paddocks. Some
of Mr. Miller’s sheep (of which he
lost 200) were deposited high up in
trees. A characteristic letter, from
Mr. Cornelius Mahoney, appears in
issue : —Sir, —Will you kindly allow
me space in your widely circulated
journal to express my heartfelt
thanks to following gentlemen, viz.:
Messrs. G. Wood, E. R. Basham, T.
Anderson, R. Reid, T. Heath, J.
Kerr, W. Luscombe, W. Robertson,
G. F. Mclntosh, R. Shackell, R.
Bence, P. Leahy, J. R. Crook, J.
Voysey, J. Simpson and Sergeant
Rogers, for having, on Sunday morn-
ing, devised means, and at personal
risk to themselves, pressed the same
forward to a successful issue, namely,
the rescue of myself, wife and seven
children, from a position of great
peril, i.e., having been hemmed in
by a raging torrent caused by the
flood waters of Werribee and Ler-
derderg rivers ? I feel that words
of mine are weak in expressing what
is due to the manly promptitude,
courage and humanity of the above
gentlemen. I and mine shall ever
bear their noble conduct in grateful
remembrance. —Yours very truly,
Cornelius Mahoney.
You have to credit the Irishman
with the happy faculty of always
being able to chastefully express
sentiment befitting the occasion. Mr.
Mahoney was evidently an adept.
I notice in following number of
“Express” that Messrs. T. Anderson
and E. R. Basham were presented
each with a gold locket, suitably
inscribed, for their services.
“Express” Files, 1881.
Jan. 15th, 1881. “It is reported
from mouth to mouth in Bacchus
Marsh that Mr. Jeremiah Ryan has
sold the whole of his land in Bac-
chus Marsh to the Hon. Henry Mil-
ler for £17,000. Mr. Ryan retains
his township properties, and a small
farm on McKenzie Flat road. The
above price is said to include all
stock, implements and crop, and
covers a purchase of about 1,200
acres. If the news should be true
it will be matter for regret that an-
other employer of labor, with all
the assistance to a township which
an establishment such as Mr. Ryan’s
is, shall have disappeared into the
absentee-managed estate of Broad-
lands, for although that estate will
employ labor and Mr. Miller’s son
may reside on the estate some day,
as talked about, it is almost impos-
sible that any large estate can be
as beneficial to the varied but in-
dependent interests of a township as
three or four smaller ones would be,
and not the least ominous feature
of these earth hunger gulps of Mr.
Miller’s is that each one increases
his octopus range of neighborship,
so that now some six or eight other
properties may be regarded as next
in succession to be got rid of, like
Henry the Eighth’s wives, and it
may not be long before the Court-
house and the churches are the only
things not purchased by Mr. Miller,
who may be expected to issue a sort
of weekly prices current for Bac-
chus Marsh properties.”
Two gold medals were presented
to Messrs. Daniel Ward and Robert
Simpson for their efforts in saving
the life of Charles Mealand during
the flood of September.
March 26, 1881, Mr. Michael
O’Connell, of Bacchus Marsh, suc-
ceeded on carrying off the first prize
for English barley at the grain show,
held by the National Agricultural
Society in Messrs. G-oldsboroughs’
wool stores. The prize was a gold
cup, valued at forty guineas, and
entry had to consist of as many as
twenty sacks of barley. The cup
was presented Excellency the
Governor, who complimented Mr.
O’Connell upon the excellence of
the barley he had shown, and upon
the manner he had prepared it for
exhibition, as the barley was well
cleaned and placed in new sacks,
lined with blue cloth. Its weight
was 5 BJ-lbs. to the bushel.
March 2 6th, 1881. Account of
handsome stained glass windows
placed in Holy Trinity Church. The-


large two-light window, above chief
entrance, with the three small round
windows above it, was the gift of
Mr. Samuel Thomas Staughton, and
in memory of his father, the late
Mr. Simon Staughton. The windows
along northern wall represent
six of the Apostles, with two gri-
saille, or decorated windows, flank-
ing them at each end of the church.
These two latter were placed there
by Mr. W. Grant, lately of Hope-
toun, in memory of his brothers
Dr. John Grant, and Henry George
Grant, who are buried in church-
yard surrounding the church. Two
windows were supplied by Mr. Geo.
Wood, in memory of deceased rela-
tives of the late Mrs. Catherine
McLeod, formerly of Talllsker, Scot-
land, who is buried in the adjacent
churchyard, and was a highly re-
spected resident of district, and mem-
ber of congregation up to the time
of her death in 186 3. The artistic
and mechanical skill displayed by
Messrs. Ferguson & Urie, in the
erection of these windows, was the
subject of much favorable comment,
a note was made to the effect that
it was worth mentioning that a
Bacchus Marsh native, Mr. A. Mur-
doch, executed nearly the whole of
the work, the only part he had not
done being the actual painting of
design, but the actual placing of the
glass and lead work had been per-
formed by him as well as the fix-
ing of the windows. A handsome
pulpit and reading desk, with hand-
some brass brackets for holding
lamps, and with suitable cushions
were placed in the church by the
order of the Hon. W. J. Clarke, in
memory of his deceased wife.
April 2nd, 1881. There is an old
saying, ‘‘don’t count your chickens
till they are hatched.” The old
proverb came to mind as I came
across the following :—“We have
good authority for stating that Mr.
Albert Miller will shortly become a
resident of Bacchus Marsh, as the
house lately occupied by Mr. Jere-
miah Ryan is being got ready for
him, and it is reported that in a
year or two a two-story house, of
twenty rooms, will be built in con-
nection with it and a carriage
drive skirting the north bank of
the Lerderderg, from the main road
near the brewery.”
Denominational harmony, April
27th, 1881. Holy Trinity was duly
consecrated by the Right Rey. Dr.
Moorhouse, Bishop of Melbourne;
the form of petition, asking the
Bishop to consecrate the church for
divine worship being read by Mr.
Molesworth Greene. At conclusion
of lecture, delivered by Bishop
Moorhouse in the evening, Rev.
Hugh McFarlane, Presbyterian Min-
ister, of Bacchus Marsh, moved the
vote of thanks, who testified as to
the interest of the local Presbyter-
ians in the visit of the Bishop. The
latter cordially accepted the kindly
feelings expressed by the Rev. Mac-
Farlane. At a Presbyterian Church
gathering, shortly preceding conse-
cration of Trinity Church, the Pres-
byterian pastor referred to his sin-
cere appreciation of his brother min-
ister, Rev. A. J. McCausland. The
latter was just as emphatic that it
was delightful to be associated in
religious work with the Rev, Hugh
McFarlane.
April 21, 1881. Mr. and Mrs,
George Wood and Miss Wood, who
were to sail on a visit to England
by the mail steamer Hydaspe, were
farewelled. The presentation to Mr.
and Mrs, Wood took the form of a
silver fruit epergne, valued at £SO.
A gold chain and pendant were
presented to Miss Wood. Nice things
were said of the guests. Mr. J. E.
Crook was in the chair. In reality
it did not seem as if any local func-
tion could be held without Mr.
Crock taking control. Whether Rab-
bit Extermination meeting. Race
meeting, Church meeting, State
school meeting, he presides. He
must have had the happy knack of
being all things to all men, and his
life seems to have been one of con-
tinued usefulness. At school gath-
ering he must have been very tact-
ful, and I noticed that in his intro-
ductory speech to school break-up
he was ever ready to stimulate the
school staff, recognising this or that
meritorious result, and in his con-
tact with the district inspector he
was thoughtful enough to bring un-
der that official's notice the good
work that the local teacher had per-
formed. As I scan the files these
citizens of the past again live ; their


desire to serve the public welfare
is there stamped indelibly in this
printed record of early Bacchus
Marsh. Mr. Tom Kissock bursts
forth now and then; curt —he girds
at the editor for the inevitable foot-
note —but he writes common sense.
Mr. Peter McCluskey’s sale of stock
and effects has to take place ; poor
Peter has fallen on evil times.
Mr. Jeremiah Ryan has left the lo-
cality; Mr. and Mrs. Wood and Miss
Wood have now gone. But Mr. J.
E. Crook remains. Mr. Wood at his
farewell is modest, but he believes
that every word said of Mrs. Wood
she deserves—“ His wife was the best
woman in the world, never mind
where the next best was.”
A ploughing match between
Messrs. George Cox and Joseph
Lodge was held upon Mr. Thomas
Cain’s land, near Bacchus Marsh,
June 25th, 1881, the stake being £5
each. The match excited great in-
terest, as the day was fine and no
ploughing match had been held for
years. The judges gave the award
to Lodge, but the ploughing was not
considered to be of first-class match
form. A comment was made that
probably the day was not far dis-
tant when ploughing would be super-
seded by some method of breaking
up the soil by electricity, that
double-furrow ploughs would take
the place of singles as com-
pletely as mowing machines had dis-
placed scythes.
The advent of the boxthorn, Aug-
ust 13, 1881 : 1916 would like to see
it kicked out bag and baggage. In
a paragraph the advantages of an
African boxthorn hedge are pointed
out. One of its most salient pro-
perties is duly expatiated upon that
it is indestructible. History has pro-
ved in our midsts that the boxthorn
has more fecundity than the rabbit.
The rabbit is noxious, so is the box-
thorn, which Mr. Le Couteur, so far
back as 18 81, introduced into this
community, and alas, it is worse
than the sparrow. . The paragraph
thus runs :—Mr. Le Couteur, who
has all the aptitude for the culture
of seeds, and the development of
new branches of husbandry, which
is natural to all Jersey men, has of
late devoted himself to the culture
of the African boxthorn, for sale in
the form of seed and young plants.
We are happy to state that merit
in this case is receiving reward, as
he has supplied orders for New Zea-
land, South Australia, and even West
Australia.” Mr. Le Couteur, it is
added, was one of the first persons
to introduce the cultivation of lu-
cerne to this district, also chicory.
Horse flesh in Bacchus Marsh dis-
trict in early eighties : Mr. James
Bourke, of Coimadai, sold his Clydes-
dale horse, Black Douglass, at Mel-
bourne show for 180 guineas.
Earlier in the year (1881) Mr. L.
Dugdale, of Pentland Hills, disposed
of a colt for 400 guineas. Mr. Jeff-
rey, of Coimadai, frequently gained
prizes for his stock at important
Agricultural Shows.
Mr. Henry Stevenson, of Niddine
—his frank opinion of Bacchus
Marsh producer, August 24th, 1881:
‘‘l have often called the Marsh
farmers a parcel of donkeys, when
they sell their fine malting barley
for 2/6 or 3/6 when they might con-

for it. They are a long while putt-
ing their shoulders to the wheel and
helping themselves.”

March 15, 18 82. I have had to
scan a lot of issues, but find noth-
ing to extract. This in quoted date
however : “Some bones were
found when excavating banks of
Werribee in connection with Wool-
pack bridge, which were sent to
Professor McCoy by Mr. W. PtObert-,
son, who received the following re-
ply : —-Professor McCoy, Director
of the National Museum, begs to
acknowledge with thanks the receipt
of the bones forwarded by Mr. Rob-
ertson to the Museum. They are
the bones of Phascolomys Pliocenus
(wombat) and have been added to
■Museum’s collection as Mr. Robert-
son’s donation. The species is an
extinct one, and the specimens are-
an interesting addition to the Mus-
eum.
April 2 9th, 1882 : On Thursday
last, Mr. W. Grant, of the Border
Mill, Bacchus Marsh, and Mr. W.
Anderson, of the Border Store wait-
ed upon the Minister of Lands to
ask for the grant of a site at Mad-
dingley for the proposed new agri-


cultural show yards. The area asked
for was eight acres, as it was held
to be desirable to have plenty of
room for implements and machinery.
The Minister at once granted the
request.
June 24, 1882 : I come across the
record of a marriage, that to me has
much significance in regard to the
fact that four sons are now serving
at the front. In Trinity Church,
June 21, 1882, the eldest daughter
of the Rev. A. J. McCausland (the
incumbent) w r as married to Mr.
Frank Crook, third son of Mr. J. E.
Crook, of Bacchus Marsh. The
church was appropriately decorated
for the occasion, and being filled
with friends and spectators, presen-
ted an animated appearance. The
marriage service was conducted by
the Rev. A. J. McCausland, and the
Rev. H. F. Scott, of Footscray. The
congregation presented to Miss Mac-
Causland a handsome marble clock,
with a suitable inscription, as a
mark of esteem, and some recogni-
tion of her many years’ services as
honorary organiste of the church.
The following letter appears in same
issue ; Sir, —My wife and myself de-
sire, through your valuable columns,
to express our intense sense of, and
gratitude for, the manifestations of
love and affection for our daughter
on the occasion of her marriage in
the numerous handsome, valuable,
individual presents showered upon
her as tokens of warm and loving
hearts, as well as the presentation of
a beautiful clock by a few special
friends of the Marsh, and a purse
of sovereigns from the loving hearts
at Melton. —A. J. McCausland.
I have quoted more than once the
picturesque writings of the late Mr.
Cornelius Mahoney. Here is an-
other sample, the ending to a long
epistle, October 7, 1882 : "I am quite
aware that the Shire Council, to my
cost, is unfortunately empowered to
administer several other Statutes be-
sides the Local Government Act.
Their abominable botchery, stupid-
ity, and obstinacy in the abusive ad-
ministration of the Thistle Act ab-
surdity, until ruled out of court,
cost me £4O and upwards, to no
good end. Hence I have intense
distrust in administration of laws
by inexperienced pachydermatas.
I think it is time I brought this to
a close, but ere I cease I must give
you to understand a truce was pro-
posed until Christmas between the
Shire Council and the ratepayers, to
the end that they should mutually
fulfil the Scripture, living in Chris-
tian charity for the specified time.
It is written : "If thine enemy smite
thee on the right cheek, turn unto
him also thy left, and thou shalt
heap coals of fire upon his head.” I
carried out my part of the pro-
gramme the other day, and like a
saint presented my right cheek to
the man of business, who gave it a
sounding thwack ip the shape of a
half-crown fine; then, with the hu-
mility of one of Mr. Cain’s lambs,
I turned my left and received ditto,
repeated in similar shape. When
my turn came to heap up the coals
of fire, they jibbed, kicked, plunged;
’twas too hot they said, and begged
to be excused till Christmas. Finally
they meanly bolted like a lot of
scorched kangaroos through a bush-
fire, and, faith, I believe some of
them are running yet. Broken faith
in them is their sense of equity. Can
we safely trust administration of
laws on which our lives, liberty, and
character depend, to such hands ?
Can we ?”
The year 1882. The columns of
"Express” are taken up largely with
irrigation and railway matters. The
intention first was thpt the Marsh
itself should be connected with the
main line, passing along the plateau,
by means of a cockspur passing-
down Fisken or Graham street. It
was thought impossible if main line
were brought down into the Marsh
that it could regain the high coun-
try. But Engineer Cussen evidently
accomplished the seemingly impos-
sible, and he must get all credit for
the detour. The branch line would
have cost £15,000 to £20,000, and
entailed with it an annual expendi-
ture of £IOOO or more, which an-
nual expense would be all profit
added to the main line, whether the
branch would have paid or not. The
Marsh business man was afraid that
the locating of the station at Mad-
dingley might mean the shifting of
business to that locality. The devel-
opment is that of late the town has
been growing '■ otherwise than to-


wards the station.

“Express” Files, 1883.
Feb. 10th 1883 : Great flood in
Parwan Valley. I give the account
in full:- —A tropical storm of a vio-
lence unequalled in this district
swept down the Parwan valley on
Thursday night and caused one
death, also carried all fences away,
three or four bridges, several stacks
of hay and grain, some cattle, and
altogether inflicted damage to a to-
tal, probably, of £lO,OOO. This val-
ley rises in the Ballan district at
Yaloak Vale, is bounded north and
south by precipitous hills of great
water catchment area, and extends
for about thirteen miles, by a width
of half a mile to three-quarters. It
is divided about midway into two
portions of a gorge at Rowsley,
some eight miles from Bacchus
Marsh, and it was at the head of
this gorge that the greatest accumu-
lation of water occurred, and just
here a man named John Barry re-
sided with his wife and five children
and his aged mother and father. At
about 2 a.m. on Friday morning the
rain descended upon the surrounding
hills with vmocity described as
the bursting of a series of water
spouts, and in a very short time the
storm waters accumulated to such an
extent that Barry and his family
could not leave their house; and as
the waters rose they had to take re-
fuge in the roof rafters, having to
break through the ceiling for the
purpose. The house was the centre
of a flood eight feet deep, and had
it not been substantially built of
brick for the most part the whole
of the inmates must have been
drowned. As it was Mr. Barry, sen.,
aged 7 6 years, was unable to hold
on to the rafters until the flood sub-
sided, and fell off, numbed with cold,
it is supposed, into the water be-
neath, and was thus drowned in his
own dwelling. Fortunately the other
members of the family, including an
infant, succeeded in maintaining
their perilous position until day-
light, when they were removed to
Mr. Henry Pace’s house. They have
lost everything, including the pro-
duce of an excellent crop, and all
their fences. Mr. Dubout, who is
the landlord of the place, estimates
the total loss at £2 50. Proceeding
westward the valley widens out con-
siderably and presents one unbroken
deposit of silt with an occasional
fence post to mark where fences
have stood. Mr. Hine, jun., has lost
to the extent of between £lOO and
£l5O, although he only occupies 20
acres, and his house was untouched.
His haystacks were floated off like
ships, and he describes the roar of
the water, the deafening rainfall, and
the flashes of lightning as exceeding
anything he has ever experienced,
and he states, with others, who have
resided in the district for thirty
years and upwards, that such a
flood has never been seen before in
the Parwan valley. Its extent was
largely due to the enormous flow
of water down the Whitehorse ranges
from the direction of the Ironbark
forest, and from Spring gully, in
the opposite direction. Proceeding
still westerly the flood played havoc
with Mr. Kirkwood’s grain, and he
has lost some cattle, but his loss can-
not be stated yet, nor yet Mr. Sloss’s.
Two of his sons were asleep in a
tent pear the creek, and had to take
refuge in a tree. Further on, at
Mr. Willis’s Glenmore Station, a
sweep was made of an enormous
quantity of rabbit proof wire netting
and fencing, and the garden was all
destroyed, but we believe the grain
was secured. A large waterhole here
broke away. All up the valley the
same destruction of fences occurred,
and also, we hear, the Yaloak Vale
bridge belonging to Ballan Shire
Council. Returning to Rowsley, be-
low the gorge at Barry's, the bridge
known as Collie’s has absolutely dis-
appeared, with the exception of a
small piece of the wing wall. This
bridge was erected nineteen years
ago, and although too small had
withstood all floods until the present
one, which topped it about fifteen
feet. Trees in the bed of the creek
here show flood debris fully thirty
feet above the ordinary level. The
bridge in Rowsley flat has been
badly damaged, also one or two cul-


verts. Following the creek down to-
wards Bacchus Marsh an immense
outpour has overspread all the flat
land owned by Messrs. Connell, Heg-
arty, Gumming, Tilley, Kerr, Oliver,
Hider, Murdoch, Clark, Harkness,
Scott, Watson, Brown, McDonald,
McCullagh, and others down to the
foot of the Marsh valley, where the
whole of the creeks of the district
converge. Fortunately the extreme
violence of the rainfall was confined
to the Parwan watershed, otherwise
the accumulated waters must have
caused a flood of a magnitude un-
known to white men. From Cum-
ming’s place to Watson’s scarcely
a stick of fencing remains, and has
not merely been thrown down, but
has been swept clean out of the dis-
trict. Mr. Scott is a heavy loser, his
barn being invaded, and forty bags
of wheat covered, and all the im-
plements and miscellaneous property
swept out, and his house flooded.
To renew his fencing will be a heavy
item. Much of the same can be said
of Mr. Tilly’s place, and his loss is
particularly severe, including some
stacks. Mr. Hegarty likewise lost a
stack, and Mr. Oliver has many
chains of fencing to renew. Mr.
Hider’s place is also a scene of
wreckage, and the great body of
water in the creek can be estimated
by those who know the place when
it is stated it reached well up to
the Parwan school hill. The bridge
known as Scott’s is quite untouched,
as the flood had plenty of scope on
the flat to the south of it, and the
only damage to Shire property here
has been a breach in one of the
approaches to Brown’s bridge. All
the other numerous bridges in the
Shire are safe. Steps to erect Col-
lie’s bridge will at once be taken,
if any aid can be obtained from the
Government, and in the meantime
the old ford will be opened. This
flood was four feet higher than any
Mr. Scott has seen at his place dur-
ing his thirty years residence there,
notwithstanding the largely increased
Waterway of all the creeks. The
silt deposited on the flats will be
valuable as a fertiliser, but the im-
mediate loss to many small farmers
such as Messrs. Barry, Hine, Hider,
and Tilley, will be sorely felt, and
the cost to the Shire Council of re-
erecting the bridge at Rowsley will
be heavy, even if half-cost be ob-
tained from the Government. We
may mention that Mr. Willis, of
Glenmore, although a heavy loser
himself, was down at an early hour
to Mr. Barry’s place to give every
assistance in his power. One of the
incidents of the flood was that Mrs.
Bottle was nearly drowned.
Feb. 24, 1883. A quoit match,
between Messrs. P. Murray and P.
Murphy, occasioned much public in-
terest. The match was 31 points
up, and clay ends. Results, P. Mur-
ray 31, P. Murphy, 22.
March 24, 1883. The first ensil-
age made in Bacchus Marsh was on
view at Border Mill, the result of
an experiment by Mr. W. Grant.
Although made in a rough way it
was quite a success, the full weight
and sap of lucerne being preserved
in the form which made it fully as
palatable as dry lucerne, and pro-
bably much more nutritious. Mr.
Grant pitted the lucerne during the
previous December, without chaffing
it or mixing it with straw, and the
mass turned out was not matted or
mildewed, but presented the appear-
ance of fresh lucerne which had
been dipped into a' chemical and
changed in color to a light brown,
and also given a strong odor of sac-
charine fermentation. A cow to
which some of it was given ate it
at once without hesitation.
The leading articles of “Express”
maintain a high level, but I can’t
touch them; they are overwhelm-
ingly political. Sir Bryan O’Lough-
len has appeared on the scene. The
editor has leaned very much to the
Hon. Robert Harper, and I cannot
resist an extract. Mr. Crisp on the
silver-tongued Mr. Deakin “Mr.
Deakin may depend upon it that
his future usefulness as a legislator
will largely depend upon his culti-
vating the House of Commons man-
ner, rather than that impulsive
effusiveness which renders the
tongue truly an unruly member,”
I have an idea that we are grad-
ually (as we follow on the flies) get-
ting away from the atmosphere of
antiquity; the manners, customs, in-
cidents, are taking on a more mod-
ernised complexion. The record to
that degree is less striking, and the


historian has diminishing data to
present. The Ministerial “ins” and
“outs,” however absorbingly import-
ant the game was to the political
parties of the day, does not attract
now, even if it were discreet to re-
view the same, but possibly, as we
proceed, something may present it-
self that will be considered interest-
ing by those who have followed this
history of the Marsh.
Repeated evidence is forthcoming
that in the early days denomina-
tional asperity was a minus quantity
Yoysey, Head teacher of State School,
and conductor of Presbyterian choir,
leading the combined Sunday schools
of Church of England, Presbyterian,
and Baptist Churches in a cantata,
the proceeds of which were devoted
to the funds of the three schools.
April 7th, 1883, Mr. S. T. Staugh-
ton, in opening the Roman Catholic
bazaar, said that at much personal
inconvenience he was present, but
the promoters had assisted mater-
ially to make the Church of Eng-
land bazaar a success, and he felt
that he should repay in some way
the large-heartedness of those of an-
other Faith. Mr. W. Anderson gave
his assistance as an auctioneer gratis.
The bazaar was successful. Referr-
ing to that spirit of tolerance that
obtained among the churches, I may
add something. Included in the cor-
respondence of the late Mr. Crisp,
are two letters from the Rev. Patrick
O’Reilly, of St. Monica’s, Essendon,
and throughout these are expressed
most cordial feelings of friendship.
There was disagreement in religious
opinion, but the rev. correspondent
had only the sincerest regard for
his late friend, Mr. Crisp. The two
letters are lengthy, and they reveal
wide divergence of doctrinal opin-
ion, but as I have said, there was
no doubting the intensity of the
reciprocal friendship.
May 19, 1883. Shall “Bacchus
Marsh” retain its ancient name ? Or
shall it be changed to one more
euphemistic, classical, distinctly ab-
original ? In 1883 a section of the
inhabitants thought “Bacchus
Marsh” was too much suggestive of
mud and excessive drinking. Bac-
chus was the god of wine, and the
functions in honor of the divin-
ity were generally disgraceful or-
, gies. But “Bacchus Marsh” was
not named after the god Bacchus,
but that flue old pioneer, Captain
Bacchus. To many of the old iden-
tities —such was the opinion of a
citizen who had been born on the
Marsh, Mr. T. G. Pearce —the name
had become endeared, being rendered
familiar by long usage, that the
wrench of parting would be severely
felt. The early associations re-
called corduroy roads, and footpaths
on the top rail of road fences. It
was suggested that “Merrimu”
should be the new name, but Bac-
hus Marsh remains to this day, and
is not likely to be changed. It is
a distinctive name. A marsh does
not of necessity mean mud. A marsh
may be an expanse where the tall
waving reeds give an aspect of
greenness and freshness to the scene.
Some terms in themselves termino-
iogicaliy have an uninviting appear-
ance, nay, are arid in any suggest-
iveness, but “Bacchus” is classical ;
in its make-up there is no hum-
drum about the word ; further, it
perpetuates the memory of one of
those pioneers of the brave days of
old. Mr. T. G. Pearce commits him-
self neither the one way nor the
other. He declared we are at lib-
erty to fall back upon unpronounce-
able native names of which, it was
his belief, that “Merrimu” was the
simplest and the best. Mr. Pearce
always loved a peroration :—“But if
any aspirant for local fame will take
his stand upon one of the hillsides
overlooking this fertile valley, and,
after feasting his vision on a scene
of rural beauty rarely met with in
Victoria —if such an observer, in-
spired by the occasion can think out
a name at once euphonious and con-
cise, suggestive alike of flowery pas-
tures and sparkling streamlets, of
woodlands and of vale, I can promise
him that when the final plebiscite is
taken ‘my vote and interest’ will
not need to be respectfully soliciced.
Yours, &c., T. G. Pearce.
Another paragraph, May 26, 1883,
extolling the virtues of African box-
thorn, and to-day the virtues are
seen only in the growth being an
exuberant nuisance. Mr. Le Couteur
had invented a machine for separat-
ing the seed from the husk, and was
said to do good business in result.


Great trouble ahead (May 19,
1883) in regard to local nomencla-
ture. Was the railway station to be
called Maddingley railway station or
Bacchus Marsh ? There was great
fear that Maddingley, as a develop-
ment of railway communication,
would outgrow the
Marsh; indeed, that the town would
gradually shift from the Marsh to
the station, and “Bacchus Marsh”
would not only lose its pre-eminence,
but even its identity. Besides, evi-
dently there was some feeling
abroad that “Bacchus Marsh” was
unsuitable. Coburg was formerly
called “Pentridge,” but the name
was too suggestive of the prison,
and a public meeting was held,
which sent a deputation to the Chief
Secretary, who recognised the change
on behalf of the Government. On
the other hand, there was a great
desire that Bendigo should be al-
tered to Sandhurst. Indeed to this
day—perhaps I am wrong—the local
R.C. See still retains ecclesiastically
Sandhurst. Bendigo, if I remember
aright, was a pioneer pugilist of the
locality. Certainly “Sandhurst” 'was
much more “classy.” Many years
ago a plebiscite was taken, and
“Bendigo” carried the day. The
“Express” did not seem to favor
“Bacchus Marsh” as the name of
the new Railway station. But the
awkwardness was cited at Wynd-
ham, where the station was called
the Werribee station. Merrimu was
not adopted ; the suggestion was
made that Maddingley might be
chosen. But, Bacchus Marsh, with
singular pertinacity, has hung on
to “Bacchus Marsh.” It may or
may not suggest a resort or settle-
ment of drunkards. “Bacchus Marsh”
is a fixture; it is to go down to pos-
terity; the folk of the eighties
wouldn’t change it; their descend-
ants of 1916 tacitly confirm the
judgment of their forebears; and we
are not going to be re-christened in
our maturer years. The christening
opportunity has gone for ever. We
have now reached man’s estate; and
“the valley of woodland and dale,
the vision of rural beauty, the flow-
ering pastures and sparkling stream-
lets”—l quote the late Mr. T, G.
Pearce—is to be Bacchus Marsh for
ever and ever stecula sseculorum.
However, I give a resume of corre-
spondence on matter in next instal-
ment.
Mr. Cornelius Mahoney, who was
acquainted with much of the aborig-
inal history of the district, ascer-
tained from a Bacchus Marsh native,
named “Shoonjun” (which, by the
way, does not sound very aboriginal)
or “Jimmy Cockatoo,” that the nat-
ive name of the valley of Bacchus
Marsh was “Moonliong,” meaning
a warm sheltered valley, and Myrni-
ong a windy valley. Mr. Mahoney’s
informant likewise mentioned that
the aboriginal owners of the valley
were named Munjit, Ghoonjun, Bil-
litjorrk, Palstiana, and Balliang.
A poem arises out of the fore-
going.
There’s great trouble caused in this
little town
About changing its name, and there’s
many a frown
On account of the names that are
sent for selection,
Which are flowing from all sides
and every direction.
But there’s one of our locals (a
truth-seeking gent)
Who the whole of last Tuesday the
afternoon spent
In discoursing with Cockatoo Jimmy
to see
If Jimmy could tell him its whole
history.
He asked the old veteran chief of
the Yarra
The original name, and he answered
“Wydarrah.”
“If that is the name,” then spoke out
C.M.,
“I’ll go to the Marsh folk and
quickly tell them.”
When he arrived in the town, and
had spoken the name,
It was received with delight, for it
was the same
As was given by Sulky Dick many
years gone by,
When the black’s encampment near
the Marsh did lie,
And as it was the natives who
christened it so,
I think it the most suitable name
that I know.
•—'“Radical.”
Note by Editor :• —Mr. W. Hider
informed us some time ago that
“Wydarrah” was the name given to
the Marsh by the aboriginies. We


have not been able to get any veri-
fication of this. We have ascer-
tained from Lands Department that
Merrimu dates from 1849, as far as
surveys made by Department are
concerned.
Mr. Crisp was always on the look
out for information. He communi-
cates with the Land Office, Sydney,
which courteously replied :—“ln re-
ference to your letter of the 16th
ult. —issue of “Express,” July 21,
1883 —requesting information respec-
ting origin of name of the Parish
of Merrimu, I have the honor to in-
form you that the late Surveyor-
General, Sir T. H. Mitchell, direc-
ted the surveyors under his charge
to adopt native names for all rivers
and localities, and it appears Mr.
Surveyor Dark (who surveyed the
parishes of Merrimu and Korkuper-
rimul in the years 1840 and 1841)
submitted those names for approval,
and that they were then adopted.”
A great function-—Nov. 21, 1883.
—The opening of the Mechanics’ In-
stitute, by Sir W. J. Clarke. The
building had been erected on a site
generously presented by Mr. R.
Manning, of the Royal Hotel, and
cost £2,000. Towards this a Gov-
ernment grant of £450 had been ob-
tained, and £3OO from the B.M.
Shire Council. A further sum of
£3OO had been raised, to which Mr.
S. T. Staughton, M.L.A., contributed
£SO, leaving £IOOO still to be col-
lected. The old Mechanics’, erected
in 185 8 (now serving as a private
residence) had served the needs of
the community for 25 years, but for
the latter part of its career as a
public hall, never did the “Express”
cease dwelling upon its unsuitabil- ■
ity. Many years back an offer was
made by Mr. Staughton to contri-
bute £SO towards a new building.
The room was stuffy; the windows
little rat holes —-I forget the exact
description given by the “Express.”
At lectures the audience generally
got languid in their attention to the
speaker, but the “Express” said how
could you expect anything else with
such a vitiated atmosphere ? Occa-
sionally there would be a particu-
larly large gathering. The hail
could not accommodate the throng
of Bacchus Marsh citizens. This
again was the opportunity for the
j editor, and he wondered when the
community would shake off the leth-
argy. So far, so good. Eventually,
it was generally accepted that the
old Mechanics’ Hall, of 1858, had
had its day, and that a new order
of things was arising. There was
no piano; in the report of every
concert would be a note that Mr..
Voysey, or some other citizen had
kindly lent his piano for the occa-
sion.
But a battle royal is to he fought,
not that a new hall should be built,
but where ? The Border Inn proprie-
tory offered a piece of land adjoin-
ing the hotel. Mr. Manning, too,
made the offer, as already recorded.
But a heated controversy occurred
in the paper in regard to Trustee-
ship. I propose making no com-
ments. There was a good deal
of hard hitting, and it was mutual.
The Hon. Alfred Deakin sent an
apology for non-attendance, owing
to being present at opening of
Yarra railway. The Hon, Peter
Lalor did not arrive until the after-
noon was well advanced. The Hon.
Henry Miller sent an apology, and
Mr. Jeremiah Ryan also, accompan-
ied with cheque £l/1/, in addition
to three guineas already given. Mr.
Staughton was up to business. He
proposed that a subscription list
should be opened. He led off with
£SO. Before he left the township
Sir W. J. Clarke informed the Pres-
ident that he would give £SO to-
wards the building fund, and £25
towards Book Fund. Oh his return
journey from Myrniong (the bazaar
still being open) Sir William was a
large purchaser.
Bacchus Marsh, 1916, cannot raise
a band. Dec. 8, 188 3, I read that
the Bacchus Marsh Fife and Drum
Band is now organised for practice,
Mr. T. G. Pearce having added this
to his other duties, on behalf of the
young people of the district.
“Express” Files, 1884.
It is recorded, Jan. sth, 18 84, as
a preamble to a published essay on
“The meeting of Burns and Scott,”
that the author was the eldest son
of Mr. J. H. Bowser, of Bacchus
Marsh, who had been for so many
years resident in Bacchus Marsh.
The author was at the time a stud-


ent of the Edinburgh University,
one of his successes there being the
gaining of a prize for this essay,
“which displayed a wide yet con-
centrated imaginative power, which
Will cause it to be read with inter-
est, especially by those persons who
are familiar with Sir Walter’s ac-
count of the interview, which has
been idealised by the essay.” The
author of 18 84 of the Edinburgh
University is now the Hon. J. H.
Bowser, member for Wangaratta,
a former Minister of Education. The
essayist is graphic, not to say dra-
matic. Certainly the style is not
journalistic. I give a sample, the
conclusion : —“Outside, this evening,
there is a strange silence. From the
impending clouds—winter’s aerial
orchard shaken by Boreas—fall the
myriad snowy blossoms, light and
sort. Phantom-like rise the dim
shapes of gables and spires, with
innumerable lights blinking, tier
above tier, and lessening away into
the west. Here is the house where
dwelt the Reformer—Knox. It is
in darkness. But what is this that
breaks the stillness ? Hark ! The
clear tinkle of a vesper bell ! Such
are the changes in life.” The dwel-
ling of John Knox is converted into
Catholicity, and the youngster who
stands at the case in the printing
office of the “Express” at Bacchus
Marsh proceeds to Edinburgh Uni-
versity, and eventually is accorded
civic distinction in the State, that
he is the chosen of an electorate to
assist in building up of the law of
the land. Verily, as the philosopher
wisely saith, we never know wliat
moment will be our next.
The community—lßß4—is awak-
ening to the necessity of having
water supply. A leading article
complains that, what with dry
weather, rabbits and low prices for
grain, the land was becoming so
valueless that unless artificial means
of restoring its usefulness were in-
troduced it would relapse into a
sheep walk, and the township into
a collection of windowless houses.
The ranges, which attracted the rain
clouds and cause them to pass over
the agricultural land without re-
freshing them, were sufficiently near
to store up for irrigation the waters
which they received, and the. rivers
Lerderderg and Werribee were to a
largo extent natural irrigation chan-
nels already available to distribute
the water. The town in those days
had no water scheme. I have been
reminded of some old inhabitant, a
Mr. Breen, who used to earn a live-
lihood from selling barrels of water
from the Werribee. Oblivious to
its interests, Bacchus Marsh was
slow to move in the matter, and had
to be girded on by an unceasing ed-
itorial advocacy of a legacy which
had been bestowed upon the com-
munity by nature. And in regard
to water sufficiency, is Bacchus
Marsh of 1916 as inert as the Bac-
chus Marsh of 1884 ? In a sense we
are. Pyke’s Creek to-day is prac-
tically empty, and if that water is not
available will mean considerable di-
minution in production, therefore
the whole district suffers, not only
the producer, but the tradesman.
The income of the district is so
many hundreds of thousands of
pounds less, and that amount of
money should have been in circula-
tion. Bacchus Marsh, surely, is in-
fluential enough to say that these
things shall not be. The Water Sup-
ply Department must have enough
enterprise and grasp of principles
of storage to devise how Pyke’s
Creek catchment may be improved.
The tunnel is an excellent idea.
Tons of water have been passing
down the Werribee to the sea unused
during the season, which would have
filled Pyke’s Creek easily. The Ler-
derderg will prove ample for Exford
reservoir, and ail surplusage from
Pyke’s Creek reservoir, if Werribee
be diverted, will not be lost, but
will only increase Exford storage.
The question is a live one, viz., the
inadequacy of Pyke’s Creek supply,
and it appeals, as I have said, to
the whole community. Therefore
representation should be made to the
Water Supply Department that there
must be no laxity in conserving
tho'se waste waters of the Werribee.
In 1884. there was no avenue of
trees, which now claims the admira-
tion of those who pass through the
town. The local Debating Society,
established in 1884, at its first meet-
ing, in dwelling upon the utility
and beauty of trees, discussed
whether it was desirable that the


streets should be planted after the
manner of other towns. The op-
position alleged that business people
were opposed to tree-planting as
streets were so narrow. But it was
replied that though this was the
case, trees need not be an obstruc-
tion. On a vote being taken, the
“ayes” had it. A proposal was be-
fore the Shire Council at this par-
ticular time, indeed had been
brought before that body several
times, but no action had been taken.
The Council moves at last —50 trees
of £1 each, 35 for Bacchus Marsh,
15 for Myrniong, and Mr. T. G.
Pearce apparently undertook the re-
sponsibility that the trees should be
properly selected and planted.
June 21, 1884. Sir, —I was very
glad to see that some little taste is
being exhibited in the proposal to
plant the Marsh streets with trees.
I think if from Maddingley bridge
to the Woolpack were treated that
way it would greatly beautify the
little town, and, as I told Cr. Dickie,
I would be very pleased to bear the
expense of planting opposite my
property at Stamford hill. From
the great natural advantages of the
Marsh, and the excellent land on
all sides of it, I have always said
no small country town should have
more solid prosperity than yours,
for I think it should be made as at-
tractive as can possibly be done by
rows of deciduous and other trees,
specially when cost is far from high.
—Yours, &c. —Henry Stephenson.
Mr. T. G. Pearce is prompt. An
open letter to Mr. Stevenson to for-
ward on his £5. Mr. Henry Steven-
son squares the matter at 2 guineas.
Mr. P. K. O’Hara, formerly Ro-
man Catholic teacher of Bacchus
Marsh, was undoubtedly a melodist.
The lyrical versifying intensified in
his son. Greendale is apostrophised;
Greendale is adjacent to us, there-
fore the poem has local interest.
Mr. J. B. O’Hara has taken a fore-
most place as an Australian poet.
He has published many of his poems,
and these have met with much ap-
preciation.
TO GREENDALE.
Fairest haunt of happy childhood !
Thro’ thy Wildwood oft I stray,
Where the singing and the ringing
Of the birds on bush and spray
Wake the memories, sweet and olden.
Of the golden days of yore
Of the pleasures and the treasures
Of thy teeming woodland store !
Thro’ thy fields the rosy summer,
Brightest comer, dancing sings,
There he lingers and his fingers
Wake thy harp’s enchanting
strings !
There the autumn, smiling, follows —•
There the hollows and the rills —■
There the splendour of the tender
Evening glows on all 'the hills I
And the springtime falls in glory
O’er thy hoary woodland bowers ;
Till, enchanted, they are haunted
By the spirit of the flowers —
Laughing sprite that roameth ever
By the river in the dells,
O’er the mountain, o’er the fountain
And by mossy forest wells !
And Aurora, bride of morning,
Comes adorning all the lea,
And the maiden sweet is laden
With the scent of flower and tree;
With the odors, wooed by kisses
From the tresses, golden hair.
Of the wattle with its subtle
Fragrance gloriously rare !
And when evening-tide is beaming—-
’Tis a dreaming magic eve,
Bright as fairy dreams, and airy
Visions that we often weave !
Thus the charms of evening, morn-
ing,
Sing their warning notes for thee
For thy valleys and thy gullies,
Greendale, village dear to me !
Tho’ my strain would fain be glad-
ness.
Yet there’s sadness, sorrow too,
For I’never might tho’ ever
Singing, sing thy glories true !
Sing the brightness and the sweet-
ness
And repleteness of thy charms,
Of thy graces and the places
Hallowed by thy smiling farms !
—J.B. O’H.
July 19, 1884.
1886.
Jan. 10, 1886. Mr. P. Murphy,
of Bacchus Marsh, won the second


prize at quoit match, at New Year’s
sports of the Highland Society, at
Geelong. The prize was a silver
medal, given by Mr. Fischer, jewel-
ler, of that town.
In latter part of 1885, great fer-
ment that District Agricultural show
should be transferred from Myrn-
iong. Myrniong very sore. Mr. Peter
Grant hits out forcibly. But the
prospect of a railway reaching the
Marsh is altering the state of affairs,
and the Marsh is eventually chosen
as the most suitable place for hold-
ing the show. It would be too tedi-
ous a resume of the discussion, par-
ticularly the struggle over the Gov-
ernment subsidy. It ended in the
show finally taking its flight from
Myrniong. The Bacchus Marsh Ag-
ricultural and Pastoral Society was
established on 3rd June, 1885. The
title of the original Society was the
Bacchus Marsh, Ballan and Pentland
Hills Agricultural and Pastoral So-
ciety.
I am interested in the report of
a cricket match, Feb 21, 1885. It
was a semi-final between Sunbury
and Bacchus Marsh, in the Staugh-
ton-Deakin competition, for clubs I
presume in the West Bourke elec-
torate. Bacchus Marsh won easily,
and this was owing to the excellent
bowling of the two brothers, A. and
H. Barradell. They were the only
bowlers for both innings. The bowl-
ing analysis speaks for itself; —First
Innings, H. Barradell, 15 runs, 5
wickets, 8 overs ; A. Barradell, 15
runs, 5 wickets, 7 overs. Second
innings : —H. Barradell, 16 runs, 3
wickets, 3 maiden overs, 11 overs ;
A. Barradell, 22 runs, 6 wickets, 10
overs. H. Barradell must also have
been able to use the willow, for he
was one of the first batsmen to open
for the Marsh. In the final match,
Bacchus Marsh was beaten by Keilor.
This was the judgment of the Bac-
chus Marsh literati in 18 85. At a
meeting of the Debating Society an
interesting and carefully prepared
paper was read by Mr. Yoysey, head
teacher of the local school, upon
“New Guinea” who opposed the ob-
jections raised to sharing that is-
land with Germany. The Rev. J.
M. Innes (Chairman) the local Pres-
byterian minister, thought as Mr.
Yoysey, and agreed with the Rev.
Lawes, a Presbyterian Missionary,
that the climate rendered New
Guinea unsuitable for European col-
onisation. No further discussion
ensued on the matter. Apparently
there was unanimity of conclusion,
for attendance was sufficiently large
to admit the contrariety of opinion.
I read in a prior issue that the So-
ciety was booming—the attendance
reaching as high as 150. Germany’s
forcefulness, not to say aggressive-
ness, resulted in that country shar-
ing New Guinea with Australia ; but
1915 witnessed the full absorption
by the latter, and notwithstanding
what the Rev. J, M. Innes thought
and averred in 1885, and his dicta
awoke no opposition in the audience,
to-day Papua is considered a valu-
able territorial adjunct to the Do-
minion, and is capable of extraor-
dinary development.
A lecture was given by Mr.
Deakin, M.L.A., July 13th, in Me-
chanics’ Institute —he was not yet
Hon. Alfred Deakin —in aid of funds
of Rifle Club. Mr. Deakin had just
returned from his visit to America,
and his subject was “Mexico.” At
the conclusion of his lecture he was
accorded a vote of thanks, and his
remarks on that occasion have
strange applicability to present cir-
cumstances :—“He hoped the young
men of the district would join the
Rifle Club to protect their homes, if
need be, from such a descent as
that of Cortez upon Mexico. They
were indebted to their fathers, and
their fathers yet again for the liber-
ties they enjoyed, and the unmo-
lested possession of this splendid
country. Let them, therefore, re-
solve that as fathers, their sons
should have similar reasons to re-
vere them, because they defended
their country when called upon.”
The proscenium and drop scene
in Mechanics’ hall have always at-
tracted attention. July 10th, 1885,
was the work executed. Here is the
note: —“The new proscenium and
drop scene, painted and supplied by
Mr. Grist, of Melbourne, and erected
by him for the total cost of £4O,
met with general approval, but also
with some adverse criticism that it
is too light, and too dear for -the
money. Mr. Grist, however, avers
that the price was far too little.


Certainly he has given a lovely drop
scene —a picture of Conway castle.”
Other criticism follows, but possibly
manv of the younger generation are
quite ignorant as to the subject of
the drop scene, as the scribe was,
until he came across this illuminat-
ing note. [The present drop scene
is not the same as described above,
it has been repainted by a different
artist with a different subject,—Ed.]
Father O’Connell, whom all, re-
gardless of creed, delighted to honor,
passed away, and Mr. P. K. O’Hara
thus elegised his late spiritual over-
seer (July, 1871). Why not ap-
pearing earlier is not stated.
ELEGY TO THE MEMORY OP
FATHER O’CONNELL.
He is gone to his home, where the
saints in the sky
Sing paeans to welcome his advent
on high,
And the angels around the Eternal’s
high throne
Sing proudly to welcome his pure
spirit home.
He is gone ! —the mild, innocent,
simple and pure !
Who soothed the lowly and suc-
cour’d the poor ;
Whose charily boundless will ne’er
be known
To any but Heaven’s Creator
alone.
He is gone ! —the benevolent, tender
and kind—
Austere in his living, angelic in
mind ;
He will long be remembered with
sorrowful pride
The ‘‘saintly old man” who has
recently died.
He is gone !—How many his loss
will deplore !
If sickness crept in at the lowliest
door,
Or trouble or poverty, sorrow or
shame—
They fled at the sound of the good
Soggarth’s* name.
He is gone !—and tho’ sadly his
people deplore
The loss oj, the pastor they will
never see more,
They’re proud that the Lord, in his
mercy so grand,
Hhs ta’en him away to His own
happy land.
He is gone ! —the good shepherd, who
tended his care
With a fund of affection and
charity rare ;
And won the stray sheep by his
kindness and love,
To the Grace of the Lord in His
mercy above.
He is gone ! —who for years has been
stricken and lone
In his lowly abode, so congenial
a home
To one who has e’er been an alien
to pride
Prom the day of his birth to the
moment he died.
He is gone ! —amid mourning, and
sorrow and tears,
Of those who have known him for
many long years—
And will treasure his memory many
a day
When his bones in the grave will
have mouldered away.
He is gone ! —and the people who’ve
known him so well.
Thro ’years of affection and fond-
ness, can tell
No act of his life has brought sor-
row or shame
On the flock that shall ever be
proud of his name.
He is gone ! and for ever ! the
simple and mild
The sainted in heaven —on earth
as a child —
He is gone where humility meets its
reward,
When the spirit ascended to its
Maker and Lord.
He is gone ! —and for ever the ages
may roll,
His name stands unblemished.
May God rest his soul !
May God rest his soul in mercy
we pray !
Till he meets his reward on the
great judgment day.
He is gone ! where his bark has a
haven of rest
And has anchored in peace mid
the holy and blest ;


Where the sins and the sorrows of
earth are no more,
Beyond the cold grave on etern-
ity’s shore.
—P. K. O’HARA.
Bacchus Marsh, July, 1871.
* Gaelic —Priest.
Repeatedly do I come across re-
cord of success in Agricultural show
by Mr. W. Jeffrey, of Coimadai. I
think I have made a note of this
before. For example. Sept. 5, 1885,
I find a paragraph to the effect that
Mr. Jeffrey had been successful at
Ballarat with his stock, having taken
four first prizes, one second, two
thirds, one fourth, total value, £3O.
Bullengarook awakens —and surely
here is glorious scenery—-poetic im-
pulse in an author, Eugene Cant-
well, Sept. 26, 1885 :■ —-
LINES TO BULLENGAROOK.
Sweet spot, how memory flies amain
To thy woodland bowers.
Where jocund summer’s glowing
train
Makes glad the rosy hours ;
Where swiftly passed, like wanton
wind,
The day-spring of my life ;
Ah ! fond memory brings to mind
Those days with beauty rife.
How blithe thy flowdry fields I
roamed,
With heart as nature gay,
By babbling brooks that flashed and
foamed
With fountains full of spray ;
What time the cross refulgent shone
And burned within the blue,
Or when the rosy-fingered dawn
Was glimmering in the dew.
And when the balmy breath of
Spring
Was whispering in the wold.
Or summer spread its flaming wing
O’er meadows rich with gold ;
When autumn lingered in thy bowers.
Or from benignant skies
Soft winter fell —thro’ all the hours
Thou wast my paradise !
Ah ! golden hours, ah ! joyous times,
How swiftly ye decay !
Ah ! happy days in blissful climes,
Too soon ye passed away !
Yet memory often backward strays,
Recalling youthful dreams,
And once again I live those days
Mid old familiar scenes.
—Eugene Cantwell.
No scheme of irrigation has yet
been adopted by the Marsh. It is to
come, but agitation is never ceasing
that irrigation in the Marsh must
be. One great result is cited as to
what the fiat can produce under
water. It is instanced, Oct. 31st,
1885, that Councillor Michael O’Con-
nell grew cauliflowers 3 feet high,
with the aid of irrigation. Unhap-
pily, the record does not include
the diameter of flower. At a Plorti-
cultural show in Mechanics’ hall,
some years ago, Mr. Patterson, of
the Gasworks, exhibited a parsnip
5-ft. BJ-ins. long !
There is a paragraph, Jan. 9th,
1886, that somehow attracts :—“The
field trial of lucerne mowers, for
prizes offered by Bacchus Marsh Ag-
ricultural and Pastoral Society, took
place in Hon. Henry Miller’s Hope-
toun paddock. There were eight
competitors, and Messrs. Fagg, Cain
and Gumming supervised, while
Messrs. Simon and Jeffrey judged.
About two acres were allotted to
each machine, and two and a half
hours were allowed for the work.
All machines finished within two
hours. The first prize was awarded
to a Hornsby machine, driven by
J. O’Connell, for M. O’Connell; sec-
ond prize, Nicholson machine, driven
by J. Lodge; third prize, Samuelson
machine, driven by J. Scott. The
other machines were a McCormick
(McFarlane), Buckeye (Nagle),
Swan & Martin (Doherty), ditto,
(Miller), Nicholson (P. Dickson).
All the work was done without a
hitch of any kind, and there was
very little difference in it. The
Hornsby cut very close and clean,
and laid the swathes well. The crop
was a heavy one, and a good deal
laid, but paddock was level. Very
general satisfaction was expressed
with the day’s proceedings.
Jan. 30, 1886. The Bacchus
Marsh Water Trust is legally con-
stituted, and the community enters
on a new era. Grading is to follow
all over the flat. Various appliances
such as disc harrows, earth scoops,
and American spreaders are to make
their appearance in the district. The


landowners of the Marsh had now
their future prosperity in their own
hands to a degree never available
before. A railway was about to be
provided that would carry away and
enhance the value of any produce
they might grow, and with a public
scheme of water supply commenced,
and limited only by their own abil-
ity to utilise the waters of the two
rivers flowing to waste by turning
some of it upon their lands; surely,
it was argued, all the local pro-
ducers would rouse themselves to
carefully examine their own immed-
iate surroundings, so that they might
participate in the new era of local
circumstances, so far as their means
would permit. The first meeting of
the Trust was held after Council
Feb. 13, 1886, and there were
present—Messrs. Meikle, Willis, Dic-
kie, O’Connell, Pearce, Watson, Lid-
gett, Burnip, and McCullagh.
Coimadai limekilns history. March
20, 1886. The Coimadai limekilns,
which were worked by the late Mr.
Hopgood, and then by Mr. Bower,
whose interests fell into the hands of
Mr. Blair, the Melbourne lime mer-
chant, who kept the quarries idle for
years, and ultimately allowed them
to lapse to the Crown, have been
taken up by a company consisting
of Messrs. Alkemade Brothers, and
Mr. Egan, whose manager is Mr. P.
L. Alkemade, a gentleman of con-
siderable experience in all matters
connected with the working of lime
quarries, and who informs us that
the analysis of the Coimadai lime,
when compared with other limes in
all countries, show it to be unex-
celled in strength and quality, quite
equal to the best Geelong lime,
which is almost exclusively specified
in Government contracts. Mr. Al-
kemade found the quarries in a di-
lapidated state, encumbered with
much refuse, but he has exposed a
perpendicular face of limestone 50
feet high, and says the supply is
practically inexhaustible. He does
not intend to burn the lime in the
primitive and wasteful manner hith-
erto adopted, but is having a pro-
per kiln to turn out 2,000 bags per
week. The new firm have now or-
ders from some Melbourne builders
which will tax their energies for
some time to come, but they intend
to commence carting to the new rail-
way station at Parwan almost at
once. It was always expected that
these quarries would be valuable
when the railway came to the dis-
trict, but the old residents have al-
lowed them to be taken up by
strangers to the district. Mr. Alke-
made first became acquainted with
their merits through Mr. Hopgood,
junior, who had a contract for sup-
plying lime on the North-Eastern
line, where Mr. Alkemade also had
a contract.
Thirty years ago was this para-
graph written, and the kilns are
still a going concern.
The Bacchus Marsh railway is ap-
proaching completion. It is opened
to Parwan, but there was a great
possibility for a time that “Parwan”
would have to give way to another
name, “Ryan’s Corner.” . But it was
pointed out that in reality “Ryan’s
Corner” was obsolete as a designa-
tion, as “Ryan’s Corner” had become
“Milter’s Corner.” Parwan remains
to-day.
A full description of the Werri-
bee railway viaduct is given. It is
1,250 feet long (nearly a quarter-
of-a-mile) and 125 feet high; has
a double line of rails supported
upon a red-gum planked deck, car-
ried upon lattice work girders rest-
ing upon square skeleton towers of
iron work, much wider at base than
top, and tied together with angle
rods and stretchers of various kinds,
the whole being bolted to massive
bluestone piers, strong enough and
big enough for fortifications, and
standing upon the most expensive
concrete foundations, in some places
forty feet thick, built up with great
difficulty upon a bed of lignite,
for the most part. The total cost of
bridge was said to be £120,000, but
extras would add to this consider-
ably. The testing of the bridge
took place March 15, 18 86, in the
presence of a great crowd of rail-
way officials, of all grades of mag-
nitude. An old inhabitant of Bac-
chus Marsh (a resident since 1842)
accompanied Mr. Speight, Railway
Commissioner, on to the bridge when
the most severe tests were being
applied. Four heavy engines
coupled together, and fully manned,
with full steam up, and estimated


to weigh altogether 190 tons, raced
over the bridge at their utmost
speed, and also brought up sharp
in middle of it, without noticeably
shaking it, and even the instru-
ments used to record the deflections
showed only a quarter of an inch
vertical depression, and about an
eighth of an inch of lateral oscilla-
tion. These tests were made in
various ways—first by one engine
at slow pace, and then with two
engines, and from both ends of the
bridge. No accident ocurred in
erecting the structure.
I am entering upon 1866. Every
year had its own particular history,
but alas, in some instances of too
ordinary, hum-drum a character to
call for reproduction or comment.
Some of the “years” have been re-
viewed rapidly, for there has not
been much distinctive incident.
Life is a strange mixture of tragedy
and comedy, but when it has the
neutral tint it is uninteresting ; it
is neither too hot nor too cold, and
is voted a failure.
In the first issue ot the “Express”
for 186 6, a lengthy poem appears
over the signature of J. B. O’Hara.
Bacchus Marsh apparently is obliv-
ious of the fact that an Australian
songster of wide reputation regards
the locality as one with which he
was identified in a formative (not
to say plastic) part of his career.
Ayrshire, in Scotland, has gained
immortal fame that it did shape a
warbler called Robbie Burns, and
what is this strangest perversity of
Bacchus Marshian dullness, or in-
difference or sheer cussedness, that
the emanation of a poet from its
midst has not received some lasting
recognition—the fountain, the silver
tablet, or the scroll in public hall.
The poet, Jan. 2nd, exhibits a de-
votedness to the community, for
there is a masterly poem in its
honor. I may be allowed to express
a regret that “the greeting” does
not contain some more local appos-
iteness. The introducing of “gleam-
ing Orion” and “the sphere of
broad Dian on axle of gold” is all
very well, and accorded splendidly
with current classical affection that
adorned or disfigured so much of
the muse for so many centuries, but
1 would that Mr. O’Hara had burst
into a frenzied address to Werribee
Gorge, or rhapsodized on the glow
of Anthony’s cutting under a rising
sun, or the sweet slopes of Darley,
or bold Bullengarook lifting his hoary
head, or those fertile pasture hills,
Pentland, where roamed the blood
stock with their arched necks and
sleek sides. Surely, some old in-
habitant, full of “wise saws and in-
stances,” must in his boyhood have
impressed the sensitive receptive
nature of the young poet O’Hara,
and, as Robbie sang of Gavin Ham-
ilton and the others, how fitting that
Cornelius Mahoney, or a J. B.
Crook, or a Thomas Heath should
have lived for ever in'deathless song.
I read the poem, but as I do so
there is a sense of disappoinment.
Hang the seashore, Mr. O’Hara; why
didn’t you, the bard, sing of the
wondrous graces of thy early home ?
I really expected some delightful
reverie, as lying embowered in lux-
uriance on bank of Werribee, the
poet would roam in fancy over that
flat of perennial greenness, those
“ambrosial meadows,” where wand-
ered the pensive beast with burst-
ing udder, and he (the poet, not
the pensive bovine) upon homilising
that milk of human kindness, which
was ever characteristic of the resi-
dent of the Marsh. But it is not so;
the sea shore is too much the set-
ting, the philosophy too melancholic,
for with such glorious prospect as
the habitat affords, pessimism flies
apace, and hope dwells for ever ser-
ene as gloriously tinted cloud on
Bullengarook. Mr, O’Hara will ex-
cuse the criticism, for surely the
greeting is the product of much
metrical skill; there is fine array of
diction; it is musical, sonorous, but
the effort to me has as much suita-
bility of application to the “am-
brosial meadows,” to the local
“sweet valleys and woodlands,” as
a bar of soap has of being an orna-
ment in a drawing room.
OLD TIMES.
A New Year Greeting to Bacchus
Marsh.
From the brown of the wave-fretted
foreland
That frown o’er the deep,
From the face of the wind-haunted
moorland,


The shadowy steep;
From the flower-flaming vales of the
summer,
From mountain and mere,
All hail the gladsome new comer,
The rushing new year !
Wind-harps of the forest are singing
To hollows and dells ;
Out rushing your echoes are ringing,
O ! wild beating bells,
To the new year, glad maiden and
tender,
Bright spirit of shine,
Who comes with a glory and splen-
dour,
In raiment divine !
With her forehead enwreath’d in
roses,
Red roses of fire,
She sweeps thro’ the far woodland
closes
On wild wings of desire,
With the gleam and the glow of
December,
Brows ringed as with gold ;
And I stand by the sea and reinerm
ber
Dead seasons of old.
Yea, fancy glides back on her pin-
ions,
To childhood’s gl.ad hours.
Once more in its golden dominions,
Arcardian bowers,
I revel with youth’s young emotion,
As free as the play
Of the wild waves that whiten the
ocean
With fringes of spray.
O, deep droning ocean, roll onward!
0, murmuring sea,
While tossing your wild billows sun-
ward,
Unfettered and free ;
More blithe was my heart than your
surges,
That fitfully sing
At the base of the wind-haunted
verges.
In life’s happy spring.
Sweet seasons of youth, like the
shadows
Ye vanished ! O where ?
Dim dreams on ambrosial meadows !
Rich castles of air !
Doth time in his ravage dismember
All things that were bright ?
Ah ! I stand by the sea and remem-
ber
Dead scenes with delight.
Sweet haunts that were dear to the
glory
That summer-tide sheds ;
Sweet valleys and woodlands all
hoary,
Where the flower-spirit treads ;
Deep dingles and glimmering gullies,
Fair fancy’s abodes,
In my dreams you appeared golden
valleys.
Fit seats for the gods.
When golden-girt Phoebes was hid-
ing
In gloom his bright car,
And night over Atlas was sliding
And kindling each star ;
When the spangles of gleaming
Orion
Blazed over the wold,
Or twisted the sphere of broad Dian
On axle of gold ;
When the rosy red eye of the morn-
ing
Flashed on the dew drops,
That glimmered a rainbow adorning
On meadow and copse,
Bright haunts ! I have loitered and
lingered.
Entranced in the bush
Of mute even’, or neath, rosyfln-
gered,
Aurora’s soft blush.
There, too, in the times that are
olden
Dead seasons of yore,
Came love on his pinions all golden,
First love evermore !
With the glimmer of tresses gold
laden.
The blue starry eyes.
When that sweet little marvellous
maiden
Made life Paradise.
All seasons are rife with the story
Of changes amain ;
The new year is fleeting—its glory
Ephemeral, vain !
Ah ! the olden year mem’ry will
treasure,
While the sands of life run,
Glad days that were brimful of pleas-
ure !
Sweet times that are gone !


Thus I dream of the days that have
perished,
Old time that are fled ;
Of the things that my fancy hath
cherished,
Now drooping or dead ;
For the old year hath died in De-
cember
On meadows of gold ;
And I stand by the sea and remember
Dead seasons of old.
—JOHN B. O’HARA.
An election incident must be no-
ticed. April 3rd, 1886. It had been
quoted by the enemy, as a proof of
Mr. Deakin’s youthfulness, that he
should play such a practical joke
upon Mr. Staughton by removing the
chair of the latter at an election
meeting held at Romsey, with the
result that, in front of the distin-
guished audience, Mr. Staughton
ignominously sat right down on the
platform ! But the true rendering
of the catastrophe was that Mr.
Deakin and Mr. Staughton had ar-
ranged to change chairs as each rose
to speak, because one was more com-
fortable than the other. Mr. Staugh-
tcn went to the table for a glass of
water, and then backed towards his
chair, which was missed by him, with
the result that he fell. Mr, Deakin,
with his usual quickness of percep-
tion, turned the awkwardness of the
situation by remarking that he hoped
that was the only seat Mr. Staughton
would lose during the election.
April 17th, 18 86. The “Express”
ferrets out something :—We have
obtained a copy of the specifications
for the water supply works required
at Bacchus Marsh railway station,
and find that the local Water Trust
has, to all appearance, lost a good
opportunity of securing a very pro-
fitable customer by not paying suf-
ficient attention to what the Railway
Department required, and made an
offer to pay for. The works consist
of a pump and steam engine, a
2 0,000 gallon iron tank, erected on
columns, also a red-gum engine
house, a water crane, and a turn-
table, with 5 0 chains of iron piping.
The water is to be pumped from the
Werribee and carried over half-a-mile
in pipes, then elevated into a tank,
"whereas the Trust could have taken
the water out of the same river by
gravitation and led it straight to the
station at a height giving sufficient
head without the 20,000 gallon tank.
Through a little want of business
tact in the Shire Council (acting as
a Water Trust) the district has
lost a good annual endowment and
the absurd spectacle is presented of
two Government schemes within a
few miles of each other acting in
rivalry and surplusage, the gravita-
tion scheme being injured by losing
its best customer, and the Railway
Department having to maintain,
erect, and work a pumping plant
which could have been dispensed
with. And it is left to us to ferret
out these facts.
Archbishop Gould, on June 3rd,
1886, confirmed, in St. Bernard’s
church, two hundred young people,
with a sprinkling of adults. I refer
to the sacred ceremony, because it
was one of the last duties of the
Archbishop. On Friday, June 11th,
the prelate passed away. The fatigue
of the confirmation service, and also
the journey from Melbourne and
back, probably hastened his death, as
he was suffering from heart disease.
Agriculture, July, 1886. “While
nearly the whole Shire of Bacchus
Marsh is a desert, owing to a dry
winter, the irrigated paddocks of Mr.
O’Connell, and of Messrs. Pearce
Bros., show heavy root crops. Mr.
O’Connell is now digging up and
sending to Melbourne an enormous
crop of carrots, worth about £4O an
acre. Six of the carrots weighed
60-lbs., and thirteen or fifteen of
them to the hundred-weight can be
frequently met with in his paddock.
Messrs. Pearce have their usual crop
of chicory, which they now have dry
in their kiln.”
Maddingley works hard to get
railway station, just about to be
erected, called “Maddingley,” but
Bacchus Marsh works equally as hard
otherwise. A letter appears in
“Argus,” July 16th, 1886 :
Sir, —As an attempt is being made
to mislead the Railway Commis-
sioners by stating that the railway
station for Bacchus Marsh should be
called Maddingley, because the latter
is a Government township on the
south side of the River Werribee
(where the railway station is to be),
while Bacchus Marsh, immediately


on the north side, and for which the
railway was brought where it is, was
not laid out by the Government, I
ask space to state, as the matter is
of some historical interest, that Bac-
chus Marsh has a pedigree which
takes precedence over that of the
colony of Victoria itself, much less
of any “stickit” township, such as
Maddingley undoubtedly is, and has
been ever since it was laid out by
the Government in 1854. Bacchus
Marsh was sold to the late Captain
Bacchus by the New South Wales
Government, that gentleman having
taken up the run early in 1838, con-
sequently the Victorian Government
could not lay out a township of Bac-
chus Marsh when it came into pos-
session of the’ Crown lands here-
about. Nevertheless Bacchus Marsh
has grown up as one of the most im-
portant townships between Melbourne
and Ballarat, is on the main metalled
road between those places, and about
mid-way from each. Maddingley cer-
tainly has one hotel and one store,
whose owner is seeking an hotel li-
cence, but beyond this it has no
township characteristics whatever,
not even a post-office, and is in
short a back street of Bacchus
Marsh. The station would have been
placed in the township of Bacchus
Marsh but for the expense which
crossing and re-crossing the river
Werribee to effect that object would
have entailed, and as the Govern-
ment has expended a large sum of
money to bring the station even as
near as it is, the Bacchus Marsh
people (who have worked incessantly
for 15 years past to get this line)
have been content to accept it just
outside of the township limits, but
they are certainly not willing to be
robbed of the right to attach the
name of their town to that station,
and I think the injustice of asking
them to do so must be apparent to
any impartial observer. —Yours, &c.,
Christopher Crisp, Editor, B.M.
“Express,” Bacchus Marsh, Julv 16,
1886.
And Lo ! Maddingley was snuffed
out.
July 10, 1886. An item bearing
on the ever interesting horse racing
theme. Mr. S. Miller was very suc-
cessful with his jumping horses, in
short time appropriating 12 hurdles
with various horses, chief of which
was Studley, winning in stakes above
£B,OOO, although he was so little
thought of, after having baulked in
a hurdle race on the Bacchus Marsh
course, that he was offered for £6O,
Studley was bred in Bacchus Marsh,
and was by King Tom.
A most active head teacher was
Mr. Joseph Yoysey—a President of
Mechanics’ Institute, a mainstay of
Debating Society, precentor of the
Presbyterian Church, and Superin-
tendent of the Sunday School, and
altogether, as he is about to leave
(August 7, 1886) “will be missed in
our little community.” In Mr.
Yoysey and Mr. W. T. Lewis the
community scholastically were well
served.
August 14, 18&G. The Bacchus
Marsh Rifle Club have permission of
the Trustees of the Racecourse to
erect rifle butts there, as Mr. Crook
could no longer alow them to use
his land for a rifle range.
The Editor of the “Express” never
had any relish for the “Bulletin,” as
note following, August 21, 1886 :
Fame comes to us from an unexpect-
ed quarter The “Bulletin,” Syd-
ney, 10th August : “It is our inten-
tion to publish a series of interesting
articles on journalism, illustrating
them with pictures of popular edi-
tors, carefully engraved on wood. We
would feel obliged if you could favor
us with your photograph, and with
a brief sketch of your life, as early
as possible.” To prevent any of our
readers seeking copies of the “Bulle-
tin,” we beg to state that we prefer
to seek notoriety (or celebrity)
through some other channel.
Sept. 25, 1886. Another accident
at Anthony’s Cutting. The Rev.
Montague Williams, of Bacchus
Marsh, accompanied by a boy who
was employed by him, was returning
from Melton. He was driving a
spirited horse. Going down the steep
incline, the rev. gentleman lost con-
trol of the animal. The buggy
bumped three or four times against
the fence. Both occupants were
thrown out. The boy had his head
seriously fractured, and lingered for
a few hours. The Rev. Williams’
injury was mostly shock. Much sym-
pathy with the mother of the lad, a
widow, as the deceased was begin-


ning to be of assistance to her. He
had attended school that morning.
The name of the boy was William
Baker Greenwell. Mrs. Greenwell
was assisted “to the credit of the
district,” in various ways, and £62
was collected.
Dec. 11, 1886. At the Scotch Col-
lege, Mr. A. R, Robertson, second son
of Mr. David Robertson, of the
Korkuperrimul Creek, Bacchus
Marsh, won the Old Collegians Cup.
The second son of the late Mr. D,
Robertson is now the Hon. A, R.
Robertson, M.L.A.
Irrigation idea grows slowly. Dec.
18, 18 86. The practice of irrigation
is spreading in Bacchus Marsh. “Mr.
James Kerr has recently completed a
gravitation scheme on the Lerder-
derg, and several of his neighbours
will join him in the use of it. Mr.
W. Grant, Mr. E. G. Jones, tylr. T.
Cain, Mr. W. H. McFarlane, and Mr.
McGrath, are all doing a little in the
matter of irrigation ; and Mr. Mason
has purchased a steam engine for the
same purpose. By April next we ex-
pect the Water Trust works to be in
full operation. Surprise has been
expressed to us that landowners of
Bacchus Marsh do not use wind-
mills for water lifting purposes.”
An important local historical para-
graph. Jan. 15, 1887 :—Mr. James
Mahoney, who was the oldest inhabi-
tant in Bacchus Marsh, and an Aus-
tralian colonist for fifty years stand-
ing, forty-three of which he had
spent in Bacchus Marsh on the spot
where he died, and in the house he
had built for himself, died on Sun-
day last at the advanced age of 92
years and four months, having been
born on 24th September, 17 94. He
emigrated to Tasmania with his
family per the ship Bussorah Mer-
chant in 1837, that being the first
immigrant vessel which arrived
there. Subsequently he became as-
sociated in Melbourne with the late
Captain G. Word Cole, and purchas-
ed from him the property he (the de-
ceased) owned in Bacchus Marsh all
the time he was in it. This was
originally taken up by Captain Alex
McCrae of the 84th Foot by virtue
of a land warrant issued to him for
twenty years’ service, under regula-
tions of the New South Wales’ Go-
vernment passed in August, 1838. A
great portion of the Bacchus Marsh
land was taken up by ex-officers
under these warrants. The deceas-
ed was always much respected, and
up to about three years ago was a
remarkably active, young-looking
man for his years, but latterly he
had been bed-ridden, and also quite
blind. The immediate cause of
death was the weakening effects of
the excessive heat of last week. De-
ceased has left several grandchildren,
and his eldest son, Mr. Cornelius
Mahoney, also a very old resident in
Bacchus Marsh, inherits half his
property, the other half going to Mr.
W. Mahoney, who is one of Mr. C.
Mahoney’s sons. Deceased was a
stone-mason and bricklayer, and
worked at those trades until he
settled in Bacchus Marsh.
Bacchus Marsh scientifically be-
hind hand. There was . no local
meteorological station, as to-day.
The week ending Jan. 15, 18 87, was
marked by a great heat wave all
over the colony. The complaint was
that there was no thermometer in
Bacchus Marsh accurately kept to en-
able a degree of heat to be compared
with that at other places.
Feb. 12, 1887 :—“We are inform-
ed that an interesting trial of Coi-
madai lime took place at the Federal
Coffee Palace, now in course of-erec-
tion at the corner of King and Collins
streets, Melbourne, when there was
a large number of leading architects
and builders present. Mr. P. L.
Alkemade, the Manager of the
Hydraulic Lime and Cement Com-
pany, conducted the trial, which ter-
minated in favor of Coimadai lime,
which has now to be used in the
building, one of the largest jobs in
the Southern hemisphere. The work
requires 11,000 bags of lime. The
Company have also secured the ex-
clusive supply of lime for the Tram-
way Trust.”
The Battle For The Railway Line.
A valuable compilation of the his-
tory of the agitation for a railway
to the Marsh appears in the “Ex-
press” of Feb. 19, 1887. I pur-
pose extracting it bodily. It may
yet happen, when the Great War
and its aftermath have passed, there
may arise a public desire that the
annals of the quiet neighborhood


shall be preserved. For such an
eventuality I wish the record to be
as complete as possible. The late
Mr. W. H. McFarlane, a man of
consistent public spirit, expressed,
some short while before his decease,
that this review of the past history
of the Marsh should be put into
book form, and he was prepared to
take considerable responsibility in
connection with production of
same. The late editor has given a
masterly sketch of the movement,
which ended in the iron horse
steaming into the valley. We want
now and then to be reminded of
what those workers, filled with zeal
for the welfare of the locality, per-
formed. That direct railway from
Ballarat to Melbourne easily might
have been constructed, leaving Bac-
chus Marsh in the lurch, but Mr.
Christopher Crisp, Mr. Thomas
Cain, Mr. Bower and others were
tenacious, and to-day we enter into
their labors. Mr. Crisp dubs his
sketch brief, and possibly what is
contributed is only a tithe of the
history of the incessant agitation ;
but such concise detail could only
have been supplied by one who had
had many anxious moments ere the
consummation. The sketch is as fol-
lows :—•
Some time about 1853 or 1854 at-
tention was turned to providing a
direct road from Melbourne to Bal-
larat, and the line of route now
adopted for the railway was selected
by Mr. G. C. Darbyshire, C.E., now
Assistant Engineer-in-Chief of the
Victorian Railways, and some years
ago, the Engineer-in-Chief, from
which position he voluntarily re-
tired. The same route was after-
wards indicated to the Roads and-
Bridges Department by Mr. Darke,
a surveyor in the employ of the
Sydney Government, who surveyed
the district and named the parishes
prior to the separation of the colony
•from New South Wales. The road
was surveyed and exists to this day,
but has never been much used, as
settlement grew up to the north of
it. In 1857, Captain Clarke, now Sir
Andrew Clarke, suggested a main
trunk line of railway very nearly on
the route now constructed between
Parwan and Melbourne, which was
to be continued to near Ballan, and
then branch into two lines one
south for Ballarat and the other
north for Bendigo. In 1859 a Bac-
chus Marsh railway league was
formed to support this line, but the
influence of Geelong on the one side,
and of the late Hon. W. J. Clarke,
and Kyneton and Castlemaine on the
other, shelved the Direct line, and
created the Geelong to Ballarat and
the Sandhurst lines. The extension
from Geelong to Ballarat was opened
on 10th x\pril, 1862; the extension
to Sandhurst being opened on 20th
October, 1862. From 1859 to 1872
the question of a railway to Bacchus
Marsh slumbered, as railways were
not so easily got in those days as
they are now. In 1872 an agitation
sprang up at Blackwood to get a
railway to that place and to Dayles-
ford from Woodend. This dragged
on into 1873, and on 7th June, of
that year we suggested in a leading
article that the agitation for the pro-
posed line could be strengthened by
making it start from Digger’s Rest
instead of Woodend, and take Coim-
adai, Bacchus Marsh and Ballan on
its route to Blackwood. On the 12th
July Mr. D. D. Bower, of Coimadai,
took the matter up in detail in a
letter to the “Express,” and on the
19th July we suggested that the
Shire Council should urge Messrs.
King, Riddell and Smith to get the
line surveyed. The Council did so,
but those gentlemen did nothing
and on 2nd August we suggested
that the Council should approach the
Minister of Railways direct. On the
2 3rd August our files state that a
petition to the Shire Council to the
above effect was being got up, and
on the 30th the Council received it
and complied with its request by
seeking the co-operation of the Mel-
ton and Ballan Councils, which was
granted, and on Sept. 27th we had
a leading article advocating the line,
followed by others on Oct. 18th and
2 sth. There was a Railway Bill be-
fore Parliament at the time, and
Major Smith moved the omission of
the Hamilton to Portland line in
favour of one from Keilor road to
Ballarat. The line received good
support in the House, and Mr. Gil-;
lies declared that it must be in the
next Railway Bill, no matter what
Ministry was in office, but as the


line was not surveyed it could not
be undertaken then. On Nov. 15th
we alluded to this promise as giving
grounds for the belief that the line
would reach Bacchus Marsh in the
next four years, and suggested that
local action should be at once taken
to secure the best route; warning
the township people not to let any
distrust of tbe value of a railway to
them induce them to hold aloof and
allow the railway to pass by them
as it had at Kilmore. The following
week a requisition was presented to
the President of the Shire asking
him to call a public meeting to con-
sider the question, which was done,
and the meeting was held on the
13th December, being preceded by
leading articles on Dec. 6 and 13
urging a large attendance, and giv-
ing Direct Line statistics. At the
meeting this question of route was
not touched upon to any extent,
both because few people had got as
far as that in their thought upon
the subject, and because it secured
greater unanimity to ask in an in-
definite manner for a railway for
the Shires of Melton, Bacchus Marsh,
and Ballan. A resolution was pas-
sed asking those Shire Councils to
take the matter up and share ex-
penses ; also suggesting that Mr. D.
D. Bower be appointed Secretary to
the Conference, or League. This
Conference did not meet until Feb.
28, 1874, and before that time Mr.
Gillies had promised to get a line
surveyed to Bacchus Marsh. At the
Conference meeting a northern route
starting from Holden was adopted,
and a deputation sent to the Min-
ister. Mr. Bower was appointed
Secretary. Mr. Gillies promised to
give the survey party instructions
to see Mr, Bower, and on May 16
Mr. Barker commenced a o-arvey of
a northern route. Messrs. Porter
and Bower adopted the water sup-
ply surveys and said there were no
difficulties as far as Colmadai. At
the Conference meeting on June 20,
Mr. Bower reported that the survey
up the Pentland hills had been vis-
ited by Mr. Darbyshire who had
convinced him it was impracticable.
Mr. Darbyshire advised connecting
the north route with the old south
route at Bacchus Marsh. From this
time the Government gradually dis-
countenanced the north line, but as
it was the most popular locally,
steps were taken to get it surveyed
out of local funds, and Mr. Downe,
C.E., accordingly presented to the
Conference meeting on the 2 9th
August a plan of seven miles of
route connecting the north and
south routes as far as they were
surveyed by the Government. This
line was objected to by Mr. Darby-
shire as requiring too many bridges.
On October 3rd Mr. Bower com-
batted these objections, and others,
and said the Government should be
asked to further survey the south
line to connect it with the north.
On Oct. 10th a public meeting was
called to advance this request, and
Mr. Bower presented a survey from
Mr. Standfleld showing a practicable
connection of the two lines across
the Werribee. The meeting adopt-
ed Mr. Bower’s views, and sent a
deputation to Mr. Gillies, on the 24th
Nov., but only received his assur-
ance that the matter would have his
best attention, and that of the sur-
veyors. On 22nd March, 1875,
there was a meeting at Myrniong to
advocate bringing the line there,
and a deputation was sent to Mr.
Gillies, who told them Mr. Darby-
shire pronounced the line impractic-
able. On April 17 we urged a sur-
vey of the north line apart from Mr.
Darbyshire’s influence, but consid-
ered the south route the best for
the colony as a whole. On the 24th
we urged Mr. Gillies to inspect for
himself, and suggested several routes
which Mr. Wrixon might look at.
Oh Ist May we reported that Mr.
Barker had surveyed a south line to
Bacchus Marsh only, which would
terminate in the Police paddock at
Maddingiey. On May 8 Mr. Barker
received instructions to survey all
northern routes, and we suggested
the inclusion of Selby’s route. Mr.
M. I. Browne offered land free for
a northern route. On May 17 there
was a meeting at Myrniong to get
a line surveyed lip the course of the
Werribee and the Myrniong creek.
About this time there was a Parwan
meeting in favor of south route. On
June 16 a deputation from Melton
to Mr. Gillies urged the south line
to Ballarat when Mr. Gillies said
there was no more chance of getting


a second line to Ballarat than of
getting a line to Heaven, On July
17 it was reported to the Confer-
ence that the north line was 22J
miles -11 links from the main line
at Holden to Bacchus Marsh, and
17 h miles from Holden to Melbourne
or 40 miles altogether. The south
line then being about five miles
shorter, and now eight miles shorter.
On Sept. 4 it was reported that Mr.
Barker had got a line up the Pent-
land Hills by way of Messrs. David
Robertson’s and Meikle’s. On the
7th Sept, a deputation waited upon
the Hon. John Woods, when Mr,
Darbyshire favored the south route,
and Mr. Woods promised to consult
his colleagues. On Oct. 2 3 Mr.
Joseph Jones was Minister of Rail-
ways, and Mr. Barker left the dis-
trict. Nothing further was done un-
til May 13, 1876, when the Shire
Council sent a deputation to Mr. J.-
Jones, who promised to look up the
plans. The Ballan Council sent a
deputation to Mr. Jones on 2 9th
June, without result. From this
time all our efforts were in favour
of the Direct Line, on account of
its shortness, and the greater chance
of getting it instead of a local line.
At this time the “Argus'’, Geelong
“Advertiser,” and Ballarat “Cour-
ier,” all opposed a Direct Line. A
Railway Conference was held at
Ballarat, on 12th Sept. 1876, when
Mr. Ford, now a Railway Commis-
sioner and then City Clerk of Bal-
larat, showed that the Direct Line
would save £45,530 per annum, be-
sides what would be obtained from
local traffic. Mr. Baird referred to
Mr. Langton’s statement that a mil-
lion of money had been lost by the
non-construction of the Direct Line.
On Sept. 2 3rd a deputation waited
on Mr. Joseph Jones, who said Bal-
larat must wait for this line. Lead-
ing articles and letters constantly
appeared advocating the Direct Line.
On Nov. 18 the Railway Bill came
out with the Lancefield line in it,
and one for Warrnarabool, the latter
having it was supposed, driven out
the Bacchus Marsh line and the
former having been inserted to
quieten the members for West
Bourke. We suggested efforts to get
the Assembly to include the line,
and the Hon. P. Lalor moved the in- I
elusion of a line to Ballan, and the
Hon. J. T. Smith of one to Bacchus
marsn. The mil was withdrawn,
pending a general election. During
cue election we urged that all can-
didates be pledgeu to the Direct
une. In May, i»77, Mr. Bower left
cue district, we continued to urge
the Direct Line, and tne desirami-
ity of bringing it more prominently
uetore tne pumic. Although tne Hon.
j, T. Smith advised the contrary.
On June 20 a deputation from a
puolic meeting in Bacchus Marsh,
waited upon Mr. Woods, who said
tne line must oe made, but ne had
no money lor it. in August tne
wordon line was inserted by the
Assemoly, and Mr. Berry promised
a oig Bill next time, but opposed tne
Direct Dine, which also drew edit-
orial condemnation, likewise sir
Charles Sladen’s opposition about
this time. During iS7 8 mere were
eiforts at Egenon and Ballan to get
tne line nearer to those places. in
July ivir. Woods toid a deputation
that tne line would be extended from
Gordon to Keilor as soon as possiole,
and m Novemoer he introduced a
Bill with this line in it. Very little
was done owing to the reform
struggle. In March, 1879, Mr. J.
B, Patterson visited the district, and
promised to support the railway. In
April, at our instigation chiefly, it
was resolved to carry the war into
Melbourne itself, and a public meet-
ing held in Bacchus Marsh decided
to organise a big meeting in favour
of the Direct Line. This was held
at the Athenaeum, on 2 oth May, and
was verV successful, as it conquered
all opposition to the Direct Line.
The joint lion, secretaries to that
movement were Messrs. T. G. Pearce
and C. Crisp, the chairman being
the President of the Shire, Cr. Dickie.
The speakers were drawn from all
places interested in the line. The
Gordon line from Ballarat it should
be stated, was let on 13th Sept.,
1878, and was opened on May 7.
187 9, the contract price being
£40,9 00, but its total cost has been
£85,367. The deputation from the
Melbourne meeting was told that
there was not enough money for
the line. On July sth, 187 9, the
Geelong people held a meeting to
oppose the line. On August 16, Mr.


Berry told Cr. Grant that he would
include a line to Bacchus Marsh in
the next Bill. In October Ballan
held a meeting to get the section
from Gordon to Ballan. Bacchus
Marsh followed with a deputation,
and Mr. Berry said the line would
be in the next Bill. Early in Jan-
uary the line was included at an
estimated cost of £99,809. In April,
1880, a meeting was held protesting
against Mr. Wrixon’s survey party
Demg withdrawn. At this time the
Service Government had just taken
omce. Messrs. Harper and Staugh-
ton had been retained. Mr. Wrixon
was instructed to survey a line into
the Marsh, and a leading article re-
commended trying Selby’s route. On
July 9rd a public meeting asked to
nave the station as near Stamford
hill as possible. August 7, the Berry
Ministry was back, and survey party
tried Selby’s route, but condemned
it. Then tried a line crossing the
valley at Mahoney’s, and back across
Stamford Hill, which was said to be
too severe in grades. October 2nd,
public meeting to urge that a line
of some kind be constructed. De-
putation to Mr. Patterson got no sat-
isfaction, and they saw Mr. Berry
who promised again to do his best
to get the line. Mr. Patterson said
it was a question of Direct Line or
nothing. Ballan sent a deputation
to Mr. Patterson asking for the Gor-
don to Ballan section. He said only
one piece could be put in. On Oc-
tober 23rd, Bill introduced with Bac-
chus Marsh section of 20 miles in it.
Mr. Staughton offered to and did
give land free, for which he lias
never received the thanks he ought
to have received, as his object was
to encourage the unwilling Minister
to grant the line. Nov. 6th, leading
article advised accepting the 20
miles, and station at Ryan’s corner,
with the idea of getting it nearer
when line was extended. Nov. 20,
line passed Assembly. Mr. Berry
stating that the Direct Line was not
likely to be made for a generation.
Nov. 2 7th, the Bacchus Marsh Shire
Council sent a deputation to try and
get the station nearer Bacchus
Marsh. Mr. Patterson said there
was time enough to discuss that
when the line was completed. Dec.
11th Bill passed the Legislative
Council. Melton sent a deputation
asking to have the line nearer Mel-
ton. Mr. Patterson declined to de-
form the direct line. Nothing done
to survey the line until May 2 Bth,
1881, when Mr, Peyton Jones com-
menced the work. In July the
O’Loglilen Ministry came In
Sir, Bryan promised the whole direct
line as a matter of ministerial
policy. This at once re-opened the
question of getting a better station
site for Bacchus Marsh, and at the
instigation of Cr. Michael O’Con-
nell, early in September, Mr. Bea +
visited the district and promised
branch lines to both Melton and
Bacchus Marsh rather than interfere
with the Direct Line. Shortly after-
wards he introduced a Bill contain-
ing these spurs, and the Bacchus
Marsh one was surveyed, but Mr.
Darbyshire advised that it be aban-
doned, as he could bring the main
line to Maddingley flat and continue
it on up (Kennedy’s gully to the toe
of the racecourse hill at Rowsley.
Mr. Leo Cussen succeeded in ob-
taining a line by this route, and it
was accepted by the district in lieu
of the branch, but only on the ex-
press condition that it was a part of
the main line, and not a branch
from it. On Feb. 9, 1883, Mr.
Robb’s contract to construct the line
from Pootscray to Parwan station
was accepted at £151,330/4/, Mr.
Bent having the satisfaction of let-
ting this work, and deciding that
the we*—- viaduct should be for
a double line before he left office
in March, 1883. Mr. Robb received,
up to June last, £172,482/4/2, as
contrasted with Mr. J. B. Patter-
son’s estimate of £99,000 for the
work. The Melton station was
opened on Ist April, 1884, and that
to Parwan on 15th April, 1886. In
1884 the Service Government passed
a large Railway Bill authorising the
Direct Line, and the section from
Parwan to Bacchus Marsh was the
first contract let under that Bill.
Messrs. Buckley obtained it on
April 17th, 1885 for £39,265/16/11.
A contract for water supply at the
Bacchus Marsh station was let for
£1,346, making the total expendi-
ture upon this Direct Line to date,
about £350,000, and the estimated
cost of completing it is £148,898,


which does not include all the equip-
ment, so that the Direct Line will
have cost over half a million of
money before it is finished. But
this amount, large as it seems when
not compared with costs of other
lines, sinks into insignificance when
contrasted with the £4,6 88,849 which
the 100 miles of double line to
Sandhurst cost, or the £1,766,205
of the 531 miles from North Gee-
long to Ballarat, and it is really a
more important fine than either of
them, as it shortens by 2 8 miles
one-third of the whole railway
routes of the colony. The above
sketch contains only a tithe of the
history of the incessant agitation in
Bacchus Marsh for this line, and we
feel proud that the district is so
largely associated with the under-
taking and near completion of this
noble public work.
Opening Of The Railway.
It was a great day for Bacchus
Marsh, Feb. 15th, 1887. Everybody
had his or her Sunday clothes on.
Work was suspended. The place
was beflagged. The weather was
after all propitious. It looked rainy
in the morning, but the Clerk of
the weather knew just what was on,
and gave orders that the aerial dis-
tillers should refrain from any de-
position of moisture, because of the
momentous occasion—opening of the
railway. It was a great event, a
great function, but a little eclat was
spoilt by some blundering official
at Spencer street omitting, to un-
earth two banners —“Advance Aus-
tralia”—which were to be placed on
sides of the engine, and some spec-
ially prepared flags. The main
street was adorned with two lines
of flags across the road at either
en.d, also various flags on both sides
intermediate. I like the artistic
touch of description——When the pro-
cession from the station passed along
on its way to the Mechanics’ Insti-
tute, there was' the happy result
that it hit the happy mean between
over acting and under acting, be-
tween pasteboard artificiality and
unadorned reality, for the vehicles
were sufficiently heterogeneous to be
characteristic of the colony, from
the Governor down to the most de-
mocratic and youngest of Bacchus
j Marsh natives. What do you think
of this, that follows, for picturesque
description ?—-“The waggons lent by
Mr. Mclntosh, for the conveyance of
the children, had been etheriaiised,
and at the same time magnified to
the proportion of ships in full sail
by elaborate decoration with willow
wreaths, flags, and mottoes. A
handsome four-in-hand drag, with
the Egerton brass band, led the way,
Cr. Molesworth Greene’s carriage
followed, with His Excellency the
Governor (Sir Henry Loch). A
four-horse Jack coach, of Cobb &
Co., and several well-appointed ve-
hicles, came next. The procession
was three-quarters of a mile in
length, and closed with a group of
horsemen. It was, says the chron-
icler, a truly Australian pageant, full
of local color and incident. Mr. Alex-
ander Forsyth, in his handsome Hus-
sar uniform, as an ex-Sergeant of the
disbanded Bacchus Marsh Troup of
Cavalry, was Marshal; Mr. W. Meikle
in less showy uniform of the Mount-
ed Rifles, was understudy ; Mr. G.
A. Bence was also a supervisor of
the procession, together with our
übiquitous townsman Mr. T. G.
Pearce.” And, such a day in the Park.
The youngsters had abundance of
eating and drinking, races for prizes,
&c. At the Mechanics’ Institute, 120
guests sat down to the banquet. The
upper table was honored by the
presence of the Governor, three mem-
bers of the Ministry, Sir W. J. Clarke,
Messrs. Staughton, Rees, and Cooper,
Parliamentary representatives. There
was much speechifying. I shall not
reproduce, I have sudden memory
thafc in the early part of review the
ceremony of the opening of the rail-
way was recorded.
The presence at the banquet of Mr.
W. H. Bacchus, J.P., of Peerewur,
near Ballarat, was taken advantage
of by the editor to gain early history
of the Marsh. According to Mr. Bac-
chus, the first survey of the locality
was made in 1839, by Mr. W. W.
Darke, who was employed by Sydney
Government to lay off allotments for
retired officers, who must have been
informed by some one of the value
of the locality. The late Captain
Bacchus came with sheep in 1838;
the Pentland Hills were then occu-
pied by Mr. Kenneth Clarke, manager


for the Great Lake Company, of
Van Dieman’s Land. He gave up to
Captain Bacchus all land east of
Korkuperrimul Creek, and, in des-
cribing the transaction to his em-
ployers, called it “Bacchus’s Land,”
which name it has not shaken off,
although the Bacchus’s themselves
called the estate “Lardedirk,” which
was the native name. Mr. Bacchus
objected to any change of the name
of the town from “Bacchus,” as he
considered his father’s memory had
been associated with the locality for
nearly 50 years. The name is that
of an old English family, called
Bauhus or Baccus, which ‘can be trac-
ed back to the battle of Borough-
bridge, in 1322.
March 2 6, 1887. At the Birre-
gurra sports on St. Patrick’s day, Mr.
W, P, Robertson, of Colac, and son
of Mr. David Robertson, of Bacchus
Marsh, won the principal event, the
Birregurra Cup, of £2l. ' There were
five heats, and Robertson ran the
final one, 140 yards, in 13 seconds.
A menagerie race, of 50 yds., was
won by a native cat, with a peacock
second.
Local poetry. April 2, 1887:
The full, true, and particular His-
tory of the Justly Venerated St.
Patrick, Apostle of Ireland, by
One W'ho Was There and Knows
All About It.
St. Patrick was a protestant—
An ancient Irish Curate.
And every year he made a stand
For tithes and dues and pewrate.
And if he couldn’t get his dues
He’d make a botheration.
And put the Paddys in the mews
And squeeze ’em through creation.
Chorus—Hurrah for bold St. Patrick.
Who clambered o’er a steeple;
While in his reach he made a speech.
That cautioned all the people.
The saint he was a good old sort,
Sent to convert the heathen;
Every year he made high sport
And made a grand display then.
He censured all men’s evil ways
Without discrimination.
He purged old Ireland with a blaze
And gained her full salvation.
Chorus, Hurrah for bold St. Patrick.
One Sunday after prayers, the Saint
As he sat having dinner,
A neighboring King had just step-
ped in'—
An unconverted sinner.
Saint Patrick called “Another plate,”
And told the King to fall on.
The King refused and Pat abused,
Which conduct brought a squall
on.
Chorus, Hurrah for bold St. Patrick.
Said Patrick, now, I do protest,
Against this gross intrusion;
O King retire! or into fire
I’ll send you in confusion.
Of homely fare you’d not partake
At humble invitation,
So vamos now, you reprobate,
And know your proper station.
Chorus, Hurrah for bold St. Patrick.
The King at this began to rue,
And seeming quite confounded,
Apologising to the Saint
Whose feelings he had wounded.
“St. Patrick, dear, I’ve but come
here,
Without ostentation,
To hear from you your doctrine new
In civil conversation.”
Chorus, Hurrah for bold St. Patrick.
“You teach us when men worship
God
That they worship three,
That one is three and three are one
This mystery solve to me?”
The Saint held up the Shamrock
green
And called that all might see
The sacred emblem might be seen
By high and low degree.
Chorus, Hurrah for bold St. Patrick.
Hence Erin’s sons they wear the
green.
One stem with petals three.
In memory of good St. Patrick
And Christianity,
From the slough of Heathendom
He set a nation free.
God bless his work and may it last
Through all Eternity.
Chorus, Hurrah for bold St. Patrick.
ONE OF THEM.
Bacchus Marsh, March 22, 1887.


W. G., Hopetoun, surely is Wil-
liam Grant, Hopetoun, miller and
poet. So far back as 186 8 was the
virtue of irrigation known, as ex-
pressed in poem, but how slow the
community to act. May 21, 187 7,
the stanzas are reprinted :
IRRIGATION.
(From the “Express” of Nov. 2 Bth,
1868.)
“Irrigation—that’s • the word every-
body’s using.
Each his own pet scheme upholds,
all the rest abusing;
“Tell me not of Coimadai,” says
that mighty man J.Y.,
“Lerderderg or Werribee, one or
both’s the scheme for me.”
“Lerderderg won’t do at all,” quoth
our small friend, J. E. Crook;
“If my words you want to prove,
just walk down the Marsh and
look;
Where a few short years ago herb-
age rich and rare did grow,
Now by Lerderdergian silt all that
herbage has been kilt.”
“Bosh and nonsense.” answers Har-
board; “silt don’t matter, not a
rap;
Make a dam and dam the silt up,
let the water through a tap.
Lerderderg’s the cheapest, best —try
them all, and the time will test;
If you don’t get wet enough, then
set Harboard down a muff.”
Others all their expectations on the
Werribee have built,
“There’s a river, now,” they tell
you, “free from all that filthy silt.
Flowing past you as you dream,
glides that fructifying stream;
Set to work without delay, Werri-
bee’s the scheme to pay.”
While a few are heard to mutter—
“Christopherson must surely know
Quite as well as the wiseacres where
to get the biggest flow.
If on Pyrete he decide, let us by
his choice abide;
Surveys now are nearly done, soon
the work will be begun.
But another question rises, Where’s
the money to be got?
For without the cash to back it
talking’s only so much rot;
Till we get the needful tin, not i
scheme can we begin.
Here again opinions differ, and tin
talking waxes stiffer.
Some propose the cash to borrow
from the new Colonial 8.,
And the deeds of all the district
give as their security;
All their coffers running over, they
have cash, and we want clover;
They are rich in heaps of brass, we
get poor for want of grass !
Others with more speculation think
a company’s the style.
With a well got-up prospectus you
the public can beguile;
Prove as plain as ABC that the pro-
fit’s bound to be
Cent, per cent., or something better,
if the weather don’t get wetter.
But amidst all this palaver summer’s
slowly creeping by,
And some crops exhausted, waiting,
have made up their minds to die.
While the farmers gaze with anguish,
as their hopes for harvest
languish—
Languish, die, and disappear, all for
want of Nature’s beer.
Some, impatient, won’t wait longer,
but resolve a pump to get,
And their dying crops recover by a
dose of heavy wet—
Pumps to make the water rise, since
it won’t fall from the skies—
Pumps of every size and plan,
worked by steam, or horse, or man.
May success attend their efforts, and
the grateful soil produce
Ample crops of grain and fodder,
rich with this imparted juice;
Fields too soon by drought made
bare Nature’s verdant livery wear.
And the starving dairy cows once
more on rich pasture browse.
Hopetoun. W.G.
May 21, 1877. Water was let for
the first time into the main race of
the Bacchus Marsh Water Trust
works by Cr. Hugh Meikle, Chair-
man of the Trust, who, when turn-
ing the handle of the sluice gate,
quoted from Tennyson’s “Brook,”


that “men may come, and men may
go, but I go on for ever,” and he
hoped that the stream would go on
for ever, as water was badly wanted
in Bacchus Marsh. The members of
the Trust present were Messrs.
Greene, McCullagh, Watson and
Cain; also Mr. Stanfield, designer of
the works and Engineer to the Trust
and Council; Mr. W. T. Pezet, Clerk
of Works; Mr. P. McGrath, assistant
field surveyor, and Messrs. McCusker
& Cane, the contractors. Very little
Interest was taken in the proceedings
by general public. It was extra-
ordinary, this apathy on the part of
the local public at the opening of the
irrigation works, for the Marsh sure-
ly can only base its prosperity upon
plenty of the liquid. Cr. Hugh
Meikle was not prophetic; the water
through the main has not flowed on
for ever. Even with the addition of
the Pyke’s Creek, storage there is
insufficiency.
A Mr. T. W. Doubleday, of Bac-
chus Marsh, in 1887, contributes
some very fine poems. As they have
no local application, and are very
long, I cannot quote them.
Draughts champion : June 11,
18 87. Mr. James Wyllie, “ the Herd
Laddie,” played draughts at the Bor-
der Inn on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday. The attendance, both of
players and onlookers, was large.
About 60 games were played. Mr.
Wyllie’s toughest opponents were
Messrs. Peter Murray (who obtained
one drawn game), W. Jeffrey, P.
Murphy and T. Heath.
Mr. Deakin, M.L.A., was the elect
of Bacchus Marsh, as portion of
the West Bourke electorate. Mr.
Deakin was chosen to go home as
a representative of the colony, to
“build of concrete the bridge that
joined the motherland and the col-
onies.” He accomplished his duty
in an eminent degree. “The Times”
declared that he was of the stuff
of which statesmen are made. He
was only comparatively young, but
his oratory made a wonderful im-
pression ; his amiable personality by
no means detracting therefrom. It
was reserved for an Australian
journal, many years later, to satir-
ize that his political decease was
caused by “excessive affability.”
Mr. Deakin returns from the home-
land, and he is lionised. Represen-
tatives of every shade of political
opinion vie with one another in
loading the young statesman with
compliments. He journeys overland
from Adelaide, via Geelong, the
direct line from Ballarat to Mel-
bourne being only constructed then
in part. Mr. Deakin was accorded
a great reception at Spencer street
railway station, and I note that
special honor was paid a Bacchus
Marsh inhabitant, Mr. Mark Kyle,
who welcomed Mr. Deakin with an
apt speech, in addition to reading an
address. A public dinner was given
to Mr. Deakin the following week,
at Bacchus Marsh, and it is described
as the largest and most representa-
tive public dinner ever given in the
Marsh. The Hon. Duncan Gillies
(Premier), Hon. F. T. Derham
(Postmaster-General), Hon. C. H.
Pearson (Minister of Education),
Hon. H. J. Wrixon (Attorney-Gen-
eral), Hon. J. L. Dow (Minister of
Lands), Hon. J. Nimmo (Minister
of Public Works), Hon. M. H.
Davies, and Hon. J. Bell, Sir W. J.
Clarke, Hon. D. Melville, and
Messrs. Staughton, Rees, Field,
Reid, and Langridge, M.L.A., were
present. There were also many
gentlemen from various parts of
electorate, Ballan, Blackwood, Green-
dale, Lancefield, Newham, Upper
Macedon, Riddell’s Creek, Fleming-
ton, Pyke/s Creek, Bullengarook,
Pentland Hills, Melton and Mel-
bourne. The names of all these
appear in a lengthy report. Mr.
Mark Kyle occupied the chair, and
“he achieved a marked success in
that position.” Mr. T. Cain was
Vice-Chairman. Tfcere reigned a
wondrous unanimity among . the
diners, 140 in number, who sat
down to a repast “well supplied,
both in quality and quantity, with
a large staff of waiters, and was
unanimously pronounced to be
highly creditable to Mr. and Mrs.
Jones, of the Border Inn.” The
editorial interpolation could not be
withheld—“ Doth not a meeting like
this make amends for much that
was spiteful and pitiful in political
animosities of a few years back ?”
The report runs into four columns
of close type. Mr. Crisp was not
a stenographer, but he had a kind


of shorthand of his own, and,
blessed with a fine memory, he
could produce the sum and substance
of the most protracted utterances. I
do not intend to give in detail any
of the numerous speeches. Mr.
Deakin was eloquence itself, but I
would like to refer to the conclud-
ing part of the Chairman’s remarks,
when he proposed “Our Guest.”
The result of the Imperial Confer-
ence, which Mr. Deakin had attended
with such signal success, he trusted
would be great and enduring, and
that they would draw closer and
closer the ties that bound the colon-
ies to the mother country, so as
to make Australians proud that
they formed an integral part of that
great Empire upon which the sun
never sets, and to feel that they had
the aid of that empire in the de-
fence of their shores. Then should
the stern necessity arise of drawing
the sword to defend their hearths
and homes, Australians could enter
into the contest with spirit and con-
fidence, and would be able to de-
clare, in the words of the immortal
bard :
“Come the three corners of the world
in arms,
And we shall shock them.
Naught shall make her rue,
While England to herself doth keep
but true.”
A mighty big corner of the world
has come in arms, to wit, the Ger-
man military machine, and Mr. M.
Kyle’s prophecy has been proved
true, that so close have the ties
that bind the dominions to the
motherland been drawn, that the
Empire will fight to its last penny
and last man. .
August 6, 1887 : Dr. T. B. Ryan,
a native of Bacchus Marsh, and a
son of Mr. Jeremiah Ryan, has re-
cently started in practice at Clifton
Hill, and has consequently resigned
the position of resident physician,
which he held for three years, at
the Yarra Bend Asylum. He was
presented by the officers and staff
of Asylum with a handsome marble
clock and gold sovereign case.
August 6, 1887 ; A brass band
starts at Bacchus Marsh. About
£l6 collected to assist in buying in-
struments. A professional band-
master engaged—Mr. Riley, of Mel-
bourne, who was attached to both
militia and volunteers of the city,
August 20, 1887 : Mr. Michael
O’Connell had, seven or eight acres
of early horn carrots grown at
McKenzie's Flat, and he expects
them to yield 30 tons to the acre.
They were short, but of great girth.
The producer of the Marsh to-day
pins his faith to lucerne, and has
evidently no concern for by-product.
Constable John P. Leahy, a na-
tive of Bacchus Marsh, a son of one
of the original inhabitants at Yea,
August 20, 1887, immortalises him-
self, so averred the Benalla “Stand-
ard.” The facts shortly stated are,
that the river being in flood, five
Chinese were in. great danger.
Leahy was fearless. He first tried
to swim his horse across the cur-
rent. That failed. He also tried
to make a raft of railway sleepers,
but directly it felt the ,weight of
water it sank, and Leahy was nearly
drowned. A boat in the meantime
had been brought on the scene, and
Leahy rescued the Chinese. He was
however, so benumbed and fa-
tigued that he was at length utterly
powerless.
1887 Comparisons With Early Days.
Sept. 17th, and 24th, 1887, con-
tain two articles entitled “Early
Scenes Revisited.” From a local
historical point they are valuable.
The writer does not append his name.
The contributions are headed “By a
Resident of 1855.” That goes back
a fair distance indeed. The articles
are too lengthy to give in full. Ex-
tracts will have to suffice. I have
an idea the author was a Scotchman.
He opens with an expression of
pleasure at seeing the “dear auld
old hills again.” He says:
I found, on consulting “Brad-
shaw,” that the Marsh could now
be reached by rail in comparatively
short time, as compared with that
taken by Sam Slick, Smiley, or Sam
Crisp, in the early days of coaching.
After a few stoppages at wayside
stations, we passed over the famous
Werribee Viaduct, and the country
then began to present a more famil-
iar appearance. Around the neigh-
bourhood of Darbyshire’s, and be-
hind McDonald’s, I have often hunt-
ed in search of my father’s working


bullocks. I suppose all old land-
marks such as Burston's hut, Smith’s,
Daniels, Fourwheel Island Forest,
&c., are either obliterated or alto-
gether unknown to the Maddingley
schoolboys now-a-days. After leav-
ing the Parwan station I began to
look upon scenes around which mem-
ory fondly lingers. Some buildings
have altogether disappeared, notably
those occuppied by Coram, Toomey,
Shinnick, and Brown (in Scott’s pad-
deck) Edward’s, near Cook’s, Robbie
Grant’s Callannan’s, Lodge’s, and the
Iron school. I could see that Scott’s,
Cook’s, Clark’s, Dider’s, Mansfield’s,
Deveraux’s, W. Grant’s and White’s,
still remained. The Bacchus Marsh
station I found to be at Maddingley,
in what in my time was known as
the Government paddock, and not far
from where I first learned the ABC.
Few of your readers will remember
the first Maddingley school. It was
a miserable little slab structure in
Tom Cullen’s paddock, where a very
worthy man, Mr. Simon Morrison,
tried his best to impart instruction
to the children of the early settlers.
To this school McNicols, White’s,
Grants, Deverauxs, Caliannans, and
others went, along with the writer.
The school was afterwards removed
from that building to another of a
much humbler description, situated
up near where old Mr. Martin kept
a small shop. The school building
was also of slab, with a bark roof,
and an earthen floor, upon which
the boys often played marbles pro-
cured from Mr. Martin’s shop at a
cost of from 3d. to 4d. each. The
school was next shifted to a build-
ing specially erected, and called a
“National School.” It stood on a
little mound near the old showyards.
I was pleased to see that my old
friend and schoolmate, T. Anderson,
took an interest in local matters.
Well do I remember him, W. Lyle,
N. Turner, McNicol’s, T. Oliver, T.
Pearce, McKenzie’s, Hamilton’s, Mac-
Kay’s, McLeod’s, J. McDonald, J.
Kerr, Coram’s, Connell’s, Grant’s,
and a host of others playing round-
ers at a big tree near the school. I
look round for the school, but see
it not. After traversing the walk
in your well-kept park I met an in-
telligent lad who, in answer to my
inquiry, “What had become of Mad-
dingley school?” informed me it had
been removed, and now formed part
of Mr. Alford’s Railway hotel. I
think such information would pain
our respected teacher, Mr. Morrison,
who always impressed upon his
scholars the necessity of leading
temperate and virtuous lives. Al-
though Maddingley can no longer
support a school-master, nor can
keep up a school, it appears to be
able to run two hotels—Alford’s and
Yallence’s. The former name I know
not, but the latter I remember as the
occupier of one of the most ancient
dwellings up the Werribee, to find
that the bridge built by Rook and
Munro had disappeared, and one of
more modern design had been erect-
ed. Over the parapet of the old bridge
some of the hare brained youngsters
used to walk, much against their
teacher’s will. I now direct my steps
up the river, to find that the large
hole where the good swimmers used
to bathe, known as “Harry’s Hole,”
was drifted up. Those who attended
the Maddingley school will remember
that a notice was posted on the wall
warning boys not to bathe in the
Werribee, unless the written consent
of their parents had first been sent
into the teacher. Many a boy dipped
in the creek without that permission.
Following up the river I noticed that
all the old silver wattles had dis-
appeared. Those of your readers who
are recent arrivals in our district can
form no idea of the rich fragrance
these black wattles which thickly
studded the hill between John Good-
man’s and John Ward’s used to send
forth to the breezes, or of the splen-
did blossom on the scrub which
stood so thick and flourished luxur-
iantly all along Kennedy’s gully,
where the bronze wing pigeon w r as to
be found in vast numbers, and where
not unfrequently the kangaroo and
wallaby were to be seen disporting
themselves. Black duck and teal
were to be found in holes between
McKay’s and Lyle’s, and sometimes
as low down as Higgin’s or Grant’s.
The white man has cleared them all
away and the blackfellow and his
lubra are no longer to be seen hold-
ing their national corroboree. No
more Sulky Dick, Jimmy Cockatoo,
Johnny Mungy—all have gone ! I
visited the Maddingley cemetery,


where the names on many of the
tombstones reminded me of old
schoolfellows who succumbed to that
terrible diphtheria scourge which vis-
ited Maddingiey, and entered al-
most every house there. I retraced
my steps down past the showyards,
which have been enlarged and en-
closed in a most substantial manner.
Here I met an old lady, who was in
a very talkative mood. I remarked
that they had nice showgrounds. This
appeared to arouse the old lady’s
ire, and she denounced the Marsh
people for placing them there. I
learned from her remarks that she
thought the Marsh people had made
a raid on Maddingiey to secure all
the available ground and so pre-
vent Maddingiey going ahead. Had
she been a resident of Maddingiey
some thirty years ago, she might
have remembered the Marsh people
getting the lock-up removed to Bac-
chus Marsh (but not until after long
Harry had made his escape by work-
ing a stone out). He was not cap-
tured, although Sergeant Roberts
and Constable Quinn spent some
days in search for him. She might
also have remembered when a meet-
ing was got up by Mr. Grant (the
Dr’s brother) Mr. W. Anderson, Mr.
Howden, and some others, to pro-
tect the rights of Maddingiey, that
the Marsh people, headed by Mr.
Young and Mr. Crook, came over in
numbers and outvoted them. After
leaving my talkative friend, I could
not help noticing that the cattle now
depastured on the flat were of a
much smaller and leaner kind than
the grand old bald-faced breed
which were to be seen there in
former years. What chasing after
cattle there was at the bridge when
Billy Brooks, Billy Aspinall, and
Harvey Pike, used to round up the
stock for trespassing on the back
blocks for the purpose of impound-
ing them. The mention of stock
also reminds me of a later date,
when Tom Patterson, mounted on
old Stumpy, with the ever-faithful
Flora running close behind, occa-
sionally brought down cattle upon
which the horse shoe tar brand was
not visible, and which had not paid
the common fee. I now set out for
the Marsh. On arrival at the town-
ship further change was observable.
The Border Inn, formerly Bartholo-
mew’s, is now kept by E. G. Jones ;
Young’s flour mill is obscured by
other buildings. It was there that
the battles of olden time used to be
fought, when men like Young,
Crook, James, Thomas, Watson,
McLean, McLeod, Porter, Kitson,
Grant and others used to assemble
to discuss affairs pertaining to the
well-being of the colony. Often have
I begged little Jimmy Knox, the
miller, to take me up stairs to the
top of the mill to look out from the
top windows. The mill has also
changed hands since then, and is
now motionless —through, I am told,
farmers giving up wheat growing.
In olden times it worked night and
day. W. B. Marsh’s store is now a
hairdressing establishment ; R.
Bence’s butcher shop now owned
by Paterson, tailor and outfitter. An
hotel stands where J. Carroll’s boot
shop once stood. Peter Robinson
and his famous Japan Blacking re-
citation no longer enliven Marsh
audiences. Taubman’s post-office
store is occupied by a grocer and
chaffcutter. The name J. Simpson,
senior, still shows forth in golden
tetters over his establishment. What
became of Humphrey Nash, and the
old chestnut cob ? A new Mechan-
ics’ and reading room have been
erected, which speaks well for the
enterprise of the residents. David
Dyer, solicitor, is away, his office
being now a private dwelling. On
the other side Bocoult, the French-
man, who sold dates, and whose
wife acted as barber to some of the
residents, appears to have sold out
to a Chinese gardener. Smillis’s
boarding house is a blacksmith’s
shop. Breen’s grocery is a bakery,
James Innis Murray is no more, and
his hotel is in other hands. J. Law-
ton’s wine and spirit store is a pri-
vate dwelling. The “Tea Chest” is
still there, also Forsyth’s shop. I
saw Forsyth going out apparently to
place some poor fellow in his last
resting place. He was driving a
hearse drawn by two black horses.
Driving a white bullock in single
harness in olden times was even
slower work than heading a funeral
procession. I observe the name An-
derson & Co. over a shop, and step
over to see my schoolfellow, only to


learn that he is in Melbourne. I
continue my journey onward past
the post-office, where, I think, a
Doctor once lived, to Pearce Bros,
shop, and enquired for Mr. Thomas
Pearce, and learned he was at his
chicory kiln, but that his brother
would soon return. I called at the
Court House hotel (formerly Smith
and Purday’s saddlery establishment)
and after having partaken of a good
luncheon continued my journey up-
ward, to find that the house where
Mr. Dunn has kept school has been
pulled down, also that Sandy Mur-
doch’s house was invisible. Wat-
son’s still remained. At the top of
the hill the brick house in Higgin’s
paddock remains, and is much im-
proved in appearance. The resi-
dence of Phil. Davis, the painter,
and John Hamilton, the bootmaker,
are gone, and the Quarry Arms is
turned into a farmer’s dwelling. No
teamsters travel the roads to Bal-
larat now, as of yore, who require
to refresh their thirsty selves after
reaching the top of hill. I much re-
gret that my own business compelled
me to return without having been
able to meet any of my old school-
fellows. I had, however, spent a
pleasant day, and was glad to see
that the Marsh was progressive.
The late Molesworth Greene, of
Greystones, had been, for the last
thirty or forty years, a public man
in every sense of the word. I have
referred more than once to his ex-
cellent literary attainments. He
evidently was a shining product of
what is termed a “liberal English
education.” There is no doubt that
he was an Englishman; anyhow in
his instincts and general mode of
thinking such is the case. I am
prompted to make these comments
on reading correspondence having
appeared in “Argus”, and quoted
in “Express” of Oct. 15th, 1887.
Mr. Greene writes a most forcible
letter on “Woman’s suffrage” in re-
gard to entrance into medical pro-
fession, the doors of which had been
so rigidly shut in her face. Mr.
Greene threw himself heart and
soul into a propaganda for the
abolition of those restrictions which
interfered with the usefulness of
women. The letter was as follows :
—Sir, —ln the “Argus” of to-day I
have just read a most temperate,
dignified, and pathetic appeal from
young lady medical students to the
University Council. The reports of
discussions which have appeared in
the press from time to time on the
subject of medical classes for both
sexes have been a source of intense
disgust and indignation to all those
who love fair play, and who are de-
sirous to improve the status of wo-
men. Public opinion has been
strong enough to insist that women
shall be allowed to enter the Uni-
versity. The authorities having
been forced to yield in this matter,
are now attempting to render that
hardly-won boon nugatory. Can it
be a miserable trade-union feeling
that prompts the professors to shut
out their sister women from a pro-
fession already crowded ? Do they,
on this low, sordid ground, wish to
condemn so many keen active in-
telligences to waste and inaction ?
Are they desirous of perpetuating
that old barbarous unwritten law
which decrees that every woman
must provide herself with a hus-
band, failing which she is to pass
her life suffering from the dull fever
of unused faculty ?
But what has stirred my blood
chiefly in all this discussion is the
assumption of superior modesty on
the part of the professors, and their
implication that there is a want of
delicacy on the part of the women.
The want of generosity—the total
absence of chivalry—can no further
go.
There is no more brutal method
of stopping a woman’s mouth than
by accusing her of want of delicacy.
The man who strikes her with his
fists is comparatively a paladin, and
these men who refuse to make ar-
rangements that will enable women
to study medicine yet approve of
male practitioners attending women
in childbirth, and treating them for
the most intimate ailments. If
modesty be the desideratum, I do
not think that it is achieved by
those who refuse to educate female
practitioners to attend on women.
Do the professors charge with indel-
icacy the women of chivalric times
who learned and practised the
leech’s art ? In any case, I suppose
1 could not ask for a character for


poor Iseult. Yet, though a right-
eous generation may blame her ex-
tra legal love, it has never yet oc-
curred to anyone to call her indeli-
cate.
“No art the poison might with-
stand,
No medicine could be found,
Till lovely Iseult’s lily hand
had probed the ranking wound.”
—I am, &c., Molesworth Greene.
In 1887, Telemachus contributed
a series of articles to the “Argus,”
on Bacchus Marsh. They form ex-
cellent reading. The articles ere
more contemplative than descriptive.
I shall not attempt a resume, but
recapitulate a few of the writer’s
points. Captain Henry Bacchus’ ad-
vent into this locality was really
contemporary with the accession of
Queen Victoria. This sovereign’s
reign commenced in 1837: There-
fore the settlement of Bacchus is
beginning to take on a certain
amount of hoary antiquity. Tele-
machus objects to the name Bacchus
Marsh, for he declared it was a
misnomer, and was bad, also in a
dual sense. “Maddingiey” did not
suit, for it distinguished an abor-
tive attempt at a township just
without the railway gates. “Barley”,
too, was unsuitable, for it disting-
uished a village that died at its
birth a little further down. Why
not, said Telemachus, call the town
‘Larradoc,” a corruption of “Lair-
dedairk,” for such was the Herder-
derg called by Captain Bacchus.
Telemachus homilises : “So in this
way and every other way go on and
prosper old town of Bacchus Marsh.
You have many advantages. Nature
dowered you very freely, and 1
think that recently a little political
influence, or a little judicious intri-
gue, gave you another advantage in
carrying that main trunk Melbourne-
Adelaide railway right past your
border. It cost a good many thous-
and pounds to make that divergence,
a good many tens of thousands to
get down to you—it will cost a good
many more to get out again. You
say the bullock-drivers were the
best surveyors, and they in the days
of old always traversed the Marsh
on their way from Melbourne to
Ballarat. Well, there is more than
a little truth in that, but bullock-
drivers were a little dependent on
water and grass, were they not ?
They could not make a pond, and
a pump and a tank as the railway
engineers, and fill up and thunder
along for five and twenty miles,
heeding nothing of grass or corn.
I think a straighter and a cheaper,
and a better route might have been
discovered had only Melbourne and
Ballarat been considered, and then,
at a cost of about £.10,000, might
not a tram line been run out
which would have satisfied all your
wants ? But you had your way; you
are a township now, and may some
day be a city on the main trunk
line of Australia. Brisbane, Sydney,
Melbourne,-,Larradoc, Adelaide.
Telemachus, in his eleven columns
of “reflections” —for “description”
might be gathered up into half-a-
column, gives every indication of
the cultured mind. I conclude our
resurrection of the graceful writer
by his description of the Rowsley
mansion ; —Greystones has not yet
acquired the dignity of age, though
creepers of many varieties have
overgrown most of its balconies, and
run far up into its gables. The
avenue is in its infancy, but the
garden has already been brought to
perfection. The house is large, com-
modious, handsome, substantial,
worthy in every respect to be styled
a mansion. But one is not struck
so much by the proportions of the
house, the breadth of the view, the
extent of the garden ground, as by
the happy choice of site, and the
skilful adaptation of all means to
one end the development of
beauty. Not a tree that could be
spared has been cut down—not a
rock that could be covered with
creepers removed. Beautiful flowers,
beautifully arranged, are the most
charming objects Nature provides,
perhaps, for near acquaintance of
the human eyes, and therefore close
before the great window of the
drawing-room a flower garden has
been arranged, where even in win-
ter there is a plentiful variety of
foliage and bloom, dahlias and
chrysanthemums still lingering, vio-
lets and snowdrops peeping out,
geraniums in abundance, and a


few roses retaining their fragrance,
though deprived of a little of their
beauty by the rain. Adjoining this
broad patch of rich soil, , devoted
wholly to the culture of flowers, are
well gravelled walks, with lawns and
shrubberies, terraces of turf and
rockeries, where in spring time a
blaze of colour will be reflected in
innumerable pools of water and the
rich green of luxurious foliage will
contrast with dull browns and greys
of the ordered ruggedness of the
walls. Along every border of the
garden fair a strip of ivy has been
planted, making a trim, soft, ever-
green ribbon, which no heat scorches
and no rush of storm-water can ever
disturb. It is a new use for the
ivy green, and one to which in the
future he will doubtless be largely
applied. Another novel idea—mak-
ing of a sometimes unsightly object
a thing of beauty is the planting
geraniums on either side of a gar-
den drain. A drain, a ditch, haw-
haw, a water channel of some de-
scription, is a necessity in every
great garden, and ’tis difficult at all
times to prevent this necessity as-
suming an ungainly appearance.
The difficulty has been overcome at
Greystones by planting geraniums
on either side. They have grown as
willows on a river bank. In drought
time they overhang the dry chan-
nel. In flood time the storm waters
roar through them and do no harm.
They are always luxuriously green
and starred or crowned with bloom.
Very beautiful does it all appear
when the early morning sun strikes
across the open forest country right
eastward. The mist is down through
the trees then, and the leaves kindle
into gold, or shine as if the sun-
beams touched them with an equal
transparent gloss, above a surface
white as burnished silver. The dew
or the rain drops on the broad grey
plain sparkle; the bare hill a couple
of miles away seems covered with
ripened wheat ; Station Peak and
the You Yangs beacon out as the
red light strikes along the world
and catches their crowns ; all the
flowers in bloom distil their odours,
and the air is full of fragrance, as
the world of beauty. It is pleasant
to be out in the Greystones garden
on any early morning in summer or
winter, provided always that the sun
shines.
“When the clouds, like hooded friars
Tell their beads in drops of rain/’
and the hills are hidden, and only
a narrow space of plain is seen,
when the sheep huddle by the stone
wall, and the turkey bustard sits
disconsolate, it is better to be at
ease within the hospitable walls. I
do not propose to present any de-
tailed pictures of interiors. It is
enough to say that the companion
taste to that which prepared and
made the garden has ordered all
things good within the home.
Dec. 19, 1887 : “The uncommon
spectacle of a walking funeral, after
the manner of those seen is mining
districts of England, was witnessed
in Bacchus Marsh on Thursday
afternoon, when about 150 navvies,
walking two abreast, and six of
them carrying a coffin on their
shoulders, passed down the Main
street on their way to the Roman
Catholic cemetery. The coffin was
only carried in that way for a short
distance. The man was named
McNamara, aged 54 years, and had
been engaged upon the works but
a few days. He was in weak health,
and apparently could not afford to
remain idle any longer, and he died
at his work of heart failure. He
had a son of 14 with him. The men
in his gang generously subscribed
£lO for funeral expenses, and lost
half-a-day in attending the funeral.”
Mr. L. Dugdale, of Myrniong,
never spared expense to procure the
best strain of stock. A couple of
issues prior to the one I am now
perusing I noticed that he had given
£2OO for a bull, and £BO and £2O
for two cows. I am not surprised
that I should now read—Dec. 3,
1887 —that his successful record at
Ballarat show should be as follows:
First, one-year-old draught colt ;
second, draught foal ; second, blood
mare ; first, Shorthorn bull, aged ;
first and second. Shorthorn cow ;
first, 2-yr-old Shorthorn heifer; first
and second, yearling Shorthorn hei-
fer.
Athletes of a past generation.
Dec. 10, 1887 ; “The foot race be-
tween Messrs. John Burbidge and
Ed. L. Simpson took place on Sat-
urday afternoon last, on Mr. Stobie’s


land, in Young street. There were
three heats of 120, 130 and 140
yards, but four were run, as the
first was declared to be a dead heat;
of the other three Burbidge won two.
The match was for £lO aside.”
1888.
Jan. 21, 1888 : “The contract for
additions to be made to Royal hotel
was let to Mr. W. R. Cooper, late
of Ballan, and now of Clifton Hill,
at a price amounting to £1,500.
The new two-storey building is to
front Young street, and will be of
brick, on concrete foundation, with
bluestone base. Mr. Manning is to
be congratulated upon making these
additions, which will greatly im-
prove that end of the town.”
Feb. 4, 1888 : There was one
lucky prominent resident in Bacchus
Marsh, who held interests in the
celebrated Broken Hill silver mines,
worth £40,000 at the market rates
ruling at the time. His original
outlay of £I,OOO had been recouped
to him by sales, so that the £40,000
was clear gain. The prominent in-
habitant’s name is not given, but
a hope was expressed that the fav-
orable results would prove perman-
ent, not transitory owing to falls in
value, as the individual referred to
had undertaken a full share of Aus-
tralian pioneering experiences and
enterprise with its good and bad
fortune.
A paragraph appears Feb. 11,
1888, recording the death of the
Hon. Henry Miller, who had been
ill for over twelve months, suffering
from paralysis, and with bronchitis
supervening. Mr. Miller was well-
known throughout Australia as
“Money Miller,” from his reputed
wealth, and his evident love of it,
in which he was not different—so
runs the paragraph—from the most
of mankind, though they expected
moneyed-men to be unusually lib-
eral. Mr. Miller outlived his gener-
ation, and his public services were
forgotten, though thirty years prior
they had not been inconsiderable.
His wealth was variously estimated
at from one to three millions, but
the paragraph asserted that it would
probably be under a million. It
was mostly represented by shares
and house property, so that public
knew very little about it. The Bac-
chus Marsh property it was thought
was presented some years previously
to Messrs. Albert and Septimus
Miller. Local residents were inter-
ested in that the decease would re-
sult in the property being leased in
small farms, or sold to a resident
owner. History, however, has un-
folded up to date that the wishes of
local residents has never had real-
isation. Mr. Miller was the son of
a Captain in the Army, and was
born in Londonderry, where his rela-
tives had held good positions for
centuries. Mr. Miller came to this
colony from Tasmania, where he
held a Government appointment,
and having saved money he invested
it in land in Richmond, which
turned out well, and all his other
investments, without exception
prospered.
The wishes of the local residents
are that just as Tullamore has been
transformed from an unkept un-
productive state into one of fertility,
so the rest of Broadlands may come
under the same process of trans-
formation, and the bottom end of
the Marsh would then constitute a.
panorama of numerous neat home-
steads, each surrounded by its belt
of profitable green. And surely if
any extent of country has the pos-
sibilities of a Land of Promise it
is the valley of the Marsh, with its
soil of most fertile ingredient—a soil
of greatest depth, and proving that
its output only increases with the
earnestness of treatment. It is an
easy thing to prophesy that some
day not a block of unfilled land will
be found in any part of the flat.
The Melbourne correspondent of
the “Sydney Mail” thus wrote of
the death of Mr. Miller :—The death
of Mr. Henry Miller, the opulent
banker, has been so long anticipated
that it occasioned but little stir
when it actually occurred. His whole
life was devoted to moneymaking.
Every faculty of his mind was con-
centrated upon that occupation ; and
all the surrounding circumstances of
time and place contributed to his
remarkable success. Much of this
was due to his great sagacity, ten-
acity and purpose, sound judgment,
and intense acquisitiveness ; but
some of it also to sheer good luck.


and the “unearned increment” in
the value of the real estate he pur-
chased from time to time. His first
great coup was his undertaking to
finance the construction of the two
trunk lines of railway from Geelong
to Ballarat and from Melbourne to
Sandhurst respectively for Messrs.
Cornish and Bruce, the contractors.
In those days the rate of bank in-
terest and the charges for commis-
sion were much higher than they
are now. Six millions and a-half
passed through Mr. Miller’s hands
in connection with those undertak-
ings, and you may imagine that
such a stream of currency must
have deposited a rich sediment of
gold in the channel through which
it flowed. The deceased banker be-
lieved implicity in the old maxim,
“Look after the pence, the pounds
will take care of themselves.” I
remember at the settlement of some
executorship accounts, at which a
cheque for a large amount had to
be handed over to Mr. Miller, he
refused to receive ine cheque or
sign the receipt. Both were 2d.
short of the sum due; and one of
the solicitors present had to fish up
the coins from the depth of his
trousers pocket before the transac-
tion could be adjusted. The wealth
which the deceased gentleman leaves
behind him is variously estimated
at sums ranging from three to five
millions sterling. I am told by an
intimate friend of his that towards
the close of his life Mr. Miller ex-
pressed some disappointment at
having been unable to gratify his
ambition to accumulate the larger
of the two amounts.
Two interesting items in “the
news of the day,” Feb. 18, 1888 :
After our paper was published last
Friday afternoon we received a let-
ter from Melbourne without any
signature, but with four very sat-
isfactory signatures inside upon two
£lO notes of the Union Bank. The
sender requested us to acknowledge
receipt by publishing the words.“£2o
received.” He will admit upon re-
flection, that our doing so without
any explanation would subject us to
the suspicion of receiving money for
some purpose which was not reput-
able, and therefore could not be ex-
plained, and as po explanation we
can give of the matter will be so
satisfactory as publishing the letter,
we trust the writer will excuse our
doing so, especially as we value it
very highly, and beg to thank him
for yielding to a generous impulse.
The letter is as follows :—Melbourne
10th Feb., 1888. C. Crisp, Esq.,
“Express” Office, Bacchus Marsh,
Dear Sir, —Having read your paper
for many years and admiring the
indefatigable way in which you
have advocated the interests of the
Marsh and surrounding district on
broad public grounds, and feeling
assured that such advocacy has been
to your own disadvantage by loss
of subscribers who have not agreed
with you on “every point,” I beg
your acceptance of the enclosed
twenty-pounds (£2O). To show that
it is received and accepted in the
same kindly spirit that it is offered,
may I ask your simple acknowledg-
ment in next week’s paper, thus —
“£2O received.”
We had an opportunity on Tues-
day last of inspecting the irrigation
race constructed by Mr. James Kerr
to water about 45 acres on the Ler-
derderg flats. Mr. Kerr has a
splendid run of water, ample for
his requirements, and although the
making of the race was difficult in
places along the precipitous cliffs of
the Lerderderg banks, the whole
scheme is extremely simple, and is
an indication of what the public
scheme ought to be and would be if
the work were carried out by a few
practical miners, of such men as
Mr. George Cairns, who had very
much to do with the overcoming of
difficulties in this scheme. The off-
take is a mile up the creek from Mr.
Kerr’s paddocks, and the whole
river could be turned into the race
if need be without any weir other
than a row of small boulders. By
using powder and a lot of hand
labor Mr. IKerr was enabled to run
the race round cliffs which it was
at first thought would have to be
flumed, and there can be no doubt
that the main race of the public
scheme now before the Lerderderg
landowners could be similarly car-
ried . round the bluff lower down,
which is a much less formidable one
that Mr. Kerr’s race is taken on.
Mr. Kerr commenced the channel in


July 1886, and had it finished in
November. Last year he watered
about thirteen acres, and is extrem-
ely well satisfied with the results,
and also with what watering he has
done this year. He is a great ad-
vocate for the use of calico hose to
distribute the water, as it is a rapid
and effective mode of applying the
water just where it is wanted, and
saves no end of trouble in making
races and levelling “bumps,” as, by
coiling the hose round, any of these
can be surmounted ; besides which
the use of the hose saves a lot of
land which would otherwise be cut
up by the channels. Mr. Kerr pre-
serves his race from damage by
storm water overflow by the very
simple expedient of lowering the
banks at suitable places for a bye-
wash. The scheme is highly credit-
able to his enterprise, and shows
what can be done by individual ef-
fort. The channel was surveyed by
Mr. W. E. Standfleld, and the levels
were taken by him, but the actual
work was done by Mr. Kerr and
Mr. George Cairns, of whose ability
in such matters Mr. Kerr has a very
high opinion.
The name of Mr. Joe Lodge is
well-known locally. The District
Exhibit at the Royal Show is sum-
med up in “Joe Lodge,” and the
community take it for granted that
he is the only man that can ’run
that Exhibit. It is to be hoped for
the continued success of the reputa-
tion of the District at the Royal
Show that Mr. Lodge will have the
length of years of an antediluvian.
I find in those early files that Mr.
Lodge was a great ploughman, fur-
ther, that he was a champion. In
1888 and earlier he is taking on
another role; he is a prize-taking
rifleman, and on Feb. 18, 1838, it
is recorded that Mr. J. Lodge, of
Maddingley, had won a prize of £8
at the Sydney rifle matches.
Poor old Bacchus Marsh of 18 88:
not even a kerosene lamp shedding
forth its “dim religious light”; cer-
tainly not a gaslight with incandes-
cent burner. But Bacchus Marsh
of 1917, “ don’t plume your feath-
ers.” There are towns of less size
to-day in our State that have elec-
tric effulgence, not only in the
streets, but in the private home, and
you have only to touch the button
and the dwelling is a glow of illu-
mination, and electric warmers and
cookers are the last word in this
aspect of civilisation. But, Bacchus
Marsh in 1888 must by night have
presented a dismal appearance I
quote a letter from “Non Semper Re-
fulgens.”
Sirs, —I should like to call the at-
tention of the Shire Council of Bac-
chus Marsh to the bad lighting of
the principal street of the Marsh.
Having occasion to post a letter
some time ago at night, I left home
with the intention of reaching the
Post-office, and judge my astonish-
ment when in the main street, I
could hardly see my hand before me,
and it was raining also; and I step-
ped into the gutter several times
before reaching my destination,
through the Council’s neglect in not
having proper lamp-posts erected for
the convenience of strangers who
are not used to prowling about like
owls in the dark. I suppose the mem-
bers of the Council themselves fol-
low the footsteps of the canine tribe,
and traverse the street by instinct,
surely a few lamp-posts, with kero-
sene lights in them, would not cost
much, and would be a great conven-
ience to the numerous strangers who
are frequenting Bacchus Marsh, es-
pecially as winter is coming on, and
dark nights will be prevalent. Trust-
ing this suggestion will meet with
the Council’s approval, I remain, &c.,
Non Semper Refulgens.
Mr. John Johnston, Curator of
Maddingley Park, contributed valu-
able gardening notes month by
month to the “Express.” On March
3, 1888, he bursts forth into song,
and somehow it reads not out of
joint with a war development of the
present day that sets our blood
atingling that Australia will be there.
A SONG FOR AUSTRALIA.
A song for thee Australia!
Where the sun of freedom shines;
Where the wattle blooms so beauti-
ful
And the parrot’s plumage shines.
Where the kangaroo and emu,
So fondly sport and play.
And wild flowers spring and echoes
ring
In the silent forest gay.


Chorus —-
Australia, land of grandeur,
With her bright sunny sky;
Living in harmony with all nations
In freedom and enterprise.
Proud may we boast of Australia!
With towering mounds so gay;
Where the foaming waves dash on
the shore
And spread their silvery spray.
And the sunbeams sparkling on the
foam
As the seagulls proudly glide,
While the wild birds sing their
notes of charm
And the Jackasses laugh with pride.
Chorus —Australia, land, &c.
Australia, proud Australia,
Where gold and silver’s found;
Where the Union Jack waves in the
breeze,
Where the proud Scotch thistle’s
found;
And the shamrock, too, with its light
green leaf
As gay as in Emerald’s isle;
And the rose of dear old England
Together with the myrtle twines.
Chorus —Australia, land, &c.
The Rose, the Thistle and Shamrock,
Have joined in Uxiion bands;
And who be he would separate
those three
In these fair sunny lands.
They will stand together, and twine
together,
And protect Australian shores;
And never will yield while the grass
is green
Or the Eucalyptus grows.
Chorus- —Australia, land, &c.
John Johnston.
Maddingley Park, Jan. 28, 1888.
April 7, 1888: “The Peerewur
estate, belonging to the family of
the late W. H. Bacchus, Esq., has
been bought by Hon. Thomas Bent.
Mrs. Bacchus proposes leaving the
colony, so that the chapter in the
history of Bacchus Marsh, which
commenced with the settlement in it
of the late Captain Bacchus, father
of the above-named gentleman, may
be said to be now closed, unless in-
deed the son of the late Mr. Bacchus
should remain in the colony.”
April 21, 188 8 : Generosity of a
Bacchus Mlarsh native. Mr. A. D.
Hodgson, the Bacchus Marsh native
alluded to, is described as ‘‘the well-
known Melbourne solicitor and land
speculator.” He writes : City
Bank Chambers, Melbourne, 2nd
April, 1888. Thomas Anderson,
Esq., Sec. of Trustees of Madding-
ley Park, Bacchus Marsh. Dear Sir,
Having a warm feeling of interest,
in the welfare and progress of my
native place, Bacchus Marsh, I wish
to signalise my satisfaction at the
completion of the water scheme by
requesting your Trustees to accept
an offer from me of a cheque of
£75, to be expended in the erection
of a suitable fountain of such de-
sign and style as Trustees may ap-
prove of, to be fixed in Maddingley
Park. If possible, I would like to
see same completed by 24th May
next. —Tours faithfully, A. D. Hodg-
son.
Asphalting of Bacchus Marsh foot-
path commences April 28, 1888.
Mr. Edward Sloss, of Maddingley,
presented to Maddingley Park a
drinking fountain to be erected
near entrance gate.
Land sales, 18 88. Eight and a-
half acres at Maddingley, belonging
to Mrs. Mitcham, and close to pass-
enger entrance to Bacchus Marsh
station, have been sold for £SOO.
Two acres of lucerne land, known
as Dunn’s, near Graham street, were
sold for £7 5 each. A portion of
Mr. W. Grant’s Millbank property,
extending from his house to the
Ballarat road, and to his boundary
with Mr. O’Hagan’s land, was
bought by Mr. Lockhart, a Mel-
bourne speculator, at a price which
with eight acres of lucerne land on
opposite side of road, at rear of
cheese factory averaged about £7O
per acre. The purchaser’s inten-
tion was to subdivide the land into
business and villa sites, and submit
them to auction. Mr. M. O’Con-
nell’s Bald Hill paddock, which con-
tains the Bacchus Marsh freestone
quarries, was sold at £lO per acre.
Mr. Hearle’s land, known for many
years as Dunbar’s farm, Pentland
Hills, was bought by a widow from


Dandenong, at £l4 per acre, or
about £1,400 advance in less than
twelve months. “Heagney’s Cor-
ner” is the old name of the pro-
perty at the junction of Main street
with Maddingley road. There was a
store run by Mr. Heagney. A few
years previously the property had
been sold to Mr. Mawson, for
£6OO. It was part of Mr. M. P.
Farrell’s estate. In 1888, Mr. T.
G. Pearce purchased it, at an ad-
vance upon price paid by Mr. Maw-
perty again changed hands, the pur-
chaser being Mr. E. G. Jones, of
the Border Inn. Mr. Pearce gained
£325 by the transaction. The last
selling price was £1,02 5, for three-
quarters of an acre of land, and a
small brick store. The Glenmore
Estate, 11,500 acres, was sold to Mr.
James Mirams, for £7 5,000. The
Ingliston estate, near Ballan, con-
taining 10,2 80 acres (exclusive of
the pre-emptive section) to the Hon.
T. Bent, for the sum of £92,200.
Mr. W. Grant, of the Border Mill,
who had left the Marsh only some
twelve months before, was reported
to have sold his purchase of pro-
perty, Barbiston, Tullamarine, at
an advance of £2,700.
The will of the Hon. Henry Miller
was filed for probate. It was signed
only the day before the testator
died. It did not deal with so large
an amount of property as it was
popularly supposed it would, but it
was stated that there might be as
sets in estate outside Victoria. The
total was £1,300,210, and that
amount was to be divided equally
among five sons and three daughters
of deceased ; less sums each may
have received from him during his
life. The trustees were the three
elder sons, and they had power to
delay disposing of the property until
such time as they chose. There were
no donations to charities. The pro-
bate duty amounted to £65,000.
Mr. W. E. Standfield Was for a
great many years Engineer and
Secretary of the Bacchus Marsh
Shire. In every sense of the word
he was a capable officer. He had
much to do with the establishment
of the local water supply system.
The works were carried out under
his active planning and supervis-
ion. He was popular. He visits—
-188 and the finale is
particularly sad —indeed tragic. I
quote a paragraph in “Express,”
June 16, 1888 : Some particulars
have come to hand this week of the
circumstances attending the death of
Mr. W. E. Standfield. About this
time last year, Mr. A. Forsyth, of
Bacchus Marsh, was visited by a
cousin of his, Mrs. Hutchinson, a
lady of independent means, residing
near Edinburgh. Mr. Forsyth ar-
ranged that Mr. Standfield should
call upon her during his contem-
plated visit to Edinburgh, and Mrs.
Hutchinson was expecting him to
call when she received a telegram
from Dr. Wyman, of London, an-
nouncing his death, and asking if
she knew of the address of his rela-
tives. To this she replied, giving
what information she possessed, and
subsequently Dr. Wyman wrote to
her the following letter, which was
sent out to Mr. Forsyth, and placed
at our disposal : 2 5 Montague Place,
Russell Square London, W.C., May
4th, 1888. —Mrs. Hutchinson.—Es-
teemed Madam, —My excuse for de-
laying to answer your note at once
is simply that I have been so very
busy ever since Mr. Standfield’s
death searching and telegraphing in
all directions for his sister, and per-
forming other necessary duties, that
I have been unable to write until
the present moment. Fortunately I
discovered the name and place of
residence of his brother-in-law, Dr.
Henry Horsfall, of Masham, Bedale,
Yorkshire, and latu on Monday even-
ing received a despatch stating that
he would be at the inquest to be
held on Tuesday at 5 o’clock. He
came, and after the jury had ren-
dered their verdict, he was permit-
ted to take charge of the body and
went with it that same night on the
12 o’clock train to Sheffield, where
a brother to Mr. Standfield lives (an
Invalid) and there the body will be
buried in the family plot with father
mother and other members of the
family. The cause of death was
apoplexy. We found the address of
his brother-in-law in Australia, and
telegraphed him the notice of his
death, and to-morrow I will write a
long letter of particulars by the
steamer. I happened to be staying


at the hotel previous to his coming
there and he made himself friendly
with me, also with a clergyman who
boarded there. He was under med-
ical treatment all the time of his
stay in London waiting to get well
enough to visit his relatives, and
had intended to go to his sister’s
(at Masham) on last Monday. I am
only on a visit to London from
America for rest, and the benefit of
my health, and only conversed with
Mr. Standfield at our morning meal,
and in the evening, he spending
part of each day at his physician’s,
and the balance in out-door exer-
cise, in accord with his directions.
Providentially I was able to devote
my time to searching out his rela-
tives, otherwise they would not have
been found (as neither their address
nor names were found among his
effects) and he would have been
buried as a stranger in his own na-
tive land. I am so glad that this
was prevented, and that he will lie
among his own kindred. Thanking
you for your helpfulness in this sad
occurrence, I remain yours respect-
fully, Dr. Wyman. P.S. —Mr. Stand-
field was a widower with two sons
—one at school in Sydney, the other
with his aunt (Marie E. Cresswell)
at Tasmania. His brother-in-law is
a solicitor in Sydney, New South
Wales —Thos. E. Cresswell, who is
made executor of his will, leaving
his property to his sons in case of
his death. These facts we found
from a copy thereof, the original
will having been executed at Sydney
just the day before he sailed for
England.”
“Express” Files, 1888.
June 30, 1888'. Mr. W. Grant,
of Millbank, presented to Mr. John-
stone, Curator of Maddingley Park,
a handsome eagle, formed of cement,
three feet high, and weighing 2cwt.
This was to be placed upon a rock-
work arch, which Mr. Johnstone had
formed in the lake. Mr. Boxshall,
stationmaster, undertook to supply
the lake with gold fish. Mr. James
Alford, of the Railway hotel, Mad-
iugley, paid for cost of ornamental
fence round fountain.
The subdivisional sale of portion
of Millbank estate was a great suc-
cess. Being township lots accounted
for the great interest in the sale,
which was conducted by Mr. Bail-
lieu, of Messrs. Munro & Baillieu.
A special train brought about 300
people from Melbourne, and the
local attendance was about as large.
Cr. John Turner, of Prahran, was
the principal buyer, as he took 15
out of 4 5 lots offered. The lots var-
ied from £3/19/ per foot (block at
corner of Maddingley road and Pil-
mer street) to 9/6 per foot, but the
general price ranged between £1 and
£2, and £3 per foot.
Still another donation to Madding-
ley Park. July 7, 1888. Editor re-
ceives letter, published unsigned :
“When in the Marsh I saw the arti-
ficial lake that is being made in the
Maddingley Park, with a large gum
tree on a little island in the centre,
and the idea shruck me what a pity
to let the water in until the said
little island was faced with stones;
boulders of white quartz, intermixed
with other stones, with forget-me-
not flowers growing out of it, would,
in my idea, make it very pretty. I
therefore enclose you £2O, which I
hope will be sufficient to do it, but
the one condition I impose is, my
name is never mentioned as the
donor.”
Sir W. J. Clarke presented £lO
in aid of water supply.
July 7, 1888. A Masonic Lodge,
called the Duke of Abercorn, was
opened in Bacchus Marsh on Friday
evening, 29th uit., by Sir W. J.
Clarke, who is Grand Master of
three Masonic Constitutions in Vic-
toria. He was accompanied hy sev-
eral of the Grand Lodge Officers
from Melbourne. Sir W. J. Clarke
was assisted by Brother Geo. Baker,
P.D.G.M.; R. O. Thompson, P.G.
G.W.; S. Franklin, P. G. T.; Aillis,
P.G.S.L.; Holmes, P.P.G.; P. Blas-
khi, P.D.G.S. W.C.E; T. H. Brain,
D.G.J.D., E.C. and others. The lodge
was instituted by Sir W. J. Clarke
acting as W.M., with brothers
Thompson and Holmes as his war-
dens. The ceremony of consecration
and dedication was impressively con-
ducted, after which the following
brethen were installed as first offic-
ers: —W. G. Symes, W.M., T. Box-
shall, S.W.; J. Johnstone, J.W.; E.
G. Jones, Treasurer and Secretary ;
Rev. M. Williams, Chaplain ; Rev.


J. A. Stewart, Rev. J. Addison White,
P.S.W.J.D.; Rev. E. Oakes, J.G ;
and J. Paul, Tyler. After the instal-
lation had taken place nine local
residents were duly elected, and
being present, were initiated by the
W.M., assisted by several past mas-
ters. The lodge was then closed,
and the brethren adjourned to the
Border Inn, where a splendid re-
past, prepared by host Jones was
partaken of. Loyal and Masonic
toasts were given and responded to,
in good speeches. Most of the Mel-
bourne visitors returned to town by
the morning train.
July 14, 1888, a half-acre block
in Main street, opposite the Mechan-
ics’ Institute, and known as Dr.
Lane’s, was sold by Mr. W. Ander-
son to Mr. Tanner for £l4O. Mr.
Anderson also sold a block on Stam-
ford Hill, known as Matson’s to Mr.
T. Anderson, at 16/6 per foot front-
age. The price would have been
higher, but for the filling required
to make the block level with the
path.
The Collingwood “Observer” is
quoted, July 14, 1888: —There was
a highly interesting social reunion
at the Albert Hall, Queen’s parade,
on Monday night, when Mr. Jere-
miah Ryan, the King of Clifton
Hill, gave a ball to his tenants and
the ladies engaged in the late South
Sea Exhibition, in honor of the mar-
iage of his son, Dr. Ryan. In mat-
ter of attendance, the event was too
successful as very few declined the
invitation, and the result was a
“crush,” there, being nigh four hun-
dred present, the ladies predominat-
ing. There was a good quadrille
band, and the floor was so well oc-
cupied the stage had also to be used
for the “sets.” Dolloffsky catered
in good style for the numerous
guests, there being a “standing sup-
per” at night. The old supper hall
upstairs, was dedicated to the
“weed” and cards, and the arrange-
ments all through were as perfect as
the big attendance would permit.
The ladies, as a rule, were richly
dressed, and seemed to enjoy them-
selves amazingly well, considering
the crush. We do not attach any
political or municipal significance to
the gathering, which was purely a
friendly one, although several candi-
dates were present, who confined
their canvassing mainly to the good
things in the supper room, which
may account for the run on the “pot-
heen.” Mr. Ryan was very attentive
to the comfort of his guests, and the
enjoyment intensified as the wee
hours began to lengthen and the
dancers diminish, leaving a wider
field for the saltatory exercises of
those who danced through the pro-
gramme. An interesting event oc-
curred during the night—the pres-
entation of an illuminated address
to Mr. Ryan from the ladies of the
South Sea Exhibition, in recognition
of his energy and liberality in con-
nection with that event. Mr. Quinlan
was the spokesman, and the sundry
toasts followed.
The Daylesford “Herald,” July 21,
188 8, speaks well of Mr. Evan Bona,
who is to succeed Mr. Yoysey in local
school. His personal friends at Day-
lesford presented him with a very
handsome gold Albert chain and
locket, the Masonic Lodge with a
Secretary’s jewel, and his school at
Musk Creek with a silver-mounted
marmalade cup, a silver toast rack,
eggstand, and a cut glass ink bottle,
and valedictory address.
July 28, 1888. A Lodge of United
Ancient Order of Druids, entitled
the Bacchus Marsh Lodge, was open-
ed on Wednesday, July 18th, at the
Royal hotel, by the President of the
Order, Brother Black, assisted by
Vice-President, Brother W. Boyd, the
Grand Guardian Brother Main, and
the following members of the Board
of Directors:—Past Presidents Boyd,
Curtis, and Tarver, and Bros. Bloom-
field, Sharp, Bassett, and Peacock,
who came from Melbourne for that
purpose. The candidates, fourteen
in number, were examined by Bro.
Dr. Fox, of Melbourne. The Lodge
having been duly opened, the candi-
dates were initiated by the President
assisted by the other officers. The
following officers were then duly
elected: —Arch Druid, Bro. Davis;
Vice Arch Druid, Brother Green;
Secretary, Brother Jenkins; Trea-
surer, Bro. Simpson; Inside Guard-
ian, Bro. Harper; Outside Guardian,
Bro. Donald Carter; Arch Bards,
Bros. Baldwin and Collie; Vice Arch
Bards, Bros. Wells and Urquhart.
They were then installed by the Vice-


President, Bro. W. Boyd, who de-
livered the various charges in a very
impressive manner. The President,
Bro. Black, gave an address to the
newly initiated brethren, and he was
followed by Past President Bro. Cur-
tis, who gave some very good advice
for the management for the lodge.
There are several other candidates
for membership who were not able
to be present. These will be initiated
on the next Lodge night, which will
be on Wednesday, Bth August.
Bacchus Marsh is properly mov-
ing. A number of meetings of
public had been held in regard to
the establishment of a gas company,
and August 1888, the consummation
is as follows: —Messrs. Coates & Co.
expect to be able to supply gas to
consumers in Bacchus Marsh by the
end of March or April next. They
have accepted the terms of the Shire
Council, and Mr. Hughes, solicitor,
approves of the agreement. Mr. G.
Swinburne, the managing partner in
the firm, visited Bacchus Marsh on
Tuesday last, and selected a site for
the works in Graham street. He
also ordered bricks, and is prepared
to start at once. He has telegraphed
to England for such portions of the
plant as are required. Some people
will probably be of opinion that the
gas works will be a nuisance in the
township, but we are assured by Mr.
Swinburne that such is not the case,
and that he does not find any objec-
tions made in other places. In
Shepparton his gasworksare in a
central street. We have also the
testimony of Mr. J. Bowser, form-
erly of Bacchus Marsh, but now ed-
itor and part proprietor of the Wan-
garatta “Chronicle,” that “Messrs.
Coates & Go’s, gas works are close
to the town and are in no sense a
nuisance, nor even an inconvenience
to neighbors; the Company have
appliances which prevent it.”
August 11, 1888, Mr. Alford, of
the Railway hotel, sold his hotel and
store for about £3,500. The pur-
chasers are the Carlton Brewery
Company.
Land in vicinity of railway sta-
tion on South side (45 acres) was
purchased for cash at £IOO per acre,
with 15 acres from Mrs. Mitcham at
same price. It was reported that
after purchase £l5O per acre was
offered, but price was refused. The
intention of the purchaser was to
cut up into building blocks. Sept.
1, 1888, sale takes place. Two
lengthy special trains brought 1,000
people to Marsh. The majority of
these turned out to be holiday mak-
ers not land buyers. The prices
ranged from £1 to £lO per foot.
Total sale, £10,953/17.
In connection with sale, “Ex-
press” stated that the first few
blocks were knocked down at start-
ling prices of £lO per foot for an 82
feet frontage to the corner of the
road immediately opposite the gate-
keeper’s house, being rather warm
for the purchaser, and very encour-
aging to the vendor. Mr. W. Holt,
of Coimadaf, was the purchaser, and
surmise was divided between the
supposition that he thought the
price was £lO for the block, and
that he was buying for a wealthy
brother-in-law in Melbourne. From
all we can hear, the former was the
case. The adjoining lot was knocked
down to Mr. R. Griffith, of Djerri-
warrh Creek, for £6/10/ per foot,
and this bid, too, was a mistake,
the paper believed, on part of pur-
chaser.
Bacchus Marsh, in August, 1888,
was much interested, if not excited,
in the racing success of Mr. J. O.
Ingiis, of Ingliston. His celebrated
horse, Malua, won the thousand
pounds Hurdle Race that is, the
Grand National Hurdle Race. Mr.
Ingiis rode the horse himself. This
was undoubtedly a wise policy, de-
clared the “Argus,” for the favorite
and ultimate winner was steered and
nursed throughout the race with the
judgment, nerve, and patience of a
practised cross-country horseman.
Malua added considerably to his
well-won Melbourne Cup, Austral-
ian Cup, Adelaide Cup and New-
market Handicap by his latest vic-
tory. It was a great race. The
Yeoman and The Victim, side by
side, came to the last hurdle; Malua,
true to his name, waiting just a
little while longer. The Yeoman
was in front over the last hurdle,
and for perhaps six strides on the
home side of it. Here the mighty
Malua, with that pace all racing men
knew so well, smothered in a few
strides the stout horse in front of


him, and won amid a salvo of cheers,
and extraordinary enthusiasm. The
excitement over Malua’s victory was
so prolonged, that people in the
bird cage found themselves cut
down to a few minutes for a peep at
the steeplechase horses. The des-
cription ended :—“A horse grows in-
to the regard of a Melbourne crowd
almost as deeply as a man, and if
old Malua should die to-morrow
(which Heaven forbid) and be
awarded a public funeral, he would
have almost as large a following as
an admiral or general who by some
great victory had saved the State.”
T. Cain, President of Bacchus
Marsh Agricultural Society, receives
a letter from Sir William J. Clarke :
2 7 Queen Street, Melbourne, 6th
September, 1888. Dear Sir, —Being
anxious to see an improvement in
the breed of horses, and feeling con-
vinced that it would pay farmers to
keep a few good mares (that might
be used for light work on the farm,
and feed the foals) better than any-
thing else, I am willing to give a
prize for the next four years of £2O
per annum to the Bacchus Marsh
Agricultural and Pastoral Society for
the best entire horse suitable to get
hunters, troop or carriage horses,
and hacks, to travel in any portion
of the Southern Province at a rea-
sonable fee to be fixed by the So-
ciety. Further, for the same period,
a prize of £5 per annum for the
best sow, with litter of pigs, the
boars to be sold to separate pur-
chasers at a fixed rate, or otherwise,
as may be decided by the Society.
Maddingley Park benefits. Aus-
tralian Club, 19th Sept. C. Crisp,
Esq., Dear Sir, —I saw in your paper
last week that the Committee of
the Maddingley Park were some-
what hampered in their good work
to improve it for want of funds. I
herewith beg to forward cheque for
£2O, which you will be pleased to
hand to them to be applied in a
manner they may deem best fitted
to accomplish their ends. Yours
faithfully, S. T. Staughton. Mad-
dingley Park, December 1, 1888. Mr.
Joseph Lodge, with a donation of
£6/10/, initiates “boat” fund.
The Rowsley valley, ending in
Yaloak Vale, is not the least pic-
tuesque feature of the district, and
the latter is deemed worthy of a
stanza. Oct. 13, 1888 :
“Crowned with hills but yet it needs
An artist’s hand ; for words would
fail
To give the mind a faithful sketch
Of Nature’s fairest Yaloak Vale.
Just Nature in a kindly mood
Did in thy favor turn the scale.
Reserved for thee her choicest gifts.
Thou lone and lovely Yaloak Vale.
Smile on, smile on in peacefulness,
Still sheltered from each gale.
Thou art a noble heritage,
Thou lovely Yaloak Vale !
Dec. 8, 1888 ; Mr. Donald Mac-
donald is early in the field as a new
candidate for West Bourke at next
general election. He resided for a
time at Keilor, where he honored
the “Express” by acting as a local
correspondent, and he has since been
engaged upon the “Argus,” to the
staff of which journal he is still at-
tached. He has acquired some re-
putation as a writer of sketches, a
volume of which has been published
under the title “Gum Boughs and
Wattde Blossom.” The “Express”
had one firm opinion, that Mr. Mac-
donald had no chance against Mr.
S. T. Staughton. I take notice of
the paragraph because that local
correspondent of the Boer War, and
“Express” has effloresced into one
of our most prominent journalists—
“ Observer” of the “Argus,” the war
correspondent of the Boer War, and
Nature Study writer and lecturer.
Evidently, in keeping to journalism,
Mr. Donald Macdonald chose the
better path. As a penman he has
widest versatility ; as a Parliamen-
tarian his oratorial attainments
would have placed him upon a lower
plane. We would not have had his
“Charge of the Devons” had that
ambition of 188 8 been realised. Be-
sides, he would have been displac-
ing a good man, and one has only
to look up the back files of the
“Express” to learn what a fine pub-
lic spirit—and undoubtedly of sin-
cerity—that characterised the career
of the late much lamented Mr. S.
T. Staughton, M.L.A. When Mr.
Trenwith, then leader of the Labor
Party—Mr. Staughton was a Con-
servative- —had danger of losing his
sight, and optical skill in the colony


was not advanced enough to meet
his case, the many friends of Mr.
Trenwith felt that he should submit
himself to the treatment of a Lon-
don specialist. The Labor leader
had no means, but a subscription
list was opened, and Mr. Staughton
was one of the prime movers, and
he headed the list with a donation
of £2 5. Mr Trenwith’s sight was
preserved.
At the annual dinner of the Mel-
bourne Caledonian Society, held
Friday evening, 30th Nov., 1888,
Mr. Symington, of Bacchus Marsh,
was present by invitation, and his
health was drunk as the grandson
of the inventor of the first steam-
boat. The second toast was pro-
posed by Professor Kernot, Professor
of Engineering at Melbourne Uni-
versity who was from his profes-
sional reading and training, aware
that Symington was the first to in-
vent a steam engine that would pro-
pel a vessel. Professor Kernot men-
tioned that a proposal had been
made to found a scholarship to per-
petuate the name of the original
William Symington, who he said,
like most men who were ahead of
their time, did not get appreciated.
The toast was responded to by Mr.
William Symington.
In 1888, Bacchus Marsh audiences
developed a habit of arriving half-
an-hour late. It became so pro-
nounced that in almost every re-
port is there mention made of the
fact. The Payne family of bellring-
ers were to give a show. There was
such a small audience at hour of
starting that the manager of the
entertainment resolved to give the
few in attendance their money back.
Half-an-hour later an animated
crowd, which would have yielded a
profitable return was wending its
way to the hall, only to find the
door shut. The reporter chastises
the local public for their chronic un
punctuality. The question is whether
Bacchus Marsh of 1917 in this re-
spect has reformed ?
Dec. 15, 1888. Mr. J. E. Crook
hitherto has been a pillar of Holy
Trinity Church. At a spiritual-
istic lecture, delivered by Mr. Craw-
ford Bradley, in the hall, Mr. Crook,
who was chairman, made a pro-
nouncement. He said that he had
become so convinced of the verities
of spiritualism that he would not
go back to his old belief for all
Melbourne, and all it contained.
Spiritualistic phenomena has had
many ups and downs since Mr. J.
E. Crook made that statement, and,
notwithstanding “all Melbourne or
what all Melbourne contains,” the
high water mark is not very en-
couraging. Somehow the old faiths
seem as immovable as the everlast-

Jan. 5, 1889. “Mr. T. W. Both-
royd, M.A., now head teacher of
Toolern State school, has been ap-
pointed an Inspector of Schools.”
1917 —Mr. Bothroyd is now one of
the executive officers of the Depart-
ment, being Assistant Chief Inspec-
tor.
Jan, 26, 1889 : “Mr. Molesworth
Greene, J.P., has purchased one of
the best pictures in Melbourne Ex-
hibition, for presentation to Mel-
bourne National Gallery. The sub-
ject is a sea coast storm, and is
wonderfully realistic.”
A cricketing item, Feb. 16, 1889,
worthy of record : An exciting cric-
ket match was played against Bal-
lan, at Maddingley Park. Ballan
(Captain Wootton) took first stand,
and owing to the fine bowling of H.
Barradell (seven wickets for nine
runs) and Allen (two wickets for 12
runs) the whole teams only put to-
gether 22, of which 12 were made
by McPherson. The Ballan second
innings was similar to the first, only
2 5 being made. Barradell again
takings five wickets for 14 runs, and
Allen four wickets for 11. The
Marsh (Captain Burnip) in their
first innings also made the small
score of 26. A. Barradell being top
scorer with 8. Wootton took six
wickets for 12 runs, and Walker
four for six runs. Although the
Marsh had only 2 2 to make to win
the match, at five o’clock nine of the
Marsh men were out for 20, leaving
2 to get to win the match. G. Val-
lence being the last man, and not a
very reliable scorer, took his stand
amidst silence and anxiety bn the
part of Bacchus Marsh, but he re-
ceived a leg ball from Walker, and
lifted it through the fence for 3,


securing the match for the home
team by one run and one wicket. A
few complimentary remarks con-
cluded a very agreeable game, al-
though the weather was unpleas-
antly hot.
Mr. Deakin, at conclusion of meet-
ing, March 9th, 1889, in which he
took farewell of Bacchus Marsh and
West Bourke generally, thus spoke:
“Ever since Mr. Kyle and Mr. An-'
derson invited me to come forward
for parliamentary life, I have re-
ceived the greatest kindness at the
hands of the Bacchus Marsh people
and district. I was a kind of polit-
ical child of the Bacchus Marsh
League of ten years ago. West
Bourke enabled me to enter the
Ministry, and I should ever remem-
ber that fact. I was also enter-
tained by my constituents here at a
banquet on my return from Eng-
land, and my relations with my con-
stituents have always been most cor-
dial, so that I have no reason for
wishing to sever my connectons, but
my colleague, Mr. S. T. Staughton,
has a claim upon the district which
I do not possess. I shall always be
happy to do the community any ser-
vice in my power. After all, they
were still inhabitants of the same
country, and that should have the
first claim upon their attention.”
April 13, 1889. “The two sons of
Rev. James Scott (referred to in fol-
lowing extract from the Tasmanian
“News”) were born in Bacchus
Marsh : —• “Many old friends and
school chums will welcome back to
Hobart the talented son of our re-
spected townsman, the Rev. James
Scott. Mr. Robert Gillespie Scott
has been a sojourner in “Auld
Reekie” for nearly five years, at
whose famed University he took his
medical degree. Dr. Scott had barely
reached Hobart when he was solic-
ited to go to Oatlands to attend
upon Dr. Butler’s patients, that
worthy medico having been attacked
by typhoid. Mr. M. B. Scott was
on Thursday admitted as a barrister,
solicitor, &c., of the Supreme Coun
of Tasmania by His Honor, Mr. Jus-
tice Adams. Mr. Scott served his
articles with Messrs. Clark and Sim-
mons, and is a son of the Rev. Jas.
Scott.”
During 18 89, a series of articles
(nine in all) contributed to the “Ex-
press,” entitled “Glimpses of Irri-
gation in Victoria,” must have at-
tracted much attention. “By T.G.P.”
is in the heading : without a doubt
Mr. T. G. Pearce. The contribu-
tions are lengthy, and contain much
valuable information. The late Mr.
Pearce was a successful business
man, but all this mass of irrigation
data, so ably presented, only proves
that the writer’s sphere of action
should have been that of the Legis-
lative arena.
June 29, 1889 : Mr. T. B. Hikely
obtained a donation from Mr. A.
Cornwell, of Brunswick, of a large
ornamental Roman vase for Mad-
dingley Park.
Sept. 28, 1889 : Bacchus Marsh
steadily going ahead. Slush light
gives way to sperm candles, sperm
candles to kerosene, kerosene to
gas, and gas must give way to elec-
tric light. Gas is installed in Bac-
chus Marsh, 23rd Sept., 1889, and
there is a public ceremony at the
opening.
Inauguration of Bacchus Marsh
Branch, No. 99, of the Australian
Natives’ Association, Oct. 4, 1889,
by Mr. J. L. Purves, Q.C., Presi-
dent of the Association. The fol-
lowing office-bearers were installed:
President, R. G. Fincham ; Vice-
Presidents, T. Boxshall and J. B.
Doherty ; Secretary, D. W. McGrath;
Assistant Sec., F. J. Carr; Treas-
urer, E. Simpson ; Committee, N.
Vance, G. Vallence, J. E. Sloss, J.
Bennett, J. Robinson, W. Grant, W.
G. Allen, J. Burnip, Ernest Simpson.
W. G. Morton, J. Mclvor, M. Comp-
ton, A. G. Osborne. Mr. Purves
spoke at great length in advocacy
of the Association, and in explain-
ing its operations and its aims.
May 31, 1890. A bazaar was
held in Mechanics’ Institute. I
don’t know that it requires special
mention, but a pronouncement was
made by the opener, Mrs. Albert
Miller, who was accompanied by Mr.
Miller. Arising out of the said pro-
nouncement was the editorial com-
ment. It was gratifying to know
that there was a likelihood of a
closer connection between Bacchus
Marsh, and the Messrs. Miller, as
both Mr. Albert Miller and Mr.
Septimus Miller contemplated build-


ing large residences in the district.
Local history attests that the con-
templation never crystallised into
fructification.
May 2 4th, 1890. Death of a Bac-
chus Marsh nonagenarian, one who
knew all its early history—Mrs. Lyle
senior, of Lyle’s Creek, who died at
the advanced age of 90 years and
four months. The old lady had had
good health up to within a couple
of years of her death, and had a
wonderful memory of bygone days.
Her late husband, Mr. John Lyle,
who had predeceased her by nine
years, was a miller, and had built
the Border Mill about the year 1850.
June 14, 1890. “Mr. Jeremiah
Ryan, of Clifton Hill, who owns a
lot of property in Bacchus Marsh,
has given £IOO to the Sisters of St.
Joseph, to assist them in paying for
the building purchased by them for
school purposes in Bacchus Marsh.”
Cr. James Watson, President of
Bacchus Marsh Shire, honors Mr.
Staughton, who had given the pub-
lic clock of Post-office tower, with a
luncheon. Present :—Hon. C. H.
James, Hon. J. S. Butters, H. Army-
tage, M.L.A., and others. Mr. Staugh-
ton made a promise, for he was not
satisfied with structure of tower,
that if it was raised he would add
two more dials, so that the clock
could be seen up and down the
street. The tower was not raised
until recently, hence the late Mr.
Staughton could not fulfil.the terms
of his contract. Mr. Staughton on
Cr. James Watson :—lf the Presi-
dent had not a flow of language he
had a flow of soul, which all ap-
preciated. He was honest as the
day, and straight as an arrow. It
was such men who made the colony;
and he was not the only one in
Bacchus Marsh, for there were lots
of them.”
Sept. 6th, 1890. Messrs. Derrick,
Beard, and Daniel, of the Pioneer
Concentrated Milk Factory, Romsey,
visited Bacchus Marsh on Thursday
afternoon and met a large number
of dairy farmers, the object being to
confer as to the desirability of es-
tablishing a factory in Bacchus
Marsh. Cr. Burnip, President of
the Shire, was voted to the chair.
He strongly advised the dairyfarm-
ers to support the Company. Mr.
Beard said he had persuaded his co-
directors to come to Bacchus Marsh
to see if a supply of milk could be
got in the winter when they most
required it. Mr. Derrick said he
had experience of the ordinary milk
walk trade in Melbourne, having
bought a business there for £1,2 5 0
which he was glad to sell for £2 50,
owing to the difficulty of getting
men to do the delivery. He could
now supply with one cart what used
to take ten carts, and he had no
Sunday work. They might rely upon
it that concentrated milk would sup-
ersede all other milk. It was not
a sweetened article such as conden-
sed milk was, which the doctors ob-
jected to, and it was better in every
way than the raw milk. His sales
had increased from 659 gallons per
month to 1,166 gallons. He had
given Bd. per gallon for milk this
winter, and it cost him 2d.
per gallon to collect it by
waggon. He could not afford to pay
more than 4d. to 6d. per gallon for
a large supply as it would be neces-
sary to make butter of such portion
of the milk as was not required for
the concentration process. He had
doubts about the lucerne milk being
suitable, and before he started a
factory in Bacchus Marsh he should
test 200 gallons of milk from lu-
cerne fed cows. Several speakers
assured Mr. Derrick that the lucerne
flavor could be kept out of the milk
by judicious feeding with wilted lu-
cerne. A number of those present
were reluctant to admit that 4d. to
6d. per gallon for milk would be
fair market value, but it was pointed
out that Melbourne milk buyers were
not now giving more than 6d., and
there was a decreasing demand. Mr.
Derrick said the Melbourne milk
supply was now drawn from a radius
of over 100 miles instead of about
30, as used to be the case. He found
that at Stratford the factories were
getting milk at 2|d. Mr. Daniel ex-
pressed his doubts whether the fac-
tory in Bacchus Marsh could com-
pete with Melbourne milk buyers.
Several dairy farmers present
thought it could, as many lived too
far from the railway to send milk
to Melbourne, and they could make
one trip a day to the factory but
not two per day to the railway ; be-


sides which they would not lose cans
nor make bad debts. Reference was
made to the desirability of placing
some of the shares among the Bac-
chus Marsh farmers. Mr. Beard
said there were 9,300 shares unal-
lotted, but the directors knew they
had a better investment in fhe
2 0,000 shares that had been issued
than ever Tramway shares were, and
they were not inclined to place any
shares on the market. Still, that
might be done. Mr. W. Robertson
undertook to supply 200 gallons of
milk from lucerne-fed cows as a
test. A vote of thanks to the visi-
tors elicited the reply that they
would further consider the question
of opening a factory in Bacchus
Marsh and make their decision
known through Mr. D. A. Little.
Melbourne Cup of 18 90.—The
great racehorse. Carbine, once used
to rest at Lerderderg Park—some
years ago he passed to his final rest
—and Nov. 8, 1890, I find a stirring
account of a performance, a deed
that won, not an Empire, but the
Melbourne Cup. The description of
the race is by the “Argus.” Car-
bine carried top weight into the
foremost position in a fast and true
run race, and when the heaviest
weight on record won in the short-
est time on record, even losers were
reconciled to the result in considera-
tion of the game qualities of the
equine hero of the day. I like the
final description—“ Where’s Carbine!
Where’s Carbine ! ” shouted a score
of eager backers. It was only
when the turn was reached that
everybody knew where Carbine was.
He shot through the field like a
thunderbolt, then he closed in on
the rails ; he placed himself as the
pilot fish before the shark clear
away from all his frantic pursuers.
Young Ramage lifts the favourite
along, and lands him an easy and
gallant winner with more than two
lengths of daylight betwixt him and
the next pursuer.” A thunderous
roar broke from the clouds of hu-
manity. Hats went flying in the
air as leaves rent by a September
gale. Men leapt and shouted, and
women screamed with delight; and
out from the Stewards’ stand came
Mr. Donald Wallace, his face like
the rising sun, barred with his sil-
very moustache. The win was re-
markable, for Carbine was neither
spur or whip-marked. Carbine stood
meek-eyed and slightly trembling.
If Carbine was regarded as a hero,
not less the owner, Donald Wallace.
Carbine’s weight was lOst. 5-lbs.,
that is, he carried one stone over
his weight for age. The horse’s
record was 11 races won in succes-
sion, and 2 9 wins out of 36. He
had beaten every racehorse of any
note on the Australian turf. The
fastest time of Cup previously was
Dunlop’s 3-min. 28J-secs., but Car-
bine clipped this by a quarter of a
second. It was only right that Car-
bine should be honored in a toast.
“The best horse in the world,” said
Mr. Croker, proposing the owner’s
health in the members’ room a little
later in the day, and the owner
modestly but confidently replied,
“It is a big word to say, but I be-
lieve he is the best horse in the
world ; and if anybody thinks there
is a better, well, we should like to
meet him.” Bacchus Marsh has had
wondrous history in that Carbine
rested here for years, prior to his
departure for England. _ Carbine’s
stall is still intact at the Lerderderg
Park. It is a humble brick struc-
ture. Mr. John Wills should never
demolish that classic shrine in the
racing world’s eyes. Great horses
have rested at the Lerderderg Park
since, perhaps have occupied Car-
bine’s box, but none so great as
Carbine. I have an idea that that
box of Carbine the departed is a
permanent asset from a mercantile
point of view. Mr. Wills is making
great improvements on his estate,
but Carbine’s box must remain un-
disturbed, ever to be visited by the
racing pilgrim. It was reported
that the Hon. D. S. Wallace, by
Carbine’s victory, had won £30,000,
beside the Melbourne Cup stake.
Dec. 27, 1890. The wife of Mr.
Jeremiah Ryan, now of Manor
House, died there on Friday night
somewhat unexpectedly, although de-
ceased had been an invalid for sev-
eral months. Mrs. Ryan was one
of the earliest settlers in Bacchus
Marsh, and was the mother of a
very large family. The funeral took
place on Sunday afternoon, when a
large attendance followed the re-


mains to the place of interment, the
old Roman Catholic cemetery, at
Hopetoun, at east end of Bacchus
Marsh, where the first Catholic
church in this district was erected.
The provisional directors of Bac-
chus Marsh Concentrated Milk Com-
pany—March 7, 1891—were Messrs.
W. Grant, T. Cain, R. Manning, P.
O’Hagan, W. H. McFarlane, W.
Lyle, David Robertson, J. D. Doherty,
E. Sloss, and J. Simpson, jun.
Mr. Joseph Shaw, March 14, 1891,
supplies information respecting local
native nomenclature : “Werribee”
meant back creek, and “Lerder-
derg” broken reeds. The native
name of the junction of the Werri-
bee and Lerderderg was “Barrow-
ong,” and meant magpie. “Gorro-
durkghap” signified blind woman.
The name of the Werribee, near Mt.
Blackwood, where it took its rise,
was “Kuringawing.” Mr. Shaw ad-
ded that he had obtained the infor
mation from two elderly women, who
formerly belonged to the Bacchus
Marsh district, one was a full black,
and the other a half-caste.
May 23, 1891. “An excellent site
has been given by Cr. W. Grant for
Bacchus Marsh Concentrated Milk
Factory. He gave the choice of
several allotments, on what is known
as the Millbank estate, to Mr. Kay,
engineer to the Company, and he
has selected an elevated allotment
fronting Ballarat road, as it gives a
good fall for drainage.”
Later —June 20, 1891 —The Bac-
chus Marsh Milk Concentrating Com-
pany has let a contract to Messrs.
Guthrie & McGuinness to erect a
building for a factory at a cost of
£270. It will be erected near Mad-
dingley Bridge, and the water sup-
ply required for cooling the con-
densers will be pumped from the
river and returned to it again.
There will be no loss of volume and
no contamination. The contract for
the machinery required has been let
to the Austral Otis Co., whose price
is about £I,OOO. This enterprise is
therefore one which represents a con-
siderable outlay of capital in a
branch of farming of considerable
value to every acre of land within
ten miles or more of the factory,
and it is to be hoped the directors
will be encouraged in every possible
way to make their venture an in-
creasing success.
The mustard seed planted in June,
1891, has indeed grown into a goodly
tree, for branches of the B. Marsh
C.M.C. are to be found in at least
three States.
A very active citizen was Mr.
Randall G. Fincham, manager of
the local branch of the National
Bank. He was one of the founders
of the A.N.A. in the Marsh; a mem-
ber of the Mechanics’ Institute, of
the Racing Club, and in short was
associated with various organisa-
tions. A presentation was made to
him—May 30, 1891 —on his promo-
tion to Horsham. Mr. Fincham has
risen to be head manager of the
National Bank of Australasia.
June 27, 1891. Mr. T. Cain, J.P.,
sells Lerderderg Estate to Hon. D.
S. Wallace, for something under
£20,000.
A neglected industry of Myrni-
ong in modern times. In 1891, a
Mr. W. H. Richards, a market gar-
dener on Pentland Hills, grew caul-
iflowers of wonderful sizes and qual-
ity, ranging up to 30-lbs. weight, in-
cluding leaves, and return was
1000 to the acre.
Land value in 1891. Mr. Patrick
McGrath buys four acres of Lang-
muir Estate, at £l2O an acre.
Dec. 19, 1891. Mr. John Simp-
son, one of the oldest residents in
Bacchus Marsh, and certainly the
oldest tradesman, died on Thursday
afternoon last, aged 71 years. For
some months past he had been al-
most bedridden and unable to speak,
but he Understood what was said to
him. He was a native of Kent, and
had been in the Colony for over 50
years. He left a widow, ten
sons, and two daughters. He was
always an industrious man, with
great courage in his early days as
a pioneer of new country. He was
the first to take a bullock team to
Blackwood, and opened up the road
across the Yarra still known as Simp-
son’s road, as he was the first to
venture to ford the river at that spot.
In his business as a butcher in Bac-
chus Marsh he gained the best of
reputations, and although not med-
dling with public affairs in any way
he did his share to support local
institutions, and has always been


highly respected. Mr. John Simp
son was born at Northfleet. (Kent,
England, and left England by the
Government ship “Brimmot” as
steward and butcher in the year
1837. Arrived in Tasmania, where
he was engaged by Mr. Learmonth
as coachman. He crossed over to
Victoria two years later, and was
employed on Mr. Glass’s station on
the Yarra, for two years. After-
wards on the Tarwan river for three
years, in connection with stock, and
also travelled with stock to different
parts of the country. He lived on
French Island for 12 months, and
was afterwards engaged hauling
timber from Bight’s mills on the
Yarra, and was the first man to drive
teams (in company with the late
William Field, father of the ex-
member for Collingwood) over wha*
is now known as Simpson’s road
(hence the name). Coming to Bac-
chus Marsh district in 1849, he
started the butchering business for
a short time, on a site now occupied
by Mr. Hugh Meikle jun’s. black-
smith’s forge. He then started cart-
ing goods to Ballarat, Castlemaine
and Sandhurst, for about three
years. He then established the pre-
sent butchering business in Main
street, Bacchus Marsh, now carried
on by his sons John and Edward.
Jan. 2, 1892. Mr. Gell, solicitor,
whose death was announced during
the week was a foremost man in
his day as Mayor of Hotham (now
South Melbourne) a Freemason of
the very highest craft rank, a prom-
inent churchman, and a leading so-
licitor. He resided in Bacchus
Marsh for a number of years, and
Gell street was named after him,
as he opened it on land belonging
to him,
Jan. 9, 1892. On her decease at
Harlesden, England, the wife of
Canon Cooper, known when in
charge of the local Anglican parish
as Rev. W. H. Cooper, a sketch of
her life is given. In 1865 she ac-
companied her husband to Aus-
tralia, and was the first lady that
had the courage to ascend the Aus-
tralian Alps, and take up her rest
dence in the mining township of
Woods Point. Then for two years
she was Mr. Cooper’s constant com-
panion in his long missionary jour-
neys over the whole of Victoria,
then the diocese of Melbourne; some-
times riding ; oftener driving
through the unfrequented parts of
the colony. For several years in
New Zealand Mrs. Cooper gave her
husband valuable assistance in his
Missions. Her last colonial exper-
iences, and very rough they were,
took place in 18 87-8, in British Co-
lumbia, from which colony she re-
turned to England in 1889, a con-
firmed invalid. Mrs. Cooper sailed
twice round the world and crossed
the Atlantic ten times.
I extract- —April 23, 18 92—from
a descriptive article —To Rockbank,
by Ramrod. It is throughout well
written. “Speaking of trees, re-
calls to mind that ‘Bruni,’ of the
‘Australasian,’ paying a visit to
Eynesbury, mentioned a clump of
Murray pines somewhere on the
Werribee. He said he had never
seen those trees, and if I err not,
thought it curious that they should
be so far south. As I like to afford
all possible information, I can lo-
cate the Murray pine at a point
farther south. About the year 1847,
my late father, in riding across from
Mr. James Robertson’s Aberfeldie
station, which probably took in the
present town of Keilor, saw a num-
ber of trees above referred to. I
distinctly remember that he desig-
nated them ‘Firs,’ such being the
usual style of North of England folk
in designating the Scotch pine; or
as it is botanically known Pinus
Sylvesties. In my Riverina exper-
ience I became well acquainted with
the Australian pine, and about 18
years ago, going on a shooting ex-
cursion to junction of Deep and
Jackson’s Creeks, not far from Aber-
feldie homestead, saw two or three
of those trees growing. Besides
establishing their identity I ob-
served several of the stumps. Later
on I heard that in the early days
of Melbourne, builders were in the
habit of cutting down those pines
for scaffold poles. If this statement
is true, at one time there must have
been some good sized clumps of
them on river banks.” I make the
extract, because on a nook on north
side of Bald Hill, Bacchus Marshy
there is quite a family of the
growth, and the conundrum is, how


did they propagate there ?
Methodists open out in Bacchus
Marsh, 10th Nov., 1890. The
church is 2 0 x 30. The Rev. G-.
Tregear is the herald, and Rev. O.
Dowsing the first resident minister.
“Express” Files, 18 92.
Mr. Thomas Cain —April 2, 1892
—purchased the whole of Mr.
Michael O’Connell’s property on
Lerderderg and Goodman’s creek,
amounting to 1,100 acres, at £6 per
acre.
The Eaglehawk correspondent of
the Bendigo “Advertiser” —April 30,
1892 —mentions death of Mr. Daniel
Hegarty, a younger brother of late
Mr. James Hegarty, of Bacchus
Marsh, progenitor of the Hegarty
families resident here. Mr. Daniel
Hegarty came to the colony in 1856,
and opened up the Johnson’s Reef;
after which he went to New Zea-
land, and on his return invested
largely in mining companies, be-
coming a Director of several. He
was also interested in mines at
ITushworth, and in Wheeler’s saw-
mills at Daylesford. He was a
member of the Eaglehawk Council,
and a prominent churchman. He
left a widow and eight children,
and was very much respected
throughout the Bendigo district.
Evidently an old inhabitant —Mr.
Peter McCluskey—possessed a strong
individuality. He was a Scotchman.
For half-a-dozen successive issues of
the “Express,” in 1892, does he dis-
course on his earlier travels to
America and other places. Mr.
McCluskey gets to Ireland. His
powers of description are excellent,
in an easy conversational style. He
went and inspected Muckross Ab-
bey again, and on a good large old
gravestone he states was inscribed —
“Glory to excelsis. Sacred to the
memory of Cornelius Mahoney,”
and many others of the same family.
He understood that this was the
grave of the forefathers of the
Mahoneys of Bacchus Marsh. I
have only one opinion, that Mr.
McCluskey is more than interesting
—that he is able. In a separate
communication Mr. McCluskey con-
tribute a historical Myrniong item ;
Sir, —I read in your last week’s
paper a report from your Ballan
correspondent, concerning Mr. L.
Dugdale’s property. It was at one
time called Blow’s flat. Mr. Blow
often visited me when I was lessee
of the property. I am desirous to
let the public know how he came
there. He was a young sailor, who
landed in Melbourne with 6d. in
his pocket—no more. He said it
was a very small capital to com-
mence with in a new country, so he
threw the 6d. in the Yarra for luck;
bundled his kit, and went on the
wallaby without a cent. He walked
oved Keilor plains, and through
where Bacchus Marsh is built now;
over the Pentland Hills. He came
to the property now Mr. Dugdale’s.
The scab had broken out in the
sheep, and Mr. McLauchlan and his
men were trying to cure it, but they
did not know how. The young
sailor wanted work, but they were
full handed. He said to the squat-
ter, Mr. McLauchlan, “I can cure
the scab.”. “What do you know
about the scab, a young sailor, just
left the sea?” “But I am a Welsh-
man, and my father kept a few
sheep in Wales ; before I went to
sea I assisted with the sheep, in
smearing and dressing them for
scab.” “Well, in that case, we will
give you a trial.” “If you give me
three sheep and I do not cure them
I will work three months for noth-
ing.” He got three of the worst
sheep with the scab, and dipped
them in a washing tub and they
were put in the garden to be kept
separate. The sheep were cured.
He was then given 12 sheep and
he cured them also. A short time
after he was appointed overseer;
and in course of time became a
partner in the station, but was
never owner. He had an interest in
a station above Ballarat for a time,
and afterwards purchased one. He
simply boiled tobacco and dipped
the sheep in the juice, and thus
cured all the sheep on the run. An-
other neighboring squatter made
his first start through the same
thing, and died worth £16,000. His
name was John Edols. He leased
the sheep and run from the late Mr.
P. Inglis just after the scab broke
out, and had a difficult matter to
cure them, but he succeeded, and
made a handsome fortune.


Death of Mr. J. H. Bowser —Sept.
24, 1892.
Mr. J. H. Bowser, a resident for
many years in Bacchus Marsh died
on Monday last, somewhat sud-
denly, from liver complaint. The
deceased was a sergeant-Major of
Lancers in his early days, in the
Imperial service. He was born in
Durham, England, in 1822, and left
the office of his uncle —where he was
employed as a clerk, in 1836 to enlist
in the third Dragoons regiment.
Prom this he was transferred to the
16 th Lancers, when they were or-
dered to active service in India, and
he took part with that regiment in
the principal battles of the Sikh war.
Altogether he served 15 years
in India, fought in nine engage-
ments, and was wounded several
times, once severely, whilst defend-
ing with conspicuous bravery the
ammunition of the force, which was
imperilled. He returned with his
regiment to England, and having
obtained his discharge and a pen-
sion, married and came out to Vic
toria in the sailing ship Clarissa
Bird, in 1857. On presentation of
his papers he was engaged by the
Colonel-Commandant of the forces
as drill instructor of the Victorian
Volunteer Light Horse, and for ten
years travelled to and fro between
the Geelong, Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh
and Kyneton troops, giving instruc-
tion in riding school, and sword and
lance exercise, and he organised a
series of military tournaments 1 in
Geelong, Kyneton and elsewhere,
which aroused much interest at the
time. He was on one occasion pre-
sented by the Bacchus Marsh Troop
with a gold watch and chain, which
he retained with much pride to the
last. He subsequently settled in the
Marsh (which he never afterwards
cared to leave) and was for some
years employed as overseer of Mr.
Whittingham’s stud farm at the
Woolpack. He was out and about
the farm on Monday morning, but
was suffering from the effects of a
recent severe attack of liver com-
plaint, and complained of being-
drowsy. He was assisted to bed by
Dr. Vance (who had been in attend
ance previously) and Mr. William
McDonald, and died painlessly in
the presence of Mrs. Bowser and
others of the family on the same
evening. The deceased was a char-
acteristic Englishman, outspoken, yet
unobstrusive, and although a strict
disciplinarian all his life he was
highly respected by all who knew
him. His skill in veterinary work,
and generally in the management of
horses was remarkable. Deceased
leaves a widow, five sons, and three
daughters (two married). The eld-
est son is editor and joint proprie-
tor of the Wangaratta “Chronicle,”
and the other sons are employed in
the Railway Department.
“Eucalyptus,” an early inhabitant,
thus describes Bacchus Marsh, the
ancient township—Nov. 18, 189 3 :
I am more than pleased to find my-
self in the ancient township of Bac-
chus Marsh this morning. Turning
to the westward, the old Ballarat
road of ’sl rises from the undulating-
valley, and looking backward I sur-
vey the peaceful English-like mead-
ows, and the hills beyond them, and
think of the pioneers who first
turned the virgin soil ; or still fur-
ther back to that little band with
its flocks journeying on the table-
land, rejoicing over this valley. The
natural features have changed, and
no more do the rivers spread out
like the veins of the vine leaf over
the valley. The box trees that
sheltered the first white men as they
watched o’er their flocks have van-
ished out of existence, and will no
more with their star-like blossoms
in the early Spring light up the
Maddingley flat. The wattles have
also disappeared from the hill sides.
Jimmy, the old herdsman, whose
home was amongst them, was the
first white man to cross the plains
with stock, which landed with John
Pascoe Pawkner over 57 years ago.
One might wander about here for
months and not hear that dreamy
tinkling sound which was so fam-
iliar in the olden times from the
wandering cattle that roamed over
the distant hills and the unfenced
tracks. Since the bullock-bell days
Shire Councils have come into ex-
istence, and their peculiar functions
are to make the roads, and regulate
the traffic to suit the public; might
I suggest that a bylaw be passed
compelling the owners of wandering
cattle to place on their stock


those bells that were once so often
heard. If this were done the air
would be alive with sounds, such
as would arouse the sleeper even
more than in the early days, and
mark the coming of the intruder in
the darkness, and their approach to
devour the treasures of the garden,
or the foliage that surrounds it.
It is useless for me to wander about
in search of the old huts of ’37.
Clark’s flocks have long since ceased
to exist; the old bark and slab huts
which aboriginal tribes (although
they were few in number) used to
gather round in the twilight and
indulge in their native games, have
decayed away; the kangaroos have
been killed or driven back into the
forest. There are only a few about
the Marsh now that will remember
Bobby Bruce. He was one of those
busy men who travelled about a lot
in his time, and took notice of
everything that came in his way.
For many years he was well known
in Sydney as a successful speculator,
but after a time he grew tired of
his occupation, so he decided to re-
tire and join Sir Thos. Mitchell,
with whom he entered Victoria from
New South Wales. After travelling
through many parts of Victoria he
returned to Melbourne, which was
at that time at its wildest. While
there he met Captain Bacchus, and
to him he spoke highly of the basin
over the plains. At this time John
Pascoe Fawkner and his followers
were about Melbourne. To them
also he sounded the praise of this
district. The present Manor House,
that stands on elevated ground mid-
way between the Lerderderg and
Werribee, with its frontage to the
south, was the property of that old
pioneer from whom the Marsh has
taken its name. This building, with
its well-stocked garden and orchard,
its yard and out-houses (old, yet
sound and complete), speaks well
for the work of men of old. The
view from this building is a good
one, across the valley to Parwan,
divided from the Marsh by the Wer-
ribee river. As the morning is fast
advancing I must hurry away along
the old road, for the journey I have
before me is a long one. It is 41
years ago since Bullock Bill was
stuck in the mud for three days op-
posite the Border mill. There were
no smooth paths or well metalled
road in those days. Mr. Hodgson’s
old baker’s shop and dwelling house
that stood by the foot of the hill
has disappeared, and on its site a
barber’s pole has sprung up. In
the year 1850 we had an industrious
population which only numbered
76,000, who cultivated the soil with
good profit, no less than 52,000 acres
being under cultivation ; but in
1853, when the diggers flocked up
this road to the Ballarat gold fields,
the cultivation of the soil decreased
to 35,000 acres, with an increase of
population amounting to 222,000.
The Border Inn in those days was
as well known as it is to-day. Mr.
Watt, its then landlord, has long
since passed away. He took a great
interest in the welfare of the dis-
trict, and introduced many things
for its benefit. He succeeded in
getting the Maddingley road, now
the principal road to the railway
station. Mr. Watt had long been
advocating a direct road through
the Marsh from Geelong to Bendigo.
At that time the traffic went by
Melton. Public meetings were
called, and a road laid off to a suit-
able site for a bridge over the Wer-
ribee. There were several routes,
but none were equal to the present
Maddingley road, which was then
the boundary between the Millbank
and Pilmer estates. The former was
the property of the late Mr. W.
Grant, while the latter was owned
by the late Mr. Pilmer. Both these
gentlemen gave the road. At this
time the Werribee overflowed into
a blind gully on the west side of
the road, and crossed over towards
the main street. This was rather a
drawback, but like many other
things it was soon got over. For a
time the road was without a bridge,
and it was not until a digger who
was making his way with £2 2 0 in
gold in his purse from Bendigo
goldfields to Geelong on the old road
was robbed of all his money that
Mr, Watt undertook the building of
the first Maddingley bridge over the
Werribee at his own expense. He
selected eight strong stringy-bark
spars in the Mount Blackwood for-
est, at that time worthy of its name
for its timber. The spars were set


in the ground, four on each side,
met in the centre and crossed over,
leaving sufficient length on the top
for a ridge pole. The whole ap-
peared to be like the roof of a house.
Little by little the elevated plat-
form disappeared till at last nothing
was left but the skeleton spars,
which fell into the river, and so a
bridge that no one ever crossed but
the men who designed it dis-
appeared. A well designed bridge
now spans the river over the same
place, and the road has been much
improved ; elm trees line both sides,
and will spread into an avenue.
Buildings have sprung up, but the
old blacksmith’s shop is gone, and
so is he who once made the anvil
sound when all was still but the
bullock bells. Hr. Quaile, who, like
Mr. Watt, was a good settler.
I am hastening on ; and, as with
the Great War, the end is in view.
I move faster, for although the “Ex-
press” flies are, full of information,
it is less striking than that which
was of npore ancient dress ; and the
history, although the effort is purely
voluntary, must come to some sort
of conclusion.
I note —Jan. 6, 18 5* —that the
Rev. W. H. Shields, to assist the
funds of Holy Trinity Church, pro-
moted a “Christmas Pie” entertain-
ment. I have heard of a “Bun
Struggle” to increase Church funds,
but not "Christmas pie” entertain-
ments. It was a very profitable
undertaking, for there was a net
return of £l2/7/; the expenses for
the materials of the pies, &c., only
reaching £4/7/.
Bacchus Marsh property history
and value. May 19th , 1894.—The
sale of the Clark farm, near the old
Woolpack Inn, Bacchus Marsh, took
place on Wednesday. There was a
large attendance, but bidders were
not numerous. It was announced
that the executor reserved the right
to make the last bid. The bidding
started at £ls an acre all round,
there being 60 acres of flat land
valued at various times in recent
years from £4O to £IOO per acre;
and 5 4 acres of red soil valued at
from £3 upwards. Mr. Albert Mil-
ler bid once, and Mr. Stephen Shea
bid £2O, but Mr. Edward Sloss gave
the final bid of £2 0/10/, at which
it fell to him a cheap property, as it
was popularly thought that some-
thing nearer £25 per acre would
have been obtained. We believe it is
Mr. Sloss’s intention to work the
land himself with the aid of his sons,
for dairying purposes, and that
most of the flat land will be laid
down in lucerne. Mr. Sloss is now
a large landed proprietor, haying a
farm at Lucknow, near Ingliston;
another near Ballan. at the upper
end of the Yaloak Vale property;
and he owns several township pro-
perties in Maddingley and Bacchus
Marsh.
The old pioneers are passing away
one by one. Death of Mr. Jeremiah
Ryan, August 4th, 1894 :Mr. Jere-
miah Ryan died at the Manor
House, Bacchus Marsh, on Thursday
evening, having kept to his house
for several months past, chiefly
suffering from gout, we understand.
Deceased came to Bacchus Marsh in
1854, and married Mrs. McNamara,
a widow who owned a valuable
farm, now a part of Messrs. Miller's
property, which he managed with
ability for several years. He took
a prominent part in local affairs,
and was an able, enterprising man.
About ten years ago he speculated
in property at Clifton Hill, with
considerable success. At the time
of his death he owned the Commer-
cial hotel and several shops and
dwellings in Bacchus Marsh town-
ship, also a piece of land on the
Lerderderg. Mr. Ryan left a will,
date Bth Feb., 1893. The real es-
tate is valued at £21,122, and the
personal at £9BO. He gives the
whole of his estate to his son Tim-
othy Bernard Ryan, bachelor of
medicine, now practising his pro-
fession in Michael street, North
Fitzroy.
I am just afraid that that
picturesque Bullengarook corres-
pondent of the “Express” was a
wine bibber. A note from him on
Jan. 19, 1895: “I am glad to say
that our worthy host of the Harp
of Erin has been induced by his
many friends to take out the license
again, so if we are spared we are
sure of our nip for the next twelve
months.
Then hurrah, and hurrah and hur-
rah


My jolly men.
For we are sure of our own bar
For twelve months again.
But I will not forget to visit my old
friend, Mr. Bennett, again.
March, 9, 1895: The sale of the
Lerderderg Park brood mares and
Carbine young stock took place on
Friday, Ist inst., when there was a
good attendance. The sale occupied
a very short time, as auctioneers of
pure stock pride themselves upon
disposing of the lots quickly. About
£II,OOO was realized, the highest
price paid being 650 guineas for a
mare served by Carbine and with a
foal by him. This price shows that
Carbine was well sold at £13,000.
A compliment was paid to Mr. D.
A. Wallace by Mr. A. S. Chirnside
buying in for Mr. Wallace’s son a
mare with Carbine foal, which he
got at his upset price of 200gns.
Carbine the Great is purchased
by the Duke of Portland. April 20,
189 5: Carbine left Bacchus Marsh
on the morning of Good Friday, per
the 10.30 mixed train. This ar-
rangement was wisely made, as it
prevented any risk of hurry on the
day the steamer left, which was
Saturday last. The public, more-
over, were eluded. As it was, some
300 people assembled on the pier,
where Carbine and his son arrived
about 1 o’clock, having been taken
there in the horse box which carried
them from Bacchus Marsh. Carbine
walked up the gangway very quietly
but the colt was not so tractable,
and gave some trouble. Both horses
have been provided with specially
prepared boxes on the main deck,
and will be in charge of J. Cunning-
ham, who had the care of Carbine
at Bacchus Marsh. He is to receive
£3 per week for the engagement,
and his passage paid back to Mel-
bourne should he not remain in
England. Mr. E. A. Day, who came
out from England to take posses-
sion of Carbine for the Duke of
Portland, accompanied the horse
home. On Saturday morning the
mail steamer was crowded with
visitors to see Carbine, and his box
was gaily decorated with flowers.
An insurance premium of about
£2,000 has been paid on Carbine.
This sum, added to the 13,000gns.
purchase money, and other expenses
will nijake the total cost of Carbine
approach £20,000.
March 23, 1895: Mr. Lawrence
Dugdale, jun., M.A., LL.B., has been
awarded first-class honors in the
final examination in laws, which
will entitle him to the degree of
LL.M. at the end of 12 months,
without further examination. Mr.
Dugdale’s University career has
been a rapid and distinguished one.
The Year 1896—Conclusion.
The history of the early career of
a community is the history of its
pioneers. Hence I reproduce what
I find in the files in regard to their
personality and activities. The
Myrniong correspondent writes, May
11, 1895 : Much regret has been ex-
pressed at the intelligence of the
death of Mr. Isaac Evans. The de-
ceased was one of the very earliest
settlers on the Pentland Hills, and
a very old colonist, arriving in Mel-
bourne so far back as 1849. Shortly
after his arrival he entered the ser-
vice of the late Mr. H. James, of
Broadlands, Bacchus Marsh, remain-
ing in his employ for about two
years. He then tried his fortune at
the goldfields, with fair success. Re-
turning to Bacchus Marsh he rented
a farm from Mr. James, upon which
he resided for a few years, after
which at the first sale of Crown
lands on the Pentland Hills, he pur-
chased 145 acres. On this land he
resided for a number of years, en-
gaged in cultivation and dairying
pursuits, eventually purchasing an
adjoining allotment, where he with
his family removed to a commodious
freestone dwelling, erected thereon.
He now turned his attention to
sheep farming, becoming well-known
as a successful breeder of long-
woolled sheep, taking many prizes
at the Melbourne, Ballarat, Smeaton,
and local shows. He was also a
successful breeder and exhibitor of
draught horse stock. At the sale of
the McLachlan estate some years
ago he purchased an allotment ad-
joining his home, thus forming a
very nice property, the whole of
which he (finding his health failing)
let on lease about three years ago,
and retired from the laborious pur-
suit of a farmer’s life to enjoy the


fruits of his labor in the pleasant
suburb of Malvern. Mr. Evans leaves
behind him a widow, two sons, and
five daughters. His family are all
married except his youngest daugh-
ter. Mr. Evans was a generous
donor to the funds of the Trustees
of Maddingley Park.
May 18th, 1895. Five columns
devoted to farewell and presentation
gathering in connection with de-
parture of the Rev. Patrick O’Reilly
from Bacchus Marsh. The Mechan-
ics’ Hall was filled by a number of
co-religionists of the rev. gentleman,
and other friends, who were not of
the same faith. Messrs. Patrick
O’Hagan and Patrick McGrath were
the heroes of the occasion. The Rev.
Montague Williams (Anglican) con-
gratulated Father O’Reilly upon his
eloquent speech, and the reception
he had met with. The Rev.
Trebilcock (Methodist) was also
present. The Father’s speech was
very eloquent, and breathed the
broadest sentiment. He quoted—
Shall I ask the brave soldier, who
fights by my side,
If our creeds agree ?
Shall I give up the friend I have
valued and tried,
If he kneel not before the same
altar as me ?
I make this extract from the speech:
—“The old people would remember
many he would refer to, but the
young and the strangers, who wished
to know all about the earlier coach-
ing days, of the glories of the Wool-
pack, the excitement of the Balla-
rat riots, must repair to Mr. Tom
Bowe’s fireside—the grand old man
of Bacchus Marsh, from whom many
of his pleasanter experiences of Bac-
chus Marsh had been derived. They
learn about the old families. The
old flame flickers as it nears the
century, and you will hear there of
the honoured dead —the Leahy’s,
Egan’s, Young’s, Ryan’s, Vallence’s,
Anderson’s, Shea’s, Cain’s, Crook’s
Simpson’s, McFarlane’s, O’Connell’s,
Grant’s, Pearce’s, Connell’s, James’,
McLeod’s, and many others. Fool-
ish after a fashion many of them
may have been, leaving the earth
little tangible legacy of their lives,
but they created a good spirit in
this lovely valley, and he could give j
them no better advice than to cher-
ish the memory of these pioneers.”
Father O’Reilly closed with what
he termed ‘‘a rude rhyme”:
Friend of years, remember when I’m
gone,
In days of joy, or nights of dark-
est grief,
This heart goes with you, one by
one,
From Digger’s Rest to Barry’s
Reef.
I enter upon 1896, and do not
propose to carry the history any
further. The ancient regime has
been reviewed : Written within 20
years of present date may well be
regarded as modern times, and his-
tory is a record of the past, not of
the present.
The history is now concluded, and
in all senses has it been a labor of
interest, if not love. For over 12
months have I lived in the past of
that ancient hamlet Bacchus Marsh.
Mr. William Morris Hughes, ad-
dressing his old school, told the
boys to get along with as few lies
as possible. Bacchus Marsh may
have had one or two cancer spots,
which I have strictly refrained from
noticing ; but, take the public life
altogether, a high level was reached
and maintained.
Before these lines shall have been
translated into type the scribe will
be in another arena. The teaching
profession of the State carries that
penalty—the ‘‘move on” clause ever
operates. But this lengthened chron-
icling has caused me somehow to
feel identified with the place. It
is safe to say that very few locali-
ties have such plethora of historical
incidents as Bacchus Marsh. Some
day it may reach twice or thrice
its present population. Verily, un-
der water, is the Marsh fiat the land
of milk and honey, and it almost
seems a sacrilege that it should be
put to purpose other than that of
intense cultivation. Even to this
day there is paddock upon paddock,
allotment upon allotment, lying in-
ert. Bacchus Marsh was intended
to be an oasis of extraordinary fer-
tility. The community must do its
part, and all will participate in the
abundant return. And on the staple
industry will rest other industries,


and this will mean -accession of
wealth and population.
My sojourn in the Marsh was of
some seven years duration, and I
would not have left the town only
that there was the call of promo-
tion. I am glad that I had that
sojourn.
I have already stated that pos-
sibly some day it may occur to some
to gather this resume of the birth
and growth of Bacchus Marsh into
book form. I had the inclination to
write that history : I obeyed the in-
clination : it meant hours and hours
of personal interview and perusing
of the records of the past. Person-
ally I have a satisfaction, not self
congratulation, that I have done so.
I trust that modern Bacchus Marsh
will have the same feeling.
(Concluded).
W. WILLIAMS, B.A.




RECOLLECTIONS
At different times I have seen in
“The Express” reminiscences from
former residents, the last being by
an “Old Resident,” who had visited
the Royal Show, as it was too wet
to-day to cut ferns-—there is no
boxthorn here —I do not know which
is the greater pest, but from what
I saw of the country from the Wirn-
rnera to the coast of South Austra-
lia, I would prefer either to the
stinkwort, as that weed appears to
be in possession of the greater
portion of that territory—l will
endeavor to give some impressions
formed on a run through my native
district towards the end of last year,
and recollections retained from the
late 6 o’s of the last century.
Travelling over the Keilor Plains,
one misses that quaint old figure,
Sam Crisp, driving his pair-horse
coach, morning and evening and
the four-in-hand midday coach.
This had different drivers, a few
that I remember were : Frank
Hanna, Joe Ward (who was killed
by his coach overturning near the
bottom of Anthony’s Cutting), J.
Steel, and Johnny Lovelock, who
was an expert on the box, and used
to make the pace a “cracker” at
times. Another familiar figure off
the track is Tom Anderson, with his
pair-horse merchant waggon. He
was so punctual to time, down on
the Tuesday and back on the Thurs-
day, that it was said that the way-
side dwellers regulated their time-
pieces by his passing. There were
not any telephone or wireless in
those days. t
The first glimpse of Bacchus
Marsh Shire that presents itself as
one approaches the Deep Creek
Cutting, is Kyle’s farm, at that time
worked by the brothers, Mark and
Sandy, but, after a time, the latter
said lie was tied of hoeing man-
golds while the former talked poli-
tics, so he struck out “on his own"
and rented Billy Robinson’s farm on
the Coimadai Plains, and went in,
principally, for dairying. However,
during his tenancy, he experienced
one of those oft-recurring dry
periods, which prevented the ven-
ture being much of a success, and,
at the end of his lease, held a clear-
ing sale, conducted by Stratford
Strettle, who was the leading dairy
cattle salesman of that period. The
sale was termed a successful one,
though the values realized will ap-
pear very low to the cow owners of
this generation. The herd of good
dairy cows averaged about £4 per
head. Shortly afterwards, Sandy
started a milk round south of the
Yarra, and by supplying the genuine
article, and straight dealing, worked
up a very remunerative business.
He afterwards enlarged on the re-
tail trade by taking a farm on the
Yarra, near Heidelberg, and pro-
duced his own milk. He also es-
tablished a small stud of trotters on
this farm ; but his experience of the
game was that he had better stick
to the line that he understood.
Some time afterwards he went on to
the land in the Goulburn Valley,
where the grave closed in on the
remains of an industrious and
honest man.
On descending to the valley of the
Deep Creek, I noted that the house
of Jim McCullagh had disappeared,
also Dick Griffith’s dwelling in the
gully. The present occupant of this
farm has arranged to let the cows
carry the milk up the hill, as he
has built his residence on the table-
land. Old Jack Ryan’s 10-acre
block on the corner appears to be
merged into Griffith’s farm.
South from the Main road to the
Werribee river were farms owned
by Mick Griffin, Teddy and Martin
Shea. Teddy’s son, Tim, was the


champion high jumper of his time,
winning the most of those events at
the different sports meetings, and
his cousin, Ned, held about the same
fame as a broad jumper. Grant, the
miller, also had a river frontage
property at the end of this road, but
it was acquired by Mick Griffin and
Teddy Shea. Torn Derham, of Bray-
brook, had a grazing paddock on
the west of this road, but I suppose
it has changed hands before this.
On reaching the top of the Cut-
ting, I find that what was once the
Travellers’ Rest, kept by E. Finnin,
is still there, but minus the publi-
can’s licence, and appears now to be
the homestead of a dairyfarm. On
descending the hill, a most pleasing
vista presents itself, as the fertile
valley, intersected by the Werribee
and Lerderderg rivers, and the
smaller streams, meets the eye. I
am afraid this is not duly appreci-
ated by those who gaze on it often.
I do not know any other in the
State to equal this view.
When the flat is reached the first
farm on the north side is H. W.
Swords’ “Fertile Vale.” In my
time, it was occupied by a family
named Shea ; there were several sis-
ters and one brother, who was a bit
of a sport. He had a very nice
dapple-grey mare named Maids-
worth, which, when running well in
a hurdle race on the Marsh, course,
overleaped herself at a hurdle at the
north-east corner of the course and
fell, stretched out, and never rose
again—this bit of ill-luck was the
end of Steve’s turf career.
An allotment on the creek behind
“Fertile Vale” was occupied by an
old man known as “Parson Jack,”
who used to ride up every Sunday
morning on his old bay cob, togged-
out in a black suit and a half-grown
belltopper in time to ring the bell
at the Presbyterian Church, but I
suppose he has gone over the border
long before this, as he was an old
man then.
On the south side of the road was
John O’Shea’s Tipperary Flat, famed
for the potatoes that it produced :
but I notice that the present occu-
pier had supplanted the tubers with
lucerne.
West of these farms was situated
W. Grant’s Hopetoun Estate. It was
then rented by Win. Morley, a large
city cartage contractor, who used it
as a spelling place for his work
horses. He also established a small
but select Clydesdale stud, under the
management of James Hegarty. At
the head of the stud was the im-
ported Clydesdale sire, “Muir Lad,”
which I always look back on as be-
ing about the best heavy stallion
that I have seen, as he had size,
plenty of bone and hair, and splen-
did action. I am borne out in that
opinion by the fact that, at the dis-
posal of the stud, he was secured
by Andrew Town, of the Hobartville
Stud, on the Richmond river, and
was awarded first and champion
prizes at the Sydney Show five times
consecutively, being 11-years-old on
the last occasion, which, I think, is
a record.
In 1877, the owner decided to
work this farm himself, and went
in for milk production, and erected
what was, at that time, the most
up-to-date milking shed and ap-
pointments in the Shire, and sup-
plied milk to the first cheese factory
in Victoria. It was started in the
flour mill, adjoining Grant’s pro-
perty, by Gilman Goodrich Pierce,
the grandfather of the present Chief
Commissioner of the Victorian Rail-
ways, who had, as manager, Baron
Jones, with Jack Mahon as as-
sistant. After a little time, like
most men not brought up to the
business, Grant found that working
the land was not all that it ap-
peared to be and, tiring of the work,
ultimately sold the property to the
Miller family. This action caused
such a shrinkage in milk supply to
the factory that the proprietor
sought a more central position, up
in the town, and built a wooden
factory in the corner of Sam Crisp's
paddock ; and, after operating same
for some time sold out to D. Tel-
ford and Jack Mahon. Some little
time later, the building was de-
stroyed by fire, and never rebuilt.
When the Queensland Govern-
ment first sought to encourage
dairying in their State, it was
chiefly on the recommendation of
his first employer that Jack Mahon
received the appointment of Dairy
Expert in the Northern State, and
the Bacchus Marsh young man jus-


tified the choice and made good.
With a couple of assistants and a
dairy plant he travelled nearly the
whole of the accessible parts of that
immense State, demonstrating the
up-to-date methods of butter and
cheese-making, and the business
took on rapidly and has grown to
very extensive dimensions. The
Queensland Government showed its
appreciation of his successful efforts
by appointing him Principal of the
Queensland Agricultural College, in
succession to Professor Shelton, who
was the first Principal. The Marsh
boy made good in this position also,
as he held it with satisfaction to
those concerned until his untimely
death.
I have strayed away a bit from
Hopetoun, so must get back to that
point. In my time, there was quite
a little hamlet there, but it has al-
most disappeared. Daddy Byrnes,
who must have been about the old-
est man in the district at that time,
lived with his son, Mat, and a
daughter, in a little cottage just
East of the cemetery. Mrs. J.
O’Shea and Mrs. M. Griffin were his
daughters also. There is a milking
yard there now. W. H. Athorn’s
Hopetoun hotel is still there, but
Ims shed its licence. Charlie Dens-
ley’s old home is wiped right out,
and not much remains of Jack
Daley’s former abode. The one-
time prominent flour mill is now in
ruins. The old brewery buildings
are still to be seen, and, I under-
stand that W. Symington is still
hale. He must be as near 90 as 80
years. That end of the Shire can
also claim another venerable resi-
dent, as Mark Kyle cannot be much
liis junior, and still plays his part
in affairs in the interests of his
town and district.
On the South of Hopetoun, John
Connell was nestled at the foot of
the hill, on his Glenconnell Estate,
containing some very rich flats, in-
tersected by the Pyrette Creek and
a branch of the old Lerderderg
stream, with some grazing uplands
on the western' side. Before the
erosion of the banks, and the deep-
ening of the creeks, this little pro-
perty used to carry and fatten an
enormous number of stock for its
area. For many years John used to
ride to Newmarket nearly every
Tuesday, to attend the stock sales,
but later he invested in a piano-box
buggy, as he remarked it was more
comfortable than the saddle to carry
16-stone of humanity.
At that time the Newmarket sale-
yards were not so extensive as they
are at present, and the cattle, sheep
and pigs were all sold there on the
Tuesday in each week. The number
of auctioneering firms was then also
limited, compared to the list at pre-
sent operating there. The principal
firms were Peck, Hudson & Raynor
(who later on dissolved and the
three principals started separately :
J. B. Peck & Sons, Win. Hudson &
Co., T. Raynor & Co. The first-
named firm is now amalgamated
with the Australian Mercantile,
Land & Finance Co., and the latter
two have gone off the map.) Richard
Gibson & Co., now B. Trenchard &
Co.; Powers, Rutherford & Co.,
still do business under the old
name but the personnel is much
changed ; John George Dougharty,
Son & Parker, and later, Theo. Par-
ker & Co., but is now off the list.
Regan & Hammond is another firm
that has disappeared. Hastings,
Cunningham & Co. became King &
Cunningham, the next change of
name being King, Ross & Smith,
three different firms : Arthur S.
(King & Sons, now King, Sons & Bal-
lantine, Francis Ross & Co., and
Pearson, Rowe, Smith & Co., are
still trading under same names. In
those days the dairy cattle were sold
in Bourke Street. The yards of
Stratford, Strettle & Co., occupied
the spot where the Metropole Hotel
now stands, and Dan Lovelock &
Co. sold on the north side of the
street, in the Victoria Bazaar.
John Connell’s third son, Johnnie,
was a good horseman and sport, and
owned some of the best ponies of
his time. A few of them that I re-
member were “Stockings,” a 13.2
hands pony that negotiated the
Flemington Steeplechase Course as a
trial, without a mishap, when it was
much more difficult than at present ;
“Cock Robin,” a winner of many a
pony race ; “Nellie Grey,” with an
equally good record, and “Norman,”
a pony that he took to W. S. Cox’s
Kensington Park Racecourse, where


she won her race almost distancing
her field, and Johnnie exchanged her
for a good cheque. I do not suppose
that there are many of your present
residents who remember those little
items, but may do so when their
memories are jogged. Among city
men, Harry Madden and Dick
McKenna, who were interested in
ponies at the time, will. Johnnie
also had a few racehorses, the best
of them that I remember was “Duc-
hess,” who won for him her first
race on the Marsh course, the Sap-
ling Stakes, for two-year-olds, the
other places being filled by W. Tur-
ner’s “Alice,” and Bob Crook’s
“Stella.” The two former were by
Dick Bence’s “Chieftain,” and the
third by Dr. Bathe’s “Stockham”
(imp.) “Duchess” was later bought
by Bob Howie, a leading Ballarat
horse trainer of the period, for
whom she won a hurdle race on the
Bacchus Marsh course.
On the Western boundary of Glen-
connell is the Broadlands Estate,
then owned by Henry James, on
which was the most luxuriant
growth of ryegrass and clovers that
the writer has ever seen in the Com-
monwealth, That was when the
water was only a few feet deep from
surface, and the bed of the Lerder-
derg was only about six feet from
the flat level. You could ride a
horse across any part of it, and take
a vehicle over many places. But the
last time that I saw it one would
require an aeroplane to get over the
perpendicular banks ! The water-
carrying capacity of the river was so
small that every time there was a
good fail of rain over the watershed
the flood waters used to spread over
the roads, and to prevent or miti-
gate this, the Shire Council, in their
wisdom or otherwise, deepened and
straightened the course of the river,
with the result now known to all
landowners with property fronting
the river. I feel sure that the pro-
ductivity of Broadlands was reduced
5 0 per cent. It is only the old resi-
dents who can remember what the
property was before the straight-cut
was made. It only required a few
sand bags to be put into the river,
near the western boundary to di-
vert the water to enable Jimmie
Darragh apd Mick Hogan to distri-
bute it over the flats with the aid
of a pair of horses in the plough,
and a little hand-work with the
shovel. The property was used prin-
cipally as a bullock-fattening pro-
position. There was also a fairly
extensive stud of Clydesdales, with
the imported sires, “Cromwell” and
“Matchless,” at the head. For some
time after the death of the proprie-
tor, the widow and family worked
the property, but later decided to
let ic, the first tenant being Willie
Turner, who was also renting John
Thomas’ Oakfleld property, at Myrn-
long, at that time, and worked tlm
two in conjunction ; he also fattened
a large number of cattle for the
Melbourne and local market. Dur-
ing his tenancy of Broadlands, the
Blackwood diggings were at their
zenith, and the Blackwood butchers
secured the greater part of their re-
quirements in this market. Tommy
McCarthy, W. Vigor, R. Coomber
and Decker used to attend J. E.
Crook’s monthly sale, at the yards
situated at the corner of Lerderderg
and Young Streets, and clear the
yards of all fat cattle ; and there
were good yardings, principally from
W. Turner, J. Connell, Tom and Pat
Cain, and odd lots from different
farmers around. I doubt if anything
like the number of prime fat bul-
locks are now penned locally; but,
when the Blackwood diggings went
down, this sale went with them.
Turner also had a nice little
Clydesdale stud “Rantin’ Robin”
being the first stallion there, and
later “Moffat’s Conquerer” was se-
cured. He also had a decent stud
of Shorthorn cattle, the sire used
being 16th Duke of Derrimut, bred
by Morton Bros. & Leach, at Mt.
Derrimut. Like John Connell, Mr.
Turner was also a pretty regular
attendant of the Newmarket Sales,
riding to and fro on his good cob,
Rattler, a son of the famous Panic,
a sire, I consider, that did more to
improve the light horses of Victoria
than any other horse imported. I
might mention that Panic’s first
season at the stud, in 186 9, was at
Hopetoun, but as his fame was then
an unknown quality, he was neg-
lected by local breeders. As Willie
Turner was an expert judge of stock,
and a keen business man, lie nnulft


good on Broadlands, and on the ex-
piration of his lease, he purchased
the Stoney Park Estate, beyond Al-
bury. The next tenant on Broad-
lands was R. McCrane, a retired
Bendigo merchant, who was a good
class of citizen, but a failure on the
another example of
city folk seeing people on the land
“making money while they sleep.”
but he found that it did not work
out in practice, and I regret that he
left with more experience but with
a smaller banking account.
Soon afterwards Broadlands was
purchased by the Hon. Henry Mil-
ler, generally known as “Money
Miller,” who brought along Dick
Fagg as manager. This was Fagg’s
second turn in the district, as he
had previously managed a property
at Parwan for G. Cooper, who had
later removed to Bundoora, where
Fagg came in contact with Millers.
The farm mentioned at Parwan is
now the property of “Dick” Kerr.
Broadlands was again principally
devoted to grazing, but a Clydes-
dale stud was soon established, the
first stallion being Nuggett, by Prince
Charlie (imp.) from Princess Maude,
a fairy successful sire. The next
sire used was Glancer, of their own
breeding, but Hodge’s Superior, from
Blossom, by Grant’s Champion
(imp.). I think the next horse used,
Craigraore, imported from Tasmania,
was the best breeding horse that
they had on Broadlands. Afterwards
they used a couple of New Zealand
breds, which I understand, were a
bit disappointing. The breeding of
thoroughbreds, particularly jumpers,
was very successfully carried on ;
the first sire in the stud was King
Tom, whose stock was very success-
ful in steeplechases and hurdle races
of that time. The two best known
of these were Studley and Mernada,
the latter having the distinction of
being the tallest horse ever raced at
Flemington, being nearly 18 hands
high. Both of those horses were
good winners. Other sires used after
King Tom were Bras de Fer (imp.),
Newrainster, Glorious (imp.) ; the
latter begot Boolka, a useful horse,
otherwise those three were failures.
It remained for Dante to bring the
stud renown, as he was the sire of
Redleap, the best steeplechaser Vic-
toria has seen ; besides a host of
other good jumpers, including Wym-
let, a Grand National winner. At
that time Albert and Sep Miller had
the best string of jumping horses in
the State and won a number of the
principal jumping races at Fleming-
ton and Caulfield. Boolka was also
a fairly successful sire, as he left a
number of more than useful stock,
and anything not fast enough to
race was a good hack.
The next along the road then was
the Woolpack Estate, but now
altered almost beyond recognition.
There is not a trace left of the old
boxthorn-bounded racing and train-
ing track, where Bob Crook used to
gallop the horses in his charge, be-
longing to J. Whittingham, who ac-
quired a greater amount of success
than most country trainers of the
period. Among his successes were a
place with Prattle in the Australian
Cup ; a Moonee Valley Cup, with
Merrimu, a horse bred on the pro-
perty, and got by their own stallion,
Argus Scandal; and Aspen accounted
for the Newmarket Handicap for two
years in They also won
a large number of races at suburban
and country meetings. The greatest
disappointment that they met was
with the Panic horse, Riverton, as
they had expected to win the Mel-
bourne Cup with him. In addition
to the stable connections the local
punters “went down” badly, as they
were nearly all on him, as the horse
was a popular tip for the race. The
Melbourne sporting scribes asserted
freely that the trainer left the Cup
on the training track ! Not being
an authority on the matter, I cannot
venture an opinion. The old Wool-
pack hotel is still extant, and what
remains of the training stables is
now a slaughtering establishment.
There used to be a few old fami-
lies about the Woolpack in my time;
Jim Woolley and family, Davie Tyler
and George, Tom and Frank Laid-
rnan, but I suppose they have all
gone over the border long ago. There
is now a farm homestead on the
north side of the road, and, judging
by the shed accommodation, the
owner goes in extensively for lu'cerne
hay growing. Further north there
used to be a couple of good old fruit
gardens, but have all disappeared ;


as have the scrub and reeds that
grew beyond the river. It was about
there that Charlie Crook was acci-
dently shot by a young bank clerk,
in 186 7. On the west of the Wool-
pack there is a detached portion
of the Broadlands Estate, on which
was the homestead, of which no
trace now remains, the land all be-
ing under lucerne. Adjoining this
was John Daly’s Tullamore paddock
occupied by the brothers-in-law,
Billy Mackey and Tim Gleeson, as a
mixed farm. They afterwards selec-
ted land in Gippsland. Then Jerry
Ryan bought Tullamore, and Pat.
McGrath became the tenant, he was
previously renting Ryan’s property,
opposite where the Parwan railway
station now stands. McGrath went
in for dairying to the full carrying
capacity of the farm, and, when
Ryan sold out to Miller, he removed
to Crook’s farm, on the Pentland
Hills.
Like the Woolpack property, Tul-
lamore has put on an altered appear-
ance, and now carries several com-
fortable homes, surrounded by pros-
perous-looking orchards. The three-
cornered paddock opposite Tulla-
more, the site of the old iron school,
is now converted into a market gar-
den; which, I venture to predict, will
be the ultimate goal of a large por-
tion of the rich flats of my old dis-
trict, as it is admirably adapted for
the purpose, and the land is too
valuable for building purposes.
Still another changed-looking pro-
perty is Con. Mahoney’s, now carry-
ing two homes, and in contrast to
the time when Con. used to exper-
ience great difficulty in getting the
correct count of Jules Gascard’s
horses among the tall thistles. James
Mahoney’s, on the opposite side of
the road, has not been altered much,
with the execution of the dissappear-
ance of the old barn. Judging by
the amount of hay stored by the pre-
vious occupier, and the occupier of
Alick Baird’s at the back, one would
think that they must have an assur-
ance from Jupiter Pluvius that he
will shortly withhold the beneficient
dew for a long period.
Adjoining Mahoney, along the
river, is Hornell’s property, for many
years in the occupation of the
Pearce's and utilised -for several
years for chicory growing. I dare-
say a number of your present resi-
dents are not aware that T. G.
Pearce was the pioneer irrigationist
of Bacchus Marsh. The first means
used to raise the water was a Cali-
fornian pump, driven by a water-
wheel with which he used to irrigate
the chicory field. One of the old-time
floods came along and washed away
the bank behind the wheel, and also
let the pump into the river. He
then replaced this plant with a cen-
trifugal pump, driven by a steam
engine. Mr. Pearce* was also the
first man in the district to introduce
the calico hose to distribute the
water over the land. Grading and
checkbanking was not practised in
the Marsh until the advent of El-
wood Mead as head of the Irrigation
Department, though Alfred Deakin
had lectured on the subject, and re-
commended its adoption on the re-
turn from his visit to the United
States. But as he had not had
practical experience on the land ho
was looked on as a theorist, and his
advice was unheeded. The Chaffey
Bros, were the first to introduce this
method of applying the water in
Australia, on their, settlements on
the Murray.
Pearce Bros.’ chaffcutting works
were begun on the bank of the Wer-
ribee, the cutter being driven by the
engine that drove the pump, and
when the business outgrew the ac-
commodation there, more extensive
buildings were erected in Church
street, and later removed to the pre-
sent site on the railway line. All
signs of the old store on Pearce’s
land, at the east end of the town,
have gone— just the two dwellings
remain.
On the opposite side of the street,
Jim Young’s old boot shop lias given
way to a cottage. Tom Carlton's
shop looks just the same, but is now
a private dwelling. On the Fisken
street corner. Jack Cunningham’s is
still there, minus the boot trade sign
on the little shop. Crook’s paddock,
across the street, has altered for the
better, as there are a few cottages
thereon. I understand that Prank
Crook lives in Manor House, so it re-
mains in the family, but the area is
now limited, as the large block,
fronting Lerderderg and Young


streets, is nearly all built upon. Old
Stoke’s bootshop has also gone. I
suppose he had a Christian name,
but I always knew him as “Old
Stokes,” who always reminded me of
the John Bull caricatures that ap-
peared in the old magazines.
O’Hagan’s blacksmith’s shop is
partly demolished, and the Harvest
Home hotel has shed its license. The
writer often spent a few minutes be-
neath its roof when Tom Cain, Wil-
lie Jeffrey, Willie Harkness, Charlie
Gumming, and a few others would
come across after a show meeting, or
such like, just for a convival. Those
gone whence no traveller returns.
Tom Breene’s old shop still stands
on the corner of Young street, and
makes the fourth old pub, now with-
out a license. Jack Keily com-
menced his hotelkeeping there, and
then Pat Leahy and his sister, Mary
Ann, took it over, and after a time
shifted the license to Jerry Ryan’s
two-story building further up the
street. They were succeeded there
by Tim Connell. Then a couple of
strangers to the district had turns
as licensees. I think Johnny Love-
lock must have been about the last
to hold the license. The Royal
hotel is.much more commodious now
than when Tom McCanny held it up
to ’7 3, when Tom Cain took a lease
of it. During his tenancy Dick Man-
ning became the proprietor ; and, on
the expiry of Cain’s lease put his
brother-in-law, Billy Kilpatrick, in
as manager for some time, and later
took over the business himself, and
Installed Kilpatrick in the Raglan,
at Melton. Manning’s name was still
on the signboard, so I suppose a
member of the family still runs the
business.
I was sorry to note that the name
of Simpson had gone off the map,
after an honorable career of over 70
years. The butchering business be-
ing now run by a Proprietary Co. In
the years gone by I used to admire
John Simpson’s turnouts, as he had
the best of horses, well fed and
groomed, with vehicles and saddlery
spick and span. I remember a few
of his horses as if it were yesterday
that I saw them. The first was a
white cob, which met an untimely
end, as, when he grew slow for the
trade, was sold to Jim Telford, who,
when going home to Barley one
night a bit jolly, ran the horse into
the roots of a large fallen tree, op-
posite McFarlane’s Kelvin Grove,
killing him instantly. There were
two black cobs, and a splendid skew-
bald mare, but “the pick of the bas-
ket” was a little roan. Their sort
are not to be seen now.
Thos. Taubman’s Post Office store
has disappeared, and a nice brick
villa occupies the site. Across the
road, Alick Forsyth’s shop, on stilts,
is out of sight. Watt’s bootmaker’s
shop is still there, but with hats in-
stead of boots to be seen. Tom
Heath, the saddler, was still there,
but I learn has since taken his de-
parture for Sydney. No trace is left
of Jimmy Reid’s or George Marsh-
all’s wheelright or ’smithy shops.
A large milk factory is on the back
portion of the land, and a few little
shops on the frontage. I think it a
serious mistake that the factory
should be where it is—right in the
Main street. The first objection that
presents itself, as you approach the
site, is the dense volume of black
smoke hanging over the town ; and
then, when you arrive at the spot,
huge stacks of firewood reach al-
most to the footpath ; and, worse
still, a rubbish tip of tins, &c., with-
in about a chain of the path. I re-
gret to see such conditions exist in
my old birthplace. Ido not know of
any other town where the same
would be tolerated. You badly re-
quire a vigilant Progress Associa-
tion. Then, just a couple of chains
higher up, there is another rubbish
tip, in addition to a dilapidated old
fence, in the block where Johnny
Saunders’ old store stands. I do not
like criticising, but I feel constrained
to do so, and will finish the unpleas-
ant part by referring to your Main
road. The management of same
must be in league with the vendors
of tyres. The surface of the road on
Anthony’s Cutting was fearful, but
it remained for the portion through
the Pentland Hills to give our
tyres and springs the final test, as
well as the nerves of our driver.
This part of the road presents a
great opportunity for a good swear-
ing man to get a “blow off,” but as
I had not graduated into that accom-
plishment, could not get any relief


from that source. I understand that
the Country Roads Board has taken
the roads in hand, and trust that
they are in decent condition by now.
Getting back to the Main street, I
find George Wood’s old shop has
been added to, and very much im-
proved in appearance ; and the Co-
operative Company’s shops give the
impression that the Company is not
merely a visitor. They are the only
up-to-date business premises in the
street. We did not have the oppor-
tunity of looking through, as it was
a holiday. There is a “blot” be-
tween these fine premises and Geo.
Wood’s old shop. If the present
owner of George Dickie’s old store
has any interest in the appearance
of the town, he should wipe out
those old buildings, which were a
busy centre in old days, but they
have now served their time and the
important site is deserving of some-
thing better. 1 note G. G. Paterson’s
tailor’s premises are now occupied
by a hairdresser. The next old
building looks lonely and bare, it
has gone hrough some vicissitudes
—from grocer’s shop to Provincial
and Suburban Bank, barber’s shop,
saddler’s shop, sundries store, and
now appears to be a combination of
saddler’s and boot shop.
It just occurs to me that this part
of the street was the cradle of a few
politicians, as Willie Field, who lived
beside this old shop, became the
Member for Collingwood ; and Harry
Beardmore, who worked in his
father’s butchery opposite, is now
member for an Upper Murray elec-
torate ; and last, though not least,
George Dickie, jun., who was a mem-
ber for the Southern Province in the
Legislative Council, and there was
general regret wffien that useful and
promising career was too soon cut
off. As all know, A. R. Robertson,
who was the local M.L.A. for over
20 years, is a native of the district;
and your present member for Bulla
(Ralph Hjorth) could throw a stone
from the home of his birth into the
Shire. Though not a district native,
the present Speaker of the Assembly
(Johnny Bowser) was reared and
educated here.
Anderson’s Border Store has been
enlarged and improved, and now ap-
pears to be in the hands of a mem-
ber of the third generation of the
family. The present post-office looks
about the same as when built. Only
the older generation will remember
when the post-office was in Taub-
man’s store, next to Simpson’s, and
later on in a brick cottage, opposite
the present National Bank. The
A.N.A. now have their own hall,
next to the post-office ; the block of
land on which both stand was a gift
from S. T. Staughton, M.L.A. Willie
Marshall’s blacksmith’s shop, next
door, has given way to a number of
small shops and offices. Ryan’s cor-
ner looks just the same, and his tw j
story shop opposite appears to be
now a miscellaneous shop. The
Border Inn has been made some-
thing more up-to-date, it is also run
by one of the third generation of
Jones’. H. Hodgson’s hardware
store is still on the opposite corner;
the adjoining block has been much
improved by the erection of sub-
stantial two-story brick buildings for
the Commercial and State Savings
Banks. This site was where George
Taylor’s saddler’s shop used to be ;
while the one adjoining, long known
as Tracey’s, is now occupied by a
fruiterer. Pearce Bros’, general
store is another in which the third
generation holds possession. Tan-
ner’s old Court House Hotel has un-
dergone a transformation ; the old
wooden shop, on the corner of the
Church of Elngland block, has given
way to more modern brick buildings,
while Harry Craven’s old shop on
the opposite side of the street, is re-
placed by a two-story terrace of
shops ; and there is now a garage on
what was a vacant corner. Vere
Quayle’s old blacksmith’s shop, and
afterwards Hugh Meikle’s, has dis-
appeared, and a brick shop (serving
tho same purpose) now stands a
little further west.
Had a look through the Church of
England graveyard, and saw the
resting place of several pioneers of
the district. One that I could not
locate was that of William Henry
Shelverton, who was manager for
Captain Bacchus, and was killed in
a riding accident. Needless to say,
I do not remember this incident, but
his grandson, the manager of the
Silverton Tramways, was my inform-
ant, and told me that they pay for


the grave being looked after ; but,
evidently, there is no inscription to
identify it.
It being your local show day, I
took a run over, and was just in
time to see the parade, led by the
champion Clydesdale stallion. I do
not know what the breeders of 50
years ago would say if they could
only see the present day type of cart
horse. It just occurred to me the
contrast between this champion and
the champion at the first show that
I remember attending. It was held
in a two-acre block on the north-
east corner of your present show-
grounds. The champion on that oc-
casion was John Thomas’s “Dan
O’Connell”, a horse that could carry
the present type on his back. Not
many old residents will remember
“Dan O’Connell,” but Bill Lyle, Jim
Kerr, Joe Lodge, and a few others
interested in horses at that time will
do so. The breach in thorough-
breds was greater still. I remember
attending your show in the early
90’s, when the best ring of thorough-
bred stallions that I have seen was
brought before the judges. The
three placed horses were the best in
the State of their day, and each a
Melbourne Cup winner -—■ Mentor,
Carbine and Malua, placed in that
order by the judges. The most in-
teresting highjumping contest that
I ever witnessed was decided on
your grounds, the finish being fought
out by Seton Williams’ big grey
hunter “Eversley,” ridden by his
owner, and Tom Cain’s weight-carry-
ing cob, “Sailor,” ridden by the vet-
eran Martin Cosgrove. No cruelty
was involved, and not any persuasion
required, as both horses appeared to
enjoy the excitement equally with
their riders and onlookers. If I re-
member correctly, “Eversley” just
won—or, it may have been a tie.
The standard of the light horses
generally was not what it used to be
—but that is not singular to your
district, as, since the advent of
motor travelling, light horse breed-
ing has been too much neglected.
There was still a few good ponies
to be seen. The cattle pens were
lightly filled, compared to the old
days. The few Shorthorns shown
were of good class, but the up-to-
show types Ayrshires were very few
—quite different to the time when
the principal exhibitors were T. A.
Grant, Jas. Bourke, R. Kirkwood, J.
T. Burnip and others. The Jerseys
were never a strong class, and are
not now any improvement on the
time when Martin Cosgrove was the
leading exhibitor of the breed. A
few of a breed, not in the district in
my time, the Friesians, were exhib-
ited, but as I do not know much
about them, will not venture any
opinion on their merits. The first
man that I remember to have those
cattle was David Mitchell, of Cave
Hill, and while they manufactured
cheese on the property the breed was
much valued, but when they sup-
plied fresh milk to the city they had
to part with them. In a dairying
district, looked on as one of the best
in the State, one is disappointed to
find that the greatest slump in both
numbers and quality is in the dairy
cattle. The pen accommodation
used to be fully taxed, and every
animal exhibited equal, if not super-
ior, to the best shown now. I sup-
pose it is accounted for by the fact
that the factories do not return any
skim-milk, therefore the dairy farm-
ers do not rear their own good heifer
calves, as they look on the proposi-
tion as being too expensive, in the
face of the value of new milk. Not
having too much time, I did not see
the sheep or swine, nor the exhibits
in the pavilion.
Leaving the yards, I had a look
at the new bridge over the Werribee
which is a substantial structure, but,
if ever the Ballan and Blakeville ter-
ritory gets their old-time copious
rainfalls, it will relieve the dayman
of flushing the street channels for
a time. The big wooden building of
the Nestle Milk Co., on the river
bank, is now out of use. The old
Maddingley road (now Grant street)
presents an altered appearance since
my time. The only buildings there
were two cottages near the corner
of Pilmer street. I think they be
longed to Bob Morton; both have
since been re-built, or renovated.
Next to them was Ned Worthy’s; the
only others were Sandy Murdoch’s,
at the corner of Waddell street ; and
Mrs, Balmer’s little home, nearer to
the Main street.
Since the subdivision of those por-


tions of Millbank, quite a number
of buildings have been added to the
town, including a few business pre-
mises.
I took a run out as far as the
bridge at Darley, and found that it
was on the north side of the old
Marsh town that the greatest build-
ing progress had been made. Ham-
ilton McFarlane’s paddock is now a
residential area, there being some
nice villas in Lerderderg street ;
while the west side of Gisborne road
(Grant’s paddock) contains several
nice up-to-date-looking residences,
and more in course of erection, on a
nice sloping foundation. I suppose
the dwellers on that part look on it
as the local “Toorak.” Further on,
I found that Darley Common and
racecourse had been subdivided for
workmen’s homes, with a portion re-
tained as a Park. Many a picnic
race meeting I attended on that
ground, which used to attract quite
large attendances from the sur-
rounding districts. Over the bridge,
I saw the present owner of Lerder-
derg Park had built his home right
on the northern boundary of his pro-
perty. I was glad to learn that he
is a man with progressive ideas, and
sold the major portion of the estate
in handy areas, on good extended
terms. If some of his neighbours
followed the example, it would be of
much benefit to the district. He ap-
pears to be making good use of the
portion that he has retained, judg-
ing by the erections for the conser-
vation of fodder, and the result of
same is reflected in the well-fed and
cared-for appearance of a seled
dairy herd.
On turning back, we find the Dar-
ley Firebrick Co. still going strong
—which is a big local asset, as it
must employ a number of hands.
The industry was commenced by
David Mitchell, one of Victoria’s
most enterprising citizens, who was
the first owner in the State to cut
up an estate for closer settlement,
when he subdivided his Jancourt
Estate, at Camperdown ; but, unfor-
tunately for himself, the innovation
was a bit ahead of the times, as the
dairying potentialities of that dis-
trict were not then so well known ;
and, at the present time, most of
the blocks would realize four and
five times the amount that he re-
ceived for them at the subdivisional
sale. But he received better value
when he sold Gooramadda Estate, on
the Murray, at North Prentice, to H.
E. Kugelman, and the Colbinabbin
Estate, near Rushworth, to the Go-
vernment, for Closer Settlement.
Coming back frojn Darley, I had
to turn West again to complete
another stage before night , and
picked up a companion going as far
as Myrniong, who knew all the pre-
sent occupiers along the road to
there. It is remarkable how few of
the places are occupied by descen-
dants of families of the old times.
Leaving the top of Stamford hill,
John Lyle’s “Underbank” has passed
out of the hands of the family, and
is now Sol. Green’s property, and
our friend informed us that the lat-
ter is going to make the place one of
the show stud farms of the State.
I was pleased to hear that ; and, no
doubt, it can be done by judicious
expenditure, as he has the founda-
tion to work on; he has a variety of
soils, from the richest black river
flat to the light soil on the uplands.
Others that have changed hands are
Sandy Munro’s, Paul Johnson’s, on
this side of Lyle’s Creek. On the
West side, Andy Robertson repre-
sents the old name on “Hilton,” and
Willie Robertson is on Jim Main’s
old home, north of the Bald Hill.
Tom Low’s farm has passed out from
the old name ; as has Albin Clo-
thier’s Tabletop farm, and J. E.
Crook’s. On the north side of the
road, Alick and Gregor Robertson’s,
and Tom Fairbairn’s, know those
names no more. Further back,
Willie Johnston’s “Oaklands” shares
the same fate ; but John Myers’
“Cairnbank” is still in possession of
the family, but the names of his two
good old cousin Jock neighbors,
Isaac Evans and Bill Richards, have
gone off the local map. Bill and
Maggie Meikle still hold forth on
“Meikleriggs,” but further on, no
family representatives are on the
farms of John Dryden, Willie Brown,
Bob Freame, Archie Brown, Willie
Dunbar, Peter McClusky or George
Grant. Tom Smith’s farm still
houses a member of the family, so
only four names are representative
of the families of 50 years ago, from


Lyle’s creek, west of the Bald Hill,
to the Mt. Blackwood road, on the
north side of the Ballarat road, and
to the Myrniong creek on the south
side. Some years ago this Estate
was sold in blocks, to five different
buyers ; some of those blocks have
been resold, but I understand the
number of owners remains the same.
Some years later, John Thomas’
“Oakfield” was subdivided, and now
has tour owners instead of one.
If you have plenty of printer’s
ink, I will write you again on the
next wet day.
On reading over “Recollections,”
I find that there are a few more
names which should be mentioned,
as, without them, any reference to
travelling over the Keilor Plains
does not appear replete. On coming
through the railway gates at Syden-
ham, Pat. Coburn was not there to
open them. Pat. was a well-known
figure to all having any business at
the Keilor road railway station, as
he was assistant S.M., porter, goods
shed attendant, shunter and gate-
keeper, and, no matter how busy he
was, had a pleasant word for every-
one. Crawford Harvie and his good
wife are no longer in the bluestone
hotel to attend to the wants of their
patrons. I often stayed there over
night, and was always well looked
after. Another to be met on the
road once a week was Charlie Dens-
ley, the bullock driver. He used to
leave Hopetoun in the morning, and
get to Spring Gully by evening,
where he used to turn out his team
for the night; the next morning, he
would get to Keilor road, and, get-
ting rid of his loading would get
back to Spring Gully by evening
and put in the second night under
the bullock waggon, and reach Hope-
toun again on the third day. This
was not so speedy as the present-day
motor-truck, but was good time in
those days. Charlie was a bit of a
prodigy as an old-time bullock
driver, as he did not indulge in
strong liquor or strong language.
The strongest of the latter that I
ever heard him resort to was “The
dash’n thing.” Although his was a
hard and strenuous life, he lived to
be one of your oldest residents, as
he must have been closely approach-
ing the century when he answered
the final call. It seems strange to
me that I overlooked Bob Carter’s
name among the old coach drivers,
as I knew Bob from a small boy,
when his people lived in Spotswood’s
paddock on the creek, joining Louis
Scott’s. Another dashing team to
be seen on the road in those days,
at frequent intervals, was C. H.
Lyon’s four-in-hand team of blacks,
ably piloted by the owner. Your
older residents will remember that
he used to send a relay team to
Anthony’s cutting, change there and
send the tired team back to Ballanee
—if they were not tired, I think
they should have been, considering
the pace they were driven. One
more who regularly drove to Keilor
Road was Molesworth Greene, but
he was content to sit behind a pair,
and not much grass grew under
their hoofs while “Kangaroo” and
“Actor” were cutting-out the 2 5
miles separating “Greystones” from,
Keilor Road.
It is a bit difficult to recall all
old names and incidents, when one
has not a scrap of record to refer
to, but just to rely solely on memory.
I duly received your enclosing
letter addressed to the writer. 1
felt a bit timorous in opening it, lest
I should have incurred the ire of
someone on the ad-lib treatment of
their names, but was grateful to find
that same was a note of thanks from
a lady-—whom I did not know
existed—for the tone of references
to her ancestors ; so lam assured
that there is, at least, one interested
reader of these jottings.
As I am just giving the first part
of “Recollections” a bit of a brush-
up, before breaking new ground, I
will mention that after Andrew
Town secured “Muir Lad,” he also
purchased the imported mare “Glas-
gow Maggie.” I forget the price
now, but it was about the highest
ever paid in the State, and her first
foal to “Muir Lad” was “Australian
Maggie,” a mare that was never
beaten in the showyard. Andrew
Town also possessed one of the best
thoroughbred studs in Australia, the
leading sire being “Maribyrnong; ”
his most successful brood mare was
“The Fawn,” by “The Premier.”
This combination produced Rich-
mond, Bosworth, Palmyra, Segenhoe


and Warwick, which quintette ac-
counted for a couple of Derbies and
three Maribyrnong Plates, and there
were two “duds” in the family, as
Astarte and Richmond Belle never
won enough to pay for an oat.
“Maribyrnong” was bred by Hurtle
and C. B. Fisher on their stud of
that name, on the Saltwater River.
His sire was Fisherman (imp.), and
his dam Roe de Florence (imp.),
She was also the dam of Redleap’s
sire. “Dante.” Some of your old
district punters will remember those
racehorses. In noting Bob Crook’s
success as a trainer, his first big
win slipped my memory, as I was
hurriedly writing, that was in ’7l,
when he trained his father’s little
grey horse, “Saladin,” by the im-
ported Arab “Pegasus,” and won
the Australian Cup after the two
memorable dead heats with “Flying
Dutchman.” Saladin was ridden by
W. Swailes ; I do not remember the
trainer or rider of Flying Dutchman,
as all interest was then centred in
the local steed. Flying Dutchman
was brought to the district later by
Pat Leahy, when he was leasing the
“Bullengarook Estate,” and used as
a stud horse, and left a lot of very
useful stock. M. O’Connell drove a
pair of nice bays by him in his fam-
ily waggonette for several years.
On reading the notes on the
Broadlands jumping horses, most
readers would infer that “Wymlet”
won that Grand National for Sep.
Miller, but it was not so. He being
a very bad horse to ride—to use a
colloquialism, “got the wind up” all
the Mill Park stable riders —-and was
sold as an incorrigible; but Martin
Loughlin who was fond of owing a
good “lepper,” said that Tommy
Corrigan would straighten-up Wym-
let, and, backing his judgment,
bought the horse, and had the satis-
faction of bringing off the coup ; and
if ever a rider deserved as much
credit as the horse, that was the
occasion, as the horse was in one of
his bad moods, but, in the hands of
the best cross-country jockey in the
State, he had to go through the per-
formance. As I admit holding a bit
of a brief for old Panic, I will men-
tion that Redleap’s dam, Pandora,
was a daughter of the old horse.
When referring to that exciting
high jump at the local show, I might
have mentioned, for the information
of the younger generation, that both
of the contesting horses were prac-
tically local, as Seton Williams, at
that time, did most of the legal
business of the district, and his
father, the Rev. Montague Williams,
was the respected incumbent of
Holy Trinity Church, and, to add
another link -to his connection with
the district, made the daughter of
the Member for West Bourke (S. T.
Staughton) Mrs. Seton Gordon Wil-
liams.
On casting my mind back to the
day that I came through the old
town, I remember seeing several re-
freshment and tea rooms, which are
very handy for travellers. In my
time, if you wanted anything in that
line you had to go to a hotel, as
there was not a tearoom in the
town ; and the only fruit shop in the
street was old Jack Payne’s, at the
top of the Main street. If I remem-
ber aright, the block where it stood
is now vacant. The only competi-
tion that Jack had in the fruit
business was from an old woman
named Betty Cullen, who had a
little garden on the east side of what
is now Maddingiey Park, but was
then known as the Government pad-
dock, and was occupied by Ned
Sloss, who was given the use of the
paddock for several years on the
condition that he enclosed same with
a substantial fence.
When in the showground, we had
a glance at the High School, which
is a fine building and should be an
asset to the district. On leaving
there we found that the Railway
hotel is vastly improved since Jim-
mie Alford started it in four rooms,
built from the material taken from
Howden’s old grocery shop, which
stood a few chains south from the
corner. The present licensee is an
ex-Gippslander, but we did not see
the jovial Mick —I suppose he was
at the show. The Bridge Inn has
also been enlarged, and brought to
be more up-to-date looking, but ap-
pears to have passed from the hands
of the Vallence family. The old
Police paddock is one of the spots
that shows a vast change for the
better, as there are now a number fo
cottages and gardens on what was


an area covered with thistles and
weeds. Noting the improvement
here brings Joe Lodge’s name to my
mind. Joe is a man of many attri-
butes. When a lad he learned the
wheelwright .trade with Geordie
Drysdale, at Myrniong; when run
into up north he was stud groom;
and later qualified as a prize plough-
man; and, if all the achievements
as a fully-blown orchardist and in-
tense culturist that I have read of in
your paper are “fair dinkum,” he
should hold an appointment as
practical demonstrator in that
branch of the Deparment of Agri-
culture. He must have transformed
that little property on the hill, as
when Bill Martin lived on it he
could not grow enough to feed his
wife’s two nannie goats!
The irrigation scheme has made
a great change in the possibilities of
your favored district, but I cannot
refrain from repeating that it suffers
from the want of some public-
spirited resident, to give, the old
place a bit of a boost, A little time
ago I looked forward to meeting a
lot of the old residents, but was very
disappointed when I learned that the
“Lack to Bacchus Marsh” movement
had fizzled out through that cause.
I am grateful to note some improve-
ments since the old times, as you
now have gas and electricity, which
are a great convenience, and the
town water supply is a vast im-
provement on the time when Tom
Breen was Chief Commissioner; with
“Bob” in the shafts of the tip-dray,
and a couple of casks as containers,
lie was kept very busy on washing
days, and used to have to keep a
close watch on housewives, lest they
should work a “Scotch Dodge” on
him. At that time Tom lived in a
little house, surrounded by myrtle
scrub, in Stobie’s paddock. The
Council saleyards are now on the
eastern end of this paddock, and all
signs of the scrub have disappeared.
Another old identity, Tom Kissock,
used to live close by, in a greystone
house, afterwards the Church of
England rectory. Tom used to take
a great interest in the comfort of
the coach passengers of those days,
and was always down at the Border
Inn in time to see that the barman
was up to minister to the wants of
those leaving by the early morning
coach. There was no “close season”
—6 p.m. to 9.30 a.m. —in those
times for the hotels.
As a local industry, brickmaking
seems to have vanished, as all the
bricks in the new buildings appear
to be city made. This seems strange,
as if same had been manufactured
locally it must have meant a sub-
stantial sum retained in the district.
There is no doubt about there being
good brick clay, i suppose it is the
want of enterprise of the owners of
the pits to install up-to-date mac-
hinery. When we ran down Lerder-
derg street, I noted that the bricks
in the walls of St. Bernard’s Church
look as well as the day they were
laid, after withstanding the wear of
sunshine and rain for about 55
years. The most of these bricks
were taken from a clay-pit in Ler-
derderg street, just at the north end
of Crook street. It then belonged
to a man named Worthy, and the
balance was made by old Jack Roe
and Leper Hurry Wells. While
viewing this building I could not
miss contrasting the foundation with
the majority of the buildings of
those days. Those big blue stones
were all cut out by Steve Whelan,
from a gully in Sandy McLellan’s
paddock at Parwan, just south from
the Parwan School. This paddock
was later purchased by Harry Val-
lence. I do not remembr who was
the contractor for the church build-
ing, but Joseph Francis Taylor was
the Clerk of Works, and he must
have been attentive to his job. I
understand that a grandson, bearing
the same name, is your leading
local builder at the present time.
i cannoi remenroer the Presby-
terian church being built, so it must
be the oldest church building in the
town. One incident always reminds
me of the time that Holy Trinity
Church was being erected. I was
riding out —I think it was to Rows-
ley—and when I reached Maddingley
bridge, same was barricaded by
Wattie Harkness’s bullock dray load
of stone for the structure. The load
proving too much for the decking
of the old bridge, his off wheel hub
was resting on the deck. It took
a good deal of persuasion, including
Wattle’s threat with the bullock


whip, to get my steed to pass on.
This old bridge was soon afterwards
demolished, and a new truss bridge,
designed by your Shire Engineer
(W. E. Stanfield) erected in its
stead, the contractors being Bill and
Frank Pezet. That bridge, in its
turn, has given way to the steel and
concrete structure now in use.
I noticed that the Grant family
still retain a good portion of the
Millbank farm as a lucerne-growing
and dairying proposition. I should
imagine that the frontages will soon
be too valuable and expensive to
continue working as such, especially
in the face of the outcry against the
recent valuation of properties in the
Shire, that has been voiced by a
number of landowners through the
medium of “The Express.” I trust
the present generation of this
family live up to the example set
them by their father (Willie Grant).
I think he must easily have been
the best-natured man in the town.
If ever mere was a position offering
that carried no remuneration, and
often very little thanks, Willie was
looked to to fill same. In my time,
I think he must have been President
or Treasurer of nearly every insti-
tution in the district, from the Agri-
cultural Society to the Quoit Club,
and those honors usually carried the
privilege of paying a subscription [
There is another name that I feel
tempted to mention, as he must be
getting well up among your oldesl
men, though not among the oldest
residents, as I remember when he
came there, a sturdy young man,
and must now be well past the four
score mark on this planet, and, like
old Charlie Densley, it is not be-
cause of an idle and easy life that
he has attained those years. As
your oldest resident will remember,
Billy Telford was a carrier in his
young days, and worked long hours.
I know if you wanted to see him in
the morning, before he got past the
Pyrette, you had to be out before
the lark. I do not know what time
he used to start from home, but I
do know that he used to give the
sun a “good go” to see which would
“show up” first on the top of An-
thony’s Cutting, after having-
travelled five or six miles. On com-
ing back from the city, it was only
rarely that he did not have a good
sort of a macadam-tired horse tied
behind his waggon, and if one
happened to have a fresh one, he was
always eager for a “swop,” and if
the balance of trade chanced to be
against him, he always had some-
thing to offer as barter —either a
wheelbarrow, a watch, a set of har-
ness, &c. He always claimed to be
an Irishman, but from his eagerness
to pay in kind instead of sterling,
one would think there was a bit of
the “Yid” in his ancestry. This is
the obverse side, but, to judge a
character correctly, I consider if
you take the opinion of his nearby
neighbors, you will get pretty near
it, and all of Billy Telford’s neigh-
bors were ever-ready to sound his
praises as an obliging neighbor. If
they wanted the loan of a horse in
cultivation time, or a waggon in
harvest time, they said that they
knew where to get it, and if they
were a bit short of cash when the
rates were due (and same were not
such big items then as now) they
could always depend on William
(they gave him his full name when
asking a favor) seeing them through,
and they said he never looked for
payment until after the barley was
sold.
Your younger generation wil con-
sider it strange that Bacchus Marsh
landholders should ever have been
short of cash, but, at that time,
there was not an irrigation scheme,
no milk factories, and no dairy pro-
duce export trade. In the spring-
time, dairy butter was usually worth
from sd. to 6d. per lb., and as it
takes about 2i gallons of milk to
produce a pound of butter worth
5Jd. and if you give that sum to
Tommy to work out when he comes
home from school this afternoon,
and when he furnishes the answer
you will know that the dairy far-
mers of those days required to pro-
duce a very large number of gallons
of milk to secure a large cheque.
If any of your readers doubt those
figures, let them interview Tom.
Anderson to have them verified, and,
if they find him in a communicative
mood, he may tell them that he
often bought below those prices. He
was the biggest dealer in the com-
modity at that time, and in the


winter used to purchase all the
spring-potted butter right out as far
as Bullengarook, as the Mesdames
Gorman, Flanagan, Carroll and all
the other Mesdames around would
not trust any other merchant to give
them a fair deal, but said they could
always depend on Tom doing the
straight thing with them. If he re-
ceived a large order, he used to
sometimes go out west as far as
Pat. Hickey’s, where he used to buy
the butter by the ton, and am
pleased to say that Pat, held the
same high opinion of your old towns-
man.
I am afraid some of your readers
will think that “Pyrette” has not
much to do, but, like picking
pockets, memorising bygone times
has a bit of a fascination ; but,,
should your readers show inclination
to tire of same, just give “the wink”
and I will not further offend.
I duly received your second letter
containing an enclosure, and on
opening same find that another in-
terested reader is also a lady. I
was not aware that “The Express”
was read on the far side of the
Lachlan river, N.S.W. Unlike the
first lady correspondent, this one is
not a perfect stranger to me, as I
think we went to school at the same
time —I fancy we were in the same
class as youngsters (now a good
while ago.)
I had a second experience the
other day of learning that “The Ex-
press” finds its way to long dis-
tances from home. As I boarded a
train I found that three fellow pas-
sengers were discussing the ques-
tion of who was the best auctioneer
of the old days, and, after listening
for a little, I found that the men-
tion of the old firms, in the first
part of these jottings, was the root
of the discussion, so I became an
interested listener-in. One of them
unreservedly gave the palm to John
George Dougharty ; another was
equally emphatic that John Murray
Peck was the better, and the third
considered Charlie Lynott the best
of the old brigade. As I take it they
will again read “The Express,” I
will give them my opinion to go on.
It will get them thinking where they
struck “Pyrette,” as I did not give
any sign that I was interested in
their conversation. John Dougharty
was very fluent, with a good com-
mand of language, but he would be
absolutely lost in the present-day
style of quick knocks. When John
Murray Peck had finished with a
pen of bullocks, I think he left as
little in them as the next man, as
his good old brusque style appeared
to have the confidence of seller and
buyer. I could never see Charlie
Lynott among the first three, except
when selling pure stock. Then, with
his exceptional memory of pedigrees,
he was on his own. For a straight-
out tip for first —taking good judg-
ment of values, a clear, strong voice,
backed up by a copious flow of re-
partee—l would name Stratford
Strettle. He had the advantage of
coming on the scene when the star
of the other men had commenced to
wane. It must be remembered that
selling in those days, compared to
the present, is vastly different, as
they had practically their own time
to display their oratory. With the
next generation of salesmen began
the era of hustle, when, to get in a
few extra words, it had to be done
edgeways. I think Sandy Smith
went up on top then, and after-
wards. I think a good many of
your readers will agree when I say
that I consider Bob Fairbairn held
his own. Jack Stanford and Harry
Peck appear now to be the connect-
ing link between the old order and
the new. E. J. Cordner is now one
of the oldest active auctioneers, but
not among the oldest firms at New-
market, as it was only about the be-
ginning of the nineties that he and
his then partner, Walter Reynell,
shifted their head office from Ben-
digo to Melbourne. Another who
has put in a good term on the fence
is Charlie Matthews, who used to
sell for Howe & McCollough, and
when that firm was absorbed by
Dalgety & Co., went over with them.
When down to the city I often
take a run out to Newmarket, but I
find that the majority of those now
on the rail are strange to me. To
my mind a large number of the
young ones lack the personality of
those of the older generations. The
majority of them put an exaggerated
amount of energy into their efforts,
and, as far as I can judge they


might as well be automatons for all
the heed the bidders appear to take
of them. I do not think any of the
old habitues of the saleyards could
picture Jack Stanford with his hat
tilted at an angle of 70 degrees, or
Charlie Lynott, working themselves
into a state of frenzy when selling a
pen of stock. One notable exception
to this rule is William McLean, who
adopts the mannerism of his father
when offering a pen of prime Gipps-
landers but it is when Willie under-
takes to castigate some erring one,
who has had the temerity to cross
his path, that he secures attention.
I do not think there is one of the
old-time stockmen now left in the
flesh, the last that I knew being
Harry Mawbey, who afterwards be-
came an auctioneer. Noah Holland
and Frank Mortisen had previously
passed away.
Now, to get nearer lo the old spot.
As I had only previously mentioned
J. E. Crook as a local auctioneer, I
will inform the younger generation
that William Anderson carried on
the business for a number of years,
and, when years began to tell, took
in his son-in-law (Geordie Bence)
as partner, who was a very live
auctioneer ; and, on the death of the
senior partner, Hutch Paterson be-
came associated with the business ;
but later this partnership was ter-
minated, and Hutch went into the
employ of Campbell & Sons, of
Kirk’s Bazaar, with whom he was
a valued member of the staff until
his all too soon demise. The next
change in this business was when L.
A. Pairbairn & Co. took it over, Bob
Dugdale being the resident partner.
I knew Bob well, from a small boy,
and often met him while he was in
this business. On his retirement, to
go on the land, the business was
disposed of to the present firm of
Smith, Blake & Co. I also knew
Arthur Blake as a lad.
About the last decade of the last
century, Johnny and George Simp-
son launched out as auctioneers, but
I think Johnny was too good-
natured for some of his clients. I
think Humphrey Bloomfield taught
him a few points. However, he soon
withdrew from the firm, and George
carried on alone for a while, and
then gave over to McPhail Bros. &
Co. I was well acquainted with
both of these brothers. Jim used
to sell for Strettle Co., but when
W. Adamson left the produce busi-
ness, to go into the live stock trade,
he secured the services of both of
them. Then in ’92, when Adam-
son amalgamated with Strettle &
Co., the two McPhail brothers began
on their own account and soon
worked up a lucrative business, par-
ticularly in the dairy cattle and pig
markets. Both have now crossed
the bourne whence none return.
But the business still goes on, un-
der the management of a younger
generation, and if Bill Anderson is
as good in the box as he was at his
books, he will take some keeping up
to. Early in the present century,
another of your local talent gave
the business a fly, but I understand,
was disappointed with himself, and
"chucked in his alley” early.
I sometimes wonder how your
present-day amusement-loving popu-
lace would fare if they had to de-
pend on the old-time entertainments
for their evening pleasure. There
was not any jazz or moving pictures,
nor motors to run around in. It
was quite a big contract to secure
a party of city vocalists, as the
travelling took so long, owing to the
slow mode of transit. I do not sup-
pose there are many in the town
now who remember the old ‘‘penny
readings” and concerts, when G. G.
Paterson usually opened proceed-
ings with a reading—he was a very
good reader, and used to make the
most of it throwing out his chest,
just like Stan. Bruce unfolding his
policy speech. (You never heard a
Prime Minister do so in the Marsh —•
the way-back dwellers score on you,
sometimes !) Then Peter Robertson
would come on with serio-comics.
P. K. O’Hara (the father of our
Victorian Lyric poet) often assisted,
usually something of his own com-
position, with a good smack of
satire, as a rule. Then William
Bennett would mount the stage, to
give ‘‘Pretty Folly Perkins,” which
he could do very well. There were
others, whom I cannot recall, but
Bob Crook was about the star per-
former, as he generally had some-
thing of the latest (at that time)
from the pantomimes. He was also


a very good ventriloquist, and gave
some amusing stunts, especially so,
to the younger division of the audi-
ence. If your present-day young-
sters read these notes, some of them
will be fancying that the writer
must have been here before the
flood ! During the seventies, the
talent for our concerts often came
across from Gisborne. I do not
know the reason of that town being
in advance of B.M. in vocalists. I
can remember the most of those who
used to assist from that quarter :
Miss IKate Dwyer, who became Mrs.
Joe Starkie ; Miss Lizzie Hamilton,
now Mrs. Joe Brady ; Miss Seranny
Hill, who became the wife of their
local station master ; and Miss Annie
Levack; and the troop would not be
complete without Pat Hart and his
violin. A little later, a few of the
local ladies took courage to face the
audience. Mrs. Francis and Miss
Maggie Watson had very good voices
but they dimmed their popularity
with the audiences by invariably
giving the same items ; the younger
fry at the back would begin to hum
“The Blue Alsatian Mountains”
when the latter lady’s name was an-
nounced by the chairman to give
the next song. With the advent of
the railway, giving a quicker con-
nection Avith the city, the local aud-
iences became more fastidious, and
were not satisfied with any but the
best. At different times I remember
hearing Signor Paladini, Walter
Kirby, E. H. Hanstein, and that
versatile entertainer, Joseph Bias-
check, at later concerts ; and I do
not expect that your present-day
audiences are any less difficult to
please.
Before leaving this subject there
is one concert that I must single
out —a goodly number of your older
residents will remember it —as I
feel sure that anyone who was pre-
sent Avill never forget same. It was
held on the date of a ploughing
match, that took place in Dickie’s
paddock, on the Gisborne road. The
lady vocalists duly arrived, but the
male talent that was expected failed
to put in an appearance ! I do not
remember the reason ! I know it was
not through a “blow-out” because
such was unheard of in those days.
However, after the ladies had given
their items, and still no sign of the
gents, the committee got three from
among the audience —one local and
two visitors to the ploughing match,
and as it had been a rather wintry
day, all three were semi-fortified
against the effects during the day,
and I shouldn’t wonder but they had
“jist anither” with their evening
meal at the Royal. I cannot recall
their encore items, but their star
pieces were Bob Kirkwood’s “High-
land Mary,” Jimmie McCalman’s
“Danny O’Nale,” and Malcolm Rit-
chie’s “The Barrin’ o’ the old door,”
and if laughter were the measure of
success, then that was the most suc-
cessful concert that has been given
in your hall.
In the olden days there was more
interest taken in politics in the old
spot. Those were the times of
Graham Berry (Protectionist) ver-
sus James Service (Freetrader).
There was a large membership of
the local protection and Reform
League, the leading spirits being
Mark Kyle, as President, and Tom
Anderson, Secretary, and they had
a very enthusiastic following. Mark’s
spirit seemed to have fired nearly all
the lower-end residents to attend
the meetings. Bob and Mat. Lind-
say, from away up the creek, and
Sam Cox, from Yonder Hill, used to
regularly turn up, and many others
from equally long distances; and if
you wanted a little ginger put into
the proceedings you only had to
bump against Tom Heath or Billy
Robertson —the latter used to drive
Pearce Bros.’ team to Keilor road.
Mat. Lindsay was another pretty hot
member, but he used to allow his
temper to get so much the better of
him that he could not argue the
point at issue. I remember Mat,
coming to a meeting addressed by
John Halfey, when the latter was
wooing the electors of the Southern
Province to return him as their
member in the Legislative Council.
Mat. put a question to him, in which
the former was much interested, as
he was then local Rabbit Inspector,
and the candidate mistaking it for
a hostile one, vouchsafed a very un-
mannerly answer. Mat. picked up
his hat and vowed that he would
strike out the name of the Protec-
tionist candidate, but I do not know


what may have occurred between
then and polling day. I never could,
at that time, feel excited over poli-
tics (and less now) although I
used to so often hear my old friend
Mark Kyle enthusing on the sub-
ject. One election night, when the
results as they came through, ac-
cording to his desire, placing Alfred
Deakin and Sam Staughton in the
lead, Mark addressed a little knot
of us outside the old post-office, but
I can only recall the closing words,
they were, “They say the people
about the Deep Creek are fools, but
I say we are brave warriors !” And
Jim McCullagh supplied the anti-
phon, “That’s corract, onny how!”
If Mark can recall this little per-
oration, there is one whose presence
in the group I trust he does not re-
member.
The Freetrade section did not ap-
pear to have such a numerous fol-
lowing, the foremost lights being J.
E. Crook, Davie Robertson, George
Wood, George Dickie and Johnston
Barradell ; but, unlike the Protec-
tion and Reform League, they were
never much in the limelight, except
at election time, when the atmos-
phere became a bit electrical at
times, when the candidates were be-
ing supported and heckled by the
two opposing factions.
Although the old place never had
the distinction of being represented
by a Prime Minister, it had, in pre-
Federation days, the honor of hav-
ing the Premier of Victoria (Sir
Bryan O’Laughlen) as its represen-
tative in the Legislative Assembly,
and Alfred Deakin, as Solicitor-
General, in the succeeding Ministry ;
and, later on, A. R. Robertson as
Minister for Lands, in a short-lived
Bent Ministry, so the old place has
not fared badly politically.
I was gratified to note by “The
Express” of 19th Feb. that at least
one of the sterner sex gets some
pleasure from reading these scrib-
filings, and am thankful to Mr. J.
Lodge for supplying the price of
“Glasgow Maggie,” sold at William
McCulloch’s sale at “La Rose,” as
that figure justifies my statement
that the price was a high one; ana,
as Mr. Lodge saw her sold the price
was impressed on him. I was not
at this sale, though I had often been
at “La Rose,” which is situated on
Reynard’s Road, leading from North
Essendon railway station to where
was then known as Pentridge, where
there are large accommodation pre-
mises for folk who do things they
shouldn’t do. After a time, the
town that grew up around tills
establishment felt an objection to
same being known by the same
name as Her Majesty’s Hospice, an.l
prevailed on the powers then in
office to bestow on their rising little*
town that good Teutonic name of
Coburg (that was before the Great
War.) William McCulloch was like
David Mitchell, a very enterprising
and far-seeing Scot. When I first
knew him he was the controlling
power in the McCulloch Carrying
Co., and senior partner in the horse-
selling firm of McCulloch, Campbell
& Co., of Kirk’s Bazaar, in Bourke
street. Afterwards he launched
out as a Clydesdale horse and short-
horn cattle breeder, and had the
foresight to settle at “La Rose,”
within six miles of the G.P.0., as he
said 'the spread of the city would
soon push him out, but he would be
paid for it ; and, to be prepared for
the next extension, he only moved a
couple of miles further north, and
squatted at Glenroy, till the land
boom also made that place too
valuable to farm. His next move
was a still better financial proposi-
tion ; he got the offer of “Merton
Park,” at Colac. I don’t feel jus-
tified in broadcasting the price per
acre, but your readers will under-
stand that the price could not have
been too high, as he told the writer
that he decided that the property
was his while the agent, who drove
him to inspect, was shutting the en-
trance gate. Scon afterwards the
value of Colac land rose by leaps
and bounds, and when he considered
that it could not soar much higher,
he let someone else have it, and
purchased the “Woodlands Estate,”
at Crowlands, a portion of which the
family still retain.
Yqu may object that this is get-
ting a long way from 8.M., but I
noticed, a few issues back, that you
styled these jottings as “history,”
and I am trying to justify that dig-
nified title.
Now, to get nearer home, that


third message from you is an ack-
nowledgment from a lady, of the
pleasure she gets from being re-
minded of old names. She wonders
if she knows “Pyrette ?” I say to
her that she does know him very
well, under his assumed name, as
she and her husband were among
his valued friends, and more than
once he enjoyed a cup of tea under
their roof. I was going to say a
little more, but, on second thoughts,
better not, as it might lead to de-
tection.
Funny, sometimes what crops up
when you are thinking backwards.
I remember an old Chinaman (I
suppose he has passed out long ago)
who used to drive a bit of a tear-
away horse, which bolted with him
somewhere about Lyle’s Creek one
day, and Harry jumped out and let
the horse bolt to his heart’s content,
and when the lads twitted the old
fellow for jumping out, he replied,
“Plenty more horse —no more
Harry ! ” But the detection of
“Pyrette” would be a greatei
calamity,—as there would be no
more “Recollections.”
As I have had occasion to refer
to the ladies taking some interest in
these notes in the past few issues,
there is one old friend that I often
think of, and look back on as one
that it has been my privilege to
number among my old Marsh
friends, and will not attempt to
enumerate the number of times that
I just dropped in, on an afternoon
or evening, to always find her in
the same mood —ever ready to help
the sick or the needy, and with a
soft word for an erring one. Those
who had the privilege of knowing
her, as I did, will understand that I
am just writing what I feel, when
they learn that I am referring to
old Mrs. Anderson, who left behind
her many years and a plentitude of
kind deeds. Would that there were
many to emulate her, as such are
sadly needed in these days of too
much frivolity and pleasure. An-
other very charitable woman was
Mrs. Tom Cain, but as she lived
further out, fewer people knew all
the good work that was hers, but I
had the privilege of being acquainted
with a good deal of her most un-
ostentatious charity. Of course, I
know that there were many other
women who “did their bit” in the
old spot, but in my memory those
two are the most impressed.
I didn’t mention before that I
noticed on my visit to the old town
that there was more accommodation
at the police station than formerly.
I do not suppose that many of your
present residents remember the
time when Sgt. Kiernan was in
charge there, with Pat. Keefe as
Mounted-constable (because I do
not!), but I remember Senior-cons-
table Bradley, who was succeeded by
John Rogers, who saw that all the
lads who were too young to grow
whiskers were off the streets early
in the evenings, and if they showed
any hesitation to obey, he assisted
them off with his blackthorn. He
did not have much trouble because
they soon learned that when John
said “Go,” it was law. If he was in
charge there now, I fancy he would
distinguish those who had to go
home or the street would be de-
serted in the evenings. As well as
being a most efficient officer, he and
his genial wife were first-class citi-
zens, of a cheery disposition. He,
in turn, was succeeded by Senior-
constable Tom Graham, who was
also a very good man on the job,
but he and his partner were of a
more retiring disposition than their
predecessors. Mrs. Graham was
one of the few women who did not
have to change her name when she
took Tom Graham “for better or for
worse,” as she was a daughter of
George Graham, one of Melton’s
pioneers. I cannot remember who
you got after Tom Graham. I know
you have had several changes since
then. I asked our young Myrniong
friend who was in charge of the
Marsh station now, and was in-
formed that it was one of “the
Kelly gang,” but did not know
whether to take him in earnest or
not, so left it at that.
I saw in “The Argus” the other
day some government notice re
Francis Timmons, deceased. I sup-
pose that relates to poor old Frank,
who used to hawk drapery when the
writer considered himself only a
boy, so Frank must have been a very
old man when he got the final
call. When Harry Salter left the


little old shop at the top of the
Main street, to go into Jerry Ryan’s
two-story shop further down, Frank
installed himself in the former, and
became very prosperous, as he made
a big turnover with very little ex-
penses, as he lived alone and did
not have any wages to pay. After
some time at the business, the old
man became unsettled, and got it
into his head that he could do far
better if he were on the land, and
at times used to amuse the writer
with the imaginative profits that he
could make if he were so situated.
At length he sold out the drapery
businesss and purchased a farm at
Myrniong, where he soon learned
that it was much easier to coin
money in fancy than in practice on
the soil ; and, to piake matters
worse, several ventures that the
poor old man had invested in went
bung, and, I am sorry to say, left
him on the uppers in his old age.
Frank always kept a nice hack, and
used to enjoy a canter in the long
evenings and on holidays. One
afternoon, as I was returning from
a ride to Greendale, I met Joe
Nagle and Frank along the Mt.
Blackwood road, and Joe suggested
taking a short cut home over the
Bald Hill, to which I agreed, and
all went well until we came to the
summit of the hill, when we found,
for the first time in my experience,
that the gate across the road was
locked, and that the old fence had
been straightened up and the rails
made fast. It did not present much
difficulty to me, as I knew that
“Toprail” would not leave me an-
chored, but Joe was riding a little
Ashbourne pony, which, he rightly
said, could not be expected to carry
his weight over the obstacle. He
asked me to give the lead over, as
it might encourage the other two to
follow on the rein, after the riders
had dismounted. Joe had no
trouble with his pony, as she fol-
lowed him like a cat, as soon as he
asked her; but Timmons’ nice little
mare, that he had just recently
bought from Jack Cunningham,
would not make an attempt. He
then mounted her, and sent her at
it with no better result —she abso-
lutely refused to be ridden or led
over, and as the sun was getting
low, it looked like a case of jump-
ing back again and go right back,
about five miles, to where we left
the road, as it would have been
rather mean to let Frank go around
on his own. However, Joe made
another suggestion, that I should
mount her and give her a go. It
did not appeal to me as much of a
proposition, after seeing the deter-
mined way that she had baulked.
However, I took it on, and told
them to take the other two steeds
away down the road, as it occurred
to me that the little mare, being a
young one, would become anxious
to follow the others as she saw them
getting away from her. The
move had the desired effect, and
when I felt that she was sufficiently
worked up, I took her back for a
short run at it, and we landed on
tire Bacchus Marsh side of the fence
with no worse result than that the
third rail of somebody’s fence fell
divided. Most of the hacks of those
days would take you across country.
Among those down our way, Steve
Shea (Deep Creek) had a little
black mare that would not leave
you stranded in a paddock if the
gate happened to be locked. When
I get on to the gee-gees I find it
difficult to ring off, so must relate
another incident before doing so.
A number of visiting clergymen
were the guests of Tom Cain, and
he decided to treat them to a bit of
sport. Being an Irishman, he knew
that all from the land whence he
came were fond of the chase, and
arranged for some hare hunting, out
beyond Parwan. I happened to be
in the town in the morning as they
passed through, and was invited to
join, and did not require any press-
ing to fall in. There were quite a
goodly number mounted for the
fray, and out where the pile bridge
now stands (it was not there then)
we picked up John Connell, senior
and junior, also Tom, and, follow-
ing the road running south up Cum-
ming’s hill, we met Charlie Gum-
ming at the boundary of his
paddock. He also was invited to
fall in, but declined, as he said he
was not prepared to take any risks
that would endanger him leaving a
young widow, but told us that he
could lay us on to a good hare, that


would give our hounds something
to dp, and was as good as his word,
as just about the middle of his pad-
dock he disturbed puss. I think I
had better mention those that I can
remember taking part, lest I should
forget them in the excitement of the
run: Rev. D. McGillicuddy (Echuca)
on Tom Cain’s big hunter, “Horrid,”
by “Horror,” Father Gough (Day-
lesford) on Johnnie Connell’s
brown stallion (I think the name
was “Bryan O’Lyn,” and I mustn’t
omit to mention that he was a de-
cendant of “Panic”); Bud McKay
on “Reuben;” Martin Cain on
“Black Bess”; Johnnie Connell on
biculored horse —not quite dun and
white, but that is as near as I can
get to the color; Jim Robinson and
Jack Kiely were there also, but I
cannot remember their mounts.
There were a few of the younger
fry out also, some of them may re-
call those that I cannot. Hunting
on wheels were a few clergymen,
whom I did not know. I was only
interested in those made of sterner
stuff. Tom Cain had his favorite
buggy horse, “Charlie,” that he
nought from l oin McCinny, . when
he took over the Royal hotel; and
John Connell had his trotting horse,
“Willie,” in the shafts of his piano
box; and there were a few others
that I cannot recall.
Now for the run ! After giving
the hare a generous start, Pat Mac-
Grath slipped the dogs, and the pace
was a cracker from the start. After
going into Bowden’s, at the south
of Cumming’s paddock, the hare
turned east, across Cumming’s road,
then north to the road on the
southern boundary of McCrae’s
paddock, where the run finished,
and the horses and dogs were given
a blow. This first run was over
easy country, and none of the fences
were very high. When time was up,
we made another move, and no-
body’s patience was tried before
another hare was sighted, and Pat
McGrath was even more generous to
this one than to the first, as it was
almost out of sight before he re-
leased the dogs. The first hare was
a good one, but this was a better,
and for some time the hounds did
not gain a scrap on her. As in the
first run, the early part of this one
was over part of the same country—
nothing formidable presenting itself,
until we came to John Connell’s
paddock, on the Geelong road, where
a fairly big three-railer was en-
countered. I don’t usually meet
trouble, but I must confess that I
felt a bit anxious lest some of the
inexperienced jumpers would make
a mistake at this fence, as the pace
was now fast and furious, following
a pack of stag or foxhounds was a
fool to it. Following the lead of
Dr. McGillicuddy, everyone got
safely over. I suppose that jumping
the smaller fences gave both horses
and riders confidence. After going
a' few chains across this paddock,
puss made for the Geelong road,
which she ran down for a short
stretch, and then turned east, under
a great big fence of four boxwood
rails, fitted into round posts (it
looked terribly big that morning)
and I did not know what was going
to happen, and was relieved when I
saw Johnnie pull off— and felt that
it was no disgrace to do likewise,:
and everyone followed suit, with the
exception of Dr. McGillicuddy, who
negotiated “Jumbo” safely, and had
the run to himself for a few
moments, when puss wheeled north,
into the adjoining paddock, which
was bounded on the roadside by a
wire fence, but obligingly had a
strip, about a chain wide, of brush
fence, just at the southern boundary
and we all plucked up courage
again, and in about a minute, after
jumping this obstacle, our second
chase terminated. It is well that I
mentioned the hunters before de-
scribing the chases, or I may have
overlooked more, as I notice that I
missed “Pyrette” on “Toprail.” As
all were satisfied that horses and
dogs had done a fair thing for the
day, and after doing justice to the
contents of a well-filled hamper,
packed by Mrs. Cain, we wended
our way back to Bacchus Marsh.
The only disappointment was that
big fence of Staughton’s (I know it
was Staughton’s by the big posts)
obtruding itself just at the end of
the meet; otherwise, we could have
told our friends that we did not
turn tail to anything during the
runs. I suppose that big fence is
there still, as it looked everlasting,


but I daresay some of the toprails
may look more inviting to take
liberties with than on that day, as,
by next Easter, it will have given
50 years’ more service.
When I commenced these jottings,
I intended to take your readers as
far as Myrniong, as I used to attend
the shows there in the seventies, and
then ring off, but have not got there
yet ! I was nearly overlooking the
latter part of your last message to
me, about some of the old residents
being disappointed at not being
mentioned. Kindly tell any such
that feel aggrieved to send their
names to “The Express,” and when
you publish them, “Pyrette” will
give them a rub-up, or rub-down,
according to their merits.
I was inclined to give your rea-
ders a bit of a spell lest they should
be getting tired of “Recollections,”
amid all the election excitement,
which your people will be experi-
encing, but I struck a bit of a gem
yesterday, which is too good to
keep. As I was passing through
Melbourne —I had a couple of hours
to put in, and took a run out to
Newmarket saleyards, and on the
return trip was accompanied by two
Bacchus Marsh young men, one of
whom knew that “Pyrette” was a
local syndicate, the principal of
which was known to him, and he
was on the track of the others,
whose names he would be in a
position to make known very soon !
Those young men must have grown
to manhood since my time, as I
could not place them, but I felt
relieved to learn that “Pyrette” had
not been run to earth just yet. I
hope this young man is not super-
stitious, because if he is, he will
consider yesterday his bad day out.
When 1 went across the street to
the Australian Hotel, to pick up a
friend, I found that those two fol-
lowed also; the spokesman went to
the ’phone, and, after getting his
number, asked for “a box for two,”
but, as the instrument did not have
a loud-speaker installed, I do not
know what the answer was, but it
did not appear to please the in-
quirer, as he replied that he did not
want Apps, the undertaker —he
wanted the Capitol Theatre ! If
this young man doesn’t mind telling
a joke against himself he may give
it out at the A.N.A., meeting.
If any of your young folk read
these “Recollections,” they may in-
fer that there is only one way of
ingress to the city, from Bacchus
Marsh, as I only mentioned that via
Keilor and Essendon previously. As
all the older ones know, there is
also the one branching off at the
Melton creek, via Footscray, which
was the road for all live-stock going
to Newmarket, before there was a
train to the Marsh. Those travel-
ling cattle to Newmarket usually
got as far as Braybrook the first
day, where John Connell had a
handy paddock for the accommoda-
tion of his market stock, but it was
also free to all his neighbors, for
the asking and going for the key.
The only hotel there was kept by
Tom Derham, whom the writer used
to look on as a “hard case,” but the
outside was the worst, as when you
came to know him well you found
he had many good points, and must
have been the Lord Mayor of Bray-
brook, as, in addition to the hotel,
he was a large land-holder, and In-
dian horse trader, and a big cattle
dealer, butcher, &c. A couple of his
sons followed on in the Indian trade.
If we wanted to be closer to the
city, we sometimes put up at W. H.
Powell’s hotel, at Footscray, which
always reminded me of Harvie’s, on
the other road, as one was made to
feel at home among their family. 1
can only recall the three elder ones
—the daughter, Jessie, became Mrs.
Stratford Nettle, and the eldest
son, Noble, became a clerk for his
brother-in law, and Gus. went into
the Indian horse trade. Later on,
Noble took to wielding the hammer,
and is about at the top of the tree
in his department, at the Corpora-
tion Yards, as I heard him selling a
couple of years ago, when I took a
run up to those yards for a short
while ; and, after watching Noble
selling for a little time, came to the
conclusion that he would go down
our way. When he finished, Bob
Gunn came on ; he was the first
auctioneer that I ever knew to de-
cry his own capabilities, but after
repeating two or three times that
some of those finished auctioneers
could do better than he, he battled


away and appeared to get there al-
right. I then had a look at the ring
where the store cattle are sold, and
there found a young man in the box,
worked up into a state of excite-
ment as extreme as any that I had
previously noted at Newmarket, and
on inquiring from a bystander who
he was, learned that he was Noble’s
first assistant. It did not strike me
at the time, as at that time I had
not heard of it, but since then I
have read of a battery being applied
to horses in a race, and have been
wondering if Noble had applied one
to his assistant on that occasion !
Bill Anderson was the next to come
on, and I was disappointed that
time would not permit my waiting,
to see how he shaped in the box,
but feel sure that he would keep hi,;
audience "up to it.”
I have just been reading in "The
Argus” that the residents of Ascot
Yale are quite excited that a matron
there has increased the population
by three, at one birth, and are going,
to give the lucky mother a gold
cradle, or a monetary testimonial.
Bacchus Marsh had that distinction
over half-a-hundred years ago, when
Mrs. Ned Lynch presented her hus-
band with triplet sons, but the local
residents made no fuss over the
event, and appeared to think that it
was only the business of Mr. and
Mrs. Lynch.
Bacchus Marsh had another dis-
tinction, previous to that, in having,
among the population a bushranger
in the making, but I won’t tell you
about him, as I do not like writing
about people who are not so good
as they appear. As he was a lay
reader at Holy Trinity Church, we
all thought he was a model young
man. One night, after addressing
his hearers on how they should deal
with everyone as all wish to be dealt
by, he must have taken counsel with
that old fellow who tempted Eve a
very long time ago. He knew a
bank which held a goodly sum of
money, but as it was in so many
small accounts the money was not
much good to anyone in particular,
and he conceived the idea that, if it
were all in one bag, it would be
better (for him). So, in the very
small hours of the next morning, ho
took delivery of the sundry cash in
the Egerton bank, so you can see
the reason why I would not write
about "Captain Moonlite.” He
could not have been a decentralisa-
tionist —that is one for Christadel-
phia when she comes home from the
High School in the afternoon. I
could never understand why some
mothers give their little girls those
long names. If they cannot choose
nice short ones, they ought to imi-
tate the Dicksons and Vallences, and
stick to patronymics.
I suppose the old town will bo
worked up to something like old-
time excitement over the coming
election, as all have to record their
vote, or pay up ; and they have not
the old-time satisfaction of giving'
a good rub-out to those not of their
choice. This reminds me of an in-
cident of a good while ago, when
there was an election for Shire
Auditor (since done away with) the
candidates were : Anderson, George
Watt ; and Gordon, James. An old
man named Sandie Hardie walked
all the way in from the toot of the
ranges (Jim Kerr has the farm now)
to vote for George Anderson. I was
going into the booth just as he was
coming out, and, with a smile of
satisfaction, he told me that when he
saw the name of that man, "Watt,”
whom he did not like, he gave the
'name a good scratch out ! So, you
see, that if George Anderson did not
have so many names his majority on
that day would have been increased
by one !
I saw by the list of nominations
that you have four runners for
Grant. I expect all the Marsh and
his aunt will be going for their local
member. We can beat you by one,
as we have five candidates down
here, and all the electors around
here are going for our local man. I
think the majority of folk about
here are like "Pyrette,” not very
strong on politics, but reckon that
they would receive more considera-
tion if they had one living in their
midst to represent them in the
"talking house.” Our man should
have a bit of grit in him, as he is
a grandson of the wild white man,
whom I suppose all of your readers
have read of, as 1 know they read
the history of their country. One
reason why we are anxious to have


him elected is that we are putting
in a claim to have a High School
established in this locality, to give
the way back youngsters an oppor-
tunity of competing with those in
more populous centres. Besides
learning Algebra and Euclid, they
will be taught to express themselves
correctly, without recourse to big
words. That is why we are anxious
that the argumentations promulgated
by our deputation that will approach
the Minister will appear so incon-
trovertible that there will be no
hesitation or procrastination on his
part in acceding to our request. We
consider that, if our local man gets
the opportunity of introducing the
deputation, he will put more vim
into the business than one just
doing so as a matter of form.
I noted in “The Argus” recently
that the Minister for Education is
also opposed to big, long words, as
I read where a large number of
“sweet young things” invaded his
office. They made him feel in a
peculiar mood, but he did not make
use of that big word, but invented
one of only a syllable and a half ;
and, strange to say, the “S.Y.T.’s”
did not grasp the meaning of that
little word, but accused the genial
Minister of swearing at them ! They
must have made him momentarily
absent-minded, otherwise he would
just have laughed in his own inimi-
table way, when they would have
vacated his office in half of no time,
fully convinced that their chief had
gone “dilly.” It is well that he
coined that little word while he had
the opportunity, because,- if young
Ned Hogan attains his desire, Sir
Alick w T ill not have the chance of
doing so in the next Pariament. I
call him “young Ned” because he
was an unknown quantity in my
time, and must Inherit the ginger
that is in his constitution from the
maternal side of his ancestry, as
“old John” is too easy-going and
good-natured to try to put Sir Alick
oi' anyone else, out of a good billet.
Ever since I have been on these
jottings I have been trying to get
up Myrniong way, and will enlist
the assistance of that Myrniong
youth, whom I will call Jack, as I
think there are more Jacks than
any other name. I remarked to him
that Tom Low’s farm did not look
so natty as in the old days. He told
us that it was occupied by two old
bachelors, who did not work, as they
had plenty of cash, and were only
waiting a chance to sell out and re-
tire. The little farm on the oppo-
site side of the road, where the
Cane’s used to live, appears just the
opposite to Low’s, as it has been
changed from a bare-looking spot
into quite a cosy-looking little home.
One would almost think that Joe
Lodge must live there, but Jack in-
formed us that the occupier’s name
is Condon, so I suppose he is a son
of John Condon, who used to live
at the foot of the hill, just east of
the railway station. Jack was sur-
prised to learn that we did not con-
sider Lyle’s Creek hill steep, as down
our way it would only be a gentle
incline, and told him that your
local motorists would lose their
nerve if they had to drive up and
down our hills, but he protested that
the “covey” who drives the Myrni-
ong and Greendale mail motor would
think nothing of them, and he
undertook to show us, further along
the road, where this driver negoti-
ated an embankment ; and, sure
enough, he pointed out the spot
where he drove through the top
fence and anchored on the fence at
the bottom ! If this driver is al-
lotted to drive me round when I
go “Back to Bacchus Marsh ” I
trust that he will not attempt any
like stunt. It is well that Jack was
not inquisitive, as if so, he would
likely put “Pyrette” away. He ap-
peared glad to get the ride, as he
said it was better than waiting for
old Sam Webster, as there was no
knowing when he would come along.
I suppose the “Sam” he referred to
is a step-son of old Joe Johnston,
who lived at where I used to con-
sider “land’s end,” when I was
younger, until I once found myself
at Harry Morrison’s “Land of
Canaan,” which must have been the
limit. Harry was a bit of a charac-
ter and a bush lawyer. That bush
country was rich in legal gentry, as
only a few miles west was the
domicile of Humphrey Bloomfield,
who was another rich in legal lore.
Humphrey also liked a good horse,
and was the owner of one particu-


larly lively harness horse, and, if
any of your readers want any veri-
fication of this, let them ask
Johnnie Dugdale. I started on the
road to Myrniong, but here I am
right past, recollecting faster than
I can write. I tried writing with
both hands, but had to desist, as
the caligraphy would bog your lino-
typist.
Back on the main road, I find
that, after several changes of owner-
ship, Peter McCluskey’s “Rose Hill”
is now the property of John Dugdale.
In the old days, I often called in at
Peter’s ; and he and his good wife
were very hospitable, while they
were on the Hills, but later in life
ill-days seemed to mark his path.
Further on, Andrew Inglis’ farm,
where Bob Freame used to live, is
now in the hands of the Lidgett
family, who are famed as breeders
of Milking Shorthorns —some of
which have got down our way, as
also to most parts of the State,
Many a time I called there
in their father’s time, and generally
found him pretty tough while we
talked business, but once inside the
house, unlike the leopard he could
change his spots, and he and his life
partner made one feel at home. An-
other place that I often rode across
to was Willie Dunbar’s, whose good
lady was a sister of Mrs. Peter Mac-
Cluskey, and fully charged with the
same good nature. After her death,
the two daughters were excellent
hostesses. If I turned off at the
Church on the hill, I occasionally
called on Peter Grant, who lived on
the corner of the Greendale road, on
the property previously occupied by
his brother-in-law, Bob Johnstone,
and, if one’s appetite had left, Mrs.
Grant would place something before
one that would revive it. Peter was
also a very good host, only that he
had some grudge against the Marsh,
and seldom missed giving a dig
when the opportunity presented it-
self, particularly after the Marsh
folk filched (his word) the show
from Myrniong. Further on, Denis
Ryan’s home extended a right good
welcome to an old friend ; and, if
one called at the home on the west
of the road, one felt embarrassed
with kindness, but I will always re-
tain the pleasant memory of having
known one of Nature’s gentlewomen,
in old Mrs. Muir I trust your
readers will not infer that I used to
make all these calls in one day ; but
if one had occasion to go across to
the Mount, by the time you had left
Martin Deveny's, you likely would
have lost count of meal times for
the day ! I feel sure that, if one
called at any of the other home-
steads in that district, one would be
subjected to the same treatment,
but I am only mentioning those that
I knew best in those days. The
only unsatisfied appetites that I ever
knew in that quarter were among
the lads attending a boys’ school
there, about six decades ago, or
nearly so. There was some excuse
for same, as the matron in charge
of the boys’ dining room had not
been long enough from “the land
of brown heath and shaggy wood,
Land of the mountain and the flood’’
to have got a correct gauge of the
fuel consuming propensities of the
Australian youth in such an invigo-
rating clime as Mount Blackwood.
They thought that the butcher and
baker did not get a fair “divvy’’ out
of their school fees. One of them,
a fine strapping lad from St. Kilda,
enjoying the change used to declare
that their mascot, the poodle, would
fare badly if it had to depend on the
scraps from his plate. I hope Rill
Watson does not read “The Ex-
press,” lest he should inquire who
is “telling tales out of school,” but
I know he is too good-natured to
look for trouble.
One of those letters which you
forwarded to me was from a couple
of ladies, expressing their apprecia-
tion of tone of treatment of an
ancestor in “Recollections,” and the
other was from ray old friend, Mark
Kyle, to let me know how interested
he is in these jottings, and extend-
ing a very cordial invitation to his
and Mrs. Kyle’s hospitality at any
time that I should visit the old
place. I must say that I very much
appreciate those letters, as they are
some compensation for all this
thinking backward.
I got a bit of a shock on reading
the recent letter in “The Express,”
over the signature of “Subscriber,”
to find that the wrong man has been
writing “Recollections,” as “Sub-


scriber” can knock “Pyrette” kite-
high at recollecting-—but so he
ought to, as he must be much older
than “Pyrette,” as I remember read-
ing a letter over that name when I
was only a small boy. It was some-
thing about excavating a tunnel,
commencing at the foot of Anthony’s
Cutting, and coming out at Jim Mac-
Cullagh’s so as Jimmie Brown’s
team would not get stuck on the
hill, when carting Tommy Mason’s
barley to the malster ! I do not sup-
pose many of our readers have much
hope of seeing that project carried
out in this generation, and they have
just an equal chance of reading a
panegyric on school teachers by
“Pyrette,” as he never had much to
do with those gentry, as he did not
go much to school. I suppose this is
one reason why so many of your
readers find amusement in reading
his scrawlings. Had “Subscriber”
just put the question : “How old are
you?” I might have fallen into the
trap, but, reading all those names
gave me time to become suspicious.
I must thank “Subscriber” for the
ending portion of his letter, but I
regret that I cannot satisfy his re-
quest for scholastic history.
“PYRETTE.”

BACCHUS FAMILY HISTORY.
AS PUBLISHED IN THE “EXPRESS.”
Interest throughout Bacchus
Marsh district in the story of its
founder and his descendants has
probably never been greater than at
present. It is also true that more
has been heard of the Bacchus family
during the last two years than the
memory of old residents can recall.
In view of the obscurity which has
for so long shrouded the movements
of the Bacchus family and of the
recent developments arising from the
discovery that an old Sussex estate
is being held in Chancery awaiting
a claimant in the person of a Bac-
chus heir, it is intensely interesting
to again begin at the beginning of a
picturesque history having a local
connection.
Up till 19 32 written references to
the Bacchus family had, remarkably
enough, been scant in the annals of
Bacchus Marsh, mainly through the
inability of local scribes to trace the
descendants. It was through an in-
quiry by a lady named Sarah
Bacchus Thompson, who wrote from
Hermit Park, Townsville, Queens-
land, early in 19 32, that the where-
abouts of a great-grandson of the
late Captain Bacchus became known.
The lady’s endeavor to trace any
relatives of the late Captain, who
died on 2 6th February, 1849, came
under the notice of the Mayor of
Ballarat, and reference to the muni-
cipal rolls resulted in the “discovery”
of Mr. William Henry Bacchus, at
Buninyong, seven miles from Bal-
larat.
Mr. Bacchus, a slightly built man
of early middle age, and unmarried,
was then interviewed in June, 1932,
by a representative of “The Express.”
Mr. Bacchus claimed to be the only
surviving member of the pioneer
family associated with the founda-
tion of Bacchus Marsh district.
Early in the interview it was realiz-
ed that in Mr. Bacchus’ memory
alone lay all hope of gaining authen-,
tic historic information about his
ancestors, because of a series of un-
fortunate events which had combined
to wipe out all records of the Bacchus
family. Of these events, more will
be stated later. Fortunately, Mr.
Bacchus had delved deeply into his
family records while they were avail-
able, and his retentive memory sup-
plied dates, figures and names with-
out hesitation. Yet, unknown to
Mr. Bacchus or his interviewer at
the time, one omission made the
family history incomplete, for there
had existed a great-aunt of Mr. Bac-
chus named Eliza Bacchus, about
whom he had never heard, and the
tracing of whom has since become of
vital importance.
The Family History.
Mr. Bacchus at that interview re-
counted the following interesting
history of his family, which has been
pieced together as nearly as possible
in a chronological sequence, with a
few of Mr. Bacchus’ comments added.
The name Bacchus is of Norman
French origin, and was first spelled
“Bauhus,” the family records dat-
ing back as far as the 12 th century.
From earliest times the Bacchus
menfolk were all either soldiers or
sailors and it was not until the Aus-
tralian generation that the peaceful
life was adopted. In the Civil War
of 1649 the wealthy Bacchus family
were Royalists and the Bacchus men
fought for King Charles I. against
Oliver Cromwell. Two of the Bac-
chus fighting men of this era met the
same fate as their sovereign and
were executed for their loyalty by
Cromwell who also seized their large
estates, but on Charles 11. gaining the
throne the estates were restored to
the family.
Captain William Henry Bacchus,
born in 17 82, Captain of the Second
Surrey Militia (formerly Captain of
the 18th Light Dragoons) being a se


cond son and therefore not heir to
the Sussex estates, sailed for Aus-
tralia in 1831 to seek his fortune. He
took two sons with him and landed
in Tasmania. The younger son died
there of fever soon after arrival.
Five years later, in 1836, Captain
Bacchus and his son, William Henry
Bacchus, jun., came to Victoria,
bringing with them stud sheep.
After looking at several districts
they decided to take up land in the
valley which later became known as
“Bacchus’s Marsh,” as a grant from
the Crown made to the Captain in
recognition of his military service,
and “ticket-of-leave” convicts were
also assigned to him as workmen.
The Captain’s military service in-
cluded the Napoleonic Wars and the
Battle of The Nile. He had the
cavalryman’s love for good horses
and was the first man to import thor-
oughbred horses from the Old Coun-
try. His stallion, “Shylock” stood
at Bacchus Marsh for some years,
and previously in Tasmania. In 1845
Captain Bacchus built the Manor
House (then known as the “Mansion
House”) which still stands an impos-
ing building to-day. He was a great
gambler (his descendant says this
was always a family failing) and
speculated heavily in investments
which later proved bad ones. The
Captain enjoyed the gay life and
spent as much of his time at social
gatherings in Melbourne as he did
in Bacchus Marsh. He was a per-
sonal friend of Governor La Trobe
and both he and La Trobe lost a lot
of money betting on cock-fighting
which was a society hobby of that
period. The Captain himself organ-
ised cock-fights at Bacchus Marsh,
The heaviest blow dealt to his fin-
ances, however, was in the winter of
1842, which was exceptionally wet,
when he lost all his stud ew.®
througi. foct-rot, menno »ueep
proving an unsuitable type for the
damp Bacchus Marsh valley.
Captain Bacchus died at Bacchus
Marsh in 1849 at the age of 67
years and was buried in the grave-
yard of Holy Trinity Church —the
Church to which he had donated the
Church lands.
His personal belongings were
transferred to his son’s “Perewurr”
station at Millbrook (near Gordon)
and his Bacchus Marsh property was
cut up and sold in 1849. The high-
est price realised was 15/ per acre.
The eldest son of Captain Bacchus,
named William Henry Bacchus, was
born in England in 1820. After see-
ing his father established at Bacchus
Marsh he took over “Perewurr” sta-
tion, of 18,000 acres, at Millbrook
(between Wallace and Gordon) in
the Ballarat district. Here a ramb-
ling single storey homestead of 35
rooms was built, and Mr. Bacchus
reared a family of seven daughters
and two sons all of whom are now
deceased. His elder son was christen-
ed William Henry, the family name.
Mr. Bacchus stayed with his father,
Captain Bacchus, until the Captain’s
death, endeavoring to restore his
father’s finances, but without suc-
cess. The creek on the “Perewurr”
station is still known as “Bacchus’s
Creek” and boasts a picturesque
little waterfall. Mr. Bacchus paid a
deposit on the purchase price of some
land in Swanston Street in the early
days of Melbourne, but unfortunate-
ly for his descendants, did not pro-
ceed any further and let the transac-
tion lapse. He died at Millbrook in
1887, aged 67 —-reaching the same
age as had his father, Captain Bac-
chus, before him.
William Henry Bacchus (the
third), grandson of the original
Captain Bacchus, and father of Mr.
Bacchus, of Buninyong, was born at
“Perewurr” station and died a com-
paratively young man soon after the
beginning of the present century.
His family are also deceased, with
the exception of his eldest son, Mr.
William Henry Bacchus, who now re-
sides at Buninyong. Mr. Bacchus,
the third, had the fighting blood in
his veins and left Australia for eight
years to take part in the two Boer
Wars commencing 18 81 and in the
Zulu Rebellion of 1883. He too, at-
tained the rank of Captain. Besides
inheriting the soldiering urge, Mr.
Bacchus the third also had the gamb-
ling instinct, and (on the estimate
of his son) he lost £30,000 in three
years on the Ballarat Stock Ex-
change, most of its disappearing in
the notorious Mount Egerton gold
mine.
Mr. William Henry Bacchus, the
foiirth, of Buninyong, says that “Pe-


rewurr” station was subdivided and
sold gradually. In 1895, 1,000 acres
were sold. In 1908, 1,500 acres
were sold at £7 an acre. To-day the
land is worth £45 an acre. Mr.
Bacchus has been in Bacchus Marsh
several times, and his racehorses
ran at race-meetings here 2 0 years
ago. One of his horses was named
“Artillery Bill.” Mr. Bacchus has
roamed Australia, and at different
times has lived in New South Wales,
South Australia, Queensland and Nor-
thern Territory. He lived at Hor-
sham (Vic.) for a time but has now
settled at Buninyong.
Obliterating The Family.
Reference was made at the begin-
ning of this article to the series of
unfortunate events which have com-
bined to obliterate records of the
Bacchus family. Mr. Bacchus says
that when the “Perewurr” property
was sold all the family heir-looms
were taken to the home of his fa-
ther’s sister, Mrs. Greene, of Lake
Cowal station, Wyalong, New South
Wales. In 1914, members of the
household returned from a race meet-
ing to find the station homestead
burned to the ground. Fine old Eng-
lish silver brought out to Australia
by the original Captain Bacchus, his
uniform, sword, several hand-written
books of family records, photographs
and family albums, were all des-
troyed in the fire. Mrs. Greene died
four years ago. Her daughter is
living and is the wife of a doctor in
Colombo, Ceylon.
The second obliterating effect was
the destruction of the family grave-
yard on “Perewurr” station. Here
two generations of the Bacchus fam-
ily had been laid to rest in a fenced-
ol'f acre of ground, and the graves
were marked by tombstones and iron
railings. One of the first things the
new owners of “Perewurr” did was
to unceremoniously dismantle the
memorials and plough over the
graves to plant a crop of potatoes !
Mr. Bacchus, of Buninyong, being
unmarried, has no family to carry on
the name and strangely enough
branch of the family in England is
similarly situated. The original Cap-
tain Bacchus, it will be remembered,
came out to Australia leaving his
elder brother possessor of the large
estates in Sussex. Two male des-
cendants are understood to hold
large estates there still, but they are
both Roman Catholic priests and
therefore the English Bacchus family
is doomed to die out also.
One of these priests, Dean Bac-
chus, came out from Birmingham to
Australia towards the end of the
Great War as a chaplain on board a
troopship. Mr. D. C. McGrath,
M.H.R., was on board the ship and
Informed Mr. Bacchus, of Buninyong,
about his relative some time after,
Mr. Bacchus wrote to Birmingham,
but his letter was returned through
the dead letter office.
Asked how it happened that his
English cousins were of a different
religion, Mr. Bacchus said that it
was not until the family came to Aus-
tralia that they joined the Church of
England. Prior to that the family
had always been Roman Catholics.
The Discovery Of The Legacy.
Following the publication in “The
Express” of the interview with Mr.
Bacchus and of the information he
supplied, tracing the family’s move-
ments through four generations, that
gentleman suddenly became the
central figure in a maze of complica-
tions.
In July, 1932, two men motored
from Melbourne and claimed to be
second cousins to Mr. Bacchus, stat-
ing that their grandmother’s name
was Eliza Bacchus, the wife of a
sea-faring man. Mr. Bacchus had
never heard of the existence of a
sister of his grandfather, and he
therefore looked with suspicion upon
the two claimants of kinship. His
visitors told him some deliberate
untruths which only served to
strengthen his distrust. To his
knowledge, at that time, the original
Captain Bacchus had come to Aus-
tralia a widower, accompanied by
only one son, and no daughter was
known of.
Later a solicitor from Melbourne
interviewed Mr. Bacchus at Bunin-
yong, and, purporting to represent
the two former visitors, bombarded
Mr. Bacchus with questions regard-
ing his ancestry. Mr. Bacchus was
at once reticent, and has since dis-
covered that the legal man was out


on bail on a charge of embezzlement
at the time !
Mr. Bacchus was at a loss to un-
derstand the object these people had
in seeking to establish relationship
with him, until a few weeks later
another solicitor called on him. This
visitor had travelled all the way
from Queensland to bring Mr. Bac-
chus the news that there was a big
legacy in England only awaiting a
descendant of the original Captain
Bacchus to prove a title to it. The
solicitor undertook to negotiate for
the money if Mr. Bacchus would pay
him a half-share !
Mr. Bacchus, of course, refused to
enter into any such agreement but
this news made it clear why various
people were claiming relationship
with him. He at once consulted a
well-known K.C., and made enquiries
through the proper channels about
the legacy.
He found that there is actually a
legacy amounting to something like
ys 3,000, consisting mainly of pro-
perty in Sussex, held in Chancery in
England and originally bequeathed
over 9 0 years ago to Captain William
Henry Bacchus. Mr. Bacchus was
assured that if he could prove him-
self the legitimate great-grandson of
Captain Bacchus it would be a simple
matter to claim the money ; but that
if other people were to dispute his
claim, lengthy and expensive litiga-
tion would be involved.
And that is why Mr. Bacchus now
desires to clear up the mystery about
the obscure Eliza Bacchus, his great-
aunt, who, he has just discovered,
actually did exist in 1850. Proof of
the impossibility of her having left
any descendants would make his
right to the inheritance undisputed.
A woman at New Mile End (S.A.j,
was next to claim relationship, and in
a letter to Mr. Bacchus stated that
her mother was Eliza Bacchus. She
admitted knowledge of the legacy in
England.
The Parliamentary Librarian in
Adelaide also wrote to Mr. Bacchus
asking about his ancestry. Mr. Bac-
chus, replying, asked why the in-
formation was desired, but received
no satisfaction.
Search For Eliza Bacchus.
The first authentic information
Mr. Bacchus obtained regarding the
existence of a daughter of the first
Captain Bacchus was when he at-
tended a funeral of an uncle in
Melbourne in October, 19 32. Here
a distant relative assured him that
there was an Eliza Bacchus,
Mr. Bacchus spent two days
searching the Federal electoral rolls
dating from 1900 and found that he
was the only elector in Australia
bearing the name of Bacchus. He
went to the office of the Common-
wealth Statistician in Melbourne and
proved that only three Bacchus mar-
riages had ever been recorded in
Australia —his grandfather’s, his
his father's and his aunt’s.
There was no Eliza Bacchus buried
in the family vault at Ballarat, nor
in the private graveyard at “Pere-
wurr” station, Milibrook, where the
Bacchus family (.including the lady
in question) lived.
Mr. Bacchus travelled to Sydney
where a lady aged 86 years, an old
friend of the family, assured him
that Eliza Bacchus was still unmar-
ried at an advanced age. At Sydney
Mr. Bacchus saw the marriage certi-
ficate of his grandfather, with the
signature of Eliza Bacchus as a wit-
ness. The document was dated
1850, certifying to the wedding at
Bacchus Marsh, of William Henry
Bacchus, aged 37, of Milibrook, with
Mary Denton Hobler, aged 17, of
Parete. The second witness was
Alex McLeod, and the officiating
clergyman was Rev. Hall, of Bacchus
Marsh.
Proceeding to Rockhampton,
Queensland, Mr. Bacchus endeavored
to interview the lady who first in-
stituted enquiries for him, and who
evidently was aware of the existence
of the legacy, but he was unable to
locate her. He was fortunate enough,
however, to find that his cousin liv-
ing near Rockhampton had a diary
and scrap-book compiled by the late
George Hobler, J.P., who came to
Bacchus Marsh in 1842, where he
lived for some years. Mr, Bacchus
brought these documents with him to
Victoria to peruse carefully. They
were most valuable to him because
the Baccnus family records were all
destroyed in 1914 when his aunt’s
homestead was burned down at
Wyalong (N.S.W.). A thorough


perusal of the diary failed, however,
to throw any light on the mystery
surrounding the daughter of Captain
Bacchus.
Puzzled at the absence of informa-
tion about his great-aunt, also at the
knowledge of various widely separat-
ed people about the legacy while he
knew nothing of it, Mr. Bacchus then
ascertained that advertisements ap-
peared in Australian newspapers in
the seventies, eighties and nineties
wherein English relatives sought to
locate the Bacchus Colonists, but
strangely the messages missed their
objective.
The Latest Cine.
The search for information about
the late Eliza Bacchus still continues,
and a slender clue recently taken up
may lead to success. At least it ex-
plains the reason why her name was
permitted to fade out of the family
records. A second cousin of Mr.
Bacchus recalled having as a child
heard her mother, referring to the
Bacchus household at “Perewurr,”
briefly mnke a pronouncement to the
effect that "’poor Aunt Eliza be-
came so peculiar that she had to be
put in a home.” Thus it is now taken
for granted that Eliza Bacchus was,
for a time at least, of unsound mind.
Searches of the Lunacy records have
been made without avail, the pro-
bability of her having been placed
in the care of a private institution
adding to the difficulties of the
search. Enquiries made at Bacchus
Marsh have also proved abortive,
and at present an exhaustive search
is being made at the Statistician’s
office, Melbourne, in the remote hope
of unearthing some fresh informa-
tion.
REMARKABLE OVERSIGHT IX
SEARCH FOR NEWS OF ELIZA
BACCHUS.
In June, 1935, the attention of
“The Express” was drawn by a
Presbyterian lady to the fact that
on the south side of Holy Trinity
Church of England, Bacchus Marsh,
are two memorial windows of stain-
ed glass. Under one appears the
following : “Capt. William Henry
Bacchus. Born Aug. 12th, 1782.
Died Feb. 2 6th, 1849.” Adjacent on
the left the other window carries
the following epitaph : “Eliza Bac-
chus. Born June 23rd, 1828. Died
Dec. 6th, 18 72.” It is inexplicable
that the existence of the memorial
windows had escaped attention up
till that juncture. Mr. Bacchus, of
Buninyong, was at once apprised of
the information, which at least
proves that Eliza Bacchus died a
spinster. Up to the time this ad-
dendum was written it could not be
ascertained when or by whom the
memorial windows were installed or
donated. The windows were not
there when the church was opened
in June, 1877.
On being made acquainted with
the news of the memorial windows
Mr. W. H. Bacchus, of Buninyong,
replied on 19th June, 19 35, that he
was very much surprised by the in-
formation, which he was satisfied
would end the manoeuvres of one
branch of allegedly false claimants
to the legacy. Another mysterious
claimant was. however, making his
presence known. Mr. Bacchus goes
on to say : I may state that at last
I am in communication with the
family in England, also the Somer-
set House and the Law Department.
Some person out here has been
using my full name and correspond-
ing with a firm of solicitors and
others in England, and giving as my
address a town in the north-east
of Victoria. I do not know who it
is at present, but hope soon to find
out. A Colonel William R, Bacchus
in England is very interested in
Bacchus Marsh and has asked me
all about it. A Walter Henry Bac-
chus, wdio is 84, also is looking into
the legacy matter for me. He is
searching through some boxes of
very old letters, some of which he
thinks may have been written by
the Captain. If so, he will send
them to me.


Some Early History of Mount Blackwood
(By ROBT LIDGETT.
April, 1936).
Anyone travelling leisurely along
the road that branches from the
Western Highway at the Pentland
Hills Church with the intention of
viewing the panoramic picture ob-
tained from the summit of Mount
Blackwood will notice on the sou-
thern slopes and foothills leading
thereto a number of small clumps of
pines and foundations of buildings.
These mark the several sites where
the first operations of the original
settlers began some 80 odd years
ago ; and whore the untiring efforts
and indomitable spirits of individual
families succeeded in rescuing the
country from the grip of wild
nature, and eventually transforming
it into comfortable farms with
homes and surroundings in keeping
.with the time and traditions of the
past.
It is a far cry to those vivid days,
when the fight to subdue nature’s
wild and whimsical ways tested the
physical strength and endurance of
the pioneers, when toiling daily
from sunrise to sunset at times
weakened the strongest resolutions.
And when spirits began to fail and
falter, adventure and romance
would suddenly appear and hearten
them along the road that pointed
gaily to the goal of success. All
those fine old pioneers—to whom
the present generation owe so much
—have long since gone to their rest,
and most of their descendants have
passed to further and perhaps more
favoured fields. But the ever-green
clumps of pines we see to-day may
be regarded as monuments to perpet-
uate their memories, the preserva-
tion of which should be a sacred
and solemn duty for those who may
follow after.
Geographically, the area is in-
tensely interesting, for there is
ample evidence for believing that
Mount Blackwood was, in other ages,
an active volcano, to which the rich
land on the Pentland Hills is due.
There is also evidence for believing
that the last flow of lava escaped
from a vent on the southern side,
and emptied itself into a valley or
deep ravine running south as far as
the site of the Presbyterian Church,
where a 'Tip” marks its destination.
Later this hardened into what is
termed the newer basalt, and form-
ed a ridge or saddle, along which
the Blackwood road has been built,
and which is skirted on either side
with the Myrniong and Korkuperri-
mul Creeks. The soil on the upper
southern slope of the Mount is of
excellent quality—selling as high as
£2O per acre half a century ago •
and quite a contrast to the surface
structure of the opposite side, which
is almost unproductive, and conse-
quently finds no place in this article.
The grazing and agricultural area
of Mount Blackwood is not more
than a few hundred acres in extent,
yet, in the early settlement days,
when the sickle and the scythe were
the only instruments available to
cope with the yields of virgin soil, it
furnished an existence for a popula-
tion of some 200 souls. To-day, the
families residing thereon can be
counted on the fingers of one hand.
This is the pathetic side of the pic-
ture as seen to-day. It was, how-
ever, inevitable that this exodus
should occur, for the holdings when
finally cleared and put to their best
use proved far and away too meagre
for the needs of growing families,
and as there was no room for
further expansion the settlers’ at-
tention was directed to the wide
open spaces of the Mallee and Wim-
mera, from whither reports had
come of waving wheat fields yel-
lowing into golden grain and even-
tually golden sovereigns, and which
later lured them away. At that
period there was no congestion of
population in the wheat-growing


areas, and as there were almost un-
limited possibilities for expansion,
the exodus had everything to re-
commend it.
As one casually casts an eye over
the area around Mount Blackwood
it is difficult to conceive that all the
land north of Pattinson’s lane, as
well as much on the south, was tim-
bered with a species of white gum,
the removal of which was a slow
process, as there were no "forest
devils,” Trewhella jacks or other
modern appliances to tackle and
speed up the job. It was regarded
as winter work, when the ground
was soft, and accomplished with
the use of an axe, shovel and pick.
When a few acres were cleared the
land was immediately brought under
the plough, and as the soil contain-
ed the essential constituents for
cereal production, excellent yields
wore obtained for some years. Later,
however, it was found that the cul-
tivation land on the lower levels
was apt to become water-logged in
the winter, due to the removal of
the timber which previously trans-
formed much of the moisture into
sap and green leaves. A system of
water-furrowing gave much relief,
but had to be abandoned to permit
of the free use of the reaper and
binder and more modern machinery.
In those days ploughing the
ground in half-chain lands with an
even number of furrows on either
side of the crown, was an art in it-
self, and public matches were held
annually to educate those engaged
in the industry. Implement makers
were deeply interested in the events
also, for a prize won by using a
Lennon, McCalman & Garde, Mit-
chell, or some other make of plough
was a much-valued advertisement
for the successful firm. Even
harness makers came into the pic-
ture by giving a prize for the team
yoked in the best set of harness
made by an individual firm. In all
the sections there was the keenest
rivalry, and the winning of the
coveted prizes never failed to leave
in tlieir train that pride and satis-
faction which is part and parcel of
the successful man’s make-up.
Engaged in mass production, the
ploughman of to-day, with drills,
cultivators and harvesters, &c.. to
assist him, gives no place in his
thoughts to tile old methods and
implements, unless he should hap-
pen to stumble over one of the old
ploughs lying half buried in his
back yard. And tnen, perhaps, it
would be in language unprintable !
But those old ploughs and the men
who used them were champions in
their time, and did much to make
this country what it is to-day. Time
has taken its toll of those old match
winners, prominent among them be-
ing Messrs. C. Baker (winner of
over 30 prizes), T. Shanahan, J.
Lodge, J. Scott, and J. Watson —and
as far as can be gathered only
Messrs. M, Muir, of Bacchus Marsh;
Joseph Graham, of Werribee ; J.
Thompson of Kyneton ; and G.
Nolan, of Riddell ; are left.
Lack of reliable data makes it
difficult to arrive at a satisfactory
conclusion as to when settlement
first began in the Mount district ;
but it is almost certain that it fol-
lowed that of the less timbered
land of the Pentland Hills, which
took place in 1838. Kenneth Clarke,
Peter Inglis and the McLaughlans
were amongst the first of the "Hills”
settlers, most of whom were of
Scottish birth, and probably were
lured there because the Hills were
supposed to have some resemblance
to the “Hielands of Scotland.” It is
recorded that Kenneth Clarke, who
arrived at Bacchus Marsh in 1836
with sheep from Tasmania, moved
up into the Mount Blackwood-
Pentland Hills area in 183 8, vacat-
ing the basin in favor of Captain
Bacchus and his son. Severe losses
were suffered later by the Bacchus’s
through footrot in their flocks ;
which explains why Clarke moved on
to the hill country. In the
forties Mount Blackwood was
known as Clarke’s Big Hill. For
some reason land settlement north
of Pattinson’s Lane was temporarily
delayed, but was resumed because
of a petition lodged by Mr. James
Cowan, who at the time was living
in the Lerderderg Valley, whore his
only son John (now of Myrniong)
was born. Cowan, senior, wanted
the Surveyor-General to open a cer-
tain road near Messrs. Kerr Bros


with the view of giving him an im-
proved outlet. When the question
of further settlement around Myrn-
long was discussed, Mr. Cowan
was told that if he presented a peti-
tion signed by seven persons requir-
ing land it would bo made available.
This was done and 2000 acres were
immediately taken up north of Pat-
tinson’s Lane. That would be some-
where about the year 185 4.
It therefore seems probable
that settlement along the Black-
wood road began about the
middle of the century, when the
Melbourne residents were publicly
rejoicing because separation from
New South Wales was achieved. At
any rate, in 185 3, Mr. Robert John-
son bought “Oaklands,” and Mr.
John Myers “Cairn Bank,” and the
following year the former acquired
“Uplands,” when practically all the
land north of Pattinson’s Lane was
taken up. Johnson left “Oaklands”
to his son William, who became a
prominent breeder of Clydesdales
The sire, “Stanley” had many
Tussles in the show ring with Mr. L
Dugdale’s “Tasman.” One of the
features of the property was a
vineyard of several acres, but it was
not a paying proposition. Johnson
left “Uplands” to his second son,
Robert, who later married a daugh-
ter of Mr. Janies Muir, of “Lands-
bsrg Mains” and whose youngest
son now holds a prominent position
in the Department of Agriculture
“Uplands” (now owned by Mr. T
O’Connor) changed hands on
several occasions, and at one time
was occupied by Mr. P. Cain, an
uncle of Mr. John Cain, M.L.A
(Deputy leader of the State Labor
Party and a prospective Premier)
Cr. Peter Grant, who married a
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. Muir,
also lived at “Uplands” for many
years, working the property in con
junction with the “Long Point”
estate now occupied by Messrs. W
Morton and R. Lidgett, and which
was part of the old McLaughlan
estate. The latter property,
which was infested with rab-
bits, was purchased for about £4
per acre half a century ago, but it
trebled itself in value once the
post was eradicated. Mr, Grant
occupied many public positions, was
a sound judge of stock, and ever-
ready to give advice to others less
capable. He died while drawing
water for stock from an under-
ground well. One of his daughters
is Mrs. H. Lidgott, of Pentland
Hills.
Mrs. Janies Muir was a sister of
Mr. Robert Lawson, M.A., who pur-
chased a block on the slope of tho
Mount in the 1854 period, and later
built “Landsberg House”—-a two-
storey structure of bluestone quar-
ried on the property. Lawson had
come to Melbourne from Scotland in
1851 to officiate as Principal of
Scotch College—a new educational
establishment —and there he laid the
foundations on which has been
built one of the greatest public
schools in the Commonwealth. For
five years he laboured zealously for
the welfare of the school, when his
successful work was checked by a
report from a Hamilton parent that
“lack of discipline gave the young
students an excess of freedom cal-
culated to undermine their moral
make-up.” An investigation—like
so many school enquiries since—•
proved gross misrepresentation, and
Lawson’s honor was sustained. His
fair and naturally sensitive mind,
however, was so hurt that he later
decided to resign and found a school
of his own at Mount Blackwood on
the property which he had previ-
ously acquired. Lawson’s high
ideals and fine qualifications made
the venture a big success ; for stu-
dents came from all parts of the
State, who found the peaceful sur-
roundings quite the reverse from the
influence of the “madding
crowd” when preparing for the an-
nual examinations. Lawson’s school
remained active for some 10 years,
when it was temporarily closed
while he paid a visit to Scotland,
but unfortunately he died on board
the “Great Britain” on the return
voyage. A present-day resident of
Main street, Bacchus Marsh, is the
sou of a former student, who creat-
ed a sensation at the school by tying
sheets together and escaping from
the top storey. In 1870, Mr. T. C.
Fraser, M.A., took charge of the
school, which eventually was closed


and the property sold. Later it was
acquired by Mr. George Muir—a
nephew of Mr. Lawson’s —who de-
molished the old historic building
and transported it and the name to
Bacchus Marsh. The property on
which the school was built is now
owned by Mr. Jas. Lidgett. Law-
son gave fine services as secretary
when the Presbyterian Church was
erected and altogether played a
most important part in solving the
many complex problems associated
with the early development of the
whole district.
About a quarter of a mile from
“Landsberg,” on the opposite side of
the road, another little school was
conducted by a Mrs. Chenu; and
later Mr. O’Farrell had charge.
More recently a Catholic school was
erected on the back lane north of
“Landsberg Mains” and on the
south the present Korobeit school
came into existence.
The maximum attendance at these
several schools in those far-off days
ran well into three figures, whereas
to-day the full numbers attending
-—-with Myrniong school thrown in
—are only 25.
Half a mile south of “Landsberg
House” Mr. John Drury built a pub-
lic-house and general store, which
was a popular half-way house be-
tween Bacchus Marsh and Black-
wood diggings. It was delicensed
2 9 years ago and later was destroy-
ed by fire. It would seem as though
there were thoughts of establishing
a township thereabout, as quite a
number of 10-acre and 20-acre
blocks were taken up ; which,
from a farming point of view, gave
no hope for a remunerative living.
If such an idea ever existed, it
perished when the diggings faded
out.
On one of these small holdings a
carrier named “Tommy” Beasley
lived for many years, and one of his
sons is now a prominent Labour
member in the Federal Parliament.
Perhaps the most successful settler
was Mr. Martin Deveny, whose
youngest son now holds the original
holding; together with practically
all the smaller blocks already referr-
ed to. The Deveny family also ac-
quired Archie Brown’s property
north of Cowan’s Lane, which pre-
viously belonged to Fitzgeralds; and
to-day are regarded as one of the
most prosperous and progressive
families in the district. The eldest
son, Patrick, died recently—details
of his life being duly chronicled in
“The Express” at the time. Like
the Muir family, the Devenys owe
much of their success to steady in-
dustrious habits, and by minding no
one’s business but their own. The
district is all the better for them
being in it, and the State to-day is
urgently in need of many others
like them.
Mr. Geoffrey Purcell and his
sister are amongst the few who
occupy the original holdings of their
parents and whose genial disposi-
tions make them worthy successors.
Their brother, Phillip, gave much
service to the public, and represent-
ed the Pentland Hills Riding in
Bacchus Marsh Shire Council for
the better part of 40 years. The
latter married a member of the Pat-
tinson family, which held a promin-
ent place in the community in those
far-off days. They had some fine
Clydesdales and were excellent
ploughmen. Pattinson’s Lane was
named after them. Throe daughters
and the youngest son are living at
Bacchus Marsh, the .former being
the wives of well-to-do farmers.
Sandy Rennie lived at “Strange-
more,” now owned by Mrs. J. Nolan,
and his daughter married Willie
Smith, a great groom and lover of
draught stock. A grandson is now
a successful suburban floriculturist.
Others who lived in the district were
Harry Morrison (who was found
dead in his bed) J. and M. O’Con-
nor, R. Wilkie, P. Murphy, J. Shine,
J. Gorman, A. Fowler, J. Murdock
and H. Roberts, all of whom were
more or less associated with the
ups and downs so common to the lot
of the average settler, in those
stirring and romantic times.
One of the old land-marks seen
from the Blackwood Road is the
flourmill on the Myrniong Creek —
a freestone structure of several
storeys, erected by Mr. J. Thomas in
the early fifties, and which handled
lire wheat grown for many miles
around. There was a great demand


for flour at the Blackwood Diggings
and other consignments found their
way to New Zealand, Melbourne and
Ballarat. Rust in the wheat crops
disheartened many settlers and later
the mill closed down. A portion
still stands as a reminder of what
once was, but is no longer. It was
at the old mill in 1859 that the first
meeting of those interested was held
to raise funds for the erection of
the Presbyterian Church, which was
completed a year or so later.
Mount Blackwood’s bracing cli-
mate, together with the healthy,
open-air occupation and freedom
from the attractions and distractions
of the city, produced men of great
physical strength and endurance ;
and an amazing story is told of a
miner and farmhand named Dick
Shinnick who carried a 200-lb bag
of flour from Greendale through the
bush to his camp on the Lerderderg
River —a distance of some seven
miles. The job took two days, and
a similar period to recover from the
effort. Dick was a thick-set man of
medium height, with all the charac-
teristics of an athlete, and in these
days of sport would probably have
found a more profitable outlet for
Iris physical energies than that of
being a beast of burden.
Prominent amongst the successful
miners in the Lerderderg River east
of the Mount were the Chadwick
Bros., Bob Ward and John Berridge,
who regularly sold their gold at
Drury’s store in return for living
requirements. To-day the same
ground is being re-worked by sus-
tenance men who are able to “make
ends meet” because the price of gold
is more than double what it was
when the old fossickers first
“cradled” it.
In the compilation of these notes
I have found much pleasure, and
am indebted for information sup-
plied by Messrs. John Deveny, John
Cowan, Maxwell Muir and Geoffrey
Purcell, whose parents were amongst
the original settlers, and whose
families and connections have un-
bounded faith in the district. These
fine types of men are all more or
less around the allotted span, with
experience and adventure written
on every line of their faces, and
with a philosophy that can only be
appreciatively understood by those
who have long been associated with
Nature’s wild moods, the open spaces
and open roads leading thereto.
It is fairly easy to realise that
the peaceful, pensive nature of the
surroundings of this attractive
Mount is less disturbed to-day than
it was 70 odd years ago when the
population was more congested and
the traffic to and from the Black-
wood Diggings more continuous.
The change is definite and some-
times -disturbing. The distant call
of some lonely bittern, the laugh of
the kookaburra and other familiar
sounds of the bush, awakening to
the dawn of another day, fail not to
make the feeling a little more
pathetic, a little more pronounced
But at eventide, when silent shadows
steal athwart the southern slopes,
one fancies, for a moment, that the
adventurous spirit of the old settlers
still lingers—ever-conquering, ever-
subduing—and as the little clumps
of whispering pines come into view,
they at once become a fitting monu-
ment to their memories and
pioneering work. While the pines
remain no emblem of sculptured
stone or rounded rail need ever be
raised.
