PREFACE.
It is so plainly the duty of every man to do what he can for
the good of his country, that no apology is required for the
publication of this attempted solution of the most important
and most difficult problem of the day.
While all other questions of general concern are publicly
agitated and discussed, this momentous one of National Edu-
cation is left to the chances of a vote in the Legislature as if
it were utterly beyond either the control or the compre-
hension of the people themselves. Whereas, however excel-
lent may be the design and the ability of our rulers, there
is no matter in which their hands so much need guidance
and strengthening. It is not unlikely that this backwardness
on part of the people may arise from their having before
them no clear and definite basis on which they can take their
stand and act.
The writer of this paper has therefore thought it advisable
to place before them what appears to him the most feasible
and equitable system of National Education in the form of
an address to the Legislature, together with the arguments
upon which it is founded. Details are for the most part
avoided, lest they should draw attention from *the broad
principles upon which it is necessary first to agree. When once
these are settled, and a clear conception gained of the legi-
timate functions of the government in this matter, there will
be little difficulty in dealing with the minor parts of the
subject.


It may here be stated that it is contrary to the practice
of Parliament to receive argumentative addresses.
It will be easy however for those who coincide with the
views contained in this paper to separate the facts and the
prayer , and submit a petition thus composed to the Legislature.
This is the legitimate, the only course to pursue; for
until the people take the matter into their own hands a
satisfactory conclusion seems hopeless. An excellent example
has just been afforded us in this respect, and while the
advocates of National Education in New South Wales are
almost despairing of seeing their desires accomplished, a
bright ray of encouragement has come to them from the
adjoining colony.
The Church of England Clergy of Victoria in convention
with their Bishop, have by a large majority adopted a report
recommending the total separation of the ecclesiastical and
the secular branches of instruction as the only possible, and
indeed the only equitable, solution of the educational diffi-
culty. Since this paper was written that report has been
published; and it has afforded the author no small satis-
faction to find this important body, (which is commonly
regarded as having a vested interest in the maintenance of
the existing anomaly,) coinciding with the conclusions here
put forth.
Although everything has yet to be done, especially in this
colony of New South Wales, there are indications that the
people generally are becoming awakened to the urgency of
the case, and it is not unreasonable to expect that assistance
will be readily accorded to them by every Philanthropist, who
believes in the possibility of winning for a young and pro-
mising people a higher civilization than the world has yet
seen by securing for all its children the fullest means of


development for their moral and intellectual natures; by
every Patriot who loves his country too well to consolidate
and perpetuate a system of denominationalism, and who
shrinks from clogging the inheritance of his children with
such an apple of discord: and by every Christian who believes
that the Author of his faith, so far from coming to build up
walls of partition between Christian and Christian, came rather
to break down those that existed between Jew and Gentile.
This paper is published anonymously in order that its
contents may have the advantage, (so important to an un-
biased search for truth,) of being judged solely upon their
own merits and without respect to individuals.

A PLEA FOR COMMON SCHOOLS.
TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
We the undersigned inhabitants of the district ofPreamLle.
in the Colony of New South Wales,
respectfully beg leave to call the attention of your Honorable
House to the alarming destitution of Education that prevails
throughout the colony, and to petition that early and effectual
measures may be taken to afford relief therefrom.
It appears by the recent census that while the population The cases
of the Colony amounts only to 266,189 persons, there are no
less than 70,228 persons above the age of seven years, who are
unable to read and write; and of the number thus ignorant
of the first rudiments of Education 31,555 are between the
ages of seven and twenty-one years: the total population
between those ages being 80,283.
There can be no doubt that the number of uneducated
persons is in reality far greater from the fact that the most
meagre ability in reading and writing renders an individual
eligible to be classed as ? Educated,? But notwithstanding
this facility nearly 40 per cent, of the population between
the ages of seven and twenty-one years are acknowledged to
be in a state of utter ignorance.
In the face of these facts it is impossible to contemplate
the future social condition of this country but a few years


hence, without the gravest feelings of apprehension. Igno-
rance and crime go hand in hand ; so that it is certain that
should the rising generation arrive at manhood in their
present state of barbarous ignorance, not only will the colony
sink deep into the abyss of social degradation; but the risk
to life and property, and the cost of police protection, (already
excessive,) will be so enormous, as to render the country an
unfit abode for civilized beings.
An examination into the existing means of remedy for
this state of things, serves only to enhance our alarm. The
whole machinery for educational purposes is utterly inadequate
to the wants of the colony. With the exception of a few
private and Sunday Schools, there is no voluntary education
in the country. The only public schools in existence are
those which receive support from the Government.
It appears by the final report of the School Commissioners
that there is not School accommodation for more than one
third of the children in the colony; that the condition of the
schools is deplorable in the extreme, few schools being worthy
of the name. The nature and situation of the buildings, the
supply of educational apparatus, the quality of the instruction
afforded, the qualifications of the teachers, and the attain-
ments of the children, are, with few exceptions, on the lowest
level. So that the very inadequate grant of money devoted
to the all-important purpose of education, is almost entirely
thrown away.
We are convinced that this failure of the Government
Schools is attributable primarily and mainly to the inherent
defects of the system employed.


The grand defect of the system is the absence of unity
both of design and of operation. Instead of a comprehensive
scheme embracing the whole of the people in a common
common
system of education irrespective of private differences in
matters with which the Government has no proper concern,
an attempt is made to subserve the purposes of various
religious bodies by combining instruction in their distinctive
tenets with the ordinary school routine.
To this attempted combination we attribute the failure
of Governmental Education in New South Wales : and we
are satisfied that it would be sufficient to ensure like failure
in any country in the world in which various religions are
professed by the inhabitants. For,
Ist. It is founded on an erroneous principle.
The Government being but an emanation from the people
who compose the State, for the purpose of obtaining mutual
security and advantage, and regulating their general relations
in life, its legitimate functions are confined to matters which
affect only the temporal welfare of the community. The
revenue is a common fund subscribed by, and for the mutual
benefit of, all members of the State: and it is an evident
misappropriation of that fund to apply it to anything?(lst)
that is not of a purely practical nature, and (2ndly) that is
not advantageous to all who contribute to it.
The highest type of legislation is that which combines
the greatest personal security with the greatest personal
liberty. Actions only, and words when injurious to others,
are amenable to the laws. Opinions are absolutely free. It


is therefore a misappropriation of the public revenue to devote
it to the promotion or repression of opinions. And it is an
injustice to apply funds derived from the whole community
to the promotion of the opinions of any portion of it.
The object of the state in providing Education is the
prevention of crime by training children to become good
citizens.
It cannot be maintained that a knowledge of the dogmas
or details of any of the various ecclesiastical systems is so
necessarily conducive to this end as to render its promotion
imperative upon the State.
The Education required, and that alone which the State
has any concern in promoting, is one which by cultivating
the reason, judgment, habits, and disposition, and by im-
planting in the mind the principles which regulate our duty
to ourselves and to others, will best fit children to discharge
their duties as men and women.
The admission of any distinctive tenet is a sentence of
exclusion against all who do not hold that tenet; and no
system can be called National, or is entitled to the support
of the State, which does not act justly and impartially to all
members of the State: that is, which does not include all
who contribute to the revenue of the State.
The intention even of that part of the existing system
which is distinguished as the ? National,? is to exclude all
who do not profess the Christian religion; and involves the
admission either that those persons need not be good citizens,
or that they can be so without either Christianity or education.


The first duty of the State is justice to all its members:
and they ill recommend their religion who refuse justice to
any. We believe that.strict justice in this matter is not
incompatible with true religion.
There is then in this country no truly National System
of Education whatever. Both divisions of the existing system
are denominational.
The plea frequently urged in favour of this system, that
it is not rigidly carried out so as to exclude children holding
other religious beliefs, amounts to a confession of its error
and impropriety. While to afford, in what are intended to
be schools for the exclusive use of certain denominations, an
education devoid of the peculiar tenets of those denominations,
is to apply the funds provided by the State to purposes
foreign to those for which they were granted by the State;
and exposes such denominations to the charge of obtaining
the money under false pretences.
2ndly. The present system is necessarily extravagant and Why
fail.
inefficient.
The division of the Education fund among different
denominations necessitates the erection of a multitude of small
school-houses instead of a limited number of large ones; and
the employment of an extra number of inferior teachers in-
stead of a comparatively few able ones. We attribute the
present scarcity of efficient teachers engaged in the work of
education to the scanty remuneration permitted by the sub-
division of the funds. To divide the funds is to divide the
ability, and waste the power. So that through the exclusive-


ness, and consequent smallness, of the schools, and the absence
of a comprehensive system, not only do the children lose all
the advantage to be derived from the combination and emu-
lation of their teachers? skill, but the teachers themselves are
deprived of the additional experience which would be gained
by mutual association in their labours.
The right ba-
sis.
In reference to the changes which we desire to see
introduced, we would premise that as members of a State
composed of people of various races and religions, we consider
that the education provided by the State ought to be such
that, not Christians only, but all who are, or who may
become, citizens , can use it without violence to their religious
opinions. It should be an education that should train chil-
dren to become good citizens without reference to any eccle-
siastical system whatever. Such systems are internal to the
State; as much so as the Society of Freemasons, or Joint
Stock Companies, or any other exclusive body: they are
private to the members who compose them. We all con-
tribute to the support of the State: we are all equally
citizens; and our respective religions are matters of private
concern to us. And if any of us are unable to support our
religion, we have no right to expect others to support it for us.
The Government has no more to do with our religious, than
with our scientific, differences. Its function in the matter
of education is limited to the police point of view.
The separate As members of any church we may be right in obtaining
zen y a nd th of C the for our church all possible support; but as members of the
religionist. g tate) j g our (J u ty to protest against the application of the
general revenue to sectional purposes. Deploring, as we do,
the differences existing among us, we severely reprobate any


attempt on the part of the Government to foment and per-
petuate them.
We feel that if the Federal Government of the United
States, (which derives its revenue from all the States,) were
to grant an annual subsidy to the Free States to maintain
their existing institutions, and to train their children to do
the same; and a like subsidy to the Slave States for the
same purpose, we could only acknowledge that that Govern-
ment had paid us the compliment of adopting our denomina-
tional system.
We would here emphatically state that in taking these
views of our duties as citizens, we by no means ignore the
fact of our church membership. Our duties in the two
capacities are distinct, but not incompatible.
We have expressed our view of the duty of the State in
the matter of popular education.
The duty incumbent upon us as members of our respec-
tive communions is to have our children instructed in our
own faith by properly qualified persons.
We object to the sacred mysteries of religion being
familiarized and degraded into mere routine tasks for teaching
spelling and training the memory. We object to the delicate
duty of instilling those solemn truths being imposed upon
persons who have no special call thereto, whose proper func-
tions are entirely distinct, and who, we are well assured,
would gladly be relieved from such an addition to their
already heavy responsibilities.


It should then be our concern to supplement the State
provision with special instruction in our respective religious
doctrines, and to provide properly qualified persons to per-
form the duty.
We, therefore, as members of the State,, earnestly and
respectfully petition your Honorable House to meet the
urgent necessities of the country by devising and establishing
an uniform and comprehensive system of education, and by
establishing common schools on a scale that shall be coin-
cident with the requirements of the population ; such schools
to be under the vigilant supervision either of the Government
or of the local municipalities. And inasmuch as a large portion
of the colony is too thinly peopled to admit of the general
establishment of regular schools, we beg leave to suggest the
propriety of granting small allowances of money to aid and
encourage such persons as may engage in the work of educa-
tion in those districts, such persons being annually licensed
by the local benches of magistrates, or by a Board appointed
by the Government for that purpose, on producing satisfac-
tory certificates of character and competency.
The Prayer.
And we farther, as members of our various churches, pray
that the Sabbath day and certain periods in each week may
be set apart to enable the children attending the common
schools to receive, in the school buildings, special instruction
in the religious tenets of their respective denominations from
such teachers as their parents and clergy may appoint for
that purpose, the whole expense thereof being voluntarily
borne by the religious bodies respectively.
