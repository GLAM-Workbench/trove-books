The Southern Cross Organisation




Foreword
TO most people in Australia, particularly those in the
pastoral and agricultural industries, the Southern Cross
Organisation needs no introduction.
It is nearly 80 years since the Southern Cross
Organisation was founded in Toowoomba and the inter-
vening years have been years of progress—years in which the name
“Southern Cross” has become recognised as a symbol of quality and effi-
ciency, as is evidenced by the ever-growing popularity of “Southern Cross”
products, not only in Australia but in many overseas countries as well.
If the founder of the Organisation were here to see the fruits of his
enterprise he would be astounded. The small wood structure has been re-
placed by acres of modern brick and steel buildings. The few small tools
have given way to the thousands of expensive precision machines which are
capable of previously undreamed-of accuracy—many of them robot-like
automatic machines which are almost uncanny in their operation. The fac-
tory that originally was large enough to employ only a few men has grown
until over 1200 trained and skilled workmen now put their knowledge and
skill to the production of quality equipment.
He would be astounded, too, at the growth of the selling and servicing
organisation —the associated “Southern Cross” Companies in every main-
land State of the Commonwealth and in South Africa, backed by a chain
of distributors in the main cities and towns, all eager and capable of giving
customers the best possible advice and service.
The quality of design would impress him, too, when he recalled the
somewhat crude mechanisms of 80 years ago and compared them with the
highly efficient “Southern Cross” products of to-day—the powerful diesel
engines supplying power for farm, station, and industry; large steel struc-
ture windmills, with their galvanising gleaming in the sunlight, capable of
watering thousands of head of stock; generating sets providing electricity
for the primary and secondary industries and lighting whole towns; the
milking machines which have taken the back-breaking drudgery out of dairy
farming; the water-boring plants which rapidly sink new bores so that the
life-giving water may be brought to the surface; and all the other modern
equipment which you will see illustrated in this catalogue.
But above all else he could not help but be pleased and gratified to
see the enormous number of satisfied Users of “Southern Cross” equip-
ment, and it is to those thousands of Customers that we want to say
“Thank you” for your enthusiasm for our products. We hope you will find
this catalogue useful and that you will keep it handy for reference. In its
pages you will find many “old favourites” and some new designs which we
assure you are well capable of upholding the prestige of “Southern Cross”.
To those who have not yet honoured us with their custom we say that
we would be very pleased indeed to know you and to have your orders for
goods made by us as shown in this catalogue. We feel sure that once-you
order “Southern Cross” equipment you will be well satisfied and will con-
tinue to use it just as do the many thousands of satisfied “Southern Cross”
Users now.


SOUTHERN CROSS DIESEL ENGINES SERVE THE PRIMARY INDUSTRIES OF AUSTRALIA
Every day, on Australian farms and outback stations, SOUTHERN CROSS Diesel Engines are doing their job faith-
fully and well providing the power for pumping water, irrigation, electric light and power, milking machines, shear-
ing machines, wood cutting, chaff cutting, gristing—in fact, providing power for every farm and station need.
Southern Cross Diesel Engines
SOUTHERN CROSS Diesel Engines are made in five sizes as described on the following pages and
are designed for industrial, agricultural and pastoral applications where engines of up to 80 horse-
power are required.
They are medium-speed heavy-duty engines developed and built to give thoroughly efficient,
reliable and lasting service. They can be depended upon to do their job year in and year out with the
minimum of attention. The increasing number of governmental, industrial and agricultural users
who have installed these engines bear testimony to their quality and leadership. Because they are
such sturdy dependable machines which have built up an enviable reputation for economical run-
ning and trouble-free service they have become the popular choice of engine users throughout Aus-
tralia and in many countries overseas.

Agricultural and Industrial Show, Cairo.
Some of the more important features which all Southern Cross Diesel Engines have in common are :
They are of vertical design in accordance with the best
engineering practice of Europe and America.
Full enclosure and dust-proof construction ensures com-
plete protection from weather and dirt and keeps the vital
working parts clean.
Accessibility is a special feature of all Southern Cross
Diesel Engines and all working parts may be easily with-
drawn from the outside without disturbing the engine as a
unit. This and other features, such as being able to with-
draw the connecting rod through the liner, are features which
make these engines so easy and economical to service.
Automatic Oiling enables continuous running so that the
engines may be left running unattended for long periods.
Forced feed lubrication supplies oil under pressure to the
main, big end, and small end bearings.
Hand starting from cold is a feature of design appreciated
by all users, particularly those in the colder climates. Even
under freezing conditions the Southern Cross Diesel can be
readily and easily started, by hand, without the aid of any
lamp or burning of cartridges, etc.
Economical running. As compared with a petrol or kero-
sene engine, any diesel is considerably more economical in
fuel—-operating at approximately one-half the cost of a
kerosene engine and about one-third the cost of a petrol
engine. And Southern Cross Diesel Engines are even more
economical than most makes of Diesel engines of the same
size because they have been designed, built, tested and
warranted to run on Diesel Fuel Oils. Their performance is
even better on distillates.
Maximum interchangeability of parts. Every "B" Pattern
Engine, irrespective of size, has the same bore and stroke
so that most of the vital parts—such as pistons, valves,
cylinder liners, connecting rods, bearings, etc.- —are exactly
the same for any size of these engines. This feature of de-
sign ensures maintenance simplification for users.
Testing. Every Southern Cross Diesel Engine is tested to
develop more than its rated horsepower before passing its
final inspection, and also to give the fuel consumption war-
ranted or better. Every engine has been run in and is ready
for work immediately on delivery.

COOLING.
Mark YB. The standard method
of cooling is by Thermo-
syphon system with 33 gal-
lon cooling tank and large
pipe connections. This size
cooling tank is ample where
the engine has to run up to
8 hours a day but, if the
engine has to run over 8
hours per day, then a 90
gallon cooling tank should
be used. Alternatively, the
engine can be supplied to
be cooled by radiator and
fan. As a further alterna-
tive, the engine can be
supplied with a cast iron
hopper where the engine is
used for short periods on
light loads and where ar-
rangements can be made to
replenish the water in the
hopper every two or three
hours.
Mark BD-C. Cooling is by cool-
ing tank using the thermo-
syphon system or, alterna-
tively, by radiator and fan.
The standard cooling tank
is of 160 gallons capacity
and is supplied ready built.
This tank is ample where
the engine has to run up to
8 hours per day, but if the
engine has to run over 8
hours per day, then a tank of 340 gallons
capacity should be used. In the case of this
larger size tank, materials only are supplied.
Marks BE-C, BF-C, and BC-C. By radiator and
fan as standard. Radiator cooling is used be-
cause it has been proved the most efficient
cooling system for multi-cylinder engines,
the advantages being that the water more
quickly reaches the proper working tempera-
ture after starting, less water is required
and, consequently, rain water can be used.
Also a radiator cooled engine is more compact
and occupies less space than a tank cooled

REPLACEABLE WET-TYPE
CYLINDER LINERS are
fitted. They are centrifu-
gally cast and accurately
bored and honed to a mir-
ror finish. Cooling water
comes in actual contact
with the liners. Experience
over many years has proved
that the material in these
liners gives superior per-
formance to any other and
it is not unusual to receive
reports of Southern Cross
Diesel Engines which have
run 20,000 or more hours
without cylinder liner re-
placement. Easily replace-
able liners are used so that
when wear eventually
makes them too large they
can be inexpensively and
quickly replaced with new
liners having the same
bore as that of a new
engine.
CYLINDER HEADS have ample water passages
surrounding the combustion chamber, elim-
inating steam pockets and rendering uniform

fitted with special valve
seat inserts which are ex-
tremely hard with the re-
sult that valve grinding is
rarely necessary.
The Southern Cross Com-
bustion Chamber gives
Southern Cross Diesel En-
gines the outstanding ad-
vantages of easy starting
and steadier even running
throughout the speed range
and ensures complete com-
bustion of the fuel with
the least possible deposit
of carbon on internal sur-
faces, a clear exhaust, free
piston rings, and a greater
fuel economy. These com-
bustion chambers have a
further advantage, too, in
that they have been de-
signed to ensure entire
combustion of varying
types of fuel oils and dis-
tillates and are not sensi-
tive to particular fuel
types.
CRANKSHAFTS of these en
gines are made from high
tensile steel and heat
treated for greater strength.
All the bearing surfaces
are accurately ground to
very fine limits and coun-
ter-balance weights ensure almost vibration-
less running at all speeds within the speed
range.

of 18 pints and the fuel tanks
for the “B” Pattern Engines
have a capacity of 18 gallons.
The approximate capacities
of these fuel tanks when the
engines are running on full
load are : YB, 9 hours; BD-C,
32 hours; BE-C, 16 hours;
BF-C, 11 hours: BC-C, 8
hours.
FUEL CONSUMPTION. The Mark YB engine is warranted to use
not more than .5 pints of fuel per B.H.P. per hour on full load
and larger engines not more than .45 pints per B.H.P. per
hour on full load, with very good proportions on light loads.
FUEL PUMPS AND INJECTORS. C.A.V. or Pyrox pumps and in-
jectors with pintle type self-cleaning nozzles are used on
these engines and have the advantage of being standard
equipment which can be readily serviced in most cities in
Australia.
A special feature incorporated in Southern Cross “B” Pat-
tern Engines is that a separate fuel pump is used to feed
each cylinder so that one single type pump is interchangeable
on all “B” Pattern engines and cylinders.

for buildings and streets, for auxiliary electric generating plants for factories, shops, and theatres—serving the
Cities faithfully, as well as the Country.
GOVERNOR.
Mark YB. Centrifugal type governor com-
pletely enclosed and lubricated in the engine
crankcase.
“B” Pattern Engines. The gear-driven centri-
fugal type governor is internally mounted
in the engine crankcase and is flood lubri-
cated in all its parts. It is spring preloaded
and adjustable for the whole speed range
and its function is to control the fuel injec-
tion pumps so that the amount of fuel charge
delivered at any given moment is exactly
that demanded by the load of the engine.
A special feature of the Southern Cross
governor which makes Southern Cross “B”
Pattern Diesel Engines suitable for all pur-
poses is that the governing characteristics
comply with British Standard Specification
Mark BG-C Southern Cross Diesel Engine similar to the Mark BG-C Engine
illustrated on Page 9 but with Outrigger Assembly for flat belt drive. The
outrigger assembly is exactly the same on Marks BE-C, BF-C, and BG-C Diesel
Engines.
No. 649, i.e., when all the load is suddenly
removed the momentary increase in speed
will not exceed 10% of the normal full load
speed, and the steady no-load speed will not
exceed the normal full-load speed by more
than 4%.
ELECTRIC STARTING. If requi red, electric
starting equipment can be supplied as an
extra for Marks BE-C, BF-C, and BC-C En-
gines. This electric starting equipment con-
sists of :
Ring gear fitted to flywheel.

These units are heavy duty units suitable for
applications where engines up to 80 B.H.P. are
required.
They can be supplied for either direct
coupling or for belt drive and consist of two
Southern Cross Mark BC-C Four Cylinder Diesel
Engines mounted side by side and coupled by
clutches to a 2 to 1 reduction gearbox. The sec-
ondary shaft on the output side of the gearbox is
fitted with a flexible coupling which can be
direct coupled to the driven unit or which can be
coupled to a Belt Drive Assembly for belt drive.
The whole unit, including the belt drive as-
sembly when the unit is supplied for belt drive,
is mounted on a welded steel base.
OUTPUT. The horse-power ratings shown under
the illustration are the ratings at sea level
and at 62° F. for a 12-hour day. In ac-
cordance with British Standard Specification
No. 649/1935, a reduction in output of 4
per cent, must be made for every 1000 feet
above 250 feet, and a 2 per cent, reduction
for every 10° F. above 62° F. Where the
units are required to run for more than 12
hours per day then the output must be re-
duced by a further 10%.
ENGINES. Standard SOUTHERN CROSS MARK
BG-C FOUR CYLINDER DIESEL ENGINES
as described on pages 4 to 11.
CLUTCHES are standard Southern Cross Heavy
Duty, Spring Loaded, Single Dry Plate
Clutches. The clutch operating mechanism,
which consists of a lever operating a cam
ring running on rollers, is mounted on the
gearbox.
GEARBOX is made of cast iron and is totally en-
closed and dust proof. For further protec-
tion, all the bearings are sealed against
dust, etc., by spring loaded leather seals.
The drive is by two duplex roller chains from
each primary shaft to the secondary shaft.
These shafts are carried in adjustable taper
roller bearings which are splash lubricated.
The drive chain itself continually runs in oil.
The sprockets on the primary shafts are
made of mild steel and the sprocket on the
secondary shaft is made of cast iron. These
sprockets give a reduction of 2 to 1 so that
the secondary shaft runs at half the speed
of the engines. This is a particular advant-
age when slow speed machines have to be
driven.
FLEXIBLE COUPLING is a sturdy coupling of the totally
enclosed, grease lubricated, roller chain type.
PULLEYS. Where the unit is supplied for belt drive, a belt
drive assembly is supplied and the price includes one
flat belt pulley 15-ins. wide and in any diameter from
9-ins. to 20-ins.
If required, a 13-in. to 20-in. P.C.D. x 11 "D"
Groove V-belt pulley can be supplied instead of the flat
belt pulley at an extra charge of £5/—/—.
ELECTRIC STARTING. If required, electric starting equip-
ment can be supplied as an extra and consists of ring
gears fitted to the engine flywheels, two starter motors
and necessary brackets and straps to fit them to the
engines, two push-button control switches, four 6-volt
heavy duty batteries, and a battery charging generator
and switchboard—the generator being V-belt driven
from one of the engines.


Southern Cross Diesel Marine Engines
Southern Cross Diesel Marine En-
gines are made in four sizes, the three
larger sizes of which are illustrated
below.
They are heavy duty engines gene-
rally the same as the “B” Pattern
stationary engines illustrated and de-
scribed on pages 4 to 1 1 of this cata-
logue, but they have been adapted for
marine use by small modifications and
by the addition of a gearbox and
clutch.
The engines can be readily started
by hand, a special ratchet chain drive
being fitted for that purpose. However,
electric starting equipment can be
fitted to the multi-cylinder engines as
an extra, if required.
The engines are designed for fresh
water cooling but can be supplied for
sea water cooling if necessary. Twin
fuel filters are fitted and, on the three
larger engines, a water cooled exhaust
manifold is supplied as standard.
The standard gearbox has a 2 to 1
reduction gear built in and, as each en-
gine has a speed range of from 400 to
1200 r.p.m., propeller speeds of 200 to
600 r.p.m. are achieved. Forward drive
is through two machine cut gears and
reverse drive is by means of duplex
chain.
The clutch assembly is built into the
gearbox and, for forward drive, is a
self-adjusting multi-plate type. For
reverse drive, the clutch is a self-ad-
justing cone-ring type.

COOLING. The engine is directly air
cooled by efficient flywheel fan which
draws air past the finned crankcase
and blows it, through a streamlined
volute cowling, across the large area
fins on the cylinder and cylinder head.
The engine is designed to run in
temperatures up to 125° F.
The advantages of air cooling are
that there are no water tanks, hop-
pers or fittings requiring attention
and it adds to the portability of the
engine.
CRANKCASE is of very stiff section and
has a large cover for internal inspec-
tion and adjustment.
CYLINDER is made of special cast iron
accurately bored and honed to a mir-
ror finish. It is fitted with large
cooling fins and is removable from
the crankcase.
CYLINDER HEAD. Is of cast iron with
fully enclosed overhead valves. The
special combustion chamber gives a
reserve of power with low petrol con-
sumption, and the exhaust valve insert is a special
hardened insert so as to give long life between re-
grinding.
CRANKSHAFT is a high tensile steel drop forging running
on adjustable taper roller bearings. The crankpin is of
large diameter and all bearing surfaces are accurately
ground to size. Accurate counter balance weights are
fitted to ensure vibrationless running.
CONNECTING ROD is also a high tensile steel drop forg-
ing (for strength) and is fitted with a die cast replace-
able whitemetal big end bearing, and a gunmetal small
end bush.

wire wool air cleaner is fitted as
standard.
FUEL TANK has a capacity of 13 pints.
FUEL CONSUMPTION is approximately
three-quarters of a pint per B.H.P.
per hour when running on full load.
GOVERNOR. The governor is mounted
inside the crankcase. It is fully en-
closed, dust proof, and automatically
oiled and is of the centrifugally
operated type operating on the
throttle principle—so that for each
power stroke only the exact amount
of fuel mixture required to develop the power is ad-
mitted to the cylinder, resulting in even running and low
fuel consumption. The engine speed can be adjusted
over a speed range from 1200 r.p.m. to 1800 r.p.m.
while the engine is running.
PULLEYS. 3", 31", 4", 41", 5", 51", 6", 7", 8", 9" and
10" diameter, by 43" face, 11" bore. The pulley can
be mounted on the crankshaft, or on the camshaft run-
ning at half the crankshaft speed, but in the latter case
the maximum size permissible is 7" diameter. The fly-
wheel is grooved for one "B" type V-belt, 9i" pitch
diameter.
TESTS. Every Southern Cross Petrol Engine is tested to de-
velop more than its rated horse-power before passing its
final inspection.

Southern Cross Electric Motors
2 H.P. and 2f H.P. 3-Phase A.C. Squirrel Cage Induction Motors
Southern Cross Electric Motors are general purpose motors suitable for the majority of indus-
trial drives.
The simplicity, reliability and excellent running characteristics, combined with relatively con-
stant speed, inherent in a squirrel cage motor, has led the Southern Cross Organisation to standardize
on the Squirrel Cage General Purpose Motor.
Southern Cross Electric Motors are Totally Enclosed and Fan Cooled, as standard, providing addi-
tional protection for the windings of the machine from dust and dirt, oil and water.
In all respects the Southern Cross Motor is excellent value and, with normal usage, will provide
exceptionally long life and trouble-free running.
TYPE : Totally Enclosed, Fan Cooled,
General Purpose, Squirrel Cage,
Continuous Rating.
VOLTAGE AND FREQUENCY OF
SUPPLY : 3-phase A.C., 400/440
volts, 50 cycle.
CURRENT CONSUMPTION : 2 H/p.
Motors, 3 amperes; 23 H/p. Motors,
4 amperes.
SPEED : Full Load Speed, 1425 r.p.m.
EFFICIENCY : Is high over a wide range
of output extending from half load
to 25% overload which covers the
usual working conditions.
POWER FACTOR : Careful design has
enabled the power factor to be
maintained high over a wide range
of loads. From half load to 25%
overload the power factor is .8 P.F.
or better.
As many supply authorities give re-
bates where a high power factor is
maintained, power charges will be
low without the installation of ex-
pensive correcting devices.
STATOR : The frame of the motor is cast iron and is of
exceptionally strong design. Air ducts are cast in the
frame. These ducts match up with holes in the end-
shields through which a large volume of air is blown,
effectively cooling the motor. For all normal dust and
dirt the air vents are self cleaning.
STATOR WINDINGS : The stator windings are former
wound from high grade special enamelled copper wire
and are inserted into the stator by hand. The coils are
secured in the stator by wood wedges.

ROTOR : The squirrel cage rotor is
built from accurately notched
laminations into which the rotor
bars and end rings are centrifugally
cast in aluminium. Rotors are bal-
anced at all stages of construction,
forming a vibrationless, noise-free
and highly efficient rotor with high
mechanical strength.
BEARINGS : Deep-grooved radial bail
bearings with a single seal on the
inside of the bearings are used on
both ends.
FAN : A cast aluminium fan draws
large quantities of air from the
surrounding atmosphere and forces
it through the cooling ducts of the
frame and out over the fins on the
endshields ensuring cool operation
even under adverse conditions.
TERMINAL BOX : The terminal box is
conveniently situated on the left-
hand side of the motor looking from
the pulley end. The box is ar-
ranged to take screwed conduit or
screwed conduit fittings.
The 2 h.p. motor is wired for Direct-On-Line starting
while the 23 h.p. motor is wired to enable Direct-On-
Line or Star-Delta starting to be used.
TESTS: The motors comply with B.S.S. 168/1936. The
temperature rise does not exceed 50° C. (Class "A"
insulation), and the motor is capable of giving 50%
overload in torque for one minute and 100% over-
load in torque for 15 seconds. Motors are subject
to a high voltage test of 2000 volts A.C. for one

SOUTHERN CROSS D.C. Generating Sets are illustrated and described on the following pages. The
generators used in these sets are of Southern Cross Manufacture and the specification applying to them
is set out below.
TYPE : Direct Current, Ball Bearing, Fan Ventilated Genera-
tors complying with B.S.S. 168/1936.
All but the 1 Kilowatt, and the 1.5 Kilowatt 110 and
240 Volt generators are direct coupled generators
which run at 1200 r.p.m. The exceptions mentioned
are V-Belt driven generators which run at 1660 r.p.m.
All these generators are of the protected type, the
direct-coupled machines being screen protected. The
4.5 K.W. and larger machines are of drip-proof con-
struction.
WINDINGS : The 1 Kilowatt, 1.5 Kilowatt, and 4.5 Kilo-
watt Battery Charging Generators are Shunt Wound.
The 1.5 Kilowatt 32V. and 50V. Battery Charging and
Direct Lighting Generators are Shunt and Compound
Wound.
All the other Generators are Compound Wound.
MAIN FRAME : Made of special high grade, close-grained,
high-permeability cast iron for the 1 K.W., 1.5 K.W.,
and 20 K.W. Generators; and of High-permeability
Rolled Steel for the 4.5 K.W., 9 K.W., and 14 K.W.
machines.
FIELD POLES : Built up with laminated steel sheet, securely
riveted and adjusted for air-gap with steel shims.
INTERPOLES : Are fitted to 4.5 K.W. and larger generators
allowing the brushes to run in the neutral position and
ensuring sparkless commutation under all conditions.
FIELD COILS : Field Coils are wound from the best
high conductivity copper, and are thoroughly impreg-
nated and insulated from
steel poles.
ARMATURE : The arma-
ture is built up with
laminated special elec-
tric steel, accurately
notched for the winding
slots and securely fitted
to high tensile bright steel
armature shaft. Armatures
are balanced at all stages
of construction, and are
thoroughly vacuum im-
pregnated with special
insulating varnish.
ARMATURE WINDINGS :
The coils are hand wound
for the 1 K.W. and 1.5
K.W. generators. For
the larger sizes of
During the war years Australia built many corvettes,
similar to the one illustrated above, to the exceedingly
high standards of the Navy Department.
Every one of them was equipped with a 20 k.W. Southern
Cross Generating Set.
generators the coils are former wound, and carefully
taped and insulated before being laid in the slots. Arma-
ture coils are secured in the slots by wood wedges, the
former wound coils being fitted with steel binders on the
end windings.
ARMATURE FAN ; This is fitted to the end of the armature
and is of cast iron f®r the 1 K.W. and 1.5 K.W. genera-
tors and, on the 4.5 K.W. and larger generators, is of
steel construction throughout, spot-welded and riveted
for rigidity.
COMMUTATOR : The commutator is built up with high
conductivity hard drawn copper segments and mica in-
sulation, providing a solid commutator with high insula-
tion resistance and long life.
BRUSH GEAR : The brush holders are bronze, accurately
machined and arranged so that the brushes can be easily
replaced and the spring pressure on each can be separ-
ately adjusted. The current is taken from the brushes
between flexible connections (not through sliding con-
tact). A radio suppressor condenser is fitted between
the positive and negative brushes and the frame of the
machine.
BEARINGS : Deep-grooved radial ball bearings are used on
both ends. The ball bearing on the commutator end is
fixed to take end thrust, the drive end bearing being
free to float and take radial load only.
END SHIELDS : These are made of cast iron and
are of exceptionally strong design. Covers are pro-
vided to give easy access
to the commutator. The
end shields of the 20 K.W.
machines are split hori-
zontally to provide easy
access to the machine.
TESTS : The generators con-
form to B.S.S. 168/1936
which provides that when
run on full load for 6
hours the temperature rise
for a ventilated machine
will not exceed 40° C.,
and that the generator will
carry an overload of 25%
for two hours, and 50%
tor one minute. Genera-
tors are subject to a high
voltage test of 2000
Volts A.C. for one minute.


For too many years the country folk of Australia have done without those benefits of elec-
tricity which are now available to almost every home in the city.
The low prices at which SOUTHERN CROSS Generating Sets are offered now place the con-
venience and comfort of electricity within the reach of all.

steads, and for any other
uses within their capacity.
These sets have the spe-
cial advantage that they can
be used either with batteries
or for direct lighting, with-
out batteries, simply by re-
versing the change-over link
on the switchboard. There-
fore, should batteries not be
available temporarily for
some reason, continuity of

SOUTHERN CROSS Generating Sets are the only Australian-made Generating Sets which incorporate engines and
generators made by the same manufacturer.
The reason for this is that SOUTHERN CROSS is the only Australian engine manufacturer with a demand for Gene-
rating Sets large enough to justify making its own generators.
The popularity of SOUTHERN CROSS GENERATING SETS is sure proof of their efficiency and reliability.
These plants, which
are designed primarily
for Public, Commercial
or Industrial Lighting
and Power, are made
with either 110 Volt or
240 Volt Generators.
The output of 14

for township supplies and
for a whole host of other
public utility, commer-
cial and industrial appli-
cations.

BEARINGS. Deep-grooved radial ball bearings are used on
both ends and the ball bearing on the slipring end is
fixed to take end thrust, the drive end bearing being
free to float and take radial loads only.
VENTILATION. A large capacity fan fitted to the end of
the armature provides ventilation for both the generator
and exciter. The fan is of steel construction, spot welded
and riveted for rigidity, and accurately balanced.
TESTS. The generator conforms to British Standards Speci-
fication No. 168/1936, which provides that when run
on full load for 6 hours the temperature rise for a ven-
tilated machine will not exceed 40° C. and that the
machine will carry an overload of 25% for two hours
and 50% for one minute. Machines are subject to a
high voltage test of 2,000 Volts A.C. for one minute.
EXCITER
TYPE. .7 K.W. Exciter 100 Volt, 1000 r.p.m., Direct Cur-
rent, Protected, Shunt Wound,
MAIN FRAME. Made from centrifugally cast high per-
meability special cast iron,
END SHIELD. Made from cast iron and fitted with large
covers to provide easy access to the commutator.


Most firms find it sound policy to insure stock, buildings, and plant, etc., against loss by fire
or other causes, and the installation of a stand-by generating set means that the firm is also
insured against loss of business due to power restrictions—particularly at the present time
when power restrictions are regular and are likely to occur for many years yet.
SOUTHERN CROSS Generating Sets are eminently suitable for use as stand-by units to pro-
vide light and power during periods when the main town supply is rationed or cut off.
ARMATURE. The armature is built up with laminated spe-
cial electric steel, securely fitted to a sleeve which slips
on an extension of the generator armature shaft. This
sleeve also carries the commutator so that the assembly
is complete in itself. The armature is hand wound, and
the slot insulation consists of the best grade Empire
cloth with leatheroid for mechanical
protection. Armature coils are secured
in the slots by wood wedges.
COMMUTATOR. The commutator is built
up of high conductivity hard-drawn
copper segments with mica insulation
between the segments.
BRUSH GEAR. Bronze brush holders are
arranged with adjustable brush tension.
Current is taken from the brushes
through flexible connections. Brushes
may be easily replaced, and the exciter
brushes are interchangeable with the
generator brushes. A radio suppressor
condenser is fitted between the positive
and negative brushes and the frame of
the machine.
FIELD POLES. Built up with laminated steel
sheet, securely riveted. Air gap is ad-
justed with steel shims.
FIELD COILS. Field coils are wound from the best high
conductivity copper and are thoroughly impregnated
and insulated from the poles.
BEARINGS. No bearings fitted. The armature is supported
on an extension of the generator shaft.
TESTS. The exciter conforms to British Standards Specifica-
tions No. 168/1936.

Southern Cross Generating Sets
On the preceding pages are illustrated and described the complete range of SOUTHERN CROSS
Generating Sets.
Both the engine and generator are constructed to the highest standards of engineering accuracy
and efficiency. The whole set embodies Southern Cross quality and, to those who know Southern
Cross, this means years of better service.
As will be seen, the smallest set is of 1 Kilowatt capacity and the largest set is of 20 K.W.
capacity.
Many country towns are lighted by Southern Cross Plants. Often these power houses start with
one, two, or three Generating sets and then add more as more electrical power is required.
Government Departments, too, are large users of Southern Cross Generating Sets for lighting and
power purposes.
In recent years, also, large numbers of Factories and Business Houses have installed Southern
Cross Generating Sets as stand-by units to provide light and power during periods when the main
Town Supply is rationed or cut off.

Southern Cross Windmills
Windmills are one of the earliest products of the Southern Cross Organisation, which was founded
in 1871—just on 80 years ago. The present designs are the product of three generations of experience
and research commencing with a world-renowned authority on windmills, as recorded in the 11th
edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and being improved by each generation since with that en-
richment of knowledge which only long experience can produce.
The present Southern Cross Windmills are made in two main types —Geared and Direct Action.
That is to say, windmills that make one pumping stroke for several revolutions of the windwheel and
windmills that make one stroke for each revolution of the windwheel.
The Geared Windmills (those for which the wheel revolves two or more times to give one stroke)
are made in five sizes and are known as the “Z” Pattern. The sizes are 6ft., Bft., 10ft., 12ft., and
14ft, diameter of the windwheel. In other words, an Bft. windmill is one which has a wheel Bft. in
diameter, and a 14ft. windmill is one that has a wheel 14ft. in diameter.
The Direct Action Windmills are made in the larger sizes and are made in two distinct patterns.
There is the 14ft. Direct Action Windmill which is known as the 14ft. “AC” Pattern Windmill and
there are four larger sizes known as “Seneschal” Windmills, the diameters of the wheels being 17ft.,
21ft., 25ft., and 30ft.
They can be supplied with any height of tower listed on page 40.
The question may arise as to why we make Geared Wind-
mills in the smaller sizes and Direct Action Windmills in
the larger sizes.
The reason is that a Windmill less than 14ft. diameter
runs at such a speed in an average wind that if it were
Direct Acting its pumping strokes would be so rapid as to
cause speedy depreciation of the pump parts and undue
strains on the working parts of the mill and on the pump-
rods and joints.
We have therefore applied reduction gearing on the
smaller windmills which enables the mill to make several
revolutions of the windwheel to every stroke of the pump-
rods thereby giving a longer, slower and smoother action
than would be the case if it were Direct Acting.
The gearing is scientifically arranged so that all sizes of
windmills run at about the same number of strokes per
minute and the necessity of gearing the smaller sizes will,
perhaps, be more evident when it is recognised that an Bft.
wheel, for example, makes, in the same wind velocity, 2-2-
to 3 revolutions to one of a 21ft. wheel. Therefore, by
back-gearing the Bft. windmill 3 to 1 we make its pumping
strokes the same as those of the 21ft. and achieve the
most efficient pumping speed.
Windmills over 14ft. diameter naturally lend themselves
to the Direct Action principle and do not require back-
gearing to drive the pump at the correct speed.
It will be noticed that the 14ft. mills are made in two
types and the reason for this is that 14ft. mills are on the
border line between the Direct Action and Geared principles
of windmill construction. For some work such as pumping
large supplies from a shallow well or bore or from a surface
supply into a tank nearby the 14ft. Direct Action Mill is
better. And for pumping smaller supplies through a long
pipe I ine, or from a comparatively deep bore the 14ft.
Geared Mill is more suitable.
There are three main principles that all Southern Cross
Windmills, no matter what pattern or size, have in com-
mon, and they are :—■
An Automatic Oiling System;
The working parts fully enclosed; and
All Mild Steel parts heavily galvanised.
25ft. Southern Cross Seneschal Windmill supplied to Messrs.
H. T. Ward Cr Son, Namban, W.A. This windmill pumps
from a spring and discharges the water into a 26,600 gallon
tank more than a mile away and over 300 feet higher, and
then reticulating through 3 miles of distribution piping,
providing water on 2500 acres of improved pasture.
The advantages of Automatic Oiling are apparent be-
cause they ensure that the windmill is always properly lubri-
cated and will run for long periods without attention. For
the same reason the working parts are all enclosed so as to
prevent rain, dirt, dust, etc., from entering the mill engine
and preventing it from working efficiently; and the effect
of the galvanising is to considerably lengthen the life of
the mill.
The towers for Southern Cross Windmills are strong, cor-
rectly designed structures, made of high-grade steel and
completely galvanised after all fabricating is done, the pur-
pose of this being to ensure a rust-proof structure that will
outlast two or more painted towers.


Southern Cross “Z” Pattern Windmills
Southern Cross “Z” Pattern
Windmills are made in five
sizes: 6ft., Bft., 10ft., 12ft.,
and 14ft. diameter of wheel.
They are, beyond doubt, the
most popular windmill in Aus-
tralia.
Southern Cross "Z" Pattern Windmill.
For Prices, Pumping Capacities,
Weights, Measurements—See Pages
40 and 41.
Some of the Outstanding Features of these Windmills are ;
• Full Enclosure and Dust-proof Construction which ensures
complete protection from weather and dirt and keeps the vital
working parts clean.
• Automatic Oiling which enables twelve months running before
re-oiling.
• Double Balanced Gears.
• Strong Tension Arm Windwheel with Spring Steel Fans.
• Strong Electrically-welded Stub Tower.
• All Steel Parts Heavily Galvanised.

DOUBLE BALANCED GEARS are
used because they are more
efficient than a single gear
and give a balanced lift to
the pumprods without any
side strain. The gearwheels
and pinions are machine
moulded and so have a hard
skin on the surface of the
teeth thus making them very
durable. They mesh together accurately and form a silent
means of transferring the power from the windwheel to the
connecting rods, which lift the pumprods with a direct cen-
tral lift.
The gears work independently of each other; one has a hollow
spindle, the outside of which makes contact with the main
gearwheel bearing, whilst the other has a solid spindle which
works in the inside of the other. This unique arrangement re-
sults in each gearwheel taking an equal share of the load.
GOVERNOR. Governing is by means of the SOUTHERN CROSS
GRAVITY SYSTEM which works automatically and employs
neither springs nor counter balances. It never requires adjust-
ment. The windwheel is set slightly to one side of the mast
pipe so that, as the wind speed increases, the wheel is turned
around in the direction of the vane and thus a smaller area is
exposed to the wind. Then, as the wind speed decreases, the
wheel turns back to its normal position.
The vane hinge is inclined at an angle which makes the vane
rise when governing. This inclination of the vane hinge is de-
signed so that, at the beginning of governing, the rise is not
too steep but becomes steeper as the governing becomes
greater and thereby provides sufficient resistance at any wind
pressure to keep the wheel running at normal pumping speed
and, at the same time, ensure the entire safety of the mill.


BEARINGS. The mainshaft bearings are made
from high quality whitemetal, the front
bearing being made extra long to carry the
weight of the wheel. They are substantial
and extremely durable and, for their pur-
pose, as near frictionless as can be obtained.
The gearwheel bearing is also made of
whitemetal while the connecting rod bear-
ings in the gearwheels are made of cast iron,
which is ideal for the purpose.
Each gearwheel is made with two working
stroke bearings so that, should one wear,
then the other may be used—thus doubling
the life.
TURNTABLE. The wind-
mill rotates on a fixed
pivot tube on top of a
welded stub tower.
The weight of the mill
is carried on smooth
oiled steel sheet turn-
table washers which
provide a very sensitive
and free pivoting turn-
table allowing the mill
to move with the
slightest change in
wind direction.
AUTOMATIC OILING.
Every bearing in the
windmill engine is con-
stantly flooded with
oil, and, as long as the
gearwheels touch the
oil in the gearbox, the
mill will be properly
oiled. The oil is lifted
by the gearwheels and
distributed to the various working parts, the
excess oil draining back into the sump. This
efficient- oiling system is weatherproof, the
helmet fitting tightly down on to the tapered
ledge on top of the gearbox effectively
keeping out any rain or dust. Oil once a year.
WINDWHEEL. The wheel arms are made from
tough steel and, being round, are stronger
than if they were made from the same

Double Gearing may be plainly seen. Notice that

wheel is galvanised.
Fans. These are stiff and strong, being made
out of spring quality sheet and not the

coming off. They are curved to the correct
curvature to give the greatest efficiency and,
like the rest of the wheel, they are galvanised,
These points, combined, produce a very easy
starting wheel which is, in itself, one of the
most important points in any windmill.
VANE. Corrugated galvanised steel sheet stif-
fened by galvanised steel bars and supported
on angular vane arm suitably braced.
STUB TOWER. A welded steel stub tower is
bolted to the top of the mill tower forming
an apex for the tower and making a very
rigid structure and a very convenient attach-
ment for fitting these mills to old towers.
INSPECTION LADDER. An in-
spection ladder, which moves
with the mill when the latter
turns on its turntable, is fitted
to the 1 Oft., 12ft., and 14ft.
sizes of windmills and is a
great convenience. This ladder
is not necessary on the
smaller size mills, as the 6ft.
and Bft. mills can be readily
inspected from the tower plat-
form.
HELMET. A galvanised steel hel-
met fits over the mill engine
and fully protects it from
dust, rain, etc.
REEFING GEAR. The whole of the reefing gear is outside
the mast pipe and is of an extremely simple nature.
There is nothing to adjust, and the mill is reefed by
merely pulling down on the reefing gear as far as it
will go.
GALVANISING. All exposed mild steel parts are heavily
galvanised after cutting and punching. This ensures
that there are no "bare spots" and affords protection
against all weathers.
PUMPING CAPACITIES. See page 41.
THE TOWER. The towers for these mills are described
on Pages 38 and 39.
NEW WINDMILLS ON OLD TOWERS
These windmills can be fitted to any make of tower, either 3-post or 4-post, without extra cost for special parts. There are
a considerable number of windmills twenty years or more old which are wearing out and, generally, it is cheaper to replace
the old mill with a new one on the old tower providing, of course, that the old tower is still in good order, which is often
the case, and almost always the case if the old tower is a galvanised structure.
The prices of the mill heads only (see top of page 40 for prices) are such that, in most cases, the cost of a few major parts
for the old windmill would equal the cost of a new mill.
Southern Cross “Z” Pattern Windmills
SPECIFICATION—(Continued)


Southern Cross “AC” Pattern Windmills
The Southern Cross “AC” Pattern Windmill is a direct acting windmill which is made in one
size only—l 4 feet diameter of windwheel.
Two distinct types of Southern Cross Windmills are made in the 14ft. size—the 14ft. “Z”
Pattern and this 14ft. “AG” Pattern. The distinction (for the reasons set out on page 30) is that
the 14ft. “AC” Pattern Windmill is usually used by graziers where large quantities of water are
required to be pumped into tanks nearby from comparatively shallow depths. On the other hand,
the 14ft. “Z” Pattern Windmill is usually used by farmers for pumping smaller quantities of water
from greater depths or through long pipe lines.
Like all other Southern Cross Windmills, the “AG” Pattern is the result of many years of ex-
perience and research and users have found that it gives the high standard of service which they
have come to expect from all Southern Cross Products. It is made to high standards of engineering
accuracy from high-class materials and is an efficient windmill at a very reasonable price.

makes the vane rise when governing. This in-
clination of the vane hinge is designed so that,
at the beginning of governing, the rise is not
too steep but becomes steeper as the govern-
ing becomes greater and thereby provides
sufficient resistance at any wind pressure to
keep the wheel running at normal pumping
speed and, at the same time, ensure the entire
safety of the mill.
BEARINGS. All the bearings are enclosed in a dust-
proof case and are continually oiled. The
crankshaft bearing is a high quality white-
metal bearing in a removable cast iron sleeve
ensuring easy servicing should replacement
ever become necessary. The crankpin is of
very large diameter and is machined from cast


iron. The crosshead is also a machined grey
iron casting and runs on two bright steel
guides. The pumprod swivel is of hardened
steel.
TURNTABLE. The windmill rotates on a fixed
pivot tube on top of a welded stub tower.
The weight of the mill is carried on smooth
oiled steel sheet turntable washers which
provide a very sensitive and free pivoting
turntable allowing the mill to move with the
slightest change in wind direction.

cated from oil wells which require replenishing only
at each refilling of the mill crankcase.
One filling of crankcase oil is sufficient for one years
use.
CRANKSHAFT is made of strong cold rolled bright steel
and is supported over its whole length between the
wheel hub and the eccentric by the main bearing.
WINDWHEEL. The wheel arms are made from tough steel
and, being round, are stronger than if they were made
from the same weight of a similar grade of flat steel.
The arms are designed so as to be always in tension—
like a bicycle wheel—and make a rigid frame to carry
the fans. The whole wheel is galvanised.

THE TOWER. The towers for these mills are described on
Pages 38 and 39.
NEW WINDMILLS ON OLD TOWERS
Due to the fact that there are numbers of old towers which are quite good but only require a
new windmill head, the Southern Cross “AC” Pattern Windmill has been designed so that the mill
head can be affixed to any make of tower, either 3-post or 4-post.
From the price list for mill heads shown on page 40 it will be readily seen that the cost of a
few major parts for the old windmill would equal the cost of a new mill head, thus making it more
economical to buy a new head.

Southern Cross Seneschal Windmills
The Southern Cross Organisation has pioneered and led windmill construction in Australia, and
with the production of the “Seneschal” Pattern Direct Acting Windmill has built a windmill to much
higher engineering standards than ever previously employed in windmill manufacture.
This windmill is designed and built for heavy duty pumping such as for deep bores, for pumping big
quantities of water, and for pumping water over great distances for stock, irrigation, and town water
supplies.
It is Australia’s outstanding windmill, preferred everywhere for its faithful and reliable service.
The numbers installed by Australian landowners and Government Departments to provide the water
supplies in such remote areas as the Northern Territory, the Kimberleys, and across the Great Aus-
tralian Desert—where machines have to be efficient and reliable—means you can depend on the
Southern Cross “Seneschal”.
The popularity and consequent big demand for ' . *0
the “Seneschal”, combined with a high standard 'WI
of production efficiency at the Southern Cross - Jr •,
Factory, enables you to enjoy the use of the A _ W , m .
“Seneschal” at very reasonable prices. ,Ire- ff
SPECIFICATION
SIZES. 17ft., 21ft., 25ft., and 30ft. diameter of wind-
wheel.
TYPE. Direct Action, Fully Enclosed, every moving part en-
closed in dust and weather-proof case, and entirely
automatically oiled.
STROKES. The standard strokes are ;
Mill 17ft. 21ft. 25ft. 30ft.
Stroke .. .. 7-ins. Si-ins. 91-ins. 12-ins.
Sometimes it may be that the size of the pump which
can be used is limited—for example, by the size of the
casing in the bore —and that the only way to get a
greater average daily supply than can be obtained by
the mill with a standard stroke is to provide a longer
stroke on the mill.
For such purposes, when specially ordered, mills can be
supplied to have the following strokes :
Mill 17ft. 21ft. 25ft. 30ft.
Stroke .. .. 8-ins. 10-ins. 12-ins. 15-ins.
It will be realised, however, that with the longer stroke
the depth from which the mill will pump is correspond-
ingly reduced.

GOVERNOR. Governing is by means of the SOUTHERN
CROSS GRAVITY SYSTEM which works automatically
and employs neither springs nor counter balances. It
never requires adjustment.
The windwheel is set slightly to one side of the mast
pipe so that, as the wind speed increases, the wheel is
turned around in the direction of the vane and thus a
smaller area is exposed to the wind. Then, as the wind
speed decreases, the wheel turns back to its normal
position.
The vane hinge is inclined at an angle which makes the
vane rise when governing. This inclination of the vane
hinge is designed so that, at the beginning of govern-
ing, the rise is not too steep but becomes steeper as the
governing becomes greater, and thereby provides suffi-
cient resistance at any wind pressure to keep the wheel
running at normal pumping speed and, at the same time,
ensure the entire safety of the mill.
BEARINGS. The mainshaft bearing is made of high quality
whitemetal in a machined split removable sleeve which
ensures easy servicing should replacement ever become
necessary. The crankpin bearing is also of high quality
whitemetal. Both the crosshead and pumprod guide are
machined grey iron castings, the crosshead running be-
tween accurately machined V-section guides while the
pumprod guide works on two bright steel guide bars.
The pumprod swivel is of hardened steel. All bearings
are enclosed in dust-proof housings and are continuously
oiled.
TURNTABLE. So as to ensure that the windmills will pivot
freely, they are fitted with Roller Bearing Turntables of
the most modern design and construction. Accurately
made, these Roller Bearing Turntables ensure that the
mills answer quickly to changes in the direction of the
wind, thereby allowing the mills to average a greater
number of pumping hours per day and ensuring that
they start pumping in light winds and swing out of the
wind rapidly in the event of a sudden gust. The rollers
are hardened and move in a chilled race working in an
oil bath, thereby making them very durable. The turn-
table is adjustable both vertically and horizontally for
convenience in plumbing the mill.
WINDWHEEL. Gives maximum starting torque together
with good pumping speed. All wheel parts are heavily
galvanised.
Fans. These are made of galvanised sheet steel. They
are curved to the correct curvature to give the greatest
efficiency, and as they have reinforced edges they are
very rigid. They are riveted to three galvanised steel
angle brackets and the brackets are then bolted between
pairs of wheel rings.
The number of fans in each size windwheel is as fol-
lows :
17ft. 21 ft. 25ft. 30ft.
16 20 24 30
Arms. Each wheel arm is a complete unit without any
bolts. They are built on the cantilever girder principle
and all components are power riveted together. The
whole of the wheel arms are galvanised after fabrica-
tion, and after being riveted together.
Rings. Three pairs of wheel rings ensure the efficient
support of the fans.
VANE. Corrugated galvanised steel sheet stiffened by gal-
vanised steel angles, and supported on tubular vane pole
suitably braced.
21ft. Southern Cross Seneschal Windmill erected on Avon-
dale Station, Gunning, N.S.W. This windmill pumps from
spears under the sand bed of a river to a tank ½ mile away
and 164 feet higher.
MAINSHAFT is made of cold rolled bright steel and is sup-
ported over its whole length between wheel hub and
crank by the main bearing.
CRANK. This is a one-piece casting keyed to the shaft and
locked in position with large locking screws. The crank-
pin is cast integral with the crank and is of ample size.
WHEEL HUB is a strong grey iron casting securely fastened
to the main shaft with two gib head keys driven home
in opposite directions and then locked. Locking screws
are also fitted at right angles to the keys,
CONNECTING ROD is made of cast iron of very strong sec-
tion. Fitted to the big end is a whitemetal die-cast bush
and, at the top, is a special self-aligning cast iron small
end bearing.
MILL PUMPROD is made from Tubular steel.
INSPECTION PLATFORM. An inspection platform is fitted
to the mill engine and moves with the mill when the
latter turns on its turntable so that the mill can be in-
spected with safety irrespective of whether the wind is
gusty or not.
PULLOUT. The mill is pulled out of the wind by means of a
worm type of winch, fastened to the tower near the
ground, which makes the operation an easy and simple
one. A ball bearing swivel is fitted into the reefing chain
to prevent the chain twisting.
PUMPING CAPACITIES. See page 41.
THE TOWER. The towers for these mills are described on
pages 38 and 39.
Southern Cross Seneschal Windmills
SPECIFICATION—(Continued)


Not only does the SOUTHERN CROSS Seneschal Windmill oiling system make it unneces-
sary to climb the tower to re-fill the oil reservoir, but the fact that every bolt in the wind-
wheel and mill engine is fitted with a spring washer, or a cotter, or some other locking device,
makes it unnecessary to climb the tower at all, except at long intervals.
Southern Cross Seneschal Windmills
THE OILING SYSTEM
The Southern Cross System of lubri-
cating the Seneschal Windmill renders
climbing the tower for the purpose of
oiling the windmill unnecessary. There
is no other windmill so thoroughly and
positively oiled.
OILING FROM THE GROUND is
accomplished by means of a hand
pump attached to the tower near the
ground and oil is pumped from there
into the crankcase reservoir in the mill
engine. The oil in the reservoir can
thereby be replenished (which is only
necessary once every twelve months)
without climbing the tower.
From this reservoir in the crankcase
the oil is picked up at each revolution
and is carried automatically and posi-
tively to all the moving parts of the
engine, which consist of the main
shaft, crankpin, crosshead and gud-
geon pin, pump-rod swivel and vane
hinge. The neck bearing at the top of
the tower and the turn-table and
pump-rod guide at the bottom of the
mast pipe are also arranged so as to
be continually running in an oil bath
as they, too, are in the automatic oil-
ing circuit.
The arrows in the diagram at right
illustrate this, and it will be clearly
seen from the illustration that every
moving part is fed by the oiling sys-
tem.
This Oiling System is just as posi-
tive as that of a motor-car engine and
is definitely years in advance of that
of other Direct Action windmill oiling
systems.

A GALVANISED TOWER WILL OUTLAST TWO OR MORE PAINTED ONES
Towers for Southern Cross Windmills
Tower for
Southern Cross "Z" Pattern Windmill.
There are probably very few products in every-day use which
need as much care and knowledge in design as does a tower for a
windmill. It is a continual challenge to a designer’s ingenuity, it must
be strong enough to support the windmill and carry all the stresses
and strains of high wind velocities but must make the very best use
of the materials so that it is not unduly heavy or expensive.
The Southern Cross Organisation was the first in Australia to
supply towers for windmills made from steel so that it will be realised
that in the intervening years a wealth of information has been ac-
cumulated concerning the theoretical and practical aspects of wind-
mill tower design.
This theoretical and practical knowledge gained over the years
lead to the conclusion that only in a three-post tower could be had
all the advantages of good design because it had been found that to
make a four-post tower of the same strength as a standard three-post
Southern Cross Tower required that it be made one-third heavier—
and consequently it would be one-third more in price.
The great strength and stability of a three-post tower is due to
the fact that it stands firmly and equally on all of its legs. When
anchor posts are out of level in a four-post tower it brings undue
strain upon one or more of the corner posts. The same trouble is
likely to arise from unequal setting of the anchor posts due to dif-
ferences in the hardness of the ground under them.
A four-post tower is like a box without ends. It has no strength
in itself, and collapses easily: and this weakness is in the tower when
the wind blows on a corner. It does not matter where the wind blows
on a three-post tower —it is just as strong.
This, then, explains why Southern Cross towers are of three-
post design as standard. So sure are we of the strength of Southern
Cross three-post towers that we warrant them for three years from
delivery, in the terms shown on the inside front cover of this cata-
logue, and no reservation is made regarding storms or tempests—
providing the tower anchorages hold—because the structure is built
to withstand these.
Our designers also realised that it was of little use making a
strong structure if its life was going to be short due to corrosion of
the steel. It was recognised that painting the steel work would pro-
long its life to a certain extent but that, at best, the process could
only be regarded as affording protection of a limited nature as re-
painting would have to be done every year or so if the steel was to
remain protected.
It was therefore decided that the steel should be galvanised as
standard procedure. Galvanising is a process wherein the steel is
coated with rust-resisting zinc. During the process the steel and zinc
fuse together so that the galvanising becomes an integral part of the
steel and will not peel off. Galvanising therefore greatly increases the
life of the tower and is one of the added refinements of Southern
Cross Towers which are obtained without any extra charge.


HEIGHT. Southern Cross Towers are measured from ground level. That is to say, a tower referred to
as 60ft. high is 60ft. above ground level, less leg laps, and has anchor posts and foundation
plates for embedding in concrete in addition.
LEG SECTIONS. All the legs of these towers are made from heavy
section steel angle and, for convenience in transport and erec-
tion, are made in 10ft. and sft. lengths.
GIRTS. The girts are made from heavy section steel angle, except
the top girt for towers for 14ft. “AC” and 17ft. mills, the top
two girts for 21ft. and 25ft. mill towers, and the top four girts
tor 30ft. mill towers, which are made from flat bar.
BRACES. For “Z” Pattern Windmill Towers, the braces are made
from special 80 tons tensile steel rod and will always remain
taut. The material used in the manufacture of this rod is the
same as the material used for making the rope which held up
the Sydney Harbour Bridge before the two sections of the arch
were joined. One of the features of this tower is the room in
the base. Angle braces are used at the bottom of these towers,
as illustrated. They not only give stiffness to this part of the
tower but a large space is left entirely unobstructed by girts
on each side of the tower.
For the “AC” and Seneschal Windmill Towers, the braces are
of galvanised steel angle throughout except for the short
diagonal cross braces at the top of the tower which are made
of flat mild steel.
ANCHOR POSTS. These are supplied with all towers in addition to
the height above ground. They are heavily galvanised after
fabrication just the same as the remainder of the tower.
FOUNDATION PLATES are of galvanised steel angle and are
bolted to the legs.
BOLTS AND WASHERS. All bolts and washers are either gal-
vanised or cadmium plated and are amply strong.
LADDER. The ladder is made from galvanised steel angle with
steel angle rungs and reaches from the bottom girt to the
fixed platform on the tower.
PLATFORM. Is made from first-class hardwood and is suffi-
ciently wide to stand on easily.
ERECTION. Towers for “Z” Pattern Windmills are assembled on
the ground and can be built by anyone by simply following the
erecting instructions supplied with each mill. After being built
on the ground they are then pulled up into position.
Because they are so much heavier, the towers for “AC” and
Seneschal Pattern Windmills are made so that they can be
erected piece by piece, from the ground up, like a steel building.
We recommend that all towers be erected in concrete founda-
tions and not in earth foundations or on wood blocks. Conse-
quently these towers are supplied for erection in concrete
foundations.
FOUR-POST TOWERS. To make a four-post tower of the same
strength as the standard three-post tower requires that the
tower be made one-third heavier than the standard three-post
tower and, consequently, it is one-third more in price. There
is no advantage in paying that extra cost but we will, if de-
sired, supply a four-post tower.

s Seneschal Pattern Windmill.
Southern Cross Windmills
25tt. Southern Cross Seneschal Windmill in-
stalled by the State Rivers and Water Supply
Commission of Victoria at the Murrayville
Consolidated State School and pumping into
three 5000 gallon tanks on Southern Cross
Steel Tankstands.
PUMPING CAPACITIES
The right combination of windmill and pump is always
that which will allow the mill to work easily in light winds.
The pumping table set out below shows the average
daily supply which can be expected from each combina-
tion of windmill and pump up to the depths given, in most
districts in Australia; provided that the windmill is erected
on a sufficiently high tower in a good open site where the
wind can reach the windwheel freely.
There are, however, some districts in which the wind
,is not so strong and, in these, customers should specify a
| larger size of windmill and, in districts where the wind
v does not blow for so many hours per day as the aver-
age, customers should specify a larger size of windmill
and pump than would normally be used.
With a windmill plant it is the regular daily supply that
is important, and greater satisfaction will always be got
from a lightly-loaded windmill.


To Obtain the Most Suitable Size
Southern Cross Pumping Plant
Choosing a pumping plant is an engineering proposition because it is essential to make sure
that every item of the equipment is of the right size in relation to the remainder and is also of the
right type so that the whole can be assembled into the correct plant for the particular job.
It is worth while making sure beforehand that every detail of the plant to be supplied is cor-
rect. Eighty years experience enables us to decide and recommend what will be the most efficient,
and eventually the least costly, equipment for any water supply scheme.
If you will let us have the details set out below we will send you a carefully considered recom-
mendation and estimate for the most suitable plant for your particular purpose.
If the windmill is required to pump from a bore or a well then the following information will need
to be supplied :
1. The depth of the bore or well.
2. The size of the bore casing (outside diameter), or
the size of the well.
3. The distance from ground level to water level.
4. The maximum hourly supply available for pumping.
5. If the water is pumped at the maximum rate of
supply, how far will the water level be below the
ground level then ?
6. The height the top of the tank or reservoir into which
the water has to be pumped is above the ground level
at the pumping site.
7. The distance the tank or reservoir will be placed from
the pumping site.
8. The maximum height of obstructions, if any, in the
vicinity of the pumping site and how far away. If
there is any doubt about the prevailing winds easily
reaching the site, describe the site as fully as possible.
9. The quantity of water required daily. (To estimate
this see below.)
10. What the water is to be used for.
11. The size and type equipment, if any, you already
have which you wish to use on the job if possible.
If the windmill is required to pump from surface water such as a creek, dam, bore drain, or earth
tank, then the following information will be required :
12. The source of supply.
13. The distance along the ground from the water to the
point at which it is proposed to instal the pump.
14. The vertical height from the lowest water level to the
point at which it is proposed to instal the pump.
15. The information asked for in questions 6,7, 8,9,
10, and 1 1 above.
if a new windmill head only is required, then the following information will need to be supplied :
16. Size and make of old mill.
17. Height of old tower above ground level.
18. Whether tower is three or four legged.
19. Size of pump installed.
20. The distance from ground level to the pump.
21. The size of the pump delivery piping or casing.
22. The size and type pumprods being used.
23. Whether' you wish us to supply a connection to con-
nect the new windmill rod to the existing pumprods.
24. The information asked for in questions 1 to 10 in-
clusive above if pumping from bore or well; and ques-
tions 6to 10 and 12 to 14 inclusive if pumping sur-
face water.
HOW TO ESTIMATE THE QUANTITY OF WATER REQUIRED DAILY
To estimate the quantity of water required daily allow :
1 gallon per day per head of sheep.
10 gallons per day per head of cattle or horses.
20 gallons per day per head of dairy cattle.
50 gallons per day per person for domestic use; that is, household purposes, septic tank installations, shower baths,
etc., in an average home.
3000 gallons per day per acre for garden purposes. Thus, if the garden is -4- of an acre, approximately 800 gallons per
day are required. (This is based on providing the equivalent of 1 inch of rain per week over the garden.)
MINIMUM HEIGHTS OF TOWERS
To give the most efficient service it is essential that the lowest portion of the windwheel of the mill should be well
above any obstructions in the vicinity of the plant and also that the windmill should be well above ground level so as to
take advantage of the better wind conditions higher up. We recommend that the following should be the minimum height
towers that should be used with windmills under average conditions though we can supply lower towers for positions where
they will give satisfactory service, such as on exposed hill-tops, or higher towers for positions where they are necessary :
6ft.—2sft, Bft,—3oft, 10ft.—30ft. 12ft.—40ft. 14ft.—40ft. 17ft.—45ft. 21ft.—45ft. 25ft.—55ft. 30ft.—60ft.


Illustrated above are some of the more usual types of Windmill Installations.
These illustrations will help you to more fully understand the questions on the opposite page if you are sending in details
to enable us to recommend a pumping plant for you.


Erection of Southern Cross Windmills
21ft. Southern Cross Seneschal Windmill
discharging into three 5000 gallon tanks
on 30ft. high Southern Cross Steel Tank-
stands—installed for Messrs. T. A. Field
Pty. Ltd., at "Yamma" Station, Morundah,
N.S.W, The shed in the foreground houses
a Southern Cross Generating Set.
An Erecting Instruction Book is supplied with every
Southern Cross Windmill, and anyone familiar with tools
should be able to erect all sizes of “Z” Pattern Windmills
by following the simply-worded and well-illustrated instruc-
tions given there.
For the larger mills, it is advisable to have the services
of an experienced erector. There are competent local men
available in most districts, but, if not, we can send one of
our own erecting staff to do the job and we will quote you
for such work on application. These erectors are also com-
petent to build tanks, lay troughing, piping, etc., erect pump-
heads, and set engines on foundations.
Our charge for this service is based on the number of
days occupied on the job, including travelling time, that is,
the time that the erector is away from our works; plus
fares, travelling expenses and carriage on tools. The cus-
tomer is also required to convey the erector and his tools
from the nearest railway station or public conveyance to
the site of erection and back to the railway station when
the job is finished, and to provide free food, accommoda-
tion, and assistance.
Where jobs for two or more customers are done by an
erector on the one trip we divide up his expenses and
travelling time proportionately to the time spent on each
job but, of course, expenses specially incurred in connec-
tion with a particular job are charged to that job.
Single Purchase Crab Winches
The Southern Cross Single Purchase Crab Winch is de-
signed for erecting windmills and installing or pulling up
pipe and casing and rods. It is also very useful for general
lifting work.
The side frames are substantially made and are of cast
iron. The rope drum has a capacity of 400 feet of Tiin.
circumference rope, and is fitted with a ratchet and pawl
by means of which the drum may be held in any position.
A hand-operated brake regulates the speed when lowering.
The gear and pinion are accurately machine moulded
and are of heavy design. The spindles are extra strong
and the bearings accurately bored.
The winches are supplied as standard with two handles
which fit on either end of the pinion shaft. To facilitate
the handling of a very light load or to haul in slack rope,
the gear and pinion can be thrown out of mesh and a
handle used on the gear shaft, thus affording quicker
winding. The gear and pinion can also be thrown out of
mesh for the lowering of the load, so that the handle
does not revolve.
The capacity of the winches is up to 15cwt. for a
straight lift and, with double and treble pulley blocks, up
to 3 tons.
Single Purchase Crab Winch.

Farm Pump Engines
MARK “J”
The Southern Cross Farm Pump Engine is a combined engine and pump-
jack and can be used as an auxiliary to windmills up to 14ft. in diameter.
It is light and can be moved easily from one pumping site to another.
The engine is of the vertical, air-cooled, four cycle, single cylinder
type, and runs on either petrol or power kerosene. A high tension rotary
magneto is fitted which ensures easy starting and reliability when running.
All parts are standard and interchangeable. The side arms, pumprod
guide and crosshead, as illustrated, are included in the price. There are
no extras to buy.
Installation is easy. Simply bolt to a solid foundation and clamp the
centering clamp to the delivery tubing and the crosshead to the pumprod.
The engine is exceptionally versatile in that the standard centering clamp
will fit any size pipe up to Bin. and the standard crosshead will suit any
round pumprod up to 1 in. outside diameter and Hin. sq. pumprods. In the
odd cases where the engine has to clamp to larger pipe or larger pumprods
then suitable fittings can be supplied at no extra charge.
The engines are supplied as standard with side arms suitable for dis-
charge into tank top Bft. high, or they may be cut and rebored, if desired,
for lower discharge. Extended side arms can be supplied, if required, suit-
able for discharge up to 16ft. above ground.
Lubrication of the engine is arranged by a composite system of oil and
grease lubrication resulting in efficient lubrication of the working parts.
The Southern Cross Farm Pump Engine is an economical unit which
will give excellent service. One of the most important features is that its
construction is so simple that anyone can run it.

Bevel Geared Pump Jacks
MARK “R”
The Bevel Geared Pump Jack is used for the same purposes as a pumphead. It is
particularly suitable for light work such as pumping from shallow wells and makes an excel-
lent belt driven auxiliary to windmills up to and including 14ft. diameter of windwheel.
It has the same capacity as the Farm Pump Engine which is described above since it
uses the same bevel gear wheel, crankpin, pinion, etc., and the working mechanism is built
to the same dimensions generally.

Pumpheads are used for pumping from bores or wells
when an engine driven plant is desirable or necessary. They
are also used as auxiliaries to windmills for pumping from
bores or wells when there is no wind.
Southern Cross Pumpheads are of the heavy duty type.
They are simply designed and strongly made for long and
heavy duty and, consequent on their suitability, the demand
is such that they can be bought at prices which ensure out-
standing value when compared with lighter and cheaper
types of pumpheads.
A major outstanding feature of the Southern Cross Pump-
head is the guide bars provided with pumpheads for low
discharge and the pumprod guide supplied with pumpheads
for overhead discharge. These ensure direct vertical opera-
tion of the pumprods, thereby preventing the pumprods
from wearing on the top of the delivery tubing and saving
undue strain on the pumphead and pumprods. Another fea-
ture is the ability of the pumpheads to be fitted to a wide
range of rising columns and pumprods without special or
extra fittings.
Six types of pumpheads are made which are suitable for
most conditions encountered and, to enable us to recom-
mend which one of these is the most suitable for your par-
ticular purpose, the details asked for in questions 1 to 7
and 9 to 1 1 on page 42 of this catalogue should be speci-
fied.
Pumpheads
Mark DJ Pumpheads
Figs. 2318 and 2154
The Fig. 2318 Pumphead is illustrated at left and is
arranged for overhead discharge into a tanktop Bft. above
ground. The Fig. 2154 pumphead is similar in construc-
tion to the Fig. 2318 but is arranged for low discharge
or for use with a packing box.
The frame is extremely rigid being cast in one piece.
The bearings for both the pinion and gearwheel shafts are
replaceable split whitemetal bearings clamped by a bearing
cap and seated in machined seats. Double gears are fitted,
the gear ratio being 7 to 1. The double gears each take
a share of the load, and the crosshead working on polished
steel guide bars gives a vertical lift to the pumprods, there
being no side strain.
For greater life, the pinions are heat treated steel cast-
ings. Mild steel gearshields cover the teeth of the gears
and pinions.
Fast and loose pulleys are set inside the main frame
between two bearings and a belt guide is provided for
moving the belt from the loose to the fast pulley after
starting up.
Oil boxes are fitted to the four main bearings and to
the pitmans, and provision is made for easy lubrication of
the other parts.
The pitmans are seasoned spotted gum, and the whole
forms a very robust pumphead.

This unit consists of a Mark AX-C Southern Cross
Petrol Engine driving a Mark DJ Pumphead by 4 “A” type
Brammer V-belts, the whole being mounted on a sub-
stantial welded steel base.
The engine is fitted with a 6in. P.C.D. pulley on the
camshaft and the pumphead is fitted with a P.C.D.
pulley. With an engine speed of 1500 r.p.m. this gives a
pumphead speed of 37 strokes per minute.
The Fig. 2640 unit as illustrated includes a Mark DJ
Pumphead for low discharge. The unit, including a Mark
DJ Pumphead for overhead discharge, is known as Fig.
2768.
Fig. 2640 £ll 7/107-

Pump Rod Guides
Fig. 1092
The purpose of a Pump Rod Guide is to ensure that the
pumprods are lifted with a true vertical motion so that they
do not flap from side to side and wear by rubbing against
the top of the delivery tubing.
With every Southern Cross Farm Pump Engine, Pump-
jack and Pumphead for overhead discharge, a Pump Rod
Guide is supplied as standard at no extra charge.
The Fig. 1092 and 1093 Guides are used with Farm
Pump Engines, Pumpjacks and Mark DJ Pumpheads for
overhead discharge. (In the illustration of the Fig. 1092
Guide, the crosshead and pitmans shown are those sup-
plied with Farm Pump Engines and Pumpjacks while the
Fig. 1094
crosshead and pitmans in the illustration of the Fig. 1093
Guide are those supplied with a Mark DJ Pumphead.)
The Fig. 1092 Guide will clamp on to any size piping
from I!in, to Bin., while the Fig. 1093 Guide is used to
clamp on to a 4in. or sin. Tee and Spill Piece. In the
latter case, the split guide flange on top of the Tee and
Spill Piece is replaced by the flange carrying the guide
bars, as shown In the illustration of Fig. 1093.
The Fig. 1094 Guide is designed for Marks DF and DH
Pumpheads. It will clamp on to Sin. Pipe, 4in., Sin. or
6in. Casing, or 4in. or Sin. Tee and Spill Piece. It can,
if required, be also supplied to clamp on to a 6in. Tee
and Spill Piece.

Mark DF pumpheads
The general design of this pumphead is similar to the Mark DJ Fig.
2318 pumphead (see page 46) but it is built for heavier duty.
The frame is made in one piece from cast iron and it houses the
bearings for the pinion and gearwheel shafts, the bearings themselves
being replaceable split whitemetal bearings clamped by a bearing cap and
seated in machined seats. The double gears are strong machine moulded
spur gears and the gear ratio is to 1.
The pinion and gear wheel shafts and the guide bars are made from
bright mild steel shafting while the pitmans are made from first quality
seasoned spotted gum.
The pinions are heat treated steel castings which have a much
greater life than cast iron ones. Mild steel gear-
shields cover the teeth 6f the gears and pinions.
Positive oil lubrication is provided. The main
bearings are lubricated by syphon feed from oil
boxes cast into the frame. Oil boxes are fitted to
the pitman for lubrication of the pitman bearings.
The guide bars are lubricated by oiled felt pads in
the crosshead, which are fed with oil from the
guide bar oil boxes.

Mark DH Pumpheads
These pumpheads are exactly the same
as the Mark D-F (see opposite page) ex-
cept that a balanced walking beam has
been added, the advantage of which is that
it distributes the load evenly over the whole
revolution of the gearwheels.
The load on the engine is practically
constant, the belt tension does not vary on
the up and down strokes, the working of
the whole unit is free from load variations,
and the best use is made of the engine
power. As the capacity table below shows,
the walking beam increases the capacity of
the pumphead by approximately 25%.
These balanced walking beams are ex-
ceptionally robust and will stand up to
hard work.

SPECIAL FEATURE
A special feature of these pumps is that a water by-pass is fitted as standard, to enable
j the engine to be started up free from load. This by-pass is opened before the unit is started
so that some of the water is by-passed from the discharge back into the suction. Then,
when the engine has attained its correct speed, the by-pass is closed and all the water is
pumped along the discharge line.
Geared Self-Oiling Power Pumps
Figs. 2549 and 2550
Fig. 2549
Geared Self-Oiling Power Pumps are used for
delivering comparatively large quantities of
water against high heads from surface supplies
such as creeks, dams, earth tanks, etc., and are
particularly suitable for pumping over long dis-
tances. They are used when an engine driven
plant is desirable or necessary and as auxiliaries
to windmills pumping from surface supplies
when there is no wind.
Whenever a Centrifugal Pump plant is con-
templated the merits of using a Geared Self-
Oiling Power Pump should be investigated be-
cause they are high efficiency pumps and,
although more costly initially than a Centri-
fugal Pump of the same capacity, they will often
be found more economical in the long run be-
cause they use so much less horsepower. Con-
sequently there is a considerable saving in
operating costs and, often, a smaller prime
mover can be used than would be necessary
with a Centrifugal Pump.
All the working parts of Southern Cross
Geared Self-Oiling Power Pumps are fully en-
closed for protection against weather and dirt;
lubrication to all working parts is automatic so
that the pumps can be run unattended for long
periods. Because of these fully-enclosed and
automatically-oiled features, the pumps require
less attention than other types of power pumps
and can be depended on to give years of trouble-
free service.
The pumps are of the single cylinder double
acting type which means that they pump water
on both the forward and backward strokes. This
puts a more constant load on the prime mover,
making them more economical than single-acting
pumps which pump water only on the forward
stroke or the backward stroke.
A wide range of sizes can be supplied as
follows :
Fig. 2549 : 3in., 4in., and sin.
bore x sin. stroke.
Fig. 2550 : sin. and 6in. bore x 6in. stroke;
7in. bore x Sin. stroke.
The maximum head against which these
pumps are designed to work is 300 feet; except
for the Marks AN-H and AN-J, which are de-
signed to operate against maximum heads of
1 50 feet.
PIPE CONNECTIONS. On Fig. 2550 Pumps the suction
and discharge piping may be taken from either side of the
pump, or the suction from one side and the discharge
from the other.
On 2i in. and 3 in. Fig. 2549 Pumps, the discharge is taken
from the pulley side and the suction is taken from the
opposite side. On the larger Fig. 2549 Pumps the dis-
charge is taken from the pulley side and the suction may
be taken from either side.
LUBRICATION. Is adequate and automatic. From the oil
reservoir in the gearbox, oil is carried by the main gear
wheel to the highest point and by a system of channels
is distributed to all moving parts and then returned again
to the reservoir. This system of flood lubrication contributes
to quiet operation and long life with a minimum of atten-
tion.
GEARS. The main gear is of cast iron and the pinion is of
steel. Both gear and pinion are machine cut and have
wide faces.
GEAR RATIOS. The gear ratios are :
5.93 to 1 for the sin. stroke pumps.
6.07 to 1 for the sin. x 6in. and 6in. x 6in. pumps.
5 to 1 for the 7in. x Sin. pumps.

Geared Double Acting Power Pumps
“X” PATTERN
The "X" Pattern Geared Double Acting Power Pump is
arranged for belt drive and is used tor pumping from creeks,
dams, shallow wells, etc.
The body of the pump is made of cast iron into which is
pressed a barrel of drawn brass tubing. The plunger rod is of
drawn brass bar and works in a screwed gland type packing box,
the packing of which is made of graphited rubber packing. Two
pump buckets are fitted to the plunger.
The valve seats are of gunmetal while the valves themselves
are made of special quality rubber and are spring loaded for
returning to their seats.
The gears are of cast iron and are machine cut. Connecting
rods are of mild steel with whitemetal bushes fitted in each end.
The main bearings are long and are of cast iron. They are
well lubricated with felt pads in large oil wells.
A 1 Sin. diameter x 3in. face flat belt pulley is fitted as
standard. The maximum speed at which this pulley is driven
is 233 r.p.m. which, with the gear ratio of 14 to 3, gives a
plunger speed of 50 double strokes per minute.
A large capacity Air Chamber is fitted, as standard, to each
pump.
Four 6in. x |-in. holding-down bolts are supplied with each
pump and are included in the price.
SPECIAL FEATURE
A special feature of these pumps is that a water by-pass is fitted to enable the engine to be started up free from
load. This by-pass is opened before the unit is started so that some of the water is by-passed from the discharge back into
the suction. Then, when the engine has attained its correct speed, the by-pass is closed and all the water is pumped along
the discharge line.
Where a more compact installation is required than is obtainable when using flat belt drive these pumps can be
supplied coupled to a Southern Cross Engine by V-belts and mounted on a steel base. For further particulars see page 58.
Double Acting Hand Pumps
“X” PATTERN
The "X" Pattern Southern Cross Double Acting Hand Pump is altogether
superior to other hand pumps, as it is really a power pump adapted for hand
purposes.
The pump is the "X" Pattern Power Pump described above but arranged
for operation with a handle instead of pulley and connecting rods for power drive.
Whereas most other makes of pumps have ordinary cast iron cylinders,
the cylinder of this pump is fitted with a liner of seamless brass barrel. The
plunger rod and packing nut are of brass, and the valve seats are of gunmetal.
The valves are of rubber and are spring loaded for returning to their seats. The
handle is made of good quality hardwood of convenient length.
Four 6in. x lin. holding-down bolts are supplied with each pump and are
included in the price.
The whole pump is particularly efficient and of first-class design and
construction.
The Air Chamber illustrated on the pump is not part of the standard pump
out, if required, it can be supplied for 43/6 extra.

CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS
The Engine . . . The Pump . . and the Water
The illustrations above show a lOin. Centrifugal Pump being driven by a 40 B.H.P. Southern Cross Diesel Engine installed
for Uabba Pty. Ltd., Uabba, Lake Cargelligo, N.S.W. The discharge is at the rate of 2,200 gallons per minute (i.e., over
3 million gallons every 24 hours) .
Southern Cross Belt-Driven Centrifugal Pumps are made in two distinct types—the “AQ” Pat-
tern for low and medium heads and the “AR” Pattern for medium and high heads.
These pumps are single stage pumps fitted with Deep Groove Ball Bearings of liberal capacity
capable of carrying both radial and thrust loads. They are suitable for all general purposes.
They are simple and durable and the few moving parts ensure long and trouble-free life. Be-
cause of their high efficiency less horsepower is required to drive them and so they are more
economical in running costs. Like all other Southern Cross products they are made to the highest
standards of engineering workmanship.
SPECIFICATION
Southern Cross Belt Driven Pumps—l in. to 4in.
TYPE. Belt d riven, single stage.
CASING. The casing is of high grade cast iron of the
volute type carefully proportioned to convert the high
velocity impeller discharge into useful pressure at the out-
let with a minimum loss of efficiency. It is secured to the
pedestal by a swivelling trunion and may be adjusted to
ANY angle to suit the discharge pipe
connection. The suction cover is strongly
ribbed and is easily removed thereby
providing a clear opening to the whole
of the casing. Tapped holes are pro-
vided around the circumference of the
casing so that the pump may be easily
primed no matter what angle in which
the discharge lies.
IMPELLER. The impeller is of high-grade
cast iron and is of the single suction
closed type, the openings being suffi-
ciently large to allow the passage of any
small solids which may be passed by
normal suction strainers. A balancing
chamber is provided to equalise end
thrust. The impeller, which is secured to
the spindle by a key and lock nut, is statically balanced
to ensure smooth running.
PACKING BOX. The packing box is of ample size and is
fitted with graphite packing as standard.
SPINDLE. The spindle is of large diameter bright steel and
is accurately machined and ground to size thereby eliminat-
ing vibration.
BEARINGS. The radial and thrust loads
are carried on two liberal size deep
groove ball bearings which are ade-
quately protected against the entry of
moisture, grit, etc. These bearings need
to be lubricated about once each year
only—dependent on the service and
location of the pump.
WATER THROWER. A large brass water
thrower prevents water from creeping
along the spindle into the bearing
housings.
BASE. The base is substantially de-
signed of cast iron in one piece to carry
the pump and bearings. The base is of
box section and is fitted with a tapped
hole into which a iin. pipe can be

Centrifugal Pumps
The sizes of Centrifugal Pumps made by the Southern
Cross Organisation are those listed on this and the opposite
page, but we can supply larger sizes if required.
The larger pumps which we supply combine, as far as
possible, economy and efficiency. With large centrifugal
pumps of equal size there can be large differences in the
prices and large differences in the pump efficiencies.
With our experience we can recommend the make of
pump which will offer the best value for the work to be
done from the viewpoint of cost and efficiency combined
and we will be glad to give you the benefit of our know-
ledge and experience on receipt of particulars of the work
to be done.

Southern Cross Belt Driven Pumps—l in to 4in.
screwed to drain away water from the gland. The method
of fastening the base to the foundation by three bolts,
instead of the normal four, assists in preventing distortion.
CONNECTIONS. Of the "AQ" Pattern Pumps, the 4in.
size is flanged for the suction. Other sizes are screwed
for the suction.
Of the "AR" Pattern Pumps, the 1 in. size is the only
size screwed for the suction, all the other sizes being
flanged.
On both types of pumps, the discharge is flanged.
Screwed companion flanges, with gaskets and bolts, are
supplied with the pump where the suction or discharge is
flanged.
SOUTHERN CROSS Centri-
fugal Pumps are designed
with special features which
cannot be incorporated in
cheaper pumps.
Ball Bearings—for reduced
friction losses and longer
bearing life.
Comparatively slow speed
operation which means
greater efficiency and
longer life.
PULLEYS. As shown in the prices tables at the bottom of
this and the opposite page, the pumps are supplied with
a flat belt pulley as standard. However, if required, the
pumps can be supplied with a V-belt pulley, instead of
the standard flat belt pulley, at a slightly higher cost.
It will be noted that the pulleys are not overhung but are
supported between the bearings so that bending stresses are
not set up in the spindle because of the belt tension.
To enable the pumps to be started up free from load, a
gate valve should be installed in the discharge line as
close as possible to the pump. This valve is closed when
starting up and then opened gradually when the prime

T° enable us to help you decide what Is the best centrifugal pumping plant for any part-cular purpose we need to know :
11) The quantity of water required per hour.
12) The height you intend placing the pump above water
level.
13) The length of suction pipe, and size if on hand.
(4) The length of discharge pipe, and size If on hand.
(5> The total vertical height from the pump to the point of
discharge.
(6) Whether or not the pump is required for spray irrigation.
A centrifugal pump should always be installed on a solid and firm foundation as near the water as possible
under no circumstances attempt a suction head of more than 18ft., including friction.

Pumping from Artesian Bores which have ceased to flow,
or nearly so
"CL" Pattern Cylinder Pump with Suction
Box, By-Pass and Suction Chamber
The "CL" Pattern Cylinder Pump, as illustrated,
is used for pumping from non-flowing bores and if,
as is usual, a Suction Chamber is necessary for the
particular installation then a Suction Box with Suc-
tion Chamber can be supplied as an extra.
"CL" Pattern
Cylinder Pump
When installing these pumps it is desirable to sink a shaft round the
casing to sufficient depth and there concrete the bottom and cut oft the
bore casing. As the average loss of head in artesian bores is about two
feet per year the windmill to be installed must be of sufficient size to
allow for the increasing head so that in eight or ten years it will not be
overloaded.
For pumping from bores which are still flowing a little the pump is
supplied with suction box and by-pass and, in this case, the pump acts
as a "booster". The by-pass is fitted so that when the pump is not work-
ing the free-flowing water can flow through this by-pass. When the pump
commences to work the valve on the by-pass automatically closes on each
up-stroke of the pump.
Should a suction chamber be necessary, such as when smaller suction
casing than that recommended is used, then a suction box fitted with suc-
tion chamber, as well as by-pass, can be supplied.
In the by-pass assembly the valve seat is of gunmetal, while the
valve is also of gunmetal but with a Novasteen facing.
The discharge from the pump can be led into the drains or, what is
better, into a built-up earth tank of large capacity, from which a steady
flow through the drains can be maintained by means of a pipe and
valve.
"CL" Pattern Cylinder Pumps are also used for pumping from wells,
creeks, rivers, etc., for irrigation and other purposes, when a pump of
larger diameter than 6in. is needed.
The supplies from artesian bores generally are decreasing, and many of them have ceased flow-
ing. The cessation is caused, usually, not by any diminuation in the volume of water available in the
bore but by a reduction of pressure or head, so that in such cases there is just the same supply of
water a few feet below the surface as there was flowing over the top before.
Having the big supply available, and drains, etc., already made, it is desirable to run the water
as far as possible over the country it used to cover. The Southern Cross "CL" Pattern Cylinder Pump
operated by a 25ft. or 30ft. SOUTHERN CROSS Seneschal Windmill is very suitable for this duty.
For instance, a 30ft. Seneschal on the long stroke, operating a 12in. pump, will pump about
69,000 gallons on an average per day against a total head of 35ft. This, of course, is in addition to
any water which may be delivered through the by-pass, if fitted, and if the bore is still flowing.
The pumps are made in four sizes : Bin., 10in., I2in., and Min. inside diameter barrel. Two
special Rubber Composition Buckets (which are suitable for either hot or cold water) are fitted.
The pumps are of very solid construction. The barrel is of gunmetal and the top and bottom
caps are of cast iron. The plunger valve assembly and bottom valve assembly are made of first quality
gunmetal, while the stirrup plunger connection is made of aluminium bronze which gives high ten-
sile strength.
The top of the pump is screwed internally for the discharge casing. If the suction casing has a
good thread then a bottom cap, screwed internally, can be supplied but, if the thread is damaged or
there is no thread, then a special clamp-on casting, with a ring of Packing to ensure air tightness,
can be supplied instead of the bottom cap.
In all sizes, the plunger connection is drilled for 2in. wood rods. 25in. stroke pumps can be supplied at an extra charge, U
required.
b * These alternative screwings should only be employed where it is necessary to connect a pump to that size casing already in a
e. where these screwings are used, however, a Suction Box and Suction Chamber must also be used.

Syphon Pumps are usually in-
stalled for pumping from surface
supplies such as creeks, rivers,
dams or earth tanks. They con-
sist of a single acting single buc-
ket brass pump enclosed in a
cast iron body. By means of the
syphon construction the plunger
and bottom valve are always sub-
merged in water, which avoids
priming.
While it is an advantage tc
place the pump as close as pos-
sible to the source of supply, if
sufficiently large suction piping
is used, the pump may be as
much as 200 or 300 feet away.
The suction lift, however, must
not be more than 18ft. including
friction and, LIKE ALL OTHER
PUMPS, THE NEARER THE
PUMP IS TO THE WATER. THE
MORE EFFICIENT IT WILL BE.
These pumps are suitable for
Southern Cross Syphon Pumps
“E” Pattern
Fig. 965 Fig. 789
"E" Pattern
lifts up to 150 feet and with
windmills up to and including
14ft. diameter of windwheel.
The pumps can be arranged
for either side delivery or ver-
tical discharge, the price of both
being the same.
The Side Delivery Pump (as
illustrated in Fig. 789) is fitted
with a Packing Box and is for
use where the water has to be
pumped to a point higher than
the pumping unit.
The Vertical Discharge Pump
(Fig. 965) is designed for use
where the tank into which the
water is being pumped is suffi-
ciently below the highest point
to which the spill pipe can be
taken up the tower. The Vertical
Discharge Pump should be used
in preference to the Side Delivery
Pump in every case where a
Packing Box is not essential.
Southern Cross Heavy Duty Syphon Pumps
“AD” Pattern
The “AD” Pattern Heavy Duty Syphon Pump is for use with 17ft. windmills or
larger, or with a smaller mill where the head is greater than 150 feet. It is made in
the same sizes as the “E” Pattern (and one larger size—6in.), but is made for side
delivery only.
The Pumps differ from the standard “E” Pattern Syphon Pumps in that they
have a brass plunger fitted with two leather buckets, have a heavier plunger rod, and
either a differential tube type or a bolted gland type packing box. When for use with
17ft. and larger windmills the body also has attachments on the side to take tubular
stays between the pump and the windmill turntable to prevent the pump from lifting
under the heavy duty.
Prices of these pumps will be quoted on application.

Southern Cross Draw Plunger Pumps
“AE” Pattern
“AE” Pattern Draw Plunger Pumps
are specially designed for use in sub-
artesian bores in which the water has
to be pumped a vertical height not
exceeding about 300 feet, but they
are also very suitable for wells.
The particular advantage of this type of
pump is that, by using delivery piping or
casing of larger diameter than the pump bar-
rel, all working parts (including the bottom
valve assembly) can be withdrawn without
disturbing the delivery tubing. Consequently
the higher initial cost of this pump will be
more than off-set by the time and labour
saved when servicing the pump. For that rea-
son we recommend that this type of pump
should be used in bores or wells in preference
to any other, particularly when the depth ex-
ceeds 100 feet.
To withdraw the working parts of the pump
it is only necessary to disconnect the rods
from the windmill or pumphead and lower
them until the plunger rests on the screwed
portion of the bottom valve assembly and give
the rod a few turns. This will lift both valves
off their seats and allow the water in the
pipes to flow back through the valves before
withdrawing is commenced. The working parts
can then be withdrawn without having to lift
the whole weight of water in the pipe. THIS
FEATURE WHICH SOUTHERN CROSS PUMPS
ALONE POSSESS also avoids the leathers

spreading out under the weight of water,
jambing in the pipe joints, and turning in-
side out.
In a similar manner it is possible to flush
out any foreign matter obstructing the valves
without pulling the whole pump to the surface.
Another IMPORTANT FEATURE of the
Southern Cross Draw Plunger Pump is that the
bottom valve is devised to prevent it from
turning in its cage when screwing the plunger
assembly on or off.
Heavy seamless brass barrel is used and It
screwed externally at both ends so that the
brass caps screw on to the outside of the bar-
rel. The Top Cap is screwed internally for
delivery piping in pumps up to and including
the 2-|-in. size but is screwed externally for
delivery casing in the three larger sizes. THE
BARREL IS RECESSED SO AS TO FACILITATE
SCREWING THE PLUNGER ASSEMBLY ON
TO THE BOTTOM VALVE ASSEMBLY WHEN
WITHDRAWING.
On sizes up to 2£in. the plunger is fitted
with two pump buckets —one leather and one
rubber composition. On larger sizes three pump
buckets are fitted—two leather and one com-
position. The bottom valve assemblies are
fitted with one leather bucket which keeps
the assembly tightly in place.
Materials and workmanship are of the
highest quality, and, in design, this pump is
a great advance on anything produced any-
where to date.

Southern Cross Flush Cap Pumps
“L” PATTERN
These are single acting pumps for use in
a BORE with windmill, engine, or hand
pumping plants where a lower priced pump
than the “AE” Pattern Draw Plunger Pump
is desired.
The pumps are designed to give long
service and are of very substantial con-
struction. Heavy seamless brass barrel is
used.
The outside diameter of the caps are
flush with the outside diameter of the bar-
rel, and hence the name “Flush Cap”. The
idea of this is to allow a pump of larger
diameter to go down a bore than would
do so if the caps were larger in diameter
than the barrel.
The Ifin. pump is an exception to this
rule in that, in order to give sufficient
strength where the pipe screws into it, the
cap projects about beyond the barrel.
The valves are of the disc pattern de-
signed to prevent sticking and are made
wholly of gunmetal. The seats are of brass.
Two leather buckets are fitted as
standard. The plunger rod is made of solid
drawn brass rod.

Pattern
Southern Cross Screwed Cap Pumps
“V” PATTERN
Like the “L” Pattern Flush Cap Pump,
these are also single acting pumps for use
in a BORE with windmill, engine, or hand
pumping plants. They are, however, of
lighter construction than the Flush Cap
Pump and are designed for heads up to
1 50 feet.
The barrel is of seamless brass and all
castings are made of brass. The plunger
valve is leather faced and the seat is of
brass. The bottom valve is a brass disc
with wings cast on as guides and it seats
on to a leather washer fitted between the
barrel and the cap.
One leather pump bucket is fitted and
the plunger rod is made from solid drawn
brass rod.

These pumps are recommended for use
in country where supplies are pumped
from wells and where it is desired to in-

Two leather-faced bras? disc valves
are fitted and, with the exception of
these leather valve facings and the two
leather pump buckets, all parts are made
of brass. The side bolts, of which there
are three, have an anti-turn head so that
they will not turn while the nuts are
being unscrewed,

Tee and Spill Pieces
At the top of every delivery column of a cylinder pump it is necessary to
provide a tee to take the discharge pipe and, except in the case of packing box
installations, a spill to prevent the water spilling over the top of the column.
Southern Cross Tee and Spill Pieces are made for both piping and casing.
FOR PIPE DELIVERY COLUMNS.
Fig. 723
In the case of pipe columns a Fig. 723 Tee and Spill Piece is used. This consists of a galvanised
tee-piece with a short length of piping screwed into the top as the spill piece. The discharge out-
let of the tee may be either the same size as the delivery pipe from the pump or, where it will
not cause excessive friction, it may be smaller.
For 2-J in. pipe with 2-2-in. discharge 25/6
For Bin. pipe with Bin. discharge 37/
Tee pieces for a reduced discharge can be supplied at no extra charge, if specified.

FOR CASING DELIVERY COLUMNS.
For Casing Delivery Columns either of three types is available ;
"CE" Pattern
First, there is the "CE" Pattern Combined Tee and Spill Piece which
is used where the vertical delivery tubing can be carried sufficiently
high above ground level to place the tee and horizontal discharge pipe
above the level of the tank top so that the water will gravitate to the
tank. This is screwed internally so as to screw on to the discharge
casing and has split flanges at the top which act as a guide for the
pumprod. The tee outlet is flanged and has a screwed companion
flange to take the discharge pipe.
"CF" Pattern
Second, there is the "CF" Pattern Combined Tee and Packing Box
which is used when required to deliver water to a higher level than it
is practicable to locate the tee. This type differs from the "CE" Pat-
tern Combined Tee and Spill Piece in that, instead of the split guide
flanges at the top, a cap incorporating a Packing Box is used. The
gland nut is of brass, the rod of bright steel and first quality packing
is used.
Fig. 726
Then there is the Fig. 726 Clamp-On Tee which is made for sin.,
6in., and Sin. casing and which is clamped by two stout U-shaped clips
over a hole cut in the casing, sheet rubber insertion packing being
used to ensure water tightness. The companion flange may be screwed
for any size piping or casing up to and including 6in.

Packing Boxes
"DC"
Pattern
“DC” PATTERN GLAND TYPE PACKING BOX
With the exception of the packing, the whole of the "DC" Pattern Packing Box is made
of brass. Ample room is provided for the graphited rubber packing used, and the rod is of
large diameter.
This type of packing box should be installed in preference to the Tube (or Differential)
Type, particularly when used in connection with a windmill. Unlike the tube type it does not
discharge water on the downstroke—and windmills are not made to pump on the downstroke.
A packing box is used at the top of the pump delivery column when the water has
to be forced to a point higher than it is practicable to employ the usual method of over-
head discharge.
Of the two methods of discharge—overhead or open discharge, and packing box
discharge—the overhead or open discharge is preferable and this can often be done in
a windmill installation by erecting a higher tower than would otherwise be installed.
Where a packing box is necessary, however, a Southern Cross will give the best
results.
“AC” PATTERN TUBE (OR DIFFERENTIAL) TYPE PACKING BOX
This consists of a brass plunger fitted with two inverted leather buckets working inside a heavy gauge
brass barrel. The barrel screws into a brass cap which is screwed externally. The packing box is designed so
that it fits inside the delivery tubing thereby being shielded from the sun and ensuring longer life of the buckets.
The maximum head for this type of packing box must not exceed 30ft. with "Z" Pattern Windmills or
1/3rd of the rated head of "AG" or Seneschal Pattern Windmills.
"AC"

Spears
These spears are screwed on to the end of the suction pipe and act as strainers thus enabling water to
be pumped from sandy water-bearing country.
In order to provide ample water, not only when the spear is first installed but after it has been in use
for some time, it is common practice to install a spear one size larger than the suction pipe.
Several spears connected to branches of the one suction pipe should be installed, if necessary, in order
to get more water by drawing from a greater area of country.
The Fig. 729 Spears illustrated are mostly used with windmills but are suitable for other pumping plants
where the capacity does not exceed the quantities shown in the table.
The body of the spear is made from galvanised piping drilled with -|-in. diameter holes and covered with
60 mesh brass gauze and 26 gauge perforated brass sheer. The point is of cast iron.
Larger spears (called Irrigation Spears) with capacities up to approximately 20,000 gallons per hour
can be supplied. Specifications and prices of these will be quoted on request.

Air Chambers
“OC” AND “BY” PATTERN
When using a plunger pump forcing water through a discharge line
200 feet or more long, it is essential to fit an Air Chamber of large capacity
as close as possible to the pump or discharge tee, so that an even flow of
water with less friction—and consequently less wear and tear on the pump-
ing plant—will result.
Southern Cross Air Chambers are made in five sizes as listed below.
The “BY” Pattern are made from solid drawn tubing with welded domed
ends and are fitted with a drain plug at the bottom. This description (and
the illustration) does not apply to the Mark “OC” Air Chamber which is
made of Wrought Iron Tubing.
A check valve must always be fitted on the discharge side of the Air
Chamber to prevent the water in the pipe running back when the plug in the
air chamber is opened for draining. It is also advisable to fit a check valve
on the inlet side of the air chamber in order to relieve the pump valves of
the pressure of the chamber.

Windmill is used in conjunction with a
Syphon Pump, a suction chamber must
be installed on the suction pipe close to
the pump.
With Geared Windmills and Syphon
Pumps, a suction chamber must be used
if the pump is to be installed more than
300 feet distant from the water.
A suction chamber has two main pur-
poses ;
(1) To act as a reservoir and help supply
water which will flow immediately
behind the plunger on the up-
stroke of the pump—and so pre-
vent water hammer.
(2) To provide a cushion for gradually
stopping the movement of the
column of water in the suction pipe
at the end of the up-stroke of the
pump—which can cause water
hammer if not cushioned.
The necessary Suction Chamber is not
expensive and is an economical insur-
ance against the possibility of water
hammer occuring and perhaps damaging
the pump. The illustration shows how a
suction chamber should be connected to
a syphon pump.

Pumprods
Everyone who has had experience with pumping plants knows the necessity
for pumprod joints that are thoroughly reliable and easily connected and
disconnected when being lowered or withdrawn.
“Southern Cross” has evolved such joints in the “CB” Pattern Steel “Quick-
Action” Joint and the Manganese Bronze “Quick Action” Joint.
With “CB” Pattern Steel “Quick-Action” Joints.
The “CB” Pattern “Quick-Action” Joint is MACHINED out of solid bright
steel thereby ensuring an accurate and neat fit.
Fig. 2718 A shows the joint as it appears when open and Fig. 2718 as it
appears when closed, from which it will be seen that it is connected simply
by putting the two halves of the joint together and sliding the collar over
to lock them; the joint is uncoupled by the reverse process.
These joints can be supplied with either Galvanised Mild Steel Rods, Gal-
vanised Pipe Rods, or Square Hardwood Rods, depending on the class of
work which they have to do. For our recommendation as to the correct
type and size rods to use with any particular installation see opposite page.
Where Southern Cross Solid Mild Steel or Pipe Rods are used, they are
GALVANISED after manufacture which lengthens their life considerably.
The joints are also galvanised when used with wooden rods.

Best service will result if these rods and joints are used as recommended on
Page 69.
The joints are made of Manganese Bronze which is a particularly strong alloy
and are readily connected and disconnected in a similar way to the “CB” Pattern
Steel “Quick-Action” Joint.
The Fig. 2720 combination of wood rods and Manganese Bronze “Quick-Action”
Joints is strong, light, and durable and not liable to corrosion.
With Screwed Joints and Galvanised Couplings.
Fig. 2719
This type of pumprod and joint is also stocked.
The rods are made from round mild steel and are heavily galvanised. They are
screwed Whitworth Thread, and the Coupling is made from Steel Rod heavily
galvanised.

Combinations of Pumprods and Joints
The following recommendations will be Helpful in choosing Pumprods and Joints which will be the correct size and
type in relation to vhe remainder of the equipment and, consequently, will give the best service.
Where Farm Pump Engines, Pump Jacks and Pump Heads are used, the sizes of Pumprods and Joints to be installed
are generally those which would have been installed if a windmill was being supplied to do the work.
In no cases, however, must smaller Pump Rods than those recommended below be used.
Details of the various numbered combinations are set out on opposite page.

A Connection is required at the top of every string of pump-
rods to connect the pumprods to the windmill rod; and a connection
is also required at the bottom of the pumprods to connect them to
the plunger rod of the pump. The table below shows the connec-
tions necessary for use with windmill pumping plants where a Tee
and Spill Piece is used.
For use with Pumpheads the same connection is required at
the pump as for the relative size windmill pumping plant but, if
Connections

the pumphead is arranged for overhead discharge, no connection at
all is necessary at the top of the rods as they are held by the Cross-
head Clamp of the Pumphead.
When a Packing Box, such as a "DC** Pattern Packing Box or
a "CF” Pattern Tee and Packing Box, is used in the installation, a
connection is necessary to connect the top of the pumprods to the
bottom of the packing box rod and another connection to connect
the top of the packing box rod to the mill rod.

Galvanised Piping and Fittings
Under normal conditions large quantities of all sizes of
piping and fittings are stocked, and prompt delivery can
be given.
Unless otherwise stated, quotations for piping are for
screwed and socketed stock lengths which vary from about
17ft. to 21ft. If special lengths are required the cost of
cutting and screwing is charged extra.
There is a right size of piping for every job and it is the
right size only that should be used as a pipe too small will
be unsatisfactory, while one too large will be unneces-
sarily expensive. We will gladly advise you on this subject
on receipt of particulars of the purpose for which the pipe
is required.
For example, if the pipe was needed for gravitating
water we would need to know the length of the proposed
pipe line, the fall in feet from the source of supply to the
point of discharge, and the number of gallons per hour re-
quired at the end of the line.
Illustration (1) shows a length of screwed and socketed
pipe.
The next three illustrations show fittings tor changing
the direction of the water. (2) is a Spring Bend which
allows a 45° change in direction; (3) is an M. Cr F. Bend
and (4) an Elbow, both of which give a 90° change. Be-
cause of its greater radius, and consequently lower fric-
tion, the Bend (3) should be used in preference to the
Elbow (4).
The next four fittings (5-8) are used when water has
to be diverted to two or more branches. (5) is a Tee while
(6) is a Reducing Tee —the difference being that in (5)
all the outlets are of the same size whereas in the Reduc-
ing Tee (5) one of the outlets is smaller than the others.
The Cross (7) is used when three branches have to be
taken off. The Y-Piece (8) allows two branches to be taken
off at an angle.

Fig. 632
FOR PIPING AND CASING
Fig. 632-
Fig. 632 Casing Lowering Tools, which are screwed externally, are used for lower-
ing the casing which lines a bore and should form part of the equipment of every
water-boring plant. Fig. 632 Pipe Lowering Tools are used for lowering or raising the
pipe delivery columns of Draw Plunger Pumps.
Fig. 2000—
For raising or lowering the casing delivery columns of Draw Plunger Pumps, Fig.
2000 Lowering Tools are used. They are screwed internally to match the top of the
pump casing, which is screwed externally.
(9), (10) and (II) are fittings for joining pipes— (9)
being a Socket and (10) a Reducing Socket so as to con-
nect two pipes of unequal diameters. The Union (11) is
another means of joining pipe which has the advantage of
allowing the pipe to be uncoupled at the union. There-
fore, on long pipe lines, one of these unions should be used
at about every 500 feet throughout the length. The Bush
(12) is used to connect an external thread to a larger
internal thread.
Nipples are used to connect internal threads. (13) is
the plain Nipple but the Hex. Nipple (14) is more often
used as it allows a spanner to be used on it. (15) is a
Reducing Hex. Nipple.
The Flanges (16) are used in pairs to connect pipes to-
gether or to connect pipe to a flanged connection on a
pump, etc. (17) is a short piece of pipe with a long thread
on one end and is known as a Longscrew. (18) is a Back-
nut. The Plug (19) and the Cap (20) are used at the
end of open pipes when necessary.

Water Bore Casing
The Southern Cross Organisation is the largest
retailer of Bore Casing in Australia. AM sizes of
casing can be supplied and large stocks of 4in.,
sin., and 6in. sizes, both black and galvanised,
are maintained in all Southern Cross Depots.
The vast experience which the Southern Cross
Organisation has had in building Water Boring
Plants, and in boring, enables us to know the
most suitable casing to supply for any particu-
lar conditions. Buyers can be sure, therefore,
that we stock and sell only the very best bore
casing, which will give many years of service.
The casing supplied by us is SOLID DRAWN
from billets of high-grade steel, and all lengths
are straight. The threads are cut accurately, are
interchangeable, and are protected for transport
by heavy screwed rings and nipples.
Black casing is normally supplied for use in
lining bores, while Galvanised casing is usually
used inside the black casing for the discharge
columns of large Draw Plunger Pump outfits.

can be supplied when required.
Standard perforations are four rows of holes at lOin. centres—the diameters of the holes being
iin. for 4in. casing, 9/16in. for Sin. casing, and 11/16in. for 6in. casing.
Perforating is charged for at the following extra rates :
4in. Casing 10/- per length
Sin. Casing 12/6 per length
6in. Casing 15/- per length
CASING FITTINGS
When required, we can supply all standard casing fittings such as Nipples, Adaptors, or
Sockets.

“CW” Pattern Pressed Clamps for Pump Tubing (Piping)
These clamps are made to hold the pump delivery piping.
They are accurately forged in “dies” so that they are a good
tight fit on the piping. They are made with two bolts of ample
diameter and will hold up to 150-200 feet of pipe. These
clamps are also used for clamping long pipe lines between the
pump and the tank so that expansion and contraction of the
pipe will not force the pump out of plumb or damage the tank.
“CW” Pattern Pressed Clamps for Pump Tubing (Casing)
These clamps are designed to hold the casing delivery
columns of pumps. They are similar to the “CW” Pattern
Pipe Clamps and are capable of holding up to 150 feet of
Casing. They are fitted with two bolts of ample diameter,
except the 6in. size, which has 4.
“CX” Pattern Pressed Clamps for Bore Casing
For holding the casing which lines a bore, a longer clamp
than the “CW” Pattern Clamp is required and so the “CX”
Pattern is used. They are accurately forged in “dies” so that
they are a good tight fit and are capable of holding up to 150
feet of casing. Two bolts are fitted to the 4in. and sin. sizes
and 4 bolts to the 6in. size.
“DW” Pattern Medium Forged Clamps
“DW” Pattern Medium Forged Clamps are forged from
heavy section steel and machined out to a true circle so that
they grip the casing without any tendency to crush it. They
have two large diameter bolts and will hold up to 500 feet of
casing. This style of clamp is also made for holding and
Bin. pipe columns up to 500 feet.
“DX” Pattern Heavy Forged Clamps
Of similar construction to the “DW” Pattern, the “DX”
Pattern Heavy Forged Clamps are of even heavier section suit-
able for artesian or very deep sub-artesian bores. They are
machined to fit the casing and will carry any length that is
used. With the exception of the sin. size which is fitted with
2 bolts, they are fitted with 4 bolts of large diameter.


Tank Washout Plugs
Fig. 2329
The Tank Washout Plug is made primarily for
fitting to Mound Ring Type Tanks. The outlet is
Bin. in diameter and permits quick flushing of
the water when the tank is being cleaned. The
plug and seat are made of brass and packed with
rubber insertion. The discharge pipe and flange
for riveting and soldering to the bottom of the
tank are made of 22G. Galvanised Sheet.

over two corrugations of iron instead of one and
are made for larger size pipes. They are bolted
on to the tank, and 4 feet of 6in. Felt Packing
is supplied with each flange to make a water-

Tank to Trough
Connecting
Pipes
For a tank on a steel or wooden
stand the No. 1 type is the best,
and is generally used. The pipe
comes out of the bottom of the
tank and runs underground to the
trough. With tanks built on a
Mound Ring the No. 3 type is
generally used; and the No. 5 is
the right type for an Improved
Bolted Type Tank since the tee and
plug shown serve to drain the water,
below the level of the float valve,
from the tank. Types 2 and 4 can
also be used for tanks on stands but
are not recommended since, if they
are used, stock are unable to walk
around the end of the trough. Their
only advantage is their low cost.

When installing a pumping plant it is essen-
tial to provide ample water storage in order to
guard against any shortage which may arise from
contingencies such as pumping time lost when
servicing the equipment or, in the case of wind-
mill plants, windless days.
For stock watering purposes, particularly
where the water is pumped by windmill, three
days supply should be the very minimum stor-
age capacity for which to allow. We recom-
mend, however, that at least sufficient water
be stored to last for five to seven days.
As it is not economical to rail or ship built
IMPROVED BOLTED TYPE TANKS
Fig. 678
These are made
in seven sizes from
6,600 gallons to
40,000 gallons total
capacity and we
strongly recommend
them for all tanks
over 5,000 gallons.
They are four
sheets high (that is,
Bft.) and the bot-
toms are built on to
the ground after it
Fig. 678
has been levelled off and covered with heavy tarred felt.
These Improved Bolted Type Tanks have three advantages over ordinary Bolted
Type Tanks in that :
1. They have a greater capacity for the same quantity of galvanised sheets.
2. The ground provides a firmer foundation than a Mound Ring; and
3. Since there is no Mound Ring to build, they cost less to construct.
The outlet from the tank to the trough is taken out of the side
just above the bottom; and while the water below the level of the
trough will not flow into the trough, it is there as a reserve in case
of an emergency.
The joints in the bottom of the tank are riveted and soldered,
but those in the sides are packed with felt strips soaked in oxide
and oil, and then bolted together. These bolted joints have the ad-
vantage that they allow some movement without leakage.
Material to build Improved Bolted Type Tanks, 4 sheets high, consisting of :
Galvanised Plain Sheets, Solder, Rivets and Spirits for Bottom; and Heavy Tarred Felt for
underneath bottom;

tanks except, perhaps, in the very small sizes
or for very short distances, materials only are
supplied for building the tank on the site.
The Southern Cross Organisation introduced
the use of corrugated iron tanks which have
superseded the plain iron (or Squatter’s) Tanks,
the reason being that the corrugated sheets are
much stronger than the plain sheets in the same
way that they are stronger for roofing. Corru-
gated Tanks can, therefore, be made of lighter
but stronger material at a much lower cost.
Three types of tanks can be supplied and
good quality materials are used throughout.
TANK CONNECTIONS
Fig. 677
Fig. 677 shows the most
suitable form of connection
between two storage tanks,
and is so arranged that
either or both tanks may
be shut off, and so water
may be taken to the
trough from either or both.
The connection consists of
two pairs of cast iron cor-
rugated flanges for the

pairs of galvanised cast iron
corrugated washers with
long screws and backnuts
for the 1 iin. and 2in.

Mound Ring Bolted Type Tanks
Fig. 673
These tanks are similar to the Improved
Bolted Type except that they are three sheets
high (that is, 6ft.) and are built on to a mound
of sand enclosed in a galvanised iron ring.
This galvanised iron ring is filled with sand
(or earth topped off with 5 or 6 inches of sand,
in preference to earth only) which is then levelled
off and covered with heavy tarred felt on which
the tank bottom rests. Normally the mound ring
is one full sheet high but where low troughs are
used the ring may be i sheet high.
Fig. 673
The joints in these tanks are made in the same way as for the Improved Bolted Type, that is,
the joints in the bottom are riveted and soldered; and the sides are bolted together and the joints
packed with felt strips soaked in oxide and oil.
Material to build Mound Ring Bolted Type Tanks, consisting of :
Galvanised Plain Sheets, Solder, Rivets, and Spirits for Bottom; and Heavy Tarred Felt for underneath bottom;
Galvanised Curved Corrugated Sheets, sin. x 9/32in. Galvanised Bolts with Nuts and Washers, and Prepared Oiled Strips for sides;
Galvanised Steel Angle Ring for around top;
24 Gauge Curved Corrugated Sheets with Rivets and Washers to make mound ring one full sheet high.

Soldered Type Tanks
Fig. 415
Soldered type tanks are almost always used in sizes up to
5,000 gallons, and are three sheets high. When installed for stock
watering purposes, the tops are generally left open, but closed
top tanks are necessary for house supply and especially necessary
for garden use to prevent leaves getting into the water and so
choking up the sprinklers.

Galvanised Steel Tankstands
Fig. 978
When a tank on the ground will not give sufficient pressure such as is re-
quired for garden taps, shower baths, etc., and where it is desired to fill water
into a tank on a truck for use at some other point, it is necessary to instal the
tank on an elevated stand.
A Steel Tankstand should always be used in preference to one of wood
because not only is it neater, but it is stronger, whiteant proof, and fire proof.
Most people realise how important it is for a steel windmill tower to be gal-
vanised. It is even more important for a steel tankstand to be galvanised as tanks
will, at times, overflow or corrode with the result that hard bore water runs over
the stand.
For this reason, Southern Cross Steel Tankstands are made of galvanised
angle steel throughout except for the platform which is made of good quality
hardwood. Strong angle steel is used because it is stronger than tubular or other
sections.
Southern Cross Steel Tankstands include all steel-work, sawn timber for the
platform, and are supplied as standard with anchor posts and foundation plates
for erecting in concrete foundations. A galvanised steel angle ladder, with angle
rungs, is also supplied and reaches from the bottom girt right to the top of the
tank.
NOTE : The tank indicator and tank shown in the illustration of the Tankstand
are, of course, not included in the above prices.

"M" Pattern
The "M" Pattern Float Valve is for Low Pressure (for
heads up to 20ft. and pipe lines up to 100 ft. long). A
"CG" Pattern Medium Pressure Float Valve is necessary for
heads over 20ft. and under 60ft., and for pipe lines over
100 ft. long and under 1000 ft. long, irrespective of
whether the head is 20ft. or under.
Float Valves
A highly efficient’ Float Valve is an extremely necessary
part of a stock watering outfit, since it must hold the water
in the tank when the stock are not drinking, and must let a
big supply of water into the trough immediately the stock
start to drink. The Southern Cross Float Valve is simple and
reliable and is acclaimed everywhere it is used as the best
float valve ever produced. A slight lowering of the water in
the trough allows the valve to open fully and discharge the
whole of the water that the piping will carry.
For heads over 60ft. and under 150 ft., and for pipe
lines over 1000 ft. long and under 3000 ft. long, irrespec-
tive of whether the head is 60ft. or less, a "CH" Pattern
High Pressure Float Valve is necessary.
All three types of valve are solidly constructed of brass,
including the floats, and are adjusted by means of a screw.
Float Valve Covers
Float Valves should, under all circumstances, be covered so as to protect them
from damage because, should the Float Valve be damaged, the water in the
tank is liable to be lost and the stock go thirsty. The Fig. 2192 Southern Cross
Float Valve Cover is particularly suitable for the purpose, being strongly made and
fully protecting the valve.
These Float Valve Covers are made from Galvanised Corrugated Sheet and
are easily sprung and clipped into position in angle steel frame troughing. Angle
steel support rails and bolts are supplied when required tor use with wooden
frame troughing.
So necessary is the protection of the Float Valve that, in addition to the Float
Valve Cover, it is advisable to fence off the portion of the trough where the
float is, in cattle troughing.
Fig. 2192
Brass Tapered Trough Plugs
In every length of troughing, a Flushing Out Plug is essential so that the trough may be
cleaned out regularly and simply.
Southern Cross Trough Plugs are made of brass and are made in two sizes—2in. and 4in.
diameter. The 2in. plug is used in lOin. x 6in. troughing, and 15in. x Sin. troughing up to
24ft. in length. The 4in. plug is used in 1 Sin. x Sin. troughing over 24ft. long, and in all
1 Sin. x lOin., 21 in. x 12in. and 30in. x 15in. troughing.
The seat of the 2in. plug is held in place in the trough by a brass backnut while the seat
of the 4in. plug is bolted to the trough sheet.

Southern Cross Troughing is made in all of
the usual types and sizes so that whatever type
or size you may prefer we are able to supply it.
The experience of those who use troughing
has led to two developments, both of which save
expense and lead to greater efficiency. The
first development is the tendency now to use
shorter troughs, and the second is to use smaller
troughs. At one time it was the practice to
have long, wide and deep troughs, but ex-
perience has shown that it is better to have a
shorter and smaller trough with a fullway float
valve, so that the stock get fresh, clean and
cool water from the tank quickly.
This development is particularly noticeable in
regard to sheep troughing. The most commonly
used size up until a few years ago was the 1 Sin.
x lOin. However, after seeing the good results
that were achieved in Western Australia by
15in. x Sin. troughing we introduced it into
the Eastern States where its use is becoming
increasingly popular; and to anyone requiring
sheep troughing we recommend that they instal
this size, as not only is it more economical, but
it has the additional advantages that, being
small, it is more rigid, sheep can’t fall into it,
there is not much water standing in the trough
to be absorbed before the fresh, clean and cool
water from the tank is available, and less water
is wasted when the trough is cleaned out.
Troughing
Troughing with Angle Steel Frame
Fig. 316
This Steel Frame
Troughing is very easy
to erect, and is most
durable when installed
as all the fittings, a r
well as the trough
sheets, are heavily
GALVANISED. Al-
though galvanising is
an expensive process,
we sell such large
quantities of troughing
that we are able to
offer all galvanised troughing at very little, if
any, more than most suppliers offer ordinary
troughing with painted fittings, the life of which
is not nearly as long as that of galvanised.
Although it is often used for sheep without
this precaution, it is advisable to erect a guard
rail over steel frame troughing to prevent stock
walking or jumping over it.
Troughing with Angle Steel Frame is made
in four sizes :
SIZE :
1 Sin. wide 18in. wide 21 in. wide 30in. wide
x Sin. deep x 1 Oin. deep x 12in. deep x 1 Sin. deep
CAPACITY :
4 galls. 6-4- galls. 9 galls. 16 galls.
per ft. per ft. per ft. per ft.
For sheep, we particularly recommend the
15in. x Sin. size (or, if a larger trough is de-
sired, then the 1 Sin. x lOin. size) and either of
the three larger sizes for cattle or horses.
Fig. 316
It will be noticed that we make the 21 in. x
12in. size in two different thicknesses—l 6
gauge and 20 gauge. The 20 gauge is quite suit-
able for dairy or other quiet cattle, but for bois-
terous animals, the 16 gauge or the BOin. x
15in. x 12 gauge should be used.
Sheets for this type of troughing are Bft. long.

Troughing for Wood Frame
Fig. 326
Fig. 326
This troughing is similar to the Fig. 316
Troughing with Angle Steel Frame with the ex-
ception that it is made for fitting into a wooden
frame instead of an angle steel one, and conse-
quently the angle steel legs, the angle steel side
rails, and the cross stays are not supplied.
It is made in the same sizes as the Fig. 316
and also in one smaller size (lOin. wide x 6in.
deep) which has achieved great popu-
larity because of its special suitability
for lambs.
The price for this troughing in-
cludes the curved trough sheets,
flanged ends, cross angles, and bolts
for bolting them to bush timber up-
rights, outside bands, and inside bows
for clamping the sheets together.
The method of erecting the trough-
ing, using side rails and a top guard rail, is as
shown in Fig. 326.
If required, we can supply sawn timber for
the side rails and top guard rail and the neces-
sary bolts to bolt them on, as an extra.
Sheets are 6ft. long for sizes lOin. x 6in.,
6ft. or Bft. long for 1 sin. x Bin., and Bft. long
for the larger sizes.
Prices and Weights per foot
Troughs 18ft. long or under will be charged extra for proportionate extra fittings.

Irrigation
At the present irrigation in this country is not used to the greatest advantage, and most people
whom the question most nearly concerns are inclined to look on an irrigation plant as an expensive
toy to be had only by the successful and prosperous man. Actually, the reverse is the case, and the
wonder is that anyone relying on the products of the soil for his income ever becomes prosperous
without some form of irrigation.
FARMING
Taken over a number of years the average annual rain-
fall on the arable land in Australia, if it fell regularly,
would be sufficient to grow splendid crops, but as the
rainfall is by no means regular, the growing of crops, which
are dependent on the rainfall, is at best a precarious busi-
ness. The effort and expense that are put into the tilling
of the soil, planting, tending of crops, which fail through
lack of rain, is worthy of a better end. How many men are
there who will read this article who have not had the ex-
perience of putting in crop after crop for a return, if any,
barely sufficient to pay the expenses of cultivation, and
then, getting a good season and a good crop, have found
that the market was glutted with their produce and that the
price was particularly low, because the same good season
benefited everyone and good crops were general.
Obviously the best time to have a good crop is when
there is a shortage owing to a bad season, and the only
way to be sure of this is by irrigation. The nett return
from four or five acres of irrigated land in a bad season
will probably be greater than from three times the area in
a good one.
DAIRY FARMING
Is there a Dairy Farmer who has not had the experience
of poor financial returns during drought times and the
worry and toil of scraping to keep his herd alive on expen-
sive purchased fodder?
The irrigation of three, four, or five acres of lucerne
during the drought would have,ensured the good condition
of his stock and ensured that his returns were as high as
they are in flush periods.
MARKET GARDENING
The growing, without irrigation, of vegetables for the
market cannot be carried on even in a good season with
certainty of results, because it requires not only water, but
water at the right time, to a day in some cases. With
irrigation the market gardener can plant sooner and get
bigger, better and earlier crops and so command the top
prices. In this instance the necessity for an irrigation plant
is, if possible, greater, and the return also is greater. It is
not unusual to hear of a plant for a market garden paying
for itself in one year.
ESSENTIALS IN SUCCESSFUL
IRRIGATION
The essentials in successful irrigation may be tabulated
as follows :
(a) Sufficient supply of suitable water.
(b) A plant suited to the work required of it.
(c) Intelligent use of the water and selection of crops.
That covers the whole question. If a supply of water is
available adjacent to a suitable area of land, then a plant
should most certainly be installed, and if discrimina-
tion is used in the working of it the result will be pro-
fitable.
METHODS OF IRRIGATION
Methods of irrigation may be divided into two main
branches —Flooding and Spraying.
Flooding consists of pumping the water on to the land
and letting it run in either drills between the rows of
crop or broadcast. It is not an efficient method, since even
distribution is very difficult unless the land is graded per-
fectly, which very seldom happens naturally, and is most
expensive to produce artificially. Flooding should only be
resorted to on the crop which, by its nature, precludes
spray irrigation. For example, sugar cane.
Irrigation by spraying consists in pumping through pipe
lines in which are fitted sprays to distribute the water
evenly. The two main types are :
(a) By sprays attached to movable pipe lines, most
suitable for large areas, and
(b) Fixed pipe lines carrying rotary or other type
sprinklers for smaller and more intensively culti-
vated areas.
The area which may be irrigated is limited by the
quantity of water available per hour, also, of course, by the
kind of crop and the attention it needs. For example, the
area of irrigated lucerne which would be handled by a
given quantity of labour would be much greater than of
strawberries. It is infinitely better to get the maximum re-
sults from a smaller area irrigated thoroughly than indif-
ferent results from a larger area not so well done.
The right size and type of irrigation plant for any job
depends on so many factors that it is impossible to lay
down definitely as a general rule what will be the best,
but our experience in matters of this kind enables us to
advise which type and size plant will do the job, when
we know the conditions under which it is to work. We sup-
ply complete equipment for any irrigation project, and can
confidently claim that whatever we supply will do the work
well and ba profitable.


Watering Crops
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rule
as to the quantity of water which must be given
to any particular crop because so many things
must be taken into consideration. For instance,
the class of soil, the temperature, the slope of
the ground, and the season, all enter into the
calculation.
We are setting out below AS A GENERAL
GUIDE ONLY the usual methods of watering the
more common crops. However, for more accur-
ate information, those who intend irrigating are
advised to get in touch with the nearest instruc-
tor of the Department of Agriculture who will
be only too glad to give his expert and ex
perienced advice.
LUCERNE
The first application of water is given as soon as the crop
is planted in order to stimulate an early growth, and further
waterings follow as the season requires. Generally speaking,
one watering of about 3 to 4 inches for each cut is sufficient
for the early part of the season, but, as the weather gets
hotter, more may be necessary, and the exact time when
these are made must depend entirely upon the season. The
usual practice is to irrigate a week before cutting, and to
give a second watering as soon as the hay has been taken
off. Should the weather be excessively dry and hot an extra
watering about fourteen days after cutting may be found
necessary. The object aimed at should be to keep sufficient
moisture in the soil to produce maximum results. It is not
advisable to wait until the lucerne shows signs of distress—
this must be anticipated as much as possible.
Big quantities of water at longer intervals are better than
smaller quantities at shorter intervals, because lucerne roots
naturally go well down into the ground and light waterings
would induce them to come to the surface. But too much
water must not be applied as the effect would be a con-
solidation of the surface that deprives the roots of the
lucerne of air, and hinders bacterial activity in the soil.
The secret of success with lucerne is to watch it at all
stages, to keep it growing as if it was a soft green vege-
table, and to cut it as soon as it is ready.
POTATOES
Work the land well, and, if it be dry, irrigate just before
ploughing. Plough deeply as soon as the land is dry enough,
and plant immediately. Keep the ground well harrowed until
the young plants are well up. One good irrigation (or at the
most, two) is all that is required for spring crops, and these
should be given before the young potatoes are any size, as
later watering will induce a second growth, which spoils the
tubers.
The secret in potato growing is good cultivation, com-
bined with as little water as is necessary to keep the plants
in good growing condition. The water, however, must be
applied at the right time and therein lies the advantage of
irrigation because it allows watering when required.
Irrigation of young citrus at Loxton. This equipment, in-
stalled throughout the War Service Land Settlement Area
at Loxton, is one of the largest installations of its kind.
CABBAGES, CAULIFLOWERS AND
TOMATOES
These plants have their roots near the surface and it is
essential that they be watered slowly so that the ground
over the roots should not be washed away. These plants
usually have to be sprayed with an insecticide and there-
fore it is usual to irrigate before spraying the insecticide on
the plants as, if the insecticide was put on the plants first,
it would be washed off by the water.
CITRUS ORCHARDS
The quantity of water required for Citrus Fruits is not
easy to determine.
Orchardists to whom we have supplied plants contend
that best results are obtained by putting an equivalent of
1 in. to 2in. of rain on the Orchard at each watering, but
the amount depends on the nature of the soil and whether
the Orchard is situated on a hillside or on flat ground.
Obviously if the plantation is on a hillside less water must
be put on at each watering but it must be watered at more
frequent intervals.
TOBACCO
With tobacco it is essential that the ground should be
thoroughly soaked before the seedlings are planted. Three
or four waterings will then be required per crop, the main
thing being to keep the ground moist.
ONIONS
Onions require one watering immediately after planting
and then two or three waterings during the growing period.
The plants, however, must not be given too much water as
by doing so they lose their keeping qualities.


Spray Irrigation with Movable Spray Lines
The spray system of irrigation has many ad-
vantages over other systems. Less water is
needed which means lower pumping costs and
probably a smaller pumping plant. Distribution
is uniform so that every part of the field can be
watered irrespective of level or condition. The
system suits any kind of soil including those
where flooding would be quite useless. More-
over, water forced through sprinklers is aerated
by being broken into particles by impact with
the air and, for this reason, its effect very closely
resembles that of rain.

and Bend enable the sprayline to be taken off at an angle.

of Winkie. Note how elevated standpipes enable water to
be discharged high over the tops of the trees.
MAIN AND SPRAY LINES
The main pipeline is that into which the water is de-
livered from the pump, and from which, by means of tees,
crosses or bends, the water is delivered to the spray lines.
The piping is constructed in standard random lengths of
approx. 17ft. 6in. long. Strongly constructed of first-grade
galvanised sheets, the pipe is light enough to be handled
easily without fatigue, yet sufficently strong and durable
to withstand the rigours of field usage and provide many
years of useful service. Each pipe is fitted with a "Quick-
Action" Coupling and may be used as either main line or
spray line, this being achieved by inserting a sealing plug
in the tapped hole in the female half of the coupling when
required for use as main line or inserting a sprinkler when
required for use as sprayline. This obviates having two dif-
ferent kinds of pipes.
The piping is obtainable in Bin., 4in., or Sin. diameters,
the outlets in the female halves of the couplings being
tapped with an internal thread for fin. sprinkler or a fin.
sealing plug.

standpipes have been replaced by sprinklers screwed into
the couplings for irrigating low trees.


PIPE SUPPORTING STANDS
The 3in. or 4in. piping may be mounted either on supporting stands or laid on the ground. These
stands are of minimum weight, but sturdily constructed and galvanised, and raise the pipe approxi-
mately 2ft. above ground level. They are attached to the far end of the pipe, i.e., the end to which is
attached the male half of the "Quick-Action" Coupling.
The advantages of the stands are that they eliminate fatigue, as the operator does not need to
stoop in order to pick up pipes, risk of corrosive action is reduced, piping is less liable to damage, and
is retained in a much cleaner condition. They are also useful where it is necessary for the sprays to
be elevated above the height of surrounding growth.
Where pipe supporting stands are used, some growers prefer to have a short (Sin.) supporting
stand at the other end of the pipe, so that, when all the pipes are disconnected, the coupling at the
free end is prevented from touching the ground. In this way, the piping is kept clean, and the flushing
through of pipes to clean out dirt which may otherwise enter is avoided.

“QUICK-ACTION” COUPLING
The patented "Quick-Action" Coupling is one of the
predominant features of the construction which makes this
irrigation equipment such an undisputed leader. It can be
closed or opened in a flash with amazing ease, the opera-
tion being simplicity itself, as will be seen from the illus-
trations below which show the coupling in the open, half
locked, and locked positions. Finger pressure only is neces-
sary to perform these operations—no tools of any descrip-
tion are needed —and a perfect water seal under pressure
is obtained. The coupling provides sufficient flexibility
under all practical working conditions.
The piping will readily follow the contour of uneven
ground, and the design of the coupling renders it unneces-
Half-Locked
Open
sary to align the pipes carefully when coupling together.
The female portion of the coupling is fitted with a rub-
ber ring, which is retained in a recess from which it will
not drop out. It is held securely, but lightly, against the
male coupling by means of the adjustable screwed levers
attached to the trunnions, which in turn swivel in the curved
links attached to the male half of the coupling.
The female half of the coupling is provided with a
standard outlet, %\n. gas internal thread, into which may be
screwed a plug, if to be used as main line. Where used as
spray line, the sprinklers are screwed into the coupling
itself, and thus the piping is not weakened in any way by
drill holes of other means of attaching a sprinkler.

SPRINKLERS
In order to cater for the needs of irrigationists, having
regard to the nature of the installation and the crops to be
watered, a wide selection of sprinkler heads of different
types, each designed with hydraulic characteristics to suit
the particular need of the individual installation, can be
supplied.
“DOME HEAD” SPRINKLERS
Four sizes are made to discharge
3,5, 7, or 8 gallons per minute
over a 35ft. diameter circle at a
35ft. pressure head at the
sprinkler. Screwed fin. gas exter-
nal thread.
Two of the most popular of the sprinklers are described
below but other types can be supplied if required—up to
sprinklers which will discharge 15i- gallons a minute with
a coverage of 1 13ft. diameter when operated under a pres-
sure head of 1 1 sft.
“ROTOFRAME” SPRINKLERS
Discharge 3 gallons per minute over
a 35ft. diameter circle at a sprinkler
pressure head of 35ft. Screwed -fin.
gas internal thread and are con-
nected to the outlet in the pipe
coupling by a nipple or a short stand-
pipe.

TEE CONTROL VALVES
The tee control valve, as illustrated, provides a simple means by which a lateral
pipe line may be laid at right angles, and by which the flow of water into the lateral
line may be controlled.
The valve fulfills exactly the same purpose as a tee piece, except that it incor-
porates the added feature that the flow of water to the outlet may be controlled and
entirely shut off if necessary.
The valve is constructed from a casting of the highest quality, and is heavily gal-
vanised. It is easily controlled and the movement of the valve is designed to prevent
water hammer.
It is a most useful fitting and is supplied in the following sizes : Sin. mainline
to 4in. sprayline; 4in. mainline to 4in. sprayline; and Bin. mainline to Bin. sprayline.

2. The distance along the ground from the water to the
point at which it is proposed to instal the pump.
3. The vertical height from the lowest water level to the
point at which it is proposed to instal the pump.
4. The vertical height from the pump to the highest point
of ground to be irrigated.
5. The distance along the ground from the point at which
it is proposed to instal the pump to the nearest edge

The Process of Drilling
The Southern Cross No. 2 Waterboring
Machine uses the percussion system of drilling.
This system of drilling employs a hard steel drill
which the machine lifts and drops, giving a
series of sharp blows to the formation being
drilled. The face of the drill is suitably formed
to cut into the earth or rock, and after a cer-
tain amount has been drilled it is cleaned out
of the hole by a sand pump, which is a length of
tubing with a valve in the bottom, after which
the drilling is resumed.
The machine should be set up so the sills or
frame are not twisted and so that a plumb line
from the centre of the drilling pulley in the der-
rick falls in line with the centre of the base of
the derrick. The tools are laid out on the ground,
screwed up by hand, and then tightened with
the Drill Wrenches.
We must stress the necessity for absolute care
in the tightening up; always clean and oil the
threads before starting, and after using.
Hoist the tools until they are hanging from the
derrick just clear of the ground. Throw the
clutch operating the cable drum out of gear and
set the drilling mechanism in motion, and at
the same time hold the drill to keep it from
swaying. If the drill doesn’t hit the ground at
the bottom of the stroke let out more cable
gradually until it does. Be careful not to let out
too much cable else the top of the string will
tend to fall over.
The operator will soon learn to steady the
string of tools, but, when starting, his assistant
may help him by steadying the top of the tools
from the derrick until the hole is deep enough
to form a guide for the drill. About two gallons
of water per foot will be needed to keep the hole
wet and puddled so that the drillings will come
up in the sand pump.
In order to drill a round hole the drill must be
constantly turned. It should not strike two suc-
cessive blows in the same place, and so at the
commencement the operator should turn the
drill slightly as it comes up after each stroke.
As the hole gets deeper it will be noticed that
there is a tendency for the tools to turn them-
selves. One important thing which must be im-
pressed on the operator’s mind is that the drill
must be turned constantly and regularly, other-
wise the hole won’t be round and complications
may follow.
The drilling process (if the hole is being
started with a drill and not an earth socket) will
be continued for four feet or so until the drillings
become so thick that the drill won’t fall readily
in them, when it becomes necessary to draw
the tools and clean the hole out with the sand
pump. Then go on alternatively drilling and
cleaning out.
That, broadly, is the process of drilling. We
have already mentioned one main point —the
tightening of the threads—and the other thing
which makes for successful boring is "drilling
with a tight rope.” Perhaps the hardest thing
for the beginner to learn is that he cannot make
the drill cut faster by letting out more cable.
The fact is that there should be just enough
cable out to let the tools hang clear of the bot-
tom when the machine is stopped. Then, when
the machine is running, the spring or stretch
of the rope will allow the drill to strike a sharp
decisive blow and spring off the bottom without
danger of sticking. As the depth increases the
distance the drill should hang off the bottom
naturally increases since the longer the rope the
greater will be the spring.
An example of this might be given by a weight
attached to a piece of elastic held in the hand.
Move the hand up and down and the distance
through which the weight travels will be more
than the hand does, so in drilling the travel of
the drill bit is greater than that of the walking
beam if the cable is not slack.
If the cable is slack, allowing the tools to rest
on the bottom, the travel of the drill will be less
than that of the beam, with consequent slow
progress and the probability of a crooked hole,
damaged rope and jars. Another reason for
drilling with a taut rope is so that the two halves
of the drill jars do not work inside one another
while drilling is in progress. Jars should only be
used as jars when there is some jarring to be
done such as if a drill should become stuck.
This drilling “on the spring of the rope” is the
only way to get results. It is faster because the
drill gets a longer stroke than the walking beam
by the amount of spring in the rope plus the
pitch which the spring of the cable on the up-
stroke imparts to the tools.
Whether the rope is too slack is decided by
holding the rope; it should vibrate like a taut
wire if the feed is correct.
These remarks are made as a guide to start
new drillers on the right basis.
Any intelligent person can successfully oper-
ate a Southern Cross Waterboring Machine, and
successful boring, like genius, consists in a
capacity tor taking infinite pains.


Southern Cross Waterboring Plants
Over the years, Southern Cross has rendered much sterling service to the man on the land and
perhaps the greatest single service was the design and production of the No. 2 Southern Cross Water-
boring Plant which is now the almost universally used machine for obtaining underground water in
Australia.
The advantages of a bore over other forms of water supply are generally acknowledged. Leaving
the artesian bores out of the question we will say of sub-artesian bores that ;
1. The water is free from pollution so common in wells.
2. It is more permanent.
3. It is less costly.
4. It is very often better stock water than any other on account of the amount of mineral salts in
suspension.
5. It is the quickest method of securing water.
Generally speaking, sin. bores are used in sheep country and on farms and 6in. in cattle coun-
try to enable suitable size pumps to be inserted, but where salt water is likely to be encountered it
is common practice to start off with 6in. casing and finish with sin. so that the salt water can be cased
or cemented off.
The No. 2 Southern Cross Waterboring Machine
has a rated capacity of 600 ft. for 5 in. or 6 in.
holes. This capacity, however, is very conservative
as holes up to 1200 ft. have frequently been sunk
with these plants.
This machine is undoubtedly the fastest and
most efficient waterboring plant which has yet
been designed for holes of up to about 600 ft.
deep.
The illustration above shows the general con-
struction of the machine when it is supplied on
a four-wheeled undercarriage. The frame is of
seasoned hardwood correctly braced with steel
knees and ties. The gears are of Cast Iron while
the pinions are of cast steel. The spindles are of
cold rolled bright steel shafting and the main bear-
ings are fitted with oil boxes.
The boring motion is produced by a walking
beam and a cam giving the quick lift and sudden
drop which makes the machine such a fast borer.
The whole design is carried out in a robust manner
from sound materials and the machine may be
relied on to do its work with extreme ease and
freedom from delays. The standard machine il-
lustrated includes folding derrick with guy lines,
Power Blower and Forge on tripod.


Great strength and power are built into every
Southern Cross Waterboring Machine. Yet every
part is of the utmost simplicity. This sturdiness
means that there is a wealth of reserve power,
while simplicity of design means fewer parts to
give trouble and wear out.
The frame being of the best straight grained
well seasoned timber has the spring and resilience
so desirable in drilling—it withstands hard knocks
and stays in alignment. Years of experience prove
this type of frame the most practical and most
desirable. Most operators, too, prefer the wooden
derrick owing to its lightness and shock-absorbing
qualities.
One man can efficiently operate the Southern
Cross Machine as all the operating controls are
grouped at the drilling end of the machine thereby
making it possible for the operator to drill with-
out leaving his position. The controls are simple
and respond quickly so that drilling is speedy and
accurate.
All drums and sheaves are of large diameter so
as to reduce rope wear. This means longer rope
life and is just another feature which makes the
Southern Cross machine so economical in opera-
tion.
An efficient belt driven blower supplies a full
blast of air for the forge and is another accessory
(at no extra charge) which aids the driller in his
all-important job to save time and speed the work.
OTHER USES OF WATERBORINC MACHINES
Three Southern Cross No. 2 Waterboring Machines being used as
blast hole drills on Cessnock No. 2 Open-Cut in New South Wales.
Up to 80ft. of this rock is being removed to expose a large seam
of best quality gas coal.
These machines are called “Water Bor-
ing” machines because that is the purpose
for which they are most usually used. How-
ever, large numbers of them are used for
other purposes such as soil testing, pier hole
drilling, mineral exploration, and blast hole
drilling.
Contractors and mining engineers have
come to recognise the advantages of these
machines for blast hole boring since it was
discovered that, in quarries and open-cuts
where the cut was more than fifteen feet,
the Waterboring Machine offered immense
advantages in every way. As the face got
higher, the advantage increased.
A 5-in. or 6-in. hole can be sunk to the
bottom of a face 100, 150, 200 feet high or
higher and the quarry engineer is able to
throw down the entire face at one blast thus
eliminating all necessity for track laying and
cleaning up at various levels.
There is frequently a saving in explosives
also as, in most cases, the need for at least
one “bulling” charge is obviated by the lar-
ger diameter bore hole.
Other advantages are that the holes can
be spaced much further apart than in shal-
low drilling with small diameter drills
about 15ft. more or less depending on the
nature of the rock and the material
comes down in better shape for the crusher.
In metal and limestone quarries,
etc., and in open-cut mining, the South-
ern Cross No. 2 Waterboring Machines are
rapidly being recognised for their suitability
in boring blast holes for heavy excavation.

Waterboring Tools
DRILLS
Figs. 65 and 859
It is the drill which cuts the hole. There are
two main types—Fig. 65 Chisel Drills and Fig.
859 Undercutting Drills. The former has a cut-
ting face larger than the diameter of the casing,
and the latter is so made that it will pass through
the casing and cut a hole underneath it suffi-
ciently large for the casing to follow. It is cus-
tomary to start drilling with a chisel drill and
keep on with it until there is a likelihood of the
sides of the hole starting to fall in, then casing
is inserted and boring is continued with the
undercutting drill.
UNDERGROUND SWIVELS
Fig. 866
This tool screws on the top of the drill jars and
connects them to the drilling cable. Inside the
swivel is a sleeve which is of case hardened
steel and has two washers. The rope is secured
in the sleeve by spreading the strands and run-
ning whitemetal round them and into the sleeve
which fits against a shoulder inside the body
of the swivel. This device, as its name implies,
enables the tools to turn and it is essential that
they do turn, and turn continuously, as other-
wise the hole will not be round. When drilling
is done correctly on the spring of the rope the
tools turn automatically as the rope lengthens
and shortens, since it tends to unwind and wind
up again.

Drill.
Fig. 73.—Sinker Bar.
Fig. 865.—Drill Jars.
Fig. 866.—Underground
Swivel.
SINKER BARS
Fig. 73
This tool screws on to the top of the drill and
its use is to provide weight for the drill and to
act as a guide to some extent to keep the hole
straight. The standard length is 10ft.
DRILL JARS
Fig. 865
These are screwed on to the top of the sinker
bar and should always be used. The tool is not
primarily designed to assist the drilling, though
it does lend weight to the drill, but in the event
of the drill becoming fast through any untoward
accident, the jars come into use and enable an
upward blow to be given to the sinker bar and
drill which, if repeated, will almost certainly re-
sult in jarring them loose, when a straight pull
on the rope would not move them. Drill Jars are
an insurance against lost tools. They should
always be used on top of recovery tools during
fishing operations for broken tools.
These jars are made from high quality steel
and are normalised after forging. However, we
are not able to cover drill jars with a warranty
because we find that when drilling in holes
which are crooked, or in boulder country, or
drilling with too slack a rope, jars may break
through no fault of the manufacturers.

DRILL WRENCHES AND CHAIN LEVERS
Fig. 880 Fig. 881
It is essential when screwing up the drilling
tools to see that the joints are first thoroughly
cleaned, then oiled, and then screwed together
absolutely tight. The screwing together is done
with Drill Wrenches Fig. 880 and Chain Levers
Fig. 881.
SAND PUMPS
Fig. 99
The sand pump is a length of tubing fitted at
the bottom with a steel shoe and bronze valve
and at the top with a loop and a shackle. It is
used to clean the drillings out of the bore
periodically. After a certain distance has been
drilled the tools are withdrawn and the sand
pump run down the hole, worked up and down
at the bottom until charged with slush, and then
withdrawn and emptied by lowering on to a peg
which opens the valve and allows the slush to
escape.
TESTING BALERS
The Fig. 2582 Testing Baler is much the same
as the Sand Pump but it has a gunmetal valve
and no shoe and its capacity is greater. It is used
to bale water from the bore to test the supply.
CASING SWIVELS AND CASING LOWERING
TOOLS
Fig. 875 Fig. 632
These tools are most convenient for lowering
and withdrawing casing. The casing swivel is
screwed into the underground swivel and the
yoke bolted to a standard casing lowering tool
Fig. 632.
ROPE HOOKS
Fig. 878
If tools are lost through the rope breaking the
Rope Hook is attached to another set of jars and
swivel and lowered down the bore where the
hook engages in coils of the rope. The rope can
then be lifted to the surface and the tools with it.
Waterboring Tools
(Continued)


HORN SOCKET FISHING TOOLS
Fig. 869
This is the type of Fishing Tool most usually
used for recovering Boring Tools lost down a
bore. It is a cone shaped sleeve, split part of
the way down one side, and is lowered down over
the lost tools and driven on to them until
jambed tight when the tools may be withdrawn.
EARTH SOCKETS
Fig. 863
This is a hollow tool fitted at the bottom with
a hardened steel cutting shoe. For starting a
hole through earth, clay or other soft formation,
this tool is very useful. The material cut out is
packed inside the tool by successive blows and
brought up to the surface with it where it can
be removed with a pick or bar through slots in
the sides. For drilling in soft material an earth
socket is most convenient since it does away
with the necessity for cleaning out the drillings
with a sand pump and considerably increases the
rate of sinking.

Fig, 862. —Expanding Reamer.
Fig. 861.—8u1l Nosed Reamer.
Fig, 885. —Drive Clamp (at left).
Fig. 886. —Drive Cap (at right).
REAMERS
Figs. 862 and 861
The use of the reamer is to cut away an obstruction after
the bore has been drilled; for instance, a stone may project
from one side, and the casing fail to go down. The Bull
Nosed Reamer is the counterpart of the Chisel Drill and is
used in a hole which has not yet been cased while the
Expanding Reamer is so constructed that the jaws can be
folded together and the tool lowered through the casing,
and, when through, the jaws are expanded by means of a
spring and the hole below the casing reamed out to full size.
If care is taken with drilling the necessity for such reamers
will be rare.
DRIVE CLAMPS AND DRIVE CAPS
Fig. 885 Fig. 886
It is sometimes necessary to drive casing and this is done
by screwing a heavy Drive Cap on to the top of the casing
to protect the threads, fastening a Drive Clamp across the
square of the Sinker Bar, and then driving the casing by
hammering the cap with the clamps, the tools being oper-
ated as in drilling. Note particularly that casing should
not be driven unless unavoidable. When driving casing the
hole should be kept full of water.

Only the best is good enough when it comes to the welfare of your dairy herd.
A good milking machine has to do more than just extract milk from the cows. The op-
eration must be carried out in a manner which is both gentle and efficient in order to obtain
| the highest possible production.
The latest advance in modern milking methods is the Southern Cross Alternating Pulsa-
tion Milking Machine. With its “Criss-Cross” Milking Action it ensures contentment to the
cow. It milks her safely, thoroughly and fast, is gentle to her delicate udder, and preserves her
| good health condition.
SOUTHERN CROSS


That is why we have produced the Southern Cross Alternating Pulsation Milking Mach-
ine—dairy farmers everywhere have felt the need for it for a long time.
Having decided on machine milking the business-like Dairy Farmer will not be content
with anything less than the finest plant available—it is the new Southern Cross Alternating
Pulsation Milking Machine.
To drive it there is the choice of the famous Southern Cross Diesel Engines or Petrol
Engines—or Electric Motors, if electric power is available.
These machines are more fully described on the following pages.
MILKING MACHINES


Southern Cross Milking Machines
SPECIFICATION
“A”
Illustration “A” shows the first teat milking and the second resting. Then as the pulsation al-
ternates or changes, as per illustration “B”, the first teat rests and the second milks.
Exactly the same alternating action is occurring on the front two teats, the back two, or on either
side of the udder.
The number of pulsations occurring on each teat is 45 per minute, similar to other machines, but
due to the alternating HANDLIKE ACTION of milking two teats at a time, the cows give their milk
down much more freely and tend to milk quicker and more contentedly with the Southern Cross
Machine.
CRISS-CROSS ACTION practically eliminates the possibility of teat cups falling off. With “Criss-
Cross” action, one teat at the front and one teat at the back of the udder, diagonally opposite, are
milked at the one pulsation, ensuring an even pull on the udder. So that two teats are always milking,
while the other two teats are resting, and on each alternate pulsation the reverse occurs. The pulsa-
tion or interruption to the vacuum does not occur to all
four cups at the one time, and consequently the cups
must stay on better than with an ordinary machine.
MILK WITH A SOUTHERN CROSS AND BE CERTAIN
THAT THE TEAT CUPS WILL STAY ON.
CRISS-CROSS CLAW
The SOUTHERN CROSS Criss-Cross Claw milks two teats
diagonally opposite at each pulsation instead of four, and there-
fore is much easier and better on the cow, and per-
mits of a much more gentle and even milking action.
The claw is strongly constructed with screwed caps
on the ends of the milk and air pipes. The vacuum cuts off automatically when the
cups are being changed over.
THE SOUTHERN CROSS TEAT CUP
The SOUTHERN CROSS Teat Cup incorporates the two most important features
demanded in a cup
(1) It will stay on.
(2) It will milk well.
it is made of heavy gauge material, and will give lasting service. No metal comes
in contact with the teats or udder.


CYCLONE FILTERING
The cyclone principle of filtering which is built into the Vacuum Tank and Moisture Trap
on the Vacuum Pump is such that a whirl of air is set up. By centrifugal force, this whirl of air
throws any moisture vapours to the walls of the tank (or moisture trap) where they condense
and run down the sides leaving dry air only to be drawn out from the centre of the tank.
The MOISTURE TRAP on the Southern
Cross Vacuum Pump works on the
cyclone principle. This cyclone filtering
principle prevents moisture from getting
through to the internal working parts of the pump between milkings
and setting up rust conditions. A flap valve is fitted for the automatic
discharge of any moisture collected.
PULLEYS. The spindle extends both sides of the vacuum pump, so
that the pulley can be fitted on either side. The drive is by double Vee
belts and a Diesel or Petrol Engine or an electric motor can be used.
Reduction Drive For Pulsator Shaft
Illustration at right shows 3 to 1 reduction drive as fitted to the Vacuum Pump
A positive trouble-free chain drive, with chain guard.
SOLDERLESS UNIONS AND MILK LINE COUPLINGS
The Air Line throughout is fitted with Solderless Unions ensuring easy
assembling and dismantling. The Milk Line Couplings have metal to metal
joints which ensure cleanliness.

PULSATOR AND SIGHT BOWL
Large size overhead pulsators, as illustrated, are installed in each bail,
designed to give alternating pulsations, with consequent easier milking action
on the cow. Instead of the pulsation occurring on all four teats at once, two
teats are milking while the other two are relaxed or resting.
This alternating action is similar to hand milking, and consequently is
better for the cow.
Class Sight Bowls are supplied at no extra charge and are fitted with a
by-pass valve so that milking is not interrupted if a glass bowl is broken at
any time.
Southern Cross Milking Machines
SPECIFICATION (Continued)


RELEASOR
The SOUTHERN CROSS Releasor is a large-bodied, quick-action releasor with the
milk pipe going right through the body of the releasor. The milk pipe is drilled at the
bottom so that the milk falls directly down into the releasor, and the top of this milk pipe
acts as an effective baffle which prevents the milk being drawn back into the vacuum
tank. The releasor is made of rustless sheet nickel-plated out-
side and tinned inside, with no crevices. It is fitted with hard
rubber flaps which do not go out of shape and rarely require
replacement. Easy to dismantle, simple and hygienic.
MILK AND AIR LINE BRACKET
This bracket acts as additional support for the milk and air lines between each bail and
in the air space, and ensures a very rigid installation. The pulsator rod rollers are mounted on
the brackets and the pulsator rod runs on these rollers over its whole length, working very
smoothly. No weight of the pulsator rod is taken on the pulsator slides, with the result that
wear is kept down to the minimum.
The pipes being at right angles to the milk board, instead of one above the other as jn
other plants, makes a much neater and more convenient installation.
CYCLONE VACUUM TANK
A Lasting Job
The SOUTHERN CROSS is the only Vacuum Tank which incorporates the Cyclone filtering
principle, which acts as a safeguard in preventing moisture and milk vapours from getting back
into the vacuum pump and setting up rust conditions.
The lid is a solid machined gunmetal casting, and the tank is made entirely of rustproof
materials, nickel-plated outside and tinned inside. It is easily dismantled by means of one hand-
wheel screw.
MILK AND AIR LINES
Are both of heavy gauge Ti- inch diameter Brass Tubing,
NICKEL-PLATED outside and tinned inside. All fittings are
also nickel-plated and highly polished.
RUBBERWARE AND BRUSHWARE
Necessary high-quality rubberware and brushware is sup-
plied with each machine.
CRAPHITED CARBON PULSATOR SLIDES
The plant is fitted with this latest and most hygienic
type of pulsator slide, which does not require greasing or
oiling. Exceptionally durable.
OTHER FEATURES
Included in the plant is a first-quality, mercury-tested,
nickel-plated Vacuum Gauge, and an efficient spring-
loaded Relief Valve which allows easy adjustment of the
Vacuum.
DRIVING MACHINES
For driving these Milking Machines either a Mark YB
SOUTHERN CROSS Diesel Engine (Pages 4 to 11 of this
catalogue) or a Mark AX-C SOUTHERN CROSS Petrol En-
gine (Page 15 of this catalogue) is recommended.
Should an electric motor drive be required then a 2 H/p
electric motor can be supplied for the 2,3, or 4 unit plants
or a 2-|- H/p motor for the 5 or 6 unit plants. (For details
of SOUTHERN CROSS 2 H/p and 2| H/p Electric Motors
see Page 17 of this catalogue.)

ERECTION
The price of the Southern Cross Milking Plant
includes the cost of erection, but not freight on
the plant or tools. The erector will, after erection,
instruct in the running of the plant and stay for
several milkings, enabling the buyer to learn
thoroughly how to use it. The buyer is required
to find food, accommodation and assistance for
the erector, and to convey him and his tools from
and to the nearest railway station.
SERVICE
The price of the Milking Machine includes
such reasonable FREE SERVICE during the first
six months following the supply of the plant as

Southern Cross Mark DY-G Power Pumps
The Southern Cross Mark DY-G Power Pump is a horizontal
displacement pump suitable for pumping water and aerated
liquids.
IT IS PARTICULARLY SUITABLE FOR PUMPING SKIM
MILK.
The suction and discharge are screwed internally to suit
1-in. and |— in, pipe respectively, and can be arranged from
either side or at the end of the cylinder. When required for
pumping skim milk, a funnel can be supplied with the pump
at no extra charge.
The pump is of the single cylinder, single acting type, with
the main working parts enclosed and automatically oiled. The
base of the gearbox incorporates an oil reservoir from which
oil is carried by the main gearwheel to the highest point, and,
by a system of channels, is distributed to all moving parts
and then returned to the reservoir. This system of flood lubri-
cation contributes to quiet operation and long life, , with a
minimum of attention.
The pump drive is from the pinion or driving shaft through
5i to 1 single reduction gearing of ample capacity to the main
gearwheel. An eccentric on the side of the gearwheel trans-
mits the drive to the pump plunger through a connecting rod
of heavy section.
The packing gland on the plunger is fitted with graphited
steam packing and can be easily adjusted to overcome leaks.
11-in. diameter x H-in. face fast and loose pulleys are fitted.

“Swift” Steam Steriliser
and Hot Water Boiler
These are 12 gallon capacity sterilisers used for sterilising
milking machines and dairy equipment. They are specially de-
signed to burn fuel oil, or wood, or both and they deliver WET
free-flowing steam at 212°F., which has been advocated by all
authorities as best suited for dairy sterilisation.
The advantages of Wet Steam are that it cleanses and steril-
ises much quicker than dry or “pressure” steam and does not
bake casein on to the milk line nor injure the rubber ware.
Not only will the steriliser deliver steam, but abundant boil-
ing water as well it’s a real dual purpose boiler.
These sterilisers are made from solid copper with brazed seams
and each unit is supplied with Flue Pipe and Cowl. Installation
is easy and simple, and full instructions (with diagram for the
installation and use) are supplied with each steriliser.
Price £33/10/-


TUBULAR STEEL BAILS, DAIRY ACCESSORIES, ETC.
An efficient dairy demands not only that the Milking Machine be the best—as it will be if it is SOUTHERN
CROSS—but that all the accessory equipment be of suitable design and conducive to efficiency.
The Southern Cross Organisation has had many years experience in dairying in all parts of Australia and is able
to give you sound practical advice on what is the most suitable equipment and the most economical in' the long run.
Whether it be Tubular Steel Bails, Churns, Separators, Skim Milk Pumps, Sterilisers, etc., we can supply them.
Separators
If your Dairy is equipped with Southern Cross Milking Machines you
will be getting all the MILK quickly, cleanly, and economically.
But to get all the CREAM, no matter what kind of Milking Machines
you use, you cannot do better than instal a separator from “Southern
Cross”.
We shall be pleased to give you prices and full particulars of these
separators on receipt of your enquiry.
WHAT SIZE SEPARATOR ?
Separators are described according to the rate at which they will sep-
arate, i.e. a 100 gallon machine will separate 100 gallons per hour.
To ensure the highest possible efficiency and saving of valuable time,
we recommend that the gallonage of the machine to be installed should
be approximately double that of the quantity of milk to be separated. For
instance, if it is desired to separate 50 gallons of milk at each milking,
then a 100 gallon per hour machine should be installed and, in any case,
not less than a 75 gallon machine.
A larger separator rather than a smaller one should always be chosen
because, apart from the saving in time, a larger separator has a bigger sludge space than a smaller one
and consequently, when separating a large quantity of milk, is more effective..
Mr. F. Robertson's modern milking shed near Marysville,
Vic., in which is installed a Southern Cross "CO" Pattern
Milking Machine.
REPLACING OLD SEPARATORS
Have you ever left your Skim Milk stand for a
day? If you have and there is cream on the sur-
face of the skim milk then your separator is not
efficient. In fact, you’re losing money giving
it to the pigs because every ounce of butterfat
that is obtained from the milk means £.s.d.
Check up on your separator now and if you
find that it is not skimming efficiently and is
costing you money replace it with a new separa-
tor from “Southern Cross”—and be assured of
years of better skimming.


Tubular Steel Frame Cates
On this and the opposite page we show a selection of the more popular gates for Homestead,
Station or Farm.
If required, top scrolls for these gates can be supplied at an extra charge.
Single gates hang on the right when looking from the road but, if specified, they can be made to
hang on the left. Necessary allowance is made for hinges and catch. Double gates can be supplied
with unequal leaves, but it will be necessary to state which side the small leaf will hang, looking at
gate from road.
Necessary catches and hinges are supplied with the gates.
WHEN ORDERING CATES, give exact measurements between posts and, when to be hung on
side of posts, state size of posts. A necessary allowance for fitting is made. A small extra charge is made
for fittings that are required to bolt through posts. In this case the size of the posts must be stated
when ordering.
| Give width between posts when hanging between. a
|j j For hanging on side of post give width thus. |j |

D. M. Boiler Enamel
It is a well-known fact that water used in the cooling systems of engines
causes a scale formation which eventually impairs the circulation of the water.
To prevent this scale formation we recommend the use of D.M. Boiler Enamel.
This compound is used in the cooling water and forms an enamel over all surfaces
with which the water comes in contact and protects them against pitting and cor-
rosion, It also prevents any solids from the water being deposited in the passages.

Belting
HEAVY DUTY RUBBER COMPOSITION BELTING
This is a friction surface belt and is suitable for general industrial
drives where heavy variable loads are to be transmitted. It is quite suit-
able for all drives usually required of Southern Cross Engines and is con-
siderably cheaper than leather belting.
REPLACEABLE LINK BRAMMER V-BELTS
These belts will run in all standard grooves and so may be used to
replace Solid Endless Belts without alteration.
Ironcoat
This is a Bitumen-Asbestos Fibre preparation for repairing old and leaking gal-
vanised iron tanks and troughing. New tanks and troughing also should be given a
coat as its use will prolong the life of them. It is a cold application preparation—
no heating is required.
Approximate covering capacities are: 2 gallons for 1000 gallon tanks; gal-
lons for 2000 gallon tanks; 3 gallons for 3000 gallon tanks; with an extra two-
thirds of a gallon for every 1000 gallons up to 20,000 gallon tanks. Slightly more
will be required for cement.
Try some and you will quickly appreciate its value.

By doubling the diameter of a pipe or cylinder its capacity is increased four times.
To find the area of a circle or pipe, square the diameter and multiply by .7854.
To find the circumference of a circle multiply the diameter by 3.1416.
To find the diameter of a circle multiply the circumference by .3183.
Sharp angles in a pipe line cause a large increase in friction, therefore use bends and easy curves
instead of elbows.
A column of water Ift. in height exerts a pressure of .433 lbs. per. sq. inch.
One Imperial Gallon of water at 62° F. weighs 10 lbs. and contains 277.464 c. inches.
One Imperial Gallon of SEA WATER weighs approximately 10.33 lbs.
One Imperial Gallon of Water equals 1.2 United States Gallons.
One cubic foot of water equals 6i imperial gallons.
One inch of water over an acre equals 22,700 gallons.
One inch of vacuum is equal to 1.13 ft. To convert inches vacuum to feet suction, multiply by 1.13.
STATIC HEAD is the vertical height of a column of water. Head is always expressed in feet.
FRICTION is the resistance which the walls and irregularities inside pipes offer to the flow of water.
Capacities per Foot of Piping and Casing
Number of Gallons Discharged per minute through Pipe Lines 1,000 Feet Long

Approximate Number of Gallons Pumped per Hour by Single-Acting Pumps at 30
Strokes per Minute
These are the theoretical quantities delivered. No allowance has been made for the slip or leakage which may take place owing to
wear of the leathers or valves. For double-acting pumps multiply the above quantities by 2,
Friction
The following table shows the friction head per 100 feet of piping, which must be added to the static head to arrive at the total
so that the power required may be computed.
For example, to pump 1,000 gallons per hour through 1,000 feet of 1-i-in. piping to a height of 100 feet requires sufficient power
to pump against a total head of :
Static Head ...... 100 feet
Plus Friction Head from Table 160 feet
Total 260 feet
It will be obvious that by using larger piping and so reducing the friction head, much less power will be required. For example, by
using 2-inch piping for the same job, the friction head would be reduced to only 14 feet, making a total head of 114 feet, which would
require less than naif the power.
Friction Head per 100 Feet of New Pipe
(A margin should always be allowed for corrosion)

PRESSURE-HEAD CONVERSION TABLE
FINDING LEVELS AND FALLS
When it is not convenient to have a surveyor
inspect a site and take accurate levels by Dumpy
Level or Theodolite, fairly accurate levels can
be taken by means of an ordinary builder’s spirit
level and a box or something similar on which
the level can be rested. In addition, a staff is
needed, say, exactly ten feet long.
It is most convenient to take the levels down
hill from the top to bottom so commence at the
highest point first. Set up the box and put the
spirit level on it. Then pack under the box with
sand or dirt until the spirit level is exactly level
as shown by the bubble.
An assistant should then take the 1 Oft. staff
in the direction of down hill until a point is found
where the top of the staff is exactly level with
the line of sight across the top of the spirit level
as shown in the diagram at left below. (So that
the top of the staff can be clearly recognised at
a distance it can be painted white or have a
white handkerchief tied around it at the top.)
The spirit level and box is then moved and
set up again over where the staff was held and
the staff moved another ten feet lower down
the hill, and so on until the whole distance is
levelled—all the differences of level (less the
height of the box in each case) from point to
point being then added together to find the total
difference in level from starting point to finish.
By careful levelling and sighting in this way
a very accurate result may be obtained.

ALL ORDERS AND CONTRACTS are subject to approval on presentation to the Com-

IN THE EVENT OF ANY DELIVERY OR INSTALLATION to be made by the Company
being delayed by strikes, lockouts, floods, war, accident, fire, perils of the sea or
river, transport delays, influx of orders, failure of manufacturers or suppliers to
the Company to deliver, or any other cause or contingency, occasioning delay, such
delivery or installation will be made as soon as reasonably practicable after such
cause or contingency ceases to affect the same and the Company will not be re-
sponsible for any delay in delivery or installation resulting from any cause or
contingency.
DELIVERY : On rails or boat as shown on our quotations. Claims cannot be recognised
for damage or loss in transit; such must be made on the Transport Authorities.
(NOTE ; Instruct carriers to check the number and condition of packages before signing the delivery
receipt. If there is any discrepancy or damage, claim on the Railway, Shipping, or Carrying Company,
and also advise us. The Company is not responsible for any loss in transit but, if advised, will make
every effort to trace.)
If, through error, the Company’s packer despatches short supplies of any p?-'
the Company will rectify by supplying the parts delivered on rails or boat- ne
point of original delivery of the goods.
QUOTATIONS ; Every effort will be made to keep quotations open as long as possible,
but they are subject to alteration without notice.
CREDITS: No goods are to be returned for credit without our written consent, and
then consignor’s name and address must be on the shipping tag.
SOUTHERN CROSS DISTRIBUTORS : Those firms or persons whom the Company styles
as its distributors are not authorised to advertise, incur any debts, receive pay-
ments, or enter into any contract, on the Company’s account. Nor are they
authorised to give any warranty, nor to make any representations on the Com-
pany’s behalf, other than those contained in the Warranty contained herein. If
the term “Agent” is used it is used in a complimentary sense only.
ILLUSTRATIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS : While every care is taken in the prepara-
tion of this catalogue (which cancels all previous editions), illustrations, specifi-
cations, weights and dimensions must not be taken as binding, alterations being
found necessary from time to time as improvements are made.
