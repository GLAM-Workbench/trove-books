Improved Plate Bending and Straightening Machines.
These machines are self-contained on one strong foundation plate,
requiring little or no foundation. The machines are double geared, and the
driving motion is carried at one end of the machine, the other end being free
from gearing. One end of the frame is made in halves, firmly held together
by cotter-bolts. After a plate has been formed into an entire circle, one of
the cotter-bolts is removed, the top part of framing is swung clear, and the
tube withdrawn; the framing can be instantly adjusted. All the rollers are
made of solid forged iron or steel. Steel pinions on roller ends, also steel
carrier pinion. The machines are fitted with fast and loose pulleys, with
reversing motion.

These hammers are suitable for all classes
of general work and repetition forgings.
Ram works in planed channels and pro-
vision is made for taking up wear. The dies
are of steel.
Crank Plate connection gives a perfect
“whip” stroke. The connection between ram
and crank pin form a combination giving the
ram a perfectly cushioned blow. So flexible is
the ram that work from iin, to 4in. diam. can
be worked without any adjustment whatever.
Friction device is operated by foot lever.
The friction spider is keyed to the shaft and
has a long hub forming the bearing for the
pulley. Pulley is cast integral with the friction
ring. Efficient lubrication of pulley bearings is
provided.
No countershaft is required, drive being direct from line-shaft or motor.
Pulley can be run in either direction.
Adjustable Anvil Blocks are supplied with hammers of 1 2 5 lbs. capacity
and upwards.


Steam Hammers.
To work up to 801bs. pressure.
Can be worked with weight of piston rod and
head only, or by instantaneously adjusting lever by
hand for steam pressure.
This illustration represents type of hammer with
anvil block and column as separate castings.
Piston and Rod are forged together.
Pistons have “Ramsbottom” rings, easily re-
placed, being standard.
Hammer Head of cast steel or forged iron with
steel face.
Stop Valve arranged so that operator can close
or open after each heat, ensuring quick shut-off of
steam. No waste.
Anvil Blocks are fitted with cast steel faces
Valve Chest placed high up to allow live steam
to enter into cylinder at once, and giving facility
for examining joints, and obviates necessity of
removing cylinder.
Steam Consumption.—Similar to steam engine
cylinder of same capacity.
Self-acting motion (quoted as an extra) can be
fitted to any size, and consists of lever arrange-
ment, working with piston rod. The self-acting
motion also allows the use of the hammer as a
hand-geared one.
Pneumatic Hammers.

METAL SLITTING SAWS.
The manufacture of Metal Slitting Saws is a speciality with The Brooke
Tool Manufacturing Co. Ltd., and its experience in this direction enables it
to claim that its saws are unequalled for quality of material and finish.
The sides are ground slightly concave to give sufficient clearance in
cutting deep work, and all traces of scale are removed in the grinding process.
The teeth are cut to give the maximum efficiency, and the hole is finished
concentric with the teeth.
Careful attention is paid to the hardening and tempering of these tools.
High-speed saws can be run at three to four times the speed, and with
a much greater feed than is possible with carbon steel saws. It is essential,
however, that they run absolutely true, and are held firmly on the arbor.
They must be kept flooded with oil to obtain the best results, and must be
brought up to the work with an even feed, and not allowed to engage
suddenly.

SOLE AGENTS FOR
“LIGHTNING” QUICK CHANGE CHUCKS.
(Registered). (WEAVER'S PATENT).
FOR
OUTPUT.
All waaring parts
Hardened and Ground.
FOR
HIGH DUTY,
Collets made
interchangeable.
Drills and tools instantly changed and without stopping the Machine.
Can be used in any Machine Spindle, horizontal or vertical.
Floating action for accurate reamering, etc., when required.
Two Hardened Steel Balls, held in position by a spring controlled sliding outer case.
ngage m grooves in the collets or tool shanks, and when this case is raised (it may be
held stationary, up or down, with the machine running at full speed) the balls are free
to move into a recess, thus releasing the Collet, and enabling the tools to be changed
without stopping the Machine.
This effects a saving of minutes on every operation.


Drill Chucks—with Keys.
The special features of this chuck are the toothed sleeve and key. By means
of this key, a drill, tap, or other tool can be easily and secured tightened; but
as the action of the key differs from the ordinary wrench, in that it is not
inclined to revolve the spindle, this chuck is far more effective than others
which require the use of one hand for tightening and the other for holding
the spindle.

Milling and Keyway Cutting Attachment for Lathes.
Attached to the Saddle of Lathe.
The illustration shows our Improved Milling and Keyway Cutting Attachment fitted to the carriage
of a 6in. centre lathe. The depth of the cut is controlled by the feed of the carriage, the length b>
the cross feed screw, and the graduated screw at the top takes care of the vertical motion. The
attachment swivels all the way around like the compound rest, and is graduated in degrees. In
addition, it swivels on the upright angle plate 180 degrees; and is graduated. There is a graduated
collar on the vertical screw, reading in one-thousandths of an inch.
This attachment is designed for 6in. lathes, but it can also be fitted, by a mechanic, to lathes of
other sizes that are equipped with a compound rest.
The regular equipment consists of milling attachment, two steel V blocks, one crank handle, one
double end wrench, and two bolts and nuts for attaching.
Arbors and cutters are not included in the price of the attachment, but are extras

Curved Track for Portable or Permanent Lines.
We can curve rails to any radius required.
Always give radius to centre line of track.
When laying track on curves, it is advisable to relieve the side pressure on the wheel
flanges against the rails, due to the tendency of the rolling stock to travel in a straight line.
When possible, this is accomplished by raising the outer rail of the curve by packing up
the sleepers. A useful formula for obtaining the correct amount of super elevation is;—
V 2 x 5
E =
2 R
When E Super elevation in inches
Speed of train in miles per hour
° = Radius of curve in feet
Constant for 4ft. gauge.
For other gauges. E is in direct ratio as the gauge is to 4ft. ln addition, it is
advisable to have a check rail on curves 100 feet and less, in addition to the super
elevation.

PERMANENT POINTS
AND CROSSINGS.
For these we supply only the points and stock
rails, with chairs and soleplates, the crossing,
guard rails, connecting rod and fittings.
The length of points and crossings varies in
accordance with the radius required.
The points are carefully planed and accurately
fit the stock rails.
The crossings are rivetted to strong steel-
plates, except when otherwise specified. The
inclination depends on the radius of curves.
The intermediate rails shown in white on Fig.

“REDGE” GRIST MILL, No. 1.
It is well known that ground bones and shells, cracked corn, etc., are excellent for Poultry.
These Mills are adapted for grinding bones (when dry only) oyster and other shells, corn,
roots, bark, grain, salt, etc.
BALL BEARING.
SIZE OF MILL, x 9. DIMENSION OF THROAT, 2i x 1.
SIZE OF HOPPER, x 4s. LENGTH OF HANDLE, 10 INCHES.
WEIGHT, 12 LBS.
They are most suitable Mills for Farmers and Poultrymen, etc., and
attention is drawn to the following main features:—
The crusher on the spindle has a positive drive.
It is fitted with a Ball-Bearing Thrust which ensures easy and smooth running.
The thumb screw adjustment, with lock nut, regulates the crushers so that the
3 corn, etc., may be either merely cracked, or ground to a fine meal.
The body is of cast iron, but the crushers are of White Hermatite and very hard.
Special attention has been given to the finish, and this combined with the efficiency
of the article makes it a high-grade Mill.
Spare parts can be supplied as follows:
Body. Handle complete. Hopper.
Crusher (loose). Crusher (fixed). Cover.
THESE MILLS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR GRINDING “GREEN BONES,” WHICH
SHOULD BE SHAVED, NOT GROUND.

26-INCH BALL-BEARING BAND SAW.
TYPE W.D.J.
Serial No. 1031.
SPECIFICATION.
26" BALL-BEARING BAND
SAW.
This Band Saw has been cor-
rectly designed for modern
requirements. It is generally
as per illustration.
The Frame is cast in one
piece, cored out, making an
extremely rigid hollow cast-
ing free from vibration. It
has an exceptionally wide
base.
The Table is C.I. strongly
ribbed and planed true. It is
supported in a machined
rocker and held in position by
lever clamp. It is made to
tilt to about 45 for bevel
and conical sawing.
Auxiliary Table is of C.I. and
is held securely to the column.
Wheels are of C.I. turned
and balanced correctly and
secured to the spindles which
run in ball bearings. The
upper wheel is vertically ad-
justable and may also be tilted
for tracking of blades. Both
wheels are faced with rubber
bands which are securely vul-
canised to position.
Shafts and Bearings are of
proper diameter truly finished
and correctly arranged for
lubrication.
Guide Post is a hexagon steel
bar mounted in white metal
babited box and can be
securely clamped in any re-
quired position. (On the
26" machine it is not pro-
vided with compensating
spring as shown on the illus-
tration.)
Guides. Improved frictionless roller guides are used.
Guards. This machine can be supplied fitted with swinging guards completely covering
he wheels, either of heavy wire mesh, or plain steel, at an extra price.
PRINCIPAL DIMENSIONS.
Wheels, 26 ' diameter x \\" wide.
Clearance table to under side of guide, 8".
Table, 20" x 23".
Fast and loose pulley, 9" x 2\" .
Floor space, about 30" x 18".
Speed, about 600 R.P.M.

CROSS-CUT SAW.
Size.
24in. Saw and 30in. Saw.
Ball bearings throughout.
T hese machines are specially
designed to meet the require-
ments of Box Factories,
Planing Mills, etc.
Features.
They cut accurately, vibra-
tion is practically eliminated,
they run continuously day
after day, with hardly any
attention. Easy to swing,
thus assuring a large output
and continuous running.
Suspension.
The saw frame is a one-piece
casting, diagonally braced to
give strength and rigidity.
The countershaft housing Top
Bracket is a one-piece casting,
constructed to ensure perfect
alignment of the countershaft
at all times; a condition often
lacking and a source of much
trouble in saws suspended
from separate hangers.
Pivoting Feature.
The method of pivoting the
saw frame at points just
below the countershaft bear-
ings housings, rather than
from the countershaft direct,
accomplishes two important
results, viz., the saw and
frame are freed from counter-
shaft v.bration, and the belt is
automatically tightened as the
saw enters the cut, because of
the increased distance between
pulleys at that point of the
swing.
The Bearings.
Both countershaft bearings and saw spindle bearings are fitted with double-row ball races.
