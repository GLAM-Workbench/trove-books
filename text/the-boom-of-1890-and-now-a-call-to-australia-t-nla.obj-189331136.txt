THE BOOM OF 1888 TO 1890, AND SOME
ANALOGIES WITH THE PRESENT
The average man who loves a gamble turns a blind
eye to any likeness between the sound prosperity on
the continuance of which he budgets, and the booms
or manias of long ago. Things are different now,
he assures you as he shakes off the warning hand on
his shoulder. But common prudence bids us turn
even the distasteful pages of our history.
From the early seventies to the middle eighties
Eastern Australia had a run of good seasons, con-
trasting favourably with the alternation of flood and
drought, and the political turmoils which had filled
the sixties. Real prosperity in wool-growing, the
great staple industry, was the result. The gold
yield was slowly falling, it is true, but, as there was
a world-wide increase in the demand for it, the
gold won went further in buying imports. (Sec

did not injure the colonies in the seventies and early
eighties. It affected manufactures more than the
raw-materials by whose export they lived. Such fall
as occurred in the price of wool was more than off-
set by the occupation and improvement of new
country. In all items the cost of running sheep
fell, until the prosperity brought rising wages during
the eighties. Runs were fenced, dams and wells
sunk, roads and railways laid down to cheapen and
expedite transport.
“Progressive public works policies” had come into
vogue during the middle seventies. They may be
dated from the vigorous advocacy of railway build-
ing by Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New
South Wales. Sir Hercules missed no chance of
emphasizing the saving of time, money and energy
in bringing wool to market and stores to the stations
by the substitution of the railway train for the slow
inefficient old bullock-waggons. Wherever wool
traffic offered in any quantity the case for railway
transport was overwhelming. The locomotive
worked for shillings where the bullocks cost pounds.
With the surplus the squatter could buy the freehold
of his run, fence it, sink dams and wells, ring-bark
the timber in thick country, seed it with new grasses,

In 1893 the production in W.A. was £421,000. In
1899 the production in the Commonwealth reached
£14,661,253 —a record for the century-
—of which
£6,246,733 came from W.A.
and generally lift its carrying capacity. Small
wonder that flocks multiplied and exports grew.
The total number of sheep in Australia rose from
46 million in 1873 to 62 million in 1884, and to
over the hundred million in the early nineties: 316
million pounds of wool were exported in 1886, over
600 million pounds in 1891.

Small wonder, too, that governments which had
launched out cautiously into the building of long
railways were encouraged to venture further by
buoyant revenues from them, and from the sale
of Crown land. In 1871 Government indebtedness
was £30,000,000. An additional £36,000,000 were
borrowed during the ten years that followed, and
spent mainly on railways. Well spent, too. In
spite of gross political interference, the railways
earned interest at high rates on the loan money.
♦Coghlan: Seven Colonies, 1902, p. 377.


But the railways did more. They created an
expectation of expansion unlimited. Cheap trans-
port so increased the squatter’s profits that the banks
became eager to finance the purchase of runs, either
through dummy selectors, or at Crown lands
auctions. In the five years 1876 to 1880, eight
millions of British capital came to N.S.W., for in-
vestment as deposits, and share capital in the banks,
or as the capital of pastoral land and finance com-
panies. Through either channel the new money
financed the purchase and improvement of station
property, which in those days absorbed about two-
thirds of all bank advances. As a direct result, up
went the government revenues, drawn mainly from
the sale of land. N.S.W. received £12,000,000 in
this way during the period 1876 to 1880. The
ease in getting this revenue begot the idea, not in
Australia alone, that a new age was dawning in the
colonies, more marvellous than that of gold.
After 1880 the productive flow of British loans
swelled rapidly, £37,500,000 being poured into the
treasuries of N.S.W., Victoria, South Australia and
Queensland between 1881 and 1885. Perhaps
another £30,000,000 found inlets through private
investment. The colony or leader who failed to
B


borrow money so freely offered was regarded as
Jacking faith in Australia’s future, as almost a con-
servative.
In 1884 to 1886, however, New South Wales
received a reminder that seasons had not always
been favourable, and could not be counted upon in-
definitely. A drought, beginning early in 1884 and
lasting well into 1886, caused heavy losses of cattle
and sheep, and dried up an incipient boom in Sydney
and suburban blocks. Simultaneously the price of
wool dropped from in the grease, at which
it had been steady for a decade, to a lb. in 1886.
This made the repayment of drought-time and
earlier advances heavy work, indeed an impossible
task, even after the drought had broken. In South
Australia it did not break until 1887, and in
February 1886 the Commercial Bank of South
Australia suspended payment.
As it turned out, these inoculations against the
boom-fever saved New South Wales and South
Australia from worse ills, but they did not stop the
flood of British capital seeking the land of the
golden fleece. They concentrated it, however, on
Victoria which had almost escaped the drought. In
the five years 1886 to 1890 over £100,000,000 of


capital went into Eastern Australia, the govern-
ments borrowing £49,000,000 between them, and
£53,200,000 seeking profit through private channels.
Victoria took more than half of this avalanche, viz.,
17 millions from loan funds, and 37.7 millions pri-
vately. This is T. A. Coghlan’s estimate. H. G.
Turner puts the figure for 1885-91 at £44,000,000,
distributed as follows:
Government borrowing £19,500,000
Tramways, Harbour & Fire
Brigade Trusts 2,750,000
Debentures etc. of Pastoral Com-
panies 4,000,000
Debentures of Property Investment
Companies 1,500,000
Melbourne and Suburban Municipal-
ities 1,050,000
Banks and Land Companies Shares
sold in London 700,000
British Deposits in established
Banks 5,000,000
Deposits in Land Banks 3,500,000
Advances on mortgage etc., by
private individuals 6,000,000


The figures of Victorian imports and exports for
1885-1891 inclusive, which, apart from the intro-
duction of fresh capital, should show an excess of
exports to meet the interest bill on previous borrow-
ings, were
Imports £148,000,000
Exports 94,000,000
The population of Victoria numbered less than a
million at the end of the period, the men of working
age only 350,000.
That is to say, Victoria in 7 years received
£54,000,000 plus the interest due in London for
those years. No community of such puny size, how-
ever fertile its territory, could be expected to put to
effective use in new production such masses of new
capital within so few years. After the Franco-Prus-
sian War, a war indemnity only twice as large had
set up a crisis of over-capitalization in Germany, a
community thirty times as large.
Undoubtedly Victoria had great and sound
attractions. In quality and preparation for market
her wool had long held first place. Her gold pro-
duction had been phenomenal and was still high.
The solution of the problem of freezing mutton


for export, achieved in the early eighties, promised
a new commercial opening to her pastoralists. In
1879 Australia had become self-sufficient in cereals
for the first time, and Victorian farmers, aided by
recruits from South Australia, were increasing stead-
ily their surplus of wheat for export to Europe,
Queensland and New South Wales. Alfred Deakin’s
plans for the irrigation of large areas in the Goul-
burn and Wimmera Valleys were to add fruit-grow-
ing, dairying and viticulture to her primary activities.
To serve this broad productive programme a network
of railways was being boldly planned and rapidly
constructed.
Her city-artisans counted Melbourne’s manu-
factures as an extra strength. The author of her
protective tariff certainly intended to make manu-
facturing more profitable to the local factories.
Whether they thus became brakes upon the export-
ing industries or no, the possession of those factories
led the Victorians to regard themselves as a more
mature and many-sided community, certain of a
future supremacy in the Australian market.
Nor was the zeal for development shown be-
tween 1871 and 1891 in all the colonies altogether


fruitless and ill-advised. Substantially increased
production, at least up to 1885, showed a margin
of prosperity, apart from fresh borrowings and in
spite of slowly receding prices. The total values
of Australian production in the census years, 1871,
1881 and 1891 were £46,700,000, £71,116,000 and
£96,086,000, working out at £27/17/2, £3l/1/3,
and £29/19/9 per head. Had there been no break
in prices after 1884, the results would have been
more striking and the tonic effect of a margin over
the interest-bill would have been maintained. Pro-
duction per head would have been worth, at 1871
prices, £37/5/0 in 1881, £4B/18/- in 1891. What
caused the smash in 1893, at the end of a rush down
hill from 1890 on, was
0) an acceleration of government and other
capital expenditure after 1887, in providing
for a continued progress that did not happen,
because of
(2) a deep rut in the value of staple exports —
the firm road on which progress had hitherto
moved from strength to strength.
Liet us follow out these two aspects in more detail.


The Growth of Government and other
Capital Expenditure.
1. To lay out within five years a hundred millions
of outside money on capital works in a community
of at most three million people, as was done be-
tween 1886 and 1890, was to withdraw large bodies
of men from the work that sets new exports flow-
ing, to boost wages and material costs of construction
and to retard the success of enterprise along es-
tablished lines. To invest extra profits or even to
put new capital into staple industries gives men rope
to carry out plans of expansion of which they have
long dreamed and for which they have matured
their plans on economical lines. That is how we
use much of our loan money in Western Australia
through the Agricultural Bank. But most of the
new money in Eastern Australia went into construc-
tion works about the cities, or into railways of
dubious utility. This lop-sided haste to build,
clogged progress in the export industries, which only
moved forward again after it had ceased.
The danger was not unforeseen. Caution to
keep the balance true between new construction and
the effective use of existing public works had


marked the loan expenditure of the seventies. To
maintain it the Victorian Government in 1885 set up
independent Railway Commissioners, under Richard
Speight of the English Midland Company. The
new officers, given a judicial security of tenure, were
to stop political patronage and log-rolling, and to
confine the use of new loans to building railways
likely to pay interest almost at once. New South
Wales sought a similar restraint by her Public Works
Act of 1888, setting up a Committee charged with
the scrutiny of every project advanced by im-
portunate “local members.” The outcome in Vic-
toria, however, was the very reverse of what the
Premier, James Service, intended. Speight suc-
cumbed to his environment, caught the feverish
spirit of speculation and warmly backed every
parliamentary railway. Lulled into a false security
by his reputation for close calculation, the business
community gave itself up to the fascinating game of
expansion on time payment. Its private borrowing
added to government spending on irrigation and
railways an expensive installation of cable trams,
docks and wharves, and, above all, ornate stucco
mansions on every hill-top round Melbourne’s outer
suburbs. Nearer the industrial centres spread row


upon row of terrace houses for workmen and
salaried officials.
This gay spending meant steady employment at
wages rivalling those of the digging days for all
hands, skilled and unskilled. The cost of living was
low, and workmen flocked to Melbourne from the
country, from Tasmania and from Adelaide, to save
money and buy homes for their old age. The
building societies were swollen beyond the co-
operative task of pooling their members savings,
and took to accepting deposits for short periods, in
•order to buy land and erect cottages in anticipation
of the growing demand for them, on hire-purchase.
Some of the pastoral land companies began to
dabble in this lucrative business, while wool prices
were low and station improvement sluggish. Com-
peting land-jobbers also soon warmed to the game.
Building cottages locked up capital until the time
payments came in. Buying, sub-dividing and selling
land by auction was quicker work, especially with
employees as bidders to help prices along. “Free
conveyances carried people to the sales”—they were
usually held on Saturday afternoon—“champagne
lunches gave them courage to bid, and extraordinary
c


terms of credit reconciled them to their purchases.”
(Coghlan.)
Gyles Turner (II p. 292) tells how 36 companies
issued their prospectuses on the Melbourne Stock
Exchange between 12 May and 14 June 1888.
Of their £3,750,000 subscribed capital, £1,550,000
was called up, and during the same month other new
issues totalled £1,160,000 with an uncalled liability
of £660,000. All but three or four were on land
business bent.
Land-booming was certainly a fascinating game.
Raising money on the security of a block of land
and on time payment like every loan of money, you
floated a land and finance company to buy that land
—also on time payment. The company, out of share
capital partly paid up, or debenture money on time
payment, bought more land on time payment, sub-
divided it and sold the blocks, or some of them, on
time payment. Out of the proceeds, including of
course the future instalments on the blocks sold, it
declared a handsome dividend. Up went the stock
exchange prices of its shares, and at this point you
sold out. But you still kept an eye on the old com-
pany and on your reputation as a shrewd judge of
property, by buying a good block of its shares out


of the funds of your new land and mortgage bank,
even lending it money with which to buy more land
from the new venture, on time payment.
the banks had already foreseen danger in this
maze during 1887. During that year the total
deposits in Australian banks increased by £12,000,000
while their advances went up only £3,000,000. In
Melbourne, then the financial centre, the Associated
Banks reduced the interest on fixed deposits from
6to 5, and later to 4 per cent. Early in 1888 they
shut down on all further advances on real estate.
It was too late. The ball was rolling, and they
lacked means to stop it. In a market like wheat or
cotton, or even in stocks and shares, they might have
gone further and checked mere gambling on the
rise by selling for future delivery, “bearing” the
market to the general advantage in the end. But
you cannot sell f.a.q. land for future delivery, and
the banks’ measures to discourage booming stopped
short of “bearing” the shares of their own clients.
Refusals to lend more on land only threw their
depositors, dissatisfied with 4 per cent, into the
arms of the worst offenders. An untimely amend-
ment of the Victorian Banking Act in 1888 permitted
any incorporated banking company to advance or


lend money on the security of lands, houses, ships
and pledges of merchandise. This was the land-
jobbers > chance. If the existing banks would not
do it, new ones would. Land companies and build-
ing societies promptly turned themselves into or
begat banks—if they had not already done so on
the strength of the older banks’ long unauthorized
practice of such advances. The mushroom land
banks went to all lengths in raking in money. James
Munro (who became Premier in 1890 and Agent-
General in 1892), formed in May 1887 the Real
Estate Bank, with a nominal capital of £1,000,000,
consisting partly of progressive shares, on which 1/-
was payable at allotment, and 1/- a month until
50/- a share had been paid. According to its pros-
pectus, the bank was founded “for the purpose of
enabling the industrial and thrifty classes to partici-
pate in the distribution of real estate, or secure a
portion of the large profits which are made by pur-
chasing land in large quantities and selling the same
in moderate sized farms or allotments.”
Depositors were enticed away from the older
banks by the payment of one or two per cent extra.
British deposits were collected by agents, largely
Scots lawyers, helped on by the registration of


London boards of advice, with ex-Governors, ex-
Premiers and Agents-General as figure-heads.
Every experienced banker in Australia was already
predicting an early collapse of the crazy business in
1888, but fresh British deposits kept the ball roll-
ing up-hill for two years longer. The distant fields
were still green. Excellent harvests in 1889, ex-
tensive fresh discoveries in the Broken Hill silver-
lead field, and a big increase in the gold yield made
splendid talking points in attracting more British
money. Up to 1880 British deposits in Australian
banks had been small, less than £10,000,000 in all.
In 1891 they reached £39,800,000 in banks, old
and new, £4,500,000 in building societies, and
£5,000,000 in other trading companies. £1,839,000
had come out in 1886, over seven millions in 1887,
£7,858,000 in 1888, £4,231,000 in 1889, £4,567,000
in 1890. During 1891 only £155,000 was obtained
on balance. The cow was dry.
2. The immediate occasion of the smash, the rut
at the bottom of the hill, was a belated realization
that the fall in wool prices had come to stay. To
those who cared to think, it was plain in 1889 that
a continuance of the low prices for wool and other
exports would soon stop high spending and make the

liquidation of public and private obligations over-
sea heavy work. Coglan’s index numbers for
imports and exports show how the terms on which
Australia traded were altering for the worse, after
1888.
We may put these facts another way. Up to the year
1887 the falling value of Australian exports, though
in itself depressing to rural industry, was not in-
jurious because it was more than offset by a greater
fall in the prices of imports. After that date, the
reverse was true, exports declining by 32 per cent
between 1888 and 1894 as compared with a fall in
prices of imports of only per cent. Here are

the prices of wool (greasy) and store bullocks with
which the pastoral industry had to face its over-
drafts.
In other words, the margins on advances to pastoral-
ists were swept away, and the banks came into pos-
session of many stations, former owners remaining,
if at all, as salaried managers. Attempts by some
of the banks to mend their position by new advances
to primary producers, at the lower values, were
stultified by the continued fall of prices, by drought,
and after 1890 by labour troubles. Wheat was no
stand-by in those days. The harvest of 1885 was
deficient, and the colonies other than Victoria had
to rely on imports from overseas, at an average


price of during 1886. In 1886, though there
was a surplus for export, the price at which the bulk
of the crop sold was 3/4. In 1887 a good harvest
left eleven million bushels for sale abroad, at about
the same price. In 1888 a poor harvest meant im-
ports again, at about 4/7J a bushel. The 1889 crop
was excellent and in January 1890 wheat for export
was selling at 4/3 a bushel. This was nothing, how-
ever, to set against the damage to Australian credit
from wide-spread failures in the Argentine, a very
similar country, early in that year. In November
came the resounding collapse of Barings, the Lon-
don bankers who had ventured most in the Argen-
tine. On December 20, 1890, the Premier Building
Association, Melbourne, suspended payment. It
had numerous British depositors, and withdrawals
from other land and building companies began
forthwith. Australian loans were very coldly re-
ceived in London during 1891 and on September
12 of that year “The Economist” newspaper was
warning British investors against the land banks,
“cancerous growths upon the otherwise sound body
of Victorian finance.” It had good cause. Twenty-
one land and finance companies went down in Mel-
bourne between July 1891 and August 1892, with


liabilities of £13,500,000, including 3% millions of
British Deposits. The end had come of borrowing
money for short terms and spending it on the chance
of its being re-paid over long periods.
Worse followed. In August 1891 the Bank of
Van Diemen’s Land failed. In March 1892 the
Mercantile Bank of Victoria followed, and in
January 1893 the fall of the Federal Bank made
the first breach in the serried array of Associated
Banks. That the agony was so long drawn out was
due to the active pursuit, to the very end, of fresh
British money, not only by the land banks but also
by some of the associated banks of issue. Most
adventurous in this were the Commercial Bank of
Australia and the Bank of Victoria. Though the
Commercial’s Australian deposits were falling after
1890 at the rate of £400,000 a year, its British de-
posits still rose until they stood at £5,638,000 early
in 1893. At best, this British money only post-
poned the trouble, for in the profound depression
which had set in the rates paid for it could not be
earned by advances on sound security. Construction
work on the Melbourne tramways and other public
utilities had ceased in 1889. Early in 1890 building
of all kinds stopped suddenly and absolutely. Half-
D


finished houses fell into ruin. Public works were cut
off short in 1891 when London ceased to lend. Un-
employment was universal and clamant. Certain
to be withdrawn at the end of its term of one, two
or three years, the British money had in its rebound
a fatally disintegrating effect on the solidarity of
the banks. The Union, the Australasia, and the big
Sydney banks, which had limited or reduced their
overseas liabilities, dared not come to the aid of
their more adventurous associates. A withdrawn
British deposit had to be paid in London by a new
export of goods or gold—a much more serious
matter than the paying off of an Australian deposit,
which though withdrawn from one bank would
come in again at another. This was the danger which,
despite an apparent plethora of cash, forced the
various banks to stand aloof from one another when
it came to the pinch in April and May of 1893.
In March of 1892 when the land banks were
tumbling down in rows the Associated Banks had
published a resolution “That the Associated Banks
in Melbourne have agreed upon mutually satisfac-
tory conditions on which they will extend their joint
support to any one of their number requiring it.”
But when in January 28 1893 the Federal Bank of


Australia closed its doors, the Associated Banks, in
explanation of their refusal to absorb and liquidate
it with open doors, issued another resolution “That
the liquidation of one of their number was foreign
to their ordinary functions.” This gloss on the
previous pledge of solidarity astonished the public.
On March 15, the Associated Banks issued a third
resolution, intended to calm the dangerous appre-
hensions aroused by the Federal’s fall: “That the
Associated Banks of Victoria will be willing to
render financial assistance to each other on such
terms and to such extent as may seem justifiable to
each of them, if and when occasion arises.” This
the public rightly interpreted as a “Sauve qui
peut.” When a few weeks later four of the inner
circle suspended payment, only one, the Commercial
of Australia, made application for help. On April
4 H. Gyles Turner, the general manager of the
Commercial, laid his bank’s position before a meet-
ing of the Associated Banks and the Treasurer,
Downes Carter. It had been the most adventurous
and enterprising of the Melbourne banks, but “its
rise was too rapid, its dividends were too lavish, its
hunger for deposits too monstrous, culminating at
£13,100,000 in 1891, as against a paid up capital of


£1,200,000, a reserve of £750,000 and an unpaid
proprietors’ liability of £1,800,000.” (A.G.V. Peel.)
In the early months of 1893 its strength had run
from it, a million of local deposits being withdrawn
in 3 months, £115,000 being paid over the counter
in one day. It was known that the bulk of its
Scotch deposits would be withdrawn on May the first.
Turner asked aid from both Treasury and Associated
Banks. The Treasurer was afraid that a Govern-
ment note issue would depreciate. The banks
offered £1,750,000. It was not enough. On April
5 the doors closed.
Before the month was over, however, they had
opened again, as a new reconstructed bank, which
impounded £9,000,000 of the deposits, £5,500,000
of them British, as ordinary or as 5 per cent cumula-
tive preference capital. The depositors, long in an
agony of doubt as to their chance of seeing any of
their money again, accepted the reconstruction plan
with alacrity. It offered something definite at last.
Their alacrity seems, however, to have been al-
most a temptation to other banks in the same queer
street. On April 30 it came to the knowledge of the
Premier, J. B. Patterson, that the National would
suspend next day, and that others would follow suit.


Though it was Sunday, the Cabinet assembled, and
set off in a special train to the Administrator’s
country house, where the Executive Council issued
a proclamation declaring five days’ bank holiday.
The effect was chaos. Next day Collins-street rocked
with a crowd convinced one moment that all the
banks had failed, and the next that all would be
saved. “We were all floundering” was the Premier’s
clumsy comment. Fortunately the stronger banks,
such as the Union, the Australasia and the Wales,
refused to accept the moratorium and opened. But
all the Victorian banks except the Royal went into
reconstruction.
In Sydney, the Premier Sir George Dibbs kept a
cooler head. By May 3 he had realized that the
banks could not act in unison. Therefore he pushed
his own plan through the legislature, in three bills,
one making bank notes a first charge on their issuer’s
assets, the second permitting the Governor-in-Coun-
cil to make bank notes legal tender at the request of
any bank, and a third, somewhat later, permitting the
Treasury to issue notes and lend them to banks up
to half the amount of current accounts locked up.
In a palsy of apprehension the banks at first refused
to apply for aid, and the Commercial Banking C0m


pany of Sydney suspended on May 15, though it
had £1,000,000 in cash and only £600,000 British de-
posits to meet. Dibbs then exacted the needed re-
quest from the Bank of New South Wales, the
City Bank of Sydney, the Union, and the Australasia,
and made their notes legal tender, willy nilly. In-
stantly the air cleared. Sydney’s large gold stock,
no longer wanted there, could be used in case of
need to choke panic elsewhere. Calm succeeded
storm. On May 25 Cecil Rhodes, as Cape Premier,
offered to invest his government’s balance in New
South Wales or Victorian securities or in a new
loan to either. The offer was acknowledged in
handsome terms, but gratefully declined. “As an
indication of the pathway of future events,” com-
mented a British Treasury official later in the year,
“it is more to be studied than all the schemes of all
the imperialists.” It foreshadowed inter-Dominion
co-operation in central banking. In Victoria the
immediate task was to clear away the wreckage.
The reconstruction schemes locked up nearly
£20,000,000 of British deposits, at fixed interest
rates. Much had been lost in the land banks and
building societies. Australian credit in London was
for the time being at zero. Governments and private

citizens alike had to live painfully within their
diminished means. No longer could they supplement
the country’s production, to the extent of about 25
per cent per annum, by selling 1.0.U.’5. Yet in spite
of falling prices until after 1896 and a long drawn
drought from 1896 to 1902, increased production
from mines and farms and even from stations was
achieved, the interest bills were met, and the corner
turned at last.
A few figures are worth while to show the
burden of the debt service after the crash. De-
ducting from the value of annual production the
amount of overseas interest we get the living fund
of the community, the balance available for con-
sumption or exchange.
Per head of population the living fund, as I have
called it, was £25.5 in 1871, £29.3 in 1881, £26.5
in 1891, but only £21.2 in 1894. And prior to


1891 a full quarter had been added by fresh borrow-
ings each year. That the money was growing in
purchasing power throughout the period does not
affect the point that the burden of the external
payment, which grew with the value of money, was
made onerous to the breaking point by (a) with-
drawal of old loans, (b) cessation of new ones, and
(c) the shrunken value of exportable products.
But that was the aftermath.
My remaining task is to indicate certain analogies
between the boom period proper, 1888 to 1890, and
our own spacious times. They are all traceable to the
parallel growth of external debt. Said an English
observer in 1893: “According as Britain opens or
closes her hand to lend, so the prosperity of those
colonies advances or declines. But,” he added, “we
shall one day stand as borrowers in the markets of
Sydney and Melbourne.” Not, one imagines, until
Australia has more financial self-reliance than as yet.
That self-reliance will only grow when we can mark
the symptoms of over capitalization and eschew it.
The first is that slackening in the rate of expansion in
production which was marked in the late eighties
and is as marked now at least in Eastern Australia.


The check to expansion in either period may be
isolated by eliminating the influence of changing
monetary values. In 1871 Australian production
per head was £27/17/2. In 1881 £3l/1/3, in 1891
£29/19/9. The stagnation was more in value than
in quantity, for at 1871 prices the 1881 figure would
have been £37/5/- and the 1891 £4B/18/-. Even
these would have been disappointing figures in view
of the outpouring of capital on railways and other
equipment for national development. The values
realized were doubly so. Victoria’s production per
head was stagnant throughout the period in actual
value, being at £26/2/8 in 1871, and £26/9/3 in
1891. New South Wales showed £3O/5/3 in 1871,
£32/18/3 in 1881 and £32/3/5 in 1891. On
paper the post-war figures read well. In 1911 we
produced £4l/6/11 per head. In 1919-20 we pro-
duced £62/18/-, in 1920-21, £7l/5/11, in 1921-22,
£6l/12/1, in 1922-23, £66/3/11, in 1923-4,
£6B/6/10, and in 1924-5, £76/9/5. But after
taking out the increased prices factor, by means
of the production prices-index number, our post-
war efforts show up badly. At 1911 values our
production since 1919-20 has run thus; £33.54,
£37.3, £39.0, £37.76, £36.94 and £40.7 (1924-5)


as compared with 41.7 in 1911. Judging by the
growth of our cities and our loan estimates the
reason for this failure to achieve higher pro-
duction per head is our employment of too many
in preparing to handle such production, i.e., on
public works of a capital nature. Public works
are excellent things, but only so long as the
balance is preserved between capital and earning
power, between equipment and its use in furthering
production. Overset that balance and they become
a burden as voracious as the grasshopper.
A second common feature of the two periods is
the great growth in customs revenue, and the
temptation it affords to subsidize local governments
for road construction and the like. Given the fact
of an excess of revenue, this use of it in a land like
Australia is inevitable. The conditions of opening
up a fertile but pathless territory exercise a com-
pelling force over its temporary rulers. Duncan
Gillies, the Victorian Premier, in 1889 had little
option but to dissipate his accumulated surplus of
£1,607,000 in subsidies to municipalities and similar
local bodies. The surplus had arisen through an
abounding revenue from the customs, the con-
nection of which with public borrowing was quietly


ignored until too late. Between 1886 and 1891
there was an excess of Victorian imports over ex-
ports of some £45,000,000, the customs duties on
which must have averaged about 15 per cent, say
£6,750,000 in all. In one transaction the M. &M.
Board of Works had to pay over £175,000 in duty
on a million barrels of cement which it had bor-
rowed. **Of the seeming public income of Victoria,
an average of something more than a million a
year was really borrowed capital” (Flora Shaw,
Times Special Correspondent, 1893). Here was the
explanation of the collapse in the Customs revenue
which so baffled the veteran Protectionist, Graham
Berry, when as Shiels’s Treasurer in 1892, he in-
creased the duties to find a million of revenue and
to balance his budget. Poor Berry. He had so
long proclaimed the virtues of a high tariff in pro-
viding work and revenue, that he believed in them,
and could not realize that Victorian prosperity had
been due not to her tariff but to her borrowed
plumes. The inflow of borrowed goods ceasing,
down fell the customs revenue. The public income
of 1892-3 was really higher than before the boom,
but the temporary surplus for grants in aid to
municipalities had vanished. Only by a self-reliant


use of the colony’s primary resources, and an
economical administration of its railways was the
heavy interest bill of British lenders annually met,
and the public budget balanced at last on the eve of
federation.
A third analogy:—
The willingness of British investors to seek an out-
let in a prospering British community oversea was
in part due in the eighties, as now, to a paying off
of British Government securities. The heavy re-
demptions from sinking funds in which Gladstonian
finance took delight, and Goschen’s great conversion
in 1888-9 set funds adrift from Consols, just as the
post-war reductions of the War indebtedness have
done. In the modern instance, however, there is a
big change in the method of investing the money in
Australia. Once bitten twice shy. The British in-
vestor no longer ventures on speculative bank shares
and other private securities, but, with the encourage-
ment of the colonial Stocks Act, takes a general
mortgage over Australian tax-paying power by pur-
chasing government bonds.
A fourth similarity lies in the modern tendency to
strain for additional loans by piling Pelion on Ossa,
and pledging our resources, by a second mortgage,


to America. In the eighties the adventurous ones,
when the banks in Australia cried a halt, hied them
to London to tout for deposits, which became their
undoing in the hours of crisis. So too, our braver
spenders nowadays are all for borrowing in New
York, when London counsels prudence. But New
York lends on heavier terms, and stricter sinking
fund arrangements.
A final analogy. In New South Wales the
Committee of Public Works set up by Sir Henry
Parkes in 1888, though it had its failings, played
an important part in restraining the pace of loan
expenditure. So did Parkes’s more happily chosen
Chief Commissioner of Railways, Eddy, also ap-
pointed in 1888. Eddy raised the return on the
capital invested in the New South Wales railways
from 2.85 per cent to 3.58 per cent, and in tramways
from 1.98 per cent to 5.28 per cent. In criticizing,
restraining and supervising the projects of “local
members,” these two agencies did almost as much
as her free-trade policy towards maintaining the
balance in that State between works of development
and the vigorous use of resources laid open. Is it
too much to look to a strengthened Federal Loan
Council for a like restraint of public borrowing to


remunerative tasks? I would point as a loyal
Western Australian to the use made of loan money
here, under the direction of the Agricultural Bank
and its off-shoot the 1.A.8. In the hands of men
less gifted and less free than Lord Cromer in Egypt,
these institutions have done a similar work in build-
ing anew the earning power of the State along new
lines, when the assets for which we first plunged
into debt threatened to waste and fail us..
I am not insensible to the big contrast between
the late eighties and the present, in that we are en-
joying good prices for wool and wheat. But the
level of world prices may not prove stable. Whole-
sale prices have been falling steadily of late and we
cannot afford to mortgage every fresh margin of our
living fund. Falling prices and the cessation of over-
seas credit wrought a painful havoc on the living fund
of Australia in the nineties. A like combination of
circumstances would do so again. At present the bal-
ance for home consumption or exchange, after meet-
ing our overseas interest bill on the public debt, seems
very buoyant. The incidence of the fall in prices has
hitherto spared our staples. From £4l per head in
1911 the living fund had grown to £66.87 in 1921,
and to £70.92 in 1925, despite an increased external
indebtedness of £275,350,000 since 1911, which in

Our living fund, as it is, is worth less in commodities
than it was in 1911 —£35 in 1921 and £37 in 1925
as compared with £4l in 1911. And the baleful
alliance of London and New York money-lenders
with short-term office-holders in Australia may be
relied upon quickly to work off any even apparent
monetary margin, if we will permit them.
