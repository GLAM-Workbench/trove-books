AUSTRALASIAN COLONIES.
Disadvantages of present position of Australasian Colonies.
Therb can be no doubt that the forces and tendencies within and
external to the Australasian Colonies at the present time must sooner
or later inevitably cause them to give up a portion of the powers and
privileges of self-government which they now possess and exercise as
semi-independent States, for the purpose of creating some link or tie
which will enable them to draw closer together in their commercial and
industrial relations; and particularly to enable them to act unitedly in
all things of common interest. On the commercial and industrial side,
the present war of hostile tariffs between sister colonies is an evil
which day by day assumes a more serious aspect, and sooner or later,
if allowed to continue, will produce the most rancorous and selfish
feelings, leading to danger and weakness in the face of enemies, and
the arrest of healthy development in all local industries. This lack of
unity, together with the multiplicity of independent law-making centres,
leads to many anomalies and mutual friction, and adds greatly to the
cost of government.
It is manifest, therefore, that peoples so intimately related by ties of
blood, by material and social interests, and by geographical contiguity,
should federate under one central government in such a way as would
ensure unity of action in all matters affecting the common interests of
the Colonies, while preserving to each Colony perfect control of such
local matters as are likely to be jeopardised by undue centralization.
Over-centralization to he avoided.
The disadvantages of lack of unity among the Australasian Colonies
are generally admitted. But many thoughtful persons believe that
dangers and disadvantages of another kind would be certain to attend
a federation in which a wholesale transfer to the central authority
of the majority of the functions now performed by the governments of
the separate Colonies would be involved, and that such dangers


and disadvantages would be more irksome to be borne than those
now caused by the absence of some bond of unity. It is unmis-
takable that a young colony’s welfare and development depend
largely upon the timely construction of roads, bridges, harbours,
and other public works, the necessity of which can be fully known
only to the persons immediately affected by the absence of them;
and if the function of providing such works should be handed
over to a far distant central authority, local representation in that
authority would necessarily be so small, that the hardy pioneer
would have scarcely a perceptible share in it. In young thinly peopled
Colonies, therefore, the great danger to be avoided is undue central-
ization of power; for it is manifest that the general expenditure upon
public works, which forms the “burning questions” in local politics,
would be apt to be unfairly distributed, especially as regards large areas
thinly populated. It is evident that the majorities in the thickly
populated centres would rule and dominate over all thinly populated
areas, and they could also neglect or ignore the claims of such areas far
more securely than could possibly be done under a local government.
The voice of the struggling settler in Ringarooma, for example, would
be hardly heeded or heard in a Federal Legislature of Australasia,
although in the existing" Parliament of Tasmania he may be a political
power, who cannot be silenced or ignored with impunity. The only
way of securing unity without involving the evils due to over-
centralization would be to adopt the distinctive feature of the
Constitution of the United States of America, which delegates a limited
number of specific powers to the Federal Legislature, and reserves to
the separate States all powers not included in those specifically delegated
to the central authority. We want to see a Federation in the true
sense of the word, —a union of self-governing Provinces, and not an
amalgamation of Colonies, from the Governments of which the
majority of their present functions have been torn to an extent that
would reduce them to the level of the position of large municipal
councils.
Financial Difficulties
Although there are financial difficulties standing in the way, they are
not insuperable, and so soon as the nature of the Union is determined
upon, it will, I think, be possible to devise a systematic scheme
whereby all such matters as inequalities of existing Debts, See.
may be equitably provided for and adjusted. It is certain that if the
Federal Government receives ail revenue from Customs and .Excise, and
from Post and Telegraph service, such revenue will greatly exceed
year by year the amount of its expenditure in the performance of such
federal functions as will be allotted to it on the basis of any union that
will substantially preserve the self-government of the separate Provinces
in regard to all local interests.
It has been thought and stated that the great financial difficulty in
the path of Australasian Federation will be found in the large dimi-
nution of the Revenue collected under a Federal Tariff compared with
the total amount of all the Revenues now derived by the several Colonies


from their separate Tariffs, inconsequence of the establishment of free
trade among the several Provinces of the Federation. The difference
between the Revenue that would be derived from a Federal Tariff with
inter-provincial free trade and the total amount of the Revenues now
derived from the separate tariffs of the Colonies, has been estimated at
about £400,000. This appears a large and serious item at the present
time, but its apparent greatness and importance vanish in view of the
natural rate at which the Revenue collected under a Federal Tariff'
may be confidently expected to increase, viz., 3-82 percent, per annum.
But if, "while giving up all revenue and functions connected with
Customs and Excise, the separate Colonies retain the possession and the
administration of the Lands, Railways, Roads, Bridges, and similar
Public Works, and only the existing Public Debt (the Interest
chargeable on which will remain stationary) is taken over by the
Federal Government, it is certain that the revenue from Customs and
Excise, growing each year at an average rate of nearly 4 per cent. (3 - 82),
will exceed the needs of reasonable Federal expenditure so much that in
20 years the excess would represent a gross sum of about £78,000,000.
It is this excess element in the past that has enabled the Colonies to
expend each year in the capital construction of railways, roads, &c.
something nearly equal to £10,000,000 above their expenditure for the
ordinary purposes of government. If, therefore, the source from which
this extraordinary expenditure has been provided is taken from them,
how are they to continue to borrow or provide fresh moneys for such
necessary capital expenditure in the future when the growing fund,
which formerly sufficed to pay interest, is now given over to the
Central Government?
Evidently there ought to be an excess of Federal Revenue if wisely
managed, which should, as formerly, suffice to meet interest on all fresh
capital expenditure from loans, if divided proportionately to population
among the Provinces to enable them to discharge the functions pertain-
ing to the administration of local lands, railways, roads, bridges, har-
bours, &c. If the surplus of the Federal revenue is not to be divided
among the Provinces for that purpose, then all such functions must be
taken over by the Federal Government, and with such a transfer of func-
tions would practically go the self-government of the several Provinces.
This fact is apt to be overlooked, and would, in all probability, tend
to lead to many false and injurious conclusions. Take, for example,
the following possible illustration. Let it be assumed that, at the
moment selected for final transfer, the total amount of revenue from
Customs and Excise for the year ending at that point of time amounted
to £7,200,000, while the interest on debt for the same year was exactly
the same figure, £7,200,000, It might at first sight be supposed that
the transfer of the revenue from Customs and Excise would be fairly
counterbalanced by the assumption of the debt involving a fixed charge
of £7,200,000 per annum in perpetuity. But this conclusion would in-
volve a dangerous fallacy ; for, as the revenue from Customs and Excise
would henceforward, as in the past, advance each year at a rate of at
least 4 per cent., while the expenditure by way of interest on debt trans-
ferred would remain a fixed charge, every year would show an advantage
of the revenue equivalent to 4 per cent, compound interest on the


original sum. Thus, although at the point of departure the two sums
would he deceptively equal, the first year would show an advantage
to the credit of Revenue of £288,000 ; 2nd year, £587,520 ; 3rd year,
£899,280; 4th year, £1,220,992; sth year, £1,560,240; 10th year,
£3,457,756; 20th year, £8,576,085, —or an aggregate difference of
£174,401,169 in the first 20 years. The appreciation of this wonderful
difference between a progressive and a fixed item of revenue and
expenditure respectively will serve to guard against possible error from
this cause, and will help to explain Table V. # In this table it is
shown that the proposed transfer of revenues connected mainly with
Customs and Excise and Post and Telegraphs, together with obligations
connected mainly with Interest on original Debt assumed, and with
Federal functional expenditure detailed, would secure an advantage
of nearly £78,000,000 to the Federal Government in the course of the
first 20 years. Hence the necessity of making provision for the
disbursement of the yearly excess in aid of Provincial revenues if the
same amount of taxation as is levied at the present time through the
medium of Customs Duties by all the Colonies continues to be levied
by the Federal Government.
It will be seen from Table VII., which shows the Federal Revenue
and Expenditure and the Federal Debt of the United States during the
last decade, that the Federal Revenue, nearly all of which is derived
from Customs and Excise, has increased at the yearly rate of 3§ per
cent., and has augmented the surplus in the Federal Treasury to the
extent of 393,000,000 dollars, which is at the rate of 10'91 per cent,
per annum, and at the same time has reduced the Federal Debt to the
extent of 709,000,000 dollars, which is at the rate of 3f per centum
per annum. These significant facts in the financial history of the
United States of America fully corroborate the statement hereinbefore
made respecting the increasing surplus which may be looked for in the
Federal Revenue of Australasia, if Customs Duties are levied by the
Federal Government to the same extent as that to which they are at
present levied by the several Colonies.
The experience of the Canadian Dominion in regard to the increase
in the portion of its Revenue derived from Customs Duties during a
similar period (Table VIII.) also confirms the statement made with
regard to what may be confidently expected to happen in Australasia
under a similar Tariff; and the facts above stated regarding the increase
in the Federal Revenue of the United States of America are the more
remarkable because the rate of Federal Taxation there is only 20
shillings per head, whereas the average rate of the corresponding Taxation
in the Australasian Colonies is as much as £2 19s. 3d. per head.
JZrrors to he avoided.
From what has been stated, it may be inferred that the “ rocks
ahead ’ belong to two different groups. The first group relate to
difficulties connected with drawing the proper line between functions
which should be transferred to the Federal Government and functions
* See also Diagram.


to be jealously guarded and retained within the jurisdiction of the
separate Provinces, The second group relate to difficulties connected
with the adjustment of financial affairs involved in whatever scheme of
union is adopted.
In the latter category a probable cause of stumbling to some
persons will be the failure to grasp the possible differences in the rate
of natural growth of the several elements of Revenue and Expendi-
ture ; and this failure may at the outset lead to much confusion and
misapprehension of the actual problem to be solved.
Disposal of the Public Debts of the various Colonies.
Prom the table given below it is apparent that, owing to the variations
of expenditure by the different Colonies on Public Works from
Loans, two of them have a greater debt (relative to population) than the
average of all, while the debts of four of the Colonies are below the
average. The exact amounts over and under the average are
shown in columns 3 and 5 respectively. As the Federal Govern-
ment will derive its main Revenue from Customs and Excise, and as
the Tariff is likely to be common to all, it is obvious that the adjustment
of the unequal Provincial burdens assumed should be based upon relation
to population. As the average indebtedness amounts to £43 3s. 3d.
per head, it would be fair to all to allow each Colony at this rate to
transfer its burden represented by its Population, i.e., Population
x £43 3s. 3d. For all sums in excess of this amount the Colonies
should issue Provincial Ponds to Federal Government, bearing interest,
say 3£ per cent, at par. For all sums short of the amount so calculated
it would be requisite that the Federal Government should issue Federal
Bonds to the Colonies affected in proportion to their respective amounts,
bearing the same rate of interest. This plan would exactly balance the
account, and equitably dispose of all inequalities.
The amount of Public Debt which each Colony
should transfer on
equal terms on the basis of the average Debt of the
say for 1889, would be as follows

Federal and Provincial Revenues.
Notwithstanding the suggested provision for distributing the surplus
of Federal Revenue among the several Provinces, objection may still
be entertained in some quarters to any proposal which allows the
Federal Government to raise by Customs Duties the same amount of
Revenue as is now raised in that manner by the Colonies collectively. If
such objections should prevail, the separate Provinces would then have
to raise more revenue by direct taxation than they do at the present
time. In the opinion of some persons this would doubtless be regarded
as a beneficial result of federation, while others would probably contem-
plate such a change in the fiscal policies of the Colonies unfavourably.
But this is a question of political economy outside of the question of
federation 'per se, and the advocates of a protective tariff as well as the
advocates of free trade may legitimately support the Federation move-
ment without any contradiction of their opinions on those questions.
The accompanying Tables have been prepared, at my request, with
much care by Mr, R. M. Johnston, Government Statistician for Tas-
mania, and will, I believe, be found of immense assistance in the investiga-
tion and elucidation of the financial and fiscal problems connected with
the question of Australasian Federation ; and I take this opportunity, on
behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Ministry of Tasmania, to
express our high appreciation of his work.
