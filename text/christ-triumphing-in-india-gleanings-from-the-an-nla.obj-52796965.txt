Reports from the Indian Mission Field
GOODLET HOSPITAL, SHOLINGHUR.
■ MEDICAL: Nurse Lang reports an attendance of 7,950 out-patients
and 469 in-patients. ‘‘These figures show an increase in both sections to
those of last year, yet leave much to be desired when one sees the hundreds
of outdoor patients who should have indoor care refusing to stay. There
are many causes for this —ignorance, superstition, fear and lack of con-
fidence, because there is no Dr. Ammal (lady doctor) who stays here
permanently. The result is obvious —the vast majority of cases are brought
to hospital in advanced stages.”

MATERNITY: “Though the figures here show a slight decrease to
last year, it is encouraging to note that of the 49, only 19 were abnormal
cases. Filth and ignorance at this time make much unnecessary suffering
and high mortality of both mothers and babes in this country. Yet, with
all the sorrows and discouragements one meets in this work, it is compen-
sated one thousandfold when one sees the new life given a fair start.”
The hospital staff consists of Dr. Samuel, a Compounder, a Male
Dresser and four Nurses.


WOMEN’S WORK—SUPERVISED BY MISS HOPE GOLDIE.
Miss Goldie reports that she is assisted in Zenana work by three
Bible-women, who have been regular and faithful in the discharge of their
duties.
“During the year, 65 Zenana, pupils received lessons twice a week
in scripture, reading, writing, and, in some cases, sewing and bazaar
accounts. A simple story of the Life of Christ and the Gospels are the
books used in the reading lessons. Always there is definite memory work
being learned. For the more advanced pupils, ‘Pilgrim’s Progress,’ the
story of ‘Sadhu Sundar Singh’ and other stories are available as supple-
mentary readers.
“The pupils’ lesson attracts all other women members of the family
who are not busy, and although it is a hindrance to the individual lesson,
it gives the Bible-woman an opportunity to speak to all.
A ZENANA WOMAN.
INDIAN SCHOOLGIRL.
“It is tliis friendly time with them that I feel must tell greatly. If the
Bible-woman proves herself true, her word will not be without result.
Their own words tell of the belief which is growing up secretly in the
hearts of many of the women. Because of the teaching some confess —the
worship of idols is vain; offerings and other ceremonies are useless; there
are no real caste distinctions; God requires a holy life.”
One of the Bible-women reports; “Some widows, believing Christ to
be their Saviour, have asked me to pray with them. When 1 have done so,
they, too, prayed with me. This confession they will make before the men
and women in their homes. Some women have bought Bibles, and are in
the habit of reading them.”
GIRLS’ SCHOOL: The staff of the Girls’ School consists of eight
teachers, with an enrolment of 160 scholars, and an average attendance
of 110.
The Headmistress says: “We take this opportunity to thank the
staff and girls of Pymble Ladies’ College for their generous gift of money
for a new school.”
In closing her report, Miss Goldie writes: “I would like to leave with
you the thought which has grown on me with increasing wonder through


out the year. It is that of the overwhelming possibilities offering to-day.
Xo village lias refused us permission to enter and preach; the doors of
the homes, particularly in Sholinghur, stand open, and the little children
refuse to be turned away from school.”

MR. C. S. BOYALL, B.A., PALLIPAT.
Mr. C. S. Boyall reports that in the Pallipat Village there are three
circles under the charge of three evangelists, who have laboured faithfully
throughout the year. He writes: “At the New Year celebrations the Rev.
A. Fleming, Convener-Superintendent, baptised 17 adults and six children.
It was an inspiring sight to see these people boldly taking their stand
for Christ. There are several more adherents who are receiving instruction,
and these will be admitted into the Church before very long. In all there
are 18 village congregations and one central church, with a church enrol-
ment of 817 adults and 205 children.
‘ ‘ Schools in the Pallipat Village: There are nine village schools and
one Higher Elementary School, containing in all 450 scholars, who daily
receive instruction in the truths of our faith, as well,as in other subjects.”
REV. C. E. TURNBULL, SHOLINGHUR.
’ln his annual report, Mr. Turnbull mentions that: “We have a total
staff of 95 mission agents,” and speaks also of the visitors to Sholinghur
from the Church here, the Right Rev. the Moderator, the Convener-
Superintendent, the Director of Youth. He tells of how that in March
Sholinghur received, a visit from Dr. Subbarayan, the Chief Minister to
+he Madras Legislative Assembly, and Mr. Muthayya, Mudaliar, the
Minister for Health. “This was a great day for Sholinghur, and large
crowds turned out to give the guests a welcome and a public address. In
this address mention was made of the Mission’s medical and educational


work in the town, and in reply Dr. Subbarayan paid a fine tribute to the
work being done by missions for the uplift of India. Both he and the
Minister for Health visited Goodlet Hospital and, after a tour of inspection,
congratulated Miss Lang and Dr. Samuel on the cleanliness of the hospital
and the efficiency of the work being done by the Institution.”
In his general review, Mr. Turnbull states: “Apart from the number
added to our Christian community by baptism during 1929, we firmly
believe that our people are growing in the grace and the knowledge and
love of God, and that they are in an increasing measure bearing witness to
the power of Christ in their lives. Some of them are beginning to realise
their duty as Christians to their less fortunate neighbours, and one man
since his baptism a few years ago has been instrumental in bringing no
less than five families into the fold of Christ.”
Mr. Rajendram, Bible Teacher in the Middle School, sums up the
benefits of his work as follows: ‘ ‘ Many of the senior boys frankly confess
that Jesus is their Saviour. Some testify to the peace of mind and other
benefits they have received in answer to prayer to Christ, and they come
to me and ask for my prayers when they are in trouble. Many have given
up idolatry and animal sacrifice. They read their New Testaments to their
parents, and with them go over the lessons they have learned during the
day.” ■ i'i^i
Mr. Turnbull, commenting on this, says: “This may perhaps err on
the optimistic side, but at the same time it shows what an interest the lads
are taking in the religious instruction of the school. If they were not really
interested why should from 95 to 100 of these Hindu boys voluntarily
attend the Sunday Schools held in the Middle and Branch School buildings
every Sunday?
“Another result of this work is seen in the many testimonies given
by our evangelists to the help rendered to them by former schoolboys
when they visit their villages.
“In all parts of our field there is a great willingness to hear the
Christian message, and accept it. Many confess to be secret believers in
Christ, and others arc seeking to live up to His teaching, yet they are
hindered from making a public confession by two considerations—the caste
people by the thought of being excommunicated from Hindu society, and
the non-caste from fear of persecution and consequent economic distress.
Truly the time is ripe for another Pentecost, when the breath of God shall
come into these caste-bound, timid, secret believers, and they shall stand
upon their feet an exceeding great army. May God give us grace and
strength to labour, pray and wait for that date.”
PASTOR BALASUNDRAM.
Pastor Balasundram reports that the attendance at the four Holy
Communion services were 64, 118, 71, 71. Nine marriages were solemnised,
and he says: “It was encouraging to see how the young people stood firm
and refused to have anything to do with heathen rites at the time of their
marriage. ' ' !* 1
“There are 12 Sunday Schools, three in Sholinghur and nine in the
villages. There are 29 teachers. One hundred and six Christian children
and 234 non-Christian children attend these schools.”
The Harvest Festival offerings amounted to Rs. 292.12.8. In addition
to this, the Church collections amounted to Rs. 187, and offerings towards
the Church Building Fund to Rs. 489.


In concluding his report, the Pastor writes: “I know that God has
helped us, and given us grace to grow in Him. Our Church and schools
are growing. A proverb says: ‘The son who is loved by his father will
thank him for his discipline.’ We got some troubles and difficulties, but
at last we are finding it is for our good.
“Please remember us in your prayers. We want to be strong in
Christ.”
FROM EVANGELISTS’ REPORTS.
“In Parangi and Thalikal we have succeeded in getting caste children
and non-caste children to mix together in the same schools, and in this
way the caste distinction and untouehability are being broken down.
“The Gospel preaching is being felt among the caste people, for a
number of them have come to me stating that they believe in Christ and
accept His teaching. They are afraid of being outcasted if they confess Him
openly and become members of the Church.
‘ ‘ Nine souls were baptised in this circle during the year, and there are
some 15 more under instruction at present.”
A. Muthuswamy.
“At different times during the year two evangelists joined with others
in the village to conduct evangelistic work in various centres. When we
were on our way to Siragumi to make our camp, heavy rain fell, and
although there was not a dry spot to pitch our tent, the caste people
made us very welcome, and helped us to fix up our camp, saying: ‘The
Christian teachers have brought us rain and broken up the drought, and
so we must help them.’ That night they gathered in large numbers and
listened very attentively to our message. When we started singing, they
went and brought their drums and helped us with the music. They accept
our message freely, but they are bound by the caste system that they are
as yet unable to break away.
“In one of the villages there is a boy who was formerly in the
Pallipat Boys ’ Home. He is now working on the land and is doing much to
win the people of his village for Christ. Already five souls have been
brought under instruction for baptism as the result of his efforts.
“At another centre we came in contact with a Hindu ascetic who,
after listening to the Gospel, acknowledged his need, and bought four
Gospel portions to read. In his anxiety to study them thoroughly he is now
sitting as a pupil in a local school to improve his reading.”
J. S. Jesunasam and Y. Nallamuthu.
“A Christian young man named Geevaratnan died early in the year.
On his deathbed he called his wife and relatives, who were non-Christians,
and boldly said: ‘I am a Christian, and I must be buried according to the
Christian rites.’ This last word of his pierced his wife’s conscience, and
now she and her daughter are being instructed for baptism.
“I have great hopes of the young men of this village. Some ten of
them who can read and write ai'e very much interested in singing the
Christian songs, and attending the spiritual meetings of the Church.
1 anticipate that the younger generation will do much for the advance-
ment of our Church. Three more families here are undergoing instruction,
and will-be baptised in :the r near future.


“Puraniah, a sincere Christian of this place, is a voluntary worker,
and preaches to all with whom he comes in contact as he goes about his own
work in the villages. The teacher who lives at Kottarvedu, near by,
conducts meetings for this congregation of 22 souls, and some of the
children go to his school for the morning session, but they cannot attend
at night.
_ ‘ ‘ Among the young people of the village we have started a Sunbeam
Society, wherein boys and girls are helped to speak the truth and not to
steal the property of other people. This is the main idea of the Society.
“I should like to say something of the Convener’s visit to the Indian
Mission. It was a great pleasure and privilege to have him in our midst.-
His visits to the various centres encouraged the village Christians and
the Mission Agents who work there. I need not say more, as we have given
a Welcome Address to the Rev. A. Fleming, wherein almost all the work
of the mission is briefly mentioned.”
J. Manickam.
‘‘About 2,000 people in different villages have heard the message of
Jesus Christ the Redeemer through me during the year. Handbills and
tracts have been distributed and Gospels sold. The Pathapalyan Christian
Endeavour Society have joined me from time to time in the evangelistic
work and we praise God for enabling us to win for Him fifteen souls,
who were baptised by the Convener-Superintendent on New Year’s Day at
Pallipat. Another twenty people are now under instruction for baptism.
In order to make our work more interesting and attractive, the Rev. C. E.
Turnbull supplies us with some musical instruments and I thank the
Mission for this encouragement in carrying on my work. As the hardships
imposed on the depressed classes by the caste people are gradually dying
down, I am convinced that in the near future many people will accept
Christ as their Saviour.”
R. Gnanapragasam.
“The congregations in this circle have improved in Christian know-
ledge, faith and life. Some of them take part in the prayer meetings by
offering prayer and telling Bible stories. Others have done personal work
among their friends and relatives. Though the year has been a hard,one
and the people have had to work hard to gain a livelihood, very few failed
to attend the services and other meetings. Singing practices have done
much to cheer the people and encourage them in their Christian life.
“Ten people at Yelligaram, three at Eacharabadi and two at Nediam
are being prepared for admission as full members of the Church.
‘ ‘ Baptisms: During the year, four men, two women and three children
were baptised in this circle.
“Adherents: Eight families of twenty souls at Kolattur, two families
at Keeshalam and four families at Karambedu are being prepared for
baptism. At Kollatur a Christian young man has started a private school
of his own, and is doing much to help the catechumens. ’ ’
D. Jesudoss.
THE BOYS’ ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
“An Indian says: ‘How can this part of the country repay the Aus-
tralians who, in the name of Jesus, have opened their generous hands and
are helping us, young and old, the sick and the poor, the orphans and the
destitute V


“This branch school contains 150 pupils, who are up to ten years of
age, and seven teachers are on the staff. I need not write much about the
work done in the school, as it is known to many, and it was recently
visited by the Convener-Superintendent and the Moderator. However, it
might interest you to hear some of the remarks passed by the Government
Inspecting Officers and others during the year; ‘The school continues to
be held in the same rented building noted at the previous inspection. A
good and well-ventilated building with suitable open space for play-ground
is wanting to make this a model primary school,’ by the Junior Deputy
Inspector.
‘ ‘ Bible lessons are given every day, and we use illustrations and models
in imparting this instruction.
MIDDLE SCHOOL SHOLINGHUR.
‘■‘Every Sunday morning at 7.30 a.m. we gather and conduct a Sunday
School for Hindu children, and there is an attendance of about 45 boys.
“In conclusion, I wish to say that the visit of the Right Reverend
the Moderator and Mrs. G. R. S. Reid was a red letter day in the history
of the school.”
Samuel John, Headmaster.
SHOLINGHUR GIRLS’ HOME, 1929.
“Beginning with fourteen inmates at the end of 1928, ten girls were
admitted in January and another thirteen in June, thus bringing the total
up to thirty-seven girls. Many applications were turned down as we
thought an increase of twenty-three was sufficient for the year and, more-
over, the present accommodation is rather taxed. The news of Mrs. Kirk-
land’s generous and timely gift for the erection of a permanent building
for this institution has encouraged us greatly, and we take this opportunity
to convey to her the gratitude of the whole mission. We hope in our next
annual report to be able to say that the buildings have been erected and
filled with happy inmates.
“We welcome the growing appreciation by the Educational Authorities
of the work being done in the home, and its practical issue. In 1928-29
the Government Grant towards the maintenance of the home was only
Rs. 161, hut we have received notice that Rs. 785 will be paid for 1929-30.
“We extend our greetings and thanks to the many individuals and
societies at home who have so generously undertaken the financial support
of our girls, and assure them that without this help the home would be
an impossibility.”

SHOLINGHUR BOYS’, MIDDLE SCHOOL.
“In presenting the report for the year under review, my heart is full
of gratitude for all His mercies.
“The school, I am glad to say, is maintaining its state of efficiency
and usefulness, and continues to be the most effective means of influencing
and shaping the lives of the future citizens of Sholinghur.
“In'Spite of the antagonistic elements at work, such as gross super-
stition, ignorance and tinle-honoured but harmful customs, the Bible holds
its 6wn among our student population, mainly composed of Hindus, and
is slowly but steadily making way for the consummation of our heart’s
desire of making Jesus the personal Saviour of every Indian.
“The growing importance of the place and the gradual awakening
of the masses to the value of education have made the raising of the school
an absolute necessity. Our missionary, reading the signs of the times, has
promised to open the Fourth Form at the beginning of the new academic
year.
“The English-knowing agents residing in Sh,olinghur are deeply
indebted to the Rev. Mr. Turnbull for the Bible study class he is conducting
every Sunday afternoon. The lessons are most helpful and of absorbing
interest, and thus we spend a very delightful hour every Sunday.
“May God guide us through the year and use us more in His service.”

from the Church here, the Right Rev. the Moderator, the Convener-

FROM EVANGELISTS’ REPORTS.
‘‘ In Parangi and Thalikal we have succeeded in getting caste children
and non-caste children to mix together in the same schools, and in this
way the caste distinction and untouehability are being broken down.
“The Gospel preaching is being felt among the caste people, for a

accept His teaching. They are afraid of being outcasted if they confess Him
openly and become members of the Church.


“Nina souk were baptised in this circle during the year, and there art
Some 16 more under instruction at present.”
A. Muthuswamy.
“At different times during the year two evangelists joined with others
in the village to conduct evangelistic work in various centres. When we
were on our way to Siragumi to make our camp, heavy rain fell, and
although there was not a dry spot to pitch our tent, the caste people
made us very welcome, and helped us to fix up our camp, saying: ‘The
Christian teachers have brought us rain and broken, up the drought, and
so we must help them.’ That night they gathered in large numbers and
listened very attentively to our message. When we .started singing, they
went and brought their drums and helped us with the music. They accept
our message freely, but they are bound by the caste system that they are
as yet unable to break away.
‘‘ In one of the villages there is a boy who was formerly in th«
Pallipat Boys’ Home. He is now working on the land and is doing much t*
win the people of his village for Christ. Already five souls have been
brought under instruction for baptism as the result of his efforts.
“At another centre we came in contact with a Hindu ascetic who,
after listening to the Gospel,- acknowledged his need, and bought four
Gospel portions to read. In his anxiety to study them thoroughly he .is now
sitting as a pupil in a local school to improve his reading.”
J. S. Jesunasam and Y. Nallamuthu.
“A Christian young man named Geevaratnan died early in the year.
On his deathbed he called his wife and relatives, who were non-Christians,
and boldly said: ‘ I am a Christian, and I must be buried according to the
Christian rites.’ This last word of his pierced his wife’s conscience, and
now she and her daughter are being instructed for baptism.
“I have great hopes of the young men of this village. Some ten of
them who can read and write are very much interested in singing the
Christian songs, and attending the spiritual meetings of. the .Church.
I anticipate that the younger generation will do much for the advance-
ment of our Church. Three more families here are undergoing instruction,
and will be baptised in the near future.
' ‘ ‘ Puraniah, a sincere Christian of this place, is a voluntary worker,
and preaches to all with whom he comes in contact as he goes about his own
work in the villages. The teacher who lives at Kottarvedu, near by,
conducts meetings for this congregation of 22 souls, and some of the
children go to his school for the morning session, but they cannot attend
at night.
“Among the young people of the village we have started a Sunbeam
Society, wherein boys and girls are helped to speak the truth and not to
steal the property of other people. This is the main idea of the Society.
“I should like to say something of the Convener’s visit to the Indian
Mission. It. was a great pleasure and privilege to have him in our midst.
His visits to the various centres encouraged the village Christians


the Mission Agents who work there. I need not say more, as we have given
a Address to the Rev. A. Fleming, wherein almost all the-work
of the mission is briefly mentioned.”
J. Manickam.
• “About 2,000 people in different villages have heard the message of
Jesus Christ the Redeemer through me during the year. Handbills and
tracts have been distributed and Gospels sold. The Pathapalyan Christian
Endeavour' Society have joined me from time to time in the evangelistic
work'and we praise God for enabling us to win for Him fifteen souls,
who were baptised by the Convener-Superintendent on New Year’s Day at
Pallipat. Another twenty people are now under instruction for baptism.
In order to make our work more interesting and attractive, the Rev. C. B.
Turnbull supplies us with some musical instruments and I thank the
Mission Tor this encouragement in carrying on my work. As the hardships
imposed on the depressed classes by the caste people are gradually dying
down, T am convinced that in the near future many people will accept
Christ as their baviour.
B. Gnanapragasam.
( “^The‘congregations in this circle.have improved in Christian know-
ledge', faith and life. Some of them take part in the prayer meetings by
offering prayer and telling Bible stories. Others have done personal work
among their friends and relatives. Though the year has been a hard one
anci thy .people have had to work hard to gain a livelihood, very'few failed
to.*.attend, the,services and other meetings. Singing practices have done
much to cheer the people and encourage them in their Christian life. ' '
“Ten people at Velligaram, three at Eaehambadi and two at Nediam
are being prepared for admission as full members of the Church.
‘ ‘ Baptisms: During the year, four men, two women and three children
were baptised in this circle.
“Adherents: Eight-families of twenty souls at Kolattur, two families,
at' Keeshalam and four families at Karambedu are being prepared for
baptism. At Kollatur a Christian young man has started a private school
of his own. and is doing much to help the catechumens. ”

THE BOYS’ ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
“An‘lndian says:-‘How can this part of the' country repay the Aus-
tralians who, in the name of Jesus, have opened their generous hands and
are helping us, young and old, the sick and the poor, the orphans and .the
d^itute?’.
e * This branch school contains 150 pupils, who are up to ten years of
age, and seven teachers are on the staff. I need not write much about the.
work'done in the school, as it is known to many, and it was recently)
visited by the Convener-Superintendent and the Moderator. However, it
luighCintcrest you to hear some of the remarks passed by the Government
Inspecting Officers and others during the year: ‘The school continues to
be'held .in the same rented building noted at the previous inspection. A •
good and well-ventilated building with suitable open space for play-ground
is wanting to make this a model primary. school, ”by the Junior Deputy
liisneetor.


"Bible lessons are given every day, and we use illustrations and models
in imparting this instruction.
' "Every Sunday morning at 7.30 a.m. we gather and conduct a Sunday
School for Hindu children, and there is an attendance of about 45 boys.
"In conclusion, I wish to say that the visit of the Right Reverend
the Moderator and Mrs. G. R. S. Reid was a red letter day in the history
of the school.”

SHOLINGHUR GIRLS’ HOME, 1929.
"Beginning with fourteen inmates at the end of 1928, ten girls were
admitted in January and another thirteen in June, thus bringing the total
up to thirty-seven girls. Many applications were turned down as we
thought an increase of twenty-three was sufficient for the year and, more-
over, the present accommodation is rather taxed. The news of Mrs. Kirk-
land’s generous and timely gift for the erection of a permanent building
for this institution;has encouraged us greatly, and we take this opportunity
to convey to her the gratitude of The whole mission. We hope in our next
annual report to be able to say that 'the buildings have been erected and
filled with happy inmates. ;
"We welcome the growing appreciation by the Educational Authorities
of the work, being done in the home, and its practical issue. In 1928-29
the Government Grant towards 'the maintenance of the home was only
Rs. 161, but we have received notice that Rs, 785 will be paid for 1929-30.
"We extend our greetings and thanks Jo the many individuals and
societies at home who have so generously undertaken the financial support
of our girls, and assure them that without this help the home would be
an impossibility.”
SHOLINGHUR BOYS’, MIDDLE SCHOOL.
"In presenting the report for the year under review, my heart is full
of gratitude for all His mercies.
"The school, I am glad to say, is maintaining its state of efficiency
and usefulness, and continues to be the most effective means of influencing
and shaping the lives of the future citizens of Sholinghur.
"In spite of the antagonistic elements at work, such as gross super-
stition, ignorance and time-honoured but harmful customs, the Bible holds
its own among our student population, mainly composed of Hindus, and
is slowly but steadily making way for the consummation of our heart’s
desire of making Jesus the personal Saviour of every Indian.
"The growing importance of the place and the gradual awakening
of the masses to the value of education have made the raising of the school
an absolute necessity. Our missionary, reading the signs of the times, has
promised ;tb open the Fourth Form at the beginning of the new academic
year. "
"The English-knowing agents residing in Sholinghur are deeply
indebted to the Rev. Mr. Turnbull for the Bible study class he is conducting
every Sunday afternoon. The lessons are most helpful and of absorbing
interest, and thus we spend a very delightful hour every Sunday.
' ‘ May God guide us through the year and use us more in His service. ’ ’
F. W. Aaron, B.A., L.T., Headmaster.
