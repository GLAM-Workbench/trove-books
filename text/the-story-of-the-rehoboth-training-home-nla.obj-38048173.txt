THE STORY
OF THE
?REHOEOTH? TRAINING HOME.
u 1 will even make a way in the wilderness and livers

In the latter part of 1897, Rev. W. Y. and Mrs. Black-
well, then living in the Wesleyan Parsonage, Williamr,-
town, were led to pray much for the manv young people,
especially in the church to which they'belonged, who
had expressed themselves as willing to go out as mis-
sionaries to foreign fields, if the way opened up. They
were aware that some had gone out into various mis-
sionary areas through the help of the Training Homes
then in existence, and were thankful for the help that
had been rendered. Still they, and a few praying
people associated with them felt that more could be,
and ought to be done ; and they kept specially pray-
ing week after week for some one to be raised up who
would offer to train and send out missionaries in the
various branches of the Methodist Church. After
some period of continued prayer, this thought one
n ght came across the mind of these two servants of
God simultaneously ; li You aie piaying for some one
to be impressed with the necessity of this work,?Are
you prepared to undertake it yourselves ?? This query
was one that nuist be answered, and although the
answer was nut pleasing to flesh and blood, nor such
as lilted in with present plans, only one answer could
te given, and that was,
IF GOD WANTED IT DONE,
they were prepared to undertake it in faith. After
some further prayer a letter was written to the Spectator
explaining the need and putting before the readers of
that journal the proposal. A donation of �$ for the
work was the first nucleus of funds to come in answer
to prayer. 1 hen came �\ very cheering letter from a
much respected and venyrabie minister with a dona-
tion of �l. A few other' donations came in for the
work during the months preceding March, 1898. Mr.
Blackwell had asked permission of his Conference in
that month to be set apart without salary or guarantee
for evangelistic and mission work, intending to trust
only in God for supplies. The Conference did not see
fit to grant his request, but stationed him for another
year at Williamstown.

Thus it was step by step that the Home was set up,,
and when* the opening took place omthe date fixed, all.
that was absolutely necessary and some luxuries were
there.. And these had been provided, mot by the;
donations of the wealthy,, but by the-cheerful and self-
denying small contributions of the comparatively poor.
OPENING DAY. ??MAY 4TH*, 1898.
The opening was a memorable time. Asa company
Of about 50 persons met im the large Mission Room,,
once a public house bar, but now consecrated, to train*
Missionaries, and prayers were offered by Revs. E.
King,, Sv Knight, Gc He Cole and others,, 1 the glory of
God was truly manifested; the Borci filied the house,,

Iriends gathered in the same spot for two-hours? prayer
on* Friday nights, the same signal manifestation of the
Bivine presence was realised during the period of two*
years in which the work was carried on in Williamstowa..
This was a period of experience and trial much
deeded by all, Mir. and Mrs: Blackwell both felt that
they had much to learn as to suitable methods and re-
flations for carrying on - the work: - They were both

They found this and so did the students, that sot
long as all was going well, supplies came in with fair
regularity, but when anything was wrong in the stud-
ents? conduct or when the Principals ha id. through; un-
due leniency left faults uncorrected, supplies ceased andl
all had to get on their knees and search their hearts,
to find out what was at fault.
'thus the 'training Home was a real training for
all in the true principles of faith. For God is omnis-
scent and holy; and if v/e are to receive supplies fromi
Him in carrying on the work, we must be right withi
Him. It is as the Psalmist says, ?If I regard iniquity
in my heart, the Lord will not hear him? ; but if the
heart is right and the guidance clear, we may go to<
all lengths in obeying God.
ANSWERS TO PRAYER.
These were months of much blessing, as well as of
trial. Seeing prayer so often and so signally answered:
could not but bring a deeper revelation of God, and a,
greater happiness in His service. For instance, prayer
was offered for a baby-organ to lead our open-air sing-
ing. This was first answered by a. neighbour offering
to lend his? which he kindly did for over three months..
But that we might not impose upon kindness, more ur-
gent prayer was offered for an organ of our own. A
triend heard of one, bought and paid for it, and donated
�i toward the cost, saying that we could pay the bal-
ance when we received it. In, a month or two the bal-
ance was paid, and the difficulty was tided over.
A NEW DEPARTURE.
Some young women offered for training. It was.
made a matter of special prayer as to whether these too
should be received, and at last it was resolved, to take*
another house in faith for the sisters. Thus a new de-
parture was made which, has had Goo,?s. approving,
blessing. Many incidents could be furnished to show
how God interposes in little things a.s well as greater*
in answer to prayer. At our Saturday night open-air-
meeting a poor woman, who was leading a life of sin r
appealed to us for help. She had been driven out of
home by the man with whom she was living whilst he,
was on a drinking bout, and with her three children,
Lad spent two nights on the beach. She was wretched
in soul and body, and we could not do otherwise than
try to help her and her httle ones. Accordingly we
took them in and improvised a bed that night ai the

parsonage, after giving them all a good supper. The
next day we took them round to the sisters? home,
sending with them as much provisions as we could
spare, not being able to obtain any more at the shops
as it was Sunday. The brothers heard of the difficulty ;
and, without our knowing it, sent generously to the
sisters? home all the food they had in the house ; they
then went out to conduct their Sunday afternoon
meeting in the slums, trusting to God to provide them
their tea, but telling no one else about their need.
When they came home tired and hungry, they found
out that a kind baker, who had often sent provisions
before, but never on a Sunday, had been to their house
and had left in the shed a large basketful of scones,
cakes, &c M so that they had a far better tea than the
one they had given away. Need it be pointed out
that such incidents as this greatly strengthen the faith j
for we feel that if God takes notice of such a detail as
providing his children with a meal, there is nothing
which He will overlook.
ANOTHER STAGE.
After nearly two years? work in Williamstown, during
which much good was done in a quiet way by the
students in visiting the poor outcasts in their homes,
bringing them up to church, sitting by them there,
often bringing them forward to the Communion Rail
for salvation, gathering a number of the ragged and
uncared-for children into a Mission School, holding
two or three open-air meetings every week ; God indic-
ated that the place of residence should be changed.
It was a time of considerable testing to the Principals,
as they did not know where their conference might
appoint them. But the outcome of it was that they
felt constrained to take a stand beside the work which
had been so markedly owned of God, and at much
loss and risk, as far as personal interest was concerned,
to cast themselves and the work entirely upon God for
support and to ask Him to point out where He would
have them settle in Melbourne or suburbs. After a
time of waiting and house-hunting, they were directed
tc the residence where the Home is now located?
i6B Clarendon-street, East Melbourne ?as a temporary
abode at least, until God should be pleased to give a
building free of rent for the glory of His name.
