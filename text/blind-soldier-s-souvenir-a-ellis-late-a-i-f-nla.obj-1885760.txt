Blind Soldier’s
Souvenir


" Before the Light had Faded.”
In health and strength my youth was spent,
In spirits high and keen,
In active life, in work and play:
Some wondrous sights I’ve seen.
A roving life among the sheep
Was full of joy for me;
But now the breaking of the dawn
I never more shall see.
To face grim war I went away,
Without a thought of fear;
I left my wife and all I held
In life so very dear.
When shot and shell flew fast around,
My fighting blood was fired,
And side by side with my brave mates
I fought as one inspired.
But failing nerves stood not the strain —
The shells had told their tale;
And, alas! I found to my dismay
My sight was going to fail.
And cruel Fate has been unkind —
My child I’ve never seen;
But in my darkest hours of woe
A comfort sweet she’s been.
Oh, I would bear the burden great
With fortitude complete,
Could I but see my little one,
And watch her dainty feet.
My dear wife, too, has been my guide;
She’s helped me bear my pain;
I pray to God for one brief hour
To see her once again.
Oh ? glorious sight! most precious gift
That’s given on earth to men,
What joy complete ’twould be to me
To have thee once again!
To see the rising sun and moon,
The stars in heaven so bright,
The seas immense, the mountains grand,
The varying rays of light.
To all my friends and all my mates,
Who to me are most kind,
My kindest thoughts will ever go
Towards them in my mind.
In my mind’s eye as time rolls on,
I’ll picture them always
As brightest stars sent down to me
To light my darkest days.
May God protect my wife and child,
My mates and all my friends,
And keep them safe from harm and fear
Until life’s journey ends.
And when my life has run its course,
And war and strife are past,
I trust that God will give me sight
To see them all at last.
