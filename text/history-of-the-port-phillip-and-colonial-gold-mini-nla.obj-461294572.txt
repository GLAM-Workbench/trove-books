IN CONNECTION WITH THE
CLUNES MIN E.
X TEARING of the quartz lodes at Clunes, towards the end of 1856, I
M paid a visit to that place, and, from the favorable appearance of the
<• lodes on the surface, lat once made arrangements with Mr. Mac-
donald, one of the proprietors, to take up the ground on lease. This was
completed early in the following year, the terms being 10 per cent, royalty
on all gold obtained from the mine, but which was afterwards reduced to
per cent., one of the conditions being that the Company was not required to
break quartz that was estimated to yield less than 1 oz. o'; gold to the ton,
as it was considered that it would require that amount to pay all expenses,
including royalty, and leave a fair profit.
Another condition of the lease was, that the proprietors of the property
were bound for the period of 21 years, but the Company had the power to
terminate the agreement at any time on giving three months notice. This
last condition was inserted in consequence of the general opinion of geologists
and persons experienced in gold raining in other countries that quartz would
only continue to be gold-bearing at comparatively shallow depths. There
being a doubt at this time in respect to the right to mine on private property,
and a difficulty in obtaining a number of persons to carry on the work, 1
arranged with a party of miners and others, who formed themselves into a
company, called “ The Clunes Quartz Mining C 0.,” and agreed with them to
raise the quartz and deliver it to the stamps, the Port Phillip Co. to crush
the quartz and extract the gold. This arrangement was continued for some
years, when it was agreed that the whole work connected with the mine
should be carried on under the management of the Port Phillip Co., the
Clunes Co. receiving their share of the profits. The following is the return

The main shaft has been sunk 200 feet deeper, making the present
depth 1415 feet, and this should be continued in search of new makes of
stone before the mine is abandoned.

24-in. cylinder; 1 winding engine, 24-in. cylinder; 1 capstan engine, 10-in.
cylinder, 1 engine, 7-in. cylinder, driving a Root’s blower, for ventilating
the mine, all supplied with steam from four multitubular boilers.
The South Shaft has one winding engine, 18-in. cylinder, supplied
from one multitubular boiler; there is also one spare boiler.
The Reduction Works Plant consists of one engine, 25-in. cylinder,
driving 80 heads of stamps; two stone-breakers; seven buddies; one engine,
10-in. cylinder, driving two double-acting 10-in. surface pumps; one engine,
12-in. cylinder, driving two Chilian mills ; and other appliances for treating
pyrites—all supplied with steam from five multitubular boilers.
The consumption of fuel when the stamps are in full work is one cord,
or 2| tons, of firewood for 40 tons of quartz crushed. There is also an incline
furnace for roasting pyrites. The following is the quantity of timber and
firewood consumed from 1857 to 1888 :

Two significant features are associated with Clunes. It was the first
place in the Colony of Victoria where gold was struck : secondly, the Port
Phillip and Colonial Gold Mining Company held the premier position for
Quartz Mining and Crushing for many years.


On the 29th of June, 1851, gold was struck at Clunes by a Mr, Esmond.
For a short time afterwards the field was occupied by several hundred diggers,
until the Golden Point, Ballarat, and subsequently Forest Creek and Bendigo,
caused it to be deserted. The population fluctuated until the end of 1855,
when a party from Ballarat, Messrs. Robinson, Stephenson, and Jones
(Robinson’s vein afterwards took its name from the former gentleman), erected
a Chilian mill. Shortly after, a Berdan and second Chilian mill were put to
work ; and lastly, a battery was started at Birch’s Creek, driven by water
power. It is estimated that from twelve to fifteen thousand pounds were
spent in the erection of crude machinery to extract the precious metal and
develop the quartz lodes.
At the close of 1856, arrangements were made with Mr. Macdonald and
his partners by Mr. Bland, Managing Director of the Port Phillip Company,
to mine on their private property. A lease was signed early in 1817, and
work commenced in March of that year.
The Mine is situated in the central part of the township of Clunes, on
the lower portion of the Oreswick Creek, one of the western tributaries of the
river Loddon, and about 19 miles from its source, on the northern slope of
Main Dividing Range, and a distance 20 miles north of Ballarat.
Clunes Reefs were the first ever worked for gold in the Colony of Vic-
toria, and though rich, mining was conducted in a superficial manner, and
without system. This arose partly from the want of capital, crude machinery
employed, and constant disputes arising between diggers and owners of the
private property. This state of things continued for a few years after the
Port Phillip Company had obtained the right to mine. The reckless and
unsettled state of the mining population at this period inspired the Govern-
ment to dispute the Royal Charter which the Company held from the Crown
of England for the right to mine in the Colony.
The difficulties that surrounded the early history of the Company were
perennial. No sooner had the title to mine for gold been established and
machinery erected, when the serious question cropped up, that the gold-bearing
reefs would give out at comparatively shallow depths.
For a few years this question was the absorbing topic of the day with
mining experts and scientific men, including the first Manager sent out by the
Company and Sir R. Murchison. After making the subject a study, the
former gentlemen gave his opinion—“ Gold mining would be a matter of
history in three years.”
The following is a copy of correspondence with the Chief Secretary :
Melbourne, 15th January, 1858.
The Hon. The Chief Secretary.
Sir, —Sometime since a report was issued from the Mining Board, signed
by the Chairman, in which the subject of Quartz Mining and Quartz Crushing
was very fully entered into, and very unfavorably reported upon,- and
capitalists were warned against embarking in this description of mining
with any idea that the quartz reefs of this country would be likely to continue at
any great depth. As the above opinion, emanating from a scientific board,
tends to discourage quartz mining, and as it is generally believed that this is
not the opinion of the Government Geologist, I beg to know, as one largely


interested in this pursuit, if you have any objection to request Mr. Selwyn
to report the result of his enquiries on the subject for the information of the
public.
I have, &c.,
(Signed) R. H. BLAND.

Melbourne, 9th February, 1858.
R. H. Bland, Esq., P.P. and Colonial G.M. Co.
Sir, —Referring to your letter of the 15th ultimo, requesting that the
result of the experience of the Geological Surveyors on the subject of the yield
of gold from quartz at various depths might be furnished for the information
of yourself and others engaged in quartz mining and crushing, I have the
honor to forward, in compliance with your request, the annexed copy of Mr.
Selwyn’s opinion on the subject.
I have, <fec,,

U nder-Secretary.
[copy enclosed.]
With reference to the very frequently expressed theory that gold quartz
veins can never be profitably worked to any great depths because, unlike tin
or copper veins, they always become poorer the deeper they are followed, my
opinion is, that though there be no probability of their increasing very greatly
in richness in depth, as might be anticipated regarding a tin or copper vein,
neither is there any reason whatever to suppose that they will, as a rule, either
die out or suddenly become unprofitable. There is, accordingly, good evidence
that the upper portions of the gold quartz veins which have been naturally
removed by denudation, and now form the gold drifts, were far richer than
any we now find in place at the surface; but we must remember that to
produce this result many thousand vertical feet of quartz veins have been
thus naturally broken up, crushed, and washed, and the fact of the veins still
being frequently rich at the present surface, which was at one time many
thousand feet deep, goes far to prove that the diminution of yield in depth,
though true on a large scale, is in reality so slow as not to be appreciable
within any depth to which ordinary mining operations are carried, and,
therefore, cannot be regarded as of any practical importance to the miner.
As a further illustration of this, I would point out that if we examine the
present surface out-crop of any rich quartz vein traversing a hilly district,
say from A to B, we frequently find that it is as rich in the valley at Aas
on the hill at B, and though A and B are now on the surface, they are in
reality, as regards original depth, some hundreds of feet asunder, or the
distance from B to C. For these reasons Ido not think that the supposed


diminution of yield in depth, in gold quartz veins, is of any practical
importance, nor should it be allowed to interfere with the judicious invest-
ment of large capital in quartz mining.
(Signed) ALFRED SELWYN,
February 3rd, 1858. Government Geologist.
Notwithstanding this and other reports of a similar character, accom-
panied by colored maps and sections, issued by the same gentleman, the
public mind continued excited both in and out of Parliament. A Royal
Commission was appointed, and collected evidence on the subject from the
several goldfields throughout the colony. They submitted their report in
1862. It contained the opinions of the leading mine managers of dunes
and other parts of the colony, viz., that quartz reefs would not be worked
profitably below three or four hundred feet from the surface. The Company’s
operations at this time were carried on with unabated energy, profit for years
1861 and 1862 being £35,890 3s. 2d. and £37,896 18s. 4d. respectively—an
unprecedented result in its history.
The tide of current opinion had somewhat changed on the subject at this
time, both in the colony and in England, and the ability of that able gentle-
man, Mr. Selwyn, recognised by Sir R. Murchison, who, up to this date, held
opposite views. See iSiluria (Murchison) page 496—“1n bowing to the
reason of a sound geologist, Mr. Selwyn, who has so carefully, explored our
most auriferous colony, and in necessarily modifying my former suggestion
respecting the profitless nature of gold mining in the solid rocks of Victoria ,
I still adhere to the belief that, in general, gold veins diminish in value as
they descend, and I cannot but think Victoria affords indications of this
phenomenon, inasmuch as all the huge nuggets of gold have there been found
in drift, derived from the upper portions of the rocks.”
CRUSHING MACHINERY.
The Company’s operations commenced at a time when quartz mining,
crushing, and the treatment of auriferous ores, were in the hands of inex-
perienced men ; concurrent opinion at same time considered the industry
as one of short duration.
To-day it assumes another form, and invites the miner, scientist, and
engineer alike ; from evidence frequently cropping up on the various goldfields
throughout the colony, little doubt is left that auriferous quartz will be
found at a depths hitherto thought impossible.
The first site selected for reduction works was on the west side of the
hill on which the Mine is situated, within the south boundary line of the
private property, a distance of 40 yards from the creek. The first battery,
consisting of 20 heads of square stampers, was erected and started work in the
month of May, 1857, driven by a 12-in. cylinder engine sent out from England.
As the Mine opened out and supply of quartz increased, we added a
battery at a time, until 44 heads were in full work, driven by three engines.
To lessen the cost of engineers and other labor, an order was sent to England
for the first 24-in. cylinder engine and three multitubular boilers ; on their
arrival and erection, a further addition of twelve heads were put up, making
56 in all, which, with two Chilian mills and other machinery for the
concentration and treatment of pyrites, commenced work in the month of
January, 1860. With a large and increasing plant, the fuel alone formed a
serious item of expenditure ; roads being impassable for the delivery of this


material in the winter time, it was absolutely necessary to procure and stack
the year’s consumption during the summer months, therefore at this part of
the season, eighteen to twenty bullock and horse teams could be seen in the
yard daily, delivering and stacking wood.
The partial reconstruction of machinery, with steam at 65 lbs. pressure
per square inch, and engine working expansively, considerably reduced the
number of hands employed, and in fuel alone the consumption was lessened
on an average from eight tons of ore crushed per cord consumed to 22 tons
for a similar quantity.
In conjunction with alterations and improvements already referred to,
experiments were being made to ascertain the loss of gold in tailings. In
the year 1861 careful and daily assays of this material were made, showing
the loss to be 6 dwts. 1 grain per ton. Costly and continuous experiments
were at once instituted by a, practical assayer. The following year the loss
was reduced to 4 dwts. 9 grains per ton. Subsequently each year showed a
diminished loss, until in 1871 the minimum was reached, being 17 grains.
On completion of the 56-head battery, it was thought to be equal to all
requirements for a long time to come. The output at the Mine, however,
continued to increase; subsequently it was decided to procure a second
24-inch cylinder engine from England, and 24 heads of new and heavier
stamps, to be in readiness whenever circumstances of the Mine warranted
their erection.
The following is a photo, of the hrst plant of 56 heads and other
machinery attached.
On the arrival of new engine, mine operations had reached water-level,
lodes changed their character, becoming mineralised and requiring additional
treatment. Erection of buddies and treatment of pyrites became subjects
for consideration. The new stampers were of necessity fixed at a higher
level, and work commenced February, 1864. The two plants were kept
fully'employed for a few years ; in the meantime buddies, Chilian mills, and
furnace were erected for collection and treatment of pyrites.
About this time raw versus calcined ore came under the review of public
opinion, when, after repeated trials, this Company erected the first stone-
breaker, in the year 1865 ; further trials were continued, when the stone-
breaker' gradually superseded the calcination process, and the general
treatment of ore was modified.
The final alteration in the reduction works consisted in the removal of
the 56-head of stamps to the upper site, and working the whole 80 heads by
the No. 2 engine. This concentration of the plant resulted in a corres-
ponding reduction of working expense. Formerly one cord of wood was
consumed in crushing 8 tons of quartz, this was gradually increased to 40
tons crushed for one cord of wood, and the total cost of working the mine
for the seven succeeding years was as under : —lB7O, 17s. Bd. per ton ; 1871,
16s 7d. per ton; 1872, 15s. 4d. per ton ; 1873, 15s. 9d. per ton; 1874,
15s. 6d. per ton; 1875, 18s. o|d. per ton; 1876, 19s. 4d. per ton ; being an
average of 16s. lOd. per ton.

PYRITES.
The collection and treatment of this material commenced in the year
1862, with a produce therefrom of 1 oz. of gold to the ton, being 26 per cent,
of the assay contents. In May, 1864, we erected the first huddle, and
during the same year treated 76 tons, yielding 201 ozs. of gold ; average, 2
ozs. 2 dwts. 19 grs. per ton.
Samples of pyrites were sent to the School of Mines, London, in the
year 1862 for treatment by Dr. Percy ; after several trials with raw and
roasted material, that gentleman reported :—“ I have recently experimented
on the Australian quartz tailings and pyrites with a view to the application
of liquid reagents for the separation of the gold, and the conclusion at which
I have arrived, and which is strengthened by the reports from Mr. Bland, is,
that however applicable processes founded on this principle might be in
England, they would be difficult of application at present in Australia, and
would probably be unrernunerative. I would observe that the results of the
experiments on the application of liquid reagents to the extraction of gold
from its ores which I communicated some time ago, are the identical results
of Mr. Daintree to which Mr. Bland refers. As far as lam able to form a
judgment on a small scale, I should say the best thing to be done is simply
to roast the material, and afterwards subject it to careful amalgamation; this
may be conducted at little expense; consumption of fuel will be small, as the
stuff itself contains much combustible matter.”
The process from this date gradually improved both in the quantity
collected and amount of gold extracted, until it reached 90 per cent, of the
assay contents, and this has for many years been maintained.
The total quantity of pyrites saved and treated from 1862 to 1888 was
7182| tons; gold obtained, 29,300 ozs. 18 dwts., which left a balance of
profits over and above the cost of saving and treating of £92,421 10s, Id.

two runs of auriferous gravel were proved, one on the eastern fall, the other
on the west. The latter passes out
of the Company’s ground in a narrow
by the South Clunes Company, the
channel, and traverses the ground held
other widens out in its northerly trend to join the great lead system known
as the Kingston Leads. In the immediate neighbourhood of the reefs on the
east side, the alluvial was rich. A separate Company was formed to work it
in the year , and continued for a few years. It has since been reworked
by tributors and others. From this source 32,682 oz. were obtained ; sub-
sequently the tailings were conveyed to the Company’s battery and crushed,
yielding 1318 oz., making a total of 34,000 oz. 19 dwts., as shown by the
following tabulated statement ;

CHLORINE PROCESS.
In order to improve the treatment of pyrites, a series of trials on a
practical scale were instituted at these works during the latter part of 1867 and
the early part of the year 1868, to determine the applicability of the chlorine
process of extraction of gold from mineral of the same quality operated on
by the Chilian mills. Result of the former, 94’83 per cent.; the latter, 90 per
cent, of the gold. Owing to the stuff containing a quantity of metallic iron
(abrasions from stamp-heads) increasing the cost of the chemical process,


it outweighed the advantages obtained by the abstraction of 4 or 5 per cent,
more gold than the mills produced. Trials were in consequence discontinued.
Of late years this system has been tried in other parts of the colony, and said
to be further improved by the recent introduction of the Newberry-Vautin
process, but lam not aware (on the whole) with any better results. Com-
parative trials have been made with our mills and this process elsewhere, mills
giving slightly better returns. Probably means may shortly be discovered to
separate the metallic iron, and reduce the stuff to finer division, these being
apparently, in my opinion, the chief difficulties, and may explain the success
at Mount Morgan, Queensland.
GOLD OBTAINED AT CLONES.
The mining area held by several Companies here is about square
miles, and the gold obtained therefrom to date as under, being about one-
fiftieth of the entire gold yield of the colony.

The reefs that pass through the Company’s Claim are the Western,
Robinson’s, Old Man, Eastern, and Welcome. A few years after mine
operations commenced, and the lodes traced down to No. 3 level, the Welcome
effected a junction with the east vein ; subsequently when sinking the North
Shaft, from No. 9 to No. 10 level, a thin and distinct vein was passed through,
having east underlay and north dip ; at the latter level it increased in
thickness in places to 12 and 14 feet, and yielded at times upwards of 1 oz,
per ton.
Transverse and longitudinal sections of the reefs herewith show their
physical character to be of anticlinal form, the apex being near the summit
of the hill, or between the two shafts.
ROOT’S BLOWER.
The progress of mining in this colony is perhaps under no small
obligation to this machine; this Company being the first to introduce it, our
expectations of its usefulness have been exceeded, in the preservation of
the miner’s health, improved ventilation, and considerable reduction of the
general cost of quartz mining, by lessening the number of winzes required.
To avoid the subject becoming too bulky, many salient points associated
with the early history and progress of the Company have been omitted ;
others are merely epitomized. In closing this brief historical sketch of the
first Quartz Company in Victoria, I desire to acknowledge the prudence and


perseverance of Mr. Davies (engineer) and other officers of the staff, as worthy
of record, in having contributed towards perfecting the Company’s appliances,
and helping to build Up an industry that now gives employment to nearly
12,000 men.
The Mine and machinery have always been open to visitors, and every
information given to those seeking it for practical purposes.
