Australia’s Call.
Set in the midst of the Southern seas
Afar from the nations old,
Her face uplift to the starry skies
That smile on her with their myriad eyes,
She watches the gates of gold.
She watches the golden gates that ope’
For the days that come and go ;
With hands outspread to her regions wide
Where wealth and treasure untold abide,
And deep broad rivers flow.
Eastward and westward, and north and south
The seas by her coastline run ;
From the land of eternal ice and snow,
From the land where the fierce tornados blow,
And the land of the rising sun.
Her bays are open, her harbours safe,
The blue of the sunlit skies
Reflects its hue in their shining depths,
And stretching inland, like giant steps
Her mountainous ridges rise.
Robed in the glory of sun and mists,
In patient reproach she stands.
Her hands are laden with gifts for man.
Her voice, as clear as the pipes of pan
Rings out to the distant lands.
She waits the children that are to come,
Longs for the tread of their feet ;
She has rich reward for all their toil,
There is life and health on her fertile soil,
And the joy of freedom sweet.
Oh, come ye ships from over the seas
From the crowded homeland dear;
Bring hither the children strong and true,
Who crave for the chance to dare and do,
New homes for themselves to rear.


Here are inland spaces wide and free,
And valleys and uplands fair;
Silent and empty, and love, they call,
Room for millions, and hope for all
Who come their bounty to share.
Australia.
Among the nations write her name,
Ye sons extol her rising fame
In ballad, song, and story.
No foes have beat against her doors ;
The pride of empire guards her shores ;
She sits in pristine glory.
(Chorus.)
Her starry flag floats proud and free,
Emblem of peace and liberty ;
O’er southern land and southern sea
Australia’s crown of glory.
No clash of arms, or boom of guns
Have marked the progress of her sons ;
In silence of the ages
She sits enthroned in peaceful state,
While worlds afar expectant wait
The opening of her pages.
No despot power she seeks to wield,
Freedom is graven on her shield,
Freedom and truth and honour.
Her fertile lands, her mountains rise
Resplendent ’neath the southern skies,
That rain their gifts upon her.
All round her coasts the southern seas
Lay out their treasures at her knees,
And balmy breezes, blowing,
Stir all her veins with buoyant health ;
Her hands are filled with untold wealth,
Her face with beauty glowing.


In Par Off Climes.
My native land forgotten ? No !
Tis dear to heart and memory yet;
Through the long years that come and go
The dear home isle we ne’er forget.
But other lands may claim our love ;
The children oft afar must roam ;
And other skies as brightly shine
As those that smiled on us at home.
And tho’ with trembling hearts we crossed
The stormy waves, and feared to find
A foreign, uncongenial shore ;
Our fears were false, our hopes were kind.
We found a new, bnt friendly land,
With kindly clime, and sunny skies ;
And kin from all the British Isles
Smiled their true welcome in our eyes.
We found a country great and fair,
With room, abundant room for all;
A wide and wealthy continent,
That but for sturdy children call.
Australia, ’tis a goodly land i
She wins the heart; her sunny smiles
Wakes joyful thoughts ; and cheerful hope
Of prosperous toil, all fear beguiles.
The grim despair of older lands
Is absent here ; her fertile soil
Laughs with her harvests ; well she pays
for strength and brains in honest toil.


To nobler heights, and broader thoughts
Her grander scenery lifts the soul.
Her forest lands their tribute pays,
And wave aloft their giant crests ;
All treasures of the world are hid
In secret chambers, ’neath her breast.
To torrid skies she lifts her head,
To Arctic snows she turns her feet;
And all the climes of all the earth
On her wide bosom have their seat.
A royal land ! A kindly land !
We are Australian on her shores;
And she is British at the heart,
And lavishly her gifts outpours.
Australia, dear adopted land!
We love her, love her skies so blue ;
The dear home isle we ne’er forget,
But here is home, as dear, as true.
A Golden Gift.
A golden gift is the gift of time,
Let us be glad—we yet may climb
To the full height of our heart’s desire,
If God and love our efforts inspire.
Let us take hold of the minutes and hours,
And make all the treasures they hold for us ours ;
Infinite love takes infinite pains,
And doubles the value of all that it gains.


If all our days were bright, and all the long year round,
Sweet flowers in our path were always to be found,
We should not half enjoy the pleasant sunny hours,
Nor should we value as we do the fair, fragrant flowers.
If all our roads were smoothe and level as the plain,
With ne'er a hill to climb, we should not think it gain
To save our feet the toil, and miss the lovely views
That we from their rough, breezy height may witness if we
choose.
If seas were always calm, and all the rivers ran
In channels straight, and cut all on the self same plan,
If skies were always clear it might convenient be ;
But would we for convenience sake choose such monotony.
If but one type of face we met where’er we went,
If but one only way the mind of man was bent,
If but one temperament marked all the human race,
The earth world would be a dreary world, a dull and dread-
ful place.
The great variety that greet us everywhere,
The toil we needs must face, the burdens we must bear,
The ups and downs of life, the lights and shadows blent,
Are means of health and strength to us, and make for our
content.
content.
’Tis good that we should meet opposing forces, and
Find need to use our wit, and contradictions stand ;
If no contrary winds blew strongly in our face
Our energies would surely rust for want of use and place.
The changing seasons wake the dormant thoughts of man,
To meet successive change he sets his mind to plan ;
The storms that mock his power stir his inventive skill,
He makes the very winds that blow subservient to his will.


Both mind and body gains, in sturdy efforts bent
To reach the highest goal that each one’s state present,
Each difficulty solved, like a great lesson learned
Makes each succeeding one to be more easily discerned.
And wherefore, then, should we affliction so bewail
With hot rebellious hearts ’till faith and courage fail ?
If change and conflict give new vigor to the mind,
Should not the spirit also need discipline of some kind ?
If sorrow never came then we should never know
How deeply we can feel for one another’s woe ;
The soul that never grieves can never pity feel,
Nor love with love that’s worth the name, ’tis cold and hard
as steel.
And selfishness would rule, and no impulse would rise
For purer, better things than seen with human eyes,
The soul that never feels a need, or fear, or pain,
Is but a little puny thing, and such it will remain.
And so the pain and fear—the conflict of the soul,
The struggles it must make to reach the wished for goal,
Brings out its very best, makes it expand and grow,
Until at last tis perfected as nothing else we know.

When we were young
Hope coloured all things with a rosy hue
And faith, untried, and scarcely understood,
Went hand in hand with hope;
As children think, we thought and spake and knew,
When we were young.
But time passed on,
And we passed on as well, for nought stands still
Upon this busy planet, all things move
Onward to fruition ;
Things evil and things good their ends fulfill
As time goes on.
And so we found
The world was greater far than we had dreamed,
And we were smaller than we thought we were ;
And objects long desired
And fondly wished for, all unworthy seemed
When hope was crowned.
For larger views
Brought deeper things to light, and old thoughts passed
And broader ones unfolded in their place,
And not so clear was it
In life’s bewildering maze what would stand fast
If one should choose.
New duties came,
And difficulties multiplied and grew,
And life was more than dreams, and yet was blent
With fair hopes still,
And faith reached out to grasp the great and true
Through all that came.
Through all that came !
And how can pen present in few brief lines
The daily toil, the slips and broken plans,
The wisdom—dearly bought
Through pain, and failure of our best designs
In that which came ?


When we are young
We look at human lives as though each one
Were separate from others, and could be
Planned out as gardens are,
By walls divided : Thus so simply run
Our thoughts when young.
We have to learn
How life with life is linked and inetertwined,
How all our actions act and re-act on
Ourselves and those we meet:
No walls divide the gardens of the mind,
We must discern.
We come to see
We are not one, but a community
Made up of ones, the whole of which will make
A perfect whole and fair;
And learn we must, there’s no immunity
For thee or me.
So as the years
Pass on.and we pass on and wiser grow,
We cease to plan as in our youth we did,
And cease the chafing too
Because of fruitless labour, pain, or woe,
And fruitless years.
And fruitless years ?
No ! Failure teaches how we may succeed ;
From pain and disappointment cometh strength,
And courage to endure ;
New qualities develop at each need,
Not fruitless years !
And when we’re old
Not what we’ve done, or what we failed to do,
g
o
Will touch us as being most important ; but
The kind of spirit
Moving us the while we tried to do
As we grew old.


Little Bess.
Just a family of four in a little cottage home
And no sorrow e’er before had across its threshold come
When this evil thing befel with no warning to foretell,
And it worked an evil spell.
There was no foreboding fear, all was bright as hitherto,
And the mother’s eyes were clear, like unto the sky so bine,
And her face was good to see ; and the child laughed merrily,
Sitting by grandmother’s knee.
Grandmother looked on the child, smoothing back the curly
hair,
Fondly looked on her and smiled, for she was both sweet
and fair ; .
Her son Reuben’s little one. Her son Reuben—such a son
As a mother leans upon.
So she smiled on little Bess, and the young eyes smiling
back,
Full of love and tenderness, understanding did not lack :
Eyes like father’s, so they said, and that pleased the little
maid,
’Twas a compliment that paid.
p'or her father, in her eyes, was perfection every whit,
As a child can idolise so in worship she would sit
At his feet, and ’tween they two tender love as ever grew
Bound them heart to heart so true.
But the hours wore away, and the household tasks were
done,
What was wrong this Saturday that the father did not come ?
This day he should earlier be. Bessie looks out wonderingly,
But no sign of him can see.
i
V
Grandmother puts down the sock she is knitting for her son,
Mother’s looking at the clock. There is nothing to be done ;


But the child cannot be still, vague alarms her bosom fill
All against the little will.
Still they wait. Why, never yet has he been so late as this,
And the child begins to fret, missing father’s evening kiss ;
Pale with dread their faces grow. Something must have
happened, though
No one comes to tell them so.
Then the little weeping maid crouching in her mother's
arms,
Head upon her bosom laid, sobs and cries her wild alarms—
“ Father’s sick somewhere,” she said, “ Father’s surely,
surely dead.”
“ Oh, he’ll never come,” she said.
And the morning found them so, and they blessed the morn-
ing light,
Faces pale and full of woe showed how dark had been the
night ;
Then the cheerful face of day somewhat did their fears allay,
Brought again a hopeful ray.
But the day brought no relief, and the sun went down again,
Keener, deeper grew the grief, search and ’quiry all in vain ;
And the stars shone in the sky, and the fair moon rose on
high
While the hours crept slowly by.
Little Bess exhausted lay on her mother’s lap asleep,
She had wept and moaned all day, ’till she could no longer
weep ;
Now the mother feared to stir lest she should awaken her
From this only comforter.
Wife nor mother closed their eyes, not for them came such
relief,
One thing only they surmised, sitting there in silent grief,
Thinking not of dark nor light, heeding not the time’s slow
flight,
Scarcely speaking all the night.
I
a


Still the day no tidings brought, friends drew near in sym-
pathy,
Oil ! the three were nigh distraught, and despairing utterly ;
But the child no longer cried ; pale as death and heavy
eyed,
She clung to her mother’s side.
Then a rumour, but it grew, and the truth at last was know,
Swift, from lip to lip it flew —who the painful task would
own ?
And a silence on them fell, honest anger in them swell
At the story they must tell.
Twas the old, old craze for gold. Reuben and a dozen more—
An ! the story must be told—sailed for far Australia’s shore
This one man had stolen away like a thief that fears the day
Sailed from London yesterday.
Oh, the shining of the sun, and the blueness of the sky !
New life into pulses run that had long been numb and dry ;
All the outside world so fair with the breath of spring in air,
With the new life everywhere.
Oh, the beauty of the earth ! How the larks and thrushes
sang,
Only in that home was dearth ; laughter through the wood-
lands rang,
Only they heard not nor saw, unto them 'twas winter raw,
Bitier frost without a thaw.
The old mother bowed her head, and the other heart kept
still,
No word of reproach they said, only felt the deathly chill
Creeping up and over them, as life’s current it would stem,
And from all the sunshine hem.
And the child ? Oh, it was woe on so young a face to see
Such a look of anguish grow. She was broken utterly,
Broken all the springs within ; never more her laugh would
ring,
The young life was withering.


Other men had gone away, and they wrote unto their wives.
Only from those letters they heard of Reuben, otherwise
They had nothing ever known. He of all those men alone
Sent no message to his own.
Little Bess had ceased to weep, but she surely pined away,
Only sometimes in her sleep bare her sorrow she would lay,
Calling in heart rending tone, “ Father, father do come
home !
Oh, he’ll never never come !”
Ah, the tragedies of life ! some so inexplicable,
And the mother and the wife, with that cry so pitiful
Ever ringing in their ears, though it echoed all their fears,
Prayed again to see the tears.
And they watched her hour by hour, everything love could
devise
Tried, to keep the little flower, dying thus before their eyes ;
But their hearts were rent in twain seeing all their efforts
vain,
She would never rise again
All things else were put aside ; both had thought but neither
said
There was no one to provide, they would have to earn their
bread ;
But the child was now their care, ’twas as much as they
could bear
This sad vigil now to share.
And one day the angel came, in the sunshine—only they
Did not give him such a name, and no welcome words could
say ;
Only she—the little maid—called him so, and motion made—
“ Mother, lift me up,” she said.
“ Mother, Grandmother ! Just see! There’s a shining in
the room,
And 'tis shining all on me. Oh, I shall be better soon.”
And she was, a little sigh, then the breath stopped suddenly.
Ah ! It was not hard to die.

Fair Australia ! Happy isle !
Land where peace and plenty smile,
Whose heroes fought with axe and plough
To win the laurels for her brow ;
Her pioneers who cleared the way
For those who dwell in peace to-day ;
Through perils great, and arduous toil
To plant a nation on her soil.
Let their brave deeds remembered be !
Let their brave deeds remembered be !
And write their name in song and story,
Forerunners of Australia’s glory.
Bugle call, nor clash of bands,
Brought them forth from far offlands
To fight for liberty or fame ;
As men of peace and toil they came,
Nor those who fought through fire and blood,
And through red battle’s horrors rode,
Owned braver hearts ; or sturdier deeds
Accomplished for their country's needs.
Then let their names remembered be !
Then let their names remembered be !
And write their deeds in song and story,
Australia’s pride, Australia’s glory.
Strong, courageous, nerves of steel ;
Tasks herculean mark their zeal ;
Through fire, and flood and drought they
[fought,
Nor deem’d success too dearly bought,
When with their lives the toll they paid,
And in their lonely graves were laid ;
True heroes all, the noble band
Who opened up this wond’rous land.
Then let their deeds remembered be!
Let their brave deeds remembered be !
And write their names in song and story,
Australia’s pride, Australia’s glory.


The River.
How much it is like life :
A winding river, flowing
Along its narrow bed,
And ever onward going ;
Not always swift, nor deep,
Nor always slow, or shallow,
Nor always does the sun
Throw o’er it golden halo.
The silv'ry stream flows on
Through scenes of hushland beauty,
And murmurs its content :
That is its simple duty ;
Anon, its course is changed,
Rough grows the way before it ;
And ruffling at each stone.
It pushes round, and o’er it.
And one by one they’re passed ;
And then the banks grow steeper,
The shadows creep around,
The narrow bed grows deeper ;
But on the river flows,
Tho’ silently, and slower;
It has no heart to sing,
Dark banks above it lower.
Still bravely flowing on
With deep and solemn beauty,
Through channels for it cut
It does its simple duty ;
Anon it broadens out,
The steep banks disappearing,
Again it sings and leaps,
And dances through the clearing.
0
f
a


But soon its song is stopped,
It moveth like one weary ;
The sunshine cheers it not,
Nor makes its way less dreary ;
The broad and sandy bed,
Tho’ fringed with summer beauty
Exhausts its strength, and yet
It still can do its duty.
It struggles bravely on,
And ruffling round the flowers,
Refresh their thirsty roots
In place of truant showers.
And on, and on it goes,
Its bosom always showing
In daytime or the night
That it is ever flowing.
Its channel lieth plain,
Through scenes or not of beauty ;
Its work, to follow on
To do its simple duty.
The journey ends at last ;
It finds with glad emotion,
And leaps to join its voice
With the music of the ocean.


The plains are grey and withered,
The hills are brown and bare,
The sign of desolation is painted everywhere ;
The thirsty cattle wistfully
In dumb bewildered pain
Beside the empty creeks and dams
Linger and wait in vain—
Linger and wait till they
Are fain to lay them down,
For in the sunburnt herbage
No nourishment is found,
And thirst and hunger slays them there,
Nor e’en the trees can lend
A shelter from the scorching heat
To soothe their bitter end ;
For bush and trees ail shrivelled are—
In mute dismay they stand,
Their leaves like bits of parchment
That crackle in the hand.
Oh! piteously the earth looks up
Beseeching as it were,
A cooling drop on her hot face
To save her from despair,
But the burning sky looks down
Unchanging and unmoved,
So pitiless, ah, pitiless,
As though it ne’er had loved
The picture of the fair green earth
And blooming bright hued flowers,
Of shining lakes and running creeks,
And scented leafy bowers.
v
c?
O Earth! O Earth! She grieveth
For all her creatures dear,
Her founts are dry, she hath not


O Earth ! O Earth ! She crieth
In sore distress and pain
“ O, ye heavens, beseech you,
Send down the needed rain :
For I am parched, oh ! I am parched,
All hot and parched and dry,
And all my creatures are athirst,
And loud for water cry.
Water, water ! Oye clouds
Come ’twixt us and the glare
Of the hot sun whose scorching rays
Fall on my bosom bare ;
Whose breath has set the plains on fire
And fiercely swept them through,
And in the mad devouring flames
Devoured our forests too.
“Our crops are gone, our homesteads
In blackened heaps are left,—
Ah, water, water, O ye clouds,
E'er all of life are reft!”
There is no pity in the sky.
That hazy mist ye see
Is only heat. Cease, cease to cry.
No pity there for thee !
O man, O man, despairing,
How helpless are ye now ;
Where is thy wisdom and thy skill ?
To this ye fain must bow.
Ye plough the ground and sow the seed,
Ye labour hard, I trow,
But whence are fertile showers to come
To make the seed to grow ?
*
*


The sky is deaf, the earth is mute,
Nor either help can give ;
Yea, thine own life is threatened,
Ye find it pain to live.
There is a fever in thy veins,
Thy lips are parched and dry,
Ye stagger o’er the burning ground
Almost too weak to cry.
Ye have no help within yourself,
Ye see no help beside—
O, man, hast thou forgotten God
In all thy selfish pride ?
And yet, and yet the soul cries out
Instinctively through all
With piteous cry, to Him—the strong,
And beats against the wall—
Clinging to that great name of love,
Refusing to let go,
Beating despair back all the while
With the great strength of woe.
The sky is deaf, but God is not —
The earth is mute, but He
Ever the same, doth heed the cry
Of weak humanity.
There is Thine help—He sends the rain
Or holds it at His will;
Hard lessons man doth sometimes need,
But God has patience still.
Dear God above, for Thy great love
Hear, hear our piteous cry ;
Put forth Thy hand ; we are distressed,
Suffer us not to die.
Our sins, O God, rise upward
Before us like a cloud,
And o’er and round us gather
Like an enfolding shroud ;
They almost blot thine image out
We scarcely dare to raise


Our supplicating eyes to Thee
Whom we forgot to praise.
And yet, and yet we cry to Thee :
To whom else shall we cry ?
Thou hold’st the waters in thy hands,
Thou givest full supply
Dear God above, for thy great love,
Turn not away thine ear,
Send health to us in our distress,
We fear this death so near ;
We fear this death that rears itself
Before our frightened eyes,
And brings us on our knees to thee
With supplicating cries.
We have not thought of Thee before,
Or if we did, ’twas but
A passing thought we took not in,
Or quickly from us shut.
O God, dost hear ? By our own mouths
Ourselves we do condemn,
Our sins rise upward o’er our heads
We see thee not through them ;
We show our undeserving worth
By our confession base,
And back we shrink within ourselves
In sore and shamed amaze.
Thou God above, now do we feel
Our utter worthlessness,
Brought up against our bitter need,
And utter helplessness.
We look back o’er the past,
And scarcely dare to raise
Our weeping eyes to thee
Whom we forgot to praise ;
And looking down our hearts
We fear, we dare not say
Our future shall be thine,
If we escape to day.
f
I


And yet, and yet our souls reach out
Instinctively through all,
With piteous cry to thee —the strong,
And beats against the wall,
Clinging to thy great name of love,
Refusing to let go ;
Beating despair back all the while
With the great strength of woe.
What is that sound we hear afar ?
What breath is this that sweeps
Across our heated faces ? what
Is this that o’er us creeps ?
Thank God ! We spring upon our feet
And swiftly gaze around ;
Clouds are creeping up the sky,
We hear a rumbling sound
Like heavenly music coming near
Yea, nearer, till o’erhead
In crashing peals the thunder breaks,
And streaks the sky with red.
Great spots of rain fall here and there;
They stir the dust like tops ;
We spread our hands, so feverish hot,
To catch the precious drops !
We open wide our parched mouths ;
We scarcely think at all
But only wait with panting breast
To see the raindrops fall.
To see them, hear them, feel them, oh !
The precious, precious rain.
It comes ! it comes ! in showers it comes,
Yea, it pours down on the plain.


Dear God above, for thy great love,
We thank thee, praise thee. Hark !
How the loud thunder rolls along
In those great clouds so dark.
See, how the rain beats on the ground,
The thirsty, thirsty ground ;
See how the cattle drink, and drink ;
Oh, glorious sight and sound.
The flats are covered. Down the creeks
The muddy current flows :
Muddy, yet beautiful, with force
Increasing as it goes ;
From every water channel fed
Till, with tremendous roar,
It overleaps the rugged banks,
And the great plain spreads o’er.
Was e’er the air so sweet before ?
Oh, the delicious draughts
We draw into our fevered frames —
Like the drunkard when he quaffs
The fiery liquor dear to him,
Dearer than life itself,
But this delicious air to us
Is life, and strength, and health.
How bounteous is the hand of God ;
He opens heaven wide,
Lifts up the floodgate, and his gifts
Come in a rolling tide.
We deal our little bounties out
In wretched little doles ;
O God, with thy unselfish love
Touch thou our selfish souls.
We thank thee ; yea, we thank thee, God,
Our hearts are grateful now,
And it requires no effort
In gratitude to bow.
Reach down and touch our selfish souls,


E’er we forget again ;
Break up the drought within us,
Lest mercy be in vain ;
Lest when we turn our eager eyes
O’er verdant plains once more,
We turn us to our old, old ways,
Ungrateful as before.
Hope.
The winter may be dreary,
Its nights be long,
But spring is surely coming
With its sweet song.
With buds and perfume laden
’Twill soon be here,
With new life in its bosom
It draweth near.
Last summer’s blooms are withered,
But there shall be
From seeds they dropped, upspringing
So wondrously,
More blossoms, full as lovely ;
And ye shall see
The hillsides and the valleys
Clothed gloriously.
The soft-hued ferns and mosses
In shady nooks,
The springing grasses tender
Shall ope’ their books,
And ye shall learn their lessons :
How winter’s days
Were days of preparation
For springtime praise.

Christmas Greetings.
Once more are Christmas greetings
Being wafted to and fro,
Once more have hands been busy
And hearts all in a glow,
Preparing simple tokens,
Or precious gifts of love :
The lesson of the olive,
The message of the dove.
The time of times for gladness
When heart to heart doth speak,
When kindliest thoughts are kindled
And for an outlet seek ;
When gentle words come ready,
And smiling lips are quick
To say a word of comfort
To the weary or the sick.
What thoughts come out to greet us
From memory’s treasured store,
What tender recollections
We have of days of yore.
No other day scarce touches them,
The whole year through they seem
To sleep, or do but stir us
As a sort of misty dream.
But ’neath the spell of Christmas
To active life they spring,
And long hushed voices sing us
The songs they used to sing ;
And eyes long since filmed over
Smile back in ours, so glad,
That, though our eyes dim quickly
Our souls are not made sad.


And o’er our softened spirits
A tender feeling steals
For those who may have wronged us :
The blessed balm that heals.
The spirit of forgiveness
Is strong in us to day,
The Prince of Peace breathes through us,
We cannot say him nay.
What time like this for greeting
With words of peace and cheer
Both friendly and unfriendly ;
The whole whole world's hope is here,
In those grand words—eternal,
Sublime, and sweet, and true :
Peace, Goodwill, Salvation,
That story ever new.
O sacred time of Christmas !
O time of happy cheer !
We send our joyful greetings
To friends both far and near ;
We lift our faces heavenward,
And raise our voice in song,
All glory be to God on high !
To whom all praise belong.


Nancy, dearest, who so fair ?
Nancy, with the wavy hair.
Glint of brown and bronze and gold
In each shining wave and fold.
Eyes of deep unclouded blue,
The dear spirit looking throu-gh,
Brimming o'er with love benign
Half of earth, and half divine.
Nancy, dearest, look this way :
What do humble lovers say
When their hearts are captured quite
And they in their bonds delight ?
Nancy has no need to speak,
A soft rose in either cheek
Blossoms out so ruddily :
So does Nancy answer me.
Smiling lips, with curves so sweet :
Straight I throw me at her feet;
Nancy, Nancy, smile on me !
I would all their sweetness see.
Lilt of birds is in the air,
Scent of flowers everywhere,
Bells of Eden ringing low,
All the world with love aglow.
Dawn of day and spring of year
All the time when Nancy’s near ;
Life’s best gift to have and hold—
Nancy to my heart I fold.


“Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
Look upon a little child” :
So the little children pray,
Lisping forth from day to day
To the unseen Christ above
Tender thoughts of trust and love.
“Pity my simplicity,
Suffer me to come to thee
And with pity infinite,
From his throne so high and bright
He bends down to hear the cry,
To the helpless lambs draws nigh.
“Fain I would to thee be brought,
Gracious God forbid it not
Round those little kneeling forms
He spreads out protecting arms.
“These are mine,” he whispers low ;
“These I bled for long ago.”
“In the kingdom of thy grace
Give a little child a place.”
Love divine its radiance shed
O'er each lowly little head ;
Round each child the kingdom lies,
Tho’ unseen by human eyes.
“Fain I would be as thou art,
Give me thy obedient heart,”
Oh ! the ineffable grace
Beaming forth from that dear face ;
With what deep compassion He
Listens to the tender plea,
Fills the children’s hearts with peace,
Makes their little fears to cease ;


Long Ago and Bye-and-Bye.
Long ago and by-and-bye !
How we linger o’er the theme.
Thought and fancy hand in hand,
Walking through the silent land,
In a sort of tender dream.
Recollections fill the mind,
Shadowy visions catch the eye,
Mysteries deep the spirit move,
Things we yearn to know and prove
Of long ago, and by-and-bye.
Round about us lies the now,
Minutes golden pass our way ;
Life’s true gates are open wide,
Pulses beat on every side,
Here, and now, and every day.
Here, and now, and every day
Grander problems to us bring ;
Mines to search, and heights to climb,
Deeds to do that through all time
Echoes of our steps will ring.
Sound of voice, and touch of hand ;
Thrill and throb of warm true heart,
Giving out the best it can,
Reaching to its utmost span :
This is living’s noblest part.


The Only Boy.
She rocked her baby to sleep,
Folding him close to her breast
Where he nestled cosily down
Contented and pleased with his nest.
With love in her heart welling up,
She sang as she rocked to and fro
The songs that she loved when a child ;
As though the dear baby could know.
And many air castles she planned
In the strength of her pride and love,
The baby the centre of each
When manhood his bosom should move.
She stood by her beautiful boy,
So healthy, and eager, and bright ;
And smiled at his boyish adventures,
Told over to her with delight.
She smoothed all his pathway with love,
As only a mother can do ;
And counsels, tender and wise
Like a guard around him she threw.
The dear little baby has gone,
The beautiful boy has fled :
A tall and sturdy young man
Now stands by her side instead.
Her hands over his tightly fold
While she draws him close to her side ;
It needed no words to explain
Why he strives from her eyes to hide.
No word of reproof she speaks,
No anger ; but up from the deeps


The heart's disappointment and pain,
When cherished hopes melt into air !
Oh, the love, the faith, and the trust
Wrecked on the Rock of Despair !
The Dreams of Our Youth.
The beautiful hopes of our youth,
How far from our grasp do they seem,
Just like an impossible dream,
And we thought to attain them forsooth !
What pictures we painted of life !
How soft were the lines that we drew,
With sunshine and flowers all through,
And no shadow, or trouble, or strife.
How brave we intended to be ;
How faithful, how tender, how kind.
We thought not of limits confined,
For to us all was boundless and free.
What good we intended to do
In a vague, indefinite way ;
We thought of it day after day
Until fair to our fancy it grew.
Looking o’er the past from afar,
What have we accomplished, or done ?
Shall we count by the victories won ?
Ah! what pitiful failures we are.
Yet shall we sit down in despair,
As though we had nothing in view ?
There’s time for us yet to be true
And to realise hopes that are fair.


Night and Morning.
Standing on the threshold
Night and morning meet,
One so old and weary,
One so young and sweet.
Night is closely shrouded,
Wrapped in shadows grey,
Slowly, slowly creeping
Down the lonely way.
Sleep shuts down the eyelids,
All glad sounds are still,
Only mournful echoes
Through the darkness thrill.
Morning lifts her forehead,
Glances all around,
Plants her feet down firmly
With a cheery sound.
Birds begin to flutter,
Life begins to stir ;
All the lovely blossoms
Lift their heads to her.
For the shining sunbars
Glinting on her gown
Shed their glory o’er them
Like a golden crown.
Right upon the threshold
We shall one day stand,
Night and morning meeting
On the border land ;
E’er we softly enter
From the shadows grey,
From the mournful echoes
Into endless day.


Granny Has Fallen Asleep.
Granny has fallen asleep,
Fallen asleep at last,
A smile on her thin white lips
That smiled so oft in the past.
Smoothe back the silvery hair ;
She will not wake again.
All her toiling is over,
All her sorrow and pain.
There is no shade of trouble
Left on the still, calm face,
Only a tender beauty
In its dear lines we trace.
Long she lay in the shadows,
Just by the river of death ;
Waiting, longing to cross it,
Praying with feeble breath.
Now at last she has crossed it,
Crossed the dark waves in her sleep
And opened her eyes in heaven,
While we on the earth do weep.
Porget-Me-Nots.
Who gave thee thy sweet name,
Forget-me-not ?
From fond heart sure it came :
Forget-me-not.
No matter, floweret blue,
For I love you ;
You tell me love is true,
And I love you.


Wond’rons sweet eyes ye have,
So deeply blue ;
The secret I would know :
Stole ye their hue
From the bright sky above
So calmly clear,
Or was it given for love,
A love-gift dear ?
So meekly fair ye gleam
O floweret blue,
So cheerful bright ye seem.
Like fond hearts true ;
I pin you on my breast,
My true love star,
For there my true love rest
Whose badge ye are.
The Old, Old World.
’Tis an old, old world,
But it isn’t too bad a place
To live, and love, and learn in,
And run life’s race ;
If we face the lessons bravely
And do the best we can,
There’s nothing nobler that one can do
To fulfil life’s plan.
And there’s time for play,
For it isn’t all toil; the bell
Always rings for recess, and we
Leave off work for a spell ;
And there’s plenty of fun, and there’s
Sunshine between the showers,
And it isn’t too bad a place—
This old, old world of ours.


The Rose Garden.
The turf is smooth as a carpet,
The beautiful, soft green turf!
The walks are finely gravelled,
And winding in and out
The shapely shrubs and borders;
And every here and there,
The gleam of marble statues
Shows purely white and fair;
And the sound of falling water
Makes music for the ear.
This is the garden of roses,
Bow down at their witching shrine!
They shed rich fragrance o’er you;
Do you want a spray to twine
In the silky locks of a maiden,
Of a dark or a golden sheen?
Or a bouquet all white for a bridal?
Or a wreath for the brow of a queen?
Or a single hud from the cluster,
A rare sweet bud, to express
The love of a heart for a lifetime,
To one you would fain possess?
In wild, yet cultured profusion,
They grow in this garden fair,
The dainty delicate flowers!
And exquisite colours they wear.
Over the trellised arbour
They creep, and cluster, and trail;
Over the rounded arches
They fall like a shrouding veil.
And my Lady sits in the arbour
With some dainty work in her hands,


And leaning against the pillar
Her noble lover stands;
With a cloud on his handsome features —
A cloud that is almost a frown,
But my Lady’s hands are busy,
And her eyes on her work cast down.
The arbour is cool and shady.
And the trailing ends of a vine
Swings to and fro in the casement
At the touch of the passing wind;
And just where my Lady is sitting
So 'busy, and prim, and fair,
A streak of golden sunshine
Falls on the waves of her hair.
Just one little streak of sunshine
Stolen in through the lattice of green,
Just one little flickering sunbeam
Playing over and in between
The wavy coils and crinkles —
My Lady—she does not know;
But my Lady’s lover sees it,
And it turns his head, I trow.
The little curling tendrils,
Like fine threads of burnished gold,
Falling o’er the smooth white temples,
And the dancing sunbeam bold;
Like the stirring of the tree-tops
As the windstorm draweth nigh,
So his heart is stirred and quickened,
And his fears take wings and fly.
And love o’erleaps the flood-gate,
And the air electric grows,
Till, my Lady—she feels something


That disturbs her calm repose;
And she lifts her eyes demurely
To her lover’s face, and lo!
All the air is charged with magic,
And the magic winds do blow.
Stately lilies, chastely fair,
White as driven snow,
Where no sullying feet has been
Treading to and fro.
Could a soul be pure as these?
Ah! I do not know.
So exceeding fair to see
Bright and pure and cold;
Yet they have a fragrant scent
And a heart of gold;
And they stir the holiest thoughts
That our bosoms hold.
Other lilies, too, are here,
Of such radiant dyes,
That one thinks of rainbow hues,
And red sunset skies;
And a glimpse of tropic lands
Pass before one’s eyes.
But it is no eastern shore
’Neath its glowing sky,
That awakes the sudden thrill,
And the wishful sigh,
To another, colder clime
On swift wings to fly.
Rugged shores and granite walls,
Washed by mighty seas;
Moorlands, gay with yellow broom,


Swept by salt sea breeze;
Paler skies, perhaps, but where
Fairer scenes than these?
Every rugged peak and rock
Has a tale to tell.
Moss-grown ruins here and there
Hold one like a spell;
Voice of sea and memory rise
In one rythmic swell.
Legend old, and story true
Interwoven so,
That one cannot tell apart
Which is which, I trow;
And, maybe, one never cared
Overmuch to know.
Greener woods and meadow lands
Where else would ye see?
Fairer landscapes stretching out,
Bold and broad and free;
Stately mansions, old and grey
With antiquity?
Prosperous towns and cities fair,
Where the full tide flow;
Give to me the quiet joys
Of the country slow;
Where one may have time to think,
And one’s thoughts may grow.
Down the narrow road once more
With swift, eager feet;
Busy crowds are far behind,
Country folk we greet;
Friendly nod and genial smile
As when friends do meet.


Cheerful sounds of /farmyard life
Fall upon the ear;
Fragrant scents float on the breeze:
Fields and gardens near
Silent homage offering up,
For the fruitful year.
Quaint old villages, whose age
No one here could tell,
Dear old cottages, wherein
Quaint old people dwell;
Some have never been beyond
Sound of the church bell.
Down a winding lane once more,
Oh, the pure delight!
Hedgerow green on either side,
Dear familiar sight!
Treasures of our childhood days
Growing left and right.
Primroses and violets
In nests of tender green,
The snowdrop and the bluebell,
And trailing vines between;
So lavish and luxuriant
Has nature ever been.
Hark! what melody of sound
Thrills from all around;
Such a tribe of singing birds
In this lane abound;
The shrillest of the crickets, too.
Help to swell the sound.
And the chant from yonder woods
Hear it! swelling high,
Soughing of the friendly trees


As the wind sweeps by;
One may often hear the strain
Of woeful sob and sigh.
Listen to the rise and fall
In a rythm grave,
As the wind with master hand,
Sweeping, wave on wave.
Up and o’er the wond’rous keys,
Fill each aisle and nave.
Aisle and nave of shimmering green,
And a wide sweep of hall.
A blue canopy o’erhead;
And where the shadows fall
Most delicate of tracery
On pillar, floor and wall.
Those green woods were fairyland
To our childish eyes;
Hiding in their quiet depths
Many a gladsome prize;
Airy castles there we built,
Building childish wise.
Glade and dell and ferny bank
Furnished ample space,
Sunlight flickering through the trees
Gave all light and grace;
And such patterns as it wove
No man’s hand could trace.
Glint of gold and blu e of skies,
Flowers sweet and gay,
Lent their colours to the scene,
Glorified the day;
Berries furnished food and wine,
Making brave display.


Fair romances there we wove
In those leafy bowers;
Wond’rous beings people them
Born to wond’rous powers;
Working out the bravest plans
Through the sunny hours.
Happy, happy childish play!
Innocent and free;
Spinning sunshine into gold,
Gilding all to be;
Do we in our wiser days
Spin as earnestly?
Older visions come to mind,
Older dreamers, too;
Wandering through those leafy glades,
Tender fancies grew
Into visions passing sweet,
Tho’ they came not true.
Ah, fond heart! what moves thee now?
Dreaming, listening still?
Catching murmurs soft and sweet,
Like yon trickling rill
Running in its narrow track,
Yonder pond to fill.
Well ye know where is the spring
Whence the water flows;
Pure and clear it bubbles up
Cold as winter snows;
Fern and moss and tender plant
All around it grows.
There are many rills through life
Running to the sea,
Pure and sweet from bubbling spring,


Tiny tho’ they be
They make verdure all the wa y
To eternity.
Foolish heart! What is it now.
What is it ye hear?
Hark! from the olden linden tree
Full and sweet and clear,
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! thrills
On the listening ear.
Six-and-twenty years and more
Since ye heard that sound.
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! hush!
Softlier tread, the ground
Is hallowed by those yesterdays
That memory gathers round.
Morning joy and evening pain,
Winter frosts and blights;
Friendly eyes of shining stars
Through the sleepless nights,
Glowing in the darken’d skies
Like true beacon lights.
Life is such a mystery,
Winding on and on,
Its mysterious currents
Bearing us along;
Each heart has need of courage,
Each spirit to be strong.
Time’s waves roll ever onward,
There is no backward flow;
On, towards the shores eternal;
Adverse winds may blow,
But each frail barque sails ever
Towards the sunset glow.


THE WAR OF MAN WITH MAN.
The war of man with man, and class With class
Like a great flood the whole wide earth would span.
Nor each will listen to the other’s plaint:
Wild passion leads and breaketh all restraint
In wars of man with man.
Men cry for justice that will render none,
Call for protection, while they break the laws;
Bawl out for liberty, and freedom claim
To do whate’er they choose in Freedom’s name,
And call it Freedom’s cause.
When tongues are set for strife crowds run to hear,
And grievances unthought of spring to life;
The voice of discord ever gains the ear;
Men hasten on the evils that they fear
When tongues are set for strife.
The rule of folly enters every rank,
Men think in crowds, or one man thinks for all;
While each one clamours to be master still,
He, at his pleasure bends them to his will,
And holdeth them in thrall.
When selfishness shall cease, and men shall rise
To right conception of the things they crave;
When Reason comes into her kingdom, and
Restraint, and self-restraint together stand,
Then Hate no more shall rave.
When men shall seek the Truth as ‘they seek gold,
And render righteous judgment each to each,
Tempered with grace of kindness, they shall see
The law that breaks the rule of tyranny,
And all that it would teach.
There is an healing power. When man shall love
His fellowmen his brothers, then shall be
In place of bitter strife the reign of peace;
Love bindeth hearts in concord, war shall cease
When Love hath victory.


Set in a garden full of old-world flowers;
A garden of delight for leisure hours,
Kept in the nicest order that could be.
A quiet nook where brooding peace abide,
And tender thoughts ar e born; and music sweet
Like melody unwritten, yet complete,
So that the heart is cheered and satisfied.
A cheerful home, where, though the shadows fall
And darken all the landscape round about,
The light within burns clearly, shining out,
And piercing through the very darkest pall.
Love made this cot his constant dwelling-place,
And filled its every corner with himself;
Yea, made it richer than the homes o$ wealth,
And its rooms beautiful with tender grace.,
For those who lived beneath its humble roof,
He wove the charm that made their lives complete;
And mixed the cup of life’s elixir sweet,
That gives perpetual youth: behold the proof.
Two lovers, wedded more than fifty years,
And lovers still. Yea, the deep tenderness
That fill their hearts with such great blessedness,
Is stronger than youth’s passion, with its fears.
And their two lives are beautiful to see;
That dear old woman with her thin white hair.
And smiling face, that once was round and fair;
And sweet e’en now with love’s serenity.


The good such spirits do through a long life!
The seeds of life’s true greatness daily sown,
The way of life’s real happiness thus shown,
Unruffled by wild dreams, or worldly strife.
Together, up the hill of life they toiled,
And laboured as they went; together now
Are climbing down the other side, with brow
As placid as of yore, and hearts unspoiled.
They have had sorrow, pain and sorrow deep.
They are alone, no loving children come
With happy faces, paying visits home,
High holidays and festivals to keep.
And yet there is a little rocker there
That only fits a child, and in a case
A picture of a bonny little face;
And two soft curls of different coloured hair.
And there’s a little knitted sock of wool,
Well worn and darned; and one small cap of red,
That covered once a little curly head;
Yea! sorrow’s cup for them was very full.
The children died. That’s what the neighbours said,
But those two loving souls, with strained eyes.
Looking far up into the starry skies,
Said, “No! they live, still live; they are not dead.”
And love bound up the wounds and dried the tears,
And whispered secrets of the better land;


And they in time no longer felt bereft.
Two lovers, hand-in-hand they walked life’s way
Unto old age, and it is fine to see
How lover-like the dear old man can be;
How he takes care of Nancy day by day.
Ben loves the garden. Every plant is dear,
And every shrub and tree; I’ve heard him say
They talk to him; and well I know the way
They speak to hearts that love and ears that hear.
It is a pleasant sight to see his face
As he bends over this or that fair flower;
Or sitting in the little shady bower
To rest himself. It is a holy place.
Hallowed by holiest thoughts and truest prayer,
And the sincerest worship that can be;
The lifting of the heart continually.
Spontaneous as the song of birds in air.


FLEET DAY.
Sydney is all alive to-day,
Her streets are draped in brave array;
Triumphal arches, garlands bright
With flowers and greenery left and right;
And bunting flutters everywhere,
•Gay bunting fluttering on the air;
With banners floating proud and free,
And all the city’s ooit to see.
Australia lifts her head to-day,
Her ships are riding up the bay;
Her smiling eyes are turned to greet
Our new Australian Naval Fleet.
The harbour shores are all alive,
Bach headland like a human hive;
Deep interest every bosom fill,
The air’s electric with the thrill;
And pride of home, and pride of race
Betrays itself in voice and face,
And cheer on cheer spontaneously
Ring out in welcome, full and free.
Chorus —
Who croaks of war and battle cries?
Lo, peace on all Australia lies!
And is she not a goodly land,
A noble heritage and grand!
With all her store and wealth of space?
But round her coastline oceans race,
And who shall guard her unlocked doors
If alien nations seek her shores?
Australia lifts her head to-day,
Her ships are riding in the bay;
Her smiling eyes are turned to greet
Our new Australian Naval Fleet.


SHADOWS.
(Standing in the deepening twilight
- Watching while the shadows fall
On the slopes and grassy pastures
And the eupoalyptus tall;
Watching, while the hills are shrouded
Slowly in those shadows grey,
And soft voices seem to murmur
Farewell to the fading day.
Watching while the clouds are creeping
Up the sky with darkening hue.
Till the last blue speck is hidden,
And the day has said adieu;
In the shadow of the pine trees,
Standing, watching, thinking slow,
Out towards the quiet heavens
My perturbed spirit go.
Peace and rest seem brooding round me,
Bird and beast, and earth and sky
Nestle ’neath their downy pinions;
Wistfully I note, and sigh:
Only human hearts are tossing
To and fro in restless mood,
Ever seeking, ever striving,
Ever craving other good.
Only human hearts are fretted
With the constant wear of life;
Chaffing ’gainst uneven conflict
Pressing on ’mid toil and strife;
While the shadows gath’ring round them
Shut them in with all their pain,
Still they struggle in the darkness,
Fret and chafe, and strive and strain.


A WHIMSEY.
Summer and Autumn, Winter and Spring,
Around the earth they circle and run;
And Time is only a magic ring
Of ethery gossamer spun.
The days and the weeks and months race on,
After each other just round and round;
The year is only the mystic band
By which they are holden and bound.
Morning and Noon, and Evening and Night,
Touching each other around they spin;
Young as the moment they first saw light
And the life of the world begin.
The earth spins round like a spinning top,
And round the sun in a circle wide
She is travelling gaily all the time.
And Luna sails on by her side,
Ocean currents and winds of the air,
Oh, round and round they circle and sweep;
The sky is only the gauzy walls
Of the orbit in which they keep.
The world is old, or the world is young,
Just as we take it; and every day
We do the things that were done before,
And we tread in the same old way.
Nothing is new and nothing is old,
We each fill a part in one great plane;
The thoughts we think are the same old thoughts
That ever moved the mind of man.


The w'hole round earth is a training school;
And whether we choose to work or play,
We toe the line in the magic ring
In the class that we call to-day.
But when the call imperative comes.
When school is over and home we go;
When out through the magic ring we slip,
Ah, then we shall surely know!
The Great Beyond, and the One Glad Day,
Where the circles end, and Time’s no more;
It holds the secrets we all would learn
Writ plain on that wonderful shore.
THE ROSE.
O soft moulded rose
With the tint of pale gold in thee,
A wond’rous sweet thought I see,
But all of thy story—who knows?
Love fashioned thee so,
And formed thee in fold upon fold.
Thy petals so daintiy rolled,
Twas love fashioned thee thus, I trow
And then to complete,
And just one more gift to impart
Breathed o’er thee and into thine heart
His own subtle essence so sweet.
And so, sweet flower,
When time thy soft beauty has slain,
Still fragrant thy petals remain,
Reminder of Love’s dear power.


Death’s Journey
Up the dusty broad highway horse and rider slowly
passed,
And the rider’s visage grey solemnly was overcast;
Like a spectral pair they rode and no eyes on them
abode
But a sudden terror showed.
In the full light of the noon up the sunny road they
went,
All men’s hearts began to swoon when those eyes were
on them bent,
Shrinking back with quick’ning breath, knowing tho’ no
word he saith,
That the rider’s name is death.
‘’Touch us not, O Death,” they cried, shrinking back
in sore affright,
Striving from his gaze to hide as if fearing sudden blight;
Mutely praying him begone. And he silently passed
Whom they feared to look upon
Looking oft to left and right with a searching glance
around,
In those eyes so coldly bright there was sadness, deep,
profound:
”Tho’ his face they cannot see, in their hearts they hold,
said he,
Poe more terrible than me.”
At a cottage door he stays, o’er the step his shadow
falls,
Two old people meet his gaze, each by name he softly
calls;
But they cower in dismay, feebly moaning—“not to-day.”
With a frown he turned away.


Past their three score years and ten, bowed with toil and
earthly care;
Useless to their fellow men, poverty’s dry crust they
share;
Yet they fear my face to see, tho’ I bring them liberty
Yea, for this time let them be!
Sounds of mirth fall on his ear, song and laughter thrill
the air,
Horse and rider drawing near, look upon a picture fair;
Wealth and fashion in display, men and maids in fine
array,
Keeping up high holiday.
Suddenly a piercing cry, and a icy wave of fear,
One has caught the awful eye of the rider standing
near;
All the mirth dies instantly, and the whole fair com-
pany
Turn aghast dread death to see.
Life so fair, and death so near! Who can picture the
dismay?
Every heart beat quick with fear: Silently he turned
away.,
“Fools and blind!” he grimly said. “To earth’s follies
ye are wed.
With life’s work unfinished.”
On he rode with gloomy frown, (fire of wrath burned
in his eyes,
And his gaze went up and down ’till a village ho
espies,
Let in fragrant flowers, and trees; lulled to rest with
gentle breeze,
An embower’d home of peace.


From his look the anger fled, down the quiet street he
went,
But the horse’s muffled tread thrill of terror through it
sent;
Eyes with anguish wild and dim, frightened eyes look out
at him
As at monster fierce and grim.
No one gave him welcome there, no one offered courtesy;
Sound of weeping rent the air; slowly, dourly on rode
“Children all,” he muttered low, “heeding not how time
doth go,
Heedless, caring not to know.”
Faster then the horse he sped, o’er the rolling downs
they went,
And the sky was streaked with red for the day was
almost spent;
All the western sky alight, flaming up a radiant sight,
Ere it merged into the night.
Now there falleth on the ear the low moaning of the sea,
And the mightly cliffs appear, awful in immensity;
And the great Atlantic waves, with a booming at their
base,
All the lower reaches lave.
The grey rider pulls the rein and the horse obedient
stands,
While their eyes roam o’er the main reaching out to
distant lands,
Swelling, heaving to and fro, redden’d with the sunset
glow.
Capped with ridges white as snow. ri


Then the redness of the sun seem’d to leap into their
eyes,
Horse and rider act as one, one dark thought within
them rise;
Swiftly as if he had wings the pale steed his mane
upflings,
Both together outward swings,
With a loud exultant cry out upon the waves they
light,
And the white foam sweeping by quickly buries them
from sight,
But as lightly as the spray they rise up, ’twas only
play
To the horse, and rider grey.
Then the wind in anger rose to a frenzy, sweeping by,
With long swishing, curving blows, and a shrill, discord-
ant cry;
And the pale horse still with ease rode the heaving
angry seas,
Caring nought for storms like these.
East and west the clouds have swept all the sunset
colours out;
East and west the night has crept, flinging shadows all
about,
Darkening over sky and sea shadows many, wierd and
dree,
Creeping all so silently.
“Ho! Ho! Ho!’’ the rider cries, as they battle with
the storm,
High on mountain waves they rise, up and up in splendid
form;
Skimming o’er in wild delight, looking keenly left and
right.
Kindred spirits of the night.


Death’s cold eyes gleam fiercely now, there’s no softness
in their glance,
Salt spray crowns the dripping brow; eager the pale
horses prance,
Keen of sight and hearing, they leap to meet the coming
prey.
Ah, behold! a lab’ring ship, in a lightning flash it
shows,
Then into the darkness slip ’till another flash disclose
The dark object drawing near; and there falls upon
the ear.
Human voices hoarse with fear.
Toiling painfully, and tossed hither, thither, high and
Watery mountains sweep across threatening to engulf
her so;
But the vessel struggles through the black waters, and
the crew
Manfully their duty do.
Manfully, but little hope in their bosoms now remain,
With such seas they cannot cope; listen how the timbers
strain!
Leak below, and shattered mast, and the leak is gain-
ing fast,
Can they weather such a blast?
Ho! Ho! Ho! They hear the shout high above me
fearful din.
Faces pale are looking out, hearts grow colder yet
within;
Death, on his pale horse, they see glaring at them eagerly,
Riding to them joyously.


He has nearly reached the ship, clinging hands grow stiff
and cold,
Colour fled from cheek and lip, death before them now
behold,
When 10, the waters and the wind in a friendly league
combined,
Swiftly cometh up behind.
Round and round they dance and roar, round and round
they shriek and swirl,
Horse and rider off they bore in one swift terrific
whirl;
On and on in mad delight ’till the vessel’s out of sight,
On and on through all the night.
When the morning dawned, behold, all the storm had
died away,
On a far off beach there rolled that pale horse and rider
grey;
Borne in on the swelling tide, blown in from the ocean
wide;
Up they got in wrath and pride
Grandly swept the shining beach round the coast line
mile on mile,
No high cliffs to overreach, earth and sea together
smile,
Up the sands the pale horse strode, stiffly the grey rider
rode
Out into the shiningly road.
Fresh and sweet the morning breeze blows in rrom the
shim’ring sea,
But there comes a breath that freeze every bosom
instantly;
Sunlight turns to midnight drear, every heart grows cold
with fear
That our travellers come anear.


On they canter’d all the day and no welcome greeting
met,
Through suburban glades they stray, and the sun has
nearly set,
All the air around is rife with the sounds of city life.
Roar of traffic, din and strife.
No one saw the solemn pair, no eyes watched them as
they passed
Up the crowded thoroughfare, no one felt a chilly blast;
Sudden in his breast arise; all were busy otherwise,
Heart and brain and ear and eyes.
Now the streets have narrow grown, though the build-
ings still are high,
There’s a change in air and tone in the people passing
Lights and signs not good to see, sounds all out of
harmony,
Sin and want and misery.
Squallour, poverty and woe mark these regions for their
own,
’Tis a sight all cities know nor belongs to this alone;
Yet not all is evil here, there are angels very near
Leavening the atmosphere.
Down a narrow, grimy court turn the travellers; all is
grey,
In this evil drear resort, where no purifying ray
Of the sun can penetrate, dirt and darkness love to
mate,
Sin and sorrow on them wait.
But there’s angels everywhere, even in these dark
abodes,
Where the rooms and cupboards bare unto sin so often
goads;


There are angels no one sees hov’ring round in homes
like these,
Breathing heavenly harmonies.
One dim candle lights the gloom where a shrunken
creature lies,
The sole inmate of the room, visible to human eyes;
Sisters —poor as she herself —share with her their meagre
wealth,
And would gladly share their health.
Suddenly she lifts her eyes, there’s a tapping at the
door,
Then a look of glad surprise creepeth her pale features
o’er,
And the form that entereth is that same grey rider.
Death,
Whom she gladly welcometh
“Welcome; welcome, Death!” she said, and he drew her
to his breast,
Where she laid her weary head, glad to find so sure a
rest;
And there stole a wond’rous grace over that poor
wasted face,
Lying on that resting place.
And he bore her thence away, smiling, smiling up at
him;
And he smiled —that rider grey, for he was no longer
grim;
No dark frown he had for her, in her breast no terrors
stir,
He was heaven’s messenger.


On a Bunch of Primroses and Violets.
Primroses and violets! Sweet'flowers, ye stir my heart.
From out of memory’s storehouse a hundred pictures
start,
O’er which thy fragrance lingers; thy modest blossoms
A wand of magic power, such pleasure ye unfold.
O golden hearts, encircled with creamy petals sweet!
O violets, rich and fragrant! ye are companions meet;
Ye nestle up together so lovingly and fair
Ye breathe to me of love and truth, the love and truth
that’s rare.
The mind goes backward swiftly, across the years it
leaps,
Across the mighty ocean, which ’neath its bosom keeps
Uncounted gems and treasures that cheer no human
eyes.
Nor ever raise a murmur of sweet and glad surprise.
Across the dear home meadow again I seem to tread,
Oak and beech and linden trees are waving overhead;
Grassy turf with buttercups and daisies thickly strewn,
The hedges crowned with hawthorn just budding into
bloom.
Now down the lane I wander with dreamy steps and
slow,
So many hidden treasures are growing here, I trow;
’Mid foliage soft and green that line the hedges high,
Violets blue and primrose pale peep out so sweet and


Lips apart and eager eyed, the lovely blooms to view,
With many exclamations at their soft, tender hue.
Carefully and lovingly I gather them, until
Hands are full, and yet remains abundance of them
O lovely fair-hued flowers, they never tire the eye,
No gayer blossoms tempt us to pass their fragrance by,
We loved them in our childhood, we love them still, and
sing,
The old glad songs of springtime that all through memory
ring.
Love.
God is love. It is a blessed thought,
Upon what other could our weakness lean?
Nor Love remembers not our faults, but strives
To dissipate our fears. The “might have been,”
The thought that preys upon discouraged souls
Is swallowed up and lost in that sweet sense.
Love bears with us in patience, and holds out
The tendest comfort, till our confidence
Is won; and in its strong protecting care
We rest ourselves. Yea, and we truly rest!
For like a wall encircling us around
Love’s strong arms are; our very helplessness
But calling forth more tenderness to bear
With our perversity and foolishness.


Increase Our Faith, O Lord.
Increase our faith, O Lord, and give us larger souls,
Help us grow upward, outward, out of self,
And out of all the bondage self implies.
We talk so much of good and evil, and we fret
O’er this and that, and wear our spirits out
In ceaseless warfare; and we tell ourselves
This is Thy will for us, Thy battles these;
And half the time we’re fighting but to get
Our own perverse and wayward way and will.
Enlarge our vision, Lord, that we may see
The unseen forces working round us day by day.
The inner meaning of the outward forms
Of Thy creations; give us ears to hear
The breathings of Thy spirit everywhere;
The voices of Thy angels sent to us
To help and teach and to inspire in holy things.
Our eyes are fixed so on the visible
And on the forms that perish while we look,
That we forget the larger life behind.
And life to us is set in narrow grooves,
Our ears are tuned to catch but earthly sounds,
The chorus and discords swelling round us, till
The little world about us holds us in
With chains and iron bands: and still we say
This is the will of God, He made it so.
Oh, give ns larger souls, and help us stand
Full fronted towards the truth and heart of things,
Not as we will to see, but as they are.
Thy will to us is all beneficence;
The fret and worry of our daily life
Is grievous to Thy heart; Thy powers, unseen,
But real as things we-see and mightier far,
Works on unceasing for the good of all.


Increase our faith, O Lord, that we may stand
Upright and free from every bond of earth;
Free in the knowledge that Thy Spirit gives.
And rendering Thee the homage of our hearts,
Lift up our eyes towards heaven, walking as
Those walk who know that victory crowns the day
How Good it is Sometimes to be Alone.
How good it is sometimes to be alone,
To think one’s own thoughts out in Quietness;
To realise, perhaps, one’s blessedness
In having such rare moments of our own.
We hear so much and talk so much, the brain
Is worried o’er a hundred needless things; (
The spirit in us lies with drooping wings,
Fretted and chafed beneath the constant strain.
Yea, it is well in some secluded place
To rest awhile, to let one’s spirit flow
Outward and upward, and to gather so
New inward thoughts from the full fount of grace.
To stand alone beneath the quiet sky
And watch the shining of the wond’rous stars,
So high above the world’s nerve-tearing jars,
And shining ever asc the years go by.
To bare one’s head while the soft breezes blow
With soothing coolness o’er its fevered heat;
To feel the growing grass beneath one’s ifeet,
And watch the clouds sail overhead so slow.


With graceful, soothing motion, and no sound;
Oh, it is good sometimes to listen thus
And let the wond’rous silence cover us,
As with a mantle, folding us around.
With a great calm, so that the heart may feel
How near it is to the great heart of Love;
How little earth is to the worlds above
Which the frail walls of time alone conceal.
There is a something in us reaches out
And up, and far beyond what now we see,
A spirit in us beats instinctively
To finer strains than those here round about.
And it is well to turn deaf ears sometimes
To the earth sounds anear us, all so blent
With fretting cries of pain and discontent;
To catch the music of those nobler chimes.
So that the soul within us may maintain
A juster balance ’twixt the small and' great;
And try its wings sometimes the while we wait
The breaking of the bars that doth restrain.


Barbara’s Dream.
From George McDonald’s Book “There and Back.’*
You thought that I was happy,
And loved the glitter of the life I led;
You never saw the hitter tears I shed,
You did not know
The sorrow and the loneliness that lay
Beneath the surface, how that day by day
I wearieu so,
With an heart hunger that no words can tell;
And longed to break the bonds that kept me there
And hatred all the gaieties I seemed to share.
You thought that I was happy,
And day by day my heart more hungry grew
For love, and something more. I never knew
Till then the touch
Of misery with misery, nor thought
The world, with so much wealth and pleasure frovght.
Could hold so much
Of pain and sin and shame: where’er I looked
I saw unhappy people. Rich and poor,
’Twas one great hopeless struggle to endure.
You thought that I was happy,
Because you saw me in the giddy throng;
How can I tell you all the loathing strong
That filled me there;
How all the inane talk and foolish mirth
Was to me only mockery, and dearth,
And worse to bear
Than would have been the poverty and toil
Of humble labour. But I was not free
To follow mine own will. Could you not see?


You grieved that I seemed happy.
I thought not how I seemed, I only know
That all the time ray heart was full of woe;
And every day
I saw bad things, and suffering everywhere,
And longed to help and comfort; and my prayer
The whole dark way
Was, Give me patience, oh my God, and keep
My heart from fainting! Keep Thou hold of me
And let me not, my God, lose sight of Thee!
Oh, love, I was not happy!
The world of fashion round about me seemed
A dreary waste, no light within it gleamed
To gladden me;
The round of balls and dinners filled my heart
With nought but loathing, and I held no part
In revelry:
The girls were silly, and the men inane;
Their mawkish talk was hateful to my ears,
I longed to hide myself. I could but hide my tears.
Dear love, I was not happy!
I thought I never could be glad again,
My heart was so o’ercharged with grief and pain;
And then one morn —
One early morn, too early yet to rise,
I lay awake, all sleep gone from my eyes;
And sorrow worn
I thought of Him—the Man of Sorrows, who
Once trod this earth with gracious purpose, and
Sought out the poor and suffering in the land.
He was with grief acquainted,
And the divine compassion of His heart
Flowed out towards the sorrowful; no part
Of human woe
Was overlooked by Him, and to Him came
The burdened ones in crowds. I breathed His name,


And to and fro
Went o’er those scenes of His brief life on earth,
With quickened sense and thought, while the soft light
Of early morning made my chamber bright.
Dear heart, L was not sleeping!
It was no sleeping dream that came to me,
For I was wide awake as one could be,
With conscious thought,
And no desire for sleep. When lo! I found
A soft white radiance enwrap me round,
But there was nought
To raise the slightest fear; and then mine eyes
Took in a form that stood beside me there
So tall, so grand, my heart slipped off its care.
Oh love, how can I tell you!
My heart slipped off its care the while I leant
Against that form, and a most deep content
Swept over me.
And thrilled me with a sense of such sweet rest
As earth has never dreamt of at its best;
And reverently
Mine eyes took in the details of his dress
The long black robe that clothed him to the feet,
And fell in fine soft folds, full and complete.
Dear heart! how words do fail us
To picture the deep workings of the soul;
They show in part, they cannot tell the whole,
But, dear, I knew
The great and loving Father stood by me;
Within His circling arms confidingly
I nearer drew,
And I was wrapped in love unutterable;
And a deep worship all my being thrilled,
There was no wish within me unfulfilled.


The joy within was deeper
Than could find utterance in words, and I
Breathed but his name “My Father!” in a sigh
Of such content
That His reply “My child!” in whisper low
Told everything my heart desired to know,
And through me sent
So much of happiness that I was still
In sheer delight; and round my shoulders pressed
The sheltering arm that drew me to His breast.
The soft folds of His garment,
So full and fine and lustrous to the sight,
And touched to whiteness in the radiant light,
Around me fell:
It was a part of Him —though but His dress,
To be enfolded thus was blessedness!
No words can tell
The sweet content that held me there so still,
His very robe was fraught with love and grace!
And then I raised my eyes to see His face.
I had not seen how grandly
He rose above me —and beyond his breast
I could not see. But oh, that place of rest
Near to His heart!
And there my face and clasped hands were stayed,
And rested there. And then, dear heart, I made
Amazing part!
A wonderful discovery, I oould see
Into His heart; but no tongue can declare
One half the blessedness mine eyes saw there.
My heart with loving wonder
Was filled to overflowing; and I knew,
Each fibre of my being felt it true,
I was at home.
At home with Him —my Father, and no ill
Could reach me here. And this was His blest will


For all who roam
With aching, longing heart and weary feet,
Earth’s toilsome way. This was home, and lo!
At that bless’d thought my tears began to flow.
Dear love! not tears of sorrow,
But healing happy tears, with nought of pain,
That flowed into God’s heart like gentle rain,
And left no smart;
And a warm light as from a hearth fire shone
With ruddy glow confining walls upon
Within that heart;
And there was room for all the world —and more,
All human hearts that ere an ache has had
Could be enfolded there safe, warm and glad.
Yea, and they were enfolded:
My greatest joy and comfort came from this,
It was the very crowning of my bliss;
More than to be
Myself within the Father’s arms. I then
First knew how mine own heart had ached for them,
How hopelessly!
And here was home and compensation dear
For all the pain and sorrow, here was rest,
And I and they at last supremely blest.
Then gently, oh so gently,
I felt His robe drawn slowly from my grasp,
The arm enfolding me unloosed its clasp,
And my glad tears
Changed into swift entreaty, and I cried
“Oh, Father! Father! let me here abide.”
And my quick fears
Awoke in me the old earth pain once more,
And tears fell from my eyes like blinding rain,
For I was coming back to earth again.


Dear heart, the disappointment!
'Twas like the sudden falling of the night.
That gracious presence vanished from my sight,
I was alone.
And a dull misery took hold of me,
The morning sunshine seemed a mockery;
With piteous moan
I closed mine eyes against it —when there woke
A sudden thought of gladness in my mind
That God had been to me most wond’rous kind.
Then I forgot my sorrow.
That precious vision, was it not mine still?
And God its blessedness would yet fulfill,
I should behold
That gracious one again, and there would be
No coming back to earth. And joyfully
My heart took hold
Of that sweet truth and comfort, and I knew
While life should last, and thought and memory
No earthly grief could take that joy from me.
And, dear love, I arose
With a new feeling born within my heart
Of gladness and of strength, to bear my part
And suffer still,
If that were best for me; and with new love
Take up the burden of my life, and prove
How blest His will;
Serving with quicker hand and readier feet
The hearts around me; serving till He come
And call His children to their Father’s home.

Love, the Conqueror.
Oh, Love came to me in my garden to-day,
He came as one coming to conquer and win;
With head lifted high as a lord’s or a king’s,
And full of assurance his reign to begin;
And I didn’t care for him one little bit!
Oh, I didn’t care for him one little bit!
Yea, Love came to me, but he tarried not long,
He sat himself down on a thorny old vine;
I laughed, and his lordship rose up in a rage,
And went off in a fashion exceedingly tine;
And he left his old bow and arrows behind,
Ah! he left his old bow and arrows behind.
I picked them up carefully, quiver and bow.
Was ever one routed so quickly before!
How swiftly his grandeur was vanquished. Ah me!
I wonder if he will come back any more?
O, fie! Such a temper for Love to display!
Fie, fie! Such a temper for Love to display!
Now Love is unarmed, and I’m glad, I am glad.
Pie, fie! What a temper for Love to display;
And arrows prick deeper than thorns do, I ween;
I wonder if he has been shooting to-day?
If wonder if I could shoot straight if I tried?
If wonder if I could shoot straight if I tried?
And how will he get his fine weapons again,
Love the great conqueror? Alas, now ’tis woe!
These arrows are sharp. I have wounded myself,
And Love is revenged, if he only could know.
Who now is the victor? Alas, foolish me!
Who now is the victor? Alas, foolish me!


Betty Shews.
Betty was tail, and exceedingly thin,
With a wrinkled face and a pointed chin,
And a sharp, aggressive nose;
Her eyes were grey, and her sight was good;
Upright and firm on her feet she stood,
In spite of the winter’s snows;
And her voice rang shrill through the streets of the town
As she peddled her diamonds up and down:
Cooal! Cooal! Cooal!
Oal nub an’ no smoal.
Ef you doant maake haaste I shall sell oal
Cooal! Cooal! Cooal!
A quaint old figure, for fashion and style.
Her dress was a study; not once in a while,
But always, the whole year through.
A wide brimmed hat with a low broad crown,
The brim was limp, and flapped up and down,
Its colour had once been blue;
But it served its purpose, for sunshine or rain,
As Betty sang shrilly her quaint refrain,
Cooal! Cooal! Cooal! etc.
A short woolsey skirt, and a man’s old coat,
Buttoned close up from the hem to the throat;
A fellow ’twere hard to find.
And when from the east the winds blew cold,
A long red scarf ’round her neck she woul dfold.
Crossed over, and tied behind;
While black worsted stockings and wooden soled shoes
Completed the picture of old Betty Skews.
Cooal! Cooal! Cooal! etc.


The summers went by, and the winters came,
But Betty was there, and was always the same,
And always the same old cry.
She earned her living by selling coal;
With her donkey and cart the queer old soul
Called on the people to buy.
She never grew older, or so it appeared,
And no sort of weather whatever she feared
Cooal! Cooal! Cooal! etc.
She lived by herself, ’twas very well known,
She wanted no company hut her own;
And brave the neighbour who dared
To enter her house on gossip bent,
She would surely rue her kind intent;
The children no better fared.
“I hev cooal to sell, ef you want to buy,
An’ if you doant, be off with ee spry!”
Cooal! Cooal! Cooal! etc.
Friendship
My friend. It is a title dear,
No soul is lonely that can say
It has a friend, who, far or near,
Can be depended on alway.
One dear, fond heart that heateth true,
In shade or sunshine changing not;
Who loves us all the long years through,
And through all changes in our lot.


Who, with our weakness and our faults,
And our perverse or changing moods
In kindness bears with us, nor halts,
Nor o’er misunderstanding broods.
Who- knows us as we also know
The heart to which we turn, who gives
Us trust for trust. Ah! this I trow,
Is that true friendship which outlives
The world’s calamities and pains,
That oftentimes around us close,
And binds us down as ’twere with chains,
When all the world seems fulls of woes.
In all the plan of nature, grand,
And great and beautiful tho’ ’tis,
There’s nothing makes us understand
The meaning of a love like this.
’Tis a God-given gift, a piece
Of heaven’s gold; nor years, nor ought
That happens can its worth decrease,
In God’s own likeness it is wrought.
Friend of my heart! Oh, title sweet!
What matters it if for a time
We tread earth’s paths with tired feet,
And listen to her mournful chimes?
There is a sunbeam shining bright,
There is a sweetness through it all,
That o’er our spirit’s darkness light,
And right across our pathway fall.
And we are walking not alone,
E’en when we tread the paths of pain,
While there’s a heart beats to our own
That we reach out to, not in vain.


Christmas Night (in Australia).
'Twas Christmas night, and sultry as a Christmas night
could be.
And the stars were blinking dimly through the hazy
upper sea
A light warm wind was playing ’mid the branches of
the trees
With scarcely power to stir the ’twas such a lazy
breeze;
And little wonder was it it had spent its strength at
last,
It had blown all day like fury with terrific boom and
blast;
Had swept and whirl’d and blustered in a frenzy of
delight
Through all the streets and roadways, working havoc
left and right.
With all that it could scatter, or lift or rend or roll;
And the dust it raised! Words fail us. A wind storm
has no soul;
No feelings to be harrowed, no nerves to be unstrung,
No eyes to look compassion, so we’ll leave its work
unsung.
But you’ll understand the reason why so much of dust
and sand
Was mingled with the Christmas cheer with such
bounteous hand,
And you’ll understand ’twas not for want of toil and
pains and care
That such a lack of tidiness was apparent everywhere;
And you’ll comprehend the feelings of relief and thank-
fulness
That filled each human breast that night in spite of
sultriness. I


So the stars were blinking dimly in the hazy upper sea,
And the air was calm, though gritty as the city air
could be,
And the peace that reigned was soothing to the tired
soul of man
Who came out from his stuffy house the night serene
to scan.
The soul of men is hopeful—that is, in a general way ;
It chafes beneath the tempest, and fights madly in the
fray,
But when the storm is over it grows serene again;
There is no use in fretting, or in keeping up the strain.
So the soul of man was hopeful on this sultry Christmas
night,
And the soul of woman also, if it was not quite so
bright;
For it falleth unto woman when the storm its work has
done,
And made a wreck of all things, that her work has just
begun.
But on Christmas night who troubles over duststorms of
the day,
When the sun has gone down redly and the wind has
died away,
When the windows may be lifted and doors thrown open
wide,
And stifling, hot humanity, can breathe the air outside.
And so the wind blew lightly, with a soft caressing air,
And fanned the damp hot faces that it met with every-
where.
And stirr’d the leaves so gently, and so friendly tried
to be
That outraged nerves were comforted, and hearts in
charity.
Now the quietness was broken, as one wandered to and
fro,


By the sound of happy laughter from beneath verandahs
low;
By the music of young voices as they chattered blithe
and gay.
Or trilled quaint Christmas carols or some sweet old-
fashioned lay;
And here and there were mingled from some ample
rocking chair,
The qquavering tones of elders, in the well remembered
And there floated scraps of converse carried on in voices
low,
By the pairs of cooing lovers, in whose happy bosoms
glow.
All the glamour of the season, all the sentiment so dear,
That gathers round at Christmas tide, the love time of
the year.
The children called for stories as they sat at Granny’s
feet,
The coaxing tones insistent, and to make their joy com-
plete
The dear old grandames could not help but tell the tales
once more,
The oft told Christmas stories of the festive times of
yore.
The times that they remembered, and what Christmas
used to be,
So beautiful! so wonderful! so joyful! Oh, dear me!
I wonder if to old folks come their childhood’s gifts
again,
As a sort of compensation, in a kind of memory train,
All magnified and glorified, as children’s fancies are,
When they look through rosy spectacles from childhood’s
jaunting car;
With the only difference ’twixt them that the children’s
fancies lie
In the happy, golden future they’ll be reaching by and
by, e


While the old folks looking backward through the mists
of many years,
With their trials and their changes, their laughter and
their tears,
Through those same old rosy glasses, linked hand in
hand again
With dear delusive fancy who has tripped aboard the
train,
See the past in colours golden, hear its echoes soft and
low;
So they tell those wond’rous stories of those days of long
ago;
They repeat the sweet old stories they had told so oft
before,
And the children pressed around them, and the cry was
still for more.
And the dear old eyes looked fondly on the faces round
their knees,
With a tender throb of pleasure that they still had
power to please,
And the peacefulness of night time settled down upon
them there,
With the shadows gathering ’round them in the warm
and sultry air;
And the wind so softly blowing, hither, whither, on its
way,
Seemed to breathe a benediction on the closing of the


Love and Duty.
Love, dear love, and must we say farewell?
Oh, sad words! to dear ones like a knell;
Lips say yes, but hearts say no,
Love and duty clashes, but I must go.
Chorus—
Farewell, little one. Love is strong,
Leaps over distance, stays not long,
Sorrow and joy comes unto all,
Love must wait contented when duty call.
Love, dear love, you would not have me stay.
Tell-tale eyes—l know what they would say;
Heart says yes, but lips say no.
Love must bow to duty. Say—dear love go.
Chorus —
Farewell, darling, and be not sad,
Love laughs at distance, love is glad;
Sorrow and joy comes unto all.
True love is contented when duty call.
Thoughts.
Great thoughts move slowly in the minds of men
Great issues on them wait,
But whether they are more momentous than the small
Who can determinate?
The little thought, the little thread of thought
That weaves itself throughout our daily life,
Mixed up with humblest of our occupations and
Vibrating with the strife;


Deciding little questions hour by hour,
In hourly action shown;
Making the life and character of man,
Marking e’en look and tone;
This seems to be the mightiest factor in
This throbbing world of ours
Those little thoughts pushing their slender tendrils out
Are fraught with potent powers.
While men are pondering over questions great
With anxious eager minds,
The little ones are working out the weal or woe
Of life’s bewildering lines.
The great thoughts may, and very often do
Pass grandly overhead,
But these within the very heart take root
And by them men are led;
From soul to soul they pass and entertwine,
With constant throb and thrill;
By these the living, struggling world is moved,
As by a mighty will.
And wherefore then! Should great thoughts be decried?
Ah, no! but we should see,
That every little thought moving within,
And from thence outwardly,
Is pure and true. We are not blind, nor dumb,
Nor helpless creatures in the hands of fate;
We may resist the hurtful, choose the right,
And round our lives create
An atmosphere of purity and truth
Expanding hour by hour,
Of common everyday small acts made up,
Unmeasured in its power.

A Storm at Sea.
The vessel labours along
Through the angry swollen sea,
While the storm fiend claps his hands
And madly shouts in his glee;
The raging winds and the waves
Terrifically struggle and fight,
And the white spray leaps aloft
Like clouds of snow in the night.
Right in the teeth of the storm,
With purpose steady and true,
The vessel braves the danger,
And struggles the darkness through;
Like a living thing, she fights
Through the awful, awful din;
The shriek and roar of the wind,
The creaking and groaning within.
With thunder like boom, the waves
Come crashing against her sides,
Till she quivers from stem to stern
From the fierce, conflicting tides;
And holds her breath, as it were,
As tho’ it were death if she breathed,
Then recovers, and dashes on
Like one for awhile reprieved.
Passengers crouch in their cabins,
With faces pallid with fear;
Men and women and children,
Bewildered at death so near;
Cries of terror rise upward,
And lips unused to the task
Beseech Almighty protection,
And for speedy succour ask.
Up and down, to and fro she reels;
Now caught on the crest of a wave,
Borne up to a terrible height
As tho’ snatched out of a grave;


The chasm like horror of which
Yawns all around her so deep;
Then down with a crash she is plunged,
Down the precipitous steep.
She’s rocked like a cradle, tho’ fierce,
And rough is the hand that rocks;
She’s blown like a feather is blown
By the wind that frantically mocks.
Hither and thither she sways,
And seemingly struggles in vain;
Yet frees herself with a gasp,
And rights again and again.
But hark! there’s a cheery ring
In the sound of the captain’s voice;
An answering shout from the crew
Sounding clear above the noise,
“The worst of the danger is past.”
And the brave hearts lighter grow
As they shout the joyful news
To the trembling ones below.
“She has weathered the storm!” they cry,
“Tho’ quivering yet from the fright,
Come right through the shadow of death
With her engine and gear all right!”
And the passengers weep for joy,
As before they wept for fear;
And thoughts leap forward to home
And its rest, and those so dear.
And some who prayed for succour,
To render their thanks forget;
And some in their hearts are praying
Almighty protection yet,
From the hand of Him who heard them,
From the friend so strong and true,
Who out of the shadow of death
So lately has brought them through.


A Whimsey.
What do you say, my hands are getting wrinkled?
Alas! And see the veins how plain they show;
A sign of age, dear heart, Old Time plods onward,
His grip in passing leaves them wrinkled so.
Poor wrinkled hands. And they are not so shapely
As once they were when first you held them fast,
Nor yet so fine; the joints have grown unduly;
Long years of toil have left their marks at last.
No longer soft or white, and on this finger,
The ring sits loosely, O dear heart, r tis true,
My hands are growing old and plainly show it;
But they’ve been useful hands to me, and you.
And they’ve been willing hands, nor left unfinished
Whate’er they should, and could, do for your sake;
O love, they have been kind hands you must witness,
And ne’er refused their share of work to take.
This tongue has said contrary things, but never
Have these hands wrought discomfort wilfully;
Dear, you may smile. Tongues are unruly members,
And break defiant o’er all rules that be.
But, O dear heart, the tongue is no true witness,
It grows not old nor wrinkled, nor dismayed;
We’ll put it out of court as of no moment,
There are too many counts against it laid.
But hands obey the heart, and that is different,
While tongues go all ways but the way they ought;
And, love, your tongue and mine are no exceptions,
Contrary as the winds they oft have fought.
Your tongue and mine, dear. I will not unsay it,
They both have been unruly, let them be;
They have not to the heart borne faithful witness,
So shall they not be judge ’twixt you and nu,.


A Sunset Picture.
There is a picture I would paint,
’Tis stamped in memory,
And passing through life’s busy scenes
It oft comes back to me.
A summer evening, calm and still,
A landscape wond’rous fair
Of hill and pasture land and bush;
And just beyond, a mountain ridge
Rugged and steep and bare.
One little dwelling, rudely built,
But the unshapely lines
Of rough hewn slabs all beautified
thickly clustering vines.
A garden, fenced with post and rails,
But planned and kept with care;
And gay with many lovely flowers.
And sweet with many a scented herb.
Perfuming all the air.
The western sky as red as blood.
A flood of red gold light
Tipping each drifting filmy cloud
With shim’ring glory bright.
The tall tree tops are crimsoned o’er,
And bush and hill and plain
n \
Seem clothed in blossoms ruddy red;
All earth is blushing with the glow
A wond’rous glorious stain.


And just beside the sliprail stands
A woman, worn and old;
It is that woman’s face I see
Framed in with red and gold.
A hungry soul, a spirit grieved,
A heart unsatisfied
Looks out from those sad eyes of hers;
A solitary watcher she
Of that great crimson tide.
Out towards the glowing western sky,
As though the mystery there
Touches deep chords within her breast,
And lays her spirit bare.
The crimson glory changes, and
Flash forth long rays of light,
Like rosy pennons floating out;
And a new country seem to rise
Distinct, and wond’rous bright.
Broad shining lakes of palest green
Fringed with a golden shore;
And a great mountain far beyond,
It’s top all purpled o’er.
Wide stretches as of meadow land
And clumps of noble trees,
Placed here and there so orderly;
And one can almost see them sway
As with a passing breeze.
Then gradually the colours change
And softer, paler grow,
Save that the lakes form one big sea
And like a fire glow.


The gum trees now appear to be •
Gold wattles all abloom,
The mountain ridge is gilded o’er;
The scrubby patches on the hill
Turned into yel'ow broom.
Tis such a sight as moves the soul
And stirs its depths, to feel
Something of that which lies beyond,
And earth cannot reveal.
And the lone woman standing there,
Silent, and sad and still
Watching the colours die away,
And all the lovely tints fade out
From tree tops, plain and hill.
Watching until the twilight falls
Upon the landscape fair,
And round the hills the shadows creep,
And up the mountain bare.
What are her thoughts? What visions rise
From out the western sky?
What wrought that patience and that pain?
What is the story of her life,
Where do the records lie?
They lie in lonely women’s hearts
Graved with an iron pen;
And guarded there with painful care
Lest careless eyes should ken.
Fair tender dreams of life and love.
All blurred with bitter tears',
Dear, sacred hopes all unfulfilled;
And no one heart to comprehend
Throughout the dreary years.


The Boy Cadets of Australia.
The boys of Australia, God bless them;
Sturdily marching they come
From city and township and hamlet
At the call of the bugle and drum.
There’s the fire of earnest purpose in their eyes,
And the courage of endurance in them lies;
It is work with them, not play,
And they’re growing every day,
They’ll soon be the men of Australia,
The boys of Australia, God bless them!
Steadily marching along,
With step just as true as their seniors,
And with plenty of time to grow strong.
There’s the spring of youthful energy at drill,
And enthusiastic readiness of will;
They are soldiers every inch,
And from duty will not flinch.
The young Cadet Corps of Australia.
The boys of Australia, God bless them!
Cheerily tramping they come,
From city and township and hamlet
At the call of the bugle and drum.
There’s the spirit of a patriot in each breast,
And the love of home and country all express’d
In the lifting of the head
And the firm and manly tread,
A cheer for the boys of Australia.


Restored—A True Incident.
The speaker was dead in earnest,
His words were thrilling and true
As he told of the evils so dire
Wrought out by the drink. He knew
No words could picture the misery,
No tongue could number the crimes
It caused in the world; and they knew it
Howe’er they ignored it at times.
Just then there stood in the doorway
A creature, a man, I might say.
If an object so wretched and fearful
Could be termed so, for looks of dismay
Were plainly discerned on the faces
Of those who were present, and fear
Lest that loathsome object should touch them,
Or seek for a seat too near.
He was loathsome, filthy, and ragged.
As low as a man could be;
And fierce, and defiant, and scowling,,
Yet, a pitiful sight to see.
He stood for a moment, doubting,
Then swift to the front he went,
And on pen, and ink, and pledge book
His bloodshot eyes were bent.
Ere a word to him was spoken
He seized on the pen and signed,
Then dropped on the seat that was nearest,
With a fierce, dark look behind.
The lecturer paused for a moment,
And a gentleman standing by
In a whisper said “He is dangerous,


A dreadful character. I
Fear he is up to mischief.
Be careful, sir, say not a word
Directly to him. I know him.”
But the heart of the lecturer was stirr’d.
He must say a word to that creature,
And give him a lift if he can;
In spite of the word of warning
He stepped to the side of the man.
“I am glad to see you,” he said.
“I welcome you here, my friend,
I am glad you have signed the pledge ,
And want your life to amend.”
The man looked up at him fiercely,
And motioned him roughly away,
Looking as savage and dangerous
As a wild beast brought at bav.
Refusing a word of kindness,
Disdaining the chance of a hope:
The man was fighting a battle,
And the fiends had plenty of scope.
He would not answer a question,
In a savage and dogged tone
He muttered “Who cares for me?
I won’t speak, leave me alone!
Leave me alone!” he said hoarsely,
In fierce defiant strain,
Raising his hand to strike,
But letting it drop again.
Then the speaker went back to his subject,
So suddenly dropped, and his tone
Thrilled with a deeper feeling
Over sorrows not his own.


And the gentleman watched the creature.
In fear of a sudden attack,
And the people’s distracted attention
Was hard to the theme to bring back.
Then, just ere the speaker had finished,
Before the dismissal was said,
With a scowl at the watching faces,
And a savage toss of his head,
The man rose up, and swiftly
Passed out from the hall again;
While the people shrank back at the doorway,
And scarce from a cry could refrain,
So threatening was his aspect,
So fearful the look on his face;
A face that was hardly human,
So lost was all manhood’s trace.
Pale were the faces around him,
As the lecturer pleaded and prayed
For help for the strange, wild creature;
The bravest there were afraid.
Not even the police would touch him,
So dreadful a character he;
“Then,” said the lecturer, firmly,
“Point out where he lives, to me.
Alone I will seek him, God willing
This soul shall be saved if it can;
I could never more rest if I left him;
He bears yet the soul of a man.”
But one friend mustered the courage,
Tho’ fearful, and trembling, and white,
To seek out through back ways and alleys
The man all thought of with fright.
And they found him, the poor broken creature!
For broken indeed was he,
Defiant no longer, nor savage,
But sullen with misery.


Did they succeed in their mission?
Oh, yes; but a terrible time
They had ere they raised in that bosom
A spark of that hope divine;
The hope that should give to the spirit
A something to strive for, a gleam
Of a mightier strength than a human;
For it was like an impossible dream.
To this wild creature that ever
He should rise out of the slough;
But the arrow of God had struck him.
And a way of escape he saw.
He was saved? Oh, yes: and the wonder
Was great at the wonderful change.
The change that the townsfolk looked on;
They had never seen one so strange,
Tho’ whether the man’s own wonder
Was not the greatest, when he
Beheld himself, is a question;
’Twas a sight for the angels to see,
To see and rejoice over, truly.
Oh, great is the power of God;
The power, the love, and the mercy
To those who dark pathways have trod.
Oh: let us have faith, hope, and courage
And the love that beats back despair;
Let us ever remember the lost ones,
And help them at least by our prayer.
We know not what chance may befall us
To help some poor lost one to find
The way back to God and to manhood,
Or to womanhood, gracious and kind.


A Dark View.
Poor soul! And hast thou not with that fair view
Of setting sun, and glitt’ring crimsoned bay.
Whose murm’ring waters softly sing to thee
Of setting day;
No deep heart throb, no sweet up-lifting thought
That, o’er the sea, where shadows gather fast
For, far beyond, there breaks another day,
True as the past?
Doth it not tell thee, too, of something else:
When the last gleam has faded from the sky
How it will still float on, and murmur still,
Nor quiet lie?
Doth it not tell thee that the soul, alive,
And true to nature and itseif, can ne’er
Look calmly o’er a great and unknown sea
Without a fear?
That as the waters day and night flow on,
So shall the soul live on nor have an end?
The verge of life is but when night and morn
Doth touch, then blend.
Doth it not sing a better hope to thee
Than night ahead? Morn breaketh o’er the bay;
And so life’s night may pass, yet o’er it break
A glorious day.
There is beyond the gloom a shining light,
A brighter day than any earth e’er knew
And through life’s wear and toil the soul may have
That light in view.
Oh, sad indeed! if thou but only
The fair, fair landscape fading, and the light
Die out in hopeless darkness, and before
Nothing but night.


Fellow Pilgrims.
My little fellow Pilgrim to Zion’s city fair,
How good it is to travel day by day
Like comrades true and loving towards our Father's home,
To cheer and help each other by the way.
We read of faithful Christian, and follow in his steps,
We understand the trials that he had;
We have our trials also, the lions by the way,
And sometimes we are fearful too, and sad.
But we have Mr. Greatheart to answer to our call,
The King has sent him forth to be our guide;
And tho’ we cannot see him, as Christiana did,
Invisible, he walketh by our side.
We’ve passed by many dangers, we did not see them all,
The King has many watchmen on the road;
Set there, my little comrade, to warn the pilgrims when
They’re coming near the enemy’s abode.
So pilgrims may walk safely along the King’s highway,
If keeping on the path the King has made;
’Tis v/hen we wander off it and seek an easier way,
We find ourselves in danger, and afraid.
OUcourse, my little comrade, like Christian we shall find
Companions by the way to work us ill,
If we choose to stop and heed them, for Beelzebub’s alive,
And working hard to frighten pilgrims still.
“Talkatives,” and “Hypocrites,” and “Hold-the-worlds,”
there are,
And “Demases” and “Byends,” and their kind,
And they are still pretending they serve our Lord, the
King,
But they’re not going Zionward we’ll find.


And so we will not heed them, they are not pilgrims true,
We will not risk the sharing of their fate;
They cannot show their passport, we know them by that
sign,
They did not enter by the wicket gate
They’re sure to try to stop us and put us off the track,
That is their master’s business, comrade dear;
But we must be determined, we have our orders plain,
And our directions written full and clear.
We will not b© discouraged, whatever others say,
We know we can get safely home at last;
And if we do meet lions and giants, and the like
Why, so have many others in the past.
The lions cannot hurt us, the Lord has chained them up.
The giants can do nothing worse than roar;
If we follow Mr. Greatheart, keeping close to him,
There’s our Father’s own House Beautiful, before.
And we shall surely reach it, my little comrade dear,
And Zion’s city fair our eyes shall see;
And we shall get a welcome, such a one as Christian had,
We shall surely get a welcome, you and me.
But, Comrade, you remember, when pilgrims crossed the
stream,
They mostly had to cross it one by one;
So must we be ready, any day the post may come,
And one of us be sent for, little son.
The shining track to heaven, that only earth clouds hide,
The road by which the angels come and go,
Is full of busy traffic, the messengers of God;
From Him to us they travel to and fro.


Sweet thought! My little Pilgrim, it is no lonely way,
which our soul mounts up to Zion’s gate;
But crowds of happy spirits are passing every day,
And bands of holy angels on them wd'it.
And sweeter still the thought is: how great our Father’s
love.
How tender all His care for you and me;
Praise Him, little comrade; we shall see Him by and by,
And dwell with Him through all eterifity.
Mother.
Dear name, dear face, dear heart, Mother!
All thoughts beautiful are summ’d up in thee;
Through all the years from infancy to age
Thine eyes beam on us, there is no other
Holds such a place as thou; and memory
Is fragrant with thy free, unstinted love.
Unselfish love! almost from earth taint free;
ino cloud, no waywardness, no sudden bllgnt
Dims its clear shining. Like to God’s above,
It broodeth o’er us. Yea, ’tis heavenly.
With a quick understanding that we feel.
Dear mother, at thy side again we kneel
And lay our weary head against thy breast;
Earth has for us no truer resting place.


On the New Year.
The years are passing, swiftly passing away,
And we count and count and count from day to day.
And never a one comes back, or its flight delay.
And would we have them stay? From our little stand
That we call to-day we look out o’er the land
’Tween those two monstrous seas on either hand,
Yesterday and to-morrow. The one we’ve crossed
Would we cross back again for all we’ve lost,
To risk once more on its stormy waves being toss’d?
We have come through, and stand on the only spot
That we can say is safe —or ours. Would we not
Give much to-day if some of the past could be forgot?
Wistfully we look back, for alack! alack!
We can ne’er again retrace the last year’s track.
Rebuild, or bury, or bring our lost chances back.
What we have wrought we have wrought, and it remains
Stamped on the years that are gone with all its stains,
For its own peculiar record each year retains.
And we look back o’er the past regretfully.
Blunders, mistakes, and failures we plainly see,
And the good we have tried to do marr’d woefully.
What then! Shall we despair, and bow down the head,
And weep and moan o’er the passing year? I’ve read
That the past may be to us as though it were dead.
That may be so. But then should memory die,
And sweet as well as bitter in her arms lie;
That were a change methink that would not satisfy.


What then? Shall we greet the new year tearfully
Hugging past failures to us, and fearfully
Cross to the dim to-morrow, dreading what shall be?
Nay. Let mem’ry live with her bitter and sweet.
And let us with hopeful hearts the new year greet,
Yea, stooping with hearty gladness to kiss his feet.
For is there not a flash of light in his eyes,
A flush of joy on his brow that seems to rise
With the ring of hope in his voice, and glad surprise?
And is there not a spring in his step, the while
He spreads his clean white pages out, with a smile,
Bidding us write thereon? Oh, rare sweet guile!
Oh, welcome the glad new year, for it may be
The best of all the years to you and to me,
And in the past we shall a time of discipline see.
With no upbraiding look doth he take his place;
He comes to us with a smile upon his face.
And in his hands a store of unused grace
A golden gift he offers, the gift of time;
Let us take heart and be glad, we yet may climb
To the height of our best desires. Oh then the chime
Of gladness will ring out, and there will be
A song of joy on our lips, and we shall see
The efforts of our lives crowned gloriously!


There is No Baim Like
Kindness.
When hearts are hot and restless
And spirits drooping low,
And feet and head are weary
With hurrying to and fro;
When life looks hard and dreary
And hardly worth the strain,
What is it most that helps us,
And make us smile again?
’Tis looks of loving kindness,
Like sunshine warm and clear;
The clasp of hands in friendship,
And words of gentle cheer;
These break across our pathway
And pierce the shadows through,
And bring to light fresh blossoms
To cheer the heart anew.
Oh, life has many flowers
Beneath the shadows grey,
It only needs the sunshine
To clear the gloom away;
The pleasant smile and greeting,
Small acts of courtesy
Are very sunbeams, piercing
Life’s gloomy density.
There is no balm like kindness,
There is no rest like love;
There is a kind of blindness
Born straight from heaven above;
The blindness that would cover
The blemish of a soul,
To help it to recover
And come forth sweet and whole.


On the Death of Queen Victoria.
O Queen beloved; gone to thy rest at last!
Through all the splendour of a glorious reign,
Thou hast kept hold upon thy people’s hearts,
And now they mourn thy death with grief sincere,
And heartfelt pain.
The nation mourns. A wave of sorrow breaks
In one spontaneous thrill from shore to shore;
Throughout thy whole dominions —everywhere
Where e’er thy people are, the shadow falls
As ne’er before.
So proud, O Queen, they have been of thy fame,
And all the greatness of thy throne and state;
Proud of those qualities that marked thee, Queen,
And made thee honoured by the nations ’round,
Both small and great.
Yet, not because they knew thee great and wise,
Dowered with the gift to rule —and to obey.
Art thou enshrined within their loyal hearts,
And loved as never monarch was before
Until thy day.
It is because behind the Queen, yea high
Above the Queen, the woman pure and true.
With all the gentle attributes we love
Shed lustre o’er her long and glorious reign
Her whole life through.
It is because that ye were good, O Queen,
And upheld goodness as the first and best;
Ye held before your people high ideals,
And strove yourself to reach them, seeking not,
Nor ease or rest.


Because, O Queen, ye ever scorned the shams,
And counted nothing mean if it were right;
And held your people dear, and sought their good,
And as the humblest in thy realm, knelt down
In God’s dear sight.
Ye stood not by as one too high to note
The widow’s tears and helpless orphan’s cry;
Ye cherished feelings womanly and soft,
Wept with your people in their sorrows, and
To them drew nigh.
Yea, gentle Queen, and they, too, wept with thee,
When thou wert pressed by sorrow, heart to heart
With thee in loyal sympathy they bowed,
And wrapped thee ’round with love and prayers and
Thy grief held part.
And so it is they sorrow at thy death,
And feel it is to them a personal loss,
And tender thoughts rise up like incense rare,
For love and sorrow levels all, and leaps
All gulfs across.
And yet, O Queen, yet are thy people glad,
Thus sorrow hath its compensations sweet,
That softly, tenderly the angel came
To loose the silver cord and set thee free
To life complete.
O Queen beloved! It was a fitting close,
A gentle ending to a gracious life;
Surrounded by thy loved ones, passing out
Into that larger, better world, far hence
From pain and strife.


The Poets and the Editors.
“Not another line,” they said, “not another line!”
“We’ll starve those plaguey poets out,
We’ll send them to the right about/”
And lo! those foolish editors together did combine.
Of course, they did not mean it quite, not all they said.
For poetry they’d still expect,
From which the choicest to select
For their “excellent publications,” so very widely read.
But the spirit of the muse was abroad that day,
On her usual mission bent;
And to her children’s great content
Dropping roses and posies, fire and frenzy in their way.
She heard that silly dec'aration, and she stayed
In thoughtful silence for a while,
Then o’er her face there crept a smile.
To those waste-paper-basket-presidents a bow she made.
“Not another line,” they said, “not another line!
We’ll go and rest our sacred heads
In fragrant dells on mossy beds,
And save our postage stamps, and live on fancy, bliss, and
wine.”
And so they did, and their manuscripts came no more;
And those editors laughed and joked,
And much fun at each other poked,
With baskets at their sides more capacious than ever
before.


But never a poem came; no, never a one!
And a look of mildest surprise
Crept presently into their eyes,
For every piece they sought to select had “copyright”
printed on.
Plenty of copy came. Quite, yea, more than enough
To fill every inch of their space.
But there was not the faintest trace
Of poesy ’mongst it all, not even a doggerel rough.
“Not a line,” they said. They scanned each manuscript
through;
No poetry now ever came,
Every day it was the same,
And at last they grew alarmed, did not know whatever
to do.
Their eyes grew heavy and dull, and their hearts were sad.
’Twas as though the sun had gone down
And had left but the clouds to frown
On the editorial chair; and nothing could make them glad.
Despair tugged hard at their hearts; they were nearly
wild.
It was prose from morning till night,
They were sick of the very sight;
At the richest joke of the season they couldn’t have
smiled.
And their “excellent publications,” sad to tell,
Grew as heavy and dull as they;
And they had to give them away
In sheer desperation at last, for never a one would sell.


Ruin stared them in the face. What was to he done?
Then came like a flash the bright thought,
And eagerly at it they caught;
“We’ll be poets ourselves,” they said; “Hurrah! the battle
is won.”
Then off to their sanctums they flew like birds on the
wing;
The office boys thought they were mad,
Such a deal Of trouble they had
In getting their proper directions, what to do or to bring.
Scratch, scratch went pencil and pen, by day and by night,
Heads ached with acutest of pain.
Pearly drops rolled off them like rain;
And the basket grew bulky once more; but alas! for the
sight.
The poetry would not come, neither blank or rhyme;
With what infinite pains they toiled,
And whole reams of paper they spoiled,
And their eyesight and tempers as well. ’Twas a terrible
time.
“Sweet spirit of the Muse, art dead?” they sadly cried;
“Com e forth and help us, gentle Muse!”
But if she heard she did not choose.
For she neither came or sent, and those editors nearly
died.
Then the papers were edged with black, the people
mourned.
A gloom over the land was spread.
Woe! Woe! all the poets are dead.
And bitter, remorseful tears were shed for the slandered
and scorned.


This was more than the poets could bear, so they said:
“Come, let us forget our wrongs,
And continue to sing our songs;
Let us forth to the world again and show it we are not
dead.”
Songs and sonnets and odes! They turned them o’er and
o’er.
Were they dreaming? Could it be true?
They shock with emotion right through,
Then sobbed aloud in their joy, “There is poetry come once
more!”
Then those editors, to a man, agreed that they
Never more would slight and abuse
Those gentle children of the Muse,
But would love and cherish and help them for ever and a
day. 1
Baby.
All unconscious in my arms you lie,
And I watch o’er thee with a tender care,
And thoughts flit through my mind like winged sprites
Touching thee, my baby, sweet and fair.
I thought this heart was big with love before,
But it grows bigger as I look at you,
For a new mine of love has opened up
With costly treasure all exposed to view


And I may gather it, O baby mine,
For it is all my own, tho’ hid before;
And life is calling with a deeper tone,
And my heart grows and reaoheth out for more.
My soul loves music; often have I felt
Its power to move; but here’s a power new,
Than music sweeter. Baby, baby mine,
Your soft sweet “coo” thrills all my being through.
I loved the flowers, dear, and all things fair,
All things young came very near my heart;
Now they more beautiful than ever are
Because of you they seem to be a part.
I used to think that I was strong to bear,
But now there is a greater force within,
And I would fight as do the savages
For you—-at need. Ah, baby, is that sin?
So helplessly you lie against my breast,
You have no faintest glimmer of a thought;
But there’s a sceptre in those dimpled hands.
Your subjects render homage all unsought.
O, baby mine, so small and helpless now,
What has the future in its bosom stored;
What lies along the path these feet must tread,
Will there be waters deep for them to ford?
But fears away! grim shadows shall not touch
The airy castles that fond fancy builds;
Dear hope shall crown —and time their height shall prove,
And for their fashion —what the good Lord wills.

When is Life Most Beautiful.
True life is always beautiful,
And pleasing ’tis to see
The rosy light and happy days
Of tender infancy;
The patt’ring .feet, the prattling tongue,
The rounded dimpled cheeks,
The sparkling eyes and dawning mind
That love and sunshine seeks.
And life is very bright and fair,
And makes one smile to see
Boyhood and girlhood looking out
With spirits glad and free;
All objects easy to attain,
The distant and the high,
When they shall up life’s ladder climb
In that vague by and bye.
And life assumes a tender hue,
Which make us smile and sigh,
The hopeful, eager flush and glow
When youth their wings doth try;
The confidence just tinged with fear,
The visions, oh so bright!
That float before them, beckoning
With shifting, shimm’ring light.
And life becomes so grand a thing
That we both laugh and weep,
And deepest feelings wake and stir
And through our being creep.
They move us with the noblest thoughts
That ere our bosoms thrilled;
Oh, life of man and womanhood,
In life’s true meaning drilled!


The dreaming time has passed away,
The working time is now;
The feet are climbing up the steeps,
And care is on the brow;
But in the heart are noble thoughts.
And joy is in the soul;
False hopes are gone, the true remains,
Definite is the goal.
Oh, infant life is beautiful!
And tenderly we smile,
Tho’ shielding with the closest care
The fragile buds the while.
Boyhood and girlhood make us glad
With their bright life and tone,
And healthful, breezy restlessness
That trouble will not own.
And youth and maidenhood are fair,
So fair, we sigh to think
How will the tender tints pass off
When they shall deeper drink;
How will the bright eyes wistfully
Look after vanished dreams,
And sadly find that fairy lakes
Are swiftly flowing streams.
The noblest time of life, perhaps,
Is that when every day
The soul is tried and bravely meets
The roughness of the way.
The working and the bearing time,
When heart and hands are full
Manhood and womanhood is grand,
And great, and beautiful!


But when is life most beautiful?
Is it at eventime,
The hardships and the battles o’er,
And no more hills to climb;
The joy of life’s brief day well spent,
And duties nobly done,
Throwing a radiance o’er the scene
Like to the setting sun?
For is not this the setting time,
When sunset glows around,
And night descending wakes no fears,
And fairest hopes abound;
When quietly and peacefully
The spirit, outward borne.
The growing power doth feel, and waits
The breaking of the morn.
Waiting.
The hours wear on, he has not kept his word;
Maybe he never meant to, or too strong
His enemy has proven for his will;
O, Heavenly Father! will this life last long?
How much more anguish will it take to kill?
The step I listen for each night I dread.
My heart is sick, and faint my spirit grows;
The hours are filled with sorrow and with fear,
A drunkard’s heart no love or pity knows,
Nothing on earth but drink to him is dear.


Oh, hush! my little baby, do not fret,
Lest when thy father comes it angers him;
Sleep quietly, my darling, do not move
Lest in his heart should rise the dragon grim,
And he should turn on thee, my little dove.
O God, how late it is! Oh, well I know
Each minute to him now more madness bring;
The man in him is dead, the fiend alive,
And on my head his fury he will fling,
And I no strength have left with him to strive.
Oh, baby, dear; oh, little one, be still!
I am afraid, if he shall hear thee cry
What he will do. My little darling, sleep;
Oh, Heavenly Father, help if Thou art nigh,
And from all harm my little baby keep.
Is it a sin for me to wish to die?
To wish that, with my baby, I were laid
Within the quiet grave, no more to see
Those fierce and gleaming eyes; no more afraid
Foul oaths and curses will be hurled at me?
On God's faith earth I see no darker lot
Than that which falls unto a drunkard’iS wife;
No hope, no joy, but fear from day to day,
And dread of what’s to come. Through all her life
The clouds ne’er lift nor terror flee away.
Oh, God in heaven, in pity hear and help,
Lest in my grief I should forget Thy love;
Send down thy Angel Death to set us free —
Hark! ’tis his footsteps. Oh, Thou friend above,
Stretch out Thy strong right arm and succour me!


Farewell Old Year.
Farewell, old year. Farewell, farewell,
Thou’rt pasing hence away,
Into the regions of the past
Where only memories stray;
The gate swings back for thy passage through,
We hear no step, nor tread
Of living feet, the dimlit streets
Are silent as the dead.
Yet varied as the scenes of earth
The pictured scenes within,
For are they not the records kept
Of that which once has been;
The thoughts and words and deeds of men
The busy world throughout;
The weakest efforts, all preserved,
The hope, the fear, the doubt.
Success and failure side by side
By previous years writ down.
The joys and sorrows, tears and smiles,
And deeds of no renown;
The good and bad in each one’s life,
Each action great or mean
In their true colours painted, and
The wishes In between.
And thou, old year, now go to add
Thy life’s work unto these
Who went before thee, to the land
Where active life doth cease.
How does the record look, old year
Which thou dost bear with thee?
How much of it would we erase
If such a thing might be?


How would we slowly o’er it go
With sigh, and tear, and smile;
With hope and fear o’er this and that.
Yet blotting out the while?
How little would we have preserved
For memory to scan
While wandering through the silent streets
Of the record-land of man.
Old year, old year, speed thee away,
Yet add this to our score,
The failures that our record show
But nerve our hearts the more;
With courage new, and patient hope
Our bosoms rise and swell,
The past is yours, the present ours,
Farewell, old year, farewell.
Praise.
Oh, sing, ye little birds on bush and tree!
And pour your gladness out in hearty song,
That it may echo all the way along,
Fill fields and dusty roads with melody.
O lovely flowers! True messengers of love,
And all thoughts beautiful and pure and sweet;
Ye preach a thousand sermons, all complete,
And lift the heart all sordid thing above.
And blow, ye soft winds, blow this summer day,
And chase the merry sunbeams o’er the grass;
And catch the scent of flowers as ye pass.
And scatter it around and far away.


There is a bird sings gaily in my breast,
There is a sunbeam lighteth on my heart,
And the soft winds sweep through in every part,
And blossoms of dear hope are ’gainst it prest.
And upward to the sky I lift my face,
And outward unto God my spirit flows.
And sheds its essence freely as the rose
In recognisance of these gifts of grace.
Ethel Wiley.
Not lost, not lost, only fallen asleep;
But oh, I am saddened to know
The beautiful life is so suddenly closed
To those who have known her below.
She is safe evermore, do you say?
Oh, yes, but it grieves me to think
From the chain of fair girlhood entwined round our Jives
We shall miss this beautiful link.
There are aged ones waiting in hope
For the angel of death to come;
There are weary and worn ones longing to hear
The summons to summon them home.
But the angel has passed them all by,
And God in His wisdom and love
Has sent for that dear, gentle girl in her youth
To place her with angels above.


A Reverie, Methodist Cemetery, Bowral.
Dear, quiet spot! How pleasant ’tis to rest
Within these sacred bounds,
To get away from all the outside world
And sit awhile and think and meditate.
The wheels of life go round so busily
In the great working world
That, in their constant whirr and noise
Our ears are stunned, our senses partly dulled;
We miss the sweeter and the finer sounds,
The voices that would soothe, and rest, and calm
The restless feelings that within us rise.
Here all is peace, all it suggests Is peace;
And sweet and precious thoughts steal over us,
As though an angel hovering near, had breathed
Them in our listening ear.
The place is full of messages of love
And hope, and exhortation, and repose;
Written on every tombstone, every flower;
Trilled in the music of the bird-notes overhead,
And whispered by the rustling leaves
Of every tree and shrub.
The silent bodies sleeping in the dust
Send up their message too,
And words of peace they are, such as come not
From any other lips that speak to us;
“No pain, no tears, no weary fretting here,
No longing for the morn, nor dreading night;
The weapons of our warfare are laid down,
No more we stand to fight earth’s battles hard,
For we have entered into rest, and fear
Nought any more.


The message of the flowers fill the air,
The joyful hope of resurrection and
The life beyond, the life without an end;
And fragrant as the flowers it seems to be
With all its promises, and beautiful
With their glad colouring. We do not know
What form ’twill take, nor need we care
We know it will be good and glorious;
And God, the Father, will be there, and we —
Ah! we shall then His presence realize.
As here we never can.
And we shall serve Him as we would, and ought
Without the consciousness of perverse thoughts,
And wandering mind, and things that grieve
Our chafed spirits now.
The happy birds in joyful freedom sing
And fly from tree to tree and stone to stone;
Oh, the glad thought that comes in watching them!
When we throw off this burden of the flesh,
The cage that holds the spirit, and confine
All power and action, we too shall be free
And soar away to where we fain would be.
And all these stones with various names engraved
Have a true message could we understand.
God giveth rest to His beloved ones
Yea, all their steps He marketh, and He sees
Each weary struggle, and He bendeth down
To lift them over this or that rough spot.
Which else they would despair of crossing, and
Takes firm hold of their hands in slippery places.
The heavens above so calmly looking down
Like the great spirit brooding over us
With love’s enfolding arms and tender care;
Oh! it is good to rest awhile and think
Of God and love, and heaven and life to come;


So we may gather strength for duty here,
And not be frightened by the many cares,
Nor so bound up in their entanglements
As to lose sight of life’s true, purpose, and
Our near relation unto God —our Father God.
Sunbeams.
I watched a sunbeam shining on a branch
All wet with dew,
And pearly drops and tremulous leaves
With tenderest hue
Were glorified ’neath the shining ray
Before my view.
A rosy baby face tear-wet with grief
Raised piteously;
A loving word, a smile and a kiss,
And then you see
Eyes, mouth and dimples, tears and all
Smile joyously.
A little thought comes into a mind
All dark with fear,
When a beam, God-sent, flashes o’er it
So bright and clear,
And instantly changed and glorified
It doth appear.
Sometimes our spirits grow sad and faint
We are opprest;
A beam from the sun of righteousness,
Lights on our breast;
Cares vanish and life grows glorious,
Our hearts find rest


To Fanny on her 12th Birthday
A very happy birthday we wish you, Fanny dear,
And many sweet surprises through all the coming year,
With sunny days of gladness undimmed by grief or fear.
’Tis but a little poesy, composed of simple flowers,
Yet God above, in tender love fashioned these forms of
ours,
And gave us work to do for Him, like those of greater
powers.
Here’s little bright Forget-me-not, with her sweet eyes of
Wide open to the light of day, as hearts are that are true;
And true heart kin to great heart is—we bring that thought
to you.
And here is lovely Snowdrop, so softly pure and white.
Yet not too frail to stand among her sister flowers bright;
As pure in thought and word and deed may we be in God’s
sight.
And here’s the fragrant Violet, so modest though so sweet,
She hides herself among her leaves like some dear friends
we meet,
Who know not how they bless us through their unwavering
And Pansies, beautiful Pansies, arrayed in colours gay,
Yet all so perfectly blended —no gaudy look have they,
There is restfulness in brightness—“Be cheerful,” Pansies


And this is the bloom of promise—the blossom of the
Peach,
A ruddy red, as though it said: “I’ve something more to
teach;
Though pleasant now to look upon, to fruit I hope to
reach.”
These white and yellow Marguerites, with petals smoothly
spread.
A regal name indeed they bear, and it means this, ’tis said,
“Look high, and do your very best, by no low aims be led.”
Anemones, and Stocks so sweet, Cornflowers and Southern-
wood;
Wildflowers, yes, and Lilac, too; if we but understood
All that they told our grandmothers, I think we’d count
them good.
And I am but a Daisy, the children’s much loved bloom,
That spring up almost anywhere, where there is soil and
room.
And sunlight, for I do not thrive in a perpetual gloom.
Although my sisters here are thought of much more note
than I,
They’ve chosen me to speak for them, I cannot tell you
why,
Unless it is because they think I’m not the least bit shy.
We have so many thoughts within these fragile hearts of
ours,
We cannot put them into words, we have no vocal powers,
We breathe and smile our blessings out —that is the speech
of flowers.


Stoop down, dear Fanny, while we breathe our sweetest
thought to you,
And smile back in your smiling eyes, don’t let your smiles
be few
For you are just a human flower, to breathe forth blessings
And with the greater gifts you have, how sweet your life
may be,
God feeds us with his sun and dev/, much more will He
feed thee
With the most precious of his store . single flowens,
A Song—Spring.
The voices of the springtime, how full and sweet they
are,
They thrill us with their music as we try
To hear the words they sing us and to catch the melody;
The new glad life around us charm the eye.
The bees are humming gaily ’mong the flowers,
The birds are singing sweetly in the trees,
The cattle in the pastures are content,
There is music in the passing of the breeze.
The beauty of the springtime, how wonderful it is,
The sheen upon the foliage so green,
The blossoms on the fruit-trees, the flowers everywhere,
The blending of the colours in between.
The glinting of the sun on the hill-tops,
The perfumes that are wafted on the air,
The treasures springing 'up by the wayside,
Are a promise and a token and a prayer.


Father.
“Now, mother, do ’ee set ’ee down, I’m feeling lonelyfied,
Set down an’ chat a little while, an’ let the sweepin’ hide;
No, doan’t ’ee git yer knittiu’ out, draw up yer cheear to
mine.
I’m tired to heear them cliokln’pins, an’ see ’enf flash an’
shine.
“I feel we’m gittjn’ down the hill, my legs begin to totter,
An’ you bean’t quite so spry an’ quick as roun’ the house
you potter;
An’ tho’ yer heeran’s quick an’ smart —now, mother, doan’t
be laffln’.
We’m gitten’ ould, an’ feelin’ et in spite ov oal yer chaffin’
“Iss, mother, I do know right well that you be brave an’
bright.
But winter’s frosts es on our heads, an’ I be dim ov sight;
Et seems like winter oal at once, an’ blawin’ up fer snaw,
An’ my ould boans caan’t stan’ the cauld like they could
once, you knaw.
‘No, I’m not feelin’ bad to-day, ’tis ounly thoughts keep
commin’
’Bout things as happened ’ears ago; an’ little toons keep
hummin’
So curious like aroun’ my ears: you used to sing ’em
mother;
1 b’lieve I’m feelin’ wlsht to-day, weth one thing an’
another.
“I keep on thinking Bess is heear, an’ then it seems like
Nancy,
An’ boath ov ’em died ’ears ago. I know tes ounly fancy;


D’ye think that Jim ul come to-day? No, doan’t ’ee think

I’m aunly tired a bit, that’s oal, an’ aage we caan’t be

“Hey! What was that? ’twor Bess that called. Why,
mother, are ’ee cryin’?
What’s that you say, you’ much afeared that father es a

No; mother, no! we’m gittin’ ould —there, sure nuf that is
Nancy,
An’ little Bess! Look! mother, look! ’twornt after oal a

“You better light the candle, Bess, ’tes gittin’ dark an

Iss, poke the fire up a bit; I caan’t see fer the mist,
Jest shut the winder, Nancy maid, the fog es thick an’
chill,
Hark! mother, caan’t ’ee heear the toons? they’m singin’,
singin’ still.
“I bean’t dyin’, aunly tired. Why, mother! b>«n’t ’ee see
The little maids?” The voice grew weak, trailed off, then
suddenly
The feeble breath stopped all at once, the dim eyes closed,
and there
Was deathly silence in the room; and dumbly, by the chair,
In grief too deep for words or tears, the lone old woman
stands
Still holding fast in agony to those fast stiffening hands.
Ah! human love, and human strength availeth nothing
more,
The half of life has snapped in twain, the soul is stricken
sore.


O death! O death! how e’er you come, some heart must
wounded he;
Come back ere long and comfort her. Ye are no enemy;
Come back and touch her trembling frame, and her grief
blinded eyes,
No other hand she longs for now this side the starry skies.
Alcohol
Oh, dreadful blight!
How it destroys, beginning at the root
And eating upward, killing as it goes.
Beginning with man’s finest qualities,
His honour and his reason, eating out the heart
Of his true manhood, leaving but a shell;
A cracked, unsightly shell, filled with all manner
Of unholy thoughts and loathesome forms.
Eating its way through every living channel,
Leaving its mark in trembling limbs, and vision blurred.
Oh, direful blight!
To those weak bloodshot eyes all things seem foul;
Nought pure and lovely strikes them as being real,
So much are they distorted by the plague within.
The heart is turned ’gainst home, and love and joy;
Objects that once gave pleasure now call up
But hate and passion, or derisive scorn.
Dear ones that once were fondly cherished, now
Receive no kindly word, or look or smile;


Their sorrow wakes no sympathetic chord,
Their sufferings only irritate, and stir
.Up passionate anger and unreasoning violence;
Or what is worse to loving, breaking hearts
A stony cold indifference, ’neath which dies
The warmest heart that ever beat in breast.
Oh, dreadful, threefold curse!
It has the power, body and mind and soul to kill;
Yea, killing either it must kill the whole.
Threefold again it slays wherever it takes hold,
Blighting the man, it blights the family, too,
And peace and home and hope is broken up.
There is no mitigation of the woe it works,
’Tis ruin, shame, and death throughout its course.
More dreadful than the plagues of war or famine,
Bad as are these, ’tis a disease of devils,
That while it works its way wins o’er the soul
To acquiesce in its most foul design.
High Range and Jellore.
“Far from the madding crowd,” oh yes,
Tho’ not so far by simple count
Of mile on mile as hill on hill;
Yea, one might say a thousand hills
That shuts the outer world from this.
The everlasting hills that stand
In quiet strength and majesty
Through all the years; no .change except
That which the changing seasons bring.


The new, young life that comes with spring,
The foliage, the bursting forth
Of bud and blossom on their sides;
The creeping vines that trail and twine
O’er time-worn rocks, and blackened buts
Of fallen trees, so clothing them
That beauty crowns them once again.
The summer with its fervid rays,
And bright hot days and dewy nights.
When life runs riot for awhile;
And blossoms take on deeper dyes,
And all the trees more vivid green,
’Till the dry scorching breath at last
On the life current breathes too hard,
And all the tender living things
Grow parched and fade, and Autumn comes.
And Autumn comes
With kinder airs and cooler breath,
And seems to give new life to all,
But ’tis not so, she only gives
The touch that quickens for a time;
The dying foliage, bringing forth
New beauties in the ripening seed
Foretells the end. And Winter comes.
And Winter comes
With the bleak biting westerlies.
That, sweeping through ’tween hill and hill
Strip off the gaily painted leaves
And whirl them here and there at will;
And the ripe seed or fruit falls off
And lie unheeded on the ground
Where beaten in by storm and rain
It finds a quiet resting place,
Till Spring once more shall show her face
And send her quickening breath around,
And force her searching sunrays through
The bare brown earth; and life once more
Leaps into beauty at her call.


Here Mount Jellore a landmark stands
Shaped like a giant sugar loaf
With a huge piece sliced off its crown;
Up the steep rugged side I climb
With labouring steps and panting breath,
And am repaid for all the toil.
Hill upon hills, range beyond range
Far as the eye can reach, until
The blue sky and the mountain tops
Meet and are merged in one dark haze.
It is a sight to thrill the soul,
Yet with a thrill that keeps it still.
The grandeur, the solemnity:
The quiet! yet instinct with life,
Not the drear quietness of death.
The brooding peace! The sense of strength
That lieth all around! The thought
Of everlasting majesty!
How small, from these pure breezy heights,
Where the free winds of heaven sweep
Unladen with the fret and fume
It carries in our work-day world;
How small the petty cares of life
Shrink, as we give our spirit room,
And liberty to rise, and soar
Up, out, to freer wider space.
And greater, purer thoughts and aims;
And take in from the great beyond
Something, if but a little glimpse
Of the great things that there await
The children of eternity.
And so be strengthened to endure,
And fight life’s battle patiently;
With courage and a cheerful faith,
As those who know, howe’er it goes
Or seems to go, it is the steps


By which we mount unto those heights.
Whence all the petty things slip off,
And the ignoble, and the soul
Free, unconfined, shall find at length
Its own, its natural atmosphere.
An Autumn Dav-
O fair, calm autumn day!
O fair, sweet autumn day!
As warm as summer breath the breezes blow;
And all the air is sweet,
The grasses ’neath the feet.
As in the springtime start again to grow.
Coloring rich and bold(
Bright reds and browns and gteld,
And all the paler tints that come between;
The azure of the skies
Is taking deeper dyes,
And the tall eucalyptus darker sheen.
Balmy sunny hours,
And soft falling showers
A quickening thrill through nature’s bosom send,
And so revivify
The things about to die,
And a false hope of life’s renewal lend.
But soon the westerlies
Will come with breath that freeze
The falling dew and turn it into rime,
And then will fall the leaves
From off the orchard trees,
And the crisp earth will know ’tis winter time.


We’re Travelling On.
We’re travelling on! We’re travelling on!
Through all the ages of the world;
Upon men’s lips have been that song—
We’re travelling on! We’re travelling on.
The rate of progress varied oft.
And ways and means have varied too,
But always was the goal the same —
That “something better” just in view.
We’re travelling on! We’re travelling on!
We still may sing it lustily.
But where we’re travelling, who can tell.
Though on we hasten eagerly?
The speed grows swifter year by year,
The ways and means more fearful grows;
And that dim shadow leading on
Fear nor fatigue nor slumber knows.
On, on it glides with monster strides,
And all the nations of the world
Are running after, straining hard
To get beneath its flag unfurled.
Men used to stop awhile to breathe.
Or help a weaker brother on,
Or set one fallen on his feet,
Nor grudged the time to right a wrong.
But now the cry is—on! on! on!
No time to stop, no time to think,
That —something better’s close in view,
The strong press on, the weaker sink.


We’re travelling on, we’re travelling on,
And the long road no smoother grows
We’re running after better things (?)
But when we’ll reach them goodness knows!
Peace hides herself, and Rest is not;
There’s nothing strong to lean upon,
And Happiness throws back at us
The mocking cry, “I’m travelling on.”
We’re travelling on, and turmoil grows,
And deadlier hates, and deeper woes;
And passions lead, and selfish greed
Crush men and nations as with blows.
Evils that once looked black as night,
Are painted now and varnished o’er;
And man to man all mocking cries.
“See, these are evils now no more.”
Truth may be here or there, or not,
There is no time its track to trace,
We’re travelling on at breathless speed
And Right seems nowhere in the race
Oh! one would think to view the pace
That something fearful would ensue,
If men and nations paused awhile
To find out where they’re rushing to.


Luliobv Baby.
Lullaby, baby! Close the wee shutters.
Off into dreamland, hush-a-by by!
The dreamland fairies are waiting and calling.
Bluebells are ringing a melody sweet,
And dear little birds are singing a welcome;
Now fold the wee hands and tuck in the wee feet.
Go to sleep, baby, hush-a-by by!
Lullaby, baby; Under the willows,
Down there in dreamland fair lilies grow.
Like beautiful goblets, snow white, and golden,
Filled to the brim with a fragrant perfume,
Afloat on the water shedding their sweetness
To waft away shadows and weeping and gloom.
Rock-a-by baby! Hush-a-by by!
Lullaby, baby! Louder and louder
Bluebells are ringing. Hush-a-by by!
Hear the soft cry; ’tis the fairies are calling,
Sweetly and cheerily all the birds sing;
“Come, little baby! come hither, come hither!”
See the bright butterflies all on the wing?
Rock-a-by, baby! Hush-a-by by!
Come away, baby. Here is the carriage,
Made out of pine cones, cushioned with moss,
Pillows of thistledown, studded with daisies,
Rugs made of rose petals, charmingly sweet,
Two pretty white kids all harnessed and ready
To drive you through dreamland, with swift willing
Come away, baby. Come away, dear.
Lullaby, baby! Right into dreamland,
Gaily, cosily settled at last;
No other place has such wonders to tell of,


No other country with it can compare;
Already smiles around baby’s mouth dimple,
A proof of the good time the darling has there.
Rock-a-by, baby! Hush-a-by by!
Futile Rebellion,
/ Be still, my heart, be still!
2 When ye are restless, and rebelliously
.‘ Life’s burden grows beyond the strength to bear
j Beat ’gainst the bars of this frail frame that holds
4 Thee like a prisoned bird. Wait patiently.
WAit patiently, oh heart!
They tell us that so often, and we fail
To follow out the good advice, and yet
We know it for the wisest. Oh, poor heart!
It is so useless to rebel and fret.
In these mad, busy days
Life’s burdens grow in weight and number,
One has to hurry so; there is no time
To get one’s breath and gather strength, and leam
The lessons by the way. ’Tis climb and climb.
And toil and climb again;
And one may toil and climb from day to day
And no higher vantage ground, and find
No rest * satisfaction. On, move on!
Are the main words one hears; and soul and mind


Moves on, and on, and on;
Till fagged, and strained, and overtaxed, both fail,
And break down by the way. O, heart, be still!
This is not living; this is not the life
God gave to man, or meant him to fulfil.
Man made this life himself
And robbed himself thereby, and thee and me,
And all the generations yet to he;
O heart, ’tis useless, useless to rebel,
’Twere better far to suffer patiently.
* And what is it ye want?
Utopian dreams! Utopian dreams
They are that fill thee, as of old;
They filled so many other hearts, and made
Life seem a glorious thing to have and hold.
Ah, longing, long stilled hearts!
Stilled long before their dreams came true, and some —
The largest some, have never yet come true,
And never will; but hope dies hard, and ye
Still beat the bars in hope they’ll break for you.
God’s Acre.
GOD’S ACRE.
“God’s acre.” The garden of quiet and peace
Shut off from the world by a silent decree;
Here strife and discord and vanity cease,
And the heart is soothed, and the soul is free.


“God’s acre,” the spot where so often we think
The rest that we long for only is found;
When our feet are tired, and spirits shrink
From the toil of life and the weary round.
How slowly we walk, and how softly we tread,
What thoughts and memories crowd into the mind;
What low sweet whispers we hear overhead,
Or seem to hear in the murmuring wind.
“God’s acre!” We like to think of it as such,
And theirs, the sleepers who rest from their’toil;
The unforgotten; we lovingly touch
The flowers that bloom on the sacred soil.
O, the fair, sweet flowers that bloom on the graves!
What beautiful thoughts to us they suggest:
Beyond the dark valley and swelling waves
There is life and beauty, and love and rest.
We are not saddened, our friends are not here;
Their mouldering dust ’neath the sod may lie
We know and feel there’s a happier sphere,
And we, too, shall enter it by and by.
And What is it to Die?
(In Memoriam.)
And what is it to die, To live we know
If often pain and sorrow, many fears
Are mingled with our joys, our happiest days
Are often closed with heartache and with tears.


We live, and love, and learn. And when we aei
Our heart to reach the highest goal, we find
Our holiest joys are tempered with earth’s sins,
And our most earnest efforts lag behind.
And what is it to die? Some call it sleep,
A folding of the hands upon the breast,
A laying down of burdens and of care,
A closing of the eyes, and —henceforth rest.
Some call it passing cut from night to dawn,
A breaking forth into a glorious day;
The lifting of the shadows that conceal
The world w 3 think of as so far away.
One called it lying back within God’s arms,
The arms of the eternal God, and so
Enfolded, straightway all earth’s cares slip off,
And peace and deep content the soul o’erflow.
A great, sweet thought—to lie back in God’s arms
Just like a tired child at close of day
Lays down its head upon its mother’s breast,
And all its weariness forgets straightway.
And so it is. Death has no bitter sting
To God’s own children. Round their dying bed
His angel guards are placed, His presence soothes,
And heavenly consolations round them shed.
And so it was with him —the dear, dear lad,
Wihose death and victory fills my mind to-day.
And stirs my heart with tender thoughts, and deep,
And makes me in one breath to praise and pray.


The weary days of weakness all are o’er,
The days and weeks and months, when skill and care
Could give no ease to that poor frame, and those
Who loved him best, for him no part could bear.
Oh, grief of loving hearts that daily watch
By beds of sickness! And the emptiness
Of heart and home when the loved one is gone,
Whose presence nevermore that home will bless!
But fragrant are the memories that remain,
And comforting the thought that —all is well.
The patient, suffering lad has won his crown,
And joys unknown to earth his heart now swell.
Yes, it is well. We know, and yet we grieve
Because we love, because our hearts are knit
To those we love. ’Tis not rebellious grief,
To God’s own loving will we can submit.
And oh, He knows. He understands it all —
The silent, falling tears, the wistful looks;
The heart’s continuous craving just to see
The dear, dear face once more. Dear hearts, He knows,
And folds thee round with his dear sympathy.
He also loves the lad God loves the lad —
How tenderly He bore him at the last;
Yea, gave him glimpse of heaven ere he went,
To cheer his heart and thine, ere hence he passed.
And God is love. And thou shalt one day lie
Back in His arms; and every earthly grief
Shall slip away; and peace, and deep content
Wipe out all memories of these partings brief.
—Lines on the death of Harold Waters.


Do You Hear the Bugle Sounding?
Do you hear the bugle sounding
And the tramp of many feet?
’Tis an army that is marching past your doors;
An army in the making
For Australia’s future need,
Should an enemy come poaching on her shores.
Chorus —
Boys of Australia, we’re marching off to drill,
The soldier must be trained to do his work,
And we are young and pliant
And come with heart and will,
There’s not a lad among us wants to shirk.
Do not think that we are playing,
That we count it only fun,
Or think only of the glory of the show;
An acorn’s not a forest,
But some future day may see
A fair giant of an oak tree from it grow.
Chorus —
Boys of Australia, we’re marching off to drill,
We’re ready to be trained to do our part;
There’s crowing power in ns
Life’s duty to fulfil,
And we’re tramping off to practise for a start.
Do you hear the bugle sounding
And the tramp of many feet?
’Tis the army of the future marching by;
The army of Australia —
The’ her boy cadets to-day,
And we’ll strive to keep her banner waving high.


Chorus —
Boys of Australia, we’re marching off to drib.
The soldier must be trained to do his work,
And we are young—and willing
Our duty to fulfil,
There’s not a lad among us wants to shirk.
A Bouquet of Flowers.
O beautiful flowers!
Have you brought them, my friend, for me?
Bring them closer that I may see
Their exquisite colour and form.
How bright and cheerful they are!
Like a breath of the wind from the south.
When the drought has been bleaching the earth;
Like the scent of the buhsland afar,
With the dew of the night on the leaves;
Like the song of the birds on the air
Trilling into my chamber they come.
Fair, fragrant flowers!
All fresh from their bowers,
Where sunshine caressed them by day,
And dew fell on them at night,
And winds kissed them oft on their way;
And soft-falling showers
Refreshed them and plenished their cups,
And made the brown earth yield them food
Till they grew so exceedingly fair,
The sight of them truly is good.


Sweet blossoms, and dear!
Memory wakens and thrills,
And fancy leaps to her feet;
Emotions long dulled are stirr’d
In the deep well of the heart.
The walls of my chamber fall back,
And a wond’rous procession goes by.
No longer I listen to hear
The singing of birds from without,
Or the sound of the wind in the trees;
Or watch through the window to see
The sun flicker in through the vines,
I am out in the midst of it all!
When the Ship Comes Home.
When the ship comes heme! When the ship comes home
With treasures from o’er the sea,
What wonderful times we then shall have,
And how happy we all shall be!
O, wearisome waiting to childish hearts!
O, watching of wistful eyes!
Looking ever towards the broad deep sea
For the sails of the ship to rise.
O mother, what day will the big ship come?
Was often the plaintive cry;
When wants were many, and hope grew faint;
And the answer was, “By and by.”


Please tell us again wihat the ship will bring
From over the swelling main;
And eyes grew brighter, and hearts grew light
To hear the old story again.
Such beautiful things from nobody’s land,
Where never a ship has been;
Flowers of fancy and gems of worth,
Gathered out of the great unseen.
Such beautiful garments, invisible,
The airiest things to wear;
Gay gold nothings and new silver noughts
To bind on their neck and their hair.
Such lovely carpets! Too soft for the feet
That might-have-been people makes;
Fairy food, too delicious to eat,
Fruits, sweeties, and patties and cakes.
Oh! wonderful stories the ears drank in,
And far would the young minds roam,
In realms of fancy, to them so real,
To the time when the ship comes home.
The ship never came. Again and again
’Twas wrecked ere it reached the shore;
Sank in the depths of the deep blue se.i
With the wonderful freight it bore.
Was it well to trouble the tender souls
With longings so vague and vain?
To put them off with stories so wild,
To spare them a moment of pain?


How many still wait for the ship to come,
Tho’ childish delusion is o’er,
And hug the fancy still to their hearts,
And watch for the ship from the shore?
Unsettled of mind, unsteady of will,
No purpose in life have they;
Waiting and dreaming, their hopes are built
On the chance that will come some day.
When the ship comes home! When the ship comes home
They will do wonderful things;
They have no part in the workaday world,
They watch for the ship’s white wings.
And the burden of life that falleth to them
Others must shoulder and bear;
And thus it cometh that some must needs
Carry more than their own life’s share.
Good Night, Mv Love.
Good night, my love:
If I should wake no more,
If sleep should drift me to the other shore,
And land me on the everlasting hills —
Good night, dear love, good night!
Grieve not as though
We ne’er shall meet again;
Upon each other’s face, dear heart, we twain
Shall surely look once more, and no more say
Good night, dear love, good night.


Fitzroy FaMs in a Fog.
Fitzroy has veiled herself in robes of mist;
And we who came with expectations high
To revel in her beauty, and with awe
Gaze on the grandeur of her rocky gorge,
In disappointment mutely stand and sigh.
Her beauties all are hidden in the fog,
Only bold outlines of her steeps are shown;
The gorge is level to the very top
With rolling waves of mist, like driven snow,
Or magic seas up the green valley blown.
The trees are waving weirdly to and fro,
Like ghostly objects wrapped in shadows grey;
We see the waters rushing o’er the heads
With swift tumultuous rush, and vainly try
To pierce the unkind fog to trace their way.
A foot or two of something silv’ry white
And soft and fleecy as a bridal veil,
A mass of glist’ning threads and that is all,
The shadowy sea engulfeth all the rest,
And Nature’s face all round is dim and pale.
Half hoping, half with feelings of despair,
We trace the winding pathways carefully,
And on each guarded “look-out” take our stand,
Ling’ring in hopes a friendly breeze will lift
The thick unkindly veil that we may see.
But vain, the fog flaunts boldly in our face,
And gath’ring on the branches overhead
Drop down upon us in a chilling shower;
Yet persevering still we push along,
And creep or climb, by hopefulness still led.


Through a perfect .bower we pass, and now
’Neath an o’er hanging rock that forms an arch;
In single file we creep along with care,
Almost on hands and knees, while lizards peep
From holes uncanny, ’tis a mystic march.
The moisture oozes through the rocky roof,
And through the slipp’ry ledge beneath our feet,
While on the left a fearful chasm gapes.
With nought to stay it should a stumbling foot
Slip o’er the edge, an awful fate to meet.
Emerging thence, through Lovers’ walk we pass,
If you are doubtful, see it for yourself,
And say if e’er you saw so fair a place
To walk and whisper loving nothings in,
With Cupid for a third the unseen elf.
It is an ideal path, and overhead
The eucalyptus’ lap, and then we come
To a swift stream spanned by a shaky bridge,
That gives alarmingly beneath our tread,
And turns the noisest of our party dumb.
And lo! ’tis perseverance wins the day,
We are rewarded for our pleasant toil;
Within a lovely grotto now we stand,
And not a vestige of the fog is here
The beauty of the place to hide or spoil.
The rugged floor’s besprinkled o’er with green,
The rocky walls are wreathed enchantingly
With ferns and mosses and fair climbing plants;
And stony seats are here, and in the midst —•
With ample spreading boughs, a lovely free.


All white with blossom. Silently we stand
And slowly gaze around and drink our fill
Of berauty; and of something deeper still.
For which we have no name but only feel,
And bow before with an acquiescent will.
With slow, reluctant feet we turn away,
Talking the less because we think the more;
And through the winding paths retrace our steps,
And pass again along the way we came,
To find the fog e’en denser than before.
And though we look regretfully across
The bolder grander views, enfolded quite,
And hidden from our sight as with a shroud
We half forgive Fitzroy her churlishness
At thought of that fair grotto’s graciousness,
And carry home with us some blossoms white
Cradle Song.
Lie still, darling. Listen, baby dear;
Three lovely ladies, they are coming here.
Coming up from moonland at the close of day;
Lightly, softly treading, o’er the starry way,
Lady Night and Lady Sleep and Lady Rest are they,
Come to kiss the tired eyes at the close of day.
Bylo, baby ! Bylo bylo.


Lie still, darling. Listen while they sing,
Three gentle voices—sweet and true they ring,
Softly, softly thrilling on the drowsy air.
Singing all of dreamland, calling baby there.
Lady Night is very dark, and starry is her gown,
And she wears a crescent moon for a golden crown.
Bylo, baby! Bylo, 'bylo.
Lie still, darling. Bylo, baby mine,
Three smiling faces looking into thine,
Soiftly, softly whispering, what is it they say?
Baby’s off to moonland, smiling all the way;
Lady Sleep is very fair, and dreamy are her eyes.
And her gown is soft and grey like the-evening skies.
Bylo, baby! Bylo bylo.
Bylo darling. Baby’s fast asleep,
Three lovely ladies silent vigil keep.
Soltly, softly smoothing feet and hands and brow,
Kissing down the eyelids, baby’s resting now.
Lady Rest is very sweet, and on her breast she wears
One sweet scented crimson rose, love’s own charm for
cares.
Bylo, baby! Bylo bylo.


Home Letters.
Home letters, can I burn them?
A thousand times no! no!
Those closely written pages
From me shall never go;
Although the hands that penn’d them
Are many miles away,
Sincere and deep affection
Each message underlay.
I know they were not written
In careless mood or style,
The loving heart that breathed each word
Was aching all the while;
I know the tears were falling
Upon the fair white page,
The eyes were often blinded
While on the task engaged.
I know that little faces
Eager with love were there,
While restless little footsteps
Kept shuffling ’round the chair;
Wee tongues going all together
In one quick eager strain.
With every loving message
Told o’er and o’er again.
I know the thoughts and feelings
That breathes through every line,
The hopes and fears that mingle
With every 1 tter kind:
Can I burn them, dear home letters?
A thousand times, No! no!
’Twould be shutting out the sunbeams
From my pathway as I go.


For they are gleams of sunshine
In this far-off land to me,
And in every word here written
A world of love I see;
When I’m tired, sad or lonely
I can read them o’er and o’er \
And forget the long, long distance
From my own dear native shore.
Each letter to my fancy
Bears with it a subtle spell,
As though some loving spirit
Within its folds do dwell;
I will keep them, words of comfort,
Dear home letters, sweet to me,
Gleams of sunshine from the old home
Far away beyond the sea.
We All Have Days of Sadness.
We all have days of sadness, —
There is no life so bright
But sometimes has its shadows
To hide the sun from sight;
And all hearts have some weakness
However strong they be,
Some tender spot within them
That’s hurt most easily.


Then how much should we study
While here we must remain,
To add no drop of sorrow,
To give no needless pain;
To cloud no day unheedful,
To check no gladsome thought,
To leave no backward record
With keen remorse enwrought.
This life has many trials,
It is no easy track,
With all its storms, and tempests,
That no hand may hold back;
How cruel, then, to trouble
With needless pain, or care,
The hearts of those about us, —
For each has its own share;
Bach heart must bear its burden,
Each back bend to Its task;
To add no other to it
Is little grace to ask;
But, oh! it means to many
Much more than can be told;
And daily loving kindness
Is better far than gold.


My Vision Splendid.
Oh, I have a vision splendid:
When this life on earth is ended,
When these earthly bonds are broken
And I rise,
Prom this earthly tabernacle.
When my soul bursts through the shackle
Of the flesh and its defilements,
And my eyes
With new sight all things beholding.
See the sky above unfolding.
And the shining way to Zion
Clear in view;
With bright bands of spirits gracious,
Coming down the roadway spacious,
Their heavenly mission earthward
To pursue.
Up the shimm’ring ether ocean,
With the swiftest, lightest motion,
With a sense of new-born freedom
I shall go;
While the world recedes behind me,
With no power more to bind me,
And the soft heavenward currents
Round me blow.
Like a captive out of prison
To unthought-of bliss uprisen,
With no wish to stand or loiter
the way;
Drawn by love that sought and found me,
By the dear marred hands that bound me
To Himself in tender mercy,
Lest I stray.


Past bright worlds we long have heard
And past wonders that no word of
Has ever reached the earth’s domain,
He leads me;
Conscious but of one great blessing,
Only one idea posessing,
Forward, forward ever pressing,
He and me.
The clear jasper walls before us,
And the bright light falling o’er us
Through the pearly gates, with portals
Open wide;
Up the golden streets unshrinking,
Facing all the light unblinking,
In a silent rapture walking
His side.
Sweetest voices round us singing,
And ten thousand joybells ringing,
And a crowd of happy faces
Left and right;
And I hear my Saviour speaking,
Well He knows what I am seeking!
And He leads me gently forward—
Oh, the sight!
’Tis the great white throne before us,
’Tis the Father bending o’er us, —
Dare I look upon the grandeur
Of His face?
Lo! I know it without seeing,
Every fibre of my being
Thrills, and feels the consummation
Of His grace.
To the pierced hands still clinging,
While my heart is softly singing
In a wordless adoration,
Love and bliss,


All my soul the while expanding,
With a fuller understanding
Of the love that sought and kept me
Unto this. •
Oh! the overflowing rapture
That doth all my senses capture,
In the perfect satisfaction
Of my being.
Abba Father! Abba Father!
Home at last! Oh, Abba Father!
And I dare to lift mine eyes in
Worshipping.
The Best Gift.
if 1 had power to give to thee
A perfect gift, what should it be;
What good thing that should ever prove
All-powerful, and always sweet,
And now, and ever be complete?
I know nought better, dear, than love
Some people hold that health is best;
And health is good, but in the test
It sometimes happens that the heart
Is hungry and unsatisfied:
Health all its needs may override,
And no true happiness impart.


Gold, worldly riches some would choose;
It gives a power to hold, or use,
And it can purchase many things,
It cannot buy a loving heart;
One may own wealth, and have no part
In earth’s and heaven’s best offerings.
Fame ? Honour? These are very sweet.
But even these are not complete,
One sometimes likes to be alone;
Fame is not tender: it can heal
When pride is touched, it can reveal
No tender, 'inner loving tone.
Love —love is best. That stayeth on:
If all that else we rest upon
Should fail us, it would 'prove enough
To make the sum of happiness;
Enough through all of life to bless
For aching heart, and pathway rough.
Ring, Ring the Bells.
Ring, ring the bells!
And far and near
The old sweet story tell again,
So old, and yet so sweet and new;
So wonderful, and yet so true:
The joyful news again proclaim—
“On earth be peace, goodwill to men,
The Christ is born on earth to reign.”


Ring, ring the bells!
And look away
Across the years. Oh, Bethlehem!
So highly honoured, and so fair,
Thou dost not keep the Christ-child there;
Time has not dimmed His wond’rous fame.
To the whole world the message came —
“Great joy, salvation unto men.”
Ring, ring the bells!
And bring your gold,
And bring your frankincense and myrrh,
Messiah’s come. The Christ is here.
God’s pledge of love—what pledge so dear?
In the dark cloud a rift is made.
Across the gulf a bridge is laid,
And love Divine great gifts confer.
Ring, ring the bells!
The Angel throng
Commemorate the joyful day;
Heaven and earth unite to sing
Their hallelujahs to this King,
The world’s Redeemer, humbly born,
The Babe that gave us Christmas morn.


Bn the Quiet Night.
Calm, sweetly calm was the evening,
Unlike my spirit within
All chafed with the day’s rough friction,
The pain, the toil, and the sin.
I walked out into the roadway
With heavy and tired feet;
And away from the house, so stuffy
With the long day’s scorching heat;
And I gave my spirit freedom
To speak and rebel at will,
To utter its plaints unchidden:
'Twas hard to be always still.
I looked up into the heavens,
So calmly serene and clear.
And over the peaceful landscape,
And up at the high hill near;
A green-clad hill, where the shadows
Crept stealthily up its side,
Suggestive of dark recesses
Where the unseen terrors hide.
No sound of the great world’s discord
Falls on the listening ear,
But only the hum of insects
And the croak of frogs anear.
Nought to remind one of turmoil,
And sorrow and anxious care;
Nothing to tell of the struggle,
The burdens one has to bear;
Nothing uneasy or restless,
Only one great, brooding peace
That seemed to mock at my spirit
By bidding its fretting cease.


Ah! how can the soul be quiet
While under the constant call
To battle, or to resistance?
Yea, life has no peace at all.
Day follows day in the struggle,
Days that are weary and long;
And sometimes Right is the strongest,
But oftenest ’tis the Wrong.
Oh, how can the soul be quiet
And cease to chafe and complain,
While every good must be fought for,
Fought for again and again?
Hope springeth up like the flowers,
But e’er it blossoms it dies;
Oh, how can the soul be quiet
While ’neath the torture it lies?
The cool wind swept o’er my forehead
Like a soft, caressing hand,
But the painful thoughts within me
Swelled up at my soul’s command;
And to and fro on the green sward
That bordered the dusty track
I walked with impatient footsteps,
For my soul was on the rack.
And what is life but a burden,
A long and lingering pain,
Full of deceit and delusion,
Cheating again and again.
What is it all but a struggle
For enough to eat and to wear,
And a place to lay one down on
To weep, and to sleep off care?


And love? Oh, love is a torture,
A sweetness all fraught with pain,
Where love is there is suffering;
Love is a bitter refrain.
Love is the keenest of anguish,
And helpless to help at need;
Its strength and its weakness ever
Causeth the heart to bleed.
The shade had deepened around me.
And here and there in the sky,
A glittering star was peeping,
Like a bright observant eye;
I stilled my soul for a moment,
And silenced its plaints and cries,
To watch from over the tree-tops
The silvery moon uprise.
Beautiful, luminous, silent.
So stately, and grand, and free;
And, lo! a million stars came out
The beautiful Queen to see.
The wind swept over my forehead
Like gentlest touch of a hand,
And something touched my fevered brain
And brake, as it were, a band;
And tears, long checked, rushed to mine
eyes,
And swift and unheeded fell,
While the calm brightness wrapped me
round
With a soft, magnetic spell;
The balm of healing fell on me
Subduing the bitter pain,
And in the depths of my heart awoke
An old and a dear refrain.


The stars looked down with kindly eyes
Yea, it seemed as if they smiled;
It was as if they spake to me.
Such a foolish, fretful child.
And looking at that shining orb
So calm, so bright, so grand.
The spirit of Peace took hold of me,
And held me fast by the hand.
Spring.
Lo! the earth is very fair
With the budding of the spring.
And the music of the air
Has a gladness in its ring;
And the winter’s dun and grey
To the new life giveth way,
’Till the earth is very gay.
All the orchards are abloom
With their blossoms red and white;
And the pasture lands assume
A new verdure; and the sight
Of the beauty all around.
Makes the spirit in us bound,
As at treasure newly found.
Earth is full of mystery!
’Mongst those lovely blossoms lurk
Enemies we cannot see,
And the fruit will show their work;
Frosts untimely, blight and kill,
Storms sweep o’er and do their will.
While the old world goes on still.


Hearts to-day in sweet content,
Like the springtime laugh and sing;
They to-morrow may be rent,
Joy turned into sorrowing;
There are foes we cannot
That may light on you and me;
There is no immunity.
Life is full of mysteries;
And we travel on our way
Making up its histories
With our fellows day by day;
It is well we do not know
What to-morrow’s page will show.
How to-morrow’s winds will blow.
Once we had a red plum tree,
Strong and healthily it grew,
Ample branches spreading free,
Nothing ailed it that we knew;
But one day we found it dead,
All the leaves were withered,
All the beauty from it fled.
So it sometimes happeneth
With some happy hearts we know,
They are blighted to the death
By some swift, unlooked-for blow;
While the sun is shining bright,
While the heart is glad and light,
Cometh down a sudden blight.


Grandmother’s Asleep in Her
Chair.
Grandmother’s asleep in her chair,
Her busy hands lie on her lap;
Her knitting has dropped to the floor.
Obliged to give way to King Nap.
Step softly, don’t waken her, pray.
How silv’ry the soft hair has grown!
How tired she’s looking, and old,
But, ah! how much trouble she’s known.
How deep are the lines on her face.
And all the bright roses are dead;
But the love in her heart is as fresh
As the time when the roses were red.
The dear, loving eyes are now closed.
But under those lids so white
They are shining beautiful still,
With tender, affectionate light.
Dear hands! Oh, how long they have
toiled,
All comforts and needs to supply
Ne’er grudging their utmost to do;
I kiss them so softly, and sigh.
A choking comes into my throat,
I cannot see clearly for tears;
How patient and kind she has been
Throughout all those burdensome years!
Dear Grandmother! Lower the blind,
Let her sleep as long as she will;
She’s tired; but see, in her dreams
She’s smiling, and comforting still.


Lines on a Collection of Colours
Beautifully Arranged.
O beautiful, beautiful colours.
Delightful, entrancing to view:
The music of silence, soft blending
With the music of sound, ascending
In cadences tender and true.
The beautiful green of the grasses.
The many-hued green of the trees;
The glory o*f gardens and bowers,
The wonderful tints of the flowers,
Are all represented in these.
The glory of sunrise and sunset,
The wonder of ocean and sky;
The grandeur of purple-topped mountains.
The music of silver-toned fountains
On Fancy’s light pinions float by.
The story of Winter and Summer,
The story of Autumn and Spring;
The story of all beauty vernal,
The story of Love that’s eternal,
This —this is the song that they sing.


Noon and Night.
I stand upon a height from which I see
The great and busy city, on my ear
The murmur of the life within it falls;
And noon is near.
The sun pours down its rays and gilds
each spire,
And gleams upon the waters in the bay;
And hot and clear the air grows all around.
It is full day.
My feet are weary climbing up the hill,
And there has been no shelter from the
And higher yet, and higher I must climb.
Ere day is done.
I muse awhile o’er toil and sorrows past.
And ’tis as yet but noontide; and before
There are so many steeps, alas! I wish
The day were o’er.
Yet even now a sweet thought comes to
Just like a soft and cooling breath of
wind:
That step by step I’m mounting, and I
leave
Each care behind.
I look down o’er the city, and I see
The shadows fold it round; and upward
A dim and misty fog, like spirits grey
To meet the skies.


Darker, and darker yet the shadows grow;
And like unnumbered stars the lamplights
gleam,
Like struggling souls amid life’s gloom
and fog
With hopeful beam
My soul wakes up and stills the quivering
flesh,
That has so many burdens on it laid:
“At eventide, behold it shall be light,”
Be not afraid.
I do not know just what it may be like
Beyond the gloom; but this I know and
’Tis light—’tis wond’rous light! and joy
untold
Dawn will reveal.
The Bow in the Cloud.
Dear little book, ye speak to me
In words exceeding sweet,
Of comfort true and love divine
For hours of sorrow meet;
And I gladly take them to my heart
Their true work to complete.
The gentle voice oif an earthly friend
Falls softly on the ear
When storms are beating overhead,
And the heart is faint with fear;
Ye are the voice of a friend to me
Out of the darkness near.


On.'y ye speak of better things
Than any earthly good,
And the “bow” of heavenly comfort shines
Where God has said it should;
And my heart can rest in His tender love,
And trust in His Fatherhood.
I am His child, He loves me well:
That is the sweetest thought,
My comfort in the long, dark hours, —
Yea, sometimes I have caught
So near and dear a sense of Him
As make earth’s ills seem nought.
A feeling of such deep heart rest,
Such utter sweet content
That all is well, and shall be well;
And each affliction’s blent
With a dear token of His love
To prove it heaven sent.
And heaven is not far away,
The splendour of its skies
Is often shining on our path,
While we with lowered eyes
Walk weeping through the valleys' here,
With sad, complaining cries.
My Father, God! Our Saviour dear!
O wond’rous Mystery!
Such patient, kind, long-suffering love!
And how it humbles me
To think how little I deserve,
And yet so blest should be.


Safe wrapped around with those dear arms.
Upheld through all the way,
With all those precious promises:
What should my soul dismay?
What passing ill should hinder me
To praise as well as pray?
The Larrikin.
There is a weed that grows
In this our country fair;
In every town, in every street,
Go where you will your eyes will meet
This rank, unlovely tare.
And, oh! the pity is!
The pity and the sin!
Each ugly weed was once a flower,
Tho’ changed by some malignant power
Into a larrikin.
It grows in every soil,
Not in the slums alone;
In homes where competence abound,
In fairest homes this weed is found
What hand the seed has sown?
Is it not well to ask,
Why should this evil be?
And whence the power that works the ill,
The parents’ hearts with shame to fill,
The children’s enemy?


Look in the many homes
Wherein this evil thrives;
No lack of anything, maybe,
Save gentleness and courtesy.
To grace their daily lives.
The fathers frown and chide,
The mothers fret and scold;
There is no harmony at all,
’Tis like an ever-rolling ball,
This snarling in the fold.
And parents, you may grieve
O’er wilful girls and boys;
It is not only on the streets
They learn the evil that defeats
Your hopes, and plans, and joys.
The children, day by day.
Behind the scenes do dwell,
What you would teach is marr’d because
They see you do not keep the laws,
Nor love them over well.
In homes where peace and love,
And courtesy abides;
Where parents teach, and practice, too,
The things they’d have the children do.
No larrikin resides.


Jov and Sorrow.
When the heart is glad
All things look fair, and hope is strong.
And fancy flows like rippling streams
Along life’s way; no fears are there
To break the spell of pleasant dreams,
When the heart is glad.
W T hen the heart is sad
Thought travels slowly, for it sees
So much to grieve o’er, and to dread,
So many burdens to be borne:
The spirit moves with feet like lead
When the heart is sad.
When the heart is glad
To live, to plan, to work is joy;
The tide of human pain and woe
That through the world’s great heart still
flows
No deep thrills wake, no shadows throw,
When the heart is glad.
When the heart is sad
Life wears a dark, mysterious hue,
All tinged throughout with pain and sin;
The world of sorrow comes so near.
Each suffering one seems near of kin
When the heart is sad.
When the heart is glad
Do we then live the truest life?
Or do we better, truer grow
In darker paths, wherein we walk
With earnest, careful steps and slow
When the heart is sad.


Nay, sorrow, joy,
Are God’s good gifts, we need them both
To make life noble and complete;
The rain and sunshine of the soul,
The winter frosts and summer heat
Are joy and sorrow.
Thoughts on a Rose.
A beautiful Rose,
A rich, red rose, with a sweet perfume,
Languid with sickness I lie and look,
This lovely flower has banished gloom.
My heart delights in its petals smooth,
I lay it down on my quilt so white
To note the contrast, and I am cheered
its fragrant smell, its colour bright.
I gaze on it with a deep content
In its perfect form, against my cheek
I hold it softly: ’tis like a charm,
Lovely flower! If it could but speak!
If it could but speak? Oh, foolish words!
’Tis breathing forth from its bosom red
The deepest, truest, and sweetest thoughts
That e’er could visit a sick one’s bed.


God made this beautiful flower, and me;
Fashioned us both with marvellous skill
And gave to us life. ’Tis sweet to think
His gracious care is over us still.
But He might have made the world and
man.
And left the beautiful flowers out.
But Love, Infinite, far-seeing Love,
Has scattered these treasures all about.
This lovely, flower says, “God is Love.”
How sweet love is let its perfume tell,
The meanest part of our natures shrink
And shrivel and hide, beneath its spell.
All that is truest within us spring
Impulsively into active life
Before these blossoms of God’s fair earth,
These meek rebukers of hate and strife.
Sweet rose! fair flower! another thought
Thy crimson bosom reveals to me;
How short life is, and how frail we are,
How near the eternal world are we.
The angel death comes hovering round,
We do not know where his hand may
We see his shadow, but cannot hear
The sound of his footsteps through the
hall.
Oh, what a dark mystery it is!
How awed we feel, how real and near
The world beyond us appears to be,
And how uncertain are all things here


How swiftly the soul looks up to God,
How true are its instincts; He alone
Can take the sting from the stricken heart,
And soothe the sorrow and still the
moan.
My fair, sweet flower! A throb of joy
Thrills through my bosom, how glad
am I,
Tho’ tears flow fast, and the spirit shrinks;
Love heareth the faintest, feeblest cry.
And the love that fashioned thee and me
Is Master of life and death, and all;
The Power that rules the Universe
Yet taketh note of a sparrow’s fall.
Suppose?
Suppose, by some mischance or power,
The earth should lose its precious dower
Of silver and of gold;
What consternation there would be,
What trouble in the currency,
What doleful tales be told!
But man would soon the loss survive,
And seek by other means to thrive,
And other wealth secure:
For gold and silver is not food:
Time’s re-adjustments would make good—
The world would still endure.


And then suppose, for argument.
The world’s supply of coal were spent:
’Twould be a serious thing;
But Mother Barth is rich and kind.
And Man a substitute would And,
And all the world would sing.
The flowers make the earth look gay,
But what would happen if some day
We missed their lovely hues?
There would be many wistful eyes.
And sorrow deep in hearts arise.
The cheerful blooms to lose.
But Man would still his way pursue,
And Earth would win her journey through.
And human nature rise
Above the loss. And time would heal,
And compensating joys reveal,
To gladden heart and eyes.
And if of Nature’s lavish store
She rendered us her fruits no more
Her luscious, juicy fruit—
Could aught their needful part supply
In food and drink? For Man would die
Without a substitute.
Oh, yes. The world of science then
Would render up its gifts to men,
The need to satisfy;
And time again would wear away
The sense of loss, and blithe and gay
The years would still roll by.


But, oh, if there should come a time
When o’er the earth should cease to shine
The all-preserving sun:
Then all the skill of Man would fail,
And science prove of no avail —
Life’s days would soon he run.
The whole round earth was made for man,
Built up upon a wond’rous plan,
And nothing good it lacks:
For all his body’s needs it yields
Abundance, and his ignorance shields
Along its shining tracts.
But life and death, growth and decay.
Are elements of every day
As long as it shall last;
And only Man can read the signs,
And see between the crossing lines
The future in the past.
And only Man lifts grieving eyes
Up towards the silent starry skies,
And feels within him move
A spirit alien unto death,
An instinct —true, his spirit saith
Which yet he cannot prove.
He has a nature not of earth,
A spirit of immortal birth,
The fact supreme is here:
For Man was made a living soul,
And Earth is not his final goal—
His native hemisphere.


As earth derives her quickening force
To yield her fruits, and run her course
From the effulgent sun:
So man depends on power benign,
He is linked up with life divine,
Through endless years to run.
The fleshly garb his spirit wears
Belongs to earth, and with it shares
The penalty of death;
But, like a prisoned bird set free,
The soul regains its liberty
With the departing breath.
And free at last from earth and time,
Begins to see the plan sublime
Of which he is a part;
And knows, with quick expanding mind,
How good, and wonderfully kind
The Great Creative Heart.
And if he looks again on earth,
From that dear country of his birth,
How will his bosom swell;
With every promise ratified,
And all his being satisfied,
He knows that it is well.
It was not needful he should see
Life’s meaning in its infancy;
The vision of the days
Unfold in proper order, while
The soul develops in the smile
Of God’s preserving rays.


Unavailing Grief.
Oh, cry, and cry, and cry your sorrow out!
And weep, and weep, and weep your
bitter tears!
Give freedom to the floods that rise within,
Ye have not felt such wholesome grief
for years.
Look on your dead, and mark the shrunken
frame,
See all the lines of sorrow on her face.
Deep set through many years; and think
how much
The heart endured ere it could leave
such trace.
Think of the deep, enduring love she
bore
To each and all of you; how patiently
She ministered to all your wants, and of
All comforts robbed herself unselfishly.
And you all let her do it. Nay, and
more—
You looked for her to do it, taking all
And giving nothing back. Oh, weep your
tears!
And Mother! Mother! Mother! vainly
call.
You never called on her in vain before.
So swift she was to come to your relief;
You always poured your troubles in her
ears,
You filled her heart with all your cares
and grief.


The tender, wistful, faithful mother love!
What have you given her in return?
The crown
Of her declining days—O bitter thought!
Was grief and unrequitted love. She
laid her down
In loneliness to sleep, or rose to work,
And turned her face to God for com-
fort, and
Sustaining grace to bear; her broken
heart
Making no sign that you could under-
stand.
No sign that you could understand, be-
cause
You never until now yourselves forgot
Enough to realize how much you owed
To her long-suffering love. Now she
is not
You recognise the debt, and fain would
pay,
And over her unconscious body moan;
And she is deaf to all your tears and cries.
The mother heart within her cold as
stone.
No gentle hands smoothed out the way for
her,
No loving heart planned any sweet sur-
prise;
No tender force was used to make her
rest
When it was needful. And, behold she
lies


Silent and restful, and the sad heart
is comforted, and wholly satisfied;
And you can grieve her tender soul no
more,
Nor give her now the love so long de-
nied.
Oh, cry aloud your deep, remorseful grief,
And weep, and weep, and weep your
bitter tears;
She cannot hear or see, it comes too late,
You cannot mend the selfishness of
years.
That care-lined face is all unmoved at last
At any cry of yours; the heart below
As cold as ice. Oh, it is meet that you
A bit of her heart craving need should
know.


A Dream.
I had a dream, a strange and awful dream.
It seemed that God had said the time
for grace was o’er,
And prayer no more availed; His ear was
closed
To all appeal from human lips for ever-
more.
Throughout the world, the direful news
was spread;
It flew from lip to lip, and all the people
heard;
And hearts grew strangely cold, and fear
gripped hard,
And everywhere the souls of men were
deeply stirred.
And few were glad. The scoffer’s tongue
was still;
And few went on their way indifferent
or unmoved;
Some did not understand, and yet were
sad;
The atmosphere was charged with fears
as yet unproved.
I watched to see the dread in faces grow,
Perplexity and grief, and no light any-
where;
How would the world, go on—so unpre-
pared,
That never knew till now how much
it owed to prayer?


A mother knelt beside her little child,
Her little dying child, and weeping bit-
terly.
Poured out in broken words her helpless
grief;
There was no single ray of hope that
she could see.
Afar at sea, a foundering vessel rolled
And plunged and tossed about, a help-
less, hopeless wreck,
In the black troughs made by the raging
seas
That raked and swept, and tore across
her quiv’ring deck.
And each poor soul that clung with stiff-
’ning hands
To the fast-parting planks, knew they
were near to death;
And no one heart held hope, save a young
lad’s,
Who knelt the while he prayed, with
sobbing breath.
He prayed aloud for comfort and for cour-
age.
And thought that God would hear, for
He was good and kind;
Then, all at once, remembered, he must
not pray—
And a wild scream of terror rose above
the wind.
A mournful group stood round an open
grave,
And bitter sobbing rent the silence of
the air;


No white-robed minister spoke tender
words
Of peace and consolation, or uplifting
prayer.
And over all there came a sense of help
lessness.
A dreadful sense of loss. The sky grew
leaden grey.
As though the sun had set, to rise no
more;
And the chief hope and stay of life
had slipped away.
There was no hope, no lightening of the
gloom,
And everything went wrong, and evils
multiplied.
Bad men grew worse, because restraint
was now removed,
And everywhere the song of joy and
gladness died.
There was no hope. The sick and aged
turned
Woeful, beseeching eyes to loved ones;
all in vain.
They had no words to raise their sinking
hearts,
Nothing beyond their present griefs
and weary pain.
I tried to think how would the world go
on,
Shut off from God and heaven? The
meaning o’er me broke


With such a sudden chill of black despair
That in my fear and grief I cried aloud,
and woke!
The great relief! the joy! ’twas but a
dream!
The sun flashed out again with radiat-
ing cheer;
God’s ear was open still, and the whole
world
Might lift their hearts to Him, and He
would hear.
’Twas but a dream. And earth to heaven
still
Was linked by love, and grace acces-
sible to man;
God’s kind, all-seeing eye watched o’er
His earth,
And faith from darkest depths—to Him
the way could span.


Dear Girl, Unto Yourself be Kind.
Dear girl, you ask for counsel wise.
You open up your heart to me —
At least as much as you can see—
And then you bid me to advise.
Your eyes look wistfully in mine;
The tremble of your lips betray
How much you fear what I may say,
And what ’twill be you half divine.
You half divine and half resent;
There is a conflict in your soul —
You cannot keep it in control.
Nor reason will to heart be bent.
To hide your thoughts you have not skill,
And I am glad you turn to me;
’Tis what your mother wished should be.
That I your mother’s place should fill.
Dear girl, I love you far too well
To wound your young heart needlessly,
Your happiness is dear to me.
And truth is sometimes hard to tell.
Oh! love is such a mingled cup
Of joy and pain; yet, oh, dear soul!
The joy should be both sweet and whole,
The pain not wholly pain to sup.


Dear one, why all this anxious fear?
If you have found the one true heart.
That of your life is counterpart,
And no one else can come so near?
Be brave. You have a tender soul.
Its depths you have not fathomed yet;
To what sweet notes attuned and set
You know not. Do not wreck the whole.
Love is to you a sacred thing;
Does he, your lover, hold it so?
You are not sure, you do not know
So lightly he of love can sing.
Love means to you so much! does he
So satisfy the best in you
That you hold closer all that’s true
Because of his sincerity?
No creature but has faults, dear heart,
But there are kinds ’tis well to fear;
Some faults to vices are so near
One cannot sunder them apart.
There is a bent in every soul
To higher or to lower things;
The spirit’s inner whisperings,
And it is under that control.
The spirit of the mind is shown
In many unconsidered ways;
A laugh, a jest, a tongue that plays
With sacred things in mocking tone.


Your woman’s soul has deeper needs
Than this your love can satisfy:
Does not your heart so testify?
It is your woman’s heart that pleads.
It is shut up within itself,
When in his presence you are placed;
Its sweetest springs are running waste.
He does not want its choicest wealth.
Nay, dear, he does not comprehend.
There is no spirit in him moves
In subtle harmony; the grooves
His feet are set in elsewhere tend.
You have a quiet, studious mind,
Deep thoughts and feelings in you move,
You see great things in life and love;
How will it be when you shall And
No outlet for these thoughts and aims,
No heart or ear to comprehend;
No kindred soul itself to lend,
Or even recognise your claims?
Your lover hates a serious thought.
He chides you in your serious mood;
His highest notion of life’s good,
Is, “Live, be merry, care for nought!”
Nay, he no more than you will be
Contented through the coming years;
He will not understand your tears,
When your heart yearns for sympathy.


Who blinds herself is wilful blind.
To try to cheat yourself is vain;
Your lover’s heart will whole remain.
Dear girl, unto yourself be kind.
Comforted.
Beside the cot of her darling,
With loving, anxious care.
The mother watched, and her anguish
Seemed more than she could bear;
The beautiful child was dying—
Beyond all earthly skill;
But who like a mother knoweth
How to suffer, and be still?
She stood by the little sufferer,
Outwardly calm; but, oh!
The soul must have dumbly uttered
Its pitiful cry of woe;
And He who heedeth the feeblest
Of all His creatures’ cry,
Who marketh the fall of a sparrow.
Heard that dear mother’s sigh.


And He gave her a sign of His presence,
A wonderful proof of love,
To comfort her in her sorrow.
And teach her of things above;
The eyes of her spirit were opened,
The chamber was lost to view.
Only the cot and her darling
Remained the same all through.
The valley of death was before her.
Not wide, but terribly deep;
The valley her child must pass through.
And the path was very steep;
She turned her eyes from its shadows,
To the little cot, and there
At the foot stood Jesus, waiting
For the child, so young and fair.
Past human tongue in telling was
The look of love he v^pre.
With arms outstretched, and facing her.
He slowly walked before;
And the child rose up and followed
With brave, unfaltering feet,
Her eyes fixed on the tender face,
In childish trust complete.
Down the rough pathway, and across
The small feet followed close;
Till, safely on the other side.
The little one uprose.
®
A
Then in His arms Christ lifted her.
With tenderest love and care,
And like a little tired dove
She nestled closely there.


And all the pathway up to heaven
Was crowded as they went.
With bands of white-robed angels,
Whose glad, bright looks were bent
On Him, whose shining feet had trod
This way so oft before,
And on the lovely little child, *
That in His arms He bore.
The mother watched, and waited till
Her child was lost to view
’Mid the throng of happy beings, as
They passed the heavens through;
And her sore heart was comforted,
“I know, ’tis well,” she said,
‘‘My child has gone to God in heaven,
The darling is not dead.”
Sorrow.
Alas! Alas! And must we lay her there?
The dear, dear little form that we have
cherished so,
The cold, damp eairth above, and the
colder damp below.


Oh, ’tis a foolish thought, but come it
will;
It is so hard, it is a bitter thing to do —
To leave her here alone, all the long night
hours through.
So gentle, and so fragile she has been,
That scarcely could she bear a little breeze
to blow
Upon her tender frame, she would droop
and suffer so.
Let be, why will ye chide? It is but
clay!
Oh, yes; I know; but I have held it next
my heart;
Tis part of mine own self—’tis a bitter
thing to part
Through nights and days of weariness
and pain,
I have held it in my arms, and held it
dearer
Than mine own life; and now, I cannot
come anear her.
Little hands and feet I have kissed so
Dear, sweet little mouth, ever ready with
a smile,
Though a tear might from the bright eyes
trickle down the while.
O precious little darling! I must weep.
Though it be sinful. I know the spirit
liveth
With the blessed one above, who all sin
forgiveth.


Lot be, why do ye chide? Do not I know
That she is safe from every ill that earth
may bring?
My tears will never hurt her; to me
they’re comforting.
I have not said I wish to have her back.
Nor do I grieve that she is now released
from pain;
I would not change the angel to the sick
child again.
But can it be I should not grieve to see
That precious little body, cold and silent
there;
No more to kiss and tend with a mother’s
love and care?
Behind the Clouds It is Blue.
A little child through the window looked
With anxious, wistful eye,
“Will it never stop raining. Mamma?” he
cried;
“Yes, darling; by and bye;
The clouds are breaking, look up, my
child,
The sun is peeping through;
And see, through the rift the sun has
made,
The sky is bright and blue,


The heavy clouds are passing away;
Have patience yet awhile;
The rain-soddened landscape will soon
break forth
Into a glad, bright smile;
And grass and herb and trbes and flower
Will fresher, fairer show.
When the sun shines out on them again,
’Tis the rain that makes them grow.”
The human heart has its rainy time,
When all the sky looks grey;
And the soal—chafing sorely beneath the
gloom,
Cries out in its dismay,
“Will cares never cease, or shadows lift?
Will life be dark all through?”
Oh, there in the clouds is a little rift,
And behind it is bright and blue.
Be patient, th£ sun shines all the time.
Tho’ clouds {nay hide its face;
The human heart that is ploughed by
storms
Shall gain in strength and grace.
And life shall bud and bloom anew
With biessings unforeseen;
And their roots strike deep in the fur-
rows where
The fiercest storm has been.


Emily.
Tho’ she is slumbering in the tomb,
And earthly tones may wake her not,
In memory’s chambers, to and fro
She walks and lingers, ne’er forgot.
Tho’ sometimes may the door be shut
The while life’s busy wheels go round.
Yet slightest touch and simplest word
Shoots back the lock with jarring sound.
I see her fair and pleasant face,
No gloom surrounded Emily,
And oft I seem again to hear
Her voice in some sweet melody.
She was so lovable and kind,
The children loved her—surest test;
But now her gentle hands are still,
And folded o’er her quiet breast.
Oh, she was very young to die;
’Twas very soon to fall asleep
And wake no more; who could resist
Regretfully o’er her to weep?
Yet there is comfort —she is spared
The many sorrows long life bring
The toil and conflict of the world
And its too often cruel sting.
Her body in its quiet bed
Lies undisturbed by joy or pain;
Her soul has reached the spirit land,
To qs is loss; to her is gain,


And she still lives; and oft it seems,
As tho’ we felt her loving touch;
And in faint echoes hear her voice.
In those sweet songs she loved so much.
In memory’s chambers, to and fro
She walks and lingers, lovingly
We hold each recollection there,
And write above them —-“Emily,’
Do Something!
Don’t always be talking of that which
you would do;
Make a start upon something you can
do just now;
For “would do’’ is vain if the “can do’’
is missing,
And “can do’’ and “will do” soon finds
the way how.
The soul that is alive to the needs of the
present,
And feels the importance of something
being done.
1
l
Yet goes on its way, vaguely planning and
wishing—
What good is it doing when nothing’s
begun?


How full is the world of men, and of
women.
With spirits so tempered, they weep
and deplore.
And speak with full hearts in soft, elo-
quent language.
Of works philanthropic, but—fail to do
more.
Their tongues are delusive, tho’ so tipped
with sweetness,
Their words, so expressive of feeling,
deceive;
'Tis in vain we look for some action to
follow,
Someday” they’ll do “something” they
fondly believe.
“Someday” and “something” they rest all
their hopes on,
With “someday” and “something” their
conscience they ease;
“Someday” and “something” is going to
work wonders—
Oh, there is none we despair of so
nearly as these!
They move in the foremost ranks of the
people.
In touch with the tongue, but not with
the hand;

They are loud in condemning injustice and
evil,
And cry with the true, “We must cleanse
our fair land!”


They will talk by the hour, and plan—
yea, for ever;
They have some fine schemes, but they’ll
never see light;
Nor the “someday” in which they intend
to do something
Is no day in nowhere, and nothing in
sight.
The Lowiv-horn Nobleman.
Some hold that noblemen are they
Whose birth has made them so;
Descendants of a highborn race,
Perhaps—and yet I know
That in the lower walks of life
Are men of low degree,
Whose lives and features bear the stamp
Of true nobility.
They may not wear the finest cloth,
Their hands may not be white.
Their grammar may not be correct.
And yet—if judged aright,
t
«
Their lives attest the upright heart,
The pure, and brave, and true,
The soul that stoops to nought unclean,
That sees, and dares to do,


Their lives are flecked with noble deeds
And acts of courtesy,
The ministering to their fellows’ needs,
When few are there to see;
Nor do they look for praise of men,
Nor yet expect return;
Duty and love together go
The while their bread they earn.
I know not of a nobler sight,
(And prove it wrong who can).
Than the daily life of such an one,
A lowly, noble man.
The men who boast of noble names,
Frittering life away,
The nobleman of high degree,
Is shamed by such as they.
Hidden Treasures.
All winter my garden was blighted
By the floods and the winds and frost;
So desolate, bare and unlovely.
All beauty and grace it had lost.
I looked at it often and sadly,
When, hid by the weeds, I espied
Some violets and little red daisies
Growing healthily, side by side.


I knelt down, and lovingly touched them.
So beautiful did they appear;
They lifted the clouds in a moment,
They held such a message of cheer.
Oh, dear little crimson-hued daisies
So ruddy and cheerful and bright,
Oh, sweet-scented azure-eyed violets!
Ye come like a song in the night.
Ye speak of the winter soon ended,
Yet tell of the springtime anear,
Joys past, and to come, are so blended,
Ye call forth a smile and a tear.
The Husband’s Little Request.
Always be cheerful, my dear.
Yea, always remember, my wife.
To look up gaily and smile,
And sing every day of your life.
Don’t be down-hearted, my dear.

And never, never be sad;
To see you look mournful and dull
Just makes me mad.

Walk about briskly, my dear.
And not as though you were tired;
Always have everything right,
For that is the chief thing desired.
Remember my likes and dislikes.
Strive always to save me pain;
We all have our ailments to bear,
So never complain.
And never get angry, dear.
No one should be angry but me;
Never distress me by tears,
For such it would vex me to see;
Be loving, sweet-tempered, and mild,
Patient, industrious, and meek;
And never raise question or doubt
Whene’er I speak!
Never get flurried, my dear,
For that is not good for the soul;
Always be calm in your mind,
And cultivate self-control.
If I should displease you in aught,
Never reproach me, my dear,
A look or a word of reproach
I ne’er could bear.
When I am tired, and, perhaps
A little bit cross (as, of course,
Men cannot help being, sometimes),
E’en tho’ I express it with force,

Don’t ever resent it, my dear,
Man, to his moods, must give vent;
And what place so safe as his home?
So never resent!

So always be cheerful, my dear.
Keep calm and contented and brave.
And ready to face life’s ills.
For a lot of distress it will save.
A woman should always be strong,
Whatever may happen—yea.
The wife of one’s bosom, my dear,
Shouldn’t give way!
Steady and faithful all through,
And careful, and frugal and kind,
Looking well to her household’s needs.
To the faults of her husband blind;
For that is your duty, my wife,
That is your mission, my dear;
Smoothing life’s pathway for me,
A true wife’s career!
