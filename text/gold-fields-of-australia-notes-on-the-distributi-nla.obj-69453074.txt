NOTES ON THE GOLD DISTRICTS
A U S T R ALIA,
CALIFORNIA, RUSSIA, VIRGINIA,
AND AMERICA.
� 1., INTRODUCTION ON THE GOLD QUESTION.
Prom the time when men bartered with each other, a
measure of value was set up, and is to be found in most
commonwealths or tribes, however rude. Whether this
measure have relation to a hundred oxen, a hundred slaves,
a hundred beaver skins, or a hundred cowries, the principle is
alike admitted. Whenever a state of advancement is reached,
and the metals are brought into use, we find the recognition
of a metallic currency, either of iron, or brass, gold or
silver, marked out by its intrinsic value and its great specific
gravity. As the production of other metals increased, gold
and silver became distinguished by their rarity, and acquiring
a higher relative value, became particularly fitted to serve the
purpose of a measure of value. Oxen had to be fed; death
made monthly inroads among them, and they could not be
readily transported to a distance, whereas gold and silver kept
their value, entailed no trouble for maintenance, and could be
carried from hand to hand. Thus a hundred pieces of metal
represented a payment with much more convenience than a
hundred head of oxen. The legends of individual nations
have assigned personages to whom the finding-out of money
has been given ; but in this, as in other things, it is much


more likely that each distinct race of men, kept apart from
each other by distance, made its own separate discovery, as,
according to its own local circumstances, it gave denomi-
nation to its measure of currency, or assigned its peculiar
representative.
The use of metals, and of the precious metals in a rude
form, as currency, must, in most cases, have preceded the use
of coined or stamped money. It is true a piece of metal
might be stamped with an ox, or some other emblem, and the
art of coining might date from as high a period as the other
formative arts; but there is much greater likelihood that it
was of the same time with the introduction of writing among;
o o
the several races, and which would be much later than
learning the use of metals. Thus it was only at a compara-
tively late date that the Syrian and Western Indo-European
tribes derived an alphabetic character from Egypt,'and it is
only within that period we find coined money coining into use;
and the like may be augured of the Chinese and others, having
a career of civilisation independent of the Western world.
In the present state of palaeethnology, we are obliged, from
the imperfection of our materials, to contemplate the history
of the world as simply affecting the Western nations, though
events of the same nature and importance as those which we
regard must have operated on the great empires of the East. It
is from this narrow point of view that we must regard the
particular history of these metals, as affecting the Western
nations, and Europe more especially. River washings there
can be no doubt were the chief ancient sources of gold, silver
and tin. Stream working could be rudely carried on in the
bed of the Phasis, or in the rivers of Spain and Cornwall, as
it is in this age in the streams and valleys of the Sacramento.
These workings were, however, more difficult to carry on, as
the metal washers, in a rude state, went through greater
hardships, and could less readily get food than even the
gold finders of California. The moment, too, that a gold-
finding became productive, then, as the Indians have done in
Sonora, in our days, wild tribes would pour down, strip the


miners, unci drive them away, but never set to work in their
stead : thus the sources of supply must have been precarious.
The Pheenicians seem to have been the earliest in our
western parts, who set themselves orderly to work to carry
out the mining of the precious metals on a great scale.
The Egyptians were contented with the supplies of gold
which they obtained from the mines of Nubia, and by
trading with the inland of Africa, for the gold dust found
by the blacks, then, as now, in the streams. They likewise got
by trade, gold, silver, and tin, from the east through the lied
Sea; in this, too, the Pheenicians competed with them ; and it
was perhaps to compete with them in the African gold trade
that the Pheenicians founded the settlement of Carthage, thereby
getting supplies of gold dust by the caravans over the desert of
Sahara. It was, however, to Spain that the Pheenicians directed
their chief efforts. The discovery of that great country, rich
in the precious metals, gave them an independent source of
supply. It may be, that the Pheenicians, like the Etruscans,
were members of the great Iberian, or Euskardian race, and
that they were drawn to Spain by ruder members of their
race, or to support some declining tribe, yielding before the
wild forefathers of the Basques, or before a Celtic invasion.
The towns the Phaenicians established on the sea shores
enabled them to protect their workings, and to throw in
supplies, and not only in the streams where they washed for
: gold and tin, but in the mines rich in silver and lead, they kept
thousands of slaves at work, under an armed force, thus
giving the example of that system which the after inhabitants
of the Peninsula applied in Peru and Brazil. It was only by
such means, by the application of rough and unrewarded
labour, and by the coercion and defence of an armed force,
that large workings could be carried on. The best known
ancient gold mines, besides those of Spain and Nubia, are
those of Mount Pangaeus in Thrace, of Thessaly, of Thasus
or Scaptesyle, Siphnos, Cyprus, Sardinia, of the country of
the Salassi, now Aosta, of the Alps from the streams of the
River Po, of Aquileia, of Illyria, of Armenia, Astyra near
Abydos, of the River Pactolus and Mount Tinolus near


Sardis, in Asia Minor. It was through the produce thus
obtained, that the nations on both shores of the Medi-
terranean Archipelago obtained that large supply of the
precious metals, which had so great an influence on their
advancing civilisation. It is true that individual adventurers
were ever ready to engage in enterprises which promised
wealth, and although the voyage of the Argonauts engaged
the best blood of Hellas, yet neither gold robbing nor gold
working enriched the nations of the west. At a later historical
period, military expeditions brought large supplies of the
precious metals into Europe, but there is no marked epoch of
prosperity which can be assigned to their influence.
In modern history the case has been different. It was
of little comparative importance that Columbus discovered
a new world, for Vasco de Gama had done that; but he
succeeded in the great end of all such expeditions of discovery,
the obtaining access to regions of gold and silver. The immense
quantities of these metals poured in from America, affected not
merely all the commercial transactions of Europe, but were
felt by the farmer in distant states, and the shepherd on
the hill side ; while a vast population pouring over the
western deep laid the foundation for new relations of
commerce. This discovery of the western world is a marked
epoch in the history of the world at a period when many
great events were concurring to influence the destinies of the
human race. The art of printing, the improvement of
navigation, the discovery of gunpowder, gave a fresh impulse
to the practical arts, while the restoration of ancient learning,
the toppling of the Aristotelean philosophy, and a greater
extension of religious liberty, opened to the mind for a time
a more independent action. On the English race in particular,
that epoch had a marked influence. In England and Scotland
English principles began to regain their ascendancy, and the
rights of freedom were restored, while our kindred in the
Netherlands obtained as great a measure of emancipation : at
the same time the Spanish and Gallic races were depressed by
the causes which elevated us.


It is interesting to look back and to make out the development
of events, but it is no less so to see them pass before our eyes ?
to be present and to take part in them, and we have now arrived
at a period far more important than that which we have just
contemplated. Circumstances external to those which we have
for our special subject and consideration, have been no less in-
fluential than they in giving it this character. The establish-
ment of the locomotive and the ocean steamer, the laying down
of the telegraphic wire, the discovery of electro-metallurgy, and
the application of the daguerreotype, create a new era in the
practical arts; but never, perhaps, has the progress of science
been more extraordinary. The advancement of the electro-
magnetic sciences, of geology, of ethnology, and of the econo-
mical sciences, has done much to liberate mankind from de-
pendence and dogmatism, and to direct them to original research,
while there have been those events in politics, in religion, and
in social economy, which show that some great action on the
human mind is in progress. At this time, when in addition to
the gold workings of Russia and Virginia, the discoveries in
California and Australia have opened a new field for enter-
prise, which has set the nations of the world in movement,
the position of the English race is still more striking than it
was three centuries and a half ago. By two great empires it
now keeps a great part of the world under its influence; on
the shores of the Atlantic, of the Pacific, and of the Indian
Ocean, our settlements are the means of awakening enterprise,
and give us the opportunity of profiting by each new event;
from the Icy Sea to the Gulf of Mexico, America belongs to
our people ; Australia we have encompassed, and marked out
its destinies, and in the south of Asia hundreds of millions
already own us as their masters.
Under these circumstances, it is not idle to speculate on
what is going on around us, and in what way we are likely to
be influenced. By events such as these, the destinies of men,
of households, of whole nations, are affected. Until the
expedition of Columbus, the lot of a Spaniard bound him to
the Peninsula; but from that time, the farthest regions of the


earth became a beacon to the wanderer. The mother found
her offspring listening to wonderful tales of new lands of
gold, which were to draw one son to Mexico, another to
Guiana, and another to Peru. Our people, born to enterprise,
\vhom neither the shores of Jutland, nor of this island could
keep in, spread themselves over the world ; and California and
Australia have given a new spur to emigration. The quick
invention of the poet, and the ready belief of rude
populations, never gave life to a tale so wonderful as that
of the city of St. Francisco. A Hindoo or a Tartar emperor
drew along with him the population of a metropolis in his
camp, but San Francisco became a settled city in a few
months, and by astonishing energy has maintained its existence
against chance conflagrations and the ravages of the incendiary.
A mighty commerce has been organised, traders and immigrants
resort from all parts of the world, and a line of powerful
steamers keeps up,constant and regular communication, bring-
ing it within the immediate influence of civilisation. What
the destinies of Australia may be, none can tell; but the
statesman, the merchant, the skilled mechanic, the under-fed
husbandman, and the starving beggar, alike turn their eyes
with eager glance on a scene teeming with brightest hopes:
nor is there any one, who, in the progress of these great
events, can feel assured that he will not be touched by
their operation, in his household, his connexions, and his
fortunes.
At the same time, though the action may be immense,
individual expectations may be overtasked. It is now known
that gold digging, however large, in its nominal returns, is
not, as a pursuit, more productive of net profit than others.
If, however, the labourer has to moderate his hopes, so has the
merchant. The like observations, which we made in 1849 as
to California, apply now to New Holland. The Geo-
graphical and Mineralogical Notes published in the former
year to accompany the Map of the Gold Regions of California,
contained such a sketch of the development of Californian
prosperity, as experience has proved. It was then said, ? Our


fathers* watched the progress of America?we ourselves have
seen that of Australia, but the opening of the Pacific is one
of the greatest events in social history, since, in the fifteenth
century, the East Indies were made known to Europe; for we
have not, as in America or Australia, to await the slow growth
of infant settlements, but to witness at once the energetic
action of countries already in a high state of advancement.
Ihe eastern and western shores of the great ocean will now
be brought together, as those of the Atlantic are, and will
minister to each other?s wants. A happy coincidence of
ciicumstances has prepared the way for these results; every-
thing was ready; the word only was wanted to begin, and it
has been given.? How well this description has been justified
by subsequent operations, all will bear witness.
We did not, however, stop with this general prediction, but
went further to point out the details. ? The outflowings of
Chinese emigrants and produce, which have gone towards the
west, will now move to the east. The commercial enterprise
of Australia and New Zealand has acquired a new field of
exercise and encouragement; the markets which Chile and
1 cru have found in Europe only, will be opened nearer to
their doors; the north-west shore of America will obtain all
the personal and material means of organization; the islands
of the Pacific will take the place in the career of civilisation,
for which the labours of the missionary have prepared them ;
and even Japan will not be able to withhold itself from the
commonwealth of nations. All this is worth more to our
merchants and manufacturers, and to the people employed by
them, than even the gold mines can be, for this is the
statement of certain results ; and the workings of the gold
mines, however productive they may prove, must be attended
with all the incidents of irregularity and uncertainty, and
great commercial disadvantages. The sketch given above, of
the organization of the Pacific, shows how necessary it is to
modify the views of those who think we either shall, or can

derive great immediate results from California. It is fortunate
for us it is not so. We shall trade with California and the
Oregon, it is true, but we shall do much more in the increased
trade with Valparaiso, Callao, Matanzas, Honolulu, Shanghae,
Hong Kong, Canton, Singapore, Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide, Launceston, Hobart Town, Wellington, and
Auckland. Already these markets feel the movement ?new
goods must be sent out, and in the improvement of these
markets we shall have further guarantees of permanent
prosperity.?
That Chinese emigration has filled San Francisco with an
industrious population ; thousands have migrated from
Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart Town, and Wellington; Chile
has been enormously enriched by her exports of flour to
California; Hawaii from merely exciting interest, as an example
of Kanaka advancement, has become a state of importance;
the New York and London shippers to San Francisco have
been seriously disappointed ; but an enormous and profitable
trade has been carried on with the South Pacific.
The present position of Australia admits the application of
the like observations. A civilised population is on the
borders of the gold beds, trained miners are to be had from
the copper shafts of Burra Burra and the coal-pits of
Newcastle, while every facility is presented for throwing in a
flood of immigrants. To California, the passage round Cape
Horn was a long and dear one ; to Australia it is shorter, and,
being better organised, it is cheaper. The overland transit of
the isthmuses to California was beset with difficulties; a steam
line, however, already girds the Australian shore, and the
great ocean ships now approach it at the Cape of Good
Hope, Singapore, Panama, and Valparaiso. Thus a slight
exertion of enterprise will place Sydney in union with London.
The political circumstances affecting the South Pacific are,
perhaps, even more favorable than those connected with the
North Pacific. California stood almost alone, with Oregon
7 o
undeveloped, and Vancouver?s Island only just occupied; but
the Australian settlements form a chain of thriving provinces,


including Moreton Bay, New South Wales, Victoria, Tas-
mania, South Australia, and Western Australia. Close at
hand is New Zealand, which, with Tasmania, will, in case of
need, supply those provisions for the gold mines which San
Francisco received from Valparaiso and Shanghae. Valparaiso,
the great English emporium in the South Seas, and all the
harbours of Chile and the South American coast, are more
accessible to Australia than to California. The position of
China as a source of immigration is more favorable for Sydney
than its northern rival ; and the events now taking place in
China, where a new emperor besets the south, are likely to
render even the wealthy classes of Qwang-tung and Fokien
disposed to emigration. The coolies of Hindostan can, if
there be need, be made as available for the English settle-
ments in New Holland as for Mauritius or the West Indies;
thus, there can be no fear of the want of working population
for the mines ; or of shepherds for the wool stations, and
indeed, the finding of the gold works has already borne
this good that it has stopped the large immigration to
California, which from Sydney alone was at the rate of
3,500 yearly, the passages from England of most of whom
had been already paid from the land-fund of the colonies they
abandoned. Immigration has indeed begun from San Francisco.
The wool and other business of New Holland may be
deserted for a time; but there can be no lasting want of cheap
and plentiful labour, A short spell at gold digging will
sicken most men of the calling; and they must fall back on
the staple trade of the settlement, or they must starve. There
will, moreover, be the means of importing not only the
Araforas and the Maoris for shepherds, but the Chinese and
the Hindoos; and it may be found useful to remove to New
South Wales some of the Cape Caffres.
The one fear for New Holland is from the convicts; but even
the gold finding meets the convict question. No more convicts
can now be sent to New Holland : not only is the voice of the
settlers given against it, but neither convicts nor keepers can
be trusted so near the gold lands. As for the emancipists and
ticket-of-leave men, to some the gold diggings will open a new


path of life; but there is no ground for the same fear of them
as in California, There they had no government to contend
with, and the rowdies of the old world and the new, to shelter
their misdeeds; but in New Holland it is otherwise : there is
a strong community and a strong government; and the forms
of the constitution and of law do not in this case give a
shield to sham citizens. The murderer cannot be acquitted
by a coroner and jury who turn round from the gambling
table to make a sham investigation; nor can a mock corpo-
ration or legislature be set up at the will of outcasts, having
nothing of citizenship but the name. Already it appears
likely that the Governor>General will be able, by means of a
system of legal licensing, on a moderate scale, to obtain funds
for the maintenance of order, and to protect for the workman
the fruits of his labour; and as the Imperial Government
has relinquished all claim to the monies received for mining
licenses, a large fund, for the purposes of emigration, will be
placed at the command of the Colonial Legislature.
In considering the probable effect of the gold diggings on
existing interests, many circumstances have to be taken into
consideration, which will certainly benefit them in consequence
of the gold diggings. Thus, already, the home government
have been spurred up to push on the arrangements for ocean
steam communication, and this question has been greatly
advanced. The convict agitation may likewise be considered
as virtually settled. The introduction of a greater population
will give a value to stock and sheep for meat which they do
not now possess, and which will go to meet enhanced charges.
While the freight of treasure and the greater chance of
passengers make ocean steam navigation more feasible, so
likewise are greater facilities offered for home communication.
The Sydney railway will now undoubtedly be pushed, and
the more particularly as the land-sales and other revenues of
the province are likely to be accelerated ; and roads will be
opened to the upland, which will give greater vent for the
transport of wool and other produce to the shipping harbours
on the shore. So, too, the steam navigation of the Murray,
which has long been wished for, is likely to come into operation.


} 2. GEOLOGY OF GOLD.
Gold is more abundantly found in quartozc, and slaty rocks
of high antiquity, particularly in those called Silurian by
Murchison, which lie in contact with granite, porphyry, and
other eruptive rocks. It is not, however, in such solid rocks
when in their original position, that the richest gold mines have
prevailed, but only in their debris or gravel, as spread out on
the flanks of the mountains. Emery and quicksilver are
frequently found in gold countries.
It is considered by some, that gold is not to be found
as an ore, chemically united with other elements, but always
in a native or pure state, even if mechanically combined
with platinum, silver, palladium or other allied metals.
When in rock, it is therefore found in grains, thin leaves,
knobs, or even great lumps, from a grain barely to be seen,
to lumps which have been met with above one hundred
pounds weight, and worth some 4,000 sovereigns. The
gold may be either spread everywhere, and mixed up
throughout the rock, or it may be in veins or lodes, spreading
about like the twigs of a tree ?here thickly, there scantily.
As connected with the primary formations, gold veins are
sometimes found in situ; but it is only in a few districts that
they are worth working; for when followed as a mining
operation, the yield of mineral is small, even if the worth is
great. It is for this reason that the gold veins in the older
rocks of our islands are not wrought, as a mass of mineral
must be powdered up, more than the returns will pay. Thus,
Merionethshire and Wicklowshire have yielded no permanent
results. Indeed, although gold veins are worked in many places,
it is chiefly in the Brazils, Siberia, California and Australia
that gold has been found worth working on a large scale.
It is to the heaps of old detritus, resulting from the
breaking down of mountain sides by former great convulsions,
as well as to the banks of the rivers which flow through such
accumulations , that we have to look for the most profitable
supplies of gold. There, instead of hard rock, soft sand and
gravel have to be searched, and the gold is often thrown toge-
ther under natural arrangements; while there is a better pros-


pect of getting on a bunch of lump of rich ore. The gold-
bearing rivers may be within the primary formations, or flow
beyond them; but they derive their chief supplies from the
heaps, and hills of old drift, orginally formed out of the older
rocks. A grand error in all ages, and which has often diverted
attention from stream washing, has been the constant endeavour
to seek in the mountains for the ?mother supply? of gold*. These
researches have very seldom succeeded, because the object of
search was beyond reach, the assumption of some large concen-
trated mine being false. On piercing the rocks, the superficial
supply has generally been found scanty, and those who hence
attempted deep workings, in the hope of reaching better veins,
have been disappointed, because the gold seems to be chiefly
distributed superficially.
A drift, resulting from the former abrasion of the surface
of gold-bearing rocks, is a natural mining operation,
which was carried out upon a large scale, thousands of
years ago; and so far as the superficial supplies of gold are con-
cerned, it is likely to be more productive than any immediate
working in the rocks. A gold drift is, indeed, the result of
a gigantic gold washing; and credulity might well dream it
to be the labour of elfin workmen. By the action of ancient
convulsions, and floods in the high mountain regions, the pri-
mary rocks were worn down, and the rubbings or detritus are
now carried through the watercourses which drain the
upper districts. The amount of this detritus is enormous;
though the amount of gold found will not be in pro-
portion to the local deposit of detritus, but to the whole
amount of detritus which has been carried over the spot from
the time the scouring of the mountain sides began. The
whole amount of detritus will, it is true, be carried down the
valley, and some part into the sea; but the gold, in virtue of
its greater weight, will, in a river of any length, be deposited
far above the sea estuary. Thus, the accumulations of gold
in the whole water basin must relatively be large, as the result
* The Quartz veins in the Mariposa district of California are examples
of superficial workings in the solid rock.


either of the former great drifts, or of a constant and long-
continued action or washing of those ancient deposits.
In many cases, although the upper sand of the river bed
may show no token of gold, yet it may be found plentifully
below, where the coating of sand is thick, or the washing of
the flood is deep. The deeper the gully the greater the
chance of a deposit, and in such places the diving bell has
been used with success.
The same cause which restricts the gold deposits to the
water basin, further heaps it up on given spots. It may be
there are several of these in -the course of a river, and the
deposits on each spot may be more or less thickly spread; but
every natural bar which dams the waters, will likewise dam
the gold ; and it is at these places, and above them, the gold
will be mostly found, though mountain freshes will some-
times sweep gold to a further barrier. In these natural divi-
sions, the gold will be found heaped together against a ledge
of rocks, or spread for miles along the banks, where the
stream is sluggish. In some parts, the gold is to be met with
resting on a bed of rock, in others mixed up with the gravel,
at the lowest bound to which the action of the river flow or
freshets reach. Local observation directs the miner to the
most likely place for finding the gold; but wherever met with,
it is in the same condition as if obtained from crushing the
rock, namely ?pure, and in dust, scales or lumps.
A distinction may be drawn between ancient deposits
and new deposits. In ancient deposits, the gold is often
found in what are no longer the watercourses of the quartz
or granite mountain chains. A distinction of this kind is
perhaps the basis for the difference between what in California
are called the dry diggings and the wet diggings; though the
dry diggings have been considered by some as less productive.
The dry diggings are in the old drift on the higher banks,
the wet diggings in the beds of the rivers; but then it is to
be observed in this case, what are called the wet diggings
really include the old and new deposits together ; and being on
the site of the old watercourses, which pass through the


ancient heaps of gold drift, expose all the richest materials
of the whole period of natural gold accumulation.
On the discovery of gold deposits in a given spot, it
cannot be safely assumed that the whole water basin below
will produce gold. Gold is found in the Goomty, at the foot
of the Himalayas; but it is not therefore to be looked for in
the Hooghly, a thousand miles below. In such a distance, the
bulk of the gold will be deposited at each fall or natural weir,
and but a small surplus can be available for a distance ;
besides, there is good reason for believing, that when once the
low and flat lands are reached, a few miles of sluggish river
will thoroughly sift from gold all the detritus brought down
from above. For these reasons, the lower valleys of the
Murray are only likely to have gold deposits in virtue of
ancient geological operations, as it is little likely any gold can
be carried from the junction of the Darling to Lake Alex-
andria. Gold exists in the South Australian formations,
near the mouth of the Murray, as it does in those of New
South Wales, at its head ; but any gold in the intermediate
spaces, is more likely to be found in the side creeks and
feeders, than in the main stream. The deposits do not, indeed,
depend upon the rivers, but on the mountain chains which
contain gold-bearing rocks.
� 3. SYSTEM OF GOLD-WORKING.
For gold workings, there are three chief methods, ?wash-
ing, crushing, and mining,?dependent on the locality in
which the gold is found; washing being applied to sands,
crushing or stamping, and mining, to rock formations.
Gold-washing or streaming is a rude operation, much the
same everywhere, or rather, varying only according to the
extent of labour and the degree of co-operation acquired.
Thus, the black on the Niger, the Hindoo on the Goomty,
and the Englishman on the Sacramento or Murray, works
singly in the same manner, digging and turning over small
portions of sand ; but some of these latter, banding together,
form companies, which obtain more powerful washing ma-


chines, or which, occupying a larger district, dam up or
divert the mountain streams. Still, the operation of washing
rests on the same basis. It must, too, be carried on upon the
spot, because the yield of gold being small to the bulk of
earth, the sand can never be carried profitably to a distance.
The gold being always found in a state nearly pure, and of
high specific gravity, by its greater weight is readily separable
from the earth or sand in which it is mixed, and on being well
washed, even in the palm of the hand, will leave behind the
metallic particles. The collecting of the sand, and the wash-
ing, therefore constitute the whole operation; and in the
beginning of the new discoveries, we find men working with
clasp knives and wash-basins, for want of better tools.
In the more advanced stages of working in California, how
ever, picks, and spades, and wheelbarrows are brought into
play, by which labour is made more effective. It does some-
times happen that the digger is rewarded with a lump of gold
which, being of ten, twenty, forty, or fifty pounds weight,
may at once yield him five hundred, a thousand, or two thou-
sand pounds; but most commonly the gold must be obtained
by washing, being really in dust or scales.
In some of the rude districts of Hindustan, pans and win-
nowing baskets are still used for washing; but where parties
are organized, even there a ?cradle? or washing machine
is then employed. One reason, perhaps, why the attention of
the Americo-English was not more strongly called to gold-
streaming is, because the gold-hunters of Virginia worked
singly, and the yield was so inconsiderable as to leave little
profit. So it is in those districts of India where the sands are
poor, and the washing is carried on singly. The cradle,
however, affords a great economy of labour; and thereby
sands can be washed which would otherwise take an enormous
period to sift. Some formations are, nevertheless, rich ; and
in the early period of the Californian workings, Mr. Sinclair,
an old settler, set fifty Indians to work on the North Fork
of the Sacramento, with native-made willow baskets, and yet
he got about cCCOO or <�*7oo weekly.


The cradle is very simply arranged. In its primitive form,
as used by the Chinese in Borneo, the Hindoos in the Uekkan, or
the English in Australia and California, it is a box on rockers,
and six or eight feet long, open at the foot, and having at its head
a coarse grate or sieve. In the early Californian cradles the
bottom was rounded, and nailed across with small cleats.
This kind of machine will employ four men?one digger or
excavator, to raise the sand; another to carry it to the grate
of the cradle; a third to rock or shake it violently; and a
fourth to pour on water; but now the mechanical arrange-
ments are still further improved. The use of the sieve is to
keep the coarse stones from going into the cradle, while the
current of water washes away the earthy matter, and the
gravel is gradually swept out at the foot of the machine,
leaving the gold mixed with a heavy, fine black sand, above
the first cleats. The sand and gold mixed together are
then taken away, and the sand being dried, is blown away,
the gold remaining free behind. The gold thus obtained is,
according to quantity, put in quills, bottles, or bags. Cradles
of large size in California have peculiar names. A cradle 9or
10 feet long is called a Long Tom, but some use the Virginia
Burke Rocker, employing quicksilver to amalgamate the gold*.
It will be perceived that the cradle is only carrying out the
process which nature has pointed out. As the gold thinly dis-
seminated in the rocks is washed out of the rubbings of the
primary formations, and carried down the rivers until it
lodges against some bar or ledge, where its greater weight
causes it to fall to the bottom of the sand or river bed, so is
the gold sand passed through the cradle, and the gold is
lodged against the cleat or bar of the cradle, the gold being
always at the bottom of the stream, and only able to pass in
suspension when mixed up with a quantity of lighter mineral.
Washing tables are used in Siberia ; but gold machinery does
not admit of much complication. The use of the diving bell
is but sparing as yet, but it is likely to lead to great results.
* Quicksilver mines exist at New Almaden, in California, and the
gold of California and Australia will be supplied with quicksilver for
amalgamation at cheaper rates, and quicker than from the mines of Europe.


From the description of the operations, it will be seen that
the effectiveness of the work depends wholly on the quantity
of rude labour employed, and that it is only suited to canal
diggers, excavators, and miners. With others it can be but
a matter of gambling; for, wanting the bodily strength
needful to get through the steady work, they hunt about for
gold in the hope of getting a lump which may make them
rich for a time, though it cannot be for long, as the gambling
itch which led to this gold hunting, leads them to stake their
winnings at the play-table, and they have to begin their
wanderings and hardships anew.
It may, however, be said that there is another condition
which admits of gold washing, and that is, where a slave, as
in the Brazils, or ill-fed Hindoo, works for a bare subsistence.
This, however, seldom yields an income to a master, or revenue
to the tax-gatherer; and the whole yearly produce of such
labours is always inconsiderable, being perhaps a few thousand
pounds for a large district.
In the case of quartz crushing, which is chiefly carried on
in California, it is applied to rocks in which the gold is more
or less thickly spread about; and the purpose of crushing or
stamping is to reduce it to the condition of sand for streaming,
so that, being washed like the gold sands, the rock may be
swept away, and the gold left behind. This allows of a still
greater application of mechanical power, because it is worth
while to carry the ore some distance to the stamping machine,
whereas, though the cradle may be taken from one washing to
another, yet the bulk of the cradle is kept down by this
condition of being removed ; the stamping engine, however, can
work for a large district round. In California it has been
found worth while to set up steam engines, supplied with fuel
from the neighbouring pine woods, or with Vancouver Island
coal, but the chief difficulty is in getting together workmen to
keep the engines in repair. Whether steam engines can be so
worked in the inland of Australia is not as yet known,
for, though coal is worked on the shore at Newcastle, the
land journey to the diggings would be too costly. If, how-


ever, gold working could be established low down on the
Murray, then coal from Van Dieman?s Land could be steam-
towed up the river as far as the junction of the Murray and
the Darling, and perhaps higher.
The crushing is applied to superficial rocks which are seen
to have gold sparkling in them, and which are broken off by
picks, or blasted with gunpowder. This kind of work is
therefore very much like what is carried on in Cornwall, and
fitted for such a population.
Gold mining is carried on in the common way, by driving
shafts, galleries and levels on lodes and veins of the ore; but
which, being very narrow, seldom pay for the working,
though a chance lump or pocket will sometimes encourage
working for a time. As the lodes are subject to the contin-
gencies of other lodes, the mineral vein is often found to run
down poor, or to be broken off. The ore when obtained is
broken up, crushed, and washed, to obtain the gold by its
greater weight. Amalgamation with quicksilver is sometimes
resorted to, but is most commonly applied in reducing
silver.
� 4. THE GOLD MONETARY QUESTION.
While the penniless look with hope on California and New
Holland, the wealthy hear of them with dread. To the
former they hold forth the chance of getting money, to the
latter, fear that the value of their stores will be diminished.
Among the many extraordinary incidents connected with the
Californian discoveries, was the alarm communicated to many
classes; which was not confined to individuals, but invaded
governments. The first announcement spread alarm ; but, as
the cargoes of gold rose from a hundred thousand dollars to a
million, bankers and financiers began seriously to prepare for an
expected crisis. In England and the United States the panic
was confined to a few; but on the continent of Europe every
government, rich or poor, thought it needful to make pro-
vision against the threatened evils. An immediate alteration
in prices was looked for; money was to become so abundant,


that all ordinary commodities were to rise, but more especially
the proportion between gold and silver was to be disturbed,
some thinking that the latter might become the scarcer
metal. The governments of France, Holland and Russia
in particular turned their attention to the monetary
question, and in 1850 the government of Holland availed
itself of a law which had not before been put in operation, to
take immediate steps for selling off? the gold in the Bank of
Amsterdam, at what they supposed to be the then highest
prices, and to stock themselves with silver.
This operation was carried on concurrently with a supply
of bullion to Russia for a loan, a demand for silver in
Austria, and for shipment to India, and it did really produce
an effect on the silver market, which many mistook for the
influence of California. The particular way in which the
Netherlands operations were carried out was especially calcu-
lated to produce the greatest disturbance of prices. The
ten florin gold pieces were sent to Paris, coined there into
Napoleons, and silver five franc pieces drawn out in their
place. At Paris the premium on gold in a few months fell
from nearly 2 per cent, to a discount, and at Hamburgh a like
fall took place. In London, the great silver market, silver
rose between the autumn and the new year from ss. per oz.
to ss. l|d. per oz., and Mexican dollars from 4s. to
4s. ll|d. per oz.; nor did prices recover until towards the
end of the year 1851, when the fall was as sudden as the rise.
As yet the large importations from California have produced
no effect on prices, because the operations of California have
opened a vent for a considerable portion of the Californian
bullion. In California a large amount was kept in stock,
and a large amount was wanted for currency, prices being so
enhanced. The trade created in the Pacific likewise took off?
a large amount of Californian bullion, which was absorbed
into the currency. In Chile alone the value of imports to
California was very large, and was paid for in gold ; indeed
the gold of California went to every market of the Pacific,
and gold dust was soon regularly quoted in Valparaiso, Lima,

Tacna, Canton and Madras. The same cause has operated
with the Australian importations. As no mint exists in
Australia, a large amount of coined metal has been sent from
England to purchase gold, and to meet the requirements of
the extended trade.
Europe and the United States were capable of taking a
large amount of bullion for currency, as the banks held
stocks below their full amounts; but it was noticed, that
throughout 1850 and 1851, the general stock of bullion in
the banks did not show any increase corresponding to the
exports from California. Political distrust has caused hoarding
in some districts, while in some others, where a paper currency
does not prevail, greater social prosperity has created a demand
for more bullion, besides the demands for purposes of luxury.
Thus, hitherto, the supply of California has met with a ready
circulation, but in a time of full confidence and steady peace
the results would have been otherwise.
Of the total yearly yield of gold no accurate estimate can
be made. In 1800 the whole yield of gold and silver was
estimated at <�*10,250,000. The following is an estimate of
the yield of gold and silver for each of the following years:
Gold. Silver. Total.
1840 ... �5,000,000 ... �6,750,000 ... �11,750,000
The whole stock of bullion of gold and silver now in
circulation, is estimated by various economists at �400,000,000,
but complete data are wanting.
The chief supplies of gold are, at present, from California,
about 65 per cent.; from Russia, 10 per cent.; Australia 20
per cent.; Australasian Archipelago, 2 per cent.; Mexico and
South America, 3 per cent.
$ 5. GOLD IN EUROPE.
The supply of gold from Europe has never been great. In


the earliest historical period, some small amounts were obtained
from river washings, for a long time, from Spain ; but at the
present day, the only scanty supplies are from mine workings.
In England, small particles of gold are sometimes found in
the Cornish mines and tin streams, at Carnon Vale and at
South Molton, in Devon, and in Wales they are found dissemi-
nated among the rocks in Merionethshire and elsewhere ; but
hitherto gold has not been considered worth working ?silver
being the only precious metal obtained to any extent, and
that of late years only. The gold ornaments of the Iberian
and British chiefs, found in tombs, are supposed to have
been got from river washings, and being rare, it is not
thought that gold was at any time found on a large scale here.
From the Cwmhusian mines in Merionethshire, seven pounds
weight of gold have lately been obtained. Gold is said to
have been found at Pollux Hill in Bedfordshire, at Little
Taunton in Gloucestershire, and on Sheepstor, Dartmoor,
and near South Molton in Devon. Of the gold of the Lead-
hills, in the south of Scotland, worked under the Scottish kings,
there are specimens in the British Museum.
The only remarkable gold district in Ireland is on the
cast shore in Wicklow. The richest deposit, as usual, was
found on the banks of the rivers, an accidental discovery
being made in the Ballinvalley streams at Croghan Kinshela,
in 1796. The total value raised did not probably exceed
oPI 0,000, and was soon worked out. Attempts were
made to carry on gold mines in the primitive formations, but
they did not pay. In Croghan Moira mine, about seven
miles from Kinshela, gold was likewise found in small quatities.
Indications of gold are said to have been found in the Miola
rivulet in Ulster, and in the Shannon at Inchmore.
In France, gold is likewise found at Gardette in the Isere,
but not in sufficient quantity to pay the expense of working.
In the rivers of the Rhone, Rhine, and Garonne, there is
auriferous sand, and in those of the mountains of Cevennes
and Languedoc.
The rivers of Spain and Portugal?more particularly the


Tagus, Douro and Darro?have gold sands; but they are not
now wrought. At Adissa, in the St. �bes district, a gold
mine was for some time worked : the produce in 1815 was
4-1 lbs.; 1816, 18 lbs.; 1817, 11 lbs.; 1818, 12 lbs.; 1819
13 lbs.; 1820, 12 lbs.; 1821, 18 lbs. The total value of
the produce in seven years was only about <�sooo. In
Arragon, Leon, Andalusia, Granada, and Galicia, are gold
mines. It is probable dry diggings may be found in Spain.
The mine of Domingo Flores, in Leon, was worked from
1639 to 1749. At Culera in Gerona is gold quartz.
Except in the Alpine regions, no considerable traces of gold
are found in Italy ; nor are there any workings. There are
no traces of gold in Italy. In Savoy, it is reported river
deposits have been lately discovered; and gold is said to be at
the foot of Mount Rosa. In Sicily, a mine, stated to have
been formerly worked for gold, lies in the mountains north-
west of Taormina. Pesterana, in the Alps, is one of the oldest
gold mines?the gold being scattered in sulphuret of iron.
In Germany and the Germanic states, gold has been
found in many localities, and was formerly extracted to a
great extent in Bohemia. It is also obtained from the
Hartz, the Mulda, Bavaria, and Baden. Gold is got from
the arsenious ores of Silesia. In Hungary, gold is raised
from the mines of Schemnitz and Kremnitz ; being the
richest for this mineral in Europe. The yield is taken at
1050 lbs. of gold yearly, worth �35,000. In 1848,
40 lbs. of gold was found in granite, in Salzburg, and 3 lbs.
in Illyria. Transylvania is another rich district, and yields
1375 lbs, of gold yearly. In the Banat of Temeswar, 60 lbs.
of gold was obtained in 1848. The gipsies are the chief
gold washers. One estimate of the whole produce of gold in
Austria is 4000 lbs. yearly ; and in twenty-six years, 85,000 lbs.
In Bohemia are gold washings on the Iser. In Salzburg are
gold mines, which yielded 35 lbs. of gold yearly. In the
Tyrol are gold washings, two miles from Zell. In the
Danube are washings between Vienna and Pesth.
'ln Sweden there are several gold mines. That of Adelfors,


in Smaland, formerly yielded 15 to 20 lbs. of gold yearly;
but now, it is said, only lor 2 lbs. The working began in
1758. The Fahlun mines yield about 2 lbs. yearly. Gold is
here found with copper, as in Cornwall. In Norway is the
gold mine of Edswold, in the llommarge district. Stream
washing does not seem to have been tried in Scandinavia. At
Kongsberg, in Norway, gold has been found, which was
coined by Christian IV. The lode is found in quartz.
Turkey has gold in several districts. The best known
deposit is that of the river washings in Bosnia, where it is
found among sand and pebbles; but the country is so dis-
ordered that no gold is produced. It is likewise found in
Thrace, Macedonia, and at Siderocapso, near Salonica.
Cyprus and Thasus have been already mentioned.
In Russia, the chief gold deposits are on the Asiatic side
of the Ural Mountains; but in 1739 a gold mine was found
and worked in Olonetz.
The total produce of Russia from Europe and Asia, was,
in the beginning of this century, estimated at 42,675 lbs., or
about <�1,800,000 yearly. In 1830 the amount was estimated
at 15,000 lbs., and at the like amount in 1831; in 1835, at
12,280 lbs.; in 1842, at 41,000 lbs.; in 1843, at 55,000 lbs.;
in 1847,13,300 lbs.; in 1848, 75,600 lbs.; in 1849, 69,6001b5.
The production of gold in Russia in 1847, was about
�4,000,000; in 1848, something more; and in 1849, about
�3,500,000.
� 6. SIBERIAN GOLD REGIONS.
The chief Russian gold districts are two?those of the Ural
chain on the west, and those of Nertchinsk and Kholivan,
in the Altai, on the east. The resemblance of the Ural district
to California is remarkable, and has been pointed out by
several eminent men. The workings are stictly gold diggings,
with one small exception near Ekterinburg. The ancient
gold drift has been spread over a surface of many square
miles, in the basins of the rivers Grande Birussa, Upper


1 ongooska, Ooclerei, and Pile, in the Yenissei province
of Siberia. With the exception of the districts belonging
to the imperial mines of Kholivan, Voskressensk and
Nertchinsk, and the country beyond the Lake Baikal,
the gold findings throughout Siberia are thrown open to
private enterprise. The chief discoveries in this district were
made in 1829; hut being under regulation, they did not give
a general stimulus to gold washing. That was reserved for
California.
The following shows the gradual produce of gold from
Siberia.?
1829 ... 55 lbs. 1837 ... 5,828 lbs.
1830 ' .. 465 1838 .. 8,460
1831 ... 453 1839 ... 8,025
1832 ... 965 1840 ... 11,202
1833 ... 1,600 1841 ... 15,720
1834 ... 2,871 1842 ... 27,732
1835 ... 4,054 1843 ... 40,868
1836 ... 4,610
The difference between these amounts and the totals before
on, will pietty nearly represent the cold nrodnm tli..
gi\cn, will pretty nearly represent the gold produce of the
Ural at the several periods.
$ 8. GOLD IN ASIA AND AUSTKALASIA.
Ihe gold districts of Asia are chiefly those of Siberia,
already described.
In Hindostan, gold is found in several regions, and it may
be said in every river system. In the basin of the Indus,
between Attock and Kalabagh, 300 people are employed in
washing the sands, the gold being chiefly in flattened grains
or scales, and yielding 2,000 oz. yearly. In the basin of the
Ganges gold is found, as in the Goomty, Ramgunga, and other
rivers at the foot of the Himalayas, where washings are carried
on. Native gold is here likewise found in the gneiss, which
is traversed by veins of granite, and distinctly stratified. On
each coast, and in the heart of the Dekkan, gold is found
and woiked in several localities. Among these may be enume-


rated the river workings of the Paliaur and Poniaur, rivers
in eastern Mysore; of Nolampoor, Kapoor, Srussumjee,
Polwye, Tirumpaddy, and other rivers in Calicut and on the
Malabar coast; of Malapuram in Nedingabad ; of Kadala-
onely and Parpanangady, on the south shore in Shernaad;
of Kahil, Aripanad, and the Tirumaly Hills, besides twenty
river works in the Ernaad district. Of these latter, the yield
was 62 lbs. in 1834*.
Gold is further found in our Assam provinces, the river
sands being washed. The yield is said to be about 38,000 oz.
yearly.
In China, gold is worked in the river sands of Sechuen and
of Yunan, near the Tibet borders, and in the Burmese rivers
on the frontiers.
In Tibet, gold is found in dust in many of the rivers, and
likewise scattered in lumps and grains, in quartz and other
rocks. The gold is here worked, but the yearly yield is not
known.
In Malacca, gold is found at Naning, Pahang, Tringanu,
Calantan, Battang, Moring, and in other localities; and the
yearly return is estimated at 26,000 ounces. There is gold
quartz at the foot of Mount Ophir.
Gold, it is known, is produced in Japan, and in quantities
sufficient for home purposes; but the }deld is supposed to be
falling off. The chief gold works are in a pyritic ore of
copper; but there are likewise diggings in the alluvial soils.
The Japanese copper has been often found to contain gold.
Throughout Australasia gold is found, abounding most in
those islands which are composed of primitive and transition
rocks; being richest in the western and northern islands, and
least abundant in the eastern islands, though it is met with in
Java. Borneo is the richest of these gold regions; and it is
worked at Banjarmassin and Pontianak, chiefly by Chinese
mining companies. The gold is found in veins and mineral
strata, in the sands and beds of rivers, and in dry diggings.
Above 6000 Chinese have been employed at one time in these
workings; and the yield is estimated at 9000 lbs. yearly, or


.�375,000. In Sarawak in 1849, 2,000 men got �>30,000
worth of gold from the detritus of Mount Trian. The yield
of the Sumatra mines is taken at 3000 lbs., or .�131,000
yearly ; and of the other mines in the several islands, about
4000 lbs., of which Celebes, 800 lbs. ; Timor, 80 lbs.; and
the Philippines, 1200 lbs.
Gold is known to exist in New Guinea, but details are
wanting. It is likewise said to have been discovered in New
Caledonia.
$ 9 - TOPOGRAPHY OF THE NEW HOLLAND GOLD REGIONS.
The chief New Holland gold diggings hitherto reported
being connected with the basin of the River Murray, it
becomes useful to give some account of that river system.
This river may justly rank among the great ones of the world,
and is the greatest on the New Holland main land, of which
it may be called the Mississippi. The extent of its basin
is by no means known, its eastern feeders being those
with which we are least acquainted. To the east it reaches
beyond 151� east, approaching the shores of New South
Wales ; to the north a feeder has been found in 25� south lat.,
and on the south its mouth is in 35� south lat., though some
of its feeders in the Victoria province are as far south as beyond
37�. On the west its mouth, and probably many main feeders,
reach to 139� east longitude. The area of the basin at a mean
is not less than 1,400 miles, from north to south, and 400
from east to west, covering between 500,000 and 600,000
square miles, or a district five times the area of these islands,
and four times the extent of California.
The shores of the Australian mainland, where chiefly
settled, are girded in within 100 miles of the sea bv a belt of
%
lulls, having short water-courses to the sea. On their inland,
or cast side, all the waters are feeders of the great Murray,
and have a long course before their waters reach the sea.
For a considerable distance they flow among the mountains,

but after a space open out on large sandy plains, in which
sometimes the waters are lost.
The Murray River system may be chiefly divided into two
great parts. The rivers of the north and north-east all flow
into the Darling, and those of the south and south-east, from
southern New South Wales and Victoria, into the Morum-
bidgee, or Upper Murray. These two great arms uniting
form the Lower or main Murray, which forming near the
sea a large lagoon, called Lake Alexandrina, discharges itself
by several mouths into the sea south-east of Adelaide, in South
Australia.
The first shire in which gold was found, was that of Bathurst
in New South Wales. This country was considered inacces-
sible until 1813, and consists generally of table land, about
2000 feet above the sea, broken up, and forming extensive
treeless downs, such as Bathurst Plains; which latter have an
extent of 50,000 acres, or eighty square miles. They have
been compared to Brighton Downs in England; they exhibit,
however, a strange peculiarity: on the top of some of the knolls
are found quagmires or bogs, sometimes resembling a pond
dried up, or sometimes covered over by deep grass, and there-
fore are very dangerous. In 1845, Bathurstshire, which
includes 2000 square miles, had already 4400 inhabitants, with
about 30,000 head of cattle, and 250,000 sheep. The chief
towns were Bathurst, with 2000 inhabitants, now much in-
creased, and Carcoar, likewise an incorporated town.
Bathurst is 121 miles by road from Sydney, and ninety-five
and a half by the air-line.
Bathurstshire is in two valleys, that of the Macquarie,
north, and that of the Lachlan, south, and in both gold has
been found. These valleys are divided by a tolerably high
range, in which are Conobolus, 4461 feet high, and the Three
Brothers.
Weilingtonshire lies next Bathurstshire, and its southern
divisions include the famous gold districts of the Turon and
of Summerhill. This shire contains about 1600 square miles,
and before the gold discoveries, scarcely as many inhabitants.


The streams feeding the Summerhill Creek, and running by
the Molong to the Macquarie, rise on the sides of the high
mountain, Conobolus, which forms a centre in this region of
the gold deposits.
Summerhill is on a high plateau or table land, being 3010
feet above the sea.
Roxburghshire lies north of Bathurstshire and Wellington-
shire, from the latter of which it is divided by the golden
stream, the Turon. Its area is about 1000 square miles, and
before the gold mania, its population was about 2500. The
shire town of Kelso is near Bathurst, and its population was
500. There are many high hills in this district.
South of Bathurstshire is Georgianaland, chiefly watered by
the Abercrombie river running through it; but presenting no
remarkable feature, and thinly peopled.
South of Georgianaland is Argyleshire, the seat of some
important gold mines. It contains 2000 square miles, and a
population of 5000, with about 300,000 sheep. It consists of
many ridges, with swelling hills and irregular plains, well
watered. In its south are numerous lakes and lagoons, one of
which is Lake Bathurst, a great mining centre. This lake is
from three to five miles across, its size varying according to
the mountain torrents which are poured into it. Here are the
mines of the Australian Freehold and Lake Bathurst Com-
panies. To the north of Lake Bathurst are Goulburn Plains,
consisting of about sixty square miles, without a tree. Here
is the town of Goulburn, 125 miles from Sydney, with
1200 inhabitants; Bungonia is another town with about 100
people.
Murrayshire, another gold region, is south of Argyleshire,
its area is 2200 square miles, with a population of 3000,
having 25,000 cattle, and 300,000 sheep. Through Murray-
shire runs the Gourock Range, at the foot of which is Lake
George. This lake is 2000 feet above the sea; about sixteen
miles wide, and seven broad, having on its west shore a steep
range of hills.
In the neighbouring maritime shore of St. Vincent, is

Braid wood, a point in the raining district, and having about
200 inhabitants.
In the province of Victoria, or Australia Felix, is the seat
of a great gold region, as near to Melbourne, the head town,
as Bathurst is to Sydney. The whole range of the Australian
Alps, 200 miles long, is supposed to afford sites for gold
diggings.
Bourkeshire, in which Melbourne is seated, contains about
3000 square miles, and above 25,000 people. Melbourne, the
capital, is the largest town in New Holland, next to Sydney.
Adjoining Bourkeshire is Grantshire, in which is the flourish-
ing town of Geelong.
Western Port, a district north and east of Bourkeshire,
includes many rich mining districts.
The gold produce of Melbourne has been more plentiful
than that of Sydney,
� 10. HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE AUSTRALIAN
GOLD REGIONS.
The resemblance of the Australian formations to those of
the Ural was first remarked by Sir Roderick Murchison, who
was so strongly impressed with the fact, that he felt it his
duty to allude to it, in the address which he delivered to
the Royal Geographical Society, as President, in May 1845.
In the subsequent year he specially addressed the Cornish
Miners on the subject, and adverted* particularly to the
discovery of gold near Bathurst, on the western flank of
what he styled the great Australian Cordillera ; and he
stronglv urged the propriety of a strict geological in' esti-
gation, with the view of establishing gold workings. Colonel
Helmersen, of St. Petersburgh, a member of the Russian
Academy of Sciences, also well acquainted with the Ural
gold works, expressed the same opinion. The views of Sir
R. Murchison obtained great publicity in Australia; but it

1846 ; and Transactions of British Association ot Advancement ol
Science, 1849.


is to be regretted the English government is not in the habit
of taking counsel from men of science, so that the opportunity
was lost, of taking all due and timely advantage of the
discovery.
The Rev. W. B. Clarke also published letters, suggesting
a theory of the gold deposits, in which, following Sir
Roderick Murchison, and taking the Russian deposits as a
basis, he predicted gold deposits in California and Australia.
He likewise points out the Equator as a great gold region ;
and this, too, the best practical authorities confirm.
Mr. Francis Forbes, of Sydney, about two years ago pub-
lished and circulated in New South Wales a paper, in which
he affirmed in the strongest manner, on scientific data, the
existence of gold formations in New Holland. Mr. Forbes,
not being listened to nor encouraged in his researches, went to
California, w here he died in 1850.
Even the discoveries in California did not arouse the New
Hollanders to adequate researches, though reports were spread
of wonderful discoveries in Victoria and South Australia,
which were speedily discredited. It was reserved for a gentle-
man of New r South Wales, Mr. Edward Hammond Hargraves,
to make the definitive discoveries. He appears to have acted
independently of all previous views on the subject; but having
acquired experience in California, and being struck with the
resemblance between the Californian formations and those of
New Holland, he determined on a systematic search for gold,
which he brought to a successful issue on the 12th of February,
1851, by the discovery of gold diggings in the Bathurst
and Wellington districts, and which he prosecuted until he
had ascertained the existence of gold sands in no less than
twelve places.
The proceedings of Mr. Hargraves and of the government
were spread about, and on the Ist of May of that year ?on the
day of the opening of the Great Exhibition, and five years after
Sir Roderick Murchison?s Cornish address?it was made known
in Sydney that great gold discoveries had been made in the
interior, when a period of wild speculation immediately com-

menced. In the Bathurst district, active operations has
already begun, and hundreds successfully proved the gold
diggings. It is well enough known that a Californian excite-
ment has prevailed there, which it is unnecessary to detail.
In the beginning of June, the Governor-General made a grant
of �5 OO to Mr. Hargraves, and afterwards an appointment
of �350 a year; and at the same time the ? Sir Thomas
Arbuthnot? sailed from Sydney for England, with <�*4ooo
worth of gold among her cargo, and the exports continue large.
The locality of the gold diggings first reported, is *in
the upper basin of the Macquarie. On the head stream of the
Fish river will be found Bathurst, and to the left of it, a
small stream, about forty miles long, which runs from the
Bathurst road at Pretty Plains to Lewis Ponds. This is the
J
Lewis river. Its western feeder is "the Summerhill Creek,
about thirty miles from Bathurst, and 150 miles from Sydney,
which, soon after the discovery, was beset with 4000 gold
diggers, and from which the first exports were obtained. The
width of these creeks, at their junction, is reputed to be about
fifty or sixty yards, and the water sometimes rises suddenly
twenty feet. The diggings extend downwards all the way to
the Macquarie. Swallow Creek is the locality of another
digging. These Macquarie diggings, on the Turon river, are
called Ophir, in the County of Roxburgh.
There are other gold fields in this district, including Meroo,
Louisa Creek, Havilat, and O?Connell Plains.
The mountain ranges near here run high, the neighbouring
Mount Canobolus being 4461 feet above the sea. It is a
matter of considerable importance, that gold is also reported
as occurring in the feeders of the Lachlan, which rise on
the south side of the range. In the Narrambla, near Carceon,
south-west of Bathurst, diggings were begun, so that it may
be expected that gold will be found throughout the Lachlan
valley.
Soon after the Gold Diggings were commenced about the
district of Bathurst, scientific men knew that gold quartz
existed in the higher ground, and a system of exploration
was started.


It appears, that in the first week in August, 1851, Mr
Charles Langley of Sydney, a surveyor, commenced pros-
pecting the land, both on the east and western sides of Lake
Bathurst, where he discovered that the entire estate there
situate, of a gentleman residing in London, abounded with
gold, and at eight different parts on his Lake Bathurst pro-
perty, gold quartz was to be found in great abundance.
After Mr. Langley?s confidential report, the estate, in fee-
simple, became the property of the Australian Freehold Gold
Company, the Directors of which raised the whole capital of
dfPIOOjOOO, and arranged to send out a regular staff of miners,
together with machinery for crushing and preparing the gold
quartz.
From the information that arrived by the ? Phoenician,?
which brought news from Sydney up to the 11th of November,
1851, it appears that the whole district of Lake Bathurst
abounds with gold. On several mornings during the first
week in November, Mr. Dibdin and his party had been
prospecting at the Mulwarre Ponds, on the western side of
the Lake, and in every cradle washed out, gold in very large
quantities was found. On some occasions, as many even as
thirteen heavy specks were produced from a cradle of earth.
The Times, in its Money Article of the 6th inst., February,
1852, stated that the accounts of the Australian Gold confirm
all expectations thus far of a permanent and increasing yield,
and that the fresh spots chiefly mentioned, are at Braidwood
and Lake Bathurst.
There is another Mining Company adjoining the ? Austra-
lian Freehold,? called ? Lake Bathurst,? which is now before
the public. Both these mines are situated on the eastern side
of the Lake. Gold has also been found in considerable quanti-
ties near Goulburn, a few miles to the north of the Lake, and
also at Braidwood, about ten or twelve miles to the south of
it; and from the situation of the Lake being close to the
main Government road to Sydney, the district being well cul-
tivated, and the different companies being the owners of the
freehold, there is every probability of a new and important
town being erected there.


There is a singular feature, which it may be well to notice
here: In the earlier grants of land in this district, the Crown,
after reserving various things, did not reserve the minerals,
and it has been held by the Courts at Sydney, that in conse-
quence of this non-reservation, no royalty is pa} r able in respect
of them.
Besides the indications in the valleys of the Murray, on the
western side of the Rocky Mountains, there are reports of
gold on the eastern side, more particularly in several parts of
the Hunter river?one of the chief rivers of the coast, flowing
through the colliery districts to Maitland and Newcastle.
Several of the heads of the Hunter rise close to those of the
Macquarie. Gold is reported as low down as Maitland.
The Port Philip district, in the province of Victoria, is one
of the richest gold provinces yet discovered. The whole of the
plains westward of the Australian Alps abound with gold
deposits. Early in 1851, gold was first found in the township
of Buninyong, forty miles from Geelong, and ninety-four miles
from Melbourne. Subsequent discoveries have been made at
Ballarat, Clunes, Golden Point, Mount Alexander, and several
other localities; large lumps, or nuggets , have been found in
many spots. The richest yield of gold in these districts is
obtained from a stratum of blue clay, which is found at a
depth of from two to nine feet. The deeper it is found, the
more valuable is the deposit of gold.
� 11. CANADIAN GOLD REGION.
In 1850, the discoveries of gold in La Chaudiere River, in
Canada, being confirmed, a company was formed, and in 1851
specimens of the stream gold were shown in the Great
Exhibition by Mr. Logan, the Government geologist, and by
the Chaudiere Mining Company. Subsequent researches have
proved that this gold basin is of considerable extent, reaching
into Maine, and yields auriferous quartz.
� 12. VIRGINIAN GOLD REGION.
The eastern gold region of the United States is considered
to begin in Virginia, extending all through North Carolina,
along the northern part of South Carolina, and thence north-


westerly into Alabama, terminating in Tennessee. This dis-
trict has been long known, and consists chiefly of diggings,
but which are supposed to be pretty well worked out, though
very productive at times. The population of this district
have long been marked as ? gold hunters.? A lump from a
branch of the Rocky River weighed 281bs. The gold hunters
here introduced the practice of making dust a currency.
Quartz gold is found in Virginia, besides river gold. In con-
sequence of the productiveness of the Virginian region, two mints
were set up in 1835, for the coinage of gold ; one at Charlotte, in
North Carolina, and the other at Dahlonega, in Georgia.
The Virginian workings, which had been small, in 1830
reached $466,000, or about <�*100,000; and in 1843, $1,200,000,
or a quarter of a million ; the whole up to that period being
$10,000,000, or <�2,000,000.
$ 13. CALIFORNIAN GOLD REGIONS.
The existence of gold dust in New California was known at
an early period ; having been found by Captain Shelvocke,
one of the English privateers in Queen Anne?s time.
Captain Shelvocke, it is to be observed, was quite
forgotten ; though he affirmed that the black sands of the rivers
yielded gold largely, and that the whole country abounded wiih
gold. Nevertheless, gold workings had been carried on, though
no attention was paid to the streams. In 1825, gold ore was
worked by a Mexican, in a mine at St. Isidore, near St. Diego;
but, through the disturbed state of the country, little was
done. In 1840, a small thread of gold was wrought in the
district of St. Barbara, but not to any extent. Before the
annexation of California, a considerable English population
had already flocked in, in connection with the events narrated
above; but they were drawn only by the natural promise of
the country for grazing and tillage, and by its convenient
situation for extending Americo-English power and trade in the
North Pacific, for which it has attracted attention from the time
of Sir Francis Drake downwards. The re-discovery of the gold
diggings took place by accident, and not as in the case of
New Holland, from a determined investigation.
The discoverer was Mr. Marshall, who in September 1847


had contracted with Captain Sutter to build a saw-mill, near
some pine woods, on the American Fork, now a well-known
feeder of the Sacramento river.
In the spring of 1848, the saw-mill was nearly ready, the
dam and race being constructed; but when the water was set
on the wheel, the tail-race was found too narrow to let the
water through quick enough. Mr. Marshall, to save work,
let the water right into the race with a strong stream, so as to
sweep the race wider and deeper. This he did, and a great
bank of gravel and mud was driven to the foot of the race.
One day, Mr. Marshall, on walking down the race to this
bank, saw some glittering bits on the upper edge, and having
gathered a few, examined them, and conjectured their value.
He went down to Sutter?s Fort, and told the captain ; and
they agreed to keep it a secret until a certain grist-mill of the
captain?s was finished. The news got about, however; a
cunning Yankee carpenter having followed them in their visit
to the mill-race, and found out the gold scales.
Forthwith the news spread. The first workmen were lucky,
and in a few weeks some gold was sent down to San Francisco, and
speedily the town was emptied of people. In three months there
were four thousand men at the diggings, Indians having been
hired, eighty soldiers deserted from the American posts, and
runaways getting up from the ships in the harbour. Such
ships as got away carried news to Europe and the States, and
by the'beginning of 1849 both sides of the Atlantic wereTn
agitation. The subsequent growth of San Francisco and
Sacramento, the wonderful shipments of gold dust, the
establishment of California as a state of the Union, the
founding of Utah as another state by the Mormons, the
throwing open of the Panama route to traffic, and the
Nicaragua lake and river to navigation, and the development
of the semi-English states of Hawaii and Mosquitia, are facts
as familiar as household words. The red cross of St. George
and the stripes and stars are now marking out a new empire
for us on the Pacific, and the day is not perhaps so far off,
when we shall be able to put forward as stronghanded a claim
to the lordship of the great ocean as of the narrow seas.


The gold diggings of New or Upper California now
embrace the whole basin of the Sacramento, which consists of
a great northern and southern river, each flowing among the
mountains, and discharging its waters through a westerly
channel into the Bay of San Francisco. T.hese two streams
have many small brooks or feeders in the mountain gorges
and steep dales, and all, so far as is yet known, yielding gold.
The geological formation of the country belongs to the
primary series, and the chief rocks are granite and quartz.
In so far the resemblance in general between California and
the other gold yielding countries is complete; but whereas, in
most other cases gold mining is unproductive, the veins when
found, however widely spread about, and however much they
may hold as a whole, being unproductive for working in
detail, vet, in California the rocks are ascertained to be a
"v 7 i ? i
fertile source of metal. It is peculiar to California, that
the process of quartz-crushing has been introduced and
carried out on a large scale ; and it has this advantage, that
as it requires large and expensive machinery, capitalists can
take part in it, though the limit of their profits is necessarily
the tribute or portion at which the miner will supply the
quartz rock, unless as in the case of the great companies, the
quartz belong to the proprietors, when the profits made are
enormous, and almost beyond belief. T-he success of these
quartz operations has turned the attention of gold-finders in
another direction, and now, where gold-stream works are
discovered, researches are likewise made for gold-bearing rocks
in the neighbourhood.
Some of the chief quartz workings are in Nevada and
Mariposa counties, but the best known are on the rancho or
large estate bought by Colonel Fremont from Alvarado, the
Mexican governor. They are those of Mariposa, Agua Fria,
Nouveau Monde, West Mariposa, and Ave Maria; the first
leased by an American company, the third by a French, and
the others by English companies. Some of the quartz has
been assayed for <�7,000 in the ton of rock. A Mariposa
specimen was in the Q reat Exhibition.
The Agua Fria mine, the lease of which was granted by


the Hon. Colonel Fremont to Messrs. Palmer, Cook and Co.,
bankers, of San Francisco, is held by an English Company.
This property is situated on the small river of that name,
which is a branch of the Mariposa, and is about eighty-five
miles from the city of Stockton, to which place vessels of 400 tons
can navigate, and between which and San Francisco there is
almost daily communication by steam-packets.
Another mine on Col. Fremont?s estate is that called the
Ave Maria; negociations for leasing which to a London
Company have been carried out. This mine is situated on a
bluff, rising from the banks of the Ave Maria, a fork of the
Mariposa river, near Stockton, in Mariposa county.
The Mariposa Mines are near Mariposa city, and are leased
from Col. Fremont by Messrs. Palmer & Cook. These were
the first quartz mines worked ; and a steam engine has been
set up.
On the Ave Maria is likewise the location of Messrs. Stockton
and Aspinwall, who have set machinery to work.
The Philadelphia and Californian Mining Company have a
capital of � 100,000; and have sent out machinery to their
works which are near the Mariposa.
The Carson?s Creek Mine is worked by an Anglo-American
Company. The Mine is situated in Calaveras County, near
Carson?s Creek, which runs into the Stanislaus River, the
latter giving water-drainage to Stockton, and so to San Fran-
cisco and the sea, as will be seen by the map.
The works of the Great Anglo-French Company, the
Nouveau Monde, are in the Mariposa district, between those
of the Mariposa Company (Palmer & Cook?s) and those of the
Agua Fria, and likewise on the estate of Col. Fremont.
It may be observed here, that large deposits have been
found in the neighbouring English settlement of Vancouver?s
Island, and also upon Queen Charlotte's Island.
� 14. SOUTHERN AMERICAN GOLD REGIONS.
The west coast of America is, perhaps, the region having
the greatest number of gold deposits, whatever may be the
most productive district, a fact which experience alone will


settle. At any rate, between 20� to 45� north lat., gold is
found everywhere, so far as has been tried in the valleys and
ravines, and indeed over many regions of the south the same
remark holds good. In Ecuador, in Bolivia, at Carabaya
and other places in Peru, great gold deposits have been recog-
nised.
The grand chain running from south to north, through the
mainland of America,* and which may be designated the
Great Cordillera, belongs, so far as is known, chiefly to the
primary formations. This immense extent includes several
gold regions, which may be thus classified : New California,
the Peninsula of Old California, Mexico, Central America,
New Granada, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. These, as
yet, have yielded to the world the largest supplies of gold.
New or High California is separately described. Of Old
California but little is known; still the same geological
formations are continued through it, and gold has been recog-
nised. Some believe that gold is more abundant than in the
other California. At Moleje there are gold workings.
Mexico and Central America may be considered together.
In the north we have the rich gold region of Sonora, the
workings of which are given up since the inroads of the
Indians. These districts are traversed by a chain of moun-
tains, in a line due north, forming part of the great back-bone
of the Cordilleras, and which sends out a great number of
steep spurs, running in a north-east and south-west direction,
and forming deep ravines or high table lands, as may be seen
on the Great Model of the Earth. The plains, or ?llanos,?
at the base of these Rocky Mountains, are composed of lime-
stone, overlying granite; but in lower latitudes they are su-
perstratified with serpentine and greenstone trap. In the
Sierra Nevada, another part of the chains, the rocks are com-
posed of granite, quartz, porous trap, or basalt. The granite
of that region is composed of white quartz, felspar, and black
mica, and like all the others is gold bearing. These granites
being likewise of a granular and loose structure, readily un-

dergo decomposition. Some of the peaks under the line are
of perpetual snow, and generally the lower levels are at such
an elevation that during a great part of the year they have
a thick coating of snow, which exercises an action on the
granite. At the time of thaw, and in the rainy season, lasting
from November to March, floods of water sweep from the
mountain tops, and along their sides, through the deep gullies
and ravines, into the valley, carrying with them the worn
rock and the broken gold veins, with which the lower basins
are yearly flooded.
Sonora and Sinaloa, in North Mexico, may be considered as
closely connected with California, lying in the Californian
Gulf. Many mines are known there, though the working is
now interrupted, but a strong body of Americo-English having
gone there, they may be soon taken up again. Among the
mines known are Triarte, Rosario, Corala, Alamos, Her-
mosillo, and Guadalupe y Calvo. It is said that in 1839 as
much gold and silver was assayed in the government establish-
ments of Hermosillo as was worth r i he gold
workings of Quitovac and Sonitac, to the north of Arispe,
were discovered in 1836, and for three years yielded =�?7oo
worth of gold daily. Catorce is likewise rich in gold. In
Guanaxuato, in the last century, 1,000 lbs. of gold were
yearly coined, but in this 300 only. In this province, where
the veins are worked principally for silver, the ores arer
frequently found to be very rich in gold, which is separated
in the grinding process by putting quicksilver with those into
the arrastres, or grinding mills, thus producing a mechanical
amalgamation of the gold with the quicksilver, which amalgam-
ation is afterwards separated by washing. This process will
probably be applied in California with good effect.
The production of gold in Mexico in 1844 and 1845, was
about $1,300,000 yearly, but in what proportions obtained is
not known.
In Central America gold is worked at Del Aquacato, in
Costa Rica, and elsewhere. In 1823, the yield was 721b5.;
1824, 2631b5.; and 1825, 2601b5.


In New Granada gold is found in the Central and Western
Andes. In the basin of the Rio Cauca are river washings, and
gold is to be had in the Rio Atvato, Rio Zulia, and Rio Hacha.
In the mountains of Antioquia it is obtained by mineral
washings; the yield is about J?500,000 yearly.
The gold coinage of the mint of Bogota in New Granada
is as follows;
1810 ... #1,004,969 1818 ... $837,494
18J1 ... 1,017,753 1819 ... 785,342

1816 ... 761,220 1824 ... 576,496
1817 ... 1,034,102 1825 .. 573,609
The gold coinage of Popayan in Ecuador is as follows
1810 ... $886,056 j 1819 ... $566,722
1816 ... 236,909 I 1823 ... 495,848
1817 ... 703,372 j 1824 ... 840,563
1818 ... 779,362 ! 1825 ... 742,978
In most of the rivers of the west coast of South America
and in the Cordilleras, gold is found. In Peru, gold is found
in Pataz, Huailas, Curimayo, near Caxamarca, and Curabaya,
and the average yield is J?60,000 yearly.
There are many gold mines in Chile, but silver and copper
mining are preferred. In the Great Exhibition was a lump
of gold ore, weighing 3 cwt. The average yearly produce
fell to JPI 60,000, but was formerly � 400,000.
The amount of gold coined in the Valparaiso mint for the
six months of this year, including July, is 7425 Spanish lbs.,
valued at <� > 448,000.
� 15. BRAZIL GOLD.
Gold is chiefly obtained from river washings in the Minas
Geraes and Matto Grosso. In the former province, it is carried
on by the Imperial Brazilian and St. John del Rey Mining
Companies, being obtained partly from rock ore, but chiefly

from river washings. It is found scattered in grains in several
primitive rocks. The chief time of working is when the gold
streams overflow their banks. A man takes his place at the
edge of the river, and begins to open a trench with a small
hoe. In this trench the water is allowed to stand through
the day, being poured off at night. The sediment, called
? cascalho,? is further washed, to obtain the ore. T-he gold
mines are chiefly near St. John del Rey and Villa Rica. In
Matto Grosso the chief gold workings are at Cuyaba and
Jacobina, in the south-west. The yield has been estimated at
17,000 lbs. yearly, but in the last century the average yearly
value was nearly <�Boo,ooo.
The produce of the quintos or fifth of the gold from Minas
Geraes, in the Brazils, gives the following yearly average:?
From Paraguay, a lump of gold was obtained weighing 501bs.
� 16. GOLD IN AFRICA.
In the north of Africa, gold is found in the sands near the-
town of Tripoli, and, indeed, throughout the Regency. Near
the town, the sands of the sea shore contain small quantities
of gold, which are sifted. The people gather it up in hand-
fuls, put it into a wooden bowl, and wash it with several
waters, till the gold is left at the bottom. Gold is found like-
wise near the Fezzan border.
In Morocco, in the neighbourhood of Tarudant, there is
said to be gold mines in the hills, but they are not worked.
In South Morocco, near a place called Shiebon, is a glen of
alluvial soil, in which much gold is found, both in dust and
lumps, which is gathered into ostrich or vulture quills. At
Luca likewise gold is wrought.


The chief gold mines belonging to the Pasha of Egypt are
in Kordofan, on the Fazangoro. In Abyssinia a little gold is
found in the rivers.
Others in North Africa are in the mountains of Mandara ;
at Bourra on the Wassolo, in alluvial earth, and at Bambouk
on the Wankaral. Of these, the yearly produce is reckoned
at 5000 lbs.
The interior of Africa has long been known for producing
large quantities of gold dust; but the geography is too little
known to enable the sites of production to be identified.
In Foota Jalloo, on the west border, Is a gold mine, in the
country of Malee; and in Bambarra is likewise a gold mine.
The whole yearly yield of gold from Africa is perhaps
X J 500,000.
Of all the African mines, the Bambouk mines are, however,
supposed to be the richest. They are about thirty miles south of
the Senegal river; and the inhabitants are chiefly occupied in
gold washing during the eight months of dry weather. About
two miles from Natakou is a small round-topped hill, about
300 feet high, the whole of which is an alluvial formation of
sand and pulverized emery, with grains of iron ore and gold,
in lumps, grains, and scales. This hill is worked throughout;
and it is said the richest lumps are found deepest. There are
1200 pits or workings, some forty feet deep?but mere holes,
unplanked. This basin includes at least 500 square miles.
Forty miles north, at the foot of the Tabwara mountains, are
the mines of Semayla, in a hill. This is of quartz slate; and
the gold is got by pounding the rock in large mortars. In the
river Semayla are alluvial deposits containing emery, impreg-
nated with gold. The earth is washed by the women, in
calabashes. The mine of Nambia is in another part of the
Tabwara mountains, in a hillock, worked in pits. The whole
gold district of Bambouk is supposed to extend over 10,000
square miles.
Close to the Ashantee country is that of the Bunkatoos, who
have rich gold workings, in pits, at Bukanti and Kentosoe.
