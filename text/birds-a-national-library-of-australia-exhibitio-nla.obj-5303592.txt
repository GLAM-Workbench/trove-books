BIRDS!
'So that the air ... should be populous
with vocal and musical creatures.'
Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837)
From James Thomson (trans.) and
Bertram Dobell (ed.), Essays, Dialogues and
Thoughts (Operette Morali and Pensieri)
of Giacomo Leopardi. London: George
Routledge, [18 —■].
Birds—the only creatures of our
earth with the gifts of both flight
and song—were flying and singing
across the great southern continent
(only recently called Australia) for
millions of years before humans
heard them. Potent symbols of the
natural world, their flight and
endurance also make them symbols
of the human spirit. Their lives
seem to us numinous and eternal,
but they are dangerously threatened
by our activities.
This exhibition is about birds that
fly and sing in the Australian
imagination. Its images may vividly
remind us of the birds that live in
the world around us, but they also
trace our changing attitudes to birds
and our practical, scientific and
artistic uses of birds. Even
ornithological illustration is only
illustration. While it reminds us of
birds we recognise, it equally reveals
passing artistic values and a
'scientific' way of seeing which
contrasts strikingly, for instance,
with Aboriginal bird drawings. Even
today, a 'bird in the hand' is often
held to be 'worth two in the bush',
but the 'hand' of this exhibition is
more that of the artist than of the
shooter, collector, taxidermist or
more recent bird bander.
The colonisation of Australia
coincided with the development of
the new European bird science,
ornithology, and of a wide popular
interest in birds. It also coincided

with the flowering of print culture:
illustrative engraving, lithographic
and other colour-print technologies,
fine book-making and photography.
Today, just as these arts face the
radical challenge of new electronic
technologies, this exhibition presents
a retrospective of images of birds
produced by that period of
spectacular art and paper work.
Most of the birds of this story
come from the diverse European-
Australian collections in the
National Library of Australia; from
European scientific and artistic
traditions recreated progressively
within our colonial and recent
pasts. Generous loans of modern
Aboriginal bird sculptures and
paintings show that ancient
indigenous and younger European
forms have existed side by side in
Australia, but have only recently
begun to learn from one another.
The image of the rock painting
The Emu Hunter of 15 000 years ago,
photographed by the Museum and
Art Gallery of the Northern
Territory, attests to the breathtaking
antiquity of Australian culture. In
the light of this painting, the birds
of a medieval manuscript from
fifteenth-century Europe spring into
recent time. Following these historic
images from the two great streams
of our tradition—indigenous and
European—the collections of the
National Library go on to tell their
story of birds and modern Australia.
Songless Bright Birds
In 1870, Adam Lindsay Gordon
(1833-1870) wrote of Australian
lands 'where bright blossoms are
scentless, / And songless bright
birds'. This common colonial
prejudice could not long defy what
people actually heard in the bush.
Yet the predatory activities of
visitors and settlers quickly created
an actual 'songlessness' in the
spreading, colonised lands. In the
first starvation years of invasion,

many birds, like the abundant
mutton bird on Norfolk Island,
were simply eaten out. Many
admired birds were destroyed by
their admirers' mania for imported
field-sports and competitive,
lucrative collection. The Kangaroo
Island and Macquarie Island emus
were extinct before John Gould's
Birds of Australia (1841-1848).

Early colonial bird sketches
record the naturalists' fascination
with the marvellous southern birds,
and show that Australian animals,
along with the land and its
sovereign people, were invaded.
Birds were shot, collected, sketched,
stuffed and shipped home as
specimens of science by the invaders.
Ships returning to England and its
insatiable collection trades carried,
even into our own century, countless
cargoes of songless bright birds.
And Human Bones
Every 'bird in the hand' mirrored
the enduring attempt to silence the
historic songlines of the world's
oldest human culture. 'Enlightened'
European greed for an exploitable
new world did not, as several works
in the exhibition make clear,
distinguish between human and
animal domains. The whole
country seemed one vast repository
of specimens.
Brilliant Curiosities
Art enlivens dead things. Many of
the images of colonial bird art were
drawn (as many still are) from
skins, often by Londoners in
London. The skins hold form,
colour and texture motionless for
copying, but, remote from their
bushland, produce sketches that
seem naive and awkward. Often it
is the radiant hand-colouring that
makes these birds live.
The exhibition's early documentary
drawings begin with the jewel-like
paintings of the Hunter sketchbook,
and with watercolours from the
Sarah Stone album. They continue
with work by James Sowerby, John
William Lewin, Ferdinand Bauer
and Charles Lesueur, displayed in
the form of original paintings,
hand-coloured engravings in rare
books, and, in the case of
Ferdinand Bauer, in the form of
recent hand-printed lithographs.
They culminate in examples of the
famous lithographic work of
Elizabeth Gould.
John Gould produced his
remarkable volumes of Birds of
Australia (1841-1848) from his
publishing house in Golden Square,
London. He used the lithographic
work of his wife, Elizabeth Gould,
and, after her sudden death in
1841, that of Henry Constantine
Richter, William Hart and others.
With John Lewin's Birds of New
Holland ... (1808) and Birds of New
South Wales (1813) their only
predecessors, these great books
inaugurated a remarkable tradition
of fine Australian bird book-making.
The exhibition complements books
by John Gould and Gregory
Macalister Mathews with original
sketches and watercolours, and
with fascinating related documents
from the Library's Manuscript
Collection. Also featured is a rare
Victorian cabinet of stuffed
Australian fauna which was made
by Henry E. Ward, the famous
London taxidermist and friend of
John Gould. Almost certainly
exhibited at the London
International Exhibition of 1862,
this large cabinet filled with
hundreds of specimens illustrates
the grandeur and ambition of high
Victorian versions of eighteenth-
century 'cabinets of curiosities'.

This scientific strand in
Australian bird portraiture is seen
throughout the exhibition in bird
paintings by Louisa Atkinson,
Neville William Cayley, Ebenezer
E. Gostelow, Betty Temple Watts and
Lilian Medland; then in spectacular
paintings by William T. Cooper
and in a selection of the work of
photographers for the National
Photographic Index of Australian
Birds. The late twentieth-century
paintings in books by Frank
Thomson Morris register both the
continuing life of traditional bird
art and the life of birds in the
natural world, though Morris's
work is represented by one pencil
drawing only—in his book Pencil
Drawings 1969-78.
Across its 200 years, Australian
naturalistic bird illustration traces
an evolution from awkwardly
posed curiosities to bright
recognisable friends in home
foliage and habitat. The changing
illustrative styles also mirror a
history of attitudes toward birds,
from the time when fading, insect-
infested skins were more valuable
than living birds, to our own time,
when protection attitudes still fail
to stop the devastation of habitats
that threatens all Australian birds.
The birds our aggressive suburbs
and industries drive away do not
fly elsewhere; they die.
Birds for Art's Sake
From early on, expressive art
recorded elements of the same story
of exploitation. The centred lyrebird
fan of Nicholas Chevalier's
entrancing watercolour Fancy
Costume Emblematic of Australia
(c.1860) pointed the sorry way to
Australian involvement in the
devastating worldwide plumage
industry which lasted into the
19205. The arts of taxidermy were
now drawn boldly into the
adornment and decorative crafts,
as Eliza Catherine Wintle's splendid
Kookaburra Handscreen (c.1892)
shows. Dazzling Australian birds
like the white egret and heron were
transformed to spectacular feather-
work, and brought close to
extinction.
Expressive bird art, unconcerned
with identification, addresses the
emotional and symbolic value of
birds. Over a century before
Australian colonial work, Simon
Verelst's portrait Lady Anne Russell
(c. 16 70s) used an imported
cockatoo in a flashy imperial
variation on the use of birds in
European child portraiture. The
cryptic Boy with a Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo (c.1815?), attributed to
John William Lewin, presents its
bird and child as wistful images in
a colonial setting. These cockatoos,
accurate enough to the eye, exist to
express human values and emotions.
Colonial works also soon
appeared which remind us of more
practical reasons for bird killing
than studying natural history. John
Heaviside Clark's Throwing the Spear
(1813), S.T. Gill's Sportsmen with
Game by Coast (c.1856) and the
chromolithograph Animals of
Australia ... (1880s?) all feature bird
hunting, and all incorporate
imported arts and styles which


change, as they record, an invaded
world.
Only at the close of the
nineteenth century, however, do
birds seem generally to fly free
from the cage of specimens.
Margaret Fleming's The Cockatoo
(1895), though boldly centring a
dead bird, wholly transcends any
reference to natural history.
Beautiful even in death, Fleming's
cockatoo appears as a lost
companion whose limp death-fall
is light years away from the
attitudes of gun-happy naturalists.
If exploited, this cockatoo is
exploited by art.
Harping on Lyrebirds
and Investing in Emus
Many works from the Library's
collections suggest a changing
popular focus on different birds. An
early settler fascination with the
elusive lyrebird grew from scientific
excitement about mound-building
birds. The lyrebird appears in
many works, including John
William Lewin's watercolour
Lyrebird of Australia (c.1810). First
known by settlers as 'colonial
pheasant' (as in Pheasant's Creek
near Bargo, NSW), even this shy
creature did not escape the
colonist's Sunday oven —nor avoid
sacrificing its tail-feathers for fans
and drawing-room display cabinets.
Late nineteenth-century bird
stories for children—one eye on
English morals, one on dawning
Federation—include many Australian
birds, but argue the rise of the emu.

As early as 1853, the decorative
frame of S.T. Gill's Tattersall's Horse
Bazaar, Melbourne had as good as
invented Australia's national coat
of arms. Here a jumped-up
kangaroo and startled emu
anticipate and already parody
Federation heraldry.
Fun and games with birds —as
well as ceremony and ritual—had
were clearly wise as owls, but
lyrebirds, silly and proud as
peacocks, were self-declared liars.
Emus by contrast, tall and stern,
might come to represent a nation's
authority. So began the emu's
flightless parade on sculpted silver-
ware, the decorative carving of its
eggs, and the development of its
image on the national coat of arms.


begun long before in Aboriginal
lore. White Australians, such as
K. Langloh Parker in her Australian
Legendary Tales (1896), soon made
English versions of Aboriginal
creation stories. Along with these,
there emerged a children's story
land of birds, and an exciting new
era of book-making. Storytellers
and artists such as Ida Rentoul
Outhwaite, J.J. Hall, Dorothy Wall
and May Gibbs made emus,
cockatoos and honeyeaters as
familiar to generations of white
Australians as they had always
been to indigenous people.
And the day of the kookaburra
was near.
Laugh, Kookaburra,
Laugh
In the twentieth century, the
kookaburra, no longer the settlers'
weird bush clock but a familiar
friend in an urban setting, easily
stole popular attention from the
not-so-bright emu and elusive
lyrebird. Wise bush mother of
children's literature, the kookaburra
twined herself into wrought-iron
balcony lace, and laughed from
the faces of the first Australian
postage stamps, the first kitchen
Kookas, the signatures of Radio
Australia and Movietone News.
During the World Wars, happy
transvestite, she assumed digger
uniform on postcards to carry
cheering messages into the
trenches of Europe and the Pacific
war zones. 'She' became a
übiquitous icon.
Margaret Preston (1875-1963)
Emus
Art in Australia, May 1923, no. 4
In 1920, May Gibbs produced
Australia's most successful ever
poster of social instruction, a
cunning kookaburra cartoon
teaching wise maternity and
serving womanhood. No fewer
than a million copies of this
image—as both a poster and cover
of a New South Wales Department
of Public Health handbook—
cajoled Australian morals between
1931 and 1959.
For white Australia, strange birds
of the colonies were strangers no
more, but true native companions
and the winged carriers of social
virtues and a changing Australian
culture.
Bird Watching
The beginnings of this flexible
universalising of bird motifs lay in
late nineteenth-century story art
for children and in movements
such as Art Nouveau, which showed
its own fascination with birds and
produced the flattened, haunting
grace of Sydney Long's Music Lesson
(1904).
The strong lines and elegant
composition of such work also fed
the fashion for bookplates and
decorated books. Later it influenced
the graphic work of bird print-
makers and screen-makers Ethleen
Palmer, Lesbia Thorpe and Irena
Sibley. The superb bird wood
engravings of Lionel Lindsay
reflected the moods and characters
of birds flown free of the sentimental
restrictions of nineteenth-century
bird iconography.
Though highly stylised, this new
art freed the imagination's
engagement with the natural
world. It later made possible the
radical line-drawing of artists such as
John Olsen and Francis Lymburner
and the generous, interpretive
drawing of the mid-century, seen in
Charles Bush's Golden Bird (1940).
It also opened bird studies to a
comic anthropomorphism, where
attentively observed birds comment
on mid-century issues and speak of
the vagaries and possibilities of
Australian social identity.
Like Margaret Fleming's
The Cockatoo, Eric Thake's early
surreal oil Archaeopteryx (1941)
punctures the natural history story
of the exhibition. Working with the
visual pungency of cartoons,
Archaeopteryx wittily compounds
two great experiments: the ancient
pre-history of the bird and the
modern evolution of the aeroplane.

Watching Birds
The three black birds in the top
band of David Malangi's painting
The Snake That Bit Gurrmirringu
(1992) watch over the rest of
the story which tells of the
Manyarrngu Mourning Rites. The
swan of Eric Thake's linocut Bird
Watching (1965) mocks our
presumptuous bird watching. She
challenges our intrusions on her
world and identity.
Fabulous Birds
Nothing of the many things we
have made of birds —ornament,
trophy, specimen, art work,
exhibition—finally holds them.
Their alien natures, enviable wings
and song remind us again and
again that we are earthbound. The
ever-naming of our science and art
does not dispel their mystery.
The exhibition's final selection
brings together a variety of images
which illustrate the multiple facets
of the cultural vision that has
become ours. A diverse use of
natural images itself suggests the
mystery of the natural world, so
these native companions are as
much fabulous as friendly birds.
Here are fantastic birds from
