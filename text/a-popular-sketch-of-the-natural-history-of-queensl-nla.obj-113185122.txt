A POPULAR SKETCH

NATURAL HISTORY
QUEENSLAND:
PRICE FLETCHER.
INTRODUCTORY.
Of the many curiosities peculiar to the animal life of Australia, a fail-
share falls to the colony of Queensland. Ths immigrant, whether he
he a scientific scholar or simply an observer, will find a constant book
of novelty open for inspection. It is this charm of novelty which
makes this Austral land such a paradise to the lover of nature. No
matter what direction a journey is taken, whether into the ordinary
forest of the coast, or to the dense jungles of the river banks, or over
the vast prairies of the interior, forms new to the eye of the European
naturalist will be observed, until at last real pleasure is actually
experienced at the relief from novelty which is felt by finding a form
almost identical with some well-remembered species of the old world.
Even from the deck of a ship, and before a foot has been placed on
land, a feeling of pleasure will be experienced by the naturalist as his
glance takes in the vast expanse of forest before him, and he ponders
over the fact that its growth is that of the wonderful eucalyptus
family of trees, whose medicinal and other virtues are the talk of the
world. In imagination he will revel in the happiness of a ramble in a
virgin forest of an extent greater than that of an English county—
indeed greater than the whole area of England. The land breeze
blowing will waft to him a sweet scent, which he will at once pro-
nounce to be that of the mimosa, his book knowledge having
previously told him that the acacia family of trees is the one that most
successfully combats Avith the eucalyptus in the struggle for existence
against the many vicissitudes of Australian life.
Upon landing, the first journey into this forest will be a drop into
Avonder-land. The newly-arrived naturalist will see the Eucalypt in
its grandest stage of beauty, that is as a gnarled, broken-limbed
gigantic old gum tree, whose gray bark is grizzled and ragged, and
Avhose bare branches stretch out to such an extent that the wonder is
excited as to how they are sustained. He will notice the peculiarly
narrow leaves, with their hardened surfaces, suspended so as not to
be constantly exposed to the one ray from the overpowering sun.
The bark, hanging in shreds, will attract attention, and on teai'ing down
a strip his entomological fancies will rejoice, for he will see before him
13 A 2


a mine of novelty in the ants, spiders, beetles, Ac , that he has
dislodged, and in the host of crysalids, nests, and curiosities this one
tree has brought to light. A thud, thud on the ground will cause him
to turn round, and, to his delight, he will see an animal hopping
along, which he at once recognises as the world-renowned kangaroo,
and a thrill of pleasure runs through his sehses as he realises that at
last he has seen a marsupial in a state of nature and in its own wild
haunts. Unconsciously he follows the direction it went, when sud-
denly he is startled by the hurried scamper of a creature from a tus-
sock of grass near by, and away goes another hopping animal, which
by its more graceful shape, rapid jumping, and general activity he
concludes must be one of the numerous species of the smaller Macro-
podidae called Halmaturi or “ wallabies.”
Suddenly shrill, short, sharp screeches reach his ear, and even
before he can turn his head to discover the cause, a flock of paroquets
whiz with speed of an arrow' past, then giving a wheel and a turn
in their flight, they with one impulse settle in the gum tree before
him. Cautiously he approaches —but the caution is needless, for the
birds heed him not —and as he sees the bright green birds hanging in
every possible attitude and climbing about among the extreme tips of
the twigs, and sucking out the honey and pollen from the small
flowers of the eucalypt, he knows that they must belong to that
curious group of paroquets which have a brush-tip to their tongue and
so are called trichoglossus, and his admiration is excited at noticing
how suitable this strange peculiarity is for the work it has to do. Also
for the first time in his life he will have brought under his observation
how admirably adapted to their mode of life are the scansorial pecu-
liarities of the parrot family, and again he will be astonished at having
brought home to his immediate attention that the bright green and
yellow plumage so conspicuous upon the bird when in a cage renders
it all but invisible when among the leaves and flow-ers of the eucalypt.
Pleased at having facts new to his observation brought before him he
hardly notices a rustle beside his feet, but looking unconsciously
downwards, a black snake is seen with the fore part of its body raised
from the ground, the head flattened cobra-like, and prepared for
defence. Instinct tells him this reptile is venomous, and a blow from
a stick is speedily bestowed upon it. Then the pleasure of having
overcome a really dangerous creature will be another new sensation,
and if imbued with the true naturalist fervour, he will rejoice in being
in a, country where the reptilia are represented in their most interest-
ing form, that of the poison secreting ophidian.
The limits of this paper will permit of no more than the bare men-
tion of some of the chief characteristics of life as found among the
animals, the birds, and the reptiles of Queensland. Upon each division
a volume could be written, and yet much be left unsaid. The ento-
mologist will find in this country of heat and moisture an inexhaustible
field of study, for insect life is truly multitudinous in its develop-
ments, so much so that it is useless touching upon it in this essay.
Amongst the numerous fishes that abound in the reef-sheltered seas


that surround the coast of tropical Queensland, there is a mine of
undiscovered wealth to the student. Fishes of all shapes, some most
beautiful, elegant and graceful, others on the contrary, ugly, ferocious
—absolutely infernal looking. Their varieties are exceedingly
numerous ; their individual numbers legion.
THE MAMMALIA OF QUEENSLAND.
It is in this branch of natural history that the island continent, Aus-
tralia, shows its most distinctive peculiarities. To everyone it is
known as the land of the kangaroo, and to the student as the home of
the marsupialia. Every immigrant, before his arrival even, has seen
a picture of a kangaroo with the young one peeping out of the abdo-
minal pouch, and so is interested in such a peculiar animal, but the
student recognises that when in Queensland he is in the centre of
as strange a group of animals as he could possibly find ; a group which
at one time existed over Europe, Asia, and America, but which now,
with one or two exceptions, is only to be found in this island continent.
A group of which the external marsupium or pouch is only one pecu-
liarity ; a group which has developed species analagous to the placental
flesh-eaters, grass-eaters, and insect-eaters, and yet they are wholly
different; a group which is as much at home upon the ground and in
the burrow as it is upon the tree-tops or even in the air ; a group
which is an animal world of its own, showing in the species even now
living, a distinct development through the monotremes from the
reptiles. Eossil remains already discovered show that in the ages of
long ago there were far more species then in existence, and some of
these were of enormous size, taking the place of the gigantic ancient
pachyderms of the old world, but still retaining the peculiar shape
and anatomy of the marsupials. It is noteworthy that no fossil re-
mains of large placental carnivora have been discovered such as would
account for the disappearance of so many species. The settler in
Queensland need fear no lions, tigers, bears, or wolves, for no animal
exists larger than the dingo or wild dog, that can do harm to his
flocks and herds. In Tasmania there are two specimens of carnivorous
marsupials, which for ferocity and strength equal any animal of their
size among the placentals, but they do not exist in this colony at the
present day. There are, however, flesh-eating marsupials which can
and do make considerable havoc among the poultry yards of the
country settler; these animals, commonly called “ native cats,” take
the place and somewhat the shape of the Aveasel or stoat of the old
world. Other animals of the tribe of phalangers commonly called
“ opossums,” are often very destructive to the gardens and orchards;
but the greatest damage has been done to the farming and grazing
industry by the many various species of the macropodidfe or kangaroo
tribe. Australia in general, and Queensland in particular, offers an
anomaly in the progress of settlement by mankind of uncivilised
countries, insomuch that the wild herbivorous animals have largely
increased since the advent of the European race and not decreased.
Especially has this been the case with the kangaroo tribe, for evidently


the destruction of the dingo, and of the eagles hy the settlers, and the
decrease of the aboriginal natives destroyed the balance of nature so
much that many parts of this colony became overrun with these
crass-eating marsupials. They were as a plague in the land, to be
seen by hundreds and thousands, eating out the grass which otherwise
could support the more useful but less interesting sheep and cattle,
therefore legislative interference was called for, and a bonus per scalp
oiven for their destruction. Since the passing of this Act, only ve
years ago, no less than 6,000,000 scalps have been paid for. But this
legislative Act alone would not have annihilated the plague, nature
even stepped in with her aid, for the animals increased to such num-
bers they caused their mutual destruction, insomuch that they com-
pletely devoured every blade of grass in districts as large even as the
whole area of England; then drought supervening their destruction
was completed. Thus it is that districts which were overrun and
useless are now again restored to abundance of grass and to occupation
by domestic herds. . . . ,
The only animals natural to Australia that are not marsupials ai o
the wild dog, or dingo, as he is popularly called, the rodents, or rat-
tribe, and the bats, of which the flying fox, a large fruit-eating species,
is the best known. , . .
The young of the marsupials are all born in the usual way, but in a
very immature state, that of the great kangaroo being not over one
inch in length. They never have any placental connection with their
dam. Immediately upon birth they are transferred to the pouch, and
in a mysterious way the apparently minute lump of flesh which has
no power of voluntary movement, is attached to the teat, from which
the little creature is never separated until fully developed, ihe above
is a scientific fact demonstrable by any anatomist Nevertheless bush
residents unacquainted with anatomy strictly affirm that the young
one is born on the nipple. The larger kangaroos have only one
young at a time, but some of the smaller genera sometimes have two
in the pouch, generally differing in ages.
THE MACROPODIM3 OR KANGAROOS.
Ever since the sailors of the veteran navigator, Captain Cook,
announced to him that they had seen “ the devil,” in the shape of an
animal as tall as a.man, and that stood upright and hopped away on
its hind leo-s only, has the kangaroo been associated in the popular
mind with Australia, so without reference to scientific classification !
nander to the popular fancy, and place the well-known animal first in
the list for description. Necessity for curtailing space compels me to
o-ive but a brief account of the different families of our fauna, men-
tioning only by name one or two of the best known or peculiar species
typical of the family, and leaving entirely alone that most interesting
branch of natural history—the development of one species into
another. A study which if pursued among the marsupialia and in
coni unction with fossil discoveries of recent date will repay any
amount of trouble, for it is a marvellous book of wondrous surprises.


THE GREAT KANGAROOS (genus Macropus) <
of Queensland number about four species. In heigM they range from
four feet to six feet, and in weight from lOOlbs. up to 2001bs, the
males being always larger, heavier and more powerful than the
females. Their peculiarity is the great development of the posterior
parts of the body and of the tail as compared with the anterior parts.
Except when lying down, the kangaroo rests with its entire weight
upon the hinder legs and the tail; when feeding the fore feet_ aie put
to the ground, and while the body is supported by them and the tail,
the hinder legs are pushed forward both at once ; when alarmed t e
animal raises the anterior portion of its body to its full heig ,an
when frightened it leans forward and hops away by taking tremendous
jumps, thus bounding over grass, logs, fences, or obstructions. In
thus jumping, the weight of the animal comes so e y upon
elastic and strong tarsi of the hind feet, the tail never touching the
ground, but merely by its weight balancing the creature m its rapid
flight. The idea that the kangaroos use their tail to help them when
jumping, or as a weapon of offence or defence is entirely erroneous.
The anterior parts of the kangaroos when seen above the long grass as
the animal, by his keen hearing becomes aware of an intruder, appear
very graceful and deer-like, but this grace is dispelled as soon as
movement takes place, for, except when flying rapidly before the pur-
suing dog, the movements of the greater kangarooos are decidedly
ungainly. They are gregarious in their nature, and are frequently
seen in flocks of from a dozen to one hundred ; but in districts where
they are not much hunted, the writer’s observations are that they
prefer to keep in groups of from six to a dozen, and in such a party,
although the sexes will be equally divided, there will be one large and
powerful male, termed by the colonists an “ old man He is the
master, and will fight long and desperately with any rival who chooses
to challenge him. When the family is disturbed, this old man
will always be the last to move. .
The kangaroo is perfectly peaceable and harmless to every living
creature, but when hunted by dogs, after fleeing as far as it can go, it
then turns at bay, and with its back against a tree, or standing up to
its middle in water, it will fight to the last gasp. Its powers o e-
fence are very great, for with its fore arms and feet, which thong i
apparently small, yet are very muscular, it can gatch a dog anc
run away with it, or will hold it under the water until it is diowne ;
or with a stroke from one of its powerful hind feet, armed as they aie
with a long strong protruding claw, it will rip the dog completely
open. It will also, when at bay, not hesitate to attack any man, even
when on horseback. The extraordinary rapid increase in their numbei
necessitated the settlers to combine and assist each other in the wor '
of clearing them from the stock runs. Therefore, driving parties were
systematically organised, and by the extensive erection of high
fencing, with large strongly-fenced yards at the end, thousands of
these animals were, by skill and care, driven in and The
writer was at one such hunt when no less than 3200 grown animals


were yarded and slaughtered in the one day. This fact is stated just
to show that it is only through the animals haying increased to exces-
sive numbers that this apparently wanton slaughter is undertaken. The
peculiar formation of the lower incisor teeth of all the macropodidge is-
such that they can hold their own in the struggle for existence against
any domestic animal. These teeth are but two in number, as opposed
to six in the upper jaw, but their peculiar conformation is such that
not only can they graze as can other animals, but the two lower teeth T
which are long and curved, can be opened and closed scissors-like, and
thus the shortest and choicest grasses and herbs be cut off and eaten.
The flesh of the kangaroo is sometimes eaten, and from the tail is
made an excellent soup.
On the fore feet of the macropodidee there are always five well-
developed toes, each of which is armed with a large and strong nail,
curved; the two outer toes are the shortest and the central one the
longest. The hind feet are furnished with one very large central toe,
and an outer one, which is shorter and smaller, but like the first,
armed with a large solid nail slightly curved. On the inner side of
the foot are two small slender toes, united in one common integument,
and having the appearance of a single toe ; the nails, however, are
separate, of very small size and hollow beneath. The use of these small
nails is to cleanse the fur from vermin, such as ticks, which abound
in the grassy and scrubby country. The tarsus underneath is hairless,
but is covered with minute hardened tubercles, which are most dis-
tinctly developed and hardened in those species whose habitat is among
rocky land. In color the great kangaroos are generally grayish-
brown, but one species peculiar to the interior plains is of a decided
red hue, more particularly so in the males. This species (Macropus
rufus) attains to the largest size of any.
A peculiarity in the habit of all the kangaroo family which deserves
mention, as it to a great extent accounts for the rapid increase of the
animals when their natural enemies the dingo and the eagles were
extirpated, is that when hard pressed by any pursuer the doe will
eject the helpless young one from its pouch. Thus lightened, she is
better able to escape from her pursuer, and the dog or eagle in pursuit
immediately seizes the young one, and satisfies his appetite on it. A
doe kangaroo unencumbered by young is very fleet, and is seldom
caught by the native dog, who in most cases ceases to follow when he
finds no young is ejected.
THE BRUSH KANGAROOS OR WALLABIES (genus Halmaturi).
The immigrant will not have been long in the country districts of
the colony before he will have seen numbers of what appear to be
small kangaroos ; he will have observed them suddenly hopping out
from a tussock of long grass, or from under some bushy shrub, or,,
perhaps, feeding in hundreds by the side of a patch of dense scrub,
just about the time of slinset. These all come under the designation of
wallabies, brush kangaroos, and pademelons. There are about a score
of species of them, varying in size from lOlbs. in weight up to SOlbs..


They are identical in shape with the great kangaroos, but are de-
cidedly more agile and graceful in their movement, more fleet of foot
and more beautiful in their fur. Their colour ranges from a silver-gray
to reddish-brown, and even black ; often the underparts are white,
sometimes yellow, and they nearly all have a bridle mark along the
shoulder, and a horizontal stripe across the haunch. Distinguishing
the species is difficult, for the colouring of the fur is not constant. In
captivity (according to Kreft) they interbreed freely. Like the larger
kangaroos, these smaller sized species increased to such numbers that
they became a veritable plague, and even now require constant and
stringent measures to keep them in check. To the settlers’ crops they
are very destructive; indeed, it is only by fencing in the cultivated
ground with wire netting or close fencing, that a crop can be grown
in districts where they are numerous.
THE ROCK WALLABIES (genus Petrogalece).
This genus differs from other wallabies in their possessing a loner
pliable tail, which is not thickened at the base, and the apical half of
which is generally very bushy. They weigh up to 301bs, and some of
the species are very beautiful in the colouring and softness of the fur.
As inferred from their name, they are partial to rocky country, and,
notwithstanding their jumping system of locomotion, they are a's’sure-
footed and active among rocks as any goat. Indeed, their agility is
wonderful, and the almost vertical leaps they will take are quite
astonishing. The long tail is not used so much as a support as in the
other larger species, but by its pliability is admirably adapted for
balancing the animal in its erratic movements.
THE TEEE KANGAROOS (genus Dendrolagus).
This genus shows a curious variation of the typical habits of the
family. Their fore limbs are more powerfully formed than in any
other genus, and this peculiarity enables them to climb trees
easily. There are four species found in New Guinea, and two that
are inhabitants of _ Queensland. Their weight is said to reach up to
301 b. Very little is known of the animals or their habits, as they are
very rarely seen, for they are residents of the dense scrubs and rough
mountain country in the tropics. The fore feet are formed somewhat
after the shape of the sloth, and the hind feet also have a grasping-
power. The tail is long and thin like the Hahnaturi.
THE NAIL-TAIL KANGAROOS (genus Onychogalea).
These comprise two or three species of small animals that inhabit
the interior plains. They seldom weigh over TOlbs. Their peculiarity
is that the tail terminates in a bare nail-like tip, and also that their
fur, which is of a light gray color, is of a soft, silky nature.
THE HARE KANGAROOS (genus Lagorchestes ).
These are very similar to the preceding animals both in habit and
peculiarities. In appearance and size they very much resemble the
common hare, and they are the fleetest of the whole group of macro-
-13 A 3


podid®. In running they press the fore legs close to the side so that they
cannot he seen, and they will make clear jumps of eight and ten feet
high. The hind legs are very long and slender, and the tail rather
short and stiff, but not thickened at the base. One great peculiarity
of these two last genera is that in them the canine teeth are observable
for the first time among the family of macropods.
THE BETTONGS, OB JERBOA KANGAROOS (genus Bettongia).
These are small animals for the kangaroo family, for they are only
about the size of a rabbit. They also are similar to the rabbity in
their habit of forming extensive burrows and living in communities.
They are essentially inhabitants of the dry interior, and though four
or five species are known, only one or two are to be found in Queens-
land. This group connects the kangaroo tribe with the Phalangers or
opossums.
THE RAT KANGAROOS (genus Hypsiprimnus).
This genus completes the list of kangaroo tribe. There are several
species of them, and they differ but little from the preceding genus.
Their size is the smallest of the tribe, running probably from 31bs. to
Gibs, in weight. Their limbs are of more equal length, they progress
rather slowly, and the tail is short and stiff. In the Bettongs the tail is
more or less prehensile. Through the Jlypsiprymni the kangaroos
-approach the bandicoot tribe or peramelidce.
THE PHALANGISTIMI (PHALANGERS.)
This family of the Marsupialia is one that will be constantly coming
under the observation of the immigrant to this colony. It comprises
the native bear, the opossums, and the flying squirrels. These animals
are all arboreal, and nocturnal in their habits. They are peaceable in
disposition, but when wounded the opossums will bite severely. They
have increased greatly in numbers (excepting the Koala, or native
bear), and in many places in the Southern colonies the opossums have
proved very destructive to farm and orchard crops.
There is no animal that the immigrant will be so certain to make
the acquaintance of than the opossum. He is to be found every where
that there are gum trees, from Tasmania to Cape York, in the interior
or on the coast, although he is not so numerous in the interior
country. His proper name is
THE VULPINE PHALANGER ( Phalangista vulpina),
but every one calls him “ opossum.” There are several species of
these animals, but they differ only slightly from each other and all are
dubbed “ ’possums” by the colonists. Queensland possesses a greater
number of species than any of the other colonies. In habit they are
all nocturnal; during the day time they sleep in the hollow holes of
old gum trees and so cannot be seen, but at sundown they pop out of
their concealment and at once make for the extreme twigs of the tall
trees, where they feed upon the gum leaves. Upon moonlight nights
they are shot in great numbers by the younger members of the settlers
families. They do not show much intelligence when being hunted


for no matter what noise is made they seldom attempt to move from
the branch they are on, or to take advantage of any sheltering hole.
So muscular are they that when shot from the top of a tree even 90
feet high, if only slightly wounded, the fall has not the slightest effect
upon them, and they will immediately run ascend again. They
can and will bite severely when wounded if carelessly taken hold of.
The tail is strongly prehensile, and it is as easy for the animals to
hang by it when curled round a branch as it is for others to hold on
by their feet. In size the common opossum is about that of a
domestic cat, but some of the Queensland species are rather smaller.
In colour the vulpine opossum is an ashy grey, but the underparts of
the body are yellowish, and old males have a rusty-coloured neck and
breast; the fur is long and woolly; the tail is long, bushy with black
hair, strongly prehensile, and it is naked underneath. The female
has a pouch similar to the kangaroo ; there are four teats in it, but she
seldom has more than one or two young at a time. Their food is varied,
but it is principally leaves, grass, and fruit; still, in confinement, the
■common opossum will readily eat meat, small birds, bread, and drink
milk greedily. One that the writer once kept as a pet would not
refuse beer when offered to it. The peculiarity of the phalanger tribe
is that the hind feet have an opposable prehensile' nailless thumb, and
four toes, the two inner ones being small and united by a membrane.
The fore feet have the usual five strongly-clawed toes. The incisor
teeth still show the same peculiarity of the macropodidm in being six
.above as opposed to only two in the lower jaw ; the canines are always
present. These animals are the principal food of the aboriginal
native, who shows great skill in detecting by the claw-scratches on
the bark whether the animal is asleep in the hollows of the tree. If
so, then by a method of cutting notches with a stone tomahawk in the
bark of the tree, alternating from side to side but distant each one
about two feet higher than the other, the aboriginal will scale the
straightest and biggest gum tree by using these notches for the
purpose of placing his big toe in them. They thus act as steps, and
lapidly and surely the black climbs the tree. He then cuts a hole
with his tomahawk just over the part of the branch where the opos-
sum is sleeping, pulls it out by the tail and stunning it against the
branch throws it to the ground. The opossum is but seldom eaten by
the settler as its strong eucalyptus flavour is not pleasant to a
European palate.
THE CUSCOS, EINGrTAILS (genus Cuscos, tfc.)
Besides the few species of the phalangers commonly called opossums
there is a genus peculiar to tropical Australia which differs somewhat
from the typical phalanger. This is called Cuscos. The tail has only
the basal portion covered with hair; the ears are short and almost
hidden by the fur of the head; the eyes with a vertical pupil. In
size they are about the same as the common phalanger and their
habits are identical. There are several species of them, some having
only recently been discovered in the northern scrubs. Then there are
also the Ring-tailed opossums (P. Cookii, p. viverrina, and others), the


first mentioned being the very first phalanger ever discovered in
Australia. In size these ring-tails are smaller than the ordinary
opossum and more like the cuscos in appearance. They get their
popular name from the white or sometimes reddish tip to their long T
thin, and extremely prehensile tail, which is always more or less,
curved like a ring.
THE FLYING PHALANGEES.
These comprise three genera — Petaurista, Belidttis, Dactylopsia. By
the colonists they are all called “flying squirrels,” but they are true
phalangers, so flying opossum would be nearer the truth, for the'
squirrel proper is not indigenous to the country. These animals have; ,
a membrane extending from limb to limb, and they have a long bushy
tail; their fur is long, loose, and soft. They do not fly, but, climbing
to the top of a tree, they will then jump off, and spreading out their
legs to the utmost, the membrane thus acts as a parachute and they
descend in a graceful incline towards the ground; but with the momen-
tum of their descent they can, if desired, ascend to a considerable
height again, just as a boy’s kite ascends against the wind. They will'
thus make a “ flight” of from fifty to one hundred yards, according to
the height of their starting point; generally they alight upon the
naked bole of a tree in a line with the one they started from, for they
have no power of flapping their “ wings” as do the bats, but they have
considerable control over the direction of their flight and thus are
enabled to avoid the limbs and branches in their way. After alighting
upon the trunk of a tree they rapidly ascend to the top, and again
jumping off are away to another one before the observer has time to
follow their agile movements. They are strictly nocturnal and live on
similar food to the opossums.
The Great Flying Phalanger, the largest of the species, measures.
20 inches from the tip of the nose to the root of the tail and this tail
is itself often 22 inches long. The other various species range in size-
downwards to a length of 6 inches of body with a tail of 9 inches.
The whole of the species are beautiful creatures, graceful in all their
movements and at night time the personification of activity. They are
fairly numerous in some districts but are o ll seldom seen by the gen-
eral colonist on account of their nocturnal habits and rapid movements.
One species is a marvellous little miniature, being only the size of a
common mouse. It is called the jiciohcitcs Pyyvicvu, oi flying
mouse.” It differs from the larger species in the tail being “ feathered”
with a web of hair on each side. It is seldom obtained unless dis-
covered asleep in the day time by some wood-splitter when felling a tree.
Space will not permit of more than the mere mention of the genus
of small rat-like phalangers called Dromicia and the genus Tarsipes,
the latter of which is not found in Queensland, but is interesting as it
is acknowledged to be one of the links connecting the marsupialia
with the monotremata.
THE KOALA, OE NATIVE BEAE (Phascolardos Cinereus).
The immigrant will not have been long in the wooded countiy
of the Queensland mountain and coast districts before he makes


tlie acquaintance of this the most harmless, the meekest of
marsupials. Though called “ Native Bear,” it has not the remotest
connection with the bear tribe of animals, for it is a marsupial and
allied to the phalangers. Like the opossums, its habits are strictly
nocturnal and arboreal. In size it is larger than the opossum, for its
total length is about two feet, and its general appearance is round and
plump. It will weigh, if full grown, over 281b5., and it is such a mass
of muscle that a fall of 100 feet does not disconcert it in the least. In
this animal is seen a strange exception from the long and strong tails
which are such a common feature of the marsupialia, for the koala has
no external tail although in the skeleton are to be found several
flattened caudal vertibrsp. In colour the animals are an ashy-grey,
which renders them very inconspicuous against the grey bark of a
gum tree when coiled up during their diurnal sleep. Unlike the
-opossums they do not seek the shelter of hollow spouts in the large
trees but choosing some fork to sit in, they tuck their head into their
breast and thus sleep out the day without the slightest protection
from external foes. The koala is a powerful climber and seldom
troubles the ground except when wishing to change from tree to tree*
its food is almost entirely the leaves of the eucalyptus and other trees!
The female has one young at a time, which, after it gets of an age to
leave the pouch, is carried upon the back of the mother. Even when
wounded the koala seldom attempts to bite.
THE OR CARNIVOROUS MARSUPIALS.
Those two large flesh-eating marsupials, the Dog-headed Thylacine
(Thylacinus cynocephalus), and the Tasmanian “devil” ( SarcopUlus
■ursinus ) not being found in the colony of Queensland, it is sufficient
in this paper to say that they are the most ferocious and strong of all
Australian animals, not excepting even the Dingo. This ferocity and
the slaughter they inflicted upon the shepherd’s flock earned for them
the soubriquets of “ hyaena,” “ tiger ” and “ devil.” There are, how-
ever, several species of the different genera of the family Dasyuridce,
which are common in this colony, and which are popularly known by
the name of “ native cats.” In appearance they have not the slightest
icsemblance to the domestic cat, but have more the shape of the
ferret. The genus most commonly known is that of Dasyurus. The
length of the body varies, but about 12 inches is the average, and the
tail will aveiage 9 inches ; the fur is yellowish in colour with spots of
white over the back and sides, and the underparts are white. There
is a variety in which a jet black takes the place of the yellow, and
there is another \ariety which attains to a much larger size than above
mentioned, and yet all these are classed as the same species. The
dasyuri are ferocious little creatures, and at times commit sad havoc
:among the poultry flocks of the settler. They are easily trapped, but
will fight valiantly when escape is impossible. They are nocturnal in
their habits. The female has from four to six young at one birth,
: and possesses a shallow pouch; the young are firmly attached to the
.nipple as in. the kangaroos.


Another genus which will very likely cross the path of the settler
is that of PhascogaJe. These animals are about the size of a rat; they
are of a blueish-gray colour, and the underparts white, and the most
common species can he distinguished by the bushy tip to the tail,
hence its name P. penicilluta. All these species are nocturnal and
arboreal in their habits, but unlike the Dasyuri they do no havoc to
the poultry, their food being smaller creatures, such as young birds,
&c. The writer has fonnd this little animal in all parts of Australia,
from Cape York in the north to Cape Otway in the south. The
female has no pouch, yet it is a marsupial.
There is a genus of this family called Myrmecohius, which, although
not as yet having been found in this colony, deserves mention
here, because the species composing it are regarded as one of the links
in the chain of development of the marsupialia from the Ecidnse or
Monotreme ant-eaters. The teeth (52 altogether) of the myrmecohius
are small, weak, do not touch each other, and in number are not
exceeded by any living mammal. It is not unlikely that further
research will show this interesting little animal to be an inhabitant of
the interior western plains of this colony.
THE PERAMBLIM3 OR BANDICOOTS.
There are several genera and at least a dozen species of these pretty
little marsupials found in Australia, and Queensland has her fair
share. Space compels me to group them all under the common head
of bandicoot. The settler is certain to become acquainted with them,
for they make far too free with the sweet potatoes and other crops.
In size they vary from that of a rat to that of a rabbit. They can be
recognised at once by their elongated muzzle, short tail, and burrow-
ing habits. The fur is harsh, but with an under fur very soft; their
fore feet are short and weak; in appearance the bandicoot proper
( perameles ) is not unlike a miniature pig. Their food consists of
roots, grasses, insects, and small animals. The pouch in the female
has the opening the reverse way to that found in the kangaroos ; the
number of the young is four, although there are eight mammae.
These little creatures are very tame, frequently coming into the huts
at night time and picking up the crumbs on the floor notwithstanding
the presence of persons.
THE MONOTREMATA.
No essay upon the mammalia of this colony would be complete
without mentioning the two wonderful animals which comprise this
sub-section of the Marsupialia. The one is called by the colonists the
‘‘ porcupine,” and the other the “ duck-bill.”
THE SPINY ANT-EATEE OE ECHIDNA HTSTRIX.
This strictly Australian animal is common in Queensland. In
size it is about 18 inches in length, of stout, low build, and in appear-
ance somewhat like the hedgehog of England. The upper parts are
covered with strong spines, which are the natural defensive armour
of the animal; an armour indeed quite impregnable to all enemies


other than man, for, like the hedgehog, it has the habit of rolling
itself up into a ball when danger threatens; the strong spines then
protrude in all directions, and the animal remains thus rolled up until
the danger has disappeared. The face of the animal is prolonged into
a long sloping thin snout with a very small mouth-opening at the
end, and the tongue is long and flexible. Its food is supposed to be
ants and insects. It has no teeth, but some horny excresences on
the palate behind. This interesting creature is amazingly strong,
and can burrow with extreme rapidity, indeed, it has the most extra-
ordinary faculty of sinking out of sight of the observer, provided the
ground be loose or sandy. The male has a spur on the heel of the
hind foot, this spur is perforated and supplied with a secretion from
a special gland, but for what object is not known ; as there is no case
on record of injury from this spur it cannot be called poisonous. _ The
female possesses two small rudimentary pouches, in each of which a
minute young one has been observed; she has, however, no mammas,
but the milk exudes into the pouch. Through the Echidna the maisu-
pials are linked to the reptiles, and in many anatomical respects these
animals are one of the curiosities of nature in this southern vs orld.
THE PLATYPUS OR DUCK-BILL ( Ornithorhyncus .)
Curious as is the Echidna yet its interest pales before that of its
congener, the platypus, or water-mole, 4 his is without doubt the
most interesting of all the many interesting animals peculiar to Aus-
tralia. It is one of the wonderful links which nature now and
again presents, showing how one form of life can develop into
another. The platypus is the lowest living form yet discovered of the
mammalia, and through it the marsupials are connected with the
reptiles. The anatomical peculiarities of these pretty little water-
loving creatures are so great that they excited surprise and almost
doubt as to their reality when first presented to the naturalists of
Europe. The ornithorhyncus is common in many parts of Queens-
land ; being amphibious'it is never found away from the river banks,
where, during the day time, it sleeps in burrows. In appearance it is
not unlike a large mole, for it has the same dense fur and rounded,
sleek contour. But in size it is very much larger than the mole,
adult males being found 24 inches in length including the tail, which
is about 5 inches long, broad, and beaver-shaped. The body is broad,
flat, and reptile-like; it is carried close to the ground, for the
legs are short, but provided with five strong toes, which are webbed
in such a manner on the fore feet that the webs protrude when
swimming beyond the powerful claws and form perfect paddles. On
the heel of the hind foot of the male is a spur and gland, but whether
poisonous or no has not been satisfactorily decided. The head of this
curious animal terminates in a beak like a duck s hence the name.
The only teeth this animal possesses are four horn-like molars situ-
ated far back in the head. The eyes are very small, black, and bright,
and there is no external ear to be seen, but examination of the head
shows the natural orifice which the animal has the power of opening


or closing at will. These little creatures are perfectly harmless, they
can he seen about sunset swimming and diving in the still lagoons of
some water course. Their food consists of vegetable matter, insects,
small mollusca, and the ova of frogs and fishes, for the obtaining of
which their peculiar mandible is admirably adapted. Until lately
nothing was known of the manner of bringing forth their young, but
the researches of Mr. Caldwell, a young British scientist, who visited
Australia expressly to study the habits of the Monotremata, discovered
that this curious mammal is rendered still more curious by the fact
that the female lays eggs, which are afterwards hatched, and the young
nourished by the milk of the mother exuded from mammary glands,
although no teats are observable.
THE PLACENTAL MAMMALS.
THE DINGO.
Having completed the mention of all the different families
■of marsupials found in Queensland, I must give some notice
of the non-marsupial or placental mammalia or this paper will not
be complete. There are so few of them that the chapter will not be
a long one. The one deserving most notice is the Dingo or native
dog (canis dingo). Owing to the discovery of fossil remains of dogs
having been discovered in Australia it is now an accepted fact that
this animal is indigenous and has not been introduced, as many have
supposed. The dingo is essentially a dog, and the settler will recog-
nise it the first time he sees one. In colour it generally is of a
yellowish-red, or reddish brown, but sometimes it is black, with tan
underparts. Though varying in colour yet they are all of the one
species and all are alike in appearance, having a bushy fox-like tail
and a wolf-like head, and in size they are equal to that of a large
.shepherd’s-dog. They are very strong, agile, and fleet, and possess
also a large share of fox-like cunning; they also know and sometimes
practice the wolf-like habit of hunting in companies, though these
companies seldom exceed six or eight in number. They are very
destructive to the sheep and calves of the settlers, but strychnine has
now exterminated them from districts where they were once
numerous. The fact is the dingo and civilization cannot coalesce
and the dog is doomed. In many parts of Queensland they are still
very numerous, and their mournful howl at night time and particularly
during the winter months can frequently be heard even within a few
miles of Brisbane. The dingo breeds freely with any of the domesticdogs.
THE RODENTS.
The family of rodents, or rats, are the only animals, other than the
dingo, that belong to the placental mammals of Australia, excepting
of course those aerial mammals, the bats, and the sea animals, the seals,
dugongs, and porpoises. There are three genera and many species. In
size they vary from that of a common mouse to that of a large rat. At
times, some of the species increase to very great numbers in a most
unaccountable way until they become like a plague in the districts of
the interior plains, and these myriad hosts will just as quickly dis-


appear. There is one genera which jump on their hind legs like the
kangaroos, and there is another which build curious nests of twigs
in the hushes ; some live in burrows or cracks in the ground, and
some in the hollows of trees, but the most curious and beautiful of the
whole tribe is the Beaver-Rat ( Ilydromys ). These animals are
peculiarly Australian, as much so as the kangaroo. They are amphi-
bious in their habits, and are found almost in every water-hole or
creek. They dive well and are admirably constructed for an aquatic
life. Their food consists of moluscs, lish, and water insects, and they
are very partial to cream, according to the observations of the writer,
whose dairy used to be regularly visited by these animals living in
a neighbouring lagoon. The fur is beautifully dense, of a brown or
black colour on the back and head, but of a golden yelloAV or else
white on the underparts, and the tail is always tipped with wdiito or
yellow. They live in burrows in the banks of the river, and the female
produces four young at a litter. ' They, like many others of the rat
species, are frequently the prey of snakes.
THE K ALONG, OE “ FLYING FOX ” (Pteropus Poliocephalus.)
There are about two dozen species of bats found in Australia, five
or six of which are Fruit Bats, commonly called “Flying Foxes,”
probably on account of their rusty colour and somewhat fox-like head.
The species most commonly seen is about the size of a large squirrel
in the body, but the wings are enormous in proportion, for the
common measurement from tip to tip is four feet. These animals are
the most formidable pest that the orchard-owner in Queensland has
to encounter. They sally out at sunset from their camps or roosting-
places in countless numbers. A constant stream of them can bo
noted, all flying in one direction, until some orchard is espied, when
they dive down, and, in a very short time, commit frightful havoc
among the x-ipened fruits. Shooting has no effect upon the crowd,
for, though scores may be killed, yet hundreds and hundreds take
their place. No certain way of warding them off has yet been dis-
covered, but of late years the plan of burning sulphur has been found
to check them. During the day time they congregate in “ camps ”of
thousands, hanging from the topmost twigs of the loftiest trees in
clusters : they thus sleep out the day, head downwards. When one
of these haunts is discovered they can be shot in hundreds, for they
are loth to take wing during day-light. In the woods they live on
the wild figs and other fruits, the flowers of the bloodwood, gum-tree,
and ti-tree. They also are fond of honey, and probably devour insects
as well. Although they are sometimes called Yampires, they are
perfectly harmless to all animal life. Moreover, during the season of
the year that they are living upon honey-bearing flowers, they are by
no means bad eating when better food cannot be got. Their flight is
noiseless and with measured beat, but they can keep this up for many
miles, for it is no uncommon thing for them to visit orchards nightly
which are ten to twenty miles from their known camps. While feed-
ing, they are constantly quarrelling and screeching, and flying from


tree to tree. lam not aware that there is any creature that preys
upon them, hence their great numbers, notwithstanding that the female
has only one young at a birth.
ORNITHOLOGY,
The number of known species of birds common to Australia is
fully 700, and of these in all probability 600 are to be found in the
colony of Queensland. This laud of the marsupials is as rich in
curious and anomalous species of birds as it is in animals. There
are birds varying in size from the minute wrens to the gigantic
emu and cassowary; in colour, there are families that can vie
with the gorgeous trogons and parrots of the Indies ; in beauty,
with the humming birds, and some slioav peculiarities of construction
and habit found among the birds of no other country on earth. The
merest sketch of a few of the principal families will be all that space
will allow in this essay. For further information the student must
turn to Gould’s magnificent book upon the Birds of Atistralia.
RAPTORES.
The large and powerful birds of this order are not to be found in
Australia—that is, there are no vultures, condors, or large eagles.
Doubtless the absence of the larger herbivorous animals has some-
thing to do with this. However, there are eagles, ospreys, falcons,
kites, and harriers, in great numbers. The Wedge-tailed Eagle
(aquila audax ) is the common eagle-hawk of the colonies. It is the
noblest of our raptores; is universally distributed over the whole of
Australia, and is common upon the sheep farms of the interior plains,
where at times it causes much loss among the lambs. In courage it
does not come up to the golden eagle of the northern hemisphere, for
although it will and does pursue and kill the smaller species of
kangaroo, yet it prefers the more easily obtained carcass of the
already dead sheep or bullock, and the defenceless lamb. It also
chases the doe kangaroo until she ejects _ her young one from the
pouch, which the bird then immediately seizes. In size this eagle will
measure between six and seven feet from tip to tip of the wing, filie
talons are very powerful, and never relax their hold Avhen once a
grip is taken. In colour the birds vary from a light broAvn to a very
dark brown, almost black. They build gigantic nests in the fork of
some large gum tree or some solitary tree of an extensive plain.
The White-bellied Sea-Eagle (poliocetus leucogaster ) takes the
place upon the sea shores and bays that the wedge-tail does on the land,
but it has not the same pluck and courage. A smaller eagle very common
about the bays of Queensland is the White-breasted Sea-eagle ( hahashir
leucosternus.) The immigrant Avill recognise it as soon as the ship
enters the port, by the snow-white breast and head, contrasting Avitb
the rich chestnut-red of the upper parts and wings.
The Falcons {genus Falco ) are represented in this colony by the
Black and the Brown, and the Black-cheeked Falcons. Of these, the
former ( falco subniger) is the largest, strongest, and most daring, and


its powers of flight are very great. It and the brown falcons are
ihe constant attendants npon the drovers of the large herds of cattle
which traverse the continent. The advancing cattle cause the
quails to rise and fly, and these are then pounced upon by the falcons
and kites which are circling around and in front. The Kites ( milvus )
are the commonest birds of prey in Queensland. They are to be seen
in flocks of hundreds about every settler’s homestead, where they
perch upon the rails of the stockyards in the hopes of picking up offal
from the slaughtering of cattle, <fec. They are very bold, showing-
absolutely no fear of man. They fortunately seldom steal the poultry,
preferring more easily obtained food such as offal or grasshoppers.
There are several species of Hawks, Goshawks, Harriers, etc., and a
beautiful little Kestrel of a Nankeen colour; this bird exhibits the
same peculiarity of “ hovering” as does the European species. Many
of these hawks are very active and pertinacious in their attack upon
the poultry flocks of the settlers.
The night birds of prey have some fine noble species among them.
The Owls number some half-a-dozen or more species. In some dis-
tricts they are common, but, being night birds, they are not so often
seen, and many people even do not know that they exist in the colony.
The Great Owl (hieracoglaux Strenuus ) measures no less than 24 inches
in length ; it frequents the scrubs of the coast districts, sleeping during
the day in some dense scrubby tree ; it is a swift flyer, is powerful, and,
at night its loud sonorous note can be heard for a great distance.
The Boobook Owl (spiloglaux Boohook) is much smaller, and it is
more commonly seen than any of the family. The peculiarity of the
bird is its cry of “ Buck-buck,” “ Buck-buck; ” this can often be
heard at night, and upon a still evening even for over the distance of
a mile. It sounds so exactly like the English cuckoo’s note, that the
immigrant upon hearing it for the first time, at once puts it down as
that bird, and he is astonished to hear it at night time.
INSESSOEES.
This order of birds is represented in Queensland by numerous
species of numerous families, and they comprise some forms peculiar
to the country. A glance at a few of the more prominent will be all
that can be undertaken in this paper.
The settler will not have been long established in his new home in
the bush, before he makes the acquaintance of some species of the
family Capkimulgid® or Night-jars, the vulgar name for which is
“ goat-sucker.” These birds are nocturnal in their habits, they are
clothed with a peculiar moth-like plumage, and are noiseless in their
flight. Their peculiarity is the mouth, the enormous gape of which
astonishes the settler who sees it for the first time. At night, these
birds force themselves into notice by reason of their rather mournful,
but loud cry of “ more-pork,” “ more-pork,” slowly but frequently
repeated, and which, like the “ buck-buck ” of the owl, is one of the
voices of the night time in Australia. The bird is invariably called
“ more-pork ”by the colonist. There are several species of them.


some being very small; all have the same moth-like plumage and
soft sailing flight.
The Swifts and the Swallows have numerous representatives in
Queensland. One species of swift is almost identical with the
European species, but the other is a noble bird, the largest of the
swifts of the world, and the grandest flyer on the face of the earth.
It is the Spine-tailed Swift ( choetura caudacuta) . A native of India,
it nests in the Himalaya Mountains, and migrates for a summer
holiday to Australia. Its powers of flight are most marvellous,
indeed unequalled for rapidity and for ability to turn, and it is never
known to rest from flight until the shades of night drop around,
when it dives down and enters into the hollow spout of some old
eucalypt of the primeval forest.
There are several species of swallows in the colony and they have,
since the advent of ciAdlized man, adopted the social habits of their
congeners in the old world, and nest under the verandahs and eaves of
the houses, both in the towns and the country. Previously to houses
being built, they constructed their mud nests in hollow trees, and in
eaves and under projecting rocks. One species, the Welcome Swallow
(hirundo frontalis), is very like the English swallow, and is very com-
monly distributed. The Fairy Martin ( lagenoplastes ariel ) is another
graceful swallow which crowds its long-necked, hemispherical, mud
nests in scores under the verandahs.
The Bee-Eater (merops ornatus ) is very common in some parts of
the colony, more particularly in sandy country. It is elegant in shape,
graceful in flight, and beautiful in its green, blue, and orange plumage.
It nests in holes in the sand, the entrance to which is approached by a
tunnel, often two or throe feet in length. It is very destructive in the
neighbourhood of an apiary. It arrives in Queensland in the Spring
time. Another bird which arrives about the same time as the Bee-
Later is the Dollar-bird, or Australian Roller (eurystomus pacificus).
It is sure to force itself upon the settler’s notice by reason of its green
colour, its noisy chattering habit, and the peculiar white spot, about
the size of a dollar, that appears in each wing as it flies. Hence its
name. It nests in the holes of the gum-trees. It is useful by des-
troying the larger beetles and moths, &c.
The Kingfishers of this colony are individually very numerous, and
there are several species of live or six distinct genera. The most
noted of them is the “ Laughing Jackass” ( dacelo gigas ), a bird which
is one of the oddities of the Australias, and is now world-renowned for
its peculiarities, and absurdly comical, g'urgling, laughingnote or song.
1 he bird is very common, and there is not a homestead in the country
that it does not visit, for it shows little fear of man, indeed it is one
of those birds which takes kindly to the advent of civilized man,
attending him while engaged in ploughing, or gardening, and always
on the lookout for any lizard, young snake, mouse, or other vermin
that shows itself. Then this stolid, ungainly bird flies down from its
observing place on some neighbouring tree, nips up its prey, flies back
again to the branch, and, after beating the victim to death, swallows


it whole, and gives vent to its satisfaction by pouring out its loud and
hearty laugh. This laugh is the first sound the bushman hears in the morn-
ing, and the last at night. The bird is in consequence frequently
called the settler’s clock, is a universal favourite, and is seldom
shot, except by the thoughtless boy. In colour it is brown, the head
and beak are large, and as it ruffles the crest feathers frequently, this
makes the head appear larger than it is, and still more ungainly. The
nest is simply the decayed wood of a hollow spout of a gum tree, and
the eggs are white. The other Kingfishers are all more or less blue
in colour, like the Alcyone of Europe. One species that frequents
the river’s banks is very similar in appearance and habits to the Eng-
lish bird; but others, which are common about the homesteads do not
trouble themselves about the water, but in their habits are similar to
those of the Laughing Jackass. The names of the two most common
species are the Sacred Kingfisher (halcyon sanctus), and the M‘Leay
Kingfisher (cyanalcyon Macleayi) . The last named bird can easily
be distinguished by reason of its white collar.
The or Wood-swallows are a family of birds, the head-
quarters of which is in Australia. There are several species of them,
and the immigrant will recognise them when he observes a group of
birds, about the size of a starling, and of a brown or grey color, which
from time to time fly from the branch they are perched upon, and
sail in a swallow-like manner, until the insect that is being hunted is
caught, when they return to the same branch. They are fearless of
man, and frequently nest in trees near the homestead; like the bee-
eater, they are fatal to bees, and will soon decimate an apiary.
The Pardaloies are another family of birds peculiarly Australian.
There are several species of them, all of small size, all very prettily
marked with dots or spots of yellow or red or black. They all have a
sweet plaintive note, which is incessantly uttered. _ They would
escape the notice of any but the observant settler, if it were not for
their habit of burrowing tunnels, three feet in length, in the sides of
the wells and water-holes, at the end of which they excavate a cham-
ber, and build a loosely formed nest. The common name for them is
Diamond bird. .
There are no true Shrikes in Australia, but there is a family ot
Crow-shrikes, some species of which are common in Queensland.
The members of one genus are called Butcher-birds, and well they
deserve the name, for they are bold and ruthless destroyers of small
birds, their eggs and young ; also, they hesitate not to fly under the
verandah, and tear the canary from its cage ; the long thin beak, with
its powerful hook at the end, being admirably formed for this purpose.
The bushmen give them the absurd name of “YanDieman’s Land
-jackass,” presumably because of some slight resemblance they have to
the laughing jackass. They have a musical melodious song, but of
short duration.
The Australian Magpie is classed among these Crow-shrikes.
This is a noble bird —handsome in its contrasting colors of black and
white. Like the laughing jackass, it is a universal favorite, and it is


found about every farm in the southern and interior plains of the
colony. Its powers of song eclipse those of any other Australian bird.
During the nesting season its loud organ-like notes are constantly
heard, and are indescribably sweet and liquid. The birds are easily
tamed, and show equally as much cunning and sense as does the mag-
pie of Europe. They learn to talk, and repeat the words clearly and
distinctly. A tame one is generally to be seen hopping about every
homestead in the bush. There are several species of them, and they
are among the farmers’ best friends, eating all kinds of insects
destructive to the crops.
The Magpie-Lark (grallina picata) is another bird seen about every
homestead, provided there is water in the neighbourhood. Its shrill
whistling note is a common sound of the farm. The bird is about the
size of, and not unlike, the English lapwing, and it will be easily
recognised by this description, coupled with its pied black and white
plumage. It builds a large nest of mud on some bare branch over-
hanging the water.
The family of Flycatchers ( Muscicapidoe ) has many representatives
in Australia, all of which ar eto be found in Queensland. Some of the
species are very common both in the country and in the town suburbs.
Following the aim of this essay, which is just to speak of such birds
as are sure to be seen by the immigrant, or else are of such peculiarity
as to demand special notice—•
I must mention the Black Fantail (sauloprocta motacilloides).
This bird is universally distributed over the whole of Australia. It
is one of the most tame and familiar of birds, evincing not the slightest
fear of man or animal. It is constantly in motion, skipping about
the horses, the cattle, the sheep, and snapping up the flies that
torment them. It flies on to the back, runs along, mounts on to the
horns, snapping at the flies, and all the time incessantly opening and
shutting its tail and its wings, and uttering its short cheerful chirping-
note. It is well named the “shepherd’s companion,” for it is his
constant attendant, his cheerful little mate. Some of the species are
triumphant architects, constructing closely-felted nests of elegant,
wineglass-shaped form.
The Robins are by no means left behind when the immigrant sails
from the “ old country.” Under the family name of Saxicolidai there
are nearly a score of species of many different colours, and yet they
are all robins in appearance. Accustomed as the British farmer is to
the sombre hue of the Redbreast, he will be astonished beyond
measure the first time he sees perched upon the furrow slice he has
just ploughed, the gorgeous scarlet, black and white robins of Aus-
tralia. The contrast of these colours is so vivid that it excites
involuntary surprise. The head and upper parts are black, with
white on the wings, and a white tip on the forehead, and the whole of
the breast is vivid geranium scarlet. They show all the boldness and
familiarity of their European prototype, and in habits and manners
are very similar, but they do not nest on the ground in banks; on
the contrary they construct a beautifully neat, chaffinch-like nest in


the fork of a tree, or between the loose bark of the tree trunk. The
scarlet-breasted species is only seen in the southern plains-land of
Queensland. Its place is taken upon the farms of the scrub lands
and of the river banks by the Yellow-breasted Robin, which, how-
ever, is a more retiring bird. Other species are the red-capped, the
pied, the brown, the white eye-browed, &c.
The Lyre-bird ( menura ) is one of the curiosities of Australia,
but unless the immigrant settles in the densely-wooded mountain
districts of the southern part of Queensland, he is not likely ever to
see it in a state of nature. The bird is about the size of a game fowl,
but it is higher on the legs, which are especially formed for running ;
its colour is a dark-brown. Its peculiarity consists in the tail, which
is identical in shape to that old fashioned musical instrument, the
lyre. There are three species; the one that is found in Queens-
land being called Prince Albert’s Lyre-bird, in distinction to one
common to the Southern Australian Colonies which is called
Queen Victoria’s Lyre-bird, but the difference between it and the
Hew South Wales bird is problematical. The birds are most
wonderful vocalists, they are indeed the mocking bird of Australia,
imitating accurately every sound of the bush.
The Wrens ( Maluri ) are numerous individually, and of many
species. Unlike the sombre-coloured Jenny-wren of Europe
the Queensland birds are marvellous little gems of beauty. They
are excelled only by the finches in the lovely contrasting of
their brilliant colouring. Among them is to be seen deep cerulian
blue contrasted with jet velvety black; red with black; blue
with white, and in others a blending of the whole of these
colours. They go in families of six or eight, flitting about from bush
to bush; every now and again the gorgeous-coloured male, —the
father of the group, —mounts on to some topmost twig and utters his
lively, shrill little song, as if anxious to draw attention to his beauty.
The females and young males are invariably a sombre brown in
colour. The whole of the species construct domed nests placed in
tussocks of grass.
The Finches (FringilUdce ) of Australia number as many species
as do the wrens, and individually, are far more numerous. The settler
will come across many varieties. It is with regret that I shall have
to curtail my writing concerning these lovely birds into a paragraph,
for there are several genera, all showing distinct peculiarities and
containing several species each, and yet they all are finches. All
the species build large, loosely-constructed domed nests of grasses,
and some of which have a spout-like entrance projecting from the
top; all the eggs are white and barely distinguishable one species
from another. In colour these birds show in some species the same
contrasts of bright scarlet, against black, or brown, or white as do the
robins ; some, again, are beautifully spotted white on black and others
with black on white ; a fiery-red over the tail shows conspicuously in
some species, and there is another which is wholly of a blood-crimson
colour. Some are uniform olive-brown, and some brown and white ; a


peculiarity of one genus is the curious masked markings of the face
and head, and there is another genus called poephilla, or grass lovers,
the several species of which are the most elegantly beautiful combina-
tion of colours outside of the butterfly world. Anything more lovely
than the Gouldian Grass-finch it is not possible to find, even among
the humming birds of the Indies. It is pleasing to think that the
ornithologist, who has done so much to make the birds of Australia
known to the world, has so beautiful a gem named after him. It is
an everlasting monument to his genius. Unfortunately the bird is
uncommon, being only found in a limited district of Queensland.
The family Paradiseidoe are represented in Australia by the world-
renowned Bower-Birds. There are four or five species of them, all
to be found in Queensland. In size these birds are about that of a
large missel thrush, but plumper in form. Some of the species are
very beautiful, notably the Satin-bird (ptilonorhyncus holosericeus), the
male of which has the whole of the plumage of a deep shining blue-
black resembling satin, and the Regent-bird ( sericulus melinus), the
male of which has a gorgeous livery of golden yellow, and deep
velvety black. Other species are fawn-coloured, with more or less
iridescent mauve-like collars upon the back of the neck. The whole
of the species are fruit-eaters, and at times very destructive to the
gardens. The peculiarity of the family is their habit of constructing
bowers of twigs and grasses, erected on end and arching over like a
bower. This structure is about one to two feet in length by a breadth
that enables the bird to run easily through it. Shells, bits of bones,
feathers, stones, and anything gay-coloured or glittering are collected,
and placed about the bowers as ornaments. These are not nests, but
are used simply as courting grounds, and playing places. Each
species makes its own peculiar shaped bower, some being longer and.
more elaborately decorated than others.
The Crow ( corvus Australis) is to be found everywhere over the
whole of Australia. Wherever there is a dead animal, large or small,
whether in the forest, or on the plain, by the side of the sea shore, or
in the far interior desert land, there is the crow. He is the universal
scavenger and also destroys more bird’s eggs than any other creature
in the country. However, he is outwitted by the gigantic cuckoo
(Scythrops novae, hollandioe), which lays its eggs in the nest; thus
the crow becomes foster parent to the young one.
The Honey-Eaters (family Meliphagidce ) are the most special
feature of Australian Ornithology, nevertheless, I shall have to curtail
my description of them down to a single paragraph. The ornithologist
Gould, in writing of this extensive family, says, “ They are to the
fauna of Australia, what the Eucalypti, Banksice and Melaleucce are to
the flora. The economy of these birds is so strictly adapted to those
trees, that the one appears essential to the other; for what can be more
plain than, that the brush-like tongue is especially formed for gather-
ing the honey from the flower cups of the Eucalypti, or that their
diminutive stomachs are especially formed for this kind of food, and
the peculiar insects, which constitute a portion of it.” There ai’O


fully sixty species of these birds, and they comprise many of graceful
form, and elegant plumage. In size they range from about four inches,
including the tail, to about twelve inches. Amongst them aie some
sweet songsters, though of no great power. Others are incessantly
chattering, so much so, as to have been named the “ garrulous honey-
eaters.” Others again exhibit an air of comicality in their rich
vocalism, apparently uttering such words as “ four o’clock ! four
o’clock!” etc. Some species are of a sombre-brown, or olive-green,
while others show yellow in all its brilliance. Yet, another has an
intensity of scarlet over the whole of the head, neck, breast, back and
upper-tail coverts. In Queensland there is allied to this family the
Sun-bird ( nectarina Australis ) which, by nature of its form, and its
long curved bill is the . nearest approach to the humming bird that
Australia possesses.
There are no wood-peckers in Australia, but their place is occupied
by numerous Tree Creepers ( dimacteres) and the Sitellas ( sitellce •)
which are frequently seen climbing the trunks of the trees, or cling-
ing back downwards to the branches.
The Cuckoos exist in Australia, but they are not regarded as the
harbingers of spring as in the old world, neither is their song that of
the familiar “ cuckoo, cuckoo.” There are several species of them,
varying in colour from one similar to the European cuckoo, to that of
deep glossy, greenish, blue-black, with scarlet eye. Others are of a
beautiful metallic bronze colour, with the cuckoo-like bars on the
breast and belly. The smallest of the family is the Bronze Cuckoo
(lamprococcyx minutillus ) which has a total length of five and a half
inches, and the largest is the gigantic Channel-bill ( scythrops ) called
by the colonists the “ hornbill,” and which, as before stated, is para-
sitic upon the White-eyed crow. A genus which is not parasitic is
the Centropus or Pheasant-coucal. This bird is very common in
Queensland, and is sure to be roused up from the grass by the settler
on his farm. It is commonly called the “pheasant,” on account of
its pheasant-like appearance and long tail. It is a poor flyer, being
very weak in wing development. The nest is placed in a tussock of
grass, is composed of grass, and is sometimes domed over.
The family Psittacida, or Parrots. No group of birds will so
attract the eye of the immigrant, and cause him to realise that he is
in a foreign and tropical country, as will the cockatoos and parrots.
They are exceedingly numerous individually, and also as regards
their varieties. To do justice to their peculiarities and their beauty,
would require a volume, all that can be attempted here, is a glance at
a few of the leading varieties, most commonly seen by the settler.
There are several White Cockatoos, all of which congregate in flocks,
and all of which, when caged, can be taught to speak with more or
less fluency. The best known is the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo
(cacatua galerita), which is a bird of large size and of pure snow-
white plumage, excepting that on the head is a sulphur-coloured
crest, which is constantly being raised and lowered. These birds
exist in countless numbers in some localities, and are very destructive


to the newly sown cornfields of the farmer. Their wariness is so
great that it is difficult to approach near enough to shoot them, when
engaged in these pillaging expeditions. The Long-billed Cockatoo
(licmetis tenuirostris ), commonly called “corella,” in undoubtedly
the best “talker” of all the species. Its powers of vocalization are
simply wonderful, and its intelligence is so great that after some years
of domestication, it certainly is able to associate certain phrases with
certain effects. The birds aie not so common as the sulphur-crested,
for they are peculiar to the interior plains. They have no crest; the
long bill is a good distinguishing mark. Other cockatoos that are
kept in cages are the Little Corella (Z. pastinator), the Rose-breasted
Cockatoo (0. rosiecapilla) , which is of a grey colour on the upper
surface, and rose-red on the head, breast, and under parts. There
is one bird caged within a few feet of the writer, as he is penning
this paper, and it is incessant in its efforts to attract the attention of
the children by crying out “ Who are you ?” “ Naughty boy, cockey,”
“No, cockey’s pretty,” etc., etc. Many of the different species of
parrots and paroquets are also kept as pets, and some of which learn
to talk well, but in a whistling tone of voice.
There could not possibly be a greater contrast to the white cocka-
toos than are the several species of Black Cockatoos. These comprise
the largest known species of the family, and some of them are very
handsome, the dense black of the general plumage being relieved by
brilliant scarlet bars across the tail; or yellow, or scarlet and yellow,
or by yellow mai'kings upon the body plumage. None of the black-
coloured species are so commonly seen as the white birds, and there
is a popular notion that their presence foretells rain, but the writer’s
observations by no means confirm the statement.
The exquisite beauty of the paroquets of the country is beyond
desci'iption and it is useless attempting to depict it by words. To the
immigrant, fond of ornithology, the field that opens up before him as
he lands in this colony is one of beauty and interest, the
psittacidos alone being a theme of study worthy of a life-time. Among
them are the elegant polytelis, the gorgeous lories and platycerci,
which last named genus includes those beautiful and common birds
the Rose-bill paroquets. The grass-paroquets are the personification
of elegant, grace, and beauty; one little species, the warbling grass-
paroquet, which the reader may doubtless have seen in the bird shops
of London, under the name of “love birds,” the writer has frequently
met with in countless thousands, nesting among the stunted eucalypts
of the interior level country.
EASOEES.
This order of birds would be sparingly represented in Australia
were it not for the Pigeons, family Golumhidcs. Of these there are
over twenty species, the great majority of which are to be found in
Queensland. They are everywhere, in the forests, in the scrubs, and
on the far inland plains. The fruit-pigeons of the scrubs vie with
the parrots in the superb colouring of their plumage a,nd the beautiful
metallic and varying hues of these colours The species that frequent


the interior plains, or that seek their food upon the ground, are of
more sombre appearance, as befits their exposed habitats. These
species exist in incredible numbers upon the interior plains of
Queensland; they are gregarious except at the breeding season, and
are much preyed upon by hawks, dingos, and the natives. The
Bronze-wings of the forest land are greatly sought after by the sports-
man, as they are exceedingly delicate eating. All the species are
considered as game, and are a frequent dish upon the tables of the
settler. There are several species of small doves, which are as elegant
in form, graceful in manner, and beautiful in their plumage as the
well-known turtle-dove of Europe.
This order of birds also embraces that curious family the Mega-
podidoe, the nesting habits of which are so extraordinary. The
Queensland representative is the Wattled Talegallus (T. Lathami).
The settler upon the coast lands of the colony is certain to come
across it, for it is the “ wild turkey ” of the colonists, and is constantly
in demand for the table. It is one of the anomalies of the animal life of
Australia, so much so that it has puzzled naturalists in what family
to place it. In size the bird is about that of a small turkey, and in
appearance very similar, the wattles of the head and neck adding greatly
to this similarity. Its colour is blackish-brown. The most remark-
able circumstance connected with the bird is that the eggs are not
incubated in the manner of other birds, but are deposited two or three
feet deep in mounds of earth and vegetable matter. These heaps are
often truly gigantic when considered as the work of birds, for the
writer has seen them eight feet high by a circumference of even sixty
feet. They are constructed in dense scrub, and the method adopted
by the bird is to grasp a foot-full of material and throw it backwards
as if kicking. The muscles of their legs are very strongly developed,
and when kept in captivity the birds are incessantly throwing
material from one end of their yard to the other. The same mounds
are used year after year, only some fresh material is annually added.
When the laying season commences the birds scratch out holes in this
mound and deposit the egg, large end up, at the bottom; fresh
decaying vegetable matter is then added and the egg left to chance. In
due time the young bird is hatched fully developed, works its own
way out, and is perfectly able to take care of itself. As the scrubs
get cleared these birds will become scarce, but there is no reason why
they should not become an addition to our domesticated poultry.
Quails are also common game birds of the country, and are univer-
sally distributed. In scientific eyes there is only one true quail, the
other species being of a genus more allied to the partridge. Whoever
is fond of shooting, can, if living near plains or cultivated fields,
always have a days’ sport, provided a good dog can be obtained, other-
wise the birds lie so close that they will only rise when the sportsman
is close upon them.
The Emu (dromaius novas-hollandia) is the largest of Australian
birds, and is so well known both in Britain and in the colonies that
description is unnecessary. It is not equal in size to the ostrich, nor


is it as graceful in its movements and appearance, neither are the
feathers of any value. The settler is not likely to see the birds in a
state of nature unless he travels into the far interior plains. As
settlement progresses they are bound to become extinct. The eggs
are large, about six inches in length, and are of a beautiful dark green
colour; they are laid in a shallow cavity in sandy soil, and both
parents take part in incubating them.
Queensland also possesses the Cassowary (casuarius Australis), a
bird which is only second to the emu in size and ostrich-like appear-
ance. It is an inhabitant of the scrubs of the extreme north When
erect the bird Avill stand about five feet high; the head is bare of
feathers, but covered with a bright-blue skin and is surmounted by a
helmet of horn of a bright red colour. The bird is not common, and
in all probability will soon share the fate of all large wild animals
and birds—namely, extinction.
Another of the large game birds of the colony is the A ustralian
(choriotis australis) commonly celled the Plain Turkey.
These birds have a very stately air as they walk the plains; they
attain to a height of three feet to the top of the head from the ground.
The male will often weigh as much as fifteen pounds, but the female
is considerably smaller. Yearling birds are excellent for the table.
The birds are seldom shot, except the shooter be on the back of a
hoise or in a vehicle, for it is next to impossible for a foot-sportsman
to get within gunrange. As they only lay one or (sometimes) two
&ml that only once a year, they also bid fair to be eventually
exterminated.
Of Plovers, Dottrels, Sandpipers, and Curlews, there are many
species to be found in the colony, and there is also a Snipe, almost
identical with that of Europe. The Curlew is noted for the par-
ticularly mournful wail which it gives voice to at night time. The
Whimbrel is found all along the shores and bays, and is as noisy in
the day time as the curlew is at night. Of the Ibis there are several
species, including the well-known Sacred Ibis of Egypt. The
gigantic Jabiru, which is to be found on the marshes and lagoons,
is a noble bird, in appearance like a crane, and which, when walking
erect, measures fully five feet in height.
The Ardeida: or Herons, as also the Egrets and Spoonbills are of
many species, and are very commonly distributed. In colour they vary
from pure white to delicate nankeen-brown, and from grey to black.
Many are adorned with elegant head plumes, and their snow-white
plumage, and statuestic forms, as they stand knee-deep in the water,
make cpiite a prominent feature in the water-side scenes of this country.
NATATORES.
Of the birds of this order the immigrant will see many, for he will
be constantly coming across ducks, geese, pelicans, and the black
swan, while upon erery water-hole he will be sure to see some one of
the many species of cormorants and grebes.


The Australian Wild Duck (anas superciliosa), and also the Teal
(a. punctata ) are universally distributed over the whole of the conti-
nent, either inland or along the sea shores. They are both considered
excellent eating, and are consequently much sought after by sports-
men They are now protected in all the colonies during the
breeding season; a wise precaution, for the keenness with which they
were sought after was fast leading to a diminution of their numbers.
There a?e several other species of ducks, some of which are
individually of excessive numbers. Two or three species of the Wild
Goose are to be found in Queensland, and they also are hunted for the
table. Individually they are not nearly so numerous as the ducks,
but they are gregarious, and at certain seasons flocks of great numbers
ftro seen. . -i • j
The Black Swan (chenopis atrata ) is peculiarly an Australian bird.
One time the rara avis of the world, it is here common to bay and
marsh. The black plumage and musical voice attract attention from
afar, and the settler is sure, sooner or later, to have the pleasure of
seeing it. Easily tamed ; these birds are to be seen on the orna-
mental waters of our public parks and gardens They are considered
game, but require the skill of a good cook to make them truly
eil3 Another large bird, which will be seen frequenting the same feeding
grounds as the Swan, is the Pelican (pellicanus conspicillatus.) ibis
is a truly noble bird, fully equal to the European species in size, and is
shot for the sake of the skin, which, when property cured,
makes excellent muffs and tippets. These birds are found in large
flocks upon the sea-side, bays, and creeks, and in companies of from a
dozen to twenty upon the far interior water holes of the river-beds.
In these latter places they are exceedingly destructive to fish, and they
also prey largely upon the mussels and crayfish. ,
Along the sea shores, and over the bays, inlets, seas and oceans that
surround Australia are to be found many species of Gulls, Ferns,
Gannets, Petrels, Albatrosses, and Frigate-birds. Tnese I cannot
attempt in this essay even to name. _ . , . , 1
Enough has been written to show the immigrant what a vast field
there is before him if his inclinations lead towards the study of orni-
thology. He will notice that the old world forms are represented in
this southern and most ancient of the earth’s countries by species
analagous, but seldom identical. The student of development will
have a fresh and extensive field for following out the why and tle
wherefore of the anomalous forms, the peculiar habits, the remarkable
nidification, and the extreme beauty and valuations of the species
and genera. He will, indeed, as mentioned in the introductoiy
chapter of this essay, have before him a book of nature always opening
upon a new page.
■ A , THE REPTILES.
The reptiles peculiar to Australia are numerous and some of them
dangerous to life. The object of this paper is just to mention such
as are thus dangerous so that they can be avoided by the immigrant.


The Snakes have many representative species in Queensland, and
the individuals of some of them are very numerous. All our snakes
are not venomous, indeed, taking a given number casually seen during
the course of several years residence in Queensland, about one half
will have been of innocuous species. This fact is mentioned in order
to calm the mind of any one who may be bitten, and so prevent undue
fear, which may cause a foolish action to be taken, such as chopping
off the finger or hand.
One of the commonest snakes of the colony is the Carpet Snake
(morelia variegata). It is also the largest snake found in Australia,
tor in Northern Queensland it has been obtained up to twenty
feet in length. It has a villainous-looking mouth and set of teeth
with which it can bite severely, yet it is non-venomous. It belongs
to the Boa-constrictor tribe, inasmuch as it kills its prey by envelop-
ing it in the folds of its long body, and afterwards swallowing it whole.
Sooner or later the settler, on the farm or in the country, will be
certain to make its acquaintance, for it will find out the fowl-house
and commit havoc there. It can be at once recognised by its mottled
olive-brown and yellow skin, and its sluggish habits. It will bite
severely when wounded. In habit it is nocturnal, but it also some-
times is found travelling during daylight.
The Green Tree Snake is another very common species in Queens-
land. It haunts the climbing plants that cover the verandahs of the
houses, its object being to prey upon the frogs that live in the spouting
and water tanks. It can be recognised by its long thin whip-like appear-
ance, and by the upper parts being a dark olive-brown or green, and
sometimes even black, and the under parts more or less yellow.
Also, the belly scales are placed flat on the ground, and are not
rounded as in terrestial snakes. In length it reaches six feet. It is
amazingly active, and disappears like a flash of light. It is entirely
non-venopious, and will bite no one unless injured. There are several
species of them, all non-venomous.
The Brown Tree Snake is also non-venomous, but it is of altogether
different build and looks ugly enough to be thought dangerous. Its
colour is that of a copper-brown above, the belly being salmon-coloured;
its length is about six feet, but its thickness through the body is
fully twice that of the green snakes, for it will sometimes measure
two inches whereas the others seldom exceed one inch. This snake
can be recognised by the colour and the shortened tail. Its habits
are nocturnal, while those of the green tree-snakes are diurnal. There
are several other non-venomous snakes, chiefly of small size; also
there are the small blind-snakes, which will be found sometimes when
digging the garden, they again are perfectly harmless.
There are two very common and very frequently seen snakes in
Queensland, which are deadly venomous, insomuch, that a bite will
prove fatal to man or beast unless instant precautions are taken.
These two are the Black Snake and the Brown Snake (pseudechis and
diemenia.) There are several species of each of them recognised by
the naturalist, but to the ordinary observer they may all be classed


as above. The black snake is intensely black upon the upper side
from bead to tail, bnt tbe belly is sometimes bright red, sometimes
salmon-coloured, and again yellow. When alarmed it raises front
third of its body off the ground, bends forward the head which is
flattened , and is ready to strike certain death upon its enemy. When
in this attitude it does not wait to be injured before striking. The
flattening of the head is a certain sign of anger, and at once dis-
tinguishes the venomous nature of the species, insomuch that none of the
non-venomous snakes practice the habit. In length the black snake
averages about four to five feet, and in thickness about two to three
inches. There is apparently very little neck, that is the head and
neck are much of the same thickness, and this again is a distinguish-
ing mark of the venomous from the non-venomous sorts, for the
latter have a distinct head joined upon a much narrower neck. The
black snake is both diurnal and nocturnal in its habits, and is particu-
larly fond of haunting swamps and river banks, though it is found in
all localities. It can swim well, indeed is fond of the water. Always
approach it with caution! One blow from a stick will, however,
disable it.
The Brown Snake attains to even a greater length and greater
thickness than the black snake. Its average length on the coast
lands is about five to six feet, but upon the interior western plains
it is frequently met with eight feet in length. In young specimens
the belly is yellow-spotted, but in aged individuals these disappear,
and the whole snake is of a brown colour. In the writer’s opinion it
is even more deadly in its bite than the black snake, for he has seen
strong healthy bullocks succumb in a few hours to its terrible venom.
Also he can positively attest that it will sometimes even when
unprovoked attack both man and horse. So that a person attempting
to kill one must always act with caution. As a rule one sharp blow
with a stick or whip will break the vertebrae of any snake, this renders
it unable to travel and it can be killed at leisure.
Ho specific antidote has yet been discovered to the poison of these
snakes. There have been many so called discoveries, notably that of
Underwood and also of Shires, but both these, when tested by
medical experts, proved useless. The only action that can be taken
is to tie a ligature tightly round the limb between the bite and the
heart, and then to cut the wound so as to make it bleed freely, or to
suck it forcibly. Send at once for a medical man and, in the mean-
time, keep up the depression that will ensue, by frequent drinks of
strong spirits of any sort. A man can consume a bottle of spirits in a
very short time, if bitten by a venomous species, and yet he
will not get drunk. It should always be remembered that to the
strong man who is bitten, there is the chance of life if the above pre-
cautions are taken; much depends upon whether the snake was
extremely angry, as when wounded, or whether merely annoyed, as
when touched or trod upon, for the reptile has the power to eject
at will, more or less poison ; again, the quantity of poison decreases
rapidly with every bite. Much also depends upon the state of health


of the bitten person, and whether, through nervousness, he allows
fear to overcome him.
. r^ie hhsA/m Adder (acanthophis antartica) is another species which
is equally as venomous as the two just mentioned. This snake can
be at once recognised by its short length—only about twenty inches—
and its breadth in proportion—fully two to three inches—and its
peculiarly shortened tail which terminates in a point like a gigantic
sting. Ihe danger of the reptile lies in its poison fangs and not in
this tail. It is very sluggish, never troubling to move out of the Avay;
it frequents sandy country and is often found under logs when
the latter are moved. It is nocturnal in its habits.
. ' rhe immigrant should remember that, as a rule, if a healthy man
is bitten by any snake not thicker in the neck than his little finger
that it will not be fatal. If possible obtain the snake that inflicted the
bite, it may prove to be a harmless species, and so save from much
agony of mind and useless cutting and doctoring. There is one
invariable rule by which Australian venomous snakes can be dis-
tinguished from the non-venomous. It is this :—Count the lip-scales
of the upper lip if there are only six on each side, of the nasal or
front shield or scale, then the snake is venomous; if there are more
than six, then the snake is not venomous. The lower lip shields also
aie only six in the poisonous species, never more, with the single
exception of the death adder, which has seven in the lower lip but
only six in the upper. This distinguishing mark should be remem-
ieied by all. It is only applicable to Australian colubrine snakes and
not to the sea-snakes nor to the blind snakes, nor to snakes of other
countries.
ALLIGATOES.
, The onl y other reptile dangerous to mankind, found in Queensland,
is the Crocodile or Alligator, which is numerous upon all the tropical
rivers of the colony that have not been disturbed to too great an
extent, by the adyent of civilization. As a rule, it is never a safe
practice to swim in any tidal stream in the north of the colony. Our
alligators do not confine themselves exclusively to tidal waters, the
writer having several times seen them attack cattle in waters above
the influence of the tide.
. Tnere is another and smaller species called Phyllus Johnsonii, which
is numerous in the upper waters of the rivers that flow into the Gulf
of Carpentaria, but this novel species never attacks man or animals,
its principal food being fish and sometimes waterfowl.
There are many gigantic lizards—commonly called Iguanas, which
are numerous in the colony, but, though diabolical looking, they are
all harmless as regards their bite. Turtles of large size are found in
all the coastal waters, and small fresh-water species in the interior
rivers.
