iailtrajf and jCaait foliqt,
NEAELY ten years since at the request of political friends, to some
of whom ripening years and more mature experience seem now
to have brought different convictions, I wrote a couple of pamphlets
upon the policy of the times, which attracted some attention,* and I was
told, exerted some small influence upon the public. It was a gloomy
period one of distrust and apprehension and yet one of a kind in
which colonies in the hope of hastening extrication from difficulty are
often ready to rush into any public enterprise which seems likely to
afford an opening for the introduction of capital and the employment
of labor. To those who remember it, the railway panacea in its trans-
continental and other forms are no novelties, and the arguments of which
we hear so much now are but reproductions of what was urged with
at least equal eloquence then. To point out the real financial condi-
tion of the colony at the time—to dissuade from speculative undertakings
until happier prospects dawned upon the horizon and at the same
time to show as far as in me laid, that with caution and judgment
there was no real ground for despondency were the congenial tasks
suggested to me by politicians of no mean note. In so far as those
tasks were successfully performed there was room for congratulation;
apart from that kind of satisfaction there is little of pleasure to be
anticipated from the discharge of any such duty. You may at once
convince and alienate, and the greater the success the' more bitter the
exasperation. Unhappily too in colonial public life political differences
cannot apparently exist without personal rancour. The first idea of
an ordinary colonial politician seems to be to suspect his opponents’
motives; —that opposition can spring from conviction is seldom conceded;
some personal gain is to be made, some personal end to be carried.
Whoever enters such an arena holding an impartial course may be sure
of provoking enmity on every side. It may be—and my twenty years
of political life does not enable me to contradict the assumption as fully
* Fhc Financial History of Queensland, and The Railway History of Queensland, published in 1870


as I should like to be able to do that there is some truth in the
belief that present and personal expediency have exercised far greater
influence upon the conduct of public affairs in Queensland than honest
abstract or well reasoned fundamental principle; and such a fact will
go far to account for the little localism and undignified bitterness we see
daily increasing in our midst in dealing with public topics. That
dangerous and debasing tendency is certainly not less intense now than
it was in 1870. I regret this—regret it the more because to me it
seems that the troubles of the times are darker; that the depression
is heavier; that the gloom is more dense; that the causes of evil are
more wide spread and lasting than they were at that time; and that
if ever there could be call for a tolerant combination in counsel and
unanimity of effort on behalf of the common interest we have it enforced
upon us now. To be sure the differences of opinion upon leading
points were more essential so to speak ten years since than they seem
to have been of late. Then the stand-point of one party was the indis-
pensability of financial adjustment as a condition precedent to railway
extension in any shape : whatever move was made in that direction
was from what was termed the liberal side of the Legislature. Mr.
Macalister had made the air resonant with prophesy of the gain and
glory of a great central line: Mr. Lilley and the late Mr. Atkin were
competitors in pushing forward their several schemes : Mr. Palmer and
Mr. Eamsay were firm in opposition to the whole. At the present time
the leaders on both sides seem agreed upon the propriety of constructing
lines although the priority of branches over trunk ones is subject of
debate amongst their respective followers: and the contention looks to
me to have been in some measure narrowed as to whether the Ministry
were not bound to show how provision could be made for the interest
of their railway loan before asking for legislative sanction to contract it.
It may however be that the kind of reasoning based upon the com-
mercial and financial position of the colony which was held valid as
against railway or loan enterprises in 1870 is far more irrefutable in
the present state of affairs—that the colony is now less able to bear
enlargement of debt —that the advantages of railway extension are more
doubtful to-day—than was the case then. So believing, I, not uninvited,
propose by reference to our past history to trace the grounds for con-
victions which although not yet publicly expressed I know to be felt
to a much greater extent than the surface of public opinion would show.
Such a process is one less of advocacy than of exposition, and in the
statement of facts and in the deductions that may legitimately follow
from them what are called party interests are necessarily very secondary
considerations. In such a reference I do not intend to waste time or
space in allusions to the persons who have contributed to form that


history or in criticisms upon their conduct. What Treasurer or Ministry
fell into grievous error or which of their censors were more in the wrong
than they were, whosoever is curious on such points may find for him-
self. The facts which exhibit the condition of Queensland and its causes
are what I have to deal with : so far as diligence in collection and
collation can render my statement accurate I think they will be found to
be so. Of the conclusions deduced I take the full and sole responsibility.
I intend then to show what the position of the colony was at the
end of the year 1865—the year immediately preceding the panic and
distress of 1866; the causes which led to those disasters and the
long struggle against their consequences up to the end of 1870 and
our condition then:—the subsequent quietude which attended us until
the end of the year 1874, and the gradual changes and their influencing
circumstances up to the present time. The increase of taxation of
indebtedness—the fluctuations of our population, production and trade as
affecting our revenue, our expenditure, and our debt will necessarily re-
quire examination: and the returns from our railways and the influence
they have exerted upon settlement and the probability of the proposed
extensions increasing either will also have to be considered. We must
read the past aright to judge of the consequences of the present as
affecting the future. I know that we are often told that our business
lies only with these last, “that it is of no use crying after spilt milk ” ;
but surely this is an assertion which befits only those to whom retrospec-
tion is abhorrent. We are told in effect to consult our invention and reject
our experience. Such a method “is diametrically opposed to every rule
“of reason and every principle of good sense established amongst
mankind. For that sense and that reason I have always understood
“ absolutely to prescribe whenever we are involved in difficulties from the
“ measures we have pursued that we should take a strict review of those
“measures in order to correct our errors if they should be corrigible>
“or at least to avoid a dull uniformity in mischief and the unpitied
“calamity of being repeatedly caught in the same snare.” I am much
mistaken if we do not find that the first portion of the enquiry does
furnish us with some very serious corrections of the confused notions
which appear to prevail of a supposed parallel between the state of
this colony and the causes of it in 1866 and its position now; and
with no less serious contradictions of the theory that loan and expend-
iture can without effective collateral aid or outside mollifying influences
do other than aggravate our difficulties and ultimately intensify our
depression.
The distinctive features of the panic of 1866, whether as regards
its causes or its duration, are marked in their dissimilarity from those
of the depression of 1879. At the end of 1865 there was little of


any tiling to create alarm in the general aspect of our affairs. The
public finances wore an appearance of almost unclouded prosperity,
and were, with the exception, as yet unknown, of the loan account, in
fact in a most gratifying condition. The year’s revenue exhibited a
receipt of £472,461, being an increase of £103,036, or rather more than
thirty per cent on that of 1864, and a surplus of £23,229 over the
expenditure. The floating deficit was only £47,415. The authorized
debt of £1,850,000 averaged only £2l 2s. per head of the mean
population: the interest, £110,778, only 255. 3d. The tariff was simple
and the taxation light: although a slight increase had been made in
the duties on wine, ales, and spirits, and a small duty authorized on
the export of gold the individual payment was only £2 Bs. 4d. The
resources of taxation had not been exhausted. How satisfactory all
this was the reader can judge for himself —how prosperous the parlia-
ment, the press, and the people deemed the public finance to be may
be collected from the fact that the Colonial Treasurer in estimating
his revenue for 1866 at £704,000 and his total expenditure at £687,886
met with scarcely the shadow of opposition and a mere formality
of criticism. The total export for the year showed a decrease of
£93,590 on that of 1864, being in all £1,153,464. This was due to a
falling off in wool the yearly quantity for 1865 being 12,251,841 lbs.
as against 14,006,189 lbs. in 1864,* but this again was partially com-
pensated by an increase of twenty per cent in the numbers of sheep
which now reached 6,810,000, while cattle 887,856, remained nearly
stationary, and horses —51,091, increased ten per cent. The registered
mortgages on live stock—after deducting releases, reached by the end
of 1865 —£4,647,645 12s. 5d., not an extravagant sum considering the
security. The Bank note circulation —on the 31st Dec., 1864, £1 17s. 2d.
per head—was on the like date of 1865, £2 Is. sd. and the Bank advances,
in which no doubt some of the amount of the mortgages on stock were
included —advanced from £2l 4s. 6d. per head in 1864 to about £23 in
1865. The population —the land order system being in full vigor—in-
creased from 74,036 on the 31st December, 1864 to 87,775 at the end of
1865 —only 13,739. There was moreover one satisfactory indication of
progress —new articles of export were developing; those of native produce
exclusive of pastoral growth, having increased to thirteen per cent of
the whole: less assuring was an increase in insolvencies of from
£146,911 in 1864 to £221,888 in 1865, one partially attributable to
the failure of many new comers who had too hastily rushed into trade.
Viewing the whole there was nothing which indicated any material
check to the progress which the colony had continuously made since
its inauguration in December, 1859.
* This was accounted for by difficulties of carriage hindering rapidity of transit to the seaboard.


The primary cause of the 1866 panic was the—l use a mild term-
secret management of the railway expenditure. Up to the meeting of
parliament that year few persons had suspected the extent to which
the estimates of cost had been and were likely to be exceeded, Scarcely
anv one outside of government circles and not many within them were
aware that the loan account was overdrawn nearly £4so,ooo—that the
Government bankers had taken the alarm and were hanging back—
that the contractors were clamoring for payments due to them on cer-
tificates deposited with their bankers and for certificates unjustly with-
an(l that the Railway works and the Government credit were on
the eve of suspension. When parliament met and it was found that
a new loan for £1,170,050 would be required the alarm spread, and
the Government bankers flatly refused any advances on that. The
Premier had turned in his extremity to Sydney and there made an
arrangement with the Agra and Masterman’s Agency for advances that
might, pending the floating of another loan, enable the Ministry to
tide over its difficulties: but he had barely time to congratulate himself
upon his skill when the news of the panic in London and of the stoppage
of the Agra and Masterman’s Bank reached Australia. The Government
banker had not been dulcified by the Ministerial procedure and as well
as the other banks was exasperated at an attempt by the Ministry to
float inconvertible notes which in effect would have been to force a
aoan at the expense of their circulation. And at this time the old
Queensland Bank—always weak in paid up capital and hampered by
a timid and far from wealthy proprietary—found what it had in great
part locked up in fixed securities, and stopped payment. To add to
the confusion a cheque given by the Government Savings Bank on the
Government banker was refused : the railway works were in great part
suspended and a general panic set in.
But I repeat it the immediate cause of most of this difficulty was
in full operation before anything was known of the London monetary
troubles and when the news came it fell upon a colony ill prepared to
meet it, inasmuch as its public finance was already thoroughly disor-
ganized. There being no telegraphic communication with Europe in
those days the exact nature and extent of the mischief, actual and to
be apprehended, was from month to month for some time matter for
speculation and the colony suffered from the suspense accordingly. It
was some time before we could thoroughly convince ourselves that the
agricultural and manufacturing interests were but slightly affected—
that the panic was a monetary one caused by the collapse of bubble
speculations and the exposure of fraudulent respectabilities—that more
had been frightened at the scarecrows presented to them when great
firms whose names had been household words for many a long year


■were compelled one by one to denude themselves of their false splendours
—and that distrust rather than depression was the efficient cause of
the pressure. How little that panic affected the real vitality of the old
country we may gather from the fact that in the following year the
national debt —funded and unfunded, was reduced by a little more than
four millions.
Even in this colony the troubles of 1866 were felt more in the
towns—especially those which had been most plagued by scheming
land speculations stimulated by suggestive and competing building
societies —than in the country. The fictitious values of mortgaged town
properties began to shrink but the production and trade of the colony
steadily maintained their ground. The total export in 1866 was
£1,366,491, an increase of £213,027, or nearly twenty per cent upon that of
1865, and of this increase £175,922 was in the produce and manufactures of
the colony. Live"stock multiplied. The export of wool was 2,065,398 lbs.
greater in quantity, and £103,350 more in value than in 1865: the
area of land under cultivation was 24,433 acres as against 14,414 in 1865.
The increase in insolvencies in 1866 over 1865 was less than of 1865
over 1864. The year’s revenue showed a small increase, wholly attrib-
utable to the new duties levied in the last two months of the year,
but there was a heavy deficit of £200,650, the receipt being £490,269
and the expenditure £690,922, still the customs return exhibited
an increase* not far out of proportion to the actual addition to the
population (8096) allowing for two months’ collection of the new duties
imposed. There was a great falling off in the land revenue, for times
of depression are not times of investment for investment sake. And
there were then no deferred payments to keep up for a period a con-
tinuously increasing receipt, I may admit that the mortgages on live
stock had increased to £5,438,263 9s. lid., that the note circulation of the
banks appears as drawn in to £126,957, and their advances to £1,906,579
(partially I suppose from the cessation of returns from the Bank
of Queensland in the last quarter) but still we see that the consumption
of dutiable commodities was sustained and the export trade had in-
creased and agriculture was extending and stock multiplying. Shall we
find any parallel to these fach in 1878-9 ?
It would be foreign to my purpose to enter into a detail of the
political measures which the troubles of 1866 suggested—but of those
taken to bring the revenue to an equality with the expenditure some
notice is necessary. To meet the loan overdraft pending the sale of
the debentures an issue of Treasury Bills to the extent of £300,000
was authorized: in the next place a system was initiated of payment
* £27,814 : allow for new duties, £16,187, leaves £16,187, which would be up to the average due
to the increase in the adult population of the colony.

of Treasury obligations by Government notes, exchangeable however for
gold, from which great relief was predicted by its authors, but which,
as all acquainted with the subject anticipated, entailed more expense
than advantage. The last was to increase the taxation. Stamp duties
—an Excise on distillation —an ad-valorem tax of per cent on most
imports, and special duties on dried fruits, rice, and salt were imposed. I
have said that in 1865 the resources of taxation were not exhausted;
in 1866 we made a rapid stride towards exhaustion, not the less
necessary that the authorized debt at the end of 1866 was increased—ex-
clusive of £438,500 of Treasury Bills—to £3,021,186, and the interest to
£181,271. As the interest on the Treasury Bills was at the rate of ten
per cent, that would add £43,850 to the annual burden.
Although the condition of the colony was thus sound the financial
shock given to it no doubt inflicted considerable damage, but much
more resulted to the progress of the colony—and we should mark the
fact—from the great falling oft“ in the addition to its adult population
which the total of the next four years witnessed. It is usual to take
the total of increase of all ages and calculate the tax-paying capacity
accordingly; but we are to remember that the annual natural increase
in a young colony is of babies who add little to the consumption of
dutiable commodities, and for years after their birth, nothing to its
industrial power. Bearing that in mind the importance of the figures
I submit becomes immediately apparent. I have placed them in a
tabular form for the sake of clearness and brevity.
Of the arrivals a considerable portion were under fourteen years
of age, but even taking them as adults it will be seen that out of an
addition of 18,030 to the population of the colony in five years, not
more than about 5,000 can be considered as added to the working
strength. 1869 was unfortunate in its loss of 535 from those who had
already come.

The table I next give of the revenue and of some of its sources
will show a striking accordance with that of the population taken in
connection with its profitable employment.
In order that the value of the two tables and their bearing upon
the subject should be thoroughly appreciated it is necessary to present
the reader with another of the Exports in total and of various kinds.

The first fact that will I suppose strike the reader is that during these
four years the revenue made its most remarkable increase in that one in
which the largest male population came to the colony direct to remu-
nerative labor and then produced the greatest quantity of gold : the
second is that the customs receipts decreased to a considerable extent
in the following year when the yield fell off and the working male
population began to leave and the gold fields residents were scattered
over a wider area. And the importance of these facts will be more
strongly impressed upon him when he is told that in 1870 the revenue would
have been below that of 1869 but for the aid afforded by further taxes and
the addition of 2£ per cent to the ad-valorem duty which came into
force on the Ist December of that year. He will see that the quantity
of labor employed on production so long as it is profitably employed
rules the contribution to the revenue more than the amount and value
of the product, and that when financial pressure bears strongly upon
a state the ultimate resource is the number and earnings of the population-
If he takes the ordinary course of dividing the receipt from taxation
for 1870 by the mean population for that year he will further see
that of the main imposts—Customs, Excise, Stamps, and Gold duties
producing together £337,936, the individual contribution, dividing the
total by 112,680, was about £3 per head. As the portion of that
receipt derivable from duties imposed after 1864 amounted to £131,640,
* This includes Pastoral Rents—in 1870, £108,637.


that, similarly divided, gives about £1 55., which would leave the
payment on the original tariff at £1 15s. per head or Bs. 9d. less than
it produced in 1860: and the reader will see that increased imposts
have something more than a tendency to lessen the productiveness
of existing taxation.
The general trade of the colony during these four years partook
of the fluctuations shown in the population, although the continuous
depression apparent in the value of pastoral produce had a tendency
to a retrograde condition. So far as insolvencies can be taken as
indications I observe that in 1867 the amount of liabilities (£411,092)
was greater than in either of the throe succeeding years ; in 1868 they
were not much more than half that sum: in 1869, when the effect of the
gold discoveries on trade had had time to be felt they fell to £140,256 ;
in 1870, when the falling off in the preceding and then present
year was telling they increased to £342,409. There was I remember
some distrust, some apprehension, and some impatience at the apparently
stagnant condition of affairs in 1870, which found vent in demands
for public works and loans to provide for them—demands firmly resisted
by the Ministry of the day. The banks were cautious in their action:
their advances —£1,306,739, in the last quarter of 1870 —were £601,840
less than in the lust quarter of 1866. Their note circulation—£l46,29l
—only £2,000 more. The area of land under cultivation increased
in 1867-8 and 9, by a tolerably equal rate of about 8,000 acres
per annum, but that rate fell off in 1870, in which year it had reached
52,310 acres : the quantity cultivated exhibited then, as it does
now, a woeful insignificance in comparison with that alienated from
the public estate, a proportion which would no doubt yield some sug-
gestive facts touching our land system were its causes adequately
investigated. There were promising indications of a class of agricultural
production too little attempted or encouraged here —exportable commodi-
ties. The quantity of land under sugar-cane, which in 1865 was under 94
acres, in 1870 had reached 6341, and the manufacture first tabulated
in 1868 as 619 tons, in 1870 was 2854 tons; —479 acres were under
cotton in 1865, 14,674 in 1870. The live stock returns gave signs of that
decrease in sheep whioh we have since seen, the numbers being in 1870,
of horses, 83,358, of cattle, 1,076,630, of sheep, 8,163,818, these last
numbering in 1869, 8,646,243. The mortgages on this description
of security went on increasing, the official statement exhibiting a total
up to the 31st December, 1870 of £7,203,421 3s. lOd. after deducting
releases. The authorised funded debt crept up by the same date to
£3,786,186, and the interest to £227,161, the individual charge being
£32 15s. The railway expenditure had exercised no small effect
on the public indebtedness—what had been its result in other directions?


Giving due priority to the cash expenditure I find the first record
in the register for 1865, by the end of which year it amounted to
£2,276,380; but during all this time there had been interest paid
out of the current revenue year by year which, reckoning it as simple
interest only in order to avoid any exaggeration, at six per cent
amounted to £560,980. From this is to be deducted the receipts which,
less the working expenses, amounted to £23,153, leaving a balance of
£2,814,207, against the railway account. The permanent effect of the
lines up to the end of 1870 on the towns in their vicinity I gather
as far as I can from the amount of rates paid as stated in the statistics
of municipalities—some of which are almost unintelligible. For the
two years, 1866 and 1870 (the line to Toowoomba being returned as
opened in 1867, to Dalby in 1868, and to Warwick, as 46 miles out
of 58, in 1870.) They stand thus for the following towns.
1866. 1870.
Dalby £533 ... £431
Drayton 327 210
Ipswich (?) 2202 903
Toowoomba 1210 1123
Warwick 592 756
As little does it appear that the lines, up to 1870, exercised any
exceptional influence upon the progress of agricultural settlement. I take
the returns from the following districts —distinguishing those not within
the reach of any railway by italics—as they stood in 1867 and 1870.
1867. 1870.
Dalby 67 acres 273 acres
Drayton & Toowoomba 4618 ~ 5228 ~
Ipswich 6368 ~ 16719 ~
Maryborough 1282 ~ 3216 ~
Logan 3094 ~ 4534 ~
Woogaroo 2294 ~ 3178 ~
Warwick 5052 ~ 6440 ~
The increase in the Maryborough, Logan, and Woogaroo districts,
proportionately greater than in either Toowoomba or Warwick, owed
nothing to railway facilities. Ipswich figures for an enormous advance,
but of this 6445 acres were due to the growth of cotton (which in
its turn led to a demand for other produce), then in its zenith and
mostly carried on in localities for which the railways afforded the
slightest possible, if any, accommodation. They neither helped it forward
nor could arrest its subsequent lamentable decline and extinction.
So far I have collected the facts bearing upon the causes of the
distress of 1866—the resources which the colony had at the time to
bear up against its consequences the gradual improvement on the
condition in which it left us—-the share which the railway expenditure


had in its production and the influence which up to the end of 1870
the railways exerted upon what is called in the cant of the day “ the
promotion of settlement.” We have now another and a different period
to deal with, and we shall find the circumstances connected with it
well worthy of our attention.
From 1870 to 1875 was a period of great and increasing prosperity.
We had but one loan ; the revenue for four years presented a surplus;
and in 1871 -72 a*d 73 there was a prudent and cautious economy
in the general expenditure. In the year 1874 we commenced once
more the race of riotous extravagance, and although the income was
large the surplus in reality disappeared. Generally, the colony was
not pestered with railway extension : the discreditable Ipswich and
Brisbane line—discreditable alike in its origin and in all its surroundings,
but, as likely to yield a good return for any reasonable expenditure,
the moat prudent that could have been entered upon —alone broke the
otherwise agreeable rest from “enterprising.undertakings” But in 1875,
the year in which the great European cloud fringed the horizon, we
launched with more than boldness upon railway extension. Every
succeeding year saw an addition to our debt, and in four years we
borrowed within a few thousands of five millions, forced as far as it
could be done sales of land to get half a million more, and by a
sinister and duplex process doubled our public liability and impoverished
all who could bear impoverishment. We took counsel with our imagi-
nation and discarded our experience, and we are gazing in perplexity
and fear at the consequences. I propose then to divide the time from
1870 to the present into the two distinct periods to which events point,
and to take from 1870 to 1875 as the first.
The increase in the population in those four years was very
remarkable. Mineral discoveries were precipitated upon each other,
and our ports were crowded with men who hoped in their turn to
discover, and with men who desired to fatten on others’ enterprise and
successes. Here and in New South Wales prospectuses loaded the press
and promoters jostled each other at the corners of the streets. It is
unnecessary for me to allude further to the mania of that time than
to say that I remember calculating from a Sydney share list and recording
in the Courier of that time that all the subscribed capitals of all the
banks in Australia would have been insufficient to meet the requirements
of the companies enumerated as formed or in course of formation. Still,
as we shall see, there were vast fields for energetic industry, and they
were not all kites and crows who came to spy out the fatness of the
land.
I give firstly the totals of the population on the 31st of December in
each year and the increase on the preceding one, from 1870 to 1874,

I compare these increases with the total values of exports and of the
special values of those of some particular industries for the same period.
Total values. Pastoral. Agricultural. Mining.
At the date of taking the census the numbers of persons engaged
in the different leading producing interests were pretty evenly distributed;
11,028 males were employed in pastoral pursuits, 11,666 in agriculture,
7,584 in mining. But it must not be forgotten that the value of the
pastoral product fluctuates to such an extent that the monetary amount
of export is no guide to the number employed in its production, while
increase in quantity after a given extent is reached may be obtained
without any great or permanent addition to the laboring staff. The
agricultural yield goes for our home consumption. An export of gold
on the average is proportionate to the number of miners ; and the
rapid increase in the immigration in 1873 and 4 was in great part
due to the inducement which the nows of our discoveries exerted upon
that class of the community in other colonies. These facts adequately
appreciated will go far to explain what might otherwise seem unin-
telligible in the table of revenue immediately following.
In this table I give first the totals —then the Customs—then the
amount due to the increase on the original tariff—the Excise—the Stamp
duty—the yield from Mining industry, including the monies paid on
mineral selections which have nothing to do with Land sales in the
ordinary sense of the term—and the Land sales—as distinguished from
Pastoral occupation rents—and lastly, the amount due to them.

On a comparison of these tables it will be seen how much the
revenue was affected by the increase of population consequent upon
the mineral discoveries. But for the loss sustained from the reduction
of the ad-valorem duties, first to 7| and next to 5 per cent for the
two last quarters of the year 1874, the customs revenue for that year
on a very moderate computation would have been 70 per cent above
that of 1871 : the proceeds of th q ad-valorem in 1873 were nearly double
those of 1871.
The state of the public finance at the end of 1874 —which is a
favorable point for a halt as having been chosen for an adjustment
of the whole account, Loan as well as Revenue—stood thus. On the 31st
December, 1874, notwithstanding a heavy surplus of £364,606 6s. 9d-
accruing in the four years since 1870, there still remained a debit
balance on the whole period since the erection of the district of Moreton
Bay into the colony of Queensland of £140,207 6s. Bd. But there
had been transfers from the Loan fund in 1864 and 1872 to the extent
of £420,673 10s. sd. which left a credit balance on the united account
of £280,466 6s. 9d. The Legislature, finding the money available—out
of loan in reality—by a nice felicity of phrase declared it to be "surplus
revenue ”; and, devoting £240,000 under that head to various works
which otherwise might have been provided for by loan, left the balance
to be carried to the current account. The actual condition of the public
finance was however satisfactory; the revenue had been large, but
the expenditure had been kept within bounds, and the result was
as I have described it. The public debt was, on the 31st December,
1874, £4,888,228, being nearly £3O per head on the population—the
interest, £279,139, or say £1 15s. per head. The receipts from taxation
—including Mineral payments which now came more properly under
the head of rents, were £552,058, or about £3 11s. per head on the
mean population: on the additions to the original tariff they were
£ 1 2s. 6d. The indebtedness was lighter in proportion to the numbers
of the people than in 1870. The proceeds of taxation were 11s. per head
more. These satisfactory appearances were enhanced by the progress of
the Government Savings Bank. In 1866 it had 1803 depositors having
£89,451 to their credit: in 1874 11,426 depositors had £576,535, and
out of the whole number 762 only figured as professional men, clerks,
and government employes, the rest were of the industrial and producing
classes, including 258 South Sea Islanders, who may I suppose in this
case be placed in one of them.
Banking transactions, which were kept within the limits of a very
cautious reserve until the end of 1872, expanded with considerable
vigor in the two following years. Since the failure of the Bank of
Queensland, the five old branch establishments had gone on amiably


enough together, but in the third quarter of 1872 the Queensland
National Bank was started as a local institution, and its influence,
combined with that of the mineral discoveries—directly in the new
business created and indirectly in the competition stimulated, soon
became apparent, as the following table will show.
1871. 1872. 1873. 1874.
Bank advances £1,203,938 ... £1,489,515 .. 2,153,698 ... £2,680,091
Note issue 170,601 ... 229,509 ... 287,854 ... 351,322
There were of course insolvencies and mortgages, but in 1872
they sank into insignificance. The total value that year of surrendered
estates was declared at only £75,912: more by £25,029 was repaid
than was borrowed on real estate, and the mortgages on live stock were
but £32,136 in excess of the releases. The average rate of interest on
mortgages fell from 12| per cent in 1871 to 8f in 1874, nevertheless
the incumbrances on live stock were stated at a total, on the 31st
December of that year, of £7,970,096. Agriculture exhibited no exuberant
vitality. The area of land cultivated in 1874 was only 70,381 acres—
an increase of 18,021 acres in four years. C0tt0n—14,674 acres in
1870 sunk to 4,140 in 1874. Sugar increased to 14,600 acres. We
had discovered that we did not know how to make cotton pay, and
that sugar cultivation was profitable under certain conditions. But the
total of cultivated land in proportion to the quantity alienated was
still very low—not quite five per cent of the whole. There was a
great increase in cattle, which at the close of 1874 numbered 1,610,105 ;
sheep, on the contrary, were only 7,180,792, which indicated either a
gradual conversion of sheep stations into cattle ones, or some hindrances
to the natural increase of sheep—and probably both influences were
in action. Horses numbered 107,007.
The railways thoroughly vindicated themselves. By the end of 1874
the amount expended on them had reached £2,855,375, and the interest
beyond not receipt was in all £1,052,386, calculating at simple interest
of six and four per cent on the different loans. Their effect in impelling
settlement I leave, to avoid unnecessary repetition, to the conclusion.
The accumulation of burden which they have entailed will be clear
enough when that is arrived at.
There can be no doubt that at the end of 1874 the financial
condition of the colony was sound and prosperous. The Treasurer’s
tables give a surplus of £39,267 of revenue over expenditure, but
there is a considerable discrepancy between that statement and the
account current in the Auditor General’s report for that year. There
were various items of expenditure remaining unpaid on the 31st December
amounting to £70,161, as well as some liabilities standing over from
previous years which, taken fairly into account, left a debit balance


instead. The method of statement adopted in these tables, as well as
in the ordinary periodical returns, is far from satisfactory. It appears
to give merely the cash received and spent in each year, which may
be accurate as to the revenue but exceedingly defective as to the other
side of the ledger; just as the cash payments of an individual afford
very little indication of the extent of his liabilities. When I come to
the final statement the reader will be able to estimate the misapprehension
which the method adopted must inevitably result in.
But in trade —in production—in all that could be supposed to
denote the prosperity of the community there was abundant reason to
be satisfied. The export had swelled with unparallelled rapidity from
two and a half millions in 1870 to more than four millions in 1874.
The public liability, as I have said, was moderate —private indebtedness
seemed to have been kept within bounds. All that was required was
that caution and prudence should guide the conduct of public affairs—
that the outlay should be guaged by a calculation of moderate average
of receipt rather than on an assumed continuance of an exceptional
exuberance —and that allowance should be made for those contingencies
which always hover round a new colony with a small population. A wise
financier will avail himself of prosperous times and an overflowing
treasury to lighten as far as possible the pressure of taxation : he will
see in the reserve which that will give him his surest refuge should
adverse times come: he will not hail every rise in the meter as indicating
a fresh source of profusion lest when depression and decrease stare him
in the face he may find himself with fixed burdens and lessened means
to meet them. The pump that is made to draw up to the maximum
supply will sometime or other pull heavily on an uncertain rise in an
exhausting well. And most of all is this true when as in Queensland
more depends upon the external requirements of a manufacturing country
like Great Britain —upon the demand of a single market —than upon
internal capacity of production which may in its very luxuriance become
mischievous if not exasperating. Unhappily such considerations were
lost sight of. We let the flood carry us as it pleased, and when the
waters fell found ourselves in danger of stranding upon unanticipated
shallows.
The period from R 74 up to the present time is not easily dealt with.
The official statistics for 1878 are not yet published, although why those
of “Interchange,” “ Accumulation,” and “Finance” should be delayed
so long it is not easy to ascertain. The information they contain is most
important to the Legislature. The state of our trade —the monetary
condition of the colony are essential considerations in the settlement of
the legislation in which financial matters are concerned, and in this colony
there are few of our laws entirely dissociated from them. The great


bulk of the returns are of or from compilations prepared in the several
departments, and could, without any extraordinary effort, be laid before
parliament in June, for I notice that two of the most important reports
—those from the Railway and Lands offices, are dated April and May,
respectively. The expense of a little additional clerical assistance is
not worth considering in comparison with the value of the aid which
would be rendered to the legislature and to all engaged in the discus-
sion of public concerns by the prompt publication of these returns.
The population of the colony, which at the close of 1874 was calcu-
lated at 163,517, is stated to have increased by the 3ist December, 1875,
to 181,208, the addition by Immigration having been 115,69, and from
natural causes, 2,602 : the net influx from the neighbouring colonies was
1,791, a tolerably certain indication of continued mining attraction. As
the additions from every source in 1876 were 15,572, the population at the
end of that year should have numbered 196,780 ; but when the census
taken on the Ist of May in this year was properly tabulated, and
the remaining months’ increases added, the net population was only
187,100. This discrepancy was accounted for by the Registrar - General
“by a balance against us during the five years since the census was
taken, in 1871, of immigration and emigration over the border.” * On
the 3lst December, 1877, the population was estimated at 203,034, of
whom 72,000 might be counted as adult males. Out of these I calculate
that about 25,000 wore Chinese and South Sea Islanders. In 1878 the
excess of arrivals over departures by sea was only 4249, of whom 1639
were males. The Chinese in that year diminished by 2187 ; and the
departures —7565 —to the sister colonies were 386 in excess of the
arrivals: the excess of births over deaths was 3171 —the total
population on the 3lst December being stated at 210,510. Considering
the known continuous migration overland for many months past, I
doubt if there are more adult males in the colony now than there
were at the close of 1877. Indeed, if I were to give adequate weight
to the great and continuous falling off in the revenue in 1878, and
in the present year, I should estimate them at less.
When we come to the exports during this period there are some
circumstances connected with a portion of them calculated to excite
surprise in the mind of a stranger to the colony, and not readily
susceptible of a satisfactory explanation amongst ourselves. Over great
part of the country a drought of unusual severity prevailed in the
years 1875-6-7 and there can be no doubt that the loss in stock was
* Subsequently, an attempt was made to attribute it to defective enumeration, in consequence
of what was termed the Hodgkinson rush on the Northern gold-fields, but the following figures
disprove the assumption. Their population in 1876 was 19,461 ; in 1877, 24,367 ;an increase mainly
attributable to the influx of 4,314 additional Chinese. There was neither increase nor diminution

very great—probably much greater than has ever been admitted—in
sheep especially. And even allowing for the substitution of cattle for
sheep on some stations, the enormous decrease is not to be easily
accounted for unless as arising from want of grass and water. The
difficulty of arriving at any sure conclusion is increased by our having
two sets of returns, one collected by the police, the other taken from
the numbers furnished from those given for the local assessment to
the Inspector of Stock and Brands.* 1 I present them in parallel columns
and the reader will see that the discrepancy is too great to be easily
accounted for.

The increase or decrease in sheep in the three years, 1876-7-8,
according to the two authorities, stand respectively as follows.
The totals on the gross return of three years disagree but little,
but of each year would represent a considerable value. Again, as to
cattle, it will be seen that cattle and horses together, according to the
Inspector’s report for 1878, only number 2,140,700, while the Registrar
General states them at 2,580,641, the difference representing a value
of certainly not less than £1,319,823. I make no charge, I abhor
insinuation, but I draw the attention of the government to the fact.
It will be seen to be of serious importance when we proceed a little
further in this enquiry.
* “ Hitherto there has been a considerable discrepancy between the number of sheep on which
assessment has been paid and those published in the reports of the Registrar-General, the latter
being considerably in excess of those returned to this office. From this it might be inferred that
a considerable number of sheep annually escape assessment. lam not however inclined to adopt
that view, but rather to attribute the difference to the fact that round numbers are in many instances
returned to the Registrar-General when exact numbers are returned and paid for under the Sheep
Act.”—Report of the Chief Inspector of Stock for the year 1878.
f No returns by owners of less than 50 head.


But in connection with the exports of the colony during the years
named there is another circumstance which appears to me to be
inexplicable on any legitimate hypothesis. The quantity of wool ex-
ported in each of the four years, 1875-6-7 and 8, was as follows:—in
1875, 201,45,914 lbs—in 1876, 22,918,560—in 1877, 23,979,485—in 1878
21,668,122 ; so that when the number of sheep was admittedly decreased
by at least 1,600,000 approaching to twenty-five per cent on the
original quantity, the wool produced was 1,512,208 lbs more.
The wool of 1878 was little more in quantity than that of 1869.
As respects gold, an apparent discrepancy between the reports for 1877
and 1878 of the Under Secretary for Mines, and the Customs return of
export led me to make some enquiries, and the courtesy of the Collector
of Customs enables me to correct a rather serious error in the statistics
for the former year. Some of the officers at the northern ports fell
into the error of entering a quantity of gold, shipped coast-wise, as
an export, which led to a double valuation. The real export of gold
in 1877 was 3 53,266 oz., instead of 428,104. If we are to suppose the
return of the yield as given by the Under Secretary for Mines to be
correct there must have been 46,010 oz. which were retained in the
colony, or escaped the notice of the Customs authorities, in 1877 and 1878.
We have then—subject to such doubts as may arise from the
circumstances to which I have referred —the following table of export
for 1875-6-7, including stock sent overland.
Total Export. Pastoral. Agricultural. Mining. Miscellaneous. Total Native.
1875 ... £3,857,576 ...£1,803,369 ...£103,252.. .£1,851,385... £40,580 ... £3,798,586

I am unable to tabulate the exports for 1878 as the returns are
not yet published, but, generally, I believe the following statement
will be found to be correct. The total export, including stock sent
overland, was valued at £3,190,419, being a fall of £866,837 on the
preceding year. The quantity of wool was 21,668,122 lbs, valued at
£1,185,659, a diminution in quantity of more than two and a quarter
millions of lbs, and in value, of £314,023. The export of gold was
69,674 oz. less than in 1877 —of copper, 1,345 tons —of tin and tin ore
and slag, 486 tons. Copper, valued at £35,126, was hardly a fifth of
the yield of the year before.
I next come to the Revenue returns which correspond very closely
with the condition of the population as indicated by our export trade,
although an alteration in the termination of the official financial year
« xhere was a great export of Sugar—likely to be continuous: and that of Pearl-shell, and of Timber,
classed under Miscellaneous, increased greatly.

The falling off in the last year was £97,288, but the decline, which
was continuous throughout the year, commenced in reality in the last
quarter of 1877-8, in which the revenue was £30,716 less than in the
corresponding one of the preceding year. The receipt for the first
quarter of the current financial year —1879-80 is only £402,554 as
against £434,472 of the first quarter of 1878-9 —£470,063, of the first
quarter of 1877-8 ; and £6,000 less than even that of the first quarter
of 1876-7. We have had a continuous falling off of revenue for
eighteen months. I see nothing to promise any marked improvement,
under our present systems of land alienation and immigration, fox a
long time to come.
Let us refer to the public expenditure during this time and to
the care with which this was stated and adjusted. The Auditor
General’s reports for the following years give the following.
Revenue. Dr. bal. prev. yr. Expend, in period. Deficit at end.
For the year 1878-9 we have as yet only a preliminary report,
dated 23rd July, 1879, in which we are told that the Treasury state-
ment sent to the Audit Office, exhibited an overdraft on the Ist
July, of £177,625 : and then comes the explanation —charming in the
candour with which it implies how much must have been left to the
imagination in a long series of Treasury quarterly, half-yearly, and
yearly “ comparative statements ” —which to most of my readers will
have something more than the force of novelty—“ with a further liability
u on account of Parliamentary votes unexpended, and for service authori-
ti ze( j by the Executive in course of expenditure, amounting together
‘‘to £283,223 12s. Bd., less any portion of such votes as may be found
“unnecessary, and will consequently lapse”! The amount which
japsed in 1877-8 was, according to the Treasurer’s financial table,
* Additional duty of Id. per lb. imposed on rice.


£55,087 —in the year before, little less. Assume that in the past
financial year it may be about the same, and the consolidated revenue
fund may be estimated to have closed at its termination with a debtor
balance of £405,761.
That we may appreciate the importance of this fact, coupled with
the continuous falling off during the current financial year, it is neces-
sary to refer to the Treasurer’s estimates of revenue and expenditure.
I have before me a copy of those estimates as they were finally passed,
and they show a contemplated expenditure, including interest, of
£1,600,066, exclusive of any supplementary estimate that may hereafter
make its appearance. To meet this, a revenue is calculated upon of
£1,658,000, an increase of £198,000 on that of the preceding years. But
the first quarter of the year shows, instead of increase, a falling olf,
as I said, of £30,715, as compared with the first quarter of 1878-9, and
I have not yet been able to discern any indications of the extraordinary
increase which would in the eight months to come of the current
year yield a return of nearly £229,000 more than that of the last
nine months of 1878-9. I most ardently desire that my apprehensions
may be unfounded, but an equality of this year’s revenue with that
of the past one is almost beyond the hope of the most sanguine.
Assume that to be achieved, and we have a probable deficit on the Ist
July, 1880, of £544,004.*'
There may, however, be one deduction to be made from this. In
1875, an Act was passed, called the Western Railway Act, and, in
1877, another, called the Railway Reserves Act, under which, reserves of
land were authorized to be made for special sale, the proceeds of
the sales to be paid into a fund called the Railway Reserve fund, and
applied to the cost of constructing the several railways named. In
the four years ending the 30th June, 1879, £442,797 had been raised
under those Acts, and a balance of £829,821 was to the credit
of the fund on the 30th of last September. This, under the authority
of a short act passed last session, was carried to the general revenue
fund, and the proceeds of further sales were directed to be dealt with
in like manner : deducting the last named sum from the debit balance
above stated it would be lowered to £414,183.

It has been urged that the receipt under the Acts I have
noted were but ordinary revenue, and that had they been carried
to the general fund the deficiency might have been comparatively
insignificant. I attach no weight to this argument. What is exceptional
cannot be an object of general reliance, and these sales were in some
measure coercive. The lands placed in the market were of value in
most part from the presumed necessity for great squatting firms or
capitalists to purchase them in order to preserve the integrity of their
runs. Out of the £442,797 obtained from the whole, £357,616 was
extracted almost wholly from crown lessees in the Western Railway
Reserve, who bought the land at auction at the upset price, and
without competition, in spite of every effort by advertisement and
eulogy to induce it. In 1878-9, the operations were insignificant:
indeed, any attempt at repeating them on a large scale was out of
the question. What had been done had not affected the means of
the community at large for either investment or taxation: it had
simply squeezed from a few rich companies or firms what could be
extracted, and left them with a purchase whose real value to them
was that it protected themselves and rendered it unprofitable to buy
the unsold portions. Actual monetary gain, they must wait for the
future to produce. Practically, the land revenue this year has not come
quite up to the last, which is perhaps the best proof I can adduce
of the real nature of the whole procedure.
These facts then might be thought to involve serious considerations
in dealing with future loans, more especially if the works upon which
those loans are proposed to be spent offer no possibility of returning
interest upon their cost. Waiving the details of the works themselves
and, for the present, the sources whence traffic, for which they are
assumed to provide, are to come, it might be well to look at what
existing loans entail upon us.
In 1875-6-7 and 8, we borrowed altogether £4,942,818, and incurred
an additional annual charge for interest, of £197,712. The Loan stood,
prior to the authorization of the new one last session, at £10,196,086 ;
the interest at £466,857. At a fair estimate of our population on the
30th December, 1878, that represented a charge on account of debt
amounting to £SO each for every soul in the colony, and of £2 6s.
for interest. The charge for interest was almost twice as much per
head as it was in 1865.—Can we say, after the facts previously stated,
that we are in an equal position to meet a further increase of taxation
to that in which we were then ? Can we imagine that without increased
taxation we can meet further liabilities ? And increased taxation
can do little in a community whose tariff remaining the same for the
last four years, with the exception of the increase in the duty on rice,


is exhibiting a decreasing yield, attributable either to diminishing
numbers or lessened consumption. If the former, why attempt to get
out of ninety what a hundred could with difficulty pay :if the latter,
it is a sign that the existing pressure is such as to be met only
by abstention from dutiable articles.
No doubt the pressure has been more felt than expressed: so much the
greater the necessity for taking warning by the indications that have
been allowed to escape. The Banks have endeavoured to contract their
issues, but despite the relief afforded them by the operation of large
loan companies their advances steadily increased till the end of 1878.
If we take into account the falling off in production of leading staples,
and in trade generally, there is nothing particularly reassuring in this.
Large advances may imply either great credit or great necessity : which
was the efficient cause in this case, the reader may, having the facts
before him, judge for himself. I give the following table of the note
issues, advances or debts due to, and deposits bearing interest with
the banks in the last quarter of the years named.
1875. 1876. 1877. 1878.
Notes in circulation £349,591 ... £345,436 ... £371,758 ... £359,943
Advances 3,451,646 ... 3,400,646 ... 4,017,554 ... 4,604,874
Deposits bearing interest—
two-thirds of the whole ... 2,705,900 ... 3,091,257 ... 3,912,257 ... 3,810,033
As respects the Government Savings Bank, the deposits, which in
1874 were £576,505, rose to £702,312 in 1877, but in 1878, the with-
drawals exceeded the payments by £29,995, the £702,740 left to the
credit of depositors being accounted for by carrying accruing interest to
credit.
The Insolvencies, during the four years, present an apparent
inconsistency with the general tenor of the returns. For 1875, the
amount was £100,785; for 1876, £429,885; for 1877, £190,553; for 1878,
£292,338. The interpolation of the large sum in 1876, however, had
little to do with the progress of the colony, and was due to the
stoppage of some large houses which had long been in a tottering
condition, the burden of loss falling principally upon European and
outside creditors. Except to make this explanation, this subject requires
no special notice.
I now come to one of far greater importance —that of mortgages
and securities on real property and on live stock. I found no statistics
in the Register up to the year 1871, as to the former, and at first sight
concluded that probably there might have been some delicacy about
publishing the particulars, or that the amount of discharge balancing
that of incumbrance the matter did not require notice. As, however,
these sheets were passing through the press, and being desirous to make
this exposition as complete as possible, I searched through the whole


of the Statistical records available, and then found that the omission
of the item would have been a great mistake. The total excess of
incumbrance on over release of real property, from 1871 to 1877 inclusive,
is—l spare the reader the details of each year*, except to notice that 1872
presented the novel spectacle of repayment exceeding loan £1,061,685.
The returns for 1878 are extant, but not yet available. With respect
to the mortgages on live stock up to the end of 1877, the total, after
deducting releases, appears to be £9,205,499. If those of 1878 and of
the present year were added —taking the average of the preceding three
years—the amount would probably stand at not less than ten millions.
Let it be observed that I have made no reference to “ preferable
liens on wool,” or “liens on growing crops,” or “bills of sale.” In
all these cases there is more or less rapidity of release —sometimes by
payment, but in far the great majority of cases, by sale, within or out-
side the colony, in which the lender, having realized all he can get,
does not take the trouble to record his satisfaction or his disgust. How
far a similar sort of procedure may apply to the mortgages, I cannot
say. It is said that the amount really chargeable upon live stock is
not one half of that which the official figures give, and from such en-
quiries as I could make I should think it possible ; not the less that
from a fair average valuation of the stock in the colony and I am
taking cattle at a much higher rate than that temporarily riding—the
stated incumbrance, if accurate, would amount to fully four-fifths of
the value of the whole. But, as I find the figures, so I must cite them,
employing what I believe to be a very necessary caution. Their accu-
racy or inaccuracy is a matter requiring legislative attention. Why
should the credit of the colony, not less than that of the class immediately
interested, suffer from a perpetuation of erroneous record ? If the record
be really correct —if the law has been observed —the carelessness with
which these important matters have been neglected is to me inexplicable.
These loans come in great part from outside (Queensland. The interest
upon them is at the colonial rate. Add its probable amount on the
officially stated debt to the interest payable on the public obligation,
and the two would be equal to the value of a half-year’s total export
from the colony instead of bearing a fair proportion to the profit derivable
from it.
Before reverting to the railway question it may be as well to show
the increase in agricultural settlement since 1874, confining myself
to leading points. The total area under cultivation was 117,489
acres, at the close of 1878, as compared with 70,331 at the end of 1874.
Cotton had fallen to 37 acres. Sugar had advanced from 14,600 acres
in 1874 to 16,584 acres in 1878. Wheat was still fighting its way by
5,743 acres in 1878 as against 3,592 in 1874. Maize—the crop of


contented non-progressiveness, is given as 53,799 acres in 1878, nearly
double that of 1874. But tlie area of cultivation had fallen in proportion
to that of alienation, being now only two per cent on the average.
With a system of sale, chiefly by deferred payments, it is surely unwise
to neglect the fact that the extent of holding increases, while the
proportionate use of it necessary to yield the return whence it is to
be paid for, decreases. We shall find the evil correct itself, but the
land revenue will not benefit by the correction.
And lastly, as a matter of fact, I come to the actual condition of
the Railway expenditure. In an appendix to the last yearly report of
Mr.'A. 0. Herbert, the Railway Commissioner, it is stated that the
whole expenditure, to the 31st December, 1878, had been £4,456,160,
and that at that date there’ were unexpended balances, amounting
to £1,340,498, applicable to railways already authorized and in course
of construction. In addition to these sums, I find on the Loan Votes
£438,100 for the completion of those lines. The total amounts to
£0,234,758, to which I add simple interest at the borrowing cost, year
by year as it accrued, after deducting the net yearly earnings, which
to the close of 1878, would mount up to £1,474,025, exclusive
of any for 1879. We thus arrive at a cost to the colony, of our
railway hobby, of £7,708,783. There were also voted last session for
branch lines, £416,000, and for extensions westward, £1,170,000, the two
sums amounting to £1,586,000. The grand total to which we are
committed, is £9,284,783.—“ You may pay—yes! you may pay—a great
deal too dear for your whistle.”
What have these railways done ? what may they be expected to
do ? How are we to pay the interest, not merely on their cost, but on
the whole huge loan gathering upon us? Take for instance the
Southern and Western. On the townships in its vicinity existing when
it was started it has exerted an unappreciable effect. The municipal
rate levied in Dalby in 1877 was £625 as against £431 in 18/0 in
Ipswich, £1,382 as against £9o3—in Toowoomba, £1,781 against £1,123
in Warwick, £l,OOO against £756. This advance in seven years is not
more than ought to have resulted from increasing population. In
agricultural settlement we see a similar state of things, as I could
easily show, only that my limit is nearly exhausted. *—But why
multiply instances. A railway cannot pay unless there is traffic to yield
profit. It cannot have traffic unless there is produce to be carried,
and consumers to take it. There cannot be consumers without population
or an outside marhet. With us there is no outside market for
agricultural produce, and the miserable prices obtained show that
* Compare Toowoomba, Rockhampton, Mackay, for instance as to progress.


production Las overtaken consumption. Railways create settlement!
WLat do fourteen years tell us on that head ? You have the facts
before you.
But they develope traffic! Certainly—where traffic can be created.
Unless this facility exists they can no more do this than they can dis-
cover a gold reef. The one pertinent answer to such an assertion is
that in this year the receipts are, up to this date, £14,739 less on the
Southern and Western fine than they were for a similar period in 1878 ;
and on the Central one, £5,049.f Nor has the decrease been so sudden
as some would have it. In his report for 1878, the Commissioner for
Railways admits and tries to explain away the fact that the Revenue
returns were unsatisfactory, considering the greater length of line open.
This year still greater lengths are open, and we have still less gross
receipt.
But if we extend to the west and construct our branches we shall
increase our receipt.—Perhaps so, but not our profits. What say facts ?
The length of line from Toowoomba, westward, and the traffic receipts
on it, in 1876 and 1878, were as follows.
1876. Length of line, 52 miles ; receipt, £25,462=per mile, £490.
1878. „ „ „ „ £24,595 \ _
„ Extension, 78 „ „ £19,815 j ” ‘
On the central line, the results —partially, as stated by the traffic
manager, from temporary causes —were better, the receipt on 140 miles
being £57,567, in 1878, as against £27,483, on 88 miles, in 1876. But
as if to show us that the traffic manager was right, we have this year
25 miles more open and £5,049 of receipt less.
We have been told, on authority which I have no desire to
challenge, that the increased numbers of sheep will supply the wool
which, with the traffic derivable from the stations and from agricultural
settlement, will yield a remunerative return.—Do the great decrease in
the number of sheep during the last ten years, or the population
required for purely pastoral pursuits, or their requirements in the way
of commercial articles, or agricultural production, justify such a
supposition ? lam not called upon to answer assumption by
anticipatory argument, but I ask one question —How long will it take
to permanently settle three millions more sheep in the Warrego and
that part of the Mitchell whose trade might fall to the Western line ?
t * * Could ail the essentials of the passenger traffic (to Toowoomba) be met by a fewer number of
trains than at present? Certainly. I iind that the average number of passengers, that is, speaking
roughly from figures that I have taken out of the last month’s return, is twenty-six passengers per
train to Toowoomba.
2304. Is that the average of the whole distance between Brisbane and Toowoomba ? Yes.
2808. What is the average number of passengers between here and Toowoomba? During the month
of June, 1879, the passenger traffic between Brisbane and Toowoomba was * * * daily average,
17 24. —Evidence of A. 0. Herbert, before Committee on Ipswich Workshops,
As three trains run—it would give under three each train ! !


Admit that you got twelve millions pounds of wool from them, and
the receipt for carriage on the whole length of 500 miles would only
add £11,250 to the gross returns. What would be left for profit on
that, after paying 60 per cent of working expenses ? Would the sheep
be there when the line was ready to receive the fleece?*
But the branches ? It is matter of population in all of them. On
the Warwick line, running through a fine agricultural district, with a
population of at least 9,000 dependent upon it, and Stanthorpe behind,
the receipt was only £20,504 in 1878. Not to be invidious, take a
district with one fourth of that population to supply a line of 25
miles —and there are few so populous for such a length—and at £2,500
a mile the cost would be £75,000, the interest on which at 5 per cent
would be £3,750. But the traffic on the most favorable estimate would
not bo more than £5,000, which, taking the working expenses at
one half of the present rate, even on the lines running only one
train each way, would swallow up the whole. Ido not believe that
on any branch line the result would be otherwise —a belief founded
on calculations which I have not space to give. Ido not say that
some kind of improved means of transit is not wanted in many districts.
I do not contend that all extensions are premature, but what I do
contend is, that it is folly to borrow largely for costly lines—and oven
£2,500 a mile would be to my mind unnecessarily so —in every
agricultural district we have until we have really tried whether we
cannot find some plan better adapted to our circumstances and require-
ments. Take for instance such a district as the Laidley one, with its
average traffic of 28 tons per week, and distribute that over the six
days, a rough and ready tram costing £BOO to £l,OOO a mile, fit for
horse working or a light traction engine, might be laid down and
placed in the hands of a divisional board to manage and keep in
order, under given restrictions and at certain rates. In our mining
districts, so impoverished by the heavy costs of crushing, and where
the competition of machinery is so essential, and in all cases in which
lines of heavier construction are needed, it would bo easy to provide
for them if the lands in their vicinity wore treated as capital to be
employed and not as property to be sold. V, hat I deprecate —what
every well-wisher to the colony must deprecate, is the everlasting
rushing into loan without first thinking whether the time is not coming
—nay, now is—when even land sales grow less and less—when pastoral
rents fall off —when interest has to be met by taxation, and when taxation
drives people from our territory. The interest on the National debt
of Great Britain is about 16s. 9d. per head of her population of
our debt, will soon be £2 19s.
* The failure to pay rent on 60 runs, notified in the Gazette of the 26th Oct., does not look like
universal faith.


Times are mending. lam glad to hear it. But it is in the nature
of declensions of long generation to involve lengthened periods of
recovery. Our depression is not of yesterday and its causes are wide-spread
and of long duration. The market on which we must depend for the
sale of one of our great staples is the manufacturing industry of Great
Britain. When the value of her export of manufactures and produce
fell forty - one millions in four years when that of woollens sank
from £32,383,273, in 1872, to £17,343,203, in 1877, and of metals and
machinery in scarcely inferior degree *—there was ground for appre-
hension as to the prices of our own wool and metals an apprehension
which seems at no time to have had any effect on the conduct of our
public affairs. I have not the statistics of the United Kingdom for
1878, but there has been nothing up to within a few weeks ago to
mend matters. To those who look for a return of the “leaps and
bounds” of prosperity, on which Mr. Gladstone was wont to dilate, I
recommend attention to that growing assimilation of industrial power
which has so seriously lessened the market for British produce on
the continent of Europe, and threatens it with competition in every
part of the world. That “stationary state” which Malthus predicted,
and Mill saw no reason to “ deprecate ” may be nearer, as to the mother
country, as to wealth and profits, than superficial observers imagine.
And it does not follow that if we could produce one hundred million
pounds of wool instead of twenty - two millions, that profitable sale
would be found for the larger quantity. For any rapid recovery from
such a depression, the deficient harvests, more than even the political
condition of all Europe, interpose too great difficulties, which a spas-
modic and exaggerated liveliness in the metal market more than
counterbalanced by the large export of specie to pay for breadstuff's—
will not do much to remove. It was not the downfall of a few capi-
talist schemers, but the increasing troubles of all Europe, supplemented
by the severity of the seasons, which brought about the depression in
the old country —a depression re-acting on us by the lessened values
of our o\m commodities, and aggravated in its severity by our own
losses from drought and from the waste oi capital and labor in dis-
proportionate and unremunerative production. But I see no reason for
despondency. In a email people like this that could, in its 19 years
of existence, export forty-two millions’ worth ox produce, raise fifteen
and a quarter millions of revenue, and lay secure foundations for future
enterprise, with its real resources hardly opened, despondency would be
criminal. But forget not that a prudent abstinence—a present reflection
may save us much future evil. What the colony is pledged to provide
for in the completion of undertakings already commenced is necessarily
to be provided. Why begin more ? Is it because your failing revenue
your depreciated product, which the slight rise in wool will not balance

—renders you less capable of meeting this year’s public expenditure than
you were the last, that you should deliberately increase the burden by
uncertain or speculative or decorative outlay ? Recollecting your four
years’ struggle from 1866 to 1870, should you.not yield rest to exhaustion
—first search whence we can educe, and how maintain the desired revival.
The colony is one of th best in the world for emigrants. Grood! You
have spent since separation, in land orders and in cash, two millions and
a half, which should have brought you out from 175,000 to 200,000 souls,
very little less than our entire present numbers: you had 28,000 at
separation : what has become of all the voluntary arrivals —of the
increase of more than 40,000 from natural causes ? Is it that with us
taxation by the head is actually , ten shillings more, not reckoning local
rating, than in the United Kingdom with it ? Additional interest on debt
must involve additional taxation, and I defy any one to prove the contrary
—additional taxation for years to come unless the great want is supplied;
the essential power which, weak, is a source of poverty and weariness,
and strong, nerves the community to lift its head erect Population.
That is your want. You have chosen to make it so. You have laid
burdens upon your shoulders, whose grievousness has rendered you
unequal to facing uncertainty of profit in your industries.—Your task
is now to gain, to make, 'to keep, a fresh impetus to your numerical
and industrial power. Unless you can do this yonr numbers will de-
crease as they are decreasing, and your revenue diminish as it is
diminishing. People will not stay in any colony with a cnreatened
tax-gatherer at every door, when they can go to another, wfiere the
taxation is barely one-half; and those who are left will find themselves
heavier weighted from the withdrawal. Let the capitalist take heed
to it. The storm that scatters the periwinkles strands the great whales.
The population we want will not be brought here by our present
system of land laws or of immigration, and we have yet to learn
much as to certainty in economy of transit and equitable adjustment
in payment of its cost: but these are subjects for future and anxious
thought. If I have succeeded in bringing before my fellow colonists
matter, either of fact or argument, that will induce them to reflect, I
am sufficiently rewarded. Not unobservant of men and things, in giving
the result of twenty years’ observation and experience, I have been
aided little by advice, had no co-operation save that of the friend who
first suggested this essay and helped me in its publication ; and
in the expression of opinion—possibly erroneous —am independent and
alone. That is of small consequence if what lias been written should
stir up abler and worthier exponents of our requirements to enter the
field I for the present abandon.
