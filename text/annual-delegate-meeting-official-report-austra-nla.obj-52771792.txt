OFFICIAL REPORT
'T'HE twenty-fifth annual delegate
meeting of the Australian Work-
ers’ Union (Queensland Branch) was
opened at the Worker Building,
Elizabeth Street, Brisbane, on Mon-
day, January 17, 1938.
The chair was occupied by Branch
President J. C. Lament, and there
were present;
Branch Secretary, Mr. C. G. Fallon.
Southern District: D. Brophy, J.
Brown, O. Lewis, J. Lough, J. W.
Perrett.
Central District: G. Crooks, J.
Dufficy, W. D. Ivey.
Northern District: G. Burns, T.
Dougherty, W. B. Hay, P. A. Nicol-
son, H. S. O’Gorman.
Far Northern District: H. Boland,
P. Bushnell, J. Murphy.
Western District: E. Davis, V. C.
Thompson.
South-Western District: T. P. Hol-
loway, H. O’Shea.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) in declaring the Twenty-
fifth Delegate Meeting open welcomed
delegates and expressed the hope
that their stay would be a pleasant
one and that the results of their de-
liberations would be of benefit to the
organisation and the movement gene-
rally. It was hardly necessary to
remind delegates that they had a big
agenda to consider. He invited their
hearty co-operation in having the
business disposed of expeditiously
and efficiently.
On the motion of Mr. Fallon, sec-
onded by Mr. Boland, the arrange-
ments in regard to the Minutes and
the Official Report, were confirmed.
Admission of Visitors
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) suggested that only those
persons whose bona fides could be
vouched for by a delegate be admit-
ted to their deliberations. A very
loyal and active supporter of the or-
ganisation had asked for permission
to be present to hear the address by
the Premier and probably later on it
may be necessary to grant special
permission in such cases.
Mr. Bushnell pointed out that mem-
bers of the Labor Party may wish to
be present during part of their de-
liberations and he would like to know
whether special permission would be
required in each case.
The Branch Secretary then moved:
“That all persons whose bona fides
were vouched for by a delegate be
permitted to attend the Delegate
Meeting.”
Mr. Lough seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Admission of the Press
Mr. Hay moved: “That the press
be admitted on the same conditions as
those approved last year, i.e., that
reports for publication be submitted
for scrutiny by either the Branch
President or the editor of ‘The
Worker,’ Mr. J. S. Hanlon.”
Mr. Bushnell seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Death of Mr. Jack Fallon: Motion of
Condolence
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament), in moving, “That Delegate
Meeting express its profound symna-
thy in the death of Mr. Jack Fallon
and that this expression be forwarded
to his sorrowing relatives,” said that
the death of young Jack Fallon in
tragic circumstances came as a shock
to them all. It would be difficult to
meet a nicer lad anywhere, and it
was painful to think that such an
open-faced, breezy lad should have
been cut off in such tragic circum


stances when he was on the very
threshold of a career in which he had
shown marked ability.
Mr. Crooks, who seconded the
motion, said that as he had known
young Jack for such a long time he
had no hesitation in endorsing the
kindly sentiments expressed by the
Branch President. It was a terrible
thing to thing that such an able lad
should be cut off so early in life
when he gave promise of a very suc-
cessful career, but he hoped that be-
fore these proceedings terminated
the Commonwealth Government would
have taken steps to prevent similar
occurrences in the future.
The motion was carried by dele-
gates standing in silence.
Death of Mr. Jack Noble: Motion of
Condolence
In moving that a similar motion
should be passed by the Delegate
Meeting, concerning the death of Mr.
Jack Noble, one-time organiser and
delegate from the Central District,
Mr. Crooks said that he was sure
that he was voicing the sentiments
of delegates, members of the union,
and all who had associated with Mr.
Noble, when he expressed the opinion
that Mr. Noble had always carried
out his work efficiently as an official
of the organisation and had always
done all that was humanly possible
to help the working-class movement.
He regretted that it was his painful
duty to move the motion, but he asked
that the expression of sympathy
should be conveyed to the relatives of
the deceased,
Mr. Lough said that he had known
Jack Noble for many years, and
could wholeheartedly endorse the
sentiments expressed by Mr. Crooks.
He was a great battler, and his ideal
always was the interests and better-
ment of the members of the organisa-
tion and the Movement generally.
The motion was carried by dele-
gates standing in silence.
Mr. CHESTER REYNOLDS
Appreciation of Services
Mr. Bushnell moved: “That Dele-
gate Meeting place on record its ap-
preciation of the services of Mr.
Chester Reynolds as official reporter
at previous conferences.” Pressure
of business prevented Mr. Reynolds’
appearance as official reporter at the,
present meeting, but he could con-
fidently say that during his eleven
years as official reporter Mr. Rey-
nolds had always given them excel-
lent reports. There had been no com-
plaints, and this was testimony of his
endeavour to give all delegates fair
treatment in this respect. He be-
lieved that credit should be given
where credit was due, and therefore
the meeting should have no hesitation
in acknowledging the valuable ser-
vices of Mr. Reynolds.
Mr. Boland, who seconded the mo-
tion wholeheartedy, supported the
idea that the meeting should place
on record its appreciation of the ser-
vices rendered by Mr. Reynolds.
Motion carried.

Mr. Speedy informed the delegates
that, as he had been appointed to an
executive position in the Brisbane
City Council and thus it was not pos-
sible in the future to do justice to
the position of Branch Returning
Officer, he would not be a candidate
on this occasion. He pointed out that
the position was becoming increas-
ingly difficult, and called for the ut-
most care, tact, and ability. It was
with extreme regret that he had de-
cided not to seek nomination again,
hut he was proud to know that he
had been associated with the ballots
of the organisation as District Scruti-
neer, Branch Scrutineer, and District
Returning Officer for a period of 23
years, during 12 of which he was
Branch Returning Officer. He
thought it was a record for one per-
son to occupy a position associated
with the ballots of the organisation
over such a long period of years. He
thanked the delegates for the con-
fidence that had been reposed in him,
and expressed the opinion that it had
never been misplaced. (Applause).
Mr. Bushnell reminded Mr. Speedy
that he had declared only two dele-
gates elected for the Central District,
but as they had a membership of 6825
they were entitled to three delegates.
Mr. Speedy explained that he was
under a misapprehension that the dis-
trict was entitled to only two dele-
gates, but in view of Mr. Bushnell’s
remarks he now declared Mr. W. D.
Ivey elected as the third delegate for
the Central District.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon), moving—“That the report
of the Returning Officer be received
and adopted”—said that the ballot
just concluded was a particularly


difficult one, and that they were for-
tunate in having as returning officer
a man with the tact and experience
of Mr. Speedy. He was capable of
making prompt and fair decisions
and was able to thwart the mischiev-
ous intentions of individuals who were
not actuated by any desire to help
the organisation. The ballot just
conclude d had been carried out in face
of many obstacles, but he was glad
to say that Mr. Speedy was able to
carry out his duties w r ith fairness
and promptitude. It w T as a pleasure
to record the complete satisfaction
that he had given during the 12 years
in which he had conducted the bal-
lots. His association with them con-
stituted a record, and it was some-
thing of which anyone might feel
justlv proud. He regretted that Mr.
Speedv was forced to relinquish his
position as branch returning officer,
and expressed the fear that he had
maintained a standard that it would
be difficult for his successor to emu-
late. However, he hoped that his
successor in office, whoever he might
be, would approach closely the stand-
ard set by Mr. Speedy. He con-
gratulated him on his splendid record,
but he was sorry that the union was
to lose his services in this respect.
Mr. Bushnell also expressed his
keen regrets at losing the services of
Mr. Speedy as branch returning offi-
cer. He was satisfied that while he
occupied that position he instilled
confidence into their members in eon-
nection with the ballots. He had
carried out his duties with marked
ability, and his loss would be a swere
blow "to the organisation.
Mr. Crooks moved: “That Delegate
Meeting places on record its appre-
ciation of the very valuable services
rendered to the organisation by Mr.
Speedy as Branch Returning Officer.”
He had carried out his duties with
satisfaction to all fair-minded people
and their appreciation should be re-
corded.
Mr. Lewis, who seconded the mo-
tion, said that Mr. Speedy’s decisions,
although firm, had always been fair.
He had many difficulties to overcome,
because there were a few disgruntled
people whose sole object seemed to
be to make the job as difficult _ as
possible. As the work of conducting
ballots in the future bound to
bceome increasing difficult, he re-
gretted exceeding!y that they were!
to lose the valuable services of such 1
a capable man. There was no doubt!
that a few malcontents had decided!
to endeavour to capture the main
positions in the organisation.
Mr. Fallon: They did not have |
much success last time. i
Mr. Lewis: But they will continue j
their despicable practice. {

Workers’ Union provided: The
Branch Returning Officer shall be re-
sponsible for the conduct of the ballot
of his branch. His decision in all
cases shall be subject to appeal to

directly affected by such decision.
Branch President’s Address
Delegates,
I desire to give you a sincere wel-
come to this the 25th Delegate Meet-
ing and trust that your stay here will
be a pleasant one.
The year just closed has been an
excellent one, both from the point of
view' of the organisation and the
workers generally.
While attempts are being made by
Labor’s opponents to establish anti-
Labor organisations with a view to
taking power from Labor in the
State, we find that even the Tory
press is compelled to admit that the
Christmas just past was probably the
best on record from every point of
view. There was more money in cir-
culation than at any other period,
which, of course, meant that there
was a better distribution of the money
available—this could only be made
possible by a Labor Government. It
is true, too, that more people were
in employment than ever before, and
that the purchasing power of each fl
earned was greater than at any
period prior to the Depression. This
is all due to those people who are
responsible for the existence of a
Labor Government in the State Par-
liament.


Depends Upon the Workers
Themselves
A continuance of this favour-
able improvement in working-
class conditions depends on the
workers themselves. It is safe
to say that many thousands are
quite oblivious as to what is tak-
ing place in the anti-Labor
camp; and the dangers that are
confronting them from that
quarter.
This danger, as has always been
the case, is the apathy of the work-
ers themselves. They are altogether
too prone to leave their thinking to
someone else. This is the reason why
it is necessary to wage election cam-
paigns which are often not sufficient
to arouse the workers from their
slumbers, and as a result our Tory
opponents get control of the Govern-
ment of the State.
Before we meet again we will have
had another State election, and I
think it should go out from this
meeting that from now on and until
after election day, every effort should
be made by members, and particularly
the officials of this organisation, to
see that the workers are enrolled and
sufficient interest aroused to ensure
the return of the Labor Government.
It is necessary to again remind work-
ers of the raw deal that was handed
out by Mr. Maher and his colle gues
during the three years they were in
power. Mr. Maher may claim that
the Moore Government was respon-
sible for all that, but the workers
know that Moore was only one and
is still one of the old bunch. Maher
was one and is still one of the same
bunch. The leadership has been
changed from Moore to Maher with
the hope of fooling electors into be-
lieving that the same old party is
something different—it is not, and
never can be.
The few that are left have not
changed; they have not even re-
pented. Of course, they will
promise the workers anything
with the hope of gaining office
once again.
A Reminder of Past Experiences
The workers should not require any
more than a reminder of what oc-
curred to them when they previously
returned this incompetent and bit-
terly hostile set of award-destroying
wage-reducing Tories. Thousands
were sacked out of the railways and
other Government jobs. People were
starving in thousands all over the
State. Soup kitchens had to be
opened. Three and four families were
crowded into one small cottage
for shelter. Sewerage workers’
wages were reduced by two pounds
and more a week below aval cl wages.
Business establishments were work-
ing on less than half staff—working
conditions were destroyed and work
rationed. These are a few of the
things the workers need to be re-
minded of. We cannot expect any
more in the future than we received
in the past from politicians who are
class-conscious Tories, and who have
no consideration for the workers
other than to see that they sell their
labour at the lowest possible price.
If the workers are aroused to
the danger of having to go
through another ordeal under a
hostile Government their answer
at the ballot box will be just as
emphatic as it was three years
ago and the Labor Government
will be returned with an over-
whelming majority.
The Old Firm of Many Aliases
It has to be remembered that we
are faced with opposition from many
quarters. Amongst those who have
formed the most recent shady and
shoddy anti-Government concern will
be found several individuals who have
endeavoured to reach fame through
the use of Labor’s machinery. Hav-
ing failed in their efforts at the polls
they expected the Government to
comply with their demands; being
unsuccessful in this, they are about
to appeal to Labor’s opponents to
bump them into Parliament. From
this element there is absolutely no
danger, as this kind of political hum-
bug has no chance of getting support
from any quarter. The old firm of
many names and aliases should be
easy enough to conquer as the
workers should know by this that all
parties opposed to the Labor Party
are also opposed to high wages and
decent working conditions. The
workers also know that the chief rea-
son for parties opposing Labor is be-
cause of Labor’s policy of higher
wages and better working conditions.


Funds for election campaigns are
generously subscribed to anti-Labor
organisations mainly because of this
—by institutions and persons who
contend that Labor’s policy in this re-
spect reduces the profits of the em-
ployers.
The last thing that these
people are prepared to concede
is that the workers who make the
profits are entitled to them.
Renew the Mandate for Labor
1 feel confident that the electors of
Queensland are behind Labor and
will renew the mandate for Labor to
continue the good work. There is a
great deal more to be done and when
one reflects on the progress made
throughout the State in the last five
years one must conclude that Labor
is the constructive party. The enor-
mous amount of building construc-
tion work in every city and town; the
many hundreds of miles of roads that
have been constructed; the land set-
tlement development schemes that
have been given effect to make work
and more work, which means the dis-
tribution of money and a prosperous
community.
Under a system of democracy
and wise Government this policy
can be continued and extended—
under a bad Government it may
be discontinued, which would
mean unemployment and another
depression. We must leave no
stone unturned to secure again
the return of Labor to power.
Since we last met here many
changes have taken place in world
affairs. The war drums have been
rumbling and mankind has again
witnessed the awful horrors which
war brings in its train.
The Menace of Fascism
Rapid progress has been made in
a direction that is pleasing to Fas-
cism and its supporters, many of
whom we have in our midst, who are
endeavouring to hide their identity
as such behind the cloak of unionism
or militancy. A close up on their
private activities and a tab on their
associations easily discloses that we
have in important positions, persons
who are most undesirable and dan-
gerous to the working class move-
ment.
It is evident to the most casual
observer that wherever Fascism has
taken control that every semblance of
working class organisation has been
completely wiped out and any sus-
picion of an attempt to revive in-
terest has been met with the sudden
death of those responsible.
Fascism does not permit in-
dividuals to have an opinion op-
posed to those of the Fascists.
Those having ideas opposed to
Fascist leadership are disposed
of. To openly express opposi-
tion means sudden death.
This is the form of dictatorship
that is fast taking control in every
country.
When the World Seemed
Cleaner
When one pauses to take a
retrospective view, it revives-memo-
ries of the days before the Great
War, when the world seemed a
cleaner and a better place, when pos-
sibilities of mankind looked brighter.
Those were the days when we
preached the brotherhood of man,
when we were in constant touch
with such as Liebnecht of Germany,
Eugene Debs of America, Mary
Marcy, Jim Connolly, Daniel De Leon
and others who have passed away, in
many cases as the result of assassins’
work, but in no instance have we ex-
perienced such wholesale slaughter of
the intellectuals of the working class
as in countries where the most recent
form of Fascism has been estab-
lished. Not only have working-class
leaders been shot down, but any who
expressed resentment have been shot
down with them. I might be par-
doned for dealing with this subject
again this year as I dealt with it
fairly extensively at a previous > dele-
gate meeting, but, judging by ‘what
has transpired since then, the absence
of propaganda against this kind of
thing is evident, and many members
of the working-class movement have
re-acted to their true environment
and adopted Hitler tactics.
That, however, won’t save
them when the time comes; they
will have to face up to the class
position. Pandering to the mas-
ter class and undermining their
fellow-workers won’t save them
from the bullets of the Fascists.


It is this kind of craven creature
that makes Fascism possible and
keeps the working-class movement
back. The “yes” men, the nice men
who worm their way into our Move-
ment, the fair weather men who pan-
der to all those who are opposed to
the working-class movement, and
have not sufficient guts to stand up
for right, in many cases because they
are not sure whether the cause they
are paid to espouse is right. They
have not sufficient knowledge of the
movement of the worker to be con-
vinced that it is right or to stand
by it when it is assailed, but rely on
pandering to the many different pre-
judices of the mob. This kind of in-
dividual is a grave menace to the
workers who require men who are
thoroughly conversant with the Move-
ment, and who are prepared to stand
up and fight against a’nything which
is’ not in the best interests of the
workers as a class. Moral cowardice
is disastrous and allows a condition
of drift to set in.
Self-government Must Be
Preserved
It is quite evident that Fascism
has been the outcome of Communis-
tic activities, first in Italy, later in
Germany, and is now aiming to crush
the democratic form of government in
every country. It is greatly aided, in
its progress by the fear that is en-
gendered among the peoples, for
Communism.
Because of several years of advo-
cacy of +he dictatorship of the pro-
letariat and many other impossible,
meaningless and parrot-like phrases,
it has been made possible for the
propertied classes, with the militia at
their call, to scare the people into a
state of mind where they are pre-
pared to submit to the destruction of
democracy and the substittuion of a
dictatorship, which deprives them of
every vestige of citizenship rights
and every particle of freedom. The
majority of the nations are now in
the hands of a Dictatorship, and
should France fall for it, desperate
efforts will no doubt be made to im-
pose it on the few countries that are
now governed by the popular vote.
Should any attempt be made in Aus-
tralia to enforce this form of govern-
ment, the full weight of this organ-
isation should be immediately called
into action to scotch it.
I think this is a matter that
may well be discussed at our
Australian Convention, which
opens in Sydney in a few days’
time. I think we are the only
Union that is organised on suf-
ficiently broad lines to meet such
an affront, and we should fight
to the last ditch against being
brought under any such audaci-
ous and impudent form of
tyranny.
It seems unthinkable that such a
thing could happen in Australia, but
if we simply sit and wait and see it
may be on us before we know it.
Every Australian worthy of the name
should be prepared to fight to the
end in protection of his right to self-
government government of the
people—by the people—for the
people. (Applause).
Mr. Brophy moved: “That the
Branch President’s address be re-
ceived, adopted, and incorporated in
the Official Report.”
Mr. Perrett seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Hours of Sitting
Mr. Bushnell moved: “That the
hours of sitting be from 9.30 a.m. to
12.30 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.”
Mr. Burns seconded the motion.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that while he realised
that it was essential in view of the
volume of business to be considered
that delegates should be present at
9.30 a.m. he and the Branch Presi-
dent had a considerable amount of of-
fice work to dispose of before the
meeting commenced. It was his in-
tention to be in attendance at his
office at 8.30 a.m., but even then he
would find it difficult to dispose of all
the necessary office business before
10 a.m. He, therefore, moved as an
amendment: “That the hours of sit-
ting be from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.
and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.”
He had no objection to delegates
fitting in the other half hour.
Mr. O’Shea seconded the amend-
ment, which was carried.


Branch Secretary’s Report
Fellow Members,
In presenting my balance sheet tor the
year ending May 31, 1937, and financial
statement for seven months ending
December 31, 1937, I have to report
that, compared with the same seven
months' period last year, there has been
an improvement in the membership. The
1937-38 membership for the seven
months was 41,301. This shows an in-
crease of 2785 compared with the same
period of the previous year.
Pastoral Awards
The shearing rate was increased from
36/- to 38/- per hundred as from April
12, 1937, and wages rates prescribed by
other pastoral awards were also increased.
Our application to further increase the
shearing rate to 45/- per hundred and to
increase the rates in other pastoral awards
failed; but as a result of our application
for variation of the Shearing, Station
Hands', and other Pastoral Awards the
Industrial Court increased the male adult
rate prescribed by the Station Hands'
Award for employees on cattle stations
by 2/- per week, and proportionate in-
creases in other rates in this award. This
increase brought the wages of employees
on cattle stations in line with those apply-
ing to employees on sheep stations.
Our claim for the adult rate for youths
of 19 years and upwards was refused.
Provision has been made in the Station
Hands' Award for an allowance for food
whilst travelling, as well as fares and
cost of conveyance limited to 2/- per
meal and three meals per day.
Graziers Move For Reduction
Reductions of wages in the Pastoral
Industry Awards are requested in an ap-
plication which the United Graziers' As-
sociation of Queensland filed in the
Industrial Court recently.
In respect of the Shearing Industry,
Wool Classers, Sheep Shearing, Experts
and Grinders' Awards, the employers are
asking a reduction of approximately 16
per cent.
A reduction of 5/- a week in the
rates for adults in the Station Hands'
Award, and a proportionate reduction for
jackeroos and juniors is claimed. The em-
ployers also ask that the extra rate fixed
for the Northern Division be deleted.
The answer of the union to the
graziers' applications are due on January
22, 1938.
Pay for Shed Hands
Whether the rates payable to shed
hands for odd days worked under the
Shearing Industry Award, State, should be
calculated on the basis of a six-day week
or a Si-day week was argued before the
Full Bench of the Industrial Court.
The case came before the Court as an
appeal by R. J. Wedgwood, shearing con-
tractor, of Longreach, against the decision
of the Industrial Magistrate at Longreach
on a complaint lodged against him by the
union.
The Magistrate's decision was that pay-
ment for odd days should be calculated on
the basis of a Si-day week of 44 hours.
The Court affirmed the Magistrate's
decision and dismissed the appeal.
Northern Australian Breweries, Ltd.,
Cairns: Forty-hour Week
A forty-hour week without reduction
of weekly pay was awarded the employees
of the Northern Australian Breweries,
Ltd., Cairns, as from November 1, 1937.
Rockhampton Breweries, Ltd.: Forty-hour
Week
Application for a forty-hour week
without reduction of weekly pay was also
made for the employees of the Rock-
hampton Breweries, Ltd. Our application
was successful, and employees of this
brewery are enjoying a forty-hour week
as from January 3, 1938.
Butter, Cheese, and Condensed Milk
Award, Southern Division
This award was reviewed, and although
the union was not successful in gaining
all the improvements asked for, all em-
ployees will now receive a fortnight's holi-
day per annum. Previously employees en-
gaged in cheese factories had to work on
all statutory holidays and received twelve
days in lieu of these holidays; but under
the present award they will receive pay-
ment if they work on Good Friday, Labor
Day, Christmas Day, and April 25 at
double time. Butter factory employees,
under the old award, received nine holi-
days, but in the-new award they receive
two weeks' holiday per annum.
A new rate of £4 3s. per week was in-
serted for pasteuriser, and other minor
improvements were made in the working
conditions.


Survey Labourers and Cooks' Award,
State, and Surveyors' Labourers and Cooks'
Award, State Government
Several improvements were? made in
the working conditions of these awards,
on- of the most important being that
where employees are obliged to live in
camp they shall be paid 4d. per day in
addition to the rates prescribed.
Survey Labourers in Forestry Camps
Representation was made to the Minis-
ter for Lands re survey labourers in
forestry camps doing work covered by the
Surveyors' Labourers and Cooks' Award,
State Government, who were being paid
under the Forestry Employees' Award. The
Minister approved as from 24/9/37 that
these employees be paid in accordance
with and work under the conditions of
the Surveyors' Labourers and Cooks'
Award, State Government.
Diamantina Hospital and Westwood
Sanatorium Employees' Award
Previously there was no award covering
the employees of the Westwood Sana-
torium, and as a result of cur application
for an award to cover these employees an
award was made to cover the Diamantina
Hospital (which was previously covered
by an award) and the Westwood Sana-
torium. The employees of the Westwood
Sanatorium received increases ranging
from 1 /- to 3/- per week. They were also
granted four weeks' holiday per annum
where previously they received three
weeks, and were granted sick leave as per
regulations of the Public Service Acts,
which provides one week per annum on
full pay, one week on half pay, and one
week without pay. Leave being allowed to
accumulate.
Local Authorities (Excluding Brisbane)
and Main Roads Award, State
This award was reviewed and improve-
ments made in the working conditions.
Sanitary employees were granted two
weeks' holiday on full pay for each twelve
months worked, and their working condi-
tions were somewhat improved.
Prevision was also made that when
gangers are in charge of men using
poisonous gas in destruction of prickly-
pear and are actually using same, they
shall be paid 3/8 per week in addition
to the rates prescribed.
Sugar Industry Award—State
A claim was filed by the union for im-
provement in the Sugar Industry Award,
State, whilst the .Sugar Employers' Asso-
ciations sought sweeping.wage reductions
in all sections of the industry. Part of their
objective was the cancellation of the
basic wage increase. Their claim rested
on (1 ) a change in the factors, includ-
ing travelling and seasonal allowances,
taken into account by the Court when
fixing wages, and (2) the depressed state
of the sugar industry as gauged by the
alleged debit balances of the growers,
who were clients of the Associated Banks.
The application by the employers for
reduced rates was rejected and the
claims of the parties for variations of
the working conditions were refused, ex-
cept that the Court expected the em-
ployers to carry out their agreement to
provide hot shower baths during the
crushing season.
Shop Assistants and Storemen and Packers
in Retail Stores Award, Central Division
Application was made for two weeks'
annual holidays for employees covered by
this award, and our application was
granted, which took effect as from
December 6, 1937.
Veneer and Ply Mil! Award—State
As a result of lack of proper provision
in the award to cover the hours of shift
workers in veneer and ply mills the em-
ployees in some mills only received li
hours' pay for the reason that the half
hour was taken out of their own hours
for crib. In other cases where the spread
of hours was 8| they had their crib in
their own time. The union approached the
Court to have this defect remedied, and
as from July 5, 1937, employees in
veneer and ply mills in Queensland bene-
fited by the Court's judgment providing
shift workers with thirty minutes' paid
crib time during each eight-hour shift,
such time to be paid for by the employer.
Sawmilling Award—State
Many improvements, including a week's
annual leave, was asked in connection
with the Sawmilling Award —State, but
our claim was not successful, as far as
holidays were concerned. We were suc-
cessful in having the award varied in
factories where wire-bound box-making
machines are used that juniors, unless
paid the adult rates, shall be only em-
ployed in doing certain work. The award
was also varied that when an employee is
required to do any work during a meal
time he shall be paid double rates for the
time so occupied. Provision was also made
for Western allowance.


Hotel, Club, Cafe, and Restaurant Award,
South-western District
In an application to the Court for
improved wages and conditions for em-
ployees covered by this award the union
was successful in securing certain im-
provements, including one which provides
that in certain circumstances employees
required to do any work on Sunday shall
be paid for not less than eight hours at
double time rates.
The union was also successful in
securing provision for two weeks' annual
leave on full pay, also proper regulation
as to meal times, and other improvements
in conditions of employment; but perhaps
the most important alteration secured is
the alteration of the boundary between
No. 1 and No. 2 Divisions from 147 de-
grees of east longitude to 150 degrees,
which secured for all hotel, club, cafe,
and restaurant employees employed in
towns between 147 and 150 degrees
(who were previously paid the rates for
No. 1 Division) the higher rates pre-
scribed for No. 2 Division. This means that
the employees who were previously paid
No. 1 rates received an increase in rates
ranging from 2/- to 9/6 per week.
Hotel, Cafe, and Restaurant Award,
Longreach and District
Substantial improvements in wages and
conditions of employees under this award
were secured. An important feature of the
variation of this award is that it now
takes in Boulia and all surrounding dis-
tricts not hitherto included.
In the case of hotel employees, wages
in most instances have been increased,
the increase ranging from 1/- per week
to 14/- per week.
For casuals (defined as employees not
employed for more than three consecu-
tive days in any one week) the rates for
males are now 15/9 per day with meals,
with a minimum of 7/10i- per half day
or part of half day, and for females
11/10 per day with meals, with a mini-
mum of 5/11 per half day or part of
half day.
In the case of cafe and restaurant em-
ployees, the new wages scale is fixed
without meals, increases being granted to
male cooks (from £4/10/3 to £4/19/10
per week), and all other unclassified
males (from £4/5/4 to £4/6/4 per
week).
In the case of dismissal of an em-
ployee or of an employee leaving the ser-
vice of an employer, after the prescribed
notice has been given, the employee shall
be paid all wages due within one hour of
ceasing work. If such wages are not paid
within the time prescribed all waiting time
in excess of one hour shall be paid for at
ordinary rates.
Water Supply and Sewerage Labourers'
Award—State (excluding Brisbane)
From September 10, 1937, this award
was varied by granting employees two
weeks' holdays on full pay. Special rates
for pump attendants and ploughmen and
scoopmen were inserted in the award, and
a few improvements in the working con-
ditions were secured.
Rates for Patrolmen
The matter of rates to be paid to pat-
rolmen employed by the Commissioner of
Main Roads came before the Industrial
Arbitration Court, when the Court made
an order which increased the rates pre-
viously paid by the Main Roads Commis-
sion for patrolmen using their own utili-
ties by 17/- per week, plus an additional
6/- per day when utilities are used to
haul a patrol grader or drag.
Prices of Sleepers and Hewn Timber
Following the variation of the Queens-
land basic wage. Branch President J. C.
Lament opened up negotiations with the
Forestry Department and the Railway De-
partment for increases in the prices which
should be paid for hewn timbers pur-
chased by the various Government depart-
ments, and after consultation he was suc-
cessful in securing an increase of 10/-
per hundred for 7ft. sleepers, and 7/6
per hundred for sft. sleepers on the pre-
vailing rates.
The amount of the basic wage increase
for 7ft. hog-backed sleepers was 8/2 per
hundred, but the amount by which it was
proposed to increase the prices for this
class of timber was 8/4 per hundred.
For the sft. sleepers the amount of the
basic wage increase was 5/10 per hun-
dred, but for these it was proposed to pay
6/- per hundred under the new schedule.
Other timbers, transoms, crossing timbers,
headstocks, and bracings, girders, and
corbels were all subject to proportionate
increase.
On account also of the many requests
that had been received for increased
prices because of the diminishing sup-
plies in close proximity to the railway line
and the longer haulage entailed, it was
considered reasonable to grant an increase
(including the basic wage increasd) of
10/- per 100 for 7ft. hewn sleepers, and
7/6 per 100 for sft. hewn sleepers.

Mt. Isa Mines
Application was made for a forty-hour
week and the payment of a bonus. The
Court refused our application for a 40-
hour week, but granted our application
for a bonus, which took effect as from
the 15th day of November, 1937. The
bonus clause reads:
As from the fifteenth day of
November, 1937, all employees covered
by this award shall be paid a bonus
according to the following scale:
The bonus for a four-hour shift shall
be one-half that above set out for an
eight-hour shift.
The above scale applies to employees
on the minimum rate for labourers or
over. Employees on less than the said
minimum rate shall receive bonuses at
one-half of above rate.
Hours of overtime will not carry ad-
ditional bonus unless the ordinary time
worked is insufficient to make a full
fortnight, when hours of overtime will
be taken into account to make up the
deficiency.
The bonus is not to be paid during
periods when, through shortage of
water or coal or other fuel, or other
unavoidable causes, or through strikes,
the production and treatment opera-
tions are completely suspended, nor
during periods when the company is
prevented by causes beyond its con-
trol from smelting or shipping its
products.
Employees absent on holidays will be
paid the bonus for such absentee
periods.
The Mt. Isa Mines Ltd. has since ap-
plied to the Court for a variation of the
bonus clause of the award providing for
the payment of an extra 6d. per day to
employees for every increase of £1 or part
of £1 per ton above £2O in the price of
lead in Australian currency. They also
asked that the payment of a lead bonus
should not become operative until the
London price of lead was over £26 ster-
ling. At the hearing the Court stated that
they would obtain the assistance of the
Auditor-General to review and, if neces-
sary, revise figures submitted to the
Court, and adjourned the application
sine die.
Mount Morgan Mines
On the application of the A.W.U., the
ordinary working hours of employees in
the oxidised ore plant at Mt. Morgan
were reduced from 44 to 40 hours per
week. All A.W.U. members employed by
the Mount Morgan Company now enjoy
the advantage of the 40-hour week.
Wrongful Dismissal of Waitresses
The case of the dismissal of three
waitresses at Townsville, who claimed the
benefits under the Hotel, Club, Cafe,
and Restaurant Award, Northern Divi-
sion, was of unusual interest for the
reason that it established an important
principle as to what constitutes dismissal
of an employee. Section 53 of the In-
dustrial Arbitration Act provides, amongst
other things, that no person shall be dis-
missed or refused employment or have his
employment-altered to his prejudice by
reason of the fact that he is an officer
of a union or is entitled to the benefits
of an industrial award or agreement.
In this case the employees were not
dismissed in the ordinary way. The whole
of the circumstances were brought under
my notice. I secured expert opinion as to
the best means of dealing with the em-
ployer, and was advised that the union


could not succeed under Section 53 of
the Act for the reason that the em-
ployees concerned had left their employ-
ment and had not been dismissed.
I was unable to agree with this opinion,
and expressed the view that dismissal
meant any action taken by an employer
with the deliberate intention of bringing
about a termination of employment, and
that although the employees referred to
in this case had left their employment
they had been forced to do so by the
employer, and were, therefore, entitled to
protection under Section 53 of the Act.
Papers were filed in the Court, and the
matter was remitted to the Industrial
Magistrate at Townsville, who ordered the
reinstatement, should they desire it, and
also ordered that the amounts of £9/18/-
in two cases and £lO/12/6 in the third
case be paid.
Victimisation Cases at Ambrose Lime
Quarry Works
Five charges of victimisation were made
against Henry Ambrose, managing
director of the Ambrose Limeworks Pty.,
Ltd., Ambrose Siding, by the union in
the Industrial Court at Gladstone. Am-
brose was fined a total of £lOO and was
ordered to pay compensation and costs
amounting to £340.
Ambrose appealed against the decision
of the Magistrate. On the fifteenth dey
of December, 1937, the Court made an
order directing that the employer pay the
following amounts:
West, £42 18s.; Fred. Lipsey,
£39 6s. 6d.; Jack Evans, £39 14s. Id.;
Rcy Sinclair Houston, £39 14s. Id.;
Thomas Armstrong, £42 1 Bs.
The union also prosecuted in eight
other cases against the said employer, al-
leging in each case that he had paid the
employees less than the rate prescribed
by the award. In each case the defendant
was convicted and fined £l.
Further cases of victimisation have
been taken against this employer, who
has been convicted and fined, against
which he has appealed.
Since this report was compiled these
matters have been adjusted.
Check Inspector of Mines
Following representation made to the
Minister of Mines by a deputation from
Delegate Meeting, check inspectors'
wages, as from May 1, 1937, were in-
creased to £6 nett per week.
Amendment of Wages Act
It was found that persons with very
small capital had been purchasing cane
farms in North Queensland on very low
deposits. Their commitments were such
as it was almost impossible for them to
observe the awards. Investigations showed
that a farmer was allowed only 10/- a ton
to pay the whole cost of harvesting and
carting his cane. Persons also took liens
over the crops, and when the cutters went
to get their wages they found the lienee
had taken all the proceeds. The amend-
ment of the Wages Act will allow
workers to proceed through the Indus-
trial Court for recovery of wages payable
under industrial awards, and the amend-
ment makes the lienee responsible for
payment of wages.
Amendments to Workers' Accommodation
Act
Delegate Meeting, which met in Janu-
ary last, appointed a deputation to the
Minister for Labour and Industry for im-
provement in accommodation and the
general comfort of pastoral workers. As a
result of the case stated by the deputa-
tion, the Act has been amended so as
to provide that every kitchen, diningroom,
storeroom, and meathouse shall have all
doors, windows, or other openings suit-
ably screened with gauze wire in such a
manner as to effectively exclude flies
from entering such rooms. Several other
amendments have also been made to the
Act.
Basic Wage
An application was made for an in-
crease in the State basic wage, and the
unions were successful in getting the rate
increased from £3/14/- to £3/18/- for
males and a proportionate increase to
£2/1/- for females. This was the first
increase in the basic wage in Queensland
since 1931. In March, 1931, the cost of
living index figure was 1343, when the
basic wage was fixed at £3/14/-. The
cost of living fell to 1327 in June quar-
ter, 1936, when after that the cost of
living began to rise, when in the March
quarter of 1937 the figure rose to 1445,
when the basic wage was fixed at
£3/18/-.
In February, 1933, when the cost of
living was on the down grade, the em-
ployers made application for reduction in
the State basic wage, but were unsuc-
cessful.


When the basic wage was fixed in July,
1931, at £3/14/- the percentage of un-
employment was 16.1 per cent, and since
the comparatively high standard of living
was preserved in 1933 steady improve-
ment in the percentage of unemployment
was maintained until at the end of Sep-
tember quarter (latest figure available)
the percentage fell to 7.2 per cent.
An application has already been filed
in the Court for a further ncrease in the
State basic wage.
Peter Atkinson v. A.W.U.
The Full Court of the Supreme Court,
comprising their Honours Mr. Justice
Webb, Mr. Justice Henchman, and Mr.
Acting Justice Graham, delivered a majo-
rity judgment in the appeal of Peter
Atkinson against the judgment of His
Honour Mr. Justice R. J. Douglas in the
case of Atkinson v. Lament and others.
His Honour, Mr. Justice Webb, in a
long judgment, said that, in his opinion,
the appeal should be dismissed with
costs.
His Honour Mr, Justice Henchman
said that he considered the appeal as
against the Australian Workers' Union
and as against defendant, Bushnell,
should be allowed with costs, and the
judgment in their favour set aside, and
the case should be remitted to the trial
Judge to hear the evidence (if any) of
those defendants, and otherwise to hear
and determine the action. The appeal as
against Speedy and the other individual
defendants (except Bushnell) should be
dismissed, and the judgment in regard to
them should be affirmed. The plaintiff
should pay Speedy's costs of the appeal.
NT order should be made as to the casts
of the other individual defendants.
His Honour Mr. Acting Justice Graham
said that in the case of the A.W.U. and
Bushnell the judgment should be set aside
and the matter referred back to the
learned Judge. The appeal should be dis-
missed in respect to Speedy and members
of the Branch Executive, and the judg-
ment should stand.
John Charles Nolan and James Lane v.
A.W.U.
In reserved judgments delivered in the
Supreme Court in Townsville on Decem-
ber 17, Judge R. J. Douglas found in
favour of the State President of the union
(J. C. Lament) and other officers of the
union in two cases, finality in which
had been delayed pending the decision
of the Full Court in an appeal on a
separate action.
In the case of John Charle. Nolan v.
Lamont and others, the Judge said that
the plaintiff had no cause or action, for
the reasons given in the judgments of the
majority of the Full Court in the case of
Atkinson v. Lamont and others.
Nolan's action was dismissed against
all defendants with costs, including ail
costs reserved.
In the case of James Lane v, Lamont
and others, the Judge refused to make a
declaration that the plaintiff's name-was
unlawfully excluded from the ballot for
the position of delegate to the annual a
convention of 1937.
He dismissed the action against ail the
defendants with costs, including costs
reserved.
The foregoing is only a brief outline
of the major cases taken on behalf of
the union. Many other cases wfe taken,
and quite a number of variations of
awards affecting their districts were
handled by the Southern and Northern
District Secretaries.
Members this year will be called upon
to exercise their franchise in the State
elections. During the Moore Govern-
ment regime the workers of this State ex-
perienced the worse conditions for very
many years. Since Labor has been in
power wages have been higher, hours
shorter, conditions of employment much
improved, cost of living lower, the pur-
chasing power of money greater, and con-
ditions generally are far ahead of condi-
tions prevailing in other States.
The year closed with record business
reported thoughout the State, and condi-
tions favour a prosperous 1938. If the
workers of this State want to maintain
the improvement that has taken place
under the present Government and
Queensland's proud position as the most
prosperous State in the Commonwealth it
is imperatively necessary that wage-
earners afford the union and the Labor
Movement that enthusiastic support which
is essential to the well-being of wage-
earners and the State as a whole.
Branch Secretary Fallon pointed out
that during the year no fewer than 76
cases had been presented on behalf of
the union to the Industrial Court, and
in conclusion said he desired to thank
members of the Branch Executive, District
Secretaries, Organisers, Reps., and mem-
bers for the loyal support accorded him
during the year.
Yours faithfully,
C. G. FALLON,
Branch Secretary.


Upon concluding his report, the
Branch Secretary informed delegates
that the further cases of victimisa-
tion at Ambrose lime quarry works
referred to had been finalised that
morning. He also explained that not
less than 76 cases had been dealt
with by the Industrial Court on be-
half of the A.W.U., and that fully
that number had also been considered
by Industrial Magistrates. It would,
therefore be seen that the union was
busily engaged in guarding the in-
terests of its members.
Mr. Bushnell moved: “That the
Branch Secretary’s report be
adopted.” Delegates would appre-
ciate the extensive ground covered by
the report, and that it was an effec-
tive reply to the carping critics who
were forever asking, “What has the
union done for us ? ” Any person who
took the trouble to read this and
other relevant reports and who think
intelligently would realise the im-
mense amount of work that was car-
ried out by the organisation in the
interest of members generally, and
that if the officials were given the co-
operation due to them much more
would be achieved in the future. He
urged members of the union to read
“The Worker” and all reports bearing
upon the activities of their organisa-
tion, so as tc be better fitted to help
the Movement to achieve even more
for them.
Mr. Burns, in seconding the motion,
said that the report covered a very
wide range of subjects and was con-
vincing evidence of the desire of the
organisation to guard the interests
of its members and to improve their
conditions. Unstinting credit should
be given to the A.W.U. for the tre-
mendous labour involved in the pre-
paration of the basic wage case that
had been brought to a successful
issue. The explanation of the victimi-
sation cases at Townsville and at the
Ambrose lime quarry works was fur-
ther evidence of the efforts of the
union to protect its members and up-
hold their rights. This could be said
of every industry under the juris-
diction of the A.W.U., and it augured
well for the future of the organisa-
tion, despite the white-anting tactics
adopted by an irresponsible few. It
would be a very long time before
these disrupters could justly claim
to have achieved even the smallest
amount of success in their nefarious
undertakings.
Mr. Brophy mentioned that the
statement in the Branch Secretary’s
report, “This was the first increase
in the basic wage in Queensland
since 1931” may lead to some am-
biguity and be wrongly interpreted
in the future. It could be inferred
that there was an increase in the
basic wage in 1931. whereas, in fact,
that was not so. He suggested that
the report should read, “This was the
first increase in the basic wage since !
the reduction in 1931.”
The motion was carried. !
Report and Balance Sheet
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) then presented his report and
balance sheet for the year ended May
31, 1937, and on the motion of Mr.
Boland, seconded by Mr .Bushnell, it
was received and adopted.
DISTRICT SECRETARIES’
REPORTS
SOUTHERN DISTRICT
Mr. President and Delegates,
In submitting my annual report for
the year ending 31st December, 1937, I
have pleasure in advising that the district
is still on the up grade, with an increase
of members above that of last year, and
I confidently expect that this position will:
be maintained during the present year.
Sugar, —The sugar season in the
Southern District has been a very fair one,
in so far as the Queensland areas are con-
cerned, and very good on the Northern
Rivers, where two of the mills are still
crushing. These two mills—Broadwater
and Harwood—are expected to go until
about the 20th of this month. This is the
first time in many years that any of the
Northern River mills have gone over the
Christmas period, and the crushings there
must be pretty nearly a record. Prospects
for the coming season also appear good.
Local Authorities and Main Roads.—
There is a good deal of work being done
throughout the district by and under
the direction of the Main Roads Com-
mission. This policy has kept quite a
number of our members in work through-
out the year, and although contractors are
still doing a fair amount of the work, the
jobs done by day labour are much greater
than formerly, and this is as it should be.


The Public Estate Branch of the Lands
Department also has several big jobs go-
ing in this district, notably reclamation
jobs at Coolangatta and Sandgate. Large
areas of swamp lands are being reclaimed
at both of these places, and the Public
Estate being added to very considerably.
Areas reclaimed are to be used for re-
creation purposes and building areas.
Some hundreds of our members are em-
ployed on these works.
Brisbane City Council. —A large num-
ber of our members are employed by the
Brisbane City Council in their Works De-
partment. Unfortunately, owing to some
of the loan works being completed, a
number were put off some weeks ago. I
understand that, the City Council having
obtained further loan funds, there is not
likely to be any more dismissals during
this financial year, and it is hoped that
some of the men already put off will be
re-employed. This Council has done a
very large amount of permanent work
since its election, and are to be com-
mended on the amount of channeling and
concrete footpaths done in the suburbs.
Water and Sewerage. —The City Coun-
cil has maintained its policy with regard
to sewerage construction, and about 1 200
of our members have been continuously
employed during the year. The extension
of the sewerage system is proceeding
rapidly these last few years, and this is as
it should be in the interests of the health
of the city. This progressive policy of
sewerage has been continuous for the last
four years, and is the longest uninter-
rupted period of construction since the
sewers were started more than twenty
years ago. It is expected that this policy
will continue until the whole of the city
is properly sewered.
A scheme of sewerage has been
adopted for the city of Ipswich, and a
commencement has been made with the
work. Whilst there are only a few men
employed at present, the number of em-
ployees will be increased as the work is
opened up in the near future.
Brick and Pottery. —Work in these
sections has been fairly brisk, and mem-
bers have been fairly continuously em-
ployed. The large amount of building and
sewerage works being carried on naturally
affects this industry, and all works are
kept busy supplying the demands.
Sawmilling and Ply. —Both these indus-
tries have been fairly busy during the
year, particularly the plywood section, and
a large number of our members have
been continuously employed. The short-
age of logs has had some effect on the
sawmill section, and there does not ap-
pear to be much hope of any substantial
improvement here. Although record sup-
plies of logs have been made available in
recent months, more than ever before, irk
many instances, there is still a shortage,
and the demand cannot be supplied.
Railway Construction. —There is very-
little activity in this section at present.
With the exception of a couple of small
relaying gangs, no other work is being
carried out by our members in this
connection.
Rubber Boot and Shoe and Textile
Workers. —Both these industries have
been fairly brisk during the year, particu-
larly the former, and a large number of
our members have been kept going.
Bridge, Wharf, and Pier. —Quite a
number of our members have been em-
ployed on the Storey Bridge during the
year, as well as on many lesser construc-
tions throughout the district. Wonderful
progress is being made with the Storey
Bridge, and it is expected that it will be
completed to schedule. It will provide a
splendid addition to the conveniences of
our city.
Other .Sections. —All .other sections
have been fairly busy during the year,
and their wants and grievances carefully
attended to by our offcials, in common
with other sections.
Many improvements were gained for
our members during the year, particularly
as regards "annual leave." This has been
increased to a fortnight in many in-
stances, notably Brisbane City Council
(Roadmaking), Brisbane City Council
(Water and Sewerage), Tramway Con-
struction, Water and Sewerage (other
than Brisbane), and one week's annual
leave has been granted our members in
many instances where none obtained
previously.
The splendid position of our organisa-
tion and the amount of work available for
our members is, to a great extent, due to
the progressive works policy of the pre-
sent Labor Government. Members will be
asked during the year to return the Labor
Government to power to continue this
policy. I, therefore, urge every member
to become an active propagandist and
between this and election day do all in his
power to ensure that the Labor Govern-
ment is returned to carry on the good
work. Attempts will be made to split the
workers on side issues; but, members, do
not allow any Tory propagandist to get
away with any snide method of splitting
the worker's vote to the advantage of the


reactionary Tories. He is not working in
your interest, but in the interests of his
capitalistic friends.
In conclusion, I desire to express my
sincere thanks and appreciation for the
splendid assistance rendered me by or-
ganisers, reps., office staff, and members
generally during the period under review.
I also take this opportunity to place
on record my very sincere appreciation of
the splendid service rendered me and the
organisation by a late member of my
office staff, Miss Mitchell, during the ten
years of her employment here, and to
tender her the very best wishes of mem-
bers and myself in her future sphere
of life.
I confidently look forward to a con-
tinuance of the splendid co-operation
during the present year, and in doing so
trust that it will be a prosperous one for
us all and the organisation generally.
J. C. LAMONT,
District Secretary.
Brisbane 6th January, 1938.
On the motion of Mr. O’Shea, sec-
onded by Mr, Bushnell, the report
was received.
SOUTH-WESTERN DISTRICT
Mr. President and Delegates.
In presenting my annual report cover-
ing activities of the South-western Dis-
trict for the year ending December 31,
I have much pleasure in advising
that the membership has increased, and
I confidently expect that this will be
further increased in the current year.
Local Authorities and Main Roads
During the period under review many jobs
have been carried out by the Main Roads
Commission and different local autho-
rities, resulting in an increase in mileage
of good road construction and re-condi-
tioning of roads throughout the district.
This work has given employment to many
of our members, and the outlook for next
year looks promising, as many new jobs
have been approved by the Commis-
sioner, whilst other jobs have been sent
on to the respective Shire Councils by
the Main Roads Commission for the
shires consideration. The Public Estates
Improvement Board has operated this year
in the Goondiwindi district making roads
to outlying areas that will materially
benefit those residents at present isolated
from the railhead. At Quifpie a sewerage
job is in progress. Cunnamulla has now
started sewering the town; these jobs
giving employment to many of our mem-
bers. Congratulations to those Shire
Councils for advancing with the times and
considering the health of the community.
Pastoral Industry
As usual, work in this industry is of
an intermittent nature. The eastern por-
tion of this large' district has benefited
by good rains, but around the Quilpie dis-
trict and further west the drought is still
acute, feed and water are scarce, and
unless good rains fall in the near future
the outlook for the toiler resident in this
area will not be of the best.
Many pastoral properties have carried
on ringbarking and suckering, thereby
improving the carrying capacity of their
country immensely.
As the result of representations made
by the A.W.U. to the Minister for Labour
and Industry, Mr. M. P. Hynes caused
the last session of Parliament to amend
the Workers' Accommodation Act, viz:
Prescribing that all kitchens, dining-
rooms, windows, storerooms, and meat-
houses shall have all doors, windows, and
other openings suitably screened with
gauze wire in such a manner as to effec-
tively exclude flies from entering the
premises. Another provision is that all
accommodation under the Act shall be
maintained in a reasonable state of re-
pair to the satisfaction of the Inspector.
Another essential amendment to this Act
is that provision is now made that every
kitchen, according to the number of per-
sons to be cooked for, shall have stoves
or ranges provided suitable for the num-
ber to be cooked for; also all tanks or
vessels used for the storage of water shall
be effectively screened, I state, without
fear of contradiction, that the above-
mentioned amendments to the Accom-
modation Act are absolutely essential to
good health and comfort, and are most
vital to workers in the industry. Anyone
who has worked in the pastoral industry
will appreciate greatly these improve-
ments. Yet we find the "die hard" squat-
ter squealing in the capitalistic Press and
all of a sudden professing concern for the
comfort of the toiler and expressing the
view that the workers in the industry do
not need or will not appreciate the
altered conditions. If delegates would
glance through previous Delegate Meet-
ing reports, read the discussions that
have taken place regarding accommoda-
tion, and the many resolutions sent in
each year dealing with the matter, they
will be convinced that the amendments
of the Act presented to Parliament by


the Minister are essential, and, after con-
sideration, will arrive at the conclusion
that the resolutions dealing with the
gauzing of dining-rooms and screening of
water tanks had become a "hardy an-
nual," and will now express thanks to the
Minister for making same effective.
Hotel, Club, and Restaurant
Employment under this heading is on a
par with previous years. Many complaints
are received from employees regarding
hours of work, overtime, and holiday pay,
etc., but in most instances organisers have
been able to adjust matters satisfactory
to the employees without having to prose-
cute the employer.
Employees are now entitled to two
weeks' annual leave in lieu of holidays
worked. This provision operates as from
June 14, 1937.
Butter and Cheese Factories
On account of the erratic seasons, work
in this calling has been irregular, but the
Downs country is now looking well after
the late rains, cream supplies have greatly
increased, and the butter factory workers
can look forward to continuous employ-
ment for many months to come.
Wool Scouring
Only two scours operate in this dis-
trict. The work is of an intermittent
nature. A scour is to be erected at Quilpie
in the near future, and this wili give
work for a few men while operating.
Sawmilling
This section has worked at even pres-
sure. Branch Secretary Fallon was success-
ful in securing "western allowance" for
workers employed in the sawmilling in-
dustry in this district, thereby bringing
them in line with other workers, as far as
western allowance is concerned.
Forestry
Many members are employed by the
Forestry Department in different portions
of this district giving employment to
many adult and junior workers.
Organisers
During the year Organiser Holloway
worked in the Cunnamulla district. Or-
ganiser Hayes in the Quilpie, Charlevitle,
and Augathella area. Organiser White
the St. George and Dirranbandi areas, Or-
ganiser O'Shea the Goondiwindi and
Darling Downs, whilst in the latter portion
of the year Organiser Tullipan carried out
work in the Mitchell and Roma districts.
In conclusion, I desire to express my
sincere thanks and appreciation for the
assistance given to me by organisers, reps.,
office staff, and members generally during
the year, and ask for a continuance of this
loyal support during the current year.
J. CARPENDALE,
District Secretary.

and that candidates who wished to
challenge the result cf the ballots
should appeal to Convention.
CENTRAL DISTRICT
Mr. President and Delegates,
In presenting my eleventh annual re-
port for the Central District for the year
ending December 31, 1937, I am very
pleased to state that excellent service has
been rendered to members in all parts of
the district, and that the work of the
officials, on behalf of members, has
achieved very satisfactory results.

Work in the various industries in the
district has been carried out with a neg-
ligible number of industrial disputes.
When the occasion demanded, members,
through their reps., sought the assistance
of organisers and myself, and the matters
referred to us were at all times promptly
attended to.
The following is a brief outline of the
work in the various industries:
(I ) Sugar of
the eight sugar mills in the Central
District proceeded very smoothly during
the 1937 season. The numerous matters
that were brought under notice were
promptly attended to and satisfactorily
adjusted for the members concerned. The
more important disputes occurred in con-
nection with standover cane.
Unfortunately, weather conditions up
to the time of commencement of opera-
tions were _ anything but satisfactory,
which resulted in very short periods of
employment to members. The comparison
set out hereunder shows the tonnages
harvested and the number of weeks
worked during 1937 season as compared
to 1935 season. From this it will be
clearly seen that on account of the mill
peaks in the various areas a lesser tonnage
of cane was crushed, which caused a cor-
responding diminution in the number of
weeks of employment for cane cutters and
mill hands.
that keen interest was evinced by mem-
bers in the business transacted both in-
dustrially and politically. The reps,
elected by members rendered helpful
service both to members and officials,
and to the organisation generally.
(2) Local Authorities and Main
Roads. —During the period under review
a considerable mileage of road construc-
tion has been carried out by the various
local authorities and by the Main Roads
Commission within the district.
Many jobs have been completed and
others are nearing completion, and the
carrying out of this work has been the
means of reducing the number of unem-
ployed. From advice received, a large
amount of work has been prepared and
will be commenced early in the New
Year by the local authorities and Main
Roads Commission within the district.
This will be the means of placing many
workers in employment during 1938 year.
(3) Water Supply and Sewerage.—
The Maryborough and Rockhampton City
Councils are proceeding with sewerage
construction, and large numbers of men
are engaged on both jobs, especially in
Rockhampton, where approximately 300
men are employed on sewerage work.
The Bundaberg City Council submitted
to the electors of the Bundaberg City
area proposals to permit the Bundaberg
During the season numerous well at-
tended meetings were held by organisers
and myself on mills and plantations, and
it is pleasing to be able to report again
City Council borrowing an amount of
£160,000 for the purpose of sewering
the city area. The electors decided, by a
large majority, to empower the council


to borrow the required amount, and, with
the additional loan subsidy of £160,000
granted by the Government, this will de-
finitely mean that numbers of men on
full time employment will be engaged in
sewer construction.
Obviously such additional employment
of men on full time at award rates is of
great importance and value to the city
of Bundaberg.
In the Bundaberg area the organisers
and myself did everything that was pos-
sible to assist the council in the campaign
in support of the loan proposals. The re-
sult of the poll was very gratifying to
those concerned, mainly with the health
and lives of the people and the giving
of full-time employment to workers
badly in deed of it. It is expected that
work will commence at an early date.
(4) Mining.— Mount Morgan and
Golden Plateau mines, Cracow, operated
tor the full period of the year, and large
numbers of men were employed at both
mines. There were no industrial disputes
during the year, except a few minor mat-
ters which, when referred to the com-
pany by the organisers, were satisfactorily
adjusted.
Many improvements resulted from a
conference between Organiser Howie and
the management of the Mount Morgan
Gold Mining Company, and members have
realised that the peaceful method of
dealing with industrial matters adopted
by the organisation in this case has proved .
very Satisfactory.
The Bismuth Products Mines, Biggen-
den, commenced operations during the
year, after closing tor some months, and
as a result about 34 men obtained
employment.
(5) Lime Quarries' Award. —Between
July and December considerable difficulty
was experienced in seeing that the Lime
Quarries and Firewood Awards were ob-
served in the Ambrose and Marmon
areas, and quite a number of very in-
teresting cases of victimisation and
arrears of wages were brought before the
Industrial Magistrates at Rockhampton
and Gladstone and the Arbitration Court
in Brisbane with a successful result.
The employer, Mr. H. G. Ambrose,
had in these cases disregarded the rates
and conditions of both awards, resulting
in action having, to be taken through the
Industrial Magistrate's Court at Rock-
hampton and Gladstone.
Branch Secretary Fallon appeared for
five A.W.U. members who had been vic-
timised by Ambrose.
After hearing the evidence, the In-
dustrial Magistrate ordered the reinstate-
ment of the men and compensation for
loss of wages to the extent of £204 10s.
Bd. to be made to the men concerned, for
the period from the date of dismissal to
the date on which he ordered their rein-
statement, and also fines totalling £lOO
were imposed on the employer.
Appeals were made to the Arbitration
Court by the Ambrose Lime Works Pro-
prietary Ltd. against the Industrial Magis-
trate's decision. The appeals were dis-
missed by the Court; orders were served
on the management of Ambrose Lime
Works Pty. Ltd,, and the amount of
£204/10/8 was paid to the men con-
cerned.
Also, in the victimisation cases of
four members heard in Rockhampton by
the Industrial Magistrate, evidence was
taken in two cases, and in each case the
Magistrate fined the defendant, Ambrose,
the sum of £lO, and ordered reinstate-
ment for each member. Ambrose appealed
against the Magistrate's decision, but the
appeal has not yet been heard.
In the other two cases it was agreed
that they be adjourned pending the hear-
ing of the appeal lodged by Ambrose —
the result of the appeal to be taken as
the decision in each of the two cases
pending.
The cases referred to have caused a
considerable amount of work and great
expense to the organisation. The Branch
Secretary applied to the Court for a
mandamus, with a view to preventing this
unscrupulous employer, as the defendant
in these cases, from employing men on
contract or piecework.
Several cases are pending and will be
dealt with at an early date.
(6) Sawmilling.— ln all centres in the
district the sawmilling industry has been
operating continuously, giving full-time
employment to a large number of our
members. Great dissatisfaction exists
amongst members because of the recent
judgment of the Court in not granting the
application of the Branch Secretary that
holidays be provided for in the award.
Members are eagerly awaiting a further
application with the hope that the Court
will at least grant a holiday clause in this
award, as is provided for in other awards.
(7) Cotton Industry. —The 1937
season was a very short season, due to
the fact that the dry weather conditions
were not favourable to the industry, re-
sulting in a very poor crop.

The prospects for the 1938 season
seem more favourable, as good rains have
fallen in the cotton areas.
(8) Butter, Cheese, and Condensed
-Milk Factories. —Work in this industry
has proceeded very smoothly during the
year. Nine butter factories have operated
in the district, working full time. The
new butter factory constructed at Biloela
is now operating.
Other Sections. —Close attention has
been paid to the policing of awards dur-
ing the year. Numerous adjustments have
been made involving a large sum of
money representing deficiencies in the
payment of wages by employers to their
■employees.
In several cases prosecutions have been
instituted against employers who failed
to observe the terms and conditions of
awards. As a result a large sum of money
has been secured which, without the as-
sistance of the organisation, could not
have been obtained by members. In many
instances these members have expressed
their appreciation of the service rendered
to them by officials.
Organisers. —Organiser J. Dufficy
worked the Maryborough, Isis, and Upper
Burnett areas until August, and was
transferred to the Bundaberg area for
the balance of the year. Organiser J.
Noble worked the Bundaberg area up to
the time of his death, September 12.
Organiser W. Ivey worked the Rock-
hampton, Gladstone, Mount Morgan,
Dawson Valley, and Cracow areas to Sep-
tember, and for the balance of the year
worked the Maryborough and district
areas. Organiser H. Tullipan was engaged
temporarily to work the cattle station
areas, Rockhampton to St. Lawrence,
Duaringa, and Dawson. Valley areas. Or-
ganiser R. Thomson was employed tem-
porarily to work portion of the Bundaberg
and Childers area. Organiser Howie was
employed temporarily to work the Rock-
hampton area.
Summary. — l have much pleasure in
placing on record the loyal assistance
rendered to me by reps, in the Bundaberg
area at the time of the untimely and
sudden death of our late comrade, Jack
Noble.
Also to all members, reps., officials,
staff, and District Committeemen I ex-
tend my sincere thanks for and apprecia-
tion of the loyal assistance rendered to me
during the year. Team work has resulted-
in another successful year, and the
humanitarian principles of our union have
formed the basis of all activities.
Political. —The work of our union in
this district has at all times been directed
towards fostering the fundamentals and
spirit of the Labor Movement. Particularly
was a lively and practical interest’ evi-
denced during the Federal elections cam-
paign.
Despite the attempts by the opponents
of Labor to defeat Mr Frank Forde,
M.H.R., the electors of Capricornia again
chose Frank Forde as their representative.
It was also pleasing to note that the
electors of Queensland chose the three
Labor Senators to represent the State in
the Federal Parliament.
Valedictory. —l cannot adequately ex-
press in words the great loss to this union
and to the Movement caused by the death
of our late comrade, Mr. Jack Noble. His
popularity and influence in this area were
remarkable —a tribute to his personality,
integrity, and his regard for his fellow
men. It is quite impossible for me to set
down the extent of my own personal
loss. To me Jack Noble was more than a
colleague; he was' a friend in the best
sense of the word.
Yours faithfully.
GEO. CROOKS,
District Secretary.


On the motion of Mr. Lough, sec-
onded by Mr. Dougherty, the report
was received and adopted.
WESTERN DISTRICT
Mr. President and Delegates,
It is indeed an honour to be afforded
the opportunity of submitting this my
eighth annual report covering the activi-
ties of Western District, and on looking
back over past years the altered condi-
tions obtaining to-day gives one a
feeling of pride and gratification. This
factor, undoubtedly, is due entirely
to the sympathetic and humane legis-
lation of the Queensland Labor Gov-
ernment, coupled with effective union
activity and the strict vigilance of union
officials in general. Such cannot be
denied, as their activities are exemplary.
Week after week, through the official
organ of the Australian Workers' Union,
i.e., "The Worker," one reads of advan-
tages that are achieved for the workers, as
well as the enormous total per annum re-
presented by increased wages; surely a re-
cord and an organisation to be proud of,
and one, undoubtedly, should be anxious to
announce, no matter where and in what
company he may be, that he is a member
of the Australian Workers' Union, be-
cause, after all, the history of the Aus-
tralian Workers' Union is surely the his-
tory of the Labor Movement, which was
built and backed up by a priceless en-
thusiasm, and to-day, as a consequence,
the Australian Workers' Union extends to
the four corners of the Commonwealth,
giving service to the workers and to this
great Commonwealth of ours, always
striving to emulate those grand fighters
who have gone before us.
During the period under review, four
organisers have been employed—Organi-
ser Richardson in the Emerald district.
Organiser Davis in the Barcaldine district,
Organiser Thompson in the Winton dis-
trict, and Organiser Freeman in the
Hughenden district—all of whom have
given good and faithful service to the
workers, as evidenced by the numerous
industrial prosecutions that have been in-
stituted, resulting in very satisfactory im-
p ovements in working conditions and
strict observance of awards, especially so
far as the living conditions are concerned
of pastoral workers.
On the majority of station properties
to-day it can be noticed that accommoda-
tion has been, and in fact is being, daily
brought up to the standard as laid down
in the Act applicable. This, of course,
makes the living conditions of the workers
healthier and more enjoyable; but there
are still some properties that are not
yet meeting the requirements of the
Workers' Accommodation Act. When
these are located by the officials neces-
sary action will be instituted to have mat-
ters adjusted, because, after all, good liv-
ing conditions are vitally necessary for the
workers, and I feel safe in saying that in
the next couple cf years accommodation
matters will not be a matter for serious
concern, because employers generally
realise that they will receive no fur-
ther concessions such as they have en-
joyed during the past. The conditions of
the workers are just as important as any
aspect of their existence.
Some considerable concern was caused
to shed workers during the period under
review, owing to sheep being affected
with a disease resulting in shearers especi-
ally becoming affected with a skin rash
on the arms. Immediately this position
was met, Branch Secretary Fallon was
communicated with, and, as records will
prove, he worked with amazing speed and
had the required machinery brought into
operation, with the result that any serious
ill effect that may have arisen was dealt
with most satisfactorily to all concerned.
Branch Secretary Fallon's sympathetic
and speedy actions were indeed appreciated
by all those workers who were directly
concerned, especially by myself as District
Secretary, because unless I had the un-
stinted, loyal co-operation from him i
could not have rendered the service.
me, no matter what task I was faced with,
I had that sense of security and the
knowledge that I had the backing of
Branch Secretary Fallon, a feeling that
assists an official to forge ahead, no mat-
ter what might stand in his way. My fer-
vent wish is that such diseases will be
quelled, and that the Department con-
cerned will grapple with such diseases
immediately they arise. They have done
this for us in the past, and I feel sure that
their activities will be greater for us dur-
ing the future. Members can rest assured
that their health and comfort are para-
mount issues with Branch Secretary Fallon,
and all that members are required to do is
to afford that small measure of loyalty and
assistance to officials, who will never hesi-
tate to have the necessary machinery
brought into operation to safeguard their
well-being. That in itself is quite a
reasonable request, but it means a
great deal to officials.

Climatic conditions during the period
under review have only been fair. Greater
rainfalls are required to make the position
safe, because of the remarkable lambings
that have taken place; but the prospects
appear favourable, and we anxiously look
forward to an upward trend in the wool
market.
A summary of the industrial prosecu-
tions are set out hereunder, which should
drive home to members that the activities
of officials speak for themselves and dis-
close the obvious fact that their interests
are being carefully watched.

Showing an increase of 461 members.
On the whole, industrial matters are
fair in the Western District. As a result
of A.W.U. activity, the terms and condi-
tions as laid down in the various awards
are being more carefully observed by em-
ployers than was previously the case.
I now desire to extend to Branch Sec-
retary Fallon my appreciatio . for his
earnest endeavours and promptness on all
matters submitted to him, and for his
willing permission to institute industrial
prosecutions where necessary; also to or-
ganisers and office staff for their untiring
efforts and loyalty, and to all members
in general for their many acts of assist-
ance, and I ask that the same measure of
loyalty be continued so as to make it
possible for this union to still gain further
benefits for its members. In conclusion,
I extend my heartiest seasonal greetings
to all, and wish you a full measure of all
good things in 1938.
G. H. DEVRIES,
District Secretary,
Australian Workers' Union,
Western District.
31/12/37.
On the motion of Mr. Burns, sec-
onded by Mr. Davis, the report was
received and adopted.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) explained that the confer-
ences referred to in the report were
those presided over by industrial
magistrates in connection with dis-
putes and did not relate in any way
to those referred to in Rule 39.
NORTHERN DISTRICT
I am pleased to be able to report that
the returns for the financial year which
closed on May 31, 1937, were the highest
yet reached in the Northern District, and
that as the returns to December 31,
1937, are higher than the returns for
the previous year, the indications are that
1937 year will constitute a record for
the Northern District.
Sugar Industry, —For a number of
years in the sugar industry, as I have
stated in previous reports, we were always
faced with serious industrial upheavals in


different areas of the Northern District,
and for the first time the 1936 season
commenced without industrial trouble,
and I am pleased to be able to report that
the 1937 season was also free from any
industrial trouble. Amendments to the
Sugar Award made it possible to effec-
tively control the situation in the Burde-
kin area and in the Ingham area as well.
The sign-on for the Pioneer, Kalamia,
and Inkerman mill areas was carried out
strictly in accordance with the provisions
of the award, and as a result a number
of farmers and cutters who breached the
provisions of the Sugar Industry Award
were compelled to sign-on cutters who
had been approved, as provided for in the
award. Numbers of disputes at the sign-
on were referred to the Industrial Magis-
trate, and within at least two days of each
sign-on every disputed cut was satis-
factorily finalised.
In the Ingham area, the matters re-
lating to Weil's Disease were carefully
watched, and the Branch Secretary was
in a position to see that inspectors were
appointed to effectively control the burn-
ing of cane in that area. Immediately
upon receipt of information that cane was
being burnt as a precaution against
Weil's Disease, the Branch Secretary filed
papers in the Court for the payment of
extra rates for cane burnt under such
conditions.
The union has demonstrated again that
its policy with regard to arbitration is
sound and in the best interests of mem-
bers, and in addition is a costless policy
to the members of the union who have
been responsible for it. Where previously
thousands of pounds had been lost in
wages as a result of the direct action
methods, members of the union are
to-day able to follow their calling without
the loss of a single penny.
The season commenced in June in the
Burdekin area, and the three mills ran
through to various dates in December
without the slightest industrial turmoil.
The season commenced in July in
Proserpine and terminated early in Decem-
ber without trouble, and the same condi-
tions operated in the Mackay area, where
the seven mills completed the crushing
season in December.
The Haughton mill at Giru, and the
Victoria and Macknade mills have also
had an uninterrupted run, and this has
been largely due to the careful manner in
which the awards have been policed and
the policy of the organisation observed.
The organisers have brought under my
notice all cases which required attention.
and a considerable number of prosecutions
have been successfully undertaken both
by the union and by the Department of
Labour for breaches of the award, in ad-
dition to the numerous cases which were
taken on behalf of members who were
wrongfully dismissed.
As usual the Communists and their
heelers have done their utmost to retard
the work of the officials, and have waged
an incessant campaign against the Branch
Executive of the organisation and the
officials of the union operating in the
various sugar areas in the Northern Dis-
trict. Pamphlets of all descriptions have
been distributed from one end of the area
to the other, jobs have been visited and
literature circulated, with the object of
bringing the Australian Workers' Union
into disrepute; but I am pleased to be
able to say that the officials of the union,
with the assistance of the able advocacy
in "The Worker" and recently in the
"Clarion;" have been able to completely
frustrate them.
Mining. —Operations in the various
mining fields in the Northern District
have been carried on without interruption
during the year. Mt. Isa has employed
about the same number of men as in pre-
vious years. For the first time in the his-
tory of the mine Mr. Isa Mines has shown
a profit, and this has been largely due to
the fact that metal values rose during the
early part of the year and continued at a
fairl. high rate until recently, when all
metal values had fallen.
Trekelano.—Due to the comparatively
high rate which was paid for copper dur-
ing the present year, the management at
Trekelano was able to bring its plant
right up to date, and was able to do a
tremendous amount of developmental
work, which will assist materially in the
working of the mine, even though metal
values may fall in the near future. As I
stated in my last report, after the dispute
which took place last year at Trekelano,
the miners in that field were placed under
the Cloncurry Mineral Field Award rates
until an application was made to the
Court for an improvement in rates and
conditions on this field. I made an appli-
cation to the Court at its April sittings
this year, and was successful in having the
men at Trekelano brought under the
Metalliferous Mining Award, north of 22
degrees. At the October sittings of the
Court this year I was successful in
securing an improvement in the holiday
conditions of the award for all employees
working under the Metalliferous Mining
Award, north of 22 degrees.


The different mining fields in the Nor-
thern District have all been visited by or-
ganisers, and in most areas I have been
able to get the mining inspectors to visit
these places, with the result that we are
in a position to say that the conditions of
the Mines Regulations Act are being very
rigidly observed.
Charters Towers. —The Black Jack and
Swedenborg mines are still regarded as
exceptionally good propositions, while at
Lolworth, Ravenswood, and other fields
outside Charters Towers a great deal of
developmental work is being carried out.
The mine at Kelsey Creek should be a
profitable concern for some years to come.
The Mt. Coolon field has been visited on
a number of occasions by Organiser
Bukowski, and the prospects of this field
are much brighter than they were
eighteen months ago.
I have adopted the practice of giving a
great deal of service and attention to the
mining fields, and ths results of this ser-
vice are clearly shown by the absence of
industrial trouble on any of the mining
fields in the Northern District.
Railway Construction. —The Labor
Government has been able to perform a
fair amount of railway construction work
in the Northern District, chiefly in the
building of bridges, in t(ie reclamation
work around Townsville and in the relay-
ing and repairing of the existing lines.
The reclamation work at Townsville has
been temporarily suspended, but a great
deal of very valuable work has been per-
formed on the swamp which is now the
foundation of what will be a very fine
yard, on which will be placed the various
sheds, such as carriage sheds, etc, where
a great amount of important work will be
carried out in Townsville.
The bridge over the Don River is prac-
tically completed, and will constitute
another link in the formation of a line
over which traffic will be able to travel
during the heavy wet weather we experi-
ence in the North.
Main Roads. —Main Roads work has
been carried out on the Moongabulla
Main Roads job, the Eungella job, and on
many similar jobs, which have been re-
sponsible for keeping a large number of
our members in employment. The Main
Roads Commission, as well as the Railway
Department, have been hampered in the
very necessary work which could have
been performed by reason of the fact that
the Federal Government, through the
Loan Council, refused to make available
to the Queensland Government the credits
to complete these very necessary works.
There is a tremendous field for develop-
ment and improvement in the northern
parts of Queensland, and in no part of
the Commonwealth would Main Roads
work perform a more useful service than
in that portion of the State where Nature
has made available large tracts of valu-
able grazing and farming country, in ad-
dition to the tremendous and unknown
mineral wealth which is, to a large extent,
undeveloped.
Sewerage. —Sewerage work, which
commenced as a result of the Labor Gov-
ernment's policy in Townsville, is still
being carried out, and about two sections
have been completed, I have experienced
a great deal of difficulty with the con-
tractors in regard to the dismissal of em-
ployees, and a number of cases were
taken against the company for wrongful
dismissal of members of the union. Four
cases were settled in conference before
the Industrial Magistrate, two cases were
taken before the Court, and heard and
determined in favour of the men, and a
number of cases were settled,by confer-
ence with the employers. The job has
taken a great deal of time of the organi-
sers and reps, in policing the awards by
reason of the fact that employees are
working under different classifications,
and payments have to be carefully
watched. The conditions of work are far
from good, chiefly because of the nature
of the country which must be sewered,
and tremendous difficulties have been
faced by the contractors, as well as the
men, during the course of this work.
Owing to the presence of gypsum in the
water in the country through which the
pipes must be laid, work was temporarily
suspended, and the contract with the
Rocla Pipe Company was determined by
the Council, and the earthenware pipes
are now being used instead of the con-
crete pipes which were previously laid
down. Time alone will show whether the
ratepayers were right in allowing con-
tractors to perform this work, or whether
the work would have been more satisfac-
torily carried out under the day wages
system.
Hotels, Cafes, Shop Assistants, and
Carting Trades.— l am pleased to be able
to say that employment in these callings
shows an improvement on last year. This
improvement is definitely due to the
legislation of the Labor Government and
to the work which has been undertaken
by the various Government Departments
in different parts of the State. As a result
of the Labor Government's legislation,


the unemployment figures have been con-
siderably reduced, with the result that
trade has increased, and the figures which
were used in the Court in connection with
the application for two weeks' holidays
for shop assistants and storemen and-
packers indicate that the building pro-
gramme in the Mackay and Northern dis-
tricts has been considerably in excess of
any work of a similar nature undertaken
within the last ten years.
The provisions of the award in connec-
tion with these callings have been very
carefully policed, and some important
prosecutions Were taken by both the De-
partment of Labour and the union, and
cases heard before Industrial Magistrates.
Substantial improvements have been
made in several of the Northern awards'
as the result of applications which have
been made to the Industrial Court in
Townsville. The following awards have
been materially improved:
Shop Assistants, Northern and Mackay.
Storemen and Packers, Northern and
Mackay.
Hotel, Restaurant and Cafe, Northern.
Butter, Cheese, and Condensed Milk,
Northern.
Metalliferous Mining, North of 22
Degrees.
Cartihg Trades, Northern.
Clothing Trades, Northern and Mackay.
Baking Trades, Northern.
Mackay Harbour Board Employees'
Agreement.
An application has also been made for
a variation" of the Bowen Coke Ovens
Award, which case was adjourned for
hearing in Brisbane as the result of the
sickness of the advocate for the Mines
Department. This case has been heard,
and my application, which was presented
by Branch President Lament, resulted in
the payment of a weekly rate, annual
leave clause, sick pay clause, etc., in
the award.
An application was also made for the
40-hour week in connection with the
Cairns brewery, and was heard in Bris-
bane. The employees engaged in this call-
ing were granted a 40-hour week by the
Court.
The Court was also asked to interpret
several matters in connection with the
Water Supply and Sewerage Labourers'
Award, and although the union's claim
in two cases was not granted by the
Court, the Branch Secretary will later on
be able to make an application for a
variation of the award so that the anoma-
lies which now exist may be removed from
the award.
During the last twelve months a num-
ber of very important cases were taken
under Section 53 of the Arbitration Act.
These cases were the result of dismissal
of employees by certain employers in the
Northern District, and in each case, I am
pleased to be able to say, I received the
full co-operation and support of the
Branch Secretary in bringinc the matters
in dispute to a satisfactory conclusion.
One very important case —A.W.U.
v, Anthony Lucas—resulted in secur-
ing for three girls (Jean Swales, Mar-
garet Innes, and Dorothy Cummings) full
satisfaction for the treatment which had
been meted out to them by a Greek
proprietor, Anthony Lucas, of Towns-
ville. Another important case was A.W.U.
versus Harold Joseph Richards, of Ayr.
In this case the employee, O'Shea, was
reinstated with full compensation, and
the employer was fined for a breach of
Section 53 of the Act.
Another important case was A.W.U.
versus Lenti and Giambone, of Ingham.
Eight canecutters had been dismissed from
their employment by the employer, and
had been removed frorr the barracks, and
the case was taken by the union before
the Industrial Magistrate. As the result of
the union's action the whole of the gang
was reinstated in its forme, position and
completed the season.
Another case was the dismissal of two
employees by the Hinchenbrook Shire
Council. In this case also the employees
were reinstated and paid for time lost as
a result of their dismissal.
In the case A.W.U. versus Concrete
Construction (Qld.) two employees
(Williams and Martindale) were rein-
stated in their former jobs after the case
was heard and determined by the Indus-
trial Magistrate,
Another very important case was that
of the A.W.U. versus Townsville Harbour
Board in connection vith the dismissal of
William John Scheuber, who. was a com-
mitteeman of the A.W.U. This case was
first heard before the Industrial Magis-
trate in Townsville, whose decision was
appealed against by the union, and as a
result of that appeal the Court made
recommendations which were not given
effect to by the Townsville Harbour
Board. The Branch Secretary filed affi-
davits in the Court and made an applica-
tion to the Court for an order for rein-
statement and compensation, and the case
was heard in Townsville. Branch Secretary
Fallon appeared on behalf of the union.

and after the first day's hearing Scheuber
was reinstated and paid £25 compen-
sation.
A number of similar cases were suc-
cessfully taken in the Mackay district by
Organiser Dougherty, and in addition to
these cases dozens of other men have
been reinstated without the necessity of
approaching the Industrial Magistrate.
This state of affairs is due entirely to the
fact that the employers know that they
will be compelled to face the Industrial.
Magistrate on every occasion where em-
ployees are wrongfully dismissed.
Another important case was the Jeffery
case. On the advice of Branch Secretary
Fallon I prosecuted Mrs. T. M. Jeffery,
of Townsville, who held a lien over a crop
of cane which was being harvested by a
farmer by the name of Battaglin. The case
was heard in Ayr before Industrial Magis-
trate Mee, and a decision given in favour
of the union. Against this decision Mr.
Roberts, solicitor for Mrs. Jeffery, ap-
pealed, and on points of law the Court
upheld the appeal. The important fact is
that the judge, in giving judgment,
pointed out the reasons for the judgment,
and as a result of this action the Minis-
ter for Labour and Industry has brought
down a bill which will give complete pro-
tection to employees who are working for
farmers who have executed liens in favour
of landowners and who are not in the
position to pay wages after all the other
conditions of the lien are observed. The
prosecutions will not be difficult to
undertake, because they will be under-
taken in accordance with the Arbitration
Act, and solicitors will be excluded from
the Court. The result will be that thou-
sands of pounds of wages will now be re-
coverable on behalf of members who are
in the unfortunate position of having to
work for employees who are being fleeced
by landholders in the various portions of
the district.
Wages Recovered. —During the period
under review the following amounts, re-
presenting disputed arrears of wages, were
recovered by the organisers in their re-
spective areas:
These amounts represent money which
would have been definitely lost to the
members of the organisation except for
the care and vigilance of the union of-
ficials, who have been responsible for
policing the awards. The amounts are
made up of a large number of small
claims, together with claims for substan-
tial amounts, and the recovery of such
wages has meant the exercise of a con-
siderable amount of patience by the of-
ficials and care in the preparation and
presentation of their claims. Thousands of
miles have been travelled in order to !
effect settlements, and a complete record
has been kept by every official of all
amounts recovered in this manner. The
amounts mentioned do not include the
benefits derived as the result of inter-
pretations of the Court or of advantages
due to important variations to awards:
which have been secured as the result of
the union's applications to the Court.
Political. —A great deal of time has
been spent by officials in connection with
the organisation work for the Federal
elections. Literature has been distributed
by the union in every portion of the dis-
trict, and every official has co-operated
with the Australian Labor Party in order
to retain the Herbert seat for Labor and
to secure the maximum number of votes
for the three Labor Senate candidates.
The results have been highly satisfactory,
and although the vote for the Communist
candidate has been higher than previously
in the Herbert electorate, this is defin-
itely not due to any deflection from the
ranks of the workers, but is chiefly due
to the fact that a large number of
farmers in the various mill areas in the
Northern District deflected from the Tory
Party and at the same time recorded a
primary vote against Labor.
Members of the Union, particularly in
the Northern and Far Northern Districts,
have to pay particular regard to the pro-
paganda work which is performed by the
Communist Party in order to see that.
Labor v/ill be able to carry on its magnifi-
cent programme without hindrance from;
its traditional enemies.
Organisers. —Organisers Dougherty and-
O'Gorman worked the Mackay district,
Organiser Nicholson the Proserpine area,
Organiser Bukowski, Ayr and the cattle
stations. Organiser Stevens, Ingham; Or-’
ganiser Burns, Townsville; and Organiser:
Prideaux, Mt. Isa. During the past twelve:
months. Organiser Bukowski visited all
the cattle stations between Nebo, Lake
Elphinstone, through to Mt. Coolon and l
Lake Buchanan, north to Pentland and


W. J. DUNSTAN

Appointed to Arbitration Court 1925
Died September 13, 1930




across to Mingela. Some thousands of
miles were travelled in order to do the
cattle stations lying within the boun-
daries, and to visit the stations north of
Pentland, through to Cargoon, Wanda-
vale, Niall, Bluff Downs, etc., back to the
Reid River and into Townsville. Further
visits will be made during the next year,
when matters affecting accommodation
will be dealt with by the Industrial In-
spector, who will accompany him on one
of those visits.
Summary. —l am very pleased with the
results of the service which have been
rendered by the officials and the staff
during the past twelve months. No per-
sonal sacrifice of time or effort has been
too great for those whose task it has
been .to see that the policy of the union
has been given effect to. The majority of
the reps, of the organisation have done
all in their power to assist me in render-
ing the maximum of service to members
in this very extensive district. Reps, and
members have given every co-operation
to myself and the organisers, and as a
result of that co-operation a splendid
spirit exists in the Northern District.
The intense campaign which has been
waged by the Communist Party to white
ant the union has been completely de-
feated by the co-operation of the loyal
reps, and members of the union who have
come in contact with it. This campaign of
malicious misrepresentation has proceeded
without interruption on every job where
pamphlets of a libellous nature have been
freely distributed, and to the eternal
credit of the loyal and worth-while mem-
bers of the union it can be said that the
white-anting process has not only been
counteracted but the ranks of the A.W.U.
have been solidified in order to
combat it.
To all members, reps., officials, and
staff in the different offices I extend my
sincere thanks for the loyal and splendid
support given to me during the past
twelve months.
W. B. HAY.
On the motion of Mr. Dougherty,
seconded by Mr. O’Gorman, the report
was received and adopted.
FAR NORTHERN DISTRICT
Mr. President and Delegates,
I beg leave to present the annual re-
port of the Far Northern District for the
year ending December 31, 1937.
Sugar Industry
Members employed in this industry
have had a very successful year. Most of
the mills started crushing in June and
continued working without interruption
into Christmas week. Although the crops
harvested were a little less than the pre-
vious year, the output of sugar was
greater. Disputes of a minor nature were
frequent and extended to all areas, and
as a consequence a considerable amount
of the organisers' time was taken up in
adjusting these disputes, the greater num-
ber of them being eventually referred to
the Industrial Magistrate for decision,
which was, in most cases, given in favour
of our members. I found it necessary to
refer matters to the Industrial Magis-
trate, when, if a little common sense had
been exercised by the employer and the
award correctly interpreted, no dispute
would have arisen.
I have again had occasion to prosecute
members and employers for breaches of
this award. Members being prosecuted for
employing women cooks. Convictions were
recorded and penalties imposed which, 1
feel sure, will act as a deterrent to this
type of employee in future.
Mining Industry
During the year this industry has been
on the down grade in my district. I had
great hopes that this industry would ab-
sorb a greater number of members in
employment than in the past; but, on the
contrary, during the year three mines
employing the greatest number of men
ceased operations, with the result that
approximately two hundred of our mem-
bers were thrown out of work. There was,
for a short while, a boom on the Wolfram
fields, but this was short lived, and with
the exception of the Peninsula the pros-
pects for the mining industry in the near
future are not bright.
Main Roads
Although a fair amount of activity in
this section was evident and a consider-
able number of members found employ-
ment, there were less roads under con-
struction than during the previous year.
The main Roads Commission and the
P.E.I. were the principal employers. Quite
a few of the jobs were completed, the
largest job completed being the Mt.
Garnet-Hughenden road; most of the em-
ployees on this job being transferred to
other P.E.I. works in the district. Judging
by the number of jobs contemplated by
the Main Roads Commission and the
P.E.1., I anticipate that a far greater num-
ber of our members will find work in this
calling during the coming year.


Sawmilling Industry
This industry has had a prosperous
year, and members employed therein have
had full time employment over the period
under review. Another plywood and
veneer mill has been established in Cairns,
and the prospects for this industry look
bright indeed.
Building Trades
This section has been very active dur-
ing the year, many new buildings being
erected, and members following this occu-
pation have had a greater amount of work
than for many years past, and if the work
that is contemplated in the near future
is gone on with a considerable number of
our members should find employment for
some time to come.
Hotels and Cafes
This section has, as in the past, en-
tailed a considerable amount of policing.
I find the employers in this industry the
hardest on their employees. Some of them
will stoop to almost anything, and with
them no trick is too mean or shabby to
catch their employees for a few shillings,
or to deprive them of some of the bene-
fits of the award. In one instance alone
an inspection of the time books of the
Cairns hotels by Organiser Boland and
myself disclosed the fact that employers
had ignored entirely the provisions of the
award for double rime to be paid to em-
ployees working on Christmas Day, Good
Friday, Anzac Day, and Labor Day. The
result of our inspection in this instance
was that our members employed in hotels
benefited to the extent of £284, and in
cafes to over £4O. Generally speaking, I
find that the great majority of employers
in this industry will, wherever possible,
evade the award without the slightest
compunction.
Brewery
Application was made to the Court for
a forty-hour week on behalf of our mem-
bers employed at the Cairns Brewery. The
Court, after hearing Mr. W. B. Hay for
the union, granted the application, and
our members in this industry are now en-
joying a forty-hour week. The granting
of the shorter working week has resulted
in more employment, and has also re-
sulted in making for a more even distribu-
tion of the work performed by some of
our members employed there. Members
employed at the brewery are very appre-
ciative of the union's activities in this
respect.
Other Sections
The number employed in the Shop
.Assistants, Storemen and Packers, Carting
Trades, and other sections have remained
stationary, and little or no trouble was
experienced in these sections.
General
Sittings of the Industrial Court were
held at Townsville during the year, and,
owing to the activity of the union, many
awards were varied to the’ advantage of
our members.
Wages Recovered
During the period under review, the
following amounts representing arrears of
wages due to members under the various
awards were recovered by organisers and'
myself:
Sugar Industry Award, £776/16/1;
Hotel Award, £533/13/1; Metalliferous
Mining Award, £436/10/7; Local
Authorities' Award, £125/8/-; Firewood
Cutting Award, £249/5/-; Carting:
Trades Award, £7B/11/-; Building
Trades Award, £7O/7/4; Cafe Award,
£92/4/6; Railway Construction Award;:
£4O; Laun.dry Award, £2O/16/8; Board-:
ing House Award, £9/12/8; Sawmiliing
Award, £B/14/-; Baking Trades Award,!
£l5/5/11; Private Hospitals Award,!
£4/13/-; Station Hands' Award,
£3; Shop Assistants' Award, £23/15/4;
Veneer and Plywood Award, £7/5/-.!
Total, £2495/18/2. !
This represents an amount the greater
portion of which would have been lost to ’
members were it not for the activities of 1
the union.
Organisers
The following organisers were employed
wholly or partly during the year: J.
Murphy, Gordonvale-Babinda; R. McMul-
len, Innisfail-Tully; H. Boland, Cairns-
Mossman; G. Ross, Tableland and mining
centres; F. Scholl, Tully.
Membership
Despite the fact that a lesser number
of members were employed during the
year in the mining industry and under the
Local Authorities' Award, the member-
ship for the Far Northern District has in-
creased by 471 for the period ending
December 31, and I anticipate a greater
increase for the remaining period of the
financial year.


In conclusion, I desire to thank mem-
bers, representatives, organisers, members
of the District Committee, and office staff
for their loyalty and assistance rendered
me during the year.
P. BUSHNELL,
District Secretary.
Cairns, 3/ 1 /38.
On the motion of Mr.. Crooks, sec-
onded by Mr. Dougherty, the report
was received and adopted.
SALARIES AND FEES
Branch Secretary
Mr. Brown moved: “That the sal-
ary of the Branch Secretary be the
same as last year, viz., £900.” Mr.
Burns seconded the motion.
Motion carried.
District Secretaries’ Salaries
Mr. Dougherty moved: “That the
salaries of District Secretaries be
the same as last year, £525.” Mr.
Dufficy seconded the motion, which
was carried.
Organisers’ Salaries
Mr. Thomson moved: “That the
salaries be fixed at £475, the same
as last year.” Mr. Nicolson second-
ed the motion, which was carried.
Returning Officer’s Fee
Mr. Dougherty moved; “That the
fee be fixed at £lO 10s., the same as
last year. Mr. Bushnell seconded the
motion.
Mr. BroWn said that in view of the
increasing importance of the ballots
and the work associated with them
the returning officer was entitled to
a bigger fee. He therefore moved
as an amendment: “That the fee be
£25.” Mr. Brophy seconded the
amendment.
Mr. Boland: What are the duties of
the Branch Returning Officer?
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): They are as set out in the
rules.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that without wishing to
detract in any way from the import-
ance of the position he considered
that a fee of £lO 10s. was ample
for the ordinary work to be done, but
if the duties were increased, a bigger
fee should be paid. He admitted that
the allowance was not over-liberal,
but he should like to correct the mis-
taken impression that might get
abroad that the analysis sheet show-
ing the results of the ballots each
year was part of the ordinary work
of the returning officer covered by
the payment of a fee of £lO _ 10s.
While it was part of his ordinary
work, they should understand that
the returning officer was paid an ad-
ditional amount for the compilation
of the analysis sheet. That practice
would be followed in the future, too,
and although the additional amount
to be paid was decided at the discre-
tion of the Branch President and
Secretary, it was difficult beforehand
to fix the amount in view of the work
associated with the varying difficul-
ties of the ballots. A fee of £25
would not be adequate for the work
of the returning officer in addition to
the labour involved in compiling the
analysis sheet. Delegates would be
wise to fix the fee for the ordinary
work at £lO 10s.
Amendment lost. Motion carried.
ELECTION OF OFFICERS
Returning Officer
Mr. Perrett moved: “That Mr.
Marshall be appointed Branch Re-
turning Officer.”
Mr. Crooks moved: “That Mr.
Woolford be appointed Branch Re-
turning Officer.”
Mr. Hay expressed the view that
Mr. Woolford would make an admir-
able succeessor to Mr. .Speedy. He
was a member of “The Worker”
staff, exceptionally good at figures,
and they should remember that Mr.
Speedy too, was on “The Worker”
staff before he became associated
with the ballot. Having all these cir-
cumstances in view he had received
the consent of Mr. Woolford to be
nominated.
Mr. Lewis claimed that Mr. Mar-
shall, who had been an active mem-
ber of the organisation for many
years, had also been a scrutineer and
had gained valuable experience under
the guidance of Mr. Speedy, he
would be better fitted for the position.
He was very popular, and with all
due deference to Mr. Woolford he was
bound to point out that he (Mr. Wool-
ford) had had no experience with
ballots. Mr. Marshall was a man of
mature years, with sound general
knowledge, and one who understood


the Movement and its ideals. The
questions associated with the ballots
that would come up for decision in
the future would perhaps require the
attention of a man of mature years
and keen judgment.
Mr. Lough said that he knew both
nominees, but Mr. Marshall, who was
a very capable member, had been as-
sociated with the organisation for
many years. In the early days of
the formation of the Municipal Sec-
tion of the organisation he was one
of his first reps., and had always
taken a keen interest in the Move-
ment both as a rep. and as a member.
He had acted as a scrutineer at one
of the recent ballots, and he should
be a worthy successor to Mr. Speedy.
He was a man of practical experience
and of sound knowledge. He should
receive the position.
Mr. Crooks explained that in nomi-
nating Mr. Woolford he had first
made adequate inquiries to satisfy
himself that he (Mr. Woolford)
would commence his duties where Mr.
Speedy had commenced. The position
demanded a man with clerical ability,
especially one versed in figures. Mr.
Woolford could be trained to become
a competent man at the job. He had
no knowledge of the capabilities of
Mr. Marshall.
Mr. Hay reminded delegates that
Rule 54 (c) provided that branches
shall have power—“To appoint some
person other than an unflnancial
member of the Union to act as a Re-
turning Officer for the purpose of the
conduct of all elections in the branch,
in case no financial member has been
nominated for election to that posi-
tion.” t
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont): In accordance with Rule 54
(c) the returning officer must be a
financial member of the organisation.
Mr. Dougherty: Are they both
financial members?
The Branch President: Marshall is
a financial member, but I understand
that Woolford is not a member. There
being no other nomination I declare
Mr. Marshall elected as Branch Re-
turning Officer.
Trustees
Messrs. J. A. Speedy, M. Ramsay,
and J. S. Hanlon were appointed trus-
tees, on the motion of Mr. Perrett.
“Worker” Board Directorate
The following; were elected as re-
presentatives on the “Worker” Board
Directorate: Messrs. C. G. Fallon
W. B. Hay, G. Devries, P. Bushnell’
and G. Crooks. ’
Q.C.E. Representatives
Messrs. J. Lough, J. W. Perrett, 0. :
Lewis, G. Crooks, and C. E. Fallon
were elected as representatives of
the Union on the Queensland Central-
Executive of the Australian Labor i
Party.
Representatives to Political
Convention j
The following- were nominated: ''
Messrs. Fallon, Lamont, Brophy,
Dougherty, Holloway, Dufficy|.
Devries, Carpendale, Perrett, Bush-1
nell, Lough, Hay, Boland. Ivey, Burns i
and Thompson. j
As only 12 representatives were
required, a ballot was necessary. Mr.
Murphy was appointed Returning
Officer, and Messrs. Lewis, Brown
and O’Shea, Scrutineers.
The first ballot resulted in the
election of the following:
1. G. Devries.
2. C. G. Fallon.
3. J. C. Lamont.

6. G. Burns.
7. G. Crooks.
8. W. B. Hay.
9. P. Bushnell.
10. D. Brophy.
11. J. Lough.
The next highest candidates re-
ceived an equal number of votes, and
after an exhaustive ballot J. W. Per-
rett was declared elected on the cast-
ing vote of the Returning Officer.
The meeting authorised the Re-
turning Officer to destroy the ballot
papers.
Notices of Motion
On the motion of Mr. Perrett, sec-
onded by Mr. Holloway, it was re-
solved that all notices of motion be
in the hands of the Branch President
by 2 p.m. on Wednesday, the 19th
January.
Shearing Industry Award—Universal
Tally
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont): The following resolution
has been submitted by Moonjaree


Station: “That in preference to uni-
versal tally the piece-work rate be
abolished and a weekly rate be sub-
stituted, and that 80 sheep per day
constitute a day’s tally.” He ruled
that it was not competent for Dele-
gate Meeting to deal with the ques-
tion of a universal tally, as the mat-
ter had been considered by Conven-
tion last year and adjourned to the
forthcoming Convention. At the Ho-
bart Convention, held last year, a
pastoral committee was set up to
deal with the matter, and it recom-
mended that a plebiscite of the mem-
bers be taken on the question. It was
again brought before the Convention,
and again considered by the pastoral
committee. It recommended that a
plebiscite of members on the question
of the universal tally be deferred for
one year and that in the meantime
members be informed by circular
that Convention affirmed the prin-
ciple, but before submitting it to a
plebiscite an expression of opinion be
obtained from members before they
were asked to vote. In presenting
that report, Mr. McNeill said that
the committee considered the matter
much too important for a plebiscite
of members until they had been af-
forded an opportunity of holding
meetings in the various sheds, dis-
cussing the question, and notifying
the union of their opinion.
In view of the resolution carried
at the last Convention, it was not
competent for Delegate Meeting to
take the matter out of the hands of
the Convention. Therefore he ruled
that resolutions 1 to 32, dealing with
the universal tally, could not be dis-
cussed at Delegate Meeting.
Mr. Holloway: The resolutions also
deal with other matters.
The Branch President; They are all
wrapped up in the question of a uni-
versal tally.
Printing of “The Worker”
On behalf of “The Worker” man-
agement, the General Secretary (Mr.
C. G. Fallon) extended a hearty in-
vitation to members to be present at
9 o’clock on Wednesday morning to
see “The Worker” in the actual pro-
cess of being printed. He assured
them that the inspection would be a
very interesting one and that they
would gain much thereby.
Delegate Meeting adjourned until
the following day.
SECOND DAY
The Twenty-fifth Annual Delegate
Meeting of the Australian Workers’
Union (Queensland Branch) con-
tinued its sittings at the Worker
Building, Elizabeth Street, Brisbane,
on Tuesday morning, January 18,
1938, Branch President J. C. Lament
in the chair.
The delegates present as on pre-
vious day.
The minutes and the official report
of the previous day’s sitting were
adopted.
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE
Open Inquiry Sought
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved:
“That the Standing Orders be
suspended to permit Delegate
Meeting to discuss a matter of
vital importance to every person
in Australia.”
In view of the information that he
had received it was imperative that
they should act quickly in the mat-
ter. He intended to refer to the un-
satisfactory conditions that obtained
in the Royal Australian Air Force,
and it behoved them to deal with the
matter promptly. Two inquiries were
to be held, one into the death of his
son, and another by experts.
Mr. Lough seconded the motion,
which was carried.
The Branch Secretary, in moving:
“That this Delegate Meeting,
representing more than 50,000
organised wage-earners in this
State, views with alarm the
hopeless inefficiency and inade-
quacy of the Royal Australian
Air Force as disclosed by
the deplorable history of that
arm of Australia’s defence,
and we pledge ourselves to
do all things possible to secure
an open inquiry with a view to
greater efficiency and for the
purpose of, as far as possible, pro-
tecting the lives of the personnel
of the force, and as a first step
to that end Delegate Meeting
urges the Federal Government to
institute a thorough investigation
into the whole organisation of the
Royal Australian Air Force”—
said that at the present time it had
been convincingly demonstrated that
it was not possible to move the squad-
ron of the Royal Australian Air


Force from Victoria and get it back
again without mishap. He had given
the matter considerable attention and
claimed to know something about it.
Men Killed Through Incom-
petence of Experts
Last year the Air Force had cost
the people of Australia £2,600,000.
He now made the charge that men
had been killed in the force because
of the failure of experts to provide
suitable ground organisation. He
should like it to be widely known
that during the eight months ended
December 6 one member of the Air
Force had been killed on the average
every month. In September last
year there were 32 flying officers in
the force. Eight men had been
killed during eight months, not
fighting an enemy or doing any-
thing that was really useful, but
mostly in flights round Victoria
and New South Wales, where cli-
matic conditions are the best for fly-
ing purposes with the machines con-
cerned.
25 Accidents in 23 Months
During a period of 23 months
there were 25 accidents in the
Air Force, or more than one a month.
In the case of the flight to
Queensland, the distance covered was
less than that covered by the Doug-
las plane in flying to Sydney and
back each day, that it did the jour-
ney twice. It should be remem-
bered that each day the Douglas
plane covered a longer distance than
was covered by the R.A.A.F. squad-
ron during its nine days’ flight, when
it met with seven accidents, in which
one man was killed by being burnt
to death and another is now in the
Cootamundra Hospital.
Attempts to Shift the Blame
The day after the accident to his
son, the “Courier-Mail” had been
good enough to allow him space to
express his views concerning the
matter. On that occasioin he had
said an attempt would be made
to blame the pilot. His son was
not a “dud” pilot. . He was in
charge of the photographic work
on that flight, which necessitated his
leaving the flight and depending on
his own resources to take the photo-
graphs that were required. Over that
lonely stretch from Bourke to Charle-
ville he was away from the flight at-
tending to the photographic work,
which is not given to dud nilots to do.
Shocking Condition of ’Planes
The day after leaving Laverton one
engine overheated, and it was well
known amongst members of the Air
Force that once a Rolls-Royce Kestrel
overheated it became dangerous. It
overheated at Bourke and crashed
within half an hour of taking
off from Bourke. The machine
that his son took from Laverton over-
heated before he left, when under the
control of a flying leader, one of the
most experienced officers in the
R.A.A.P. But despite that fact, his
son was put into the machine
and took part in the flight. It was
only good luck that he got it to
Queensland at all. After the plane
crashed at Bourke the squadron stag-
gered on to Archerfield. He was pre-
sent to meet his son, and on all sides
he heard reference to the shocking,
shoddy condition of the tyres on the
planes.
The flight was continued on the
Friday, but within a quarter of
an hour the engine overheated again,
but the organisation was so poor that
his son was not able to signal to the
flying commander that the engine was
red-hot. The flying commander did
not know what he was trying to tell
him and did not know what was
wrong with the plane until he saw
steam issuing from the radiator. The
squadron returned to Archerfield, the
radiator was filled with fresh water,
and his son was put back into the
machine again. He said that they
might just as well have taken him
out and shot him. They again left
for Laverton. but only reached Syd-
ney instead of Laverton after four
hours’ flying. He got into touch with
Cootamundra just after the accident,
and he knew what hapnened. The nlane
came down in hilly, heavily-timbered
country. The engine had cut out. It
was not the human element that
failed, nor had it failed in any of the
other accidents. It was well known
that his son had carefully manoeuvred
the plane and landed it on the only
possible place. He brought the plane
down.


Notorious Defects
These planes were notorious for
the fact that they bounced when
they landed, and pilots had told him
that the Queensland aerodrome was
the only place where they did not
bounce when they landed. His boy
brought down the plane successfully;
it bounced about 20 yards, bumped,
and the rotten, shoddy tyre burst.
His boy was trapped in the cock-
pit; he could not get out, and
was burnt to death. When the first
person reached the plane he did
not find Fitzgerald, the aircrafts-
man, running away from the
plane, but actually crawling away
on his hands and knees. The
newspaper report was that he suf-
fered superficial burns, but were they
only superficial when they were un-
able to hold the inquiry because of
his serious condition? The inquiry
was postponed for a month in the
hope that he would be able to talk
at the end of that time. He had since
received notice that the inquiry had
been postponed for another month in
the hope that Fitzgerald would be
able to give evidence at the end of
that time.
Official “Explanations”
It was officially reported that
there was some mystery associated
with the mishap, and that his son
Jack may have been unconscious.
“‘Good God,” he said, ‘it was not more
than five or ten minutes before that
he was on the ground,.” There was
nothing to indicate that he was ill.
Unconscious men could not bring a
plane down, especially in the bad
country where he had landed it.
It was also said that there was
something mysterious about the
way the plane caught fire, that
it had not happened before, but
such people were liars, because at
Laverton itself, only a few weeks
before Jack was killed, a flying com-
mander, a highly experienced officer,
in one of the same planes, crashed
with a passenger, the plane caught
fire, and both were burnt to death.
Huge Expenditure on Hope-
lessly Out-of-date Machines
These things were taking place in
an Air Force that last year cost the
people of Australia £2,600,000! It
was common knowledge that the
ground organisation in Queensland
was hopeless, and it was even admit-
ted by the Minister for Defence that
the engines were of such a type that
arrangements were made to send a
man overseas to receive instructions
about them. He went and got those
instructions and returned to tell
someone else how to look after these
highly sensitive, complicated engines.
That was their experience with the
machines. The Rolls-Royce people
sent a man to Australia every now
and then to tell our experts how to
look after the machines, and these
were the machines in which they were
sending up the flower of the nation’s
manhood. Last year two Air Force
machines flew to Hobart, and they all
knew the sorry spectacle of that
flight. Northern delegates would
have a vivid recollection of the fate
that befel one of the gun pilots, a
man of outstanding ability, who took
a Hawker Demon bomber to the
North. These machines were pur-
chased in the Old Country, and the
model is nine years old. England had
1500 to 1600 front-line planes with
not a single Hawker Demon amongst
them, and not one over two years old.
However, the authorities appear to
think that these old type machines
were good enough for this country
in which to send up young men to
have them slaughtered*
Labor Demands for Open
Inquiry
Of course, they were going to
have an inquiry' into the death
of his son. Everything possible
had been done by the Labor
Party, both in the Senate and House
of Representatives, to have an open
investigation into the matter. Repre-
sentations had been made by the Pre-
mier of the State, the Hon. W. Forgan
Smith, and Mr. Prank Forde, M.H.R.,
and Labor Senators, but without
avail. He had also made reore-
sentations himself to the Minis-
ter for Defence, but inquiry into the
cause of the accident was limited to
a technical investigation by three
highly-placed men in the Air Force,
and they will make the report that
one would expect them to make, and
that was that the planes were all
right. They would investigate in a
sort of way the fact that they had
burnt his son alive when Fitzgerald
was able to give evidence, probably


on Bth February. He would make a
forecast as to what the findings would
be, as he had the depositions in
another burning case. He was tak-
ing this stand because he wanted to
protect other men in the force.
Another Fatal Mistake
Take the case of a young Queens-
lander named Laws, a well edu-
cated boy, a fine swimmer, and
one of the best boxers in the Com-
monwealth. He went to Point Cook
to receive instructions in the art ot
flying. The machines were handled
by means of dual control, which
meant that if the pupil made a mis-
take the instructor could correct it.
When this lad was in the air with
the instructor he was told to make
a forced landing. The instructor cut
off the engine, but in bringing his
plane down to the point to which he
had been directed he landed it on
some high tension wires. The shock
threw the instructor out of the plane,
but the boy sat strapped in the ccck-
pit and burnt to death.
The instructor first said at
the inquiry that he did not
know that the wires were there,
and later varied his story by
saying that he did not know
that they were high tension
wires. Whether they were high ten-
sion wires or not the fact remains
that the plane was brought down on
them, and that should have been suf-
ficient. A number of experts gave
evidence, and the finding of the Coro-
ner was that this splendid young man
was burnt to death as the result of
an accident on a certain day.
Flower of Australian Manhood
Sacrificed
Although Australia spent £2,600,000
on the Air Force of Australia
last year, the flower _of the na-
tion’s manhood was being killed at
the rate of one a month. The Fede-
ral Government had said that it
was no concern of the people, and
highly-placed officers in the Air Force
had said in a published statement
that it would be entirely wrong to
take the people into their confidence
and that the matter should be left to
them. To some extent they must be
responsible for the deplorable posi-
tion that obtained in the Air Force.
Why should they allow the Govern-
ment to stand for that kind of thing,
and why should they have inflicted
upon them a bunch of old crates that
could not leave Victoria because the
ground organisation was so bad? The
Government should be thrown from,
office if for no other reason than that
they placed boys in these planes.
Accidents Not the Fault of the
Fliers
He challenged anyone to make the
fullest inquiry into the training of
the boys. They were well trained.
He had 'gone into the matter thor-
oughly and he had not been able to
discover one instance where they had
not been able to land their planes
successfully. In every case the mis-
haps had been the result of something
going wrong in the air or after the
planes had landed. The human ele-
ment was not to blame. The fault,
lay with the damnable conditions that
existed at the moment. He reminded
delegates that when Kingsford-Smith.
or some other aviator was lost in
Northern Australia and a Wapiti
R.A.A.P. machine was sent out to.
search for him, it was unable to ren-
der any assistance in the search, and
that in every search of this kind the
real work was done by commercial
planes. Whenever a R.A.A.P.
machine was brought into operation
it was a dismal failure. They took
no more notice of a Douglas machine
flying 2000 miles to and from Sydney
than they did of a train steaming into
Central Station. But these machines
covered a greater distance every day
that they made the journey to and
from Sydney twice than the R.A.A.P.,
with the backing of the nation, was
able to do in nine days. No-
thing that could be done now could
assist his son, but everything human-
ly possible should be done to compel
the authorities to take some action
that will help to protect the lives of
those splendid men flying these in-
cinerators, sometimes referred to as
fighting aircraft. (Applause).
Mr. Ivey said that at any moment
Australia may be called upon to re-
pel a foreign invader, and it behoved
them to see that the air arm of the
Defence Force was brought to the
highest stage of efficiency. He re-
minded delegates that a few weeks
ago the French Air Force had covered
32,000 miles without any serious mis-
haps, whereas in Australia, in a flight
of 2000 miles, every time the planes.


E. G. THEODORE
Branch President 1914-1916




rose from the ground they were
forced down again. The sabotage of
the Air Force had gone on from the
very day of its inception. The treat-
ment meted out to Sir Kingsford
Smith was such that he eventually
met his death at sea, and he con-
trasted the treatment of this noble
airman with the attitude adopted by
the United States of America to their
famous airman Lindberg, whose ser-
vices were enlisted in strengthening
the Air Force in that country. .If
proper treatment had been meted out
to Sir Kingsford Smith and Bert
Hinkler they would both probably be
alive to-day to assist materially in
raising the Australian Air Force to a
high state of efficiency. It was clear
to all that a reorganisation of our
Air Force was imperative in the in-
terests of the people. At the pre-
sent time it would not be able to
withstand the onslaught of even the
second weakest Air Force in the
world.
Mr. Crooks deplored the loss of
such valuable lives in tragic circum-
stances. These young men who had
shown outstanding ability were more
urgently required than ever to pro-
tect the nation from a foreign in-
vasion. Words failed him in express-
ing his disgust and condemnation of
the authorities concerned for their in-
efficiency and maladministration in
connection with the R.A.A.P. It was
the bounden duty of the Common-
wealth Government to take immediate
steps to reorganise the Air Force so
that their sons would go up in the
machines with some degree of con-
fidence. Candidates for the Air Force
had to pass a high physical and men-
tal test, and were expected to have
sound educational qualifications,
therefore, they were entitled to ex-
pect that the machines would be of a
sufficiently high standard to carry
out the work expected of them. He
had refused to consent to his son’s
joining the Air Force until such time
as he was satisfied that the organisa-
tion was thorough and that the equip-
ment was of the highest standard.
How could the machines be regarded
as modern instruments when they
were nine-year-old models ?
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon): The fault is not so much
the instability of the machines in
this climate as the ground organisa-
tion.
Mr. Crooks said that he was not
competent to discuss the technical as-
pect of the matter, but he was con-
fident that the resolution would have
the effect of forcing the Federal Gov-
ernment to reorganise the service and
to provide better aeroplanes. Every
nation in the world was equipping
itself with the best air-fighting ma-
chines and Australia should not lag
behind. The Air Force should be re-
organised so that the flower of the
nation would feel confident of carry-
ing out their important work in
modern machines.
Mr. Bushnell thought that the ques-
tion should be put, as the important
thing was the carrying of the reso-
lution.
Mr. Hay considered that they
should be given an opportunity of
voicing the feelings of their members
on such an important matter. It was
extremely unfortunate that a promis-
ing lad like Jack Fallon should have
been killed in such tragic circum-
stances. He was satisfied that the
pilot was not the cause of his own
death. However, it was a fortunate
circumstance that his father was in a
position to advocate that adequate
protection should be extended to other
pilots who were likely to go up in
Hawker Demon aeroplanes in the
future. In his position as Branch
Secretary of the A.W.U. and with
the backing of the organisation, he
would be able to guard the interests
and protect the lives of the other
young members of the Air Force, An
organisaation with a membership ex-
ceeding 50,000 could exert a tremen-
dous influence not only in this State
but also throughout the Common-
wealth. During the last Federal elec-
tion campaign their political oppon-
ents had claimed that the Australian
Air Force was . efficient and up to
date, but later events had proved that
the views expressed by those -who had
espoused the cause of Labor were
correct. If the flight had taken place
after the elections many of the views
expressed by the Labor Party on the
hustings would have been proved to
the hilt. It was imperative that those
responsible for the present deplorable
conditions in the Air Force should
be brought to a sense of their re-
sponsibilities. The decent thing
should be done, and at least the
father of the deceased boy should be
allowed to attend the inquiry.


The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon: I can attend the inquest.
Mr. Hay was very doubtful whether
Mr. Fallon would be allowed to speak
at the inquest. However, it was
satisfactory to know that at least
he could express his opinions at the
Delegate Meeting, and that the work-
ers throughout Queensland would
have an opportunity of entering their
emphatic protest against the prevail-
ing conditions.
Mr. Dougherty pointed out that
virtually every person to-day was air-
minded and that air transport would
come into greater prominence in the
future. They should have an Air
Force that could resist an invasion.
Although both his sons had expressed
the desire to join the Air Force he
would not consent until' they had a
reasonable opportunity of carrying
out the work with modern and highly
efficient machines in'accordance with
a proper system of organisation. They
had every right to know what the
Federal Government were doing to
modernise the Air Force. The Mac-
kay Branch of he A.L.P. had for-
warded a resolution to Mr. Thorby
and to Labor members in the Federal
House urging an open inquiry into
the Air Force, but Mr. Thorby was
adamant that the request would not
be granted. The Labor members had
done all within their power, but with-
out success. He was satisfied that if
the Federal Government were to face
the country again they would be de-
feated on this very issue.
Mr. Holloway was of the opinion
that the Defence Forces of Australia
could be provided only by the estab-
lishment of an efficient Air Force. Re-
cent events had proved that the flyers
had negotiated the most difficult
landings under the most trying con-
ditions. The Hawker Demon bomb-
ers had landed at Cunnamulla, and
almost without exception the people
present were astounded not only with
the types of machines but also with
the disreputable and shoddy state of
the tyres. It was deplorable to think
that the best that Australia could
offer was an Air Force with a list of
casualties at r greater ratio than
was to be found on the Spanish front.
He shuddered to think what would be
the fate of Australia with such an
ill-equipped force if war were de-
clared to-morrow. Even in the most
favourable circumstances they would
not be a match for even the weakest
enemy. It should be remembered
that the leading nations of the world
were equipping themselves with the
most modern machines. He was as-
tounded to think that the young fly.
ers of this country, fired with en-
thusiasm and patriotism, should be
asked to go up in machines of such a
kind. He shrunk with horror from
the thoughts of what would be the
fate of these young men if they were
called upon to give battle with a foe
armed with the most modern equip-
ment. They would be doomed to de-
struction.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon); They would be a sitting shot.
Mr. Holloway felt that all an enemy
need to do would be to wait until the
machines fell down. The present
position should not be countenanced
for a moment. The Federal Govern-
ment should allow the relatives of
the killed and injured to take part
in an inquiry. After all, that was
only the courteous thing to do, and
above all it would fill the people with
confidence. The people of Australia
would not be satisfied if the tribunal'
was set up solely for the purpose of
offering an opportunity to the of-
ficials responsible to rectify their er-
rors.
Mr. Dufficy was satisfied that pub-
lic opinion was in favour of an open
inquiry. That was the view not only
of the members in his district, but
was also the view of all sections of
the community. The people, as tax-
payers, responsible for the mainte-
nance of the air arm of defence in
an efficient condition had every right
to know whether their purpose was
being carried into effect. It was de-
plorable to think that the Air Force,
with the backing of the whole of Aus-
tralia, was less efficient than com-
mercial _ machines that travelled
longer di stances every day in the
week. He recalled that the last
Federal election campaign was fought
largely on the issue of defence, and
it was alarming to think that subse-
quent events proved that the Govern-
ment that had acclaimed the effici-
encv of the Air Force so loudly had
really so bungled matters that tragic
accidents had taken place. There
was a general desire throughout all
sections of the community that there
should be the fullest inquiry into the
matter.


The Branch Secretary (Mr. C .G.
Fallon) said that he had received en-
couragement from people in all walks
of life urging him to insist upon an
open inquiry. He had received let-
ers from relatives, mostly the
mothers and fathers of pilots and air
craftsmen, who are still in the force
or who have been crippled or who
had met their death. Most of the
newspapers throughout Australia had
supported his request for an open in-
quiry, and some of them had pub-
lished a most damning indictment of
the Government. Whatever differ-
ences they might have with the Press
at times, on this occasion they had
rendered every assistance in forcing
the Commonwealth Government to
have an open inquiry. He was very
grateful for that assistance. Both
his son Jack and Fitzgerald had para-
chutes, and if his son had had any
doubt about bringing the plane down
he could have got out with the para-
chute. Fitzgerald had the parachute
strapped to his back, but when he
was found it was blazing. He must
be in a pretty bad condition when
people are not allowed to visit him.
Motion carried.
Correspondence
Letter from F. C. Broad, Mourilyan,
dated January 14, 1938, alleging ir-
regularities in connection with the
ballots; letter from the South John-
stone A.W.U. Cane Cutters’ Commit-
tee, signed by Messrs. J. Baker, S.
Lee, and W. Duggan; telegram from
the Minister for Transport, the Hon.
J. Dash, conveying the season’s greet-
ings to delegates.
On the motion of Mr. Bushnell,
seconded by Mr. Boland, the corre-
spondence was received.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont) again ruled that in respect
of the letter from F. C. Broad, Dele-
gate Meeting had no authority to deal
with the matter, as Rule 66 provided
that the decision of the Branch Re-
turning Officer in connection with
the ballots is subject only to appeal
to Convention.
Mr. Hay moved: “That the letter
from the South Johnstone A.W.U.
Cane Cutters’ Committee be referred
to the Far Northern District in ac-
cordance with the rules.”
Mr. Lough seconded the motion.
Mr. Brown asked whether ballot
boxes should not be made available
at every job, or that adequate facili-
ties be provided to allow members to
record their votes.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) pointed out that it would
be impracticable to supply ballot
boxes at every centre where men
were employed, and that the prac-
tice of providing large envelopes was
in accordance with the rules.
Mr. Bushnell said that in the sugar
areas the men in different gangs re-
corded their votes and passed them
direct to the District Returning Offi-
ver. He agreed that it would be im-
practicable to provide ballot boxes at
every little centre. The purpose of
the South Johnstone committee was
to conduct ballot before Deputy Re-
turning Officers, but this was con-
trary to the rules. If such a prac-
tice was countenanced, it would open
the way to the manipulation of ballot
papers and should not be approved.
Tre Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that it had always been
his experience that organisers stimu-
lated interest in the ballot, and that
at no time were obstacles placed in
the way of the men recording their
votes. Obviously the big envelope
method was the best means of achiev-
ing what they desired. Everything
humanly possible was done to see
that the ballots were carried out in
a proper way. It would be utterly
impracticable to provide ballot boxes
at every little centre.
Mr. Brown suggested that perhaps
the ballot papers could be issued with
a copy of “The Worker,” because
many bush workers were isolated, and
it was difficult for them to record
their votes.
Mr. Dougherty: Each worker gets
a ballot paper and envelope.
The motion was carried.
Shearing Industry Award
Mr. Holloway moved: “That when
the organisation again approached the
Industrial Court for a new award for
the pastoral industry, application be
made for a 40-hour week.” Although
the same objection would be raised to
a 40-hour week in the pastoral indus-
try as many other industries, he was
of the opinion that this industry,
which was the most important in the
Commonwealth, was well able finan-
cially to accede to a 40-hour week.
Over the past 10 to 12 years the re-
turn to capital and labour had varied


to such an extent that the workers,
were 15 per cent worse off. He
meant by that that the workers re-
ceived 15 per cent less now by com-
parison. The question should be de-
cided on the value of the industry to
Australia and not on a comparison
with the economic position in other
countries in the world. A reduction
of the working week by one-eleventh
would not make any difference to the
industry because the cost of lean-
ing was at so-much per 10 sheep.
There would be some adjustment
necessary in connection with shed
hands, but it was beyond question
that when men worked shorter hours
they generally accelerated their
efforts to such an extent as to do the
same amount of work in a shorter
time. Even in the case of shed
hands, it would mean a difference of
one-eleventh, or 9 per cent, and as-
suming that shed hands represented
50 per cent of those employed in the
industry, the difference would only be
41 per cent. He refused to believe
that the industm could not afford
such a small increase in the wages
bill. The industry was not subject
to interstate competition, nor was
the price governed by the cost of
production. The matter was deter-
mined solely by the economic require-
ments of countries overseas. The
workers in the industry were in fav-
our of a 40-hour week, and the mat-
ter should be considered from the
viewpoint of social and economic ad-
vantages as well as from the mone-
tary gain to the workers as a whole.
They could not stand still in the face
of the urge for a shorter working
week, and even if they did not suc-
ceed in convincing the Court of the
justice of their claim, they could at
"least contend that they had made
every endeavour to secure this social
right for the workers. When shear-
ers engaged at piecework rates were
prepared to accept the 40-hour week
it was convincing evidence that they
were of the opinion that in view of
present economic conditions such a
step would be a social advantage.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that although he did not
question the figures mentioned by
Mr. Holloway, he felt that they did
not accurately set out the relative
shares of the proceeds of the indus-
try as between employer and wage
earner. The Industrial Court had re-
cently laid it down that where it
could be shown that a reduction in
working hours would lead to further
employment and the industry was
capable of bearing the cost, the
.Court would not be unfavourable to
such a step. He felt that he had a
reasonable chance of convincing the
Court that the industry could afford
to carry the extra cost involved in
the adoption of a shorter working
week in the case of men not on piece-
work. Such a step would be a move
towards the consummation of a very
desirable objective. The A.W.U. had
been successful in this State, and in
West Australia, in securing a 40-hour
week in certain industries, but it
would be impossible to have the prin-
ciple made universal unless the wage
earners themselves were prepared to
sink their pettifogging differences
and refuse to listen to people who
were attempting to disrupt the work-
ing class movement under the guise
of the militants. He urged the
workers to turn a deaf ear to these
disrupters whom he believed received
financial aid from sources opposed to
the Labor Movement. If they were
prepared to do that and extend whole-
hearted support to the Movement, it
would bring them a step nearer to
the goal of the 40-hour week. By
that he meant that they would be
helping to return a Federal Labor
Government, the only tribunal capable
of carrying that policy into effect.
The Federal Labor Party was pledged
to a 40-hour week and would give
effect to it when returned to power.
It was the duty of every member to
deal with these disrupters as the old-
timers dealt with scabs, and treat
persons who tried to wean away from
the Labor Movement with the con-
tempt that they deserved. If they
would do that they would not only
be helping to achieve their objective
of a 40-hour week throughout the
Commonwealth, but they would also
be frustrating the efforts of a few
people who did not have their in-
terests at heart. He urged delegates
to impress upon members that they
should not lend a willing ear to the
sniffling of people who were opposed
to them even if they did masquerade
as Reds. If they were anxious to
obtain a 40-hour week they should
regard such people as traitors. If
delegates had any information that

would assist him in advocating the
40-hour week successfuly in the
Court, he invited them to send it
along as soon as possible.
The motion was carried.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That all
overtime worked in the shearing in-
dustry be paid for.”
In the shearing industry a shed
hand did not receive overtime unless
he worked more than 30 minutes.
Such a principle did not obtain in any
other industry; it was unjust and
could not be defended on any grounds.
In seconding the motion Mr. O’Shea
said that shed hands and penners-up
had always had a very raw deal in
connection with the matter. He
would like it to be definitely under-
stood that the motion referred also
to penners-up, because some contrac-
tors regarded penners-up as not being
shed hands because they worked out-
side the shed.
The motion was carried.

Dear Sirs, —•
The Profit and Loss Account for period covered by this report dis-
closes a net profit of £4491 14s. 5d., after providing £3OO for Federal In-
come Tax in respect of the year under review, which compares with a
net profit of £4016 16s. lOd. for the previous twelve months. The follow-
ing statement indicates the manner in which the revenue has fluctuated
during the year as compared with 1936:
The net increase in revenue is £3596 which, together with an increase
in expenditure of £3121 (including provision of £3OO for Federal taxa-
tion), accounts for the increase of £475 in the net profit for the year as
compared with 1936.

Of the fifty-two issues produced in 1936, twenty-one were of twenty
pages each, thirty were of twenty-four pages each, whilst there was one
twenty-eight page edition, the total number of copies distributed being
2,099,740. Of the fifty-two issues produced in 1937, two were of twenty
pages each, twenty-six were of twenty-four pages each, and twenty-four
were of twenty-eight pages each, the total number of copies distributed
in 1937 was 2,241,829. This means that, for 23 issues out of the 52 for
the year, the size was increased by four pages over the previous year.
The 6.8 per cent increase in circulation, together with the material inci'ease
in size of the issues of the paper, have considerably affected the total
costs.
Editorial expenditure is higher by £lO7, this being occasioned mainly
by the increased size of the paper and new features being introduced into it.
Mechanical wages show an increase of £1582, this being brought about
by the fact that for six months of 1936 the paper was produced by the
Labour Daily Newspaper Company, Limited, and the charges were shown
under the heading of Materials and Expenses. On account of the Labour
Daily Newspaper Company, Limited, having ceased operations on 7th July,
1936, we found it necessary to produce our own paper which necessitated
the employment of our own engineer and stereotyper whose wages appear
under the heading of Mechanical Wages. Composing and Jobbing Wages
included under the heading of Mechanical Wages are responsible for an
increase of £1079, due to the increase in size of issues of the paper and
increased jobbing sales.
Material and Expenses show an increase of £lOB7, this also being due
to increased size of issues of the paper and increased jobbing sales, to-
gether with the increased cost of newsprint and flat bed paper.
The increase of £442 in Publishing Materials and Expenses is brought
about by the increased circulation and to the greater number of twenty-four
and twenty-eight page papers produced in 1937 than in 1936.
Advertising charges increased by £221, the percentage of cost on
revenue being 17.1 as compared with 16.1 in 1936. Advertising Revenue
increased during the year by £791, the percentage increase on the revenue
for 1936 being 9.1 and 109.6 on 1933 figures.
The increase in the basic wage was responsible for approximately £2OO
increased expenditure throughout the various departments.
SUBSIDY
The following table effects a reconciliation between the amounts paid
by the A.W.U. (Queensland Branch) for subsidy during the year and the

The rate per thousand copies distributed at which subsidy revenue
is included in the accounts is £5 15s. 7d. as compared with £5 11s. 6d. for
1936. This means that for comparison purposes, on the circulation of
2,241,829 for the year, approximately £457 more has been taken into account
than there would have been had the 1936 rate of £5 11s. 6d. been used
as a basis, this being more than olfset by the higher costs incurred this
year on producing the larger size papers previously enumerated.
REFERRING TO THE BALANCE SHEET-
LAND AND BUILDINGS, £73559 6s. sd.
The figure at which this asset is shown represents the cost of land
and building less depreciation of 1 per cent per annum written off during
the last four years. Included in it is the value of the old buildings
demolished in 1929 and 1936. The value, namely £13,020, has been written
off to accumulation account and liability of £13,020 under the heading of
Building Reserve Account represents the corresponding entry.
The accounts show an income of £2432 Os. 6d. from property which,
less expenses £2146 9s. 5d., gives a net return of £285 11s. Id. Income
from property has been considerably affected by the closure of “The
Daily Standard” in July, 1936, since the rent paid by that Company was
approximately £2400 yearly, of which £1450 was received last year and
nothing this year.
With the exception of approximately 2500 square feet of floor space
on the first floor the building is fully tenanted.
PLANT AND MACHINERY, £12,930 9s.
The value shown covers the cost of the asset £12,930 95., less deprecia-
tion written off to 1932, since when provision for fuAher depreciation of
£3079 3s. 6d. has been made. During the year 1937 £3995 13s. lOd. was
expended on new machinery and valuable additions to the plant to
modernise it and place it on a sound and economical working basis. At
31st December, 1936, the value of this asset was £6837 11s. Bd. after
deducting depreciation and provisions therefor, whilst at 31st December,
1937, it stands at £9851 ss. 6d. after deducting depreciation and provision
for depreciation.
FURNITURE AND FITTINGS, £666 ss. Bd.
The value shown represents the cost of this asset less depreciation
charged annually at the rate of 5 per cent per annum. During the twelve
months under review additions to this asset to the extent of £252 16s. 6d.
were made.


DEPOSITS AS SECURITY, £73
This represents a Fixed Deposit of £6O in the Commonwealth Bank as
security for guarantee to Postmaster General’s Department Bulk Postage
Account, and £l3 deposited for meters with City Electric Light and Bris-
bane Gas Company.
TRADE DEBTORS AND PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE, £3912 Bs. 6d.
It is considered that all amounts under this heading are good, but a
provision of £125 has been made to cover any of a doubtful nature. Bad
debts totalling £9B Bs. 6d. were written off in the year, the percentage being
.55 on revenue of £17883.
STOCK, £4320 13s. 6d.
All stock is in good condition and has been conservatively valued, the
figure at which it stands in the Balance Sheet under review being £1892
3s. lOd. in excess of the value at 31st December, 1936.
The stock on hand is considerably higher than in 1936 to enable
expected increase in turnover to be handled and also the fact that we
ordered substantial indents of newsprint prior to the increased price. The
landed cost in store of newsprint was approximately £l4 per ton, but from
September, 1937, it increased to approximately £lB per ton, and we have
had thirty tons of newsprint arriving monthly at the lower cost for some
months past and will have this same quantity of thirty tons per month
arriving on indent at the lower rate per ton until February, 1939.
COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA CURRENT
ACCOUNT, £3715 Os. Bd.
This credit balance will enable the Company meeting its liabilities
during the early portion of 1938 and at which period payments made by
the Australian Workers’ Union are not as substantial as those received
during the latter six months of the year. Furthermore, monthly ship-
ments of newsprint are arriving on the basis of cash against documents.
ACCUMULATION ACCOUNT
The net profit of £4491 14s. sd. made during the year has been trans-
ferred to Accumulation Account, bringing the net balance to the credit
of that account to £73,396 11s. lOd.
RESERVE FOR UNEXPIRED SUBSCRIPTIONS
This figure covers payments in advance and will be absorbed in 1938
as the paper is produced and distributed in that year. It is considered
that the reserve is sufficient to cover the Company’s liability to A.W.U.
members for subscriiftions paid by it to December 31, 1937.
TRADE CREDITORS’ ACCRUED EXPENSES AND PROVISION FOR
TAXATION, £1757 14s. sd.
This covers the liability to outside creditors and includes a provision
of £590 15s. for Federal Income Tax for years 1936 and 1937.
BUILDING FUND RESERVE ACCOUNT, £13,020
This item is explained under the heading, Land and Buildings,
£73,559 6s. sd.

GENERAL
(a) The Company as a member of the Audit Bureau of Circulations has
an audited certificate for a net weekly circulation of 43,036, and fresh
certificates will be furnished half-yearly. This is of vital importance to
us in order to fall in line with other newspapers throughout the Common-
wealth. Advertisers and advertising agents now demand from all recog-
nised media an Audited Certificate, preferably from the Audit Bureau of
Circulations, as a guarantee of circulation figures quoted by represen-
tatives.
(b) Sufficient insurance coverage has been effected on the assets of
the Company, namely, £30,000 on building; £11,500 on plant and machin-
ery; £5OOO on stock; also burglary, public risk elevators, and plate glass
breakage insurance, etc.
CONCLUSION
During the ensuing year it is our aim to stabilise the sound position
of the Company and to add to its progressiveness.
Yours faithfully,
On the motion of Mr. Brown, sec-
onded by Mr. Ivey, the report was re-
ceived.
Mr, Boland moved: “That the re-
port and balance sheet be adopted.”
In seconding the motion, Mr.
Crooks said that the members of the
organisation appreciated the fact
that they had a splendid paper equal
to anything in the Southern Hemi-
sphere as an organ of industrial and
political propaganda. A considerable
amount of work was associated with
the publication of the paper and it
was pleasing to know that during the
past few years it had been consider-
ably improved and the business
had been conducted in a highly
efficient and vigorous manner.
There had been a considerable
improvement on the mechanical side
and workmanship had shown a
marked advance. Its buoyant finan-
cial position was most gratifying,
and it was with pleasure that he ob-
served yesterday that delegates had
appreciated the efforts of the direc-
torate by nominating them , again. It
was gratifying to have that expres-
sion of confidence, but he hoped that
even better results would be achieved
in the future. The importance of the
paper should not be gauged only
from the financial standing of the
company, but also from the viewpoint
of its value to the workers and the
Movement as a whole. The get-up
of the paper offered no ground for
criticism. It was of inestimable
MACKAY ROSS, Manager.
value on the hustings and helped ma-
terially in the achievement of the
ideals of the Movement. There were
many people not members of the
A.W.U. who were delighted to receive
a copy of “The Worker” from the
various district offices. It was ac-
claimed on all sides as a paper worth
upholding. Its income was provided
mainly by a subsidy from the A.W.U.
and from the proceeds of advertise-
ments. Each and every one associat-
ed with the production of the paper
was extremely proud of it and hoped
to give even better results in the
years to come. He hoped that the
publication of the paper would con-
tinue for ever.
The motion was carried.
Shearers’ Rates
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont): The following resolution
is submitted from Winton: “That in
the event of no claim being before the
Arbitration Court at the present time
in Queensland for a further increase
in wages in the pastoral awards the
union take immediate steps to file a
claim for same.”
A claim has already been lodged in
the Industrial Court.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont); This resolution is submit-
ted by Glencoban Station: “That we
would like to see the union go to
Court as soon as possible for an in-
crease in wages.”
That has been done.


The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): This resolution is submit-
ted from Solferino Shed: “That when
the case comes up for hearing for
the variation of the pastoral awards,
such awards be restored to the
1924-29 level in their entirety.”
He explained that the claim lodged
in the Court provided for a wage of
£2 ss. which was the level that ob-
tained between 1924 and 1929.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That on
stations where stud sheep are kept
all culled studs be still classed as
studs and paid for accordingly.”
Culled studs, which were really the
worst studs, were culled not because
of structural deficiency but on account
of wool deficiency. The matter was
a subject of many disputes because
attempts were made to get members
to shear studs at ordinary rates.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion, and
it was carried.
Mr, Holloway moved: “That shear-
ing ewes within two months of lamb-
ing be paid extra.”
Shearers had to exercise a great
deal more care in handling these sheep
thus slowing, up their work and they
should be paid extra.
Mr. Thompson seconded the motion.
The matter had been a bone of con-
tention amongst shearers for many
years. Employers expected shearers
to take greater care with such ewes
than ordinary sheep and they should
be paid extra.
Mr. Bushnell asked whether it was
possible to say when ewes were
within two months of lambing.
Mr. Holloway: It can be done with
a reasonable amount of accuracy.
The motion was carried.
Mr. Thompson moved: “That all
rams be paid two for one irrespective
of age.”
As one who had been associated
with the industry for 30 years he
knew that ram lambs under 12
months were rung in as being under
that age and shearers had no option
but to regard them as all being in
the one class. He had seen ram
lambs shorn that were well over six
months’ old but the manager or owner
had contended that they were not.
The motion did not involve much
extra payment because there were not
a great number of rams.
Mr. O’Shea moved as an amend-
ment; “That all rams over three
months’ old be paid for at double
rates.”
There had been considerable
trouble in connection with this
matter.
Mr. Davis, who seconded the
amendment, said that any ex-
perienced stockman could form a fair
idea of the age of a ram lamb but
even when he took an industrial in-
spector on to a station to examine
' the books concerning this matter he
found that the books had been so
juggled that they could get no satis-
faction at all. He thought the diffi-
culty could be overcome by reducing-
the age from six months to three
months.
The amendment was carried.
Mr. Davis moved: “That all sheep
having over twelve months’ wool at
time of shearing be paid for at one-
twelfth extra for each month.”
On one occasion he found it neces-
sary to call in the Industrial Magi-
strate to decide the question in con-
nection with sheep carrying twenty-
two months’ wool, and that he had
ruled that the men should be paid
extra in accordance with the award.
He saw no reason why the men
should be penalised because owners
were lax in the management of their
properties. It was only fair that an,
extra rate should be paid.
In seconding the motion, Mr.
Thompson said that sheep carrying
16 months’ to 17 months’ wool were
much harder to shear because the
wool on the neck, for instance, was
matted and stuck, and the shearers
were entitled to extra payment.
The motion was carried.
Mr. O’Shea moved: “That em-
ployees be allowed to draw 75 per
cent of earnings for all work done
from commencement of shearing if
required.”
In many cases shearers were short
of money when they went on to a
job, and in most other awards em-
ployees were allowed to draw up to
two days of their earnings. He saw
no reason why employees under the
Shearing Award should be compelled
to work a whole week before being
entitled to draw on their earnings.
Mr. Holloway seconded the motion,
which was carried.


Shed Hands
Mr. Thompson moved: “That boys
lie paid adult wages in shearing
sheds.”
Although boys had to incur the
same expense as adults in getting to
the job they did the hardest work
and received the least pay.
In seconding the motion, Mr. Hol-
loway said that the employers realis-
ed that boys were peculiarly fitted for
the work of picking up, and the in-
variable practice was to employ them
■on all occasions because in perform-
ing their duties they virtually ran
throughout the eight hours. Adults
were employed only with the great-
est amount of reluctance because the
employer knew that they could not
do the same volume of work. Every
owner or contractor who spoke the
truth would agree with that conten-
tion. In other callings, such as
navvying, for instance, lads bf 19
years of age were paid adult wages.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) suggested that the words “all
pickers-up” should be substituted for
the word “boys”. They had to re-
member that the volume of work to
be done by pickers-up was not gov-
erned by their own capacity or their
own speed or their own inclination
but by the quantity of work done by
the shearer. Whether he was 16 or
60 he had to keep the wool away from
the shearer, otherwise he was of no
use to the employer. He had used
every argument in favour o the con-
tention that the adult wage should
be paid to persons under 21 years of
age, but so far without success. He
should not have to meet a hypotheti-
cal case submitted by the employers
in the Court in respect of men em-
ployed in the yard. If the motion
was altered along the lines suggest-
ed by him his hands would be
strengthened and he would have a
better opportunity of submitting a
case in favour of adult wages for
pickers-up.
The motion was amended as sug-
gested, and carried.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved: “That when the next
application is made to the Court a
provision be included that shed hands
be paid fares both ways to and from
the place of engagement.”
Their action would be consistent
with previous applications, it _ Would
affirm the principles, and he intend-
ed to do that on the next occasion.
Mr. Thompson seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Thompson moved: “That 100
per ce. t shed hands be employed in
all sheds.”
He knew of a case where boys 17
to 18 years of age were picking up
for seven shearers. That was not
fair to the boys, but they feared dis-
missal if they complained.
In seconding the motion, Mr. Hol-
loway said that it meant that there
should be the same number of shed
hands as shearers. At one time it
was conceded by the Federal Court
and in quite a number of cases where
contractors were operating station-
owners were continually urging them
to employ more men, not out of con-
sideration for shed hands, but be-
cause they wanted their wool treated
properly.
The motion was carried.
Mr. Davis moved: “That the matter
of performing dual duties of either
shed-hand-cook or presser-cook be
prohibited, and that it be brought
before the notice of the Minister for
Health, and that there be total pro-
hibition of dual duties in shearing
sheds.” It was becoming a general
practice, especially with small con-
tractors, to employ pressser-cooks or
shed-hand cooks, but it was detri-
mental to the health of the workers.
No person handling wool, especially
rotten putrid wool, should be allowed
to handle food. The matter should
be brought under the notice of the
health authorities.
Mr. O’Shea seconded the motion.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) opnosed the motion because,
judgin': from the remarks of Mr.
Davis, it did not seek what he de-
sired, He believed that it was his
intention to prevent people handling
wool from carrying out the work of
a cook.
Mr. Davis: That is so.
The Branch Secretary replied that
the motion provided for the prohibi-
tion of all dual duties in shearing
sheds.
Mr. Davis: For cooks.
The Branch Secretary said that it
did not say that. He moved as an
amendment: “That the matter of per-
forming dual duties of either shed


hand-cook or presser-cook be pro-
hibited, and that the union use its
best endeavours to prevent the per-
formance of dual dutes by either shed-
hand-cook or presser-cook, and that
the employment of any person hand-
ling wool at any shed and acting as
cook be prohibited.” It was essential
in the interests of the men that per-
sons handling wool, especially when
they were liable to come in contact
with cancerous, scabby, or fly-blown
sheep, or ewes lambing on the board,
should not also be allowed to handle
food.
Mr. Davis intimated that he would
withdraw his motion in favour of the
amendment.
The amendment became the motion
and was carried.
Mr. Hollowav moved: “That two
weeks’ annual leave be granted to
station hands on full pay and a mone-
tary pro rata for a lesser period.”
Workers who were compelled to work
under the trying conditions in tropi-
cal and sub-tropical climates and to
contend with heat, dust, and flies,
especially in the heat of summer,
certainly merited an annual holiday
on full pay. Station hands did not
earn the basic wage throughout the
year in one of their most important
industries, and it would be onlv a
slight measure of justice to allow
them to enjoy a privilege that pre-
vailed in many other industries.
Mr. Thompson seconded the motion.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that the matter would
be included in the application to the
Court.
The motion was carried
Cooks
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution is
submitted by Malboona Station: “That
the voting system be re-introduced
with regard to cooks.”
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) informed delegates that the
question of the election of cooks by
ballot had been included in the claim
before the Court.
Mr. O’Shea moved: “That no female
cook or female cook’s offsider be em-
ployed in the huts during shearing or
crutching operations.” In some cases
it was the practice of contractors’
wives to cook for shearers in huts
where there were 7,8, or 10 shearers.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That mem-
bers have the right to elect their own
cook where mixed messses are con-
cerned.” This had always been advo-
vocated in the Court. The right was
enjoyed by shearers but they were
now asking for a right that had been
previously enjoyed in the case of
mixed messes throughout the Com-
monwealth. They should be allowed
to say who their cooks should be.
Such matters had been advocated in
the interests of the members but
they had not always been successful.
Mr. Burns seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That all
cooks be paid the same rate as other
employees when they work on holi-
days.”
Shearers and shed hands were paid
for overtime and it was unfair that
the same measure of justice was not
extended to cooks. The restriction
should be removed.
Mr. O’Shea seconded the motion.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) explained that the wages of
the cooks had been fixed at a con-
ference attended by Mr. Riordan and
Mr. Carpendale and the cooks ex-
pressed general satisfaction with the
result. No one would suggest that
either Mr. Riordan or Mr. Carpen-
dale did not have a thorough know-
ledge of all the factors surrounding
the question. At the conference it
was agreed that wages of cooks
should be increased by £2 to £3 to
compensate them for working on holi-
days. If he advocated in the Court
that cooks should be paid for work-
ing on holidays he would immediately
be met with the retort that wages
had been increased as a set-off
against that disability. He was not
prepared to do that because he was
sure that it would not meet with the
approval of the cooks themselves.
Mr. Carpendale reminded him that
when the wages were fixed for cooks
they claimed £lO a week to include
work done on Sundays and holidays.
He was sure that if Mr. Holloway and
Mr. Davis considered the history as-
sociated with this matter they would
not persist with the motion.
The motion was withdrawn.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution


is submitted by Isis Downs: “That
cooks be paid ss. extra per day if
camp ovens are used.”
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) informed delegates that the
Workers’ Accommodation Amend-
ment Bill piloted through Parliament
last session by the Minister for
Labour and Industry (Hon. M. P.
Hynes) provided that the employers
should provide proper ranges, stoves,
and cooking facilities.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution
was submitted by the Burragunda
Shed; “That where a cook proves un-
satisfactory and is discharged by em-
ployers, that shearers have not to
pay for lost time and travelling ex-
penses for cooks, as they are first
employed by the employers to eat the
food cooked by them.”
Mr. Holloway explained that
shearers could not be charged more
than 10s. a week.
The Branch President: In accord-
ance with a ruling secured from the
Court.
Crutching
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved: “That the Branch
Secretary be authorised to make ap-
plication to the Court for a provi-
sion that all crutching be done on a
weekly wage.”
It was impracticable to fix a piece-
work rate that could be of general
application to all sheds. Crutching
was generally regarded as shearing
between the legs, up the back legs
and on the lower part near the tail.
Very often sheep that were badly
struck required a considerable amount
of shearing, amounting in some cases
to one-third, and a universal flat rate
could not be fixed. It would be fair
and consistent with union policy to
ask the Court to fix a weekly rate
so that men would be paid according
to the time engaged on the w T ork, ir-
respective of the condition of the
sheep. Delegates should leave it to
him in consultation with some of the
pastoral representatives to arrive at
a reasonable weekly rate.
Mr. Davis, who seconded the
motion, said that shearers who were
called upon to shear badly blown
sheep had to follow the maggot
wherever it was, and in some cases,
it was necessary to shear one-third
of the sheep.
The motion was carried.
Pressers
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution
was submitted by Warenda shed:
“That wool pressers be paid gross
weight for all wool pressed.”
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that that had been
asked for in the last two or three
claims.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That the
pressing rates for Koertz Pressers be
made higher than Ferrier Pressers.
At one time all work done other
than in Ferrier Presses was paid for
at a higher rate, and the claim in
connection with the Koertz Press was
justified.
Mr. Thompson seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That scour-
ed rates be paid to pressers for wool
treated by the Woolwiller machine.
This machine removed a consider-
able quantity of dust and vegetable
matter, and although the wool was
not as light as scoured wool it was
lighter than wool in its natural state.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Davis moved: “That where six
or more shearers are employed the
presser shall not be allowed to pen up
sheep.”
It w 7 as becoming a practice in the
industry for pressers to pen up and
to press the wool after the work
ceased. This enabled the owner or con-
tractor to dispense with the services
of one shed hand simpiV by giving
the presser his food.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) asked if that meant that the
presser did the penning up during
working hours and worked overtime
to catch up on his own work, and Mr.
Davis said that it was so.
The Branch Secretary: The Court
would not stand for that, and par-
ticulars concerning definite cases
should have been brought forward.
Mr. Holloway seconded the motion,
which was carried.


Combs and Cutters
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution
was submitted by Homebush shed:
■“That three-pence per hundred comb
and cutter allowance be allowed for
crutching, and Is. per 100 for shear-
ing.”
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that there was an appli-
cation before the Court for a crutch-
ing allowance.
Pares
Mr. Holloway moved: “That ‘rail-
way station’ be properly defined for
the purpose of assessing fares to
sheds and that no stopping place be
designated a railway station unless
accommodation is procurable.”
. There were places between Charle-
ville and Cunnamulla where trains
stopped to pick up or set down a mail
bag or pick up trucks of wool, but
these were regarded as the nearest
railway station. In some cases trains
did not pass more than once or twice
a week. There was no accommoda-
tion there and no means of convey-
ance to the sheep station. According
to the award members were allowed
fares from the nearest railway sta-
tion or place of abode; but men pro-
ceeding from Bollon to a shed six
miles beyond Cunnamulla had to take
a conveyance for 130 miles, but were
paid for only six miles because Cun-
namulla was the nearest station to
the shed.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That the
word ‘destitute’ be deleted from the
form when making application for
reduced fares to sheds, as we con-
sider the term degrading.”
The term was an offensive one, and
a more fitting one should be substi-
tuted.
Mr. O’Shea seconded the motion,
which was carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution is
submitted by Solferino shed: “That
no employee be allowed to travel on
the employer’s conveyance to and
from sheds, and that union officials
prosecute in the case of any breach
of this clause.”
Mr. Carpendale had moved a simila*
resolution at Convention held l as t
year, and it should have been given
effect to.
Mr. Davis said that it had never
been included in the subject of fineg
in the Convention’s report.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That Clause
13 of the Shearing Industry Award
relating to fares should be amended
to read: ‘All employees shall be al-
lowed fares one way only from the
nearest railway station, or from the
place of last employment, or fro®
their last place of abode, whichever
is the nearest practicable route.”
Mr. Davis seconded the motion.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that if Mr. Hollaway
knew of cases where employers had
not paid fares in respect of the near-
est practicable route he should have
submitted them to his secretary. H e
was convinced that the Court would
decide that the employers should pay
fares over the nearest practicable
route. On the last occasion that they
were before the Court they had cited
the case where men had to travel a
V-shaped route, which was actually
longer than in a direct line to the
job. The Court amended the clause
to provide that fares should be paid
over the shortest practicable route.
Even if the clause was not amended
as suggested the cases mentioned by
Mr. Holloway should be tested in the
Court, when he had no doubt that
the Court would hold that the men
were entitled to be paid fares in re-
spect to the nearest practicable route.
The motion was carried.
Mr. Davis moved: “That where we
utilise the railway as a means of
transport to the sheds, fares as
charged by the railway be allowed as
is allowed when other means of trans-
port are utilised. (A limit of 300
miles be allowed.)” There should be
some concession in fares when the
railways were used. It was wrong
to think that the railways were used
at no expense to the workers. In
many cases men shearing in the
Hughenden. Cloncurry. and Richmond
districts were transferred to the
Charleville and Cunnamulla district,
hundreds of miles away, and not to
the nearest adjacent shed. They
were entitled to some concession when
they used the railways as a means
of transport.
Mr. Thompson seconded the mo-
tion, and it was carried.


Maggoty Sheep
Mr. Thompson moved: “That any
station that drafts otf maggoty sheep
be compelled to pay crutching rates
in addition to shearing.” Sometimes
a station drafted off 1000 to 1500 of
these sheep and shearers were en-
titled to extra payment for shearing
them.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) pointed out that the meeting
had already decided that an applica-
tion be made to the Court for a
weekly rate for crutching.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon moved: “That the resolution
be referred to the Branch Secretary
and the pastoral representatives on
the Branch Executive to draft a suit-
able clause to cover the position.”
The matter was -too important to be
dealt with hastily. When the Court
fixed the rate for shearing it had in
mind the shearing of ordinary sheep,
but the men should be compensated
for the objectionable feature associa-
ted with the shearing- of maggoty
sheep. The matter required mature
consideration, and members could rest
assured that their officials would pro-
tect their interests.
It was agreed that the matter be
referred to the Branch Secretary and
the pastoral representatives.
Mr. Davis moved; “That all scabby-
mouthed sheep be disallowed to enter
the shed.” That was done now.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) asked under what author-
ity the inspection was made now.
Mr. Davis said the Inspector of
Stock.
The Branch Secretary asked was
there any penalty if that was not
done.
Mr. Davis said that the matter was
causing grave concern in his dis-
trict because it was believed that the
disease was conveyed to the men.
They had received considerable help
from the Department of Agriculture
and Stock but much delay had oc-
curred. However, the Branch Secre-
tary. in conjunction with the Minis-
ter for Agriculture and Mr. Devries,
had done everything possible to help
them. The local Inspector of Stock
had been placed at their disposal and
whenever an outbreak occurred now
it was incumbent upon the owner
or the manager to notify the inspector
immediately. The difficulty had been
overcome to some extent by the good
services of the Branch Secretary, the
Minister, and Mr. Devries.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that the matter had
given considerable concern in the wes-
tern districts to the officials of the
union and the Department. The
disease was an unpleasant one and
the view was held that one member
had died in the Barcaldine district
as the result of it. The obligation
to notify the Inspector of Stock
might provide some measure of pro-
tection, but there should be some-
thing in the award setting out the
rights of the employer, contractor,
and wage earner and the penalties
for failure to prevent the penning of
such sheep. He therefore, moved:
“That no sheep suffering from scaly
or scabby mouth be penned for
shearing until such time as they had
been passed as fit for shearing by the
Stock Inspector.”
The opinion was held, rightly or
wrongly, that the sheep were a
menace to their members; the prob-
lem was responsible for a good deal
of expense, and he was sure that the
Court would include an appropriate
clause in the award.
Mr. Davis withdrew his motion.
The amendment became the motion,
and was carried.
Mr. Thompson moved: “That all
cancerous sheep be drafted off at first
drafting and disposed of.”
The provision was already con-
tained in the award, but some of. the
employers persisted in sending in such
sheep on the off chance that they
would be shorn before the shearers
realised that they were diseased. The
sheep should be raddled on the nose
and destroyed.
Mr. Holloway seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Accommodation
Mr. O’Shea moved: “That grass,
straw, and chaff be abolished and
fibre mattresses in their stead. We
wish to point out that the bale straw
that is supplied in many cases is un-
recognisable from chaff.”
Mr. Davis said the present filling,
such as straw, grass, and hay, while
clean in itself, was often full of
burrs and other vegetable matter and
generally not suitable as bedding
material. In some cases it was un


hygienic, consisting of old straw that
had been stored for years. Employers
refused to allow the employees to de-
stroy the filling on the termination
of their engagement.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that he hated to oppose
the motion, but he reminded dele-
gates that when he moved a similar
motion at Convention on one occa-
sion it was defeated. Very convinc-
ing arguments had been adduced in
opposition to it. He disliked saying
that some of the pastoral workers
were not the types that perhaps they
all should like in attending to the
cleanliness of their beds. He did not
wish to reflect upon them. Unless
fibre mattresses were changed every
year they were liable to get into a
condition in which they could not be
used. Very often they were stored
for a year and were not always com-
fortable.
Mr. Davis had admitted that the
filling was clean but contained foreign
vegetable matter that rendered it un-
suitable. He feared they were ar-
riving at a time when the men ex-
pected someone else to do every little
tin-pot thing for them. If men were
prepared to accept unhygienic condi-
tions, such as those mentioned by Mr.
Davis, instead of advocating some-
thing better, they deserved the treat-
ment meted out to them. At
the Convention he was convinced
that the opponents of the motion
were right, and he was still of
that.opinion. He hoped the motion
would be defeated, not because he ob-
jected to the men having comfort-
able beds. He wanted them to have
good conditions. It might not be an
unmixed blessing, and in any case it
was an easy matter for the men to
protect themselves. It might be
claimed that they would be victim-
ised, but if they were always going
to advance that plea the time would
arrive when they would not do any-
thing at all for themselves and would
leave it to the officials to attend to
every little tin-pot matter on their
behalf. They should at least have
guts enough to insist on getting
suitable beds.
Mr. Hay moved the following
amendment: That mattresses or
appropriately sized ticks consisting
of suitable dry grass, straw, kapok,
or fibre be supplied, also suitable
calico coverings be supplied and kept
clean by the employer.”
It was his experience in the sugar
industry that it was difficult to keep
the ticks clean, especially when men
were employed cutting burnt cane.
They insisted on getting calico cov-
erings to pull over the mattresses,
and a clean one was supplied each
week. That overcame the difficulty
to a large extent, and it might mini-
mise the trouble in the present ease.
Mr. O’Gorman seconded the amend-
ment.
Mr. O’Shea pointed out that if men
objected to the bedding in far-flung
parts of the State operations may be
held up for, say, a fortnight. How-
ever, he supported the amendment.
The amendment was carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. G.
Lament): The next resolution is sub-
mitted by Solferino shed: “That all
buildings wherein food is stored,
cooked, and for consumption be made
fly-proof.”
That provision was contained in
the recent amendment of the Work-
ers’ Accommodation Act.
The following resolution is also
submitted from Solferino shed: “That
all lavatories be made fly-proof.”
That provision is also included in
the amendment of the Act.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That tables
be put in each room of the accommo-
dation for the use of the men.”
That -was provided in N.S.W.
Mr. Thompson seconded the motion,
and it was carried.
Mr. Holloway moved; “That car-,
bide lamps be supplied in shearers’
and shed hands’ huts instead of kero-
sene lights.”
, It was the only satisfactory lamp
for reading purposes.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion,
which was carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution is
submitted by Dundoo station: “That
proper and sufficient utensils and all
necessaries be supplied for cook, and
that no cook carry his own.”
That is already provided in the
award.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That a re.,
frigerator be supplied during shear-
ing operations.”


It was only fair that refrigerators
should be supplied during the heat
of summer in tropical and sub-tropi-
cal areas.
Griffiths Bros., of Toowoomba, had
informed him that they had already
supplied a refrigerator in one hut,
and he was also informed that it was
their intention to supply them in
other cases, even to outlying boun-
dary riders. Where 40 or 50 men
were employed it was impossible
otherwise to keep food in a proper
condition for any length of time.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion,
which was carried.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) asked how it was proposed
to give effect to the resolution.
Conference adjourned to 10 a.m.
the following day.
THIRD DAY
Wednesday January 19, 1938
Delegates present as on previous
day.
The minutes and the official report
of the previous day’s sitting' were
adopted.
Address by Premier
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) extended a hearty welcome
to the Premier, Hon. W. Porgan
Smith, who had attended Delegate
Meeting in order to address them.
The Premier (Hon. W. Forgan
Smith) who was given a rousing re-
ception, said:
Mr. President and fellow members
of the A.W.U. I regard it as a plea-
sure to be here this morning to ad-
dress your meeting. You have
gathered together to work out a
policy for our union, and I feel sure
that as the result of your delibera-
tions its cause will be advanced to
the advantage of our fellow members.
We are living in a period in which
the case for Labor requires to be
stated and re-stated on every pos-
sible occasion. (Hear, hear!)
I sometimes feel that we are in-
clined to overlook the fact that each
year new workers enter the industrial
field seeking a livelihood and that at
each election there are new voters en-
titled to decide who should be the
Government of Queensland. We
sometimes take it as a matter of
course that all those young men and
women understand the case for
Labor as we do, but unfortunately
that is not always so. Conditions
change and we have to adapt our
methods and policy to those new con-
ditions, but internally the basic prin-
ciples of Labor remain the same.
(Hear, hear!) It is necessary on
every possible occasion to re-state the
basic case for Labor so that men and
women coming into our midst will
know the struggle that has been made
in the past and the success that has
been achieved by the industrial and
political movement and so themselves
be induced to share in the important
privilege of doing work for our cause.
(Hear, hear!)
Death of Jack Fallon
I wish to take this opportunity to
express my sincere sympathy with
your Branch Secretary in his recent
sad bereavement and irreparable
loss. I have had the privilege, more
than most, of knowing the young
man. I knew him as a little boy and
I watched him grow into fine, virile
manhood. He belonged to the type
that Australia could ill afford to lose.
I remember the very interesting con-
versation that I had with him in Mel-
bourne when he called on me when I
was there on one occasion. Conse-
quently I express my sincerest sym-
pathy with the Branch Secretary, his
wife, and other members of the family
in their irreparable loss. Young Jack
Fallon had the attributes of a man
and it is a thousand pities that his
services are lost to his generation.
I also know that you, very pro-
perly, have carried a resolution ask-
ing for an open inquiry into the acci-
dent. I supported that request by a
communication to the Commonwealth
Government, but all those requests
have been turned down. The reason
is not far to seek. The chief reason
is that the Lyons Government neg-
lected their duty towards the defence
of Australia during the last six years.
They raised it again as a political
stunt during the recent Federal elec-
tions. If an open inquiry were held
now the imposture of such a Tory
Government would be exposed naked
and clear to all the citizens of Aus-
tralia. That is the reason why a pub-
lic inquiry has not been approved.
Another reason, of course, is the at-
titude of the official mind. I have had
a long experience of the official mind.


If any errors of judgment, or mis-
takes, are made in administration by
the “tall poppies” who regard them-
selves as superior to governments,
then everybody closes in and no in-
formation is given to the general pub-
lic, and where there is a weak Minis-
ter who does not know his job he
thinks he must be loyal to his de-
partmental officers and bark in uni-
son with them.
The Need for Continual
Vigilance
If the Ministry were strong and
knew their job and were fired with
the zeal to do it properly, they would
see to it that first of all members of
the staff were loyal to the adminis-
tration of the Government and the
people. The facts as we know them
point to the truth of what I have
just said. They all point to the need
for continual vigilance in political
and industrial affairs. It is a pathetic
thing to think that a Nationalist Gov-
ernment have been in power for so
many years in the Commonwealth of
Australia. We must find the causes
for that. We must preach the gos-
pel of Labor and show the public
that we at least know where we want
to go ourselves. If we present that
■case unceasingly with solidarity and
unity, Labor can never be defeated.
(Hear, hear!)
I congratulate your union on the
work that it has done during the past
year and the years that have gone.
I am very pleased that you are pub-
lishing the history of the union in
“The Worker.” Nothing better could
he done, because if present-day his-
torians desired to present a picture
of the social and economic develop-
ment of our Commonwealth they
would find it very largely in the ar-
chives of the Australian Workers’
Union. Our Constitution is so fram-
ed as to provide for all the needs of
industrial organisation, and our
methods and policy are justified by
the successes that have flowed there-
from. Consequently I wish you
every continued success in the work
that you are called upon to do. Our
union has always very properly been
associated with the political life of
this and other States, and anyone
who regards political action as being
of no account does not understand
fhe case for Labor. They are, in
reality, advocating that you and I
and the rest of us should propel our-
selves with one leg. A union move-
ment that deals only union
affairs is retarded and handicapped
in the same way as a man with one
leg. When you have a close associa-
tion with and take part in the poli-
tical unions that exist at the present
time you are possessed of all your
limbs and all your faculties and can
proceed much more rapidly towards
your objective.
No Need to Apologise
On behalf of my colleagues in the
Cabinet and in the party, I desire to
thank all the union officials, the reps.,
and the workers for the undivided
support that they have given the
Labor Government at all times. I
am not here, nor do I go anywhere
throughout the country, to attempt to
apologise for the Labor Government.
(Hear, hear!) That would be neither
justified nor necessary, because one
of our slogans at the next elections
will obviously be: “What Labor has
promised, Labor has done.” (Hear,
hear!)
You men in the field in the various
parts of the State can carry that
message throughout the length and
breadth of the country. You can re-
mind the people of the 1929-32 Moore
blight; you can recall how they cut
their wages, increased their hours,
and industrially outlawed large sec-
tions of your members. You can re-
call the record unemployment, record
trade depression, and record bank-
ruptcies in business and in the affairs
of the man on the land.
It is worth while reminding the
people of those things because what
happened in the past because they,
were apathetic can happen again if
they are not alive to their responsi-
bilities. Our opponents are harness-
ing up for the next elections; but, so
difficult is their task, so barren their
programme, and so bereft of ideas
are they that they are wandering up
lanes and down back alleyways—
even digging into the cess-pits of the
past—to find a case against Labor.
They are tottering forth in “The
Telegraph” and “The Courier-Mail”
as an expert, one who was regarded
as their financial critic and “white
hope” in the State House a few years


ago. They are putting him forward
as a financial and economic cri-
tic. That gentleman made a
mistake of £60,000,000 in calculat-
ing the Commonwealth Public Works
expenditure prior to the last elec-
tions; but, of course, a mistake
of a mere £60,000,000 by a Tory
critic is nothing to them! And, of
course, one who lumps together the
earnings of the tramways, electric
authorities, water authorities, and
such services, and puts that sum for-
ward as being the result of taxa-
tion, cannot De taken seriously in
political affairs. He may get away
with that round some of the silos in
the distant parts of the Darling
Downs, but it will not go down with
people who understand the position
elsewhere.
What Labor Promised
I want to remind yqu, and through
you the people of Queensland, that in
1932 and onwards we promised to stop
the rot brought about by the Moore-
Maher Government, and we did so.
Labor promised to restore wages
and allow all workers the right to go
to the Industrial Court untrammelled.
That we have done.
Labor promised to reduce the hours
of labour, and we have done that.
Labor promised to improve busi-
ness and to improve the conditions of
the man on the land. We have done
so.
Labor promised to create new ave-
nues of employment, and we have
achieved that also.
Labor’s record is one of perform-
ance. Labor embarked upon a vigor-
ous public works policy, a vigorous
building revival policy, water and
sewerage schemes, water conserva-
tion projects, flood prevention under-
takings.
Labor turned its attention to juve-
nile employment and to the construc-
tion of main roads.
During our period in office, extend-
ing over 5i years, we have spent
£18,000,000 on real development in
this our heritage—this State of
Queensland. Of that amount 64 per
cent was spent on the creation of as-
sets that will increase in value as the
years go on. The other 36 per cent
was spent in the improvement and in
the creation of new services gener-
ally.
In carrying out that policy we have
provided more work. Over that
period of 5i years we have increased
the number of wages and salary-
earners by no less than 42,250—that
is, men in remunerative employment
on real jobs. The employment in
shops and warehouses increased by
34 per cent, and the employment in
factories by 36 per cent.
Splendid Economic Position
The recent issue of “Economic
News’ said:
“Employment is at the highest
level ever recorded in the State.”
(Hear, hear!) In other words, there
are more men and women and young
people in receipt of real wages in
the State of Queensland to-day than
at any time before in the history of
our beloved State. (Applause.)
Mr. Colin Clark, who is regarded
as one of the greatest living authori-
ties on economics and statistics, and
who is at present in Australia, was
asked by the Melbourne and Sydney
Universities to analyse the economic
position of this State, and in the
course of a public address here he
said that the productivity of Queens-
land was the highest per head of the
population of any country in the
world, with the possible exception of
California, where they reap huge pro-
fits from the picture industry. The
productivity per head was the highest
in Queensland, and probably the high-
est in the world with the exception
of California. That is something in
the nature of an unsolicited testimony
by one of the greatest living authori-
ties on economics and statistics in
the British Empire to-day.
The recent Christmas business in
Queensland was a record. Several
business men in this city whom I met
prior to Christmas told me that three
days before Christmas—they had still
three days to go—their sales had ex-
ceeded those of the previous year,
which in itself was also a record.
Those things, friends, are proof, if
proof_ is needed, that the promises
contained in my two policy speeches
have been carried out to the fullest
possible extent, and that Labor at
5 . t™ 63 . loyal to its promise and
faithful to its trust. We are some-
times criticised on the details of our
policy. Some people ar e so arrogant
that they assume that they have the


right to all the benefits of increased
spending power which flows finally
to them and their colleagues without
assuming corresponding responsi-
bilities.
Well Balanced Economy
Our policy is one of balanced eco-
nomy. We have increased the spend-
ing power of the community, and we
have placed it in the hands of the
people who own it. There is no other
just way. Carlyle, one of the great-
est philsophers and thinkers the
world ever produced, said that there
were but two ways of getting a live-
lihood, one was by working and the
other by stealing. On reflection I
feel that that is as true to-day as
when he wrote it. By “work” he
meant all those who were engaged
in useful effort, whether by hand or
brain, or both. Anybody who does
not come within that category can
elect themselves to the other. You
and I at least can claim to represent
those who come in the category of
those who work and give service to
their fellow man.
Vision is needed in Australian poli-
tics to-day. We should have a long-
range policy. The present financial
policy in Australia is reactionary. I
have continued to advocate for many
years a long-range policy in refer-
ence to finance. At the present time,
due largely to the lack of mental
virility, shall I say, in the Govern-
ment of the Commonwealth we are
living financially from hand to
mouth.
The Loan Council could be made the
supreme . economic and financial
authority of Australia. It has never
been that. Its conferences are called
in a hurried fashion and business is
disposed of in an atmosphere of
haste. No long-range policy has ever
been considered or accepted by that
body and the result is that govern-
ments and semi-governmental
authorities cannot be sure when plan-
ning ahead that their projects will be
properly financed and so sometimes
there is unemployment and added cost
in the development of the State.
The Basis of Our Wealth
I claim that the Loan Council —so-
called—should become an economic
council. Its duty should be the mobi-
lisation of all the resources of Aus-
tralia and their effective utilisation in
the development of our country and
in providing the needs of our people.
After all, that is the basis of ou r
wealth —the natural resources of the
country, its land, its minerals, it s
timber, its capacity to grow crops
and other things that are necessary
for human well-being. So that all
wealth is the result of labour and
human effort intelligently applied to
the natural resources of our country.
If that were done and done property
there need not be and should not be
any undeserved poverty in Australia.
That, gentlemen, is our responsibility
because no one else wants it. It ig
a responsibility that we took on when
we formed the Labor Party or in-
herited the work of those who started
the Movement, those who pioneered
the A.W.U., and those who pioneered
the Labor Movement. That was the
inspiration that they had in mind.
It is our responsibility and our
privilege to carry on that inspira-
tion and work to achieve that objec-
tive. I repeat that if the resource#
of this country were scientifically
mobilised and used for and on behalf
of the people of the Commonwealth
there need not be and should not be
any undeserved poverty in the coun-
try. (Hear, hear!) We could build
up a civilisation here under the
Southern Cross greater than the
world has ever known provided we
are brave enough, big enough, and
good enough to do it.
Attend to Your Own Business
That is our historic mission to the
people of this country, and every ef-
fort that we make either as a union
or as a political movement should be
set in that direction. The citadel of
our opponents is the control of those
resources. We are kept aloof from
that machinery. They are the things
that that citadel contains. After all
is said and done, we are only asking
the people of our country’ to attend
to their own business. It is our busi-
ness, the business of the people, to
develop this country, and it is their
business to see to it that they get the
full product of their labour. That,
summed up in a few words, is the
case for Labor. (Hear, hear!) Yet
we get all kinds of hocus-pocus from
every point of the compass seeking
to indicate that the control of finance


is one of those finely balanced activi-
ties that cannot be managed by any-
body but experts who nominate what
sections shall have control of the in-
struments of industry, and while they
continue to hold that citadel of the
control of credit resources of our
country poverty and all that it means
will continue to be the lot of a large
proportion of our people. That kind
of propaganda we must expose.
We must dissipate it. We need
only look back to the elections
of 1932 and to the big placards
that said, “Forgan Smith will
dissipate your savings.” “Labor can-
not be trusted with the control of
finance.” “If Smith becomes Premier
he will not be able to get finance to
carry on the policy that he has placed
before the country.”
I was told before the fourth Loan
Council meeting that I would come
back with my tail between my legs
ready to submit lowly and reverently
to those whom God had set in author-
ity over me. That did not happen. I
have never had that experience. The
results were nothing like that, and
so long as we have the assistance
and sympathy of the Movement such
as you represent Labor can never be
defeated.
Labor Knows Not Defeat
Labor has never been defeated. We
may be repulsed from time to time,
■we may suffer reverses, but so long
as the inspiration that I • mentioned
earlier is alive, and so long as there
remains a man in the world ready to
state the case for Labor, even if he
be the last one to state it, our Move-
ment can never be defeated. (Hear,
hear!) The principles of Labor are
the highest that ever animated man-
kind. They represent ambitions that
are good and true and holy. They
affect all the people of our country.
Therefore, it is our duty to preserve
those inspirations, to see that others
are kindled, and that we work stead-
ily towards our objective. We will
never be content until all undeserved
poverty is banished from our land
and all men, women, and children are
free and properly cared for.
Efforts will be made between now
and the elections to divide the people
on the case for Labor. Everything
that a fiendish and a malicious in-
genuity can devise will be used
against Labor, but we will go to the
country stating Labor’s case and no
other. (Hear, hear!) We w m not

where all affiliated unions and

principles and our policy, and we will
not deviate from it in any way what-
soever. J
The case for Labor is one that can
be supported by all decent thoughtful

When it wa s announced in North
Queensland that the Premier would
visit Cairns the whole city was agog


with excitement for days before his
arrival. The Premier visited the
Tableland, carrying the message of
Labor, and they ail knew the result
of it in the record majority in
the Kennedy electorate. No small
measure of credit was due to the
Premier for that. Even the opponents
of Labor recognised that Labor was
fortunate indeed in haying as their
leader a man of the calibre and witn
the outstanding ability of the present
Premier. Unanimity had, prevailed
throughout his leadership. He was
able, courageous, and determined to
do what was right by the people as
a whole. He congratulated the Pre-
mier on the celebration of his silver
wedding, and he knew that it was the
earnest hope that both the Premier
and his wife would be spared to cele-
brate their golden wedding. There
was no doubt that during the years
to come the Premier would continue
his earnest endeavours to advance
the Movement and to improve the
social and economic position of the
people. (Applause.)
Mr. Hay said that it was with ex-
treme pleasure that he seconded the
motion. Mr. Bushnell had referred to
the splendid services rendered by the
Premier in the Kennedy electorate,
but credit should also be given to the
Premier for the inspiring address
that he delivered over the air to the
Herbert electors when in Townsville.
He was pleased that the Premier
had made reference to the fact that
an open inquiry should be demanded
into the death of the late Jack Fal-
lon. He had dealt very trenchantly
with the subject of the Air Force
when he was in the North. To-day he
had mentioned many things that
Labor had done, but he had only
touched on the fringe of them. There
were many other social advantages
that Labor had bestowed upon the
people. For instance, benefits had
been conferred under the Workers’
Compensation Act. Following repre-
sentations made at Delegate Meetinf
and in other quarters, the Act had
been amended to confer benefits on
the toilers in the outback parts of
the State, in the mineral fields, cane-
fields, and elsewhere. The canecutters
in the Ingham district were faced
with the menace of Weil’s disease,
but following the activities of the or-
ganisation in its representations to
the Premier the Act was again
amended, and further benefits con-
ferred on the workers.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon): Do not forget that it was
made retrospective. •
Mr Hay said that delegates
would also recall that prior to the-
intervention of the Labor Govern-
ment workers in the far-flung
parts of the State were compelled
to work under unhygienic conditions.
Many of those matters had since been
adjusted with consequential advan-
tage to the workers generally. The-
Premier was right when he said that,
they should continually remind the
young electors of what Labor had
done and what the Tory Government .
had done. He had a very vivid re-
collection of what the Tory Govern-
ment did when Labor was defeated
in 1929. Prior to that date main
road and railway camps were operat-
ing and men were enjoying award
rates and conditions, but in less than
six months after the defeat of Labor
those camps were no more, but in
their places were camps of men who
received only 10s. a day and for only-
four days of the week. The men were
glad to get the jobs. When the Pre-
mier faced the electors again in 1932:
he said that those things would dis-
appear, and within six months of his
return to power the old main road
and railway camps reappeared and
once more the men enjoyed award
rates and conditions. The Labor-
Government also amended the Indus-
trial Arbitration Act with benefit to-
the workers. He could go on citing
no end of cases where Labor had im-
proved the lot of the workers until
their position to-day was much better
than in 1929-1932. He trusted that
after the policy had been decided at
the Mackay Convention it would be-
broadcast throughout the State be-
cause he was sure that it would be
of benefit to the people generally and
that inevitably it would result in the
return of Labor in 1938. (Applause.)
The motion was carried with ac-
clamation.
The Premier (Hon. W. Forgan-
Smith) in reply, said:
Mr. Chairman and friends, I thank
you very sincerely for the way in
which you have carried the vote of
thanks. I also thank the mover and
seconder for their felicitations. I re-
gard it as a privilege to have the op-
portunity of addressing this gather-
ing. During the most difficult period
in the history of Labor in Queens


land we have maintained our solidar-
ity to a greater extent than has been
the case in other parts of Australia.
That is due to the close co-operation
between the industrial unions and the
Labor Party when in power or other-
wise. We co-operate in our activi-
ties and get to know one another bet-
ter than if we were compelled to
travel in our own respective spheres.
That is the reason why Labor in
Queensland up to the present has al-
ways been able to show a united
front._ There has always been under-
standing and that is the basis of
solidarity. In addition, there is fel-
lowship. Where we have those two
things working actively together
Labor must always be strong, virile,
and competent to carry out its his-
toric mission. I wish you and your
conference and your conference im-
mediately to follow in Sydney every
success and that as the result of
your labours greater progress will be
made in your union and in the Com-
monwealth generally. Your union,
like the political Labor Party, is be-
ing attacked at the present time, and
that attack is coming from many
and varied powerful interests in
order to destroy, not to help, not to
build up, not to strengthen. The at-
tack that is made on the A.W.U. is
for the purpose of destruction. They
desire to destroy the union that
pioneered the industrial movement in
Australia and has at all times stood
four-square for those things that were
possible and right. We must stand
at all times with our feet firmly
planted on the ground and set out
steadily, definitely, and unhesitatingly
on the road that we have decided to
travel. We cannot jump with the
agility of a flea from point to point.
If we try to do that we will achieve
nothing. Above all, we must keep
our heads clear and in that way we
shall be able to devise a policy that
is immediately practicable and will
giye results. Again I thank you and
wish you every continued success.
(Applause.)
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamant): The following resolution
was submitted by Humeburn Shed:
that owing to the proximity of sheep
yards where fly-blown and cancerous
sheep may be held and imperfectly
protected sanitary buildings a ii
mg rooms, kitchens, and pfaces where'
food is kept or handled, be made
proof.” That is provided C m tie
recent amendment of the Workers®
Accommodation Act.
Mr. O’Shea moved: “That men’s
sleeping, quarters be used for nothing
but sleeping quarters.” On the Dar-
ling Downs many shearers’ huts were
U ™ storln g wheat and fertiliser.
™, r - T “ om Pfon seconded the motion,
ihe Branch President (Mr. J C
Lament) said he did not think that
the Court would approve of the sug-
gestion that the huts should be closed
w U- 1 ? 01 !? 8 the year - He did
not think that there should be any
serious objection to the storing of
certain things in sleeping quarters,
hides Certam y not fertiliser > skins, or
Mr. O’Shea then moved: “That
mens sleeping quarters at no time be
used for storing goods of an obnoxi-
ous nature.”
Mr Thompson seconded the motion,
but he still thought that sleeping
quarters should not be allowed for
storage purposes at all.
Mr. O’Shea mentioned that the mat-
ter had been brought under the notice
of the inspector, who had said that
he was powerless to act because
shearing operations were not in pro-
gress at the time.
The motion was carried.
Mr. Holloway moved: ‘ “That all
shower rooms at shearing shed ac-
commodation be properly fitted with
doors. On some of the big influen-
tial properties there was no protec-
tion against biting winds.
Mr. Thompson seconded the motion,
which was carried.
. Mr- Holloway moved: “That facili-
ties for hot water be provided in all
sheds for the purpose of bathing and
working.”
Mr. Burns seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Thompson moved: “That where
temporary accommodation is used, all
employees be allowed Is. a day camp-
ing _ allowance.” The object of the
motion was to compel the employer to
provide the accommodation prescribed
by the Act.
Mr. Holloway seconded the motion.
Mr. Bushnell pointed out that under
the Act the inspector was given dis-
cretionary power to decide whether
the owner of the station was in a
financial position to provide perma-
ACCOMMODATION—(Continued)


nent accommodation. He suggested
that perhaps it would be better to
have the Act amended to provide that
all employers be compelled to provide
proper accommodation.
Mr. Holloway said that during
drought conditions there was no alter-
native but to take the shearing ma-
chines to the sheep, and the men
should be paid extra when camping
out under such conditions. Attempts
were made to evade the Act, and in
the circumstances the employees were
entitled to some monetary compen-
sation.
The motion was carried.
On the motion of Mr. Holloway,
seconded by Mr. Dougherty, Resolu-
tion No. 203 was recommitted, and
Mr. Holloway moved: ‘‘That a canvas
cooler be supplied for the use of mess
on stations and at shearing sheds,
and that the Minister in charge of
the Workers’ Accommodation Act be
asked to make provision for same in
the Act.”
Mr. Davis seconded the motion, and
it was carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution
was submitted by Barragunda Shed:
“That all camps be abolished and huts
built.” That is provided in the Act
as it now stands.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That all tin
pints be abolished and delf pints be
placed m their stead,” The rims
round tin and enamel pints were only
repositories for bacteria.
Mr. Thompson seconded the mo-
tion, and it was carried.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That spring
wire stretchers be supplied and all
cyclone stretchers be abolished, ihe
cyclone stretchers were only hori-
zontal gates on four legs, and they
were very uncomfortable. He was
sure that that type of bed was not
contemplated when the Act was
Mr. Davis seconded the motion,
and it was carried.
Mr. Lough moved: “Tb a t rain
water tanks be supplied at all sheds.
Mr. Perrett seconded the motior
Mr. O’Shea moved as an amend-
ment; “That rain tanks be erected at
huts with proper facilities for catch-
ment and sufficient capacity to pro-
vide adequate supply.” In some eases
the water was pumped from _ creeks,
but during a drought period its pur-
ity was doubtful.
Mr. Davis seconded the amendment.
In the artesian belt the water flowed
in drains for miles before it reached
the point of consumption, and it was,
therefore, subject to pollution by
animals. He was sure that it was the
wish of their members that rain-
water tanks should be supplied.
The amendment was carried.
Mr. O’Shea moved: “That all
stands be placed at least six feet
apart, as fatal accidents occur. The
stands as they are now are considered
to be too close.” At some of the
stations the stands were only -4ft.
Sins, apart, and accidents had oc-
curred. Although they were not of a
serious nature, the men were in con-
stant fear of being injured.
Hr. Holloway moved as an amend-
ment that the words “built since.
1907” should be omitted from Clause
17 (b) of the award. The clause
would then read: “The employer shall
provide a minimum space of five feet
for each crutcher or shearer on the
crutching or shearing board in all
sheds.”
Mr. Thompson seconded the amend-
ment.
Mr. Boland said that a similar re-
solution had been passed at last
Delegate Meeting, and he would like
to know from the Branch Secretary
what had been the result of their
efforts.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) explained that at the last
Delegate Meeting it was decided to
confine the application to a restora-
tion of the rate of £2 ss. with pro-
nortinoate increases in other rates.
The papers had been filed on the first
or second day of the last Delegate
Meeting, and there had been no op-
portunity of approaching the Court
since the resolution referred to had
been carried. He thought it would be
wise to stick to the provision for a
minimum space of 5 feet.
The amendment was carried.
Mr. Boland moved: “That the Ac-
commodation Act be more rigidly en-
forced as regards the condition of the
huts on the men’s arrival at sheds.”
The building should be in a fit and
habitable state when the men arrived
on the job.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved as an amendment:
“That in all cases where on arrival
of the men on any job at which em-
ployers are required to provide ac-
commodation it is found that the ac-


G. W. MARTENS
Branch President 1925-1929




commodation is not in conformity
with the Act or the requirements of
the award, the men immediately
notify the secretary of the district
concerned.” He did not know how
they could achieve their end unless
the men took some action themselves.
Mr. Bushnell seconded the amend-
ment, which was carried.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That no
exemption be given re hut building-
accommodation.” Every employer
should be compelled to comply with
the Act.
The motion lapsed.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That butter,
cheese, and green vegetables be sup-
plied all the year round.” At the pre-
sent time, after October 1, the em-
ployer was not under any obligation
to supply butter to the employees,
but he could not understand why the
provision should remain when this
product was readily available in his
district. Mr. Devries had been com-
pelled to prosecute employers for
failure to supply butter during
months that they were under an ob-
ligation to supply it. The fact that
the employers, shearers, and shed
hands could get these items of diet
at any time of the year indicated that
they were easily procurable.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) seconded the motion. Mr.
Devries, who was determined to en-
force compliance with the award,
prosecuted two pastoralists, one of
whom operated in a big way, and in
respect of whom it could not be
claimed that he was not financially
able to provide the commodity. The
fact that it was necessary to lodge
prosecutions to obtain compliance
with the award indicated that there
was urgent need for a ration sche-
dule. If shearers and shed hands
could obtain these articles there was
no insurmountable obstacle in the
way of providing them for all em-
ployees.
The motion was carried.
Senator Collings Welcomed
At this stage the Branch President
(Mr. J. C. Lament) extended a hearty
welcome to Senator Collings and in-
vited him to address Delegate Meet-
ing.
Senator Collings, who was received
with applause, said that he appreci-
ated the wonderful work of the or-
ganisation and recalled the first time
that he delivered an address as a
political organiser in a shearing shed.
At Longreach he had his first experi-
ence of a boss inquiring from a union
secretary whether the men who were
to work on his property had the
necessary union credentials. He did
not do this out of philanthropic mo-
tives, but because he understood
thoroughly that if they were not in
order there would be trouble on the
job. On his return he was prompted
to write the article, “My First Shed,”
and that set out the sentiments that
he had held after his visit.
A.W.U’s Nation-wide Influence
He was satisfied that wherever one
went in Queensland, or in fact,
throughout Australia, one never lost
contact with the A.W.U. There was
no part of Queensland where a work-
er could not have his grievance ad-
justed by getting in touch with the
A.W.U. On behalf of his colleagues,
Senator Gordon Brown and Senator
Ben Courtice, he desired to thank
them for their assistance, financial
and otherwise, during the last Federal
election campaign. While he regretted
that they had lost a noble stalwart
in Senator MacDonald, they were
fortunate in securing a man of the
high calibre of Ben Courtice. He
thanked each and every delegate for
the splendid work they had done in
their respective districts.
Open Inquiry in Air Matters Would
Mean Startling Disclosures
He had not been idle in demanding
an open inquiry into the death of
Jack Fallon and, while he did not
take defeat quietly, he felt that it
was very doubtful whether they
would be successful in this connec-
tion. He was sure that if an open
inquiry was held, that there would be
startling disclosures. He had writ-
ten to Mr. Thorby, Minister for De-
fence, asking that due recognition
should be given to public opinion on
the matter.
Federal Government’s Shocking
Failure in Defence
Defence matters in Australia were
in a disgraceful position. Labor
was always being twitted with hav-
ing no defence policy and with being
a disloyal party, but he had made no
secret of the state of affairs regard-
ing defence. The last thing that the


present Federal Government were
interested in was the defence of Aus-
tralia. In every large city of the
Commonwealth all the oil storage
tanks were constructed in the full
view of everybody and painted with
aluminium paint. They were an easy
mark for any enemy ’plane. The
Government that alleged that they
were so concerned with the defence
policy, and twitted the Labor Party
with having no policy, had not enough
horse-sense to camouflage the oil
stores that were so vital in times of
national emergency.
Politicians’ Duty to the Movement
He asked them to remember that,
although elected to Parliament, he
and his colleagues were just as much
servants of the Movement to-day as
when they were paid organisers. The
people were prone to sneer at poli-
ticians because they did not under-
stand the work that they had to do.
He reminded them that the politicians
were associated with every act con-
cerning their welfare.
He warned them that if a 40-hour
week was confined to Queensland
alone some of the big manufacturing
companies would immediately move
to the Southern States. At the last
elections the workers were given an
opportunity to say whether they
wanted a 40-hour week, and by their
vote they virtually said that they did
not. The Movement and the Labor
politicians were doing their jobs, and
the worker should be told that the
only obstacle in the way of the solu-
tion of the problem of unemployment
at the present time was the apathy
of the toiler himself. (Loud ap-
plause.)
Vote of Thanks
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon, in moving a vote of thanks to
Senator Codings, said that the people
of Australia should be grateful to
him for the work that he had done
in their interests. It was pleasing
to know that the man who had done
so much for them was low the lead-
er of the Labor Party in the Senate.
It was also pleasing to know that
he was a Queenslander, and that the
deputy leader of the party in the
House of Representatives was also a
Queenslander. Prior to the last
Federal elections the Labor senators
were few in number, but stout
heart. They were a fine fighting
force. He realised that the position
of senator was a full-time job, but
he often regretted that Senator Col.
lings was not available more often
to carry the message of Labor to the
people as he had done in the earlier
days. He would be a wonderful ex-
ponent of the case for Labor amongst
the young members of the commu-
nity.
Mr. Bushnell, who seconded the
motion, said that there was no part
of Queensland where Senator Codings
was not wed and favourably known.
His record of achievement on behalf
of the Labor Movement, had been
blazoned throughout the Common-
wealth. Every supporter of the
Labor Party was watching with in-
terest the outcome of the efforts of
his party in the Senate.
Motion carried with acclamation.'
In thanking delegates for the en-
thusiastic manner in which they had
carried the vote of thanks, Senator
Codings complimented the editor of
“The Worker” and the officials on
checking the activities of the Commu-
nists.
Accommodation (Continued)
Mr. Ivey moved: “That where pull-
up showers are provided they be fit-
ted with wire rope.” Hemp ropes
were liable to break with perhaps
serious results to persons using the
showers.
Mr. Bushnell seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Miscellaneous (Pastoral)
Mr. Thompson moved: “That all
shearers be supplied with gloves and
shed hands with skin gloves for
handling maggoty wool.” The re-
quest was a reasonable one.
Mr. Holloway seconded the motion,
which was carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution
was submitted by Emmet Downs:
“That this meeting views with indig-
nation the rise given us by the re-
cent Court. We urge the A.W.U. to
apply immediately for a further rise
for all employees in the pastoral in-
dustry.” That claim has been filed.
The following resolution was sub-
mitted from Claverton Station: “That


in all sheds where seedy and burry
sheep are to be shorn gloves and
basils be found by the employer.”
That will be included in the claim
before the Court.
Station Hands’ Award
Mr. Holloway moved: “That station
hands be paid overtime rates for all
Sunday work without the employer’s
option of giving day in lieu of same.”
Although the award provided that the
employee should be given a day in
lieu on a day mutually arranged be-
tween the employer and employee it
was generally decided by the em-
ployer and it W'as generally a slack
day and at a time when it would not
be of any benefit to the employee.
He could not understand why em-
ployees in the rural and pastoral in-
dustry should be treated differently
from those in other callings. It was
really a continuation of the old idea
that people associated w 7 ith the land
should not be treated as favourably
as other workers.
Mr, Dougherty seconded the
motion. He did not think that there
should be any discrimination between
employees in one industry and an-
other in this respect.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved as an amendment:
“That the union use its best endea-
vours to see that station hands be
paid overtime rates for all work done
on Sundays and that they be paid
double time and time and a half as
the case may be for all work done
on statutory holidays.” The award
provided that if men worked on Sun-
day they should be given a day off,
which was to be mutually arranged,
but it was generally a day that suited
the boss, such as a wet day, for in-
stance. Very often when men worked
for 12 months and then claimed a
number of holidays there was the
greatest difficulty in proving that the
days had been actually worked. There
was no machinery to adjust these mat-
ters, but if the amendment was car-
ried the provision would be included
in the application to the Court. He
regretted that very little information
was forthcoming from the pastoral
centres to help him in his advocacy
in the Court, but he invited them to
send along all the information that
they could get.
The motion was withdrawn and the
amendment was carried.
Mr. Davis moved: “That a clause
be inserted in the Station Hands’
Award relating to a week’s notice to-
be given at the termination of em-
ployment by either side.” A similar
provision was contained in other
awards and it should be inserted in
the Station Hands’ Award.
In seconding the motion, Mr.
Dougherty said that the majority of
the members did not understand that
as their engagement was a weekly
one they were bound to give a week’s
notice upon terminating their ser-
vices. It would be a simple matter to
have an appropriate clause in the
award.
The motion was carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution
was submitted by Dundoo station:
“That the station hands be paid the
basic wage plus keep.” That is con-
tained in the application filed in the
Court.
Mr. Holloway moved: “That appli-
cation be made to the Court for a 44-
hour week for station hands.”
At the present time the hours of a
station hand were not regulated, and
it was open to the employer to work
them without limitation. In some
centres married men in close prox-
imity to their home town had not
been able to return home for three
or four months because the employer
considered that at any time their ser-
vices might be required on the sta-
tion. It was high time that the hours
were fixed. At one time the Federal
Court fixed the hours at 52, and even
that would be better than the position
at present prevailing in Queensland.
He had never see. station hands re-
tained in service after noon on Sat-
urday in New r South Wales or Vic-
toria, but in Queensland it was the
practice for them to remain on the
station during every hour of the day.
There were no insuperable difficul-
ties in the way of regulating the
working hours. On Thurrulgoona
station the musterers were not work-
ed beyond noon on Saturday.
Mr. Thompson seconded the motion.
He endorsed the remarks of Mr. Hol-
loway. In his district station hands
worked 12 to 14 hours a day for six
days of the week, and in some in-
stances they were asked to cut their
breakfast and take it out on the run.
The motion was carried.


Mr. Holloway moved: “That where
station employees are asked to work
in wet bore drains they shall be paid
the higher rate in respect of each
day on which they are engaged on
such work.”
The men were not actually working
in the drain itself but were using a
delver to clean it out, but in the pro-
cess they became wet. The employer
contended that as they were not ac-
tually working in the wet bore drain
they were not entitled to the extra
pay.
In seconding the motion, Mr. Davis
said that in following the delver and
shovelling the debris away from the
edge of the drain the men became
covered in mud.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) opposed the motion in its pre-
sent form. He thought that the dif-
ficulty might be overcome by fram-
ing an appropriate definition. He
suggested that the motion should
read: “That it be a recommendation
from Delegate Meeting to the Branch
Secretary that a definition be includ-
ed in the award to provide for men
whose boots and clothing became wet
and/or muddy as the result of work
associated with cleaning out wet bore
drains.” If that was approved an
appropriate claim would be made to
the Court.
Mr. Holloway agreed to the motion
in that form, and it was carried.
Mr. Thompson moved; “When sheep
are burry, gloves be supplied to
lamb markers.”
Mr. Holloway seconded the motion.
The motion was carried.
Butter and Cheese Award
Mr. Brown informed the meeting
that since the resolutions under this
heading had been forwarded for con-
sideration by Delegate Meeting an
award had been issued by the Court
and many of the matters dealt with.
He moved; “That Resolutions 307 to
315 be referred to the Branch Secre-
tary for investigation.
Mr. Dougherty seconded the mo-
tion.
The motion was carried.
Local Authority and Main Roads
Board Award
Mr. Dougherty moved: “That a
clause be inserted in the award to
the effect that all employees engaged
on council or main roads work be
furnished with a statement with each
pay showing rate of pay for each job
worked during that period, also any
reductions during that period.”
The men did not receive any de-
tailed statement showing how their
wages were made up, consequently
much time was spent by the office in
checking up for the men. It would
be a simple matter to give the in-
formation required and especially did
this apply to the deductions.
Mr. Burns, who seconded the
motion, asked that it should apply
also to the Water Supply and Sewer-
age Award. He said that it was the
practice of the contracting firm in
Townsville to pay men at the lowest
possible rate and throw the obliga-
tion upon them to discover whether
they were short-paid or not. Every
week he had to make inquiries to
ascertain whether the men had been
paid at the correct rate. He had even
found it necessary to take the inspec-
tor on to the job and check the books
to see whether the employees were
correctly paid.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) said that evidently the ob-
ject of the motion was to save time
but he warned delegates that perhaps
it would have the reverse effect. Al-
though the men might receive a cer-
tain amount after they had worked
three days in the fortnight at a
higher rate, the pay for the follow-
ing fortnight; when they had worked
four days at the higher rate, might
be less.
Mr. Dougherty said there would be
a mess-up somewhere.
The Branch President said that
there was no mess-up. The in-
creased gross amount for the second
fortnight would attract a higher rate
of relief tax, thus making the net
amount Jess than the previous fort-
night.
Mr. Dougherty explained that the
object of the motion was not to save
time but to prevent a considerable
amount of annoyance and irritation.
Naturally the men were anxious to
know whether they had been paid on
a proper scale.
The motion was carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution
was submitted from the Warrandaroo


Council job: “That Mr. Devries do
what he can regarding- the 40-hour
week at the next Court sitting.”
Mr. Burns: It is in every claim to
the Court.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) said it was not in every
claim nor would it be desirable be-
cause it would lead to considerable
delay. The Court would not consider
the rest of a claim until the standard
hours had been fixed, and they could
be decided only by the Full Bench,
but a Full Bench could not always be
constituted. It may be necessary on
some occasions to deal with urgent
matters.
Mr. Davis moved: “That it also be
asked at the next Court sitting that
the accommodation for two men be a
10 x 12 tent and two 12 x 14 flys.”
The request was a reasonable one.
The men were subject to a consider-
able amount of discomfort, especially
in wet weather, if the tents were not
big enough.
Mr. Dougherty suggested that the
following words should be added:
“And one 8 x 10 tent and two 10 x 12
flys for one man.” Men were con-
tinually complaininng that 6 x 8 fly
was altogether too small. The Main
Roads Commission and the P.E.I.
Branch had supplied extra flys, and
in the case of the P.E.I. tin huts had
been built, but many private contrac-
tors still persisted in providing only
the bare essentials. Delegates knew
that they did not give men the com-
fort that they deserved.
Mr. Brophy was afraid that if the
motion was carried in its present
form they would lose the very thing
that they desired to get. It would
be better to insist upon extra flys.
He moved as an amendment: “That
where tent accommodation is supplied
two flys shall be supplied with each
tent.” He considered that if they
could not obtain bigger tents there
would be a better opportunity of get-
ting extra flys.
Mr. Burns seconded the amend-
ment, which was carried.
Mr. Ivey moved: “That at the
next Court sittings a week’s
notice be inserted in lieu of the
two days’ notice as at present.”
Very often men went on to jobs
with enough provisions for a week
and when they were given two days’
notice it was not always convenient
to make use of the extra provisions.
Some employers were prone to give
notice every time a cloud appeared
in the sky.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) seconded the motion. He ex-
plained to delegates that the Court
had been informed that in many in-
stances the employers refused to em-
ploy the men, particularly in the wet
belts of the North, when they had
to give a week’s notice. Very often
the employers considered it good
business not to employ the labour.
He contended that the volume of em-
ployment had increased since the em-
ployer was relieved of the obligation
to give a week’s pay after the men
had been employed a day or two.
There were good arguments for and
against this proposal.
Mr. Bushnell opposed the motion.
When the period of notice was altered
from a week to two days a consider-
able number of men obtained employ-
ment in the slack season in his dis-
trict even in the wet season, especi-
ally with the Main Roads Commis-
sion and the P.E.I. Branch. Previ-
ously it was the practice to cease
operations just before Christmas and
the men were told not to apply
again until April in the following
year. Since the alteration had been
made work had closed down on 16th
December and it was resumed on 6th
or Bth January. The alteration to
two days brought about increased
employment in his district.
Mr, Dougherty opposed the motion
on somewhat similar grounds. The
employers were now prepared to take
a risk and commence a job immedi-
ately after Christmas. The men were
now in receipt of more work.
Mr. Dufficy supported the motion.
He could not see the logic in the ar-
guments of the delegates who oppos-
ed the motion because if the same
amount of work had to be done the
same number of men had to be en-
gaged.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon): In those cases more work
was found in the slack season.
Mr. Ivey did not wish to do any-
things detrimental to the workers in
the rainy belt, but he thought the
difficulty could be overcome by fixing
a different notice period in certain
latitudes. There had been a consider-
able amount of industrial litigation
since the notice had been reduced to
two days, and he was not at all satis


fied that the employers had suddenly
become more lenient towards the men
since that change had been made.
The motion was lost.
Mr. Burns moved: “That at the
next Court sittings it be asked that
the men be supplied with a wire
stretcher and fibre mattress.” It was
time that the men got past the days
of canvas and wooden stretchers. They
should be provided with something
approaching the comforts of a home.
Road workers had as much right to
expect wire stretchers and fibre mat-
tresses as employees in any other in-
dustry.
Mr. Dougherty seconded the motion,
which was carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont): The following resolution
was submitted from Waugh’s Pocket:
“That the extra grant made in the
award for Northern workers be a
grant free of taxation. This grant is
made owing to the high cost of liv-
ing in North Queensland; and this
meeting considered it grossly unjust
to tax same.” When the Court is
considering the Northern partiy no
opportunity is lost to point out the
disadvantages of the extra taxation,
and that attitude will be maintained
in the future.
Mr. Thompson moved: “That a
twenty-minute smoko both in the
morning and afternoon be inserted
in the Local Authorities’ Award.”
In the district from which the reso-
lution came the temperature during
the last month or eight weeks
hovered between 110 and 112 every
day. Whether the smokos were
granted in the employer’s time or
employee’s time it was only a fair
request it should be included in the
award.
Mr. Ivey seconded the motion.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) pointed out that the motion
did not say that the smokos were
to be taken in the employers’ time,
and he could only assume that the in-
tention of the motion was that ar-
rangements should be made to have
a break between starting time and
lunch time and between lunch time
and ceasing time. There was nothing
in the award to prevent a local ar-
rangement being made whereby the
work would be carried out at certain
times of the day in accordance with
the climatic conditions. There was
the impression abroad that the em-
ployees and the employers were pro-
hibited from making such an ar-
rangement, but that was not so. He
mentioned the matter so that the offi-
cials could make arrangements along
those lines. It was proposed to hold
a conference concerning a job in the
South-western district with a view to
having breaks in the day so that
men who were not so physically fit
as the best could continue on the job.
The idea was to rest during the hot-
ter part of the day and work during
the cooler hours.
The motion was carried.
Distribution of Premier’s Address
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that the Premier had de-
livered one of the finest addresses
that he had ever listened to. It con-
tained a great deal of valuable pro-
paganda, and in the interests of the
Movement he desired to move: “That
the address be published in pamphlet
form and distributed throughout the
State.”
Mr. Bushnell seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Meeting adjourned to 10 a.m. the
following day.
FOURTH DAY
Thursday, January 20, 1938
Delegates present as on previous
day.
The minutes and the official report
of the previous day’s sittings were
adopted.
Local Authority and Main Roads
Board Award—(Continued)
Mr. Lewis moved: “That when
making the next application to the
Industrial Court for a variation of
the Local Authority and Main Roads
Award, the Branch Secretary ask for
an increase in the camping allow-
ance.”
He had purposely refrained from
asking for a specific rate so that
their advocate in Court would have
a free hand in arriving at a fair
amount. He thought that the rail-
way maintenance men received about
3s. 9d. a night when away from
home.
Mr. Ivey, who seconded the motion,
said that the Bridge, Pier, and Wharf
Construction Award provided for Is.


<Bd. a night, and he was of the opinion
that 4d. was a ridiculous amount and
an insult to the men concerned.
The motion was carried.
Mr. Dougherty moved: “That
showers be supplied on all jobs.”
There was a provision in awards
that showers be provided at quarry
works and where storm water sewers
were under construction. He consid-
ered that showers should be provided
on all jobs.
Mr. Burns, in seconding the motion,
said that it should not be impossible
to erect showers at main roads
•camps.
The motion was carried.
Mr. Dougherty moved: “That all
main road work be done by day
labour.”
The Labor Party stood for the day
labour principle, and very often it
was asked why they permitted jobs
to be carried out by contract. In
Mackay two big construction jobs
were completed by day labour at less
than the estimated cost. The con-
tract system gave men an opportu-
nity to try to make money by sweat-
ing the employees, whereas the day
labour system offered a splendid op-
portunity for the improvement of the
conditions of the men.
Mr. Lewis seconded the motion,
and said that the men were not get-
ting a fair deal from contractors,
day labour main roads jobs were
more faithfully carried out, the men
gave good service, and the work was
often completed under estimated
cost. Very few employees working
for contractors enjoyed the benefit of
the wet weather clauses. He had to
be continually on the job to see that
contractors obeyed the award in this
respect.
Motion carried.
Mr. Brown moved; “That a deputa-
tion from the executive wait on the
Minister for Public Works request-
ing that all main roads work in
Queensland be done by day labour
and that such deputation comprise
the Branch President, the Branch
Secretary, and Mr. Crooks.”
Mr. Lewis seconded the motion.
Motion carried.
Mr. Brophy moved. in the
event of contract work on main roads
construction being retained, the Main
Roads Commission require contrac-
tors to sign a weekly declaration
that all the provisions of the rele-
vant awards have been complied
with.”
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont): The Main Roads Commis-
sion requires that to be done now.
Mr. Brophy said that the Main
Roads Commission required a decla-
ration that all wages had been paid,
but it was a simple matter for a con-
tractor to make that declaration even
though it were false.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont) said that in many cases the
declaration was false.
Mr. Brophy went on to say that
the more that they could prove
against the contractor the better case
they would have in favour of day
labour. In the absence of an orga-
niser in another part of the district
it was an easy matter for the con-
tractor to evade an award, especially
with regard to accommodation. The
Main Roads Commission allowed a
contractor to commence work pro-
vided he satisfied it that he had suf-
ficient financial backing, but they
preferred to see the equipment on
the ground. He had found men liv-
ing in their own tents, and when he
sought an explanation the employer
explained that he could not compel
an employee to live in his (the con-
tractor’s) tent if he did not want to;
and the employee made the excuse
that, by living in his own tent he
could select his own mate; but both
omitted to say that when the em-
ployee was engaged for the job he
was given a pretty broad hint that he
was expected to provide his own
tent. Therefore, he thought that the
Main Roads Commission should re-
quire the contractor to sign a de-
claration to the effect that he had
complied with all the conditions as
well as having paid the wages.
Address by Minister for Labour and
Industry
At this stage the Branch President
(Mr. J. C. Lamont) introduced the
Minister for Labour and Industry
(Mr. M. P. Hynes) and extended a
hearty welcome to him.
Mr. Hynes, who was enthusiasti-
cally received, said:
Mr. President and fellow members,
I desire to express my gratification
on again having the opportunity of
addressing Delegate Meeting. I had


an opportunity of addressing you
last year as Acting Premier, and
since that time I have watched, with
a great deal of interest, both as a
Minister of the Crown and as an
Executive Officer of your great oi-t
ganisation, the very important work
that you have been doing in the re-
mote parts of the State and in the
cities and towns.
Hitherto Delegate Meetings have
been characterised by common sense
and intelligence, and I have no fear
but that those attributes will be dis-
played on this occasion.
Advantage of Sympathetic
Administration
I take this opportunity of thanking
members for again re-electing me as
Vice-President. The fact that both
Mr. Dash and myself have been
elected to the high executive positions
of Vice-Presidents of this vast or-
ganisation clearly indicates that there
is a genuine desire that the indus-
trial and political wings of this great
Labor Movement should be drawn
together. Obviously it must be a
distinct advantage to an organisation
such as ours to have executive of-
ficers taking part in the affairs of
government.
I was an executive officer of
this organisation for very many
years, ana on attaining Ministerial
rank I was advised by many of my
life-long friends that I should resign
from the organisation because they
thought that very often I would be
placed in an awkward position. How-
ever, I thought otherwise, and my
experience during the past six years
has convinced me that it is a dis-
tinct advantage to both the Govern-
ment and this organisation to have
their executive officers in the Gov-
ernment. (Hear, hear.) I intend to
pursue that policy.
Driving Force of Real Unionism.
I congratulate you also on the in-
crease in membership, although I am
aware that an improvement in the
numerical strength of the organisa-
tion does not always mean progress.
I realise that the organiser who is
content to sed a man a ticket be-
cause you have the preference condi-
tion in your awards and leave it at
that is not carrying out the duty
that is expected of him. It is not
only the duty of the officials of the-
union to enrol members, but they
should inspire them with the ideals
and the objects of it, and instil into
them the spirit of the old stalwarts
of this grand organisation so that
they will be unionists as well as tic-
ket-holders.
It must be obvious to those of you
who are working out in the field the
whole year round that the man who
held a ticket before the days of com-
pulsory unionism because he thought
it was incumbent upon him to assist
in the fight for better conditions, was
a better unionist than the man who
is compelled to join because of the
preference clause in the awards.
Therefore I feel sure that you
realise the importance of con-
vincing the men to whom you
sell tickets that they must accept a
share of the responsibility in the
fight that this organisation is con-
tinually waging an endeavour to
further improve the lot of the work-
ers.
Disruptive Elements Must be Fought
The fight is becoming keener as
time goes on.
To-day there are breakaway move-
ments. There are disgruntled aspi-
rants for office in this organisation.
They have some organisation, they
have a powerful and influential Press
behind them, and are surreptitiously
in receipt of assistance from the capi-
talistic class. (Hear, hear!)
Those facts definitely suggest that
we must renew our efforts and that
not only paid organisers but also
members outside must accept their
share of the responsibility in combat-
ing the subterfuge and the on-
slaughts made on executive officers,
the union, and your Government.
Importance of Forthcoming Election
This year we are to face an elec-
tion. The defeat of Labor at the
polls would be a very disastrous thing
for the workers of Queensland.
In 1929 the Government were de-
feated by the Tory Party. A new
generation had arisen since 1915.
These young people said: “No Gov-
ernment would dare to take away the
conditions that had already been won.
We need not fear a change of Gov-
ernment; in fact, a change of Gov-
ernment might be a good thing.”


But we old hands were not disil-
lusioned. We knew that immediate-
ly the Tory Party secured office they
would set about repealing the benefi-
cial Acts that had been placed on
the Statute Book by a Labor Gov-
ernment between 1915 and 1929. The
edifice of Labor was ruthlessly at-
tacked, and in one session of Parlia-
ment many important Acts were re-
pealed, amended, or emasculated to
such an extent that they lost their
effectiveness so far as the working
class were concerned. That clearly
shows that if Labor lost again we
would be forced back to the same
position.
Restoring Conditions Taken Away by
Moore Government
Since Labor was returned in 1932
we have been assiduously working in
an endeavour to restore the condi-
tions that were taken from you dur-
ing the period of the Moore Govern-
ment ; and, I am pleased to say, that
all those conditions virtually have
been restored.
My first job on assuming office was
to bring down a new Industrial Ar-
bitration Act repealing the Sizer
Arbitration Act so as to restore to
the workers of Queensland those
things that had been taken from them
by Macgroarty, Sizer, and the rest of
that crowd.
We have worked along those lines
steadily since 1932 until the condi-
tions to-day are equal to those of
1929, before the depression. These
things speak volumes for the honesty
and integrity of the Government and
the Labor Party.
Harmony Between Industrial and
Political Wings
The Political Labor Party has a re-
cord of splendid achievement, and I
attribute that success to the harmony
and co-operation that we have been
able to maintain between the indus-
trial and political wings. I believe
that that harmony will continue in
the future, and there is no doubt that
if we receive the same co-operation
from the unions we shall return with
a majority of Labor candidates when
the elections are held in May or June.
What a Tory Victory Would Mean
There is no occasion for me to em-
phasise the need for a Labor Govern-
ment. I have already pointed out that
between 1929 and 1932 all that we
had won by a generation of effort and
sacrifice was wiped away in one
session of Parliament. If we are de-
feated again the A.W.U. will be hit
harder than any other industrial
union on account of the nature of its
organisation. It is a political organi-
sation, and therefore it would receive
special attention from an anti-Labor
Government.
The Case for Labor
Yesterday you heard an inspiring
address by our Premier. He stated the
case for Labor.
That case is as old as the centuries.
The principle underlying that case is
that the workers are striving to ob-
tain the full results of their industry.
We do not subscribe to a policy that
unless we can get everything at once
we will refrain from any reform. Your
organisation and the Labor Govern-
ment subscribe to the idea that the
process will have to be a gradual one,
and that we cannot achieve every-
thing by carrying a resolution and
expecting to rise in the morning to
find the whole social and industrial
system changed.
A considerable amount of ground
work must be done by the unions and
Labor Parliaments. We are working
steadily ahead, developing all the
time. The Labor platform of 1915 has
been placed on the Statute 'Book
showing that progress has been made.
Question of Annual Ballots
To-day you are formulating a
policy for your union for the next 12
months and, in passing, I think some
thought should be given to an exten-
sion of the period of office for your
office-holders. I think it is causing
injury to the organisation to have a
ballot of officers every 12 months.
Under the present system a consider-
able amount of time that might
otherwise be spent in the work of the
organisation in important work in the
Court and in formulating a policy ex-
tending over 12 months is devoted to
the holding of ballots. I hope that
someone will have courage to advo-
cate at this Delegate Meeting or at
Convention that the period of office
should be more than one year.
(Hear, hear!) Perhaps it could be a
gradual process, with a trial of, say,
two years for a start. That would
be of great benefit to the organisa


tion. Mind you, I am only express-
ing my own personal opinion, and
that after a great deal of experience
in your organisation.
Administration of Department of
Labour
Perhaps it would not be inappro-
priate to make some reference to the
work of my department. Most of you
know that it is more closely associat-
ed with the A.W.U. than any other
Government department. Since I was
given the portfolio of Minister for
Labour and Indutry I have found that
the experience that I gained in the
A.W.U. has stood me in good stead.
I am familiar with the requirements
and the aspirations of the members
of the A.W.U., and when I say that
I am familiar with the aspirations of
over 50,000 members, and sympathet-
ically disposed tow r ards those aspira-
tions, you can see that the training I
received in the A.W.U. is standing
me in good stead in the portfolio
that I now hold.
No Delay in Settling Disputes
During the past year I was in con-
stant touch with your president, sec-
retary, district secretary, and other
executive officers. There is no diffi-
culty . in getting in touch with me,
either by ’phone, by letter, or by per-
sonal call. If a dispute arises or an
injustice is perpetrated in any part
of the State, a ’phone call places the
matter before me, and perhaps it
is adjusted before noon. Those are
some of the advantages of an
organisation being in close touch with
the Government on account of the
harmony that exists between them.
Workers’ Accommodation
It was really at the suggestion of
Delegate Meeting that certain indus-
trial laws were passed during the last
session of Parliament.
There was grave cause for com-
plaint concerning the administration
of the Workers’ Accommodation Act
during the period of the Moore Gov-
' eminent. In fact, the Act was ig-
nored and employers were allowed to
treat their employees as they wished.
The privileges and concessions that
had been given to them by the Labor
Government were disregarded between
1929 and 1932, so that when I took
office the path ahead looked a pretty
rough one. However, by a gradual
process the employers are beginning
to realise that they must comply with
the Workers’ Accommodation Act. At
the last Delegate Meeting it was sug-
gested that the Act should be fur-
ther amended to provide that kit-
chens, storehouses, meat-houses, etc.,
should be made fly-proof and that
drinking water for employees should
be screened so as to keep it free from
contamination. The Act was amend-
ed in that direction during the last
session.
Where Industrial Legislation is Begun
Most of the amendments of the in-
dustrial legislation have emanated
from meetings such as this. The Un-
employment Insurance Act, the Work-
ers’ Accommodation Act, the Indus-
trial Arbitration Act, the Fair Rents
Act, and many others, were discussed
perhaps two and three years before
they were enacted. They were con-
sidered by Delegate Meetings which
indicates that you in yourselves are
a kind of Parliament, a place where
the Labor Movement—the workers of
Queensland —can express their be-
sides and inform the Government of
the legislative requirements for their
protection and advancement. That
indicates the important positions that
you hold as delegates here.
I have had a couple of deputations
from employers trying to persuade
me to recommend to the Government
that we should not go on with the
amendment of the Workers’ Accom-
modation Act providing for the fly-
proofing of kitchens, etc.
Then there is the old hardy-annual
at these gatherings—adequate cook-
ing accommodation in the kitchens.
That matter has now been effectively
dealt with. The Act now provides
that where a certain number are be-
ing cooked for there shall be stoves
or ranges of certain dimensions. De-
spite the deputations and the agita-
tions against these amendments _we
intend to see that the Act is carried
out to the letter. (Hear, hear).
Safeguarding Wages in Sugar
Industry
Another Act that was amenaeu at
the suggestion of Delegate Meeting'
was the Wages Act. I think the mat-
ter was raised at the last Delegate
Meeting by Mr. Hay, who pointed
out that m sugar areas the practice


"was to purchase sugar farms on
small deposits and then give big
liens over the crops, with the result
that the lienee was not responsible
lor the payment of wages, and many
of our members were robbed of their
wages Mr. Hay placed the facts be-
fore me, and I think Delegate Meet-
ing carried a resolution asking that
something should be done in order
to protect wage-earners by restoring
the protection of their wages to
them. I found that they had had
that protection up to 1931. This is
something that seems to have escaped
the attention of most people, that
clause 38 of the Mercantile Act pro-
vided that where a lienee had taken
a lien over a farm and the lienor was
unable to pay the wages, the lienee
was responsible for them immedi-
ately the lien was registered.
When the Moore Government pass-
ed the Liens on Crops of Sugar Cane
Act they deliberately wiped out that
protection, and as a result cane-cut-
ters and field workers in the sugar
areas were denied the protection
that was available to them up to
1931. The amendment of the Act was
a rather intricate one, but we pro-
vided that in future all lienees should
be responsible for the payment of
wages in the case of default by the
•employer—the lienor. That conferred
untold benefits on the people who
were working in the Northern areas
of the State.
Stringent Penalties for Award
Breaches
Another matter that concerned not
only the A.W.U., but also other
unions, was the large number of
breaches of the baking trade award.
For many years we have made at-
tempts tc deal with these contraven-
tions of awards covering the baking
trade. They were more numerous
than in any other calling. In fact, it is
safe to say that they exceeded the
breaches in all the other callings put
together.
It was represented to me that we
might establish a board and hand
over the control of the industry to it.
That suggestion was put forward by
the employers, but it provided for no
representation for consumers. It
gave them almost the same powers
as the Government, and I saw in that
the possible exploitation of the con-
sumer by an increase in th e price 0 f
the loaf. I could not reconnn end t h a t
to Cabinet.
Other efforts were made but they
were futile. Eventually I decided to
amend the Industrial Arbitration Act
to provide minimum fines for breaches
in this particular calling. The Act
now provides that for the first offence
the baker is fined £lO, and for the
second offence £2O; the seller of the
bread £5 for the first offence and £lO
for a subsequent offence.
I am satisfied that the infliction of
these minimum penalties, which can-
not be reduced by any magistrate,
will have the effect of compelling the
employers to observe the awards.
Success of Unemployment Insurance
During the past year we have also
improved the conditions under the
Unemployment Workers’ Insurance
Act by increasing the payments to
beneficiaries under the scheme by Is.
a week.
On the last occasion that I ad-
dressed you I pointed out that about
64 per cent of this fund was paid
to A.W.U. members. The Labor
Government are particularly proud of
this fund. This is the only insurance
scheme that withstood the depression.
It was laid down on an actuarial basis
by a Labor Government in 1922.
When I took control of the fund in
1932 I found that it was in pretty
low water; in fact, we were working
on a small overdraft at that time. It
was my job to see that the condi-
tions that had been filched from the
workers by the Moore Government
were gradually restored, and so we
have built up a reserve fund so that
in times of emergency or an indus-
trial dispute we shall be able to carry
out our responsibilities to the workers
who are beneficiaries . under the
scheme. There has been a gradual im-
provement in the fund with a conse-
quential improvement in conditions
until to-day the payments and con-
cessions are equal to those that ob-
tained when the Act was originally
passed.
_ In the original Act we made provi-
sion for beneficiaries and four depen-
dants, but we have increased that to
eight and we have made improve-
ments in the lot of the casual worker.
Under the Moore Government the
benefits were restricted to those


people who during the previous 12
months did not earn £220. That
meant the elimination of probably 50
per cent of the members of the
A.W.U., but we gradually got over
that by increasing the limitation to
£3OO and subsequently wiping it out
altogether. So that to-day any man
who is a contributor to the fund is
also a beneficiary irrespective of the
wages that he earns during the pre-
vious 12 months.
Queensland Outstanding in Treat-
ment of Unemployed
I also have the important task of
controlling the Unemployment Relief
Fund and of taking charge of subsi-
diary funds dealing with unemploy-
ment relief in Queensland. I have
frequently announced in the press
that despite what our traducers may
say, no other State in the Common-
wealth is doing so much for the un-
employed as Queensland.
We are not throwing the_ money
a why. We are spending a portion of it
on creating employment on subsidies to
local authorities, without which they
would be unable to go on with necessary
reproductive works and services for
the citizens of the State. They would
never have been embarked upon were
it not for the assistance from this
fund.
The net result of that policy has
been that there are more people in
employment in Queensland to-day
than ever in the history of the State,
indicating that the policy is a wise
one. There are fewer unemployed in
Queensland now than in any other
part of the Commonwealth.
Some people may ask why it _is
that they are obliged to pay relief
tax when such is the case, but the
explanation is that we are gradually
extending the liberality of the fund
by broadening the eligibility of people
to participate in the benefits.
To-day there are people receiving
assistance in Queensland who never
received assistance before the advent
of the Labor Government.
There is a definite change not only
in the Commonwealth, but through-
out the civilised world on the ques-
tion of what Governments _ should do
to help their unemployed citizens. In
most other countries in the world as-
sistance is being extended to a greater
extent than hitherto.
Comparisons With Other States
If the intermittent relief workers
resided in the other States, say, in
Victoria and N.S.W., 73 per cent of
them would not be eligible for assis-
I am not making a loose statement
in connection with this matter. I have
one of your old mates, Arthur Jones,
doing a very useful job in my de-
partment. I could not get away to
make the investigation personally,
and I commissioned Arthur Jones to
proceed to Melbourne and New South
Wales to make inquiries for me. I
had previously made investigations in
those two States, and when I. came
back I was satisfied that we were
doing a very generous thing by our
unfortunate people who were out of
work. Mr. Jones submitted a very
comprehensive report and brought
back the means test that was applied
in Victoria to people asking for relief.
We ran out a trial test at one of our
suburban police stations where the
unemployed were being catered for,
and it indicated that 73 per cent of
those who were examined were not
eligible for relief according to the
conditions laid down by the Victorian
Government. They would not he en-
titled to any assistance from the fund
at all.
It is necessary for me to tell you
that because statements have been
made in Parliament to the effect that,
in Tory-governed States the relief
workers are better off. You have this
very significant fact that a very large
number of unemployed in the othei
two eastern States were migrating to
Queensland, and we had to take dras-
tic measures to prevent them from
coming on our fund. Of course, we
were up against the ingenuity of man
and in some cases they did come on
to the scheme.
Quite recently I had an opportun-
ity of visiting South Australia, and
I made some investigations into the
relief scheme there. They have no
definite scheme in South_ Australia,
not that they do not need it. The per-
centage of "unemployment in South
Australia is much greater than it is
in this State, but despite that fact
there is no real scheme for the relief
of unemployment.
Anti-Labor Propaganda
Attempts are made to cause fric-
tion between the unemployed and the
Government. Certain irresponsible


people have made wild statements,
others have a definite reason for try-
ing to poison the great body of indus-
trialists who are out of work against
the Government in the hope that they
will secure same benefit at the next
election by getting them to vote
against the people who are doing their
utmost to assist them in these trying
times. I am satisfied that the Queens-
land Government will always do the
right thing by the unemployed citi-
zens of Queensland—by subsidising
local authorities and by converting
intermittent relief jobs to full-time
jobs under award rates and condi-
tions. We are carrying out that policy.
High Ideals and Practical Policies
As an old member of your organi-
sation and one who has watched its
progress with a great deal of interest
since ceasing to take an active part
as organiser and District Secretary,
I can assure you that I am proud of
the work that is being done by the
organisers acting in honorary capaci-
ties, as well as by the paid officials.
Looking back in retrospect I often
think that one reason why the
A.W.U. is such a powerful influence
in this country is because we have
always kept both feet on the ground
and our chin in the air.
We were never led astray by the
siren voice of the traducer; we were
never led by false visionaries or by
people who wanted us to scrap a
practical policy for a visionary policy.
Australia First
I realise that it is necessary for an
organisation such as this to have
some regard to international affairs,
but the affairs of the Australian citi-
zen should be foremost in your minds
in connection with your duty and your
service to the workers. (Hear, hear.)
We have an Australian organisation
that is Australian in outlook and
sentiment, and while we must take
some notice and have some regard to
the trend of international affairs we
must not allow them to becom an
obsession to the detriment of our
own. The A.W.U. has always had an
intelligent policy and will continue to
have it so long as we do not get
our heads in the clouds and can re-
main on terra firma. Keep our feet
firmly on the ground.
Importance of Forthcoming Labor
Convention
The triennial Convention will take
place on February 21 at Mackay. On
the success of that Convention will
depend the success of Labor at the
polls a few months later. If we go
to the polls with an impossible
policy we shall not have a ghost of
a chance of coming back successful,
comrades. It is incumbent upon the
12 representatives from the A.W.U.
and it is the duty of those who have
influence with the constituents—l am
sure that you will accept that duty
—to see that a sane and wise policy
emanates from Convention, a policy
that we can take to the constituen-
cies and come back with a majority.
That is the paramount problem
confronting the workers of Queens-
land to-day—to leave Convention
with a policy that will appeal to the
majority of the constituencies in this
State. After all, in a Movement such
as ours it is impossible to expect all
to be of the same mind.
Some people will say that we are
not going fast enough; that we should
have a more revolutionary policy, a
more clear-cut industrial policy; but
I want to remind you that we are
living in a political democracy in
which every man and woman over
the age of 21 years outside jails and
asylums are privileged to say what
Government they will choose for the
next three years. Different consti-
tuencies have different interests—
different industries.
I am sure you will all admit that
we are blessed with one of the most
capable leaders of any Government in
Australia to-day, in the person of the
Hon. W. Forgan Smith. (Hear,
hear!) He will have to formulate a
policy at Convention that will enable
him to win the majority of the con-
stituencies in this State.
If we were to come forward with
a more rabid policy or a more revo-
lutionary policy, those who would be
advocating it for the industrial con-
stituencies would be doing so from
the cool shades of the Opposition
benches. The first thing to decide is,
what should be done at Convention ?
It is to determine what policy will
commend itself to the majority of
the people and the majority of the
constituencies. I feel that if we go
from Convention with a wise, sane,


and intelligent policy, our success at
the polls will be assured. And as is
usual, the A.W.U. will play a very
big part in that success.
I see amongst you Tommy Hollo-
way, whom I have not met for many
years. I met him first at Convention
when I think he was Vice-President of
the Central Branch. I see many old
faces round me and they remind me
of the great work that the stalwarts
of the organisation did not only for
this union alone but for the industrial
and political movement in this coun-
try. I am sure that this Delegate
Meeting will not do anything that
will in any way besmirch the splen-
did reputation that the great A.W.U.
has always had for honesty, in-
tegrity, and intelligence. (Loud ap-
plause.)
In moving a hearty vote of thanks
to the Minister for his inspiring ad-
dress. Mr. Dougherty said that there
was not the slightest doubt that he
had supplied them with a fund of
very useful information. He had ten-
dered very sound advice concerning
the attitude that should be adopted at
the triennial convention in Mackay.
He referred to the benefits that the
Labor Government had been able to
extend to the workers. He had been
of great service to the workers in
the Mackay district, for instance. At
one time he was organiser in that
area, and he (Mr. Dougherty) found
it difficult to live up to the excellent
standard that he had set. Many of
the old hands frequently referred to
the -wonderful organising abilities of
“Mossy” Hynes. He had suggested
that the officials of the organisation
should hold office for a longer period
than 12 months, and that view had
been expressed by quite a large num-
ber of members of the organisation.
He was glad that Mr. Hynes had
given that lead, and he hoped that
the matter would be considered at
Convention. He regretted that he was
not capable of expressing effectively
the appreciation of the workers for
all that the Minister had done on
their behalf, but he hoped that he
would long continue to occupy the of-
fice of Minister in the Labor Move-
ment.
In seconding the motion, Mr. Bo-
land congratulated Mr. Hynes on
again being elected vice-president of
the organisation. The great majority
of the members appreciated what he
had done for them, and that was
clearly evidenced from the result, of
the ballots. The Minister was in
charge of one of the most difficult
departments, but he had carried out
his administration with credit to the
Labor Movement and the organisa-
tion. He trusted that he would be
spared to continue to render great
service for Labor if not in his pre-
sent position then in some higher
office.
Motion carried with acclamation.
The Minister thanked delegates for
their hearty vote of thanks.
State Members Welcomed
At this stage the Branch President
introduced Messrs. S. J. Brassington,
M.L.A. for Fortitude Valley, and
Wm. Power, M.L.A. for Baroona in
the State Parliament.
Mr. Brassington said that although
he had ceased to participate actively
in the affairs of the A.W.U. his re-
lationship had been the happiest and
most fraternal. He thanked them for
the ungrudging assistance that they
had extended to him on all occasions.
The Australian Workers’ Union was
the bulwark of the Labor Movement,
not only in Queensland, but also in
the other States. The A.W.U. had
laid the foundation for both the in-
dustrial and political movement, and
they had no need to apologise to their
critics for the splendid work that it
had done. Its sound policy had con-
ferred great benefits on the rank and
file. The policy was sound, it was
worth whife, and must succeed with
the great majority of the members.
Not many years ago a disgruntled
majority who were always prepared
to accept all the benefits that arbi-
tration could bestow upon them in
prosperous times later decided to
resort to direct action in the pastoral
industry with consequent loss to
themselves. Their action was a
stupid one. They had no need to be
ashamed of the principle of arbitra-
tion. He would ask them to contrast
the results of arbitration with the
disastrous consequences that followed
the result of direct action by anotlmr
organisation a few months ago when
80 to 90 men lost permanent jobs.
Every well-wisher of the union be-
lieved in arbitration. As a member
of the Labor Government he desired
to express his appreciation of the un


failing loyalty that they had received.
He was sure that they all appreciated
the value of the closest co-operation
between the industrial and political
wings. They should stand for an
Australian sentiment and beware of
the dangers of Fascism. He believed
that if their opponents were pushed
far enough they would adopt the
Fascist policy, as had been done in
other countries. There were enemies
ever ready to destroy the work of
the A.W.U., but it should be the duty
of everybody to disregard side issues
and so present a united front in the
interests of progress. (Applause.)
Mr. Power congratulated the
A.W.U. in remaining steadfast to the
policy of arbitration. He thanked
them for their sunnort, and stressed
the need for the closest co-operation
between the industrial and political
wings. (Applause.)
On the motion of Mr. Burns,
seconded by Mr. Ivey, a vote of
thanks was accorded to Messrs.
Brassington and Power.
Local Authority and Main Roads
Board Award —(Continued)
Mr. Boland, in seconding the mo-
tion moved by Mr. Brophy, said that
it would not have been possible to
collect arrears of wages if contrac-
tors had not been compelled to sign
the declaration. It would be in the
interests of the employees if they
were compelled to sign it every week.
In many cases progress payments
were withheld until the wages had
been paid.
Mr. Hay suggested that the follow-
ing should be added: “And that the
Minister for Public Works and the
Main Roads Commission be asked to
prosecute every contractor who
signed a false declaration to the
effect that all wages had been paid
and conditions observed by him.”
Motion carried.
The Branch President (Mr, J. C.
Lamont): The following resolution
was submitted by Murgon: “That the
price of cutting tracks and men as-
sisting with tractors be brought
under the Sawmilling Award.”
Mr. Brown explained that the reso-
lution came from a district where
men were assisting with tractors on
a timber ramp, and thev were paid
any rate at all. He thought that
there should be a provision in the
Sawmilling Award to cover men with
tractors and chains, snigging timber
round ramps.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont) informed delegates that the
Branch Secretary and himself had
made every effort to secure an award
for timber haulers and hewers, but
they had been unsuccessful. A rate
that might be reasonable in one dis-
trict would mean a meagre income in
another.
Motion lapsed.
Mr. Dougherty moved: “That ap-
plication be made to the Arbitration
Court for two weeks’ holiday on full
pay for each twelve months’ service,
or a monetary pro rata equivalent for
a lesser period.” The tendency was
for the Court to grant holidays, and
if it could be done in one case it
could be extended to local authority
emnloyees. Only recently holidays
had been extended to storemen and
packers and shop assistants in the
Mackay district. The employees in
the bush were not concerned so much
with an increase in wages as an im-
provement of conditions, and they
would appreciate an annual holiday.
Mr, Lewis seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Sugar Industry Award
Mr. Bushnell moved: “That the
ordinary working hours of canecutters
shall not exceed 44 in any one_ week,
and shall not exceed 8 hours in any
one day, and shall be worked Mon-
day to Friday inclusive between 6.30
a.m. and 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and 5.30
p.m., and between 6.30 a.m. and 11
a.m. on Saturday from the com-
mencement of the crushing season up
to and inclusive of 30th September,
and between 5.30 a.m. and 10 a.m.
and 2 p.m. and 6.30 p.m, Monday to
Friday inclusive, and from 5.30 a.m
to 10 a.m. on Saturday on and after
Ist October.”
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G..
Fallon) suggested that thev should
carry a resolution to the effect that
the application made on a previous
occasion that the work should be
done in two runs be renewed. He
had had suggestions from all the
sugar districts, and each had been
carefully considered.
Mr. Bushnell said that there was
.no doubt that the canecutters desired
an alteration in the starting and
ceasing time in the summer months,


especially when working under torrid
conditions in the Far North. A man
had to be well fit physically to con-
tinue to work between rows of cane
where he got little fresh air.
The Branch Secretary: He has to
be a super man to do it.
Mr. Bushnell said that men became
run down in health and their powers
of resistance were not sufficient to
withstand even the ordinary cold, and
so much time was lost through sick-
ness. There were continual com-
plaints that gangs commenced before
6 a.m., and it was utterly impossible
to prevent breaches of the award.
Sometimes gangs who had reported
others for breaches of the award
committed the same offence them-
selves by working 10 hours a day.
There should be a definite starting
and ceasing time with a definite
break in the day. The men were
credited with earning 30s. to £2 in
eight hours, but when the advocate
was before the Court asking for an
increase in the cutting rates the em-
ployers were able to produce records
to show that the men had earned up
to £3 a day, and it was well known
that it was onlv by working 12 to
14 hours. If the work was to be
done in two runs the men should be
prosecuted for working during the
rest period.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) reminded delegates that the
employers had an excellent record
system showing the earnings of all
gangs in the Far North, and prob-
ably in other parts of the State, and
it was difficult to combat the figures.
Although the wages in the sugar
industry were based on an average
of 3| tons a day in North Queens-
land the employers were able to pro-
duce figures to show that the men
were cutting nearer 4j tons, and this
fact placed him in an awkward posi-
tion; but, having regard to the basis
on which the rates were fixed, they
were fortunate in escaping a reduc-
tion because of increased output. The
existing conditions were a prostitu-
tion of the 8-hour principle because
the great bulk of the canecutters
worked more than eight hours. When
he was organiser in the Mackay dis-
trict there was not one occasion on
which he went out in the very early
hours of the morning that he did not
find some men at work. There was
no doubt that men working long
hours under hot, trying conditions
lowered their powers of resistance,
and so a lot of time was lost through
sickness. That practice had eliminat-
ed all but the best physical types,
and men who were too slow for piece-
work were thrown on the industrial
scrapheap on reaching a certain age.
Under prevailing conditions the in-
tention of the Court in limiting the
hours to 44 was frustrated, the prin-
ciple of an 8-hour day was prosti-
tuted, and legislation along these
lines was violated. On the last occa-
sion that he was before the Court
■when, in his opinion, he had submit-
ted a sound case, the employers con-
tended that if men were idle for three
or four hours during the day it would
interfere with operations at the mill
and in getting cane from the field.
They contended that the horses would
have to be available for 12 hours,
whereas under present conditions
they could have the trucks out at
lunchtime and use the horses for
other purposes during the rest of the
day. He asked members to furnish
him with any information that would
help him to combat the arguments of
the employers in the Court.
Mr. Dougherty said that many
canecutters worked the regulation
hours, that they knocked off in the
hottest part of the day and remained
in the barracks.
Mr. Burns wanted to know what
would be the position in the Southern
District.
Mr. Dougherty: It should apply to
the whole State.
Mr. Burns: Then I will oppose the
motion.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that it was his intention
to ask the representatives in the
sugar district to confine the applica-
tion to the district from Mackay
north, but including Mackay. Having
regard to the argument advanced to
the Court on the last occasion he
thought that they would have a rea-
sonable chance of success.
Mr. Hay pointed out that at three
big meetings on the Burdekin the
cutters had asked for 7 o’clock start-
ing time and a 5 o’clock ceasing
time.
Mr. Bushnell moved as an adden-
dum: “That the foregoing resolution
apply to the district extending from
Mackay north, but including Mac-
kay.”


C. G. FALLON
Branch President 1929-1933
Branch Secretary 1933




Mr. Brophy said that if the prin-
ciple was sound it should be applied
to the whole State.
Mr. Burns opposed the motion. In
the South the hours were from 1 to
5. and in 9f) per cent of the cases they
were faithfully adhered to. Quite a
number of canecutters were opposed
to the present hours, but even if they
were altered there would be opposi-
tion, even to the alteration. He be-
lieved that the concensus of opinion
was in opposition to the proposed
change. He did not see why the
starting time should be earlier than
6 o’clock. They could not stop cane-
cutters who were determined to cut
cane in the middle of the day.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon): They would be more easily
seen.
Mr. Burns was of the opinion that
if the hours were altered as suggest-
ed they would be inundated with re-
quests to change them again. The
only fair way to overcome the diffi-
culty was tef hold meetings in the
various districts during the coming
season so as to get an expression of
opinion from all the men. The cane-
cutters in the Bundaberg district
would not commence work at 5.30
a.m.
Mr. Dougherty supported the mo-
tion. In the Mackay district some
canecutters commenced work at 4
a.m., and quite a number of hungry
canecutters worked the whole 12
hours. No effort should be spared
to bring about the suggested altera-
tion which, he was sure, would be ap-
preciated by the majority of fair-
minded cutters. In addition, they
would be creating more employment.
The greedy cutter would take on a
cut that he could not handle and al-
most kill himself to get a few extra
shillings. It was all rot for the em-
ployers to say that they could not
get the cane in the middle of the day.
There was no need to hold up the
transport of cane.
Mr. Boland was emphatic that the
proposal would not interfere with the
mill organisation, because the trucks
were supplied either early in the
morning or after 2 p.m. in the after-
noon. He did not see why men should
he compelled to cut cane under con-
ditions that were regarded as too hot
for horses. Men should not be prose-
cuted for commencing work before 6
a.m. so as to avoid working in the
hotter hours in the middle of the day.
The resolution was very necessary.
Mr. Lewis cautioned them to be
very careful in considering the mat-
ter "otherwise it might have repercus-
sions. He thought that they should
first obtain the opinion of the men.
Again,, if they were unfortunate
enough to lose at the next elections
the employers might ask for a simi-
lar provision in other industries. He
warned them to go very warily. A
ballot would be the best way out of
the difficulty.
Mr. Brophy was of the opinion that
it would be a pity if the resolution
was defeated because of the conflict
of interests between the north and
the south. He moved: “That a com-
mittee consisting of Messrs. Bushnell,
Dougherty, and Crooks be appointed
to examine the proposal, submit it at
Delegate Meeting with a recom-
mendation that would suit the re-
quirements of all districts.”
Mr. Brown, who seconded the
amendment, said he thought it should
be applied to the Southern district
as well. In the Isis district the men
had agreed to work suitable hours.
Mr. Bushnell asked whether the
amendment was not a direct nega-
tive.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament said that as the amendment
proposed that the committee should
report back to the Delegate Meeting
he* ruled that it was in order.
Mr. Crooks supported the motion.
In 1934 the Branch Secretary_ had
asked for an expression of opinion
with regard to hours for that part of
the State from Mackay north. He
was in agreement with the hours
submitted to the Court, and a num-
ber of canecutters were favourable,
too. Of course, there have to
be a fixed starting and ceasing time
so that the award could be effectively
policed. They were only asking that
the canecutters be allowed to work
during the cooler hours of the day.
Mr. Hay was of the opinion that a
spread of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. was long
enough in which to do the day’s work.
He was opposed to the motion. The
resolution sought to extend the
spread from Mackay north. In the
Ingham district in the winter
months, which extended from June to
August, there was no need for a big


spread of hours; and in the Moss-
man district the men had agreed to
a spread from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. He
had attended meetings of 300 to 400
men where they had asked that the
hours of labour be from 7 a.m. to 5
p.m., and he was not going back to
tell them that he had supported a mo-
tion to spread them still further.
What was to be the position of the
cutters living in the town? Were
they going to drag their wives out
at 3 and 4 o’clock in the morning to
cook their meals? Were they going
to make slaves of them ?
Mr. Dougherty: They are doing it
now.
Mr. Hay admitted that they were.
Were they going to ask their wives
to prepare meals at 8 and 9 o’clock
at night? Some of the men rode 8
to 10 miles to their work, and they
were not going to sit down in the
middle of the day. There was no con-
flict between the north and the south
on the matter, but there would be a
conflict if the motion was carried in
its present form.
Mr. Murphy supported the motion.
In the Mulgrave and Babinda areas
they had decided on a quota of 4.2
tons a day, but the greedy cutter got
round the arrangement by signing on
in a gang of eight men—some men
whom they knew would inevitably fall
out within a few days, and so they
were back to the old trouble. So bad
did it become that it was necessary
to call in the Industrial Magistrate
at Babinda, and he ordered that the
gangs be maintained at their proper
strength. It was possible to work 10
hours with the present spread.
Mr. Dufficy supported the amend-
ment. He was of the opinion that the
subject required careful considera-
tion because circumstances varied in
the different districts. He was of the
opinion that when the committee re-
ported back to Delegate Meeting they
would be in a better position to deal
with the matter. At the present
time the emplovers claimed that the
earnings were made in 44 hours, and
that made it difficult for their advo-
cate in Court. He did not think that
an earlier starting time would meet
with general satisfaction in the Bun-
daberg district.
Replying to Mr. Burns, Mr. Bush-
nell said that although there might
be an uproar in some quarters if the
proposal was adopted, the petition
threatened by Mr. Burns would not
materialise. They were only anxious
to compel the offending canecutters
to play the game. A change: of hours
would not interfere with loading or
delivery of cane. There were net
enough locomotives to take it away
during the day, and many rakes were
taken away in the afternoon. There-
fore, he asked, what was wrong with
loading the trucks in the cool hours
of the morning and afternoon. He
asked delegates not to concern them-
selves so much about other awards
but to concentrate on the sugar in-
dustry. He denied that they were
attempting to extend the spread of
hours still further. In fact, in the
early part of the season, it was pro-
posed to reduce them by one. Many
of big mills crushed from June to
the middle of December, and some of
them even into Christmas week. It
would be an advantage to work dur-
ing the cooler hours of the day. He
wished to deal with the fnen who had
stubbornly refused to play the game
in respect of a 44-hour week. They
criticised the Government for failing
to introduce a 40-hour week, but they
refused to adhere even to a 44-hour
week. The men should be compelled
to observe the eight-hour day and
thus provide more work in the sugar
areas. He asked them to consider
what it meant if 500 cutters worked
10 hours a day. He urged delegates
to support the motion.
Mr. Dufficy asked Mr. Bushnell if
he was in favour of fixing a definite
starting and ceasing time for the
whole of the sugar industry, and Mr.
Bushnell replied that he preferred to
apply his proposal to the whole of
Queensland.
Amendment carried.
State Members Welcomed
At this- stage the Branch President
introduced Messrs. John Mann, M.L.A.
for Brisbane, and James Clark,
M.L.A. for Fitzroy in the State Par-
liament, and invited them to address
the meeting.
Mr. Mann thanked delegates for
their hearty welcome, and expressed
the opinion that if members of Par-
liament moved more freely amongst
industrial delegates it would help ma-
terially to cement the industrial and
political wings. He appreciated the


value of the A.W.U. because he knew
that without its support the Labor
■Government could not have remained
in office for so many years with ad-
vantage to the workers. There was
a small section that was endeavouring
to white-ant the A.W.U. and the
political party throughout Australia.
There was an unbridgeable gap be-
tween the Communist Party and the
Labor Party, and no man could be a
member of both organisations. In
1916 the Labor Party controlled the
Federal Parliament and five out of
the six States, but later they lost
■control, except in Queensland, and he
thought that was due to the machina-
tions of the alleged militants or so-
called industrialists. It was better to
proceed slowly and surely with their
legislative efforts. If they adopted a
sane, sensible policy it would redound
to the benefit of both producer and
consumer. He paid a tribute to the
excellent work of the A.W.U. (Ap-
plause.)
Mr. Clark thanked delegates for
their hearty welcome, and enjoined
them to do all in their power to fur-
ther improve the friendly relation-
ships in the industrial and political
wings. He was proud to say that he
had been a member of the A.W.U.
ever since he had joined the move-
ment, and he hoped that their de-
liberations would result in further
benefits for the workers of Queens-
land. (Applause.)
On the motion of Mr. Ivey, second-
ed by Mr. Lough, a vote of thanks was
accorded Messrs. Mann and Clark for
their visit.
Sugar Industry Award—(Continued)
Mr. Hay moved: “That the Branch
Secretary endeavour to secure a com-
pulsory sign-on of canecutters in all
mill areas, and that the relevant in-
formation in support of the applica-
tion be forwarded to the Branch
Secretary to enable him to present
an effective case to the Court.”
Motion carried.
Mr. Dougherty moved: “That appli-
cation be made to the Industrial Court
to have the following clause inserted
in the Sugar Award (State): ‘All cane
shall be cut on piecework rates and
conditions except where the total
tonnage estimated to be harvested by
the grower, whether an individual
partnership or company, does not ex-
ceed 400 tons.’ ”
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) pointed out that one of the
objects of the organisation was the
abolition of the contract system, and
as the motion sought to extend that
principle he had no alternative but to
rule it out of order, because it was in
contravention of the rules.
Mr. Dougherty said that a similar
application had been made to the
Court by the Branch Secretary, but
the Branch President told him that he
was bound bv the rules of the or-
ganisation. Mr. Dougherty said that
he was reluctantly compelled to move;
“That the Branch President’s ruling
be disagreed with.” He thought that
they should be given an onportunity
to present a case on behalf of men
who desired that to be done, but the
Branch President said that he could
not allow him to discuss the merits or
demerits of the matter, as the rules
left him no option but to rule that
the motion was out of order.
There being no seconder, the mo-
tion—“ That the Branch President’s
ruling be disagreed with” —lapsed.
Mr. Hay moved: “That Resolutions
342, 343, 344, 345. 346. 347, 349. and
350 be referred to the Branch Secre-
tary for consideration when the next
application is before the Court.”
Mr. Crooks seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr Dougherty moved: “That appli-
cation be made to the Court for a
provision in the Sugar Award, which
will give members employed cutting
cane for planting the same rate of
wages which are set out in the award
for dav labour canecutters.” The
cutter-planter was an entirely new
process, but plant-cutters had to do
the same work as men cutting mill-
able cane. They suffered more be-
cause they had to shoot the sticks of
cane through their hands.
The Branch Secretary: Do they
work at the same intensity?
Mr. Dougherty: Yes.
The Branch Secretary; Then it is a
worse job than canecutting.
Mr. Crooks seconded the motion.
Mr Bushnell moved as an amend-
ment: “That the resolution be referred
to the Branch Secretary for considera-
tion when making the next applica-
tion to the Court, and that the offi-
cials in districts where cutter-planters
are used supply the Branch Secretary
with the relative information concern


ing them.” They should have some
evidence to justify the application to
the Court.
Mr. Boland seconded the amend-
ment. •
Amendment carried.
Mr. Dougherty moved: “That appli-
cation be made to the Arbitration
Court for the inclusion in the Sugar
Award (State) of a clause that will
make provision whereby employees,
irrespective of age, who are doing the
work of cane truck, waggon driving
and ploughing shall receive the adult
rate of wages.” Very often boys were
employed driving three-horse wag-
gons and in loading cane. It was
really men’s work, but where employ-
ers could use youths for scuffling and
ploughing they did not hesitate to do
so. He had worked with these youths
and they did as much work as he did,
but when it came to a curtailment of
hands he was put off in preference
to the youths. There was unfair com-
petition _ with married men who were
put off in the slack season, while the
youths were retained in employment.
Mr. Burns seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Murphy moved: “That the pro-
vision of the 1936 award providing a
fiat rate penalty of Is. per ton for
burnt cane as a prevention against
Weil’s disease be re-enacted in the
1938 award, and that inspectors ap-
pointed under the Health regulations
he compelled to reside in the area
where they are appointed.” In his
area the employers paid the fiat rate
penalty of Is. until late in the season,
but towards the end they deducted the
full 20 per cent for burnt cane. Quite
a number of members were paid off
before the season was completed, and
the employers failed to honour their
obligation. The Health inspector re-
sided in Cairns, and could not pro-
perly administer the regulations.
Mr*. Bushnell seconded the motion,
and said it was difficult to get in
touch with the Health inspectors. He
could get no satisfaction until he had
written to the Health Department.
Motion carried.
Mr. Burns moved: “That the A.W.U.
approach the _ Arbitration Court to
have _ inserted in the award that the
working week in sugar mills shall
commence at 12 midnight Sunday and
cease at 12 noon on Saturday.” He
saw no reason why the ceasing time
should not be fixed as in other indus-
tries. If men had to remain at work
after 12 o’clock on Saturday they
should be paid overtime.
Mr. Dougherty, who seconded the
motion, said that there was no
reason why mills should not cease
work at noon on Saturday, and so al-
low the men to have the afternoon
off.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) pointed out that the mover
and the seconder seemed to he at
cross purposes. One asked that over-
time be paid, and the other that work
be prohibited after noon on Saturday.
If overtime were prohibited in sugar
mills they could not operate at all..
He declined to advocate before the
Court that no work should be permit-
ted during the week-end. They must
realise that that would lead to con-
gestion in the mill yards, with detri-
ment to the men in the fields. Most
of the mills were of large capacity,
and any interruption with crushing
operations might result in the men in
the field being stood down. The ob-
ject of working on Saturday after-
noon was for the purpose of getting
rid of surplus cane, a'nd if this was
not permitted it would probably lead
to further lost time. The Court would
not agree to such a proposal The
motion was impracticable, and it did
not convey clearly the intention of
the mover and seconder.
Mr. Bushnell pointed out that often
it was necessary to work during the
week-end to ensure smooth working
before commencement of operations
during the following week. He warned
them that in the interests of the
members, especially the mill mem-
bers, they should take great care be-
fore they passed the motion.
Motion withdrawn.
Welcome to Mr. Riordan, M.H.R.
At this stage the Branch Presi-
dent (Mr. J. C. Lament) extended a
hearty welcome to Mr. Riordan,
M.H.R., and invited him to address
delegates.
Mr. Riordan thanked delegates for
their cordial welcome, and said it was
always _ a pleasure to meet delegates
and officials of the organisation He
appreciated the help that had ' been
given to him during the short time
that he had carried Labor’s banner.
He attributed his success at the by-
election, and his record majority at
the general election, to the whole-
hearted assistance and hearty co


operation by all the officials, and to
the splendid relationship in the in-
dustrial and political wings.
On the motion of Mr. Bushnell,
seconded by Mr. Crooks, a vote of
thanks w-as accorded to Mr. Riordan.
The meeting adjourned till 10 a.m.
the following day.
FIFTH DAY
Friday, 21st January, 1938
Delegates present as on previous
day.
The minutes and official report of
the previous day’s sitting were
adopted.
Sugar Industry Award (Continued)
Mr. Bushnell asked that the Stand-
ing Orders be suspended to enable
the committee appointed to deal with
the subject matter of Resolution 338
to make its report, which was in the
form of a new resolution. He said
that the committee had decided to
ask Delegate Meeting to re-commit
the motion carried yesterday with
the object of carrying the following
resolution -which was the report of
the committee:
“That an application be made to
the Court for a variation of Clause 15
of the Sugar Industry Award to per-
mit of the following hours only being
worked by canecutters, namely, for
Tully, South Johnstone, Goondi,
Mounlyan, Babinda, Mulgrave, Ham-
bledom and Mossman mill areas—
“ From the commencement of the
season to September 30, inclusive,
6.30 a.m. to 11 a.m., 1 p.m. to 5.30
n.m., Monday to Friday inclusive, and
from 6.80 a.m, to 11 a.m Saturday,
and from 5.30 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 2
p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday
inclusive, and 5.30 a.m. to 10 a.m. on
Saturday on and after October 1 to
the end of the season.
“And for the following mill areas:
Plane Creek, Pleystowe, Racecourse,
Marian. Cattle Creek, North Eton,
Farleigh, Proserpine, _ Inkerman,
Pioneer, Kaiamia, Giru, Victoria, and
Macnade, the hours shall be from the
commencement of the season to Sep-
tember 30 inclusive:
“From 7 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and 1
p.m. to 5.30 p.m. Monday to Friday
inclusive, and from 7 a.m. to -11.30
а. on Saturday, and from 6.30 a.m.
to 11 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. to 6 p.m.,
Monday to Friday inclusive, and from
б. a.m. to 11 a.m. on Saturday on
and after October 1 to the end of the
season.
“And for the mill areas south of
Mackay the hours of work shall be
as follows:
“7 a.m. to 11.15 a.m. and 12.45 p.m.
to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday inclusive,
and 7 a.m. to 11.15 a.m. Saturday.”
Mr. Dougherty seconded the motion..
The Branch President asked if
those hours would operate until the
commencement of the next season.
Mr. Bushnell said that they_ would
operate only while cane was being cut
for manufacturing sugar. If the mills
crushed after Christmas those hours
would apply.
Motion carried.
Mr. Murphy moved: “That Clause
°O, Sub-clause 7, be varied as fol-
lows: ‘Delete all words in paragraph
after the word “of” in the third line
and substitute the following: The
minimum rate set out in Clause 14 of
this award.’ ”
At the present time the award pro-
vided for a rate of 2s. an hour, but
the Sugar Industry Award should be
in conformity with other awards that .
provided that where employees were
moving from job to job they should
be paid the rate that they would re-
ceive if they were actually engaged
on the work.
Mr. Burns seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Murphy moved: “That Clause
20, Sub-clause 20 (a) be varied as
follows; Delete all words in the last
line of the Sub-clause after • the
words ‘not less than,’ and substitute
‘The minimum rate set out in Clause
14 of this award.’”
The amount of lost time had been
reduced by the modernisation of mills,
but when employees lost time through
no fault of their own they should at
least be paid the rate they would have
received if they had continued on
the job.
Mr. Brophy, in seconding the mo-
tion, said that under _ the award the
employees would receive 14/6 a day,
but that was contrary to the Act, and
the award should be amended to re-
move any misunderstanding. The em-
ployees should be paid the minimum
rate prescribed in the award.
Mr. Bushnell, w'ho opposed the mo-
tion, said that it was their duty to
place as many men in -work as pos-
sible, but if the payment for lost time
was increased the employer would en-
deavour to avoid it, either by in-
creasing the quota or by reducing the
number of employees to whom lost


Lime should be paid. If the change
yvere made probably softie of the
gangs would be able to cut 6 tons a
day while others would be able to
cut only 34 tons a day, and the altera-
tion sought might react to the dis-
advantage of their members.
Mr. Murphy said that a man who
was getting on in years should not be
deprived of the right to cut cane.
Men who had lost time in the Babinda
district were paid 14/- a day, where-
as if they had continued working they
could have earned up to £9 a week.
If men lost time through no fault of
their own, other than the circum-
stances stipulated in the award, they
should not be placed at a disadvan-
tage.
Motion carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution is
submitted from Gordonvale; “That a
ganger fee of 5/- per week be paid
to gangers of gangs ”
Mr. Lewis asked what the resolution
meant, and Mr. Murphy said he
, thought it was the intention that a
ganger fee of 5/- be paid by the em-
ployer.
Mi. Lewis moved; “That the matter
be referred to the Branch Secretary.”
He thought that the Branch Secre-
tary could do even better than the
resolution suggested. Gangers re-
ceived an additional rate under the
Local Authorities’ Award and the
Kailway Construction Award.
Mr. Brown, m seconding the mo-
tion, said that he thought it was
more a personal matter between the
gangs, and that the resolution would
have been ruled out.
Mr. Murphy said that unless the
motion was amended he would oppose
it. He considered.it a stupid one be-
cause according to the reading of it
each man in a gang would pay the
ganger 5/- a week. He moved: “That
in respect of canecutting gangs of
four men and over the pay
a ganger fee of 5/- per week, and that
the resolution be referred to the
Branch Secretary for consideration
when filing the next claim in Court.”
Twenty odd years ago a ganger
fee of 51- was paid by every em-
ployer in the Mulgrave district, but
since then the number in the gangs
had been reduced, and only the de-
cent employer was paying the fee of
o/- a week. A ganger was expected
to do additional work, and should be
paid an additional amount by the em-
ployer The fact that it was paid in
some gangs and not in others caused
a considerable amount of discontent.
Mr. Lewis reminded the meeting
tnat there were other gangs, such as
tramway gangs, and asked whether
it was intended to apnly the rate to
other gangs.
gang's Murphy: Only canecutting
Mr. Boland seconded the amend-
ment.
Mr. Dougherty foreshadowed the
following further amendment: “That
a ganger fee of 51- a week be paid
ny the employer to the ganger in a
Mb'our ” mPl ° yed cutting cane by day
He was opposed to the contract
ganger receiving additional remune-
ration. It -had been said that gangers
did not like the added responsibility,
but he knew of no ganger who had
relinquished his position in favour of
the other men.
Amendment lost.
Mr Dougherty then moved the
amendment previously foreshadowed
by him. It was seconded bv Mr
Crooks and carried.
Mr. Bushneß moved: “That men
engaged in handling and depositing
concrete be paid 1/- per day over and
above the minimum rate.”
Men handling lime received an
extra rate, but those handling cement
received only the minimum rate. The
cement workers were sometimes em-
ployed renewing bridges and doing
work of a permanent nature, involv-
ing the use of a considerable amount
of cement, and there was a good deal
of complaint because the additional
rate was not paid. It was paid to
similar employees under other
awards. It had been paid in the sugar
industry until a few years ago, when
the mill authorities decided to carry
out extensive building operations.
They were informed thev had to com-
ply with the Building Trades Award,
and they then retorted that in that
case they were not bound to pay the
1/- extra to men handling cement on
other jobs.
Mr. Lewis pointed out that they
were asking for only an extra V- a
day, which was much less than the
rate in many other awards. He moved
as an amendment: “That Delegate
Meeting endorse the principle and re-
fer the matter to the Branch Secre-
tary to decide upon a proper rate.”
Amendment carried.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon)., in moving for the recommital


of Resolution 357, dealing with the
payment of a ganger fee of 5/-, ex-
plained that pressure of office busi-
ness had kept him out of the delegate
room while the matter was under dis-
cussion, but as such an important
principle was involved, he asked that
it should be recommitted, and urged
delegates to agree to its recommital
so that it could be discussed from a
new angle and new light thrown on
the subject.
Mr Bushnell seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Address by F. A. Cooper, Minister for
Public Instruction
At this stage the Branch President
(Mr. J. C. Lament) extended a hearty
welcome to the Minister and invited
him to address Delegate Meeting.
Mr. Cooper, who was cordially
received, said:
Mr. President and gentlemen,--I
am delighted to have an opportunity
to address the delegates from the
A.W.U.
I am a member of the organisation,
and I have been for many years. I
came to Queensland in 1909, and com-
ing to a new State I had an oppor-
tunity of making one or two selec-
tions' that I might not otherwise have
had. The opportunity came to me
then to select the organisation to
which I might attach myself in the
industrial sphere. I was working
with a big industrial concern, and I
was eligible to join one of two or-
ganisations that were operating
within that concern.
The Soul of Unionism
After a survey of the whole situa-
tion I made my decision, and I am
firmly of the opinion--sqme people
may disagree—that unionism has a
soul, and if we are to develop it to its
very best we must espouse the organi-
sation that has paid the greatest at-
tention to the soul of unionism. A
soul is something with aspirations to
better things, and if the A.W.U.
stands for anything it stands for bet-
ter things not only for itself but for
the whole community. It is one of
the unions above all that has been
free of that selfishness that I _ am
sorry to say characterises odd unions
at different phases of their lives. The
A.W.U. has been completely free of
that selfishness that says, “Ourselves
and nobody else.” It has always been
willing to help not only its own mem-
bers, not only the people in the in-
dustrial sphere, but the community
generally, and after all that is the
big thing that should be done.
In my view government should be
an earnest attempt to further all
those things that are the greatest in-
human endeavour. If government has
done anything over the past 50 or 60
years it has done those things that
have been directed to it by the union
movement generally.
Influence of Unionism on
Governments
We are well aware of the political
situation, and I need not say anything
on that score. I believe that the
greatest advance made over the past
60 or 60 years has been in the realm,
where unionism has operated, and for
that reason I agree with you that
the old craft unions, now out of date
in some respects, did magnificent
work in their day, and demonstrated
what could be done by men joining
together for the benefit of each other.
An old gentleman who lived many
centuries ago said, “What great
strength can come from feeble arms
combined?” and unionism has fol-
lowed the advice given by Homer in
the old days when the Greeks were
supreme.
A.W.U. as Educational Factor
Unionism has shown what can be
done by combination properly direc-
ted, and that should be the true and
real aim of government. lam able to
sav definitely that the A.W.U. is a
great educator. Education must be
directed along correct and proper
lines, but I suppose the great diffi-
culty is to decide what are the cor-
rect and proper lines of education.
It should bring wisdom and under-
standing. If we have wisdom and
understanding we need fear nothing.
The difficulty is to decide what is wis-
dom. If we heard a man say, “I am
the happiest man alive to-day,” we
could accept his assurance that he
was a particularly happy man, but
if he said, “I am the wisest man in
Australia to-day,” we would begin
to think that he lacked wisdom.
The real question is, what is wis-
dom ? At any rate wisdom is never
in a hurry, it never attempts to do-
things without full and complete in-
vestigation of all the circumstances.


You show wisdom at your Conven-
tion and at your various organisa-
tions when you attempt to get at the
source of trouble. When you do a
thing_ it is not done hastily, and by
■“hastily” I mean rapidly, without due
consideration.
Unionism Must Progress
I believe that the A.W.U. is a pro-
gressive organisation. Some think,
those of us who are getting up in
years perhaps, that more should be
done. They are a little dissatisfied.
They say, “I was a unionist in the
days and I am a unionist
still. They are still, and very still
indeed. (Laughter.) If he was a
good unionist in the old days he is a
good unionist to-day, when he gets
to appreciate unionism and what
unionism has attempted to do. It can
no more stand still than anything
else It must progress and fight the
battles as it sees them. It must seize
every opportunity and march with the
occasion.
Value of Unity
I have had the honour of being a
member of the Queensland Labor Par-
liament for 22 years, and of course I
have be§n a member of the Labor
Party for longer than that. I have
seen many people fall by the way-
sidm I have seen rifts and divisions
within the organisations, although not
so much in Queensland. I do
know that when we have had set-
backs and have ceased to get the ad-
vantages that we might have other-
wise have got it was because we
fought amongst ourselves, that our
vehicle had been ditched, and that
while _ we were quarrelling by the
roadside other organisations had
marched ahead. The great thing that
we must guard against is to see that
we do not split upon non-essentials.
We s^an d shoulder to shoulder in
the great union movement, and we
can get that cohesion and unity that
is so necessary, they will eventually
land us somewhere.
Improving Educational Standards
During the last five years I have
presided over the Department of Pub-
li? instruction. I need not remind
the A.W.U. delegates, especially those
in the remote parts of the State, of
what the Department is doing for the
boys and the girls. We believe that
we are doing a particularly good
work, and I would not be so foolish
as to say that it could not be im-
proved. It will be improved, and I
hope in the near future to be able to
make even a greater advance in the
interests of the boys and the girls
to give them wisdom and understand-
ing as well as learning.
The things that we have to-day are
the things that we do understand
When we understand a thing, believe
me we will get it. The things that
we have not are the things that we
do not understand. We must have
wisdom and understanding. If we
are to get anywhere in the future
we must have some idea of the way
in which we have come.
Real Meaning of History
For that reason, from now on the
teaching of history in State Schools
will not be limited to the old history.
The boys and the girls will not be
taught only who reigned in this or
that year, a long line of kings, and
what countries fought. That will be
scantily treated in the future. The
children must have some idea of what
has happened in other spheres.
Greater attention will be paid to what
has happened in the world since the
industrial revolution, the effect of it
on mankind and the part that men
are playing in the world to-day.
After all, the significant thing
about history is that it is not history.
It does not tell us what has been the
main causes of the great changes
that have taken place. The man in
the street does not know the real his-
tory of the nations. His education
in that respect has been neglected,
and we know only that which we have
read ourselves concerning the history
of the nation.
So far as children can grasp the
meaning of reform they will be
taught what has been the real cause
of the advance of mankind and in
future those lessons in history would
be taught principally to the sixth and
seventh grades. It is only due to the
children that they should have a com-
plete and thorough understanding of
the real history of any country. If
we can do that I believe that we can
make a further advance and so bring
greater wisdom and greater under-
standing and thus the social advance-
ment that we are justly entitled to.


I have no desire to detain you in
your very important work. I thank
you for the opportunity of coming
here. I appreciate what the great
A.W.U. has done for me, not mea-
sured in pounds, shillings, and pence,
but in the political field, and in its
endeavour to see that the workers
get their meed of justice. If the same
spirit of unity and the same desire
to achieve their objective had been
shown by other organisations we
would have been much nearer to our
objective to-day. There must be
unity, the spirit of progress, a soul
with an aspiration to better things,
and a desire to uplift mankind. I con-
gratulate the organisation on the fine
work that it has done in this State
and I wish you well in the future.
Vote of Thanks
In moving a hearty vote of thanks
Mr. Holloway said that he was always
impressed with the unity that ex-
isted in Queensland, not so much to-
day as in the past. They could ac-
complish little without the utmost
co-operation between the political and
industrial wings. A country was
fortunate when it could depend on a
strong and virile working-class move-
ment. It was unfortunate that on
account of personal aggrandisement
the Movement had failed at crucial
moments in N.S.W. It had never-
made the social advancement that
was expected in the national in-
terests.
He was pleased to hear the Minis-
ter say that industrial history would
be taught in the schools, because
Australians to-day did not know
enough about their own country.
They should be taught of the
struggles and triumphs in the march
forward for social betterment. The
history of Australia was really the
history of the Labor Movement.
Every member of the Labor Parlia-
ment and the Labor Party who had
addressed them had shown a thorough
grip of his subject, and he had no
doubt that they would return trium-
phant again at the next election.
(Applause.)
Mr. Perrett said that he had been
associated with Mr. Cooper ever since
he entered Parliament, and he had
watched with pleasure his rise to
Ministerial office. No one was bet-
ter fitted to fill the high and impor-
tant position of Minister for Edu-
cation. Mr. Cooper had spared no
pains to improve the lot of present-
day boys and girls both by providing
up-to-date schools and in amending
the curriculum in their interests. Mr.
Cooper was the idol of the Bremer
electorate, and that was convincingly
borne out at the last plebiscite, when
he was again endorsed as the Labor-
candidate. If every electorate was
as safe for Labor as Mr. Cooper had
made the Bremer electorate the
Labor Party would be returned with
a big majority at the next election.
The vote of thanks was carried
with acclamation.
In reply, Mr. Cooper thanked dele-
gates for the hearty manner in which
they had carried the vote of thanks,
and informed them that for the first
time last year, on the Friday before
Labor Day, the lessons to the children
in the sth, 6th and 7th grades, were
on the struggle and triumph of the
Labor Movement in Australia. Those
lessons were now included in the
syllabus, _ and would be taught on
every Friday before Labor Day until
someone cast them out, which he
hoped would never occur.
Sugar Industry Award (Continued)
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon moved: “That the following
motion be recommitted: ‘That a
ganger fee of 5/- a week be paid by
employers to gangers in gangs em-
ployed cutting cane by day labour.’ ”
There was a principle involved that
should not be bartered away for
10,000 5/- or any other sum. It would
be a dreadful thing if, after Delegate
Meeting dispersed, it was said that
they had reintroduced into the sugar
industry one of the first causes of the
fight in the sugar industry. The pro-
posal was equivalent to a bonus of 5/-
a week. He remembered the time be-
fore the union movement functioned
in the sugar industry when it was the
practice of the employer to pay a
bonus to one or more men when the
wages were 22/6 a week.
Mr. Holloway: They do it now.
The Branch Secretary said that was
no _ reason why they should connive
at it or endorse the principle. In those
days when the wages were 22/6 a
week and the hours 65 the employers
paid certain men an extra 2/6 a week
which, having regard to the wages
now paid, was a bigger bonus than
was now suggested. If the employer
gave a ganger in a day labour gang


5/- a week extra he was entitled to
demand certain service. The proposal
was the reintroduction of the bonus
system, and the service that the
ganger would be expected to give
would be to get the absolute limit of
efficiency out of the men for his (the
employer’s) benefit. They would
establish the principle that one mem-
ber of a canecuting gang would be
in a position of dominating the rest
when they should all be mates. He
would be the boss’s agent on the job
for 5/- a week, and he would be ex-
pected to speed up his mates, and
eventually would probably be given
authority to dispense with the ser-
vices of the men. The only service
that he could give would be in the
interests of the boss. It must be in
the interests of the boss because it
would be against the best interests
of the men. He would be expected to
speed up. The boss would pick him
because *of his type, and because he
knew that he would be able to speed
up. There would be a few men mean
enough to seek the extra 5/-, and
they would try to please the boss by
speeding up the men in order to get
t£e 5/-~a week again the following
season. After they had fought for
and abolished the bonus system an
attempt was being made to re-insert
it in the award. He did not blame any-
one for moving or supporting the
motion, but apparently they did not
know the history of the matter. The
old men knew it. It was true that
gangers were paid extra under other
awards, but there was a definite
classification for them. Those gangers
did a little time-keeping, laid out the
work, and supervised it; but in the
sugar industry the employer could do
his own supervising. There was no
analogy between the two cases. Re-
ference had been made to a gang of
16 men, but in that case there would
be no need to speed up, because the
ganger could so organise the work as
to give a handsome return to his em-
ployer in return for the extra wages.
If the bonus system was introduced
there would be a division amongst the
men. The men would no longer be
mates. The ganger would represent
the boss. There was no price that
could be paid to compensate for the
prostitution of a principle that would
be associated with this matter. He
hoped that the motion would not be
carried. No doubt the mover 'of the
motion was actuated by the best mo-
tives in trying to compel the employer
to pay extra for the additional duties
performed by the ganger. He did not
think that they would press the mo-
tion, but if there was any lingering
doubt in their minds, he would remind
them that the same old rotten prin-
ciple still prevailed in N.S.W., and
the fact that it continued there,
where the union had less power than
it had in Queensland, should be suffi.
dent. The boss did not retain it for
the good of the workers in the indus-
try, and they would applaud delegates
very loudly if they introduced the
same principle into Queensland.
Mr. Burns said that he endorsed all
that the Branch Secretary had said,
and reminded delegates that in the
evil days of railway construction by
contract there were runners in the
various gangs who were paid 27-
extra to speed up the men.
Mr Dougherty admitted that the
remarks of the Branch Secretary had
placed a different complexion on the
matter. He had not approved of gang-
ers in contract gangs being paid
extra. He could not prove his asser-
tion, but he believed that there were
men who were prepared to take extra
pay with the object of speeding up
their mates. The gangers in day
labour canecutting gangs were given
extra responsibilities, and perhaps
they could be properly classified in
the same way as gangers under the
Local Authorities’ Award. If they
feared that there would be speeding
up with the day labour gangs, then
they should not approve of the ganger
fee. He was prepared to debate the
matter. Something should be done to
compel the employers to pay for re-
sponsibility, and there should be a
protecting clause in the award. He
would not be a party to the introduc-
tion of the bonus system into the
sugar industry. He wanted it to be
clearly understood that in moving his
amendment it was not with the object
of speeding up in the sugar industry.
He did not approve of extra payment
being given to gangers in contract
gangs, but he thought that gangers
in day labour gangs should be paid
a little extra for their added respon-
sibility. In N.S.W. the men paid the
bonus to the ganger. There was a
practice growing up in Queensland
that was not in their best interests,
although it was difficult to prove
that it existed.
Mr. Brophy said that if it could be
proved that their previous opinions
had been wrong, they should not be


obstinate. If they had made a mis-
take in passing the previous resolu-
tion j ey should rescind it, and he
intended to agree to that course,
iiiere was nothing wrong in paying
extra wages to gangers, but they
snail not provide an opportunity
to the boss to speed up. They
should pay due regard to the argu-
ments advanced by the Branch Secre-
tary. He (Mr. Brophy) had opposed
extra payment to contract gangers,
and he voted for Mr. Dougherty’s
suggestion because he thought it was
the right thing to do. While he sup-
ported the payment of extra money
to day labour gangers he now thought
that the safe course would be to
rescind the motion.
Mr. Lough said that he supported
the motion because he believed in the
principle that gangers should be paid
extra on account of their added re-
sponsibility. He felt that if he had
not supported Mr. Dougherty the
men in charge would still have had to
carry the exti'a responsibility, but
without any extra nay. There were
many men in the industry who were
prepared to take on the job of pan-
nikin boss for the mere pleasure of
telling others to go here or go there.
Provision is made in other awards for
gangers, and he did not think they
were introducing the system of blood
money in providing that extra pay
should be given to day labour gang-
ers. He saw no reason why he should
alter his opinion because extra pay
should be given for extra respon-
sibility.
Mr. Hay warned them that if the
speed-up system was introduced by
the payment of a bonus the day
labour men would be expected to do
the same amount of work as the con-
tract men, although they did not re-
ceive anything like the same pay.
Mr. Fallon had directed his argu-
ments towards a principle.
Mr. Dufficy, who supported the
motion for the rescission of the pre-
vious motion, said that at Bingera
and Fairymead the recognised ganger
was a member of their organisation,
but if they increased the rate there
would be a conflict between the work-
ing ganger and the representative of
the organisation. The men preferred
to be under the control of the organi-
sation and subject to the jurisdiction
of a fellow worker.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that perhaps there were
ja number of men in the'industry who
wo.uM not appreciate the reason why
objection was being raised to the pay-
merit of a ganger fee, but Mr. Bush-
nell and some of the other old sugar
squeezers would recall what wire
known as bonus snatchers. They
were ostracised. They walked home-
fiom the fields on their own, ate by
themselves, and seldom conversed
with anyone. In addition, they often
received attention that was not good
for their health. Generally speaking
f 6s t-if We tw ¥ OOc * or ever y farthing
of the 5/- they got. It had been
stated that this fee was being paid
Mr. Dougherty: Me believe so, but
we cannot prove it.
The Branch Secretary said that if
lt , wa f, 80 a very good reason,
why the principle should not be si,
norted. The evil of big tallies by day
labour cutters had not been lost sight
ot, and in preparing a case for in-
creased rates for day labour cutters a
good deal of work was involved. The
matter had not been lost sight of
they had done their best, and would
continue to do so.
Motion carried.
Distribution of Address bv Minister
for Labour and Industry
Mr. O’Shea moved: “That the ad-
dress by the Minister for Labour and
Industry be published in pamphlet
form and distributed throughout the
otate.
Mr. Perrett seconded the motion,,
which was carried.
Sugar Industry Award (Continued)
move d: “That Resolutions-
-367, 368, 369, 371, 372, 373, and 374
be referred to the Branch Secretary.”
De said that frequently the Branch
Secretary circularised the different
districts requesting information con-
cerning' crib hours in mills. According
to the judgment of the Court, the em-
ployers could work men broken time
duimg the crib hour. The 40-hour
week was the policy of the organisa-
tion. Dealing with Resolution 370, the
Branch Secretary had explained fully
on many occasions that the hourly
rate incorporated the value of the dif-
ferent holidays and the other condi-
tions.
Mr. Dougherty seconded the motion.
Mr. Burns pointed out that yester-
day he was informed that he could
move Resolution 371, which covered-
the subject matter of a previous reso


lution. He would like it to be under-
stood that that matter would be dealt
with.
Motion carried.
Mr. Burns moved: “That Clause 25
(5) be amended by the addition of the
words ‘That on the production of a
doctor’s certificate any employee fail-
ing to turn up on shift such employee
be not penalised.’ ”
He instanced the. case of a man
who lived alone six miles from the
mill at Giru, who had taken ill and
was unable to notify the mill man-
agement until half an hour before
he had to go on shift. The mill
management had refused to pay the
extra amount to the man who had
worked for them on the ground that
the employee who was ill had not
given a valid excuse in that he had
not given sufficient notice to enable
the management to employ another
man in his place. A doctor’s certifi-
cate would overcome that difficulty.
Mr. Brophy did not think that a
man who was unable to attend work
through illness or any other valid
cause should be called upon to pay the
extra rate. He did not want the mo-
tion confined to a case of sickness,
but it should be broadened to cover
every valid reason. Of course, if a
man was unable to attend through his
own misconduct it would not be unfair
to impose some penalty.
Mr. Hay pointed out that the man
who was ill at Giru wbuld, according
to the motion, have to travel about
18 miles to the nearest doctor for a
certificate, and in the case of North
Eton, for instance, the distance would
be even further. He feared that they
were attempting to include in the
award a provision that the employer
would relish, and it would not help
the employee.
Mr. Bums thought that they could
get over the trouble by moving for
the omission of Sub-clause 5.
The Branch President (Mr. J, C.
Lament) expressed the opinion that
the resolution would place them in a
worse position than before. Instead of
the employee having to pay for one
shift he was now being asked to incur
the expense of £1 or £2 for a doctor’s
certificate. The resolution would not
have helped the man at Giru. The
preferable course would be to seek to
bave the clause deleted, and then
overtime would be paid in the ordi-
nary way.
Mr. Bushnell pointed out that some
men absented themselves without just
cause, and if that practice increased
the provision for double time would
be wiped out altogether. The em-
ployer would be inclined to fill the
position in the temporary absence of
the recognised hand, and the dig-
missed employee would then complain
to the organisation that after
securing a job he had been put off at
the behest of a fellow member.
Mr. Dougherty moved as an amend-
ment: “That after the word ‘excuse’
in the sixth line add the words ‘to
attend,’ and omit the words ‘to give
either eight hours’ notice to the em-
ployer of his inability to attend or
such notice as will enable the em-
ployer to find a substitute for such
employee.’ ”
He thought that that would prevent
employees from remaining away from
work without reasonable cause.
In seconding the amendment, Mr.
O’Gorman said that in extreme cases
a substitute may be put on to the
fires, but the rest of the firemen
would have to carry him. It would be
impossible to find a substitute for the
engine driver at short notice. The
amendment was the only way to over-
come the difficulty.
Mr. Burns thought that they should
add the words “Doctor’s certificate or
some other satisfactory evidence.”
That was intended by the motion.
Both motion and amendment lost.
Water and Sewerage Labourers’
Award
Mr. Burns moved: “That in the next
application to the Court the advocate
again apply for the same rates as the
Brisbane water and sewerage, plus
parities, and that the matter be re-
ferred to the Branch Secretary for
inclusion in the next claim to the
Court.”
He was surprised to learn of the
difference in the rates between Bris-
bane and Townsville. The- present
rates in the North were inadequate.
The caulking men were compelled to
work in water and did not receive any
extra pay.
Mr. Hay, who seconded the motion,
said that when the application was
last before the Court the Branch Sec-
retary had based it on the Brisbane
award, and he knew that that would
be done again.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) explained that although all
the applications had been based on
the Brisbane award, the arguments


Lad no effect in Court, because the
Brisbane conditions had been secured
under an agreement, and had not
been granted by the Court.
Mr. Burns mentioned that they had
launched several prosecutions in In-
nisfail without success. Men who were
■down 13 to 14 feet in an open cut
were still regarded as working on
the surface, and he did not think that
was contemplated by the award. Al-
though labourers received an extra
rate when they were down 5 feet the
men on the machines did not benefit
.at all.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) pointed out to Mr. Burns
that the parities were paid at the
present time, and Mr. Burns replied
that he wanted Brisbane rates plus
parities.
Motion carried.
Breaches of Award
Mr. Ivey moved: “That the Queens-
land Branch Executive be requested to
make representation to the Minister
for Labour and Industry in an en-
deavour to have the Industrial and
Conciliation and Arbitration Act
amended to provide for a minimum
fine of £5, and that the maximum
amount of fine be increased from the
present rates when imposing fines on
persons who breach the Act and
award. In the event of a second of-
fence being committed by the same
person, the maximum amount of fine
to be imposed.”
He said that in the majority of the
cases the employers actually made a
profit by committing breaches of the
industrial laws, and therefore heavier
penalties should be imposed. Althougn
wages could be recovered up to 90
days, sometimes three and four
weeks’ wages were lost to the em-
ployees, which was to the advantage
of the employer. When an employer
was fined £1 the public concluded that
he had committed a technical breach;
but when a fine of £IOO was imposed
the public and the Press gave it
greater publicity, and the whole case
was carefully read. Employers who
persisted in committing breaches of
the industrial laws should be taught
to obey them.
Mr. Holloway, who seconded the
motion, said that what was required
was not so much a change in the law
as a change in its administration. An
employer who stole £3O from his em-
ployee by not paying him the correct
wages was usually fined £l, but an
employee who stole a pound of steak
from his employer would probably be
imprisoned for three months. Very
often the fault lay with the presiding*
magistrates, and he was disgusted
with the small fines that were im-
posed for the flagrant breaches of
awards.
Motion carried.
Alderman Laurie, Vice Lord Mayor
Welcomed ’
At this stage the Branch President
introduced Alderman Laurie, Vice-
Lord Mayor, and invited him to ad-
dress delegates.
Alderman Laurie said that the
A.W.U. had played no small part in
helping the party to continue in con-
trol at the Brisbane City Council, and
he was sure that they would ’lend
their usual assistance m helping the
Labor Government at the next elec-
tions. Many side issues would be in-
volved, but he felt sure that they
would be triumphant in stating the
case for Labor. He thanked them
for their help and wished them every
success.
On the motion of Mr. Brophy,
seconded by Mr. Dougherty, a vote of
thanks was accorded to Alderman
Laurie.
Crimes Act
Mr. Lewis moved: “That this meet-
ing is of the opinion that those
people who claim that they are so
much concerned about the obnoxious
clauses in the Crimes Act and want
same obliterated should realise that
the only means by which that could be
done was for them to do all in their
power to return a Labor Government
at the next Federal elections.”
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon): Lyons amended the Crimes
Act in the interests of the Com-
munists.
Mr. Lewis said that those who were
so concerned about the Crimes Act
should hold meetings on all occasions
and deliver appeals over the air de-
manding the repeal of the Crimes
Act.
Mr. Brophy seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Workers’ Compensation Act
Mr. Burns moved: “That a deputa-
tion be appointed from Delegate
Meeting and recommend to the Gov


eminent to amend the Workers’ Com-
pensation Act and have the parities
added to the present payments.”
He said that it was when a worker
was injured that he required all the
money that he could command to meet
the cost of the special medicine and
diets that may be ordered by the
doctor.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion,
which was carried.
On the motion of Mr. Burns, sec-
onded by Mr. Lough, it was agreed
that the deputation comprise the
Branch President, the Branch Secre-
tary, and Mr. Hay.
Income Tax
Mr. Holloway moved; “That the
Government be approached to the
effect that no income tax be imposed
on earnings under £3OO per annum.”
He believed that all taxation should
come from surplus income, as was
the practice in many other countries
in the world. A man in receipt of
less than £3OO per annum, especially
one with a wife and family, was un-
able to make provision for taxation.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) reminded delegates that the
political convention would deal with
the matter in Mackay, and any de-
cision arrived at would be binding
on the Government because it would
be the policy of the party. No good
purpose could be served by Delegate
Meeting discussing the matter fur-
ther.
The same applied to the following
resolution.
Unemployment Insurance
Mr. Burns moved: “That all em-
ployees be entitled to draw first
week and not have to wait as at pre-
sent for second week.”
As the contributor was entitled to
only a certain amount of sustenance,
he did not think that it made any
difference whether he was paid from
the first week or the third week. If
they were paid from the first week
the Government need not incur the
cost of rations. The men were en-
titled to go on relief as soon as the
sustenance payments were exhausted.
The men were not asking for any-
thing morO than they were entitled
to.
Mr. Ivey moved as an amendment:
“That the Queensland Branch Execu-
tive approach the Minister for Labour
and Industry for the purpose of re-
viewing the whole system of susten-
ance payments.”
Mr. Crooks seconded the amend-
ment.
Mr. Lough reminded delegates that
the Minister had told them that the
scheme was reviewed from time to
time, and while the Government were
not able to do all that they would
like to do they were extending the-
maximum benefits consistent with the
actuarial soundness of the scheme-
The Minister had invited them to-
discuss any matter with him.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lamont) said that when the Moore
Government went out of office in 1932.
the fund was in debt to the extent,
of £70,000. The benefits to the work-
ers had been whittled away, but they
had since been restored by the Labor-
Government. The unemployed coun-
cil met periodically throughout the
year with the object of considering
whether further benefits could not be-
conferred on the beneficiaries, but
the fund had to be maintained in an
actuarially sound condition. They had
to be prepared for any sudden drain
upon the fund. A person entitled to-
-3i weeks’ sustenance was paid the
first week. A person entitled to sus-
tenance for a period from 3i to 7
weeks received it the second week,,
and a person entitled to more than 7
weeks’ sustenance had to wait until
the third week. They should bear in.
mind that the Unemployment Relief
Fund and Unemployment Insurance
Fund were two distinct funds. The
actuaries had been asked to examine
the fund to ascertain whether the-
waiting time could be reduced, but
their report had convinced the Coun-
cil that it would be unwise to do so.
The maximum amount of benefits
were provided from time to time. The
bulk of the sustenance was paid to
members of their organisation. Many
of them had expressed their willing-
ness to increase their premiums in re-
turn for improved benefits, but the
reply to that was that there would be
an outcry on the part of contributors
who could never benefit under the
scheme. The following table showed

Most of the labourers and the metalliferous miners would be mem-
bers of the A.W.U. The coal miners and the waterside workers operated
under a special arrangement. The total amount of sustenance paid was
£460,000. An an industry basis the figures were:
The figures indicated the im-
mense bearing that the scheme had on
their organisation, and he could as-
sure delegates that the Minister, as
chairman of the Unemployed Council,
would extend the maximum amount
of benefits to the beneficiaries. The
payments by outside employees in
1936-37, other than from Crown em-
ployees, amounted to only £147,744,
whereas Crown employees contributed
under £40,000. Those who contributed
the £147,000 would* in many cases,
be in positions as permanent as Crown
employees. The employers contributed
a like amount —outside employers
£147,000 and the Crown £40,000, and
in addition the whole of the contri-
butions were endowed to the extent
of one-third by the Crown, making
the total £560,000 per year.
Mr. Ivey said that there were many
instances where sustenance payment
was withheld for a time because the
employers had failed to provide the
essential books.
The Branch President said that the
Department of Labour and Industry
would attend to cases like that.
Mr. Ivey said that he had been in-
formed by the department that no
penalty had been imposed upon any
employer for that offence, and he
thought that they should be penal-
ised in some way when they failed to
provide the books. There was not the
slightest doubt that the unemploy-
ment insurance scheme was a splen-
did one.
Mr. Brophy said that the amend-
ment was too sweeping.


Mr. Ivey then suggested that he
would withdraw his amendment and
move in its stead that the executive
interview the Minister regarding the
anomalies and the failure to observe
the Act
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) reminded delegates that last
year he had suggested that delegates
should not wait until Delegate Meet-
ing, but should immediately submit
their complaints to the unemployed
council, on which he represented the
workers. He made that suggestion
again and assured them that all mat-
ters would be promptly submitted to
the council.
Amendment and Motion Withdrawn
Mr. Hay said that, in view of the
explanation by the Branch President,
and the fact that the Mackay Con-
vention would be dealing with these
matters within a few weeks, he
moved: “That resolutions 392 to 396,
both inclusive, 398, 400 to 404, both
inclusive, and 407 and 408 be referred
to the Branch Secretary.”
Mr. Bushnell seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Rules
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution js
submitted from Tinenburra: “For six
months in the year two additional or-
ganisers be employed for the purpose
of policing the award of the pastoral
industry.”
There are more organisers in the
pastoral industry than there have
been for many years.
The following resolution is sub-
mitted from Malboona station: “That
Branch Secretary Fallon be instruct-
ed to strenuously oppose application
now before the Court re Rule 124.”
That was done previously and al-
ways is done.
The following resolution is sub-
mitted from EuloL station: “That or-
ganisers visit the pastoral districts
twice a year.”
I am sure that the organisers visit
the pastoral districts very much more
often than that.
A number of resolutions involved
an alteration of rules, and these could
only be considered by Convention.
The Branch President: The follow-
ing resolution is submitted from
Tully.
We, the A.W.U. members of Tully,,
call upon the Innisfail Membership.
Rights Committee to disband or to
alienate itself from the Communist
Party and thus get back into the
political movement of the A.W.U. as
defined in Rules 31 and 98 of the Con-
stitution, as it is evident to us that
the Membership Rights Committee is
of the Communist Party using that
party’s sheet, the “North Queensland
Guardian,” as its official organ, as
evidenced by reports appearing there-
in emanating from the Innisfail Com-
mittee. We hold that the “Guardian”
is anti-Labor, so it is anti-union, at-
tempting to induce sections of unions
to depart from the policy of arbitrat-
ion laid down by the majority of the'
members of such unions.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved: —
“That this Delegate Meeting
endorses the sentiments ex-
pressed in Resolution 445 and
congratulates the workers of
Tully upon their expression of
Labor principles as contained in
the resolution.”
He said that the people at Tully
were in an excellent position to judge
as to the value of the persons who
styled themselves “Innisfail Member-
ship Rights Committee” because they
were close to them and had an oppor-
tunity of watching their activities
and so had expressed their opinions
through the resolution. That opinion
was consistent with the opinion of
every Labor man and unionist. He
did not know what the people at In-
nisfail hoped to achieve by their ac-
tivities. They could not hope to
achieve anything good for the class
to which they (the working class)
belonged.
Despite what might be said to
the contrary by speakers on be-
half of this section, they knew
that throughout the year they
were viciously active in anti-
union propaganda.
It was important for the wage
earners of Queensland to know that
while the most militant unionists, us-
ing the term in its proper sense, were
desperately anxious to secure a 40-
hour week throughout the Common-
wealth and were using their best
endeavours to provide the only
means whereby it was possible
to consummate that ideal by


J. C. LAMONT
Branch President 1933-1938




the election of a Federal Labor
Government, the Innisfail Mem-
bership Rights Committee did
everything that they possibly could
to prevent the return of a Federal
Labor Government and in so doing
were assisting the traditional ene-
mies of the working class and inci-
dentally preventing the consumma-
tion of a 40-hour week.
It was true that the Member-
ship Rights Committee at Innis-
fail had been guilty of publishing
matter that no other anti-Labor
organisation would dare to pub-
lish.
Doing the Work of the Tories
Their Tory colleagues in the anti-
Labor political parties would be
liable to be skull-dragged into Court
for criminal libel if they published
the same sort of stuff, but these men
of straw were doing the filthy work
that the “dinkum” Tory dared not do,
and it was no use dragging
these individuals into Court because
there was no way of punishing them.
It had often been said to him that
there must be some truth in what
they were saying, otherwise his or-
ganisation would have taken them to
Court, but there was no way of re-
covering damages from them. They
could take action for criminal libel
but so far as he had been able to
discover there had never been a suc-
cessful prosecution for criminal libel
in any Court in this State. The
chances of success were always re-
mote no matter how serious the of-
fence. It was very costly in initiate
the proceedings. The Innisfail
people were hiding behind the fact
that there was no way of compelling
them to pay.
In a case just decided in the Court
in Townsville people of this kind were
able to hire barristers and send re-
presentatives to Melbourne to fight
for them in the Courts. Apparently
they had any amount of money to
pay legal gentlemen and to travel
round the country and they did not
get that from the rank and file of
the working class. They had pub-
lished in the press some of the re-
sults of some of their collections, but
they would hardly pay for stationery.
It came from some source that was
obviously anti-Labor.
They could command large
sums of money to enable them to
employ barristers and solicitors
in the Court at any time to fight
a case of any length, and people
did not make big funds available
for this purpose lightly.
Always Against the Labor
Movement
Whoever was finding the money
was getting a service that was
directed against the Labor Movement.
They had had experience of some of
these men at their Convention. Some
of them he knew had hardly earned
enough to pay for a union ticket and
tobacco yet they were able to travel
round the country and do very nicely
for themselves. The wage earners
of this State would have to consider
those things. It was necessary for
them to inquire from whence the
funds came. These individuals had
any amount of funds and the people
supplying them naturally were get-
ting the service. These facts should
be stressed all the time and they
should be asked where they got their
money. They should be asked to pub-
lish some balance sheets. They had
said on innumerable occasions that
they did not publish balance sheets.
Did Not Balance
He remembered seeing one balance
sheet at Mt. Isa but it did not
balance. That was the kind of thing
that they were up against. Obviously,
the enemies of the working class re-
cognised that they had no hope of
beating the Labor Party. Its organi-
sation was solid and it was as certain
as the sun would rise to-morrow that
Labor would eventually capture the
Commonwealth Parliament. Their
enemies knew that if they captured
the Commonwealth Parliament big
business and big financial institutions
m the Commonwealth would be in
jeopardy. The big financial institu-
tions, the big employers of labour
dreaded the return of a Federal Labor
Government, and when they could not
beat them fairly they were trying to
white-ant the Movement. They hoped
to create dissension in the ranks of
Labor.


Big business, of which the Innis-
fail Membership Rights Committee
was an offshoot, was the source from
which these very substantial sums
came. (Applause.)

Rules (continued)
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament:) The following resolution
is still under consideration:—
We, the A.W.U. members of Tully
call upon the Innisfail Membership
Rights Committee to disband or to
alienate itself from the Communist
Party and thus get back into the
political movement of the. A.W.U. as
defined in Rules 31 and 98 of the Con-
stitution, as it is evident to us that
the Membership Rights Committee is
of the Communist Party using that
party’s sheet, the “North Queensland
Guardian,” as its official organ, as
evidenced by reports appearing there-
in emanating from the Innisfail Com-
mittee. AVe hold that the “Guardian”
is anti-Labor, so it is anti-union, at-
tempting to induce sections of unions
to depart from the policy of arbitra-
tion laid down by the majority of the
members of such unions.
Mr. Hay, in seconding the motion,
said that he knew the circumstances
under which the resolution had been
adopted, and he congratulated the
members of Tully on their action. He
knew that in the Tully, Mourilyan,
and South Johnstone areas there had
been an intense and bitter campaign
against the union and its officials, but
despite that the rank and file mem-
bers of the A.W.U. at Tully had fin-
ally decided that the Membership
Rights Committee must go.
Giving a short outline of the his-
tory of this committee, he said that
in 1935 he went to the Burdekin area
where the rank and file committee
had virtually complete control, and it
became necessary for him to take ac-
tion to counteract its activities. He
had the full support of the Branch
Executive and Branch Secretary, but
later it was necessary for Mr. Fallon
to visit Ayr to carry on the scrap
against the A.W.U., and during the
five or six weeks of struggle he came
to know some of the people operating
in connection with the rank and file
committee.
He had had a similar experience
at Ingham where, under the cloak of
dealing with Weil’s disease, this com-
mittee had attempted to smash the
prestige of the A.W.U., but as the
result of action that the A.W.U. took
they were not able to demonstrate
that the policy of the union was not
dictated by its officials but by the
rank and file members, and that it
should be given effect to.
Later on, at Innisfail with Mr.
Bushnell, they went through the same
bitter experience, where they found
the same outfit organised against the
A.W.U.
During seven or eight weeks
of intense struggle, w'hen it was
almost impossible to say who
were their friends because of the
tactics adopted by those opposed
to them, they were able to demon-
strate again that the soul and the
spirit of the A.W.U. was sound
and its policy correct.
Having driven these rats from their
holes, the Membership Rights Com-
mitee found its origin and birth, the
object being not so much to preach
the policy of direct action but the
policy of the destruction of those who
believed in the principle of arbitra-
tion. It was their determination to
secure the return to the executive
positions in the union of people who
supported the policy of direct action.
Throughout the length and breadth of
the North a campaign of vilification


against the A.W.U. and its executive
officers was carried on unceasingly
and propaganda flowed from such
sheets as “The Rep,” “The Plod,”
“The Sugar Squeezer,” and these and
other scurrilous pamphlets were cir-
culated freely.
These propagandist activities were
now supported by a new journal pub-
lished in the North known as the
“North Queensland Guardian.” It
claimed to support unionsm and to
support Labor, but it was a singu-
lar thing that after 25 victimisation
cases had been heard in the North
and they were successful in having
every man returned to his employ-
ment without the loss of a single
day’s pay, not one of those papers
mentioned the matter. Under the
policy of their opponents it would
have been necessary to resort to a
strike to have those men reinstated,
but they ignored the fact that the
A.W.U. had been successful in having
them reinstated in accordance with
the principle of arbitration.
Not one of those papers men-
tioned the fact that the A.W.U.
had achieved the beneficial re-
sults for its members.
Production of Balance Sheets
Reference had been made to the
balance sheets of the Communists
operating in North Queensland. They
knew that the Communists were able
to collect large sums of money from
some source or other. They had been
asked to produce their balance sheets
both in “The Worker” and “The
Clarion,” but they were not game to
do so, nor would they send an item-
ised list of receipts and expenditure
to those who had contributed to their
funds. Later he saw a letter ad-
dressed by one of the leaders of the
Communist Party in Townsville to a
person who had contributed to their
funds, thanking that person for the
money that he had contributed, but
apologising for the fact that they
were not able to produce their balance
sheets except to known friends. He
had a photographic copy of that let-
ter. He noted that in the petition
read that morning the name of Jack
Nolan and his satellites, against
whom he had to scrap in the Burde-
kin since 1935. He did not want to
be hard on Nolan, but he would point
out that there were over 2000 men
working on the Burdekin and he
was sure that they had canvassed the
district thoroughly and had gone to
the utmost limits to obtain the sig-
natures to the petition. The same
could be said of other districts.
These people had looked for a
scrap; they had got it, and were
now squealing like rats as they
always did when they were forced
into the position of having to ac-
cept the policy of the A.W.U.
He had much pleasure in seconding
the motion.
The motion was carried.
White Anting Tactics Resented
Mr. Bushnell then moved: “That
Delegate Meeting endorse the senti-
ments contained in the following re-
solution, also from Tully: ‘We,
the A.W.U. members of Tully, have
no confidence in the section commit-
tee elected at the pre-sessional meet-
ing. The committee was elected to
assist the organiser in his duties, and
we consider, after hearing the organi-
ser’s report, that the committee has
miserably failed in carrying out the
duties we imposed on it. On the con-
members of the committee
have indulged in white-anting tactics
to the detriment of the strength of
our union, in that they have carried
out the behests of the Communist
Party, which is the enemy of our
union and the Labor Movement.,’ ”
Mr. Bushnell, who endorsed the
sentiments contained in the resolu-
tion, said that a definite effort had
been made to force these committees
on to the workers in these districts,
and it was all part and parcel of
scurrilous propaganda. It was the ob-
ject of their opponents to obtain posi-
tions on section committees for .the
avowed purpose of hamstringing the
union officials in those districts.
They would tell the tale that the job
was rather big for the officials, and
that if the members of the union
elected their opponents they would be
of considerable advantage to the of-
ficials in helping to police the
awards, etc. The average member in
the various mill areas did not want
to be bothered with the committees,
and the result was that the member
selected was usually hostile to the or-
ganisation. The elected person was
usually out to discredit the union and
the Movement, as well as the offi


cials. They did everything possible to
keep the information away from the
officials.
The members at Tully had had
an experience ot them extending
over iwo years, ana after care-
fully considering it at a very big
meeting and discovering the real
objective of these people they
had decided to submit their reso-
lutions.
They had realised that the mem-
bers of the Membership Bights Com-
mittee had done everything they pos-
sibly could to retard the work of the
organisation and nothing to help it.
It was the intention of the Tully
members to warn members in other
districts to be on their guard, and
that when they elected members to
the section committees they should be
sure of their bona tides and elect only
those who had the real interests
and welfare of their fellow members
at heart, who would be prepared to
do the job they were elected to do
and would keep off the union-wreck-
ers, whose only object was to bring
the union movement as they under-
stood it into contempt and so pre-
vent its working as it was intended
to work.
In seconding the motion, Mr.
Boland said that in the Far Northern
portions of the State before the com-
mencement of the season it would be
announced tha, a general meeting
would be held, and after accusing the
officials of neglecting their duties a
resolution would be carried to the
effect that a local committee be ap-
pointed.
In not one instance where a
local committee had been elected
was there appointed a man who
was not hostile to the organisa-
tion or the aims of the union.
The committee was formed under
the pretence of assisting the organiser
or officials in the district to carry out
their duties, but in fact it was in
compliance with an instruction that
had been issued to the supporters of
the Communist Party throughout
Australia. It was for the avowed
purpose of bringing about the dissen-
sion required in the ranks of the
A.W.U. by the anti-Labor forces.
Generally speaking, the decent mem-
bers of the organisation did not want
to be interfered with by these people,
and they were prepared to leave their
welfare in the hands of their elected
officials. Outsiders would be astound-
ed at the arrears of wages the
A.W.U. officials had been able to col-
lect on behalf of their members. The
officials were always able to bring
about a rectification of the grievances
of members so long as they were
supplied with all the relevant infor-
mation. Last year, arrears of wages
amounting to over £2OOO been
collected on behalf of members
throughout the various districts, ex-
tending from the far-flung mineral
fields to the closely settled sugar
areas and embracing every other in-
dustry.
The people of Tully, after ex-
amining the work of these commit-
tees had realised that they were
constituted by persons who were
determined to hinder the work of
the organisation, and it should
not be allowed to continue.
The motion was carried.
“Worker’' Newspaper
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution is
submitted by Heather Shed: “As
stated by Mr. Lament at the Twenty-
fourth Annual Delegate Meeting,
‘That “The Worker” be used for
propaganda and politically educate
the rank and file in the right manner,
instead of using it to attack intellec-
tual members of the rank and file,
and also the paper to be used in
propaganda against war.’ ”
He denied that he had said that
“The Worker” had been used to at-
tack intellectual members of the rank
and file or that it should be used in
support of war. The resolution was
merely a scurrilous attack on him.
The next resolution was submitted
by the Mourilyan canecutters: “That
the name of the Worker Building
should not be changed.”
The Branch President said that the
subject matter of the resolution was
in somewhat the same position as the
universal tally. The matter had been
dealt with by Convention last year, a
resolution carried, and he ruled that
it was not competent for Delegate
Meeting to discuss it. The matter
must remain in abeyance until the
next Convention.
Miscellaneous (General)
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) ruled that the following re-
solution: “That the A.W.U. affiliate
with the A.C.T.U”—was a matter for
Convention.


The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved that the following re-
solution from Innisfail—“That an ad-
ditional organiser be elected to the
Innisfail district, and that one of the
organisers be always at the office”—
be referred to the Branch Executive.
Mr. Hay seconded the motion,
which wag carried.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved that the following reso-
lution from Mourilyan canecutters—
“That a girl be employed in the
A.W.U. Office in Innisfail”—be re-
ferred to the Branch Executive.
Mr. Dougherty seconded the mo-
tion, which was carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Laniont) ruled that the following reso-
lution was a matter for Convention:
“That this meeting of A.W.U. mem-
bers request Delegate Meeting and
Convention to use their best en-
deavours to have the A.W.U. affili-
ated with the A.C.T.U., as we think
this move to be in the best interests
of the progress and unity of the
working class.”
Mr. Hay moved: “That Resolutions
465 to 472, both inclusive, and 477 to
479, both inclusive, be referred to the
Branch Executive.”
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) seconded the motion and ex-
plained to delegates that a weekly
rate for plymill work had been in-
cluded in the last application to the
Court.
Motion carried.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament): The following resolution is
submitted by Murgon Butter Factory:
“That the A.W.U. make an effort to
have a price for all primary products
based on the cost of production at
award rates established throughout
Australia.”
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) said that anyone who desired
to make a real effort to see that the
primary producer got a reasonable re-
turn for his labour should endeavour
to return a Federal Labor Govern-
ment, because it was pledged to a
rural policy similar to that in opera-
tion in Queensland. If a Federal
Labor Government was returned there
was no doubt that the primary pro-
ducers throughout Australia would re-
ceive a higher return for their labour,
because in Queensland, under a
Labor Government, with a sound rural
policy, the primary producers en-
joyed a higher return than their
brethren in any of the other States.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament); The following resolution is
also submitted by Murgon Butter
Factory: “That the Price Fixing
Commissioner inquire into prices at
Manabah and fix price of meat, bread,
and groceries at that centre.”
He mentioned that it was at his
instigation that the Commissioner of
Prices was giving attention to these
matters in some of the smaller towns.
The next resolution was submitted
by Murgon—“That Delegate Meeting
instruct A.W.U. delegates to Labor-
in-Politics Convention to oppose
abolition of plebiscites in selection of
candidates.”
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) ruled that it was not com-
petent tor Delegate Meeting to in-
struct delegates to the Labor-in-
Politics Convention, because it had
been ruled for many years that the
delegates could not be instructed.
The next resolution, which also
came from Murgon, read: “That
Delegate Meeting make representa-
tions to the Minister to have the
awards policed better in country dis-
tricts.”
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) pointed out that while the
Department had been under the con-
trol of Mr. Hynes there had been a
substantial increase in the number of
industrial inspectors with the best
equipment to enable them to travel
throughout the country. Although he
had submitted many difficult matters
to the Director of Labour, he (the
Director of Labour) had not failed on
any occasion to give favourable con-
sideration where it was merited. On
no occasion was the department to
blame if adequate attention had not
been given in all cases.
Mr Brown moved: “That the Indus-
trial Court deal more quickly with
claims and that members of Industrial
Court do no other work.”
He said that the sponsors of the
resolution had pointed out that con-
siderable time elapsed between the
filing of the claim and the hearing of
the case, especially in connection with
an application for an increase in the
basic wage.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) pointed out that although in
some cases delay was unavoidable it
often worked to their advantage.
The arbitration machinery in this
State worked with the utmost speed


and efficiency. During the four years
that he was at Mackay there was not
one occasion where a man was dis-
missed that he was not successful in
having him reinstated, and although
it was suggested that if that practice
continued the men would slow up, the
output had actually increased. The
Minister was always prepared to give
sympathetic consideration to any re-
quest for an improvement in indus-
trial machinery, but so efficient had
it been made that he felt that he
would be hard put to it to suggest
any further amendment.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) reminded delegates that if
an application was made to the Fede-
ral Court for £4 a week, and after a
lapse of considerable time the Court-
awarded £3/10/-, which was to
operate for three to five years, and
in the course of time the cost of liv-
ing justified a rate of £4/10/-, the
Court would decline to accept an ap-
plication for more than the original
amount of £4.
Mr. Brown said that he was pleased
to receive the information from the
Branch Secretary and the Branch
President, and he thought that it
should be more widely known
amongst their members, because it
would then remove many misunder-
standings.
Motion lapsed.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament); The following resolution is
submitted by the Brisbane General
Hospital—“ That we urge for the re-
storation of the basic wage to £4/5/-.”
There was an application before the
Court for a basic wage of £4/8/-
Dealing with a resolution that the
Government should endeavour, to
bring the wages and conditions of
the workers back to the 1928-29 level,
the Branch President said that the
union was doing all within its power.
The claim now before the Court, if
granted, would restore even better
than that level.
Mr. Bushnell moved: “That we, the
A.W.U. members of Tully, resent the
interference in our union by the
Communists or, any other bodies
alienated from us, and that we wish
to abide by the principles of the Aus-
tralian Labor Party.”
Mr. Boland seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Boland moved: “That Delegate
Meeting endorse the sentiments ex-
pressed in the following resolution
from Tully—‘We, the A.W.U. mem-
bers of Tully, declare our loyalty to-
the Australian Labor Party, and
pledge ourselves to work for the re-
turn of a State Labor Government at
the 1938 State elections.’ ”
Mr. Burns seconded the motion,,
which was carried.
Pastoral Improvements
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G,
Fallon) moved:
That a deputation be appointed by
the Delegate Meeting for the purpose
of;
(a) Making representations to the
Premier with a view to discuss-
ing the possibilities of increas-
ing the carrying capacity of
the pastoral districts, and par-
ticularly the wool growing dis-
tricts of the State.
(b) Making representations to the
Premier with a view to dis-
cussing the possibilities of
minimising the drought losses
by a scheme of water conser-
vation or by providing facili-
ties for the expeditious re-
moval of sheep from drought-
stricken areas to agistment
country or by other means.
It would be in the interests not
only of the pastoral workers of
Queensland but of the nation as a
whole. The economic stability of Aus-
tralia depended very largely on the
wool cheque, but it was well known
that there was a state of perpetual
drought in one part of the western
district or another. He was not an
authority on the subject, but he was
aware that the average number of
sheep in this State over the past 20
years was 18,000,000, but the figure
had gone to 21,750,000. The average
cut in Queensland was 81bs., and
calculated at the recent average price
of Is. per lb, which spread over a
loss of 3,000,000 sheep amounted to
an enormous sum. They also had to-
bear in mind the considerable ex-
penditure on artificial feeding, the
cost of travelling sheep to agistment
areas, and other expenses associated
with drought. The matter should re-
ceive the attention of the Federal
Government, because it was of na-
tional importance and as Common-
wealth finances appear to be in a
buoyant state, or in other words, that
the Commonwealth Government had
extracted, principally by indirect


taxation, a greater amount than they
required for the purposes of govern-
ment, they should undertake this na-
tional work, and thus avoid the tre-
mendous losses suffered by wage-
earners, business people and pas-
toralists throughout the Common-
wealth as the result of drought. Dr.
Hirschfield had been carrying out
very useful experiments at his own
expense, and it would be wise for the
A.W.U. to take the initiative in sug-
gesting this important work.
He was not an authority on water
conservation, but he was aware that
a more or less complete survey had
been made and a great deal of data
was available to the Government on
the subject of the measures that
might be taken to resist the ravages
of drought in this connection. If they
made representations to the Premier
on these subjects it might stimulate
support from other sections of the
people, and so the important work be
launched.
Mr. Boland, in seconding the mo-
tion, endorsed the remarks of the
Branch Secretary and said that he
was glad that it had been submitted,
especially in the interests of their
members.
Motion carried.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved: “That the deputation
comprise the Branch President, the
Branch Secretary, Mr. Carpendale,
and Mr. Devries.”
Mr. Perrett seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Female Cooks
Mr. Holloway moved: “That the
position of a female cook be clearly
defined under the State Hands’
Award, and that the average of per-
sons worked for be calculated over a
weekly basis instead of a calendar
monthly basis, as at present.”
He said that owing to the omission
of a word, obviously by someone in
authority, female cooks did not re-
ceive the wages to which they were
entitled. If she was cooking for six
employees and 16 other persons she
did not receive the higher rate. The
position was clear in connection with
male cooks, because he was paid ac-
cording to the number of persons for
whom he cooked. In addition, a female
cook often had to do laundry work,
while the male cook did cooking alone.
An employer could avoid his obliga-
tions to female cooks under the award
by sending two employees out on to
the run, thus reducing the number
being cooked for.
Mr. Davis seconded the motion.
The Branch President (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) suggested that the matter
should be referred to the Branch
Executive so that it could be dealt
with when the advocate was next be-
fore the Court.
Mr. Holloway agreed to the sug-
gestion, and the motion was carried.
Workers’ Compensation for Typhus
Victims
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) moved: “That representa-
tions be made to the Minister in
charge of workers’ compensation to
provide that workers stricken with
typhus as a result of their occupation
be entitled to compensation whilst so
disabled.”
He said that a member of a rat
gang under the control of the Bris-
bane City Council contracted typhus,
and that the doctor had no doubt that
it was the result of being bitten by
a flea from an infected rat that had
been caught by the gang. He was
away from his employment for nine
weeks, and as he had contracted the
disease in the course of his employ-
ment he should have been paid for
the time lost. Workers associated
with ambulances and hospitals re-
ceived compensation when they were
off duty as the result of sickness con-
tracted during the course of their oc-
cupations, and the one mentioned by
him was analogous to it.
Mr. Lewis seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Mr. Brophy moved: “That represen-
tation be made to the Premier seek-
ing an amendment of Section 14 (1)
of the Workers’ Compensation Act to
provide that the payment specified in
A table shall not be reducible on ac-
count of the weekly payments during
the period of disablement.”
He pointed out that the aggregate
amount of weekly payments was de-
ducted from the full amount of com-
pensation payable. He was sure that
the Act did not contemplate that, if
a man lost a limb in respect of which
he was entitled to a certain amount
of compensation, the weekly pay-
ments should be deducted from that
amount.
Mr. Burns seconded the motion.
The Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) reminded delegates that the


resolution did not go far enough in
achieving what they desired. It was
not compulsory for the Insurance
Commissioner to make lump sum pay-
ments, and that in some cases a re-
fusal to do so was justified. For in-
stance, a man who was entitled to,
say, £3OO for the loss of a leg might
be approached by a go-getter with the
object of inducing him to buy a ques-
tionable business. That had happened
so often that the Commissioner re-
fused to pay lump sums until he had
considered the business proposal. In
some cases he had refused to pay a
lump sum. It would be necessary to
keep those matters in mind.
Mr. Brophy said that he was pre-
pared to leave the matter in the hands
of the Executive.
Motion carried.
Mr. Holloway moved; “That Dele-
gate Meeting request the Branch
Secretary and President to ask the
Government to make provision in the
Workers' Compensation Act for the
payment of doctors and hospital and
medical expenses by the employer.”
A similar provision was contained
in Acts in the other States of Aus-
tralia. In many cases the expenses of
hospital and doctor often exceeded the
amount of compensation, which meant
that in such cases the injured worker
received no compensation at all. He
did not think that it would involve a
big increase in the amount of
premiums.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon), in seconding the motion, out-
lined the sympathetic consideration
extended by the department in con-
nection with these cases. He reminded
delegates that circumstances would
differ in every case. A man who lost
a great toe, for instance, in Brisbane
would be able to receive prompt
treatment without any great expense,
whereas an injured worker similarly
situated at Dobbyh would perhaps
have to incur a considerable amount
of cost. He was satisfied that the Act
was sympathetically administered,
and in many cases he was able to ob-
tain compensation for injured workers
who were not strictly legally entitled
to it. He mentioned the case of a
worker at Mount Morgan who had
bumped his forehead in the course of
his work, but as there appeared to
be no complications he continued in
employment, but later a disease
closely resembling meningitis oc-
curred. There was a serious doubt as
to whether he had died as the result
of following his occupation, but fol-
lowing upon representations by the
A.W.U. his widow was awarded £750.
Another worker claimed that his eye
was injured as the result of dust
where he was working at Mt. Isa, but
the report stated that that could not
possibly have happened. The depart-
ment sent a man to Mt. Isa to in-
vestigate, the case was reconsidered,
and the Commissioner said that there
was a doubt, but it was possible that
the accident happened in that way,
and the worker received full compen-
sation. He could go on giving nume-
rous cases of that description. He
was satisfied that the Commissioner
administered the Act very sympa-
thetically.
Motion carried.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G
Fallon) moved: “That the deputation
to wait on the Minister in connection
with workers’ compensation matters
comprise the Branch President and
Mr. Brophy.”
Motion carried.
Sino-Japanese War
Mr. Holloway moved: “That we
view with grave apprehension the at-
tack on Chinese national liberty and
assure the Chinese Government and
people of our wholehearted wish for
their ultimate success.”
He said that the whole world stood
aghast at the murderous, brutal, and
unprovoked attack by a Fascist na-
tion upon one of the most peaceful
and inoffensive people in the world,
who never did anything else in their
history but mind their own business.
The aggressor and the nations asso-
ciated with him were looking for a
capitalistic advantage, hoping to
strengthen their position in the world
with the ultimate idea of enslaving
the whole of the democracies of the
earth.
In seconding the motion, Mr. Ivey
said that if the motion did nothing
else but awaken in the minds of their
members and the general public the
bitter trend of world events and the
contempt that Australians should
have for the present condition of the
Royal Australian Air Force it would
have achieved some good.
Motion carried.


GROUP OF DELEGATES TO THE 25th ANNUAL DELEGATE MEETING OF THE
QUEENSLAND BRANCH OF THE A.W.U.
From left to right (standing): D. Brophy, P. A. Nicolson, H. S. O’Gorman, W. B. Hay, T. Brown, W. Ivey, O. Lewis, Branch
Secretary C. G. Fallon, J. S. Hanlon (editor “Worker”), T. Dougherty, J. Dufficy, G. Crooks, T. Holloway, V. Thompson.
Seated: J. Perrett, J. Lough, H. O’Shea, E. Davis, G. Burns, J. Carpendale (Minute Secretary), Branch President J. C. Lamont
(President), L. P. Waller (Official Reporter).

Ballot Paper
Mr Brophy moved: “That the shape
of the Branch ballot paper be re-
arranged to provide that its length
shall not be greater than may be
necessary to accommodate the Con-
vention section.”
The nresent ballot paper lent itself
to ribald comment and ridicule, which
had the effect of causing young mem-
bers of the organisation in particular
to cease to have a proper interest in
the ballot.
Mr. Perrett seconded the motion,
which was carried.
Votes of Thanks
Votes of thanks to the Minute Sec-
retary, the Official Reporter, and the
Press were carried on the motion of
the Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G. Fal-
lon) seconded by Mr. Lough. Mr.
Fallon said that they had had a
rather strenuous time, but he appre-
ciated their assistance during the
sittings.
On the motion of Mr. Perrett,
seconded by Mr. Burns, a vote of
thanks to Mr. John Mann. M.L.A.,
and Mr. J. S. Hanlon for their kind-
ness in supplying free passes to enter-
tainments was carried.
The Branch Secretary (Mr. C. G.
Fallon) moved a vote of thanks and
appreciation to the Branch President
(Mr. J C. Lament) tor the efficient
manner in which he had conducted
the business of Delegate Meeting. He
said that it spoke volumes for the
ability of their Branch President
when they realised that there was no
dissent from his ruling at a meeting
consisting of men with strong con-
victions who carried out their duties
without fear of favour to anybody.
This was the Twenty-fifth Annual
Delegate Meeting, and it was an im-
portant occasion because it marked
a quarter of a century of their activi-
ties. Looking back over the history of
the organisation, it was interesting
to notice the names of men who had
held executive positions in the union,
such men as Dave Bowman, Bill
McCormack, Ted Theodore, Jim Rior-
dan, Bill Dunstan, and many others
who had afterwards occupied high
positions in the public life of the na-
tion. There was no doubt that the
A.W.U. furnished excellent training
ground for public men, and the reason
was not far to seek There they asso-
ciated with people with strong views
drawn from all parts of the country
and under varying conditions. The
Delegate Meeting was an important
part of the union because it had been
responsible for the initiation of the
major part of the humanitarian legis-
lation that had been placed on the
Statute Book principally for the bene-
fits of the industrial workers.
There was 'something that he would
like to bring under the notice of dele-
gates. The White Australia policy was
the most important one for which
they stood, but while they had heard
so much about that policy over in
Papua which came under the jurisdic-
tion of the A.W.U., indentured
coloured labour was employed by the
thousands. Revenue that had been
raised by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment by taxation on the people of
Australia was being used to develop
Papua by the employment of black
labour, which indicated that the pre-
sent Commonwealth Government were
not so much concerned about the
White Australia policy as they were
about helping their political friends.
No Government could survive if it
openly opposed the White Australia
policy. There was a considerable
amount of development going on in
Papua, and on this their twenty-fifth
anniversary he considered it oppor-
tune to say that the time was not far
distant when it would be necessary
for the A.W.U. to extend their attivi-
ties into Papua and carry the gospel
of White Australia and what union-
ism stood for.
Mr. Holloway seconded the motion.
Mr. Brophy said that the rulings by
the Branch President (Mr. J. C.
Lament) had always borne the im-
press of a man with long experience
and the background of the A.W.U.
They were characterised very fre-
quently not only by wisdom and cour-
age, but they were aimed primarily
for the well-being of the union.
Carried with acclamation.
The Branch President (Mr. J C.
Lament), in expressing his thanks,
said that his one object at all times
was to do his best for the organisa-
tion consistent with what he con-
sidered to be fairness to the delegates
assembled. If he had succeeded to
some extent in the furtherance of
that ideal he was satisfied.
Delegate Meeting adjourned sine
die.
