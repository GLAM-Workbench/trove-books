STUDIES IN CATCHMENT HYDROLOGY IN THE AUSTRALIAN ALPS
IV. INTERCEPTION BY TREES OF RAIN, CLOUD, AND FOG
By A. B. COSTIN* and D. J. WIMBUSH*
[Manuscript received April 27, 1961]
Summary
Measurements were made of interception by trees of rain, cloud, and fog
at temperatures above freezing, and of cloud and fog under freezing conditions,
at four sites between 4000 and 6000 ft in the Kosciusko area during 1958-60.
At temperatures above freezing, precipitations under the trees during
windless conditions were about the same as or less than those in the open. During
windy periods precipitations were significantly greater under the trees, especially
at the higher altitudes where the average increase was about 30%. Most of the
extra water collected was from mists and rain; apparently the sparse, large-leaved
tree canopies were ineffective in straining out the smaller droplets comprising
cloud and fog. At freezing temperatures, however, the trees accumulated large
amounts of ice and rime from fog and cloud.
In catchments between 4000 and 5000 ft, timbered areas probably collect
at least 1-2 additional in. of water per year, and 2-5 in. above 5000 ft. Similar
increases could be expected from afforestation of treeless catchments.
The extra water collected by trees is probably not important, in itself, for
plant growth. However, it contains nutrients leached from the foliage, which may
stimulate the growth of subordinate communities.
I. INTREDUCTION
The present study continues the series of investigations of plant-soil-water
relations in catchments of the Australian Alps. The last paper (Costin et. al 1961)
was concerned with the relationships between tree vegetation and accumulation
and persistence of snow. In this investigation the interception of moisture from rain,
cloud, and fog is considered.
Most of the relevant literature reports reduced amounts of precipitation
under trees compared with adjacent open areas (e.g. Kittredge 1948; Eidmann
1959). A given stand of vegetation may be considered as having a certain storage
capacity below which interception of part or all of the precipitation will occur but
above which most of the increased precipitation will reach the ground as drip or
stem flow. Thus, interception losses are proportionately greater from smaller amounts
of rain. Interception of small rainfalls comprising predominantly small droplets
is also greater than the same amount of rain falling as larger drops. Hence, “the
larger the storms the less important does vegetation become in reducing the quantity
of water delivered to the soil” (Colman 1953).

In environments characterized by large amounts of low, moving fog or cloud,
such as humid mountain ranges and coastlines, tree vegetation has been observed
to have opposite effects, namely, to increase precipitation compared with open
areas (e.g. Grunow 1959). Early naturalists (e.g. White 1789, p. 204; Cox 1888)
have provided some vivid descriptions. The cedars of Lebanon and the redwoods
of California are often cited as other examples. More recently, the magnitude of the
increases under trees has been measured experimentally. Increases of more than
100% have been recorded under some conditions (Kittredge 1948). Fine misty
rains with wind are particularly effective. The amount of extra water accumulated
is also related to the height of the vegetation, the area of vertical exposure of leaf
surface, and the ratio of leaf area to ground area (Kittredge 1948). Other con-
ditions being equal, fine-leaved vegetation should be a more efficient collector than
a community of broad-leaved species (Grunow 1959); however, little work appears
to have been done specifically on this question.
The possibility that similar relationships exist between precipitation and
trees in the Australian Alps is suggested by a variety of indirect evidence. Fog.
cloud, and misty rain, frequently with strong winds, are regularly experienced
above 4000 ft. In these areas the herbaceous vegetation directly under the tree
crowns is greener during summer than that in the open, in patterns related to the
dripping of moisture from the leaves, branches, and trunk, rather than to shading
effects. A preliminary experiment with two sets of three rain gauges at 4000 and
5000 ft, in which one gauge in each set was provided with a small branch of a tree
and another with vertical gauze mesh mounted at right angles to the prevailing
wind, also indicated that suitable collecting surfaces could strain out additional
moisture from rain (Table 1).
Periods of low cloud with air temperatures at or below freezing point are
also frequent during the colder months, mainly above 5000 ft. Under these con-
ditions the cloud droplets freeze on contact with any obstruction, resulting in the
deposition of rime and ice. Trees projecting above the winter snow cover thereby
accumulate heavy loads of ice, sometimes to breaking point. Temperatures between
0 and 10°C appear to be particularly favourable (Arenberg 1943).


II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCECURE
On the basis of this preliminary information, four experimental sites were
selected in the Kosciusko area —near Sawpit, Boggy Plains, Piper’s Gap, and
Charlotte Pass at elevations of about 4000, 5000, 5800, and 6000 ft. Average annual
precipitations at these sites are about 30, 50, 70, and 80 in. respectively, with
progressively more wind, fog, cloud, and misty rain.
Measurements of precipitation under the trees and in the open at temperatures
above freezing were made at each site by using a pair of 11-ft diameter collecting
trays, one of which was installed around the trunk of a tree selected for a crown-
spread equal to the size of the tray, and the other in the open. Details of the
Fig. 1.-Diagram of collecting tray showing details of construction:
(a) The tray consists of two parts which are joined together around the trunk of the
tree.
(b) The joint is covered by a strip of lead or heavy-gauge galvanized iron in the shape
of an inverted "V”.
(c) A galvanized iron collar fits around the trunk with which a water-tight seal is obtained
by means, of a tightly wrapped bandage of hessian painted over with bitumen.
collecting trays and the method of installation are shown in Figure 1 and Plate 1,
Figure 1. The trees were chosen within the stand in order to minimize forest-edge
effects. Care was also taken to instal the “open” gauges at ground level, so that
the edge of the gauge did not project above the surrounding herbaceous vegetation.
This precaution, combined with the large area of collecting surface, helped to ensure
that during windy rains an accurate measure of the precipitation which would have
fallen on the same area of ground was obtained (cf, Kittredge 1948; Linsley, Kohler,
and Paulhus 1949).
Measurements of precipitation in the trays were taken between April 1958 and
April 1960. Snowfalls and rainfalls which included sleet and snow were disregarded

owing to sampling problems. At Piper’s Gap and especially Charlotte Pass, access
difficulties under snow conditions also prevented measurement of a considerable
number of rainfalls. At intervals, samples of water from the collecting trays were
analysed for potassium, sodium, and calcium. At the end of the experiments, the trees
were sampled for fresh weight and surface area of foliage and small twigs.
Different procedures were used for sampling rime and ice deposited on the
trees from freezing cloud (Plate 1, Fig. 2). Immediately following periods of
deposition, small branches were cut from the trees, placed in plastic bags, and
w eighed on a spring balance. The samples were then transported to the laboratory
where, after removal of the ice and melt water, the branches were reweighed as
soon as free water had evaporated from the leaves. The difference between the field
and laboratory weighings gave the amount of rime and ice which had been deposited.
These figures were then converted to inches of 'water, on the basis of visual estimates
made at the time of the field weighings of the ratio of the branch samples to the
total branch content of the trees. Measurements were made during the winter
periods of 1958 and 1960.
III. RESULTS
Measurements of precipitation in the collecting trays at air temperatures above
freezing are shown in Table 2, together with relevant data on weather conditions
during each precipitation period. The term "fog” in the last column also includes
cloud at ground level. Wind direction and force arc shown thus: e.g. NW.S signifies
a wind blowing from the north-west with a force of 5 on the Beaufort Scale.
Data for the relatively windless periods shown in Table 2 (wind force less
than 2 on Beaufort Scale) are summarized in Table 3. and data for windy periods
in Table 4. It will be seen that whilst the windless rains under the trees are about
equal to or less than those in the open, the windy rains are significantly greater.
Table 5 shows the percentage of occasions when precipitations under the trees
were greater than, equal to, or less than those in the open. The frequency of heavier
falls under the trees is found to increase with altitude.
The potassium, sodium, and calcium contents of water samples from the
collecting trays are given in Table 6. These consistently show much higher values
under the trees.
Table 7 gives data on fresh weight and surface area of the foliage of the
experimental trees at the four sites, and ratios of foliage area to area of the collecting
trays. The amount of foliage per unit area decreases with elevation.
The amounts of water accumulated on trees, as ice and rime from low, freezing
cloud, are shown in Table 8. In these instances accumulations in the open are
virtually nil.
IV. DISCUSSION
The measurement of precipitation under the trees and in the open at tem-
peratures above freezing involves two possible types of sampling errors. Firstly,
is the collecting tray in the open undersampling the precipitation that would have
fallen under wdndy conditions on the same area of exposed ground? Secondly, is the

collecting tray in the stand of trees oversampling the precipitation compared with
the open area, either because of concentration of leaf- and branch-drip from adjacent
trees or because of differences in microtopography?
The large surface area of the collecting trays in the open and their installation
at ground level makes the first possibility unlikely (of. Section II). The second
possibility can be examined in terms of the expectation that the relatively windless
precipitations should not be greater under the trees, owing to the fact that at least
some of the precipitation should be held by the leaves. Table 3 shows that this is the
case.
In Table 4 it is seen that during windy precipitations a different situation
applies—namely, that precipitations are greater under the trees. These increases are
significantly different from zero at Sawpit, Piper’s Gap, and Charlotte Pass and
verge on significance at Boggy Plains. It can thus be concluded that the foliage
is sieving out some of the moisture droplets blown over and through it.
Conditions during the precipitation periods were frequently such that several
types of weather contributed to individual results obtained. Hence a detailed
weather analysis of the data in Table 2 is not possible. However, several general-
izations can be made.

The measurements included 19 cloud or fog periods without rain, none of which
produced measurable precipitations in the collecting tray, even when associated
with strong winds. The conclusion is that, under non-freezing conditions, the rather
open, large-leaved foliage of the snow gum is an inefficient collector of moisture drop-
lets in the 1/500-1/1000 in. diameter range. On the other hand, the foliage becomes
obviously wet, so a slight accretion of moisture, possibly by condensation, must
occur. Other observations indicate that fine-leaved grassland and heath vegetation
accumulate considerable amounts of cloud water, and in this particular respect they
may be more efficient than snow gum woodland. Comparative studies are needed
to examine this possibility.

Virtually all of the measured increases under trees can, therefore, be attributed
to the collection of wind-blown rains. Depending on the type of rain, the predominant
drop sizes range from as large as 1- in. diameter in heavy storms to as small as
1/100 in. in drizzle. The corresponding terminal velocities of fall vary from about
25 to 1 ft per sec in still air, although actual velocities of some of the droplets will
be much less when substantial up-draughts and turbulence are present. The
increased collection of larger drops, with little horizontal movement even in strong-
winds. would probably not be of catchment-wide significance as regards amount of
water yield, although it could well be important to the economy of plant communities.
However, with misty rains containing droplets down to drizzle size considerable
downwind movement would occur and part of the increased collection under trees
would represent an absolute gain to the catchment area.
111 Table 7 it is seen that foliage density decreases from Sawpit to Charlotte
Pass; with increasing elevation, trees should thus become progressively less efficient
collectors of windy rains. However, both the magnitude and frequency of the
increases under the trees are found to increase (Tables 4 and 5). This situation
indicates that weather conditions, especially the misty rains which are more common
at the higher levels, must be of greater significance than the area of the collecting
surface. The strong influence of misty rains can be examined further by plotting
precipitations under the trees against precipitations in the open for the windy rains
shown in Table 2. In Figure 2 it will be seen that at Sawpit and Boggy Plains the


amount of water collected under the trees does not exceed that in the open until
precipitations are greater than about half an inch, whereas at Piper’s Gap and
Charlotte Pass increases occur even with the lightest rains. The straight dashed line
represents the situation which would obtain if precipitations under the trees and
in the open were the same.
Fig. 2. —Relationship between precipitation (in.) under trees
and in the open during windy periods.
An exact figure for tree storage capacity up to which all of the precipitation
is intercepted cannot be specified. The openness of the snow gum foliage has the
effect that some of the rain, however light, will fall through to the ground. Burgy
and Pomeroy (1958) report a similar situation with grassland vegetation with which,
even at the beginning of small rains, a considerable proportion of the precipitation
reaches the soil.
The increased precipitation of individual misty rains under the trees was
usually less than 1% of the maximum possible catch. This is equivalent to about


0-05 gal of water per pound fresh weight of leaves and twigs per hour, or about
0-01 in. per square inch. On two occasions, however, the increases were as high
as 10% of the possible; these occurred with the misty NE. rains of October 29 and
30, 1959, with winds of 10-15 m.p.h. Contrary to expectation, the strongest winds
were not always the most effective; this may reflect the openness of the snow gum
foliage, enabling a large proportion of the moisture droplets to be blown horizontally
through it.
In contrast to the clouds and fogs at air temperatures above freezing, those
experienced under freezing conditions produced substantial increases in precipi-
tation. The measurements summarized in Table 8 represent collections of up to
an estimated 5-10% of the cloud water passing through the trees, equivalent to a
catch of about 0 ■ 25-0 •50 gal of water per pound fresh weight of leaves and twigs
per hour, or 0-05-0-10 in. per square inch. Furthermore, the collection of water
by the trees during non-freezing conditions seems to be largely mechanical, without
much condensation of vapour to liquid, whereas under freezing conditions there
is a change of state from vapour to ice. Under the latter conditions the collection
efficiency of the trees is greater.
The incompleteness of the data presented above does not permit accurate
estimates of the extra precipitation which falls on the higher catchments as the
result of trees, or of the additional moisture which would accrue from reafforestation.
Nevertheless, the magnitude of the increases measured at the four sites suggests
that in catchments between 4000 and 5000 ft timbered areas collect at least an
extra 1-2 in. of water per annum from rain and cloud, and in catchments above
5000 ft an extra 2-5 in. These are likely to be conservative estimates and do not
include the greater increases in the form of snow (cf. Costin et al. 1961).
The significance for plant growth of the increased precipitation under the
trees is still obscure. For trees themselves the extra moisture itself is not likely
to be of much importance, since the soils in the root zone are always well above
wilting point. However, the greener colour of the herbaceous vegetation immediately
under the trees shows that the water falling through has some beneficial effect.
The results summarized in Table 6 indicate that the higher nutrient content may be
the explanation. The higher values for potassium suggest that most of the extra
nutrients are leached out of the living leaves rather than derived from dust and
aerosols which might be concentrated on the leaf surfaces. In this way the deeper-
rooting trees would enrich the herbaceous vegetation with subsoil nutrients which
would not otherwise be available. These possibilities are to be examined further
by appropriate watering and fertilizer experiments.
