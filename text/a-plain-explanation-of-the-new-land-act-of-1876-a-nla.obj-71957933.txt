PREFACE.
The dry tccbn�calities of an Act of Parliament, altbongh necessary to secnro
absolute explicitness, and to provide against complications in case of disputed
points being raised, are gonerally ntterly confusing to plain men. It is con-
most d�sirable that tbe publie sbould be plaeed in possession of tbe
provisions, described as nearly as possible 1 in tbe langnage of ordmary com-
munications, of any enactment wbicb is libely to engage popular intention, and
of wbicb a tborongh understanding is reqnisite before engaging in any part of
tbe business of life. There is no enactment wbicb is libely, for tbe next few
years, to engage tbe attention of tbe publie of Queensland in an equal dogree
to tbe Land Act of 18/ G ; and as no digest of its provisions possessing any
sustainable pretensions eitber to aceuracy or to completeness bas hitberto been
plaeed before tbe public, tho'following pages are offered in tbe hope that tboy
. iiay prove useful to intending sclectors. This digest originally appeared in a
reries of papers publisbed for tbe information of readers of tbe Darling
B�tons Gazette, and in some places sp�cial reforence to tbe Darling Downs
district will befound; but care bas been taken to treat tbe Act in such a
manner tbe explanation of its worting shall be applicable to ail parts of
tbe colony.
It is believed that tbe r�f�renc�s to tbe Act and R�gulations, wbicb are
ruade at tbe end of eacb paragraph, and tbe very full index at tbe end, wbicb
is so constructed as to serve not only for tbe pamphlet, but for tbe Act itself
and on wbicb no labor bas been spared to ensure completeness, will be found to b�
of distinct value, whatever may be tbe merits of tbe digest itself.
lue compiler believes that be may witbout undue pretension lay claim to
some fitness for bis self-imposed task. Rive years exp�rience in tbe workino-
of tbe Act of 1868, as a subordinate in tbe office of tbe Minister for Lands,
afforded bim a tolerably compl�t� insigbt into tbe d�tails and working of that
Act, wbile a prolonged tour tbrougli tbe Downs as Sp�cial Commissionor for
tbe Courier and Queenslander, cbarged witb an investigation into tbe practieal
results of tbe samo Land Act, furtber enlarged bis information, and several
years of journalism bave kopt tbe wholo subject frequently under bis atten-
tion up to tbe pr�sent time.
The Editer bas taken tbe liberty of submitting this Digest to tbe Hon.
tbe Minxstee poe Lajxds, and bas been favored witb authority to publlsb tbe
opinion of that gentleman, that, � On the wlwle, tins Digest is an excellent
and correct explanation of the pr�sent Land Act, and will I am sure le useful
to Sclectors.?
Ror tbe convenience of readers a copions index is provided, facilitatino-
referenee to any process of the law wbicb it may be desired to refer to at
a moment?s notice.

THE NEW LAND ACT
The following explanation of the Land
Act of 1876, d�parts somewhat out of the
beaten traok, and the arrangement of the
points, successively considered, deviates
very widely from that adopted in the Act
The endeavor bas been to follow what
would naturally arise in the mind of an
intending selector in the same succession,
and with that view we commence with
I. What lands will be available.
IL Who may select.
111. How they may select.
IV. What they will h�ve to pay.
V. What conditions they must observe.
1. WHAT LANDS WILL BE AVAILABLE.
1. For Conditional Purchase.
2. For Hombsteads.
1. For Conditional Purchase.
(a. ) AU Crown lands which imme-
diately before the date of this Act
(Ist March, 1877) were open for ;
conditional purchase under the Act I
of 1868. {CI. 13.)
(b.) Country lands within Home- !
stead Areas. {CI. 38.)
(c. Country lands within the Town <
Reserves open to s�lection under ;
the Act of 1868.
(d.) Any country lands which may \
be proclaimed open by the Gover- j
nor. {CI. 14.)
(e.) Land within proclaimed gold- \
fields which shall h�ve been spe-1
cially declared open to s�lection. \
( Reg. 20 .)
2. For Somesteads.
(a.) AU lands which may be any- )
where open to s�lection by con-1
ditional purchase.
(b.) Lands within Homestead Areas
created under this Act.
(c.) Lands within the Two-mile
\ Homestead Reserve, created by
the Western Eailways Act?that
is to say, within two miles of the
Dalby and Eoma Railway Line.
(d.J Land within proclaimed gold-
fields which shall h�ve been spe-
cially declared open to s�lection.
( Reg. 20.)
(e.) Lands in existing Homestead
Areas under the Act of 1872, un-
less otherwise declared by procla-
mation. {CI. 13.)
; To intending selectors on the Darling
� Downs it will be interesting to know
\ that by the 36th Clause of the Act the
� whole of the runs in the settled district
;of Darling Downs, which were ail re-
: sumed from pastoral lease by resolution
; of both Houses last session, will be open
;as Homestead Areas only. The foliow-
i ing is the official description of the
: boundaries of the district ;
Commenoing on the main dividing range
at Maryland, and bounded thence by Hernies
Range and the range separating the Conda-
mine from the M'lntyre, Weir, and Moonie
Rivers tothe headof Wilkie?s Creek ; thence
by the watershed separating the Condamine
River from Wilkie?s Creek to their junotion;
thence by the Condamine River to the juno-
tion of Cooranga Creek (spelt Gooranga in
the schedule) ; thence by that creek toits
head in the main dividing range ; thence by
that range south-easterly and south-westerly
to Maryland, the point of commencement,
A


The expression ? Country Lands? oc-
curs in the preceding, and it may be as
well to explain what is meant.
Clause 9 makes the following distinc-
tions ; ??
Town Lands.?AU lands winch h�ve
been heretofore, or shall hereafter be, pro-
claimed as town lands.
Suburban Lands.?-Ail lands withintwo
miles, in a straight line, from any town
lands.
Country Lands.?Ail other lands.
11. WHO MAY SELECT.
Anyone?male or female?who is at
least eighteen years of �ge, and cloes not
aiready hold lands under lease.
Excepting married women, aliens, per-
sons not r�sident in Queensland, agents,
servants or trust�es for any other person
with respect to such land, and individuels
who may h�ve entered into any agree-
ment to hand over the land to others-
{Cl. 27.)
Also, lessees of land under conditional
purchase, under the Act of 1868, who
hold less than the maximum ailowed by
this new Act, may make up the diff�r-
ence from land adjoining their s�lections
under the Act of 1868. (01. 23-4.)
The boundaries of the combined s�lec-
tions must, however, be such as would be
ailowed for a single s�lection. (Cl. 24.)
Either homestead or conditional selec-
tors under the Act of 1868 or under this
new Act, who h�ve personally resided on
their s�lections for a year, may make up
their area to the maximum permitted by
the new Act by taking up one additional
conditional s�lection. (Cl. 25.) In this
case the land need not adjoin the former
holding.
Homesteads selectors under previous
Acts or this Act may make up their area
to the maximum permitted for homesteads
by this Act. from adjoining lands only.
(Cl. 50.)
Vide Addenda page 18.
111. HOW PERSONS MAY SELECT.
Tfeere are five diff�rent ways in which
s�lections can be obtained.
fa.) By simple conditional purchase.
(b. J By conditional purchase within
a homestead area.
fc. By simple homestead s�lection.
fd. By homestead s�lection within
a homestead area.
(e.) By volunteer land order.
Wa will deal with these in their order.
fa.) A selector may obtain, by con-
ditional purchase, not more than
5120 acres, and not less than 40
acres. But the Act provides that
in any district the maximum area
one selector can secure may be
limited by proclamation to less
than 5120 acres, but not to less than
640 acres. (Cl. 23.)
Tiras, for example, in proclaiming lands
in the West Moreton district open to
s�lection by conditional purchase, the
Government may, if so disposed, d�clar�
that a single selector could take up no
moro than 2000 acres, instead of 6120.
This proviso, if carried into effect, will
be of consid�rable importance to a large
class of possible selectors. The 25th
section of the Act permits any person
who is the holder of a s�lection, whether
homestead or conditional, under the
Crown Lands Ali�nation Act of 1868, to
maka an additional s�lection under this
new Act, provided his old and his new
seleolions shall not together contain more
than the maximum area ailowed under
the new Act.
Now, supposing a person holds 2000
acres in the Wide Bay District under
the Act of 1868, he would be entitled to
take up 3120 acres more under the pr�sent
Act. But were the Government, in pro-
claircing the land open, to notify that the
maximum for conditional purchase must


not exceed 2000 acres, it would follow of
course that the person in question would
not be able to select a single acre to add
to his s�lection under the old Act. Selec-
tors under the old Act (1868) are, it must
be understood, only allowed to take up as
an additional conditional s�lection under
this new Act (1876) land adjoining their
earlier holding, exoept in cases where they
h�ve personally resided on that earlier
s�lection for one year. ( Gl. 23-4.) If they
h�ve lived on their old s�lection for
a year they are not tied down to
select only adjoining land. There is no
restriction as to the distance from the
former holdings. In cases, however,
where the s�lection is within 15 miles of
the former holding, and the gross areas of
both do not exceed 1280 acres, the :
selector is relieved from r�sidence on the :
second s�lection. Neither s�lection must :
be within a Homestead Area. {GI. 29-30.) ?
This does not however apply to lands ;
within Homestead Areas, and conse- !
quently is useless as regards the Darling ;
Downs and any other parts of the :
colony which may also be set apart as ;
Homestead Areas. {CI. 30.)
Any person who shall h�ve selected a j
homestead under the Act of 1868, the ;
Homestead Areas Act of 1872, or this
Act, may take up an additional homestead �
of adjoining land, so long as the area of ;
the combined homesteads shall not ex.
ceed 80 acres in a Homestead Area, or
160 acres outside one. {CI. 50.)
(b.) By conditional purchase within ;
a Homestead Area. {CI. 38.)
To intending seleotors upon the Darling ;
Downs this is a very important section of 1
the Act, since ail the Downs is to be a :
Homestead Area, and, as will be seen here- �
after, the area allowed to homestead selec- !
tors within such Areas is far too small to '
suitmostpeople. The greatest area which �
can be selected by conditional purchase (
within a Homestead Area is 1280 acres, !
and the least 40 acres; but, as in the last 1
; instance, the Government may fix the
; maximum lower if they please, but
s not lower than 120 acres?that is
5 to say, it may liappen that, in proclaiming
( the lands on the Downs open to s�lection,
( the Minister for Lands may d�clar� that
; no single selector may take up more than,
; say, 640 acres.
? A sp�cial condition (which it is more
; handy to State here than to defer till we
i treat of conditions in g�n�ral) is attached
( to conditional s�lections within homestead
areas?vjz., the selector must himself re-
s side on the land continuously till the con-
: dition of r�sidence shall h�ve been accom-
: plished. {GI. 38, sub-sec. 2.) Eespecting
� this subject of fulfilment of conditions,
; we shall treat fully in its proper place.
(c.) By simple homestead s�lection.
; A homestead may be taken up any-
; where where land is open for s�lection.
; {GI. 39.) Outside a homestead area, the
extent which may be selected is 160
; acres. ( Gl . 40.) In case of two or more
; applications?conditional and homestead
; ?being lodged simultaneously, the home-
; stead will be reckoned to h�ve been first
! received, and will take precedence. {GI.
; 17.) No minimum appears to be f�xed by
| the Act.
(d.) By homestead s�lection within
a homestead area.
The greatest areaahomestead seleotorcan
acquire within a homestead area is 80 acres.
{CI. 40.) He can take less if he chooses.
In fact the Act appears to fix no minimum,
so that a man can take a single acre if he
likes. An applicantfor a homestead must
make a d�claration that he or she is the
head of a family or 18 years of �ge, and
selects for himself or herself. Persons
who already hold homesteads under pr�-
viens Acts may select adjoining lands
within a homestead area, but the old and
the new s�lection must not together in-.
clude more than 80 acres. {CI. 41-50.)
Persons selecting a homestead under
this Act may select a second of adjoining


land in a homestead area, so long as the
two combined do not exceed 80 acres.
Cl 41-50.
In most districts the permission to add
to an existing homestead lands which
adjoin it, and are in a homestead area,
will be practically useless. It is seldom
likely to happen that the boundaries of
a homestead area will exactly touch a
s�lection. On the Darling Downs, how-
ever, which is ail a homestead area, every
s�lection which adjoins the leased halves
lately resumed from runs, or any unalien-
ated country Crown lands, will, when the
land is thrown open, adjoin homestead
areas, and the owners of such s�lections
may make additional homestead s�lections
of lands touching their boundary. But
they cannot take more than will, added
to what they hold at pr�sent, make 80
acres.
Thus the pr�sent holder of a homestead
which touches any land thrown open
under this Act on the Downs, and
which contains, say 40 acres, may take
up 40 acres more of adjoining land. But
supposing his pr�sent s�lection contained
70 acres he could only take up 10 acres
additional.
No person will be permitted to hold
two detacbed homesteads. {CI. 50.)
Eesidence on the original homestead
s�lection for the due period under this
Act will suffice as regards the additional
adjoining homestead. {CI. 50.)
(e.) SELECTION BY VOLUNTEEES? LAND
CEDEES.
Such s�lections may be made within
Homestead Areas.
The land so selected will not be subject
to any conditions of r�sidence or of im-
provement. {CI. 37.)
Volunteers can select outside home-
stead areas ?50 acres country lands or 10
acres suburban.
But if the same land be simultaneously
applied for as homestead or conditional
purchases, these latter shall bave prece-
dence. {Reg. 15.)
PEO�EEDINGS IN CONNECTION WITH AP-
PLICATIONS TO SELECT.
We do not print the forms appended to
the r�gulations in connection with the
aboTe, as these will be obtainable at every
land office and a long exp�rience bas
shown us that not one applicant in a
hundred uses a written form.
The d�claration attached to forms of
application must be signed and sworn be-
foro a magistrate by the applicant him-
self.
The form of application must be lodged
in dnplicate.
The application may be lodged either
by the selector in person, or by bis duly
constituted attorney. Eitber one or other
must sign the Register of applications.
To constitute a duly constituted attor-
ney, a regular form of power of attorney
will be required. Such power may con-
tain authority to withdraw and receive
refundment.
Ihrery application form must contain a
clear description of the locality andboun-
daries of the land applied for, and also
State whether it is surveyed or unsur-
veyed. {CI. 17.)
One-tenth part of the upset price,
together witb the survey fee, must be
handed to the Land Agent at the same
time as the application. {CI. 17.)
On surveyed lands, one-half the sum of
the separate survey fees on eacb portion
will be charged, unless the amount should
be Isss than the regular scale. (Reg. 6.)
Applications will h�ve precedence (ex-
; cept as per next paragraphs) according to
: the time of their receipt. {CI. 17.)
If two or more applicants are pr�sent
at the time of opening of the Land
Agent?s office, their applications will be
considered to be simultaneous. But
Homestead applications will beconsidered
prio� to Conditional applications, and
Volunteer Land Order applications will
be considered to be later than either.
{CI. 17, Reg. 15.)


At the Land Court when the appli- ?
cations corne on for consid�ration, the ;
applicant or his attorney must be pr�sent j
or the application will be rejected, and a
fine of 20s. deducted from the deposit
when same is refunded. (Regs. 3 and 4.) \
Simultaneous applications for the same {
land will be settled by auction at the ;
court sitting. The bidding will be started
at one-tenth the upset price at whioh the
land was proclaimed opened. (Cl. 17, ;
Reg. 7.)
Simultaneous applications, not for the �
whole but for parts of the same land, will ;>
be arranged by such part asis in mostselec- ?
tiens being first auctioned among ail the \
applicants ; thon the part whioh is in most s
of the remaining s�lections, and so on till '
every disputed piece lias been bid for.
(Reg. 8.)
The advance at each bid must be not ;
less than one halfpenny per acre psr i
annum. (Reg. 9.)
The successful bidder will h�ve to pay ;
at once the diff�rence in the first year?s ;
rent. ;
In case of any dispute, or of the suc- ;
cessful bidder failiug to pay the diff�rence :
in price, the land will be re-submitted to ;
auction, and in the latter case it will be !
among the other applicants. (Reg. 7.)
The Commissioner may examine, on
oath, any applicant or other person before
dealing with an application. (Cl. 12, Reg.
5.)
The Commissioner will d�clar� the
acceptance or rejection of application in
open court. (Cl. 12, Reg. 2.)
Withdrawals of applications on the
grounds of the description not includ-
iug the land intended, may, on application
to the Commissioner, be allowed at
the option of the Minister ; and if ap-
proved, the rent deposited less 20 per
cent., and the survey fee will be refunded,
unless the Government has been put to
expense in the matter. (Reg. 10.)
The Land Agents will give receipts for
ail moneys paid in by applicants. (Reg. 21.)
We pass ou now to the next consid�ra-
tion.
IV. WHAT SELECTOKS WILL HAVE TO
PAY.
(a.) On simple conditional s�lec-
tions.
(h.) On conditional s�lections within
a homestead area.
(c.J On simple homesteads.
(d.) On homesteads within a home-
stead area.
(e.) For survey.
(/.) For deed of grant.
(g.) For road closure.
(h.) For improvements.
In ail cases when two or more applica-
tions for any land are lodged at the same
time, au application for it as a homestead
will h�ve priority over an application for
a conditional purchase. (Cl. 17.)
If two or more homestead applications,
or two or more conditional purchase appli-
cations, be made at the same time, then
the homestead seleotors will h�ve to bid
against one another, commencing at the
upset price fixed by the Act or by procla-
mation, and whoever offers the largest
payrnent per annum will get the land.
Conditional purchasers will, in like case
h�ve to compete among themselves in the
same way. (Cl. 17.)
fa.) Payrnent on simple conditional
s�lection.
(h.) Payrnent on a conditional s�lec-
tion in a homestead area.
In these two cases the requirements
with respect to payments will be identical.
The price per acre will be fixed by pro-
clamation when the land is thrown open,
and will not be less than f�ve shillings per
acre. (Cl. 15.)
Every application must be accompanied
by one-tenth part of the upset price,
together with the survey fee.
If there should be comp�tition for the
land, and the price be run up at auction
between applicants, the highest bidder
shall at once pay for the first year what-


ever extra'amount he may h�ve bid. (Cl.
17, �eg. 7.)
There will be ten annual payments,
each equal to the first year?s payment, but
as will be seen when we treat of condi-
tions, under certain circumstances the
last seven instalments may be paid in a
lump at the end of the third year.
(Cl. 28, snb-secs. 1, 2, 3, and 7.)
(c.) Payments on Simple Home-
steads.
(d.) Payment on Homesteads within
a Homestead Area.
In these two cases also the mode of
payment will be identical.
There will be five annual payments at
the rate of 6d. per acre, or at such higher
rate as shall h�ve been bid at auction. !
Thus, if there lias been no comp�tition ;
a homestead selector gets his land for '
half-a-crown an acre in five sixpenny pay- ;
monts ; but if another applicant for a ;
homestead has lodged a simultaneous ap- !
plicatiou, and run up the prioe at auction, ;
he may h�ve to pay, say, three shillings <
and niuepence per acre in five ninepenny <
payments, or even ten shillings an acre in i
five two-shilling payments, and perhaps 1
still higher.
On ail classes of s�lections, the second
and subs�quent year?s rents will h�ve to \
be paid on or before the 31st March fol- j
lowing the date of s�lection, and such \
second payment will be proportionate to <
the number of clear months intervening ;
bctween a year after the date of s�lection !
and the 31st of March then next succeed- j
ing. Cl. 42, �eg. 1.)
This proviso is rather puzzling until ex-1
plained, which can be best done by illus-
trations. Suppose a person to select on >
the 27th April, 1877, his second payment j
would be due on the 31st March, 1878, s
but what he would really h�ve to pay ;
would be rent for the period from 27th 5
April, 1878, to3lst March, 1879?thatisto \
say, a trille more than eleven months. 1
\ He would therefore h�ve to pay about
\ eleven-twelfth parts of the amount paid
| as first year?s rent.

Selectors will h�ve to pay at the time of
application the value of improvements
upon the land acoording to their own
estimate, and any further sum determined
by appraisement will h�ve to be paid
within sixty days of the value having been
arrived at. {CI. 22, Reg. 12.)
Y. WHAT CONDITIONS SELECTORS
MUST OBSERVE.
Under this heading we will first dis-
pose of such conditions as must be ob-
served at the time of s�lection, and by ail
classes of selectors alike, except volun-
teers seleoting with their land orders.
In lodging an application to select per-
: sons must make a d�claration before a
justice of the peace that they are of the
full �ge of eighteen years ; that they
select the land for their own use, and not
as trust�e for any other person ; and that
they are properly entitled to select such
land in addition to their previous holding,
if any. (Cl. 27-41.)
Frontage. ?Land selected before sur-
vey, and having frontage to any main
i road or watercourse, shall not h�ve greater
� frontage than?for s�lections, not exceed-
ing 160 acres, half the depth of such
lands ; exceeding 160 acres but not 320
i acres, two-thirds of the depth ; exceed-
ing 320 acres, whole depth. (Cl. 18.)
Shape of S�lection.? The boundaries
of s�lections, where not fronting roads or
natural features, must be right-angled,
and run nortb, south, east, and west ?
unless the Survey Department h�ve
adopted some other g�n�ral bearing for
that portion of the country where the
s�lection is situated. {CI. 18.)
j Survey.? lf the Government surveyor
J shall not h�ve surveyed a s�lection within
: three months from the date of the selec-
; tion being approved, the selector may
; apply to h�ve his survey fee repaid by the
; Land Agent, and if the survey is not made
fourteen days after that, he may employ
; a licensed surveyor to make the survey
; On approval of the completed survey, the
?: fee will be refunded. ( Cl. 19.)
; Existing Improvements. Selectors
' will h�ve to pay for any improvements
) which may be on the land at the time of
s s�lection. The value may be fixed by
; agreement, or, failing agreement, by arbi-
s tration. {Gis. 22-82, Regs. 12, 22-3.)
CONDITIONS AETER SELECTION.
On Gonditional Purclimes.
We can deal with both simple condi-
: tional purchases and conditional pur-
\ chases in a homestead area together by
$ first simply noting the one only distinction
� as regards conditions, which we h�ve al-
' ready pointed ont.
; On a Conditional Purchase in a Ilome-
stead Area.
! The selector must himself continuously
\ and honestly r�sid�, and no substitute
� or bailiff will be allowed. {CI. 38.)
j On a Simple Conditional Purchase.
s The selector must provide for con-
i tinuous and hon�fide r�sidence, but such
s r�sidence may be performed either by
himself or by bailiff, only such bailiff
\ must be truly in the selector?s employ-
ai nient, and not in the employment of any
| other person in connection with occupa-
| tion of the land, and must also be him-
j self a person who would be comp�tent to
) make a conditional s�lection under the
; act. Eurther, the agreement of such
; bailiff, to serve the lessee, must be in
writing, and a copy registered in the office
| of the Land Commissioncr.j ( Cl. 28, ml-
\ sec. 4, lieg. 11.)
. This point having been�disposedjof, the
s remaining conditions apply equally on


Bothdescriptionsof Conditional Purchases.
Impeovbments. ?During the term of
the lease?that is, ten years?the selector
must spend, in substantial and permanent
improvements on the land, a sum equal
to the whole of the purchase money ;
only he need not spend more than ten
shillings per acre. (Cl. 28, sub-sec. 6.)
Thus, supposing land were opened to
s�lection at five shillings per acre, and
was run up at auction by competing selec-
tors to seven shillings and sixpence per
acre, the person who secured it at that
price would h�ve to spend in improve-
ments a sum equal to seven shillings and
sixpence per acre. Say there were 1000
acres in the s�lection, he would h�ve to
spend 1000 times 7s. 6d.?that is, .�375.
But if the land were run up to 15s. per
acre, he would not h�ve to spend in im-
provements 1000 times 155., but only 1000
times 10s. ?that is to say, �SOO.
Briefly, should the s�lection be obtained
at anything less than ten shillings per
acre, the selector would onlyhave to spe nd in
improvements as much as the land cost ;
but no matter how much more than ten
shillings per acre he had to pay for the
land he would only h�ve to spend ten
shillings per acre in improvements.?
What will be Acobpted as Impbove-
ments. ? The act States very clearly what
will be allowed to pass as improvements,
viz., houses of ail kinds, whether r�si-
dences, stores, stables, or barns, &c.;
yards, fences, wells, and other water
storage, clearing, cultivation, plantation
of trees or artificial grasses, ring-barking ;
and ? any building, �rection, construc
tion, orappliance, beingafixture.? (Cl. 1.)
OEETIPICATES, TEANSFEES, AND MOET-
GAGES.
Such are the conditions which
conditional purchasers must observe, but
they need not spread their fulfilment
over the whole ten years of their lease.
(Jeetificates. ?Any time after three
years from confirmation, if the lessee
shall proveto the satisfaction of the
Commissioner in open court that he has
resided up to the pr�sent time, and has
already expended the Ml amount re-
quired in the whole ten years for improve
ments, he can obtain a certificate of fui
filment of conditions. (Cl- 28, sub-sec. 7.]
A selector who iutends to apply for >
certificate must give notice to the coin-
missioner ten clear days before the courl
sitting at winch the application will b
made, and must also give notice in eacl
local paper in the district. The applica
tion will be heard in open court, au(
evidence on oath taken if necessary fo
or against its being granted. The deoisioi
will also be announced in open court
(Cl. 51, Reg. 13.)
When he has obtained such certificate
if he chooses to pay up the balance o
his rentsin a lump sum, together with th
deed fee, and can prove that up to th
time of making such payment he ha
continued to observe the conditions o
r�sidence, he can daim his deed of granl '
and be from that moment free from a
conditions, and absolute owner of th
land, (Cl. 28, sub-sec. 8.) i
Teansfke.? lf, however, after ol
taining his certificate he does not care t 1
pay up, but wants to transfer the land, 1
can, by paying a fee of ten shilling 1
transfer it, provided the Minister f( j
Land approves. But he can only tran ?
fer to some person who would himself 1
comp�tent to take up a conditional pu s
(vide IL, Who May Select), and the perso i
to whom the s�lection is transferred wi
h�ve to continue to perform the conditio {
of r�sidence instead of the origin t
selector. (Cl. 28, sub-sec. 9.) (
Moetgage. ?After the certificate
obtained there is another way in whi<
the selector may transfer, namely, to
mortagee, or to any person as a trust�e i T
a marriage or other family settlemen j
After such a transfer the act (clause 3 �
says the conditions of occupation (res


dence) may be performed by the mortga- ;
gor?that is, the original selector ?or by ;
the persons beneficially interested in the ;
land under the settlement, or by any of -
them, as the case may be. {CI. 32.)
This clause is not very clear, so we ;
h�ve given it almost word for word. The ;
question it suggests is whether the ;
mortagee can take the place of the ?
original selector and perforai the condi- :
tions of occupation in his stead. We ;
incline to think not, and that a trust�e !
may, but a mortgagee cannot.
Death of a Selectoe.? Should the
selector die during the currency of the
lease, his heir will not be held down to
conditions except payment, but can only
transfer or sell the land to a person
who could himself take up a conditional
purchase. And such second person, on ;
getting a transfer of the land, will h�ve ?
to fulfil the conditions of r�sidence and
improvement, just as if he had been
the original selector. {CI. 31.)
INSOLVENCY AND DEBT.
Conditional purohases under this Act
are not liable to seizure for debt, except
in case the selector becomes insolvent. In
such case the trust�e in insolveucy can,
within two years from the insolvency, on
proving that the conditions h�ve been
fulfilled, pay up the balances of rents and
deed fee, and obtain a grant. {CI. 34-35.)
Expieation of Tbrm.? Finally, if a
selector chooses to spread the fulfil-
ment of conditions over the whole ten
years, he must, within six months after
the ten years h�ve expired, prove his right
to a certificate, and he can then take
out his deed of grant.
CONDITIONS WHICH MUST BE FULFILLED
BY HOMESTEAD SELECTOES.
There is no distinction made in this
manner betwixt simple homesteads and
homesteads within a homestead area. The
following conditions apply to both :
R�sidence : Must be maintained per-
sonally, continuously, and hon� fide, for
five years. {CI. 43.)
Improvements must be effected to the
value of ten shillings per acre. The de-
scription of improvements already given
applies to homesteads. {CI. 43.)
Death.? ln the cas� of the death of a
homestead selector the land will pass to
his heir by will ;or if lie has made no
will, to his widow ;if no widow, to his
ohildren in equal shares ; and if no chil-
dren, to his next of kin. {CI. 45.)
Such successor may, within two. years
after the original selector?s death, sel! The
land, and in the ineantime will not be re-
quired to observe any conditions. Cl. 45.)
The purchaser can pay up the balance
of rents and take ont a grant without
fulfilling any conditions. {CI. 45.)
But if the land is not sold within two
years from the death of the selector, the
heir or successor or one of them will h�ve
to r�sid�. {CI. 46.)
Teanspees oe Moetgages. ?There is
no provision in the act for anything of the
sort with regard to homesteads.
INSOLVENCY AND DEBT.
In no case can a homestead be taken in
ex�cution, or pass to atrustee ininsolvency
during the currency of the five years.
{CI. 49.)
FOEFEIT�EE.
If the lessee of a conditional pur-
chase fails to get his certificate by the
end of his terni, or such further time
as the Commissioner may allow, he will
forfeit both land and improvements. {CI.
28, sub-sec. 11.)
But this is not the only way he may
subject himself to forfeiture. If any
selector, conditional or homestead, fail
to pay his rent at the propcr time in any
year (31st Maroh) he forfeits his s�lection,
but may recover it by paying up the rent
and a fine of one-tenth more before the
30th of June following. Even after that
the Governor-in-Council may reinstate
him, subject to any penalty which he may


think proper to charge. {CI. 28, euh-sec. 2, |
{CI. 42.)
Failure to comply with the conditions
of occupation or r�sidence for six months :
will, if proved, render a s�lection liable to \
forfeiture. {CI. 28, sub-sec. 5, Cl. 47.) |
No forfeiture, except for non-payment s
of rent will be declared until after a
written notice has been served (person- \
allyorbypost)upontheSelector; and such|
notice will State the alleged cause of for- ;
feiture, and call.upon the selector to show
cauge against it at the next court sitting. ;
{CI. 52.)
SALES BY AUCTION.
The Act empowers the Government to ;
offer any unalienated lands for sale by ;
auction. {CI. 53.)
Town lots are to be offered, as near.as ;
possible, in lots of from one rood to one
acre ; suburban lands within a mile from
town lots one acreto eight acres ; suburban
lands over one mile from town lots, 40
acres to 160 acres ; and Country Lands
in lots of from 40 acres to 640 acres.
{CI 54.)
The time and place of sale, and also
the upset price?which will not be less
than, for town lands �8 per acre, for
suburban lands �l per acre, and for
country lands 10s. per acre, but may b�
higher?shall be proclaimed not less than
four weeks, and not more than three
months before the sale. {CL 55-6.)
The Minister can withdraw lots any
time prior to the sale. {CI. 55.)
Sp�cial conditions may be attached to
the sale of any particular lot. {CI. 55.)
As each lot is sold the name of the
purchaser shall be announced, and there-
upon the buyer will h�ve to deposit one-
fifth of the purchase money. {CI. 58.)
The balance of the purchase money,
together with value of improvements, if
any, and the deed and survey fee, must
be paid to the Land Agent within a
month, otherwise the deposit will be for-
feited and the bidder will h�ve no further
daim to the land. {CI. 59.)
The Government may direct that the
value of improvements be paid to their
owner direct. ( Cl. 61.)
Country lands which shall h�ve been
offered at auction and not bid for will be
open to s�lection by purchase at the up-
set price. ( Cl. 62.)
In proclaiming lands for sale the Go-
vernment may make the last clause apply
also to any town or suburban lands.
{CI. 63.)
Sp�cial G�ants. ?Any lands which
h�ve fallen in, or may fall in, to the State
through any exchange, want of heirs, or
forfeiture for felony, &c., may be granted
in fee simple, after notice of intention to
; grant has been advertised for two months
?in the Government Gazette, to any in-
; tended heir, &c., or to any person
? making discovery of such escheat or for-
; feiture. {CI. 64)
> Eoads. ?Unnecessary roads may be
! closed on application, after due notice
j has been given in the Government Gazette,
\ and, if the Mmister thinks proper, in
� local papers, and after a similar notice
� has been conspiouously posted on the
\ road to be closed, at the nearest Police
| Office, Land Office, and Post Office, for
; not less than two or niore then six
� months. A fee of �1 must accompany
| the application to close. {CI. 65, Keg. 18.)
If the application be for permanent
j closure the, owner or owners of the ad-
; joining lands will reoeive rateably their
s proportion of the land in the road in fee
\ simple if the closure be approved, on pay-
s ment at such rate as the Government
s think reasonable, not being less than the
( original upset price of such adjoining
. lands. {CI. 66.)
\ If the application be for temporary
S closure, adjoining owners will receive
: liceuses to occupy rateably at Is. per
J acre yearly instead of fee simple.
> Such license will be forfeited on failufe
j to pay the rent, or may be cancelled after


six months? notice given to the licensees
by the Government. (Cl. 66.)
Sales witoogt Comp�tition.? These
are provided for in two cases. First,
where persons in a new town or village
h�ve made improvements and make
application within twelve months of the
proclamation of the first sale within such
town or village. In such case the owners
of the improvements may, if the Govern-
ment consent, purchase the allotments on
which they stand, at the upset price or
at a higher fair value. Secondly, in cases
where a means of approaeh to any hold-
ing is wanting, or where any portion of
land is too small for public sale, or where
buildings on lands already alienated may
h�ve extended over Crown Lands adjoin-
ing, the holder of adjoining land may be
permitted to purchase such lands without
comp�tition at a price fixed by the
authorities. {CI. 67-68.)
Ee-puechase oe Exchange. The
Government are empowered to acquire by
purchase or exchange any land acquired
under this act, paying also fur improve-
ments. {CI. 69.)
Leasbs foe Sp�cial P�eposes may
be granted in areas not exceeding 5 acres.
Eor instance, for wharves, ? ship-slips,
baths, water or gas works, &c. {CI. 70.)

twenty-one years, and the annual reut not
less than �l per acre. Such leases may
be cancelled after six months? notice, and

claimed a common on a p�tition by
not less than thirty freeholders r�sident
in any township for lands adjoining to be
so dealt with, provided no counter p�tition
more numerously signed be received by
he Government within sixty days after
j the first shall h�ve been notified m the
Government Gazette. {CI. 72.)
\ A commonage shall, in no�ase, exceed 20
| square miles, and may be of less area. Any
\ part of a common may be sold, and the
| Government may add on an area equal to
i the portion sold. {CI. 73-4.)
| The Governor-in-Council may make
� commonage r�gulations subject to the
| conditions. {CI. 75.)

pality may be placed under the control of
the Council, who may make r�gulations,
subject to above conditions. {CL 76.)
[Note.? For further particulars re Gommons, vide
the Gommons R�gulations printed at the end of the
Digest. |
�imbbe Licenses, &c. ?Licenses may
granted by any Commissioner or Court
of Betty Sessions who shall h�ve received
authority, for a year or less, empowering
persons to eut and take timber, dig and
and remove gravel, stone, earth, bricks,
shells, other material, from any Crown
lands, whether under pastoral lease or

granting of any license, and the Govern-
me t will d�cid� to grant or withhold.


Any pastoral lessee may, by written
notice to any licensee, restrict him from

shall bave been sold as town lands with-
in any area so dealt witb ail water re-
serves and streets or roads shall be still
reserved. Tbe streets or roads may,
however, be subsequently closed and sold
in tbe regular way. {CI. 83.)
SURVEYS.
Will be effected by duly licensed
surveyors only. N�gligence in executing
a survey or any false statement or taise
measurement will render surveyors liable
to cancellation of their license.
The fees, for survey of s�lections to be
paid at the time application is made to
select, are given at page 10.
APPEAISEMBNT AND AEBITEATION.
In case of questions in dispute between
any selecter and the Minister, wbich are
not provided for in the Act itself, a single
arbitrator or appraiser will suf�ice if ail
parties agr�� to abide by bis sole d�cision.
Otherwise either party may appoint his
own appraiser or arbitrator, and give
notice to the other party. If the other
party fails to appoint an arbitrator or
appraiser on his behalf within thirty days
of receiving such notice, the single arbi-
trator shall h�ve power to d�termine the
matter alone. {CI. 82, Jieg. 22.)
OPENING OF ROADS.
Within ten years from the date of
application to select any land the
Government may open any necessary
road through it, giving the holder
of the land resumed �% for every �1
he shall h�ve paid for the actual
area taken from him, and also paying the
value of improvements (to be arrived at
by arbitration).
When such a road is opened through
enclosed land the Government will bave
to fence off the road with a fence equally
servicable with the one enclosing the
land.
Until such fencing bas been effected
and notice has been given in the Govern-
ment Gazette that the amount of compensa-
tion for land resumed has been paid to
the land owner, or lies for him at the
Treasury, no final proclamation opening
the road shall issue. {CI. 84.)
Fencing.? The provisions of the Fenc-
ing A et of 1861 are made to apply to ail
lands selected under this Act, and after
confirmation such lands will be considered
for the purpose of the Fencing Act to be
alienated, and the selector reckoned the
owner of the land. {CI. 85.)
Impounding. ?No stock shall be im.
pounded from any s�lection under this
Act, or under the Crown Lands Ali�na-
tion Act of 1868, unless the s�lection be
securely fenced. {CL 86.)
Entry to Work for Metallic Ores,
may be made by any person, who shall,
however, pa,y the occupant for the actual
damage done, which shall be fixed by
arbitration. {CI. 87.)
Crown Bailiffs may be appoiuted to
prevent intrusion, trespass and encroach-
ment, to watch the fulfilment of con


ditions to recover rents, and to take pos-
sesion of forfeited lands, &c. (Cl. 89.)
Teespass. ?Persons in unauthorised
occupation of any Crown lands, or of any
s�lection which may h�ve become for
feited, may be summonsed on the infor-
mation of Land Commissioner, Land
Agent, Ranger, a�ailiff of Crown Lands, or
Police Constable, before any two justices,
vvho may issue a warrant for ejeetment.
Persons not claiming under a subsisting
lease or license, and occupyiug any Crown
lands, reserves &c., are liable, on con-
viction, to a penalty for a first offence ��,
for a second offence �lO, and for any
subs�quent offence �2O. (Cl. 90-91.)
Land Commissionees, Land Agents,
and Licensbd Sueveyoes are prohibited
from purchasing land with which they
h�ve had official dealings, subject to a
penalty of�loo, recoverable byanypersons
who may sue for same in the Supr�me or

Council, and persons offending against
any r�gulation will be liable to a fine of
�5 on conviction, and if the r�gulation
relate to any public park or reserve the
offender may be arrested and fined �lO.
(Cl. 97-8.)
Pf.ej�ey.?False d�clarations will be
considered perjury. (Cl. 99.)
Fraud oe Evasion for the acquisition
of land.?lmprisonment for not more
than two years, and land forfeited, Fur-
ther, ail contracts or agreements entered
into with tlie view of evading the Act,
are void both at law and cquity, and
cannot be maintained. {CI. 21, 100.)
We h�ve now covered ail the ground
contained in the body of the Act in a
manner which, although not intended to
be taken as a substitute for the Act it-
self, will, we trust, be suff�cient to ao-
quaint selectors and others with the pro-
visions most likely to be availed of.
There are, however, a few sections ap-
pended which affect holders of conditional
purchases under the Act of 1868, by as-
similating their tenure to conditional pur-
chasers under this new Act. These are
as follow : {CI. 103.)
1. Any time after three years subs�-
quent to date of s�lection, the lessee of a
conditional purchase, under the Act of
1868, may obtain a certificate, on giving
proof that he had fulfilled the conditions
of occupation and improvement, and can
then, by paying up balances of rent, ob-
tain a deed of grant.
2. In case of such a selectio� passing to
any person by the death of a selector, or
by op�ration of land, it can be dealt with
as though it were a s�lection under the
new Act (vide Death of a selector).
3. In case of a selector?s insolvency,
the trust�e eau compl�t� the fulfilment of
conditions, and, by paying up the bal-
ances within four years after the adjudica-
tion of insolvency, obtain the deed of
grant.
4. Forfeiture for non-payment of rent
may be rescinded eveu a/ter the period
laid down in the Act of 1868, and the
Government may require such penalty as
they may see fit.
T>.


ADDENDA
Since tlie foregoing was in print some questions not explicitly treated of
in the Act h�ve suggested themselves, and are as follows : ?-
1. Supposing a person to h�ve selected 1280 acres, or less, as a conditional
purchase in a Homestead Area, can he further select exterior to a Homestead
Area a Conditional Purchase, so as to hold in the combined s�lections the
maximum of 5120 acres ?
2. Cau a Conditional Purchaser, holding less than the maximum area,
take up a Homestead also ?
3. Can a Homestead Selector also take up land by Conditional Purchase ?
The Editor submitted these questions to the Minister for Lands, and bas
received replies to the following effect :
1. Tes. According to pr�sent arrangements a conditional purchaser in a
homestead area can select a second conditional purchase up to tlie
maximum area (including the area of his first s�lection), provided he
has resided on his original s�lection for one year.
In the case of a conditional purchaser on the Darling Downs, whieh is
ail a Homestead Area, he would h�ve to make the second s�lection outside the
district.
2. A conditional purchaser eannot select a homestead.
3. A homestead selector can take up a conditional purchase, subject to
the provisos in answer No. 1.
Somb doubts having arisen as to tlie right
of homestead selectiors to apply for adjoin-
ing lands under section 24 of the Crown
Lands Ali�nation Aet of 1876, and tlie ques-
tion having been submitted for the opinion
of the law officers of the crown, it has been
decided that homestead selectors under the
Crown Lands Ali�nation Act of 1868, the
Homestead Areas Act of 1872, or the Crown
Lands Ali�nation Act of 1875, within or out-
side homestead areas, are not entitled to
apply for adjoining land under section 24 of
the Crown Lands Ali�nation Act of 1876.
One of our subsoribers called on us last
week to make inq uiry upon a point connected
with the Land Aet. Since then we h�ve paid
a visit to Brisbane, and took an opportuity of
waiting upon the Minister for Lands to sub-
mit the question to him so as to be able to
give our subscriber a d�cisive reply. The
case was this : A selector about twelve
months ago took up as a conditional purchase,
under the Act of 1868; 240 acres of land on
the Darling Downs, The land has not yet
been surveyed, so that he has not had the
chance of residing. Can he uow make an
additional detached conditional purchase on
the Downs ?i e. within a Homestead Area ?
The reply is : No ;he eannot. Not having
resided on his pr�sent s�lection for twelve
months he can only make up his area to
the maximum allowed in his locality from
adjoining land. He eannot under the circum-
stances take up an additional detached oon-
ditional purchase.

Highly recommended by the Eaculty, and acknowledged to be the pures;
and cheapest TONIC yet introduced ; it is the best restorative for the young
wealr, and aged ; it strengthens the whole system and stimul�tes the appotite
and is invaluable for Indigestion, Nervousness, Go�t, Rheumatism, Lever ani
Ague.
It bas also proved a most invaluable and agreeable stomachic to ail suffet
ing from g�n�ral debility and loss of appetite. A wiheglass full twice a da;
will be found particularly grateful and efficacious in ail cases where a cordia
tonie is required. It is far superior to sherry and bitters.
Brisbane, January 3, 1876.
Gentlemen, ?I beg to inform you that I h�ve examined your QUININI
WINE, and cannot f�nd anything deleterious in its composition. It contais
at least half a grain of dry pure sulphate of Quinine in each ounce ; and froii
the quantity of extracts of well-known bitter tonies in its composition, am
especially that of sulphate of quinine, in the well-adjusted proportion of liai
a grain to the fluid ounce, or two table spoonsful, will recommend it in m;
eyes and those of the M�dical Profession as beingoneof the best Tonies eve
introduced to the public.
I h�ve the honor to be your obedient servant,
