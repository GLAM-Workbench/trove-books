DISSENT.

I dissent entirely from tlie recommendation to provide for the introduction of colored labor
into the Northern Territory.
1. Because it is imperative that this continent should be kept free from the racial antagonism
and mixed blood necessarily consequent upon the introduction of colored peoples.
2. Because abundant evidence taken in Queensland proved that European laborers could and
did do the work required for tropical agriculture.
3. Because the same evidence showed that, taking into account the different capacity for work
of the two, colored labor is not materially cheaper than European.
4. Because the only argument in favor of colored labor —“ that it is more reliable than European ”
—can be readily met by agreements being entered into between planters and laborers for fixed terms,
which agreement should be enforced strictly at law. This being done the last plea for colored labor
disappears.
5. Because in Queensland (the only colony in Australia where colored labor is extensively
employed) the abuses are incurable and the loss of life of the kanakas fearful—2oo per 1,000 in the
first year —and the depopulation of the islands proceeds apace.
