MYSTERY MEN-O?-WAR
CHAPTER I
TORPEDOED
JERRY LIEB leaned on the rail opposite the
half-deck and surveyed the twenty-nine vessels
steaming steadily along to the westward of the
S.S. Patagonia. The rays of the setting sun made
a mirror of the oily sea against which the merchant-
men were black silhouettes, silent yet alive. Ahead
of the formation the auxiliary cruiser Nottingham
Castle glowed in the light, gaunt and towering, for
she was crossing the convoy at an angle from port
to starboard, and the sun rays lit the crude stripes
of dazzle painting, red, green, and yellow, struck
crazily across hull and upperworks. At a good
twenty knots she moved restlessly about her slow-
steaming, clumsily zigzagging, but valuable flock.
The Patagonia , crack ship of the Blue Star Line,
was the centre vessel of the starboard line of the
convoy, and owing to the dangerously erratic steering
of a London-America liner who was her neighbour
inwards, she was forced to a position outside the
strict limits of the formation. It was this irregu-


larity which was disturbing the commander of the
Nottingham Castle , and had been the cause of much
flag-wagging and bunting-tossing during the eight
days since they had left Rio de Janeiro.
? Going on watch in your bathing-costume
to-night, Jerry ? ?
Jerry turned to grin back into the door of the
apprentices? cabin behind him.
? Many a true word spoken in jest,? he retorted.
?I?m going to have a life-belt handy, anyway.?
? Haw! haw! haw! Talk about wind up! It
doesn?t take much to scare some of you infants.?
The loud rough tones of ? Bully ? Davis came
contemptuously from the cabin. ? We?d lose the
war if it were left to credulous scarecrows like you ?
ready to believe any lie spread by the enemy.?
? And we would lose it if it were left to blunder-
ing idiots like you, Bully Davis, who would run
open-eyed into any silly snare set by the Huns.
You went pretty white when you heard St. Paul?s
Rocks were in sight, anyway ! ?
The shrill voice of Peter Harvey had taken up
the discussion in defence of his chum Jerry, and
next instant his shock head was poked out of the
door and his pale blue eyes surveyed the scene.
? The escort seems pretty restless, too,? he added
significantly.
?You make me tired.? Davis?s broad face and
burly figure appeared for an instant behind Peter,
but retired again in disdain. ?For months the
convoys have been going through these waters


untouched, and now, because a couple of ships get
caught by a stray sub, you believe wild yams of
flotillas of super-subs who are going to blow us all
up ! Idiots ! Scared by an enemy agent?s bogey 1 ?
? There?s something in what Bully says, chaps,?
chimed in Harry Prebble, the fourth of the group of
boys. ?We know the Germans have these sub
cruisers, of course, but since the convoy system came
in we have had them guessing. Even in home
waters they are having a thin time, and in these
wide seas they can hardly get a look in.?
? Oh I Jerry is a New Zealander,? growled Bully
derisively. ? A sort of Imperial country-bumpkin.
He?ll believe anything.?
Jerry declined to be led into retort. ? How,
then, do you explain the sinking of three ships
simultaneously in different parts of the same con-
voy ? ? he asked quietly. He still leaned on the
rail, watching the cruiser?s movements, but he
listened carefully to all that was said in the cabin.
Far from being an alarmist, he felt that the recent
extraordinary rumours were taken far too lightly
by his fellow-apprentices, to whom so much of the
watch-keeping in these waters was entrusted.
Bully Davis almost snorted his reply. ? Explain 1
Exaggeration?that?s the explanation. One ship,
then three; it will be a dozen by now back there
in Rio.?
?Of course ! That is why the skipper warned
us so seriously, isn?t it ? ? Peter?s intended sneer
was somewhat weakened by indignant annoyance.


? Bah ! The Old Man is always nibbing ? duty ?
into us. As though we don?t keep good watch for
our own sakes. But I?m not wearing myself out
down here and being all nerves when we reach the
real danger zone. Not this child ! ?
? Besides,? added Harry Prebble, ? they believe
the escort got the attacker the second time.?
? Believe ! ? snorted Peter. ? They don?t know.
There was more than one attacker, anyway,? he
persisted obstinately, ? and what could be easier
than to plug torpedoes into a mass of ships like
this and get away before the cruiser could come
near you ? It is a marvel to me that we have got
off so lightly so far.?
? Shows what a fat lot you know about subs,?
jeered Bully. ? Any school kid could tell you why
it isn?t as easy as all that.?
? Well, Jerry?s brother commands a British
sub, and he ?
?I?m afraid you are getting off the rails, Peter,?
interrupted Jerry laughingly. ? You see, a sub-
merged sub can only knock up about four or six
knots, and so would need to be right in the track
of a convoy to attack. She could not overtake
while submerged, and would not dare to come to
the surface while the cruiser is near.?
? But both these attacks were at night,? insisted
Peter. ? She could pursue on the surface at night.?
? How could she see the ships any distance at
night, coon ? ? demanded Bully impatiently. ? She
would still have to be right in the way. That is
4


what actually did happen, I suppose. By a stroke
of luck she chanced on two convoys, and torpedoed
a ship from each. Nothing to worry about; it's
not likely to happen again.?
? They say she was on the surface the second
time she attacked,? chimed in Harry Prebble.
? And the cruiser switched on her searchlight and
picked her out before she could dive. Of course
it was a case then of racing over and dropping depth
charges, and I heard say that they saw oil and
wreckage come to the surface before they sailed on
again.?
? What they say and you hear ? began Peter
in disgust.
Dong-dong , Dong-dong , Dong-dong , Dong.
Seven bells.
Jerry left the rail and strolled away aft. The
sun had vanished, and the brief tropical twilight was
changing through opal green to blue except for a
slight pulsing shade of red on the low clouds of the
western horizon. In half an hour he would have
to go on watch, and he was wearied of the continual
and profitless arguments of the half-deck as to how
much truth there was in the stories of successful
attacks on the carefully guarded convoys on which
the Allies relied for their vital supplies. The
Patagonia was only one of twenty great food carriers
in this one convoy. Thousands?perhaps millions
?of tons of shipping had been sunk before the
convoy system had seemed to stop the dead rot.
Only the Admiralty knew how near disaster had


been. Was the death-grip closing again ? In the
deadly waters around Europe the swift destroyers
shepherded the inbound ships. But here, in the
wide stretches of the South Atlantic, where one
cruiser had hitherto kept safe a fleet of merchant-
men, if a chink had been found in the armour, then
defeat. . . . Jerry could not finish the thought.
Jerry strained his eyes into the velvet darkness.
The nearer ships were black shadows, vaguely seen.
Beyond, only darkness. No gleam of light; no
sound to tell where the convoy spread. Only the
trained and intent gaze of the look-out enabled safe
position-keeping in the faint starlight. Perhaps
Davis was right. The sub must have been lucky
to have found a convoy at night; a moonless night,
too, so report said. The sinkings too may have
been exaggerated ?must have been, for torpedoes
must be aimed if they are to hit.
A quartermaster tramped along the dark deck.
? That you, Jerry ? It?s one bell. No bell
striking during the night, you know. I?ve warned
Peter, and he said you were along here.?
?Right. Thanks.? As the quartermaster moved
on towards the engineers? quarters, Jerry turned to
go back to the half-deck.
? Ready, Peter ? ? he inquired as he stepped
into the cabin. ? We?ll get above and be on the
spot ready for eight bells.?
? Sure ! You are not taking your bridge coat,
are you ? It?s going to be pretty warm again to-
night.?


?Just a muffler,? agreed Jerry, and he peered
into the bunks where Bully and Harry, who had
to take the middle watch, were already turned in.
? These two still undressing ? ? he added, with a
touch of surprise.
Bully?s fat face gleamed in the dim light above
the bunk-board. ? What do you think, baby ? ?
he snorted. ? Time enough to keep your togs on
after we pass the Canaries. Still fidgeting over
your phantom flotilla ? ? He disappeared again
down into the blankets.
? Harry has kept some of his clothes on,? began
Peter.
? More fool he 1 ? came in a smothered grumble
from Bully.
? Come along, Pete.? Jerry stepped out on to
the deck, settling his muffler comfortably around his
throat as he did so.
The bridge was astir with dark figures as the
boys climbed the ladder, but there was little sound.
Captain Beresford stood near the darkened chart-
house in characteristic attitude, with feet wide set
and arm crooked up to support the pipe at which
he sucked though it was not alight. By the binnacle,
in which faintly gleamed the only light visible on
the ship, stood the first and third mates. Even while
the chief recited the orders to his relief, they both
scanned the dark sea and kept wary eyes on the
vessels ahead and abeam. The quartermasters
going ? off watch ? were already crossing eagerly
to the ladders, while the others settled reluctantly


into place at the wheel and in the bridge wings.
A steward came bustling up the ladder bearing hot
coffee and biscuits for the skipper.
With a brief ? Cheerio, Pete ! ? Jerry passed
quietly to the extreme of the starboard bridge wing.
His was the position of honour for the next four
hours. A quartermaster was posted a few feet
farther inboard, and there were seamen in the crow?s
nest, on the fo?c?sle head, and on the poop; but the
projecting wing was the most commanding position
on this, the eastward exposed flank of the convoy.
The stir died away, the ? Good-night, old
man ! ? of the mate as he disappeared below being
the signal for all to resign themselves to the watch.
Jerry settled himself comfortably against the rail
and looked out into the almost unrelieved darkness.
He knew enough of his business not to strain his
eyes anxiously, but waited instead till his pupils
adapted themselves to the gloom. Very quickly he
was able to distinguish easily where the pale sky
met the black waters. A maze of stars exerted
magnetic attraction, but Jerry avoided them, keeping
his gaze roving steadily over the waters, which had
now become evident as a restless silently moving
grey-black blanket.
The tread of the third mate came near across
the bridge, passed slowly away again to the farther
side, approached again, and paused.
? Keep ?em well skinned to-night, Jerry.?
?I?m doing that all right, Mr. Rich. I?m not
one to think it worth while taking chances.?
8 (S.7M)


? Glad to hear it. Some of ?em think the
Admiralty over cautious in giving that warning.
But the Old Man does not think so, and what Captain
Beresford thinks, is good enough for Donald Rich.?
? For me, too ! ? responded Jerry warmly.
There was a brief silence, Jerry intent on watch-
ing the sea for any suspicious flash of foam ; Rich
calculating the movements of a restless London-
America boat abeam.
? We are near St. Paul?s Rocks, aren?t we ? ?
inquired Jerry.
? Sighted them just before sunset. Of course,
if that sub was not destroyed last time, she is not
likely to hang about here. She will go hunting
farther east. That is probably why they sent us so
close to the rocks.?
?You think she will hang about this latitude,
then ? Do you think she has a secret base near,
or is it the limit of her cruising power ? ?
? Bases are scarce just here since Brazil threw
in her lot with us. But you see this is the narrowest
line between the two continents, and a sub might
slip across to catch either an African or an American
convoy.?
? What?s the distance across ? ?
? Fifteen hundred miles.?
? H?m ! If she has to cover that she won?t
catch many. You know I have a bee in my bonnet
over these rocks ?
? Confound the fellow ! ?
The third sprang off towards the steersman,
(3,744) 2 9


and Jerry allowed himself a glance behind. The
black bulk of the London-America boat had shot
on out of station and was well out of line also. In
response to the third?s quick orders, the Patagonia
was steered well away, and gradually the other vessel
slipped back into her place and Mr. Rich recom-
menced his monotonous prowling to and fro across
the bridge. It must have been fully an hour later
that he paused again?a welcome break in the
monotony of watching for Jerry?but he took up the
conversation where he had broken it off.
? You think there is a base on St. Paul?s ? You
could hardly hide anything on those few bare rocks.
The sea would soon sweep it away if you did.?
But Jerry?s thoughts had taken a new direction.
? Don?t you think the way we have to crawl
along in convoy is asking for trouble ? If every
ship could run away at her own speed ?
? Haven?t we learnt it doesn?t pay I The subs
have a fairly good speed on the surface. They
don?t dare venture up with a cruiser about. It is
the ? lame ducks ? that are the trouble. Each convoy
is supposed to be grouped for speed. But just look
at us now ! Saddled with ?
?The Chowkidar ! ? giggled Jerry.
? The Chowkidar ,? agreed the third disgustedly.
? A miserable little tramp of barely two thousand
tons. She is lucky when she can scrape up eight
knots ?and that will be ruining her engines.?
? She is a cargo boat, and I suppose that is
everything.?


? She is not worth risking ships like the Patagonia
for,? retorted the third grimly.
? Well, perhaps we shall lose her before very
long. She drops astern if we attempt to increase
speed.?
? She will be missing to-night, all right,?
chuckled Rich. ? The escort is a bit windy, and
signalled fourteen knots, and devil take any one
unable to keep the pace ! ?
Jerry whistled. ?Phew! Th eChozvkidar ?
? Confound the fellow ! ?
The third was off, and Jerry glanced round to
see the troublesome London-America boat swing-
ing out of station again. The boy grinned, dropped
his eyes to the dark patch at the port wing where
Peter Harvey sheltered. The next instant he spun
round to his watch again with a little gulp of alarm.
The ship had suddenly rung like a gong, and the
tremble that ran through her was like the shiver of
an earthquake. A short pause, and over the bridge
swept the puff of wind bearing the roar of the
explosion which the sea had carried more quickly.
With fingers gripping the rail in an agony of dismay,
Jerry leaned far out, staring to where a cloud of
smoke drifted, pale in the starlight, over one of
the dark ships astern. A babble of excited voices
broke out on the bridge behind the boy, and he was
conscious that the quartermaster had come near him.
Below, men were running to the decks and fo?c?sle
head, and flocking to the rails. A medley of noises
drifted vaguely across the sea, and then a rocket


shot into the air, a vivid gold streak slashing the
darkness above the stricken vessel.
? Torpedoed!? breathed Jerry. ? Torpedoed!?
Abruptly through the night the searchlight of
the cruiser shot its dazzling beams. For a moment
it rested on the listing shape of the doomed merchant-
man, turning the dazzle-painting to a clownish
raddle. Then it darted off like a searching finger,
groping over the waves for the slim stick of a peri-
scope. A second searchlight sprang to life and aided
the search, the waters changing to the blue of day
in the vivid rays. Jerry?s eyes followed the lights,
in a fierce wolfish hunt for the destroying submarine.
B-O-O-M !
From away on the far side of the convoy another
explosion slowly rolled. One of the searchlights
wavered, hesitated, and then swerved across to
port; the other maintained an obstinate search of
the waters to the east.
Jerry set his teeth. ? Who says only one sub
now ! ? he ground out.
Then he was flung violently against the rail and
tumbled headlong upon the deck. The quarter-
master crashed down on him immediately after,
knocking what little breath he had left completely
from his body. The ship seemed to have lifted
bodily with an ear-shattering roar. Dazzling lights
flickered before Jerry?s eyes, and the air was full of
fumes. Water showered viciously across the bridge.
There was some kind of uproar going on, but yet
it seemed to come through a sort of silence. A

A searchlight flashed over them for an instant.


sentence persisted in beating stupidly through the
boy?s brain :
? It was on the port side, and we can't be tor-
pedoed from there. It was ?
He was brought to himself by some one dragging
him up. Peter?s voice bellowed in his ear.
? Are you hurt, Jerry ? Pull yourself together !
She is settling fast. Must have a hole in her like
a house.?
? It was on the port side,? mumbled Jerry.
? We can?t be torpedoed from there.?
? Can?t we! ? snapped Peter impatiently. ? Come
on y man ! ?
The captain?s firm voice reached Jerry?s numbed
brain. ? Now, lads, to the boats. What are you
doing here ? ?
Although his lungs hurt badly, and his head sang
from the blow against the rail, Jerry was restored to
action by the familiar call of discipline. He followed
close on Peter?s heels as the latter ran down the
bridge steps to the boat deck. The Patagonia was
listed heavily over to port, and her bows were down
too. To an orderly confusion and the barking of
orders the lifeboats were being lowered away.
Jerry hesitated. His own boat station was on the
after-boat, port side ?the boat farthest away. Peter
divined his thoughts.
?You come in my boat,? he snapped, and
indicated the nearest boat, which was already slipping
down the sloping side of the ship.
? ?Vast lowering,? roared the mate, who had
14


caught sight of the two lads on the deck. ? Now,
my sons, jump for it.?
Without further urging they sprang for the falls
and slid down into the boat. It was being lowered
away again even as they reached it, and the Patagonia
righting herself with a lurch as the sea filled her, in
a few seconds they struck the water and had flung
off the blocks.
A searchlight flashed over them for an instant
as they gave way to the oars. Then it left them
pulling blindly into the night.


CHAPTER II
THE LAME DUCK
THE sharp tones of the mate steadied the ragged
pulling of the oarsmen.
?Lay on your oars. Now, pull slowly;
just give her way.?
With her head kept to the sea the lifeboat moved
slowly over the big rollers, lifting and dropping
regularly. From the boat they could plainly see
ships of the convoy, black shapes against the pallid
sky, clinging to their formation with the despera-
tion of timidity in the presence of the terrible
menace.
Both the searchlights from the cruiser flickered
over the sea to the eastward, and the big vessel was
steaming down the convoy at full speed. Trusting
to the speed of the merchantmen to carry them
beyond the submarine attacking the port wing, she
was searching against hope for a glimpse of the
4-inch stick of a periscope on this side, to guide her
depth charges.
? Will she stop and pick us up, I wonder ? ?
said Peter in a low voice. The two boys were in
the bows of the lifeboat.


? Not while there is hope of finding the subs,?
replied Jerry. ? Where are the other boats ? Can
you see ? ?
Both boys strained their eyes in the search.
There was no sign of the Patagonia ; she must have
dived swiftly and suddenly while all in the boat
were still dazzled by the searchlight. No other
boat was near enough to be seen.
? They probably made inwards in the hope of
being picked up by some one. The whole line
must have been thrown out when we were torpedoed,?
remarked Jerry.
? The Kent just steered clear of us to port,?
replied Peter. ? I was hanging to the rail when we
were bumped, and I managed to keep my feet.
She went by at full speed, and must have made
a near thing of it. I don?t suppose any of them
steered out here.?
? There is one fairly near,? exclaimed Jerry
excitedly.
? The mate is bringing her round,? said Peter.
? There is still a chance if we get a move on.?
Obedient to the chief officer?s command, the
oars began to dip, and the big boat responded to the
sweeping pulls. The liner which Jerry had sighted
was much too far away for them to intercept her
as she forged ahead under the full pressure of her
powerful engines; but perhaps others of the convoy
were still behind.
? Can?t see any other coming up,? remarked
Peter a trifle anxiously.


Jerry scrambled up on to the bow thwart, and
stood, swaying to the motion of the boat.
? Who is that up in the bow ? ? called the mate
sharply.
? Me?Lieb, sir.?
? See anything ? ?
Jerry interpreted this as meaning ? anything
useful,? and he let his eyes travel around the dark
waters for a while before replying. ? No, sir?yes !
Wait a minute. Yes, there is something away over
there. On our quarter, sir. You can just glimpse
her when we are on a wave-top.?
?On the quarter ? She must be well out of
line then. You?re sure ? ?
? Yes, I?m sure now, Mr. Blake. She is well
out of line ?and must be well astern too.?
? The ? lame duck ? for a quid ! ? came the voice
of one of the seamen in the boat.
? The la Oh, the Chowkidar, you mean ! ?
said the mate. ? Well, even the Chowkidar is
better than the open sea, I suppose. Get down,
Lieb, till I bring her round ; then you can get up
and sight her again.?
The mate?s joking remark with regard to the
old tramp, combined with the prospect of rescue,
put the men in a good humour. Several funny, or
would-be funny remarks, were bandied about, and
they chuckled as they rowed. Jerry knelt on the
thwart and held tightly as the boat rocked in the
trough of the waves; but as soon as the bows came
on to the seas again he stood once more on the
18


narrow unsteady platform. ?You are right on to
her now, sir,? he called sharply.
? Right! I?ll steer a bit ahead of her to make
allowance for her speed. You stay there and give
me steering orders.?
More chuckles from the men.
? Did yer say speed, sir ? ? chirruped a Cockney
steward in a shrill voice. ? Lummy ! Yer won?t
?ave to allow much ! ?
? Better turn round and row backwards, sir,?
came another voice.
? They ought to call her the Slow-kidder?
chimed in Peter.
? Oh, rotten ! ? groaned Jerry. ? Point to star-
board, sir,? he added in a louder voice.
? I can see her now,? replied the mate. ? Give
way, men; even the Chowkidar can drift in a
current, and she may be our only chance ; the
cruiser is making off to the westward.?
The oars began to work faster, and heads were
turned to seek the approaching tramp.
? Don?t let her rush past, Jerry,? shouted a
cheerful voice, and again a roar of laughter relieved
the tension.
?We are right in her track,? said Mr. Blake
quietly. ? Stand by to give her a hail, Jerry.?
With the oar blades dipping lightly into the
water all hands sat watching the dark shape grow
bigger as the vessel approached. They had to
maintain their position for some minutes, however,
before the tramp drew near.


? Hope she doesn?t take us for the sub,? mur-
mured Peter uneasily.
? Give her a hail, Jerry.?
? Ship ahoy ! ? The boy?s shrill voice sounded
thin and feeble in that wide space.
? You want some beef behind it, son,? growled
a burly seaman. He let out a roar like the bursting
of a boiler :
? SHIP AHOY ! ?
Still the Chowkidar came on in silence.
? Ship ahoy ! Ship ahoy ! SHIP AHOY ! ?
At last a faint voice answered them across the
waters:
? Ahoy ! Who are you ? ?
? Boat from Patagonia ?torpedoed,? shouted
Jerry through cupped hands.
A stentorian voice through a megaphone answered
them this time. ? Right! Stand by to take a line.
I dare not stop.?
? One good pull, men. Now! Ship oars!
Stand by to catch a line.?
The boat swirled round parallel to the course
of the Chowkidar. With a clatter of oars tumbling
into the boat, the men sprang to their feet and stood
looking expectantly towards that towering black
mass. The boat rocked furiously in the trough of
the waves, and the mate kept a delicate hand on the
tiller, with one eye on the blunt and massive bow and
the other alert for the bow-wash. But evidently
the Chowkidar?s engines were stopped, and she was
running on by her way only. To the little boat,
20


nevertheless, the speed of the tramp seemed tremen-
dous. The iron sides raced by, whether by luck or
good steersmanship, only a few feet away.
? Look out ! Don't touch it forward ! ?
A rope fell with a plop across the boat. Jerry,
whose fingers were already closing on the line
when the mate shouted, let go quickly as he realized
that it would not do for the boat to be dragged round
suddenly. The Cockney steward, Harris, had indeed
grasped the rope, but, fortunately, it was twitched
from his hands. It flopped over their heads and
was seized and twisted swiftly round a cleat before
it could tighten.
? Smartly done, Gray,? rapped the mate, and
equally smartly he dragged the loose end round one
of the thwarts. The boat began to be dragged
stern first through the water, bumping against the
ship?s side and with the water frothing and boiling
around it. With a clatter a Jacob?s ladder tumbled
down from above.
?Up you go; one at a time, but make it
snappy.?
The mate held the line secure while the crew
tumbled across to the ladder and swarmed on to
its wooden rungs. The boys were the last to leave
before the officer, and as they swung themselves
over the stout iron bulwark and on to the iron deck
they glanced back for Mr. Blake. The thud of a
hatchet biting through wood greeted them. It was
Mr. Blake shattering the tanks and timbers of the
boat before leaving. The chopping ceased. With


a quick glance to gauge the distance to the ladder,
the mate flung the rope from the thwart, and as it
began to slip round the cleat he leaped across and
up the ladder.
? Good man ! He?s not leaving anything to drift
around. That?s what I call a seaman ! ?
The boat, already half-full of water, dragged
herself free and vanished astern as Mr. Blake came
climbing over the bulwark.
? Hard luck, mister ! ? sympathized the same
voice which had approved the scuttling of the life-
boat, and an officer stepped forward to greet the
mate as he stepped to the deck. ? How many of
you are there ? ?
? Twenty-five, all told.?
?Um ! Not too bad. But it will be a bit of a
squeeze for us all the same. Any other officers ? ?
? No. Two apprentices ; all the rest crew.?
? Well, our cooks and stewards will look after
them. They will have to go in the cabin for to-
night, anyway. You had better come along to the
Old Man.?
He began to move forward along the deck.
? Did you mean the men were to sleep in the
cabin ? ? inquired Mr. Blake. ? Couldn?t they
squeeze into the fo?c?sle ? ?
? We are a bit crowded this trip ; men working
their way home from Brazil, you know. The Old
Man thinks the cabin the best place.?
Obviously puzzled, but probably feeling that
he was not in a position to discuss the Chowkidar
22


captain?s ideas, the mate said no more, and the two
disappeared for?ard.
? What about the bunks of the men on watch ? ?
growled Peter in Jerry?s ear. ? A comfortable sleep
would do me better than sprawling in their darned
cabin.?
?It certainly seems queer ? began Jerry; but
he was interrupted by a lusty voice bellowing along
the deck.
? Come along, me hearties. Come and feed
your faces. This way.?
Two or three of the Chozvkidar?s men joined the
forlorn group, and began to bustle them cheerfully
along. The rescued crew were not slow to respond
to the friendly spirit.
? You?re dining in state, me sons,? chuckled
one of the tramp?s cooks. ? You?re agoin? in the
cabin.?
? Lummy! and I left me boiled shirt on the
Pattygonia? exclaimed Harris in horror. ? I?m
sorry, yer r?yal ?ighness, but I?ll ?ave to send the
bo?sun back fer it.?
Don?t bother, dook,? cried the cook airily.
? The skipper will lend you ?is pyjamas.?
Laughing and chaffing, the group of men went
tumbling through the narrow doorway and down the
steep ladder leading below. The two boys bringing
up the rear groped their way carefully in the darkness
till a welcome gleam of light at the foot of the ladder
revealed the door of the cabin.
The cabin itself was a small compartment, about


twelve feet long by eight feet wide. Down the centre
ran a narrow table, round which were eight chairs
of the usual swivel type screwed to the floor. A
solitary electric globe glowed feebly overhead ; the
two ports, both of which were in the for?ard deck-
head, being carefully screened with heavy hangings.
The leading men made a rush to secure the
chairs while the rest swarmed round, laughing and
tussling. The narrow space was soon filled. Jerry
and Peter paused just inside the door. Harris, the
Cockney steward, who had managed to secure the
captain?s chair against the deckhead, rapped loudly
on the table.
? Stooard! Bring on the roast turkey,? he
shouted pompously.
The cook grinned. ?My mate?s just getting
some soup,? he said. ?I?ll cut along and ?urry
it up. They don?t sound much like shipwrecked
mariners, do they ? ? he remarked gleefully to the
boys as he withdrew. ? That?s the kind I likes ?
oh ! beg pardon, sir. I didn?t see you.?
At the door he had blundered into Mr. Blake.
The Patagonia's men turned expectantly as their
chief officer appeared in the doorway, and they
waited in silence except for a facetious inquiry from
the irrepressible Harris as to whether his sheets
were aired.
?You will all be given some soup and bread
to-night,? began Mr. Blake abruptly, ? and then
you will have to make the best of it down here till
morning. There is no room for you in the fo?c?sle.
24


THE LAME DUCK
You can sleep in here or in the alleyway outside,
but you must keep below and not go on deck. Also,
on no account must you smoke.?
? Lummy ! ? exclaimed Harris. The rest main-
tained a surprised silence.
? I want you two.? The mate turned to Jerry
and Peter and motioned them to the alleyway.
? Here, wait a minute, sir. Ain?t we to have
any blankets ? ? The speaker was a gaunt bearded
seaman with large, aggrieved-looking eyes. A mur-
mur of approval supported the inquiry.
? You will have blankets, of course,? replied
Mr. Blake grimly. ? But you must remember that
you are on a tramp now, and one of the poverty-
stricken type at that. It will be a bit crowded, but
that will keep you warm ! ?
? I?ll ?ave old Ginger nex? ter me,? announced
Harris cheerfully. ?If ?e ain?t ?ot enough ?
Mr. Blake again motioned to the boys as he
withdrew, and they followed him wonderingly, while
again the babble broke out in the cabin. The cook
came hurrying along the alleyway with a huge bowl
of soup, while a steward followed bearing a tray
laden with mugs and slices of bread. Seeing Mr.
Blake the cook grinned broadly and repeated his
former remark gleefully :
? Don?t sound like poor shipwrecked mariners,
do they, sir ? ?
? No,? smiled the mate. ? Let?s hope they don?t
have a second dose.?
?Oh ! ?Ave an ?eart, sir.?


A loud uproar greeted the cook?s appearance.
Mr. Blake motioned to the ladder, and as they
ascended to the deck he addressed the two boys.
? I have managed to fix you up in the wireless
cabin. The steward will bring you some supper
there. The radio man seems a decent sort; but ?
this is a queer sort of ship and a queer skipper.
Don?t try making suggestions to him if you don?t
want your head bitten off ! Our chaps are going to
be locked in down there. Hope another torpedo
does not arrive in the night! Also you ?and I?
have orders to keep in our sleeping quarters until
we have permission to leave them.?
? Good ?land ! ? exclaimed Peter. ?Is this a
prison ? Or a battleship ? Or?what, sir ?
? Where are you sleeping, Mr. Blake ? ? inquired
J err y- _ . ..
?In one of the officers? cabins. Our new skipper
is certainly a disciplinarian. Perhaps he thinks it
makes up for commanding a dirty old tramp.?
They had made their way along the dark deck,
and now the mate paused before a door near the
after-end of the deckhouses. The mate rapped
sharply, and a voice bade them ? Come in.? Open-
ing the door they looked into the yawning darkness
of a cabin; but no sooner were they inside and the
door closed behind them than a light flashed up.
A connection on the door itself switched the light
on and off, obviating any risk that thoughtlessness
or lack of caution should send a tell-tale flash across
the sea.


Under the screened port of the cabin was a
table carrying the apparatus of a ship?s wireless.
Before it sat the operator, the phones clipped over
his ears. He grinned in friendly fashion.
? Welcome ! ? he said drily, then he waved to
a curtain which swayed before a narrow opening
at the inner part of the cabin. ?My mate has
turned out on to the settee. There are two bunks
in there; you can go straight in and turn in.?
He turned to the tuner as though a signal
had started. With a whispered ? Good-night ? the
mate motioned the boys towards the inner cabin,
and then, with one glance at the operator, he opened
the door. Again the light went out for a moment.
Then as it flashed up again, Jerry touched Peter?s
arm, and they moved quietly away behind the
curtain.


CHAPTER 111
CAPTAIN FAVERSHAM INTRODUCES HIMSELF
JERRY roused slowly to the muffled buzzing of the
wireless transmitter within the silence cabin a few
feet away. There was a heaviness about him
which was quite unusual; he felt irritated by the
monotonous rhythm of the Morse, and the idea of
opening his eyes was repugnant. For a few minutes
indeed he did drift off into sleep again, but the
huzz-huzz-huzzzzz from the spark gap was still
evident to his brain, forcing him to think, to make
an effort, to wake up. Half in annoyance at the
disturbance, and half alarmed by his drowsiness, he
forced apart his eyelids, and lay gazing across at the
staring whiteness of the silence cabin. From this
his eyes wandered to the curtain hanging between
the two compartments of the long cabin. It swayed
slowly as the ship rolled, each time admitting a streak
of daylight. Jerry sat up and peered over the edge
of his bunk. In the lower bunk Peter sprawled,
his right arm flung out awkwardly over the edge of
the bunk, his left hand clutching convulsively at the
bedclothes, wdiich were tumbled as though he had
had a very disturbed night. He lay on his back
28


with jaws wide, and loud and distressing snores
rasped from his throat.
?My stars ! ? thought Jerry. ? What?s wrong
with old Pete ? He looks as though he had been
through a mincing machine. And that snore ! How-
ever did I hear the wireless with that turned on! ?
With an effort to overcome his lethargy, Jerry
swung his legs over the bunkboard and slid to the
deck. Strange ! He felt shaky and uncertain as
though he had been seriously ill. The rolling of
the ship, moreover, seriously inconvenienced him ?
and he had been two years at sea since leaving the
Worcester ! Certainly the vessel had more of a roll
this morning than she had had the previous night;
there was also a chilliness in the air?unless this
queer weakness was responsible for the feeling.
With a movement of impatience with himself, Jerry
let go of the bunkboard and pulled the curtain aside
to walk into the outer cabin.
Gazing thoughtfully out through the porthole
stood the same operator ?or ? Sparks,? as he is
familiarly known at sea?who had been on watch
when they had entered the cabin the previous night.
The phones were clipped into place over his ears,
but he must have heard the slight sound made by
Jerry, for he turned at once, slipping aside one ear-
piece to facilitate conversation as he did so.
? Hallo ! Roused from the dead at last! ?
? What?s the time, Sparks ? ? Like most sea-
men habituated to watch keeping, Jerry was most
concerned with the hour of the day.


? Just gone six bells.? The operator waved to
a clock just below the port.
? Eleven o?clock ! ? exclaimed Jerry incredu-
lously. ? Surely we?ve not slept all that time ? ?
? Well ?more or less,? smiled Sparks. ? How
do you feel ? ?
? To tell you the truth,? began Jerry doubtfully,
? I don?t know how I feel. I mean, I feel as though
I don?t quite belong to myself; all shaky and weak.?
Sparks nodded. ? Shock,? he said. ? One of
you has been shouting and arguing half the night,
and you both have been snorting and grunting and
tossing. You have slept, but you were more shaken
by your experience than you realized last night.?
? I suppose that was it,? agreed Jerry slowly.
? Nerves, no doubt. I felt quite irritated when
your signals woke me. By the way,? he added in
surprise, ? aren?t you disobeying strict orders ?
and taking a risk ?by using your transmitter ? ?
? Oh, I have orders all right,? smiled the other.
? Lost touch with the convoy, I suppose ? ?
grinned Jerry.
? Done that all right,? agreed Sparks readily.
? What do you think of the change of weather ?
Enough to make our poor old tub go astray, isn?t
it ? ?
Jerry stepped forward to gaze out of the porthole.
If the conversation had been switched off to a new
topic rather adroitly, Jerry had not observed the
fact; the unsatisfactory explanation of the use of
the powerful ?and forbidden ?transmitting gear
30


was readily forgotten in contemplating the dreary
change outside.
In place of the brilliant sunshine they had been
having since Rio, there was a prevailing greyness of
sea and sky. Even as he looked out there was the
swish of drenching rain, which continued heavily
for a few minutes and then ceased as abruptly as
it had started. It passed away over the sea like a
monstrous ghost, and then others of its kind could
be seen stalking over the waters, swaying and drifting
squalls. Between two of them, and about two miles
on the beam of the Chowkidar , another vessel steamed.
? Why, there?s one of the others,? exclaimed
Jerry. ? Looks as though the formation is a bit
ragged; but you are not lost. Who is she ?don?t
seem to recognize her ? Why on earth were you
signalling just now ? You ?
? Sounds as though your mate is rousing,?
broke in Sparks calmly. ? What are your names ? ?
A volley of snorts and puffs certainly announced
something happening behind the curtain. Jerry
stepped back and pulled the hanging aside to see
Peter struggling into a sitting position and trying
to disentangle his legs from the tumbled blankets.
? Allow me to introduce Mr. Peter Harvey,?
grinned Jerry, with a bow to Sparks. ?My name is
Gerald Lieb. Cheerio, Pete ! How do you feel ? ?
? Br-r-r ! I?ve fifty aches in my body and a
mouth like the bottom of a parrot?s cage. What
fool twisted these blankets round my legs ? ?
? You did,? replied Jerry sweetly. ? Fine fellow


you are to be torpedoed, if you can?t stand up to it
better than this ! ?
? Huh ! All very well for you ; you weren?t
on top of it when it went off. You had nothing to
worry about.?
?No ; only about eighteen stone of quarter-
master on my stomach ! ? growled Jerry.
Peter came rolling out to the cabin, his mop of
sandy hair standing wildly on end, his pale eyes
blinking and peering in the brighter light.
? ?Day, Sparks. What?s ?my stars ! Nearly
seven bells ! Can I have a wash ? ?
With a grin the operator indicated the cabin
washstand.
? Rotten weather,? grunted Peter as he let down
the wash-basin. ? What?s the ship ? Not one of
ours, is she ? ?
To all appearance Peter had not so much as
glanced at the porthole, but it was a well-known
characteristic of his to observe things without
appearing to. In fact, very little escaped his atten-
tion. Thus reminded, Jerry turned once more to
stare at the other vessel.
?You know I thought she looked a stranger,
although, of course, one can?t always remember
every ship in the convoy. Who is she, Sparks ? ?
A temporary clearing of the squalls allowed the
other steamer to be more easily seen. Although
distant, her dazzle was sufficiently marked to make
her shape indefinite against the grey background,
and it was quite impossible to tell just where the
32


bow began and her stern ended; but to the trained
eyes of the boys, there was something different in
her cut from the vessels they had seen in Rio and
at sea for nearly a fortnight.
? She is a London-America boat,? replied Sparks
carelessly. ? She is not of the convoy.?
? She certainly is not the London-America boat
we had next to the Patagonia ,? agreed Jerry.
? Rotten old tub she was ; couldn?t keep station.?
? If she?s not in convoy, what is she going north
for on her own ? ? gurgled Peter from a smother
of soapsuds. ?No homeward bounder should be
risking precious cargo like that these times.?
? Why, she?s light! ? cried Jerry in surprise.
? Look how high she is out of the water. She is
alone because she has no cargo.?
Peter seized a towel and swept the soap hastily
from his eyes. ? Going north ?and light ! ? he
snorted. ? What are you talking about ? ?
? If you want a shave I will ring for some hot
water.? Sparks stepped inquiringly in front of Jerry.
? No, thanks. Once a week does me at present.
I?ll just have a wash when Peter finishes flooding
your floor. By Jove, though! That ship ?
She?s in ballast,? remarked Sparks, as though
the statement of the obvious fact was also its ex-
planation. ?We signalled her about the subs, and
I think the Old Man wanted her to take your crowd
aboard, but she does not seem eager.? He walked
over to a line telephone on the bulkhead and took
off the receiver. ? I?ll let them know on the bridge


that you are awake. I had orders not to allow you
to leave the cabin without permission.?
Jerry gave a startled exclamation. It was not
in surprise at the operator?s statement, for despite
its unusual character he had scarcely noticed it.
But at that moment the sun had peeped out wanly
through the mists, and it had thrown the shadow
of the stanchion just outside forward along the deck.
Forward ?when it should have been pointing aft.
Jerry felt himself jostled by Peter, who, still rubbing
vigorously with the towel, had come squeezing in
beside him to gaze from the port too.
? Huh ! That's why that tub is light and on her
own,? he grunted. ? She is going south , not north.?
? Here ! ? Jerry turned in bewilderment to
Sparks. ? We?ve turned round. We?re going
south ! Why on earth have we turned round ? ?
Sparks, who had been briskly turning the little
handle of the telephone, took no notice.
? Hallo ! That you, third ? Is the skipper
there ? ?
Peter began to whistle softly, and he cocked
a comical eye from the operator to Jerry. Then
without a word he strolled back to the inner cabin
to retrieve his uniform jacket.
Jerry hesitated a moment, his brow bent thought-
fully and his teeth biting at his lower lip. There
was probably a simple explanation for the fact that
the ship had turned back on her tracks, but he felt
vaguely uneasy. A sense of strangeness he had had
ever since they had climbed aboard forced itself
34


fully into his consciousness. The several little
peculiar happenings in the short time aboard began
to run together. This old tramp appeared a
cranky home of cranks. Or was there more behind
it ? Perhaps, after all, he was still ? nervy ? from
last night?s experience, and all tramps were different
and less smooth-running than the better-class ships
to which he was accustomed. The best plan was to
ignore things, to follow Peter?s example and follow
the line of least resistance. His mind made up,
Jerry let down the wash-basin again and began to
fill it. Sparks was still talking at the phone.
? No, nothing important. Those two Patagonia
boys are awake, that is all.?
? Boys ! ? snorted Peter indignantly as he stepped
from the inner cabin.
? Well, I thought it wouldn?t matter now,?
continued Sparks; ? but that was the order, so ?
He was interrupted by the cabin door being
flung suddenly and violently open. Sparks hung
the telephone receiver hastily on its hook with the
air of one who knew what was coming. Through
the doorway stepped a huge man in a dripping oilskin,
which was turned right up to the broad red face
with its suggestion of apoplexy. The large steely
grey eyes took in the occupants of the cabin at a
glance, and then fastened on Sparks.
? Operator ! Why the devil didn?t you report
to me the answer to that signal ? ? The captain,
for such he obviously was, had a roaring voice in
keeping with his formidable appearance.


? Sorry, sir, but I?ve had no answer.?
? Then why didn?t you report that ? What is
the idea of keeping me in the dark like this ? Con-
found you, I?ve a good mind to hand you over to
the authorities at the next port. Aren?t you aware
there is a war on ? ?
The captain?s eyes fairly bulged as he glared at
the erring Sparks. Now and again a swift glance
was turned menacingly upon the two boys. Jerry
stood drying himself mechanically in amazement.
Peter was proceeding with the adjustment of his
collar and tie, and he regarded the captain from the
comer of a frankly disapproving eye. Then he
thoughtlessly stepped before the mirror to straighten
his tie, thus coming between the captain and the
object of his wrath.
? I did not think it was necessary ? Sparks
was saying in his quiet even voice, but he got no
further.
? Who asked you to think ? And where the
devil are you coming to ? Didn?t they teach you
discipline on the Patagonia ? You have come to the
right place to get it now, anyway ! ?
Peter started and stepped back hastily. ? Sorry,
sir,? he replied, the flush on his face showing
how his naturally irritable nature had been touched.
? Stand to attention when I speak to you.?
Under the baleful glare, Peter obeyed, but he
cast a very mutinous glance at the aggressive captain
nevertheless.
? What?s your name ? ?


? Peter Harvey.?
? Say ? sir ? when you speak to me.?
Peter remained obstinately silent.
? Now, again. What?s your name ? ?
? Peter Harvey ?sir.? The last word was dis-
tinctly delayed.
For the moment it seemed as though the captain
intended to pursue the discussion further. Jerry
had stood all this time hovering between amusement
and disgust at the captain?s bullying. Something
of a smile must have been on his face, however, for
suddenly the captain turned to him.
? And you ?you seem amused. What is your
name ? ?
? Gerald Lieb, sir.?
? Lieb ? Lieb ? German name, isn?t it ? I
suppose you are a confounded squarehead, aren?t
you ? ?
Jerry was touched on his one sore point. He
flushed and a sharp retort trembled on his lips, but
the discipline of the Worcester and Patagonia held
him steady, and also the unmerciful teasing he had
always had in this connection had toughened his hide.
? No, sir ; I?m not,? he replied shortly.
? Oh, you?re not. What are you, then ? ?
? I?m a New Zealander.?
? Can?t you say ? sir ? ? ?
? I?m a New Zealander, sir.?
Sure you?re not a Swiss ? Lot of squareheads
have found that they are Swiss lately.?
This constant probing on his tender spot was


too much for Jerry. He answered hastily. ?Well,
my grandfather was a German, if you must know.
But he married an Englishwoman in New Zealand,
and my father was British and my mother, and I m
British, too. A better Briton than some who boast
more, I might say.?
Peter hastened to turn upon himself the seem-
ingly inevitable storm. ?He is true blue, sir, he
interposed loudly. ?We led him an awful life on
the Patagonia because of his name. But there isn?t
a man of us more belongs to his native land, what-
ever his distant ancestors might have been.?
? Who asked you to speak ? ?
Strangely enough, the captain seemed less ruffled
by this display of spirit than he had been by their
previous submission. He stared closely at them for
a few moments without further comment, and there
was a new and peculiar expression in his eyes.
? Mind you behave British then,? he added at last,
and turned once more to Sparks.
? See that you keep me posted as to all signals
in future,? he snapped. ? These boys may go on
deck with the others. You know the orders?tell
them.?
Turning, he dived through the door and slammed
it behind him.
? Phew ! ? breathed Peter heavily, and fanned
himself with his hand.
Sparks smiled slightly. ? You will understand
now that Commander Faversham is not to be played
with,? he remarked. ? With regard to ?


? Commander Faversham ! ? interrupted Peter
shrilly. ?My stars ! Does he make you call him
Commander ? ?
? Oh?er?well, sometimes. Of course, you can
call him captain ; that is more usual, isn?t it ? ?
replied Sparks a trifle lamely.
? Well ?yes, I should think so.? Peter regarded
Sparks with a doubtful and puzzled air.
Jerry was thinking hard. ? I?ve heard that name
Faversham somewhere. Surely my brother has
mentioned it. He is in the navy, though?must have
been a similar name, of course.?
Sparks laughed noisily. ? There is some differ-
ence between the navy and this old barge certainly.?
?You have a pretty nifty set here, anyway,?
remarked Peter, gazing at the apparatus on the table
admiringly. ? Looks good to me, and you keep it
polished Ai.?
? I thought the same when I saw it last night,?
agreed Jerry with renewed interest. ? Five kilo-
watt set, isn?t it ? I saw one on the Mauretania
once. What on earth made them fit such a set on a
tramp ? ?
Don t talk blinkin? rot! It?s a darn sight wuss
rahnd ?ere than where we was.?
A raucous and familiar voice floated suddenly
through the porthole, and two men passed on the
deck outside. Harris, the steward, was engaged
in heated argument with another of the Patagonia's
men.
? Well, / ain?t putting up with it,? came the


growling response. ?We ain?t going to be put upon
by that shouting bully, even if we have to be on his
ship. We didn?t choose to come here, did we ?
I know what we?re entitled to, and I?m going to see
we get it.?
? You?re a blinkin? sea-lawyer, Tomkins, that?s
what you are ?
The voices died away as the men passed round
the deckhouses going to starboard. Sparks slipped
off his phones and laughed.
? Some of your gang. Friend Tomkins will find
his work cut out to alter Captain Faversham?s ideas.
Now, my mate will be coming to relieve for lunch
soon ?my name, by the way, is Jameson ?Jimmy
for short, and he is Harry Appleby ; you had better
know us at once if you are camping on us for weeks,
so I had better explain the position to you quickly.
You will be growling with the others then, I expect.?
He opened the door and pointed to the wet mist
drifting by. ? You had better have our oilskins,?
he said. ? You see, it?s like this : the Old Man
has peculiar ideas about his ship. He won?t have
any one wandering about as they like, and he won?t
have the cabin or this place occupied during the
day by those with no duty there. So he has restricted
you all to the after-deck and our crew to the fore-
deck ?although, of course, they are lucky to have
the fo?c?sle. It is a pity the weather is not too good,
for it only leaves you the shelter alongside the cabins
here as far as the companion door (there is a rope
stretched across to remind you not to go farther
40


for?ard), and as the wind is aft there is not much
shelter. That was why your chaps were grumbling.
Of course you can go down to the cabin at your meal
times, and the weather is not cold, although damp.?
? Anything else ? ? demanded Peter, astonish-
ment struggling with sarcasm in his voice. ?If
any wind blows across the deck are we allowed to
breathe it ? ?
Jerry laughed, although there was sympathetic
agreement with Peter?s remarks in his tone as he
said, ?It certainly sounds pretty solid. Do you
mean that we?everybody from the Patty ?have
to stop on the open deck in this rain ? ?
? I daresay the Old Man will allow you to stay
in the cabin if it gets very cold or wet,? said Sparks
reluctantly. ?After all, you know, it is no worse
than taking a watch on the bridge. It isn?t at all
bad if you keep walking up and down, but your
crowd want to squat on the deck all day, and there
isn?t much shelter from these squalls.?
? But why on earth ?
? It?s no use asking questions where Captain
Faversham is concerned,? interrupted Sparks rather
testily. ? Now I am neglecting my watch. You
will find the oilskins by the bunks inside there.?
He strode back to the operating table, donned the
phones hastily, and sat down with his back turned
meaningly towards the boys.
Jerry and Peter regarded each other for a moment
without speaking, and then turned together and
entered the inner cabin, a smile of resignation on
(8.744) 4 4I


the New Zealand boy?s face and a flush of annoyance
on his chum?s. Against the for?ard bulkhead a
settee ran from the bottom bunkboard to the silence
cabin. Above it, on hooks, hung a collection of
clothing, including bridge-coats and two sets of
oilskins.
? What an abbreviated affair,? remarked Peter,
referring to the settee, which certainly was short,
having evidently been cut down when the silence
cabin was installed. ? How on earth did that chap
Appleby sleep there last night ? ?
? Goodness knows ! ? replied Jerry, as he lifted
down one of the oilskins and began to struggle into
it. ?By the way, where is he now ? ?
? Oh, on deck, I suppose. Probably the skipper
makes him stand on one leg in a corner or some
other crazy thing. He seems to have a fad for
ruling people?s actions.? Peter jerked the oilskin
from its peg. ? Hallo ! ? he exclaimed blankly.
? What the ? He pointed dumbly to an
object which had been hanging behind the oilskin.
It was a leather belt, and fastened to it was a holster
containing a heavy service-pattern revolver.
? Yes, there is another one here,? said Jerry
quietly. ? Better say nothing,? he added hastily,
but was too late.
? Hi! ? Peter had shouted. ? You are fully
equipped on this tramp, aren?t you ? Powerful
wireless sets and belts of revolvers ! ?
They heard Jameson move noisily. ?You two
are a darned sight too nosey,? he called angrily.
42


?You had better get out of this and stay out.
For two pins I?d ask the skipper to billet you else-
where. Remember you are here on sufferance, and
please leave things alone.?
? Phew! ? whispered Peter. ? Ain?t he peeved ? ?
Rather disturbed, they came quietly from the
recess to see by Jameson?s face that he was genuinely
put out. ? Sorry, Sparks,? said Jerry humbly.
? We meant no harm.?
? All right,? returned the other more quietly,
but still rather gruffly. ? But Captain Faversham,
as you have seen, is a strict disciplinarian, and I
shall get into trouble as well as you if things are
interfered with.?
A loud metallic drumming began somewhere
outside, and before either of the boys could reply
to Jameson?s comment, the door was opened and a
tall sharp-faced young fellow stepped in.
? Dinner gong going, Jimmy,? he said curtly,
and with only the briefest of glances at the boys
he went over to the operating table.
? Right-o ! ? Jameson removed the phones with
alacrity. ? Here you are ; there is nothing doing.?
? Those two are to mess with the officers,? said
Appleby as he settled the earpieces into place.
? Captain?s orders.?
He took up his watch as one who means business
and without taking any further notice of the boys.
? Rather chatty sort of chap,? whispered Peter to
Jerry with a grin. But Jameson was motioning
them to the door.


? Come on,? he said. ? The Old Man hates
you to walk in after he has started. You are lucky
to mess with us, although I half expected it. \ou
rather pleased the Old Man when you stood up to
him this morning; that surprises you, of course,
but I know Captain Faversham better than you do.?
? Where do the others have theirs ?our chaps,
I mean ? ?
? Mr. Blake with us, of course. But the others
have theirs in the cabin too, when we have finished.
That?s a fad of the Old Man?s : he won?t have them
near the fo?c?sle.?
? Rather a quaint old gentleman,? murmured
Peter sadly.


CHAPTER IV
SHELLED
COME over to the side for a while, Jerry,?
said Peter suddenly.
There was nothing remarkable about the
words themselves, but something in his chum?s tones
made Jerry glance up quickly, and then comply with
the request without comment.
They had been sitting on No. 3 hatch when
Peter spoke, for although the sky was still dull there
had been no squall across the ship for nearly an
hour. Since dinner they had employed themselves
walking up and down the after-deck, with an occa-
sional rest on the hatch or a pause to chat with one
or another of their shipmates, who were crowded
into the shelter of the port deckhouses, and who
showed no inclination to exercise themselves as the
boys did. Their talk had wandered from the state
of affairs on the tramp to the possible fate of the
rest of the Patagonia's crew, on to the mystery of
the successful submarine attacks, and back to the
autocratic Captain Faversham and his eccentric
ideas. All through dinner the captain had dominated
the conversation with his aggressive and booming
voice. He growled of the extra hands on board,


stormed at the London-America boat which had
refused to relieve him of the unwanted men, blamed
the authorities for the prolonged duration of the war,
and bit Mr. Blake?s head off for venturing an opinion.
? I suppose there are a lot of skippers who get
funny from having such unlimited power over
others at sea. And when a man has to command
an old tub like this he might try to make up for it
by behaving as though he were on a crack liner.?
Jerry had thus moralized when Peter gave a new
twist to the conversation with his invitation to go
to the bulwarks.
? It?s just an idea that has popped into my
head,? explained Peter, as they leaned on the rough
iron and gazed down to the sea. ?If we had been
nearer the Chowkidar in the convoy no doubt it
would have struck me before. But you remember
she only came into Rio to join the convoy the day
before we sailed, and she anchored well down
harbour to be in position for station at the rear.
Of course we occasionally glimpsed her at sea, but
she was such a waddler that she was rarely in a good
position for observation from the Patty.?
? If you would throw a little gleam of meaning
into all this rambling chatter, I might possibly get
on to what you are talking about,? was Jerry?s
rather pointedly patient reply.
Peter chuckled. ? The dazzle-painting,? he said,
with a downward wave of his arm. ?I do remember
she had a big green streak starting from the poop
and slanting downwards to about the bridge level.?
46


Jerry, still puzzled, craned over to look along
the side of the vessel. ? Well,? he said, ?it is
there all right, slashed through with yellow. What
about it ? ?
? That?s just it,? retorted Peter tantalizingly.
? Slashed through with yellow ! ?
? Oh, you?re crazy,? snorted Jerry. ? The
worry of our queer skipper has upset your sanity.?
Peter chuckled, but then became serious. ? No,
but Jerry, I?m not joking. Something about the
appearance of this ship has been disturbing me all
the afternoon. The funnel looks different, and I
could swear there were no topmasts before. It
struck me that some of the painting on the upper
works looked fresh, so I thought of that big green
streak. That clinches the matter, Jerry, there were
no yellow breaks before. They have slashed fresh
markings on the sides during the night, my son,
and altered her to look a different ship. Put that
with the turning back on our course, and the anxiety
to rid themselves of us ?
Jerry?s eyes were now shining with excitement.
? Not to mention the way we are prevented from
seeing too much of her by this restricted liberty 1 ?
he exclaimed.
? Nor the fact that those subs must be getting
information from somewhere to attack convoys
successfully,? gabbled Peter excitedly. ? Wait a
minute, Jerry, I?ve more to say yet. Remember
when we put into Rio to load, we passed an out-
going convoy, the one that was attacked a week


later. There was a tramp trailing on at the end ; a
ship something like the Chowkidar.?
He stopped, and the two boys regarded one an-
other seriously. ?I?m remembering,? said Jerry
slowly. ? Yes, it might have been the same ship,
allowing for certain differences which could easily
be accounted for ?as those topmasts and the altered
dazzle.?
? That convoy was attacked ?successfully,? con-
tinued Peter impressively. ? And somewhere about
ten days later another tramp comes in to join our
convoy, which is also attacked ?successfully ! ?
He turned to look along the deck, and Jerry
followed his gaze almost as though expecting to see
something sinister about the ship. But she was
only a typical old tramp, with unboarded iron decks
through which ran rust patches. Her stanchions
were thick and ugly, her deckhouses squat, and her
alleyways narrow. In the alleyway on this side
the group of Patagonia men were sitting on a steam-
pipe casing, some singing, others evidently arguing
heatedly. The shrill voice of Harris showed that
he was one of the latter. Some of the men saw the
boys gazing, and shouted jeering comments aimed
at the apparent aloofness of the pair from themselves.
? It?s impossible, Peter,? exclaimed Jerry almost
angrily. ?We are seeing bogies. The Chowkidar
came up from loading at Buenos Ayres. A ship can?t
play about as you suggest. How could she hood-
wink the authorities ? She had to show her papers.
Besides, they would miss her from the convoy.?
48


? They have missed her from ours, haven?t they ? ?
returned Peter drily. ? Her slow speed is a good
excuse. As for papers, they are not too friendly to
Britain down at Buenos Ayres, and not too particu-
lar about taking bribes. German gold goes far?
especially in South America ! ?
?You mean ?
? Half a mo?,? interrupted Peter. ? Here comes
Tomkins. Another grouse on, of course.?
The seaman who had risen to an increase in the
disturbance and a volley of loud-voiced chaff (in
which again the voice of Harris predominated) was
the same who had made the demand for blankets to
Mr. Blake the previous night. All the afternoon
he had made himself conspicuous by the strenuous
declaration of his opinions, obviously impressing
many of his companions and increasing the general
restlessness and discontent. His gaunt appearance,
which was increased by the length of his straggling
red beard, was well in keeping with the man?s
character.
? He won?t be coming to us,? remarked Jerry,
with a glance of disfavour in the direction of the
sea-lawyer.
? Yes, he is ; I can tell by his manner,? returned
the keen-eyed Peter. ? I suppose he wants to enlist
us in his grousing brigade.?
Tomkins was indeed striding towards them, and
before he had covered a few yards Harris also rose
from the cluster of men and followed.
As soon as he was near enough Tomkins began


to speak in his usual complaining tone. ? Here,
you boys have seen the master of this sea-prison.
What have we done to be cooped out like this ?
? We know as much about it as you do,? snapped
Peter. ? He doesn?t explain everything he does to us?
? We certainly can?t tell you much, Tomkins,?
laughed Jerry. ?We have our meals with the
officers; but the skipper entirely ignores us, and has
said nothing to explain why we are restricted.?
? We has to stop out in the cold and the wet
till evening,? continued Tomkins with rising voice,
? and there is the matter of quarters as well. There
hasn?t nothing been said about shifting us so far
as I can hear. Are we going to sleep on the cabin
deck with nothing except a blanket till we get to
wherever we?re supposed to be making for ? What?s
wrong with putting us in the fo?c?sle ? Ain?t we
good enough to mix with the crowd of this rotten
tramp ? ?
? ?E can?t ?arf lay it on, can?t ?e 1 ? interjected
Harris, who had now reached them. il Proper sea-
lawyer old Tommy is. Always lookin? out for ?is
rights ! ?
? Yes, of course, I don?t expect to get anything
except abuse from you, Dave Harris. We blokes
what gains everything for the crowd gets abuse
from both sides. You would look mighty small for
all your talk if it wasn?t for sea-lawyers, so put that
in your pipe and smoke it.?
Harris laughed raucously. ? All right, Tommy,
don?t get crorss. I admits it ain?t all ?oney on this
50


?ere ?ooker.? He turned to the boys. ? What do
you make of it, me sons ? You, young Jerry ; you?ve
got yer ?ead screwed on right. What?s all the
nonsense at the back o? this ?ere treatment ? ?
? I tell you ? began Tomkins.
? Oh, shut up ! ? yelled Harris. ? We?ve ?card
your views the ?o/e afternoon. Let some one else
speak.?
His penetrating words evoked a responsive
uproar in the group of men by the deckhouses.
There were a few shouts of approval, but many
angry and even threatening ones showed that the
men were getting in an ugly humour. Peter turned
with a snort of contempt and leaned on the bulwark
to gaze out to sea.
It is going to be wet again soon,? he rapped
out over his shoulder, and nodded to where one of
the ghostly squalls stalked not far from the ship,
with others appearing in the distance. ? You had
better get back to your holes.?
? No, I ain?t going to be shut up so quick,?
persisted Tomkins. ? What?s to stop us going
for?ard of that bit of rope across the deck ? The
wind is nearly aft, and the rain blows right along
where we are. For?ard of that rope it is dry. Why
shouldn?t we go there ? ? He, too, had raised his
voice so that it should be heard by his mates.
? ?Ear, ?ear ! ? shouted one. ? What?s wrong
with cutting the blinkin? thing ! ?
A chorus of approval greeted this daring sug-
gestion.


? Well, you have seen Captain Faversham,?
laughed Jerry. ? I think he is the best answer to
your question.?
? Lummy ! ?E is a star turn, ain?t ?e ? ? con-
ceded Harris with grudging admiration.
? He is only a skipper, however he blusters,?
snarled Tomkins. ?We knows our rights; we
signed on as seamen and we has a right to be treated
as such.?
? I dunno ? began Harris.
? No, you don?t know nothing,? interrupted
Tomkins roughly. ?We signed on ?
? Not on the Chowkidar? interposed Jerry
firmly. ? Anyway, you must remember that the
captain?s word is law while at sea. You can com-
plain when we get to Rio; but for your own sakes
you had better grin and bear it now. It won?t be
for long, and bear in mind that we are at war, and
trouble will not be lightly passed over by the naval
authorities.?
?Ho ! And ain?t there some other things the
naval authorities might be interested in, too ? Rio,
you said ! Well, what for are we doing going back
to Rio ? Why has this ship turned round ? Oh,
we ain?t so silly ?
Tomkins paused as Peter straightened with a
startled exclamation, and pointed suddenly across
the sea. The movement was so abrupt that it
attracted immediate attention, and some of the men
even scrambled to their feet. The torpedoing of
the Patagonia had not improved their nerves.


? Well, what is it, Pete ? ? demanded Jerry.
? The squall has hidden it,? said Peter quickly.
? It was a feather of water, about a mile away.?
? ?Ere, you stop putting the wind up a man,?
exclaimed Harris angrily. ? You can?t see no fewer
all that way off.?
? It was the squall splashing the water up,?
snorted Tomkins. ?Or are you trying to put us
off with a scare ? I suppose you two are on the
officers? side. You would be ; dining with ?em in
the cabin.?
? Shut it, Tommy,? interjected Harris dis-
gustedly. ? You finds fault wiv everybody.?
? What did you reckon you see, Peter ? ? called
one of the men.
? What?s crawling on you ? ? demanded another
in annoyed nervousness.
? That kid has darned good eyesight,? remarked
a third as he also rose to his feet. ? I remember .. .?
He plunged into an anecdote inaudible to the boys.
Peter ignored the questions and comments, but
continued to stare out over the heaving grey sea.
Jerry, too, devoted his attention to searching for the
suspicious white water. Unfortunately the squalls
were increasing with the approach of night, and
even as they strained their eyes there swept over the
ship a spray of cold misty rain which obliterated
everything beyond the ship?s rail. Tomkins and
Harris bolted at once for the shelter of the cabins
beneath the boat deck. Except that they wrapped
their oilskins around their necks, the boys ignored


the rain and stood motionless, waiting for the squall
to pass. An uproar from the seamen drew their
attention. As Tomkins had said, the driving rain
searched out their resting-place, while just forward
of the rope by the companion there was a sheltered
strip of deck.
? Come on ! Fm not standing for this.?
Diving under the forbidding rope, Tomkins
reached the sheltered spot and crouched against the
deckhead. In an instant a stream of men followed
him ; Harris, now the lead was given, being well
in the fore. Almost at the same moment the squall
passed ; and this time Jerry joined Peter in the cry
of warning. Appearing and disappearing in the
huge Atlantic rollers, was a long menacing black
shape. The low freeboard, with the high conning-
tower amidships, showed it to be a submarine.
? A sub ! A sub ! ? The cry was taken up by
the men, and they dived back under the rope and
ran to cluster round the boys as though in some
way they were thus made safer.
? Lummy ! ?Ave we got to go through it again ? ?
came Harris?s despairing voice.
The others were dumb ; even Tomkins had
nothing to say.
? She won?t torpedo,? said Jerry, in a voice
which he strove to make reassuring. ? She would
not have shown herself otherwise.?
? What?s the captain doin? ? ? exclaimed Harris
shrilly. ? Why can?t ?e steer away ? ?
? He can?t have seen,? cried another.


A vivid orange flash winked on the fore part of
the submarine.
? She?s firing ! ?
They scattered and huddled foolishly behind
the bulwark of the ship; only the boys and two of
the men remaining erect. Through the air rose
the shrill whine of the shell, making the desire to
crouch almost irresistible.
Bang !
It burst harmlessly a good eighty yards short
of the ship.
? Uncomfortably near, all the same,? Jerry
found himself saying mechanically. ? Good lord !
What?s wrong with ?em ? ? he exclaimed in aston-
ished disgust.
From the fore-deck of the Chowkidar came a
rising uproar of alarm. The Patagonia's men still
crouched in the shelter of the bulwark, but they
were silent; the crew of the Chowkidar were evi-
dently made of poorer stuff. They could be seen
pouring out of the fo?c?sle and along the decks
towards the boat-deck ladders. The commotion
brought the Patagonia's men from their refuge, and
they made a restless movement also towards the
boats.
? Here ! ? cried Tomkins. ?If they are going
to launch the boats, we?re not going to be left
behind.?
The bull roar of the captain shouting abuse at
the panicking crew added to the uproar, and then the
siren of the tramp began to bellow hoarsely. Jerry


cast an anxious glance to the submarine just in time
to catch another gun flash. The noise aboard
drowned the whine of the shell, but when it exploded
almost alongside a wail of terror rose from the
threatened vessel. Two men in naval uniform
dashed through the group on the after-deck on their
way to the poop. They were the gunners of the
little 12-pounder mounted there.
?Fat lot of good that thing will be I ? remarked
Jerry.
As he spoke the Chowkidar heeled over in a
sweep to starboard. Her puny 12-pounder banged
viciously, but the shell aimed at the dimly seen craft,
and hindered by the clumsy movements of the tramp
herself, fell far short of the mark.
Bang !
The shell from the submarine dropped beyond
them this time. Evidently she was having difficulty
in judging the range with the bad visibility.
? Why isn?t she chasing us ? ? queried Peter.
? She appears to be holding on her course.?
? Going after the London-America boat, I
fancy,? replied Jerry. ? Can you make her out ? ?
Peter leaned over the rail and stared southward.
They were now steering due westward ?the sub-
marine was hidden by the steering-engine house.
? She must have a good lead on us,? he remarked.
? I don?t think they could have seen her.?
? Unless they have been following her all day,?
said Jerry. ? She was knocking up a fair speed
when she passed us.?

The Patagonia s men had fairly caught the panic now,
and were lighting fiercely to be first up the ladder.




? They are launching the boats,? shrieked
Tomkins suddenly. ? The cowards ! They?d leave
the ship before she?s touched.?
? Then they ain?t leavin? me I? shouted Harris,
and he leaped on to the boat-deck ladder.
Immediately there was a mad rush, and the
narrow ladder became jammed with men. From
above came a medley of shouts and the creaking of
blocks.
? It?s true, Jerry I ? cried Peter. ? They?re
abandoning ship. Are they mad ? Why does the
skipper keep the siren going, too ? He is only
adding to their panic.?
Jerry, tight-lipped and angry-eyed, shook his
head. ? Maybe to warn the London-America boat.
Those fools ! They will kill themselves.?
The Patagonia's men had fairly caught the panic
now, and were shouting oaths and fighting fiercely
to be first up the ladder. The howl of the siren,
the swearing men, the bang of the 12-pounder, and
the bellow of the skipper?s voice through a megaphone
made an uproar out of all proportion to the effect
of the submarine?s attack so far. For some minutes
indeed no further shells had arrived.
? Here?s Sparks ! ? exclaimed Peter. ? Has he
caught the prevailing excitement ? No, he has a
message in his fist.?
Jameson had charged from the wireless cabin
door, a yellow form fluttering in his fingers. He
turned towards the after-ladder as being the shortest
route to the bridge, but paused in dismay at the
(3,744) 5 57


crush of men scrambling over its iron rungs. Tom-
kins and Harris had just cleared the top and were
racing for the boats, and the others were scrambling
up more freely.
?My golly ! ? gasped Sparks. Swinging round,
he ran along the starboard alleyway to reach the
for?ard ladder.
? That boat ?No. 2 ! ? shrieked Peter suddenly.
?Oh ! The fools ! ?
Jerry leaped to the side and looked forward.
No. 2 boat had somehow been let go by the after
fall and was dangling helplessly. One or two men
were clinging to the thwarts, while three had fallen
into the sea and were swimming vigorously towards
No. 4 boat, which had just reached the water.
? Why, the engines are stopping ! ? exclaimed
Jerry in astonishment.
Peter bit his lip to check an expression of supreme
disgust. ? Can?t you see, Jerry ? The officers are
with the men ?some of them, anyway ! The skipper
and mate are on the bridge shouting themselves
hoarse, but they have no control. We ?
BANG!
A shell burst on the starboard side right along-
side and level with the deck. The corner of the
deckhouses screened the boys, but the shock of the
explosion reached them, and a flying fragment of a
shattered stanchion sang by and struck the bulwarks.
They staggered, and Peter, catching his foot on a
bolt head, fell heavily.
Jerry recovered himself in a moment. ? Sparks I
58


For heaven?s sake, Peter ! That shell must have
burst right behind him.? Like lightning, Jerry had
visualized the progress Jameson could have made
before the shell swept the deck.
He leaped past the foot of the ladder and across
to the starboard side. Behind he heard the clatter
of Peter?s boots. Then he turned sick and giddy.
The stanchions and bulwarks forward of the wireless
cabin were bent and broken, and a few yards beyond
lay Sparks, his shoulder a mangled mess and a great
gash on the back of his head. In his hand he still
clutched the yellow message form.
? Sparks ! Sparks I ? almost sobbed Jerry as he
reached and bent over the injured operator.
To his surprise Jameson moved slightly. In
an instant the two boys bent and raised him.
? Fetch?some one, Peter,? gasped Jerry; but
Jameson?s voice checked him.
? No ?good,? he whispered painfully. ? Done
for.Message?skipper?aatmospherics?pherics ...?
He made a desperate effort to say more, but his
head fell back on Peter?s arm.
? Lay him down, Pete,? said Jerry huskily.
? It?s?over. Let?s take the message.?
Almost snatching the form from the limp fingers
which had retained their hold till the end, Jerry
turned and blundered along the deck, his misty eyes
fixed forward. Peter bent for one moment over the
still figure.
He was a decent chap,? he gulped, and
straightened to hurry after Jerry.


CHAPTER V
DEEP WATERS
AS he emerged on the boat-deck a yard or two
L ahead of Peter, Jerry paused to look round
upon the situation. The weather was thicken-
ing rapidly again, and it was evident that the night
would soon close down.
? Must be quite tea-time,? was the thought which
passed whimsically through the boy?s mind. ? Prob-
ably we won?t get any now.?
? What?s she doing ? ? demanded Peter, and he,
too, stood to take in the position.
For a moment they were not sure of their bear-
ings, but then they caught sight of one of the life-
boats about a couple of hundred yards away on the
starboard quarter. Peter strained his eyes in search
of the submarine.
? There she is I ? he exclaimed. ? She is still
holding on to the s?uth?ard. Why, hallo ! we must
be coming round. Look, she is well round on the
quarter.?
? Yes; there are the starboard boats right
abeam,? replied Jerry. ?We are still moving at
about six knots. They must have left the engines
running slowly.?


? And we are coming round in a circle. The
miserable cowards ! ? exclaimed Peter viciously, with
a glance at the deserted bridge. ? Not a soul stood
his ground ! ?
Jerry seized the rail of the ladder and ran lightly
up to the bridge. ? All the more reason for us to
see they get back again ! ? he called. ? Not to
mention the keeping of this old tub clear of the
U boat as long as possible.?
? Good egg ! ? agreed Peter enthusiastically,
and he lost no time in following.
Two good strides had taken Jerry across to the
binnacle. ? They lashed the wheel anyway,? he
reported. ? Evidently somebody kept a bit cool at
the end.?
? Cool ? Cool, did you say ? To abandon a ship
at the first nip without an attempt to get her away ! ?
? Bang ! ? They saw the flash of the shell L.:t
could not tell just where it landed.
? Thanks ! ? said Peter. ? The same to you I
Here, give me that wheel; you look out and give
orders, you have the brains of this two-man crew.?
? You know she isn?t wasting much ammunition
on us,? remarked Jerry as he relinquished the steer-
ing to Peter and stepped towards the bridge wing to
reconnoitre. ? She is only firing occasionally.?
Running short of supplies, I suppose,? grunted
Peter. ? What are the orders ? ?
Keep her as she is. We will keep her going
in a circle so as not to lose touch with the boats.
If ?


Bang !
? The brutes ! ? shouted Jerry furiously. ? That
shell dropped among the boats.?
? Hit one ? ? asked Peter anxiously.
? No. It may have fallen there by accident.
But if that is their game?port a bit, Peter ;we must
screen the boats.?
? Don?t draw ? began Peter, then he gave
a startled yell. ? A torpedo ! ? The spokes of the
wheel spun swiftly through his fingers.
Jerry swung round to stare ahead. He immedi-
ately picked out the white trail which marked the
path of the deadly ? tin-fish.? It was coming at
right angles to the bows of the ship. Breathlessly
the two lads watched, and calculated whether the
slow way of the ship would bring her in front of the
torpedo, or whether she would answer her helm
in time. For long breathless seconds it seemed as
though the Chowkidar would wallow straight on,
and then, very slowly at first, but with increasing
speed, she began to turn. A sigh of relief went
up from the boys as they saw the white froth of
water pass harmlessly by on the port bow.
? That?s her last bite, I hope, Pete ! ? gulped
Jerry as he mopped his brow. He turned to shake
his fist at the submarine. ? She?s into the squalls
now,? he remarked. ? Can?t see her at all. Any-
way, we?ve got to get back and pick up those boats.
It will be night in a quarter of an hour, and they
will be worse off than if the sub were after them.?
Peter steadied the ship with her bows towards
62


the group of boats, and then he turned a face blank
with consternation towards Jerry.
? But how,? he said, ? are we to pick ?em up
when the ship keeps moving ? ?
Jerry whistled. ? Suffering snakes ! Well, I
don?t know the first thing about engines, Pete ; but
I?ll have to go down and try to stop them.?
He turned to run from the bridge, and at that
moment the chartroom door opened and out stepped
Captain Faversham, followed by Mr. Lever, the
first officer.
? What the devil are you doing here ? ? he roared
fiercely. ? How dare you interfere with the ship ? ?
? Good? gracious ! ? was all Peter could say.
Jerry just stood with mouth open trying to believe
his eyes.
The captain stepped past Jerry, seized the handle
of the bridge telegraph, and swung it to ? Stop.?
The bells jangled in response, and the slight beat
of the engines ceased. So there was some one in
the engine room too !
Call em back ! ? snapped the skipper, turning
to Mr. Lever. ? She isn?t having any.?
?I thought she wouldn?t bother,? replied the
chief officer j and strolling over to the siren lanyard
he gave it a series of sharp tugs. As the siren
responded gaspingly, the captain seemed to think
of something, and hastily picking up a megaphone
he applied it to his lips.
Come back, you sons of cowards! ?he bellowed.
? Come back, and crawl into your kennels ! ?


? Fat lot he has to talk about,? thought Peter,
who still held the spokes of the wheel, not knowing
what else to do.
The mate leaned on the dodger, watching the
boats pulling slowly back, and occasionally he took
a long glance to where the submarine had dis-
appeared in the mists.
? Now, you lads ; what brought you up here ? ?
Jerry had had time to prepare for the captain?s
question. He held out the message form which
he had thrust into his pocket when first they had
mounted the bridge.
?We took that from Sparks ?Jameson ?sir, just
after he was killed.?
The captain started. ? How ? What do you
mean ? ?
? A shell burst alongside the deck, sir, as he
was bringing you the message. It killed him. We
brought it on.?
So far the captain had not looked at the message.
He kept his bulging grey eyes on the boys. Now
he turned towards the wheel.
? Go down and see what damage is done, Hop-
kins,? he said. ? Have the doctor to Jameson at
once.?
? Right, sir.?
Peter started, becoming aware for the first time
that a seaman was standing just behind him. Evi-
dently the vessel had been less deserted than had
appeared. The man moved off.
? Take it easy now, No. 3,? bawled the mate
64


suddenly, addressing some clumsy persons in the
boats now seeking to secure the dangling falls.
The captain had been scanning the message.
? What sort of a joke do you think this ? ? he
demanded sharply.
Jerry hesitated. ? Er?l don?t understand, sir,?
he replied doubtfully.
?You mean to tell me that this is a genuine
message ? ? persisted the captain angrily.
? Jameson was on his way with it when he
was?hit, sir,? said Jerry emphatically. ?He said
something about atmospherics ; perhaps it was inter-
fered with.?
?You have read it ? ?
Jerry shook his head indignantly, and a faint
snort came from Peter.
? Certainly not, sir.
? Then do so.?
The message being thrust under his nose, Jerry
took it wonderingly. Peter leaned over to scan
it also. The message consisted apparently of a
jumble of meaningless letters and symbols. What
made it more remarkable, however, was that Jameson
had written down some of the signs in their original
dots and dashes instead of the letters for which they
probably stood.
Code, remarked Peter. ?Of course, it would
be.?
? And what good are those muddles of dots and
dashes in the middle ? ? demanded the captain.
? Do you make anything of it ? ?


Jerry shook his head slowly.
?Do you know the Morse code at all ? As used
in the wireless, I mean ? ?
? Yes, sir. I was a listener on the Patagonia
owing to the shortage of operators, and I can read
the wireless signals pretty well now. But I never
heard of such letters as these.?
? And your German connections don?t help you
at all, eh ? ? The captain?s tone was both sharp
and cynical. Jerry started and flushed scarlet.
? I have told you I am British, sir,? he said;
and he managed to control his voice and speak
quietly.
? I don?t like your name, Lieb. Your grand-
father was German, anyway. You don?t even speak
German, I suppose ? ?
? Yes, I do,? retorted Jerry with irritable
defiance. ?My father knew it, and taught me,
thinking it might be useful some day.?
The captain stared at the boy with his intolerant
bulging eyes as though seeking to search his very
soul. Then Jerry, to his utter surprise, heard
himself addressed in fluent German :
?You are not so renegade as to have no love
for the Fatherland, nevertheless ? ?
The tone of voice was still aggressive, but there
was an underlying timbre which, with the peculiar
expression that had crept into the eyes, made Jerry
feel that an effort was being made to convey some-
thing to him. He answered involuntarily, also in
German.


? I do not understand you, Herr Captain. I
have said that I am British and nothing else.?
Peter had stared when the captain spoke in the
strange guttural tongue, but as Jerry answered, he
guessed what language was being employed, and he
drew back to the wheel with an expression of comical
disapproval on his face. Mr. Lever had walked
away to the bridge wing to watch the port boats being
hauled up, and Jerry and the captain were thus left
practically alone facing one another, a challenge and
reply in their eyes.
?Do not beat about the bush, Lieb. I know
you are German. At any minute the undersea
boat may come up. I rely on you to stand by me
when it does.?
?I am no German ! ? cried Jerry, in English
this time. His flush had given place to a deadly
pallor, and he trembled slightly. ? What do you
mean ? You command an English ship, but you
talk ?
Silence 1 ? barked the captain, speaking still
in German. He gritted his teeth a moment, then,
? What I have said must be kept silent. Your life
is nothing in the stakes of this war.?
Turning slightly away so that Peter could not
see, the captain drew his hand quietly from his side
pocket. Something gleamed through his fingers?
a revolver ?
? What has he been saying, Jerry ? ? came an
anxious whisper from Peter.
But Jerry scarcely heard him. He was looking


at that sinister gleam of white metal half hidden
in the captain?s huge hand. Captain Faversham
kept his gaze fixed on the New Zealand boy, and
when he spoke again it was still in German, and in
tones which only just reached the boy.
? There is nothing to stop me shooting you, and
declaring you a spy,? he said. ?War time excuses
anything, and after this my crew will back me in any-
thing. Now be sensible, agree you are no Britisher.?
Then Jerry came to one of those swift decisions
which mark the men of courage and action. Before
either Peter or the captain could divine his intention,
he threw himself forward with the leap of a tiger.
His strong young fingers gripped the captain?s right
hand, imprisoning the revolver.
? Quick, Peter ! ? he yelled. ? He?s a spy !
Call the boys. Call the Patagonias ! ?
Captain Faversham gave a startled roar, twisted
his hand, and the revolver exploded, the bullet
burying itself in the deck. The shock caused Jerry
to relax his hold, and the captain WTenched his
hand free.
? Confound the hoy ! ? stormed the captain, and
he thrust the weapon back into his pocket.
Jerry felt his arm taken firmly, and found Mr.
Lever by his side. ? Steady, youngster ! ? Then
the mate began to laugh. ? Your bluff went a bit
astray that time, sir ! ?
? Devil take the boy, yes. If it wasn?t for his
pluck ...? The captain?s words tailed off into an
unintelligible growl.


? Three of us now that talk the lingo on board ! ?
continued the mate. ? Enough to man a U boat,
eh ? Only we?re all good Englishmen.?
He had evidently made the remark to signify to
the captain his own confidence in Jerry without
any test; but its effect on the captain was extra-
ordinary. He started, gulped, stared at the mate
for a moment, stamped a few paces along the bridge,
and then returned.
?By Jove, Lever! Could we do it ? The
game would be in our hands. Hang it; it might be
possible. With picked men: plucked ones like
these boys ... I must think it out.? He stopped
and turned to the boys. ? Here, you two, come into
the chartroom. I want to talk to you.?
? All the boats are aboard, sir,? interrupted
Mr. Lever. ? Shall we get under way again ? ?
? Yes, get her on her course. One minute,
though. Send those Patagonia men here.?
The mate stepped to the rail. ? Get to your
stations, men. Mr. Blake, collect your men and
fetch them here, please. Captain wishes to speak
to them.?
? What does it all mean, Jerry ? ? asked Peter,
stepping to his chum?s side.
?I?m not sure,? replied Jerry grimly ; ? but I
think I?ve made a first-class fool of myself. Not
that that mad skipper wouldn?t make any one act
silly. I think I see daylight, and after this I?m
going to be sure before I leave this bridge.?
? Here?s the Patty's crowd, Mr. Blake and all,?


said Peter quickly. ?If there is any funny business,
you can rely on their help. Shall I give them a
hail ? ?
? For heaven?s sake, no ! We?ve been idiots
enough, I fancy. Don?t make it worse.?


CHAPTER VI
JERRY SEES LIGHT
THEY heard Mr. Blake?s voice from the boat-
deck below, and Jerry laid his hand on Peter?s
arm.
? Just keep back by the dodger and listen. I
am still in a state of confusion, but I think we shall
understand everything soon now. Keep quiet, so
as not to do anything rash.?
?It has me worried,? grumbled Peter. ? Why
was he going to shoot you ? ?
?He wasn?t! ? snapped Jerry. ? Listen ! ?
Captain Faversham had stepped to the after-
rail and was looking down upon the Patagonia's
men lined up on the deck.
? You?ve made a fine exhibition of yourselves?
for Britishers?haven?t you ? ? he demanded in his
deep-chested roar. ? Still, I won?t rub it in, for
my own men started it all. Next time we are
attacked, however, just act a little more like men
and less like animals. You will have No. 5 boat
for yourselves, and you, Mr. Blake, will take charge.
Be off now, and take a practice boat station.?
The clatter of boots signalled the departure?
wordlessly?of the chastened Patagonias.


? Quick, Jerry ; what are you going to do ? ?
Jerry took a step forward, paused in painful
hesitation, and then he caught Mr. Lever?s eye.
The mate was lounging on the rail, smiling quizzingly
at the boys. He stood erect as Jerry looked at him,
and he strolled over towards them.
? Better think a moment, Lieb,? he said quietly.
? ? Mad ? Faversham is best when he seems worst,
savvy ? You might best serve the Old Country by
?waiting ! ?
With another smile and a meaning nod, he passed
on across the bridge.
? Now, you lads, come along to the chartroom.?
Captain Faversham spoke at Jerry?s elbow. His
voice was gruff, but lacked the usual bluster. ? Both
of you,? he added, as Peter made a rebellious gesture.
Taking it for granted that they would follow,
the captain strode along the bridge and turned into
the tiny chartroom behind the steersman.
? What are you going to do, Jerry ? ? asked
Peter again feverishly.
Jerry took a deep breath. ? Take the mate s
tip,? he answered decisively. ?We?ve a duty to
England, even if we are only two merchant cadets ;
and that duty now is to know the truth about this
ship.?
He stepped out boldly towards the chartroom, at
the door of which Captain Faversham had paused
to look back irritably.
? What are you hanging back for ? ? he demanded.
? To tell my chum he could stay on the bridge


JERRY SEES LIGHT
if he liked,? replied Jerry, watching the captain to
see the effect of his words.
? Here ! I?m not doing that,? gasped Peter.
He stumbled through the narrow doorway at
Jerry?s heels. Captain Faversham drew aside to let
them pass, and he laughed unpleasantly.
? Is that what you are afraid of ? ? he jeered, and
threw on the table the revolver. It fell with a
clatter within easy reach of either of the boys. Just
in time Jerry seized Peter?s hand as it stretched
eagerly for the weapon.
Steady, Pete ! ? he said. Then taking up the
revolver himself, he handed it, butt first, to the
captain. ? I think, sir,? he added with a slight
flush, ? that I owe you an apology.?
?At the least, yes,? snorted the captain. ? You
had better keep that revolver, however ; you may
need it yet. Now, what exactly do you intend to
do??
? Hold my tongue and obey orders, sir.?
Peter gasped; but the captain only smiled. The
boy thought this probably a more dangerous sign
than the customary bluster and violence.
?We are not used to such ?restrictions, as we
have had here, sir,? he explained.
? Are you not failing somewhat in your self-
appointed ? duty ? ? ? persisted the captain cruelly.
Jerry coloured, but he remained calm. ? I don?t
think so,? he said.
The captain pursed his lips for a few moments
while his eyes roved calculatingly over the two boys.
(3.T44) 6 73


Although feeling anything but comfortable, they
returned his gaze, and he went on again with his
questions.
? What exactly has been your opinion of this
ship ? ?
? A foolish one, no doubt; but still not un-
justified,? replied Jerry. ? The fact that the appear-
ance of the ship had been changed, that she had
turned back on her course after a submarine attack,
that we were restricted in our movements as though
we might find out too much if we mixed with the
crew or wandered about the ship ?
? Do you suppose for one moment that an enemy
ship?for that is what your ramblings are intended
to convey?would set to work to arouse your sus-
picions like that ? ?
? Well, you set to work like that, sir ! ?
? Because I had no choice. If that confounded
London-America boat ...? The captain checked
his outburst with an effort. ? And what do you
think the ship is now ? ? he demanded.
? What I should have guessed at first, sir. A
Q boat.?
? A mystery ship ! ? gasped Peter, and stood
looking stunned.
? Do any others of the men with you suspect
this, do you think ? ? was the captain?s next question.
? None, sir ; unless Mr. Blake ?
?He has known from the first. I had hoped
to be rid of you all before too much was noticed.
If I had permitted you to roam about, the hidden
74


JERRY SEES LIGHT
alleyways below deck leading to the gun emplace-
ments, and the large number of men aboard, would
soon have betrayed us. How long would our pres-
ence in these waters have been a secret then, once
your men landed at Rio ? ?
?I see now,? remarked Peter slowly, speaking
for the first time. ?We are sorry we butted in, sir.
The solving of these mystery attacks is too vital a
matter for people like us to hinder it. We should
be thankful you picked us up at all! ?
The captain ignored the remark. ?Of course,?
he resumed abruptly, ? it is obvious that I have use
for you now that I am letting you into the secret.
I saw that you were going to think too much about
that pantomime with the boats, and it was better
to find a use for you than let you become a nuisance.?
He looked at the message form in his hand, laid it
on the table, and glared at it.
?But why did you talk as though you were a
spy, sir ? And threaten me like that ? ? asked
Jerry wonderingly.
? Don?t be a fool, boy ! ? exploded the captain
angrily. ? Wasn?t there just a chance you had
German sympathies ? And could I use men I
distrusted ? Besides, I demand pluck in every one
of my men. You went up one when you handled
this ship, thinking it abandoned, though I would
have broken your necks if the sub had come closer
and you had ruined my plans with your interference.
But I meant to know you thoroughly, and I must
admit you went rather farther than I expected.


Now see here, you say you know about wireless:
are you sure you can make nothing of this ? ?
Jerry bent over the form with wrinkled brow,
to study the groups of dots and dashes over which
the captain?s forefinger travelled.
? None of these are international signals,? he
replied. ? Evidently Jameson wrote them like that
because he could make nothing of them. Both the
Yankees and the Japs have codes of their own ;
perhaps the Germans have contrived one too.?
? And these atmospherics you babbled about ? ?
? If static is bad it might have broken up the
signals, of course, sir. But I think a skilled operator
like Jameson would have made something more of
it than this, all the same.?
? Jameson was saying this morning that con-
ditions were bad,? growled the captain. ? This
weather upset things, I suppose. Do you know
anything about direction finding ? ?
? Nothing at all, sir. I?ve heard of it ?
? What you?ve heard doesn?t interest me.?
A knock on the door interrupted the captain.
It was opened from the outside, the light switching
off as it had done in the wireless cabin. Night had
fallen, and only a dim figure could be seen in the
pale oblong of the doorway.
? Have to confirm report of Jameson?s death,
sir, ? ? said Mr. Lever?s voice. ?? Almost instantaneous,
doctor says.?
? H?m ! Confound ! Useful man, Jameson.
Well, it can?t be helped. I?m putting these lads on
76


JERRY SEES LIGHT
to help Appleby. One can operate, so he says ;
the other can make himself useful during direction
spotting. That submarine must have run short of
fuel or she would have found time to make sure of
us. If she is making a bee line for her base and
starts signalling, we might have some luck at last.?
? I?ve thought of that too, sir. She must be
getting desperate. We have had some disappoint-
ments, and it sounds too good that we should be
guided right to their base; but?well, it?s always the
unexpected that happens, they say.?
? Right! Well, get the directional aerial rigged.
She may start chirping any time, now it?s dark.?
? They are at it now. I?ll see if they are ready.?
The mate turned away.
?You had better be off to the wireless cabin,?
said the captain to the boys. ? I will phone Appleby
to put you right.?
He bustled them out to the deck and closed the
door behind them.
? Well, it gets me ! ? remarked Peter in an awed
voice, as they groped their way cautiously down the
ladder in the darkness on their way to the lower deck.
?We were blind all right. When exactly did you
drop on it ? ?
? R was that ? spy ? business of the captain?s
let in the light. I have had a queer feeling growing
on me that we did not in the least grasp the real
meaning behind the queerness of this ship. When
the skipper talked German and said what he did, I
was so excited that I bit at the bait without trying


to think. But a reaction set in almost from the
explosion of that revolver, and then it all rushed
together to make sense. I saw in a flash that they
had been trying to coax the sub near ; and an idea
of something like a test being in the captain s trick,
to see whether we were to be trusted or not, occurred
to me. By Jove ! I felt a fool in that moment of
understanding.?
? It strikes me,? growled Peter, ? that it isn?t
you who is the fool in this syndicate.?
? Mind out for the broken deck along here,?
warned Jerry. ? Poor old Sparks ! What a horrible
business this war is.?
Peter was silent for a moment, but he was too
excited to remain depressed. ?I?m just thinking,?
he said suddenly, ? that you and I are getting just
where we want to be. It was all right on the good
old Patty , of course, but ?we did envy the chaps
who were doing the fighting, didn?t we ? ?
? I suppose so,? laughed Jerry. ? But we are
not exactly ? fighting ? yet, you know.?
?We are getting mighty near it, anyway,?
retorted Peter, licking his lips. ? Here?s the door.
Come on, open it, and let?s get nearer still.?


CHAPTER VII
A NEW JOB
A FIERCE gust of wind which blew the cold rain
swirling around them hurried Jerry in open-
ing the wireless cabin door. The cabin gaped
blackly before them, but the boys stepped in eagerly
enough, urged by the wet outside and the prospect
of something to be done inside. Peter took the
door from Jerry?s fingers and swung it to behind
them. The warm electric light flashed up, to show
them Appleby standing by the table facing them.
It was the first time they had been able to have
a good look at him. He was a tall, thin-faced young
fellow, with a very serious expression. Although no
more than twenty years old, he had deep lines on his
forehead and round the comers of his mouth, which
added to his solemnity and gave an impression of
unfriendliness.
For a few seconds they regarded one another in
silence, and then Peter, eager and impatient to be
busy, broke the silence.
?We?ve bad news for you, Sparks. We are
going to help you.?
?So I hear. My first name is Harry. If we
are to work together you had better drop the


Sparks. That is all very well for outsiders to
use, but you will be Sparks yourselves now.?
Peter?s eyes sparkled. ?It sounds good, eh,
Jerry ? I?ve ached to be on a warship ever since
the war started. And now ?here is our chance ! ?
? For a time, yes,? smiled Jerry. ? Unfor-
tunately, I?m afraid the captain will shoot us out
at the first opportunity.?
? He may not,? blurted out Peter thoughtlessly,
? now that Jameson ?oh ! I?m sorry, Harry ! ?
He stopped in confusion, and looked apologetically
at Appleby.
Harry had turned to the table, and he moved a
message pad aimlessly. ?It doesn?t matter,? he
said steadily. ? It?s all in the game. We have been
in other Q boats before this; all the crowd on this
boat. And we have kind of come to realize ?it?s
death for a lot of us, sooner or later.? He stopped
and gazed at the table as though seeing there a
picture of past events. The two boys behind him
stood silent and motionless.
The rattle of the bridge telephone buzzer broke
the tension. Harry slipped on the phones, and in
a moment was the efficient wireless operator again.
? Hallo ! Yes. Very good, sir. We will get
busy right away. No, not a thing yet. I quite
understand; if we don?t locate them it won?t be our
fault. I think so ; they seem bright kids. Right.
?Bye.?
Dropping the receiver back on its hook, Harry
turned to the boys again.


A NEW JOB
? Now, listen attentively, both of you. You are
taking on a responsible job. Not only may the safety
of this ship depend on your care and accuracy, but
possibly the safety of the convoys ; and I don?t
need to stress what that means these days.?
? You are here after these mysterious raiders ? ?
interrupted Peter eagerly.
? That is our job, obviously,? replied Harry.
? At the first hint of new methods in the South
Atlantic the Admiralty naturally sent off Commander
Faversham.?
? I knew the name was familiar to me! ? ex-
claimed Jerry. ?Of course they don?t broadcast
much information; but little things leak out, and I
must have heard him mentioned.?
? Some of his exploits have appeared in the
London newspapers,? said Harry. ? But you will,
of course, not have seen many of them. The Huns
could tell you plenty about him though.?
? He has some queer ways,? ruminated Peter.
?No doubt.? Harry almost relaxed into a smile.
?Now are you going to let me finish explaining or
not ? ? Mad ? Faversham may deserve his nickname,
but his ? mad ? notions seem generally to come off.
But, as I was trying to say, we are out to get hold
of these subs, to destroy them, and, if possible,
to discover the method of their successful attacks.
This is the second convoy we have accompanied
over the danger spots ? ?Peter was about to exclaim
at this confirmation of his own suspicions, but caught
a glitter in Harry?s eye and thought better of it


?? But,? continued Harry, keeping his gaze on
the restless Peter, ? so far we have had no luck.
To-day looked promising, but it fizzled somehow.
The skipper is determined to come to grips, and so
we go to and fro in these waters looking for trouble.
If we can only keep in touch with that sub to-night,
perhaps we may locate him to-morrow.?
? We ? began Peter.
? Shut up ! Now, you see that gong on the
bulkhead ? When that rings sharply once, a sub
has been sighted ; every one aboard gets to battle
station quietly and unobtrusively. We in here sit
tight and wait. When it rings a series of short
rings, the sub has forced its presence upon attention
and the ? panic ? commences. The panic gang rush
the boats and abandon ship. That doesn?t affect
us, we still sit tight, but take care not to show our-
selves at door or port. Now, if the sub is coaxed
near enough to the ? abandoned ? ship, the gong
goes into one long continuous peal, and then . . .?
Harry concluded his explanation with an expressive
toss of the hands.
?You mean, she gets it in the neck ? ? cried
Peter excitedly. ? Gee ! If that fellow had only
come near this afternoon we would have seen all
the fun.? He giggled suddenly. ? And to think
how our mob lent themselves so innocently to the
pantomime ! I suppose they think they have had a
lucky escape I ?
? Perhaps they have had,? responded Harry
grimly.


There was a knock on the door, and the extin-
guishing of the light announced its opening. The
new arrival proved to be a steward laden with a
heavy tray on which were a large teapot, cups, saucers,
and jug, and a plentiful supply of sandwiches and
fruit.
? I?ve brought enough for all three, sir,? he said
briskly. ? The mate tipped me off about the new
arrangements.?
? Right, thanks, steward.?
? After dark is our busy time,? explained Harry
as soon as the steward had gone. ?We will have
our tea standing while I rig the gear. Will you pour
out the juice, Peter ? Just grab the eats as you want
them.?
? We?ll do that,? agreed Peter readily. ?Tm
starving.?
? What was the idea of keeping our chaps aft
of that rope, though ? ? asked Jerry curiously, be-
tween mouthfuls of sandwich. ? A few more feet
of deck, and they would have been dry and much
more happy.?
Harry gave one of his rare smiles. ?If that
sub had ventured nearer you would have under-
stood,? he replied. ? Especially if you had been
for?ard of that rope. There is a 6-inch gun behind
each of those deckheads ! ?
? Well, I?m blowed ! And those deckheads look
absolutely immovable.?
? Commander Faversham does nothing by halves.
Now look here. ...?


While they talked, Harry had arranged in a space
at the left of the table a square mahogany box with
an ebonite top on which was mounted a tuning handle.
Leads were taken from terminals at the ends of the
box to the tuning apparatus which bore the Fleming
valves customary with the five kilowatt set in use
at the time. The boys, munching busily, bent over
to inspect, and saw that the top of the box bore a
series of white lines radiating from the handle in
the centre.
? This,? said Harry, ? is a direction finder. A
special four-way aerial has been erected, and by
switching over thus ? (he threw over a heavy
switch), ? the apparatus is connected in the receiving
circuit. So far, this does not greatly matter; but
listen carefully while I explain your part of the
business. I will listen in on the ordinary aerial
till I hear the station we want to locate. At once
I will switch over, and it will be your job, Jerry,
to get that same station on the finder. The station
will only come in on full strength when the pointer
here is directed towards it, so you must spin it
round, and steady it so that you are getting the
maximum strength of signal. Here are a spare
pair of phones, slip them on and you are ready for
your part. I will take down the signals, and warn
you if you are not holding your station at maximum.?
? And don?t I come in this anywhere ? ? de-
manded Peter in dawning dismay.
? Yes, you can give the readings to the bridge.
You see this heavy line running lengthwise ? Well,


I need hardly tell you that that is on the fore-and-
aft line of the ship ; its exact position is ensured by
these brass stops on the table which grip the box.
The heavy line at right angles is, of course, the
beam line. Angles from these two lines are, as
you see, marked and calibrated from the beam line
fore and aft. Being seamen you will understand
that all right. Now, when the switch is turned so
that the signals of the distant station are at their
loudest, it obviously indicates the direction of the
station in relation to the ship. What you have to
do, Peter, is to read the angle and telephone it to
the bridge the moment Jerry steadies the pointer.
Do you both understand ? It is not quite as easy
as it sounds, by the way ; you will need to be
nippy.?
? I can believe that,? agreed Jerry. ? Every
slight deviation of the ship from her course will
seriously alter the angle.?
? Holy smoke, yes I ? Peter?s face lengthened.
? And we know what steersmen are.?
? That?s why I am glad of an extra man,? said
Harry. ? Poor old Jimmy and I had our hands
full sometimes. Well, are you satisfied with your
individual jobs ? ?
?Yes, let Jerry do the wireless part of it. He
is used to that sort of thing.?
With a nod, Jerry fitted on the head phones and
bent to make a detailed inspection of the radiating
lines.
? Do I ring up the bridge now ? ? queried Peter.


? No, not yet. They will be all ready for us.
The officer in the chartroom has head phones
attached, too. He has compass, chronometer, and
chart before him. Whenever Jerry alters the pointer
you must immediately shout out the reading. The
officer will be listening; he will have our course
and speed continually laid off on the chart. By
adding the angles he will build up triangles which
will give the exact position of the distant station.
? In other words, a series of simple bearings,?
remarked Peter.
? Exactly. Now, if you are ready, I will ring
up the bridge.?
? One moment,? interposed Jerry. ? Won?t we
get a tangle of stations, many of them friendly ? ?
? Never heard a German sub signalling ? ?
? Never. They wouldn?t trust me on the Patty
when we got in really dangerous waters.?
? Well, you won?t mistake its shrill note when you
do hear it. At first I will pick up the station roughly
and leave you to do the fine work. You will soon
get the hang of it. As soon as one fellow stops,
switch round to search out the answering signal.
I don?t want to stop to switch over every time.?
? And how will I know when it is a fresh station
or not ? ? asked Peter in dismay. ? I haven?t any
phones ??cept this one to the bridge, of course.?
?No need,? said Harry crisply. ? The angles
will tell the officer all he wants to know. Note that
the readings are numbered the same for each
quadrant ?just like a compass. You must say
86


A NEW JOB
port or starboard, and bow or quarter with each
reading. Now, ready ? ?
? All-ee light-ee ! ? chirped Peter, and stretched
out his hand for the receiver.
? Good ! Give three short rings on the bell-push
?that?s right. Now he is listening. Say nothing
unnecessary, for he will be on the alert. Now,
Jerry ! ?
Harry had thrown the switch back to the normal
aerial, and at once the chirping of a station began.
Harry listened, his hand on the tuning dials. Now
and again he paused to make a note in the log book.
Jerry noticed that Harry never altered the wave-
length very much ; evidently he knew where to
tune for the submarines. Notes, harsh and musical,
loud and weak came and went. As time went on
they grew in number, but still the three waited
patiently.
? Yes ; all 0.K.? said Peter suddenly, evidently
in reply to a question from the chartroom.
Harry had begun to scribble quickly on a message
pad, and he quite ignored Peter?s voice. The two
boys watched him in silence till he hastily scribbled
official details on the form, and then ripped it off
and took up a metal cylinder from a wire basket
at the back of the table. Slipping the form into
the cylinder, he opened a flap on the bulkhead, and
the boys heard the hiss of a pneumatic tube. In a
twinkling the message was on its way to the bridge.
? Well, I will say, you have things arranged to
a nicety,? remarked Peter admiringly.


Harry nodded and stretched himself in luxurious
relaxation.
? Getting tired, you two ? You will get used to
this sort of thing in time. It became dark earlier
than usual to-night, so we had to be ready early;
but I doubt if they will start before another hour ;
they are fairly regular, and have no need to hurry.?
?We are all right,? replied Jerry. He saw that
they had been listening for nearly two hours already.
What was another hour more or less, provided they
heard the subs in the end ?
With a nod of approval, Harry set himself to
the tuning again, apparently prepared to continue
patiently searching all night if need arose.


CHAPTER VIII
THE NIGHT WATCH
AT about half-past nine the steward opened the
L cabin door.
? Will you be wanting tea or coffee, sir ? ?
He did not bother to come right inside and shut
the door, but hailed them from where he stood, and
his voice sounded queer coming through the pitch
darkness which prevailed. Gazing that way they
could not even make out the outline of the door-
way ; no ray of light from ship or sky relieved the
blackness.
? Coffee for me, please,? said Harry. ? You
two had better have tea, though ; coffee will keep
you awake when you go off watch.?
? One coffee and two teas ; right, sir.? The
steward had snapped the door to and gone before
either of the boys could reply.
The light dazzled them all for a moment, as it
came on once more.
? But you won?t keep watch all night, surely ? ?
exclaimed Jerry, rubbing his eyes. ? I can take a
watch, and call you if I hear anything important.?
? I will let you take over in the small hours,?
0,744) 7


agreed Harry. ? There is rarely much doing then ;
even the subs have said their say as a rule, and you
will be all right. But you must try and snatch
a bit of sleep before then if possible. I see you
have both calmed down somewhat now, and if I
were you ? ?(he nodded to Peter) ?? I should get a
book from inside there to read. It will make the
waiting less tedious.?
? But if anything happens ? ?
? I will soon let you know. It may be a long
while before we hear a sub.?
? In that case ?I did notice some interesting-
looking novels over your bunk.?
? Do you take the Poldhu Press ? ? asked Jerry.
? Sometimes. If there is nothing special doing,
that is. It comes in about ten o?clock in these
longitudes of course, and that is generally a busy
time for the subs. Also, we have to listen for
Admiralty long-range signals at special times.?
? But haven?t you located the subs on your
previous hunts ? ? asked Peter, as he came slowly
from the inner cabin fluttering the pages of a detec-
tive novel through his fingers. ? How is it you have
not landed one ? ?
? Too far off each time,? explained Harry.
?We get the position in the early evening; but
in the morning, when we reach the place, the sub
is off somewhere else. If we could locate one
towards dawn, we might, with luck, catch him.?
? They are always near enough to attack the
convoys,? remarked Peter slyly.


THE NIGHT WATCH
? Did you expect them to signal so as to advertise
their presence then ? ? laughed Jerry.
? I never thought of that? grinned Peter rue-
fully. ? But you got something to-day,? he added
suddenly. ? That message . . .?
Harry shook his head sadly. ? I only reached the
cabin as Jimmy finished taking that down. He
seemed fearfully excited, and rushed off, leaving me
to take over the watch ; but by the carbon copy he
left there was little of use, and the X?s were inter-
fering something fearful.?
? X?s ? ? queried Peter vaguely.
?Static-atmospherics,? explained Harry; ?that
is the technical abbreviation for them. They have
been very bad lately ; of course these latitudes are
troubled by them greatly.?
He started suddenly, and his hand, which had
been slowly moving the tuning switches, jerked
nervously to and fro, and then steadied at a particular
point. Jerry heard in his phones a shrill piping
note which increased in volume as Harry adjusted
the tuner until it was almost deafening. Harry
slipped his earpieces slightly aside to weaken the
sound.
?By Jove ! She?s near,? he exclaimed. ? You
had better let me fix the finder; you will hardly tell
the difference with sigs so strong.?
? Do I get ready ? ? almost shouted Peter, and
in his excitement he dropped the novel on the floor
with a bang.
? Yes; but don?t get flustered. No cause for


emotion. If you squat on the end of the table you
can read the pointer comfortably and still be close
to the phone transmitter. That?s fixed her.?
While he talked, Harry?s sensitive fingers had
been manipulating the handle of the direction
finder to which he had switched over. Jerry fancied
he heard slight variations in the strength of the
signals, and when he moved aside his earpieces as
Harry had done, he found that he could detect the
alteration quite easily.
? She?s on; shout out! ? said Harry sharply,
with a glance at Peter.
? Starboard bow 20,? said Peter distinctly into
the transmitter mouthpiece.
? St?bd bow 20,? came the answer in the receiver.
? Hold her as near as you can,? said Harry
quickly, as he relinquished the finder to Jerry. ?I?ll
take the message.?
The signal had changed from a monotonous
succession of V?s to the rapid longs and shorts of
the Morse code. Harry?s hand travelled swiftly
over the message pad.
? Well, there is nothing mysterious about these
signals, at any rate so far as the letters are con-
cerned,? ruminated Jerry. Through his mind was
passing a picture of the message which had puzzled
both the captain and himself that day. He twitched
the knob of the ebonite handle nervously this way
and that; but, so far as he could make out, there was
little or no change in signal strength. As he became
accustomed to his task he was able to steal longer
92


THE NIGHT WATCH
glances at the pad on which the message was grow-
ing. A meaningless string of letters met his eye ;
Harry was writing them in block letters in groups
of five. Abruptly the signals stopped. With a
quick movement, Harry tore the top forms from the
pad, separated the original from the carbon dupli-
cate, and flung the first across the table.
? Here, Peter, stick that in the carrier, will you ?
Look out, Jerry ; we must pick up the reply.?
He leant over, and his practised finger spun the
handle. Immediately there leaped into hearing
another shrill note, but very much weaker than the
other had been. Jerry slipped the phones into
place again to be able to read the signal. The roar
of the pneumatic tube as Peter opened it was enough
to inconvenience Jerry this time, but that was only
momentary, and the boy found that with this distant
signal the smallest movement of the handle altered
the strength of reception. Harry was scribbling
away on the pad again, and Jerry felt satisfaction
that he had mastered the working of the finder so
quickly.
? Starboard bow 78,? said Peter.
The signals piped steadily on, with occasional
short breaks during which Jerry felt round for other
signals, especially for the loud note of the near-by
station, but it remained disappointingly silent. The
distant signals, however, piped persistently on.
? He?s got a lot to say,? growled Harry, ripping
off still another message and tossing it to Peter.
? Instructions, I suppose, from a flagship.?


? Hallo ! ? said Peter ; then in a moment he
turned to Harry with a grin. ? Captain wants to
know ? why the devil ? you haven?t given the signal
strength.?
? Tell him first station 10, other 4,? snapped
Harry.
Jerry again twisted the handle as the signals
made another pause, and this time he heard with glee
the loud note swell in the telephones. Slipping
aside his earpieces with quite a professional gesture,
he steadied the pointer at maximum.
? Starboard bow 16,? said Peter.
? St?bd bow 16,? echoed monotonously from the
bridge.
? Strength 10,? said Harry as he scribbled.
? Strength 10,? said Peter.
? Strength 10,? came the response.
The sub stopped abruptly. Harry flicked over
the switch connecting the ordinary aerial, and at
once a signal was heard of moderate strength and
of the familiar shrill tone. Like lightning Harry
changed back to the direction finder, and he spun
the handle. A slight chirp as the pointer passed
one place, and Harry had twitched the handle back
in a flash. The shrill note came in, loud and
steady.
? Starboard quarter 56,? said Peter promptly.
? St?bd qu?rer 56,? unfailingly answered the
bridge.
Harry had turned to his pad, but already the
signal had ceased. Again the switch was changed
94


THE NIGHT WATCH
over, and again a signal was heard. This time the
pointer of the finder indicated the eastward more.
? Port bow 32,? said Peter.
? These must be acknowledgments of that busy
chap?s messages,? said Harry, for again the signal
had been of the briefest, in fact, they had only
caught the tail end in time to get the direction.
? Here, send this last one to the bridge, Peter.?
The minutes ticked by as they waited in silence
for a resumption of the German signals, but none
came. With a start Harry saw by the clock that
they had been receiving for nearly an hour and a half.
? Nothing more just now, evidently,? said
Harry at last.
?By Jove ! That fellow was close, that first one,
wasn?t he ? ? remarked Jerry. ? She might be in
sight in the morning.?
?Too much luck to hope for, I?m afraid,? replied
Harry with a wry grimace. ?It is when they are a
long way off at this time of night that they have
a way of bobbing up unexpectedly in the morning.
You see, being able to travel on the surface at night
they cover great distances, and one can?t be sure
where they will steer next. Now I will be picking
up some Admiralty sigs for a while and won?t need
the finder.?
He tuned in at points which he evidently knew
well, and until well on towards 10 o?clock he was
taking down messages from far-away England.
These he kept in a batch until he had them all, and
then dispatched Peter with them to the bridge.


? Just in time to get Poldhu,? he remarked to
Jerry as Peter shut the door, and two minutes later
Jerry was leaning over reading the latest war news
as it grew on the message pad. The boy admired
the casual w T ay in which Harry not only took down
the long message, but made comments on it as he
went; he did not even pause in his writing when the
light went out as Peter re-entered the cabin.
? Are they making any headway with the de-
ciphering of those sub messages ? ? he asked over
his shoulder.
Peter grinned. ? The mate is scratching away
at books with his hair standing on end, and the
skipper is rumbling like a volcano. But what it
all signifies I don?t know.?
? Doesn?t sound very healthy,? said Harry.
? There, that?s finished,? he added, and threw down
his pencil. ?You two get off to bed now. If a
stray sub speaks up I will manage him, and if things
get brisk I will call you. Don?t undress, of course.
You can each take a short watch in the small hours
if all seems quiet, and we will all be up and busy
towards dawn, when there is a slight chance of a
sub powwow before starting the day?s business.?
? What shall we do if there is an attack ? ?
asked Jerry.
? The skipper will let you know in good time.
He never forgets anything. Probably he is leaving it
in case he gets one of his bright ideas. You know
he has a sudden fit, gets a brain-wave, and rushes
it through with a bang. Extraordinary stunts he
96


THE NIGHT WATCH
tries, which most naval authorities would condemn
as insane. But somehow he brings them off, and
succeeds because they are so unexpected, I suppose.
I know this weird business of the successful night
attacks on the convoys has him rattled, and he is
waiting for a bright idea, like a cat watching a mouse
hole for a rat.?
? Do rats live in mouse holes ? ? queried Peter
innocently.
? Oh, go to bed,? growled Harry. ? You?re too
bright for this time of night.? He turned his back,
and adopted the convenient expedient of appearing
to tune in a station.
Peter grinned, and jerked his thumb in the
direction of the sleeping cabin.
?Too bright! ? agreed Jerry as he stifled a yawn
? This excitement is wearing me out.?


CHAPTER IX
POOR OLD LAME DUCK I
IN spite of the feeling of weariness which had
possessed him for the last half-hour before turn-
ing into his bunk, Jerry found it impossible to
sleep for some time. He lay thinking of a thousand
things, and the events of the past few days crowded
in on him till he felt as though they must have
occupied months in the doing. Several times he
heard Harry speak to the bridge, and each time
he raised his head eagerly to listen ; but each time
he was disappointed ; only time signals or weather
reports or submarine warnings for quite distant
waters seemed to be ?on the air.? Then Harry
started to talk hazily on for hours and hours, and
Peter was urging him, Jerry, to do something which
was not quite clear, while Captain Faversham stood
glowering and pointing a revolver at them both
until Harris rushed in and shouted that the ship
was sinking, which so angered the captain that he
aimed the revolver at the ship?s bell and began to
pepper it furiously . . .
jerry sprang up in his bunk in alarm to hear the
harsh clanging of the gong on the bulkhead. Day-
-98


light was filtering through the curtain. He had
been sleeping, then, and dreamed this muddle of
nonsense, perhaps for hours, probably only in the
last few seconds. But the ringing of the gong had
been no dream. It had stopped now, but Peter
was already hurrying past the curtain, and Harry?s
voice came from the direction of the operating table.
? Jump to it! There are two subs in sight.
They have a ship held up, and we can?t pretend not
to see them much longer. Jump to it! The skipper
wants you for the panic party. Show a leg ! ?
? Have we to leave the ship ? ? cried Peter, in a
voice keen with disappointment, as Jerry joined him
in the outer cabin.
? Yes ?when the signal goes, of course. Series
of short rings, remember. Lay low till it comes,
you may spoil the show otherwise. Skipper says
you are to go in No. i boat.?
? No. sis our boat ? began Jerry.
One , I said,? snapped Harry. ? Skipper has
some idea?one of his brain-waves, I suppose. Said
something about you speaking German, and he
wants you for something. No. iis his boat, anyway.?
? But he stays on board, doesn?t he ? ?
? Usually, yes. He has some idea, I tell you.
Keep back from that port. They will have glasses
on to us, and we have to play ? tramp,? and a stupid
one at that.?
?Where are they ? ? demanded both boys at once.
? About four points off the bow. They have
some poor devil of a craft bailed up. I think it is


that London-America boat that passed us last night.
Probably they are robbing her of fresh stores before
sinking her.?
? I see them ?no, there is only one. Where is
the other ? ?
Harry craned over to peer carefully through the
port. The rain had quite cleared, and the sea was
a sheet of shining grey in the early light. The
motionless merchant ship showed up plainly, rock-
ing heavily in the trough of the big rollers. Some
little distance from her a black object like a small
boat stood above the water.
? She has submerged,? cried Harry. ? Look !
The other is going down too.?
Even as he spoke, the small black object sank
smoothly into the waves.
? Won?t they know we?ve seen ?em ? ? demanded
Peter anxiously. ? They were as plain as a pike-
staff against this pearly sea. They?ll be suspicious,
and sheer off.?
? Not they ! They can?t tell how plainly they
could be seen, and will conclude we are blundering
over to the London-America joker to see if he has
broken down. Tramps are notoriously greedy for
salvage. They are sneaking over now to trap us.?
? Even if they suspected us, they would still
attack,? agreed Jerry eagerly.
? Yes. Hope they don?t suspect, though. If
they torpedo we may not get a smack at them ; but
if they come up to shell us, we should give one a
finisher, perhaps both ! ?


? One must be standing by to threaten the
London-America boat,? remarked Jerry. ? She is
not making off.?
? Why doesn?t she take a chance ? ? began
Peter. Then, ? There she is,? he broke off suddenly.
In his excitement he put his hand almost through
the porthole.
? Keep your arm down and stand back,? growled
Harry, and he thrust Peter farther from the port.
? Why ?what ?look ! Why ! ? Peter could only
gibber in his anxiety to draw their attention.
? Eh ? What ? What are you gabbling about ? ?
? The other sub. She?s not by the London-
America boat. She?s right round on our quarter.?
The other two craned eager but incredulous
necks. Harry snatched up a pair of binoculars and
trained them on the sea.
By Jove ! You?re right. You have good eyes.
Although it is standing up like a black streak against
this light sea, I should never have spotted a periscope
at that distance. Then why ?
? The other one?s up,? interrupted Jerry, and
pointed nearer and for?ard of the beam.
From the shimmering, glassy ocean there had
broken that long black outline again. It rose and
fell on the long rolling swell. The light was rapidly
growing, and just as the figures of men were seen
to erupt from the top of the conning tower, a rosy
flush fell across the ocean and gleamed on the shiny
iron of the submarine.
? She?s not half a mile away,? breathed Jerry.


? And coming straight for us,? exulted Peter.
? She is manning her gun,? added Harry grimly;
but there was a note of triumph in his voice.
? There ! ?
Cr-r-r-r-ng ! Cr-r-r-r-ng ! Cr-r-r-r-ng !
The loud-tongued gong over their heads burst
into quick alarming rings.
? No. i boat, remember ! Right for?ard. Good
luck ! ? cried Harry. The boys, with some inco-
herent answer, ran for the door.
? You?re the cowardly operators escaping! ?
laughed Harry as he danced gleefully about; the
reverse of the severe, almost gloomy operator of the
night before.
His voice was drowned by the harsh gurgling
roar of the ship?s siren. The same babble of cries
which had marked yesterday?s ? panic ? arose from
for?ard ; but this time what different feelings pos-
sessed the boys as they heard it!
?By Jove! They do it well,? gurgled Peter, as
he leaped nimbly over the broken deck amidships ;
and in this tense moment he even forgot the tragedy
of yesterday.
? Here?s our crowd. They mean it anyway I ?
shouted Jerry.
Out on to the deck poured the boat?s crew
from the Patagonia , charging once more for the
boats.
? They?re better, anyway,? remarked Peter ap-
provingly. ? They have had their lesson.?
Though the seamen were running at full speed,
102


they were keeping in order and not thrusting one
another aside. As they reached the ladder to the
boat-deck they sprang up in pairs, with the result
that they got up much more quickly. Suddenly
Tomkins, the complaining sea-lawyer, slipped on
the greasy iron deck and fell heavily. On the
instant Harris, who was next ahead, swung round and
pulled his shipmate to his feet.
? That?s the stuff! ? exclaimed Jerry. ? There
is good in Harris.?
? Hi! But that?s too bad.?
A number of the Chowkidar's crew, acting panic-
stricken fear rather too realistically, came rushing
along the deck and threw Tomkins and his helper
violently aside.
?Ere ! Lummy ! ?Ere ! By crummy ! You
cowards ! I?ll learn yers ! ?
Dropping Tomkins?s arm, Harris spun round,
and with a vicious underarm jab caught one of the
rushing sailors under the jaw and flung him headlong
to the deck.
? Here ?steady, Harris ! ?
Jerry reached the group just in time to seize
the steward?s arm as he was swinging it at another
man. Peter was gulping with helpless laughter.
? ? Lummy! ?Ang it all! The bloomin ? cowards 1? ?
? It?s all right. Let ?em go.?
? All right be ?anged ! If I lay ?ands ?
?Go on. It?s clear for us. Up you go.? Peter
lent his aid in urging the indignant Cockney up the
ladder.


? Where?s Tommy ? ? began Harris remon-
stratingly.
? He went up with that crowd,? replied Jerry.
? Course ?e would ! Come on. No. s?s our
boat.?
? Yes ; you go on. We?re stopping here.?
The trio paused at the ladder top. The boat-
deck was a scene of wild confusion. Men were
flinging themselves into the outswung boats, or
rushing across to less crowded ones. Jerry noted,
however, with a glow of admiration, that through
the seeming panic ran a thread of order, and no
matter how excitedly a movement was made it
achieved its purpose towards getting the boats
rapidly and efficiently into the water.
? What?s the sub doing ? ? demanded Peter.
? Firing,? replied Jerry. ? A shell burst aft
just now.?
? Did it ? You can hear nothing in this uproar.
BANG !
There was a vivid flash and a report in front of
the bridge.
The Chozckidar listed heavily and began to come
round in a sweeping curve. A swift glance showed
Jerry the bridge, to all appearances, deserted; but
after his experiences of the previous night he had
his suspicions that the ? unsteered ? vessel was not
veering nearer to the submarine by mere accident.
Boom ! Bang !
They heard the shriek of the shell this time, for


POOR OLD LAME DUCK 1
some of the din was subsiding and the siren had
stopped. It tore through the funnel and burst just
beyond, sending fragments of iron whining through
the air.
No. 3 boat was away, and No. 2 lowering. No. 1
appeared to be in difficulties.
? Come on, Peter ! ? Jerry ran towards the
boat to aid in clearing her away. What had happened
to Harris neither of the boys had noticed, but he
had vanished from their side.
Boom ! Bang !
The explosion was muffled this time; but the
ship trembled to it, and a cloud of steam burst up
through the fiddley and swirled over the deck.
The beat of the engines ceased abruptly, and the
ship rolled with the heaviness of a lifeless hulk.
Captain Faversham was bellowing and running
about the lifeboat. It was now the only one left
on the ship except No. 4 opposite, but that was being
lowered.
Boom! Bang !
The deck aft?over the wireless cabin, it seemed
?ripped suddenly upward. Jerry?s eyes fixed on
the spot in horror, trying to calculate just how close
to the operating cabin it had actually burst.
? Now, you darned brats, what the devil are you
waiting for ? Jump in I Are we to wait all day
for you ? ?
The familiar roaring voice recalled the lads to
action. There was no time now to speculate on
Harry?s fate, the boat was lowering away.
(3,744) g IO j,


Boom. Bang!
The ship shuddered under another hull hit.
? Fancy the curs shelling a helpless tramp ! ?
Jerry gritted his teeth.
? They may suspect . . . Good lord ! There?s
Harris ! ? exclaimed Peter, pointing to the fore-
sheets of the boat.
? The blighter ! He went for the nearest boat
and hopped in.?
Peter?s reply was checked by a commotion of
yells and curses from the other side of the ship.
? What was that ? ? gasped Jerry. ? One of the
boats hit ? ?
?Eh ? No ! ? snorted a sailor contemptuously.
? Only the tip-up boat.?
? Tip-up boat ? ? puzzled Jerry.
? Yes. They?ve let go a fall and all been tipped
into the water. You know.?
? Good heavens ! You call that nothing ? ?
exclaimed Peter.
The sailor twisted his head at the words, and
saw for the first time to whom he was speaking.
? Here ! What are you doing in this boat ? ?
he demanded aggressively.
? Captain?s orders,? retorted Jerry.
The man still stared doubtfully; but at that
moment the boat took the water and lifted on a
wave. The ship being stopped and the sea calm,
the falls were thrown off easily, and the boat pulled
clear of the slowly rolling hull.
? Keep your heads, men, and wait absolutely


for the signal before you act. Mr. Lever made it
clear to you all what I intend to do, didn?t he ?
Any one not understand ? Right; pull hard now
till we clear the stern, then pull raggedly. What
happened to that first sub we passed ? ?
? She was making after her mate, sir,? called one
of the men. ? You can?t see her now for the hull.?
? Right. Now let your pulling flag.?
The lifeboat slid past the Chowkidar?s stern, and
the boys saw the two submarines. The nearer was
the one firing. She was making to cross the Chow-
kidar's stern, and beside the gun?s crew there were
several men on her deck and conning tower, most
of them apparently armed with rifles. The consort
was coming up rapidly, and a few men were also
on her conning tower, but her gun was not in action.
The gun flashed as the lifeboat appeared* and
again the Chowkidar shivered to the blow. Jerry
turned his head to watch the stricken vessel. She
was well down at the stern, the falls from the after-
boats already dragging on the waves. Around her
pieces of wreckage floated. She looked dejected
and melancholy, sinking slowly into the ocean. A
solitary lifeboat?No. 4 ?dangled forlornly by its
for?ard fall. The other two port boats were pulling
for dear life beyond the ship?s bows to get out of the
line of fire.
? What are we going to do ? ? demanded Peter
quietly of Jerry. ? What did he mean by what he
said to the men ? We seem to be making for
the sub.?


? I don?t know; but I?m beginning to have an
inkling. We should have asked him, I suppose.
But, Peter, if it is what I think?it sounds incredibly
mad ?but I think, old chum, we have fallen in with
a very daring and resourceful man.?
? I?ve no doubt of that. But explain yourself.
What the dickens do you mean ? ?
Jerry did not answer. He was looking at the
nearer U boat with a sparkle of excitement in his
eyes. They were now only about a quarter of a
mile from the enemy craft, which was approaching
them at about twelve knots, and would therefore
reach them in a matter of minutes. From the atti-
tude of the officers on the conning tower they were
discussing the lifeboat?s movements.
Captain Faversham spoke again, and his voice
was so quiet that all eyes turned to him as he stood
steadily at the tiller.
? Keep your weapons out of sight till the moment
comes, men, and don?t move till I give the command.
We won?t have more than one chance to succeed,
and if we fail they will sink every one of our boats.
? Sunk without trace ! ? You understand ? ?
? Here ! Lummy ! Yer don?t mean that, sir.
?Ere ! What are you a-rowin? over to? em for, sir ? ?
The momentary silence which had fallen over
the boat at the skipper?s words was punctured by
the shrill, alarmed voice of Harris. Most of the
men laughed at his great alarm, although some told
him hoarsely to ? shut up.? Jerry turned towards
Commander Faversham.


? What are we to do, sir ? ? he asked calmly.
? I take it we are here for a purpose.?
A murmur of approval greeted the courageous
and obviously eager words of the boy.
? Ah, yes ; I had forgotten you for the moment.
Events have been rather hurried, Lieb ! ?
? Lieb ! What kind of a name is that ? ? Jerry
caught the hoarse whisper of a big hairy seaman
standing near Harris.
? We intend to capture one of those submarines,?
explained the captain calmly. ?It seems the only
way to achieve the purpose which brought us to
those waters. We must capture the one and sink
the other. They always demand the ship?s papers
from the master, and they are thinking that I am
hurrying to them now in a blue funk to curry favour
by giving my papers up without demand. They will
order us to stop when a few yards from them.
Instead of that we shall make a dash and board them.
They are keeping low in the water to avoid making
a good target should the Chowkidar prove a trap.
Shoot to kill, lads, and jump aboard somehow.
Graham, Kelly, and Macpherson, you follow me
straight to the conning tower ; you five gunners
there, make for the gun and turn it on the other sub.
The rest mop up the men on the decks and then
follow into the conning tower.?
? ?Ere! Hi! I ain?t coming into no mad trick like
that! Lemme go back! Leggo me arm, will yer ? ?
Harris had leaped to his feet, but in a flash the
big seaman near him had seized the little steward?s


arm and had forced him down into the bottom of
the boat.
? Keep that man quiet,? rapped the commander.
? Aye, I?ll do that ?or scrag him! ? The burly
seaman leaned menacingly over his victim. Silence
reigned.
The boys had recovered from their stupefaction.
?So that is it! ? breathed Jerry in ecstasy. ? Yes,
it?s easy because it?s so mad. And the Chowkidar ??
Boom! Bang !
The gun, which had paused in its bombardment
for a while, had resumed action at the still floating
Chowkidar. Almost mechanically the boys turned
their heads to observe the effect of the shot. The
shell burst with a vicious flash on one corner of the
steering house. Fragments of iron flew under the
impact, and then suddenly the whole upper half of
the house disappeared.
? Good gracious ! ? exclaimed Peter. ? The top
is cut off as clean as a whistle.?
? Pull, men, pull! ? shouted Commander Paver-
sham. ? The game?s up. We must get out of the
line of fire.?
The oars struck the water as one, and, obedient
to the drag of the rudder, the boat circled round at
right angles to her previous course. A vivid flash
spurted from the collapsed steering house, followed
by a dart of smoke and the roar of a gun. They
heard the whistle of the shell as it passed over the
boat to burst within a few yards of the nearer
submarine.


?Itis a gun emplacement,? cried Jerry. ? That
shell sprung the screens and forced their hand.?
? It?s spoiled the skipper?s little plan, inci-
dentally,? remarked Peter grimly.
With a clatter which sounded strangely over the
waters, a deck cabin, part of the fo?c?sle, and a
wooden house on the top deck, all collapsed as
startlingly as had the steering house, and with their
fall there boomed out the thunder of the guns they
had concealed. On the bridge the boys caught a
fleeting glimpse of Mr. Lever.
? What happens now, I wonder ? ? murmured
Peter.
? A fight to a finish, I suppose,? replied Jerry,
and he glanced back to the submarines.
The farther one had closed her conning tower
and was submerging rapidly, at the same time steering
to get astern of the Chowkidar, where only one gun
could bear on her. The men on the nearer U boat
were tumbling in confusion into her conning tower,
with the exception of three who continued to work
the gun furiously. Shells flashed around her con-
stantly, and through their smoke wisps the answer-
ing flame of her gun blazed viciously. Suddenly
part of the conning tower flew to splinters, hit right
at the base. She was beginning to submerge at
the time, but immediately came full out of the
water again.
Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! went the guns re-
lentlessly. With a rending explosion another shell
found the doomed submarine?s hull. Almost at the


same instant still another struck the gun. There
was a muffled explosion within the U boat itself,
which threw up a column of water mixed with fumes.
The wrecked craft tilted her bows high into the air,
hung for a few seconds in that position, and then
slid swiftly away into the depths. Even as she dis-
appeared there came a tremendous report from the
direction of the Chozvkidar. Those in the boat
turned in time to see a column of water leaping
high above the mystery ship?s stern, and as it fell
they saw that the stern had been torn completely
away. A racing wave rushed upon the lifeboat and
threw it violently aside.
? The other sub,? croaked Peter as he grabbed
at the gunwale to steady himself in the tossing boat.
? She torpedoed her.?
? That after-gun?s crew,? whispered Jerry, white-
lipped. ? What of them ? ?
Silence had fallen over the sea ; silence which
seemed oppressive and strangely unnatural. The
sun smiled down on the dancing waves, and only
the lightest of warm breezes rippled the sluggish
swell. Now that the wave from the explosion had
passed, the lifeboats drifted easily, while all in them
watched the last moments of the Chowkidar. The
ugly colour-besplashed vessel was lifting her bow?s
very slowly, and lurching occasionally with a sug-
gestion of drunkenness. Around her floated a litter
of wooden fittings. The mate and the gun crews
were racing to where No. 4 boat hung from the
single fall, now only a few feet from the water.

Suddenly part of the conning tower flew to splinters,
hit right at the base.




POOR OLD LAME DUCK I
They lowered it rapidly, and the boat righted itself
in the waves, although half full of water. They
tumbled in, some falling to the oars, others bailing
frantically. As they crept away, the Chowkidar
seemed to start violently. Her bows dipped to
the sea again for a few seconds, then she reared
quite vertically and dropped like a stone down into
the sea.
Poor old Lame Duck ! ? whispered Jerry.


CHAPTER X
BOARDERS AWAY !
JERRY looked around the wide stretch of ocean,
feeling that the scene would always remain
impressed vividly on his memory. The sun was
now high, and the blue waters danced cheerfully in
its light. Where the Chowkidar had been, swirled
and bobbed an extraordinary number of loose pieces
of gear: crates, boxes, lifebelts, gratings, and a
mixture of smaller objects which tended to collect
into groups. Beyond the flotsam, Nos. 2 and 3
lifeboats were slowly coming round in order to
row back to the others. The remaining boats,
which included No. 4 with the guns? crews, drifted
idly on the swell as though doubtful what to do next.
In line with the boats, but far away on the horizon,
a smudge of smoke showed where the London-
America vessel was steaming away in full flight.
Every one in the captain?s boat was silent; they sat
gazing sadly at the spot where their ship had dived
to her end. An exclamation from one of the men
made Jerry turn his head. The seaman was standing
up and pointing to some wreckage where the sub-
marine had sunk.
? There is something in the water there, sir,?
114


BOARDERS AWAY I
he said loudly. ? I don?t mean the wood things ;
I mean something alive ! ?
? A survivor ? ? cried Peter excitedly. ? Yes ?
there he is. He?s clinging to the wood.?
The crew began to scramble to their feet in
order to see; but the commander?s harsh voice
brought them to order.
? Sit down there. What the devil is this !
A picnic ? Now, give way.?
? He hasn?t lost his voice ! ? chuckled Peter.
? It?s a knock-out, isn?t it ? ? agreed Jerry. ?He
roars like a wild bull, and yet he makes you feel that
you would follow him anywhere. I?m not sorry we
boarded his ship.?
?By Jove ! That chap is at his last gasp,?
exclaimed Peter.
While they talked they had been looking eagerly
towards the man in the water. A hand waved feebly
once or twice above a large piece of floating wreckage.
As the boat swept on under the desperate thrusts
of the oars, the boys could see an occasional com-
motion as though the German was making a despair-
ing struggle to keep above water. They were still
about forty feet from the man, when the hand was
again raised with the fingers stiffly extended, then
it fell abruptly backwards into the sea. It was this
which had called forth Peter?s remark. The boys
scrambled up on to the bow thwart.
? Keep down, there! ? roared the skipper.
? How many do you think we want to lug out of
the water ? ?


Jerry knelt on the thwart as a concession to the
order. He loosened his uniform jacket, and then
threw it off to allow freedom of movement. Then
he leant over the side.
? Here, this is more use.? The big hairy seaman
scrambled up beside the boy and thrust a boat-hook
out over the water.
As the boat shot alongside the wreckage which
floated in a smother of oil, the oars were rested and
all eyes searched the water. Apart from the broken
woodwork there was nothing in the sea. Jerry
drew a deep breath. Although the man was an
enemy, it was so tragic to have lost him when they
had been so near.
? Look! There ?e is. Showin? white-like
through the water.? It was Harris who had sighted
the body lifting again towards the surface.
Jerry caught a gleam of white and a dark shadow.
On the instant he leaped to his feet, flung hands
above his head, and dived swiftly and cleanly into
the waves. He half heard another splash as he
went under ; then the water was singing in his
ears as he cleft his way towards the drowning man.
His outstretched fingers touched something, and
clutched at a hard, slippery material which eluded
his grasp. Another desperate effort and he had a
grip. Now he was rising. Another form swept
alongside and took hold of the German too. They
broke surface with the limp body held between them,
a few yards from the boat. The skipper was bull-
roaring an order, and a boat-hook fastened in the
n6


BOARDERS AWAY I
tunic of the unconscious man was relieving them
of the weight.
Jerry released his hold and reached up to the
gunwale, now right over his head. Peter?s shock
head stood against the sky, and strong arms reached
to drag the swimmers into the boat.
?You always were mad,? remarked Peter cheer-
fully, as he lugged his chum unceremoniously over
the gunwale and dropped him into the boat. ? Still,
I?m glad you grabbed the blighter.?
Is he dead ? ? gulped Jerry anxiously.
? Dead ? No fear. Shaken up, of course, and
probably he has a few gallons of sea water inside;
but he is moving already, and does not look very
delicate.?
Jerry struggled to his feet in time to come face
to face with Harris as he was hoisted, dripping wet,
over the gunwale.
? You ? ? exclaimed Jerry in astonishment. ?Was
it you who dived in with me ? ?
?Me ? O? course it were me. Why shouldn?t
it be me ? Why, I been like a fish in the water
since I was so ?igh, I ?ave.?
? Never thought you had it in you, Cocky,?
remarked the hairy seaman.
?No ! Why not ? Jest because I don?t go
rushing abart to ?ave me lights blowed out wiv
shells, I s?pose I ain?t got no guts ? I ain?t afraid to
push your ugly face in any?ow, big as you are ! ?
? All right, Cocky, all right,? grinned the big
seaman soothingly. ?No one will say you ain?t


got courage after the way you dived in after that
Hun.?
? It wasn?t the ?Un what worried me neither,?
the little Cockney growled, but in a more mollified
voice. ?It were young Jerry what I went in for.?
They had passed the German into the stern
sheets and were working to restore him. He was
a broadly-built man wearing an officer?s uniform,
and was probably the commander of the sunken
submarine. He groaned and opened his eyes, and
immediately a flask was pressed to his lips. For a
moment he gulped at the spirits, then thrust away
the flask and turned to be violently sick. The rough
seamen supported him firmly but kindly, and as
soon as he was easier again they wrapped coats
around him and again applied the flask to his lips.
This time he drank greedily, and lay back with
closed eyes but with a touch of colour creeping
back to his cheeks.
? Herr Gott! ?he gasped huskily.
All in the boat were so concentrated on the
rescued man that they had forgotten their comrades
in the other boats, until a hail, ringing over the water,
recalled them. Looking up, they saw the five life-
boats pulling towards them in a group. Several men
were standing up, shouting and gesticulating. For
a few moments all in No. i boat stared uncompre-
hendingly, then Peter gave a cry of warning.
? Here she comes ! The other sub.?
They all saw it now, the slender periscope rising
rapidly with a spray of white water behind it as it
118


BOARDERS AWAY 1
moved into the stretch of water between the boats.
The second periscope rose, and with a swirl and a
rippling splash the conning tower came slanting
up and then the deck. The undersea boat floated
just awash and steered to circle around No. i boat.
A noisy chuckle from the skipper startled the
silent seamen. ? Don?t say it?s coming off! ? he
exclaimed, and then he checked himself with a
glance at the German officer lying at his feet.
With a clanking of metal the hatch of the sub-
marine?s conning tower opened, and a man?s head
and shoulders appeared. He inspected the boat
carefully before climbing right out. He wore an
officer?s uniform, and as he reached the bridge he
shouted a guttural order into the hatchway. Im-
mediately several men came scrambling briskly out,
armed with rifles. Another hatch opened in the
deck near the gun to allow others to emerge. They
covered the boat and stood awaiting further orders,
their faces telling only too plainly the satisfaction
they would have felt in revenging their comrades
of the sunken consort. The U boat had by this
time sailed completely between the lifeboats and
was coming near on the other side of No. i ; its
conning tower, with the huge white U 197 painted
on it, loomed high above the Britishers? heads. Its
commander cupped his hands and shouted to them
in good English and with a very slight German
accent.
? What was the name of your ship ? ? he
demanded.


? H.M.S. Chowkidar ,? replied Commander
Faversham promptly. He needed no hand-cupping
to make his voice heard !
? I know no vessel of that name,? retorted the
lieutenant. ? Neither do you wear naval uniform.
The use to which you have put your vessel?an
apparent merchantman ?is piracy, and I have every
right to treat you accordingly.?
?Is firing on an * apparent merchantman *
anything but piracy ? ? roared Faversham angrily.
? You squeal when you get some of your own
medicine, don?t you, you curs ! ?
The lieutenant frowned. ? You had better keep
a civil tongue. It is my intention to take you
prisoner as commander of that ship. I may find
it necessary yet to deal with the boats.?
He rapped out an order in German, and a small
group of men moved to the gun. In a minute the
deadly muzzle had slued round to threaten the
little group of lifeboats which had held aloof on the
appearance of the submarine.
? Great heavens ! They would not fire on the
boats, would they ? ? exclaimed Jerry in horror.
A deathly silence fell over the boat, and all
remained motionless watching the U 197 as she
slowed in speed till she drifted on the swell fairly
near to the boat.
? I am glad to see you are realizing your position,?
said the lieutenant at last. ? Now, Captain?
Himmel! ?
The commander of the sunken submarine had
120


BOARDERS AWAY!
suddenly poked his head above the gunwale. The
big officer had been lying back on some coats placed
for his relief by the seamen, and he had stayed in
position eagerly listening throughout the discussion
between his brother officer and Commander Faver-
sham. It was obvious that he was rapidly recovering
himself, and he had scowled at Faversham?s com-
ments on piracy, and grinned evilly when the lieu-
tenant had threatened to ? deal with the boats.?
At last he had heaved himself clumsily, flung aside
the coats, and staggered to his feet, his hand on the
shoulder of one of the sailors in order to steady
himself.
? Grosmann ! ? exclaimed the lieutenant, in a
tone compounded of amazement and delight.
? Lieber Gott im Himmel! I thought you dead.?
Unconsciously he made the remark in English.
? They pulled me out,? grunted the other, but
speaking in German. ? Come over and take me off.
You had better take the English captain too ; we
might get something useful from him. For the
boats ?it might be better to sink them.?
? The beast! ? ejaculated Jerry fiercely ; and
then, in reply to Peter?s inquiring glance, he swiftly
translated the remark.
The German must have caught something, for he
turned quickly and ran his eye suspiciously along
the boat until his gaze rested on the boys, where
it remained coldly for a few seconds until the
voice of the submarine commander recalled him.
? I will do as you say with regard to the English
(1,7*4) g 121


captain; but with regard to the boats, you are, of
course, joking.?
The reply having also been in German, Jerry
translated it swiftly to Peter.
? You had better be careful,? warned his chum
in a low voice. ? Did you see how he gazed at us ?
Look at the skipper; who would think he under-
stood ? ?
Indeed Commander Faversham was scowling
from the one to the other of the two officers as
though resenting discussion in an unknown tongue.
Grosmann shook himself irritably at the lieutenant?s
words, but apparently still felt too weak and shaken
to argue.
? Take me off. We will discuss the other after-
wards ?when you have remembered that I am your
superior officer !
? Oho ! ? murmured Jerry, and he bit his lip
uneasily as he regarded Grosmann calculatingly.
The submarine lieutenant made no reply to
Grosmann?s words, but gave a number of quick
orders. Obediently the U 197 began to slide gently
through the water till she had swept round to within
a few feet of the lifeboat?s stern. She had her deck
scarcely a foot above the water, a convenient height
for boarding from the lifeboat, and Jerry?s heart
began to bump a little. Slipping his hand into his
jacket pocket, he fingered the butt of the revolver
which the skipper had given him the night before.
? What about you, Pete ? ? he demanded sud-
denly. ?You have no gun.?


BOARDERS AWAY I
?You bet your life I have,? grinned Peter
eagerly. ? I grabbed one of those from the bulk-
head when I hopped out of bunk this morning.?
He fumbled in his pocket and half drew something
which gleamed in the sun.
? Back your boat into the U boat, Captain,?
snapped Grosmann sharply (his accent was harsh and
unmistakably foreign). ? And see you do exactly
as you are told in every way, or I may make you
regret.?
Faversham fixed his bulging eyes on the German
fiercely for a moment, but as though thinking of the
welfare of his men, he concluded by merely shrugging
his shoulders and curtly ordering the rowers to back
water. The stern of the boat bumped against the
rounded side of the submarine, and its commander
hastened to help Grosmann across the short strip
of water to the flat deck. Commander Faversham
moved aside as though to give more room for his
passenger?s transference, but in doing so he thrust
the tiller, and the rudder pressing against the sub-
marine swung the lifeboat slowly round to bring
it broadside on to the iron deck. Alert and ready,
his men saw the movement, and, carelessly enough,
they brought their oars close in on the one side, and
paddled gently on the other to accelerate the turning
motion. Grosmann and the lieutenant were en-
grossed with his getting out of the boat, and they
attributed any movement to the thrusting of his
feet as he leaped. The other Germans, too, though
keeping their rifles at the ready, were also interested


in the operation. Jerry and Peter held their breath
and tightened grip on the revolver butts. Safely
across, Grosmann shook off the aiding hand of the
seaman and moved towards the conning tower. The
submarine commander turned again to the lifeboat.
? Now, Captain ! ? he said commandingly.
All in the boat sat tense and ready. Fingers held
oars ready to thrust them clear for the leap to the
submarine?s deck, now only a few feet away from
even the bow of the boat. Jerry found his finger
on the trigger of his revolver without remembering
feeling for it. It was almost painful waiting for the
word of command.
But still it did not come, although at any moment
the Germans might realize how close alongside the
boat had drifted. Faversham?s eyes were following
Grosmann?s slow progress up the ladder to the
bridge, but he answered the lieutenant.
? What do you want now ? I have no ship?s
papers, if that is what you are asking for.?
?It is you we want, Captain.? There was a
faint smile round the lieutenant?s lips as he explained,
? We desire the pleasure of your company for the
rest of the voyage.?
? The devil you do ! ? roared Faversham so
fiercely that the German sailors tightened grip on
the rifles; but soon realizing that the big captain?s
roaring was a mannerism they relaxed again while
exchanging amused grins.
? Come, Captain, I have no time to argue,?
snapped the lieutenant.


BOARDERS AWAY I
Grosmann, who was now on his way into the
conning tower, paused at the sound of the raised
voices, and turned to have his say in the matter.
Even as he did so, however, Jerry, who had been
watching Faversham anxiously, saw a flash in his
leader?s eye and realized the reason for the delay;
Faversham had been waiting till the big German?s
body should obstruct the hatchway and prevent it
from being promptly closed.
? Board 'em ! ?
Clatter went the oars as the men leaped to their
feet to spring across to the submarine?s deck.
Some were too eager to draw their revolvers first,
a fact which carried the first rush successfully to
the U boat?s deck, and some of the Germans were
knocked down before they had time even to draw
trigger. Only the lieutenant realized the danger
at the first move, and even as Faversham?s huge
bulk soared towards him, he had spun round,
staggered, and began to run along the deck, scream-
ing an order as he went.
Bang !
Faversham?s pistol opened the firing. He missed
the lieutenant, and hit a man farther along the deck.
A ragged volley from the Germans answered, most
of the shots coming from the foredeck. As the
men there were obstructed somewhat by the inter-
vening conning tower, their first hasty shots were
fortunately not seriously effective. The men on the
afterdeck were at once at such close quarters with
the British seamen who had boarded that they were


unable to fire their rifles freely, but were forced into
a sharp hand-to-hand struggle, in which the more
handy revolvers of the attackers began rapidly to
tell.
Peter and Jerry found themselves obstructed
from boarding the U boat by a group of the seamen
who paused to return the fire of the Germans before
leaving the lifeboat.
? Aft, Jerry ! Aft! ? panted Peter, flourishing
his pistol excitedly towards the clear stem-sheets of
the boat and springing from thwart to thwart in
that direction. Suddenly the submarine?s gun roared
over their heads with a terrific blast of flame. Prob-
ably the gun?s crew had lost their heads, and had
fired their piece forgetting that it was trained only
on the distant boats. It had the effect, however, of
checking the attack of the men still in the lifeboat,
who were half stunned by the thunderous discharge.
The boys were in the act of leaping as the gun
exploded, and they fell sprawling on to the slippery
deck. They regained their feet in a confusion of
shouts, shots, and stamping feet. Glancing back,
Jerry was horrified to see the lifeboat some yards
away with a round dozen of men still in it. A
swirl of water showed that the U boat was moving.
Bang !
The shock of a shot fired directly towards him
recalled Jerry. He caught sight of Grosmann still
in the hatchway, and with a revolver in his hand.
At the same instant, Peter?s pistol barked and Gros-
mann seemed to fall into the conning tower. Some
126


BOARDERS AWAY I
one dashed past, almost sweeping Peter from his
feet. It was the German lieutenant, who had been
forced to make a stand with the few of his men
caught in the extreme of the afterdeck. Faversham,
bellowing furiously, was thundering in pursuit.
One of the British seamen leaped in the way of
the lieutenant, but a bullet from somewhere for?ard
caught him as he did so, and he crashed to the deck
in Faversham?s path.
The attackers had practically gained possession
of the afterdeck, but the men for?ard were now
streaming round the narrow decks beside the conn-
ing tower. The narrowness of this space was their
undoing, however, for they were exposed in a crowded
line to the fire of the men in the lifeboat as well as
to the attack of the men in front of them. With
unexpected suddenness they fell back. Jerry caught
a glimpse of an under officer waving them for?ard.
He was too excited to realize that the retreat was
not a defeat, but a manoeuvre to re-enter their boat
and submerge to sweep the Britishers into the sea.
? Rush 'em ! Rush 'em ! ? Faversham was shout-
ing.
He waved his men to the attack for?ard, while he
himself made straight for the conning tower. The
German lieutenant had gained the bridge, and as
Faversham and the two boys made towards the
ladder, he snapped his revolver at them. The
resulting click told that the weapon was empty.
Flinging it desperately at Faversham he turned and
plunged into the hatchway. As nimbly as a cat


the commander had run up the ladder, and had
reached the hatch before there was any possibility
of its being closed.
? Come on, Peter ! ? yelled Jerry.
Together they leaped for the narrow ladder
above them, and felt they could not negotiate its
narrow rungs quickly enough. There was an iron
rail to duck under at the top, and then the open
hatch was before them, with another ladder leading
down into the bowels of the submarine. Jerry had
a brief impression that the British seamen were
running about the foredeck, and that some were
scrambling up to try to reach the bridge from that
direction. A hasty half-thought crossed his mind
in wonder why they were not entering by the fore-
deck hatch. Then he caught sight of Faversham?s
broad shoulders below him, and heard the echoing
report of a revolver in the confined space beneath.
Everything else forgotten, he went scrambling down,
with Peter kicking his shoulders in his anxiety to
follow. The ladder swayed, and they had a sensation
as though the solid iron were dropping from their
feet. Somehow they slipped and crashed down upon
a writhing heap of men at the ladder foot. A dash
of cold water splashed down upon them. Some one
wrenched himself free with a frantic effort and half
fell, half scrambled across them. With a clang the
hatchway above closed ; the light became green, and
then darkened right out. They struggled to dis-
engage themselves and to find their feet. And
then the electric light flashed up.


BOARDERS AWAY!
There were five of them in a space meant
apparently for two, and obstructed moreover by
tubes and handles. The German lieutenant was
standing by the gear with which he had closed the
hatch. Commander Faversham leaned on a flat
projection on the side of the conning tower; his
revolver still clutched in his hands. The two boys
had scrambled to their feet, and now stood back
against a sloping chart table in such a position that
they were jammed between the lieutenant and the
British commander. Crouched against the side of
the conning tower, and striving to stanch a flow
of blood from his nose, was Harris, the Cockney
steward.
? She has submerged ! ? gasped Jerry.
?You fools! ? barked the lieutenant. ?To
think you could storm a submarine ! Another
second and you should have been drowned like rats
in a trap.?
? Lummy ! ? groaned Harris mournfully. ? I
don?t know as ?ow it wouldn?t ?ave been better.
What's goin? to ?appen now ? ?


CHAPTER XI
u 197
IGNORING Harris?s pointed question, the lieu-
tenant waved the two boys imperiously aside,
and as best they could they drew back to allow him
access to the eye-piece of the periscope, which was
beside them. The lieutenant seized the handles
and peered in. The mouthpiece of a speaking-tube
gaped conveniently before him, and after one glance
he opened his mouth to shout an order. On the
instant Faversham?s voice rang through the tiny
compartment:
? Stop I One word and you are a dead man.
You are not master yet, and must do as I tell you.?
The lieutenant turned his head with a look of
amazement on his face, to see Faversham?s revolver
directed at his ribs at a distance of no more than
eight inches.
? Your threat is a foolish one, Captain,? he said.
? You are entirely in our power.?
? We are trapped, I know,? agreed Faversham.
? But for the moment we are in a commanding
position here, and can make it very awkward for your
friends below.? He touched with his foot the iron
130


hatch which had been shut to cut off the conning
tower from the main part of the vessel.
The lieutenant shrugged his shoulders. ? They
conclude that the conning tower is full of water, and
will not open the hatch. On rising to the surface
again, they will merely emerge through the other
hatchway and will have you nicely caught, Captain.?
He turned contemptuously to the tube again.
? Nevertheless,? continued Faversham in a hard
voice, ? there is no need for you to commit suicide.
I shall shoot you, I assure you, if you do not do as
I say.?
? What is it, then ? ? demanded the lieutenant
shortly.
? Tell them that we will shoot any one who tries
to come up through that hatchway unless they agree
to treat us fairly as prisoners of war and to make no
attempt to shell the lifeboats.?
?It is for me ?and the Flotille-Kommandant
Grosmann ?to say as to that,? rapped the lieutenant.
? Exactly ! But at present you are a prisoner.
We want your word and this Grosmann?s?in English,
mind, from him.? The commander paused as
though struck by a thought, and he glanced round
towards Jerry. The boy understood immediately,
and appreciated the value of keeping from the
Germans the fact that their language was understood.
He made no definite sign, but pressed his lips mean-
ingly together, and saw a light of approval flash for
an instant in the commander?s eyes.
? Grosmann may not be alive,? the lieutenant


was saying. ? I saw him fall back into the boat as
if shot.?
? Try ! ? retorted Faversham laconically.
The lieutenant leaned over to the tube. ? Hallo,
there, Grosmann ! Are you there, Grosmann ? ?
They waited in suspense during the pause that
followed. Then the voice of the flotilla commander
came through the tube :
? Wer spricht ? Herr Gott ! Is that you, Lieb ? ?
? Speak English, Grosmann,? replied the lieu-
tenant ; then he added quickly, ? Do not open the
hatch yet. There are Englishmen here. They are
armed and mean mischief.?
? Englanders ! Was zum Teufel! I thought them
all drowned. And you too, for that matter, Lieb !
How many are there ? ?
Jerry started violently as his name came through
the voice pipe. His three companions turned to-
wards him in surprise also, and Harris ejaculated
an astonished ? Lummy ! ? There was no time
to wonder, however ; the lieutenant was speaking
again:
? There are four of them. We all fell in together,
and I closed the hatch as you were submerging.
I thought that bullet had got you, though, Grosmann,
you seem to be dodging death to-day ! ?
? Ach ! I was not hit. I jumped down to sub-
merge the boat to wash those lice into the sea, then
I intended to come up to pick up our own survivors.?
?You are a long time carrying out your intentions
then,? remarked the lieutenant dryly. ? But about
132


these Englishmen; they threaten to hold you all
boxed below unless you agree to their terms ! ?
? ? Terms! ? A harsh jeering laugh rattled through
the tube. ? Gott im Himmel I The impudence of
these Britishers ! ?
? They demand,? continued the lieutenant, with
a slight smile twitching the corners of his mouth,
? that they be treated as prisoners, and that we do
not shell their boats.?
The outburst of swearing in a mixture of German
and English that immediately poured from the
voice pipe indicated that the Flotille-Kommandant
Grosmann was displeased. Lieutenant Lieb stepped
back, laughing outright, and he turned towards
Commander Faversham. Before he could speak,
however, Grosmann?s abuse changed to a sharp
order, and with a clatter the hatch to the conning
tower began to open. Faversham spun round and
covered the gap with his revolver. Peter followed
his example, but Jerry kept a wary eye on the German
lieutenant. Harris endeavoured to squeeze himself
behind a sort of chart table which occupied the very
centre of the conning tower. Grosmann?s voice
sounded through the hatchway:
? Come down, Englanders ; we will of terms talk
below! ?
? Are you going to shell the boats ? ? persisted
Faversham grimly.
?To hell with your boats ! ? shouted Grosmann
furiously, and they heard the scrape of boots on
the ladder from the navigating compartment. Jerry


tightened his grip on the revolver he still held, and
he joined the others in covering the opening.
But Lieutenant Lieb had stepped forward and
laid his fingers on Commander Faversham?s arm.
The smile had vanished from his lips, and instead
his jaw was set and an angry light flickered in his
eyes.
? Captain ! You are a naval man ?apparently.
Have done with these insults. We are seamen, not
murderers ! ?
?It is war! ? returned Faversham equally
grimly. ?You Germans have done strange things
in war, have you not ? lam going now, however,
on what you yourself have threatened.?
Grosmann was barking out orders below, and
it was plain an attempt was to be made to storm
the conning tower. The lieutenant and Commander
Faversham stood looking one another steadily in
the eyes, and the boys silently awaited the outcome.
A hand seized the top rung of the ladder from below.
Jerry threw an anxious, questioning glance at his
leader.
? That was a bluff, Captain. You have my word
?as a German officer.?
Faversham lowered his revolver, glanced at it
regretfully, reversed it, and presented the butt to
Lieutenant Lieb.
? Lower your guns, lads,? he said; and Jerry
thought that this was the first time that the com-
mander had ever spoken quietly.
At the same moment a head and shoulders swung
i 34


through the hatchway. To his credit let it be said
that it was Grosmann himself who led the attack.
Like lightning Lieb flashed out a string of words.
Grosmann checked the finger already pressing the
t r igg er �f his pistol, and he glanced around the
group of men.
? Come down ! ? he ordered curtly at last, and
began to descend once more.
At a motion from Lieutenant Lieb the Britishers
followed the flotille-kommandant. Commander
Faversham led the way, followed by Jerry, Peter,
and finally Harris in that order. Lieutenant Lieb
brought up the rear of the melancholy procession.
Jerry stepped to the iron floor of the submarine
and looked curiously around. He stood in a
cylindrical compartment, the sides and ends of
which bore a complicated arrangement of angled
pipes, wheels, rods, and indicating dials. Near his
left a watch officer peered into the eyepieces of the
periscope, while beside him stood another man who
apparently operated the adjustment of the sub-
marine s eye as required. Below the conning tower
ladder a bearded seaman stood at what was obviously
the steering-wheel, for before him was a queer double
binnacle. The mouth of a voice pipe?evidently
the one from the conning tower ?gaped by this
man?s head. Other seamen stood at the wheels
set along the sides of the compartment, and so intent
were they on their business of watching registering
dials before them that they completely ignored the
entrance of the prisoners.


Lieutenant Lieb?s voice recalled Jerry from his
inspection of the compartment.
? Anything about, Fritz ? ?
The watch officer at the periscope shook his head
slowly. ? Nothing. Not even those lifeboats.?
? Blow the tanks,? ordered Lieb. ? Will you
take the bridge, Fritz ? ?
The men at the wheels sprang to life as the
watch officer barked a volley of orders. The sub-
marine tilted slightly, and the boys could feel it
lift as it mounted to the surface once more. There
seemed to be a different motion apparent, but
whether this was actually so or only imagination,
Jerry was unable to determine. The watch officer
ran nimbly past the group of prisoners and swarmed
up the ladder. There came the clang of the hatch-
way, and a breath of welcome sea air swept into the
cold, oily interior of the U boat. Lieutenant Lieb
had stood watching his men throughout the
manoeuvre, but now he turned towards his prisoners.
It was then that Jerry noticed Grosmann for the
first time ?in his curiosity as to the arrangements
of the U boat he had forgotten the presence of the
surly flotille-kommandant. Grosmann had with-
drawn to the extreme forward end of the compart-
ment, where he had leaned on the bulkhead to glower
at the Englishmen. Now he evidently considered
it time to reassert himself.
? Where are their arms, Lieb ? Have you been
dummkopf enough to let them keep them ? ?
Lieb raised his eyebrows very slightly, and drew
136


from his pockets the revolvers which he had collected
from the prisoners one by one before they left the
conning tower. Beckoning one of the petty officers,
he handed him the weapons with an order as to
their disposal. He had hardly done so when there
rose from the forward part of the vessel a shout of
startled alarm, which was answered by an angry roar
and then a babble of voices. To every one?s amaze-
ment a sentence in English came clearly through the
uproar:
? Hands off, you blighters ! Let go, will you ?
Can?t you see I?ve surrendered ? ?
One or two of the men in the navigating com-
partment moved as though to rush to discover the
meaning of the shout, but they were saved the
trouble by the opening of the door in the forward
bulkhead. Through the narrow opening stumbled
a knot of German sailors grasping and thrusting at a
tall bearded figure, who shook them and flung them
impatiently from him again and again. The cause
of their alarm was evident in the gleaming revolver
which the man still flourished. Harris gave a crow
at the sight of the big fellow; it was none other
than the hairy seaman with whom he had had the
argument in the boat.
? Lummy ! ? piped Harris. ? So ?e is in it, too.
Serve ?im right; ?e ain?t no better than lam now.?
The seaman had caught sight of Faversham, and
at once made towards him. Lieutenant Lieb shouted
an order sharply, and the German seamen fell back
reluctantly; they looked decidedly ruffled and
(8,711] IQ 137


knocked about, and two of them nursed minor
injuries to their faces. Through the door behind
them suddenly there bounced a torpedo petty
officer, from whose nose a stream of blood flowed
freely, while there were signs of discoloration around
the left eye. As the petty officer had a wealth of
flaming red hair which was decidedly ruffled, the
general effect was something to wonder at. Peter
gave a guffaw at the spectacle presented, while Harris
infused into his inevitable ? Lummy ! ? a wealth of
amazement, dismay, and amusement which made
the exclamation a marvel of eloquence.
? Report only one boarded through for?ard
hatch, sir,? said the hairy seaman smartly, as he
came to a stop before Faversham and saluted briskly.
? He resisted capture, Herr,? the petty officer
was shouting to Lieb in German. ?We found him
in the torpedo compartment about to smoke. To
smoke , Herr! I knocked out the match, and he hit
out like a fiend. He knocked all my men about
when they seized him, Herr.?
? So it seems, Gunstein,? said Lieb with a
twinkle in his eye, as he glanced over the ruffled crew.
He was interrupted by an angry exclamation from
Grosmann.
? Take his gun away from him, Lieb. Why do
you tolerate this insubordination ? ?
Lieb turned to Commander Faversham. ?He
must give up that revolver immediately.?
? Surrender your gun, Jones,? growled Faver-
sham, and motioned to the petty officer who had
138


taken the weapons of the others, and who now
stood undecidedly at the elbow of this formidable
British sailor.
Jones cocked an eye down at the petty officer
for a moment, then presented his revolver muzzle
first in a manner which the German evidently found
both awkward and unnerving.
? How did this dog come to be in the torpedo
compartment so long without discovery ? ? Gros-
mann was demanding of the red-haired Gunstein,
although, while he asked the question, he kept his
eye angrily on the new arrival.
? We were on duty in the fore torpedo chamber,
Herr, till we received the recall just now. He must
have entered before the hatch was closed, and
finding himself alone did not penetrate farther.
We found him as we were returning here, and he
was about to smoke , Herr ! ?
? You must warn your men not to smoke down
below, Captain,? said Lieb. ? There are always
fumes from the acids, and we might be blown up.?
? You?ll ?ave to chew, Cully,? chirped Harris
cheerfully, ?an? go on deck when you wants to
spit.?
? Hold your tongue, you rat I ? barked Grosmann
furiously. ? Have you forgot that it is a German
boat you are aboard ? ?
? I suggest,? intervened Lieb curtly, ? that the
prisoners be examined in the mess cabin.? There
was something in his tone which did not escape
Jerry?s quick ears ; evidently the lieutenant resented


his superior?s overbearing tone. Grosmann?s face
had taken on a deeper red, and his pale eyes snapped
dangerously. For a moment he transferred his
glare from the prisoners to his fellow officer; then,
with an obvious effort, he controlled himself and
replied harshly, ? Very well, then. Show them
through.? The words had the ring of an order rather
than the agreement with a suggestion.
Motioning the Britishers to follow him, Lieb
moved towards the door in the for?ard bulkhead.
Passing through the narrow opening they found
themselves in a tiny alleyway between two cabins.
That on the port side had a bunk, a desk, and a
folding table. Probably it was the captain?s own
cabin. Lieb, however, was ushering them into the
opposite cabin on the starboard side. This had
several bunks, and in addition a narrow table with
folding seats on each side running between them.
Leaving them for a moment, Lieb hurried into his
own cabin, to return carrying a leather-bound book,
a small writing pad, and a fountain pen. He
squeezed into the space on one side of the table and
laid his book upon it.
? Sit down, Captain,? he commanded curtly,
and waved to the opposite side of the table. For
a moment his eye hesitated on Jerry and Peter, and
he glanced at the buttons on their sleeves distinctive
of the merchant service cadet. Apparently, however,
he decided that this dress was merely for effect while
serving on the mystery ship. ? You midshipmen,
too,? he added, ? sit down there.?


Commander Faversham squeezed his huge bulk
carefully into the narrow space until he had reached
a position opposite to the lieutenant. Jerry fol-
lowed, and after him Peter. Jones and Harris stood
at the end of the table, regarding the arrangements
doubtfully. For some reason of his own, Grosmann
had remained behind in the navigating compartment
for a few minutes, but just as Lieb opened his log-
book and fluttered its pages to the last entry, the
flotille-kommandant entered the messroom, which
now had the appearance of being uncomfortably
crowded. He elbowed Harris quite unnecessarily,
and then thrust himself into the seat on the same
side as Lieb, but at the end nearest the door, where
he spread his legs and regarded the prisoners one
by one in a distinctly hostile manner. There was
little sign of the ordeal he had endured, and appar-
ently he had hastened to remove his wet clothing
as soon as the submarine had submerged?at any
rate he now wore a uniform much too tight for him,
and probably the property of the watch officer.
? Now, Captain,? began Lieutenant Lieb, ? your
name and rank ? ?
? Michael Faversham, Commander, R.N.?
Faversham made no attempt to subdue his voice,
and it rumbled through the tiny compartment like a
thunder growl.
? Faversham ! ? both the Germans exclaimed
at the same moment. Lieb, who had held his pen
ready to write, spun round to regard his colleague
with excitement. Grosmann for his part brought


both his fists down on the table as he leaned over
to peer into the Englishman?s face. Suddenly he
thumped the table triumphantly.
? Michael Faversham ! ? Bull ? Faversham 1
Lieber Gott im Himmel ! It is, Lieb ; it is he ! ?
The two boys sat amazed by this outburst; but
apparently Commander Faversham was in no way
surprised. He gave a twisted smile, and then
boomed :
? ? Bull * Faversham; yes, they call me that in
the service sometimes. Evidently I have bellowed
to some purpose.?
Grosmann snarled, but was at a loss what to
retort. Lieb smiled wryly.
? Four of our best boats,? he remarked dryly,
? and boats commanded by some of our best men !
Yes, it were strange if we did not know you, sir.
But you will trap no more of us.?
? Don?t be too sure of that,? retorted Faversham
gruffly. ?In any case your information is not
up-to-date ; it is five of your U boats I have bagged
?no, six; I must apologize for not including the
command of our friend here, Herr Grosmann.
The other was one of your latest super-cruisers,
which made the mistake of trying to stop my progress
to these waters.?
? Rubbish ! ? snapped Grosmann angrily. ? No
commander nowadays would be so easily caught.?
Faversham regarded him coldly for a few mo-
ments, then smiled sourly. ?You do not speak
highly of yourself, Herr,? he commented dryly.
142


? She was the U 211,? he added, turning to Lieb,
? Kapitan-Lieutenant Wolker.?
Lieb had commenced to write, and so his eyes
were on his paper, but Jerry remarked a slight paling
of his cheeks at Faversham?s words. He sat silently
thinking for a while, then he said quietly :
? You are a remarkable man, Commander ; and
one well informed, it would seem. The poor U 211.
Yes, Wolker was a messmate of mine on the
Pommern.?
The succeeding pause of silence was terminated
in an unexpected manner. Harris, the little steward,
leaped to the other side of the table, where he could
get a clear view of Faversham. The light of excite-
ment was in his eyes, and his voice was shrill with
admiration.
? Lummy ! O? course ! I knew all along as ?ow
I knew yer, sir; all the while ol* Tommy was
arguing abart yer. All those bits in the papers?
only a man forgits ?alf of what ?e reads?why, it
was you they said was sinking all the German subs,
wiv yer tricky little Q boats. No wonder you ?ad
a pop at this bloke, sir. Why ?
? Silence ! ?
Grosmann?s furious shout and the crash of his
fist on the table brought Harris?s babbling eulogy
to an abrupt stop. He looked in bewildered surprise
at the scarlet cheeks and snapping eyes of the sub-
marine officer beside him.
?Be silent, Englisher I Or out of this ship
shall I fling you 1 ?


? Lummy ! ? ejaculated Harris.
Jerry glanced from the furious flotille-komman-
dant at the one end of the table, to the lieutenant
calmly continuing with the entries in his log at the
other. Catching Peter?s eye he saw therein the
reflection of his own thoughts : that with two such
different types in the mastery, anything might happen.
Lieutenant Lieb glanced up at the English com-
mander.
The name of your command, sir ? ?
H.M.S. Chowkidar
Chow ? ?
? C-H-O-W-K-I-D-A-R.?
?So ! But you have an official name. Q ??
What ? ?
? That,? replied Faversham calmly, ? I am not
able to divulge.?
Flotille-Kommandant Grosmann diverted his
still lively anger in a new direction.
? Listen, Herr Commander ! ?he rasped. ? The
position is as we shall say. You will do quickly
what the Herr Lieutenant asks.?
Faversham leaned back as far as the bunkboards
behind would let him, then he thrust his head for-
ward, and the familiar glare came into his bulging
eyes. Jerry, though tingling with excitement, could
scarcely forbear laughing as the characteristic bristle
recalled his own first meeting with ? Bull ? Faver-
sham in the wireless cabin of the Chowkidar. He
could feel Peter wriggling, and guessed some simi-
lar thoughts were passing through his chum?s shock
144


head Then the commander?s bull-roar shook the
cabin.
?You I Who the devil are you to come butting
into this ? The man isn?t bom who will make me
say what Ido not choose. To the devil with you,
sir ! While you are here, I refuse to have anything
to do with this interrogation.?
Flotille-Kommandant Grosmann was now on his
feet, shaking with passion. He leaned heavily on
the table, and could hardly force out his words ;
when they did come they were harsh and smothered.
?You will speak when we say. We will make
you I ?
Faversham struggled to his feet in the confined
space, managed to step on to the seat, and then
vaulted lightly over the table, to land on the deck
between Grosmann and Harris. Such agility did
he display for one of his bulk that he was standing
looking down into Grosmann?s eyes before one of
them could move.
? When Greek meets Greek ! ? gurgled Peter into
Jerry?s ear.
? And how,? demanded Faversham distinctly,
? do you propose to make me ? ?
Jones, the big seaman, pushed Harris suddenly
aside, stepped quickly to Faversham?s elbow and
saluted. ? Any orders, sir ?? he asked meaningly.
? Get back ! ? snapped Faversham with a curt
jerk of his head.
? We?ll be capturing this sub yet I ? giggled the
irrepressible Peter.


Grosmann had wriggled round with the obvious
intention of rising to face Faversham, but seemed
to find some difficulty with the bulky commander
looming above him.
? Make you ? ? he snarled. ? I have a ship?s
crew who wall show you how. I hold you ?like
that! ? He shook his clenched fist in the air.
? You ? I take no orders from such sweepings
as you, however you have managed to wriggle into
an officer?s uniform ! There is the commander of
this craft.? (Faversham stabbed a finger in Lieb?s
direction.) ? He, at least, is some credit to the
German navy.?
From the severe tone of the English commander
one would have thought that he was instead a high
official of the German Admiralty. At this point
Lieutenant Lieb seized the opportunity to inter-
vene.
? It is my order, then, Commander Faversham,
that you go immediately on deck,? he said.
Grosmann swung round on his junior. ? What ?
Are you allowing him to defy us thus ? ?
Faversham drew up his shoulders and turned
towards the door. ?I am going on deck,? he said
distinctly, and the words were a challenge.
To what lengths Grosmann would have gone in
his rage there is no knowing. As Faversham van-
ished through the doorway the flotille-kommandant
dragged himself clear of the table and stepped for-
ward to follow. Then he stopped abruptly, swayed,
flung out a hand to steady himself, and fell heavily
146


back into his seat. Lieb slid swiftly along to his
aid, concern on his good-natured face.
? Lieber Freund ! You are suffering from shock.
Your system is too shaken for this excitement.
Away to my bunk and rest.?
Lieb pressed a bell-push and shouted an order
almost at the same time. A sailor appeared in an
extraordinarily short space of time carrying a glass
and a bottle of brandy. Lieb poured out some
of the spirit and held it to Grosmann?s lips. The
flotille-kommandant jerked the glass from his com-
rade?s hand and gulped at the liquid greedily ; a
slight flush tinged his cheekbones, and he set down
the glass on the table with an unsteady clatter.
? Sei dank! ? he muttered; then sharply,
? Continue with der hearing.?
? But ?
Grosmann waved an imperious hand. ? Con-
tinue, I say. There is little enough done so far.?
Lieb hesitated with his eyes fixed on his superior?s
face, then with a shrug of the shoulders he turned
briskly to Jerry, evidently intent on concluding the
interrogation with dispatch.
? Name ? ?
? Gerald Lieb.?
? Lieb ? ? The lieutenant?s eyebrows flicked
upwards. ? That is my own name ! You are?
English ? ?
? New Zealander.?
? But your name,? persisted the lieutenant;
? it is German.?


? I am of German family,? replied Jerry doggedly.
He was painfully aware of the gaze of his three
companions, and he little relished this questioning.
?My people came from Frankfort. But I ?
? Frankfort ? And went to New Zealand ? Was
your grandfather?s name by any chance Gerald also
?Gerald Gustav Lieb ? ? The lieutenant was lean-
ing forward eagerly.
? Yes, that is right.? It was Jerry?s turn to be
surprised now. ?He was a shoemaker ; we have
an old photo of his shop?in Rungstrasse.?
Lieutenant Lieb threw down his pen and leaned
back to laugh strangely.
? Welcome, cousin ! My grandfather and yours
were brothers ! ?
Before Jerry could think of making any reply
to this extraordinary announcement, they heard the
door to the navigating compartment thrown hastily
open, and a sailor appeared at the cabin door.
? The new flotilla, Herr Lieutenant,? he said
as he saluted stiffly. ?Itis in sight.?
Grosmann sprang to his feet with renewed vigour
and a grunt of joy. ? Come, Englanders !? he cried.
? And you, you renegade descendant of good
Germans ?come ! We will show you that which is
going to bring your proud England to her knees.
Come ! ?


CHAPTER XII
? MAD ? FAVERSHAM?S IDEAS
THE air of excitement was to be seen as much in
Lieb as in Grosmann as the lieutenant threw
down his pen and slid to the outer end of the table.
The two boys rose more slowly, and all the Britishers
followed their captors out into the main compartment
of the submarine. Here there was a stir of life :
the seamen were smiling and exchanging laughing
remarks. From the deck above came the restless
tramp of sea-boots and loud cheerful voices. Jerry
glanced hastily round for Faversham, but evidently
the commander had been permitted to carry out his
intention of going on deck.
? What are we agoin? to do now, young Jerry ? ?
asked the hoarse voice of Harris in the boy?s ear.
? I?m going to follow the skipper up above to see
what is doing,? replied Jerry briskly.
? Do you think they will let us ? ? inquired Peter.
? Well, Grosmann seemed to invite us.? Jerry
walked past the steersman to the foot of the iron
ladder. An officer at the after end of the compart-
ment kept his eyes on them as they began to climb,
but he made no attempt to interfere with them, and


with growing confidence they reached the conning
tower and soon scaled the short ladder which led
to the open air. The narrow space of the navigating
bridge was rather crowded, for besides the two
officers, who were gazing towards the west through
binoculars, there was a petty officer and two seamen.
Jerry glanced quickly round and saw Commander
Faversham standing alone on the little semicircular
deck on the starboard side. With a sign to Peter,
Jerry slipped under the bridge rail and down the
few rungs of ladder to the deck. In a few minutes
the boys and Harris (Jones, for some reason of his
own, had remained in the submarine) had joined their
skipper in staring eagerly out over the spread of
water in search of the object of interest.
Commander Faversham glanced round to see
who had joined him, and then he pointed away to a
few points abaft the beam. Immediately Peter gave
a little gasp and then a whistle, and Jerry, gazing
eagerly in the direction indicated, saw four black
shapes on the dancing sunlit waters. The voice of
Harris broke in:
? Four on ?em I My stars ! I reckon they?re
big ?uns too. Look at the length of ?em?they?re
more like big destroyers than submarines. Fings
are lookin? a bit orf darn these parts ! ?
? Four ? Six ! ? burst out Peter bitterly. ? See,
right over to the north there ; and you can just make
out another away to the south-west. They are
scouting on the wings, I suppose. May be more of
them, too, that we can?t see.?


" MAD ? FAVERSHAM?S IDEAS
? Lummy ! ? Harris fell silent for a moment.
? Blowed if I ain?t glad to be captured and done
with it,? he added thoughtfully.
Jerry shaded his eyes from the sun?s glare, and
sought the scouting submarine where Peter had
pointed. He made out the one to the northward
by its towering conning tower, and after a little
searching caught glimpses of the other. Six ! Yes,
there was at least that number. This was no case
of stray cruisers making a long-distance raid.
There was something behind Grosmann?s threat:
the Germans had somehow found means to main-
tain a flotilla in the South Atlantic, and the heavy
sinkings in recent convoys were but a preliminary
to a campaign of devastation. Probably their new
method of attack had been tried out with a few
vessels, and now every available unit was to be flung
into the effort. Jerry felt a chill closing round his
heart as he watched those ominous black shapes
sliding silently through the blue sea. He knew
quite well how near the submarine blockade had
come to cutting off food and war supplies from
Europe. The tonnage sunk had climbed into the
millions, and the food in England threatened to give
out. The convoy system had saved the situation;
and now this new and terrible menace had arisen.
If the Germans had discovered a chink in the
convoy armour?and it was evident that they had?
what was to save the Allies ? They had the ships to
deal the blows, and the means to maintain them
evidently where it was the most difficult to guard


the foodstuffs. Something had gone wrong. Eng-
land was already putting her utmost effort into the
war. Victory depended on her maintaining the
effort unfailingly. Jerry drew a long slow breath
as he pictured those hundreds of miles of trenches
with their millions of fighting men waiting for food
and ammunition which the ships alone could bring ;
as he pictured the monster cities with their belching
munition factories, the people in them already half
starved and waiting for the food to carry on ; more
food, and more, which only the ships could bring ;
his mind flew to the German fleet waiting an op-
portunity to swoop down upon the vital Channel
transports which maintained the army in France ;
the British navy must watch for it, and could spare
no more ships to patrol the endless wide spaces of
ocean over which the convoys sailed. The critical
hour had come ; the fate of the Allies trembled in
the balance.
A bright red flare bursting into flames on the
bridge above recalled Jerry to what was happening
around him. The flare died down, to be followed
immediately by a green one. As it blazed up an
answering glow burned red on the leading ship of
the approaching flotilla. Then a line of little flags
ran up above its conning tower to flutter lazily in
the light breeze.
? Inside with you, Englanders. Get to your
kennels.?
Harris was the only one to move. Ever since
sighting the submarines he had stood with hands
152


? MAD ? FAVERSHAM?S IDEAS
in pockets and shoulders hunched up, the picture
of utter dejection. At the sound of Grosmann?s
voice he turned slowly to go to the ladder. Jerry
glanced up at the flotille-kommandant but stayed
where he was ; Peter, with eyes glued to the ap-
proaching submarines, apparently had not heard ;
while Commander Faversham stood as silent and
immovable as he had been since they first joined him.
?You hear, Englanders ! ? shouted Grosmann
furiously. ? Below with you. At once ! ?
Lieb?s voice rapped out an order, and the watch
officer and a seaman dropped to the deck. Jerry
felt his arm taken, and he was turned forcibly round
to find the watch officer pointing to the ladder.
Peter was already moving that way under escort of
the seaman. The watch officer turned and touched
Faversham on the sleeve. The commander glanced
round, shrugged his shoulders, and then turned
silently to follow the others. For once the bull was
quiet!
The submarine was dark and stuffy after the
warm outdoors, as the prisoners climbed down into
the main compartment again. The ugly iron pipes
and wheels were grim and forbidding to Jerry as
he looked at them in the gleam of the electric globes.
He realized that he was intensely weary, and also
hungry; and then, through the all-pervading reek
of oil, came a whiff of cooking food. On the instant
Jerry was not merely hungry, he was starving.
? Lummy ! Do yer smell it ? Love us, can?t
yer go a good lump o? fried beef ? Wiv taters, eh ?


Fried in plenty o? fat. Lummy ! Do yer reckon
we?re going to eat ? ?
Jerry smiled at the way Harris had perked up
at the smell of the food, and a German sailor near
by, who had evidently caught the meaning in the
Englishman?s tones, turned his head and laughed.
? Geh nur der Nase nach! ?* he said, and waved
his hand invitingly towards the afterpart of the ship.
The engineer officer came forward and addressed
Faversham.
?You and the two young men will food have
in the officer?s cabin, Herr,? he said. ? The two
seamen will with the men?s table be.?
? Thank you,? rumbled Faversham quite amiably,
and with a nod of acknowledgment he turned for?ard,
the two boys following him closely.
They found the table at which the interrogation
had been held now laid for a meal, and they took
the seats indicated by a wordless steward who was
making the last arrangements.
? How are we to tell him what we want ? ? asked
Peter suddenly.
? I expect we shall have what we are given,?
laughed Jerry with a glance at Faversham.
The commander was seated facing them, and he
was now leaning back gazing moodily at the table.
He made no comment until after the steward had
returned and laid before each of the three a plate
of fried ham and eggs.
? Well, they don?t lack decent food,? mumbled
* Follow your nose I


" MAD " FAVERSHAM'S IDEAS
Peter as he fell to work on the ample helping given
him. ? This looks as though they have a base not
very far away.?
? They may take fresh supplies from ships they
have held up,? remarked Jerry. ? You remember
they were busy with that London-America boat
when we barged into them.?
The German steward suddenly re-entered with
three huge mugs of coffee, which he bumped down,
and then he disappeared again. The slowing of the
engines and vague sounds outside suggested that
they were nearing the other U boats. For the first
time Commander Faversham looked up from his
breakfast and spoke.
? I have been considering our next move,? he
said, in what was for him a low voice. ? Will you
look out of the door, Lieb, to see there is no one
listening ? ?
With a glance of surprise Jerry obeyed. The
alleyway outside was empty, and he returned to his
seat with an eager face turned towards the com-
mander. Peter was still munching mechanically,
but the stare he was bestowing on Faversham plainly
asked what madness was this to talk of ? moves,?
while they were securely held prisoners in this iron
shell.
? All 0.K., sir,? said Jerry.
? Y�u have been noting the lay of this craft, of
course ? ? demanded Faversham.
Well?more or less, I suppose,? was Jerry?s
confused reply.


? Then you should be doing it properly,?
snapped Faversham. ? Don?t you realize that we
are at war ? That we are prisoners ? ?
? We know that part all right,? murmured Peter
under his breath.
Faversham fixed him with a glare for a few
moments, and then went on with the explanation of
his ideas. ? You had better keep your eyes open
and notice every detail of this boat: the knowledge
may yet be of immense value. It is obvious that
the Huns have established an efficient base in these
waters. Probably it will soon be discovered, but in
the meanwhile they may do sufficient damage even
to tip the balance of the war. We must stop that;
and if we are joining that flotilla for mass attacks
?a very likely tactical move ?we should have an
opportunity to do something.?
? But ?but ...? Jerry was dazed by these
audacious ideas ; while Peter was reduced to gazing
at Faversham with obvious doubts as to his sanity.
The commander silenced Jerry with a wave of
his hand, and continued. ? Right opposite is the
captain?s cabin, and just for?ard is a closed sliding
door ; take a good look at it when you go out again,
it is the wireless cabin. My idea is this : we shall
behave as though resigned to existence until the
favourable moment arrives. Should it appear that
we are to be taken and left at their base as prisoners
ashore, or should this boat approach a convoy for
the purpose of attack, we shall rush the wireless
cabin. You, Lieb, will then send out a warning to
156


" MAD ? FAVERSHAM?S IDEAS
the threatened ships, giving them also any useful
information we may have picked up in the meanwhile.
I do not despair of finding a clue as to how they
manage to search out and approach the convoys at
night. While you are at work, Harvey and I, and
Jones, if we are fortunate, will hold them off as long
as possible.?
? But ?we shall all be shot, sir,? said Peter,
although his shining eyes belied the doubt in his
words.
?Of course ! ? barked Faversham. ?Do you
expect to carry on a war without casualties ? ?
The steward?s entrance put a stop to the dis-
cussion. As Jerry sat quietly watching the removal
of the greasy plates, and the deft way the steward
made the most of the tiny space for the placing of
toast, jam, and marmalade, his heart was beating
rapidly. He remembered Harry Appleby?s words :
? Commander Faversham is always getting some
mad idea, but somehow it always succeeds ! ? This
idea was outrageously daring, but on that very
account it stood a good chance of success. The
attempt to capture the submarine had failed, truly;
but it had come very near to success, and there were
fewer doubtful factors in the present project.
Peter?s enthusiastic voice interrupted Jerry?s thoughts.
? It?s a bosker idea !? he chuckled. ? You have
been an operator on a British warship, Jerry; and now
you are going to desert to the Huns?you dirty dog! ?
The thump of Commander Faversham?s knife
as he banged it suddenly down on the table brought


Peter round with a start. He wondered what he
had said out of place now. Faversham was staring
at him with his goggle eyes fixed in a glassy expres-
sion, and Peter decided that he had put his foot into
trouble to a considerable extent. Jerry, however,
had recognized the fact that the commander was
evolving one of his ? great ideas.? He, too, felt
apprehensive; but for a different reason from
Peter?s. He had seen that same expression on the
Chowkidar's bridge when the chief officer?s remark
had in the same way suggested the attack on the
submarine.
? Eh ? Do you think you can do it ? ? demanded
the commander, turning towards Jerry. ?You speak
the language like a native. Always been taught by
your father to love the old Fatherland, eh ? Feel
now you were wrong in sticking to the British ships,
but were so pleased that you had to, eh ? Now
wish to desert ?currying favour with the officers,
too, eh ? Your cousin?that?s the line to take ?
blood thicker than water, eh ? Will you do it ? ?
? I?l . . .? stammered Jerry, as his brain
grappled with the suggestion. ? They won?t believe
me. They would despise me if they did.?
? They might believe it,? insisted Faversham.
? Good thing if they do despise you ; they will be
less careful of what they say before you. You might
find the very secret we are groping after.?
? It seems playing a low-down game,? began
Jerry; but the commander interrupted him with a
violent explosion.


" MAD '* FAVERSHAM?S IDEAS
? Is anything low-down that stops this murderous
undersea killing ? Is there anything harmful only
to ourselves ?and it is yourself you are thinking of
after all ?that we should not do to help England
to victory ? Do you tell me , ? Bull ? Faversham, what
is a straight fight ? It will mean death to us all
anyway, and what more than our lives can we give ?
Pah ! Is this your German blood coming out ?
Be British, boy ! Be British ! ?
? That?s just it,? returned Jerry quietly. His
face was flushed, but he looked the commander
steadily in the eyes. ?I am British ; all through.
I never talked about it except to my nearest chum
because I loved my foster-parents. But my name
is not Lieb. I was one of the few survivors of the
Ondaro when she went ashore off Nelson ; a kiddie
of four, both my parents were drowned, and I
never knew who I was. My ? father and mother,?
as I call those who brought me up, took me and
lavished all their love on me. They had no child
of their own, and I could have found no better
parents. Not by any word or deed would I injure
them ; they are of German descent, yes, and for
their sakes I say there are as good Germans in the
world as British. That is why I hesitate to act as
you suggest.?
? I see,? rumbled the commander. ? I see.
The Ondaro. British India Line, outward bound
from London, wasn?t she ? Then you are British?
English probably. That settles it, lad. I respect
your thought for your adopters ; but ? ?Faversham


leaned over the table and spoke slowly and distinctly
?? those people are British, too, now. The Old
Country is fighting with her back to the wall. Look
around you. Here is the mailed fist that threatens
to beat her down. Is the peace of the world, is
the peace of that very home you talk of, to be
shattered for a mad emperor?s ambition ?just for
an individual ideal ? You are British, by birth and
country. New Zealand has thrown her all into the
fight. Now, Lieb ?
Faversham stopped abruptly as voices and heavy
boots sounded in the alleyway. He rose abruptly
and slipped out from the table.
?It is necessary?for England, boy,? he said
in a low voice. ? Will you do it ? ?
Jerry, white-faced but tight-lipped, had risen too.
? I?ll do it, sir,? he said.
Into the doorway came Lieutenant Lieb and
Grosmann, the latter talking and laughing boister-
ously.
? Have we your permission to go on deck now ? ?
demanded Faversham in his old familiar aggressive
manner.
? Yes,? nodded Lieb.
?Go and the devil go with you!? cried
Grosmann offensively, and his voice rang with
triumph. ? Go ?and consider how long it will be
before England is squealing for peace.?


CHAPTER XIII
JONES STUDIES GERMAN
FAVERSHAM was out of the cabin before Gros-
mann had finished speaking, and the two boys
lost no time in following their leader to the
deck. They found him entering into conversation
with the watch officer, whose general attitude was
neutral and cautious.
? Let?s get down to the deck and stretch our
legs,? said Jerry, and he led the way to the narrow
deck below. A few seamen were lounging about
smoking on the afterdeck, so Jerry slipped round
the conning tower with the intention of going for?ard
as far as possible. The U 197 was the last vessel
of a fine-ahead column of five. Out on the wings,
at a distance of about two miles, they had glimpsed
the other two submarines as they climbed down
from the bridge.
With a significant cluck of the tongue, Peter
pointed to the sun. ?We are going east? he
said. ? Does that mean we are on the track of a
convoy ? ?
Jerry did not reply. He was considering Com-
mander Faversham?s schemes again, and if another


convoy attack was near, they would have little time
to perfect their plans. Jerry was no coward, but
he felt a chill at his heart as he reviewed the difficulties
in their way, and how much was at stake. The
projected attack on the wireless cabin would mean
death or serious injury without doubt, but it w T ould
be worth the sacrifice if it succeeded. But as for
that other suggestion of Faversham?s ?Jerry hated
the very idea ?yet he was bound to carry it through.
On the foredeck several of the German seamen
were engaged in hanging on lines clothes which
they had newly w T ashed ; and as the boys made their
way past them the Germans eyed them with varying
glances according to their dispositions ; some greet-
ing them with a remark of some sort, friendly or
otherwise, some making no sign of their thoughts,
while a few spat disgustedly into the sea as the lads
went by them. Jerry was making for the fore
wireless mast, which, being placed at the extreme
end of the deck, offered a resting-place at its foot
where they could remain undisturbed. The sub-
marine was much higher out of the water than she
had been when they boarded her, and she was
slipping through the sea at a fairly fast rate.
? Can?t see much chance of stretching our legs
with these chaps hanging up their wash,? remarked
Jerry. ?We had better squat by the mast and have
a chat.?
? About all we can do,? growled Peter, with a
glance round their restricted quarters. ? By Jove 1
she can slip along, can?t she ? ?


Jerry considered the water bubbling past. ? About
fourteen knots. Not so bad,? he replied.
Peter leaned back against the mast and regarded
the submarines in line ahead of them. They were
big vessels, much larger than the U 197, and Peter
considered their possibilities in the way of speed,
cruising range, and offensive power, with anything
but an easy mind.
? It is going to be rotten for you from all points
of view, this playing the traitor,? he said suddenly.
?Be careful! ? Jerry glanced round apprehen-
sively. A few feet from them two of the German
seamen were pegging their clothes to the line.
? Oh, they won?t understand anything but their
own lingo,? replied Peter disdainfully. ? What
part am Ito play in this ? That is what I want to
know. The skipper surely will not expect me to
pretend to turn on you, will he ? ?
? That is just what you will have to do : and do
it properly,? returned Jerry grimly. ? But now
shut up ! You are taking risks.?
? I don?t see,? began Peter, and then he paused
abruptly. The two Germans had commenced a
conversation of their own, and by the eager flash
in his chum?s eyes, Peter realized that Jerry was
hearing something of interest.
? Have they fixed some of the ? fool ? ships over
the other side that we are going this way ? ? asked
the elder of the men.
The other, a much younger seaman, glanced at
the boys before replying. ? I don?t know. Schmidt


is very close with his information. Still, it will be
better to say very little about these things. The
Englanders may understand our words.?
Jerry could scarcely repress a smile at this echo
of his own caution.
? Ach ! These Englanders are too vain to trouble
with any language but their own,? retorted the other.
Before he could proceed to say more his atten-
tion was attracted by a shrill argumentative voice
coming from the open hatch in front of the conning
tower.
? You don?t like stoppin? dahn below, and yer
grouses when yer comes up ?ere. Yer like a bloomin?
bear with a bloomin? sore ?ead, blow yer ! ?
Peter grinned into Jerry?s face. ? A little dis-
cussion between Harris and Jones, apparently.?
They looked round to see Harris standing beside
the hatchway, through which the burly Jones was
just climbing.
? You ought to be glad of the chanst of a bref
o? fresh hair arter that stinkin? ?ole darn there,?
continued Harris in an admonitory tone. ? Not to
mention the fac? of yer bein? able to smoke up ?ere.?
? You shut your jaw,? growled Jones in his deep
voice. ? I don?t see why a Hun should stop a
British seaman smoking in his ship. It was good
enough for a British commander, so it should be
good enough for him.?
? You got no sense, that?s what it is,? retorted
Harris. ? Wantin? to blow the ?ole lot of us up for
your bloomin? smokes.?


Catching sight of the boys, Harris came towards
them, Jones following behind him like a huge
mastiff behind a shaggy Irish terrier.
? Nice sort of a pal ?e is,? remarked Harris
loudly as he dropped to the deck beside Peter.
? Grouse, grouse, grouse ; and puttin? hairs on
?isself ?cause ?e?s British. Fat lot o? good that is
when w T e?re prisoners on this Hun craft.?
Not particularly caring for the deck as a resting-
place, Jones stood slowly cramming tobacco into
his pipe and alternately regarding Harris coldly or
glancing sideways at the German seamen beside
him with a frankly antagonistic scowl on his face.
? I shouldn?t have thought he needed any more
hairs,? said Peter innocently. ?He looks hairy
enough to me.?
Jones?s frosty stare was transferred from Harris
to Peter.
I don?t mean ?airs,? explained Harris patiently.
? Not the ?airs of yer ?ead or whiskers. I means
the hairs what you puts on when you swanks.?
? You talk English just about as good as these
here Huns,? growled Jones as he lit his pipe. ? I
wonder you don?t get chummy with them.?
? I might do if it would do me a bit o? good,?
retorted Harris frankly.
Jones dropped the match overboard and took a
mighty puff. ?If I catch you doing any of that,
my son, I?ll smash the life out of you.?
Ho ! You will, will you ? Fink ?cause yer
like a helephant yer can come bullying everybody,


do yer ? I ain?t afraid o? you, yer big Welsh
rhinocrus. If ?
? Cool down, now. Cool down, old chap,?
laughed Peter, putting out a hand to restrain Harris
from rising. ? Remember we are on an enemy
craft and don?t want to quarrel amongst ourselves.?
? Well, don?t let ?im start miffing,? grumbled
Harris; but he sat down again and regarded the sea
as though he considered the matter closed.
The German seamen had been attracted by the
raised voices, and had tended to drift towards the
little group of Britishers, grinning as they exchanged
comments on the disturbance. The two beside
Jones appeared to be trying to read some meaning
in the alien words.
? Die Hunde heissen sich ! ? * the elder man
grinned to his companion as the quarrel fell into
a lull.
Jones belched out a huge puff of smoke, removed
his pipe from his mouth, and regarded the German
with surly aggressiveness.
? I ain?t as sick as you look, you greasy Hun,?
he said threateningly. ?You keep your sicks to
yourself.?
? Lummy ! Fancy old Jonesie knowin? the
langwich,? exclaimed Harris admiringly.
? I?m not so sure that he does,? replied Jerry,
who seemed to be finding something to amuse him.
The German had stared into the big Welshman?s
face in surprise for a moment, and then, catching the
* The dogs bite one another.


enmity in the remark from Jones?s expression, he
spat contemptuously into the sea.
? Das grosse Tier ist dumm / ? * he growled to his
companion.
? I don?t want any of your sarcasm neither,?
continued Jones with dangerous deliberation. ? I
ain?t so dumb but what I can give an opinion of you.
You can have the weight of my fist too, if you
want it.?
Steady on, Jones,? chuckled Jerry. ? You
want to control that temper of yours. After all, you
don?t know what he says.?
??E is a darn bully,? agreed Harris. ??E is
as right as pie one minute, and ready to pulp some
one the nex?. All these Welsh blighters is like that.?
Werfen Sie den Hund ins Was set !? f said
the younger German, who had flushed at the over-
bearing tone in Jones?s voice.
? Ach I Der Schweinhund ...? began the
older man, and he pushed against Jones to pass him
as though he was of no consequence; but before he
could say another word, the Welshman?s big fist
flew up, and the knuckles caught the German full on
the mouth.
? You fool ! ? shouted Peter. Springing to his
feet, he flung his arms around Jones.
E is like that all the time,? complained Harris
shrilly. ??E picks trouble wiv me to-day, and 'it
me too ! I don?t suppose that ?Un knew what ?e
was talkin? abart even.?
* The big animal is mad. f Throw the cur into the water.


Several of the German seamen came running
along the deck. The man who had been struck
had been seized by his companion, but he was
struggling furiously to free himself. Jerry scrambled
to his feet to aid Peter in holding the glowering
Jones. Harris remained where he was ; he was not
involving himself in trouble on account of the
unreasonable Jones.
? Der schwarze Hund ,? shouted the angry Ger-
man. ? Ich ucerde toten ihn !? *
With the excited Germans pressing forward and
the boys aware that the powerful Jones could throw
off their hold any time he chose, it was doubtful
for a while as to what turn events would take.
Then the voice of the watch officer sounded sharply
along the deck, and the strictly disciplined seamen
struggled back along the narrow deck to make a way
for their officer. Even the man who had been
attacked sprang to attention and moved away from
Jones, although he cast back a threatening glance
as he did so.
? Pull yourself together, man,? rapped out Peter
sharply. ?Is this the time or place for your ill-
temper ? ?
As the watch officer came through the ranks of
his men, the boys saw Commander Faversham
following close upon his heels.
? What is the meaning of this ? ? demanded the
officer, frowning angrily at the little group.
? I?m afraid this man lost his temper rather
? The black dog I I will kill him 1


JONES STUDIES GERMAN
unnecessarily, sir,? replied Jerry. ?It was a case
of misunderstanding.?
? Do you not know it is a serious offence to
strike a man on the deck of a German warship ? ?
demanded the officer sharply. ? When the blow
comes from an enemy prisoner it is most serious.?
Faversham?s voice boomed suddenly over the
watch officer?s shoulder. ? Have you been up to
your confounded nonsense again, Jones ? I?ll have
you in irons?that is, I?ll request the commander
of this craft to do so. Get below decks. One more
complaint, and ?
? He called me a sick swinehound, sir,? growled
Jones; but his temper seemed to have vanished as
quickly as it had come. ? That didn?t seem the
proper way for a Hun to talk to a British seaman.?
? I don?t think each quite understood what the
other was saying, sir,? intervened Jerry, with a
glint of amusement at the memory of the queer alter-
cation.
? Mind your own business,? barked Faversham.
? And you, Jones, obey orders and get below.
Excuse my interference,? he continued to the watch
officer, ? but this man is a rough customer, and I
know how to handle him. A good fighting man, but
not fit for any one to live with.?
? He must behave well while here,? replied the
German as they walked away. He made a sign to
the seamen and they quietly dispersed along the
deck, but there were many unfriendly glances
thrown back towards the Britishers.


? That bloke will get us into trouble yet,? re-
marked Harris. ? Too darn free wiv ?is ?ands, ?e
is. Tt me, ?e did, to-day.?
The boys found the rest of the day pass monoto-
nously enough. With nothing to do but stroll
in the limited space or sit at the mast foot, time
hung heavily on their hands. At meals, Grosmann
referred with wearisome repetition to the coming
downfall of England, even Lieb becoming decidedly
irritated with him. Jones did not appear on deck
again that day, and Harris wandered about like a
lost dog, sometimes above and sometimes below
decks. He told them that Jones was spending most
of his time in his hammock, but that at meal times
he had difficulty in containing his rage under the
obviously personal and malicious remarks concern-
ing himself bandied about amongst the German
seamen.
? There will be a bust-up yet,? prophesied the
little Cockney. ? They are after Jonesie?s blood,
and ?e is simply fretting to lap up some o? theirs.?
Owing to the limited accommodation in the
submarine the boys had been allotted bunks in the
main seamen?s quarters. To reach them they had
to pass through the navigating compartment and
also through the engine-room. The bunks in this
compartment were packed very closely together,
there being two sections, starboard and port, with
tables in each for meals. Jones and Harris were
quartered in the after torpedo chamber, where
several hammocks were hung.


Peter and Jerry were glad to turn into their
bunks as soon as the sun had set. At the narrow
tables the seamen off watch were reading, writing
letters, or playing games. They took little notice
of the boys, and, needless to say, the lads made
no effort to draw undue attention. Jerry was still
worrying over the difficult and distasteful part he
had pledged himself to play, and although, to his
weary mind, the possibilities of successfully impress-
ing the Germans with his sincerity seemed very
slight, he decided that no time was to be lost in
making a start. But how ? That was the question.
And then Peter solved the difficulty by leaning
over from his bunk and calling across the narrow
space, ? Heard anything, Jerry ? Anything about
what this craft is going to do next, I mean.?
Jerry had been lying on his side, his eyes on the
Germans at the tables, and as Peter spoke he saw
one of the men ?a young, fair fellow who was reading
a book ?start and glance quickly up at them. On
the instant the boy was on the alert, and the solution
of his problem flashed into his mind.
? No,? he said loudly. ? And I would not tell
you if I had. You won?t believe me, but I mean
what I have said. I have been a fool not to think of
looking after my own people before. I would sooner
return to them than be a prisoner of war all my life,
anyway.?
Not daring to make any sign to his chum, Jerry
could only hope that Peter would understand the
game he was playing. The very sincerity of Jerry?s


tone almost caused his betrayal, however. Peter
gaped at him for a few moments, and then demanded,
in a dazed voice, ? What on earth are you talking
about ? ?
The words were scarcely past his lips when he
realized what was Jerry?s object, and he went cold
at the thought that his blunder might have ruined all
their plans.
? Good-night! ? said Jerry in an unfriendly
tone, and he turned his face to the bulkhead.
Peter shot a swift glance round the compartment.
There was no one who appeared to be listening, but
Jerry must have had some reason for talking as he
had. Peter decided to try and cover his mistake.
? So you are trying that game again, are you ? ?
he demanded in an angry tone. ? I haven?t for-
gotten how you palled up with those pro-Germans
in Rio, my son ; nor the way you tried to justify
Germany in this war when we used to argue on the
Patagonia. I suppose you will be crawling to the
officers to make things easy for yourself next ? I
shall let Commander Faversham know about this
to-morrow.?
Again Peter let his eyes rove in search of the
possible listener. Then, as Jerry had ignored his
words, he slipped down into his bunk with a very
much overdone snort of disgust, and Jerry grinned
under cover of his blankets.
Through his eyelashes Peter watched the men
at the tables. Presently one of them glanced towards
the bunks, closed his book with elaborate careless-
-172


ness, threw it into his own bunk, and then strolled
from the compartment. Peter?s heart began to beat
fast. The seed had been sown ; what was it to
bring to his chum, and, eventually, himself and the
rest of their little band ?


CHAPTER XIV
DANGEROUS WORK
JERRY roused next morning to the sound of
Harris?s loud laugh. To his surprise he saw
the Cockney seated on the foot of a lower bunk
chatting cheerfully with a young German therein.
Jerry?s movement attracted Harris?s attention, and
he waved his hand in greeting.
? ?AJIo, young Jerry! ?Ere?s one of these
blighters as can talk a decent langwich. ?E was a
barber in London before the war.?
The seaman, a fair-haired young fellow with
smiling blue eyes, nodded to the boy in friendly
fashion. With a thrill of returning excitement Jerry
recognized the man who had been reading the book
the previous night.
? That?s right,? said the German in good English.
? If you are in difficulties or need anything you do
not wish to go to the officers for, just ask me, and
I will do what I can for you. Your people always
treated me well when I was in London.?
? Is that why you are helping to sink them with
torpedoes ? ? demanded the voice of Peter. They
looked up to see the boy?s shock head rearing above
the bunk.


Jerry smiled a little grimly at the question, and
Harris laughed outright, although he turned his
amusement at the end into a growl. ? Lummy !
That?s right,? he agreed. ? What you mean by it ? ?
The German had coloured slightly. ? I fight
for my Fatherland as you fight for yours,? he re-
plied, not without dignity. ?I do not complain
that you sank U 180, and would have sunk us if
you could.?
? Now, yer know there?s somefing in that too,?
remarked Harris, turning to the boys with mingled
admiration and agreement. ? We?d do the same in
?is place, eh ? ?
? Possibly. As it is, we are enemies, and the
less we have to do with one another the better.?
? That?s going to be a bit difficult, Peter,?
laughed Jerry. ?We are their prisoners, and must
make the best of it.?
Peter was not to be mollified. He climbed down
from his bunk and began to dress. ?I?m only a
prisoner while I have to be,? he snapped. ? I?m
not pretending to like it.?
? I was only offering to do you a kindness,?
retorted the German in an annoyed tone. ? You
need not take advantage of it if you do not wish.?
? Peter is rather hasty and irritable,? explained
Jerry soothingly. ?It is very decent of you to
offer help like that.?
? Of course you would be ready to slobber over
him. It is a chance to put yourself in favour, isn?t
it ? You dirty traitor ! ?


Peter spoke so vehemently and with such bitter-
ness that Jerry started, and the blood rushed to his
cheeks. He realized the object of the words almost
immediately, and was thankful that his own momen-
tary forgetfulness had done no harm. As it was,
the blush in his face gave the German, who was
watching the boy curiously, an impression that the
disagreement between the lads was genuine.
?I . . .? began Jerry, and then he paused, in
doubt just how to reply.
It was Harris who, taken aback with surprise
for a moment, made the next unconscious move in
the game.
? ?Alio ! ?Ad a row ? You don? ?alf lay it on
fick, you Pete, though ! ?
? So will you when you know the position,?
returned Peter venomously. ? I can understand
you having dealings with an out-and-out Hun;
but a man who turns his country down to save his
own skin ?
?I?m not turning down my own country. I?m
returning to it, that?s all.?
Harris was staring in a dazed way from the one
to the other of the boys. ? Lummy ! ? he said.
? Fancy you two rowing ! Ain?t never seen that
before. What you talking abart, anyway, young
Pete ? Talking abart traitors and fings.?
? I?ll explain on deck, where there aren?t inter-
ested listeners,? replied Peter.
Harris scratched his head and looked at the man
in the bunk. ? Meaning ol? Schmidt ? ? he re-
-176


marked. ? All right. We?ll ?ave a chat arter break-
fast.?
Jerry lay in his bunk, his mind a turmoil of
doubt. It was so improbable that the Germans
would accept him as one of themselves (the very
idea that they could do so disturbed him); on the
other hand, he would probably be despised and
abused, and Harris and Jones would never regard
him in the same light whatever happened. If he
were put in a German prison camp with the stigma
of a would-be traitor on his name, what sort of a
life would he lead ? And who would be convinced
that it had all been a pretence with a patriotic object ?
Well, there was just one chance that it would
succeed ; and in this war individual feelings or
sufferings did not count when even the slenderest
opportunity to serve Britain arose. He would go
through with it.
A silence had fallen in the compartment, each
of the occupants being occupied with his own
thoughts. Peter was nearly dressed, and evidently
intended going on deck as soon as he was ready.
Harris at last opened his mouth to make some
further remark, when there came the tramp of
sea-boots, and Commander Faversham appeared in
the doorway.
? You may go on deck when you wish, any of
you ; but you must not loiter in the navigating or
other compartments. That is the order I have to
pass on to you. You had better hurry up and
dress, breakfast will be ready in a few minutes.?


? Very good, sir,? replied Peter promptly, and
then he hastened to add, ? I want a word privately
with you as soon as possible, sir. This chap here
speaks English ; he was in London before the war.?
The last comment had obviously been made as
a warning against incautious remarks, but Faversham
gave Schmidt the briefest of glances. ? Does he ? ?
he grunted ; and then he went on, ? I will see you
on deck after breakfast. And remember, you are
not on the deck of a liner when you go above. You
fool merchantmen are likely to fall overboard if you
haven?t a forty-foot beam.? With this characteristic
growl the commander turned and left the com-
partment.
Schmidt laughed. ? Your captain does not hide
his poor opinion of you ! But what does he mean
by merchantmen ? I thought the Q boats were
manned by naval ratings ? ?
Peter grunted non-committally ; but Jerry has-
tened to explain. ?We were picked up from one
of the three ships torpedoed in the convoy the
other night. Commander Faversham and Jones are
the only members of the Chowkidar's crew.?
? I see.? The German smiled. ? But there
were five torpedoed from your convoy, not three.
No doubt you did not notice the other two in the
confusion.?
? Five! ? both boys exclaimed at once, and
Jerry could not keep the dismay from his voice.
Harris almost whispered his ? Lummy ! ?
Schmidt nodded. ? Yes ; and our commander
178


grumbled, because he said it should have been
seven at the least. Our ?arrangements ?are not
yet working completely smoothly. However, next
time ...? He shrugged his shoulders. ? But
I am talking too much. No doubt you will see
enough for yourselves without that.?
Jerry slipped from his bunk and began to dress,
and Peter, as though disliking the mere proximity
of his chum, promptly left the compartment.
Harris stared after him, looked curiously at Jerry,
and then cleared his throat noisily. ? Fink I?ll get
a bit o? fresh hair,? he remarked, and hurried after
Peter.
? It?s beginning,? thought Jerry.
Schmidt was also dressing now, and Jerry waited
in silence, hoping the German would make the
first move.
? Just what does all this mean about your favour-
ing Germany ? ? asked the seaman at last. ?Is it
a joke of some kind ? ?
? My people are of German descent,? replied
Jerry seriously. ? And although I was brought up
in New Zealand, I consider myself German.?
? Yet you have been serving on British ships all
through the war ! ?
? I had no choice,? returned Jerry.
A gong began drumming in the main part of
the vessel.
? Breakfast! ? said Schmidt cheerfully. ? You
had better get along promptly or Grosmann will
jump on you.?


? How is it you were the only one in bunk ? ?
asked Jerry curiously, as he turned to leave the
compartment. ? What is your job aboard ? ?
? Wireless operator,? replied Schmidt. ? I did
an unusually long night-watch last night.? He
began to hum a tune, and Jerry went off to the mess
cabin for?ard.
Grosmann was rather surly this morning, and
had little to say to any one. Lieutenant Lieb chatted
occasionally with Faversham, but both were non-
committal in their remarks when war matters were
touched upon, and the lieutenant frequently fell
into brown studies. Both Jerry and Peter sat
wordless through the meal, and Jerry watched for
some sign that the German officers were aware of
his supposed disaffection. Neither by word or
look, however, did they betray knowledge until the
boy was leaving the cabin behind Peter and Com-
mander Faversham. Then he felt a touch on his
sleeve and turned to find Lieutenant Lieb beside him.
? Go into my cabin,? ordered the lieutenant
quietly. With a glance after his disappearing com-
panions, Jerry obeyed.
A few minutes later, both Lieb and Grosmann
entered the tiny cabin. The lieutenant sat himself
at his miniature desk, while Grosmann lounged
against the side of the doorway, where he could
command a view of the navigating compartment
entrance. Jerry, standing between them, glanced
nervously from the one to the other. His hour of
trial had come.


? Now see here, cousin,? began Lieb in a
business-like voice, ? just what is the meaning of
this game you are playing ? ?
? I don?t understand you, sir.? Jerry was deter-
mined to advance carefully.
? Don?t lie ! ? barked Grosmann. ? You know
very well what is meant.?
? You were heard to say last night that you had
pro-German leanings, ? ? said Lieutenant Lieb patiently.
? How and why do you propose to change your side
so abruptly ? ?
? There is no need for me to change,? replied
Jerry. ?I am German.? He hated himself as he
said the words.
? Are you ? ? There was a queer little smile
playing round the corners of the lieutenant?s mouth.
? I hope so ! Spying is a dirty game, and it leads
to only one end.?
? Death ! ? snapped Grosmann viciously. ?If
you are doing this to work us harm, your end will
come very swiftly, my smart Englishman ! ?
Matters were not going too well, and Jerry?s
brain was working swiftly for some method of
convincing the officers without having to lie too
directly to them. Fortunately Grosmann gave a
new twist to the questioning while Jerry was still
hesitating what to say.
How then,? he demanded, ? do you discover
this thing so late ? You, who are a British midship-
man ! Do you think us fools that you should volun-
teer for enemy service and then profess love for us ? ?


? I am not a midshipman,? replied Jerry quickly.
? I am a merchant service cadet.?
Both officers laughed incredulously. Jerry hur-
ried on with forceful insistence. ? I was put to
the service before the war. My father never thought
of war between the two countries ?
? A strange blindness for a German ! ? inter-
rupted Grosmann harshly.
? Once in the service,? continued Jerry, ? I had
no choice. I was on the Patagonia , torpedoed the
other night. Here, look ! I can prove it.?
Thrusting his hand into his jacket pocket he
drew out several letters addressed to himself on the
ship. One he handed to Grosmann, the others to
Lieutenant Lieb. The officers examined the envel-
opes critically, and Grosmann drew out the letter
and began to read.
? It would seem there is some truth in your
tale,? remarked Lieb thoughtfully. ? Then if your
sympathies are still German, how did you come to
take part in the attack on this vessel ? ?
? We did not know the Chowkidar was a mystery
ship when we were picked up by her,? explained
Jerry quite truthfully. ? Our chaps all tumbled
into the nearest boat when you attacked and
shelled us.?
? And, of course, it was quite by accident that
you were armed with a revolver and jumped to our
deck at the given signal! ? said Lieb dryly, and he
threw the letters on to his desk.
? Ach ! Yes. That will need to be explained,?
182


remarked Grosmann, refolding the letter and thrust-
ing it into his pocket.
? Commander Faversham told us the position
when we w r ere in the boat,? said Jerry a trifle breath-
lessly. He felt that he was getting into a tight corner.
?We had the guns from him. Anyway, if I had
been unfriendly I should not have dived into the
sea after you, Herr Grosmann.?
?So it w r as you, was it ? But there were two
who came to me. I remember so much, although
I w r as half drowned.?
? His clothes were certainly wet,? remarked
Lieb. ? And those of that queer fellow, Harris.?
? Yes, Harris came in after me,? agreed Jerry,
? and we pulled Herr Grosmann out between us.?
? Then, if you are German, you can speak the
language ? ? asked Lieb suddenly.
For a moment Jerry was at a loss. So much
hung on his convincing the officers that he had
German sympathies ; but at the same time all hopes
of hearing incautious remarks which would convey
valuable information would be gone once the Ger-
mans knew he understood them. Fortunately, before
he was forced to make a hasty decision, they were
interrupted by the appearance of a seaman in the
doorway.
?You are wanted on deck, Herr Captain,? he
said, saluting Lieb.
The lieutenant nodded. ? I leave our friend to
your tender mercies,? he said to Grosmann, and
then he left the cabin.


Grosmann strode over to Lieb?s desk, surveyed
Jerry with a fierce stare for a while, then he picked
up the letters from the desk, twisted them round
with a thoughtful frown, and again staring at the
boy began to speak in an aggressive, barking tone.
? If you are so anxious to betray your adopted
country you had better answer some questions.?
He paused again, and then continued in a voice
which he evidently considered was calm and judicial.
? I am inclined to believe in your sincerity, Lieb.
I have had to do "with deserters before, and I recog-
nize the hang-dog look. Your cousin, the lieutenant,
is inclined to doubt you. He considers any one with
Lieb blood is incapable of desertion.? The flotille-
kommandant smiled sarcastically. ? I am not so ?
prejudiced. Now ? ?he drew a sheet of paper
towards him and picked up a pen ?? what was the
ship on which you served ? ?
? S.S. Patagonia , sir.? Jerry marvelled at the
mildness and submission of his own voice. Inwardly
he was boiling. Not only at the insults to the name
of Lieb, but also that he himself had called them
down on the good folk who had adopted him ; also
the expression ? hang-dog ? had stung. Little did
Herr Grosmann realize that that shamed drooping
of Jerry?s lips was caused by the deceit he was forc-
ing himself to use in serving England, not by any
submissive truckling for the purpose of saving his
own skin.
? Ach, yes. I know the ship, you had better be
careful. Now, what line is she ? ?


? The Blue Star Line, sir.?
? Captain?s name ? ?
? Captain Beresford.?
? And what was she carrying ? ?
? Coffee, sugar, butter, and frozen meat, sir.?
? Excellent! We pinched the bellies of the
Englishmen with our torpedoes, eh ! ? Grosmann
chuckled, and then, becoming exceedingly grave,
considered the questions carefully as though attach-
ing much weight to them.
? Where did the torpedo strike you ? ? he asked
suddenly.
? Near the bridge, sir; on the port side. That
was the queer part; it must have come right
through the convoy to strike us on our inward side.?
? I did not ask for any opinions,? barked Gros-
mann. ? How long did she take to sink ? ?
? About ten minutes, I should think.?
? How many men did this mystery ship?the
Chow ?, Chow ?, whatever her filthy name was ?
how many men did she carry ? ?
So far, Jerry had answered freely, convinced that
to play his part successfully he must risk giving
useful information to the enemy. Questions on the
Chowkidar , however, made him uneasy. It would
be so easy to ruin everything by arousing an ever-
ready suspicion ; on the other hand, if he gave the
information, and, after all, they were unable to carry
out their scheme, serious harm might be done.
If only Commander Faversham could whisper an
instruction into his ear ! (Jerry almost smiled at the
(3.7 M) 13 xB5


idea of Faversham trying to whisper.) Then the
thought struck him that the commander must have
known this questioning would take place, and he
was evidently prepared to take the risk. Jerry?s
mind was made up. He would play the traitor to
the full, and hope to be able to strike all the more
forcibly when the moment came.
? Well ? What are you waiting for ? ? demanded
Grosmann sharply.
? I was trying to reckon up how many there
were,? returned Jerry glibly. ? They kept out of
sight so, and we were forbidden to roam about the
ship, although we did not know why. The only ones
we saw were those who acted the ? panic party,?
and I should say there were about thirty of them.
But, of course, there were still the gun crews and
those who worked the ship.?
? How many guns were there ? ?
Some imp of mischief whispered in Jerry?s ear
that Herr Grosmann had had closer experience with
the guns than any one else ! Jerry, however, gave
a more tactful answer. ? There seemed to be five
firing, but there may have been more on the other
side of the ship.?
Grosmann grunted, but before he could put any
more questions, Lieutenant Lieb re-entered the
cabin. Grosmann glanced at him inquiringly, but
it was to Jerry the lieutenant spoke, and he spoke in
German.
? We have news of a British convoy,? he said.
?We are on our way to intercept and attack it.?
186


It was with the utmost difficulty that Jerry
controlled his expression. The lieutenant had
maintained a casual tone as though speaking his
own language without thinking ; but Jerry at once
scented a trap. He tried to look puzzled and
uncertain, and he turned towards Herr Grosmann
as though begging an explanation. The blundering
Grosmann obligingly came to the rescue promptly,
to Jerry?s immense relief.
? You forget he knows no German, Lieb. The
lieutenant says,? he explained to Jerry, ? that we
are on our way to sink some more of John Bull?s
food ships. What do you think of that ? ?
Jerry turned eagerly to the lieutenant. ? Will
you let me see some of it, sir ? ? he asked quickly.
The queer little smile again twisted the corners
of Lieutenant Lieb?s mouth. ? There will be little
to see,? he replied. ? But perhaps you will have
your part in it. Now go on deck ; I wish to talk
with Herr Grosmann.?


CHAPTER XV
JONES ENJOYS HIMSELF
WHEN Jerry reached the deck he was aware at
once that news of his activities had passed
around the ship. Heads turned towards him,
and every gaze was curious. There was a percep-
tible change in the attitude of the German seamen
towards him. Some nodded, including a few who
yesterday had ignored his existence; one man
took his pipe from his lips, tilted the stem in friendly
gesture, and uttered a guttural ? Guten Morgen ! ?
Jerry looked anxiously along the foredeck to
discover how his friends were taking it. Peter and
Harris were sitting on the deck talking together;
Jones, disdaining the deck as usual, leaned against
the wireless mast, puffing at his monstrous pipe.
None of them noticed Jerry until he had almost
reached them. Doubtful how he should best pro-
ceed under the changing circumstances, and wishing
to play his part as naturally as possible, Jerry let his
steps lag as he neared his comrades. He was aware
that from the bridge and from all parts of the deck
he was being watched curiously.
Harris was the first to glance round and see him.
188


The Cockney opened his mouth ; closed it again ;
appeared about to call a greeting ; changed his mind,
and then turned abruptly to Peter.
? ?Ere ?e is ! ? he said bluntly.
Peter looked up inquiringly, but on seeing Jerry
he turned pink, dropped his eyes, and turned his
head deliberately away.
Jones was evidently in one of his good-humoured
moods. Blowing out a cloud of smoke, he took his
pipe from his mouth and grinned a welcome.
? Thought perhaps it was your turn to stay below
to-day,? he joked. ?You would find it as funny as
a funeral. I nearly went off my rocker.?
Jerry smiled faintly. ? I was not sure whether
my company was wanted,? he said.
Jones looked so puzzled that Jerry saw the big
seaman had not yet been told of his supposed
defection.
? Oh, I don?t blame you for holding me back
yesterday,? said Jones. ?It is a pity I did not
slaughter that Hun, but I quite see that you were
only thinking of me when you tried to stop me.?
Peter gave a short and scornful laugh.
? Well, that is true enough, isn?t it ? ? demanded
Jones a trifle testily. ? I haven?t known this young
fellow long; but I can see he is the right stuff.?
Harris fidgeted uneasily. ? All the while I knew
young Jerry on the ol? Patty ?e was always one o?
the best,? he declared loudly, ?We all ?as our
opinins; but I do say as ?ow I don?t see no need
to turn on ?im. ?E ain?t doin? any ?arm, is ?e ? ?


? We are at war,? replied Peter grimly. ? And
a traitor is a traitor. I don?t think it was your skin
he was worrying about, Jones ;it was his own !
Jerry was surprised at the thorough way his
chum was acting. With his impatient nature Peter
must have found it difficult to maintain so rigidly
bitter an attitude. Jerry knew that it was loyalty
to himself and a determination to aid the difficult
task undertaken by his chum that made Peter carry
his appearance of enmity to such lengths. After
all, though it was hard, it was the better way for
both of them ; and if the watchful Germans were
to be impressed with his sincerity, Jerry must be
prepared to be driven whole-heartedly from the
company of his fellow countrymen.
Jones was looking from one to another with a
growing frown. ? What are you gassing about ? ?
he demanded. ? And you, young fellow ? (this to
Jerry), ? what are you looking so hang-dog about ?
There are some funny expressions flying about, ain?t
there ? ?
Both Peter and Harris were silent, and Jerry,
after waiting a moment, decided he must burn his
boats himself.
? I will tell you frankly,? he began. ?lam of
German family, and only served in British ships
because I was in the service when the war broke out.
Now I have a chance to return to my own people,
I am doing so.?
For a few seconds Jones was so astounded that
he forgot to smoke. Then the blood rushed darkly
190


to his face. He took his pipe from his lips and
shook the ashes from it viciously.
? Is this some joke ? ? he demanded.
? Joke ? ? growled Peter.
? What I says,? interposed Harris loudly, ? is
that every man ?as a right to choose for ?imself.?
?Itis no joke,? persisted Jerry firmly. ? I have
been speaking to the officers just now.?
Jones straightened and stepped over to tower
above the boy. ? And what have you been speaking
about, you rotten little spy ?? he blustered. ? Been
telling ?em what you saw aboard the Chowkidar ? ?
? Nah, you calm down,? snapped Harris with
a sparkle in his eye. ? Young Jerry wouldn?t do
that. ?E may be a ?Un born, but ?e hacts like a
Henglishman.?
A harsh voice spoke in German over Jerry?s
shoulder. ?Do not fear for his bullying. We will
help you to teach the pig a lesson.?
It was the seaman whom Jones had assaulted
the previous day. Burning for his revenge, he had
quickly noticed the growing discord amongst the
Britishers. Jones flung his head back sharply and
his eyes met those of his enemy. His rage flared
to its height.
?So that?s your game. Well, have it then ! ?
His fist leaped outwards at lightning speed. It
caught Jerry on the side of the chin with stunning
force, and flung him against the German so suddenly
that they fell sprawling to the deck together.
Harris must have been alert for some such


action, for even as the blow fell he darted from the
deck like a striking snake, and his clenched fists
beat one after another on Jones?s cheek. The big
seaman scarcely flinched. He spun round, and a
blow on the chest sent Harris headlong upon Peter,
who had kept his eyes fixedly on the water alongside.
As Jerry, half stunned and bleeding from the
mouth, raised himself on his hands, a number of
German seamen ran past him with a clatter of feet.
The next few minutes were a confused commotion.
Jones plunged into the midst of his assailants, his
fists working like piston rods, flinging them hither
and thither. That none went into the sea was
miraculous. So strong and fierce was his attack
that they gave before him. Lieutenant Lieb?s voice
rang angrily from the bridge, but no one seemed to
hear it. Peter had seized Harris round the waist,
and the Cockney was adding to the uproar by his
bellowing and swearing as he vainly strove to free
himself.
Jerry managed to scramble to his feet in the
middle of the struggle. His head was buzzing from
the blow, but he was thoroughly enjoying himself.
The relief of action after the strain was like a tonic.
Another sailor staggered past him, blood streaming
down his lips and chin. And then Jerry found
himself face to face with the raging Welshman, and
their eyes met. With one impulse they leaped at
one another. The boy managed to dodge the blow
swung at him, and his fists rattled smartly on Jones?s
chin. Jones shook his head irritably, and promptly
192


flung his huge arms round the boy to swing him off
his feet. For a moment Jerry felt his ribs crushing
in a vice-like grip, and he gasped for breath. Then
he was flung upwards and outwards. Sea and sky
whirled before his eyes, and he plunged into the
cold sea.
Never at a loss in the water, he struck out at once
in the direction he thought was away from the sub-
marine. His only real danger was the threshing
propellers, for the sea was calm, and he would soon
be picked up. He broke to the surface puffing and
gasping, and glanced quickly around. The submarine
had gone past him but was coming round again.
A voice startled him, coming from beside him.
? Are you all right, young Jerry ? ?
? Harris I Why did you come over ? ?
? Fink I was goin??(gasp, puff) ?let yer drown
?(puff)?cause o? that blighter ? ?
Another head splashed through the water about
five yards off, and Jerry saw that it was Peter.
There had been a limit to which the boy could pre-
tend enmity to his chum.
? He shouldn?t have come over,? said Jerry
unthinkingly.
? Oh, ?e ain?t so bad?as ?e makes out,? panted
Harris. He little knew the reason for Jerry?s
remark.
The U 197 was nosing back slowly towards them,
and men were leaning over with boat hooks to help
them aboard. Seeing that Jerry was in no danger,
Peter swam to meet the vessel, and before the others

were aboard he had hurried below. The cold dip
had cleared away the effects of Jones?s blow, and
Jerry scrambled up the side of the boat without
difficulty. All was now quiet on the deck, and there
was no sign of Jones. Another submarine had
turned and was sliding alongside the U 197, her
commander exchanging calls with Lieutenant Lieb.
? Get below and change as quickly as possible.?
It was Grosmann who spoke. He was frowning
heavily and spoke in a gruff voice, but there was a
certain satisfaction in his eyes as he looked at Jerry.
? One of the men will lend you some clothes,? he
added.
? It?s all right, sir. I can strip off and dry here.?
? He can have a uniform of mine, sir, if it
does not matter about him wearing our uniform,?
said Schmidt, who had been one of the most active
in hauling the boy aboard.
? Yes, give him one of yours. Perhaps he had
better keep it.?
Jerry?s heart leaped as the officer turned away.
This affair had done more to convince the Germans
of the boy?s sincerity than a month of argument
could have done. Jerry would have liked to have
stayed on deck to hear what the other submarine
commander had to say, but it would have appeared
too suspicious. However, Commander Faversham
was on deck now, so all was well.
Schmidt s uniform fitted the boy fairly well
except for a looseness in places. Jerry glanced at
the badges on his arm. To his surprise he felt


none of the distaste which he would have expected.
Instead there was the thrill of adventure. Perhaps
the fight on deck had relieved his nerves ; but more
probably he was beginning to enjoy this contest of
wits and nerves into which he had now thoroughly
thrown himself.
? What is happening to Jones ? ? he asked.
The seaman had put up a wonderful fight, and Jerry
appreciated Commander Faversham?s idea when he
had said that ? if they were lucky ? they would
have Jones?s help in the projected attack on the
wireless cabin. The Welshman was surly and
fiery tempered, but he was a first-class fighting
man.
? I don?t know ; but it will be something to make
him sorry for himself,? replied Schmidt grimly.
As he spoke the red-haired petty officer, Gun-
stein, entered the compartment. Gunstein had never
forgiven Jones his method of arrival, and he was now
grinning savagely. ? They have transferred that
madman to the U 212,? he said gleefully to Schmidt.
? He will find himself in good hands when Captain
Henkel deals with him, lam thinking. But I have
come to tell you that the commander wants that
young man when he is ready.?
Schmidt innocently translated the remarks to
Jerry. The boy?s heart had sunk at the words.
They had lost a useful man, and the boy felt it was
his fault. However, he consoled himself with the
reflection that at any rate he had gained a big
advance in his plans in exchange.


Jerry lost no time in making his way to the
captain?s cabin, and found himself the centre of
interest as he passed through the navigating com-
partment. There was no doubt now of the crew?s
friendship.
Grosmann was in the cabin with Lieb, and he
grinned broadly as the boy entered. ? Ach ! There
is no doubt on which side you will now fight,? he
exclaimed. ?Did I not say he was a genuine
deserter ? ? he demanded of Lieb.
?You keep saying it,? returned the lieutenant
testily. ? Personally, I am not pleased with these
disturbances on my ship. What started this fight ? ?
he added to Jerry.
? Jones asked me if I had given you any informa-
tion about the Chouckidar , and I told him I had,?
replied Jerry.
? There was no need for you to talk to those
fellows,? interrupted Grosmann severely. ?If you
are going still to be friendly with them you are of
no use to us.?
Lieutenant Lieb sat for a few moments con-
sidering Jerry with a lingering doubt in his eyes.
? Well, are you not going to put him to the
test ? ? demanded Grosmann impatiently.
The lieutenant?s eyes rested on the badges on
the boy?s arm. ? You have done wireless service
on British vessels, I believe ? ? he asked suddenly.
? Yes, sir.?
? And you are genuinely prepared to assist us
if called upon to do so ? ?


There was a chill of premonition at Jerry?s
heart, but he answered boldly enough, ? \es, sir.
? Very well. You are aware that we are on our
way to intercept a convoy near the African coast ?
It is our wish to have them farther westward than
they are steering, and to make them more watchful
of the coast than the open ocean. recognize
this ? ? The lieutenant held up a black-covered
book, and Jerry gave a gulp of dismay. Only too
well he knew it to be the secret Admiralty signal code
for British merchant vessels.
Both officers laughed at his expression of sur-
prise.
? We are better informed than you thought,
eh ? ? smiled Lieb. ? Now, our idea is to send a
series of U-boat warnings as though they came from
an attacked British vessel near the coast. They
will need to be brief so that the cruiser cannot get
direction finders on them; we shall be, of course,
far away from the position given in the signals.?
? I see the idea,? said Jerry slowly. ? But what
part do I play in it ? ?
? You,? answered the lieutenant deliberately,
? will send the signals.?
For the first few seconds after this announcement
Jerry was paralysed with horrified dismay. That
his pretence would lead to his being the agent for
leading the British ships into destruction had never
occurred as possible in his worst fears.
? Well, why do you not answer ? ? demanded
Grosmann sharply. ? Where is the anxiety to have


a part in the convoy attack which you have loudly
claimed ? ?
? You certainly do not look pleased, cousin,
commented Lieb softly.
Jerry laughed a trifle shakily. ?It certainly
came as a shock. You must give me time to get
used to these ideas. I am, of course, ready to do
as you ask, but why cannot Schmidt do it ? I might,
by my clumsiness, ruin everything.?
? The task is scarcely a difficult one,? returned
Lieb. ? The idea was suggested by Herr Grosmann,
who has great faith in your integrity and wished
to prove to me my own doubts were groundless.?
(Grosmann coloured and moved uneasily under the
sarcasm, but said nothing.) ? For the rest, Schmidt,
of course, could do it; but he is a naval signaller
with all the tendency to high speeds, whereas you
would send with the slower regularity of the merchant
operator. Your signal would sound more natural,
and your ?I mean the British naval officers are very
shrewd and watchful. Even so slight a thing might
betray us. Now, will you do it ? ?
? Yes, now I understand, I will do it,? replied
Jerry boldly.
And indeed he was prepared to go through with
it. What did it matter who sent the signal, since,
in any case, it would go ? He would make this
further sacrifice of his feelings to consolidate his
position on the ship, and to get a first footing in the
wireless cabin. Who could say what might follow
from this ?


Lieb had risen and was motioning him to follow.
The lieutenant pushed aside the sliding door of the
wireless cabin, and Jerry saw before him a tiny
space in which the radio apparatus was installed
with marvellous economy of room. The operator
on watch, a stocky, bearded man named Baumgart,
looked up as the door opened, and seeing the officers,
pushed aside his earpieces to hear what they had
to say.
? Switch on to the British merchant ship spark,
Baumgart,? ordered Lieb.
The man thrust home a switch, made a few
adjustments to a spark gap behind him, and altered
a few connections. Then he stood to attention.
? It is ready, Herr Captain,? he said, and pointed
to one of two signalling keys on the table.
Lieutenant Lieb laid a slip of paper before Jerry.
? Here is the position you are to signal. You should
know the procedure ; go ahead.
Jerry leant over the paper. ? 12.35 N. 22.00W,
he read. He placed his finger-tips on the knob of
the key indicated, and for one wild moment he was
tempted to flash out a warning to those ships run-
ning to their destruction. Was not this the very
opportunity for which Commander Faversham had
planned, and he himself had worked ? But Jerry
swiftly realized how closely the Germans were
watching him. One sign of betrayal, one false letter
signalled, and he would be flung from the apparatus
with the warning unsent and his own work undone.
The time had not yet come.


His fingers pressed the key.
? S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S. ALLO 1235N 2200.
1235N 2200. ALLO ?
? Stop ! ? cried Lieb sharply, and knocked the
boy?s hand from the key. ?You must not give
them time to use the direction finder. You will
send another signal in about two days? time. That
is all for the present; you may go.?
As Jerry passed down the little alleyway with
mixed emotions in his breast, he caught sight of
Commander Faversham sitting in the mess cabin
reading. His eyes lifted to the boy?s for an instant,
but there was nothing in them to tell what he knew
or thought.

CHAPTER XVI
COMING EVENTS
FOR the next two days Jerry led a life of misery.
Although on a few brief occasions Peter was
able to drop the mask and exchange a few hurried
words, there was too little privacy and too great
danger of discovery for him to take the risk very
often. Commander Faversham made no active
display of hostility, but at the same time he had
little to say to the boy, even when he met him face
to face on the deck.
Harris and Schmidt were the boy?s only com-
panions. The little Cockney declined to suit any
one?s opinions but his own in his dealings with
Jerry. Sometimes he would keep away for hours
at a time ; and then he would come and chat volubly
on a hundred subjects. Schmidt spent most of his
spare time in sympathetic company with the boy,
but he was called away at all sorts of unexpected
times, and Jerry noted with surprise that the operator
never seemed to go beyond the conning tower,
certainly he did not go to the wireless cabin. That
there was some secret activity in the conning tower
was confirmed by an order forbidding any of the
202


COMING EVENTS
prisoners from using that route for reaching or
leaving the deck. All, including Commander Faver-
sham, were compelled to use the deck hatches.
Jerry reflected that his own inclusion in the
order was sufficient proof that he was not yet fully
trusted. Certainly he had gained very little by
his play-acting. Lieb and Grosmann were cordial
enough to him, but he had had nothing of value
from them in the way of information. He spent
hours sitting near the German seamen, and listened
eagerly to their conversation, but nothing was
dropped to give him any clue to the method of
attack on the convoys. Only Baumgart, the second
operator, grumbled about the extra duty he was
having to do. Apparently Schmidt was carried for
some special duty, and the man who had acted with
Baumgart was one of those killed when the Chow-
kidar's boat crew attacked the submarine. Baumgart
appeared to regard Jerry as the direct cause of his
extra duty in the wireless cabin, and made himself
as unpleasant as he reasonably could to the boy.
It was Harris who gave Jerry the first warning
of the imminence of action. The flotilla had been
sailing on the eastward course now for three full
days, the only change being when fresh vessels took
over the scouting duty on the wings. In this work
the slower, smaller U 197 never took part; she
plodded on at the end of the line without responsi-
bility or variation in her crew?s routine. Jerry was
sitting by the gun late in the afternoon when he
saw Harris emerge by the deck hatch and hurry


to where Peter was lounging in his favourite place
against the wireless mast. There was excitement in
every fling of the Cockney?s arms ; in his quick,
nervous steps, half-open mouth, and shining eyes.
Nevertheless he flung himself down beside Peter
with an exaggerated air of carelessness, and glanced
over his shoulder as though pleased with the way
he had deceived every one.
? ?Alio, Cully ! ? he said loudly. ? Nice sort
of afternoon, ain?t it ? ?
Before Peter could reply, Harris leant over and
said, in a husky voice which carried easily to Jerry
half-way along the deck, ? Lay low an? keep yer
eyes skinned. There is sumfin? doin? aboard this
?ere packet! ?
Peter laughed unpleasantly. ?If you cast your
eye at Lieutenant Lieb you?ll see the effect of your
picture-play ?mystery acting ! ? he said disgustedly.
Harris took a painfully cautious peep over his
shoulder. ? Lummy ! There y?are,? he exclaimed
triumphantly. ? I told yer ! ?E knows we ?as to
be watched nar.?
? Oh, speak in your ordinary voice and spit it
out,? said Peter irritably. ? That fool whisper of
yours can be heard for miles.?
Jerry smiled. The strain of the last few days
had not improved Peter?s nerves. Harris was very
hurt to find his great news so coldly received.
? Oh, all right, if yer finks yer knows everything,
I won?t tell yer,? he said in an aggrieved voice.
? I?ll go an? talk to some one as will listen.?


COMING EVENTS
Having delivered his ultimatum, Harris waited a
moment for Peter to express regret; but the boy
continuing to stare gloomily at the sea, Harris looked
round for a means of carrying out his threat, and
to his relief caught sight of Jerry?s smiling face.
Scrambling to his feet, he came and placed himself
side by side with the boy.
? They are buzzin? abart like bees darn below,
Jerry,? he said. ? I suppose you knows all abart
it. Is there a hattack cornin? off or something ? ?
? I hear little more than you do, Harris,? replied
Jerry. ? What do you mean they are doing ? ?
? All talkin? and laughin? at once. An? that chap
Schmidt was off watch, but that red-?aired petty
orificer comes a-shoutin? out ?is name, and Schmidt
?opped off like lightnin?. Well, I wiffs somefing
was doin? and I ?ops up ?ere to tell Peter, but ? e's
too ?igh an? mighty to listen.?
Jerry cast about for some means of getting rid of
Harris. ? Have you told Commander Faversham ? ?
he asked.
? No, I ?adn?t thought of ?im. D?yer reckon I
oughter tell ?im ? Won?t ?e go shoutin? an? bellowin?
at a chap ? ?
? I think he should know at once,? replied Jerry
gravely. ?You and he should put your heads
together over this.?
? I?ll go an? find ?im right away,? cried the
gratified Harris, and he scrambled up and went off,
full of importance.
Jerry glanced towards the bridge. Lieutenant


Lieb and the watch officer were leaning on the fore
rail talking earnestly together. With heart beating
a little faster Jerry rose quietly and strolled aim-
lessly along the deck, apparently deep in thought.
He passed the open fore hatch and made his way
around the crescent-shaped deck beside the conning
tower till he came to the iron ladder leading up to
the bridge. A swift glance showed him that the
afterdeck was nearly deserted. The two officers
would have their backs to him. With luck he might
get a glimpse of what was going on in the conning
tower.
He w r as taking a risk of wrecking all the confi-
dence in himself he had been at such pains to build
up in the Germans? minds. But the critical hour
was approaching, and something must be done, and
done quickly, if any attempt to warn the convoy
was to be made. It was all or nothing now, and the
onus of securing information had been laid on his
shoulders.
He went up the ladder at an ordinary rate, and
as openly as though he had every right to be there.
A seaman on the bridge looked at him hesitatingly,
but Jerry?s confident manner, coupled with the man?s
fear of overstepping the rigid discipline of the
German service, made him hesitate before inter-
rupting the officers? talk. Before he had quite
made up his mind what to do, Jerry had crossed the
bridge and began to climb down into the conning
tower. As soon as the boy had his head below the
deck level he looked eagerly around.


COMING EVENTS
At a folding table at the front of the conning
tower Flotille-Kommandant Grosmann pored over
a sheet of paper and glanced from it to a chart.
Near him, Schmidt was just closing the flap of a
tall flat mahogany cabinet which was bolted to the
side of the conning tower. With a thrill Jerry saw
that heavy cables led upwards from the cabinet, and
he recognized at once that it was a compact wireless
set. Had he been a minute sooner he might have
gathered more of its nature or construction. Schmidt
turned to stand to attention beside Grosmann, and
Jerry went quickly and quietly down the ladder,
hoping to reach the lower hatch and the main com-
partment without being noticed. Unluckily, just as he
stepped from the last rung, Grosmann turned round.
The German let out an oath of anger which rang
loudly in the confined space. ? What are you doing
here ? ? he shouted. ? Lieber Gott im Himmel!
How dare you disobey orders ? ?
Jerry gaped at him in dismay, at a loss what to
reply. He heard hasty footsteps overhead and an
exclamation in Lieb?s voice. The lieutenant came
clattering down into the conning tower.
? What does this mean ? Are you spying,
cousin ? ?
? I wanted to know what was going on,? said
Jerry boldly. ?It is obvious we are going to attack
soon.?
? How dare you ignore a German officer?s
orders! ? stormed Grosmann furiously. Lieb
silenced him with an impatient gesture.


?You do not help our trust in you by this sort
of thing, cousin,? he said sharply. ? However, no
great harm has been done this time. As you are so
anxious to push into our activities, however, you
shall have your chance. You shall have charge of the
other wireless for part of the watch to-night.?
? Are you mad, Lieb ? ? began Grosmann
excitedly. ? True ?
? No, I?m quite sane,? retorted the lieutenant
coolly. ? Did you not express belief in this young
man ? Very well, then. An all-night watch is too
much for Baumgart; yet a full watch is needed.
Cousin Jerry can show us his zeal by taking signals
for us. He can hear nothing to do us harm; he
may report something of use. And the trarismitter
will he disconnected so as to offer him no painful temp-
tations ! ?
? Very well,? agreed Grosmann rather grudgingly.
?In that case, perhaps, he may do it. But he has no
right to disobey strict orders. No doubt it is the lax
British discipline to blame ; but what he has done
once he may do again.?
? Exactly! ? said Lieb dryly. ? And if he is in
the wireless cabin, we can be sure just where he is all
the time?
For a moment Grosmann looked puzzled, then
he burst into a hearty laugh. ? Good for you,
Lieb ! ? he chuckled, and glanced at the speaking-
tubes, one of which doubtless led to the wireless
cabin. ?Yes, that is, I see, the best place for him.?
? That will do,? said Lieb, with a nod to Jerry.
208


COMING EVENTS
?You will take up duty at eight o?clock. Listen on
a 600-metre wave length, and report all signals,
especially those from Allied ships. Now go below.??
With doubt in his heart and dismay at those
words ? the transmitter will be disconnected,? Jerry
managed, somehow, to keep an unruffled counte-
nance. ?Thankyou, sir,? he said, and saluted. Then
he went on into the main compartment, wondering
whether he would be able to discover those missing
connections.


CHAPTER XVII
DESPERATE MEASURES
JERRY had little appetite for tea that night, and
left the table at the earliest possible moment.
Lieb and Grosmann were late in coming to the
meal, and Jerry was able to give Faversham and Peter
a hasty account of what had happened in the conning
tower. Faversham was disturbed at the fact that
the transmitting apparatus was to be disconnected.
? It would have been a heaven-sent opportunity,?
he growled with ruffled brow. ? How of this set
in the conning tower ? Could it transmit ? ?
? I was not able to see,? replied Jerry. ? But if
they are putting the other set out of action it surely
can.?
?We must consider the matter,? remarked
Faversham. ?It has enormously complicated the
difficulty.?
? That conning tower set is the key to the
attacks, I feel sure,? said Jerry. ? I want to know
what that seaman meant by ? fool ships.? ?
? Then you had better get to your cabin and
hear all you can to-night,? advised Faversham.
? The men will be excited and less cautious. A
210


careless remark may tell us everything. Time is
short if we are to make good. To-night is obviously
the zero hour.? *
The seamen were crowded into the narrow mess-
room between the navigating compartment and
engine-room, and they greeted Jerry as he passed
through with a chorus of shouts and jokes. Harris
was sitting in the midst of them looking unusually
subdued, and it was evident some of them were
dividing their time in chaffing him and trying to
cheer him up. As he could not understand a word
they said, the result was not very successful. Reach-
ing the sleeping compartment, Jerry slipped off his
boots and sw r ung himself, fully dressed, into his bunk.
He could have half an hour?s rest before going on
this unwelcome watch, and he would be less likely
to be noticed in the bunk. A few minutes later
Harris entered and glanced round for the boy.
? ?Alio ! Turned in ? ? he queried. ? Well, I
don?t know as what it ain?t a good idea. Yer can
see for yerself nar as what I said were right, can?t
yer ? ? '
? Yes, there is certainly something afoot to-
night,? replied Jerry.
? It?s a hattack, that?s what it is,? said Harris.
? They seemed to be trying to cheer you up,?
remarked Jerry, concealing a smile.
Harris rubbed his shoulder ruefully. ?If I?d
a-known whether they was just pokin? fun at me
or tryin? to buck me up, I?d a-known whether to
clean ?em up or just put up wiv it. As it is, I?ve


got a sore shoulder wiv their blinkin? slaps, an? no
satisfaction.?
As the Cockney finished speaking Peter entered
the compartment, and Harris looked rather uncom-
fortable. He glanced uneasily from the one boy to
the other, and then apparently determined to make
another attempt to heal the breach.
? I was saying to young Jerry as ?ow them
Germans is kicking up a rar to-night,? he said to
Peter.
The boy shrugged his shoulders. With the
critical moment so near he was disinclined to keep
up the pretence of disagreement, yet he could not
ruin everything now by an incautious remark. He
wished Harris miles away.
? Meself, I don?t cotton to this ?ere fightin? shut
up in a iron box like this,? continued Harris. ?If
fings go wTong it isn?t only them like what will be
draraned like rats, it?s us too. ?Ave you thought o?
that ? An? if they go right, from their idea o? fings,
I mean ?well, then our chaps on the ships gets
draraned. It?s a hawkward position.?
A loud roar of laughter and a clatter of plates
sounded from the inner cabin as Harris spoke.
? Sounds as if they have finished tea,? said Jerry.
? Well, I ain?t waitin? for no more slaps,? said
Harris emphatically. ? I?ll come back when they
?ave gorn.?
? Don?t bother,? said Peter.
Harris stared at the boy?s back. ? And it ain?t
your company I?m cornin? for neither, Peter ?Arvey,?
212


he said. ? You?re like a bear wiv a sore ?ead.? And
having, as he considered, delivered a crushing reply,
he dived through the door to the after torpedo
chamber.
? I do not think they will let him stay in there
to-night,? remarked Jerry. ? They will probably
put him in here.?
? It is a pity Faversham would not let him into
the scheme even now,? said Peter. ?Heis a queer
bird, but his heart is right.?
? There is a lot of good in Harris,? replied Jerry.
? He has had very little chance in life, and his ideas
are on queer lines, but if it came to a pinch I would
trust my life to him. He makes out he is timid,
but look at the way he stood by me in defiance of
you all.?
? How are you feeling ? ? asked Peter abruptly.
? I?m as nervous as a cat.?
? I think my nerves are tired of acting now,?
laughed Jerry. ? I feel relieved that we shall be able
really to do something.?
? Here come the mob,? exclaimed Peter, as an
increase of the voices announced the opening of the
connecting door.
? Then I?m keeping as quiet as possible till I
have to go on watch,? said Jerry. He sank back
into his bunk, with only his forehead and eyes above
the bunkboard.
The Germans came swarming into the compart-
ment just as Peter hastily followed his chum?s
example.


? The rats feel they are in the trap ! ? laughed
one man, with a motion of his hand towards the top
bunks.
L/ w
Peter could not understand the words, and Jerry
pretended ignorance, but the laughter that followed,
and the nods and gestures accompanying it, made it
impossible for them to pretend that they did not
know they were objects of mockery.
? You won?t laugh, you blighters, when the depth
charges begin dropping around you! ? snapped
Peter.
Although they did not know what he had said,
the Germans greeted the retort with uproarious
laughter, and they redoubled their taunts ; coming
over to the bunk to shout new jokes up at the boy.
Peter was pink to the ears, although Jerry was
only grinning to himself. He realized that it was
merely the nervous effect of imminent action which
caused the extravagant mirth of the seamen. Peter
had turned his back on the teasing group, and the
arrival of Under-officer Gunstein set them bustling
to prepare for the night?s stations. They took from
their lockers suits of leather, which they proceeded
to don with all speed while Gunstein bullied and
blustered to urge them on. It was obvious that they
were to sleep at battle stations that night, and Jerry
thrilled with anticipation.
In a few minutes the cabin was empty again
except for the boys; but the second relay of men
were at tea, and it was to be expected that they
would soon come in for their leather suits. Peter
214


lost no time in slipping off his jacket and getting
properly between the blankets. He was not un-
dressing any further, with the doubtful prospects
of the night before him.
Less than twenty minutes later the next batch
of seamen came bustling in. These ignored the
boys as they slipped into their suits, but talked
quickly amongst themselves, and Jerry listened
eagerly. He gathered that the convoy they were
approaching was apparently from Cape Town, and
there seemed an idea that other vessels had put out
from Freetown, Sierra Leone, to join it. At any
rate, the men were all convinced it was a big convoy,
and that they would be able to do great damage to it.
Some one mentioned ? fool ships,? and at the words
Jerry started, and fairly tingled with his excited
efforts to hear more. There was such a confusion
of talk, however, that he could get nothing further.
He wanted to shout out to demand what was meant;
or to beg the men not to hurry back to their posts,
but to stay and talk longer. In a few minutes,
however, they began to go off in twos and threes
until only an unusually leisurely pair was left.
Even they were almost prepared when in through
the door came Schmidt, chewing the last of his tea
as he hurried over to his locker.
? They are keeping you to it, Heinrich! ?
laughed one of the seamen.
? Oh, well, he has an easy time except on such
occasions as this,? chimed in the other man. ? I
would change my job with him any day.? He


began to move towards the door, but his companion
still lingered.
? Any special news, Heinrich ? ? he asked insinu-
atingly.
Schmidt was searching hurriedly in his locker
for a handkerchief. He had been developing a
cold during the last few days, and was not look-
ing too well with the extra duty he was having
to do.
? I am not allowed to talk news,? he replied
curtly.
? Come along, Adolf,? called the man at the
door. ? You will get nothing from that oyster.?
? Ach I Because he himself knows nothing,?
was the spiteful agreement. ?He gets nothing but
code signals anyway.?
Schmidt?s only reply was a hearty sneeze into
the depths of the capacious handkerchief which he
had at last discovered. Grumbling to themselves
the two men went off, leaving Schmidt rummaging
for other handkerchiefs, which he disposed in con-
venient places about his person, evidently in antici-
pation of a bad night.
Jerry lay perfectly still throughout the discussion,
and once when Peter had turned his head, Jerry had
given him a sign warning him to keep still. From
the words of the seamen it was plain that Schmidt
was in a trusted position on board the U boat.
The boy was debating with himself the possibility
of persuading Schmidt to divulge some of his
knowledge, when the clang of the connecting door
216


and the tread of heavy boots announced the approach
of some one from the main compartment. An officer,
or under-officer, probably, thought Jerry, coming
to see all was in order in this part of the vessel.
Schmidt was now taking out his leather suit and
shaking it out. He glanced up as the steps reached
the compartment, and Jerry craned over to look
too. In the entrance stood Commander Faversham.
Schmidt looked mildly surprised, but resumed his
attention to the leather suit, the straps of which he
loosened a little. Faversham?s eyes roved quickly
over the whole compartment, passed over the two
boys in the bunks, and rested for a few seconds on
the German operator. At the moment Schmidt
was seized with another fit of sneezing, and Faver-
sham seemed interested in the outburst. Peter lay
still, with his eyes questioningly on the commander;
but Jerry threw aside the blankets and swung his
legs over the bunkboard.
Faversham stepped into the cabin.
?You are aware that we shall be in action to-
night ? ? he asked, in a voice wffiich implied that they
should know even if they did not.
Without waiting for a reply he turned to Schmidt.
?You are one of the wireless operators, are you
not ? ? he demanded, in a voice aggressively sug-
gestive that Schmidt had better answer smartly or
it would be the worse for him.
The rigidly disciplined seaman stiffened to
attention at the tone to which he was so accustomed,
sir, he replied promptly. ? Special service
(5,744) 15 217


operator.? The words came tumbling out with the
automatic precision of a routine reply.
?Ha ! And at what time do you expect to
engage ? ? demanded Faversham sharply.
?At one ...? Like a hypnotized rabbit the
operator was quite at the mercy of this paralysing
officer, and he had actually begun his reply when,
unfortunately, Peter, in his eagerness to hear, threw
back his bedclothes and sat up. Instantly Schmidt
checked himself. His eyes shot up to the two lads
in the bunks, and for a moment he seemed about to
burst out angrily. But so deeply was the fear of
officer?s rank engrained in him that as he looked
at Faversham again he regained his self-control.
? I cannot answer you that, Herr,? he said.
Faversham?s pale eyes glared at him, making
Schmidt anything but comfortable. He fumbled
with his overall, and shook it out preparatory to
thrusting his legs into it.
? Are you not due back at your post ? ? barked
Faversham next.
Schmidt had evidently decided that this English
officer was taking too much on himself. He paused
to indulge in another series of sneezes, and then
replied resentfully through the folds of his handker-
chief, ? I am not allowed to answer questions, sir.?
To emphasise his reply he deliberately turned his
back on Faversham, and thrust one leg into the
overalls.
A swift and remarkable change immediately
came over Faversham. He stepped to the door and
218


listened. All was quiet; the crew were at their
posts, and the iron doors shut between compartments.
Jerry gasped slightly, for as the commander turned,
the boy saw that he grasped an automatic pistol.
For a few moments the muzzle turned towards
Schmidt, and Jerry felt almost suffocated with the
nervous beating of the blood in his throat. It was
painful waiting for the report; his brain was clamour-
ing against the uselessness of this mad attack. But
Faversham did not fire. Instead, he suddenly re-
versed the pistol, grasping it by the barrel. Then
like a monstrous cat he leaped across the cabin.
His huge left hand clasped Schmidt across the
mouth, smothering his cry. The hand holding the
pistol was already aloft, and down crashed the
weapon on the operator?s skull just above the ear.
Not even a groan came through the commander?s
iron grip. Schmidt sagged over sideways. Again
the pistol rose and fell, and the commander bent
swiftly as the body slid to the floor.
Peter was the first of the boys out of his bunk.
Like a flash he had joined the commander beside
the fallen Schmidt, and was bending equally eagerly
to inspect the limp figure.
? He?s fixed ! ? he exclaimed, with a rising note
of hysteria in his voice. ? Now, what do we do ? ?
Jerry?s fingers shook so that he could scarcely
grasp the bunkhead to scramble out, and his knees
felt weak and unreliable when he dropped to the
floor. His first move was to the door to make sure
no one was coming. Then he turned back to the


little group by the bunks, and he wondered if his
face was as white as Peter?s. It had all happened
so quickly, yet he felt that he had been looking for
hours at that crumpled heap on the floor. Surely
some one would be coming to look for Schmidt ?
Faversham bent down and jerked the leather suit
from beneath the body. He threw it over to Jerry.
? Put that on quickly,? he snapped. ? And wipe
that scared look off your face. There is no room for
squeamishness in this affair. You will want all your
courage to-night to warn that convoy.?
? Warn ?the convoy ? ? gasped Jerry. He had
caught the suit mechanically, and now stood with
it in his hands gazing vacantly at the commander.
Faversham reached his side in one stride. He
put his big hand on the boy?s shoulder and looked
him in the face.
? My son, you are young, but you know what
depends on you to-night. I am putting all our
hopes, and the hopes of saving that convoy, with you.
I am going to ask everything from you to-night, even
to the giving of your life if necessary. But I shall
be with you when the moment comes, and so will your
chum here. It is our lives for the safety of the ships.
More, for the safety of our country itself.?
The colour was coming back to Jerry?s face.
With those steady eyes looking confidently into his,
and with that firm grasp on his shoulder, he knew
that all he had said the commander meant. The
blood began beating through the boy?s veins in a
fierce desire to prove worthy of the trust being
220


reposed in him. Swiftly, unexpectedly, the moment
had come ; and upon his shoulders the whole safety
of that big convoy was thrown.
? Will you explain while I get into these, sir ? ?
he asked quietly. ?It will save time.?
Faversham?s hands dropped to his side again.
His only sign of approval was a brief nod, and some-
thing like a flash of light in those usually angry eyes.
Peter rose from beside Schmidt with a sound like
a sigh, as it struck him that his part was to be a wait-
ing one.
? I suppose this chap goes in Jerry?s bunk, sir ? ? he
asked briskly. ? I?ll fix him while you talk to Jerry.?
Before Faversham could reply the door of the
after torpedo chamber opened noisily. The three
Britishers spun round with clenched fists. Standing
staring at them from the opening was Harris. From
behind him came the harmonized voices of the
German seamen singing a chorus.
For a few seconds the Cockney gaped at them ;
he made as though to step back again as his eyes fell
upon Schmidt?s body, then, changing his mind, he
closed the door behind him and came forward.
? What you doing ?? he demanded. ? What?s
?appened to 'im ? ?
Jerry, feeling he alone truly understood the little
Cockney, hurried to reply before either of the others
should perhaps complicate the situation by un-
diplomatic words. ??We are going to try and warn
the convoy, Harry; I am taking Schmidt?s place.?
? Lummy 1 ? Harris stood gazing down at the


unconscious operator for a while with round eyes.
Then he suddenly came to life. ? ?Ere, ?e ?ad better
go into your bunk, young Jerry. ?E?s a bit con-
spicuourous like. Give us a ?and, Pete.?
Commander Faversham had evidently been taken
aback by the ready way Harris had grasped the
situation and entered into it. He watched in silence
the two swing the limp body into the bunk and
proceed to tuck it into the blankets, then he appeared
to think of something.
? Not in that bunk,? he said quickly. ?In
Harvey?s.?
Mine, sir ? ?
? Yes. Lieb is supposed to go to the wireless
cabin to-night, isn?t he ? ? replied the commander
impatiently. ? You must take his place.?
?Me ? ? Peter could only gape vacantly.
? Come on, young Pete,? said Harris briskly,
and he proceeded to uncover Schmidt preparatory
to moving him again.
? That man has more sense than one would
think,? was the commander?s doubtfully compli-
mentary remark. He turned to Jen*) 7 , who was now
nearly ready. ? You, as Schmidt, are due on watch
in the conning tower in a few minutes,? he began.
? The wireless set there must be, as you said, the
key to the situation. From what that man dropped
it would appear we shall attack about midnight or
I a.m. It is up to you to make the most of your
opportunity ; there will not be another one !
? This man Schmidt had a cold ; you must have
222


a worse one. As you go through the lighted
navigating compartment, hold a handkerchief to
your face and be coughing and sneezing into it.
In that leather suit they will not suspect you?you
are much the same build. The conning tower will
be practically in darkness until we submerge. You
must keep your face away, talk huskily, and complain
that your cold is worse. Speak only when you must;
you have heard how the men address their officers
?imitate them. The excitement of the time will
distract from trifling peculiarities, and, anyway,
Lieb and Grosmann will have plenty else to think
of just now.?
? But the set ? ? said Jerry anxiously. ? I
believe it is a strange one. They will see I am
ignorant of it.?
?You will not be asked to transmit for them;
this not being the flagship of the flotilla. The
reception should be easy. If you keep your wits
about you, you should pull through.?
Jerry nodded, though there were little anxious
wrinkles on his brow. ? There will be difficulties?
wave length, when to listen and what for, and so on
?but I can only meet them as they arise, and pray
for luck. I?ll go through with it.?
? Good man, Jerry ! ? murmured Peter, with a
little catch in his voice. ? I wish I could be with
you, boy.?
Faversham glanced at his watch. ? Time is up,
and you don?t know all I want yet. If you can
possibly discover some clue to their secret, take all


risks to understand it. Whether you succeed or fail,
watch the clock till midnight.
? At the stroke of twelve I shall collect Harvey
and enter the navigating compartment. Before they
know what we are intending, we shall rush the ladder.
When you hear us, switch on the transmitter. I
will open fire on the officers. At once you must
send out a signal, warning the convoy of the nearness
of this flotilla. If you have time send any other
information you have, as fast as the key will work.
Think of those ships out there, lad, and ignore
everything else. Better be shot warning them than
they be caught.?
? Lummy ! ? began Harris; but the clang of the
door to the navigating compartment stopped him.
? Schmidt! Schmidt! Lieher Gott im Himmel !
When do you think of coming ? ?
The thud of Under-officer Gunstein?s boots
accompanied his angry voice. Faversham thrust
out a big hand and gripped Jerry?s fingers in a
hearty grasp. Peter hurried forward to do the
same, but Faversham?s arm swept him back against
the bunk just as the under-officer appeared in the
doorway. Like lightning Jerry had snatched out
his handkerchief and buried his face in it in a
mighty sneeze.
? What are you doing ? ? snapped the under-
officer fiercely. ? Hobnobbing with these Eng-
landers at a time like this ! ?
? I have a dreadful cold,? replied Jerry huskily
in German. ? They have given me some lozenges.?
224


? Lozenges ? Poison, more likely ! Be off with
you.?
With an air of chastened humility Jerry hurried
out of the compartment. It was with a sinking at
his heart that Peter heard his chum?s footsteps die
away. Gunstein glared suspiciously at them for a
moment, but meeting Faversham?s fixed gaze he
changed his mind about abusing them, and with a
growled oath he swung round and returned to the
navigating compartment.
Faversham remained motionless till the clang
of the door rang through the alleyway. ? Now,?
he said briskly, ? you, Harris, bind and gag that
operator in case he comes to. You can then sit in
the bunk as though chatting with him, but really
to keep an eye on him. Harvey, you must come
to the wireless cabin in Lieb?s place before something
prevents you.?
? What shall I do when you attacks, sir ? ? asked
Harris.
? Come too, or stay here. If you come you will
be shot.?
?Lummy!? said Harris thoughtfully. ?Still,
as fur as I can see, it?s got to come, sir, ain?t it ?
Yus, I?ll be wiv yer. Now about this cove .. .?
He turned to attend to Schmidt.


CHAPTER XVIII
ZERO HOUR
IT was with an overpowering feeling that his mad
effort was foredoomed to failure that Jerry
hurried through the alleyway. He pushed open
the door to the navigating compartment, and gave
a little gulp as he stepped through. He needed
both hands to the door, and although he turned his
back on the man at the controls while he reclosed
the door, he managed to snatch an anxious glance
round the compartment. Fortunately the officer
was addressing himself to a man at one of the
elevating planes, and the rest were intent on the
dials before them.
The door closed, Jerry turned and strode towards
the ladder. He pressed his handkerchief to his nose
and coughed vigorously. The officer glanced round
but took no further notice of him, and with a
tingling of returning confidence Jerry reached the
foot of the ladder. Here he was faced with a diffi-
culty. He could scarcely climb with the handkerchief
pressed to his face ; it would be both awkward and
unnatural. At this inconvenient moment the steers-
man glanced up. Jerry managed a tremendous
226


sneeze and paused to splutter into his handkerchief.
The steersman grinned ; appeared about to speak,
but dropped his eyes to the compass again without
comment.
At once Jerry thrust the handkerchief into his
pocket and began to climb briskly up the rungs.
Only his back was now visible from below, and
the undistinctive folds of the leather suit made an
excellent disguise. But ahead there lay the more
certain inspection of the men in the conning tower,
and it would be more than suspicious to hold a
handkerchief to his face the whole time. It was
with a return of hope that he saw?as Commander
Faversham had foretold?that there was little light
in the conning tower.
Jerry kept his head down as much as possible
as he scrambled to the deck above. As soon as he
could he drew out the invaluable handkerchief and
produced another sneezing effect. He had a ter-
rifying impression that the sound was absurdly
artificial, and that it had immediately betrayed him.
However, he determined to settle the matter quickly,
and he lifted his head to look calmly round while
blowing his nose noisily.
The conning tower was empty except for Baum-
gart, who sat on a swivel seat in front of the wireless
set. A faint green light came from the upper part
of the cabinet, otherwise the whole tower was in
darkness. In spite of the ill-tempered growl which
came from the operator, Jerry felt immensely relieved.
? Did you think I wished to remain here all


night ? ? demanded Baumgart. ? You were due
five minutes ago.?
? Sorry. This wretched cold has become worse,?
mumbled Jerry.
Baumgart grunted as he took off the phones and
vacated the stool. ?It has become worse very
quickly then,? he retorted sourly. ? There is
nothing doing just now; but the herr officers are
eager, and come down every few minutes. They
are not pleased that you were late to relieve.?
? I saw also to that English boy who is in the
wireless cabin,? said Jerry.
? Ach ! that will save me something then. I
will not bother with him, but will turn in and relieve
him at midnight. I can do with a rest.?
Jerry thought it best to remain silent, and kept
his head averted as much as possible. Baumgart
was not inclined to linger, however. With a curt
? Gute Nacht ,? he climbed out of sight down the
ladder.
With a cautious glance first towards the hatch
above, through which at intervals came the low
guttural tones of the two officers, Jerry set to work
to study his position. The wireless set, contained
in a narrow cabinet about four feet tall, was placed
near an angle of the fore part of the conning tower.
This was fortunate, as Jerry was able to sit with his
head averted from any one approaching either from
the navigating compartment ladder or the bridge.
The front of the cabinet was let down to form a
small sloping desk, on which rested a pad of dark
228


green paper. The only light came from within the
cabinet itself, and it shone through a narrow strip
of green cloth so arranged that the rays fell on the
desk alone, and there was little risk of any light
being seen by any one outside the submarine.
Eager to understand quickly the manipulation
of the set, Jerry ran his eyes over the controls, taking
those fastened to the desk flap first. To the right
was a small transmitting key, and, just beyond it,
was a two-way switch which at the moment was
against the contacts marked ? EMPF,? the open
contacts being labelled ? SEND.?
Good ! When the time came to transmit he
would know the change-over ; so far all was simple
and straightforward. Three calibrated knobs pro-
jecting from an ebonite panel below the green strip
were evidently the tuning controls. Jerry con-
sidered them thoughtfully for a few moments,
trying to estimate the wave length at which they
were set. The centre one bothered him : it was
larger than the others, and, instead of the circle of
contact buttons, it had a pointer which was set
exactly over a vertical white line ruled on the panel.
Tentatively he turned one and then another of the
knobs, but all was silent in the phones. He aban-
doned the effort after a time, returning the indicators
to their original positions.
There were a few other controls to examine.
A tumbler switch on the left plunged the cabinet
in darkness when he pressed it over, and there was
a click in the phones. Hurriedly Jerry switched


it on again. Evidently, as he had suspected, the
detectors were Fleming valves. The glow on the
green screen caught his attention. There were
three centres of light discernible. The boy racked
his brains for what he had heard about valves.
Most of his experience had been with the magnetic
detectors. Wireless must have made great strides
during the war, but so much was kept secret to
give the war vessels an advantage. No doubt the
Germans had progressed amazingly too. He had
never heard of more than one valve being in use
at one time. Perhaps there was a way of using
them to reinforce one another; they might even
be so delicate that electrical movements on a ship
could be heard. Was that the secret ? It sounded
absurd, and Jerry realized how he was groping in
the dark for the solution of this mystery. He
decided to investigate further, and examined the
green screen.
Yes, it was hinged and could readily be raised.
With another cautious glance at the hatchway Jerry
again switched off the lights. Swiftly raising the
screen, he groped in the interior of the set in the
darkness. His fingers touched an electric globe,
moved on to another and another. All were hot.
They were not needed for illumination, therefore
they must all be playing a part in the working of
the set. Leaving the valves, Jerry groped carefully
around the narrow space beneath the detectors.
His fingers touched a small round knob. That
would be the spark gap ; but where was the other
230


electrode ? It should have been only a few milli-
metres away. A hasty investigation discovered it,
but it was several inches from its companion. This
was getting altogether beyond Jerry. Suddenly the
scrape of a boot on the bridge ladder startled him.
With a little gulp of dismay he hurriedly pulled
down the screen and switched on the valves. Some
one walked across to stand beside him. He dared
not look to see who it was, but busied himself with
securing the clips of the screen, knowing that he
must have been seen to switch on the lights.
? What are you doing ? ? it was Grosmann?s
harsh voice which asked the question.
Jerry fell back on the refuge of his handkerchief
once more. ? One of the valves was flickering,
Herr Kommandant,? he replied huskily, and with a
panicky fear that his German would fail him on
some vital word. ? I had to adjust it.?
?You should keep your apparatus in better
order,? growled Grosmann. ? This is not the time
for adjustments.?
?Yes, Herr Kommandant,? replied Jerry meekly.
?You have had no further signals from the
decoy ? ?
Jerry?s heart leaped sharply at the significant
words. He could hardly manage to reply calmly,
? No, Herr Kommandant.?
Why are you wheezing and croaking so ? ?
demanded Grosmann testily. ?If you are a con-
firmed invalid you have no business in the U boats.
Is that English boy on watch below ? ?


? Yes, Herr Kommandant.?
To satisfy himself Grosmann walked over to
the voice-pipe. ? Hallo ! ? he called. ? Are you
there, Lieb ? ?
A moment?s pause and Peter?s voice came clearly
from the pipes. ? Yes, sir. I?m here.?
Jerry?s heart was in his mouth. He could have
picked that voice among a million. But apparently
to Grosmann one English voice was like another.
? Have you anything to report ? ? he demanded.
? Only a submarine warning from Poldhu, sir,
replied Peter calmly.
Jerry smiled. His chum w?as bluffing splendidly.
It was doubtful if Peter could have read the signal
if he had heard one, but he had picked up enough
wireless talk to speak naturally and of likely signals.
? Very well,? grunted Grosmann. ? Baumgart
will relieve you at midnight.?
? Will he, sir ? ? inquired Peter innocently, and
Jerry choked in an effort to stop his laugh. Even
in these critical circumstances Peter could not
refrain from pulling Grosmann?s leg. Little did
that officer dream of the type of ? relief ? that was
planned !
Grosmann came tramping back, and Jerry hoped
his ordeal was over for the time ; but Grosmann
paused beside him. ? Give me the signal list,? he
commanded.
For one terrible moment Jerry hesitated. His
brain groped frantically for the probable location of
the required list. Ah 1 There was a paper in a flat
232


pocket at the left of the desk. He almost snatched
it from its place. It proved to be a small pad or
booklet stapled on the left-hand margin, and as
he passed it across, Jerry managed to see something
of its nature. Printed on dark green paper like the
message forms before him, it consisted of columns
of letter-groups opposite their interpretations in
sentences. Why had he not noticed it before ? It
probably contained the very clue for which he was
searching, and perhaps now Grosmann would take
it away. Jerry stole a sideways glance at the
flotille-kommandant. Grosmann was bending down
to get as much light as was available on the list,
and he was comparing it with a message form in his
hand, frowning. At last he snorted irritably.
?You had better be careful of your signals in
future,? he said roughly. ? Baumgart took a signal,
and it is not quite correct. Listen carefully next
time, or it will go hardly with you.?
He threw the code list across in front of the boy,
and turned to climb back to the bridge.
Remember what I have said ?and answer when
I speak to you.?
? Yes, Herr Kommandant. I will be careful,?
replied Jerry huskily. Mentally he was abusing
Grosmann as a bully for scolding a man for another?s
faults. However, it was a relief that the officer had
gone, and without noticing that there was anything
wrong. For once Jerry thanked his lucky stars for
his fair hair and command of the German language.
Next moment he started. A loud buzz had come


in the telephones, and Jerry snatched up the pencil,
prepared to take down a signal. But it was only an
atmospheric, of the type known as a ? growler.?
It was followed almost immediately by the crackle
which announces lightning not very far away.
?By Jove ! That was loud,? thought Jerry.
? Some one is catching it. Hope it does not come
when I have a signal to read. I?m not too good when
static is interfering with sigs.?
He stared towards the glass outlooks of the
conning tower for some sign of lightning, and he
wondered whether to feel glad that the threatened
convoy might be given a chance to escape in a storm,
or sorry that his own plans might thereby be sent
astray. There was unbroken darkness outside the
glass, however, and he could detect no unusual
heaving of the boat which should herald bad weather.
Another series of static crackles rang in the phones ;
fainter this time, but fairly continuous.
? Of course ! ? he exclaimed with sudden illu-
mination. ?It is these valves making the X?s so
loud. These bounders have found a way of increas-
ing signal strength immensely?not that a valve
isn?t a sensitive detector anyway.?
Once more he twisted the tuning switches and
made a discovery. As he turned the larger central
knob left or right, the atmospherics died away or
increased. ?An X eliminator,? he exclaimed in
admiration. ?By Jove ! they have got things to
a fine pitch ! ? For a time the disturbances con-
tinued spasmodically at different strengths, then
234


they stopped, and for a long time he sat staring at
the set and listening. Above, on the bridge, the
occasional tread of a sea-boot made him start, but
on the whole the only sounds came from the navigat-
ing compartment below. Jerry wondered how Peter
was feeling, and whether Commander Faversham
was waiting for the zero hour to strike. That
made him glance anxiously at the clock set above the
wireless cabinet. To his surprise he saw that he
had been in the conning tower over two hours.
His meditations were interrupted by Grosmann?s
voice coming from above. ? Have you had no
signals yet, Schmidt ? ?
? None, Herr Kommandant,? replied Jerry with-
out turning his head.
? Donnerwetter ! What is wrong ? ? Grosmann
was evidently addressing Lieb this time. ? The
fools should be giving us location every hour, and
there has been none since eight.?
? Has the flagship not signalled, Schmidt ? ?
demanded Lieb.
? No, Herr Captain.? Jerry sat staring uneasily
at the cabinet. Somehow he had managed to miss
the signals, that was plain ; and the officers were
becoming dangerously restless in consequence.
? Something has gone wrong,? said Grosmann.
?We must be alert for danger.?
? I shall give them till midnight,? replied Lieb.
? If there is nothing by then, I shall take the
responsibility of signalling myself.?
Jerry sighed with relief as the officers moved


away from the hatch again. If they waited till
midnight he would yet carry his work through.
The green paper of the signal list caught his eye,
and he scolded himself for having left it so long
unexamined. He picked it up hurriedly, and then
panicked at a sound from above. Was he going to
be interrupted again ? No, the noise ceased. With
a stealthy glance to assure himself that he was not
observed, Jerry bent his head over the list.
A heavy lead strip was fastened at the back, and
Jerry laid the list on the table for easier handling.
The signal groups were short, those on the first
page consisting of only two letters each. There
were queer signs amongst them too : stars and
paragraph marks and other printer?s signs for which
he knew there were no signals allotted in the inter-
national code. With a nod of satisfaction Jerry
recalled the queer message which Jameson had been
taking to the captain when he was killed. Of
course this was going to make it awkward for him
when the signals did start coming in. He glanced
over the sentences for which the signals stood, and
was surprised at their length. A couple of letters
could transmit a whole message, AP, for instance,
meant ? Formation of four lines ahead between
lines between vessels.? At the bottom of the
page was a closely printed list of single letters,
which could be combined with the others to give
distances. Obviously the signals referred to naval
formations, and very exact details could be conveyed
rapidly. Some signals gave latitude and longitude,


course, speed, and other details. One very signi-
ficant signal read, ? My position is in line
ship No ?
Jerry was fairly quivering with excitement as
he read. The use and meaning of this list was
obvious to even the dullest brain, and Jerry was
anything but dull. He saw how easily the position
and formation of a convoy could be signalled, and
any changes notified instantly. An attacking sub-
marine or flotilla could be guided to its prey on
the blackest night, and, provided it had directional
apparatus, the very torpedo aim could be directed
to reach certain vessels with reasonable hope of
success. Perhaps that centre switch was a direction
finder. Then the only thing required to fit his
theory was a known point in the convoy. Jerry
breathed quickly as the full force of this idea came
home to him. A known point. That meant a
ship belonging to the convoy with a fixed station.
What did the signal list say again ? ?My position
is in line , ship No ? Clearly the vessel
that used such a signal was not a roving, scouting
submarine, but one of the merchantmen in the convoy.
Another burst of static distracted Jerry for a
while, and he tried the tuning switches again. It
was strange, he reflected, that nothing came through.
That the apparatus was working the reception of
the atmospherics proved. His mind went back to
the signal list. Was it all a wild piece of imagination
on his part ? Looked at coolly it seemed incredible
that signals could be sent out from the middle of a


convoy without immediate discovery. How was it
done ? Who would send them ? What were these
? decoy ships,? the ? fool ships ? of the German
sailors? conversation ? Were there traitors in the
British merchant ships ? wireless operators who
were selling their country for gold ?
The scrape of boots overhead and voices raised
in angry or anxious tones made Jerry push aside the
book hurriedly. Something had disturbed the
watchers on the bridge. Glancing at the clock Jerry
was startled to see it had turned eleven o?clock. He
had been studying the signal list and considering
its meanings for nearly an hour. The officers had
stopped their discussion abruptly, but were clamber-
ing rapidly down the ladder ; their sea-boots rang
noisily on the conning tower deck. It was Grosmann
who first reached Jerry?s side.
? Where is the signal, Schmidt ? Have you no
signal ? ?
? No, Herr,? stammered Jerry apprehensively.
For a few dreadful seconds there was a dead
silence. Jerry felt the officer?s eyes boring into his
head, and feared that at last he was suspected.
? But there must have been a signal. It was the
due hour five minutes ago. Besides, the flotilla
has submerged. They must have had a signal.?
? What is the meaning of this, Schmidt ? ? de-
manded Lieutenant Lieb?s voice. ?As Herr Gros-
mann says, the other U boats have submerged. If
nothing has gone amiss they will be coming up for
quarter-hourly signals for attack position. How is
238


it you have missed the signal ? We must be within
an hour?s sail.?
Grosmann stamped over to gaze out of the glass
look-outs. ?He is either a fool or a traitor,? he
shouted angrily. ?We had better send a request
for repeat signal. Give me the signal list ?you ! ?
To hand back the list Jerry had to turn right
round. Grosmann was standing close beside the
speaking-tubes leading below, and Jerry tried to
keep their mouthpieces in the way of the angry
officer?s glare as much as possible.
? You have not explained your failure,? persisted
Lieutenant Lieb. ?We may be hazarding the whole
attack by remaining on the surface like this, yet
we cannot submerge without knowing our exact
position.?
? The apparatus went out of gear, Herr Lieu-
tenant,? replied Jerry humbly.
? Again ? ? croaked Grosmann. ?Do you wait
till the critical moment to adjust your gear ? Here,
send this.?
He flung a form in front of the boy with a four-
letter signal scrawled upon it. To his dismay Jerry
saw that it contained one of those queer signs the
signal for which he did not know. How could he
send this thing ?
?Wait a moment,? interrupted Lieb. ? The
quarter-hour signal is due in one minute. We will
see if he gets that first.?
Glancing at the clock, Jerry saw that it was a
minute to 11.15. A silence fell on the conning


tower, broken only by occasional impatient snorts
and fidgetings from Grosmann. It was the longest
minute of Jerry?s life. He bent intently over the
apparatus, moving the tuning dials nervously this
way and that. Another short burst of atmospherics
rang in the phones to mock him; but otherwise
there was silence. The minute hand of the clock
crawled past the quarter hour.
? Well ? ? Lieb?s voice had a metallic hardness
in it now.
? Nothing, Herr,? faltered Jerry. He cast a
despairing glance at the clock. Faversham would be
three-quarters of an hour too late !
? Stand up and look at me,? ordered Lieb
suddenly.
Jerry sat motionless, with drooping head as
though shame-faced. Actually he was searching
frantically for a way out of the danger.
? Stand up and turn round when you are ordered,?
shouted Grosmann furiously. ? Himmel! Do you
add insubordination to your failure ? ?
Jerry put out his hand to the switch on the
desk flap. It was impossible that he could succeed
in sending a signal, yet he was taking the desperate
chance. Before he could even grasp it, Lieb?s hand
fell heavily on the boy?s shoulder.
? Stand ? he began.
He was interrupted by a sudden uproar in the
navigating compartment below. There were shouts,
oaths, a wild yell; then a revolver shot thundered
through the ship. Lieb released the boy?s shoulder
�4o


and sprang towards the hatch in alarm. Jerry,
realizing what it must mean, though at a loss why
it should be happening before time, leaped to his
feet at the same moment as Commander Faversham
scrambled swiftly through the hatchway. He swung
round and dragged Peter after him. There was
a streak of blood across the boy?s forehead, but
his teeth were set fiercely, and he brandished a
heavy spanner. The commander snapped his pistol
through the hatchway, the deafening report being
followed by a scream of pain from below.
? Quick ! Watch them ! ? he bellowed, and
Peter swung his spanner high and stood just clear
of the hatchway. The blood trickled into the
comer of his eyes, but he brushed it impatiently away.
The two officers had scarcely moved, so swiftly
had everything happened, and now they found
themselves staring into the muzzle of Faversham?s
pistol.
? Quick! Hands up ! ? snapped the commander.
An angry cry from above told that the men on
watch on the bridge were coming to the help of
their officers. Jerry caught Faversham?s eye, and
realized that he must act quickly. He flung over
the switch to transmit, and pressed the key for the
?ALLO? signal. The contacts closed, but he did
not send the signal. In place of the vicious snap of
a transmitting spark, there came the long ragged
crackle of an induction coil discharge. Jerry remem-
bered the widely spaced balls. No signal would go
out with such a spark gap. His hand held the key


down as though paralysed. Was there another
switch ? Should he try and close the spark gap ?
There was no time to think. He wildly resumed
his tapping, hoping that by some fortunate chance
the signal would go out.
But the delay had been fatal. The officers had
grasped his intention. He heard an angry cry, and
some one struck him violently on the side of the
head, knocking him from the cabinet. The discharge
of Faversham?s pistol nearly deafened him. A cry
of agony followed, and Grosmann staggered and
fell heavily against the voice-pipes.
Then the whole of the conning tower was
illuminated by a blinding light. It shone through
the look-outs on to Faversham?s face, turning it
strangely ghastly. Above the bridge hatchway it
shone too, wrapping the conning tower in a white
glow. Even as they all stood, dazzled and amazed,
there came a rumbling sound, then a shuddering
explosion which made the whole vessel tremble.
? Shells ! ?
Suddenly the upper part of the conning tower
burst into flame, and there was a fearful explosion.
Jerry was flung, blinded and helpless, against the
side of the tower. Darkness rushed upon him,
broken by thousands of flashing streaks. That was
the last he knew.


CHAPTER XIX
THE S.S. ?SATYR?
A PERSISTENT mutter of guttural voices gradu-
ally roused Jerry, and he was annoyed, for he
had no inclination to wake up. He recognized
vaguely that the voices were German, and he was
satisfied that he was in his bunk in the U 197;
but he did not wish to open his eyes. There was
some disagreeable task he had to do when he did
wake up : he could not be bothered remembering
what it was. Nevertheless he groped for some
reminder of what it was, and a series of pictures
flitted through his mind and began to run together.
Peter, Harris, and himself on the submarine?s
narrow deck ; Grosmann bellowing at Faversham
?no, that was long ago. The German seamen joking
at the tables ; Schmidt taking up his leather suit;
Grosmann demanding something of him (Jerry);
Faversham firing ; a frightful explosion. . . .
With a gasp of sudden fear Jerry forced open his
eyes and tried to sit up. A hand, firm but gentle,
pressed him back again. ?Be calm,? said a voice;
? you are all right. Lie quiet till you are better.?
Jerry sank back weakly obedient; but he was wide
awake and fully alert now. The voice had spoken


soothingly; but he was not soothed, for the words
were spoken in good German. He looked up into
the broad, pleasant face of a big man with fair hair
and blue eyes, who touched his forehead deftly as
he adjusted some cold bandages there.
?Is he awake ? ? asked some one in the back-
ground, who tried to speak quietly but evidently
found it difficult to do so.
?Ja ; more or less. Give me that glass on the
stand. Yes, that one.? Jerry felt his lips moistened
and was grateful, for he was fevered and thirsty.
? What ship is this ?? he asked shakily. ? This
is not ?
? U 197 ? No, it is not,? chuckled the big man.
? But you must lie quiet. The Herr Doctor will
scold me if you are fevered. Now, now ! This is
the steamship Satyr of the British Merchant Ser-
vice ! ?
Jerry opened his eyes wide at this in spite of
the weight which still pressed on his eyelids.
? A British ship ? But ?you ?you speak ?
? Now, now, be calm ! You are on the decoy,
that is all. Don?t fear. We fished you out of the
water, and you will not fall into English hands. Now
try and sleep.?
The cooling liquid ran around his lips again,
and Jerry sucked at it greedily. He heard the big
man say something quickly and quietly, and then
the click of a closing door. After that it all began
to become vague and unreal again.
Jerry closed his eyes, but he fiercely resisted the
244


drift into sleep. He wanted to sort matters out.
Everything was clear now to the moment of the
explosion which dashed his senses from him.
There had been that blazing light?a searchlight
undoubtedly. There was much that needed ex-
plaining. If it was the cruiser escorting the convoy
which had fired on the U 197, how had the German
look-out failed to see her and her charges ? With a
sudden pain Jerry thought of Peter. Was he safe ?
And Faversham and Harris ? Opening his eyes again,
Jerry raised his head to look round the cabin. It
was big and white-painted, with three other bunks
in it as well as the settee on which the attendant sat.
The other bunks looked unoccupied. The boy was
on the point of asking the attendant questions, when
he heard the cabin door reopen and a man?s heavy
tread entering the cabin.
? He is awake, Herr Doctor,? said the attendant
eagerly.
A grunt was the only acknowledgment, and next
moment Jerry was looking into the face of a slightly-
built man in a glossy white uniform. The features
were small and sharp, the eyes keen, and a tiny
moustache adorned the upper lip. The doctor?s
gaze remained fixed on the boy?s face for a few
seconds, then a slim hand touched the bandages,
travelled over the forehead, and then sought Jerry?s
wrist.
?You have come off lightly, my man,? he said,
in quick sharp tones. ? That is well, for these are
not days for idling in bed.?


The words were not what Jerry expected from a
doctor to an injured man; but, after all, he could not
look for very considerate treatment from the enemy.
This thought made him realize that the doctor was
wearing a uniform cap with a familiar badge. His
eyes fixed on it. The badge was a shield having a
blue band at the top studded with stars, while below
was a golden dagger on a red field. The badge of
the London-America Line ! Jerry?s head began to
buzz again as he stared at the badge, with the
inevitable flood of questions rolling through his
brain. This time he was brought to himself by the
sharp tones of the doctor.
? Keep calm now. If my cap badge worries you,
you should know that it only means safety for you.?
? Yes, Herr Doctor,? whispered Jerry meekly.
He was beginning to grasp the whole position,
including their attitude to himself, and he decided
to behave with pliable cautiousness.
? Does your head pain you ? ?
? A little, Herr Doctor.?
? Huh ! It was not a very serious knock. No
fragment of shell hit you, but you were evidently
thrown against something. Do you remember ?
Easily, I mean ; do not attempt to exert yourself.?
? I only remember a burst of flame when ?
when ...? Jerry hesitated; he had been about to
mention Faversham, and was now at a loss to con-
tinue.
? When the shell hit you ? Yes. How did you
get out ? The hatches must have been closed.?
246


? The hatch was open, Herr Doctor. We did
not know the cruiser was near till she put her search-
light on and fired.?
?You did not know ? ? The doctor pursed his
lips and frowned thoughtfully. ? That will do;
you must not talk more now,? he continued. Slip-
ping a clinical thermometer from its case he placed
it between the boy?s lips. ? I will make him up a
sleeping draught,? he said to the attendant. ? Let
him sleep as long as he likes, and to-morrow he
should be able to get up on deck.?
? Yes, Herr Doctor.?
The doctor slipped the thermometer from its
place; but as he bent to read it the door was opened
noisily, and some one entered with heavy and hasty
tread. With a frown the doctor swung round, but
the words of reprimand died on his lips.
? Ach ! There is something wrong, Herr Cap-
tain ? ?
At the words Jerry rolled his head to see the
new-comer. Here was the man who held his fate
in his hands. The captain was well built and every
inch a commander. His face was tanned brick-red
with wind and sun, and his manner was brisk and
assured. He, too, wore the badge of the London-
America Line, and the spray of oak leaves which
marks the British Master Mariner fringed his cap
peak.
? A spy?or worse ! ? was Jerry?s bitter thought.
?Is that man awake ? ? The captain?s firm
voice matched his appearance.


? Yes, Herr Captain ; but he needs a little rest
yet,?
The captain waved a paper slip wfliich he held
in his hand. ?He must answer some questions
now, whether it kills him or not.?
The words were probably not meant literally,
but the captain?s inflexible tone implied that he
would mean it if occasion demanded.
The doctor had taken the paper wonderingly,
glanced at it, and started. ?Is it possible, Herr
Captain ? ?
?It would seem so,? was the dry reply. ? Now
you, my lad, what is your name ? ?
? Lieb, Herr Captain. Gerald Lieb.?
? Lieb ? But is that not your commander?s
name ? ?
? Lieutenant Lieb commanded U 197, Herr
Captain.?
? Exactly! Answer ? yes ? where possible. You are
a wireless operator, are you not ? Special service??
? I ?l ...? Jerry could not yet completely
grasp the fact that he was accepted as a German
seaman. He thought the question referred to his
status on the Chowkidar.
? Come, answer smartly, my man. Your badges
show you were an operator. Special sendee, were
you not ? ?
The doctor made some comment in a low voice.
? Yes, yes,? replied the captain sharply. ? But
he must pull himself together. Now, Lieb ? ?
Jerry understood now; it had come to him
248


suddenly. He had, of course, been wearing Schmidt?s
leather overall, and beneath was the old uniform
coat with its distinctive badges. Then none of the
others could have been saved. But the captain was
looking impatiently for an answer. The boy stifled
the rush of grief at the shocked realization that his
friends had been swept away. He must play his
part now.
? Yes, Herr Captain,? he stammered. ? I was
special service.? (Thank heaven ! He had found
what that meant anyway.)
?You were on duty when the shells struck your
boat ? ?
? Yes, Herr Captain.?
? How did you escape ? ?
? I don?t know, Herr Captain. I must have been
blown through the hatchway.? (He must be careful.
What exactly had he told the doctor ? His head
ached so, it was hard to remember.)
?Do you mean your hatch was open ? After
you had had the submerge signal ? ?
? We did not get the signal, Herr Captain.?
? But it was twice repeated and acknowledged.?
Jerry hesitated. He was getting into deep waters.
Having admitted being on watch, he must now
explain away the missing of the signals. A bold
course suggested itself to him.
? It was the English prisoners, Herr Captain.
They attacked the conning tower.?
An exclamation of astonishment and interest
came from all the men in the cabin, and they moved
(3>m) 17 249


unconsciously nearer. Jerry was preparing his ex-
planation swiftly, and was wary for flaws in his tale.
? What do you mean ? ?
? We had taken an English captain and three
others from a Q boat which we sank, Herr Captain.
These men obtained firearms and rushed the con-
ning tower just as the signals were due. They shot
Herr Grosmann, and the wireless set was put out
of action. Before we could make use of the other,
the cruiser had attacked us.?
? It was not the cruiser, it was a destroyer
flotilla,? snapped the captain. ? This explains how
they picked you out so easily, though your look-out
must have been poor. You will be pleased to hear
that though some of the U boats were undoubtedly
sunk, the U 197 is drifting about in a disabled con-
dition somewhere near where she was caught.?
The gasp Jerry gave was a mixture of amazement,
delight, and doubt. His friends were still alive !
But what chance would he have of communicating
the secret he now held to the British authorities
should the Satyr and the U 197 come together ?
? She ?is safe, Herr Captain ? ? was all he could
say.
The captain had turned to the doctor. ? Her
signals are weak and uncertain, but sufficient for
us to locate her. We must go back for her; we
cannot afford to let her fall into English hands
with our secret on board for all to read,?
? But how can you leave the convoy for such a
purpose, Herr Captain ? ?


The captain laughed harshly. ? I think we shall
develop engine trouble, Doctor. My chief engineer
tells me it is very probable ! ? He laughed again.
? It is a terrible risk, Herr Captain ! ?
The captain was already moving to the door.
? I am here to take risks, Herr Doctor,? he said.
? How is Lieutenant Lieb ? ?
The cabin door closed behind the officers, leaving
Jerry trembling with anxiety. The crew of the
U 197 likely to be picked up by this very ship !
And ?what had the captain asked ? How is Lieu-
tenant Lieb ?


CHAPTER XX
THE SECRET OUT
? TV 7ELL, comrade, you should be satisfied now.
W Himmel! If I had talked to you like that
I should have been shot.?
The boy smiled rather wanly at the good-natured
attendant. ?It has left me more confused than ever,
he said. ? I suppose my aching head makes me
dense; but I wish you would tell me all that really
happened.?
The German stood gazing down at the white
face on the pillow, and the smile faded from his lips.
? Himmel! But you are young for this work.
How the thunder did they send out such a younker ?
Don?t reply. What you need is sleep. There, I
will make you comfortable. Now sleep, like a good
lad ! ?
? What is your name ? ? demanded Jerry sud-
denly.
? Karl Winkelmann. You will call me Karl, of
course.?
? Then, Karl, how can I sleep peacefully with
all this worrying me ? Answer my questions, and
I will then sleep.?


? Tut, tut! Quiet, quiet! ? The seaman?s face
was full of kindly concern, and he pulled out a
large watch and consulted it thoughtfully. ?If I
tell you what you want to know, will you sleep
for me right till morning ? It is now nine o?clock.?
? Are you on watch all night ? ?
? I shall sleep in this bunk here. Now, what
is it ? ?
Jerry closed his eyes to collect his scattered
thoughts. Had he been strong and well he could
have faced matters better, but this concussion?
for that was what it probably was ?though slight,
made every effort difficult. The magnitude of the
responsibility resting on him was weighing him
down. He alone knew of this fleet of merchantmen,
of this British steamship line in British convoys,
and yet enemy vessels manned by enemy crews.
He knew nothing of how it was all managed, how
communication with the submarines was main-
tained ; yet he would need this knowledge to con-
vince the British authorities when he should reach
them. How he should reach them he did not yet
pause to consider. All he thought of was the
British ships all round him, threatened with the
flotillas hurrying to trap them, while he lay here
with the vital knowledge which alone could save the
Allies from strangulation and defeat.
He shivered and opened his eyes again, anxious
to see the light. Karl shook his head heavily.
? It is sleep, not questions, you want,? he said.
He held up a finger, and Jerry noticed the strange


stillness which had fallen. ?It is the engines which
have stopped,? smiled Karl.
? Then ?the captain is?carrying out his plan ? ?
? Yes. Can?t you picture it, hein ? We will be
steering out of line, the ships astern dodging us and
wondering what is wrong. The cruiser will signal
us and then go on with the rest. Ha, ha! You
will soon see your shipmates again. Now take this
medicine and then sleep.?
Rumbling with good-humoured laughter at the
captain?s audacity, Karl sat on the settee. Jerry
lay staring at the green-shaded light. Yes, he could
picture it all, the convoy steaming away into the
night. Then the restarting of the decoy ship?s
engines. The dash back to the drifting submarine.
And ?next ? Was it credible that they would carry
him back to England with the knowledge which
spelt death to their plans and hopes of victory ?
Peter, Faversham, and Harris, too ; supposing they
were picked up alive ? Impossible ! Oh, to reach
the deck and warn, somehow, those great ships
steaming past the traitor vessel without suspicion
of her deadly work !
? Karl! ? The suffering boy?s voice had an
edge to it. ? I ?l can't sleep.?
? Now, now! You must be calm. Hark! The
engines are starting. We are going back for your
comrades. You must not talk, /will talk. Come,
what shall I talk about ? ?
Yes, he must keep himself from getting in a
panic. He would keep the man talking. ? Tell me
254


of your adventures in these decoy ships, Karl.
How did they start ? I?m so fresh to the work that
I know very little.?
Karl chuckled. ? Ach ! I can believe that.
You are but a schoolboy yet. How came you in this
service ? Is the Fatherland failing in man-power ? ?
? Never mind that,? retorted Jerry fretfully.
? Tell me about yourself.?
? Well, what shall I say ? I have had no thrilling
adventures, I assure you. It was nervous work at
first, but we soon found the English authorities easy
to hoodwink.?
? I am sure of that,? laughed Jerry. ? The
English are fools.?
? No, no! ? remonstrated Karl. ? I have a great
respect for the English. They are hard fighters
and worthy foes. It is our High Command that is
the cleverer, that is all. We should fight the English
fleet, though. These air-raids are wrong, they only
make the English fight harder. If we beat their
fleet they would despair.?
? They have so many ships,? argued Jerry. ?Is
not this work better ? ?
? It may win us the war,? agreed Karl, ? but
I sometimes think it is not fair fighting.?
? It demands great courage at any rate,? replied
Jerry diplomatically.
? Prut! It needs nothing.? Karl was obviously
pleased, however. ? Come, I will tell you of it?
you are talking too much. Now, where shall I
start ? ?


The mental strain expressed in Karl?s florid
face made Jerry hasten to his aid.
? How did you come to be in the service ? ?
? Like all the others, of course, because I spoke
English like a native, and had sea experience.?
Seeing that Karl was going to leave the subject
as self-explanatory, Jerry hastened to prompt him.
? Where did you learn all that, Karl ? ?
?On the English ships, of course. Some of us
have been barbers and waiters and clerks in Eng-
land ; but lam a seaman all through. They pride
themselves on their Viking stock, these English ;
but are we not the original of that stock ? Ach,
yes ! lam a bom seaman.?
? Any one can see that, Karl,? smiled Jerry
mischievously. ? So, of course, all was ready when
the war broke out. What organization ! ?
? What do you ramble about ? Surely you know
better than that ? Ach ! we wish it had been so ;
many a brave fellow would have been spared who
faced a firing-party through trying to join us.?
? All has been kept very secret, Karl,? said
Jerry, a trifle hastily. ? The High Command would
not imperil you by letting even us in the U boats
know much of you.?
? Hein ? That is good policy. Then why
should I talk to you now ? ?
Karl hastened to wipe the look of sudden dismay
from the boy?s face with a roar of laughter. ? Ach !
I teased you then,? he chuckled. ? Well, then,
where shall I start ? There are things I must not
256


talk about. Where did I join ? In Wilhelmshaven,
from the cruiser Berlin. Carefully the commanders
had found which men had been in England, and
spoke the language well. Most came from the navy,
but there were some from the army ?Breun, the
cook, is one of them ?and all of us were questioned,
ach ! so carefully. And quietly, at different times,
we were drafted off, thinking we were meant for
another ship, but we found ourselves in barracks
at Cuxhaven and not allowed to get in touch with
friends, or even the folk in the town. We were
picked men, selected not only for our knowledge
of English. How our hearts swelled when we knew
we were to have the privilege of striking a vital blow
at England !
?At last we knew the secret. I will tell you only
what I did. I was smuggled through Holland with
forged passports and an English seaman?s discharge
book, which had genuine stamps in it but bore my
description and photograph. Ach ! it was cleverly
done. The High Command is perfect in all things
great and small ! From Holland I went to South
America, and at Buenos Ayres I joined a British
ship which was short-handed, and thus landed in
England, an English sailor ! ?
Jerry?s lips were parted, and his eyes shone as
he drank the story in. Karl thought he saw only
delighted admiration in the boy?s face, and he
laughed again.
?Hein! I am a hero, you are thinking,? he
chuckled. ? There were others who took more


risks. Some, I am told, were taken to America in
the submarine Deutschland , and had to slip ashore
through the docks ; and some landed on the English
coast from the U boats in the night?a very risky
business, and many were caught.?
? I can appreciate that none of you had an easy
task,? responded Jerry.
? But the rest was easy,? boasted Karl airily.
? All was prepared. A rich company had been
formed which bought up big ships from neutral
powers, saying they were doing it to help win the
war. The papers talked much of it, and many
believed in it and praised it, and the rich men who
were forming it and putting all their money into it.
Others said it was only a group of men greedy for
high freights, and should be stopped, for many of its
directors were not prominent men at all. None
suspected that it was German gold which bought
the ships, or that their crews were German seamen
smuggled across to deal the death-blow to Eng-
land. Ach ! You were right. Our High Command
made fools of these English.?
? So, of course, you chaps manned the ships,
and the thing was done ! Marvellously well done
too! ?
?It took time,? explained Karl. ?We had one
ship, and this picked up men from the U boats at
sea, so we quickly had crews for others with less risk.
This our company?the London-America Line they
called it?was very active in evading the wicked
German submarines ! Some of the men were sent
258


THE SECRET OUT
to learn gunnery at the Royal Naval School, to
release the gunners which would otherwise have been
carried. They were, of course, joined to the Royal
Naval Reserve. Ha, ha ! It was a joke. They
learned their work very quickly, those ignorant
seamen ! ?
Jerry joined in the laugh this time ; he was able
to appreciate the daring and ingenuity of the whole
thing, and the way the men entrusted with the work
had carried it through.
? How long ago was all this started, Karl ?? he
asked.
? I have been eighteen months, and I was on
the first ship. I was on the Gargoyle when she made
her spectacular dash across the North Sea and won
such applause in England. We made several such
dashes. They were useful for picking up certain
equipment, and for the fitting of guns. Then public
interest died, and we took up our work like the rest
of the merchant ships and bided our time.?
But ?eighteen months ! ? exclaimed Jerry,
through whose head had been buzzing the possi-
bilities of such enemy freedom of action. ? How
did we not hear of you until lately ? ?
These things are not done by hurrying,?
replied Karl, with a shake of the head. ?We had
to establish ourselves without fear that some irregu-
larity in our books would betray us. Then we
were able to obtain valuable information and pass
it to the High Command ; it was that that brought
the new wireless into use. I do not understand


that part of it, but it will be clear to you. Also,
we gave to the U boats the secret code books as the
Admiralty issued them.?
? Yes, I see you have done a lot,? agreed Jerry
slowly.
? Ach, yes ! And our reward now has been worth
the waiting. Although, as I have said, I sometimes
feel queer when I hear of the merchant ships sinking
through us. We mix with these English, and know
them for brave men and not at all the monsters they
are made out to be.?
? Well, are the Germans the monsters the Allies
make them out to be ? ? laughed Jerry.
?No ; I suppose that is war. I must not be
weak. But it is one thing to fight from a turret
with a blow struck in return, and quite another
with our secret guns behind the deckheads and our
torpedo tubes between the coal bunkers ?
? Good lord ! ? exclaimed Jerry. ? Are you as
thoroughly equipped as that ? ?
? Of course, of course ! ? retorted Karl, with a
stare of surprise at the abysmal ignorance of this
German seaman. ? Did we not have them even
before the Amazon base was fitted ? But, as I was
saying, give me the deck of the Berlin , with ...?
He stopped abruptly, and cocked his head
inquiringly on one side. Jerry, too, was aware of
the change in the ship.
? The engines have stopped again,? they ex
claimed together.
Karl rose, and hurrying over to the door put
260


his head out and listened eagerly. In a moment
he turned to Jerry again. ? I will go and see what
is happening,? he said. ? I shall not be one
moment.?
? Right! ?
Left alone, Jerry divided his thoughts between
the amazing revelations to which he had been
listening and the possible reason for the stopping
of the vessel. He remembered, too, that he must
discover why Lieutenant Lieb, if he were really
aboard, had not betrayed the boy?s nationality.
The only reasonable explanation was that Lieb was
too badly hurt to talk.
Karl came blundering back into the cabin, his
mouth gaping in consternation ; his face scarlet.
? ?A destroyer! ?he gasped. ?A verdammt de-
stroyer ! She has come to guard us from U-boat
attack. She is standing by us. Hein ! What is to
be done now ? ?


CHAPTER XXI
THE ? SATYR ? STRIKES
JERRY?S heart leaped.
? A destroyer ? ? He tried to keep the exul-
tation from his voice. ? What are destroyers
doing here ? ?
? Doing ? Did not they sink your flotilla?the
sneaking, creeping, treacherous vipers! ? (Karl
seemed quite to have forgotten his qualms as to the
strict fairness of the Satyr's activities.) ? They
crept down to Sierra Leone and crawled out in the
darkness to screen the convoy ahead and abeam.
We did not know of them ; we could not warn you.
And now they come here, the crafty beasts, to
prevent us saving our poor fellows from drowning
and starving.? Karl was becoming rather incoherent
in his bitterness.
Jerry was thinking quickly. He understood now
how the destroyers had caught the U boats napping,
and a ray of hope for the safety of the Old Country
lit the darkness of his fears. Of course the sub-
marines would be wary next time; but at least there
was a counter to their activities.
? And the captain has pretended the engines
are still disabled ? ? he remarked thoughtfully.
262


? Yes, yes. But think of your comrades on that
shattered hulk of a U boat. Must we go meekly
on and leave them ? ?
It occurred to Jerry that, once the convoy was
beyond sound of gunfire, the Satyr would have
little difficulty in ridding herself of her unwelcome
attendant, able as she was to attack without warn-
ing. He carefully kept the thought to himself,
however.
? I say, Karl,? the boy said suddenly, ? can?t I
slip on deck and have a peep at this destroyer. I
feel out of things, lying here. Let me get up and
dress.?
Karl, who was becoming more calm, shook his
head heavily. ? The Herr Doctor would kill me.
You are looking much better ; but what good would
it do ? The night is dark and you would see little.?
It s still night, then. I say, Karl, how long
have I been lying here ? ?
Karl considered. ? It was eleven last night when
we heard the guns which sank you. The convoy
split as ordered, and our line went westward, but
soon a recall was signalled. Yes, it was soon after
midnight, when we were almost back into formation,
that one U boat found us after all and torpedoed the
Ayredale. The destroyers were after her at once,
and their searchlights flashed over you and the Herr
Lieutenant. Just after twelve, and it is now ten.
You have been on board twenty-two hours.?
Jerry?s curiosity was all awake again. ? But,
Karl, how came the Herr Lieutenant and I to be


picked up, and none others from the U 197 ? You
have not told me ?
? Stop ! Stop ! With this verdammt destroyer
hindering us, what do these things matter ? ?
Jerry laughed. ? I never thought you could be
so hazed, Karl! You who have come through so
many dangers in the decoy ship service. To think
you should not trust your captain to find a way
from the difficulty ! Why, I saw him for only a
few minutes, and I would put my faith in such a
leader to the bitter end.?
Karl stood staring in astonishment at the reproof
while he slowly grasped its meaning. Gradually
the old amiable smile crept back to his eyes and lips,
and he dropped down on the settee, slapped his
knee, and began to chuckle.
? And I called him a boy ! Wondered why he
was in the U-boat service ! Himmel y lad, you have
taught me a lesson to-night.?
? Then tell me,? said Jerry promptly, ? how
you came to pick me up.?
?You are a cool one, but so very curious,?
chuckled Karl. ? Not that it is strange for you to
be so. Well, I will talk and let the English destroyer
go hang. I told you we saw you in the searchlight;
what more is there ? ?
? But how was I floating ? Where was the
U 197 ? ?
? The U 197 ? Heaven knows ! They will tell
us that when we find them. But you and the Herr
Lieutenant must have been blown out of the boat
264


THE ?SATYR? STRIKES
by shell-fire. When the searchlight swept the sea
ahead of us there was a mass of wreckage across
our bows. The Herr Captain steered to clear it,
but we were so close that it brushed alongside, and
the light had lingered long enough for the bow look-
out to see two figures on it. The Herr Captain
realized that it must be two U-boat men, and he
stopped and lowered a boat. A destroyer came and
swore at us; but by the time she came alongside
you were safely aboard, and the Herr Captain
declared the men we saw were gone when the boat
reached the wreckage. The destroyer commander
called us fools who saw ghosts; but the Herr Captain
only smiled. He had saved two good U-boat men,
and would smuggle them away without the Britishers
knowing.?
? But Lieutenant Lieb ?is he badly hurt ? ?
Karl shook his head sadly. ? Ach !I am sorry,
but yes. His ribs were laid bare?by a shell fragment
probably?and they were driven into the lung as well.
He is unconscious, and I know the Herr Doctor
is concerned about him. He was a brave man to
have saved you while in that state.?
Jerry found his breath come with difficulty as
he thought of the lieutenant?s condition. ? He?
he saved me, you say ? How could he do so when
he was so injured ? ?
? Himmel! Who can say ? Enough that you
were sprawled across part of the wreckage in a
position to which you must have been dragged or
lifted, and he clung to the timber in that awful


state. He was unconscious when he reached our
deck.?
Jerry lay silent. He was thinking about war.
He had been seized suddenly in the jaws of the
monster, and in a short space of time had seen such
different views of the struggle. He had seen the
cold deadly blow in the dark which crushed men like
vermin ; had seen courage, endurance, hatred, the
contest of brave men against brave men. One enemy
would send him ruthlessly to death; and another
would snatch him to life at the cost of his own.
The war had ceased to be a strange and awful
contest between impersonal forces, it was a fight
between men and men. Both sides were much
alike, however differently they might view some
things.
His reverie passed. It was war after all. And
his part now was to warn his countrymen in that
destroyer, and defeat the objects of the Satyr's
captain. How ? First, he must know how the land
lay beyond this cabin.
?For goodness? sake get me something to eat,
Karl,? he said brightly. ? Have I had anything
since you brought me aboard this old barge ? ?
Karl chuckled as he rose. ? Ach, yes ! You
have roused before, but you were dazed and did not
speak. We propped you up and gave you some
broth, but you do not remember it.?
? Nor does my stomach ! ? growled Jerry.
As soon as the door had closed behind the
steward, Jerry flung aside the blankets and swung
266


himself to the floor. He felt dizzy, and held on to
the upper bunk board to steady himself. While
recovering, he inspected the cabin eagerly. On a
hook on one of the bulkheads hung a heavy bridge-
coat, and above it dangled a peaked cap with the
London-America badge. No doubt they belonged
to Karl. So far so good ; but were there any boots
in the cabin. He left the bunk and managed to pull
out the long drawers under the berths. No sign
of his own clothes, and no boots were to be seen.
Karl might take some time to get food at this time
of night; but, on the other hand, he might come back
at any moment.
Time was flying. It would not be very cold on
deck, he would waste no more time. Jerry was
rapidly gaining control of his limbs, and it was the
work of a minute to struggle into the big bridge-coat
and slip on the cap. Then he opened the door and
peered outside. The alleyway was in complete
darkness, and there was no sound of any one moving.
As he stepped out of the cabin, Jerry pulled the door
to behind him so that no gleam of light should bring
an unwelcome investigator. Now, which way should
he go ? Probably he would reach the deck in either
direction, but he wished to find the shortest route
in case he had to return before Karl should discover
his absence. There was nothing for it but to trust
to luck ; he did not even know which was for?ard
and which aft! He turned to the left and hurried
down the alleyway.
Luck was with him. Before he had gone ten


yards he caught his foot against the bottom of a
companionway and stumbled, sprawling forward
on the steps. His leg was bruised, but that was a
small thing ; he had wasted no time. The door at
the top was closed but not fastened, and in another
minute the boy was standing out on the windswept
deck.
The breeze was cold, and it searched out his
thinly clad legs under the bridge-coat. Jerry
shivered, but kept quite still so as not to attract the
attention of any one on watch. The dark alleyway
had sufficiently prepared his eyes, and he was able
at once to take in the general details of the deck.
The Satyr was a large boat, for her deck was wide
and long. The sky was overcast, but lit by a moon
behind the clouds, and the rails and stanchions
stood out black against it. The sea glimmered
faintly, and there was a flash now and again of white
foam on the wave tops. Jerry caught sight of a
long black shadow sliding over the water less than a
quarter of a mile on the beam. His eyes fixed on
it hungrily. It was the destroyer ; there were his
countrymen within hail, and he could not let them
know their danger.
A figure detached itself from the darkness of the
deckhouses and came quickly along the deck towards
the boy. Jerry waited, with nerves tense and ready
for action.
? Who is it ? ? asked a harsh German voice.
? What is doing ? ? countered Jerry.
The man leaned nearer to peer into the boy?s
268


face. With a slight shock Jerry saw that the seaman
carried a rifle in his hands.
? Ach ! It is the little U-boat operator ! ?
exclaimed the German in surprise. ? But should
you not be in your bunk ? ?
? I am sick of my bunk,? growled Jerry. ? I
was suffocating for a breath of fresh air. But what
is doing ? What is the destroyer doing ? ?
The German laughed quietly. ? So that is what
is disturbing your rest! Do not worry. In a few
minutes you will see one of the finest sights of your
life. The captain thinks the convoy beyond hearing
of our gunfire, and at the signal from the bridge we
use our guns. We shall not need to fire long ; see
what an easy target she makes.?
Fear gripped the boy?s heart as he looked across
the sea. Having crossed the stern, the destroyer
was steering abeam of the decoy ship and coming
nearer.
? You are going to sink her ? ? he demanded
sharply.
?Yes, the ? prepare ? has passed round, and at
the most favourable moment down go our screens.
Ach! they have waited long for a chance to shoot,
and now what a good one ! With a point blank
range the first salvo will shatter her. It must , for
the Herr Captain says she must have no chance to
send a wireless message.?
? And ?and ?your rifle ? ?
The seaman shrugged his shoulders callously.
? There must be no survivors.?


Jerry stared at the man in horror. ? But?we
could pick them up ? ?
? Hein ? And have them betray us ? No, it is
unfortunate, but necessary.?
A fierce anger swept all Jerry?s anxieties away.
Quickly his hand slid down the bridge-coat, loosening
the buttons.
? I must get back to my post,? muttered the
seaman. ? She will soon be in position.?
As the man turned away, Jerry flung back the
bridge-coat and dropped it to the deck with a
gesture of disgust and fury. Without a moment?s
hesitation he ran across the deck, sprang on to the
taffrail, and, cupping his hands, sent a desperate
hail across the waters :
? Destroyer ahoy ! This is a raider. She is
opening fire in one minute. Stand away ! ?
From the deck behind him came a shout of
guttural rage. Jerry flung his arms above his head
and swept forward in a dive. As he did so there
was a vivid flash, and the report of a rifle. He
struck the water and deflected outward from the
ship. The effect of his shout he had no means of
knowing, but when he broke the surface all was
dark and quiet. Striking out with a strong sweeping
stroke, Jerry strained his eyes for a glimpse of the
destroyer. Surely the rifle discharge had warned
her that something was amiss ?
C-R-ASH!
For one vivid moment sea and sky were lit by
a dazzling red flash. The jarring report of the guns
270


almost stunned the boy beneath them. The Satyr
had fired.
But with a thrill of excited joy Jerry saw in front
of him an answering blaze light the waters. The
destroyer was ready, and had answered the challenge.
In the single instant of illumination from the guns
the boy saw that the British boat had turned away
at an angle, and the streaming black smoke and
white spray fountaining over her bow told of speedy
dashing through the sea.
Though his own position was extremely critical
between the battling vessels, and rescue doubtful
even if either ship were left afloat in the end, there
was nothing but exultation in Jerry?s heart. He had
foiled the murderous plan of the Satyr's captain.
There would be no shattering of an unsuspecting
vessel now, and no shooting of helpless swimmers.
BOOMP! BOOMP! BOOMP!
Salvo answered salvo. There was the flash of
shells and guns ; smoke and steam streaming across
the sky ; and the sea lit horridly with the angry glare
of high explosive. Deafened and stunned, Jerry
did not try to swim, but floated on the waves. Even
if he could have approached the destroyer she could
not have paused to rescue him, while there was
always the danger from the flying shell fragments.
The destroyer, anyway, had dashed away to pass
astern of the Satyr , where the decoy?s guns could not
properly bear. The liner was steaming to come
round on the other side, and continually changed
course to minimize torpedo risk. Jerry trod water,


as the battle moved away from him, to see as the
waves lifted him just how the fight was going.
Once something fell from the air with a splash in
the water quite close to him.
The light from the guns made an uncertain
illumination full of moving and changing shadows.
The destroyer appeared to be getting badly mauled
about the upper works; but owing to her low build
and his difficult observing position Jerry could not
tell exactly what harm she was suffering. The
Satyr made a much larger target. All her guns were
in action again, and Jerry saw that the destroyer
was making no effort to silence them. She was
concentrating on the water-line amidships, in an
effort to find some vital point or to sink her adversary.
Jerry held his breath and strove to rise higher
out of the water. Was it imagination, or was the
Satyr listing to starboard ? Her stern was towards
him now, and he could almost swear she was no
longer upright. Yes, and she was slowing down.
That white cloud about her funnel must be steam.
Her engines were hit! The destroyer was away on
the far side, but she had turned and was coming
at full speed towards Jerry, sweeping down the whole
length of the enemy and raking her with rapid
gun-fire.
CRASH !
It came with startling suddenness. The uproar
previously had been as nothing to this. One
fountaining eruption of mighty flames from the
centre of the great vessel was followed by an explosion
272


that seemed to shake the very ocean. Jerry dived,
as though by instinct, into the depths of the sea.
Then he came up again, with throbbing ear-drums,
to a world that was dark and silent. The Satyr
was gone.
The darkness did not last for long. The search-
light of the destroyer sprang across the waves even
as Jerry gazed round in awe at the swift and fearful
end of the fight. The destroyer was prowling over
the place where the Satyr had sunk. She was
searching for survivors. Jerry realized his own
precarious position, and he struck out with long,
steady strokes towards the warship. He was still
some distance away, but the destroyer was extending
her circle of search, and showed no signs of abandon-
ing the hunt. Twice the searchlight swept above
the boy while he was hidden in the trough of the
waves; but the third time he was on a big wavetop,
and he flung his arm into the air.
The light flashed past him, but immediately
returned to steady on him. Its dazzling centre
began to grow rapidly. Jerry kept his eyes averted,
but still was almost blinded. At this moment of
certain rescue he thought of Karl. He hoped that
the good-natured fellow had survived that fearful
holocaust. The searchlight leaving him, warned
Jerry that the destroyer was near. He saw the
steep bows shooting towards him. The iron plates
glided past him, slowed, and stopped. An arm
encircled him, and he saw that a seaman had climbed
down a rope to aid him in mounting the side. He


was lifting; other hands grasped him. Uncere-
moniously, but not ungently, he was swung over the
side and laid on the iron deck.
? One ! ? said a voice in honest English. What
a welcome sound was in those tones !
? Only one I ? replied another voice grimly.
Jerry sat up, supporting himself on his hands.
? And Fm not German,? he said. ? I?m a Britisher.?
The lieutenant commanding H.M.S. Blizzard
almost fell backwards in his surprise.


CHAPTER XXII
AT GRIPS
WELL, Pussy, they have picked up your
friends in good order and condition.?
Lieutenant Somerfield came to Jerry
where he lay in a hammock below the bridge of
H.M.S. Blizzard.
The boy sat up so suddenly that he nearly fell
out of the hammock. ? Not U 197 ?? he asked
anxiously.
Somerfield propped himself comfortably against
the bridge. ? The same,? he replied. ? Bengali
lifted them half an hour ago, and is making the
ether hot with her wonderful discoveries. Old
Blake, her commander, will brag no end after this
of how he won the war. The credit is yours, really.?
Jerry smiled. ? I did not know it was won yet,?
he said. ? Things must have moved very suddenly.?
The lieutenant laughed. ?In the meantime I
am keeping you in suspense over your chums.
They?half a mo? ! There?s old Spots. Hey, Spots !
Come and drink in news of more bloodshed ! ?
Spots, otherwise Sub - lieutenant Spottiswood,
strolled casually from midships and regarded his


commander sorrowfully. ? Knowing my hatred of
this disgusting warfare,? ? he drawled, ? why drag
me from peaceful contemplations ? ?
? Cut it,? grinned Somerfield. ? Old Bengali
has picked up the battered sardine tin that Pussy
was in, and has had some fun, it seems.?
Spots evinced mild interest. ? Don?t tell me
bold, bad, boasting Blake has been ill-using the
Fritzes ? ? he said severely.
? Only a little,? conceded Somerfield. ?In
response to our signal he went eyes-out for the
suspected posish, and came on U 197 at the same
time as a perfectly conditioned U boat did the same.
There seems to have been an argument, and naughty
Blake sank the U boat. He has great news. First,
though one is hurt, the three Britishers are alive.?
? Thank heaven ! ? ejaculated Jerry fervently.
? Amen ! ? said Spots, and he meant it.
? Old Faversham, it seems,? continued Somer-
field gravely, ? had taken command of the U 197
in absence of any deck officers. An engineer officer
put on airs, but contracted a bullet in the lungs,
and the crew thereupon unanimously elected
Faversham.?
Jerry exploded into spluttering amusement at
this way of putting it. He could picture Faversham
? persuading ? that German crew at the point of his
pistol!
Spots shook his head sorrowfully. ? I know that
Faversham,? he announced. ? A perfectly brutal
fellow.?


AT GRIPS
? The brutal fellow,? went on Somerfield with a
grin, ? had collared the signal books left lying about
carelessly in the sub, and he induced an operator
to send the message which caused the Satyr to
betray herself.?
?He sent that message ? ? Jerry was dumb-
founded.
? Yes. It was risky; but I suppose he bargained
on being able to tip us afterwards so that we would
slip along and catch any U boats attracted to the
spot. How he failed to do so is not explained.?
? That wireless set was queer,? said Jerry
thoughtfully. ? I don?t know what sort of signal
it sent; it beat me?
? Then it must have been strange ! ? agreed
Spots heartily.
? Oh, I don?t mean that! ? cried Jerry, laughing.
?To get on with my thrilling narrative,? said
Somerfield with gentle insistence. ? Among the
secret signals was one which warned all subs in
these seas to seek certain rendezvous owing to
concerted enemy activity. Faversham took the
liberty of sending that signal.?
Even Spots was affected by this information.
He sat down suddenly on the deck and fanned
himself with his cap. ? Who is this Faversham ? ?
he asked weakly.
Admiral-in-Chief of the Imperial German
Navy,? replied Somerfield serenely. ? There are
three rendezvous, to each of which flotillas of our
ships are now speeding. It is unfortunate we


haven?t a few more down here. Anyway, there is
one of these rendezvous a comfortable day?s steaming
from us, and from certain atmospherics ? (the
lieutenant dwelt on the word) ? we have reason
to believe that several subs are already collecting
there, preparing to go home and tell the Kaiser
about the naughty boy who spoilt their nice games.?
Both officers frowned heavily at Jerry as Somerfield
said the last words.
? But might not they decode our signals and
know all you have received ? ? asked Jerry.
? They might, certainly ; but I don?t think so.?
? Don?t tell me,? said Spots, with a pained
expression in his face, ? that we are to have more
fighting .?
? Fortunately not,? replied Somerfield blandly.
? The flotilla has left the convoy to visit the subs;
but the leader has left it to my discretion to avoid
further action in our present condition.?
He looked along the damaged deck of the Bliz-
zard without apparently noticing Spot?s blank dis-
may. The little vessel was badly scarred by her
night battle. Plates were twisted and torn; the port
4.7 was tilted at a queer angle, and was obviously
useless for the present; two funnels appeared to
have been bitten off, and the others streamed smoke
from unusual places.
Spots had reared himself from the deck with a
howl. ?Do you mean to say that red tape is going
to make you miss the finest scrap of the war ? ?
he yelled.


Somerfield turned back with an air of exaggerated
surprise. ?My dear chap ?
? We ain?t touched in the hull ?hardly,? pro-
ceeded Spots in anguish ; ? and we?ve still got three
guns and a torpedo tube intact, and you talk of not
fighting ! ?
?You have overlooked one very important thing,
Spots,? retorted Somerfield severely.
? Oh, have I ? What is it then ? ?
? Pussy,? replied the lieutenant, pointing to
Jerry, ? has already lost five of his nine lives accord-
ing to our reckoning. Would you endanger the
other four ? ?
At last Spots saw how his leg had been pulled.
He calmed in the twinkling of an eye. ? Perhaps
you are right,? he agreed. ? Though why you
should consider a Hun pussy beats me.?
? Oh, dry up ! ? growled Jerry with a flush.
? I never want to be reminded of that business again
in all my life.?
? That, dear chap,? explained Spots patiently,
?is why we shall do it. It?s a way we have in the
navy.?
? Especially,? added Somerfield, as he began to
mount the bridge, ? when we wish to honour a
particularly brave man.?
Jerry had no reply to the tribute. He knew how
truly the lieutenant meant what he said. They had
taken him thoroughly as one of themselves, these
cheerful, fearless, big-hearted naval men. From
the moment when they had rushed him from the


deck the previous night and had tucked him up in
Spots?s bunk, they had been seeking to make up for
all he had suffered while all the time pretending
callous indifference.
It was at the interview with Somerfield that
morning, at which Spots and the engineer-lieutenant
had been present, that they had given the boy his
nickname of ? Pussy,? in honour of his series of
adventures and his persistent vitality. It was the
radio message following that interview which enabled
the British Admiralty to take action before the Ger-
mans were aware that their schemes had gone awry.
Although Jerry did not know the details till long
afterwards, even while he was lying in his hammock
talking with the officers of the Blizzard , his work
was bearing fruit. Cable and radio had set the
Allied forces to the task of breaking the deadly iron
ring which had closed round them. Warships were
speeding to harry the submarines now deprived of
their supplies. In the ports of America, England,
and South Africa, the London-America boats had
been suddenly seized. One, a member of a convoy,
was quietly separated by the escorting cruiser and
captured before she suspected her danger. The
London offices of the traitor company had been
raided, and valuable information obtained. Full
accounts of the arrangements for the fuel, ammuni-
tion, and food supply of the U boats were found in
the strong rooms. The Faun , which had been
passing stores to the two submarines at the very
moment when the Chowkidar appeared, was seized
280


in Rio ; and a base for repairs which was cunningly-
hidden behind a wreck on one of the Amazonian
islands had been captured and destroyed. Only
one ship?the Nymph ?had escaped. Sailing south-
ward alone she had been warned by wireless, and
somehow evaded a pursuing cruiser.
? But I say, sir,? exclaimed Jerry, as some words
of the lieutenant?s returned to his mind, ? what
did Mr, Somerfield mean by his reference to
atmospherics ? ?
? Didn?t he tell you? Well, you should know!
They seem to have been busy in London, and an
hour or so ago a radio was circulated warning all
ships that the Germans were using a system of
signals which resembled static discharges. The
Bengali confirmed this after examining U 197?s
wireless set.?
? Well, I?m blowed ! ? gasped Jerry. ? Then that
is why that spark gap was so wide. But how on
earth did the signals go out ? There could be no
oscillation.?
? Well, our warrant-telegraphist says that there
must have been an oscillating circuit, but the in-
duction coil spark would be made to break it.
That would give an irregular sound like static. You
see the signal would go out while the spark was
leaping across, but would stop as the spark wavered.?
? Yes, I can see it now,? agreed Jerry. ? That
is why they needed those peculiar signs : to make
a code to suit the signals. And to think I sat and
listened to them that night, and was too dense to
(3,744) 19 281


realize what they were. I was listening for a mys-
terious sort of signal too.?
?It was because they w r ere not mysterious that
you did not notice them,? laughed Spots. ?Any-
way, it is coming to an end now. We bumped a
few the other night; but, oh boy, to-morrow ! ?
Jerry could rest no more in his hammock that
day. They chaffed him and threatened to put him
aboard the first merchantman they met; but he
dared them to try. He helped the crew to get the
ship as fit as possible again for the coming fight,
and as the afternoon wore away he directed many an
anxious glance to the north-west. A keen look-out
was maintained in the hope of spotting a stray
U boat, but the sea was empty.
? Do you think we shall trap them ? ? asked
Jerry nervously more than once.
? We?ll fix ?em all right,? Somerfield assured
him. ? Our flotilla is coming away from the
convoy, and every ship available is ringing ?em in.
Some will escape, of course ; we can?t patrol every
inch of ocean. But they will have a lively gauntlet
to run before they see the Fatherland again. Now,
you go and turn in, you are looking fagged out.?
Jerry?s astonished protests at the early hour were
brushed aside. In vain he vowed he was feeling
as fit as a fiddle. Certain lines around the mouth
and a tiredness lurking in his eyes told a different
tale. Off he had to go; but he was promised that
he would be roused an hour before dawn, at which
time contact with the enemy was expected.


The boy made up his mind that he would get no
sleep that night, but, as a matter of fact, he dropped
off soon after he had crawled into his bunk. He was
worn out, and also there was a satisfaction in his
heart which soothed him to peace in spite of the hour
of peril approaching. He was with his own proper
people ; fighting a straight fight under true colours.
Somerfield kept his word, and an hour before
dawn a seaman came and roused the boy. Jerry
was wide awake in a moment; and as he had not
undressed he had only to slip on a bridge-coat,
boots, and cap, to be ready for the deck. The
night was clear and starry, just like the night the
Patagonia was torpedoed, thought Jerry with a
twinge of pain. Ah, well! perhaps now his old
ship was to be avenged.
Jerry went and stood in front of the bridge. The
Blizzard was making about eight knots, this slow
speed making her more difficult to spot, and there
was less chance of sparks being forced from her
funnels. Above his head Somerfield and Spots were
chatting in low voices.
? Hallo, you darned Hun ! ? Spots greeted him
cheerfully over the dodger. ? Don?t go yelling to
this mob as you did to us.?
Somerfield chuckled. ? We should be in a funny
place now if he had not done that. What a nerve
the kid has ! ?
?He has nasty ways,? retorted Spots. ? I
believe he has come up here just to see fighting .
Such barbarity ?


? Hallo ! What?s that ? ? interrupted Somerfield
sharply.
Spots forgot his indignation over Jerry?s sins.
His night-glasses were to his eyes in a twinkling.
? That,? he said disappointedly, ? is a flotilla of
rotten British destroyers hurrying to sink those
U boats before poor hard-working old Blizzard can
get a word in.?
? I know. I saw them minutes ago while you
were gassing. I don?t mean to nor?ard, but dead
ahead,? snapped Somerfield.
Jerry strained his eyes through the darkness.
A faint bluish light around the horizon gave hint
of the coming dawn, but as yet it was night over the
sea, and the boy could make out nothing but the
long rollers coming to meet the ship?s bows.
? It?s a ship ?a liner,? said Spots quickly.
? The Nymph , eh ? They were trying to intercept
her, but she evidently had warning from one of the
subs and has given our chaps the slip. The last
of the decoys come to shepherd her poisonous flock,
and give ?em food for the trip home.?
? That?s it,? exclaimed Spots eagerly ; ?and,
by Jove ! there are subs with her.?
? I think so,? agreed the commander. ? Now,
dawn will come with a rush once it starts, and if we
are not near enough they will be away under water
before we can say scat 1 I think a swift dash is
called for, and devil take the risk.?
Jerry heard the lieutenant speaking calmly and
quickly into the engine-room voice pipe. ? All you
284


can give her. Thirty knots if you can get it.?
Almost immediately the vibration of the deck began
to increase, and the bow wash climbed into a tall
white wave. Water splashed over the bow as the
Blizzard responded to her powerful engines. Turn-
ing his head Jerry caught sight of a vivid red spark
flying from the funnels. The subs would be alarmed
soon now; but they would have to act quickly to
avoid the destroyer.
? The mob have turned it on too,? remarked
Spots, as he peered through his glass towards the
north.
? Yes, Simons will know what to do,? rejoined
Somerfield. ? Pass the word. We are not more
than three miles from that decoy, and there are
subs nearer. We shall be in action in a few
minutes.?
Low-toned orders passed along the deck, and a
slight expectant stir went over the ship. Jerry felt
the first sharp thrill of imminent action. There
was silence again, except for the trembling murmur
of the racing ship, and the swish and splash of the
sea. The wind of speed beat into Jerry?s face, and
spray flicked him icily, but he kept his gaze fixed
eagerly ahead.
A brilliant shaft of light flashed suddenly across
the sea from the north. It lit the waters around the
liner, revealing the long dark hulls of submarines.
Three other searchlights immediately sprang into
existence, lighting the enemy vessels vividly as they
travelled across their formation. The Nymph


stood up, a fine target for the guns; but it was at
five great U boats gliding along between the decoy
ship and the Blizzard that Jerry looked.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
The salvos of the British flotilla opened the
battle, and shells winked dazzlingly around the
U boats. The destroyers were either in line ahead
or echelon as they rushed in on the surprised enemy.
Jerry glanced up impatiently to the bridge above
him. As yet the searchlight of the Blizzard was still
in darkness.
? Hold your fire,? called Somerfield. ?We are
much nearer than the rest. We shall give them the
shock of their lives when we rush in on them.?
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
The guns of the destroyers were working for
dear life to make the most of the golden opportunity
while it lasted.
? There goes one ! ? shouted Jerry excitedly,
as a vivid flash shot up from one of the nearer
U boats, and the searchlights showed a cloud of
dark smoke drifting away where, a minute before,
had been the submarine.
BOOM!
The Nymph had recovered from her surprise and
had taken up the fight. She was turning, too, to
come through the group of starboard submarines
and take the brunt of the battle upon her tall sides,
so shielding them.
? There are two more subs west?ard of the
Nymph? yelled Spots. ? Six all told afloat.?
286


BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
Jerry saw with delight that guns were flashing
now from several of the U boats. They were going
to make a fight for it. So far they had not seen the
Blizzard, and the odds were heavily in their favour.
Shells were flashing around them, and fountains of
water sprang again and again into the air as the
salvos plunged into the sea around them. Ah !
One was submerging ; one of those beyond the
Nymph. She had slowed dow T n as though injured,
and was now evidently intent on escape.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BANG !
? Ye gods ! ? gulped Spots, ? that?s one of ours.
So soon ! ?
? Torpedo, I think,? said Somerfield. ? They
are probably pumping the things into the midst of
our crowd.?
? They are going to fight to a finish ! ? exulted
Spots. ? Five of ?em and the Nymph against three,
as they think. They think they have a walk-over.
When do we start ? ?
?I?m going right into the middle of ?em,?
replied Somerfield coolly. ? They have no eyes for
us, and we?re going to make a sensation. I want to
torpedo the Nymph as we go by.?
? Good egg ! ? ejaculated Spots.
The decoy was now through to the nearer line
of submarines, and they, in their turn, were steering
away to draw the destroyers under the guns of the
bigger vessel. The Nymph was one of the latest and


fastest of the London-America boats, and it was
evident she had been well armed also.
? She has a pretty broadside, that Nymph,"
remarked Somerfield. ?If we had not caught her
here she would have had a lovely career as a raider.?
? Our chaps are having a rough time ! ?
?So are the subs. Look at that chap ! ?
The U boat farthest north was beginning to send
up a column of smoke. She turned slowly to port
and drifted towards the centre of the formation.
Men were running up through her hatches, but one
gun still fired. One of the British destroyers was
making ahead of her ; the other two were evidently
steering more to the south to take the enemy between
two fires.
? Now for it! ? yelled Somerfield. ? Let the
Nymph have it. Open fire ! ?
BOOMP!
The destroyer shook to the salvo. There fol-
lowed the hiss of a torpedo tube, and a white line
began to stretch rapidly outward from the beam
towards the Nymph, lying broadside on to the
Blizzard.
As though it had been a signal, the searchlights
suddenly went out. With surprise Jerry saw that
the dawn had come, and that a grey light lit the scene.
BOOMP!
? Rapid independent now ! ? bawled Somerfield.
On the Blizzard's quarter the three other
destroyers were spread. One, the rearmost, was turn-
ing away, smoke and flame pouring from her. A

A thunderous explosion rolled
across the sea, and the destroyer trembled to the shock.




solitary gun barked viciously again and again, flashing
through the black smoke. The Nymph , too, was afire
amidships, and her bows were rather low in the water.
Ahead, four of the submarines formed a rough circle,
the fifth one drifting helplessly through them.
Boomp ! Boomp ! Boomp !
The Blizzard's three usable guns were going as
fast as they could be loaded.
Crash ! Cr-u-mp !
They were under fire now ; probably from the
Nymph , although the submarines were also des-
perately turning their guns to try to stop her rush.
? Give her hell ! ? yelled Somerfield into the
voice pipe.
Jerry jumped as he saw that one of the subs was
right across the bows. She had abandoned her
guns and was hastening to crash-dive; but there was
every chance of reaching her.
B-O-O-MI
A thunderous explosion rolled across the sea,
and the destroyer trembled to the shock. But Jerry
had no time to question its cause. The bows of
the destroyer reared above the diving U boat. She
was under water now, but her periscope showed that
she had not yet sunk far.
Crash !
Another shower of shells fell on and around
the ship. The air was full of fumes and shrieking
fragments.
Boomp ! Boomp ! Boomp !
? Prepare to ram ! ? bawled Somerfield almost


at the last possible moment. The gun crews flung
themselves swiftly to the deck, and Jerry dropped
down in imitation.
C-R-U-N-C-H!
The boy was slung some feet along the deck by
the force of the impact. He did not even notice
his bruises. Another U boat was settled ! He
scrambled on to his knees to gaze eagerly around.
Two more U boats were on the beam, and beyond
was a British destroyer, blazing away at them. The
Blizzard's guns woke to life abruptly again. Ahead
there was a solitary submarine. The other had
either submerged or been sunk. There was some-
thing queer about this one. Why, her conning
tower had gone ! Men were standing on her deck
with upstretched arms. One was holding a white
flag.
The two to the north were fighting to the end.
It was too late to submerge, and they would not
surrender. The thud of depth charges told Jerry
that the missing sub had submerged to escape, and
that the Blizzard was bombing for her.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
They were fighting well, those two U boats.
Caught between the two destroyers the men worked
their guns while they could stand, while around them
their boats were being shot to pieces. As Jerry
regained his feet, one boat blew up with a jarring
explosion. Men were flung through the air in a
smother of smoke and flying iron. The shattered
shell sank immediately.


Suddenly the other boat gave in. Either their
ammunition was exhausted, or the shock of their
consort?s fate had broken them. Some of her
gunners flung themselves on the crumpled deck and
lay still in their exhaustion.
The abrupt cessation of the gunfire was almost
painful. Jerry hurried round the bridge to see what
had happened to the Nymph and the other destroyers.
The decoy still floated, but she was near her end.
Her forepart was under water, and her poop stood
high above it. A solitary gun peeped upwards to
the sky from an after deckhouse. Around her were
several boats, and Jerry saw that the third destroyer
was taking the survivors on board. Some distance
beyond floated the last of the British flotilla, but she
was a deserted volcano of smoke and flame.
At last the boy thought of the Blizzard herself, and
he was shocked by what he saw. Coming through
unscathed himself, he had not considered the
damage those bursting shells were doing. Amid-
ships the little craft was almost wrecked. The slow
beat of her engines told of trouble below. Men
were lying dead or injured about the decks, and
their comrades were hastening to the sufferers? relief.
? Well, you have been properly blooded this
time, my son ! ? said Lieutenant Somerfield as he
came on the boy bandaging a gunner?s shoulder as
best he could.
? It?s horrid?this part of it,? said Jerry.
? We are lucky to be afloat, considering the way
we planked into the middle of them,? returned the


commander grimly. ? Good job our torpedo got the
Nymph , or it might have been worse. We are sound
enough to carry on under our own steam till we meet
something anyway. The others have as many as
they can carry with those rescued survivors, I
think.?
? And that,? remarked Spots, as he joined them,
?is that! I knew I shouldn?t like a real fight.?
With a shock Jerry saw the cheerful sub had
his arm bandaged from hand to elbow and in a
rough sling.
? Yes, it is my last fight,? smiled Spots, a trifle
wryly. ?You were right below us, Pussy ; I got
this, and Somer here got a scratch on the head, and
you got ?nothing ! ?
? I told you he had nine lives,? laughed Somer-
field. ? Now get below, Spots.?


CHAPTER XXIII
CONCLUSION
IT was from the deck of the S.S. Gaika , a fortnight
later, that Jerry watched the heights of Sierra
Leone sinking into the sea. Around the ship the
last of the convoy were taking station, and the sight
of the ordered lines of dazzle-painted vessels brought
back vividly to the boy the evening of the torpedoing
of the Patagonia. He wondered what Bully Davis
and Harry Prebble thought of the submarine
activities now ! It was almost as though he leaned
again on the rail, with the half-deck behind him,
listening for the arguing voices to start. To
heighten the impression, Peter spoke as he reached
the deck again from his visit to their cabin.
? What do you think of things now, Jerry ? ?
Jerry turned to smile at his chum. Peter looked
thinner and more serious, but his hair still stood
rumpled up, and his eyes roved as keenly as ever.
? I was thinking it was like old times,? replied
Jerry. ?Not old , really ; although they seem a long
way away somehow.?
? Three weeks, that?s all. And in that short
time we have played our little part in breaking the
sub menace. You know, in spite of the fearful fuss


they made of us in Freetown, and the cables and
newspaper columns, I can?t realize even yet that
they are making us real live naval men, and that the
old merchant cadet days are gone. We?re middies !
Naval men ! ?
? Heaven help the navy ! ? said a pious voice
behind them. ?To think it has come down to
Hun pussycats and tow-headed cadets.?
The boys turned to find Spots grinning at them.
His arm was slung in a neat white bandage, but he
looked as bright and spry as ever otherwise.
? Well, my merry snotties,? he continued, ? I
hope the weight of your numerous decorations won?t
sink the ship.?
Jerry grinned, but also coloured a trifle self-
consciously. ? Matter of fact, we think they have
overdone it a bit,? he replied.
? Bit ! ? squealed Spots. ? A commission in
the service ; the D.S.C. for both of you ; and the
V.C. for Pussy as well! The Admiralty lords are
obviously failing, to show such poor judgment.?
? Must be,? agreed Peter readily. ? I hear they
have promoted you to full-blown lieutenant.?
? Don?t make fun of your superior officer,? said
Spots loftily. ? I can chip you as much as I like
now, but you must take it all meekly, and say
? Yes, sir.? ?
? We weren?t saying anything, sir,? protested
Peter. ?We were just wondering silently why you
were promoted for doing nothing. Now, if you had
done what we did ?


? Swank ! Brag ! Pure unadulterated blow ! ?
squeaked Spots. ?You have swelled heads, you
blighters ! That reminds me,? he continued calmly,
? that being in hospital till yesterday I have not
heard the rest of your lies ?adventures, I mean, of
course. What happened to you on the U 197 after
Jerry was knocked out ? ?
? Nothing much,? replied Peter lightly. ? The
shell that put Jerry to sleep slung me against the
side of the conning tower, but did me no serious
harm. The place was full of smoke, and there were
more shells popping outside. I saw the lieutenant,
with Jerry over his shoulder, struggling up the ladder,
and then water poured in, and we were gasping and
fighting for life. It seems the fools below, in a panic,
had flooded the tanks and submerged the ship with
all hatches open and holes everywhere.?
?We saw you go under and thought of your
finish, so did not look for you further,? remarked
Spots.
?We could have only just submerged and come
up again,? continued Peter. ? The boat struggled
above water somehow, but the main part was flooded
badly, and chlorine gas began to pour through the
ship. We scrambled to the deck and heard the
depth charges popping and saw the lights roving
over the sea ; but somehow you managed to overlook
us. For one thing, some of the convoy ships were
making towards us, and they screened us. I had
given Jerry up for lost, for he and the lieutenant had
vanished.?


Peter paused to dwell again on that awful hour.
? Not knowing,? broke in Spots, ? that Hun
cats can?t drown I ?
? Now, look here ? began Jerry indig-
nantly.
? Shan?t! Let Peter finish his yarn.?
Peter hurried on to calm the storm. ? Grosmann
was killed by Faversham?s bullet, and the watch
officer had been trapped below and asphyxiated,
along with Schmidt and the after torpedo crew.
We tried to get at them, but it was hopeless.?
? I?m sorry about Schmidt,? said Jerry miserably.
? It was our fault, and he was a good sort.?
? It?s war,? returned Peter grimly. ? Harris
had reached the hatch from below with half the
crew hanging on to him ?you?d be surprised at that
queer little chap?s fighting power when he is roused
?when the shell blew him down the ladder again,
breaking his leg. We were lucky to get him out.
To cut the story short, Faversham took charge.
He plugged an engineer who showed fight, and that
thoroughly cowed the crew. It was impossible to
go right below, but by wrapping wet cloths round
his face Faversham reached the wireless set in the
conning tower. It had emergency accumulators,
and after grabbing and studying the signal books
he managed to get out a signal calculated to bring
some of the U boats to us. He had intended next
to signal our ships to catch the U boats, but found
to his dismay that the set would not send an ordinary
signal. He bullied that chap Baumgart, but he
296


CONCLUSION
declared he knew nothing of the working of the
special sets.?
? More probably he funked working in the
chlorine gas,? remarked Spots.
? It was pretty awful down there,? admitted
Peter. ? Next day a sub turned up and things
looked nasty, but fortunately the jolly old Bengali
came along and sunk her with the first shell. She
radioed, in code, information of the German method
of signalling, and that, with what Jerry had passed
on through you, knocked the bottom from the
arrangements for smashing up our convoys. The
Bengali took us to Freetown, and that?s all.?
? One thing, Peter,? said Jerry. ? You have
never told me how you and Faversham came to my
aid in the conning tower. It was three-quarters of
an hour before time, but you came just right.?
Peter grinned. ? Grosmann must have been
standing by the voice pipes when he shouted at you.
I heard his threats quite clearly in the wireless room,
and hopped out to warn Faversham.?
? Lummy ! Yer don?t say as ?ow we?re put to
sea ! ?
The three turned quickly to see a cheerful face
at the port of the near-by hospital cabin.
Hallo ! Awake at last.? Jerry strode quickly
over with a smile of pleasure on his face. ? You
have had the best sleep for weeks, Harris.?
? Lummy, yes ! It were too ?ot in that ?orspital
ashore, and, anyway, it?s more natural like to be in
a bunk on board.?


? How?s the leg progressing ? ? asked Spots.
? Ai, sir. A turn in Blighty, and I?ll be chucking
the dishes arahnd again like one-thing. Lummy !
It seems funny to fink of you two boys bein? mid-
shipmen, though.?
? There are a lot of funny things happening
in this war indeed ! ? agreed Spots sorrowfully.
? Now, look here,? said Peter severely, ? don?t
presume on that bit of a bruise on your arm too
much. There have been mangled bodies picked
up out of the water for less than that before to-day.?
? I know,? replied Spots thoughtfully. ?We
picked up a body once : a funny Hun cat, all wet
and sploshy, that had jumped off a German decoy
ship.?
The next moment the lieutenant was off for his
life, with Jerry grabbing wildly at him as he ran.
Peter leaned on the deckhead to giggle helplessly,
while Harris craned his neck in an effort to watch
the sport.
? ?E soon found poor ol? Jerry?s sore point, ain?t
?e ? ? chuckled Harris.
? Yes ; it is worse than ever since he had to
play that traitor game on the U 197,? laughed
Peter.
? Lummy ! He ?ad some go to carry that through
too ! ? exclaimed Harris. ? Remember ?ow ol?
Jonesie lammed ?im ? ?
Spots had reached a comer of the deckhouse
and dived out of sight. Jerry made an extra spurt
to catch him.


CONCLUSI 0&
? You blinking . . . Oosh ! ?
Jerry collided violently with some one coming
round the corner in the opposite direction.
What the devil? ? roared a mighty voice.
Jerry started back with respectful haste.
? Sorry, sir,? he said, and waited for the storm.
? Oh, it?s you, is it ? ? growled Commander
Faversham. ? Still rushing in where you shouldn?t
be ? We?ll have to take some of that out of you
when we get you to sea again.? (The commander
did not consider himself at sea while treading the
boards of a mere merchantman.) ? Where?s your
mate ? ?
? Here I am, sir,? responded Peter as he joined
Jerry.
. ? Hum ! Well, I have had various letters just
before sailing; also a cable or two. You will be
pleased to hear that all the Chowkidar boats were
picked up. The only hands lost were the after gun?s
crew.?
? Hurrah ! ? shouted Peter. ? Was Harry
Appleby ? ?
? He?s all right.?
? Will they join you again, sir ? ? asked Jerry
wistfully.
? They have made that request,? replied Faver-
sham, and he made his voice more fierce than usual
to hide his pride and emotion. ? And, as I was
trying to say but you will interrupt, confound your
impertinence, my application that you be appointed
to my next command has also been approved.?


?YYoyou?you ?applied for us, sir ? ? Jerry could
hardly get the words out in his delighted surprise.
? Yes, provided you agree. I want no unwilling
hands on the Q boats.?
? If I may intrude, sir,? chimed in Spot?s voice,
? you are inviting trouble. These young rips have
the knack of finding every bit of excitement in the
Western Ocean ! ?
For once in his life Commander Faversham
chuckled heartily. ? That,? he said, ?is why I
want them, if they?ll come ? ?
? Will we ? ? crowed Peter.
? We,? said Jerry emphatically, ? will ! ?

of morphia and dynamite !
