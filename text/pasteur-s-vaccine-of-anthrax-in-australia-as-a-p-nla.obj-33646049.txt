VACCINE OF ANTHRAX
I3ST AUSTRALIA
Sydney, sth September , rSga.
Since this pamphlet was printed the Vaccination for Anthrax has
been carried out during two seasons with fairly good results.
Nearly 200,000 sheep have been vaccinated during the year 1890,
and 98,261 sheep during the year 1891.
The report of the Chief Inspector of Stock, for last year, is to
the following effect;?
?M. Loir (Pasteur?s representative) continued his protective innoculation
in infected districts with very satisfactory results. 98,261 sheep were, during
the year, vaccinated with M. Pasteur?s vaccine of anthrax, in different parts of
the colony. The results of the vaccination is, on the whole, very satisfactory.
Taking the whole number of sheep vaccinated, the loss through the operation,
and from disease afterwards, was less than one-half per cent.
The vaccine may be obtained, for any part of the Australasian
colonies, at the reduced rate of Twopence per sheep and Fourpence
per head of cattle. Applications for New South Wales may be made
to A. A Devlin, Esq., Stock and Station Agent, Junee, New South
Wales, and to Box 1389, G.P.0., Sydney, for the other colonies.

PASTEUR?S VACCINE
CUMBERLAND DISEASE.
Cumberland disease in stock, which is known as splenic fever
in England, ?anthrax ? or ?charbon? in France, is produced by
a microscopical organism called bacteridie, from which arises the
infection of the blood.
The scientific proof of the identity of Cumberland disease
with charbon was given at the request of the Chief Inspector of
Stock of New South Wales, by Pasteur?s representatives, in the
following report, bearing the date of May, 1888 :
To the Honourable F. Abigail, Minister for Mines.
Sir, ?We have the honour to lay before you an account of the
investigations which we have made at your request, with the view of
determining the nature of the Cumberland disease at Marah, the station
of Mr. A. Devlin, in the Riverina district. On Tuesday, May 1, we
inoculated, with the blood of a sheep which had died of a disease stated
by Messrs. Stanley and Devlin to be Cumberland, two young sheep in
the inner part of the thigh. At the end of 36-40 hours one of the
sheep was dead, and at the post-mortem the ordinary lesions of a disease
called in France sang de rate or charbon were observed. These were
gelatinous oedemia at point of inoculation, spleen enlarged, dark and
soft, blood dark and not coagulated, sub cutaneous hemorrhage, bloody
urine, &c. On Thursday, May 3, with blood from the spleen of the
sheep we inoculated four mice, of which three were dead at the end of
18 hours. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of the
bacillus anthracis in each of them. With blood from the spleen of one
of these mice a cultivation was made in beef broth sterilised and
neutralised, and at the end of 24 hours the broth had assumed the


flocculent aspect characteristic of the growth of the bacillus. Under
the microscope the microbes were observed to have taken the filamentous
state with formation of spores. Other cultivations were made in gelatin
and on potatoes. On May 7, at 10 a.m., a rabbit was inoculated with
a few drops of the cultivation, and died at 3 p.m. on May 8. A post-
mortem was made in the presence of Mr. Stanley (Government
Veterinarian) and Mr. William Hamlet (Government Analyst), through
whose kindness we have, been able to make our experiments at the
laboratory of the Government Analyst. The examination of the blood
showed the presence of the bacillus anthracis only. The experiments
and cultivations which we have made enable us to definitely state?l.
That the anatomical lesions of the Cumberland disease are the same as
those of charbon (anthrax!. 2. That the disease is due to the presence
of a microbe, of which the appearance, the cultivations, and the
physiological properties are the same as those of the bacillus anthracis.
3. That, consequently, Cumberland disease and charbon are one and the
same disease. (Signed), A. Loir, N. Gf.rmoxt, and Frank Hinds.
At the request of the New South Wales Government, a
demonstration was given by Pasteur?s representatives with vaccine
from the Pasteur Institute of Paris, to show the value of this
vaccine against Cumberland disease. A Board, composed of
John de V. Lamb, Esq. (Chairman, Board of Sheep Directors,
Sydney), Arthur A. Devlin, Esq. (Chairman, Board of Sheep
Directors, Narandera), William M. Hamlet, Esq., F.1.C., F.C.S.
(Government Analyst), A. Bruce, Esq. (Chief Inspector of Stock,
New South Wales), Edward Stanley, Esq, F.R.C.V.S. (Government
Veterinarian), was appointed by the Government to watch and
report on these experiments.
This demonstration took place at Junee in the paddock of
Thomas W. Hammond, Esq., J.P. (President of the Murrurnbidgee
Pastoral and Agricultural Association). Twenty sheep and four
cattle were inoculated during the month of September, 1888,
with the vaccine from Paris, and a fortnight after the same twenty
sheep and four cattle were again inoculated with blood of a
sheep which died of Cumberland disease. These twenty sheep
and four cattle were not affected, whilst two other cattle and
nineteen other sheep of the same lot, purchased from the same
person and inoculated at the same time, with the same infected
blood as the twenty previously vaccinated sheep, died within


60 hours, and of the two cattle one died, and the other, after
being very ill, recovered. In reporting on these experiments the
Board speaks as follows ;
OPINION OF THE BOARD.
After carefully watching the whole series of experiments,
and giving the subject the fullest consideration, the Board are
unanimously of opinion that the efficacy of Mr. Pasteur?s Vaccine
of Anthrax as a preventive against that disease is conclusively
demonstrated, and therefore recommend its adoption and use.
VACCINATION.
Messieurs. Pasteur, Chamberland and Roux, in the year 1881
discovered a method whereby to diminish the virulence of the
anthrax microbe. They found bacteridie to be obtainable of a
distinctive species, by the introduction of which into the system
by means of vaccination, the disease u ould be anticipated and
neutralised in its more formidable aspect.
In order to render the operation both safe and effective, two
vaccinations are made ; in the first instance with a microbe very
much attenuated (first vaccine), which causes only a little increase
of temperature, while it to a large extent gives immu uty from
the disease; and in ten or fifteen days afterwards with a
bacteridie more virulent (second vaccine), which would kill some
of the animals if they had not been partially protected by the
earlier inoculation. On the completion of the second vaccination
the stock are impervious to the disease.
The Junee experiment was a repetition of a similar one
made by Pasteur himself in 1881, when he, with Chamberland
and Roux, first discovered the Anthrax vaccine. At that time
some were doubtful about the efficacy of the vaccine, but the
very general use of Pasteur?s vaccine against Anthrax in the
infected portion of France and the favourable results have re-
moved all doubts as to its efficacy.

The vaccination in France from 1881 to 1888 inclusive is as
follows:
Death rate during year following
~ . vaccination.
Years. Sheep. Catt e. Sheep per cent. Cattle per cent.
This includes the death rate through the vaccination at time,
and for year following. In France vaccine is supplied only to
Veterinary Surgeons. The statistics in the foregoing report are
taken from yearly reports sent to the Pasteur Institute by nearly
200 Veterinary Surgeons throughout France.
It will be seen from this how very general the use of
Pasteur?s system has become in pastoral practice, and this existing
as it has done for eight years is the best proof of its power. The
Stockowner does not care about scientific controversy, nor does
he risk his money in supporting any particular school. The value
of the vaccination is judged by him from his loss or gain, and in
the course of eight years he has had ample time and opportunity
to make up his mind.
Statistics show that in the infested country the percentage
of death in sheep has, through vaccination, been lessened from
ten to under one per cent.
To show the opinion held in France of Pasteur?s vaccine of
Anthrax, it may be stated that the Insurance Companies who
insure Stock have a clause in their policy compelling Stock-
owners to vaccinate their stock against Anthrax. Pasteur?s
vaccine system has been long adopted, not only in France, but
also in Austria, Italy, Spain, India, and South America, with
decided success.


DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION.
The vaccine is sent in glass tubes, closed with a cork. Each
tube contains enough liquid to vaccinate from one hundred to
two hundred sheep. The tubes bear a label, marked, ? Ist vac-
cine,? or ? 2nd vaccine.? The liquid must be introduced under
the skin of the animal. This is done with a Pravaz syringe
generally used for the purpose of making hypodermic injections.
The syringe must be sterilised every day before use. To do so
it is filled with ordinary water, then the inoculating needle is
taken out and both the syringe and the needle put in cold water,
with the precaution to put a little glass-rod under the needle-
part of the syringe, so as to prevent the solder of the glass from
touching the bottom of the water-vessel. Then the vessel is put
on the fire and the water is made to boil for ten minutes. When
the syringe is taken out it is dried with paper and then ready to
be filled with vaccine, to do so the needle is put on the syringe.
The cork is taken out of the tube, but before, this tube must be
shaken for some time, and then the liquid is aspired into the
syringe in moving slowly the plug. If the syringe is in good state
it will fill, but sometimes it occurs that some air remains under the
elder-bush pith plug when the plug is too dry or if the needle is
not well adjusted on the syringe. Then the needle is again fixed
on the syringe and a part of the liquid is pushed again on the tube.
If it is done two or three times then the plug is wet and if the
needle is well fixed the syringe may be filled entirely. This first
condition is necessary. If the plug is too dry and lets some air


pass, the operator must make some water boil; then let it cool in
the same dish, and when it is cold the syringe is filled and emptied
two or three times in order to wet the plug. For that purpose
one must never use ordinary water without being boiled. If the
plug lets some liquid pass through it must be tightened up with
the little screw driver which is in every syringe box, and then is
ready for use. The syringe well and entirely tilled, the little
screw nut which is at the top of the plug rod is screwed down, as
to make it go to the division marked No. 1.
The sheep is to be set down and the operator puts the needle
under the skin near the middle of the inside of the right thigh
and then pushes the plug until the screw nut touches the syringe.
The inoculation is done. Then the syringe is taken out of the
sheep, the screw nut is turned the other way to bring it to the
No. 2 division and the second sheep is inoculated, and so every
syringe is sufficient to inoculate 16 sheep. When empty the
syringe is filled again and so on. With practice and sufficient
help 6000 sheep may be vaccinated in a day. Twelve or fifteen
days after, the same operation is done with the second vaccine,
but this time the inoculation takes place on the left leg.
Sometimes it occurs that the operator or assistant forgets to
raise the screw-nut, and when he pushes the plug, it does not
project any liquid under the skin. In such circumstances, if it
occurs during the first inoculation, the first vaccine has not been
introduced into the hody, the second vaccine, being a little
stronger, may produce death. Therefore, so as to avoid accident,
when the first vaccine has been injected, the animals operated on
should be marked, so as to prevent any animal which has not
received it from receiving the second vaccine. The syringe may
accidentally not be quite full, and may therefore have a small
portion of air in it. If the inoculator holds the syringe in such a
position (point upwards) as to admit of air entering with the
injection, the vaccination is thereby rendered of no effect.
IMPORTANT REMARKS.
The vaccine must be introduced under the skin in a state of
absolute purity. If the liquid were not pure, that is to say,
spoiled with water not boiled, other microbes will be introduced


with the attenuated microbe. Those microbes may communicate
other diseases, as septicemia, abscesses, etc., or prevent the vaccine
from taking effect. So as to avoid these inconveniences the liquid
is sent absolutely pure, and it must be taken directly from the
tube with the syringe, which has also to be clean, that is to say,
sterilised. In order to have the vaccine always in its perfect
purity it must be used as soon as possible, and before use kept in
a cool and dark place. A. tube once opened must be used on the
day of the opening, and never kept until the next day. The part
remaining unused should be thrown away and destroyed.
FOR CATTLE AND HORSES.
fie X'm The same vaccine is used as for Vis
sheep, but the doses are double, ?Ae??�
every syringe full is sufficient to
vaccinate eight cattle or horses. Instead of performing the
inoculation on the leg, it is done behind the shoulder for cattle,
and on the neck for horses.
Remark.? Generally the animals do not show any signs of
unfavourable effects from the operation, but sometimes there
ensues swelling more or less extended, from which, however, they
recover without any treatment.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN AUSTRALIA.
The twenty sheep and four cattle vaccinated at the Junee
demonstration in October, 1888, were placed in an infected
paddock near Junee, and although a twelve per cent, of
the ordinary sheep running in the same paddock, have died, the
twenty vaccinated sheep and four cattle are still alive and in very
good condition after two years.
At the beginning of July, 1890, one hundred sheep were
vaccinated by Mr. A. A. Devlin, to test the vaccine now prepared
in the Pasteur Institute of Australia. They are all in good
condition in the paddock of Mr. Hammond. Since that time the
vaccination has been done by Mr. A.-A. Devlin on about 150,000
sheep in N.S.W., the death rate only being 1 in 2000.


The vaccine used now in Australia is the same used for about
ten years in France, and in every country where a Pasteur
Institute exists, and is originated in the Paris Pasteur Institute.
EXTENT OF IMMUNITY.
During a year after the vaccination all the sheep are absolutely
proof against Cumberland disease, after a year some may become
liable to take the disease, but a very few. After two years the
percentage will be larger, so it is advisable to vaccinate valuable
sheep every year. But for ordinary flock sheep, the percentage
of death will probably be so small during the second year, that
owners will not deem it necessary to vaccinate that class of sheep
oftener than once in three years. But this, experiments only can
settle.
