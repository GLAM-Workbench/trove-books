LAND & LIFE
I.—Every honest man to whom God has given life, has a
right to life.
2. Air, Water, and Land are needful to life. Air must he
allwhere, Water somewhere, and Land give produce to
sustain life.
3.—A1l who have a right to life have a right to a share of
Air, Water, and Land.
4-““He is guilty against man’s life who prejudicially poisons
the Air, intercepts Water, or obstructs the Earth’s fair
distribution and productiveness.
5.—-No claim by reason of discovery, improvement, or pur-
chase can stand against the inalienable rights of man-
kind ; but due recompense should be given.
6.—None can be absolute owners of Land; it is only a trust;
and if a man neglect his trust it must be removed to
better hands, lest mankind be injured.
