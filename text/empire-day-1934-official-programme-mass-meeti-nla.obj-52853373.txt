SIGNIFICANCE OF
EMPIRE DAY
■8". &
DAY is not, in any sense, a political party movement, but
•*—' if it were it should appeal more strongly to those who condemn it
than to those who support it, as the various ceremonies connected with its
observance are merely expressions of thankfulness for the many
reforms which were enacted during the reign of Queen Victoria. How
many people realise that less than 100 years ago the punishment for
Block by courtesy of Alfred J. Kent, Government Printer.
HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY, QUEEN VICTORIA.
Born 24th May. 1819. Succeeded William IV., 20th June. 1837. Married 10th
February, 1840. Four sons and five daughters. Closed a record reign,
22nd January, 1901.
petty theft was transportation for life and that the penalty for theft
to the value of five shillings and more was death! In so many other
ways the lot of the poor was so much improved during Queen Victoria’s
reign (1837-1901) that the condition of workers to-day is immeasurably
better than in pre-Victorian days.
Everybody who believes that “GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE
BY THE PEOPLE” is the best form of Government should honour the
memory of Queen Victoria and do something, either by work or money
or both, to see that the 24th May is observed perpetually as a day of
rejoicing in every city, town and village throughout the Empire. The
BRITISH EMPIRE UNION IN AUSTRALIA (Founders of Empire
Day observance in Australia), 19 Bridge Street, Sydney, will be pleased
to receive communications from readers who desire to help the movement.

Objective
The Royal Society of St. George exists to encourage and enliven
the spirit of patriotism among all classes of Englishmen. It set its
face against none but those who go about to weaken that spirit. It
knows no creed but the love of our country, no party but the party
of those who seek to serve her in any of the innumerable ways in which
a State may be helped to dignity and honour. The Society founds itself
upon one of the profoundest instincts of man—the instinct which has
taught him that the best and highest of human life is attained in those
separate commonwealths, each bound together by ties of common race
and speech and habit, which we call nations.
Its chief aim is to appeal to every Englishman and Englishwoman
or descendants throughout N.S.W. to reflect upon the Society’s lofty
though natural aspirations in the hope that the ever-present spark of
patriotism and love for dear old England may be galvanised into healthy
activity, and influence many more to link up with the Society.
Apathy, indifference and an aversion to outward display have too
long held Englishmen from acclaiming England the greatest country
extant.
England is interwoven with the golden strands that bind our civili-
sation together, and the spirit of England must and shall be kept alive
in all its illuminating glory by those who call her home.

The Overseas League
(Incorporated by Royal Charter)
Patron: HIS MAJESTY THE KING,
The Overseas League is a non-party society of British subjects
residing in all parts of the world. Its underlying motive is to promote
the unity of British subjects. Its four chief objects are:—
1. To draw together in the bond of comradeship British subjects the
world over;
2. To render individual service to our Empire;
3. To maintain the power of the Empire and to hold to its best tradi-
tions;
4. To help one another.
MEMBERS’ CREED.—Believing the British Empire to stand for
justice, freedom, order and good government, we pledge ourselves, as
citizens of the British Commonwealth of Nations, to maintain the heri-
tage handed down to us by our fathers.

The Australian Women’s Guild of Empire
Northcote House, Reiby Place.
Our objective is to bring about a union of members of the Aus-
tralian community to end INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL STRIFE.
Our objective is to unite all members of the Australian community
in an effort to develop Australia as a part of the British Empire under
democratic institutions, to safeguard the family, and to strengthen the
power of the Christian faith.
We work for co-operation in industry as opposed to industrial war-
fare, and for political unity against the class war.
We believe that investors, employers and employed can find a com-
mon ground in industry for SERVING the community and one another,
and that it should be the aim of the leaders and rank and file in our
political parties to assist each other to make Australia a happy and
prosperous country—not to divide the people in ceaseless strife and
injure their interests by oppressive legislation.

Secretary: Mrs. ROYES METCALFE.

To trace wide oceans o’er; Or dare a foot to land,

The standard of the brave; Beyond wide oceans’ roll,

Britannia rules the waves.” Still keep a British soul.
