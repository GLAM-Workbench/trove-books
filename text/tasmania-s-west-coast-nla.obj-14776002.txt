DELORAINE
DELORAINE is a large agricultural centre, 30 miles
from Launceston. It is a beautiful, English-looking
town, and, being the centre of a fine tourist district,
its splendid hotels are kept very busy in the
summer-time.
Wonderful caves, meandering rivers, great
cliffs, and sparkling waterfalls are all within reach
of the town. There is good trout fishing in the
Meander and neighbouring streams, also in Great
Lake which is 25 miles away by motor road. Every
facility is offered to the visitor to spend an enjoyable
holiday in beautiful surroundings. There is a fine
racecourse, which provides the biggest meetings
outside the cities, and visitors may enjoy golf,
tennis, fishing, shooting, swimming, etc., according
to their particular bent for sport.
SHEFFIELD
SHEFFIELD has many attractions . . . mountain
scenery, waterfalls, fern glades, and delightful walks.
The view from Mount Roland is superb.
Forth Falls is another delightful spot, with its
numerous waterfalls, fern glades, and other bush
attractions.
Round Hill-Cethana is a delightful drive through
mountain country. This is an ideal round motor
trip, running along the foot of Mount Roland and
Mount Claude. Sheffield is a starting point for the
famous Cradle Mountain Reserve.
A visit to the Sheffield waterworks reservoir,
on the top of the hill, is a delightful run from the
town, about two and a half miles. A good view of the
North-West Coast and other adjacent districts can
be had from the top.
Good accommodation may be secured at either
of the two hotels, which are sewered, and in
every respect cater efficiently for the tourist traffic.

LATROBE
WHERE the sparkling, crystal-clear waters of the
Mersey River first feel the influence of the tides,
prior to flowing into Port Frederick, and onwards
past Devonport, to the open sea, nestles the pic-
turesque town of Latrobe. One of the oldest towns
on the Coast, it is full of interest and charm. Here a
scenic pathway, Bell's Parade, has been formed on
both banks of the river. The pathway extends for
over half a mile, crossing mountain streams and
glens, and bordered with ferns and other native
flora, making it a place of rare beauty.
Within a few minutes’ walk of the town, the
track opens out into a delightful park, planted with
ornamental trees, under which tables and seats
have been placed. An ideal camping ground.
The Mersey is confidently recommended to
anglers for Spring and early Summer fishing. The
river, containing the purest running water, is well
stocked with trout, over 50,000 fry being liberated
annually. Fish up to 11£ lb. have been taken on rod
and line, whilst smaller specimens of from 2 to 4 lb.
are quite common.
Anglers may also find another good fishing
ground at Port Sorell, nine miles away. This, as well
as providing for the angler, is a most popular
seaside resort, and is much patronised by campers.
Bott’s Gorge and Denny’s Gorge, scenic gems,
filled with the rarer ferns, sassafras, myrtles, musks,
etc., and waterfalls ; the Goliath Cement Works,
and a host of other interesting spots, may be
visited.
The town itself is modern in every respect. It
is lit by electricity, and possesses an excellent
water-supply, as well as bowling and croquet
greens, tennis-courts, and municipal aerodrome.

DETONPORT and DISTRICT
CHARMINGLY situated on the banks of the Mersey
River, Devonport, with a population of approxi-
mately 5,000, is recognised as one of the most
beautiful and popular tourist towns in the State. In
addition to being within easy reach by road, rail,
and water, of some of the most noted of the State’s
beauty spots, the town, which is the third centre of
population in Tasmania, possesses facilities which
make it an ideal holiday resort.
Visitors from various parts of the Commonwealth
have described the nine-hole golf course at East
Devonport as the best course of its size on which
they have played.
Situated in the centre of the town are the bowling
greens, tennis-courts, and croquet lawns, all in the
one block. There are excellent and safe beaches
within a few minutes’ walk. Mersey Bluff Beach,
which is the chief bathing resort, has become
famed for its beauty and the facilities which it offers.
The Devonport Municipal Council has spent large
sums in the erection of a tea-kiosk, well equipped
bathing sheds and other improvements. The Devon-
port Surf Life Saving Club has an up-to-date club
house on the foreshore, and members patrol the
beaches during the Summer. There are also ex-
cellent sandy beaches at East Devonport, and here,
too, bathing sheds have been provided.
The various streams in the vicinity of Devonport
have been well stocked with English trout. The
River Mersey empties into the sea at Devonport,
and is, therefore, at the visiting angler’s " back
door,” so to speak. In close proximity are the rivers
Forth and Don, which also provide splendid fishing.
The angler may travel over good roads to the Great
Lake, reached comfortably in a car in about three
hours.
Game of various kinds abounds in the country
back from the sea coast, affording good sport for

By car, the visitor may reach, in a few hours,
the famous Cradle Mountain. For beauty of mountain
and lake scenery, this locality is unexcelled in
Australia. A journey of two hours will bring the
traveller to the celebrated Forth Falls.
Other attractions are Bott’s Gorge and Denny’s
Gorge, only a short distance from the town; the
headworks of the Devonport water-supply at
Paloona, and the lovely seaside scenery of Leith
and other districts to the west of the town; also
Port Sorell, a beautiful seaside resort, 12 miles
distant to the east, a picnic ground which is rapidly
growing in public favour.
The Devonport Public Library, the largest
outside the cities, offers a selection from 10,000
volumes, special terms being provided for visitors.

ULTERSTONE
SITUATE at the mouth of the beautiful River Leven,
Ulverstone is favoured by Nature with all the attri-
butes of an ideal tourists’ resort. The town and
district provide a remarkable combination of
seaside, river, country, and mountain delights
which cannot fail to please the most exacting tastes.
Here, one may enjoy the beautiful beach—two miles
of clean, sandy shore, with its adjacent pretty tree-
lined avenue and conveniences for picnickers,
bathers, car parks, and campers—and then, after
15 minutes’ walk, finds himself among undulating
bush and farm lands along the river and smaller
streams.
Ulverstone is easy of access from the
Mainland, from where the quickest route is by
steamer to Burnie, thence one hour’s rail journey.
The town itself boasts many beauty spots along river
and beach, while within easy motoring distances
are to be seen wonder-inspiring sights of Nature
—the picturesque coast-line ; caves, with elec-
trically-lit stalactite formations ; Leven Canyon,
deep and rugged; Black Bluff, 4,700 feet high ;
and a never tiring variety of scenery in all directions.
The launch trip up the River Leven is delightful,
and the reflections in the waters of this stream are
famed for their beauty. Good hotels and boarding-
house accommodation, cars, and launches are
available, and sporting enthusiasts are provided
for by a fine sports oval, tennis-courts, bowling and
croquet green, and a nine-hole golf-links, excellently
turfed and balanced, is ideally situated along the
sea front, within five minutes’ walk of the town.
Excellent fishing of various trout, blackfish, etc.,
is enjoyed in the river and streams. Sea bathing
is very popular at Ulverstone, and an efficient
life-saving surf club has members in attendance
on the beach throughout the bathing season.
No tourist or holiday-maker can fail to be thrilled
with what Ulverstone and district have to offer him.

PENGUIN
PENGUIN has a climate and charm all its own,
and fascinates all who visit there. The main street,
a mile in length, faces Bass Strait, and provides
an excellent promenade.
Penguin is seven miles from Ulverstone, and
eleven miles from Burnie, and there are frequent
train and motor services.
The beaches right in the town afford all facilities
for safe bathing, and a well-grassed camping ground
is within easy distance. There are many pleasant
walks through attractive scenery, and drives
through undulating country of forest and farm.
There is a good bowling green and tennis-court
to which visitors are always welcome.
Some of Penguin's other attractions are Mount
Montgomery, within easy distance, with its wonder-
ful panoramic view ; Underground River, about
six miles distant; and Mcßride’s Creek, with its
fascinating fern glade, can be reached by motor
road, or pleasant walk, of about three miles.
Ferndene is a lovely picnic resort a couple of
miles from the town, where access has been given
to Nature’s beauties in one of the loveliest fern
glades in the State.
BURNIE
BURNIE is the natural centre for tourists visiting
Tasmania in general, or the North-West Coast in
particular. It is only 225 miles from Melbourne,
and has berthing accommodation for the largest
vessels afloat, irrespective of weather or tides.
The overseas mailboats call at Burnie from Novem-
ber onwards through the Summer.
Besides being on the main government railway
line, it is the commencing point for the Emu Bay
railway, which conveys visitors to the prolific
West Coast mining areas, passing through scenery
unsurpassed for grandeur and rugged beauty.

BURNIE —continued
The town itself is most progressive, and is built
on the shores of the beautiful Emu Bay, with a
background of green hills, reminiscent of Llandudno
in North Wales.
Its long stretches of beaches are ideal for surfing
and sunning, and three rivers—the Cam, the Emu,
and the Blyth—enter the sea within five miles of the
town. Besides providing wonderful sport for the
angler with English trout and blackback salmon,
these rivers form delightful cascades and numerous
waterfalls handy to the town.
A Government Tourist Officer is stationed at
Burnie from November to Easter, and he will
arrange trips to any of these beautiful falls, whilst
a striking contrast in scenic beauty can be obtained
by visits to the mysterious Underground River at
Natone, Hellyer Gorge, with its precipitous ravines,
the Myrtle Forests on Snowden Plains, or the River
Pieman via Waratah.
Paper pulping works, on a large scale, have
been established at Burnie.
WYNYARD
WYNYARD is beautifully situated on the banks
of the Inglis River. It is a seaside town, 12 miles
from the port of Burnie [the first port of call for
passenger boats running between Melbourne and
the north-west coastal ports of Tasmania]. A thriving
and progressive town, Wynyard is connected with
the hydro-electric system, and has a very fine
water supply, three hotels, and excellent private
boarding establishments. Perhaps nowhere in
Tasmania is there a town more delightfully situated,
more perfectly environed, more instinct with
natural beauty, more breathing of that quiet, happy,
holiday feeling, than the charming little town of
Wynyard, with its wonderful deep-sea and fresh-
water fishing, its fossil cliffs and bluffs, its rugged
gorges and dashing waterfalls, and its great open
spaces of rich lands. Boat Harbour, Sisters' Creek
Above : The Nut, Stanley [ Sheppard]
Below : Table Cape, Wynyard [ Sheppard ]
Beach, and Detention Falls are beautiful spots which
the district possesses. The Hellyer Gorge, about
30 miles by an excellent road from Wynyard, is
one of the most majestic views in the State, and a
large area adjacent to the main road has been
declared a scenic reserve. The sides of the gorge,
in which the river flows, rise to a height of five or
six hundred feet, the dense forest making the
grandeur of the scene most impressive.
From Table Cape, three miles by road, can be
seen the coast-line from the Hummock Islands in
the west to Tamar Heads in the east. Fossil Bluff,
within a few minutes’ walk of the town, is renowned
amongst geologists and biologists throughout Aus-
tralia and abroad.
Wynyard has tennis-courts, bowling green,
croquet lawn, two splendid and picturesque golf
links, an up-to-date aerodrome, a trout fry hatchery,
and fine bathing and surfing beaches, while launches
are available for river trips and short excursions
along the coast.
STANLEY
IN the far north-west of Tasmania is the picturesque
port of Stanley, famous not only on account of its
physical beauty and ideal surroundings, but because
of its old associations with the early days of Tasmania.
It is situated at the north-western terminus of the
main railway system, on a narrow tongue of land,
on the end of which is the “ Nut,” a huge granite
rock some 478 feet high, standing like a sentinel
facing the deep blue waters of Bass Strait. The
firm, clean, sandy beaches facing the sunny north-
east are perfect for delightful bathing and surfing;
the water is clear and sparkling, and entirely safe ;
whilst all along their succession of attractive curves
are often found rare shells. Here in this quiet,
peaceful spot, “ far from the madding crowd’s
ignoble strife ” and all the turmoil of city life, the
tourist may wander for miles along the little bays

and beaches, unspoiled by the defacing hand of
man. In addition to the scenery, the vegetation is
wonderful; green, sunny slopes rolling lazily
down to the water's edge. Here, holiday-seekers
will find many ideal resorts and ample opportunity
for recreation —boating, riding, and motoring along
beautiful roads, fishing in a glorious environment
of mountain, stream, and valley, and from the
wharves in Summer months for trevalli, or enjoy-
ing golf, tennis, or other recreations, including
game shooting.
SMITHTON
SMITHTON, on the Duck River, is a busy little town
connected with the main railway system, and is a
convenient headquarters for excursions to the little
known areas of the far North-West.
Visits may be made to the Arthur River either
via the Roger River road or via Marrawah, where
there is good sport for both the fisherman and the
hunter.
The forests in this corner of the Island are
wonderful, and the timber industry has been one of
the mainstays of the community for many years.
Many interesting outings may be made by motor
through the rich farming and dairying areas.
THE FAR NORTH-WEST
THIS rugged corner of Tasmania, in the vicinity
of Marrawah, is not as much visited as its scenic
excellence deserves. The coastal scenery is very
fine, and for those who like camping holidays well
off the beaten track this spot can be confidently
recommended. A couple of miles north of Mt.
Cameron West [approached from Marrawah railway
station] aboriginal carvings may be seen on the
rocks near the shore, which, since their discovery
in December, 1931, by Mr. A. L. Meston, have been
inspected by several Mainland scientists, and pro-
nounced of great interest.
