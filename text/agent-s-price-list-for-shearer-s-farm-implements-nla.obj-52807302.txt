Shearer Life-Tyne Combine
Grass Seed Box with Fluted Roller


The Shearer 20 Disc Drill with Cog Drive and Positive Steel Rain-Proof Cover.
The Disc Drills have the same special Features as the Combine, such as
Wheels, Axles, Star Feeders, Patent Wheat Distributor, etc., etc.
The Discs on the “Shearer” can be altered as regards set, to suit different
classes of soil. DISC BEARINGS HAVE RENEWABLE WEARING BUSHES.
This is a special feature of the “Shearer,” as most other makes do not have this
Bush, which means, when replacements are required, a complete boot is neces-
sary, whereas in the “Shearer” a new Bush only is required at one-tenth cost
of a new boot (see illustration).
The “Shearer” Disc Drill is specially suitable for rough, heavy work. Note
the strength of construction and the quality of workmanship. VALUE NEVER
BEFORE EQUALLED.
Shearer Drills NOT INTERCHANGEABLE.
