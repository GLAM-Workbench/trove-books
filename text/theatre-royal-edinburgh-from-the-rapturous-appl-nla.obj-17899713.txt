W. 11.
From the rapturous Applause which Last Night attended the interesting Performances of
The American Indian Warriors ,
In the reviyed Grand Historical Ballet of Action in Three Acts, founded on
The Death of Captain Cook,
Tt will be repeated this Evening. The interest excited by their animated Representation of the singular Manners and Customs of their
Country—The savage Enthusiasm of their Combats—The wildness of their Dances and Songs—The Fury attendant upon their I re-
paration for the Execution of their Prisoners, and the stern Melancholy of their Funeral Rites, added to the uncommon correctness
with which they pourtray the various Passions they are allotted to exhibit in the progress of the Ballet, drew down the most flattering
Testimonies of Approbation from a numerous Auditory. What must add considerably to the pleasure and information to be derived
from their Performances, is, that the whole of the Dresses, Anns, and Accoutrements, used by the Indians, have been brought by them
from their Native Country.
This present Evening, THURSDAY, Oct. 1. 1818, will be performed the Comedy of
The WAY to Get MARRIED.
