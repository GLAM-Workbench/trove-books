Then he leapt out of the house by himself. He was
tired of travelling in his mother’s pouch.


He skipped gaily along picking flowers. He wanted
to find some animal to play games with.

He hopped along till he came to Albert Platypus building
sand castles in the mud, and asked if he could help.

But he knocked the castle down with his tail, and
Albert told him to go away.


Next he came to a L/re Bird dancing and singing,
and asked if he might join in the chorus.

But he made such a dreadful noise that
the Lyre Bird begged him to go away.
