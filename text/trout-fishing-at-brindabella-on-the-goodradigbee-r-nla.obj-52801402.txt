Brindabella on the Goodradigbee River, the finest Trout-stream in Australia.
Brindabella, one of
the finest tourist
resorts in New
South Wales, is
now well known
for the excellence
of the trout-
fishing to be had
in the lovely
Good radigbee
River, which runs
through the pro-
perty, about 30
miles of fishing
being available to
visitors.
There is now a
well-made road all
the way from
Queanbeyan, which
enables visitors to
enjoy the drive
over the ranges
and the magnificent
scenery, as the
road winds round
the mountain s,
attaining an alti-
tude of close on
4,000 feet, whence
it descends to the

valley, Brindabella
being about 1,900
feet above sea
level. Brindabella
homestead is built
on a high ridge,
close to the bank
of the stream, and
the Accommoda-
tion house, adjoin-
ing it, stands in a
fine old garden
where flowers of
all kinds, also
pears, mulberries,
apples and other
English fruits may
be gathered at
will. The river
runs through a
valley between
high ranges of
hills, the alluvial
flats being ex-
tremely rich and
producing heavy
crops of maize,
lucerne, etc.

Brindabella—Lovely Scenery, Ideal Health Resort.
The Goodradigbee
affords every
opportunity for the
dry-fly enthusiast
to exercise his
skill on the pools
and still reaches,
while there are
innumerable
rapids, falls, etc.,
where' every yard
of water contains
a fish, and the
w e t-fl y will be
found most effec-
tive. Large trout
may be seen in all
the pools, and it
is quite a common
occurrence for the
angler to b ring
home 3,4, and 5
lb. fish in his bas-
ket. One of our
illustrations shows

ounce of 3 lbs., caught by two Sydney anglers at the end of last season ; the photo
was taken at mid-day and before reaching home they had four more fish about
the same size, besides a number of smaller ones. The largest trout hitherto
caught in the Goodradigbee weighed 5 lbs., but far larger fish are to be seen at
times —so far they have defied the angler's skill. There have been several heavy
floods in the river since the close of last trout-season, which cleaned it out
thoroughly, and the trout are more plentiful now than ever before, while all the
creeks running into the river, the favourite spawning places of the trout,
literally teem with fish, and the 1909/1910 season promises to be a record one.
Only a very smkll number of fry were originally liberated in the Goodradigbee
and the enormous quantity of trout now in the river, testifies to its remarkable
suitability; in no Australian stream has the Rainbow trout so readily adapted
itself, and, as many miles of water are absolutely inaccessible to the angler,


there is no likelihood of this ideal trout stream being depleted, no matter how
well patronized by the sportsman. Last season as many and as large fish
were caught at the end of April as at any other period, and small fish were
extremely plentiful in all parts of the river, which has been kept entirely free
from comorants, for which a special capitation fee of 3/- per head is paid.
