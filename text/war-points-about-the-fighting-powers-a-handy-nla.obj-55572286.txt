Points about the Fighting Powers.
A HANDY CATECHISM
By HENRY STEAD.
The information in this book, thrown for the sake of
facility of reference, into the form of question and
answer, covers all those points about the fighting: powers
everyone wants to know. It tells about the trade of the
world with the belligerents; gives particulars about
Germany’s food supply, about the rival armies and
navies. Deals with the situation which led up to the
war, and the rights and duties of neutrals. In fact, it
gives everything possible about the war, and is limited
only by the brief time available for preparation and the
size of the book.
Q. —What military forces have the Great Powers?
A.—Owing to the recent increases in all the States that is
almost impossible to say. In 1913 the peace and war
strengths were as follows :
Peace War Complete
Country. Strength. Strength. Mobilisation.
Austria 435,000 ... 1,820,000 ... 3,500,000
France 700,000 ... 1,400,000 ... 4,500,000
Germany 840,000 ... 1,500,000 ... 4,350,000
Italy 250,000 ... 800,000 ... 3,220,000
Russia 1,000,000 ... 2,855,000 ... 5,400,000
Compared to these gigantic conscript armies the professional
army of Britain, 162,000 strong, is quite insignificant. On
the sea, however, Great Britain enjoys an immense supremacy.
Q—What Is the naval strength of the Great Powers?
A.—Several battleships are building in England to the order
of foreign powers. They will certainly be taken and added to
the navy, so that it is still stronger than the following figures
indicate :
Dreadnoughts 22
Battle Cruisers. 10
Pre-Dreadnoughts 40
Armoured Cruisers 34
Light Cruisers 97
Destroyers 220
Torpedo Boats ioq
Submarines 73

If the dates on which “ ships building ” were to be ready
for commission, have been adhered to, the above table is
correct. It is quite possible though that some of the powers
have fewer or more torpedo boats and cruisers than shown.

340,000
Holland
200,000
83,000
Denmark
Sweden
200,000
Norway
70,000
Among the French pre-Dreadnoughts are reckoned the six
Dantons, which are almost the equals of the Dreadnoughts
proper she has in commission. Two more ought to be ready in
September (making four in all). Russia has four Dreadnoughts
due to be ready in October. The three Italian Dreadnoughts
due in July are included in the table. The number of sub-
marines is probably greater than shown, as considerable secrecy
is observed about them. British torpedo destroyers are speedier
than the German, and the submarines far larger.
q, —what are the military forces of the smaller Powers involved?
A.—Switzerland has no permanent army to speak of. Her
citizen soldiers number about 200,000. The particulars given of
the strengths of the military forces vary considerably, but the
following is approximately correct: —
Peace War
Establishment. Strength.
Q. —What naval strength have the little Powers?
A.—Belgium and Switzerland have none. Holland proposed
recently to build nine Dreadnoughts, but she has only nine coast
defence battleships at present, some cruisers, and 40 torpedo
boats, also six submarines (mostly old). Norway likewise is
arranging to build eight great battleships, but at present relies
upon a few gunboats and 37 torpedo boats. Sweden has a
dozen coast defence vessels, and 53 torpedo destroyers, also
three submarines.
Q.—-How do the aerial fleets compare?
A.—No authentic details are available as to the number of
aircraft owned by the Powers. Germany have a great superiority
in big airships and aeroplanes. She has several Zeppelins, the
most successful type of airship, which have a range of con-
siderably over 1000 miles. France comes next, then Italy.
England is hopelessly behind except in seaplanes, where she
leads. The following list gives some idea of the numbers, but
owing to the speed at which aeroplanes can be built cannot be
regarded as accurate

Q. —What is the war about?
A.—Nominally over the demand by Austria that Servia should
punish her nationals concerned in the murder of the Archduke
Francis Ferdinand in July, and agree to certain other things.
These demands Servia has refused.
Q.— Why do you say nominally?
A.—Because obviously these demands were only an excuse, a
peg on which to hang a settled policy of aggression. Had there


been nothing but the punishment of conspirators at stake Austria
would never have started hostilities within a couple of days of
making her demands.
Q. —Why, then, is Austria attacking Servia?
A.—The answer is Salonika ! Austria’s policy for the last
half-century—in fact, ever since the Dual Empire came into
existence in 1867 —has been to keep the Balkan nations weak.
She has always had a hold on Servia, and has never hesitated
to use it. Her dominance was due to the fact that she offered
the only market for Servian products; everything had to be sold
in Austria. Whenever Servia got restive a prohibitive tariff
against her stock and goods brought her to her knees. It
was to escape from this industrial incubus that Servia fought
so hard for a port on the Adriatic. Austria succeeded in pre-
venting this; but, when the second Balkan War gave Greece
Salonika, she allowed her ally, Servia, to use the port almost
as if it were her own. This sounded the knell of Austrian indus-
trial supremacy in King Peter’s kingdom, and meant that with
the world’s markets open to her Servia would develop rapidly
into a powerful state. Add to this the fact that Russia supports
Servia, and you need look no further for reasons why Austria
wants to crush Servia before that State gets too strong.
Q. —Do you mean to say that Austria would risk a European war
in order to keep Servia under her thumb?
A.—She evidently would. At the same time, her successful
action when she annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 may
have made her think that she could again act in defiance of
European opinion.
Q. —But the European situation was quite different then?
A. —Very different indeed. At that time there had been no
Balkan War, nor had the Turko-Italian War taken place.
Russia, too, was just recovering from the Japanese struggle, and
when Germany made it clear that although she had not been
consulted, her treaty would compel her to support her ally,
Russia did not back up her protests with her bayonets.
Q What effect had the Balkan War?
A. —It demonstrated the efficiency of the Balkan armies, and
re-grouped the States there. Formerly each of the four States
were in opposition, and they could be relied upon to check
each other. Now Roumania, Servia and Greece have an under-
standing, and lean to Russia, leaving Bulgaria only under
Austrian influence. This altered the Balance of Power in
Europe.
Q. —How was this met?
A. —Germany found it necessary to make immense efforts,
and by her increased fighting power again adjust the balance.
This concentration upon European affairs has resulted in the
temporary abandonment of the policy of Weltpolitik, which
was so dear to the Kaiser. By the expenditure of huge sums


of money Germany has produced the most formidable fighting
machine in the world, and has made up to some extent for
Italy’s weakness and Austria’s entanglements in the Balkans.
Q. —Kow has it proved impossible to localise the war to Austria
and Servia?
A.—Russia is responsible for the general war, although
Austria (with Germany behind her) is, of course, the guilty
party. Still, had Russia not decided to help Servia the other
nations would have held aloof. Once she drew her sword the
other Powers were forced automatically into war.
Q. —What is the Triple Alliance?
A.—lts actual terms are not known. It grew out of the
Treaty between Austria and Germany concluded by Bismarck
in 1879, a defensive and offensive alliance directed against
Russia. It followed the Treaty of Berlin, 1878, when largely
owing to Germany the Treaty of San Stefano was torn up, and
the Turks given back the territory wrested from them by
Russia, Roumania and Bulgaria. Italy owed much to France
in the early days of her unity, but as time went on bitterness
was developed between the countries owing to a series of pin-
pricks, which culminated when France calmly took Tunis, which
Italy had always regarded as belonging by right to her. This
drove Italy to ally herself with her old foe, Austria, and with
Germany, and in 1882 the Triple Alliance was signed. It is
understood to bind Germany and Austria definitely to help
each other in all cases, but Italy will only be called on if her
allies are attacked by both France and Russia, not if they are
the aggressors.
Q. —Did the Alliance ever lapse?
A.—Very nearly, but it was renewed in 1887 on terms still
more favourable to Italy, who had recently come to an under-
standing with England. The Alliance was again renewed in
1891, for a period of twelve years this time, and for the same
period in 1902, and again in 1913. Italy meantime had come
to an amicable understanding with France as well as England.
Q.—Where does Italy stand?
A.—She dreads Austrian aggression in the Adriatic, and there
is a strong national sentiment in favour of making the
Adriatic an Italian sea. It is openly stated that Italy’s navy
is being built for strife with Austria. In view of this attitude
of Italy towards her ally it is certain that she will endeavour
at all costs to remain aloof during the war.
Q. —What will that mean?
A. —It will chiefly benefit France. It is understood that the
Triple Alliance provided for Italy in the event of war sending
two armies to the north-west frontier to hold the French armee
des Alpes in check. In addition she is to send an army to
assist Germany in the north. Her fleet would, of course, be at
the service of her allies. If, therefore, Italy remains neutral
it will literate a French army at least 250,000 strong.


Q—What is the Triple Entente?
A. —That is a development of the Franco-Russian Entente
(known as the Dual Alliance). This alliance was not made
formal until 1894, but it is understood that about that time a
military convention was drawn up, which provided for definite
concerted action in the event of war. Russia has always been
the predominant partner in this alliance, and has time and
again held France in check. The alliance gives France no
option but to help her ally.
Q. —When did England corns in?
A.—ln 1904 a general agreement was concluded by M.
Delcasse and Lord Lansdowne, which gave England a free
hand in Egypt, and France liberty of action in Morocco. What
is known as the Entente Cor diale followed. England in 1908
came to a cordial understanding with Russia regarding Persia
and Thibet, and, it is understood that at about that time rela-
tions between England, France and Rusisa became sufficiently
intimate to term their general understanding the Trifle Entente.
Q. —Is England bound to assist France or Russia in time of war?
A.—She has no treaty obligations which would compel her
to do so.
Q —How is England responsible for Belgium?
A. — When the final settlement between Holland and Belgium
was arrived at in the Treaty of London in 1839, Great Britain,
France, Prussia, Russia and Austria guaranteed the neutrality
of Belgium. During the Franco-German war of 1870-71 Great
Britain insisted on the maintenance of this neutrality in accord-
ance with the Treaty of 1839, and the two belligerents accord-
ingly recognised it. Great Britain regards herself as still
bound by that treaty.
Q. —What is Luxemburg?
A.—lt is a Grand Duchy, a sovereign and independent State.
Until 1890 it was ruled by the Kings of Holland. The present
ruler is Marie-Adelaide, daughter of William of Nassau. She
succeeded her father in Feb., 1912. She is only twenty years
of age. It belonged for many years to the German confedera-
tion, which was dissolved in 1866. At the Treaty of London in
1867, it was decided that the Prussian garrison must be with-
drawn, and the fortress of Luxemburg city dismantled. The
Great Powers at that time guaranteed the neutrality of the
Duchy.
Q—4s Luxemburg an important place?
A.—No, although it is an important railway centre, hence the
trouble in wartime over its rolling stock. Only 260,000 people
live there, the total area of the Duchy being 999 square miles.
It is governed by a Council of 15 members, and an elective
chamber of 48 members. The “ army ” consists of 150 volun-
teers, and the Gendarmerie of about the same number.
Q.—-Is Antwerp of stragetic importance?
A.—lt is the key of the Scheldt, the great estuary, which is
the rival of the Thames.


Q. —Is Antwerp well fortified?
A. —It is guarded by two lines of recently constructed, power-
ful forts. It may be regarded as one of the best fortified posi-
tions in Europe, and, so long as its sea communications are pre-
served intact, is practically impregnable.
Q.—ls Liege strongly fortified?
A.—Yes. It is guarded by 12 modern forts, built by
General Brailmont. They surround the city at some distance
from it. Six are on the left bank of the Meuse, six on the
right. Liege has a population of 180,000, and a garrison of
25,000. Naumur is defended by nine forts, but occupies natu-
rally a strong position. Huy, between the two cities, and also
on the Meuse, is fortified, but not so strongly. The river
and these citadels form a strong defence against advance to
Brussels and Antwerp, but do not interfere with German
troops entering France through Belgium to the south.
Q.—in what way can Great Britain harm Germany?
A. —She can capture all the German merchant ships which
have not fled to neutral ports. She can prevent any supplies
reaching Germany by sea. She could account for any warships
which venture out of harbour, or try to leave the Baltic. She
could also, at her leisure, annex the German colonies.
Q.—Could the British Fleet not destroy the German vessels in
the Baltic?
A.—No; her Dreadnoughts could not enter that sea.
Q. —Because of the mine fields?
A.—No; because the Baltic is too shallow in many places to
float our greatest ships. That is why the German Dreadnoughts
are all of lighter draught than ours. Of course the submarines
might attack and destroy the battleships, but that is not very
likely. England’s coming into the war limits it to a land
campaign.
Q.—Could the British Fleet not destroy German ports?
A. —No, because the great ports, Hamburg and Bremen, are
far inland on the Elbe and Weser respectively. Wilhelmshaven,
the naval base, is also well inland, and is protected by powerful
forts. The North Sea end of the Kiel Canal is at the mouth
of the Elbe, and is strongly fortified. Kiel itself, Lubeck,
Stettin and Konigsberg are all on the Baltic, and strongly
fortified. It would be enormously risky for British battleships
to venture through the Cattegat (the channel between Denmark
and Sweden) to reach them.
q May the warships of a belligerent Power enter neutral har-
bours?
A.—Yes. Motives of humanity have sanctioned this distinc-
tion between maritime and land war. There is some difference
of view between the Powers on the subject, but in the main
Great Britain’s attitude is adopted. The Admiralty instruc-
tions declare that: Subject to any limit which the neutral
authorities may place upon the number of belligerent cruisers


to be admitted into any one of their ports at the same time,
the captain may enter a neutral port with his ship for the
purpose of taking shelter from the enemy, or from the weather,
or of obtaining provisions or repairs that may be pressingly
necessary. He is bound to submit to any regulations which the
local authorities may make respecting the place of anchorage,
the limitation of the length of stay in the port, the interval to
elapse after a hostile cruiser has left the port before his ship
may leave in pursuit, etc. He must abstain from any acts of
hostility towards the subjects, cruisers, vessels, or other property
of the enemy which he may find in the neutral port. He must
also abstain from increasing the number of his guns, from
procuring military stores, and from augmenting his crew even
by the enrolment of neutral subjects.
Q—How long is it customary to allow a belligerent warship to
remain in a neutral port?
A.—Twenty-four hours after she is fit for sea; that is to say,
has provided herself with bare necessities and coal to take her
to her nearest home port, or has completed necessary repairs.
If two warships of two belligerents are in the harbour at the
same time, there must be an interval of 24 hours between their
respective departures.
Q. —What prospect is there of German warships getting coal?
A.—Very little indeed. Almost all the coaling stations,
where there are coal supplies, are in English hands. Conse-
quently German cruisers in the Pacific and Indian Oceans will
stand little chance of escape. They will probably enter some
neutral port, and be “ interned ” there?
Q—What does “ intern ” mean?
A.—An interned warship has the breechlocks removed from
her guns in port under arrest, and her crew remain prisoners on
shore until the end of the war.
Q. —What happens to a neutral ship carrying contraband of war?
A.—She is liable to capture, trial by a belligerent prize court,
and the possible confiscation of herself as well as her
cargo. All Powers are agreed that all absolute contraband is
liable to capture, but they are divided on conditional contraband.
Q.—What is contraband?
A.—Much difference of opinion exists between the Powers on
the question. Many efforts have been made to settle it once for
all, and, in what is called the “ Declaration of London,” the
powers mutually agreed what was contraband, what conditional
contraband, and what could never be declared contraband. All
the Powers adhered to it except Great Britain. It is binding
between France and Germany, but not between Germany and
Great Britain. A declaration must, therefore, be made by those
at war with Great Britain as to what they will regard as contra-
band, and she must make a similar declaration.
Q—Are not certain things always treated as contraband?
A.—Yes, weapons, munitions of war, and any war material
for use either on sea or land. There is no trouble about that.


It is the conditional contraband that always caused difficulties.
According to the Declaration of London the following articles
may be treated as contraband without notice :—Food stuffs,
grain, clothing, gold and silver, vehicles of all kinds, railway-
material, barbed wire, horseshoes, harness, lubricants, and, most
important of all, coal.
Q.—Are there any articles which must never be regarded as con-
traband?
A. —According to the Declaration of London there are a
large number, but what chiefly interests us here is that wool,
flax, raw hides, agricultural machinery and artificial manures
my not be declared contraband. The Declaration further pro-
vides that conditional contraband is not liable to capture except
when found on board a vessel bound for territory belonging to
the enemy.
Q. —Supposing a neutral ship refuses to permit a search?
A.—She is treated exactly as an enemy’s vessel, is condemned,
and her cargo confiscated.
Q. —How is a blockade-runner treated?
A.—lf caught in the blockaded area she is treated as an
enemy’s ship. If caught outside, after having run it, she cannot
be touched merely because she has got through.
Q. —May a neutral mail steamer be stopped on the high seas?
A. —The question has never been decided definitely. It is
generally understood that thev will only be stopped in case of
grave suspicion of their carrying contraband, or violating a
blockade. During the South African War Great Britain stopped
the German mail steamers “ Bundesrath ” and “General.”
The German Government represented to her that it was “ highly
desirable ” that steamers flying the German mail flag should not
be stopped, and Great Britain thereupon issued orders not to
stop them in future on suspicion only. A very vital precedent.
Q. —What happens to neutrals living in a country at war?
A.—They continue as before, but they can claim no exemp-
tion or protection, because of their nationality, not enjoyed by the
native subjects. That is to say, their property may be com-
mandeered for war purposes in the same way as that of the
natives.
Q—What must a neutral State do to an army driven across her
boundaries?
A.—She must disarm the soldiers, and keep them confined
until the war is over. This happened in the Franco-German
War, when the Germans drove French troops into Switzerland.
Q. —Austria is not United?
A. —Far from it. She is held together largely by the per-
sonality of the old Emperor. She is divided into two kingdoms,
Austria proper and Hungary. To the former belong Bohemia,
Galicia, the Tyrol, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and other provinces.
The dominant race in Hungary are the Magyars—a non-Aryan
people—which long ago thrust themselves like a wedge between
the Northern and Southern Slavs. They number 9,000,000
in a total population of 21,000,000.


Q The Hungarians are not of Slavonic origin?
A. —No, though it is difficult to accurately define what a
Slav really is. Anyhow, the Magyars are not Slavs. They
came originally from the Ural district, where there is still a
similar race, but one entirely lacking in the forceful qualities
of the Hungarians. They are Roman Catholics, and speak a
language of their own. At one time their kingdom stretched to
the shores of the Adriatic.
Q. —What other races are there in Hungary?
A.—There are 9,000,000 Magyars, as already stated,
3.000. Roumanians, 2,000,000 Germans, 2,000,000 Slovaks,
2.000. Croatians and Ruthenians, and 1,000,000 Servians
(that is, 5,000,000 Slavs). A population which may well cause
grave misgivings to the leaders in Vienna.
Q.—And what races 1 ve in Austria proper?
A.—Galicia is peopled by Poles, who are allowed far greater
freedom of thought, action and language than their fellows
in Russia. There are s< ■>e 5,000,000 of them, and about
4,500,000 Ruthenians. The former are Roman Catholics, ihe
latter belong to the Greek Church. Bohemia has a population
of some 7,000,000, of which 5,000,000 are Czechs or Bohe-
mians and 2,000,000 Germans, The Czechs are so intensely
national that they have opposed the German section of the
Empire more and more.
Q. —Who live in Bosnia-Herzegovina?
A.—These provinces annexed in 1908 are inhabited by about
2.000,000 Croato-Servians, although there are a great number
of Spanish Jews there also.
Q, —So that altogether the Dual Empire is composed of many
mixed races?
A. —Yes. The figures are, roughly:—Germans, 11,000,000;
Bohemians, Slovaks and Moravians, 8,000,000; Poles,
5,000,000; Ruthenians, 5,000,000; Slovenes, 1,200,000; Mag-
yars, 9,000,000; Roumanians, 3,000,000; Servians and Croa-
tians, 4,000,000. About 65 per cent, are Roman Catholics, 16
per cent. Greek Church, 10 per cent. Protestants, 4 per cent.
Jews.
Q How do the populations of the Great Powers compare?
Russia 140,000,000 Germany 65,000,000
France 40,000,000 Austria 51,000,000
United Kingdom ... 45,000,000 Italy 35,000,000
Q. —Are there many Germans resident in Australia?
A.—ln 1913 there were 34,215 who had been born in Ger-
many. Of these just over 70 per cent, have become naturalised
Australians. There were 65,000 Germans resident in Great
Britain in 1913.
Q.—Are there many Germans living outside Germany besides
these?
A.—There are 13,000,000 in U.S.A., 600,000 in South
Africa, and some 2,500,000 in European countries. The
majority of these are naturalised citizens of America and South
Africa, but the residents in France, Russia, etc., retain their
nationality.


<J—But are there not many German-speaking people in addition
in Europe?
A.—German is the native language of 5,400,000 Dutchmen,
4,000,000 Belgians, 2,300,000 Swiss, and 200,000 residents in
Luxemburg.
Q—Will Germany starve?
A.—No. It is true that she imports many foodstuffs, but she
is almost self-supporting so far as the absolute necessaries of
life are concerned. Austria is still more so. The crops will
have mostly been reaped, although the corn will not have been
threshed yet, and both the States have stock in the shape of
cattle and pigs to fall back on.
Q. —What foodstuffs does Germany import?
A. —Grain, coffee, butt r and fish are the principal things.
Q. —What is the total value of German jrts?
A. —In 1912 it was according to the latest
German year book. The exports were Not
much of this is food. Her best customer is Great Britain, to
whom she sent worth of goods in 1912, purchasing
,000,000 worth from he in exchange. Her trade with
the other nations stood as follows :

Australia 13,800,000 ... 4,350,000

Q—What amount of grain does Germany import?
A.—She got 7,814,000 tons of grain of various kinds, and
exported 1,936,000 tons in 1912. On balance therefore she
would seem to have to make up a deficiency in production of
6,000,000 tons. It is actually less than this, as she uses nearly
a million tons of this for flour making, which she exports.
(The German ton is 35 lbs. less than ours.)
Q—Where does Germany get the grain from?
A.—Principally from: Russia, 3,753,000; Argentine,
1,211,000 tons; U.S.A., 672,000 tons; India, 656,000 tons;
and Roumania, 605,000 tons. The detailed particulars are in-

200,000 tons of barley come from Austria. She draws 197,000


tons of apples from France and Switzerland, 130,000 tons of
coffee from Brazil, and 18,000 tons of butter from Holland,
and 25,000 tons from Russia; 61,000 tons of eggs come from
Russia, and 72,000 tons from Austria. She gets 90,000 tons of
rice from India; 352,000 tons of potatoes from Holland. She
imports no less than 760,000 tons of geese from Russia. The
most notable import of food from England is fish. No less
than 46,000 tons of fresh fish were sent from Great Britain to
Germany in 1912, and in the same year 633,000 tons of salted
fish were imported from England. Holland supplied 400,000
tons, and Scandinavia 230,000.
Q. —What was Germany’s total production of grain?
A. —In 1912 it was : —Wheat, 4,360,624 tons, barley,
3,880,000; rye, 11,598,289; oats, 8,520,183; whilst she pro-
duced 50,000,000 tons of potatoes. This shows that she raised
in all some 28,000,000 tons of grain, and imported 5,000,000
tons for local use.
Q. —What is the value of the German import of grain?
A. if we deduct re-exports. The value of the
fish import is of eggs of butter
of geese £7,000,000.
Q. —Are the crops reaped on the continent?
A.—Almost all will have been in Austria and Southern Ger-
many. In the north-east, where rye is grown, much may still
be unreaped.
Q.-—Will this mean that it cannot now be garnered in?
A.—No. In Germany, as in France and all Continental
countries, a great deal of the manual labour in the fields is done
by women. Large numbers of Russians habitually assist in the
reaping in Germany, but that is chiefly in the south. The
women will carry on the agricultural pursuits of the country.
It is in the immense number of factories which have sprung up
all over Germany, that the war will be felt most acutely. They
will all have to be shut down.
Q.—These figures seem to show that Germany is in no danger at
all of running short of grain even if she is entirely block-
aded?
A.—None whatever. Take it that she consumes 33,000,000
tons annually, that would work out at 2,750,000 per month.
As the local crop has just been garnered in there will be at
least 28,000,000 tons stored in ricks and barns, enough to last
her for ten months.
Q. —So the assumption that Germany might in the end be starved
into submission is erroneous?
A.-—Obviously. The only country in the world which could
be quickly starved by the cutting off of supplies is Great Britain.
Hence her imperative need for a predominant fleet to guard her
supply ships. The money spent on the navy is practically a
premium for an insurance policy, which covers her immense
overseas trade.


Q. —Great Britain depends largely upon imports for her food
supply?
A.- —Her total imports in 1912 were worth £744,640,600.
Of this total £264,000,000 was the value of the food, drink
and tobacco she imported. The balance was for raw* materials,
which she used in her factories. Her exports were £599,000,000.
Q Where does Great Britain draw her food supplies from?
A. —She draws £199,000,000 worth of her food supplies
from foreign countries, and £80,000,000 worth from British
possessions. In 1912 she imported 21,000,000 cwts. of wheat
from Canada; 18,800,000 cwt. from Argentina; 25,380,000
cwts. from India; 20,000,000 cwts. from U.S.A. ; 12,000,000
cwts. from Australia, and 9,000,000 cwts. from Russia. She
gets butter and bacon to the value of £22,000,000 from Den-
mark, and draws large supplies of both from France and Bel-
gium. Sugar to the amount of 30,000,000 cwts. she obtains
from Germany, Austria, Holland and Russia. Frozen meat, to
the value of 23,000,000, she gets from her dominions, from
U.S.A., and from Argentina.
Q.—Will there be serious danger of a shortage of supplies in
Great Britain?
A. —No. The only things, in a large way, that will be
affected, directly she has cleared the sea, will be sugar, butter,
bacon, cheese, etc. Russia’s supply of grain is likely to cease,
but India, Canada, Argentina, U.S.A. and Australia will con-
tinue to send as usual.
Q. —is Germany dependent on imported coal?
A.—She actually exports large quantities of coal. It is true
that she has nothing the equal to the best Welsh steam coal used
in the navy, but her coal is quite good enough for all industrial
purposes.
Q.—ls France or Germany the better customer of England?
A. —With the exception of India and U.S.A., Germany is
Britain’s best customer. France is the next best, but follows
a long way behind the first three. In fact, Britain’s export
trade to Australia just equalled that to France in 1912. Next
in order come Canada, Belgium, South Africa, Russia, Argen-
tina, Holland, Italy, Brazil, Japan and New Zealand. Not only
is Britain’s trade larger with Germany than with France, but
whilst the latter raises a high tariff wall against British goods
entering her colonies, Germany allows them to go into her’s
free. This has meant that although Britain was largely re-
sponsible in giving Morocco to France instead of allowing Ger-
many to have control there, her trade with that country has
suffered.
Q.—What does Australia buy from Germany?
A. —A total worth £7,153,000, chiefly made up as follows;
—Ale and beer, £125,552 ; apparel and textiles, £1,915,135;

NOTE RE EXPORTS AND IMPORTS.
Statisticians the world over are obliged to make up details of
trade as follows : —All imports are set down as goods made in
various countries no matter from where they are shipped,
exports as goods shipped direct to these countries. Consequently
there is always considerable discrepancy between the informa-
tion supplied by the official year books of different countries.
For instance, whilst Germany actually imports of
goods from us, we only export direct to her; the
balance goes via England, Belgium,, etc., and cannot be traced'
from here. It is the same with exports. We actually get
,£7,153,000 worth of German made goods, she only sends us
direct £4,350,000.
