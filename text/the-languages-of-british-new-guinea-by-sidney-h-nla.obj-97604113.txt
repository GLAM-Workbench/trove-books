The Languages of British New Guinea. By Sidney H. Bay.
[with hap. PLATE I.]
I.— lntroduction.
In the investigation of problems concerning Oceanic anthro-
pology the nature and relations of the Hew Guinea languages
ought to occupy an important place. It is in the neighbourhood
of that island that the chief types of the Oceanic races—Malay,
Papuan, Melanesian, Australian—meet, and it is there that we
may most conveniently study the connection of the various
sections of the races with each other. In New Guinea the
relationship of the Australians to the other peoples etf Oceania
may most satisfactorily be investigated, and there only does it
seem possible to obtain data which may be of use in determining
the existence or non-existence of an earlier race in Melanesia or
Polynesia than that now found.
Yet nothing is more perplexing or more indefinite than the
present state of New Guinea anthropology. Hardly any two
accounts of the physical characteristics of the people agree, the
nomenclature of the races is uncertain, and travellers’ descriptions
of customs and habits are extremely vague. Eecent advances,
however, in our knowledge of British New Guinea have rendered
it possible to use the languages as a basis of classification, and
in this paper I propose to discuss the position of the New
Guinea languages with regard to one another and also with
regard to those of other portions of Oceania. 1 The conclusions
arrived at may not be found decisive by every anthropologist,
but in future investigations they must necessarily form an
important factor and ought not to be overlooked.
An endeavour will be here made to prove by linguistic
evidence alone that the southern shores of British New Guinea,
with the adjacent islands, form the meeting place of tribes
speaking two widely different types of language, one of which
is aboriginal and the other intrusive.
To distinguish the languages it will be convenient to use in
a somewhat restricted sense the terms Melanesian and Papuan.
These are not new to Oceanic Philology, but have been so loosely
applied as to have become misleading, and hence require definition.
They are here used in the most literal and special sense, and the
term Melanesian is limited to the inhabitants and languages of
The relationship of the Torres Straits languages (Miriam, Saibai, and
Daudai) which are usually included among the New Guinea languages, have
been fully discussed by Prof. Haddon and myself in our “ Study of the Lan-
guages of Torres Straits,” part 1, “ Proceedings of Eoy. Irish Academy ’’3rd ser
toI. ii, No. 4. ’’


the great island chain which extends from the eastern extremity
of New Guinea to New Caledonia. With a similar limitation
the term Papuan is used to name the darker and more frizzly-
haired natives of the mainland of New Guinea. If this dis-
tinction be borne in mind, the designation of any language
spoken in New Guinea as Melanesian will at once mark it as
akin to the island tongues, and of intrusive origin, whilst the
description of any language as Papuan will show that its nearest
allies are among the languages characteristic of the true aborigines
of New Guinea.
The languages here called Melanesian are not found in New
Guinea further west than Cape Possession, and even on the
south-eastern shores appear only in detached settlements which
rarely extend far into the interior, unless along a river bank.
In native tradition the tribes using these languages are said to
have come across the sea at some remote period and to have
occupied the villages and plantations on the coast. 1 The name
given by one section of these tribes to themselves is “ Motu,” a
word which is commonly used in the Melanesian and Polynesian
dialects for “ island.” 2
The speech of these intruders is in every essential a branch of
the same linguistic family as that found in the southern portion
of the Solomon Group, in Banks’ Islands, Fiji, and the New
Hebrides. In relation to one another the various dialects are
homogeneous, and all apparently belong to the same stock. They
have the same grammatical structure as the languages of the
islands, and have similar variations in phonology. Their voca-
bularies are full of the same common words.
The Papuan languages of British New Guinea are spoken
west of Cape Possession, on the islands of Torres Straits, 3 in a
few districts on the south-eastern shores, and in the inland
districts so far as they have yet been explored. They present in
nearly every respect the widest possible contrast to the Melanesian.
Instead of the comparatively simple forms of the Melanesian
grammar we have elaborate expressions built up after the
Australian manner by suffixes. Entirely strange features of
grammar are found, and there is hardly any agreement between
1 “ The inhabitants of the inland villages are probably the aborigines, who
have been driven back to the hills by the robuster race now occupying their
plantations on the coast.” Rev. J. Chalmers, “Work and Adventure in New
G-uinea,” p. 84-. In another place Mr. Chalmers notices the native contention
that the Koitapu (or Koita, Papuans) are the real owners of the soil, whilst the
sea belongs to the conquering (Melanesian) Motu.
2 Cf. Samoan, Tongan, Marquesan motu , islet, Hawaiian moJcu, Efate vanua
motu, &c.
3 Since the languages of these islands show decided Australian affinities, it
would be, perhaps, better to describe them as Papvo-Australian, In this
notice, however, thej are classed with the Papuan tongues.


one language and another in vocabulary or constructive particles.
The appearance is presented of various linguistic stocks. The
tribes speaking these tongues are represented as different in
customs, frizzly-haired, and darker than the invaders from across
the sea. There seems little doubt but that they are the true abori-
gines of blew Guinea. Unfortunately, the difficulty of understand-
ing the structure of the languages, and their diversity in vocabu-
lary, have militated against the acquisition of accurate knowledge,
hut quite enough has been ascertained to show their complete
separation from the Melanesian both in structure and vocabulary.
Besides these two types —Melanesian and Papuan—there are
to he found at the Eastern end of the Possession, in the Louis-
iade Archipelago, other languages which are remarkably
different from the Melanesian languages generally and yet have
in many cases Melanesian words and grammatical forms.
Though imperfectly known, it seems possible to regard these as
languages belonging to originally Papuan stocks, upon which
have been grafted in course of time words and idioms from the
Melanesian tongues. Their Papuan origin will account for
their diversity, and the Melanesian element, which is common
to all, will account for partial agreements and show the amount
of contact with the island languages. If this supposition he
correct we may expect languages of a similar character in the
northern Solomon Islands, and such are indeed found. The
languages of Alu 1 (Treasury Island), Buka (Bougainville Island), 2
Hew Georgia, 3 and Savo 4 show that there are in parts of the
Solomon Islands some forms of speech which differ more or less
from the typical Melanesian and probably contain some Papuan
elements. For these mixed languages is proposed and here used
the term Melano-Papioan.
11. Classification.
In the following table the known languages of British new
Guinea are arranged, as far as their mutual connection will allow,
in geographical order commencing from the West. no languages
are inserted in the table unless actual specimens have been
examined, and in all cases the district where spoken and the
authority for the specimen is stated.

111. A comparison of the Melanesian and Papuan Languages of
British New Guinea.
In comparing the Melanesian and Papuan languages of British
New Guinea it is necessary to note that only one grammar has
been published, that of the Motu of Port Moresby. Texts have
been printed in several of the other languages (Maiva, Hula,
Keapara, Kerepunu, Suau, Saibai, Miriam, and Motumotu), and
some sentences are in most cases given with the vocabularies in
the Annual Reports. In what follows the Motu grammar of
the Rev. W. G. Lawes is used as the standard of comparison, but
notes and illustrations from the vocabularies and texts are com-
bined with it. The examples of Miriam, Daudai, and Saibai
grammar are from the MS. notes of Professor A. G. Haddon
and the writer. 1 For examples of the typical Melanesian
reference is made to the Rev. Dr. Codriugton s work on The
Melanesian Languages.”
To exhibit the agreement of the Melanesian languages of New
Guinea with those of the islands, and also the difference between
the two types, it will be sufficient here to offer a few remarks on
Phonology, Pronouns, Adjectives, and Verbal particles.
1. Phonology. —The phonology of the Melanesian languages of
New Guinea is very similar to that of the Solomon Islands, and
the character of the sound-changes are exactly described by Dr
Codrington when speaking of the island languages, he says:
“ Sounds which differ one from the other correspond one to the
other in different languages ; and, interesting as the phonetic
changes are, it is apparently impossible to show a law prevailing
between one language and another. Tire reason for this
probably is that the various languages and dialects have been
brought irregularly into their present seats, not in successive
and considerable migrations from one quarter or another, but by
chance and petty movements of people whose language, though
belonging to one family, was already much broken up and
diversified.” 2 To take only one example from the New Guinea
languages, we find that generally the Kerepunu and Aroma g is
dropped in Motu, e.g. Kerepunu aigo, Aroma gaigo, neck, Kere-
punu, Aroma gena, his, Kerepunu legi , Aroma regi, grass, become
aio, ena, rei in Motu. But in Motu hagu forehead, digit bathe,
gado speech, Kerepunu bagu, rigu, garo, Aroma pagu, riku, karo,
we find the guttural retained in each language. _ Moreover in
the possessive pronoun “ mine ” we find the omission and reten-
tion in the same word, Motu egu, Kerepunu gegu, Aroma geku.
1 A grammar and vocabulary of the Miriam will be found in part 1 of the
“ Study of the Languages of Torres Straits.” Grammars and vocabularies of
the Saibai and Daudai (or Kiwai) will appear in part 2.

A fact worthy of notice is the loss in New Guinea of the
gutturals ng as in sing, and ngg as in finger. These do not
occur in any of the languages of the mainland except in Mekeo,
where however ng seems to be a change from r. The omission
of ng is compensated for by the lengthening of the vowel or
substitution of g or n. Thus the common Melanesian words
langi wind, tangi cry, appear in New Guinea as Idi, agi, and tdi,
hdi, agi, tani}
The compound consonant called the Melanesian q is found in
New Guinea, but seems never to have its full sound kpw. It is
not found in the Western Melanesian tongues Kabadi and
Maiva, but is elsewhere represented by bw, pw, kw, and gw. In
Tagula it is often nasalized as mbw and ngw.
2. Pronouns.— The Melanesian Pronouns of New Guinea are
as follows.
1 It may be noted here that words of identical origin often take in New
Guinea, strangely different forms. Thus hitolo , hungry (New Hebrides pitolo)
appears as mo; utu , louse (the common kutu) is found as gutu, uhu , gu , u ;
tahodiho , west, in Motu, is avurigo in Kerepunu. These changes may be traced
from one dialect to another ( hitolo , vitolo, violo, moo ; kutu , gutu , guhu , gu , u),
but there is no absolute rule. The vowels are usually permanent.

A comparison of these with the Melanesian forms given in
Dr. Codrington’s work show a large amount of agreement,
especially with the languages of the Solomon Islands, e.g. ; —
A few of the New Guinea forms require notice, especially the
plural first person exclusive, and third person. In the former
of these there is a remarkable absence of any form of ma, mam,
or am, which is commonly found in the islands, neither do the
New Guinea words in this person show any resemblance to the
exceptions found in Melanesia. In the third person the lan-
guages of the central districts alone have the common la or ra,
with the personal prefix i. The others have a form of isi or sia.
This word does not appear in the Melanesian lists as a personal
pronoun, but it is found as a demonstrative and is the Solomon
Is. Wango esi, Vanua Lava es, Sesake se. The Motu idia by a
regular substitution of d for s is the same as isi.
The Melano-Papuan languages only partly agree with the
Melanesian. 1
Of these the Misima agrees with the New Guinea Melane-
sian, whilst the Nada forms and some of the Murua show
the pronouns usual as possessive suffixes gu, m, na, &c.
The Papuan pronouns do not agree with the Melanesian,
and show a great variety of forms with very doubtful corre-
spondences.
1 Only the root forms are here given; in the vocabularies, dual, trial, and
plural forms are given, but the difference is mainly in the numeral affixed. The
inclusive and exclusive forms are not distinctly made out.

It is, however, in expressing the idea of possession that the
radical difference between the Melanesian and Papuan languages
of New Guinea is most clearly seen. The former follow the
common Melanesian rule, and suffix a pronoun to the names
of parts of the body, relationships, and a few other words.
These suffixed pronouns are identical with those used in the
islands, and the Melauo-Papuan languages show the same
forms.


In the use of these pronouns, the New Guinea Melanesians
have adopted a peculiar idiom from the Papuans, and use the
ordinary form of the personal pronoun before the name of the
object possessed, e.g. : —
New Guinea. Melanesian Islands. 1
Sinaugolo .. au sina-gu. Espiritu Santo, Tangoa .. tina-gu, my mother.
Mekeo .. oi ima-mu, Pentecost Is., Arag. • • lima-mu , thy hand.
Motu.. .. ia tama-na. Solomon Is., Florida .. tama-na, his father.
That the New Guinea use is probably borrowed from the
Papuan may be seen by comparison with the Koiari and
Koita.
Koiari, ada , hand. Koita, omo, head.
My hand .. .. di-ada-kero. My head .. .. di-omo-te.
Thy hand .. .. ai-ada-Jcero. Thy head .. .. ai-omo-te.
His hand .. •• eke-ada-kero. His head .. au-omo-te.
For the general possessive suffixes hero and te of the Koiari
and Koita, the Melanesians have substituted the proper per-
sonal suffixes, but the personal pronoun is prefixed as in the
Papuan. The Koiari di-ada-kero is literally translated, I-hand-
of, the Motu lau-nima-gw, I-hand-my. 2
When not used with names of parts of the body and relation-
ships the pronouns are suffixed to certain nouns indicating the
nature of the thing possessed, or the degree in which it is related
to the possessor. In the Melanesian languages of New Guinea two
of these nouns are found. One is used only with property pos-
sessed, the other with food. The farmer is always ge, ke, or e,
and corresponds to the Fiji ne, Florida ni. The second form,
used'with food is ga, ka, or a, and is identical with the noun
used in the same sense throughout Melanesia. 3
The Melano-Papuan languages of the Louisiades appear to
follow the same rule as the Melanesian but the examples are not
very clear. In Nada, however, my banana is togu hula muila,
in Murua ag eusi egu, and my mat in Kiriwina is ravioi egu. In
these hula, togu, and egu, seem to show possessive nouns, in the
two latter with suffix. 4
1 These three examples chosen from very different parts of Melanesia show
how closely the NewQ-uinea Melanesian languages may be compared with those
of the islands, and form a strong argument in favour of a common origin.
2 There is, however, a possibility of the pronoun being used by a native before
the noun by way of explanation to one ignorant of the language, i.e., in speaking
to a foreigner, he will say, me, my hand, or me, my banana, in order to empha-
sise the person possessing.

4 Bula in the New Hebrides is often used as a possessive word. “ Melanesian
Languages,” p. 131.

In the Papuan languages there are apparently no suffixed pro-
nouns. The personal pronouns are put into the possessive, and
other cases by suffixes which are often the same for all persons and
numbers. The pronoun is in fact treated as a noun. The fol-
lowing examples of possessives are found in the Annual Reports
and the Reading books :
The full declension of the pronoun (and the noun) by means
of suffixed particles is certainly found in the Saibai, Kiwai, and
Miriam. It has probably not been expected in the other Papuan
vocabularies and therefore does not appear in the examples
given. As it exists in those better known it probably exists in
all.
In the singular number the Saibai, Miriam, and Kiwai cases
are found as follows:

There is no declension by suffixed particles in any Melanesian
language, unless the Savo of Solomon Islands, a language
already noted as different in many respects to its neighbours, be
regarded as an exception. This language has in the possessive
the appearance of a suffix: —
1.. ~ ai, agni, Thou .. no. He .. .. 10.
My .. ai-va. Thy .. no-va. His .. .. 10-w.
Mine .. agnia. Thine .. noa. His .. .. loa}
These should be compared with the Motumotu.
I .. ara. I Thou .. .. «. IHe .. .. area.
My .. .. ara-ve. [ Thy .. .. a-ve. | His .. .. are-ve.
The interrogative pronouns in the Melanesian languages of New
Guinea are the same as in the island languages. Who? being
usually some form of Sei ( dai , rai, led, eai, ked, ted), and What ?
some form of Saved ( daha , raha, rctga, sahci, kava, tavee).
In the Papuan languages these pronouns have (as far as they
are known) different forms. In Saibai, Miriam, and Kiwai they
are declined by suffixes as nouns.
3. Adjectives.—- The vocabularies give few examples of adjec-
tive constructions in the Papuan languages, but in Saibai, Kiwai,
1 “ Melanesian Languages,” p. 561.
2 “ Melanesian Languages,” p. 133.

Miriam, and Motumotu, the adjective precedes the noun. In
the Melanesian tongues, both of Hew Guinea and the islands,
the adjective follows. The adjectival termination ga, common
in the Solomon Is., Banks Is., and New Hebrides, as ga, gi, ’a, a,
ha is found in the Motu, Bula’a, and Sinaugolo, as lea ; au-ka,
hard ( au, wood); povr-ka, rotten {pou, to ferment). The adjec-
tival prefix via is also found in Motu.
The word equivalent to the English “ alone,” “by one’s self,”
is in the Motu, Keapara, and Kerepunu, as in the island
lan 0 ua o es, a noun used with suffixed pronouns {my, thy, his
lone).
Compare the following examples from all parts of Melanesia.
In the vocabularies the Aroma kereka-na, Kabadi sipo-na,
Maiva kipo-na, with the suffix of third person, show that those
dialects follow the same use.
4. Verbal Forms. —The verb in the Melanesian languages of
British New Guinea presents a close analogy to that of the
islands. A verb is distinctly pointed out as such by a particle,
varying (as in the Solomon Is.) with each person and number.
This particle has no temporal force and the exact time requires
definition by an adverb.
The simple forms found in New Guinea are the following:—

There is a general agreement in the forms of the particles, but
with the exception of the Motu, they have not been thoroughly
understood and require further and closer study.
The transitive suffixes, so characteristic of the island languages
have not been noticed in the Motu grammar, but their existence
is apparent in the vocabulary. Transitive verbs have the endings,
a, i, ba, lai, nai, lai, rai, tai, which in form and use seem to
represent the Melanesian transitive suffixes. 1 Examples are:
rogea, to store in a roge (storehouse); guguba, to hold tightly,
gugubaia, to break it by holding tightly ( gugu , to clasp) ; alaia,
to kill him (alaia, war) ; lou, to return, lou laia, to return it;
ahedinaraia , to confess it, expose it; aheqaqanaia, to cause him
to stumble, pipitaia, to wipe it out with the forefinger.
In New Guinea personal pronouns are suffixed to the verbs
as in the Solomon Islands and New Hebrides.
The causative prefix is vaha, va, ha, vela, he. (The mica, va of
the island languages) Keapara vaha-ripa, Motu ha-diba ia,
Kerepunu vaa-riha, Bula’a m-dipa. Aroma veba-riba, Kabadi
va-isa-va-isa, Suau he-ata, to teach, cause to know ( diba, riba,
dipa, isa, ata, to know).
1 “ Lai or rai with the suffix of the person added to the verb denotes the
instrumental * with *or objective ‘ at.’ ” “ Sometimes it means ‘ of.’ ” (Lawes*
“ Motu Grammar,” p. 11). The examples given are Dahua hurilaia ranu;
ia niu ta lau koilaigu ; umui lau kirikirilaigu, which would be literally “ clothing
wash-with-it water; he coconut-one me deceive-by-me; you me laugh-at-me.”
The suffixes lai and rai (in Kerepunu lagi , ragi ) are here very like the
Melanesian la/ci. raJci , which serve to determine the action of the verb upon its
object. Another example given is koau } to speak, koaulaia , to speak of or about
it.


The reciprocal prefix is he, or ve (the island vei). Motu he-
adava, Keapara ve-arawa, Kerepunu ve-arava, Aroma be-gamwa,
&c., to marry, to be husband and wife ( adava, arava, &c.) to
one another.
The Papuan verb cannot be discussed, as nothing is known of
its details beyond the fact of its possessing very complicated
forms similar to those of the Australian languages. In the
Torres Straits languages which have been discussed elsewhere
by Professor Haddon and the writer, it appears that relations of
place are indicated by the verbal forms. 1
The agreements of the Melanesian languages of ISTew Guinea
with those of the islands need not be discussed in further detail
here. They can be found in every section of the Grammar, and
enough has been brought forward to justify the classification
made in the former part of this paper. The argument sustained
by the grammar can be strengthened by an examination of
vocabularies and for this purpose a short list of New Guinea
words is appended for comparison with the list in Dr. Codrington’s
“ Melanesian Languages 2 ” and with my own vocabularies from
the New Hebrides. 3
A comparison shows:
1. That the commonest words in the New Guinea languages
which are here called Melanesian are also the commonest
words in the island languages: —Bird, manu ; blood,
rara ; bone, suri or f/ari ; butterfly, hebe ; ear, talinga i ;
father, tama ; hand, ima, nima ; house, ruma, numa ;
leaf, raw ; louse, kutu ; man, ta, tau ; moon, hula, vula 4 ;
mother, sina, ina ; nose, isu, udu ; star, visiu ; sun,
alo, sina 5 ; tongue, mea, mala ; tree, kai ; water, v'ai,
hex, ranu ; woman, ravine.
2. That apparent exceptions and compounds are also
Melanesian; — Bovorovo for bird is, in the islands, as
well as in New Guinea, a verb, to fly. Nawarai for
moon in Eastern New Guinea is na warovmro in
Malanta. The Sariba ta-moai, man, is probably the
Elate New Hebrides ta-moli, the ordinary man, not a
ta-mate, dead man or ghost, New Guinea tau-mate.
3. That in a few cases where a Melanesian word appears in
1 See “ Study of Languages of Torres Straits,” part I, p. 539.
3 “ Melanesian Languages,” pp. 39-52.
3 S.H.Ray: “ Sketch of Api Grammar,” in “Journ. Anthrop. Inst.,” vol. XYiii,
1889, p. 302, and “ Languages of New Hebrides.” “ Proceedings of Roy. Soe.
of N. S. Wales,” 1893.
4 These words illustrate a common sound-change between the New Guinea
and island languages. By the loss of ng and I, talinga and vula become taia, or
~kaia\ ua or hua.
The island s usually becomes d in New Guinea.


a Papuan list it is always im the same form as in the
nearest Melanesian tongue, and hence is probably a
loan word. In many cases its insertion may be due
to the Melanesian medium (through which the vocabu-
lary was obtained.
Examples are seen in the Dlomara and Mairu words for
bird, blood, butterfly, hand, star, and sun, manu, rara,
bebe, ima, visiu, nina. With the exception of the two
last these agree with the neighbouring Aroma dialect.
Visiu and nina may be due to the interpreter’s
knowledge of Motu, now almost a Lingua Franca on
the south-eastern shores of Sew Guinea. 1
4. The Melanesian numerals of Mew Guinea fully illustrate
the chapter on Numeration in Dr. Codrington’s work. 2
The root forms for the numerals from two to five are :
Tua, Jcoi or toi for tolu, vasi or vai for vati, ima for lima
or nirna. Higher numbers rthan five are expressed by
addition, or by a prefixed form of the word taura,
which may be compared with the Banks’ Island tuara,
a corresponding one, a fellow, so that taura-toi for
“six” literally means the corresponding three,” i.e.,
on another hand.
The numeral for one is in some dialects sega, the sikai
of the islands, with a prefix ha as in the Mew Hebrides.
In other cases the word given is apparently an ordinal,
“ first one,” as in Kabadi Tea-pea, in Efate Mew Hebrides,
pea, first; Motu, ta-mona, Banks’ Islands, moai, first.
The Papuan numeration is on the level of the Australian,
and rarely goes beyond two. When higher numerals
are found they are either translations of Melanesian
expressions, or loan words.
I do not propose to make any remarks this evening upon the
customs of the Mew Guinea races. So far as I have been able
to examine the very meagre accounts which we possess of the
habits and customs of the people, tliey appear to confirm the
distinctions which, based only upon the language, I have
endeavoured to set before you. On seme other occasion I hope
to bring forward some evidence with regard to customs which
will show that the Motu and allied tribes, as well as the
Melanesians of South and East Capes, are connected with the
island populations, though constant intercourse between Papuans
and Melanesians for many generation® have no doubt resulted
in a partial assimilation.
* , Tll at e m>rs w ;n creep i nto vocabularies by ifhis means is seen in Maogregor’s
Kiwai Vocabulary” (Eeport on New Guinea, 1890), where the Motu hanua-
loi is given for ‘ night ’ instead of the native temn duo.
2 “ Melanesian Languages,” pp. 220-251.


In conclusion, two other matters may be briefly referred to.
One relates to the place whence the Melanesian immigrants into
New Guinea originally came, and the other to the direction in
which the migrations of the Oceanic and Polynesian races have
taken place.
With regard to the place of origin of the Melanesian population
of New Guinea, it does not seem possible to ascertain the exact
quarter from which it has come. There is at first sight much
dissimilarity between the languages west and east, between the
Motu and Kerepunu on the one side, and the Suau of South
Cape on the other. Though this dissimilarity disappears on
closer examination it may be stated that the language of Suau
appears very similar to those of San Cristoval in the Solomon
Islands, which lies almost due east of South Cape. The Motu
and Kerepunu agree more with the languages of the Efate
district in the Central New Hebrides.
In reference to the direction of Oceanic migrations the results
here set forth are instructive. If the Melanesians, and by
inference the Polynesians, were immigrants into the island
region the stream of immigration flowed north of New Guinea
and not vid Torres Straits. Melanesians, like those of the
islands, have not occupied the western shores of the Papuan
Gulf.
The classification of New Guinea races proposed here may
hereafter require modification, especially with regard to the very
imperfectly understood Papuan tongues, which may perhaps be
found more closely connected with the Australian than is now
apparent. Their complicated structure is against the cultivation
of any of them as a means of communication with the natives.
Their difference, and the limited area they occupy, act in the
same direction. The outlook for the student is not promising,
as most of the mission work among the tribes is that of native
teachers, Polynesians or Melanesians, whose native idioms are so
very different to the Papuan, that the translations made by them
can hardly be depended upon.
It is doubtful whether any accurate scientific data will be
forthcoming unless an investigation is made similar to that
undertaken by the British Association in North-West Canada.
Science owes much to the labour and care of Sir William
Macgregor in obtaining information upon the languages and
customs of New Guinea natives, but there is still a large amount
of information required. This will necessitate patient and
laborious investigation.
In the Appendix, consonants are sounded as in English, the vowels as in
German. Eor comparison, the equivalents are given in; Nufor, Dutch New
Guinea, Jahim, German New Guinea, and in Buka, Alu, and Savo, Solomon
Islands.
