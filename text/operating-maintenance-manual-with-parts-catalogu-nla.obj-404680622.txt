INTRODUCTION
This book has been especially prepared to cover the Engine Model listed
on the cover and is published for the information and guidance of all
concerned.
THERE IS A RIGHT WAY TO OPERATE THIS ENGINE. THIS
BOOK TELLS YOU HOW.
Guessing how to run it may cause failure to receive the maximum in
performance and dependable service originally built into this engine. Each
engine has been carefully tested and adjusted at the factory before packing
for shipment, and if correctly operated will perform efficiently and economically.
I bis book is divided into four sections, namely:
1. GENERAL, contains information that you should know regarding
the principal specifications and design of the engine.
2. OPERATOR’S SEC I lON, contains instructions necessary for
starting and operating the engine in the field.
3. MAIN I ENANCE SEC’I lON, consists of instructions pertaining
to actual repairs such as are conducted in the repair shop.
4. PARTS SECTION, includes exploded views of the various engine
assemblies and component parts and parts list.
CAUTION!
1. Exhaust gases contain carbon monoxide which is odorless and a deadly
poison. .Proper care must be taken to provide efficient ventilation.
2. Fill crankcase and air cleaner with recommended oil before starting engine.
See that oil level is maintained.
3. Do not fill the gasoline tank while the engine is running. Avoid spilling
gasoline on a hot engine—this may cause an explosion and serious injury.
4. This engine is air cooled. The fan action of the vaned flywheel forces
cooling air between the fins of the cylinder and cylinder head which
keeps the engine at its power operating temperature.
Lack of air due to clogging of blower screen, if fitted, flywheel vanes, or
cylinder and cylinder head fins causes overheating which may result in serious
damage, such as warped or cracked cylinder head, ignition failure, burnt valves,
sticking rings, scored piston, bearing failures, etc.
When the air entering the cooling system carries a considerable amount
of foreign matter such as grass or heavy dirt, the cooling system can become
restricted or clogged in a very short time and regular cleaning is required.
It is recommended that frequent inspection be made during use to
determine how often cleaning is necessary. If this is done, the air-cleaner
serviced properly, and the engine operated on the recommended grade of
gasoline and oil, you may expect trouble-free performance indefinitely. The
life of your engine is in direct ratio to the care it receives.


GENERAL INFORMATION
This engine is a single cylinder, L-Head air-cooled type; bore 2j" and stroke
2". It is rated at:
1.87 H.P. at 2600 R.P.M.
2.27 H.P. at 3100 R.P.M.
2.50 H.P. at 3600 R.P.M.
The horsepower ratings listed above are established by standard 1.C.E.1.
procedures. For practical operation, the horsepower loading should not exceed
85 per cent, of these ratings. Engine power will decrease 3 per cent for each
1,000 feet above sea level, and 1 per cent for each 10 degrees above 60 degrees F.
It is of the same basic 4-cycle design used in automobiles, aircraft, trucks and
tractors. As the name indicates, there are four strokes to one complete powei
cycle.
THE 4-STROKE CYCLE
Plate No. 1
a. INTAKE STROKE: The piston goes down, creating a vacuum
in the cylinder which draws gas through open intake valve
into the space above the piston.
b. COMPRESSION STROKE: The piston comes up with both
valves closed, highly compressing the gas into the space left
between the top of the piston and cylinder head.
c. POWER STROKE: At this point the magneto sends high tension
current to the spark plug, firing or exploding the gas
and driving the piston down.
d. EXHAUST STROKE: Exhaust valve opens and the upward stroke
of the piston forces out all of the burnt gases, thus completing the
power cycle.
Ignition is supplied by a high tension magneto built into the flywheel. The
spark plug is 14mm.
Lubrication is supplied by a splash system which furnishes positive lubrication
to all moving parts. Oil reservoir capacity is one pint.
The fuel tank holds one gallon. The carburetor is float feed type, adjustable.
The governor is of the pneumatic type and is adjustable.
Two valves are employed; one Intake and one Exhaust.
The piston and connecting rod are made of aluminum alloy. Crankshaft is a
drop forging, counterweighted to reduce vibration.
Air cleaner is an efficient oil bath, or felt screen type.
This engine has been substantially built. It is made of high grade materials
by skilled workmen, in a factory fully equipped with the most modern machinery.
Before it was shipped, it received many tests and careful inspections.


OPERATOR'S SECTION
STARTING AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
1. PREPARATION FOR USE.
a. Before starting the engine, fill the crank-
case with Shell XlOO 20/20W for all operating
temperatures.
The oil filler plug is located at the end of
engine base. To open, unscrew anti clockwise.
Be sure oil stays up to top level before re-
placing plug. With the engine standing level
pour oil in opening until it rises to the top of
filler plug opening. The crankcase holds one
pint.
Plate No. 2


b. Fill oil type air cleaner with same oil as
used in the crankcase and fill to the indicated
oil level. Clean out and refill every 25 hours.
Change oil hourly under dusty operating
conditions.
c. Fill the fuel tank with Shell Motor Spirit.
The tank holds one gallon.
2. HOW TO START, ROPE STARTER.
a. Open gasoline shut-off valve on fuel filter
by turning to left or in a counter-clockwise
direction.
b. Completely close carburettor choke by mov-
ing choke lever in a clockwise direction.
c. Wind the starter rope around the starter
pulley with the knot in the pulley notch.
Pull the rope with a quick steady pull to
spin the magneto flywheel with choke fully
closed to prime the engine. Then open choke
about one-eighth and repeat operation.
d. After the engine warms up, gradually
open choke valve in a counter-clockwise dircc
tion until engine runs smoothly with the
choke wide open. Operate the choke the
same as you do on an automobile. (A warm
engine does not require as much choking as
a cold one.)
3. FAILURE OF THE ENGINE TO START
Cold weather causes the oil in the crankcase
to become thick and the gasoline less volatile.
Should you experience trouble in starting
after spinning the engine several times with
the choke closed, be sure to check the spark
plug—see that it is clean and the points set
to .025". If the engine fails to start after a
reasonable number of trials do not make any
adjustments until you have studied the
Engine Trouble Chart on following page.
4. HOW TO STOP.
a. Press the stop switch on the cylinder head
cover against the end of the spark plug. Hold
until engine stops firing.
b. Close the fuel shut-off valve so that gaso
line will not spill out through carburetor
when handling the engine.
5. USE CLEAN GASOLINE. A good grade of
regular gasoline is recommended. Be sure
the vent hole in the top of the fuel tank is
open, for air must enter the tank to allow
the gasoline to flow to the carburetor.
(j. DO NOT MIX OIL WITH GASOLINE.
This engine is provided with an efficient
splash lubrication system which supplies oil
to all internal engine parts.
7. CHANGE OIL AFTER FIRST 5 hours of
operation. After the first 5 hours of engine
operation, drain and refill crankcase. There-
after, change oil after each 25 hours of
engine operation as explained in paragraph
No. 9.
8. ADIT OIL REGULARLY.
CRANKCASE: After each 5 hours of opera-
tion, fill to the top level of the oil filler plug
9. CHANGE OIL FREQUENTLY. After each
twenty-five hours of engine operation, the oil
should be completely drained from the crank-
case. Do not remove engine from its mounting
base. Remove the oil drain plug located at
the end of engine base, and let the oil flow
into a pan or other receptacle. Do not flush
out with kerosene. Replace the drain plug,
refill with fresh oil, and close the oil filler
plug. The crankcase holds one pint.
10. KEEP THE ENGINE CLEAN. It will
pay you to keep the engine clean both inside
and outside. See that no dirt or water enters
engine when filling with oil or gasoline. As
a precautionary measure always wipe off the
fuel cap and oil filler plug, as well as around
them before refilling. Dirt in the engine or
fuel tank will cause trouble and even serious
damage. Also be sure to remove any dirt oi
grass that may accumulate in the flywheel
housing or between cylinder fins.
STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS
Engines stored any length of time should be completely drained of fuel
to prevent gum deposits forming on essential parts such as the carburetor,
fuel filter, fuel lines, and tank.
Such deposits may affect the operation of the engine when again used.
I herefore, it is important that the following instructions be adhered to
before storing the engine:
a. Remove filter bowl, open shut-off valve, and drain
tank completely.
b. Operate engine until it stops from exhaustion of fuel.
c. Replace filter bowl.
d. Leave shut-off valve open.
e. Remove spark plug, pour one ounce of S.A.E. No. 20 oil
into cylinder and crank slowly to spread oil. Replace
spark plug.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
l nless yon have a thorough knowledge of internal combustion engines and
proper tools, we do not recommend that you attempt to make major engine repairs.
I his does not mean that you shouldn t make necessary adjustments and simple repairs,
but in case of emergency we advise you to get in touch with our nearest service
organization.
DISASSEMBLING THE ENGINE
11. fo facilitate the complete disassembly
for major repairs, we suggest the following
procedure. First drain the fuel and oil and
.hen remove the parts as follows:
1. Remove air cleaner wing nut and air
cleaner.
2. Loosen fuel pipe at fuel filler and car-
buretor.
3. Fake off muffler.
4. Remove 2 screws holding carburetor to
intake pipe to remove carburetor.
5. Loosen governor spring and link.
6. Fake off intake pipe by removing 2
screws.
7. Remove 4 screws holding blower housing
and remove the housing.
8. Remove spark plug. Use a spark plug
wrench.
9. Remove cylinder head by removing 6
screws which hold it to cylinder.
10. Remove flywheel and starter pulley nut
(1 nut). »
11. Take off flywheel and key.
12. Remove magneto dust cover (2 screws).
13- Remove 4 hexagon cap screws which
hold magneto plate and remove the
magneto assembly.
14. Remove valve cover plate and gasket
(1 nut), spray shield and breather parts.
15. Compress valve springs with screwdrivci
and remove pins with pliers to free
valves (2).
16. Remove cylinder from base by removing
2 screws, washers, and dowel pins.
17. Straighten connecting rod bolt lock plate
—loosen 2 cap screws—take off rod cap.
18. Remove carbon at top of cylinder bore,
then push out piston and connecting
rod assembly.
19. Remove 2 pin locks to remove piston
pin from piston.
20. Remove rings from piston.
21. Drive out cam shaft (power take-off side).
22. Remove crankshaft.
23. Remove cam gear and cam followers.
Check each item as removed to determine
its condition. On following pages you will
find instructions covering these items includ-
ing—repair procedure, allowable tolerances,
etc., to determine if parts are suitable for
further use or must be replaced with new
ones.


THE FUEL SYSTEM
12. AVOID GUMMY GASOLINE. If you ex
perience trouble with a gummy, sticky sub-
stance with a sharp obnoxious odor, change
to fresh gasoline. This gum comes from
the gasoline and clogs the carburetor fuel
line, fuel tank, etc.
13. YOU CAN AVOID MOST TROUBLE
FROM GUM IF YOU WILL KEEP THE
FUEL TANK FULL WHEN NOT USING
THE ENGINE. If you use it only occasion-
ally, drain tank completely and refill when
tie engine is used again. The reason for
this is that evaporation of gasoline causes
most gum deposits.
14. TO CLEAN THE FUEL PIPE.
a. Close the shut-off valve on the fuel filter
by turning lever to the right.
b. Disconnect fuel pipe at filter and car
buretor.
c. Blow through fuel pipe to clear it.
15. TO CLEAN FUEL FILTER. (See Plate
No. 3.) j
a. Loosen thumb screw below filter bowl.
b. Remove and clean filter bowl and screen.
c. Open shut-off valve to see if fuel flows
freely from the tank. IMPORTANT: If you
find a gummy, varnish-like substance use
alcohol or acetone to dissolve it. (Sec Para
graphs 12 and 13.)
Fuel Filter - Plate No. 3
16. TO CLEAN FUEL TANK CAP. Re sure
that the small vent hole in the fuel tank
cap is not clogged up, for air must enter
the tank to allow the gasoline to flow to
the carburetor. Test by blowing through top
of cap.
17. CORRECT USE OF CHOKE. The cor
reel carburetor setting (see Paragraph 19)
gives the engine the best mixture to run on
when it is hot. When cold, it is necessary
to choke the carburetor to get a rich mixture,
because cold gasoline does not vaporize read-
ily. A warm or hot engine requires very
little choking. Until you become familiar
with the engine, you may make the mistake
of not choking the carburetor enough or
you may choke it too much. If engine fails to
start after three or four attempts with the
choke open, try a few times with the choke
part-way open and then all the way open.
18. THE CARRURETOR. The carburetor
on this engine is of the float type. The
gasoline is regulated by a needle valve. The
throttle is automatically controlled by a gov-
ernor. (Seg Paragraphs 25-26.)
19. TO ADJUST THE CARBURETOR.
a. Completely close needle valve by turning to
right, or in a clockwise direction, as far as
possible. (See Plate No. 4.) Do not screw up
too tight or use force when closing as needle
valve may be damaged.
Carburetor Hook-up - Plate No. 4
h. From closed position, open needle valve
one to one and one-quarter turns.
c. After the engine has been started and
warmed up make a final adjustment with
the choke wide open by turning the needle
valve to the point at which engine operates
most smoothly with full load. This setting
will also take care of starting with use of
the choke.
d. If it is necessary to keep choke partially
closed several minutes before engine runs,
smoothly, carburetor setting is too lean and
needle valve should be opened a notch or
two . . . turn to left. For governor adjust-
ments see Paragraphs 25-26.


e. Ihe idle adjustment screw setting is about
a half to three-quarters of a turn open. Do not
force screw against seat or you will damage
both.
f. Ibe throttle lever adjustment screw is
set at the factory to permit an idling speed
of about 1600 R.P.M. If you want to idle
ihe engine at a higher speed than 1600
R.P.M., turn the throttle lever adjusting
screw to the right or in a clockwise direction.
20. TO REMOVE AND REPLACE CARBUR-
ETOR.
a. Close shut-off valve on fuel filter.
b. Disconnect fuel pipe at carburetor.
c. Remove air cleaner and elbow.
<l. Remove two cap screws and lockwashers
from the intake elbow.
e. Remove throttle link. The carburetor is
then free from all connections. To REPLACE
reverse the operations as performed above.
21. TO DISASSEMBLE CARBURETOR.
a. Remove needle valve, stuffing box nut,
gland, and nozzle.
b. Remove screws and lockwashers from the
carburetor body
CAUTION: The upper and lower bodies are
interlocked by the nozzle (see Plate No. 5)
and failure to disassemble in above oider
will result in damaged parts.
Carburetor Nozzle - Plate No. 5.
22. TO CHECK CARBURETOR INLET
VALVE AND SEAT. (See Plate No. 6)
a. Pull out the brass pin that holds the
carburetor float. A worn or dirty inlet valve
and seat, or incorrect float level will cause
the carburetor to leak.
23. TO CLEAN CARBURETOR PARTS.
a. Wash parts with alcohol or acetone to
remove gum deposits and dirt.
b. Blow through all passages and openings
Do NOT use wire to clean out holes.
c. Replace worn or damaged parts.
Carburetor Float Position
Elate No. 6
iA. TO REASSEMBLE. (See plate No. 6.)
a. Ihe float should he in a horizontal posi-
tion when it closes inlet valve and seat.
h. (.heck the float by inverting upper car-
buretor body and place a scale or flat straight
piece of steel across carburetor float and see
that the distance from the top of float to
carburetor body flange is equal on both sides.
Ihe float hinge tang can be bent to attain
proper position of float.
c. Reassemble remaining parts in following
order:
1. Upper and lower carburetor bodies.
2. Nozzle and needle valve parts.


THE GOVERNOR
25. CORRECT ENGINE SPEED. The speed
of this engine is automatically maintained
under varying loads by a built-in governor.
It was carefully adjusted at the factory and
should not be re-adjusted unless absolutely
necessary. Recommended operating speed is
2000 to 3000 R.P.M. As different types of
equipment require various operating speeds
for the greatest efficiency, it is suggested
that you follow the recommendations of the
manufacturer of the complete unit which
the engine powers.
Air Vane Governor Hook-up. Plate No. 7.
26. GOVERNOR SPEED ADJUSTMENT.
To adjust, proceed as follows;
(See Plate No. 7.)
A speed adjuster is located beneath car-
buretor on magneto plate. To increase en-
gine speed, turn speed adjusting thumb nut
down. To decrease speed turn thumb nut up.
27. TO CHECK AIR VANE GOVERNOR
BLADE CLEARANCE. This type of governor
has but few parts and seldom do they need
replacement because of wear. It operates by
air currents blown by the flywheel against
an air vane blade. It is important, however,
that this vane has proper clearance so it can
operate freely. To check and adjust, proceed
as follows;
a. Remove blower case.
b. Turn carburetor throttle lever so the
vane is in wide open position. This will
enable you to see if the vane clears the
armature core and screws. (See Plate No. 10.
Fig. A.)
c. If it does not clear, bend vane bracket
or file blade. (See Plate No. 10, Fig. B.) Do
not bend bracket too far or it may rub on
flywheel.

THE IGNITION SYSTEM
29. THE IGNITION SYSTEM. The spark is
produced by a high tension magneto con-
sisting of armature, condenser, contact points,
and rotating magnets cast in a flywheel. The
ignition current is sent into the engine cyl-
inder through the ignition cable and spark
plug. The magneto itself as well as the cable
and spark plug must all be in proper condi-
tion and adjustment to insure a good hot
spark.
30. TO CHECK FOR SPARK.
a. Remove the ignition cable from the plug.
Remove plug. Hold the ignition cable ter
ininal about from any metal part of cyl
inder head. (See Plate No. 11.)
b. I urn engine and if spark jumps this gap
the engine ignition system with the excep-
tion of the spark plug is O.K.
Checking Spark
Plate No. 11
Spark Plug
Plate No. 12
c. If no spark develops, check the cable
(see Paragraph 32), and refer to magneto
adjustments explained in Paragraphs 33 to
40.


31. SPARK PLUG ADJUSTMENT. The spark
plug should be cleaned and the points reset
to .025" after each 100 hours of operation.
(See Plate No. 12.) Always keep a fresh plug
on hand. When inserting plug place a little
graphite grease on the threads.
32. IGNITION CABLE. -Insulation must not
be broken or soaked with oil or water, or
grounded in any way where it touches the
engine as this will interfere with good igni-
tion. To check the cable all the way to
the magneto it is necessary to remove blower
case. Be sure that the cable is securely
fastened to the secondary terminal of the
coil. (See Plate No. 16.)
33. TO REMOVE FLYWHEEL. (See Plate
No. 13.) The flywheel is securely mounted
to the crankshaft by means of a taper fit,
a soft key, left hand threaded nut and spring
washer. To remove proceed as follows:
ROPE STARTER ENGINES
a. Remove the blower housing.
b. Bolt or clamp the engine to a work bench.
c. Place a block of wood under flywheel fin
to hold it solid as illustrated in Plate No. 13.
Removing Flywheel - Plate No. 13
d. Use a large wrench, 10" or longer. Turn
nut to the RIGHT until loosened. Be careful
not to break ftps as this will throw flywheel
out of balance.
e. After the nut has been removed, loosen
the flywheel by placing a wood block against
the end of the crankshaft and strike with a,
hammer. Pull off flywheel.
34. TO REASSEMBLE FYWHEEL.
a. Thoroughly clean flywheel hole and taper-
ed # end of crankshaft,
b. Turn crankshaft until keyway is up. Then
place flywheel on crankshaft and align key
ways.
c. Insert key and push up securely into key-
ways.
d. Assemble spring washer with the hollow
or concave side next to the flywheel.
e. Place a block of wood under the left side
of flywheel to hold rigid and draw nut very
tight.
35. TO REMOVE MAGNETO ASSEMBLE.
After the flywheel has been removed as
explained in above paragraph, proceed as
follows:
a. Remove magneto point dust cover. It is
not necessary to remove the carburetor unless
you have already done so.
b. Remove four magneto plate mounting
screws.
.36. TO REPLACE MAGNETO ASSEMBLY
Use same gaskets- between plate and crank-
case, or, if damaged”, use one of the following
new gaskets for proper end play:
Part'No. 11011 - .005"
Part No. 11012 - .009"
Part No. 11013 - .015"
The end play should be .002" to .008" be
tween magneto bearing and crankshaft thrust
faces as shown in Plate No. 14.
Use' lock washers under mounting screws.
Correct End Play - Plate No. 14
37. MAGNETO TIMING. The magneto as-
sembly is always correctly timed with the
engine when the flywheel is assembled to the
tapered crankshaft with a key and securely
held in place with left hand threading nut.
Do not attempt to change the timing by ie-
locating any parts or filing crankshaft tim-
ing flat. Always use soft key Part No. 1201“).
If steel key is used and flywheel becomes
loose it will damage the keyway in the
crankshaft.
38. TO ADJUST AND CLEAN CONTACT
POINTS. (See Pldte No. 15.)
a. Remove blower housing, flywheel, and
magneto point dust cover.


Adjusting Contact Points - Plate No. 15
b. Turn crankshaft by hand to see if con-
tact points open and close properly. Points
must be clean and line up squarely to make
good contact. Do not file points use fine
sandpaper or fine grit hone to clean points.
c. Adjust gap to .020" by loosening the adjust-
ing lock screw and moving contact point
bracket up or down. When proper gap is
obtained tighten lock screw securely. If either
or both points become badly pitted or burned,
replace with complete new Contact Point
Assembly, Part No. 13001.
Complete Magneto Assembly - Plate No. 16
39. TO REPLACE CONDENSER. A leakv
or weak condenser may* cause the engine to
start hard, to sputter apd misfire under load.
If engine misfires after checking the fuel line,
carburetor, spark plug, and contact points,
install a new condenser, Part No. 9016. Both
the condenser lead and armature lead must
be fastened to breaker assembly. (See Plate
No. 16.) Be sure to push condenser lead down
between condenser and hub of magneto plate
to avoid rubbing against the flywheel.
If after new condenser has been installed
the ignition system still does not deliver a
satisfactory spark, we recommend sending the
complete magneto unit including flywheel
to our | nearest service organization.
40. TO REPLACE AM) ADJUST ARMA-
TURE.
a. JCemovc primary armature lead wire of
coil from brass arm on contact bracket.
b. Remove high tension ignition cable from
secondary terminal in coil.
c. Unscrew four armature mounting screws.
d. Install new armature. Part No. 13015, and
be sure that condenser lead wire and arma-
ture lead wire are fastened to breaker as-
sembly. (See Plate No. 16.)
e. Replace mounting screws, inserting one
with terminal of ground wire under screw
and draw screws tight.
f. An air gap of .008" to .012" must be
maintained between armature core ends and
flywheel. (See Plate No. 17.) Gap must only
be sufficient to prevent rubbing, but never
Setting Armature Air Gap - Plate No. 17.
over .012", or poor ignition will result.
To adjust gap to proper clearance, loosen
the font armature mounting screws, slide
armature assembly* up and place feeler gauge
between rim of flywheel and armature core
ends. Lower the armature assembly until
core ends test on gauge and lock into place
by tightening mounting screws securely.
4L HEARING OIL SEAL. A bearing oil
seal is mounted in the magneto plate. Use
a screw driver to remove but be careful not
to damage the bearing surface. ThN seal is
made of a composition and when worn should
be replaced with a new one, Part N 0.9020. I o
replace, place seal in the counterbore and
force into position with a flat steel block as
shown in Plate No. 18.


Replacing Oil Seal - Plate No. 18
VALVES
42. VALVE ADJUSTMENT. (See plate No
19.) Fo check valve clearances, remove valve
cover plate, oil spray shield, and breather
valve. The correct valve clearances are as
follows when the engine is cold:
Exhaust Valve —.015"
Intake Valve .008"
I appet clearance is adjusted by grinding
required amount from the end of valve stem.
End of stem must be square with the stem
proper.
43. TO REMOVE VALVES.
a. Drain oil from crankcase of the engine il
not disassembled.
b. Remove cylinder head. (Sec Par. 46-47)
c. Compress valve spring with a screw driver
and pull out valve retainer pins with long
nosed pliers. Tilt cylinder back far enough
to permit the valves to drop with the stems
clearing the spring. Pry this spring out with
a screw driver.
Valve Adjustment - Plate No. 19
44. VALVE SEATING. Unless valves are
properly seated they will cause improper
operation due to lack of compression, waste
oi oil and gasoline. I herefore reseating valves
should be done with the utmost care. They
should not be seated by merelv lapping with
a grinding compound because this is liable
to create grooves which wear deeper with use
and cause further trouble. To reseat valves
grind in same manner as automobile
valves. I) valves stick they may be coated
with gum or carbon. To remove gum use
alcohol or acetone. Clean valve stems thor-
oughly with wire brush or emery cloth. Also
scrape all carbon from valve ports.
a. If the inspection shows that the valve
stem is badly worn or the seat is too badly
pitted, we recommend sending the engine to
our nearest service organization.
45. VALVE TIMING. The timing of the
valves is taken care of by the meshing of the
cam gear with the gear on the crankshaft.
I hesc gears are properly meshed when the
mark on the cam gear is in line with the
mark on the crankshaft collar as shown in
Plate No. 20.
Valve Timing - Plate No. 20
CYLINDER
40. CYLINDER HEAD. The cylinder head
is held in place with six cap screws.
47. TO REMOVE AND CLEAN CYLINDER
HEAD.
a. Remove spark plug.
b. Remove cylinder head.
c. Accumulated dirt, grease, and oil should be
scraped and blown out of the air passages.
I his is important to allow free circulation of
air and prevent overheating.
d. (.lean carbon deposits with wire brush or
scraper and thoroughly blow out. See that
spark plug hole is clean and that the threads
are not stripped.
48. TO REASSEMBLE CYLINDER HEAD.
a. Use a new gasket. Part No. 11007. If not
available, clean the old one and coat both
sides with cup grease—shellac is not recom-
mended.


b. Replace cylinder head and turn each screw
by hand as far as it will go.
Tightening Cylinder Head - Plate No. 21
c. Use a socket wrench with a handle not
over 6" long and tighten all screws evenly
with a \ turn in the rotation, 1 to 6, as shown
in plate 16. Do not tighten one screw down
completely before the others as this may cause
the cylinder head to warp or damage the
gasket. Run engine two to five minutes.
d. Now tighten all screws snugly (which will
usually be about | turn) in the same rotation,
e. Use a small amount of graphite grease on
threads of spark plug before replacing.
49. CHECKING THE CYLINDER.
a. frequently cylinders that appear scored
are merely out of round or oversize. This
may require reboring and oversized piston
rings and in this case we recommend sending
the engine to our nearest service organization.
CRANKSHAFT
50. TO REMOVE CRANKSHAFT.
a. Drain oil from crankcase.
b. Remove blower housing.
c. Remove flywheel nut (turn to right),
washer, and key to remove flywheel as ex-
plained in Paragraph 33.
d. Remove magneto plate. (See Paragraph 35.)
c. Remove engine from base.
f. Turn engine upside down.
g. Disconnect connecting rod and push piston
down in cylinder bore so it clears crankshaft.
Do not push too far as top ring may become
detached.
h. Remove cam shaft. (See Paragraph 52.)
i. Slide crankshaft out toward the magneto
side of the engine.
j. Remove cam gear.
51. TO CHECK FOR CORRECT END PLAY.
Use a new gasket when reassembling crank-
shaft and magneto plate. End play should
not be less than .002" or more than .008".
(See Paragraph 36.)
CAM SHAFT AND CAM GEAR
52. TO REMOVE CAM SHAFT AND CAM
GEAR.
a. If hand or foot starter, remove starter
assembly.
b. Remove blower housing.
c. Remove flywheel and magneto plate.
d. Use a blunt punch and force cam shaft
out from the drive side of the engine as
shown in Plate No. 22.
Removing Cam Shalt - Plate No. 22
e. Remove crankshaft. (See Paragraph 50.)
f. The cam gear will then be free for removal
from crankcase after crankshaft has been
removed.
Be sure not to get burrs on the end of the
shaft. After the shaft has been removed,
check shaft for wear. If badly worn replace
with a new shaft. Part No. 12018.
53. TO REPLACE.
a. Insert cam shaft through hole on the
magneto side of the engine far enough to
permit sliding the cam gear into position.
Be sure to line up timing marks as explained
in Paragraph 45.
b. Slide cam through cam gear and press
in flush with outside of crankcase on the
opposite side.
c. Install the expansion plug in the hole on
(he magneto side with its open end out. Seal
with “Permatex” or other liquid gasket
material to prevent oil leaks.


PISTON RINGS, PISTON PIN, AND
CONNECTING ROD
54. PISTON. (See Plate No. 23.) The piston
in this engine is made of a special alloy which
is very light in weight. The lands of the
piston are smaller than the skirt to allow for
greater expansion at the piston head. This
clearance is to compensate for the expansion
of the aluminum when hot. When piston is
removed be sure to clean carbon from head
and ring grooves. If piston is out of round
or scored it should be replaced with a new
one. If an oversize piston is necessary, we
recommend that the engine be sent to our
neatest service organization.
Piston Assembly - Plate No. 23
55. PISTON RINGS. The piston rings when
fitted in the cylinder should have a gap of
.007" to .017". The rings should be fitted in
the cylinder below the piston ring travel.
Before assembling new rings to piston be sure
that piston ring grooves are thoroughly
cleaned and rings move in grooves freely.
56. PISTON PIN. The piston pin is a slip
fit in the piston. To remove it from the
piston, first remove the pin locks, then slip
pin out of piston. If pin or hole is worn,
replace with oversize pin.
57. CONNECTING ROD. The connecting
rod is also made of a special aluminum alloy
which combines strength with light weight.
When assembling connecting rod to crank
shaft, the cam gear clearance flat must be
toward the magneto side. (See Plate No. 23.)
The assembly marks on the cap and rod must
be on the same side. It is equipped with
locking plates. The connecting rod is
equipped with a dipper and locking plate as
shown. Bend up locking plate against hexa
gon head on cap screw.
CRANKCASE BREATHER VALVE
58. The breather valve used on this engine
is mounted in the valve chamber (see Plate
No. 19 and consists of the following parts:
No. 10906 Retainer Spring.
No. 1004 Cover.
No. 11010 Valve Disk.
No. 3007 Valve body.
No. 11005 Gasket.
If this becomes clogged it will cause oil leaks.
Therefore, it is well that it be checked and
cleaned whenever engine is taken apart for
service.
59. TO REMOVE AND CLEAN.
a. Remove valve plate cover.
b. Remove oil spray shield.
c. Remove retainer spring. (This holds
breather valve in place.)
d. Remove breather valve and wash the parts
thoroughly with kerosene or gasoline, blow
out, and dry.
Replace by reversing the above procedure.
AIR CLEANER - OIL TYPE
60. TO REMOVE, CLEAN, AND REPLACE.
(See Plate No. 24.) The air cleaner is to
protect the engine from dirt and grit. It
is therefore important that it be cleaned anti
refilled every 25 hours (hourly under dirty
operating conditions) the engine is in use.
Clean as follows:
a. Remove thumb nut and slide entire cleaner
over rod.
b. Remove cover and filter and pour out oil.
c. Wash the filter element in gasoline. Shake
to remove excess gasoline so that engine will
not be flooded upon starting.
Air Cleaner Assembly - Fig. 24


d. Clean bowl and dry by submerging in
gasoline and wipe dry.
e. Replace parts. Fill cleaner with same oil
as used in the crankcase up to the level indi-
cated by mark on the outside of the cleaner
bowl. Be sure gasket is in place between
filter and bowl.
AIR CLEANER - DRY TYPE
This type of air cleaner requires the same
attention as the oil type and at the same
periods.
The fell screen should be brushed free of ail
loose dirt and then washed in gasoline. Be
sure fell is dry before reassembly.
MUFFLER
61. TO CLEAN. After long periods of ser
vice it is possible that the muffler will become
clogged to the point where it will affect the
engine’s power. To check the muffler un-
screw it from the engine and run water into
the open end of the muffler. If full streams
of water come out of small holes at the end
of the muffler, you will know that it is not
clogged up. If the water runs through very
slowly, however, the muffler is probably
clogged and should be replaced.
OVERLOAD
62. TO PREVENT. Always be sure that the
machine the engine is operating is well
lubricated and running freely. If it is not,
it may cause the engine to be overloaded,
resulting in it overheating, losing power, or
stopping entirely,'

DIMENSIONAL SPECIFICATIONS AND POWER CURVE
Engineering counsel on engine installation is available.
POWER DATA
Power curves are corrected to standard conditions
of sea-level barometer and temperature of 60°F.,
and are developed from test engines equipped
with standard air cleaner and muffler.
The "Maximum 8.H.P." curve represents perform-
ance of laboratory test engines.
Production engines, when shipped, will develop
not less than 85% of the "Maximum 8.H.P.".
Production engines, after run-in to reduce friction
to laboratory standards, will develop not less than
95% of the "Maximum 8.H.P.".
For practical operation, B.H.P. Load should not
exceed that shown in the "Recommended Maximum
Operating 8.H.P." curve.
Engine power will decrease 3% for each 1,000 feet
above sea level, and 1% for each 10°F. above stan-
dard temperature of 60°F.
Unless otherwise specified, governors are set to
operate at 3300 R.P.M. without load. Complete de-
tails of installations requiring continuous operation
at other than recommended speeds should be
referred to the factory for approval.
