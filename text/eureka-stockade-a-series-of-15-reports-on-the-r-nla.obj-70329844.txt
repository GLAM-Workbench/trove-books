REPORT.
The Committee appointed by your Honorable House to inquire
into claims for losses alleged to have been sustained in connection
with the Ballaarat Riot of the 17th October, 1854, have agreed
to the following Report: ?
That your Committee considered it necessary to lay down, in the
first instance, some definite principle to guide it in this inquiry; and, after
considerable discussion, a majority of the Committee then present adopted
the following resolution, viz. : ? u That as it is the duty of the Government
to afford protection to its citizens, and as at the time of the Bentley Riot the
state of the law was such that a person whose property was destroyed in a
riot could not recover compensation from the district where it took place,
the Committee are of opinion that all innocent persons whose property was
destroyed in the riot are entitled to compensation.?
That your Committee have classified the claims as follows :
1. Those for property destroyed in the said riot, such as consignments
of merchandise deposited in the yard and outbuildings of the
hotel; boxes of clothing, bank-notes, gold, and other property
belonging to lodgers; saddles, horse-cloths, and sundries belong-
ing to a livery stablekeeper, and for tents which were situated
adjacent to the hotel, together with clothing, furniture, and other
property belonging to the owners, and all of which were either
utterly destroyed or so much damaged by the fire as to be
worthless.
2. Those made by creditors of Bentley?viz., merchants and retail
traders for goods sold and delivered ; contractors for building
and carpentering work ; bankers for overdrawn accounts and
dishonored bills ; workmen and domestic servants for balance of
wages.
3. And those by Bentley and his wife, for the value of the hotel and
buildings, and stock in trade, which were totally destroyed in
the riot.
That your Committee recommend payment of the claim of D. and W,
Wallace, amounting to the sum of �3O; also that of Michael Walsh, to the
7 0
extent of �l2O. ?(See Schedule A.)

MINUTES OF EVIDENCE.
WEDNESDAY, 17th FEBRUARY, 1858.
Members present:
Me. Humffray, in the Chair;
Mr. Ebden, Mr. Horne,
Mr. Barker, Dr. Owens.
Robert Rede, Esq., called in and examined.
1* By the Chairman . ?l believe you were Resident Commissioner of the Gold Fields at R. iiede, Esq.,
Ballaarat in October, 1854 ??I was. , 17th Feb., isss.
2. Do you recollect the destruction of Bentley?s Hotel ??I do.
8. Will you state in your own terms, as well as your memory furnishes you, with the
recollection of the affair, what actually did take place ??There having been rumors that a large
meeting was to be held in the neighborhood of Bentley?s Hotel to take into consideration the fact
of Bentley having been dismissed by the Bench, I feared that there might be some disturbance,
though I did not for one moment anticipate that it would have been anything serious, and merely
with a view of precaution, and not that I really thought any disturbances would take place,
I ordered the attendance of a body of police within a certain distance of the hotel were the
meeting was. I also gave orders to the officer commanding the military to hold his men in
readiness, and I went myself to the Eureka Camp, so that if any disturbance took place, I might
goon be on the ground. The police were sent, but my instructions were to the inspector of police,
that he should not bring his men into evidence at all, that they were to be kept back, so that the
crowd should not be irritated in any way by their appearance, and so that stone throwing or
anything of that sort might not occur and bring on a collision. I went to the Eureka Camp, then
held by Mr. Amos, and whilst there, I could, with a glass, see the agitation of the mob, and I also
heard shoutings, but I imagined that that was merely the effervescence which you very often find
in a mob. After a time, however, one of the police rode in, requesting that I would go down, as
there was likely to be a serious disturbance, and stating that they had already begun to smash the
windows of Bentley?s Hotel. I rode as fast as I could; and when I came to the spot, I found that
one side of the house was almost demolished; the boarding of the house was pulled off, and there
was a large quantity of goods, such as calicoes and things of that kind lying about, which had been
pulled out by the mob. When I rode in they desisted for a moment, and having got off my horse,
I got on to a window frame where the window had been broken away, and spoke to them, believing
that if I addressed them they would be quiet. They did listen to me at first, but then stones were
pelted, and eggs, and little disagreeables of that kind. Mr. Amos seconded me very warmly, and
he being the officer in charge of the Eureka, and well known to most of them, was very well
received. He tried very hard to impress upon them how wrong what they w r ere doing was; but,
however, in the midst of his talking, the back of the hotel was reported to be on fire. I then
ordered the military to be sent for; but, I believe, that before my arrival the officer had got a
message from one of the officials present to bring the military nearer, that they might be in
readiness. I ordered the mounted police to charge round the hotel to keep the mob off it, and
directly the officer who commanded the military came up, I gave him the same directions. There
was a strong wind blowing at the time ; and though I believe I did everything I possibly could
myself, and I know that many of the police and officers did what they could, to stop the fire at the
back of the hotel, we found it was useless, and then we tried all we could to save the property in
the hotel. I think that is, in a few words, the sum total of what I have to say. There were,
of course, many little incidents which I do not remember sufficiently at the present moment
to assert positively, but those are the main features of the case. I may say that I had given the
Riot Act, as a matter of precaution to Mr. Green, a magistrate at the camp, in case it might be
necessary to read it. Had I had the Riot Act in my pocket so that I could have read it myself, I
should have done so, but I had no time to send for it, and, therefore, I could not read the Riot
Act. I was so engaged in keeping off the mob and clearing the people out of the place where they
were getting to the liquors, and where I felt my presence was necessary, that I had not time to
look for the magistrate to read the Riot Act. Perhaps I was wrong in picking out this person,
who was rather an elderly man, to give the Riot Act to; but it was from the fact of his being
rather an elderly gentleman, and my therefore thinking that he would be temperate in his
conduct, that I put the Riot Act in his possession.
4. He did read the Riot Act, did he not??No, he did not.
5. The Riot Act was never read ??The Riot Act was never read at Bentley?s. After the
house was set fire to at the back, and the wind set in in that direction, there was no chance of
saving it; all the fire engines possible would not have saved it after it was once set on fire. It
burned like paper.
Ballaarat Riots.? a.


e Rede Esq., 6. By Mr. Ehden.? Was it the day before the meeting or the same day that Bentley was
continued ? acquitted ?? There was a meeting to be held 5 it was an advertised meeting to be held in the
17th. eb., 1858. ne > hl)orhood of Bentley?s, in consequence of his having been acquitted. Ido not think it was
the day after his acquittal. It being three years and a half ago I forget the exact dates, but I
think it was two or three days after Bentley was acquitted that this meeting was to be held.
7. It was on account of your apprehending some disturbance that you took these measures .
I cannot say that. I took these measures wholly as measures of precaution. I had never seen
anythino- of that kind of an outbreak to the extent to which this was carried, and felt perhaps a
degree of false security, but I took those measures merely as matters of precaution, as 1 should do
B. Had you been applied to by Mr. Bentley at all for any protection? I think, at the
very last moment, Bentley did send down to request that I would put some police into his
hotel ?I think Ido remember that. f ..
9. The police were not under your immediate control, were they: ?ihey were not, tor it
was after these riots at Bentley?s that I received a letter from the Government stating that 1 was
to consider myself the head of the gold-fields, and that I was to have both the powers, civil and mili-
tary under my control. That letter came to me after Bentley?s affair 3 before that 1 could tell the
inspector of police what I liked, but it was very much at his option whether he obeyed me or not.
10. By Mr. Barker.?Do you think it is possible that the inspector of police had had any
communication from Bentley, requesting the use of the police??! would not like to declare the
fact but I have a very strong idea that Bentley did send down just at the very last moment, just
before the police left the camp. I imagine that he sent down requesting that there might be
police put into his house?that is the impression upon my mind.
11. By Mr. Ehden. ?Before the police went up ? ?Yes ; and if I mistake not that request
was addressed to the police magistrate, not to me.
12. Who was Mr. Ximenes ??He was sub-inspector of police.
13. By the Chairman. ?In what position was Capt. Evans ? Mr. Evans was inspector of
police: he was the head of the police on that gold-field. , . . ,
14. Are the Committee to understand from you that Capt. Evans had the chief command
of the police on Ballaarat at that time?? Yes. . ..
15. By Mr. Ehden. ?Bid you yourself give any orders to the police which they either
obeyed or disobeved ??My orders were not carried out with regard to the distance at which the
police body should be kept from the meeting. Mr. Evans brought his men much more into evidence
than I intended. I said, ? Keep them back, so that there may be no collisions; but at the same
time be sufficiently near to act in case there should be a row.? He certainly came nearer than i
intended; but whether he thought by placing himself there he was carrying out my wishes, or
whether he iudged himself that it was a better place, Ido not know. . . .
16 Bid you yourself order any of the police to be stationeu in the house dter Bentley
sent for protection ? ?I did not. , ~
17. Bid you take charge of Bentley?s place ??No; I had no reason to suppose they would
attack Bentley?s further than hearing that there was to be a meeting in the immediate neighbor-
hood. I only knew that their spirits were rather excited against Bentley, and that there was to
be a meeting; held near his house. Bentley did not apply to me for protection ; if he did send to
the camp, which I believe he did, I think the application was made to Mr. Bews, saying that he
wished to'have police in his house, as he was afraid the mob would do him an injury; but in my
own mind I never anticipated anything amounting to the violence which took place.
18. By the Chairman.? Are the Committee to understand that, supposing Bentley had
sent to you for protection, you were not in a legal position to give him protection ? Ii I could
possibly have known before that what took place would have taken place, I would have taken very
good care that he had protection. # . ,
19. But the letter vesting the power in you, as to the police and military, only arrived
subsequently to this affair, did it ??Yes, giving me absolute power; but previously the power of
a resident commissioner on the gold-fields was something very uncertain; you were supposed to
take all the responsibility, but you had not the power to give either the police or the military any
direct orders.
20. Then if you had ordered the police to do anything, they might have refused to do so
if they thought proper?? They could have refused, but at the same time they would have been
liable to the case being represented to their superiors if anything happened; but it could not be
said, and I never could make it felt at all events, that the police weie directly under my oiders
until after that.
21. Is it not a fact, that whenever you thought the protection of the police force necessary
in the administration of the law upon the gold-fields, you did send orders to that eilcct to the
police authorities, and they obeyed them ??lf I thought it necessary to have police in a certain
position, I would say, <c I request you to send such a body of police so and so, but it was cn.tii.ely
at the option of the inspecting officer whether he would obey or not, and he would say, ? I cannot
do it without orders from my superior,? and he would send down to Captain MacMahon for
authority. . . ,
22. Supposing that you had to send out to search for unlicensed miners during those days,
was it not the practice for you to send and say you wanted a certain body of police for that
purpose to go out with your subordinate officers ??lt was.^
23. And they invariably acted under your instructions ? ?lces, always in that case.
24. Bo you not therefore think that if you had given instructions to the police to have
protected this hotel, or taken any other proceedings that you might have thought necessary, they


would have felt themselves similarly bound to obey you as on other occasions ??lf you wish to
arrive at whether I think that if I had given orders that police should be placed in Bentley?s 17th Feb., 1851,
Hotel they would have been so placed, I will say that I believe they would have been, but Bentley
never applied to me wishing that police should be put in his hotel; if he applied at all, which I
believe he did, it was either to the inspector of police or the police magistrate, and that only came
to my knowledge afterwards.
25. What induced you to go up to Bentley?s Hotel yourself on that occasion? ?In the
first place I went into the neighborhood itself from a feeling of precaution, in order that if any-
thing took place I might be on the spot to assist in putting it down.
26. In your capacity as Resident Commissioner at the time?? Yes.
27. And then you went there and found the police in possession of the hotel ? ?No, that
was the very thing I complained of when I came up, the police were not in the hotel, they were
standing in a body at some distance off. When I rode up the people ceased pulling the hotel to
pieces, and for a few moments they listened to me; however, after a short time a number of
missiles flew about my head, and they cried me down. They listened for a short time to Mr. Amos,
when a boy rode out at the back of Bentley?s Hotel, and there was a cry that Bentley had
escaped. This made them more furious, and they would neither listen to Mr. Amos nor to my-
self, but they began to demolish the hotel again, and it was at this moment that I ordered the
police to charge round the building; I also called for the military, and I myself with some of the
police went in and cleared the house, and we cleared the house two or three times until the fire
got a-head of us and we could not do anything more.
28. By Mr. Ehden, ?When you came up to ascertain whether your services were required,
there were no police then in charge of the building, but the police were under Mr. Evans at some
little distance off? ?Yes, they were drawn up waiting for me to come, as he said ho would not
act until I was there.
29. By the Chairman. ?Would this statement, if made by Mr. Evans, be correct, ? I
could get no orders from him,? meaning yourself, ? the house might have easily been saved.?
Supposing Mr. Evans to have said that, would that be correct? ?No, it could not be correct at
all, for this reason, that Mr. Evans was perfectly competent, as a magistrate himself, and having
two or three other magistrates on the ground, to have cleared the mob away from the hotel,
which he ought to have done, and if he had done so at the very first onset, when he had plenty
of force at his disposal, and just ridden his troopers round the hotel, I believe not a single thing
which afterwards took place would have happened, and he had the full power to do it.
30. Then are the Committee to understand that if Mr. Evans had discharged his duty the
destruction might have been prevented ??I believe if the police had been more energetic, the
whole thing would have been stopped.
31. By Mr. Ehden. ?From your not having been there at the time, it would be impossible
for you to speak from your own knowledge whether he did or did not exercise at the moment a
sufficient control ??I can only say from what took place afterwards. I know at the time I went
up, the police, instead of being inactive, ought to have been active.
32. By the Chairman. ?What leads you to suppose that Mr. Evans could have saved the
building if he had exercised due diligence?? From what I heard from other members of the
Government service up there, who were of opinion that if energy had been shown in the first
instance, when only a few boys began pelting stones at the windows, and if then the police had
quietly walked in between the hotel and the crowd without any further demonstration the
building would have been saved. I could not say that positively myself, because I was not there
at the moment.
33. By Mr. Horne. ?Would you be good enough to give the Committee the names of
those persons who so informed you? ?I think one was a person of the name of Mr. George
Webster who was at the time commissary at the camp ; I think I may safely say that he was one,
I am certain he was present because I saw him; and I may mention another, who I think I can
have no doubt about, that is Mr. Amos, the present warden at Creswick, in fact I am more
certain of him than of Mr. Webster.
34. As regards the activity or otherwise of the police you are speaking from information
gathered from those gentlemen?? Not only from those gentlemen, but I speak from what was
generally said.
35. Those are the two prominent parties ? ?No, it could not have been so with regard to
Mr. Amos, because he rode up with me, but that was his feeling and mine too, that had the
police stepped in, in the first instance, the mischief could have been prevented.
36. Your own opinion is but an impression, but you stated to the Committee that you
were confirmed in that opinion by the remarks of others who were on the spot; my reason for
asking for the names of those gentlemen is, that the Committee will be able to call them and get
their evidence with reference to the affair because yours amount only to heresay evidence ??I
think I may safely say that one of the police officers, Captain Carter, now the Adjutant of the
Geelong Rifle Corps, expressed himself in the same way, and I know he was present.
37. By Mr. Ehden. ?When you arrived and found that the work of destruction was
actually going on, were the police at that time quite inactive??My impression is so, and I
believe I am perfectly right in saying that they were drawn up in a body rather to the right of
where I was standing, that is rather to the rear of the building on the right side.
38. By the Chairman. ?Then, are the Committee to understand that what you complain
of, with regard to the police, is twofold, first that they put themselves too prominently forward
before the row commenced, and that when it did commence they did not exercise that necessary
vigilance which they ought to have done for the protection of the property ??I remember my saying
3


R 'cwHmied CL> ? n �f come so near/? but then nothing resulted from their coming so near. I
nth Feb., 1906. merely mentioned this when I was speaking of the precautions I had taken, but no harm resulted
from their being so near, and the fact of their being so near ought to have served for the better
preservation of the place as it turned out.
89. What you complain of in the second instance is not that they were too near, but that
when the row commenced they did not use sufficient vigilance to protect the property ??That
they were not sufficiently active.
40. By Mr. Ebden. ?Did you stay there long enough to see the activity displayed by
the police ? ?I was there until the place was burned down.
41. What did the police do during that time?? When I came up and called upon the
police to act, they rode round the building and did perhaps what they could then, which was
literally nothing else but to save the furniture and effects brought out. The building was on fire
and before jthe soldiers came up, I had, with the assistance of Mr. Amos and one or two others,
cleared the bar, coming in some cases to rather personal encounters ?the soldiers cleared the place
afterwards, but it was impossible to put out the fire. As soon as I called upon the police to come
on they came on willingly enough, but what I complain of is, not of what they did, but of what
they did not.
42. By the Chairman.? lt is alleged that Mr. Evans stated to Bentley ?Do not blame
me Bentley, Mr. Bede was the magistrate; I could get no orders from him ; the house might
easily have been saved.? That is alleged by Bentley in his written statement put before the
Committee as words having come from Mr. Evans to him at the time ??Then I think with regard
to that, it is sufficient to say, that Mr. Evans was there as being the inspector of police ; and
as a magistrate and having the police immediately under his orders he ought to have put the
thing down in the very first instance without any orders; supposing he had none, but I distinctly
deny that he wanted orders from me, because he was placed there for the express purpose ?for
what else could he have been placed there but to prevent the demolition of the property.
48. By Mr. Horne. ?In your judgment, and it appears that you were on the ground during
the whole time, is the destruction of this property in any way to be attributed to the imperfect or
negligent action of the police??l was not on the ground the whole time; when I came up the
hotel was partly demolished; but I must say, that my impression was, from what I saw and what
I heard afterwards, that had the police acted with energy in the first instance, when the mob began
pelting the hotel with stones, the hotel miuht have been saved,
44. Then is it your opinion that if the police had discharged their duty, what ultimately
took place would not have taken place?? That is my opinion certainly.
45. Was this property at any time within your knowledge in charge of the police, or in
charge of any party belonging to the Government, for preservation ??lt was by my instructions
the property was brought out of the hotel.
46. My question refers to the building which was destroyed, was that at any time under
the charge of the police, or in the charge of the Government for protection ??Not before it was
attacked, or if there were police in the place, I was not aware of it,
47. By Mr. Marker ?There might have been police there without your knowledge??l
hardly think there could have been police in the house without my knowledge.
48. By Mr. Horne ?My question was simply to this effect, whether at any time this
property was in the custody of the Government, either by the police, or the military, or in any
other way, previous to its destruction by fire ??Previous to the destruction by fire it was not.
49. But after certain property was brought out, which was saved from the fire, was that
retained in the custody of the police p?It was.
50. By the Chairman. ?Do you know of your own knowledge that Mr. Ximenes, as sub-
inspector of police at the time under the direction of Mr. Evans, was in charge of the hotel, or
was there with a police force ? ?I am not aware of that at the present moment. I have a glim-
mering idea that there was some talk of some of the police being present in the hotel; but my
impression is, that there was a wish expressed as to some being placed there, but that they were
not there. I can almost positively declare that there were no police in the hotel when I came up.
51. You found them drawn up as you have previously described?? What I saw of the
police was, that they were at the right and rear of the building.
52. You can state positively that there were none brought there by your orders ??There
were none placed in the hotel by my orders.
58. And if they were so placed there it was done without your knowledge or authority??
If they were so placed there I have no remembrance of it at present.
54. Did you order Mr. Evans to be on the spot with his men ??ln the neighborhood
certainly.
55 Do not you think from the practice which obtained on the gold-fields at that time,
that Mr. Evans would wait for subsequent directions from you ? ?Mr. Evans was perfectly aware
at what place I should be found; he knew I had gone to the Eureka Camp to be in the
neighborhood. My only reason for going there was, that I might be near; and, at the same time,
I did not want too many officials to be on the ground for fear of bringing them into collision
with the mob.
56. Under the course of proceeding then obtaining on the gold-fields, do you think it
likely that Mr. Evans would act without instructions from you ??I am very sure he should have
done so. He had no right to wait for any instructions from me when it was to keep the public
peace.
57. Then you are of opinion, that he not only had authority to act, but that it was his


duty to have acted ??lt was his duty to have acted, decidedly. If he was going to apprehend as. Rede, Esq�,
man he would not send to me to know if he should do it. iTth^^iws.
58. By Mr. Ehden . ?You say that you have an impression, or a sort of recollection, that
you heard at the time that Bentley had sent to the camp, asking for protection to be sent down,
can you say to whom that application would have been made ??I think the probability is that it
would have been made to Mr. Evans, as being the inspector of police.
The witness withdrew.
Adjourned to Friday next at three o'clock.
TUESDAY, 23rd FEBRUARY, 1858.
Members ?present:
Mr. Humffray, in the Chair;
Mr. D. S. Campbell, Mr. Horne,
Mr. Ebden, Dr. Owens.
Gilbert Andrew Amos, Esq., called in and examined.
59. By the Chairman. ? The Committee are anxious to hear from you all that you can G. A. Amos, Esc,,
recollect about what took place at the period of the riots at Bentley?s Hotel, as to what circum- 231( * I,eb ?? 1858
stances came under your observation and within the range of your notice, more especially with ?
regard to the police, as to what part they took in the matter ??Somewhere about three o?clock
in the afternoon of the day on which the affair took place?l forget the date
60. The 17th October ??Mr. Rede, who was the officer in charge of the Ballaarat
district, came over to my camp?l was in charge of the Eureka district, subdivision of the
Ballaarat district?and told me there was a disturbance expected to take place at Bentley?s
Hotel. There had been considerable excitement brewing for some time in connection with a
case of manslaughter there, supposed to be murder at the time. I had a telescope which I lent
to Mr. Rede, for the purpose of seeing what was taking place at the hotel. My camp was
situated nearly a quarter of a mile from Bentley?s Hotel, but we could see indistinctly, and we
saw there was considerable excitement going on. We mounted our horses and proceeded
towards the crowd, and on our arrival there we found a number of infuriated diggers ; the
precise reason not transpiring. There was a great deal of clamor and excitement going on,
and the diggers seemed to be of opinion that Bentley had escaped justice, and that he was
secreted in the hotel, and they wished to get hold of him ; I think, as far as I recollect, either
for the purpose of handing him over to justice, or to inflict summary justice upon him ; it is
three years and a half ago, and it is rather difficult to remember precisely. Mr. Rede, in his
capacity as chief magistrate of the district, took a position at one of the windows, being an
elevated position from whence to address the mob, in order to try and quiet them, and pacify
them. On this, they listened for a short time, and then began to pelt him with quartz and
other things ; and I seeing this, having been an older inhabitant of the district than Mr. Rede,
and being personally known to a number of the miners, I jumped up by his side, thinking my
presence might protect him, who was less known. It had the desired effect. I then
addressed the mob, and told them exactly, as far as I knew, what was the case, and that
justice, of course, would overtake Bentley?who was the proprietor of the hotel. They
appeared very quiet for some time. I could remember one man among them, who was
particularly energetic about that time, and who, I think, would afford the Committee a great
deal of evidence, a Mr. Mclntyre ; he was afterwards tried for having been there at the time of
the disturbance. At the time I was addressing them some person came out of a court-yard,
apparently from the back of the hotel?but being rather behind me I could not see exactly from
where he came?and fired off a pistol; there was a shout to the effect that this was Bentley
endeavoring to make his escape. The number assembled in front of the hotel was about 4,000,
as far as we could make out, and about half left to see if this was Bentley or not, and if so to
capture him ; the remainder stopped ; but this half got into the court-yard at the back of the
hotel, and in the course of five minutes there was a cry that the hotel was on fire. A portion
of the mob had evidently set fire to this hotel, which was a wooden building, and very
susceptible to take fire, and capable of burning with great ease if anything inflammable were
put near it. I remember little more positively. For the space of the next quarter of an hour
there was great excitement, and the next thing that I remember doing was trying to save
some of the property of the hotel. I found a great number of people very excited indeed ; the
miners not contented with the sure process of fire, were also hurling huge pieces of quartz into
the bar, which was very well fitted up, the furniture being very good : there was a handsome
chandelier, and altogether it was well fitted up. I endeavored to stop this, and exposed myself
in front of the bar, till four of the miners took hold of me, and carried me bodily away. They
said they did not wish to hurt me, nor any other person, but they were determined to destroy
the hotel. Mr. Green, who was a magistrate and sub-treasurer at that time, was instructed by
Mr. Rede to be on the ground in his capacity of Justice of the Peace to act in case any
disturbance should take place, and he was instructed to provide himself with a copy of the
Ballaarat Riots.? b.


g. a. Amos, Esq., Riot Act to read in case of necessity. This I remember having been told. Ido not know it
23rd�Feb.ri858. from my own personal knowledge.
61. Do you know whether Mr. Green did read the Riot Act ??Mr. Green did not read
the Riot Act to my knowledge. Fresh excitement followed so fast upon that which had
previously taken place that he had no time, and constitutionally he was not at all a person who
would have been up to any great emergency under such circumstances.
62. Had you charge of any of the police for that day ? ?Mr. Evans was the inspector of
police at Ballaarat and the sub-inspector of police of my division was Captain Carter.
63. Then do you happen to know of your own knowledge what police arrangements
were made, if any, to protect the hotel that day ??There were a great number of police riding
backwards and forwards, but I am inclined to think, speaking of my personal impression, that
the police did not show great energy on the occasion.
64. From what you saw ? ?From what I saw, that was a point of condemnation at that
particular time.
65. Provided they had shown more energy what do you think would have been the
result ??-I cannot possibly say, for the simple reason that I was not the officer of the police, I
was merely assisting. Captain Carter is in the next room and can give the Committee
information from what he saw himself.
66. I merely wish to ascertain from you, so far as your own observation guided you on
the occasion and your recollection, whether you think the police might, in fact, have prevented
the destruction of the hotel, had they displayed more energy ? ?On one or two occasions I have
seen similar instances of great excitement amongst the multitude, unfortunately once since that,
and on one or two former occasions, and it is almost impossible to form an opinion of how
many men might resist an excited multitude. The number of available police could not have
come to fifty, and the number of the mob was 4000, and it depends on the state of excite-
ment the mob are in.
67. By Mr. Ehden. ?Are you aware of any message having been sent to the Eureka
Camp, by Bentley, asking for the assistance of the police ? ?No.
68. By the Chairman. ?The Eureka Camp was Mr. Rede?s ?the Commissioner?s Camp F
Yes.
69. Provided any application had been made by Mr. Bentley would he have sent there
or to the chief camp ??I cannot answer. There is no doubt the largest police force was at
the Ballaarat Camp and the smaller one at the Eureka. I should have sent to both perhaps,
but I do not know what the arrangements were that day. I can tell you further about the
military who were called in shortly afterwards ; after the hotel was inevitably on fire
the military came. Some had been stationed, or had come up, very recently within
a short distance of the hotel. So far as I can remember, in the course of about
twenty minutes from the actual firing of the hotel, military were placed in the front
approaches to the hotel, in the front rooms to the hotel, and encircled the hotel as far as their
number would admit, and had the people supported at all, I might say, that that would have
had the effect of stopping the fire, for the simple reason, that the fire was put out several times
during the time they were there, in some places, but set fire to in others ; they were a small
body, not above eighty at the extreme, and through their ranks men passed between and added
fresh fuel to the fire and they took parts that were blazing from one place and put them to
another; one man I saw run up to a soldier and wrest his musket out of his hand. A great
many fires I put out myself, but as fast as they were put out they were lighted again. I
remember some buildings near that were saved.
70. Do you remember the case of Welsh, I think I saw you assist the poor woman
whose house was burnt down over her head ? ?I recollect the woman.
71. You do not recollect the name ? ?No.
72. Those parties have sent in a claim, and I recollect distinctly seeing you assist that
poor woman away when her house was burnt down ? ?That house was gutted entirely. I
carried her and the children I think, just as the house was burning 3 I thought she was dying
at the time.
73. She was in the pains of labor ??Yes. I could tell about another building?kept by
a chemist I fancy.
74. Mr. Anderson ??lt was a corner house. Dr. Carr?s house was not burnt, there was
no damage sustained ; I was then present, and I saved the house myself and no damage what-
ever was done to it. We got wet blankets and put them on the top.
75. By Mr. Ehden. ?Are you aware from your own knowledge, whether the police
were at any time in charge of this building ??I am not aware of my own knowledge.
76. When you came up where were the police at the time ??I cannot tell you.
77. Were they inside the house ??I cannot tell you ; I came up in a time of great
excitement, and the first thing I did was to get up to the window and address the people.
The witness withdrew.
Charles Jeffreys Carter, Esq., called in and examined.
c. J. Carter, Esq., 78. By the Chairman. ? What official position did you occupy during the time of the
23rd Feb., 1838. riots at Bentley?s Hotel ? ?Sub-inspector of police.
79. Would you be kind enough to state as shortly as possible what you recollect of the
police arrangements for that day with regard to Bentley?s Hotel ??We were given to understand


a meeting would take place of the diggers in consequence of the death of one supposed to have c. J. Carter, Esq.
been killed by Bentley and we were ordered to attend. tarTreS.^ssa.
80. Who ordered you to attend ??Mr. Evans, my inspector, who was the inspector of
police ; I attended, and after the meeting had taken place and some of them had harangued the
mob they went over towards Bentley?s Hotel and I followed.
81. Will you state what instructions were given to you when you went down with the
police force ? ?I had no police under my command then. I was stationed at the Eureka with
Mr. Amos, but I was desired not to bring my men with me, I only had five or six. I went
down there and saw the whole of the riot from the very commencement. After the people
had been throwing stones and breaking the windows, and attempting to pull down the house,
in fact, I rode up to Mr. Evans and asked if he intended to allow the men to pull down the
house. I got no reply, and I think three several times I asked him the same question, ?Are
you going to allow these fellows to pull down the house,? and I could get no answer. lam
firmly convinced that had the police been ordered to do their duty, the house would not have
been burnt down. We had plenty of police there to prevent it. It wanted a little determination
on the part of Mr. Evans.
82. And notwithstanding you pointed out that to him he absolutely refused ??I could
get no order. Mr. Ximenes was there : he stood in the doorway while the stones were being
thrown, and the windows smashed about him, but of course he could do nothing, because
Mr. Evans was our senior and we waited for orders, and got none.
83. You were not authorized to act except under his orders? ?Not while the senior
officer was present.
84. Then in your own words you are firmly convinced that had the police used sufficient
energy the house would have been saved?? Yes, for the time.
85. By Mr, Ehden. ?Are you still in the police??No, I am adjutant of the Geelong
Volunteer Rifles. lam still in the public service.
86. You say you were not in charge of any portion of the body of police at that time
stationed there ??No, I had no men under me.
87. You were stationed at the Eureka Camp ? ?Yes.
88 Was any application made to you from Mr. Bentley for protection ??I received
orders from Mr. Evans to have my men patrolling, but I myself was in front of Bentley?s Hotel
during the whole time that the riots were taking place.
89. Were the police in charge of the building ? ?Yes.
90. How P ?Mr. Ximenes was standing in the doorway.
91. Where were the police??A portion of the foot police were inside under
Mr. Ximenes? charge, and the mounted police were outside. I sat on my horse, and was power-
less of course, Mr. Evans being there.
92. Were you on the ground before Mr. Amos arrived? ?I was. I saw him arrive, and
Mr. Rede get up into the window and attempt to pacify the mob; and first an egg was
thrown, and then after that stones, and bottles, and bricks were thrown, so that he was obliged
to leave that; and shortly after the house was set on fire, and the military came up.
The witness withdrew,
Mr. George Crossley Smith called in and examined.
93. By the Chairman, This document which you have laid before the Committee Mr. g. c. Smith,
purports to be a statement of the goods which you alleged were lost on the occasion of the riot 23rd Feb ?? 18o8 ?
at Bentley?s Hotel? ?It does.
94. Could you supply the Committee with any corroborative evidence as to the fact that
you did lose those goods at that time??l can.
95. What is the nature of that evidence?? One of the domestics of the house, whom
you can have to examine.
96. Is she here now ??She is.
97. How did she know that you had these things?? She did not know the specific
number of articles, but she was present when I was selling some articles of this description?
electro-plated sugar tongs and other things?to Mrs. Bentley. She was nursemaid, and she was
the party who had my two portmanteaus in her charge in Mr. and Mrs. Bentley?s bedroom.
98. By Mr, D. S. Campbell. ?She cannot exactly prove that those things were in the
portmanteaus as set forth in that list ??That is an impossibility ; but I have the inventory,
which I made at the time, of the property I left there, which I can produce.? \_The witness
produced the same and handed it to the Chair man .]
99. Where were you at the time this fire took place ??I believe I was on the Avoca.
I went out prospecting, and I left this property with Mr. Bentley, and took the inventory
which I have produced. The only evidence I can give in the matter are Mr. and Mrs. Bentley,
and this domestic, who was nursemaid there.
100. By the Chairman, ?What does this paper produced by you purport to be ??lt is an
inventory without the prices. Those prices put here?[ ( pointing to the other document] ?are
what I paid for them; but, unfortunately, every paper was burnt, the invoices and everything.
101. By Dr. Owens. ?What business were you following then??l was then going out
prospecting.
102. What business were you in at the time ??That is a lot of goods that I brought
from home. I came out here for the express purpose of going to the diggings?l and my


Mr. g. c. Smith, brother ; and as I was going up to the Ovens I had the misfortune to have my left arm smashed
to pieces, and I lay at Mr. Bignell?s for some time. My brother and myself bought �5OO
worth of jewellery in Cornhill, London, and this is the residue.
103. You brought these things out for the purpose of trading ??Yes, with the exception
of the clothing.
104. Have you any person here who could support your statement that you brought
these things out from England ? ?I have not.
105. No person who is at all acquainted with the fact of your having such property in
your possession here before you went up to Ballaarat ? ?I do not know whether I could get
evidence of that kind I am sure.
106. By the Chairman. ?What you state, that this servant girl can prove, is simply, that
she saw you have such articles exposed before Mrs. Bentley, and that the portmanteau was in
her charge ??She knows I kept the portmanteaus there, and that they were taken into Mr.
and Mrs. Bentley?s bedroom ; and she was the only person who was allowed to go there, and
she tells me she placed these two portmanteaus under Mr. and Mrs. Bentley?s bed.
107 By Dr. Owens. ?What Bignell?s were you stopping at ??The old Bush Hotel in
Elizabeth-street.
108. Had you those goods with you when you were there ? ?Yes.
109. Is Mr. Bignell, or anybody connected with him, in a position to support your

113. Did you take any memorandum from them for the goods you left in their hands ?
No, I did not, the only thing I took was the inventory I have now handed in to the Committee,

FRIDAY, sth MARCH, 1858.
Members present:
Mr. Humffray, in the Chair;
Mr Ebden, | Mr. Harker,
Maurice Frederick Ximenes, Esq., examined.
138. By the Chairman. ?Would you state what was your official position on Ballaarat m. f. ximenes,
at the time of the destruction of Bentley?s Hotel ??I was sub-inspector of police. sth March? 1858,
139. Would you state to the Committee what instructions you received that day relative
to Bentley?s Hotel ? ?On the day in question I was sent for by Mr. Evans, the officer in charge
of the police in the district, with directions to take ten men unarmed, and proceed to Bentley?s
Hotel, and remain there until after the meeting which was called.
140. You allude to the public meeting ??Yes; and in case I saw any symptoms of riot
or disorder I was to send one man to the camp for assistance. The meeting took place, and
after it was over a great crowd collected. They shouted for Bentley, and threats were used
that they would hang him at the lamp post. A large body of the mounted men, about twenty
or thirty, came up with Mr. Evans, and the mob then proceeded to acts of violence, such as
throwing stones, which smashed the building in every direction.
141. The Committee wish to know from you what instructions you received from Captain
Evans subsequent to those you have stated ??I never received any further instructions.
142. Not after Mr. Evans came up ? ?No.
143. Will you state to the Committee what you did ??I kept the men under my own
immediate command out of sight till the mob tried to come into the house, and I then brought
them down stairs ; they kept the mob out for a considerable time. The mounted men under
Mr. Taylor were circling round the house and the mob pelting them. I once or twice did go up
to Mr. Evans and Mr. Taylor both, and suggested that they should keep a space round the
house by bringing their men up, but they declined to act unless the magistrate read the Riot Act.
The mob got worse, and the soldiers came up and then the mob set fire to the house, and not
one plank was left upon another.
144. Are the Committee to understand you to say that Mr. Evans declined to interfere
without the Riot Act being read ? ?I went up to Mr. Taylor, who was in immediate command
of the mounted men, and whilst the mob was pelting the house I could do nothing with the men
unarmed, and I suggested that they should clear the place round the hotel, and the impression
on my mind is, that if they had acted when first they came up the riot would not have taken
place ; but after it had continued some time it might have required bloodshed to have stopped it.
145. Did you have any conversation with Bentley when you first went up ? ?I did.
146. By Mr. Harker. ?What time did you go up?? Ten in the morning, long before
the meeting took place.
147. At what hour was the meeting to take place ? ?Twelve o?clock, if I recollect
rightly. I had some conversation to this effect. Bentley came to me when they were smashing
the hotel.
148. By the Chairman. ?But in the first instance when you went up did Bentley speak
to you ??We had some conversation which I cannot exactly recollect the nature of. We had
some conversation ; it was I who addressed him in the first instance.
149. Did Bentley make any complaint to you of having the policemen disposed in view ?
Not my men, because they were entirely out of sight.
150. Did you say anything to Bentley to the effect that you had taken charge, in the name
of the Government, of his house ??No ; I told him I came up to protect his property as far as
I could with those men, but when Captain Evans came my power ceased. I said, I had come
to protect his property, and Bentley expressed his opinion that there would be no riot at all.
I went to the meeting myself and as soon as it was over came back ; I did not take any men ;
the police were out of sight, and, in fact, the mob did not become violent until the main body
of the police arrived.
151. Do you recollect saying to Bentley, ?Bentley, do not you interfere with me, I
have taken charge of this house in the name of the Government ???No, I do not recollect
that; I recollect telling him I was sent up to protect his property, and his expressing his
opinion that there was not the slightest fear.
152. Did you lend him your horse to escape ??I did.
153. Did you then assure him that you would take care of his place P ?This was after
the main body of the police arrived; the mob Avere becoming very violent, and I thought
serious consequences Avould arise to Bentley, and I suggested that he should go to the Camp.
He said he had no horse. I said, ? I Avill let you have my horse. You had better show
yourself to the people in front and it will draw them off the house, and they Avill follow you up
to the camp ;? and I believe I did say I Avould take care of his property.
154. You guaranteed its protection ??No, I cannot say that I guaranteed its protection,
I said I would protect his property, or the Government would protect it, the policemen, I did
not mean myself personally.
155. By Mr. Ebden. ?And you urged him to go for his own safety ??Yes.
156. You were afraid they might lay hold of him and lynch him ??es, I saAV the mob
Ballaarat Riots. ? c.


m. f. ximeneg, had got to that pitch that I thought if they did get hold of him they would lynch him, and
coruinned, I thought it best to get him out of the way.
sth March, 1858. 157. fry jj ie Chairman. ? If the police had used due diligence and vigilance when the
row commenced, do you think the destruction of that hotel might have been prevented? ?What
I mean to say is this, that when the armed police came up, I think it might have been prevented.
I think it was more meant as a sort of lark, in the beginning, than anything else, and if it
had been handled with decision in the first instance, it would not have required the Riot Act
to have been read. We could not fire on them without its being read, but we could have
dispersed the mob.
158. By Mr. Ehden. ?Were the armed men there before any actual violence com-
menced ? ?Yes, they did not attempt any violence against me. I was standing in the door way
until the armed police came up.
159. By the Chairman. ?Tne first attack upon the house was commenced by some boys
throwing stones and missiles against the wall, was not it ??Yes, and breaking the windows.
160. Have you any further statement that you can recollect that you would wish to
make ??I know the whole circumstances of the case.
161. What was the reason that induced Mr. Evans to order you there in the first
instance, was it in consequence of any complaint of fear made by Bentley himself? ?Yes,
Bentley came up, I was told.
162. By Mr. Ehden. ?You were told ??I know he did, I saw him come up and he said
it was reported that they intended to burn his place, and Mr. Evans said to me, ? I wish you to
take up ten men and remain there, you can take one trooper with you and if there is any
considerable disturbance the rest of the police will be at hand and will come to your assistance.?
I suggested that the men had better be armed, but he said there was no occasion for it.
163. By the Chairman. ?Were you present when Bentley made this complaint to Mr.
Evans ??No, I was not, but Mr. Evans told me himself that he had applied to him.
The ivitness withdrew.
Adjourned to Tuesday next at three o'clock.
FRIDAY, 16th APRIL, 1858.
Members present:
Mr. Humffray, in the Chair ;
Mr. Ebden, Mr. O?Shanassy,
Mr. Harker, Dr. Owens,
Mr. Horne, Mr. Haines.
Gordon Evans, Esq., called in and examined.
G. Evans, Esq., 164. By the Chairman. ? Will you be kind enough to state what ofilce you held under
16th April, 1858. the Government at the period of those disturbances at Ballaatat, and the destruction of Bentley?s
Hotel ??At that period I was inspector in charge of the police in the Ballaarat district.
165. Had you the conduct and control of the force at that time ??I had, subject to the
control of Mr. Rede. 1 had the immediate control of my own force.
166. Had you any control over the force independent of the instructions of Mr. Rede ?
Mr. Rede could give me orders, and I was bound to obey them.
167. Was it not optional with you lo refuse to comply with Mr. Rede?s orders, if you
thought proper ??I should not have attempted to do so unless I thought they were entirely in
opposition to instructions received from the Chief Commissioner of Police, and in that case I
should have communicated with the Chief Commissioner on the subject. There was an order
sent up, either previously or subsequently to that affair, that the resident commissioner was
chief on the gold-fields.
168. Will you state what position you held prior to that order, and subsequently to its
being received ?? I do not consider that there was the slightest alteration in my position. I
always received orders from Mr. Rede. I never sent the police out except I received instructions
to do so.
169. In case of riot or disturbance, would you not have acted without consulting him ?
In that particular case I was instructed to send the police out to Bentley?s, but not to have them
in view of the meeting.
170. By Mr. O? Shanassy. ?Was there not a divided authority between the police when
they were executing their ordinary duties as mere police in criminal cases and when employed
in collecting the license fee?were there not two authorities in existence, the first in reference
to the collection of the license fee, which was then the law of the land, and the other authority
in relation to mere ordinary transactions, such as they now perform ??ln this way. So far as
the discipline of the men was concerned, none could interfere but the Commissioner of Police.
171. Supposing that you wanted to arrest a man for murder would you not have done
it independent of Mr. Rede ? ?Certainly.
172. By the Chairman. ?Will you be kind enough to state what induced you to take
your men up ??I did not take the men up, they were sent up by different parties.


173. By your instructions ??I received instructions from Mr. Rede to do so, and I gave G. Evans, Esq.,
orders to the different officers in charge to keep them out of view. I saw Mr. Rede afterwards
and he said I was to go up there, and if anything unusual took place I was to report it to him. *
I told him I had been up previously and that I was fearful, that Bentley having been dismissed,
theie would be some unpleasant disturbance and in case of necessity he should send up a
magistrate to read the Riot Act. First he thought of sending Mr. Johnson, but he was on the
bench at the time of Bentley?s acquittal. He therefore sent up Mr. Green, and he said I was
not, in any case, to act without orders. The Riot Act must be read before I could do anything.
The police were at first posted out of sight of the meeting and all went on orderly enough at
first, but afterwards they commenced hooting and throwing stones, and they said they were
determined to have Mr. Dewes or Mr. Bentley, one or the other, they would not be satisfied
without one of them. They began to throw stones at the windows and smashed them and
commenced tearing down the paling. I then sent to the magistrate and told him I thought the
place would be destroyed unless the police went out. He said, ? Very well, call the police up,?
and they went according to his instructions. ?
174. By Mr. O Shanassy. ?Bentley had escaped at this time??l cannot say.
175. Did you see the destruction of the property take place??l did.
176. Under the eye of the police?? Yes*; the police came out, as I said, and when I
saw we could do nothing without the Riot Act being read, I rode up to Mr. Green and beeped
of him to read the Riot Act.
177. Were the police armed? ?They were, but not loaded.
178. What number of police had you ??I think about twenty-four mounted police and
about thirty or forty footmen.
179. By Mr. Ebden. ?Under aims?? Yes.
180. By Mr. O? Shanassy. ?At what did you estimate the strength of the populace ?
When the disturbance commenced there appeared to be about 1,500 possibly, but at the end of
the riot there might be 7,000 or 8,000 people.
181. At the time you were on the ground, and could not preserve the place, how many
were there ??4,000 or 5,000.
182. You consider that without the Riot Act being read it was impossible to resist the
destruction of the building ??Totally impossible.
183. Did the whole population seem to take part in the destruction of it?? Yes ; that
is, the greater part.
184. And there was great excitement ??Not against the police.
185. Did you draw off the police to any distance from the crowd??l went a second
time to ask Mr. Green to read the Riot Act.
186. What was Mr. Green ??He was the Gold Commissioner. I told him I held him
responsible for the consequences of the disturbance, for I could not save the property without
he read the Riot Act.
187. pid you draw the police off to any distance from the building, so as not to be
entangled with the crowd ??The people pressed us up against the building.
188. So that you did every thing you could without the Riot Act being read ??I did.
189. By Mr. Ehden. ?Had you any application from Bentley for the protection of the
police ??I stated that application was made for police protection.
190. But Bentley did not make application by a messenger of his own ??I cannot say.
Tknow application was made for the police to go to Bentley?s.
191. By Mr. Horne. ?But not by Bentley himself ? ?I cannot say.
192. By the Chairman. ?Are you positive that you received your instructions from
Mr. Rede ??He had the whole planning of the thing.
193. Then if Mr. Rede had not instructed you to take the force up there, would you
have gone ??At Bentley?s own request I should have sent them. I always did to any person
applying for police protection, and he asking for protection, inside his house they went.
194. Do you recollect whom you sent ??Mr. Ximenes went.
195. Do you recollect Mr. Ximenes applying to clear away the crowd round the
hotel ??No, Ido not. I recollect Captain Carter asking what I was going to do. He said,
? Are you going to sit here and do nothing ??
196. By Mr. O? Shanassy. ?Who was Captain Carter??He was one of my sub-
inspectors. After that I went, as I told you before, to ask a second time that Mr. Green
would read the Riot Act, but it was useless. He seemed almost beside himself, and did not
know what to do, and I was only to act under him. Mr. Rede said I was not to unite the two
offices, judicial and executive.
197.. By the Chairman. ?l was going to ask you if you were not a magistrate and in a
position to have read the Riot Act yourself had you chosen ??lf I had not known that Mr.
Green was on the ground for the purpose of reading the Riot Act I might; but under the
circumstances I do not think it would have been right.
198. By Mr. O? Shanassy. ?ls there not a regulation to a contrary effect ??There is ;
at the same time if the Riot Act had been read we could have dispersed the crowd. There
would have been loss of life, but not so much as took place afterwards.
199. By Mr. Ebden . ?Do you remember having any conversation with Bentley on that
occasion ??No.
200. Did you consider yourself actually in charge of the premises ? ?Never. -


g. Evans, Esq., 201. Did you ever say to Bentley ?he might consider himself perfectly at ease, you were
isthApru in charge of the house? ? ?Not on any occasion. I saw Mr. Rede give the Riot Act to Mr.
Green.
202. By the Chairman, ?Then there is no truth in that statement if made by Bentley
himself?did you ever use any expression of that kind ? ?Not at all. He was up in my quarters,
and I gave him a night?s lodging ?a room in the barracks, a part of my house. He was talking
there, and he went on and said, ? Why did not you act ?why did not you act ???I said, ? Bentley,
I must obey my orders.? Nothing further passed.
203. Did you lead him to believe, by any expression of yours, that the house might have
been saved if proper energy had been used ??I cannot say ?he might have understood so.
204. Did you say, had the Riot Act been read, to authorize you to have acted, it might
have been saved ? ?No, I think not.
205. You do not think you led him to believe so by any expression you made use of??
No, I think not; but my impression is that we could have saved the house if the Riot Act had
been read, but I cannot say what the people might have done after we left the ground. I have
had occasion to disperse mobs before, and I judge from my previous experience.
206. Would you have acted differently to what you did if you had had the instructions
required from Mr. Rede ??lf Mr. Green had read the Riot Act, we could have acted ; as it
was, I drew off the men.
207. You did not wait for any further instructions from Mr. Rede, then ? ?No,
I did not.
208. By Mr, O' Shanassy. ?How long did this violence continue in your presence ?
while you had the force on the ground ; how long did it take to destroy the buildings, from
the time they commenced the demolition of the building until they finished it, the police being
present ??I cannot say ;it was more than an hour; an hour and a half, perhaps.
209. By the Chairman, ?l would like to know from you whether you do not think that
the house might have been saved from destruction with proper energy on the part of the police
without going to extreme measures ? ?lt was not possible ; it was one force against another.
210. But reasoning from the first evidence you had of an intended disturbance, do not
you think, if energy had been used, it might have been saved ??I do not think it could have
been saved; I believe that a great many people knew that the police could not act, which
rendered them bolder.
211. By Mr, O? Shanassy. ?Were any of the crowd armed, or were any shots fired
during the disturbance ? ?I did not see any arms, but it was reported to me by some of the
police that a good many had fire-arms about them.
212. By the Chairman. ?You said a few minutes ago that you got no orders ??I got
no orders from Mr. Rede before leaving the camp, excepting what I stated.
213. Will you state what your orders were prior to setting out from the camp ??lt was
to send the police, and to keep them out of view during the meeting.
214. Were there no contingent orders ??That I was to take instruction from Mr. Green.
He had the Riot Act, and before I acted he was to give me instructions ; so that my hands
were completely tied.
215. Did you see Mr Rede and take instructions from him after you came to the
ground ? ?The house was half burnt when he came.
216. Having stated what kind of instructions you had from Mr. Rede, what instructions
did you receive from Mr. Green ? I could not get any from him, excepting I was to use more
forbearance.
217. By Mr. O' Shanassy. ?What do you mean by more ? forbearance what force were
you using at the time ??I was doing all I could to keep the people back.
218. And he thought that the Riot Act not being read you were going too far ??I did
go, and tried to speak to the crowd, they listened at first and then began to laugh.
219. By the Chairman. ?l will read you an answer given by Mr. Rede to the following
question; ??Did you, yourself, give any orders to the police which they either obeyed or
disobeyed ?? He replied, ?My orders were not carried out with regard to the distance at which
the police should be kept from the meeting. Mr. Evans brought his men much more into
evidence than I intended. I said, keep them back, so that there may be no collisions, but at
the same time be sufficiently near to act in case there should be a row. He certainly came
nearer than I intended, but whether he thought by placing himself there he was carrying out
my wishes, or whether be judged himself that it was a better place, Ido not know.? Is that
correct ??I do not think there was a single policeman to be seen on the ground, with the
exception of one or two horsemen none of the police were shown or brought up by my
instructions, until a considerable portion of the house was destroyed.
220. Did Mr. Rede order you to place them at all ??No. It was at the request of
Bentley,
221. By Mr. O' Shanassy. ?Did you see any portion of the building on fire on
approaching it, on coming from the camp to Bentley?s hotel in the first instance ??I was there
before the meeting commenced.
222. I am speaking of your marching the police from the hotel ??They had just
commenced to set fire to the fence round the house.
223. Before you approached the building ??The meeting was held close to where the
hotel was.
224. You went first to the meeting and after that was over they went to the hotel ?
It was only a distance of about 200 yards.


095o 95 Then no portion was on fire at starting ??I was there at the meeting, and they g. Evan�, Esq.,
i ... , . continued,
went from the meeting to the hotel at its termination. 16th April, isss,
226. By the Chairman. ?Did you give instructions to Mr. Ximenes to have his police
in the house ? ?No. ,
227. Did you know that he had placed them there ??I knew they were inside ot it.
228. I should like to have this point cleared up. I know you have stated that
Mr. Rede?s authority superseded yours on the occasion ??Yes.
229. I will read you question No. 21, and the answer.? [The Chairman read them
accordingly.']?l wish to know whether that answer is correct??lf I received orders from
Mr. Rede, I should certainly have obeyed them ; but at the same time, if I thought they were
orders that ought not to be carried out, though I should have obeyed them, I should have
communicated with the Chief Commissioner on the subject.
230. By Mr. O? Shanassy. ?Did Mr. Rede practically ever interfere in your manage-
ment of the police, when you had only the civil business to carry out ? ?He used to order
them, so many men to such a station, and so many men to another station, and so on.
231. So that his order was sufficient in both capacities ? ?Yes.
232. By Mr. Horne. ?Was not such order on such an occasion inoperative, if you
thought it necessary to disobey it ? ?No. He gave me orders to send the police out, and I
sent them. , �
233. By Mr. Haines. ?Did you ever receive orders from Mr. Rede, or any orders ol
which you doubted the propriety ? ?No.
234. By the Chairman. ?I would like to know from you, whether, providing you had
considered yourself in a position to have had the whole disposition of the police in that affair, you
could not have saved that hotel on that occasion? ?I should have conducted it very differently.
235. Will you describe the different manner in which you would have acted under your
undivided authority, not under the orders of another party ? ?The course that Dewes followed
was entirely different from my view of prosecuting Bentley on that occasion.
236. By Mr. O' Shanassy. ?l think you are telling the preliminary steps before the
affair took place ; but what would you have done on that occasion p?I would not have sent
the police out at all. I would not have gone on the ground until there was a necessity for it;
and when I saw the meeting was likely to have serious consequences, I would have gone with
a magistrate who would have acted, and I am certain we could have cleared the place.
� 237. By the Chairman.? Then is the Committee to understand you to say, that you
could not have cleared the place by any other means, except by firing upon the crowd ? Not
at that time ; but had not the police been sent out at all, it is questionable whether the people
would have acted in that manner; their presence irritated the people.
238. In answer to question 43, it is stated by Mr. Rede, ? I was not on the ground the
whole time ; when I came up the hotel was partly demolished, but I must say that my impression
was from what I saw and what I heard afterwards, that had the police acted with energy in the
first instance when the mob began pelting the hotel with stones, the hotel might have been sa\ ed
is that true ? I differ in toto from Mr. Rede ; I was on the ground the whole time, and 1 was
very much pleased with the way in which the police behaved.
239. If I understand you rightly, you state that you believe that from the first to trie
last you could not have saved that hotel, except 'the Riot Act had been read ? I could not
except there had been a different line of conduct pursued. If Mr. Green had not gone out at
all, and if there had been a meeting, and I had been allowed to act according to my own dis-
cretion, I might have saved the hotel. . , . .
240. Do you think the presence of the police contributed to the not p?l think it is
possible the presence of the police might have irritated the people.
241. By Mr. O? Shanassy. ?You think they were determined to show their power over
the police??l think it possible. . . _ v *
242. By Mr. Horne.?l want to know whether it is possible according to your belief
that nothing better could have been done then, in the absence of the Riot Act being read, and
in the absence of further instructions ;~No ; I think not. . . ,
243. By the Chairman.? Then you literally followed your instructions and considered
that Mr. Green was to give you orders ??Yes. . .
241. By Mr. O'Shanassy. ?What time elapsed between your receiving your first
instructions from Mr. Rede and his coming on to the ground himself ??-About two hours.
245 What was he doing during that time ??I do not know. I thought he might have
come on the ground himself, and in fact I went on the ground to search for him all round the
buildin
m 2*46. Was there any general feeling on the part of the whole of the people of Baliaarat
with regard to that meeting?any uneasiness on the minds of the population that day . I hey
seemed to be very much excited ; they said we cannot have justice from the magistrates we
will take it ourselves. There was something, Ido not know whether it was of Mr. Rede or o
Mr. Dewes, they said we will get him up here and hang him on that tree.
247. What was your rank then ??lnspector of Police.
248. By the Chairman. ?It was you who sent Mr. Ximenes on the ground yes.
249. Will you state what special instructions you gave him in the matter .?I cannot
say whether I gave the order to him personally or sent orders by one of the officers, Mr. laylor.
250. By Mr O'Shanassy.? What was Mr. Ximenes?s rank ??Sub-inspector.

Mr. Charles Dyte, called in and examined.
r a2sl * ie Chairman. ?You are an auctioneer and commission agent at Ballaarat, 1
28bh April, 1858. b e l ieye ?_J am>
252. Do you remember the destruction of Bentley?s Hotel ??Yes, I do.
253. Will you describe what loss you sustained from that event ??As near as I could
ascertain I lost �415, the particulars of which were sent in to a Committee, by order of the late
Governor.
254. What was your occupation at the time of the riots ? ?I was a trader and commis-
sion agent.
255. Were you resident on Ballaarat at that time ??I was resident anywhere. I was
generally up in Ballaarat a fortnight, and in Melbourne a fortnight.
256. By Mr, Horne, You were up there for the purpose of purchasing gold ??No r ,
for trading as a general merchant
25 (. By the Chairman, ?W ill you state the particulars of the loss you complain of ??I
was about having a store at Ballaarat, and I directed the carriers who carted my goods to leave
them at the only likely place then known, which was Bentley?s Hotel. They arrived there on
Monday night, about six o?clock, and on Tuesday they were all burnt. On Tuesday, about
two o?clock, the riots took place.
258. What description of goods was destroyed ??GeneraJ merchandise. A statement
of the loss was sent in to a former Committee. There was a general assortment of every thing:
combs, brushes, pickles, &c. Everything that a storekeeper would have to keep.
259. By Mr. Horne. C onsumable articles, then ??T es. 1 here were also some musical
boxes and two or three plated waiters. I may say I had done business with Mr. Bentley before.
I had sold him goods at various times, and there was a balance of �270 or �2BO then owing
to me. c
260. A balance between you and Mr. Bentley ??Yes. I never put that in any claim
that I made, until one petition I sent in to the Governor, when it was put in. For Ido not
consider it a debt due from the Government.
261. By the Chairman. ?How did your goods happen to be at Bentley?s Hotel ??lf the
drayman had arrived at twelve o?clock in the day instead of six o?clock in the evening thev
would not have been there at all. At that time, where Bentley lived, it was a dangerous road
for anybody to travel on.
262. By Mr. Horne. ?You do not mean on account of being stopped and robbed? No;
it was an impassable road at night.
263. By the Chairman. And that Was your reason for the goods being allowed to
remain there ??Yes. In the first place they were directed to Bentley?s Hotel as the only place
that carriers would know. J 1
264. By Mr. Horne. ?Did I understand you to say they arrived at six o?clock?
Between five and six o?clock.
265. By the Chairman.? How many days prior to their being destroyed was it that thev
arrived ? ?Only the night before. 3
266. By Mr. Horne. ? The affair took place when F?On Tuesday.
267. By the Chairman. ?Why did you not remove them from the Hotel in the morn-
'""Jr 1 should have had plenty of time to remove them had it not been for the Commissioner
or Police, who took every thing into his custody.
268. Who was that ??Mr. Ximenes.
w^iat wa 7 * ie interfere with your taking your goods??l may say, that on
the Monday my-goods arrived I took a letter from Mr. Bentley, I believe to Mr. Dewes
complaining of a meeting that was to take place, and stating that he feared the consequences if the
meeting veie to take place the next day. lam not sure whether it was a message or a letter.
Capt. Evans was then called in I believe ho was called in?l am referring to names in which
I may not be correct. The purport of the letter or message was given to him. His answer
was something similar to this : ?? That a handful of policemen would put down any disturb-
ance that might take place.? The only thing that I can actually say is, he said there was
nothing to be feared, but that a handful of policemen would put down anything that might take
place, vv hat struck me more forcibly respecting it than it would otherwise have done was
that it reminded me of a remark made under similar circumstances by the Duke of Wellington*
but I cannot exactly say the words that were used. � ?
t x. ter 7 0u g ot answer what did you do ?? Nothing at all till next morning
I slept on my way to the camp and came down to the hotel in the morning.
- lfri 27L You say you would have taken away the goods had it not been for Mr. Ximenes??
ien I went there about ten o?clock in the morning Mr. Ximenes and a party of police came
. 1( : re ? and tien sai(i t0 Mr * Bentley, ? I take charge of the premises and all that is in them
is in my custody. ?


272. How do you know he said so ??I was there. I may be allowed to say one thing? Mr. c Dyt�*,
I cannot say that I have the exact words, letter for letter, but I give the full sense of what was
spoken at the time. p *
2/3. And are the Committee to understand that in consequence of what Mr. Ximenes
said you did not take away the goods p?In consequence of what he said to Mr. Bentley, I took
no care of them. They were not in the hotel, but in a store separated by a passage from the
hotel.
274. Was it the ordinary store-room?? Yes.
275. About what time did the meeting take place??l think about eleven o?clock as far
as I can recollect.
276. By Mr. Horne. ?ln the morning ??Yes.
2//. ByMr. Eb den. ?What month was it in ? ?ln October I think, or November; I
was at the meeting. The papers that I furnished to a former Committee were, the carrier?s
note, the account certified, and the carter?s way bill.
278.. By Mr. Horne.. ?They are not now before us, and therefore cannot become
evidence to this Committee. You stated that when Mr. Ximenes came there, he stated that he
ook charge, and that for that reason you did not move your things. Now, were you under
the impression that when Mr. Ximenes said he took charge that was a prohibition against your
removing them ? ?I understood it so; I should say that Mr. Bentley wished to remove some
goods, and it was in answer to that that Mr. Ximenes made that remark,
279. What was the proposition ??I believe it was something about removing goods.
280. Cannot you state definitely ??I do not know exactly. I think it was some sugges-
tion about it.
281. It amounts to this?was Mr. Ximenes answer a prohibition ??I considered it in a
great measure a prohibition.
282. Was it answered in such a way as to lead you to consider yourself in an over-
reaching position ? ?After asking the police leave, I should.
283 By Mr. Ebden. ?Did you make any offer to remove them ??No.
284. Then you were not prevented??No, I was not. You must understand that if I
had wished I could not have removed them, for I could not get carts whenever I pleased, although
I do not consider I was prevented, yet I should not have considered myself justified in removing
them after what Mr. Ximenes said. There were some things of mine saved, and I made
application for them, and could not get them. There was a musical box saved, and I made
application for it and could not get it, I was told they were all in the hands of the police,
285. Then the police retained a portion of your property which was not restored ? ?Yes.
286. Did you make application for it p?I made several applications, but could not get
it. The claim I put in for �2BO was merely a debtor and creditor account between me and
Mr. Bentley.
287. What is the amount of the claim you put in ? ?�4ls.
288. Of what does that consist ??Of different descriptions of merchandise and goods
that arrived there on Monday night.
289. Do you mean to say that on those two drays there were goods to the amount of
�415 ??Yes, there were more than to that amount.
290. By the Chairman. ?In the report of the Board appointed to take into consideration
the claims of persons for compensation for losses sustained during the disturbances at Ballaarat,
it is stated respecting your claim as follows : ?? Charles Dyte, �415 Is. The claimant had a
small store at Ballaarat, where it is natural to suppose his own property would be stored. He
was in the habit of acting for Bentley and others as an agent, and the Board have reason to
believe, that the goods for the loss of which compensation is claimed, were for the use and
appertaining to the hotel.? What have you to say as to that statement ? lam prepared to
prove that I had no store at Ballaarat, and that I was never there more than from fourteen days
to fifteen days at a time until the time of the fire.
291. By Mr. Horne. ?What about those goods ? ?They were intended for opening a
store, or selling to any person who might require them. I did more trade in the district than
in Bentley?s house. I never had anything to do with Bentley on commission, not a shilling?s
worth.
292. By the Chairman. ?Were you in the habit of taking your goods to Bentley?s for
convenience ??Yes, I was. In the debtor and creditor account which I sent in for �2BO, I
merely wanted to show that I was not Bentley?s agent ; but if I had pickles and he wanted
them I should sell them to him, but I never received a commission from him
293. By Mr. Horne. ?Were you in the habit of taking goods there before?? Yes.
294. And treating it as a store and selling from it ? ?No.
295. What did you do with them ??I should remove them to the store kept by Mr.
Harris, who was an auctioneer at Ballaarat, but it would have been almost impossible to have
got them there on the night they came up.
296. By Mr. Ebden. ?You on previous occasions brought goods there and left them
there for a few days, and sold them off to Bentley and others ? ?I have sold some to Mr.
Bentley, but never sold to anybody else from his house.
297. But you have had goods stored there ??Yes, but I have always taken down the
goods to Mr. Harris?s and there sold them, with the exception of these goods.
298. By Mr. Horne. ?You lodged them first at Mr. Bentley?s store, and conveyed them
thence for public sale ??Not for public sale. Mr. Harris was a friend of mine.
299. Then I understand you that your goods went to Mr. Bentley?s as the most


Mr. c. Dyte, convenient place, that you never sold any from thence except to Bentley himseli, and the residue
continued* was taken to Mr. Harris?s auction room and sold there ??I said being the only house known to
ssth April, 1858. carriers, and they being thus able to find it out. After being there the goods would be
taken to Mr. Harris?s, and not sold by auction but stored there.
300. Then I understand you there were other places where they could have been stored,
but that was the most convenient place ? ?lt was the most convenient for the carriers, in fact
the only convenient place. I believe it was a system adopted by most.
301. By Mr. Fbden. ?�415 was the claim made to the old Committee; claimed for goods
on those drays?what was the �2BO ??That was a debtor and creditor account between
Bentley and me.
302. Did you bring that claim forward too ??I mentioned it at the first meeting at
Ballaarat, but not as a claim on the Government. I could give evidence in opposition to the
expression of the Board respecting their belief that I was Bentley?s agent.
303. By the Chairman, ?Were you present at the time that the house was burnt down ?
I was.
304. Will you describe to the Committee what took place on that occasion ??I went to
that meeting after being at Mr. Bentley?s house, and returned to Bentley?s just as the meeting
was over. I was giving my account of what had taken place on my return from the meeting
to the hotel, and that I thought there would only be a few groans when a mob passed the
house. At the same time that the mob came up the mounted troopers rode up, and the diggers
commenced throwing at them. The police were round about the house, but they seemed to
go from where the crowd was the greatest; wherever the danger was, they appeared to be the
furthest away from it. Ultimately Mr. Rede came up, and while he was speaking to the mob
some men commencing pulling the house down. The soldiers of the 40th came up about this
time, and then some boys set fire to the back part of the house.
305. I want to know from you what the police did, if anything, in the way of preventing
the destruction of the hotel ? ?They did nothing ; they were in the house and kept there until
stones were thrown (I thought at first they were thrown at the mounted troopers), and when
it was dangerous to remain in the house the police came out, but they certainly did nothing?
they seemed to go away from where the crowd was the greatest.
306. Having stated what you saw, would you state what is your opinion?ought they
have taken another course?could they have prevented the destruction of the house ? ?I think
three policemen, or half a dozen, might have prevented it. There were quite sufficient to quell
any disturbance at the first, from the number of persons that were there. There were quite
sufficient with Mr. Ximenes to quell any disturbance. Most of the people went another way
from the meeting. Ido not mean after Mr. Rede was there, that they were sufficient ?I am
talking of before he came up.
307. By Mr. Horne. ?Are you well acquainted with Mr. Bentley ? ?I never saw him
until a week or a fortnight before he commenced building his house.
308. How long had he the house open ? ?I think about five or six months. I made a
mistake as to the period of my acquaintance with him ?it was not a week before he opened it?
I mean a week before he commenced to build it.
309. Then for how long were you acquainted with Mr. Bentley from the commencement
of your knowledge of him to the time of the burning ? ?From a week before he commenced
building. I can give very nearly the exact date. I think it was in December.
310. And when was the house burnt ? ?ln October following.
311. That is six or eight months ? ?The first time I saw him was at Buninyong.
312. How long had you known him?? From December to the following October.
313. Had you been trading with Mr. Bentley during the whole of that period? ?Ho I
had not. My first trading with Bentley was in March.
314. What was your reason for saying that if the police had acted in the first instance
the disturbance could have been quelled ?what means of forming an opinion on that subject
have you had ?have you been mixed up with things of that, nature ? ?-From the fact of being
so few people there when the riot commenced, and there being sufficient police to do it.
315. To what height had the disturbance gone when there were so few people ??Stones
were then first thrown.
316. Were there then only a few people ? ?Very few. I have always remarked that, I
believe, stones were thrown at first by boys.
The witness withdrew.
Adjourned to Friday at two o?clock.
