THE
Exhibition of Women's Industries.
THE Committee and Delegates, as the time approaches for the com-
pletion of their work, gratefully acknowledge the response to their
efforts, as evidenced by the thousands of Exhibits. The novelty of the
enterprise made the early labours of the Delegates very exacting. The
result, however, fully attests the sympathy and encouragement given.
In this their first attempt to bring the various Women’s Industries
before the public, the Committee have had to relinquish exhibits in many
departments, owing to the impossibility, in the limited space available, of
shewing the productions in which men and women jointly labour with the
aid of machinery; and further to contend against the difficulty, which
affects many professional workers, of separating their work from, or of
displaying it away from the places where they are engaged. The laudable
desire of the school children of New South Wales to make a creditable
display of work at the International Exhibition now being held in
Melbourne, has materially affected their contributions here ; nevertheless
the Committee feel that the Exhibition of Women’s Industries will be
one of the most memorable events of the Centennial year, and that its
beneficial influence will long be felt throughout the colony.
Although many manufactures in which the women of Great Britain,
of other European Nations, and of America, are now largely engaged, are
not as yet established here, there is much room for congratulation in the
excellence of the work done in several departments. Not alone does the
sterling time-honoured occupation of women with the needle find many
devotees in every variety of underclothing ; but in divers specimens of
artistic needlework rare merit is shown. If the spinning-wheel recalls an
almost forgotten art, side by side with this solitary exhibit, the nimble
fingers of the type-writers show how quickly the daughters of this new
land have adopted recent discoveries, and mastered a new and profitable
industry. In several sections the advantages of technical training are
seen. There are signs that the higher education of women is bearing
fruit in the colony ; the Fine Art Gallery points to considerable skill in
many branches of art ; the numerous exhibits of plants evidence that
the beauties of nature and the love of flowers, appeal successfully to the
care and sympathies of a large portion of the community.
In the number and merit of the exhibits by amateurs in the various
departments, there is matter for great satisfaction. They shew in how
large a degree the young people of this colony possess the power of
surrounding themselves in their homes with the beautiful in art : in this
respect the Exhibition will, it is believed, develop and foster much of the
spirit which pervades the home-life of the middle classes in European

countries, where each member of a family feels it a privilege to contribute
to the general income, where young people are happy in working with
the needle, brush, or in some branch of mechanical industry daring a
portion of every day or evening, proud if the result increases the decora-
tion of the home, or adds a trifle to the family store.
It is also hoped that this opportunity for competition offered alike to
all classes, will encourage a spirit of honourable emulation, and induce all
to act in the spirit of Mrs. Frances Osgood’s poem, whose closing lines
may well serve as a talisman for every exhibitor :
“ Work for some good, be it ever so slowly ;
“ Cherish some flower be it ever so lowly ;
“ Labour, all labour is noble and holy,
“ Let thy great deeds be thy pray’r to thy God ! ”

THE Centenary Fair, which forms so attractive a department of the
Exhibition, may well be termed the embodiment of the Non-
competitive Section of the women-workers. It is the outcome of the
feelings of many who ardently desired to help in the good cause, but who
shrank from the ordeal of a competition or exhibition.
The stall-holders are entitled to hearty recognition for their arduous
labours, their lavish expenditure of time, and in many cases, of large sums
of money, and also for the indirect good training which the “ work
meetings” of the past seven or eight months have supplied. What the
Exhibition is expected to accomplish in an educational or national sense,
the Fair will do in a financial sense, for in this department lies the hope
of the Committee for their profits. Many of the stall-holders thankfully
acknowledge their indebtedness to manufacturers in all parts of the world,
for substantial proofs of their sympathy with this Exhibition. The
Departments I. and 11. have a double stall for the disposal of contribu-
tions in excess of exhibits. Department YL has a flower stall for the
sale of plants and flowers given to the delegate. A portion of the Fine
Art Gallery is set apart for a similar purpose as regards the varied
paintings on china, card, &c., and a refreshment counter is attached to
Department 111. In addition, sixteen stalls form
THE CENTENARY FAIR,
and are under the direction of the ladies whose names are attached to each,
with staffs of assistants too numerous to be mentioned here. Another
Department which will play an important part in the enterprise is that
of the Music and Dramatic Entertainments ; the former has been under-
taken by Miss Woolley, as delegate, who has formed a committee and
arranged a scheme of concerts in which works by female composers,
programmes illustrating the music of different nations, and the qualifica-
tions of Australian musicians will alike find a place ; for the Dramatic
portion, Mrs. F. B. Lark is the delegate, and from the number and varied
talents of those who have enlisted under her guidance, and the artistic
nature of some of the entertainments, a very interesting and attractive
series of performances may be expected.

SAFE
MEDICINE
FOR
LADIES.
THE reason is they are purely a vegetable composition of Dandelion, and
expressly suited to the constitution and of women. This
jxplains the great success and golden opinions which follow their use. Thousands
say they save all trouble, effectually remove all impurities of the blood, beautify
the complexion, no headache, no pain, no flushing, no giddiness, no anxiety. They
make work a pleasure, and existence a joy. Superior to any other known remedy.

FOREIGN EXHIBITS.
INTRODUCTION.
A COLLECTION of Needlework from Holland has been worked for the Exhibition
of Women’s Industries (in the short time of eight weeks), by request of the
Delegate, Mrs, Gurney.
On the occasion of the Centenary of the Colony the Dutch descendants of the
earliest discoverers of Australia were asked to take an interest in our Exhibition, and
the Orphan Girls of Old Holland have much pleasure in showing the girls of New
Holland some of their Needlework and Knitting.
The ladies of the Committee of the Protestant Diakenie (Deacon’s) Orpba.ria.gp
at Amsterdam, and the Protestant Burgher Orphanage at Rotterdam, have sent an
interesting and instructive selection of work, and have paid all expenses including
the carriage to Sydney, and have expressed a wish that the work should be sold for
the benefit of the Fund for Distressed Women in New South Wales.
It has, however, been decided by the Committee of Needlework to present some
of the best specimens to the Technological Museum, Sydney.
Collection of Needlework from Het
Dlakenie Weeshuis, Amsterdam.

A 3NTEW INVESTMENT!
Jtßufual Hifp of Hugfrafasia.
Established 1869, and Incorporated by Act of Parliament.
A purely Mutual and Australian Office , and the first to grant
absolutely Indefeasible Policies .
The above old-established and well-known Association directs the
attention of prudent Investors to its new “ Centennial ” Tables, which,
unlike some of the older forms of Assurance, do not require the
Assured “to die to win,” but guarantee either at Death or on attain-
ing a specified age, a good Return, protected by Law from Creditors.
EXAMPLES :
TABLE A. R.
A man, age 30, assures for under Table A. R, 30, paying an Annual
Premium of 3s. 4d. for 30 years, and secures the following benefits :
1. At Death, if before reaching 60 years of age, the sum assured with
Reversionary Bonuses added.
'2. At Age 60, a Refund of all Premiums paid (,£1,055), and the Member may
continue the Policy for ,£l,OOO with future profits at the original rate of
premium (,£35 3s. 4d ), and either draw the Cash Value of accrued Bonuses
or leave them as Reversionary Additions to the sum assured :
Or, he may withdraw the total Premiums paid 1,055), as above, the Surrender
Value of the Policy (,£270), and also the accrued Cash Bonuses :
Or, he may have a Paid-up Policy {ox £l.OOO, with full participation in future
profits, and an Annuity of ,£l2O (about) for the rest of life.
TABLE H.R,
A father, age 30, endows his son, age X year, for ,£l,OOO payable on his attaining
14 years of age, the Annual Premium being £59 12s. fid.
After paying this for two or three years the father dies, but instead of the widow
having to continue paying Premiums, the Endowment becomes a Paid-up Policy
and matures when the boy reaches 14 years of Age. Should he die during the
currency of the Policy all the premiums paid will be refunded.
BtOYUS YEAR I§HO.
Policies effected prior to 30 ih June, 1889, will participate in the Division
of Profits to be made as at that date.
Send for “Centennial” and other Tables to
J. C. REMINGTON, General Manager.
Principal Office; GEOEGE & WTEYAEB STEEETS, Sydney.

1543 Oil Painting, “ Adam Warner, Hooted at as
a Wizard.” At last he heard a shout, or
rather hoot, at a distance, and turning
his attention whence it proceeded, he
beheld a figure emerge from an alley
opposite the casement, with a sack
under one arm and several books heaped
under the other ; at his heels followed
a train of ragged boys, shouting and
hollowing, “ The Wizard, ah! bah! The
old devils kin and many voices of men
and women, joined in deeper bass with
the shrill tenor of the choral urchins.
The Wizard! The Wizard! out of day-
light. The person thus stigmatized, as
he approached the house, turned his
face with an expression of wistfnl per-
plexity from side to side.”—Lytton’s
“ Last of the Barons.”
K
1544 Oil Painting, “ Erasmus ” (Desideorius).
Born at Rotterdam in 1407. He left
his father and mother at 14 years of
age, and was committed to the care of
certain guardians who would force him
to be an ecclesiastic, which he refused
for a long time. However, he was
obliged to assume the religious habit
among the canons regular in the
monastery of Stein, near Tergon ; but
afterwards obtained a dispensation from
his vows. He was the most learned
man of the age in which he lived, and
contributed by his example and his
writings to the restoration of learning
in the several countries in which he
occasionally resided, viz., Italy, Swit-
zerland, Holland, Prance and England.
With the last he was most satisfied, and
found the greatest encouragement from
Henry YIIX., Sir Thomas Moore, and
all the learned Englishmen of those
days. He published a great many
books; and died at Basil in 1536. He
was buried honorably, and his memory
is still held in veneration. He has,
however, many enemies, and as he did
not embrace the reformation and yet
censured many things in Popery, he has
been treated* injuriously both by
Catholics and Protestants.

1585 Oil Painting, “The Volcano of Kilanea, on
the Island of Hawaii,” by Jules Tavernier.
Sent for exhibition by COL. G. W. MAC-
FARLANE, Honolulu.
The following is an extract from the
description of the volcano given by
Lady Brassey in her “Voyage of the
Sunbeam” : —“ On arriving at the island
of Hawaii, where the volcano is situated,
the marvellous spectacle which lay before
me was wondrous to see It
was all terribly grand, magnificently
sublime, but no words could adequately
describe such a scene. The precipice on
which we were standing overhung the
crater so much that it was impossible to
sec what was going on immediately
beneath ; but from the columns of smoke
and vapour that arose, the flames and
sparks that constantly drove us back
from the edge, it was easy to imagine
that there must have been two or three
grand fiery fountains below. As the
sun set, and darkness enveloped the
scene, it became more awful than ever.
Not two inches beneath the surface,
the grey lava on which we were standing
and sitting was red hot. A stick thrust
through it caught fite, a piece of paper
was immediately destroyed, and the
gentlemen found the heat from the
crevices so great that they could not
approach near enough to light their
pipes. The aspect of the active volcano
from this eminence was terrific beyond
description.”

“ A long felt want of a really first-class Restaurant in Sydney, is now supplied
by the City Buffet Catering Company, corner of George and Margaret Streets.”
“ Country visitors should not fail to visit the City Buffet, which is conducted
on the London principle.”
“ Every visitor to the City Buffet maintains that no better meal could be
enjoyed in any large city in Europe.”
“ Where shall I dine 1 ” This question is asked by hundreds every day, and
there is but one answer, “ The City Buffet.”
“ The City Buffet is acknowledged to be the best appointed Restaurant in
Sydney.”
“ If you wish to enjoy a good breakfast, lunch, dinner, or tea, you can not do
better than call at the City Buffet, George and Margaret Streets.”
The City Buffet is renowned for its Fish and Game.”
“ The City Buffet Catering Company evidently spare no pains to make their
patrons comfortable.”
“ The success of the City Buffet can better be estimated when it is stated
that over 187,600 meals have been served there during the last twelve months.
It is, without doubt, the cleanest and most healthy resort is Sydney for charging
the inner man, and as the leading commercial restaurant it is rightly ac-
knowledged.”
“ The Growler writes that an awful dispensation of providence awaits the
man who will say other than that the City Buffet stands unrivalled in this city.”
“ The Sunday Times states that the City Buffet seems to be as popular as
ever.”
