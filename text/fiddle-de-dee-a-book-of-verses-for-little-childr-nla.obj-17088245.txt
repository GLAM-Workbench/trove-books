Introduction
Several years ago, when searching for material for an anth-
ology of Australian verse suitable for small children, I had the
good fortune accidentally to discover in an educational journal,
three short poems bearing the signature of Charles Hilson. Only
with difficulty did I track down the author, who was at that time
in charge of one of the most remote schools in the Common-
wealth, Wyndham, in Western Australia. From that little inci-
dent dates my interest in and appreciation of Mr. Hilson’s verse.
There are two chief types of children’s verse. In the one,
the author writes about children and their doings, but from the
adult’s point of view. I feel that Robert Louis Stevenson in his
“Child’s Garden of Verses” belongs in a measure to this class.
In the other, the writer identifies himself so closely with the child
mind, that, to all intents and purposes, it is the child himself who
is speaking. Of such poets A. A. Milne is one of the outstanding
examples. It is here, I believe, that Mr. Hilson also belongs, for
he expresses so accurately the thoughts of small children that he
seems to speak as they do themselves. To have succeeded in do-
ing so is, indeed, no small poetical achievement. But, he does
this, largely through one quality—the quality of simplicity, both
in thought and in expression. I feel sure that to Mr. Hilson’s
intimate study of child psychology—he has two youngsters of
his own—can be attributed much of the success of his verse.
Unless a poet possesses the supreme gift of accurate observ-
ation his verses will never live. Mr. Hilson’s power of seeing
and describing exactly the life about him—trees, buds, animals,
butterflies —is a quality that must appeal to all his readers, es-
pecially the young folk. He never over-states, for he has that
economy in the use of words which enables him to say in a stanza
that for which other writers would require two. When to these
attributes we add a sense of humour and a facility in simple im-
agery, we have a combination of qualities which enables Mr.
Hilson to record in verse those emotions of children which have
an eternal appeal. I say, therefore to his little book —“Go forth
and brighten and enlighten the lives of thousands and thousands
of young Australians,” for that is the sincere hope of the author’s
well-wisher.

If Only
And are there no fairies? They say not —but yet.
If only my step were a hundred times lighter.
If only my eyes were a hundred times brighter,
I'd seek for these fairies I never have met
And find them to-morrow before the sun set.
For where there are rainbows to shine from the sky
And beautiful butterflies fluttering by.
And where there are sunbeams to dance on the sea.
Then, here in this world, there are fairies for me.

Blind Man’s Bluff
Uncle Jack went "he" last night.
When Blind Man’s Bluff we played
And how we laughed and shouted
At all the fun he made.
For he not only chased us.
But seemed to know the way
Of coaxing Dad and Mother
And Auntie Gwen to play.
He even groped to Grand-ma
And gave her such a kiss:
And said, “Well, now, I wonder
What little girl is this?”
Page 12


So Cold
How cold it is outside to-night I
How cold upon the stairs!
Poor little seals in homes of ice!
Poor little polar bears!

Their Choice
“Two’s and Three's,” the chickens say,
"Is the best of games to play/'
"No," the piggies grunt and squeak.
"There’s more fun in Hide and Seek."
“Moo,” calls out the poddy calf.
"Tiggy-touch-wood makes me laugh."
“Whoof!” barks puppy. "Let me see!
Dog and Bone appeals to me.”
Page 14


Evening Fun
Dad as a bear—a
Wild one—prowls,
And. when he sees me,
Growls and growls.
Dad. as an engine,
Puff-puffs by:
Dad—prancing gee-gee—
Bucks me high.
Dad, as a jumbo
Charges out.
Chasing me wildly
All about.
Dad then says, “Johnnie,
Off to bed!”
And. with a poker.
Strikes ahead:
Says he: “I'll scare them
Bogeys run ! ! !”
Ah. that's the best, of
Daddy’s fun.
Page 15


Magic
There’s magic in a washing day,
And magic that is true.
When mother makes the linen white
In water that is blue ....
I do not think there's anything
My mother cannot do.
Page 16


Die, Pussie, Die
'l've had my swing
Now Mollie shall try
Slower and slower;
Die, Pussy, die!
Die. Pussy . . . Mollie.
Can you tell why
Poor little pussy
Is ready to die?
I have been wondering.
But I cannot tell.
Couldn't a doctor
Make her quite well.”
"Johnnie, I’ll tell you
Just one little thing.
And that is, I want
My turn on the swing.

Little .Peter Possum - A Song
Little Peter Possum
Fell into a snare;
Little Peter ’Possum
Prayed a possum prayer
Came a pretty lady.
An she set him free:
Then wee Peter Possum
Scampered up a tree.
Soon the tiny creature
Of his manners thought;
Down he sent a bright glance
Which the lady caught:
In it all his thanks, she
Sweetly smiled to see:
And she waved her hanky
To him in the tree.
Page 18


Puppy Changes
When Puppy first saw Golliwog.
He barked that bark of his:
A startled bark, which seemed to say,
How black that fellow is!”
When Puppy next saw Golliwog.
He drooped that car of his:
A wondering droop which seemed to
“How queer that fellow is!”
When Puppy last saw Golliwog.
He wagged that tail of his:
A friendly wag which seemed to say,
"How nice that fellow is!”
Page 19


Little Red Speck
A little red speck of a robin is he—
He s first on a fence-post and then on a tree:
He hops to the poppies, he nods to the phlox,
And bobs for the roses, the pansies and stocks:
A dart down the pathway—a flutter—and then
Perched back on the fence-post is Robin again.
I sometimes have wondered how happy Pd be
If God made a little red robin of me.
Page 20


Pink Piggies
Our baby pigs have pinky skin
Which ruckles out and wrinkles in.
As they squeeze thro' the rails;
And all can squirm and roll and fall.
And squeak a piggy tune —and all
Have twisty, twirly tails.
Page 21


Iff f 111 'fi rriri —
In the City
Down from a window
Away up on high.
At people I peep,
As people pass by.
Hundreds and thousands
Below me appear;
Yet nobody guesses
A little boy’s here.
Hundred and thousands
Are peeped at by one!
■’Peep-a-boo, people!
I’m having such fun.”

Pictures in the Fire
Who can of the pictures tire
That are glowing in the fire?
Of the circus come to town.
Lions, tigers—and a clown
Red of hands and face and clothes,
With a black spot for his nose.
Of the host of red-capped elves,
Clustered round to warm themselves.
Of the cowboys who appear,
Shooting bright sparks far and near.
Dragons black with smoking breath
Scarlet soldiers stab to death.
Crimson suns and moons and stars
Falling down between bars.
I’m so happy when I look
At my fireplace picture book.
Page 23


Laughter Pie
When we pass by
Chuckle Town
All we children spy
Seven jolly
Pastry-cooks
Making laughter-pie.
With joke-water
In a pot
Sliced up smiles they
Sprinkle salt, and
strew:
Set the lot
On a fire to stew.
Merry words are
For the crust
Of this wonder pie.
Lightly mixed with
Tickle flour,
Only they can buy.
So when from the
Oven door.
Out it pops to sight
Every one of
Us who sees
Wishes for a bite.
Page 24


And when those kind
Baker men
Let us have a taste,
Soon we feel a
Laughing pain
Down about the waist.
For each tickle
Joke and smile
Merry word and all.
Passes to us
From that pie.
In that bite so small.
Then we cannot
Help but laugh,
Just to show our mirth
At the host of
Funny things
On this funny earth.
Page 25


Mischief
Our Baby’s blocks could build a tower
So very high,
But Baby wants the bottom brick.
Each time I try.
He’ll shake the tower before it can
Grow up at all;
And clap his hands and shout with joy
To see it fall.
Page 26


The Wind s Jokes
I wish I knew the stories
The gay wind from the seas
Can think of in a moment
And tell to all the trees.
For I have watched them, often,
Bend down as he draws near.
And sway —I'm sure with laughter —
At funny tales they hear.
But if I try to listen.
As surely as I do,
I only hear a “Swish-swish-swish"
And then a long “Whoo-wh-oo.”
Page 21

Make Believe
Oh. I will be an Eskimo,
And build a wee igloo
Or I will be an Indian
With feathers red and blue
Perhaps I’ll be a little Jap,
And wave a little fan;
Or else I’ll paint my face so black
And be an African.
A Burmese boy will Billie be
And trap big elephants:
Or else a Dutchie with his pipe
And patches in his pants.
Or he perhaps may rather take
His chop-sticks in his hand,
And eat his plate of piled-up rice
Away in China land.
Page 28


In the Sunshine
Oh, how bright it is and sunny
In the paddock green to-day.
Where a bee is buzzing gaily
On his honey-finding way;
Where a little black lamb s frisking
Like a happy golliwog;
And a lazy lizard’s blinking
On a warm and crinkly log.
But the bee is taking shelter
In the shivery grasses shade;
And the scared black lamb is darting
Down the pad our cattle made.
Tiny lizard is the bravest,
For it isn't far he’s gone:
Look! he’s blinking in the sunshine
Just a crinkle further on.
Page 29


William Tell
Billie, with your bow and arrows
Are you William Tell?
If you are, I’ll eat my apple!
It may be as well.
Page 30


Robin
“Where is Robin Red Breast?’’
On the garden walk?’’
“No. he's on the clothes line
Bobbing like a cork. - ’
“Where is Robin Red Breast?
Has he fluttered far?”
“No, he’s by the snowdrops
Wondering what they are.”
“Where is Robin Red Breast?”
“Ah, I cannot say:
Posty with his whistle
Frightened him away.”

Fishing
My Daddy has his tackle,
And lunch and pipe has he,
For he is going fishing
And he is taking me.
I’ve string to make a line with,
And I have bent a pin:
Besides, I have a chaff-bag
To put my fishes in.

Fancy
A thistle seed floats down to earth,
A bee drones up the lane:
That thistle-seed's a parachute,
That bee’s' an aeroplane.
Page 33


Saturday
When I wake up on Saturday,
I lie and think like this—
“Now Saturday’s a holiday
Perhaps to-day is Saturday . ,
I wonder is it Saturday?’’
And Saturday it is!
At dinner-time on Saturday
I sit and think like this —
“Now it may only be a dream
To hope for apple pie and cream.
But Saturday means apple pie,"
And—apple pie it is!
When evening comes on Saturday,
I wait and think like this—
“On other nights to bed I go,
But Saturday means picture show
I wonder is it picture show?’’
And picture show it is!

Whistling
Listen to the whistling!
Daddy in his bath:
And the milkman coming
Up the garden path:
Uncle at his motor car
Putting on a tyre:
And our whistling kettle
Whistling on the fire.
Page 35


Let s Pretend
You pretend you're Mother,
And I’ll make out I’m Dad.
And we shall punish Tommy
For all the cakes he’s had.’’
“I grieve to tell you, Father,
What this bad boy has done;
He’s found the cakes I cooked you.
And eaten every one.”
‘‘By jove! The little rascal!
Here, over on my lap!
I’ll teach you my fine fellow!
And now. my dear—the strap!”
‘‘Oh. don’t give me a spanking,
I'd rather do without
For I’ve a pain inside me
And I don’t want one out.”
“Oh, have you? Well, then, Sonny,
We’ll make you better soon.
The castor-oil, please Mother,
And bring your biggest spoon.

Cows in the Cabbages
‘Cow’s in the Cabbages!
Call that and see
A whooping and shouting
Red Indian three.
Dad, with a hay-fork.
Bounds from the crop.
Mum has a broomstick:
I have a mop.
Cow sees us charging.
Swishes her tail.
Rushes, and stumbles
Over a rail.
Then, as she rises.
Whack, whack and whack!
Fork, mop and broomstick
Sound on her back.
"Cow's in the Cabbages!”
Call that and see
A whooping and shouting
Red Indian three.

Mopoke - A Song
“Mopoke! Mopoke!
Quaint little fellow are you!
Mopoke! Mopoke!
Sing me a song that is new."
"No, no, my child, I cannot, for you see
Only one song did my mother teach me.
Mopoke! Mopoke!
That’s all my mother taught me.
Page 38


Roley Poley
Roley Poley, my fat pup.
Mixes shoes and stockings up:
Shakes poor Dad's in playful manner.
Runs with Mother's like a banner
Waving in a gale:
And, if they are torn and holey,
Naughty, wicked, bad wee. Roley
Only wags his tail.
Page 39


The Cross
Poor Mollie’s white bunny—the lop-eared and tame —
Died only last night and I thought it a shame;
For Mollie’s my friend (as poor Bunny was, too),
And Mollie in tears was a Mollie quite new.
I dug a deep grave (as she asked) with my spade,
And sadly within it her little pet laid.
And then, just to show how I felt her great loss,
I sat down and carved her a tiny white cross.
And never, I know, had I loved Mollie more
Than when, with her eyes filled with tear-drops, I saw
Her write on the crosspiece, “Please, all who draw near.
Tread gently, tread softly?—my Bunny lies here.’’

Sweep the littered
Daddy's Hat
Daddy’s hat for Baby!
Shapeless now and worn.
With the band all loosened
And the lining torn:
Yet, of all the playthings
Set on either side,
“Ha,’ Ha’,” old and crumpled
Is our Baby’s pride.
Daddy’s hat for Baby!
Just above the rim
Big brown eyes will sparkle
When you peep at him:
And when busy mother
Hurries for the broom,
With his hat he helps her
Page 41


Daddy’s hat for Baby!
Yes, a carry-all
For the treasures gathered
In his travels small:
And when cot-time calls him,
Does our Babe mind that?
Not when on the bed-post
Sleeps his daddy’s hat.
Page 42


The Little Brown Man
The little brown man
Who bowed to the Queen,
Had one eye of blue.
And one eye of green.
So green was the green.
So blue was the blue.
And both were so bright.
That what did I do?
Fancied the people
Who bowed to the Queen.
Were half of them blue,
And half of them green.

Noah's Ark
Ellie Phant met Kanga Roo,
Then the fun began:
Great big Ellie called to Roo
"Catch me if you can!”
Kanga Roo went hop, hop, hop,
After her in glee.
Touched her lightly as he sped,
"Tug you last,” laughed he.
Happy Ellie. at the touch.
Ceased her gallop slow.
"Doesn’t matter, Roo.” she teased,
"I’d ‘crossed trunk,’ you know.”

Found Out
The weather is your mother, World.
For, thro, the window-pane,
I see that she had come to-day
To wash you in the rain.
Oh, World, I thought that you were big
(As big as I am small)
But when you're treated like a boy,
You are not big at all
Page 45


Fitter Patter
Pitter-Patter-Pitter-Pat
Do we know two sounds like that?
Yes, that’s how the raindrops fall
On the window ledge and wall.
And that’s how we children run
Through the house in search of fun.
Pitter-patter! That’s the tune
For a rainy afternoon
The Engine Driver
Oh, I’m an Engine Driver,
And Billie is the guard.
He waves his flag above him,
And blows his whistle hard.
The engine starts its noisy
“A-puff-puff-puff-a way!”
Around the wheels go spinning.
And “Clanka. clank.” they say
Then Billie in the guard's van,
Waves high his hand so black.
And then my little engine
I race right down the track.

Small Children
Small children of countries
Far over the sea.
It's sunrise for you,
And sunset for me.
For you it is play-time;
For me it is bed;
I wish I were with you
And playing instead.
