GETTING...
Australia’s oldest
industry
By G. J. RODGER
Timber, the first natural
resource to be used by
Australia's early settlers,
today constitutes one
of the nation's largest and
most important industries.
G. J. Rodger, author of this article, is
Director General of the Commonwealth
Forestry and Timber Bureau, Canberra,
A.C.T.
FROM the time of early settle-
ment to the present clay, timber
and other forest products have
played an important role in Aus-
tralia’s development. They have
provided material for food and
shelter, for use in mining, agricul-
ture, various forms of transport
and industry, and for the manu-
facture of an increasing number of
articles which have become normal
requirements to the high standard
of living of our present day.
Land settlement in many parts
of Australia is not yet stabilised
and forest inventories are not com-
plete, but in any case the forest
resources of a country are always
difficult to assess with any degree
of accuracy. They include all the
land carrying trees, whether as
dense forests of valuable sawmill-
ing timber, or as open forest,
savannah woodland and mallee in
drier regions. Moreover, forest
resources are not necessarily con-
fined to the actual product of
the trees. They also include all
the other benefits enjoyed as a
result of tree growth, such as
forest grazing, protection of "he
soil, amelioration of climatic con-


ddions, recreational facilities and
aesthetic values.
It lias been estimated that,
excluding the scattered tree
growth on savannah woodland,
there are about 117,500,000 acres
of land in Australia on which tree
growth is the dominant vegetation.
This, however, includes large areas
of mallee and other forest areas
too low in quality or too inaccess-
ible to be economically exploited.
Hardwoods occupy approxim-
ately 97 per cent of the total
forested area of which the genus
Eucalyptus covers about 94 per
cent. Eucalypts provide timbers,
many of which are of considerable
value on account of their strength
and resistance to decay, termites
and other wood destroying
agencies.
The Eucalypt attains its best
development in the higher rainfall
areas such as occur on the eastern
coast, the highlands of southern
New South Wales, Victoria and
Tasmania, and the south-western
corner of Western Australia. This
forest type is generally character-
ised by a profuse undergrowth
which adds considerably to its
aesthetic attractiveness. The more
important commercial species in
these regions include the blackbutt,
tallowwood, flooded gum and red
mahogany of New South Wales
and Queensland, the alpine ash of
Tasmania, Victoria and New South
Wales, the mountain ash, messmate
anct\ blue gum of Victoria and
Tasmania and the karri of Western
Australia. For height and gran-
deur. the mountain ash of Victoria
and Tasmania and the karri of
Western Australia are unequalled
among the hardwoods of the world,
and are excelled in these directions
only by a few softwood species in
North America. Hardwoods other
than Eucalypts also found in this
type of forest on the eastern coast
are turpentine a valuable pile
timber very resistant to the attack
of teredo beetle —and brush box.
In the drier coastal regions
where the rainfall is too low for
the former type to flourish, the
Enealypt forest contain many
durable species such as the iron-
barks, grey gums and bloodwoods
of the east coast and the jarrah
and tuart of Western Australia.
The spotted gum of New South
Wales and Queensland is another
example.
Inland, along most of the rivers
and streams and over the annually
flooded low lying adjacent areas,
occurs a riverain forest in which
the main species is river red gum,
a very durable hardwood which
has supplied large volumes of
sawn timber, railway sleepers and
fence posts for local use.
In areas receiving an average
annual rainfall in the vicinity of
20 inches per annum, or even
considerably less where the annual
rainfall is regular, as it is on the
goldfields of Western Australia,
the Eucalypts occur in open forests
and savannah woodland. These
have a local value which in some
places is very considerable.
In areas receiving a rainfall of
10 to 20 inches per annum, but
subject to periodic dry conditions,
is found the mallee dwarf,
multiple-stemmed Eucalypts
which, by reason of the develop-
ment of large woody swellings
(mallee roots) just below the sur-
face of the soil, are able to success-
fully withstand severe drought and
fire. The mallee is of particular
value for firewood and the leaves
of some species provide valuable
essential oils.
Adjoining the mallee areas
occur open plains carrying scat-
tered smjall trees, amongst which
are to be found a number of
acacias such as brigalow, gidgee,
myall, mulga and the raspberry
jam of Western Australia. Sandal-
wood is also found in this type of
country.
Rain forests cover a little over
3 per cent of the total forested
area of Australia. The rain forest
is of two main types the trop-
iaal and the sub-tropical rain
forest on the coast of New South
Wales and Queensland and the
temperate rain forest of southern
Victoria and Tasmania.
The tropical and sub-tropical
rain forest along the eastern coast
is an extension of the Indo-
Malayan flora which has apparent-
ly replaced the original dominant
Eucalypt vegetation, and is
characterised by the multiplicity
af species it contains. Tropica*!
rain forest occurs in northern
Queensland in the vicinity of
Cairns and on the Atherton Table-
land, providing such well known
cabinet woods as Queensland
maple, Queensland walnut and
silky oak. The Queensland kauri
pine is found in this forest. The
sub-tropical rain forest is found
in southern Queensland and
northern New South Wales and
supplies such timbers as crow’s
ash, black bean, red cedar and
coacliwood. Associated with this
forest are the lioop and bunya
pines.
Temperate rain forest which is
to be seen in the more southern
parts of Victoria and western
Tasmania consists mainly of
myrtle beech, and also produces
southern sassafras and blackwood.
Associated with it are the three
Tasmanian native conifers
celery top pine, huon pine and
King William pine although
supplies of the latter two species
now are practically exhausted.
Cypress pine is widely spread
throughout Australia, but the
main cypress pine forests of com-
mercial value occur in New South
Wales and southern Queensland
west of the Great Dividing Range,
and cover about 2.5 per cent of
the total forested area of Australia.
The trees are comparatively small
but the timber has a particular
value owing to its durability and
resistance to termites. It is suit-
able for use as scantlings, floorings,
linings, weatherboards, poles and
posts. It has been heavily cleared


Among
tall timber
F ROM the tropical forests of
Queensland to the tree-clad slopes
of the Australian Alps and the
dense stands of jarrah in the south-
west, Australians are at work haul-
ing out timber in ever increasing
quantities for the needs of industry.
It is a major activity employing over
100,000 workers in forest services,
milling, marketing, and manufactur-
ing. Value of all products is
estimated at about £165 million
annually. The photos show (top)
timbermen felling a mountain ash
in Victoria, and (below) walnut
stumps from the Atherton Table-
land, Queensland.


THE FINE timbers grown in Queens-
land are used extensively by furni-
ture manufacturers as solid timbers
and as ply and veneers. Cairns
Timber Limited has established a
well-equipped factory at Cairns,
northern Queensland, to turn out
both plywood and veneers. Timber
is logged from stands a few miles
out of the city and hauled to the
factory by huge diesel trucks (left)
and trailers, which traverse winding
bush roads. When the trucks reach
the mill, the logs are lifted (above)
by cranes and stacked in piles in the
yard (right) preparatory to being fed
into the peeling lathe. Best known
of the Queensland timbers are
maple, walnut and silky oak, which
grow in the tropical rain forests of
the north. These forests are an age-
old extension of the Indo-Malayan
flora and have replaced the eucalypts
which predominated originally. This
applies also to the sub-tropical rain
forests of southern Queensland and
northern New South Wales, which
produce such timbers as crow's ash,
black bean, red cedar, coachwood,
and hoop and bunya pines.


As THE logs are needed,
they are fed into the peeling
lathe (right) at Cairns Timber
Limited, and plys and veneers
up to six feet wide, are strip-
ped from them. After strip-
ping, the veneers are trimmed
to remove all defects and are
then glued together (centre
right) by an edge glueing
machine to produce a perfectly
matched sheet. A hot press-
ing machine then welds the
veneer to a plywood base, and
the surface is polished with a
sanding machine (bottom right)
before being despatched to
the market.


and cut for sawmilling in the past
and production from State forests
is now strictly regulated.
Most of the Australian conifers
are slow growing and their regen-
eration in forest would consequent-
ly be very expensive. Very suc-
cessful plantings have, however,
been made of hoop, bunya and
kauri pines in southern Queens-
land, and some planting of hoop
pine has been carried out in
northern New South Wales. The
pitch pines from the southern
States of the U.S.A. and Pinus
patula from Mexico have also been
successfully planted in the sub-
tropics. The main plantings of
exotic species in Australia have
been made in the temperate
southern regions where Monterey
pine, or Radiata pine, from Cali-
fornia has given excellent results
in growth rate, and produce
a very fine general utility soft-
wood. Coniferous plantations at
present cover 356,500 acres or
little more than 3 per cent of the
total forested area of Australia.
Of the total estimated forested
area of about 117,500,000 acres in
Australia, about 73 million acres
are capable of producing only
mallee or other tree growth too
low in quality to be economically
exploitable except for firewood or
mining and small round timbers,
or else are either economically in-
accessible or unavailable for ex-
ploitation by reason of their
reservation in national parks,
water catchment areas, etc. Con-
sequently, there are only about 44
million acres which carry or have
carried economically exploitable
milling timber. A little over 20
million acres have been dedicated
to forest production by State
Governments and nearly another
10 million acres are reserved until
the timber is removed. The remain-
ing 14 million acres are largely
either open Crown lands of insuf-
ficient forestry value to justify
reservation or are private property.
Little of the privately held forest
land is managed or even protected,
and most of it will probably event-
ually be cleared in the course of
settlement.
It can therefore be considered
that for all practical purposes, the
commercial forest area of Aus-
tralia Avill be between 20 million
and 30 million acres, but it needs
to be realised, that, in any large
area of forest, considerable areas
of poor quality forest, and even
inaccessible and barren country,
are unavoidably included. It is
consequently generally believed
that the area of prime commercial
forest in Australia is unlikely to
exceed about 15 million acres.
Although the native forests of
Australia are mainly hardwood
and include timbers unsurpassed
for purposes where strength, dur-
ability and beauty are concerned,
it is a fa et that softwood is cheaper
to grow and foi the major portion
of the uses for which timber is
required it should be more
economical to use than hardwood.
Each Forest Service, therefore,
has a programme of softwood
forest establishment and private
investors are also interested. Of
the 356,000 acres of softwood
plantation established to date,
about 50,000 acres are privately
owned. Some of the softwood
plantations are 40 and more years
of age, and their exploitation is
becoming well developed. In
addition to a number of large saw-
mills established or being estab-
lished, one pulp and paper mill
relying upon softwood plantations
for its raw material has been
established and in operation for
some years.
Since the States control the
forests within their boundaries,
there is no single national forest
policy for Australia, but in general
the forest policies of all States and
Territories are similar, namely, to
protect and develop their commer-
cial forests to ensure the attain-
ment of maximum sustained pro-
ductivity.
The management of Australia’s
forest estate and the attainment of
forest policy requires the economic
application off scientific methods
to forestry, which in turn entails
fundamental research and a train-
ed staff to apply results. Appre-
ciating the national importance
of forestry and the advantages of
centralising matters of such com-
mon interest to the whole of
Australia as forestry research, the
Commonwealth Government has
established the Forestry and Tim-
ber Bureau to provide these
services. The Bureau maintains
the Australian Forestry School at
University standard, and has the
advice of a Board of Higher
Forestry Education, upon which
each Australian University and
Forest Service has a representative.
Graduates from the Australian
Forestry School are now employed
in all the Forest Services of Aus-
tralia and, to an appreciable extent
in private forestry industries.
The nucleus of a Forestry Re-
search Institute has also been
established and four experimental
stations are being operated in co-
operation with State Forest
Services. Already considerable
advances have been made in
improving methods of forest assess-
ment, in the treatment of forest
disorders and in studies of timber
production, supply and usage. A
Forest Products Division has been
established within the Common-
wealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organization to investi-
gate matters of scientific and
industrial interest relating to pro-
ducts of the forest. The work of
this institution has resulted in
considerable improvement in
methods of conversion of forest
products and the avoidance of
waste.
Except for recurrent slumps
and booms associated with domes-
tic and international disturbances,
the output from Australian forests
has progressively increased and is

Valley is transported by water.

now of very considerable propor-
tions. For the year 1952/53 the
output of round timber for all
purposes was about 622 million
cubic feet gross, true volume.
The largest single item was fire-
wood, about 300 million cubic feet,
of which about one-sixth was used
in industry. Eucalypt timbers
provided the bulk of the firewood,
but significant quantities of she-
oak and wattle were also used.
The second largest item was logs
for sawmilling. Some 210 million
cubic feet of hardwood logs and
some 40 million cubic feet of soft-
wood logs were used to produce
sawn timber.
It is of interest to note that the
quantity of plantation grown soft-
wood used for sawmilling has now
reached the significant figure of
16 million cubic feet. This quan-
tity may be expected to increase
very considerably in the next de-
cade and quantitatively, at any
rate, will tend to compensate for
the reduced production from the
natural softwood forests of Queens-
land and New South Wales,
notably hoop pine.
Some 25 million cubic feet of
hardwood logs, mainly eucalypt
timbers, were used for the produc-
tion of sawn or hewn railway
sleepers.
Pulpwood production repre-
sented about 20 million cubic feet
of the total of production. About
three-quarters of this was absorbed
by the. paper and paperboard
industries, whose output includes
newsprint, writing papers, wrap-
ping papers and paperboard.
Approximately two-thirds of the
pulp used in these industries
was produced from local timber,
of which the major portion was of
eucalypt species and about 750,000


cubic feet of local softwood. The
balance of the pulpwood locally
produced was used for the manu-
facture of fibreboards.
The plywood industry used
approximately 1,750,000 cubic
feet of Australian grown hard-
wood logs and about two million
cubic feet of softwood logs.
The remaining quantity of
round timber produced was used
for piles, poles, mining timber,
fence posts, etc.
Some indication of the value of
forests as a resource may be gath-
ered from the fact that over £4O
million has been invested by share-
holders in Australia’s sawmills,
and plywood, paper and pulp
mills, while total annual produc-
tion from sawmills and plywood
mills and paper and pulp mills is
estimated to be worth £125 million.
Definite figures of value are not
available for fibreboard produc-
tion, sleepers, poles, piles and the
numerous other forms of forest
produce, but in the aggregate the
value is very considerable, and
has been very roughly estimated
at £4O million, thus making a total
for all products of about £165
million. In addition to the pro-
ducts itemised, there are a num-
ber of products of the forest such
as bark and other tanning mater-
ials, sandalwood and sandalwood
oil, other essential oils such as
eucalyptus ti-tree and citron
scented oils, honey, beeswax and
lawyer canes.
The harvesting and production
of all the various forms of forest
produce creates employment and
contributes to the national wealth.
Forests are an important resource
for the employment of labour.
From the point of view of popu-
lation distribution it is of interest
to note that a large proportion of
the labour is employed in a rural
industry. The number of persons
now engaged in the forest services
and in felling, splitting, hewing
and delivering timber to market is
about 35,000 and the number
employed in sawmills and plywood
mills is about 40,000. Secondary
industries using timber or other
forest produce as a major raw
material employ at least a further
35,000 persons.
When the natural forests receive
the intensive protection and treat-
ment that is becoming progress-
ively moie necessary, the number
of persons productively employed
in them will be very much increas-
ed, while an adequate area of
plantations will require labour on
a considerable scale. Actually, a
complete plantation unit with
planting, pruning, exploitation
and protection in full swing,
absorbs more men per unit of area
than many forms of agriculture,
and from this aspect is, under
appropriate conditions, by far the
best form of land settlement.
Since the very early days when
shipments of New South Wales’
timber were sent to lI.M. Dock-
yards, some Australian timbers
have gained a world wide reputa-
tion. Nor example, jarrah sleepers
from Western Australia have been
used in South Africa, Ceylon,
Mauritius, Malaya, various Middle
East countries and elsewhere;
Tasmanian blue gum piles and
New South Wales turpentine piles
have been sent to many harbours
throughout the world; jarrah and
karri for wagon scantlings, mine
guides, etc., have been eagerly
sought on the United Kingdom
and other European markets; New
South Wales spotted gum and
other mixed hardwoods are popu-
lar with the South African Rail-
ways; New South Wales ironbark
is in keen demand for use in the
construction of boats plying in sub-
Arctic waters; New Zealand has
always looked to Australia for
supplies of sleepers, poles, piles,
crossarms and harbour timbers,
while many other islands of the
Pacific are traditionally dependent
on Australia for their essential
timber needs; Queensland walnut,
silky oak and Queensland maple
are a few of the decorative timbers
highly prized by overseas countries.
Owing, however, to the demands
of local industry, exports of all
timbers are on a reduced scale and
generally are of the types and
quantities surplus to domestic
requirements, or for which inter-
state transport is not available'to
send the timber from locality of
production to locality of demand.
Nevertheless, in 1952-1953 over
three million cubic feet of sawn
timber, one million cubic feet of
round timber and about 700,000
cubic feet of sleepers were exported
from Australia, the f.o.b. value
being about £3,800,000.
On the other hand, Australia
has for over half a century import-
ed considerable quantities of soft-
wood timber. Wartime difficulties
and post-war limitations in over-
seas credits, and particularly
dollar expenditure, have undoubt-
edly led to a reduction in softwood
imports and to a more extended
use of local hardwoods compared
with pre-war years, except for a
temporary flood of imports about
two years ago. In 1952/53,
imports were about 10 million
cubic feet, and .it. is interesting to
note that the f.o.b. value country
of origin of this timber was about
£5,500,000. This quantity was,
however, probably less than the
average annual requirements.
With the growth of population
and increased overall consumption
likely, it appears that considerable
imports will be required against
the time when Australian softwood
plantations cover a sufficient area
and are old enough to produce the
softwood needs of this country.
It is safe to say that important
as Australian forests have been in
the past as a source of forest pro-
ducts and the employment of
capital and labour, they are des-
tined to be far greater in the
future if sufficient attention is
given to their protection and
treatment. END#
