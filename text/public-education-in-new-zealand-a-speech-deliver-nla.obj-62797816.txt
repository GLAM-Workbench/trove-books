PUBLIC EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND.
It has not been the custom hitherto for the Minister of
Education to make any formal statement about the working
of his department. Seeing, however, the natural and
gradual increase of the vote for education in proportion
to the increase of population, and the need there is in
every country of taking care that the lines on which the
State aid to education is granted are such as commend
themselves to the community, I have thought it proper to
make a short statement about the educational position of
this colony. Ido not think there is any need of apology
for my doing so. It is considered the duty of other
Ministers with respect to their several departments to
report to the House, outside of the official departmental
reports, what has been accomplished during the recess,
and also, if necessary, to indicate what reforms may be
made in the departments under their control. There is
no department so important as that of Education. A
railway here or there may be of importance to some
particular districts, but if it be not made, or even if it
should be made in the wrong place, these things can be
repaired; but the days of granting education to youth
are limited, and, once passed, they cannot be recovered.
If, then, our children are not obtaining a proper education,
we, as a State, are guilty of great neglect. We are
preventing them from making the best possible of their
life in the future. I have thought it best, in order that
members may haye a full view of all that the colony is
doing for education, to divide what I have to say under
several heads. I propose, first, to show what our educa-


tional machinery is, and what the State does for higher,
secondary, and primary education. I then propose to point
out what reforms are being made, and in what direction I
think there is need of further reform. I also intend to
refer to what the State is doing in the way of museums
and scientific instruction, and I shall also speak of the
Native schools, the school for the deaf-mutes, and the
State industrial schools. Having shown what the State
is doing, I shall then point out some reasons why I think
that State interference with education should not at present
cease, and why Parliament should pass heartily the sums
that are asked for the continuance of our system.
And first as to our educational machinery, I would
point out that, unlike that of other colonies, and of the
Mother-country, our central Education Department is of
a very limited character. Even in England, where it has
been said that there is no such thing as State education
but only State aid to schools, there is a larger central
staff proportionately to the population than we have. In
New Zealand there are only the Secretary to the Education
Department, the Inspector-General of Schools, three clerks,
and three cadets. The Native schools, being directly
under the control of the Education Department, have an
organizing Inspector, hut the staff I have mentioned is all
that the central Government has for the distribution of
the large sums of money placed under its control, and to
aid the Minister in dealing with university, secondary, and
primary education, and Native and industrial schools. It
will he seen, therefore, that the administration of education
is left almost entirely to local management.
Coming to the university?the New Zealand University
was first established hy Act in 1870. That Act might well
he termed tentative in its nature : little was done under it,
and it was not until 1874 that the present New Zealand
University was reconstituted, and really came into life. In
its management the State has very little voice. There are
two bodies, the Senate and the Convocation. The Senate
consists of twenty-four Fellows ; one-half are elected by


the graduates, and the other half by the Senate itself.
The Convocation consists of the graduates above the de-
gree of Bachelor, and all Bachelors of two years? standing.
These two Courts have the control of the University. The
Governor in Council has a vetoing power, because every
election to the Senate is subject to his approval, and statutes
and regulations have to be approved and sanctioned by
him before they become operative, and the Governor is
also the Visitor of the University, having the powers that
Visitors of such institutions possess. But, further than
this, the Government cannot interfere. lam not proposing
to meddle with the university, but I think it is to be
regretted that there should not have been some provision
for more direct Governmental control in the management
of the highest education of the State. A fund placed by
the State at the disposal of the university consists of the
sum of three thousand pounds a year, paid out of the Con-
solidated Fund. The reserves that have been set apart
throughout the colony for university purposes have been
localized, except what are called the Colonial University
reserves at Auckland, which it is proposed to deal with
this session; and Colonial University reserves of 10,000
acres in Taranaki, 4,000 acres in the Waitotara district,
1,500 acres at Ashburton, and 30 acres in Westland.
With this exception the reserves belong to the
separate institutions which perform the teaching func-
tions of a university in the various districts. The New
Zealand University is strictly an examining institution ;
it confers degrees, but it has no teachers in its employ-
ment. The teaching part of the university work is done
by affiliated institutions. At present they are as follows :
The Otago University at Dunedin, the Canterbury College
in Christchurch, the Auckland University College in Auck-
land, the Nelson College at Nelson, and St. John?s College,
Auckland.
Over some of these institutions the Government has
considerable control; for example, the Otago University
Council, that has the management of the Otago University,


is wholly appointed by the Governor; in Auckland, three
members (for the present six) of the Council of the Auckland
University College are appointed by the Governor, who also
appoints the members of the governing body of Nelson
College. With regard to the Canterbury College, however,
when vacancies arise in the managing body of the college,
members are appointed by the graduates of the New
Zealand University on the books of the college, so that,
so far as it is concerned, the State has no voice in its
management. St. John?s College, Auckland, is a Church
of England institution. These various affiliated institutions
perform, as I have already said, the teaching work of the
University, and in some of them there is ample provision
made for giving a high-class university education. In
Auckland there are four Professors, tilling the following
chairs: 1. Classics and English; 2. Mathematics; 3.
Chemistry and Experimental Physics; 4. Natural Science.
In Canterbury College there are six Professors (for
classics, English language and literature, mathematics
and natural philosophy, chemistry and physics, geology
and palaeontology, and biology), and lecturers on modern
languages and jurisprudence.
In Otago University there are eight Professors (for
classics, English constitutional history and political eco-
nomy, mathematics and natural philosophy, chemistry,
mental and moral philosophy, biology, anatomy and physio-
logy, and mining and mineralogy), and nine lecturers on
law, French, German, surgery, materia medica, practice of
medicine, pathology, midwifery and medical jurisprudence
and public health.
The other institutions are not so well provided with
teachers. These affiliated institutions are maintained as
follows : Auckland has a grant of �4,000 a year from the
General Government, Nelson, Canterbury, and Otago are
maintained by revenues from reserves, fees, endowments,
& c.
It is not necessary for me to dwell at present on the
need of university education for New Zealand. I shall


refer to tins before I finish my sketch of our edu-
cational work. I may say, however, that I have had
statistics prepared to show the results of our university
education, and I think they may he said to he extremely
gratifying. I will not repeat xvhat members perhaps arc
aware of?the results in previous years ?hut I may take
for example simply what happened at the last degree-
capping at the Edinburgh University. I find that the
New Zealand youths stood exceedingly high. Mr.* Jeffcoat,
of Dunedin, a B.A. of the New Zealand University, took
senior first-class honours and medals in materia medica and
general pathology. His position in materia medica was
first out of eight who succeeded, and his position in general
pathology was the highest. Mr. Lindsay, another New
Zealand B.A. trained in the Otago University, took first-
class honours in materia medica, and the fourth position
amongst the eight who succeeded. He took first-class
honours, junior division, at general pathology, fifth out of
eighteen that succeeded. He took a second-class certificate
in clinical surgery, the twelfth out of forty-eight who were
successful. I find others who have had the benefits of uni-
versity education in New Zealand also standing high. Mr.
Eleming took second-class honours in practical physiology,
being the first out of six who were successful. He took
the same class honours in general pathology, the twenty-
eighth out of sixty-seven who were successful, and the
same in clinical surgery, fortieth out of forty-eight. Mr.
McKenzie took senior first-class honours in the practice of
physic, being the sixth out of thirteen who succeeded. Mr.
Allan took junior second-class honours in general pathology;
he also took the same in the Institutes of Medicine,
and the same in clinical surgery. Other New Zealand
youths have also distinguished themselves. Mr. Robertson
took first-class honours, senior division, in surgery, the
highest out of eight who were successful; and Mr. Borth-
wick took first-class honours and the medal in the junior
division in the Institutes of Medicine, being third out of
seventeen who were successful, and second-class honours in


practical physiology. Mr. Westenra took senior division
second-class honours in surgery. Mr. King took junior
division honours in the-practice of physic. Mr. Williams
took junior division second-class honours in the practice of
physic. Mr. Hawkes took second-class honours in general
pathology. Three competitions have been held in New
Zealand for the Gilchrist Scholarship of �IOO a year, the
test examination being the same as that undergone hv can-
didates for matriculation at the University of London. At
the competition in 1880 the scholarship was gained with
much credit by Mr. Herbert, 8.A., of Canterbury College,
who was a master in Napier High School. Three can-
didates offered themselves for examination in 1883, when
the successful competitor was Mr. Salmond, M.A., of Otago
Univeisity, who was placed by the London examiners
? equal with the first candidate in the original honours
list of all that were examined for matriculation by the
London University in June, 1882. Mr. Salmond has
just terminated his second years? attendance at the London
University College. At the close of his first year?s course
he took the first prize in the classes he attended. He
passed the intermediate examination in Laws at London
University in first-class honours (being the first of two
who gained this distinction among eighty competitors),
and obtained the exhibition of �4O a year for two years!
At the third examination in July last year there were five
competitors ; three from Canterbury College, one from
Auckland University College, and one, a lady, from Otago
University. The successful candidate was Mr, Inglis,
L.A., of Canterbury College, who took a high place in the
? honours division?; while three competitors, including the
lady candidate, took good positions in the ? first division,?
and one failed. AVere Ito look at the records of other
Home universities, where others of our youths are who
have been trained in New Zealand, it would be seen that
they occupy good positions. I only mention this inci-
dentally, for the purpose of showing that our university
institutions and schools are doing good work, and that


colonial youths, if opportunities are given to them, can
acquit themselves as well as those who hail from the Parent-
country.
So far as secondary education is concerned, there arc
in New Zealand the following secondary schools, viz.:
Auckland College and Grammar School, Auckland Girls?
High School, Thames High School (for hoys and girls), New
Plymouth High School (for hoys and girls), Wanganui
Endowed School, Wellington College, Wellington Girls?
High School, Napier Boys? High School, Napier Girls High
School, Nelson College, Nelson Girls? College, Christ?s
College Grammar School, Christchurch, Christchurch Boys?
High School, Christchurch Girls? High School, Bangiora
High School (for hoys and girls), Akaroa High School
(for hoys and girls), Ashburton High School (for hoys and
girls), Timaru High School (for hoys and girls), Waitaki
High School, Otago Boys? High School, Otago Girls? High
School, Southland Boys? High School, and Southland Girls?
High School. All these are in full operation. The fol-
lowing have been constituted hy Acts of the Legislatme,
hut have not yet begun work; Wanganui High School,
Greymouth High School, Hokitika High School, and Wai-
mate High School. The Whangarei High School is closed
for the present, hut it is proposed in the Forest Bill now
before the House to reconstitute if as a forestry and agiicul-
tural school. The Board of the Hokitika High School is
taking steps to begin work, and with every hope of
success.
Of these, the following received assistance directly out
of the Consolidated Fund last year : Auckland Girls High
School, �1,000; New Plymouth High School, �200;
Wellington College, �150; Wellington Girls? High School,
�350 ; Nelson Girls? College, �500; Christchurch Girls?
High School, �200; Timaru High School, �400; and
Waitaki High School, �SOO ; the total amount voted being
�3,300.
The others, which did not receive assistance, have been
endowed with land and money from the Crown, fiom


associations, and from private individuals. The Inspector-
General of Schools has authority to inspect most of these
schools, and he has done so, and his report will he sub-
mitted to you. When the Education Act was being passed
in this House, I doubted the wisdom of divorcing the
secondary from the primary schools. I then thought that
they might have been controlled by the same Boards of
Management, and that the functions of the Boards might
have been so defined by statute that there would have
been no danger of funds belonging to secondary schools
being taken for primary schools, or of funds belonging to
primary schools being taken for secondary. However, Par-
liament thought otherwise; and hence arose the need of hav-
ing separate Boards to deal with the secondary schools in
the several districts. On many of the Boards the Govern-
ment have representatives, that is, several members are
appointed by the Government for varying terms of years.
The Government appoints two members of the Board of
each of the following institutions : Whangarei, Ashburton,
Greymouth, Waitaki, Otago, and Invercargill High Schools;
one member of the Board of each of the High Schools
at Napier, Timaru, and Hokitika; three members of the
Thames High School Board; and four members of the
Wellington College Board. The Governor of the colony,
in his capacity of Visitor, appoints all the nine members of
the Nelson College Board. Independently, then, of the
general inspection by the Inspector-General of Schools, the
Government has some voice in the management of the
secondary schools; for it has the power of appointing
members of the managing bodies. The Government has
however, no direct control over them; it cannot prescribe
their courses of study, nor can it interfere with their internal
management, nor can it even provide that their course of
tuition shall stand in a proper relation to that of the primary
schools or of the university. This, I think, is to be re-
gretted. However, it may not be expedient at present to
interfere with their course of instruction, I intend, how-
ever, to state presently what the Education Department has


done in making suggestions to them regarding a part o�
education that has been much neglected in the past.
I now come to the primary schools, still dealing only
with what may be termed the machinery of the Act. I
have already described the constitution of the central
department. AVe have thirteen Education Boards, which
have the general management of education in their districts;
and for each school district there is a School Committee,
elected annually by householders and parents of children.
There is rarely more than one school in each district. The
cumulative-voting principle is applicable to the election of
these Committees, and, speaking from experience extending
over seven years, I think it can be said that the Act in this
respect has worked well. No doubt, in small districts and
at small meetings, it may have happened that men alto-
gether unfit to have the administration of educational affairs
have occasionally been put on Committees, but I do not
think that any permanent, or even any slight, injury has
been inflicted on education by the election of one or two
men of this kind. The Committees take considerable
interest in the educational affairs of their own districts.
The Boards are elected by the School Committees. Each
Board consists of nine members, and three retire annually;
and, on the whole, I think the colony is to be congratu-
lated on the men who have undertaken the arduous,
and often thankless, task of doing Education Board duty.
Throughout the colony I believe the Boards have striven to
carry out the provisions of the Act; and, though there have
been misunderstandings between the Boards and some of the
Committees in almost all the districts, yet the Boards have
done good work, and raised the standard of education. The
Boards have the appointment of the head masters and
assistant teachers, and, most Boards have, I think wisely,
consulted the Committees before appointments were made,
and, except in very rare instances, have deferred to the
opinion of the Committees in the appointment of teachers.
The power of the dismissal of teachers virtually rests with
the Boards, and no doubt the advantage of that has been


that the teacher?s position has been more secure than it was
before the new Education Act came into force. The chance
of a good teacher obtaining promotion is now better than
under the old systems; for formerly Committees were
allowed the power of appointment and dismissal.
The aid annually granted by the State to the primary
schools is at the rate of �4 for every child in average daily
attendance; this is made up of the statutory vote of �3
15s v and a special grant of 55., that has been voted for
the last three years. There is also a grant of Is. 6d. a
head for the maintenance of scholarships to the secondary
schools. In addition to the capitation grants the follow-
ing sums are voted : �4,000 for distribution among the
several Education Boards, to assist them in making suffi-
cient provision for the inspection of the schools ; and
�B,OOO for the maintenance of the training colleges for
teachers at Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dun-
edin. Special grants are also made for school buildings,
and for the purchase and improvement of sites and play-
grounds, Of course, as the number of children increases,
these grants must yearly increase. I think, however, that
as population increases the Boards should be able to
economize in their management. It is well known that it
is cheaper to teach a large school than a small school?l
mean relatively to the number of the children. I hope the
time may come when the extra ss, which has been granted
for the last three years may be dispensed with. The reason
why I mention this is, not that I personally think we are
now, even with this extra sum, paying too much for educa-
tion, but I know that our education system has many
enemies, and that the question of expense will be fastened
on as one objection to it. The Boards and Com-
mittees who really desire to see the State-education
system maintained efficiently should do what they
can to aid the department in reducing expenditure,
so far as is consistent with efficiency. There are under
the thirteen Boards 976 primary schools, and eleven
district high schools, that is, schools combining some


secondary school-work with primary teaching. These
have 1,657 teachers, 790 pupil-teachers, and 161 sewing-
mistresses; and the current cost is �313,316, being at the
rate of �4 3s. 3ld. each for 75,391 pupils in average attend-
ance, or �3 4s. 9id. each for 96,840 pupils on the rolls.
The expenditure on school buildings for last year was
�49,679, or at the rate of 13s. 2\d. for each scholar in
average attendance, and 10s. 3d. per pupil on the rolls.
The department also gives aid to normal schools
?schools providing for the training of teachers. Every
district has a pupil-teacher system, and, valuable as is
this system for the training of teachers, it has been
rightly felt that there should he some training college
to which pupil-teachers might go for the perfecting of
their studies in teaching. There are training colleges or
normal schools at Auckland, at Wellington, at Christ-
church, and at Dunedin, and no doubt as other districts
increase they may he able to establish similar institutions.
At present, four are, I think, sufficient for the wants of
the colony. The students in the normal schools at Auck-
land, Christchurch, and Dunedin have the opportunity of
attending the university college lectures. Those in Wel-
lington have not had the same advantages in this respect,
hut the Wellington Board has done what it could to make
up for the want of university teaching. Classes in science
have been formed, and steps have been taken to render
the teaching of the students as effective as possible.
This, then, briefly stated, is the machinery of our
State-education system. I may he asked, What has been
the result ? It is impossible to accurately guage the result
of an education system in seven years, or even in fourteen
or twenty-one years. There are signs, however, that our
education system is doing excellent work. It is perhaps
not necessary for me to refer to the number of our univer-
sity students as compared with our population. I believe,
however, that we show as many real university students
for our population as any country in the world; and,
though our primary - school system is not equal to


that of some other countries, it is gradually improv-
ing, and, with some alterations that I propose to
make, it will still further improve. There is one
thing that may be taken as some test of what education is
doing for the colony, and that is, the number of teachers
who have been trained in New Zealand, and are now teach-
ing in our schools, excluding pupil-teachers. I have the
statistics of all the schools in the colony save about ninety,
and I find that in these schools there are altogether 1,550
teachers, and of these 1,034 were trained in New Zealand,
of whom there were 338 who were born in New Zealand,
307 who though born elsewhere have been educated from
boyhood or girlhood in New Zealand, and 389 who were
mainly educated out of the colony, but first became teachers
after their arrival in New Zealand. One hundred and
eleven teachers of primary schools were trained in Australia,
392 in Great Britain and Ireland, and thirteen elsewhere.
In our secondary schools we have, out of 139 teachers,
twenty-nine who were born in New Zealand; twenty
who have been trained from early youth in New Zealand,
though born elsewhere; twenty-two who were trained as
teachers in New Zealand, though mainly educated out of
the colony ; nine Australian teachers; fifty-seven from
Great Britain and Ireland j and two educated elsewhere.
I have also some statistics of those who have been educated
in the colony who have obtained positions in our various
professions and in our mercantile houses and in our
Government offices, and it is surprising to see the number
of native-trained youths who have distinguished themselves
in every department as professional men, as merchants,
as manufacturers, and in the Government service.
And now as to the weaknesses of our system. It seems
to me that it has been weak in three respects. First, there
has not been a proper gradation between the primary and
secondary schools; secondly, there has been more attention
paid to the literary part of education than to the scientific;
and, thirdly, technical instruction has been almost entirely
ignored. Reforms in education, however, like reforms in


everything else, must come slowly; and it is impossible
for any Minister for Education to do at once all that he
thinks ought to he done to make an education system com-
plete. So far as the gradation between the primary and
secondary schools is concerned, existing defects can only be
remedied as population grows denser. I hope, however,
that in the chief towns of the colony, without waiting for
a great increase of population, some effort will at once be
made to prevent the attendance of too young children
in our high or grammar schools. I think that there
ought to be no admission into a high or grammar school
until, at all events, the Fourth Standard of the primary
schools has been passed. There are difficulties in laying
down such a rule. One difficulty is, that there is no pro-
vision for giving the first rudiments of a high literary or
classical education in our primary schools, and that chil-
dren who have passed the Fourth Standard, beginning
the study of Latin, or French, or German somewhat late,
may be placed at a disadvantage compared with those who,
having less knowledge of English, may have begun the
study of these foreign languages earlier. I see reason to
hope, however, that the Fourth Standard may be passed by
children at an earlier age on the average than at present;
and that, by grounding the children well in the earlier
standards, and teaching them sci'entifically, this may be
accomplished without any cry of over-pressure. I only
suggest a stricter examination; but I am firmly convinced
that much of the hostility manifested towards the secondary
schools has arisen from the fact that the secondary schools
have been for many children mere elementary schools, so
that there seemed to be some reason to complain that the
high schools were not real high schools in the true sense
of the term. Of course, there is always another side to
a question, and the other side of this question, from the
high-school point of view, is this ; that the younger chil-
dren pay large fees for the elementary teaching they
receive, and that the high school is thus enabled to give
education in the higher branches at a cheap rate, so that


the authorities may say: ?If you have such a strict exami-
nation as you suggest, we shall be unable to teach the
higher branches with our present revenues, and the State
must supplement them ? This, no doubt, is a difficulty,
especially when every pound paid for higher education is
grudged by many in this community. I therefore think
that, before much can be accomplished in the direction of
doing away with elementary teaching in secondary schools,
population must become more dense, and that the standards
for primary schools must be slightly altered, so that their
pupils can more easily change from a primary to a secondary
school.
The second point is scientific education. We have
brought with us to our colony the idea that our fathers
had about high-class education, and their idea was that
a high-class education must be a literary education,
an acquaintance with languages, an acquaintance with the
literature of ancient peoples, an acquaintance with philo-
sophy. In these days scientific education has taken great
strides, and everywhere throughout the world efforts are
being made to teach science in such a way that, indepen-
dently of the information it contains, it may afford a
mental gymnastic equal in value with that which is supplied
by the study of any classical language. The University of
New Zealand has wisely recognised this, and so have the
affiliated colleges, though the recognition can only take
practical shape to the extent allowed by their revenues.
Considerable stress has for some time been placed upon
scientific attainments, and now persons may obtain degrees
in science without having passed in more than two languages,
and one of the languages maybe English and the other French
or German or Italian. The pass for a Bachelor of Science
is as follows: Mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology,
and any two out of the five following subjects : Latin,
Greek, English, modern languages, mental science. A can-
didate can both matriculate and afterwards proceed to the
B.Sc. degree without any knowledge of the classics.
I am also glad to state that in the secondary schools


considerable advance bas been made in providing for scien-
tific education. Several of them have science masters, and
all of them are doing something to teach science.
When I give an account of the alterations I have made
in the standards, I shall point out what position science
is to occupy in the primary schools.
I shall now deal with technical education. Something
has been done in this direction. Let me, however, state
that the phrase ? technical education ? is often mis-
understood, No school can so equip any youth for the
trade he intends to follow as to render an appprenticeship
unnecessary. Our schools cannot be utilized?neither our
primary nor secondary schools for direct training for
special trades. The workshop,.after all, must be the school
for the mechanic. All that we can hope to do in primary
or secondary schools is to so teach a boy the theory appli-
cable to any trade that the practice may become easy to
him, and also to so train him that he may have a bias
towards industry. The training may, perhaps, include,
where circumstances will permit, some practical exercises
in the handling of tools. Believing in the great advantages
of technical education to this colony as likely to promote
the development of our manufacturing, our mining, and
our agricultural pursuits, I addressed, through the depart-
ment, a letter to the various secondary schools in this
colony, a copy of which will be found annexed to the re-
port of the Education Department laid on the table of the
House. lam glad to state that this letter has met with
hearty response from almost all the schools, and efforts
have been made to establish technical and science classes.
I have not time to refer specially to what has been done
in the various districts, but it is certain that much will
be accomplished in future years. It is not necessary that
I should now defend technical education. This I may lay
down as an axiom, that the more numerous the manufac-
tures of a country are, the higher will be the intelligence
of its inhabitants; and manufactures cannot be properly
developed till more attention is paid to technical education.


I now come to deal with the standards of the primary
schools; for, after all, it is to the primary schools we must
mainly look for the education of the people of the colony.
There are only a few that can afford to finish their educa-
tion at the secondary schools, and fewer still that can afford
the time to obtain a university education. I shall not
weary you by going over the standards, especially as
members will have an opportunity of seeing the old stand-
ards and the present standards, and of comparing them.
I shall point out what my aim has been in altering them.
I found that the objections to the standards were various.
One main objection, and one which it is always difficult
to overcome, is that, in order to conduct even the small
schools in the country districts, there must be a large
number of classes. Suppose there are six standards, there
will require to be more than six classes, because there are
usually some children not yet able to undertake even the
work of the First Standard, and some of these classes have
to be instructed in geography, history, and grammar; and,
if it was impossible for a single teacher do all this work,
what then was to be done ? I have so arranged the stand-
ards that a teacher will be able in country schools to reduce
the number of his classes. I have divided the subjects to
be taught in the schools under three heads: they are
the compulsory subjects, the class-subjects, and the
additional. Compulsory subjects, of course, are those in
which no child who does not pass individually can obtain
a certificate for the standard. The class-subjects are
to be examined in class, and the Inspector is to report
as to how the children acquit themselves. In the addi-
tional subjects there must be some elasticity allowed : some
schools may not be able to undertake them. By making
history a class-subject and not a pass-subject, and by mak-
ing the geography for the pass of an elementary kind, and
treating geography as a class-subject, except in Standards
111. and Y., I have, I hope, made it possible for teachers
of small schools to get rid of many disadvantages under
which they now labour, and rendered it very unlikely


that any reasonable critic will say that the children are
made to suffer from over-pressure. In order, however,
to provide for the teaching of technical science some-
thing must be done in the primary schools. What, then,
can be done ? Following the recommendation of the
Royal Commissioners on technical instruction, who re-
ported last year to the British Government, I have included
drawing as one of the compulsory subjects. Drawing is of
very great importance to most of our trades; the carpenter,
the builder, the engineer, the cabinetmaker, the pattern-
maker, the manufacturer, the dressmaker ?almost all ?re-
quire to know drawing. It is, in fact, the first step in
technical education, and I propose that it shall be com-
pulsory in all the standards. I shall not expect that the
pass will be high, and I shall not seek to enforce this com-
pulsory subject in the higher standards at once. I know
that there are many good teachers throughout the colony
who do not know how to teach drawing, because they have
never been trained, and that is one of the difficulties under
which the education system must labour for many years
to come. I intend, however, by the adoption of drawing
copy-books, and by only requiring at first what may be
termed an elementary pass, to lay the lines for the develop-
ment of drawing, it being, as I have said, the basis of all
technical-science education. Then' I propose that atten-
tion shall be paid to elementary science, and I believe that
elementary science can be taught, not from text-books, but
orally by the teachers, and that it should be taught to
our children from their earliest years, and without any
technical names : geology could be called earth-knowledge ;
botany, plant-knowledge, and so on. And the principles of
mechanics could be taught without text-books, by means of
object-lessons. In schools in the country I think the teachers
should be able to give a special bias towards agriculture,
and in schools in the various town districts a special bias
may be given towards those manufactures that have been,
or are likely to be, established in those towns. This is
the system that is practised in many parts of the Conti-


nent of Europe with very happy results. With the aid of
drawing we may hope to see our manufactures become
more artistic. Defect in this respect, as has been pointed
out by the Commissioners on Technical Education, has been
the great drawback to the manufactures of the English
workman : for sound workmanship he is not to be excelled
by any foreign workman, but he has lacked the artistic
finish and touch of many continental manufacturers.
With this altered syllabus I believe our schools will
be made more efficient; I believe will be made
practical; and I believe that the mental training of the
children will be as well looked after as it is now.
I may say, before I pass to another point, that I
entertain the hope that, perhaps from private munificence,
if not from Government aid, we may see established, at all
events in each large centre, some working school where the
handling of tools may be taught to the children, if only
for an hour or two a week. I regret that with the
means allowed us for education we cannot at present
give any aid in this work.
I must say something about our Native schools.
I think, without casting any reflection on the past
administration of Native schools, I may state that it is
only in recent years that the Native schools have been
doing really effective work, and I believe that the colony
is greatly indebted to the efforts of Mr. Pope, the
Organizing Inspector. He has entered into his work with
great enthusiasm, and I am glad to say that almost every-
where throughout the colony his efforts have been success-
ful, and that many Maori schools are now a credit to us,
and equal to some of our primary schools where white
children are taught. We have sixty-five Native village
schools, in charge of 115 teachers and work mistresses,
and the cost including buildings was about �15,500 last
year. I hope that no one will grudge this expense. The
Maoris, in providing for their own education, have been
most generous ; they invariably give their sites free?in
this respect they are sometimes more generous than


Europeans; and they gave in the past large tracts of land
to be held in trust for the education of their children, I
regret to say that, in some cases, their reserves have not
been utilized for the purposes for which they were set apart.
The Native Committees, who have a share in the management
of the schools, have paid a very large amount of attention
to them, looking after them most carefully. Of course,
there are places where the attendance has fallen away and
the schools declined; but, on the whole, Native schools are
in a flourishing position and are doing excellent work.
Looking over the reports of the Inspector, and comparing
the work with that done in European schools, one sees that
with proper educational opportunities the Maori race will
not be far behind us. I have seen letters of their own
composition written by Maori children, I have seen work done
by them, of all kinds, equal in many respects to that done
by Europeans ; and, seeing that we have a great responsi-
bility in dealing with the Maoris, in providing for their
future, I only regret that many years ago similar
efforts were not made for the training of Maori children.
There are 3,236 attending the schools, of whom 1,834 are
Maoris, half-castes, or between Maori and half-castes, and
these numbers show a great increase, notwithstanding the
decrease of the race. We have also about eighty Maori
children in boarding institutions, wdlere they are trained in
European habits and ideas, and a large proportion of them
are receiving instruction in the higher subjects. We are
using the Native schools as a means of teaching the .Maoris
the elements of sanitary science and social economy. A
text-book, ? Health for the Maori,? has been published in
English and Maori, and Mr. Pope is preparing one on
Social Economy. We also send the schools useful seeds
and plants, with pamphlets showing how to cultivate them.
I shall, with leave of the House, lay one on the table
dealing with this subject, to show the kind of work we are
attempting.
The other schools that are under the Education De-
partment are termed industrial schools. We have insti-


tutions directly under our control in Auckland (at
Newton and Kohimarama), at Burnham in Canter-
bury, and at Caversham in Otago. In connection with
these three institutions there were the following
children at the close of last year: Resident in the
schools, 432; boarded with foster-parents, 384: making
a total of 816 maintained at the expense of the State.
There were also 347 children at service or with friends,
although still under the legal protection of the managers
of the schools. There is also an industrial school and
orphanage at the Thames, supported by the Government,
but under the management of a local committee, in con-
nection with which there were at the end of the year
seventeen committed children, five of whom were at service
or with friends. Members are aware that there are also
what may be termed private institutions to which children
are sent, for whom we pay, as a rule, about seven shillings
per w r eek. These are, St, Mary?s School in Auckland, St.
Joseph?s in Wellington, and St. Mary?s in Nelson. These
institutions are Roman Catholic.
At the end of last year there were 1,446 children of all
classes connected with our industrial schools. I have per-
sonally visited the schools in Auckland (the St. Mary?s,
the Kohimarama, and the Howe Street Home), the schools
at Nelson, and those at Burnham and Caversham, and I
was pleased generally with what I saw. We have in
connection with our industrial schools the boarding-out
system established, which, shortly, is this : the children
are boarded out, we pay seven shillings a week for their
board, and, if they are of suitable age, they attend the
nearest school. At present 392 children, out of the 1,446,
are under this system. These children are under the guar-
dianship of the managers of the industrial schools in their
respective districts. In addition to this, we have a lady
Official Correspondent at Auckland, at Christchurch, and at
Dunedin, and ladies who statedly visit the children. I
am glad to state that these ladies out of love for the
children visit them in' their homes, and pay attention to


tlieir wants ; and here I would specially thank them for
what they have done during the past years. Any one who
chooses to read over the reports that they furnish monthly
to the department will see the care and trouble they
take.
The children committed under the industrial-school
system are of three kinds : children who themselves have
done wrong, and children who were in destitute circum-
stances, or whose parents have either done wiong or
neglected them. The total number committed under the
Act last year was 313, who may be classified as follows :
Destitute, 195; vagrant, 11; residing in disreputable
houses, 23; uncontrollable, 27; guilty of punishable of-
fences, 37; committed by agreement with the parents, 20.
It is not for me perhaps to state what the result of
this industrial-school system has been; I will only say
this, that it has exceeded what might have been expected of
it. Of course every child does not turn out well, nor does
every child trained in the primary or secondary schools,
but I believe that the proportion in industrial schools who
succeed is just as great as in other schools. I have known
instances of children whose parents were criminal, low, and
degraded, who have, through being taken in time and
placed in our industrial schools, turned out good members
of society. Cases of this kind have-come before me almost
every week since I have been Minister of Education.
When these children are able to work they are placed
out to service, and some are apprenticed to trades. Their
earnings, after deduction of cost of clothing and other
necessaries, are placed to their credit in the Savings Bank,
and the several amounts are refunded to them on their
reaching manhood or womanhood in the event of their
conduct proving satisfactory. It is not an unusual thing
for the girls to receive their money as a marriage portion,
and the boys on their satisfying the Minister of Educa-
tion that the money will be applied to some good use, such
as the purchase of a house or land, or beginning business.
A great number of children have thus got a start in life.


and I have been delighted to see from the reports I have
received from officers of the department that many children
who, if not taken any charge of by the State and placed in
industrial schools, would, in all probability, have grown
up to be criminals and a plague to society, have been
made good citizens and are getting on well in the world.
The number of such instances is surprising, and what
the State has to face is really this : whether it is not
better to take the children when young and impression-
able and give them a good moral education, than to
allow them to grow up criminals, and thus cost society
far more than their education costs. But here I might
say one word in reference to the cause of so many children
being in the industrial schools. The statistics show that
it is mainly the fault of the parents?drunken parents,
criminal parents, parents who were leading immoral
lives, parents who did not recognise parental duty?it is
their children who crowd our industrial schools; and I
believe there is need of some more stringent law to make
parents who are criminal and neglectful do their duty,
and I have asked the House this session to amend the
Industrial Schools Act in this direction. There are great
difficulties, no doubt, in dealing with industrial-school chil-
dren : they require peculiar treatment. lam glad to see
that, as a rule, masters in charge of the schools have done
good work. It would be invidious to single out officers,
but I may state that Mr. Titchener, the present manager
of the Caversham Industrial School, has reformed many
that were given up as unreformable. I need not mention
the names?it is unfair to do so to youths who have now
settled down and acted rightly?but several instances
have come before me of lads, who have been given up
as incorrigible, being reformed, and this not by harsh
treatment but by kindness, adroitness, and firmness. I
may here state that the amount of money in the Savings
Bank to the credit of the children at the close of 1884
was �2,756, and that the amount withdrawn and paid to>
the young men and young women whose good conduct


entitled them to their former earnings was last year
�l9O.
In addition to the children committed to the industrial
schools there were, at the close of last year, 159 destitute
children, maintained out of the charitable-aid vote, in
several orphanages which are under the inspection of the
Education Department. There are orphanages at Lyttel-
ton, Motueka, and Parnell. A year previously the number
of such children was 203, so that there has been a diminu-
tion to the extent of 43 during the twelve months.
I must not omit to mention the very interesting work
carried on at the Sumner Deaf-mute Institution, under
the supervision of the Education Department. This in-
stitution is now attended by thirty-six pupils; seven of
them are from Auckland, one from Taranaki, four from
Wellington, one from Hawke's Bay, ten from Canterbury,
and twelve from Otago. Among the pupils is a deaf mute
girl, who has been sent from South Australia to enjoy the
advantages offered by the school. The method of instruc-
tion is that known as the articulation method, by which
deaf mutes are trained to the use of the organs of speech,
and learn both to speak, in the ordinary sense of the word,
and to understand from the motion of the lips the speech
of others. No use is made of finger-signs or other means
employed elsewhere as substitutes for speech. The course
of instruction includes reading and writing in the first
instance, followed by the other subjects of a good school
education. The girls are, of course, also instructed in
sewing, knitting, and other domestic accomplishments.
The ability and zeal of the director, Mr. Van Asch,
are worthy of high commendation, and he is well
seconded by Mrs. Van Asch in promoting the welfare and
comfort of the pupils. I have had the pleasure of visiting
the school, and seeing the nature of the instruction given,
and I must say that the results of Mr. Van Asch?s labours
are surprising and gratifying.
We have other educational institutions that are helped
by the State. We have athenaeums, and mechanics?


institutes, and public libraries. Generally speaking,
the lending of books and the keeping open of reading-
rooms are the main work performed by these insti-
tutions, though they bear different names : in few of
them is provision made for lectures and classes. There are
in some centres classes organized for teaching apprentices
and others in the evening. Voluntary associations are
doing this work in some centres of population?excellent
work of this class has been done in Dunedin by the
Caledonian Society?and Education Boards have provided
drawing-classes and schools of art for many pupils. Our
mechanics? institutes are, however, mainly libraries. Aid is
given to public libraries, the one condition insisted upon
being that the reading-room shall be open to the public
without charge. Because of this restriction many libraries,
including some of our largest, do not receive any part of
the grant. Last year �4,000 was distributed amongst 385
libraries, and the local receipts of these libraries from dona-
tions and members? subscriptions were nearly �9,000. When
I state that there is hardly a village without its library, it will
be seen how advanced we are in this mode of providing
instruction for our population. Indeed, lam tempted to
give a few statistics to show the fondness for reading
amongst our people. The value of books imported was last
year �115,246. This does not include magazines, news-
papers, &c., and books coming by post. Then, the number
of newspapers published was 49 daily and 91 weekly, bi-
weekly, and tri-weekly, and 33 others, making a total of
172, or one to every 3,281 of the population. In England
and Wales the number was 1,962 newspapers, or 1 to every
13,828; in Ireland, 153 newspapers, or Ito every 32,585;
in Scotland, 184 newspapers, or 1 to every 21,013; and in
the United States, 10,771 newspapers, or 1 to every 4,656 of
the population.
Then, there is another means of educating the people?
museums and art-galleries. So far as museums are con-
cerned, we are in advance of the Australian Colonies. The
Canterbury Museum excels those of Sydney and Melbourne,


and. in arrangement of exhibits for scientific purposes the
Otago Museum is second to none I have seen. Our Wel-
lington Museum is full of most interesting exhibits ; its
geological, palaeontological, and mineralogical departments
are especially fine : and it is to be deeply regretted that
there is not a better and larger building in which the able
officers in charge could show the exhibits to greater advan-
tage. In Auckland there is also a museum, which, though
o m
smaller than those I have named, has very interesting ex-
hibits. In art-galleries New Zealand is weak. Auckland
will soon have a fine one; but little has been done in any
other place. There are, however, art societies in Wel-
lington, Christchurch, and Dunedin, and, from the
pictures exhibited, and the enthusiasm that is each year
increasing amongst our young painters, I have no doubt
we shall soon have art-galleries in the three cities I have
named : a colony that can boast of a Gully, and a Rich-
mond, and a Rarraud that have painted its natural beauties
should before long be well supplied with artists and art-
galleries. This brief statement of what is being done
with respect to museums and art-galleries necessarily leads
me up to a question which has been brought prominently
before the Education Department, and it is this : Should
New Zealand have a Science and Art Department, such as
is seen in London ? And first I. have to state that the
separate scientific institutes, aided by the Colonial Institute,
under Dr. Hector?s able management, are to some extent
doing this work. Honourable members are acquainted
with the valuable and interesting volume published each
year of this institute?s transactions, and they see from
time to time manuals and reports on scientific subjects
issued from the Colonial Museum Department, But
this is not all that has to be done by the present
Colonial Museum Department. The Meteorological De-
partment is under Dr. Hector, and his aid in looking after
local industries is always valuable. In fact, to a consider-
able extent, the Colonial Museum acts as a science depart-
ment. No doubt more could be done, but I am afraid


if more were attempted the cost would be begrudged. Na
one can read the reports and scientific papers issued by
this department without seeing that, as a science depart-
ment, it is doing a great deal of useful work. Where,
perhaps, it has been weak in the past has been in the com-
paratively small degree of attention paid to technical
science. Geology, natural history, and meteorology have
too exclusively occupied its attention. All that I think
we can ask the Government to do is to maintain the
present expenditure, and perhaps utilize the Museum
Department, together with the proposed Porcst Depart-
ment, for better promoting the manufactures, and increas-
ing the number, quality, and variety of our local pro-
ductions. In this manner we may help forward our
mining, our agriculture, our fruit-culture, our fisheries,
and our manufactures; and I hope without additional
cost. As to art, I doubt if the colony can at present
afford to do much. We must leave this to private munifi-
cence. With drawing made compulsory in our schools,
with the natural beauty and grandeur to be met with
everywhere in New Zealand, avc surely may expect to
have many artists amongst our children and children?s
children. If avc give sites for art-galleries, should not our
wealthy colonists help ? In Auckland, Mr. McKelvie, with
rare munificence, has giA T en many beautiful pictures, and
it is stated that a large sum has been given by him for an
art-gallery. When our colony gets older, we shall have
others following his good example. We have not, as a
colony, the wealth that can afford to start art-galleries in
our chief towns?the needs of our practical, every-day life
are too many and too incessant; but the time will soon
come when no toA\ r n of any size will be without its museum
and its art-gallery, any more than its common school and
theatre.
Before treating of the duty of the State towards educa-
tion, I may mention incidentally, it being a matter that
was referred to by question in the House last session, what
has been done with reference to education in the Chatham


Islands. In accordance with the promise that was given
last year, one of our most experienced teachers has been
sent to the Chatham Islands, and his letter of instructions
will he found in the Education Report. I recognised that
it was impossible to organize a school at once in a place
like the Chatham Islands, but I requested him to see if
he could not get half- or even quarter-time schools, so that,
if possible, the whole of the children of the islands may he
educated. I have received his first report, and it is very
encouraging. He has started work, and is receiving assist-
ance from both Natives and Europeans. We shall make
arrangements for the establishing of a school at Te One,
and for his visiting other parts of the island. I may here
also state that arrangements have been made with the
Education Board of Auckland for the establishing of a
school at Kawhia.
I have to speak of the duty of the State with re-
ference to education generally. Ido so not because I
believe that there is any desire on the part of the majority
of the colonists for any alteration in what I may term the
essentials of our Education Act, nor because I think there
is any desire to do away with our university, or to destroy
our secondary schools. I know, however, and members
are aware, that our Education Act has been attacked from
various sides. There are some who attack it because, they
say, no religion is taught in the schools ; there are others
who think that the State should not interfere with educa-
tion at all, but that education should he left to private
enterprise or religious organizations; and there is another
class who object to State education because of its expense
to the State, and who say that the cost of education should
he borne by the parents, just as the cost of food and
clothing is borne by them; and there are some who object
on all these grounds.
I think it is wise, in view of the opposition raised in
some quarters to the Education Act, that I should state
shortly what my view of the position of the State is in
dealing with education ; because, if members understand


the position that I take up concerning it, they will under-
stand the lines of administration that I propose for myself
in conducting the department. I should wish it to be
distinctly understood that in much that I am about to
state I am simply expressing my own individual opinions.
On the subject of education it is well known there are diverse
views held by some of my colleagues. First, lat once admit
that, in a possible ideal state of society, there would be no
State schools. I believe that in some possible future time
there will be no need of State schools, for parents and
others will have so recognised their duty to teach children
that the State will not require to interfere ; and I hope that,
as civilization advances, the State functions will not increase,
but become more limited. The future should be such that
the individual is more and not less; but, as practical
politicians, we hare to do with the present, and we are met
with the pressing question of education. Are our children
to be brought up in ignorance, or are they to be edu-
cated ? And when I say that no country in the world
that can be termed civilized has been able to do without
State aid to education in some form or other, the ques-
tion really is, what form that aid shall take. There
are some who are willing that aid should be given by the
State to education, but they think that that aid should
be given to private persons or to corporations or religious
organizations, who will undertake to do all the teaching.
Wherever that system is adopted the State has little con-
trol over the modes of education : all that it can do is to
test the knowledge of the children at certain examinations.
I believe that the mode of teaching is of as much
importance as what is taught, and that if children are
trained to acquire knowledge in a proper way, even if the
knowledge they acquire may appear small, they have been
really educated. Ido not think that the State is called
upon to expend large sums of money in education if it is
to surrender to any persons or corporations or organizations
the control of the education of its youth. It is perhaps
not necessary that I should state the reason why the State


interferes with education at all. It may not be amiss, how-
ever, to repeat what have been termed the canons of a
State education. One writer has said that the arguments
for a State education may be stated somewhat as follows :
First, that the first great right of the State is to exist and
to perpetuate its own existence. Without this there could
be no stability in Government and no such thing as social
order. If this be granted, then, secondly, the State has a
right to do whatever things will tend to preserve its own
existence ; one of these is to establish universal suffrage, as
a recognition of individual rights, and as a necessary
condition of its own existence. Thirdly, it must provide
for universal intelligence and social morality, else universal
suffrage w r ill become a curse to the State. Fourthly, it
must establish universal education as a necessary condition
of universal intelligence and social morality. And, fifthly,
in order to obtain universal education, it must have a
system of public schools. And a recent writer has said
that ? the true function of the State is to make the most
of the citizen. This is its only inexhaustible function
and if anything is to be made of the citizen he must be
educated. These are the grounds of interference by the
State with education, and, as the State must recognise the
rights of children as well as the rights of parents, looking
upon the individual as the social 'unit, it must see that
children are protected from the cruelty, the selfishness, and
the ignorance of parents.
If the State does not do this the result will be, as has
been found throughout the world, an increase of cost to the
State in other directions. If you can get a people universally
intelligent you will have less crime, you will have less vice,
you will have greater thrift, you will have, in fact, a higher
state of society. Then, another view is this : that the
State, in having a system of education, should have such
a system as tends to train the children to the duties of
citizenship, and to make them feel that the duty of citi-
zenship is a paramount one. To establish such a system as
some denominationalists ask, of having as many schools as


there are sects, all endowed by the Government, would
tend, I believe, to social disorder, tend to weaken the ideas
of the duties of citizenship, and not tend to the strengthen-
ing of the State?s position. I need not stop to point out
that, with the numerous sects that exist among us, it would
be impossible to have such a system, except, perhaps, in the
larger towns; and that, unless the State interfered, in
sparsely-populated districts the result would be that there
would be no education at all.
To the objection to our system, that religion is not taught,
I would first say, from a secular point of view, that here
one of the blots on our system is disclosed; for religion is
taught. Our system is supposed to be free, secular, and
compulsory. It is free, it is compulsory in many dis-
tricts, but I do not know that it is secular in any one.
Our school-books are full of what may be termed religious
lessons. If one takes up Nelson?s Royal Readers, which
is the series of school-books in greatest use throughout
the colony, he will find, on page after page, religious
lessons. I shall mention a few ; ?Book YI. : ? Family
Worship,? from the Cottar?s Saturday Night; ?John
Bright on War? (appeal to professing Christians) ; Cole-
ridge?s ? Hymn before Sunrise, in the Yale of Chamouni;?
? Paul at Athens,? by W. J. Fox; ? The Problem of Crea-
tion,? by O. M. Mitchell. Book 111. : ? Little Jim,?
Farmer; ?We are Seven,? Wordsworth; ?The Better
Land,? Mrs. Hemans; ? The Child?s First Grief,? Mrs.
Hemans; ? Lucy Gray,? Wordsworth; ?The Rain Lesson,?
Mrs. Sigourney; ?The Ark and the Dove,? Mrs. Si-
gourney. Book 11. (Third Series) : ? Thou shalt not
steal; ? ? Secrets of Nature ; ? ? The Little Girl?s Good
Morning.? Sequel to 11. : ? Our Daily Bread ; ? ? The
Little Chimney-sweeper; ? ? Lesson from the Flowers ; ?
? The Pet Bird ; ? ? How Fresh on the Mountains; ?
?The Little Orphan,? Mrs, Sewell; ?A Sparrow?s Nest,?
Jane Taylor; ?The King and the Gipsies;? ?British
Birds?-nests; ? ? What is that. Mother ??, Doane ; ? Speak
Gently.?


Those who would have the right to object to the State
system so long as such reading-books are in use, are,
first, those wdio believe that religion should not be
taught to children; and, second, those who believe that,
whether it should be taught or not, it is no part of the
duty of the State to teach it. These classes, however,
have said nothing against our system. They are willing,
for the sake of maintaining a system that is of incalculable
benefit to the colony, to sink their opinions and their
feelings, and they have been found to be the warmest sup-
porters of our present system.
And now I come to another phase of the question. If it
be said that our State system is doing any moral injury to
the children, I say that this question may be tested by sta-
tistics. Our State system has now been seven years in
operation. This period has been sufficient to afford some
test of the system and its results, and the questions we
have to ask ourselves are. Has juvenile crime increased,
and how do children at our schools turn out in after years ?
So far as juvenile crime is concerned, New Zealand is far
more free from it than other countries. If you take, for
example, the number of prisoners from ten to twenty years
of age received into our principal gaols, I find that, of the
population per thousand at that age, there are only 2?4 9
between ten and twenty, being 4?90 per cent, of the total
prisoners. If I go to England and Wales I find that
between the ages of twelve and twenty-one the corre-
sponding proportions are 7*75 and 19'78; in 1878 it was
BT6 and 19'30. If Igo to New South Wales, wdiere
there has been religious teaching in schools, the clergymen
having the right to enter there, I find that from ten to
twenty the proportions are 6?38 and 7*60 respectively. In
Victoria, where the system is more secular than in the
neighbouring colony, the proportions are only 3'94 and
7" 58; in Queensland, where there is the secular system,
4?93 and 12 35. The numbers I have formerly given are
those of prisoners who have been received in the principal
prisons. I have omitted those received hi what are termed


police-gaols; if these be added, the totals for New Zealand
will be 2*96 per thousand. I know it may be said that
there are other causes that have led to the differing results
in the other colonies. This does not affect my contention,
for I adduce the statistics only to show that our own
system has not been productive of any ill consequences
in the direction of crime, and that we are remarkably
free as a colony from any criminal tendency. If Igo to
Scotland I find that in 1881 the prisoners admitted to all
gaols at the age-period from twelve to sixteen was 0'59
per thousand of the population; from sixteen to twenty-
one, the proportion was 19*98. The proportion per cent,
under twenty-one of the total of prisoners was 15*81. In
New Zealand, admitted to all gaols, there were, as I have
said, only 2*96 per thousand from ten to twenty; and it
is to he observed there were only, out of the 287 under
twenty received into the principal gaols, 130 born in New
Zealand. Then, there is another thing I would notice, and
that is this : that the total amount of crime in New
Zealand is not on the increase; on the contrary, there has
been practically a decrease since 1876. This will be found,
from the following statistics :
The total crime, as estimated from convictions after
commitment for trial to superior Courts in New Zealand,
per ten thousand of the population, has fallen from 643
in 1876 to 4-76 in 1881, and to 3*9 in 1884. In New
South Wales the proportions in 1882 and 1883 were 13*3
and 12; in Victoria, 4*B in 1882 and 3*B in 1883. It will
therefore be seen that, so far as convictions are concerned,
there has been a gradual decrease in New Zealand. This is
the case with reference to the more heinous offences, but the
same decrease is apparent in apprehensions and in summons
cases, as well as in summary convictions. In 1876 the
apprehensions and summons cases were 57*14 per thousand
of population; in 1884, 41*81. In 1876 the summary con-
victions were 41*55; in 1884 there were only 31*98; and
the commitments for trial in 1876 were, per ten thousand
of population, 10*68, and in 1884, B*l : so that, so far as


crime is concerned. New Zealand has shown that since the
introduction of the Education Act there has been a decline
of all kinds of crime. I do not mean to say that the
Education Act has caused this ; I only say this : that those
who say that the Education Act tends to larrikinism or to
crime or to vice should look at the statistics, and they will
see that, with a more efficient police force than we ever had,
we have had less crime, fewer apprehensions and summons
cases, fewer commitments for trial, and fewer convictions.
I hope, after the figures I have given, that we shall hear
no more remarks about our State system tending to crime.
On the contrary, the statistics show that crime is yearly
lessening, and I have no doubt that, as the education
of the people progresses, crime will still decrease. Of
course, to get rid of crime is, in our social state, and
will be for centuries, just as impossible as getting rid of
poverty. The training in large towns and many other
causes create anti-social feelings, and anti-social feelings
lead to many kinds of crime. I believe, however, that if we
strengthen the social feeling with reference to the State the
result will be a greater respect for property and a greater
respect for life; and I really think that amongst classes not
at all of the criminal type there is much need of our recog-
nising what the State is. We do not fully realize ?I think
none of us do ?our duties to the State as the emblem
of our social life. Is it not a fact that people see no
harm in dealing with Government property and dealing
with Government money as they w r ould not deal with the
moneys of individuals ? That the sacredness of the trust
imposed upon citizens has not yet been fully realized by
any of us is, I believe, abundantly true. It is time enough
to speak of the danger of the State to individualism when
the duty to the State is considered more paramount than
it is at present.
I must deal with another objection?the cost of the
present system. Last year when my honourable friend
the member for Akaroa (Mr. Montgomery) was Minister
of Education a very valuable return was prepared by his


direction. It showed that the system was relatively as
cheap as that of other countries. I need not repeat that
no fees are charged, and that the full cost comes from the
Consolidated Fund. Remembering this, the aid given by
other countries may be noted.

Having said this much about the duty of the State in
reference to primary education, I shall make one or two
remarks about its duty to secondary and university educa-
tion. It may be said that, granted the duty of the State
to give children a primary education, there the duty ends.
Of course this means that no children of poor parents can
have any right to an education beyond the primary. The
children of wealthy parents can always obtain a higher
education; wealth can purchase education as well as any-
thing else. Is this Parliament prepared to say that those
children whose parents have not means to them a
secondary education are to be condemned to a mere primary
education ? I feel sure that neither this Parliament nor
any that this colony will ever have will be found to sanction
such an idea. The question, then, comes to this : How is the
State to give aid to secondary instruction ? Some people
reply, you may give scholarships. Scholarships to
?what ? Are there to be any schools in the colony in which

the scholarships can he held ? I� so, under whose control
are they to he ? Is the State to say that all its brighter
boys and all its brighter girls are not to be controlled in
their education by the State, but that the State is to hand
over the education of its brightest and most intellectual
yon ths into private hands, or into the hands of corporations
or religions organizations, and to have no control over
their training though it pays for it? I do not think
the people of this colony are prepared to submit to
such a proposal. I say it is more necessary for the State
to look after secondary education than primary, just as it
is more necessary for the State to look after those works
which are not immediately necessary, than it is to provide
for works that are deemed a necessity. The State does
not need to look after any mercantile pursuit; it does not
need to provide for the obtaining of food for the inhabitants;
men have been trained to look after these for themselves.
The State has to look after the opening-up of means of
communication. The State has to look after, by corpora-
tions or otherwise, providing for the health and recreation
of the people. Why is this ? Because these things are
not so requisite as the obtaining of food. So it is with
primary and secondary schools. All recognize the need of
primary schools, and all will do what they can to provide
them; but secondary schools arc in a different position.
They require more attention. The State is required to give
more aid to them than to the primary schools; and I can
only say, from what I know of the working of the schools,
that there are, not dozens, or scores, but hundreds of
youths obtaining education in secondary schools that have
been endowed by the State that would have been deprived
of this advantage had it not been for those endowments.
And now one word as to our university. It is the
natural copestone of our educational building; and here
again, unless the State had endowed the university, there
could have been no such institution in New Zealand. It
was thought by some that the proper way was to provide
scholarships, as is done in the neighbouring Colony of Tas-


mania, for the brighter youths to proceed to England to
obtain a university education. It is, I think, a matter
for congratulation that this scheme was not adopted.
And now New Zealand is in this position: that, con-
sidering her population, she has, as I have already
said, as many students receiving university education
as any country in the world; and I believe she has
also, relatively to her population, more university-trained
men than any country in the world. What must the
necessary effect of that be? It means the raising of
the standard of education all along the line; and it also
means this : that we shall have soon, I hope, a de-
velopment of our manufactures, a development of our
trade, commensurate with the high-class education that
has been bestowed on our youth. I have already pointed
out that I believe there has been a danger in the
past in making our university education too literary. This,
however, is gradually being remedied; anti I believe that
universities should yet provide, not only for the best
scientific teaching, but for the highest form of technical
education. Our universities must also be the abodes of
research. This is a function that has not yet been recog-
nised in our university system. We have had our New
Zealand University a mere examining and degree-conferring
body, and we have had the affiliated colleges teaching
bodies. We have not yet had the means to make our
university the place of the highest scientific research; that,
however, will have to come as the colony progresses. If
we consider what our nation must be, we must look for-
ward to a time when our political autonomy will lead us
to the possession of a distinct type of national life, and you
cannot have a distinct type of national life of any value
if you have not in your colony the best teaching that can
be obtained in the world, and places which are the abodes
of the highest culture and of the deepest knowledge.
I think it is of importance to New Zealand that she
has not had merely one university college teaching her
students. lam glad that she has several, and I hope that


as she progresses she will have more. There will be need
shortly of a proper university college in Wellington,
though the Wellington College is no doubt doing good
work. Instead of there being an objection to the splitting
up of our university teaching with several colleges, I
believe it is the highest recommendation of our system.
It will prevent sameness, whilst every college will have an
individuality of its own that must create a healthy emula-
tion in the pursuit of knowledge.
And what is the task of the university ? It has to pro-
vide for us our professional men, our scientific men : it
has to provide for us our men of culture. After all,
as has been well said, the high-water mark of a nation is
not in its primary, nor in its secondary schools; the
value of a nation to the human race depends not even
on wealth nor numbers, but it is gauged by the high-
water mark of its educated mind. A nation may be
small, it may appear insignificant, but, if it can produce
men of genius and culture, it stands high amongst the
nations of the world. I feel sure that no Parliament
will decree, by the abolition of aid to the university and
to secondary schools, that New Zealand is to take an
inferior position amongst the colonies of the Empire or
the nations of the world.
Before I conclude I must refer to a matter for
which an Education Minister can do little without hearty
co-operation and aid from colonists, I refer to the en-
couraging of habits of thrift. I hope to see yet inau-
gurated what was attempted in 1878-79, namely, the
establishment of savings banks in connection with the
schools. I am aware that many Education Boards
opposed the scheme; I believe, however, that it is
necessary, for the proper development of our country,
that our children should be trained in habits of thrift,
and I believe they can best acquire habits of thrift
and be taught the value of money by the establish-
ment of savings banks. In this view I am sustained by
many who have been in the colony, and who have taken


an interest in education. If I had time I should like to read
a minute written hy Sir John Hall; when he was Premier,
urging in the strongest way the advisability of establishing
penny savings banks. I hope, however, that the members
of the House will aid the Education Department in pressing
on the Boards and School Committees in their districts the
need of co-operation to supply this want in our schools.
I do not think the Education Department in Wellington
can be blamed for its non-success. Everything that was
possible to be done in the matter by the various Ministers*
of Education who have held office has been done. The 'v
scheme was first inaugurated by my colleague the present
Native Minister when he was Minister of Education, and
succeeding Ministers of Education attempted to advance
what he had begun, but, I regret to say, with very little
success. I hope, however, that this subject will yet be
warmly taken up, and be approved of by our Education
Boards and School Committees.
And now let me just add that I recognise, as
I have stated, that our system is not perfect. I
hope, however, that the alterations in the syllabus
of our primary schools will make our education better
and more practical. Scientific education and tech-
nical education will not be treated as inferior to literary
education y and, as our university and secondary schools
follow on the same lines, we can look forward to a great
improvement in all our schools and colleges in method and
results. And perhaps a succeeding Minister of Education,
when called upon, as our system develops, to attempt
further reforms, may be able to acknowledge that what
has been recently done by the department has helped to
make his path easier and to lighten his labours.
