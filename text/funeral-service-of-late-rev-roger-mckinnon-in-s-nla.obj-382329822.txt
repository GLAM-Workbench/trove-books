Hymn No. 400.
Into Thy hand I commit my spirit ; Thou hast redeemed me, 0 Lord Ood of Truth."
Now the labourer’s ta«k is o’er ;
Now the battle-day is past;
Now upon the farther shore
Lands the voyaper at last:
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There the tears of earth are dried ;
There its hidden things are clear ;
There the work of life is tried
By a juster Judge than here :
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There the Shepherd, bringing home
Many a lamb forlorn and strayed.
Shelters each, no more to roam.
Where the wolf can ne’er invade :
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now 'Thy servant sleeping,
There the pehitents who turn
To the cross their dying eyes,
All the love of Jesus learn
At His feet in Paradise :
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There no more the powers of hell
Can prevail to mar their peace ;
Christ the Lord shall guard them well,
He who died for their release :
Father, in thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
“ Earth to earth, and dust to dust,‘‘
Calmly now the words we say ;
T.eaving him to sleep in trust
Till the resurrection day :
Father, in Thy gracions keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
Amen

DR. R. R. S. MacKINNON.
Dr. R, R. s. MacKinnon died at his resi-
dence at Mosman on Friday night, at the
age of 66.
Dr. MacKinnon earned the gratitude of
almost countless sufferers to whom, in poor
circumstances, he ministered without pecuniary
i reward. He was known as the friend of the
poor because of his unobtrusive concern for
them in their sickness. His work in this regard
during the influenza epidemic, that took such
a heavy toll of life in Sydney, is recalled.
Dr. MacKinnon was the son of the Rev.
Roger MacKinnon, who was born In Scotland.
His mother was a Frenchwoman, whose father !
was a captain in Napoleon’s army in the re-
treat from Moscow. She was French governess
to King Edward when hl.s Majesty was a boy.
From Gibraltar, where Mr. MacKinnon was
chaplain to the British forces. Dr. MacKinnon’s
parents came to Australia. Dr. MacKinnon
was born at St. Marys, New South Wales. |
Some years later, his father had charge of
St. Peter’s Presbyterian Church, North Sydney,
and Dr. MacKinnon lived at the ad,joining
manse with his parents. Dr. MacKinnon was
educated at the Sydney Grammar School,
and he graduated in medicine following his
course at the University of Sydney. He
practised his profession in Macquarle-street
for many years.
In his younger days, Dr. MacKinnon was
regarded as one of the best footballers in
Sydney. He was a member of the Australian
Jockey Club and was its honorary surgeon .
for about 25 years. At one time. Dr. Mac-
Kinnon raced horses in his own colours, and,
when in the country, his hacks and other
horses won numerous prizes at shows.
He is survived by his widow and two sons,'
Messrs. Roger and Robert MacKinnon.
The funeral, at the Northern Suburbs Ceme-
tery this morning, will be preceded by a
service commencing at 10.30 o’clock at St.
Peter’s Presbyterian Church, near the North
Sydney railway station.
