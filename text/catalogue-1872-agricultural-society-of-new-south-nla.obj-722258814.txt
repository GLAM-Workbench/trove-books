more readily and surely; it leaves no indentation. Besides paper it will print perfectly on linen,

A few of the Reasons why the “Wanzer” Lockstitch
Sewing Machines are preferable to all others.
1. They are remarkably simple in their construction ; a child can operate them and under-
stand their mechanism.
2. They are sure in their operation, finishing the work in a uniformly perfect manner.
3. They make a tight Lockstitch, alike on both sides of the work, which cannot be ravelled.
4. They Stitch, Hem, Fell, Cord, Braid, Bind, Gather, and Tuck.
5. They sew equally well the lightest and heaviest fabrics.
6. They sew over the heaviest seams without changing the tension or breaking the finest
thread.
7. They use any No. cotton, thread or silk, directly from spool.
8. They run very easily at the rate of 50,000 stitches per hour.
9. They are not liable to oil the dress of the operator.
10. They do not form ridges on the under side of the work, nor ravel out, nor are they
wasteful of thread, as is the case with the double thread chain-stitch machine.
11. They are capable of doing a greater range of work' than any other Sewing Machine.
12. They gather and sew on the band at same lime, which cannot be done by any other
Machine.
13. Hems and fell-seams are turned down by the Machine itself as the sewing is done.
14. Binding is fixed on by the Machine at the same time as sewn.
15. Cording placed in by the Machine.
16. Braid is fixed on by the Machine, and any pattern maybe worked with the greatest ease.

Thk latest novelty in Sewing Machines is the “LITTLE WANZER.” A great variety
of Hand Machines havfi been, from time to time, offered to the public ; of these, the
majority are worthless toys, totally unfitted for actual work; the remainder are principally
single thread machines, making the chain-stitch, so much objected to. For many months,
and from all classes of society, there has been an increasing demand for a Good and Cheap
Hand Lockstitch Sewing Machine, and to supply this desideratum “THE LITTLE
WANZER 1 * has been produced, and is allowed by all competent judges to be by far the
best and most perfect Hand and Treadle Sewing Machine yet brought out It is a Shuttle
Machine, making the Lockstitch, which will never rip nor ravel, and is so extremely simple
in construction, so little liable to get out of order, and so easy to learn, that personal instruc-
tion in its use is not required. No one having the printed instructions to refer to could fail to
understand how to manage it; it is capable of doing all the work usually required in the
household, and the portability of the Hand Machine renders it invaluable to Dressmakers and
Sempstresses in the habit of working at their customers’ houses. It weighs but a few pounds,
occupies but little space, may be carried to any distance without inconvenience, and when
purchased with the Stand, can, when required, be taken off and replaced at will with the
greatest ease.

Appurtenances as Hand Machine .
The “ LITTLE WANZER ” Machine, as shown above, is so fixed on the
Stand that it can be detached from it easily, and changed at once to work
either by hand or foot The Machine is merely fixed to the marble slab
(which gives it the necessary weight when being worked by hand on a table,
and obviates the necessity of clamping to stand), which slab is placed in the
recess in centre of table, the Machine requiring no further fastening whatever.
The band or belt is then placed over the driving-wheel of the Machine, and
it is ready to work by the foot. Stand No. 5 has covered drawers, and dif-
fers from No. 4 in that it is completely covered in, and has an adjustable
cover on sliding hinge, which can be removed when working, at the pleasure
of the operator, and is fitted with lock and key. When worked with the
foot by, the ordinary'treadle it is equal if not superior to the most expensive
machines now sold, and performs its work in precisely the same manner.
Mr. Spurgeon recently delivered a lecture near Liverpool, and, while severely animad-
verting upon the frivolousness and waste of female occupation, spoke in the most approving
terms of that important modern invention, the sewing-machine. He said :
' This machine is destined to exert the most healthy moral influence in the houses of the fashionable, the
well-to-do, and the mechanic. From the two former classes of homes it will help to expel the pernicious, sen-
sational novels, by giving to women a recreative and useful employment of their time, while in the humbler
home of the mechanic it will cariy a new source of pecuniary profit, and so increase domestic comfort He
was pleased to see the “ Little Wanzer” Machine at a bazaar held in connection with his chapel, and had procured
it for presentation to a Female Orphan Institution ; thus incrcnred pleasure would thereby be given to the
inmates, and habits of industry further fostered in them by its use. •

Opinions of the Press on Sewing Machines.
" The sewing-machine of the present day is not the sewing-machine of some years
hack. The Little Wanzer Sewing-machine Company were amongst the first to produce
what may be literally termed a practical sewing-machine, and have been the most suc-
cessful in attaining these results. These unequalled machines are now to be found in
every part of the world.”— Naval and Military Gazette, February 4, 1871.
. “ Any plan which places before the blind ; the means of self-support deserves approval,
while commendation is due to those who suggest or invent it. This praise is cheerfully
accorded to the Wanzer Sewing-machine Company, whose machines we lately saw in
use at the Industrial Classes for the Blind, 500 Oxford-street. The secretary said he
could not speak too highly of its adaptation to the wants of the blind, owing to the sim-
plicity of its construction, the regularity of the tension, and the saving occupied by other
machines in their various complications; the latter advantage being of special benefit to
the blind—so much so, that several of the kinds have been replaced by the Wanzer. All
those who have means should visit these glasses, and assist the Christian efforts to relieve
their physical deprivations.”— The Weekly Register.
“ Wanzer Sewing Machines. —These machines have achieved another great success;
at the Great Australian Exhibition they have been awarded the first and only prize in
competition with the “Howe,” “Singer,” “Grover and Baker,” “Raymond,” “Newton
and Wilson,” “Little Stranger,” “Wheelerand Wilson,” “Alberta,” “ Arm Tudor,” and
“Tudor,” with several bearing no distinctve names and all were carefully watched and
had their capabilities noted by the gentler portion of the visitors. The prize fell to the
lot of Messrs. Gibbs, Shallard, and Co., when exhibited ‘ the Wanzer’ and ‘ Little Wanzer.’
It is noticeable that at the recent great sewing machine trial held in America in last
September “The Wanzer” obtained three first-class awards —the best family or domestic
machine, the best embroidering machine, the best manufacturing machine, and by a para-
graph in the European Mail for June last we see that the National Education Committee
have recommended the use of sewing machise in their schools. The “Little Wanzer ”
was selected from a number of others as the one best adapted for the purpose, and the
committee have decided that every National School in Ireland shall be supplied with
them.”— Court Circular, December 10.
“We are very pleased to find that the Naional Education Committee have decided
upon introducing sewing-machines into every National school in Ireland. We under-
stand that the commttee have selected the Little Wanzer Lock stitch machine as being
the most simple and effective. This is a great compliment to the Wanzer Sewing-machine
Company.”— Mechanics’ Magazine.
“We will now only briefly remark that the Little Wanzer Sewing Machine is that
which appears in every respect to be best suited for general introduction into the domestic
home. Having already received a large share of public favor, it fully endorses our high
opinion of its varied and peculiar merits. The Little Wanzer is reliable in its work, and
really adds to the furniture of a dwelling, and is offered at a price within the reach of
everybody.”— Court Circular, February 4, 1871.
“ A Yorkshirse journal relates that a meeting of ladies, resident in the chief towns
of the West Riding, was recently held for the purpose of considering a beneficial mode
of assisting females in obtaining employment. Eventually it was decided, almost unani-
mously by the Ladies Committee, presided over by Lady Foley, that an order should
be given forthwith for a number of the ‘Little Wanzer’ sewing machines.” — English
Churchman and Clerical Journal.
“During the Fine Arts Exhibition at York, the Prince of Wales attentively watched
a blind girl, working a sewing-machine with the utmost care and dexterity, and ascertaing
that the machine was one of the Wanzer manufacture, the Prince subsequently com-
manded that two of their celebrated family sewing-machines should be sent to Marl-
borough House, and one to Sandringham Hall, in Norfolk.” — Court Circulate
January 28.

“The Manufacture of Sewing Machines. —ln a recent visit to various centres
of industry, with special reference to these important machines, and to compare them
with the trade prospectuses of respective makers, it was found that the Little Wanzer is
precisely in accordance with the published circular of its maker, and will be found by
every lady to be the most useful machine yet invented. Its neat appearance is a further
recommendation, while the price at which it is sold is a mere bagatelle, considering how
profitable it will prove wherever introduced.”; — The Bee Hive, February 4, 1871.
“As there Are several well-accredited machines of varied excellence in the market,
it is a perplexity with many to decide which of them is the best. To such doubters may
safely be recommended that most useful and really elegant new lock-stitch sewing-machine,
known as the‘Little Wanzer.’ ***** For its simplicity and manifold capabili-
ties, the rapidity and quality of it 3 work, and for its perfect finish and substantiality, the
‘Little Wanzer’ Sewing-Machine claims to be the best and cheapest in use.”— The Sun,
December 10, 1870.
“The ex-Empress of the French, the Empress of Russia, and the Queens of Bavari a
and Greece, we are told by court newsmen, beguile their hours with the ‘ Little Wanzer’
—a sewing-machine of great elegance and simplicity, and which is now generally adopted
by the English Government for industrial schools; it retains five gold medals and certi-
ficates of the highest order of merit.”— Civil Service Gazette, January 28, 1871.
EVERY. FAMILY SHOULD POSSESS A SEWINC MACHINE.
BUT WHICH IS THE BEST?

opinions of higii-class English Newspapers (which are above being influenced), and

After Old Masters and Modern Painters.—C. T. Sandon has been appointed sole agent for New South
Wales for the sale of these wonderful facsimiles of original oil paintings. The pictures which

WOLFE’S AROMATIC SCHIEDAM SCHNAPPS.
Extract from the Australian Press.
“ It is something to be assured by physicians that we have in this article a genuine extract,
which, taken in moderate quantity, affords a beneficial stimulus to the animal functions; and, even
if taken in excess, leaves but a minimum of the inevitable evils of abuse If it is necessary in the
interests of the public to denounce the too common pract ice of manufacturing noxious Compounds as
wines and spirits, it seems only just to point to this meritorious exception."—Sydney Morning
