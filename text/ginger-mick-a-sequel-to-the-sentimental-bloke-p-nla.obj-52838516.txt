F.O.R.E.W.O.R.D
“ GINGER MICK” is a sequel to the “ SENTIMENTAL BLOKE.”
The same type of film, with the same kind of appeal, and with
the same cast of characters and players. It sometimes happens
that when a sequel to a very successful film is produced, the
producer, feeling safe in the advertisement value of the former
success, makes no particular attempt to see that the sequel is at
least as good as its predecessor. This has not been the case with
“GINGER MICK”; this second Australian Screen Classic is wpll
able to stand on its own merits, and, in fact, C. J. Dennis, the
author of the verses of which both “ GINGER MICK” and' “THE
SENTIMENTAL BLOKE ” are picturisations, has publicly declared
that, in his estimation, "GINGER MICK” is better than - “THE
SENTIMENTAL BLOKE,”
The memory of “THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE” is too fresh
to make it necessary for us to offer any exhaustive description of
the class of film to which “ GINGER MICK" belongs; all we
need say is that it has the same human interest, humour and
pathos, and the same universal appeal.

” Ah ! me," sez Mick, ” I ain’t the man ter funk,

” I’m an Australian,” wus all ’e said.
Noo pride took ’old o' Mick to ear that name,

PUBLICITY SUGGESTIONS
Another newcomer is "Rose," Ginger Mick's "skirt," played by Queenia
Cross, a sister of Actor George Cross. Her peat is a somewhat pathetic
one. and much of the interest of the him is centered around her.
When the proposal to put " GINGER MICK " otj the screen was first
mooted, many experienced folk said, "Can't be done" . . « " Doean t lend
itself" .. . "How can you show so and so?" etc. Producer Raymond
Longford took the matter in hand, and, after consideration, * decided to
amalgamate Dennis* poems, " The Moods of Ginger Mick," and " Doreen,"
into one scenario, under the title of " The Story of Ginger Mick*
as told by his cobber, the Sentimental Blok<*." The result has been
as happy as the conception. "The Bloke** and "Doreen," of
"SENTIMENTAL BLOKE" fame, are shown happily married, with six
years gone by, their little farm flourishing, and young "Bill" as an extra
item in the scenery. The opening reel deals with Ginger Mick's life up to
the time of Kis going to " The Flamin' War.** His subsequent letters from
the front ore received by "The Bloke** and his wife, and the incidents
described there are depicted on the screen—a "fade away" forming the
necessary break. It is a film full of humour and pathos—a worthy successor
to the famous record-breaking "SENTIMENTAL BLOKE."
The secret of acting for the pictures is not to "act." With this
epigrammatic remark, producer Raymond Longford discloses the secret of
the enormous success of the great Australian film, " THE SENTIMENTAL
BLOKE," and he bears out his words in the production of the sequel,
"THE STORY OF GINGER MICK "—as told by his cobber, the
" Sentimental Bloke." This picture is indeed a triumph in the art of
natural production, and promises to make an even greater appeal to picture-
goers than its famous predecessor.
Apart from the natural acting of Gilbert Warren-Emery, who figures in
the name part, there are several unrehearsed * incidents in the film, one
being the * ainkum scrap" between two kiddies who were striving for front
place during the taking of a street scene. "The Bloke" and "Doreen **
figure largely in the film, end Arthur TaucKert and Lottie Lyell are as big
a hit as ever in these parts.
Those famous Australian characters, ** The Bloke,** ** Doreen,** and
" Ginger Mick," will make their second screen appearance at the
for the week commencing
Once more under the skilful handling of Raymond Longford, these three
creations of C. J. Dennis will figure in "THE STORY OF GINGER
MICK" as told by his cobber, "THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE.With
such a large circle of admirers it is inevitable that " GINGER MICK " would
come into hie own and some day feature as a star screen attraction. His
vigorous whimsical personality, his live affairs, his escapades, his penchant
for a bit of 1 " open-slather," afford great opportunities for screen repro-
duction, and he lives again in the person of Gilbert Emery, who gives a

GENERAL EXPLOITATION
Obviously, the great thing to do in exploiting “GINGER MICK*' is
to make quite sure that everybody knows that it is a sequel to *' THE
SENTIMENTAL BLOKE"—make the success of the latter film work
overtime for you in advertising the sequel. The next most important fact
to establish in the minds of your patrons is that "GINGER MICK “ has the
same novel appeal, the same human interest, humour and pathos, that they
enjoyed so much in " THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE." You must next
offer some kind of proof that "GINGER MICK " will come up to expecta-
tions—you can do this by using the author's name and also by quoting hia
opinion. Better than 'The Sentimental Bloke.'" Lastly, lay stress
on the cast—the same cast as in “THE SENTIMENTAL
BLOKE"—and do this by naming them individually and, as far as possible,
naming their characteristics.
One final word on advertisement copy—use quotations from C. J.
Dennis’ verses as often as you can—there is no surer way of establishing
connection between "THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE" and "GINGER
MICK" than this. No "teaser" or "stunt" advertising is required for
V GINGER MICK" ; let your exploitation be a matter of quantity plus
quality, forceful but dignified— create the atmosphere of a masterpiece. 1 o
do this, send well-written and well-executed circular letters to your patrons,
flood the town with daybills, throwaways, and both letterpress and litho-
graphed posters. Keep all your printing, even the throwaways, artistic
and in good taste, and use illustrations as often as possible (we shall be glad
to make you lay-outs for any class of printing). Finally, emphasise all
this with an extensive hut dignified lobby display consisting of photographs
and (get your signwriter to do this) enlargements of the illustrations in this
synopsis with the accompanying quotations—these. should he nicely done
and each one sufficiently large to attract attention and be easily read at a
moderate distance.
Paragraphs for Programme & Press
C. J. Dennis' fine collection of poems, "The Moods of Ginger Mick."
was a great favourite with the "diggers" who took part in the recent well-
known war. A copy or two, with " Love from Mary" on the fly-leaf,
could be found in most kitbags, along with the fifty odd pairs of hand-
embroidered socks, and the gross of assorted mufflers. No regimental
concert company was complete without the embryo “ Irving" who could
get “ Ginger Mick " off his chest, with appropriate movements, and . . .
"Ew Wears perjamer soots and cleans 'is teeth " , , , never failed to bring
a laugh even from those who habitually did both.
The film version of " The Story of Ginger Mick " as told by his pal,
" THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE," which is not only a sequel to the
famous film with the latter title, but Australia’s second film classic, will be
just as popular with them on the screen. It introduces " The Bloke,"
and " Doreen." and follows the career of Ginger Mick from a " rabbit 'o ”
to a hero, dealing faithfully and realistically with all the incidents contained
in the poem.
The faculty of observation must be greatly developed by the " Movies."
Herein, lies a hint for our Education Department. Arthur Tauchert,
who again plays “The Sentiments! Bloke" in the film production
of “ The Story of Ginger Mick,” a sequel to the former film,
is recognised by Hundreds of people as he walks in the street. Perfect
strangers hold him up with the question, " Excuse me, aren't you * The
Bloke *" ? On the other hand, after once playing a street scene, he was
making his way homewards without having removed his "make-up," and
with his clothes crushed and shabby in accordance with hi 4 part, when an
old-time pal—one who was not aware of his new career as a Movie Star "
—recognised him. Later on, this gentleman confided to a mutual pal :
" Met old Arthur Tauchert s'mornin' . . . Blime, 'e was looking crook.
'Adn't washed 'is face fer weeks, 'an y'or ter seen 'is clobber—fair down an'
out 'e is."
" The Bloke " and " Doreen “ are prominent figures in the screen
version of C. J. Dennis' poems, "The Moods of Ginger Mick" and
Doreen," and the film production is equal in every way to its famous
predecessor, "THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE."
Gilbert Warren-Emery has the title rfile.
Picture-taking in the public streets i naturally has its difficulty, and a
perfect understanding of the onlooker's temperament is essential to its
success.
The Australian producer, Raymond Longford, is a pastmaster at getting
what he wants from a crowd, and his cheery manner, and straight Australian
" slanguage" has more effect than a posse of police. He frequently lets
an interruption go on if he thinks it will film well. Thus in the opening
scene of " GINGER MICK," a sequel to “ THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE."
"Ginger” is seen standing outside a "pub" looking rather "dry.” A
"shikker " blows along, and insists upon hauling him inside for a pot. He
accompanies him, his face wreathed in a smile of anticipation, and the
subsequent " action," although not shown on the screen is doubtless os
natural as could be wished for. The point is that the “ shikker " gent was
not in the cast at all, hut the touch of realism he added to the proceedings
was too good to miss.
The second Australian film masterpiece, " THE STORY OF GINGER
MICK.” besides featuring the old favourites, Arthur Tauchert, Gilbert
Warren-Emery, and Lottie Lyell, of "SENTIMENTAL BLOKE" fame,
introduces some new talent to picture-goers. Chief among these is young
“ Bill,” Arthur Tauchert's youngest hopeful, aged six, who plays the part
of "The Bloke's" son, both on the screen and in real life. He inherits
his father's talent for natural acting, and during production caused much
amusement among the ** grown-ups 1 by his deadly earnestness, and his
caustic criticisms of the various situations. He seemed to feel that the
whole weight of the production was being borne on his infantile shoulders.

PARAGRAPHS FOR PROGRAMME & PRESS (continued
splendid portrayal of this fine Australian type. ’Hie story is skilfully
wound around the doings of both "The Bloke** and ‘‘Ginger Mick, ' with-
out departing in any essential from the "Ginger Mick * as given to us by
Dennis. The production is true to type and atmosphere, and will possibly
exceed in popularity its famous record making predecessor, "THE
SENTIMENTAL BLOKE."
It was almost inevitable that we should be presented with a sequel to
the famous Australian Film Classic, " THE SENTIMENTAL BL.OKE.
The sequel has now arrived under the title of "GINGER MICK.** The
story of "The Bloke's" pal is a cleverly woven combination of the scenes
and incidents in C. J. Dennis* famous poem. It has plenty of spontaneous
humour, real human life, and appealing sentiment. The sub-titles,
practically all quotations from C. J. Dennis* verse, are again a great feature.
The innumerable scenes and incidents from the slums of Sydney to the
heights* of Gallipoli will stir the emotions of every true heart by their
beauty and realism. Whether to the man of literary instincts who looks
for form and manipulation of wording with appropriate illustrations, or the
man who wishes to have a good heartv laugh, his emotions stirred and his
sense of life and character quickened, "GINGER MICK** will have an
equal charm. It i> another Film Epic from Australia that will appeal to
all ages, high and low, rich and poor alike.
"THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE” made a host of friends both in book
form, and on the screen. "The Bloke," “Doreen," and “Ginger Mick”
form a triangle, which is free from jealousy, intrigue, or any of these forms
of domestic disturbance usually associated with the three cornered
combination.
“ GINGER AIICK" as a character is as great a favourite as “THE
SENTIMENTAL BLOKE,” and in many instances is more firmly established
in the imagination of his admirers. He is considered to be more rugged,
more forceful, more primitive in his passions and his methods, and owing
largely to the big heart concealed under hts rough exterior, a more loveable
character in many ways, besides which " GINGER MICK " went to the war.
Now " GINGER MICK " has come into his own as the hero of a film
classic which bears his name and which has every indication of passing the
record established by "THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE.**
