In consideration of his loss of property and
his endeavours to maintain order and
authority.
Being the actual expenses incurred by the
claimant on account of his brother, who
was proved to have been wounded by the
military.
His store having been in the immediate
precints of the stockade, and he not having
assisted in the maintenance of social order,
it was impossible to draw any line between
his case and that of so many others whose
property was destroyed on the 3rd December.
It appearing that the wound received by the
claimant was not inflicted by the military
or police.

The reasons assigned by the Board for
declining to admit these claims are as |
follow :? ? The destruction of the
tents on the morning of the 3rd of
December, appears to have been a
necessary consequence upon the re-
sistance offered to the military; the
oi?der to destroy the position taken up
by the rioters by fire was given by the
officer in command of the military,
who considered it a necessary step.
It is clearly "shewn that a desultory
fire was kept up on the troops from 1
tents outside the stockade, such tents |
were destroyed, but your Board have
no proof of any wanton destruction of
property or any reason to believe that
such was the case.?

REPORT OF THE BOARD.
[<X)PY.]
The Board appointed by His Excellency the Governor to take into consideration the
claims of persons for compensation for losses sustained during the disturbances at Ballaarat,
have the honor to submit their report.
2. Your Board are fully impressed with the necessity for extreme caution in dealing
with this subject. They have very slight means of testing the truth of the claims set up,
and there is no evidence in support thereof other than the bare allegation of the claimants.
3. In considering the subject your Board reviewed the printed proceedings of the
House of Assembly in Canada, relating to the Rebellion losses Bill, in 1838. The sth
Resolution passed by the House declares that ? The said losses, so far only as they have arisen
from the total or partial, unjust, unnecessary or wanton destruction of the dwellings,
buildings, property and effects of the said inhabitants, and by the seizure, taking or carrying
away by soldiery of their property and effects should be paid and satisfied.? Upon this prin-
ciple your Board consider they should also be guided, but in the present instance they
cannot perceive the obligation, on the part of the Government, to compensate persons who
suffered by the violence of a section of the community of which they (the sufferers) formed a
constituent part.
In England the county or hundred wherein the disturbances are committed is made
liable by means of a rate levied thereon, as in the case of the Bristol riots, thus each
individual of a community is interested in the maintenance of good order ; but it would be a
dangerous precedent to compensate persons out of the general revenue for losses sustained
through disturbances of which they may have been the instigators, nor would it be an easy
matter to say where such claims might cease.
Protesting, therefore, against the principle, but influenced by the fact, that to the
Police Magistrate, and the misconduct of that public officer, may be attributed, in a great
measure, the riotous assemblage which led to such unfortunate results, your Board are willing
to recommend certain of the sufferers by the burning of Bentley?s Hotel to a consideration
of their claims. It appears that heavy claims have been put in by Bentley?s creditors, as
instance that of Messrs. Rutherford and Ingram �569 16s. Bd., for goods supplied several
months previously; Ross, McDermott and others for work performed on the buildings, &c.
Your Board cannot see how such claims can possibly be supported.
Convicted of a crime, the perpetration of which was the primary cause of the unfor-
tunate disturbance, it does appear inconsistent that the Government should be held responsible
for losses sustained by persons incurring the risks of trade with, and by creditors of the
convict. The Board have therefore only estimated for the loss of actual property destroyed
disconnected with the hotel.
The Board have given each claim their consideration, and have the honor to refer to
the accompanying appendix for the decision arrived at.
With respect to John Emery?s claim, amounting to �1043, the Board are aware that
the Bowling Alley, for the destruction of which compensation is sought, was more or less
attached to, and connected with, the business of Bentley?s Hotel, and under all the circum-
stances, they consider that the award of �6OO meets the justice of the case.
Rutherford and Ingram?s claim consisted entirely of a liability due by Bentley?
disallowed.
Henry Harris.?The Board have ascertained that the property for which compensation
is claimed was lying exposed in the hotel yard for a length of time totally unprotected?
disallowed.
Charles Dyte, �415 Is. ?The claimant had a small store at Ballaarat, where, it is
natural to suppose, his own property would be stored. He was in the habit of acting for
Bentley and others as an agent, and the Board have reason to believe that the goods, for the
loss of which compensation is claimed, were for the use of, and appertaining to the hotel.
C?No. 8, b.


With regard to Thomas Allen?s claim, it appears that he was, apparently, the only
individual who displayed any loyal disposition towards the maintenance of order and authority.
Acknowledging Mr. Hasleham?s claim to consideration, the Board have a difficulty
at arriving at any conclusion. It would be necessary that Mr. Hasleham should see the
chief medical officer, and explain to the Board the nature of compensation suitable to his
circumstances, for at present there is no data whereon to form an opinion.
The losses sustained by the depredations of the rioters cannot for an instant be
entertained. As well might the Government be called upon to compensate persons for the
acts of highwaymen.
The destruction of the tents on the morning of the 3rd appears to have been a
necessary consequence upon the resistance offered to the military. The order to destroy the
position taken up by the rioters by fire, was given by the officer in command of the military,
who considered it a necessary step. It is clearly shewn that a desultory fire was kept up on
the troops from tents outside the stockade; such tents were destroyed, but your Board have
no proof of any wanton destruction of property, or any reason to believe that such was the
case.
Circumstances have come to the knowledge of the Board which induce them to
believe that many of these claims were made in a vague and reckless manner, without any
definite expectation of compensation, but with an intention of trying how far the outbreak
might be turned to the individual advantage of the claimants, the reputed owners of the
tents, out of which the Government force was fired on, having boldly sent in their claims
without any other proof to support them than their own declarations, and certificates signed
by a number of persons who lent their names so indiscriminately that your Board cannot
attach any value to them.
In conclusion, your Board lament the losses sustained by individuals, but cannot
forget that if the sufferers were not actively engaged in an overt act of rebellion, they
displayed no disposition to support authority.
