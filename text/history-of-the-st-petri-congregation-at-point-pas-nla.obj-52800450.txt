History of the St. Petri Congregation
at
Point Pass
Psalm 117 “O Praise the Lord, all ye nations; praise Him, all ye
people. For His merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth
of the Lord endureth for ever. Praise ye the Lord.”
Today’s Epistle lesson, which quotes the first verse induced me
to use this psalm, which suits this day so admirably, as the heading.
Just as the fathers sang hymns of praise and thanks on the day when
this church was dedicated and their pastor was inducted, we to-day
have every reason to do likewise. The psalmist admonishes us to
come along with our offering of thanks and praise. In a propheti-
cal glance into the future, he (the psalmist) saw the coming of the
kingdom of peace. He saw how the gospel was being preached to the
Jews as well as to the gentiles and how a great multitude were
coming to Mount Zion. For him it was a glorious view and he could
not do otherwise than to thank and .praise God and to admonish all
the, nations to do the same.
We have even more reason to do so. For what was seen by the
psalmist in a vision, has since come to pass. Godi has sent His Son
into the world, Who has redeemed . us, and through Him God’s
“merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the Lord
endureth for ever.” By His grace our forefathers received this
gospel message, the message of truth and of liberty. And by bearing
in mind that God has called us by this gospel, wte must realize that
we have.by far a better reason on this day to sing hymns of praise
and thanks. It is certainly an act of divine grace that we are privi-
leged to celebrate this day. It is God, Who has kept this congrega-
tion till now; human beings are only His assistants. When comparing
the year 1885 with the year 1935, everyone will admit that we have
reason to thank and praise God. The rivalry of then has disappeared
and the conditions of to-day are entirely different.
Towards the end of the sixties of the last century, when the first
German settlers arrived here, this district was covered with virgin
scrub and was inhabited by aborigines, wild horses and wild cattle.
Very soon other German settlers followed the first ones in order to
t; ke up land. The pastors of th-; districts which these settlers had
left, came to this district to conduct divine services. The first
pastors to come to this district, were the Pastors Rechner from Lights
Pass, Appelt from Neukirch and Reusch from Tanunda. The first
services were conducted in private houses. In the year 1871 the
settlers erected a building which was to serve as a school during the
week and as a church on Sundry. As the number of settlers was


gradually growing, they seriously considered the building of a church
When the school proved too small, so that many were obliged to re-
main outside during the services, it was decided in the year 1875 to
build a church. Largely through the efforts of Pastor Rechner this
resolution was carried out. In the same year (1875), during the
month of August, the building of the new church was commenced
and on October 29th the foundation stone was laid by Pastor Rechner
assisted' by Pastor Heinze from Nain. The church was dedicated
on Palm Sunday, A(pril 9th, 1876. All the six pastors of the Im-
manuel Synod took (part in the service. Pastor Auricht from Lang-
meil opened the service by conducting a farewell service in the school,
where the previous services had been held, and preached a farewell
sermon. From there the procession moved to the new church which
had received the name of “Immanuel” and halted in front of the
closed door. Here Pastor Stolz delivered an address, thereupon
Pastor Rechner turned the key and qpened the door in the name of
the Triune God. The senior pastor, Pastor Niquet, attended to the
dedication and offered the dedicatory prayer. The dedicatory ad-
dress was preached by Pastor Reusch. The other speaker at this
service was Pastor Heinze. The afternoon service was conducted by
Pastor Rechner, who inducted Pastor Stolz (who had been called by
the congregations-Point Pass, Rol.ertstown and Neales) to his charge
Thereupon Pastor Stolz preached his inaugural address, basing it on
1 Cor. 4, 1-5.
In the year 1884 a split occurred in the synod. At the synod held
at Gruenberg on August 3rd, 1884, the Immanuel Synod, which had
been formed in the year 1874, was rent asunder. The Pastors
Reusch and Niquet \vith their followers founded the Immanuel Synod
a.a.G. The split in the synod produced a split in the congregation,
which, for the future, meant two separate congregations at Point
Pass. The one congregation was served by Pastor Stolz and the
other applied to Pastor Reusch for services. Pastor Reusch consent-
ed to serve the newly formed congregation and was for the time
being its pastor.
An important question for both congregations was: which congrega-
tion owns the church? In June 1885 this problem was solved to the
satisfaction of both congregations. The congregation served by
Pastor Stolz retained the church, but paid the other congregation
the sum of £370.
The congregation of Pastor Reusch held its services first of all in
the house of Brother Johann Carl Friedrich Leditschke and then in
the school, which at that time was a congregational school. After
the question as to who owns the church had been decided, the congre-
gation took steps to build a church of their own. The block of land
for the church as well as cemetery was presented by Brother
Leditschke. Tenders for the building of a church wej-e called, and,
according to an advertisement in the ‘Australische Zejtung’, had to


be in by August Bth ult. Mr Both from Eudunda was the successful
tenderer. In the month of August the building of the church was
commenced. On Wednesday afternoon, September 2nd, 1885, the
foundation stone of the new church was laid by Pastor Niquet, assis-
ted by the local pastor, Pastor Drauz.
The first pastor of this congregation was, as mentioned above,
Pastor Johannes Reusch from Tanunda. His successor here in Point
Pass was Pastor Ferdinand Drauz. He had received his theological
training at the Mission College in Basle, Switzerland. In the year
1885 he sailed for Australia on the ship ‘John Elder’ and landed at
Port Adelaide in the month of April. Among his fellow passengers
was his colleague Pastor Gottlob Simpfendorfer, , later (pastor at
Walla Walla, New South Wales, for many years, and Miss Elizabeth
Schenk, the fiancee of Pastor Schenk at Sydney. At first Pastor
Drauz was an assistant of Pastor Reusch at Tanunda, who at the
time was in poor health. On June 24th, 1885, his colloquium was
held at Tanunda, which, according to reports, satisfied everyone pre-
sent. He was ordained in the St. Petri Church at Nuriootpa (then
Angas Park) on the forenoon of July 2nd, 1885, at the service held
in connection with the General Conference, which took place in the
afternoon at the same place. At this conference Pastor Drauz was
appointed to be the pastor of the congregations at Point Pass and
Robertstown. He commenced his work in this parish in the month
of August.
On the second Sunday in Advent, the 6th of December, 1885, the
new church, which had received the name of ‘St. Petri’ was dedicated
At 9 o’clock the congregation assembled in the school, where the pre-
vious services had been conducted, for a short farewell service. The
procession then moved to the church. Pastor Niquet turned the key
and opened the church in the name of the Triune God and also dedi-
cated the church. Miss Lydia Leditschke (accompanied by the Misses
Lydia Walter, Martha Schaefer, Bertha Fettke, Bertha Friebel and
Elizabeth Lehmann) had the honour of carrying the key. On the
same day Pt stor Drauz was inducted to his charge by Pastor Niquet
In order to enhance the service the newly formed choir, conducted
by Pastor Drauz, sang the hymn “Duguter Hirt auf Zion’s Auen.”
The contractor, as mentioned above, was Mr Both from Eudunda,
who attended to the masonry. The woodwork was done by a
brother of the congregation, Brother Maywald; the pews were made
by another brother of the congregation, Brother Wuttke.
The following brethren are the founders of the congregation;
Johann Carl Friedrich Leditschke, Johann Traugott Mickel, Johann
Georg Damschke, Georg Jansen, Wilhelm Nerlich, Johann Carl
Pfeiler, Gottfried Jochinke, Hermann August Kuhl, Johann Carl
Walter, Heinrich Jochinke, August Jochinke, Christian Jochinke,
Heinrich August Friebel, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Leditschke, Johann
Christian Schaefer, Paul Hermann Wuttke, Johann Wilhelm Gerlach,


Wilhelm Fettke, Wilhelm Pickert, Johann August Carl Pfitzner, Hein-
rich Robert Pfitzner, Ferdinand Gerlach, Gottlieb Gerlach, Wilhelm
Gottlieb Scholz, Johann Wilhelm Schulz, Andreas Mickan, Carl Frie-
drich MaywaLd, Johann Franz Carl Traeger, Adolf Schroeder, Frie-
drich Wilhelm Gehling, Theodor Gehling, Johann Lipschinski, Carl
Morick and Hermann Walter.
The following congregations belonged to the parish of Pastor
Drauz: Point Pass, Robertstown, Steinthal and Friedrichswalde. In
time to come more congregations were added, namely Sutherlands,
Eudunda, Morgan and Geranium Plain.
Pastor Drauz had the pleasure of seeing four churches of his
parish dedicated during his term of office, they -Were those at Point
Pass (mentioned above), Robertstown (1885), Sutherlands (1890),
and Eudunda (1893). The scattered field of Pastor Dranz exacted
much work and energy. Pastor Drauz, however, was a willing work-
er, who did not shun any work, nor the long trips per horse or bug-
gy to Steinthal, near Kapunda, and then later to Morgan. Every
Wednesday evening he conducted here at Point Pass, for the benefit
of the youth, Bible evenings to increase their knowledge of Holy
Scripture.
For the first five years Pastor Drauz, was able to attend to his
duties in the best of health. In the year 1890 he had caught a severe
cold, with the result that the severe cough burst a vessel in his throat,
which necessitated a rest from February till after Easter.
Towards the end of the year 1891, Pastor Drauz received assis-
tance. Pastor Hegelau, who had recently arrived from Germany, de-
voted two thirds of his time to the parish of Pastor Reusch and the
rest to the parish of Pastor Drauz. In the year 1892 Pastor Hegelau
accepted a call from the Adelaide congregation—rendered vaci nt by
the death of Pastor Maschwedt—but his spare time he still devoted
to the Parish of Point Pass.
Although Pastor Drauz was receiving assistance, it seems as if his
throat never really recovered. In the year 1895 his throat trouble
got so bad inducing his parish to grant him a furlough of six
months. This rest strengthened his voice, but never cured his trou-
ble. Very soon the old trouble returned, his condition was gradually
getting worse, so that he felt induced to hand in his. resignation in
the year 1896. He continued to live in the manse at Point Pass till
April 1897, when he rented a house at Eudunda. In Eudunda he
lived another five months. Towards the end of his life he had to
undergo a great deal of suffering from which he was released by his
death at the age of 36 years and five days on September 17th 1897.
On the 19th of September he was laid to rest in the Eudunda ceme-
tery by his successor, Pastor Siegle. A simple tombstone indicates
the last resting place of this faithful servant. His widow and daugh-
ters returned to Germany in the year 1899 (his son had returned a

year before the father’s .death in order to attend school.) His widow
died in the year 1910 and his only son in the year 1917.
As mentioned above, Pastor Drauz resigned when he realized that
there was no hope of an early recovery. Thereupon the parish in
the year 1896 sent a call to Pastor Christian Siegle, who at the
time was living at Caltowie and was from there serving the northern
congregations. Pastor Siegle accepted the call and early in 1897 he
transferred to his new sphere of labour. At first he lived in a ren-
ted house in Eudunda, hut when Pastor Drauz left Point Pass to live
at Eudunda, he came to Point Pass to live in the manse.
The scattered parish in time brought the conviction that a division
of the field was necessary. At the parish meeting, held in Point
Pass on the 14th January, 1900, the resolution to divide the field was
adopted. In future the Parish of Point Pass was to consist of the
following congregations: Point Pass, Robertstown, Geranium Plain,
Lindley, Morgan and Hoyleton; and the Parish of Eudunda of the
following congregations: Eudunda, Sutherlands, Friedrichswalde,
and Steinthal. Pastor Siegle remained in Point Prss and continued
to serve the Point Pass Parish. The Parish of Eudunda called Pas-
tor K. Gutekunst, who was installed at Eudunda on the Ist Sunday
in Advent, December 2nd, 1900, by the president, Pastor Braun.
From the year 1905 on, but only for a short time, Pastor Siegle
served the congregation at Wasleys, until it was taken over by Pastor
Bemmann. Later Pastor Siegle began to visit the West Coast in order
to attend to the spiritual wants of the Lutheran settlers, (some of
them had previously belonged to congregations served by Pastor
Siegle). In the year 1909 Pastor Siegle and family took a trip, to
Germany and returned at the end of the year.
On the 11th of December 1910, on the 3rd Sunday in Advent, this
congregation celebrated the 25th jubilee of its church. The preach-
ers for the occasion were the Pastors Basedow, Braun, Gutekunst,
Meier and the local pastor, Pastor Siegle. At that service a collec-
tion was received in aid of the widow of Pastor Drauz. She herself,
however, never received the money, because she had died in Germany
and was buried on the very day the collection was taken up for her
benefit.
In the year 1911 a change of pastors took place. At a (parish
meeting on the 10th of September, held at Point Pass, Pastor Siegle
informed the brethren that the congregations on the West Coast had
sent him a call and that he was prepared to accept it, be therefore
requested the brethren to give him a clearance. With regret his
resignation was accepted. He preached his fi rewell sermon on
January 21st, 19(12, and then took his departure for his new field on
the West Coast.
At the conference on September 10th, 1911, it was decided to in-
vite Pastor Michel, who had come to Australia in the year 1910 and
was then serving as a home missionary, to serve the parish for the

following; year. He consented to come and immediately after the
departure of Pastor Siegle, he took up duties here in Point Pass.
At the'’next parish meeting on the 15th of September, 1912, Pastor
Michel for health reasons, declined a further appointment, but prom-
ised to serve the parish up to the end of that year. Liter he con-
sented to remain here until his successor had arrived. He left Aus-
tralia on the 22n<i|5f April, 1913, to return to Germany. At present
he is engaged inj--pastoral work among the German immigrants in
Brazil, South America!
The successor of Pastor Michel was Missionary Johannes Zwar. At
the said meeting on the 15th of September 1912, the perish decided to
send a call to Missionary Zwar. He, by birth an Australian (born
at Tanunda), received his theological training in the seminary at
Bisle in Switzerland during the years from 1903 to 1908. When he
had completed his studies he accepted a call as missionary to the
Gold Coast in West Africa. The task allotted to him there was that
of principal of the secondary school at Christiansborg near Accra.
After a sojourn of four and a half years in Africa, ill-health compel-
led him to return to Germany. During this sojourn in Germany,
whilst residing in the city of Stuttgart, the call from the Parish of
Point Pass reached him. He handed the call to the foreign mission
committee at Basle and asked for advice: he was prepared to ebide
by their decision. Since, according td medical advice, he was unable
to return to the tropics, he was advised by the committee to accept
the call. Regarding it as the will of God he was prepared to return
to Australia and to enter the Australian Lutheran Church. In the
beginning;.of the year 1913, he with his family, returned to his native
land, and on l April 28th, landed at Port Adelaide. On Sat-
urday, the- 24th of May, his colloquium took (place and on the follow-
ing day, the 25th of May, being the first Sunday after Trinity, he
was installed at Point Pass by the president, Pastor Braun, assisted by
the Pastors Bemmann and K. Gutekunst. Pr stor Zwar then preached
his inaugural address, basing it on 2 Kor. 5, 16-21. In the afternoon
the Pastors Bemman and Gutekunst spoke on foreign mission work.
At the annual meeting of the congregation, held on February 15th
1914, it was decided to elect' ap executive committee.
The rules governing the cbmrnittee were adopted at the meet-
ing held on the 30th of August 1914. The seven brethren elected
to this committee were the Brethren G. Scholz, F. Gaerth, S. Miekan,
G. Gehling, C. G. Jansen, P. Hilbig and 0. Pfitzner. The life of this
committee was to be of short duration, for in the year 1915 it was
dissolved in accordance with a resolution adopted at a congregational
meeting.
In the year 1919 the congregation decided to give the church a
thorough renovation. A committee to deal with that matter was
elected, consisting of the following; Pastor Zwar and the Brethren
John Leditschke, Julius Leditschke, Andreas Mickan, August Mickel,

Heinrich Jochinke and C. F. Leditschke. The work was attended to
by the Brethren Schroeder and Goedecke. The renovated church was
re-dedicated on September 14th, 1919, the speakers for the occasion
were the Pastors Braun (president), and Bemmann, and the Pastors
Basedow and Sprengel spoke at the mission festival in the afternoon.
In the year 1921, at the Synod held on March Bth at Ehenezer, the
split, which occurred in the year 1884, was healed by the amalgama-
tion of the Immanuel Synod and the Immanuel Synod a.a.G. This
amalgamation was to prove a blessing for our congregation. For
a number of years the two congregations have now held combined
preaching services either in this or the neighboring church. Since the
end of the year 1920 there has been a comlbined Sunday School here
in Point Pass. Since the end of May of the present year (1935) a
Young People’s Society has been meeting regularly, which is attend-
ed by the young people of both congregations. For .this festival a
combined choir, consisting of members from both Robertstown and
Point Pass congregations, has been formed. During the time of
vacancies in either congregation, the pastors of both congregations
have assisted.
In the year 1926 English services were commenced. The present
rule is that one English service is conducted in the month either in
the afternoon or in the evening. On the 4th of November 1934, the
first English confirmation service was held, when seven candidates
renewed their baptismal vow.
In the year 1932 Pastor Zwar’s ministry came to an end by his
death. The illness which caused his death, dated back to the year
1928. In the year 1930 the parish requested him to take a two
months holiday and aided him with a monetary gift. His condition
however, was gradually getting worse, so that he, in accordance with
medical advice, underwent a serious operation on December 10th
1932. Although the operation was successful he did not recover and
after lingering for a few days he passed away on the 17th of Decem-
ber in the Rua Rua Hospital in North Adelaide. He held his last
service here in Point Piss on the second Sunday in Advent (to-iday
three years ago), preaching on the 10 talents and closing his address
with the words: “Handelt, bis dasz ich wiederkomme.” After almost
twenty years of service in this parish, this faithful servant of the Lord
was called home. His illness certainly was serious and the operation
still more serious, but not one of his people, friends or members of his
congregation expected his end, but it seems, he himself had a notion
of his approaching death, for a slip of paper contained the following
words, written in December 1932, therefore shortly before his death:
“If my work should terminate and God calls me away.” On December
18th, in the presence of a great number of people he was laid to rest
in the St. Petri cemetery here in Point Pass. In the church Pastor
Skgle preached the funeral sermon, basing it on 1 Kor. 15, 57. This
year (1935) the parish erected a monument to his memory to the

value of £3l 2/6, this congregation contributing the sum of £l6 10/-
to this amount.
ior the next twelve months the widow of Pastor Zwar lived in the
manse at Point Pass and received the sum of £2OO from the parish.
In December 1933 she left Point Pass and settled down at Glenelg,
where she is at present keeping id guest house at the seaside. At thd
farewell service the parish handed'her a gift as a sign of their love
and esteem. \
During the vacancy the Pastors Renner and Proeve attended to the
spiritual wants of the parish. At the parish meeting at Point Pass
on the 20th of September, 1933, presided ovpr by the District Presi-
dent, Pastor Heidenreich, it was decided to / send a call to Pastor
Materne, then stationed at Temora, N.S.W. He accepted the call and
was installed as pastor of the Parish of Point Pass at Point Pass oil
the 15th of April 1934, by the president, Pastor Heidenreich, assis-
ted by the Pastors Renner and Proeve. *■:
In order to make the necessary preparations for the,soth jubilee 1 ,
a committee of seven was elected, consisting of the Brethren C.
Jansen, H. Wittwer, E. Schulz, O. Pfitzner, H. Feuerherdt, C. Gerlach,
J. Leditschke and Pastor Materne. „
Congregational School.
Soon after the first German s'ettlers arrived in this district, they
realized that a school was necessary and, with the help of God, they
proceeded to establish one. To conduct a school in a private house
would not have been in the best interest of the school and since tb»
rooms used for church purposes were unable to hold the people It was
decided to erect a building, which was to serve as a school during the
week and on Sunday as a church. It was also decided to add a few
rooms, in which the teacher was to live, and a room for the visiting
pastor.
In the year 1870 Mr Albert Klaebe presented a block of ground
for church purposes. A simple building with straw roof was erected
on the site at present occupied by the Sunday School of the Imman-
uel congregation. On Ascension Day, the 18th of May 1871, this
building was dedicated as church and school by Pastor G. J. Rechner
The first teacher to be appointed was Mr Johann Ludwig Hausler, he
remained up to the year 1881 (at the conference held on March 3r,d,
1881, his resignation was accepted). He was succeeded by Mr Her-
mann Spangenberg, but before he commenced his duties several
months had passed away, and during that time Pastor Stolz attended
to the school.
In the year 1882 the building of a new school was discussed. Since
the old school was due for a fair amount of repair, it was generally
agreed that a new building would be the most satisfactory solution
of the problem. The next question to engage the minds of the (peo-
ple was, where the new school should be situated? There were two
opinions, both of them received a fair amount of support. Pastor

Stolz and several brethren held the opinion that the school should be
built near the church. The majority of the brethren, however, want-
ed the school in Point Pass. At the conference on the 27th of June
1882, it was, after a lengthy discussion, decided to build the school
in Point Pass. Tenders for the building of the school were immedi-

ately called. Three tenders were received and the tender of Broth-
er Theodor Gehling for £262 6/7 was accepted. The block of ground
for school purposes was purchased from Brother Leditschke for the
sum of £5. The following brethren were elected as trustees: the
Brethren G. Schild, J. C. Leditschke, G. Jochinke, Gottlieb Schutz and
August Jochinke.

On that day the children for the last time assembled at the old school
and then marched to the new school. There one of the girls handed
the key to Pastor Stolz, who, thereupon unlocked the door and open-
ed the school in the name of the Triune God and then performed the
dedicatory ceremony.
At the beginning of the year 1884 Mr Spangenberg handed in his
resignation, but stayed till his successor was ready to start. The
next teacher was Mr Heinrich Doehring, who commenced duties at
the beginning of May 1884. According to reports he did not remain
for any length of time, probably to the year 1887 or 1888. He was
succeeded, but only for a very short time, by Mr Dittmer. The next
teacher was Mr Friedrichs, a very able man, who later entered the
Education Department. Towards the end of the year 1891, Mr Frie-
drichs resigned and was succeeded in the year 1892, by Mr Raasche
The latter however, did not last long, after eight weeks he was dis-
missed in April 1892. The school was then taken over by the State.
The first state school teacher was Mr Albanus. In the year 1893,
the school was sold to the state for £3OO. In the year 1892, Pastor
Leidig was successful in establishing a congregational school in the
sister congregation. The old school was repaired and again used
and served its purpose till the year 1909, when a new school was built
The first teacher was Mr Krichauff. In the year 1917, this school,
as well as all other congregational schools in South Australia, was
closed by the government.
Sunday School.
The Sunday School was inaugurated by Mrs Siegle. Others who
also taught in the Sunday School were the Brethren H. Wuttke, P.
Hilbig, Miss Gertrude Leditschke, the Brethren Gus Gehling, Carl
Jansen, Ernst and Hermann Leditschke, the Misses Esther and Char-
lotte Hilbig and Dora Leditschke. In December 1920 the Sunday
School united with the Sunday School of the Immanuel congregation.
The first teacher was Mr Albert Doecke (teacher at the college) and
since 1922 Mr Hermann Vogelsang.
Choir.
The first choir to sing in the church, was the one on the day of
the opening of the church, December 6th 1885. Pastor Drauz was
the conductor of that choir. It is reported that that choir sang on
different occasions. In the time of Pastor Siegle a new one was
formed, Pastor Siegle being the conductor. Mr G. A. Keller (teacher
of Immanuel College) also conducted one for a while. He was suc-
ceeded by the present conductor Brother Julius Goedecke. For
today’s as well as for the jubilee service at Robertstown, a com-
bined choir was formed consisting of members of both local as well
as both Robertstown churches.
Manse.
The manse was built in the year 1887. For a time Pastor and
Mrs Drsuz lived in the house of Brother Morick, now occupied by


Brother Goedecke. At the time of Pastor Siegle in the year 1910,
two rooms and the kitchen were added. In the year 1924 the manse,
which had till then been the property of the St. Petri congregation
became the property of the parish. A house committee of seven mem-
bers was elected, the Point Pass representatives are the Brethren
Julius Leditschke, Oskar Pfitzner and Heinrich Wittwer.
Young People’s Society.
In accordance with the wish of young people of both congregations
a Young People’s Society was inaugurated. The first meeting pre-
sided over by Pastor Proeve, was held on Sunday afternoon, May 26th
1935, in the Immanuel Church. The following officers were elec-
ted: President, Mr L. Wittwer, vice-president, Mr W. Schutz, secre-
tary, Miss M. Vogelsang, treasurer, Miss S. Schmidt, organist, Miss
M. Vogelsang. These are the present office holders, with
the exception of Miss M. Vogelsang, who resigned; her position as
secretary was taken by Miss L. Schild and Miss S. Schmidt was elec-
ted organist.
Organs.
In the services, previous to the opening of the church, Brother
Mickel, the organist, used his own organ. The first organ purchased

This is a short sketch of the history of the St. Petri congregation
This history tells us of many things. We are reminded of the var-
ious pastors and shepherds of the congregation, who had been placed
or sent here by the good Shepherd (two of them died whilst serving
this congregation). In reminding us of the pastors we are also re-
minded of the sermons preached in this church, of the sacraments
which have been administered and of the blessings which have been
received during this period. As a congregation we have every rea-
son to thank and praise God for His many acts of grace experienced
during the period. But on this day of rejoicing we must not over-
look another fact, that is that God’s kindness has often been repaid
by sins and unfaithfulness. In of the many sins, the good
Shepherd has protected this congregation and has saved it from de-
struction. This should also urge us on to thank and praise God on
this day of jubilee. Although it is only natural that we think of the
past, pioneers and founders of this church, we are on this day also
urged to look at the future. Brothers rnd Sisters of the St. Petri
congregation will our congregation have a future? If you desire
a future for your congregation, then you must prepare for the future.
Your congregation has adopted the name of ‘St. Petri’, which is, a
congregation with a profession. May the profession of the St. Petri
congregation always be and always remain the profession of St. Peter
“Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God.” May the good
Shepherd lead this congregation to remain faithful to that profession.
O grant that in Thy holy word
We here may live and die, dear Lord;
And when our journey endeth here,
Receive us into glory there.
Amen.
