“CAN YOU READ TEA-CUPS?”
How often have you wished you could when
you saw how eagerly your reply was awaited?
Far nearly all women like to peer into the
future and try to wrest from it its secrets; and
she who can satisfy this desire is the indispens-
able guest.
Why not learn? A little study and practice
zvill soon enable you to foretell the main inci-
dents shown by the tea leaves, and you can
add to your knowledge gradually.
The best kind of tea to ii'C if tea-cup reading is
to be followed is undoubtedh Arngoorie Special,
as it is selected from only the tiny bud leaver oj
the tips of tea plants, picked just when nature
has coaxed the young leaves to perfection.
The first thing to do is to drain off any
liquid that remains in the cup, turning the cup
slowly round so as to ensure that the leaves
may be scattered well over the cup. Then stand
the cup upside down in the saucer, so that the
leaves may settle into their final groupings, and
after a few moments it will be ready to read.
Concentrate upon the person whose cup you
are reading while you look for signs or pictures
among the leaves. Do not expect to see exact
likenesses in the leaf pictures. This is decided-
ly an occasion for letting your imagination run
riot, for you must weave a story out of the
pictures that arc suggested to you by the leaves.
Thus, a ring in the cup naturally suggests
either an offer of marriage, tin engagement, or
a wedding. To discover which it foretells in a
particular case, you must note its formation
and its position in the cup.
