PORT NOARLUNGA has in recent years sprung into highly popular favour as one of
the most delectable holiday resorts in the State. Situated twenty miles from Adelaide
gSL —a delightful run by train or motor through the gorgeous scenery of the hills —the
town nestles behind gigantic cliffs which shelter it from ocean storms, and it lies, as it
were, in a perpetual sunbath tempered by the gentle ozonic breezes. From the cliffs one has
a magnificent view of seascape probably unsurpassed in the world, while to landward the
beauties of hills, plain and river afford such scenic delights which never fail to satisfy even
the most fastidious. On the easil) T accessible beach one can walk on a clean hard surface for
miles and enjoy the rugged beauty of the cliffs and the thunderous music of the surf as it
rushes on the shore. There are delightfully roomy “caves” for picnics and the bathing
facilities are unsurpassed. A favourite spot is that where the River Onkaparinga enters the
sea near the town, after winding in picturesque fashion across the plains from the distant
hills.
Port Noarlunga is a favourite centre for anglers, who obtain satisfactory catches from
the local jetty (which is one of the finest in Australia and was only recently declared open by


His Excellency the Governor, Sir Archibald Weigall, K.C.M.G.) and the river. Pleasure
boats on the river can be hired at a nominal fee. As for accommodation, there are numerous
fine boarding houses, some of which are mentioned in this publication.
Interesting historic features are attached to Port Noarlunga. For instance, 50 years
ago it was a wheat transport centre. The grain was carried by teams to the old mill near
the river (now the camping place of the Y.M.C.A.), whence it was taken by boat on the
Onkaparinga to a spot close to the present bridge. Next it was carried on rails and stored
in what is now known as “Ye Okie Barne ” Tea Rooms, and was finally taken to the
original jetty (now destroyed) by means of a tunnel through the sandhills.
Undoubtedly, by sheer force of merit, Port Noarlunga is destined to become one of
the foremost watering places in South Australia.
