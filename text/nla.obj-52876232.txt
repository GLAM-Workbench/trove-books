INTRODUCTION
“The Twelve’’ at once bears witness to a revolution
in literature, and to the literature of the revolution.
The rough simplicities of the folk-song accent an
aesthetic sophistication. Out of its bitter realism flow-
ers, like the Lily of Malud, a frail and radiant mystic-
ism. The issue of upheaval and disaster, it is the
creation of a man bewildered in a broken world, seeing
it with all the emotional intensity of the artist, and
drawing out of it, rather than imposing upon it, the
order of his mystical apprehension. One finds there-
in, if with difficulty, traces of Blok’s earlier styles.
But it is like finding in a face wrought upon by time
and grief the expressions habitual to its young con-
tours.
Alexander Blok was born into the intelligentsia of
Russia. He was the son and grandson of professors,
his father being a professor of law and a musician
of good amateur standing, his grandfather the rector
of St. Petersburg University. In so warm a cultural
atmosphere, the boy’s talents blossomed early, and he
began writing verses at the age of five. He was eighteen
when he did his first serious work. Meanwhile he was
receiving his education in St. Petersburg, and erecting
an ivory tower of refuge from the economic stress and
political storms which marked this period of Russian
history. He began publishing in the periodicals in
1903, and his first book appeared the very year of the
abortive revolution.


This early stage was deeply influenced by the mystic
tradition. His “Poems on the Lady Beautiful,” pub-
lished in the midst of an upheaval that was shaking
Russia from Finland to the Caucasus, were his dedica-
tion to the service of das Ewig WcibUche, which the
poet believed would effect the world's spiritual renas-
cence. He is himself remote from the world, writing
intense and ethereal lyrics, which interpret reality as
the symbolic language of the ideal. These show a
characteristic mingling of spirituality and eroticism,
and their main theme recurs repeatedly in his later
work.
In the volume which followed this Blok is torn be-
tween his vision of mystical beauty and the acrid
fragrance of the flowers of evil. It may have been
the effect of the revolution, but the second book is rich
in unexpected realism. The poet moves about the
streets, sits gloomily in the brilliant cafes, forsakes the
candid walls of the monastery for the muddy ways of
the towns. In 1907, in the preface to his lyrical
dramas, he celebrated an ideal of poetic sensitiveness
which should sing to every wind that blows. The con-
tradictions of a “scattered” experience, the passive
curiosity of the observer, these were for Blok the ideal
attributes of the lyricist. They were as well the at-
tributes of the decadents. In “The Earth Under
Snow,” published in 1908, the svmbolism of his youth
yields to the darkness and confusion of “bitter earth.”
He is still the mystic. He still follows the Grail. But
he draws himself crucified on the cross of passion:
“an unrcsurrectcd Christ.”
Christ is the kindling figure for Blok’s poetic im-
agination. The Russian Christ who hangs at every


cross-road of the hopeless fields. When he declares,
of his Lady Beautiful, the tragedy of “loving Her in
heaven and betraying Her on earth,’’ he is declaring the
eternal tragedy of the Christian struggle against those
carnal invitations which are an invasion of the spiritual
stronghold. So also his patriotism is tinged with his
religious emotion. The enigma of Russia’s destiny
had tormented the consciousness of her people for
more than a century. It presented itself with terrible
vividness to Blok, who saw the sufferings of his coun-
try even as the passion of Christ.
The revolution split literary Russia into two camps.
The Betwixt-and-Betweens were swept out of court.
Those who sought to preserve the old values and the
familiar forms saw the revolution as a whirlwind of
destruction, a devil’s vaudeville. The insurrection of
the masses was to them the rising of the Apocalyptic
Beast. Their utterances were funeral dirges and
curses. To this group belonged the majority of Rus-
sian writers. On the other side were a band of folk
poets and a handful of men who owed a cultural al-
legiance to the old order. Among these was Alexander
Blok. Whether Bolshevik or not, it remains true that
he was one of the few of his own class who did not de-
spair of the masses with the outbreak of the prole-
tarian revolution. Rather, he fought beside them.
Several of the critics who bestowed highest praise
upon “The Twelve” as a work of art took occasion to
heap abuse upon its author as a renegade and a Red.
There is a curious contradiction in a man who writes
poetic dramas, some of which were staged in Petro-
grad and Moscow, who is enamoured of Harlequin
and moonlight nocturnes, of novitiates and chaste


monastic walls, and who can at the same time celebrate
bloody revolution with so strong a shout that even his
enemies must answer.
The poem is of a sort that gains in power with each
re-reading and that is so difficult that it may be thrown
away half-read. The translators have, therefore,
added marginal notes, after the fashion of Coleridge
in his “Ancient Mariner,” which may clarify some of
the darker passages. It opens with an almost poster-
esque picture of red Petrograd. Through the wintry
streets moves a strange pageant: here are the blind,
the halt, and the lame ; here, too, are the dispossessed
aristoi, and here finally are the twelve: twelve Red
Guards, rough careless fellows, armed with the bold-
ness of those who know that they have nothing to
lose. The main theme is only briefly glimpsed, moving
in the obscurity of broken shadows and the intermit-
tent flash of revolutionary fires. It is interrupted by
lyric passages, by snatches of street-songs, by echoes
of rifle shots, and concludes with the revelation of
the twelve led by the red flag in the hands of Christ.
“The Twelve” met with an astonishing response.
Written in 1918, it has become known wherever Rus-
sian is spoken; the Russian edition alone ran into two
million copies, and it has been translated into five lan-
guages. It is the epic of the revolution, and perhaps
for that very reason is like a lawless comet among
the ordered planets of Russian literature.

THE TWELVE.
Black evening.
Stark white snow.
The winds, the winds
They leap to overthrow—
The winds, the winds!
Through God’s dark world they blow !
The wind is spinning
The white snow.
The crust of- ice glimmers below.
Stumbling and tumbling,
Folk slip and fall.
God pity all!
Across the house-fronts
On a sagging line
A canvas placard flaunts the sign:
“All power to the Constituent As-
sembly !”
A bent old woman,
Tearful, trembly,
Stares at the canvas in despair.
Her blear eyes see
How many foot-wraps it would be:
All the linen wasted there,
While the children’s feet go bare.
She ambles like a heavy hen
Across the snow-blocked thorough-
“This is the death of me. In my need.
Holy Mother, intercede 1”
A bitter evening in
Red Petrograd. The
•winds of chaos are
unloosed.
Across the treacher-
ous icy streets moves
a curious pageant.
A poor old woman
laments the wasted
canvas in a political
placard, and prays
for mercy.


The comfortless bour-
geois shivers on the
street corner.
The intelligent la-
ments the passing of
old Russia.
And the fat years
of the Church are
departed.
The noble ladies, the
daughters of music,
are brought low.
In fierce play the
wind batters at the
placard, and hails
his blows on the
passers-by.
Winds lash kniving at the cross-roads
And the frost stings to the bone.
With his nose behind his collar,
A boorzbooy stands off alone.
Who is the man with flowing hair,
Muttering a mournful air;
"Renegades!
Russia is dead”?
One of these pen-pushing blades —
Clever head!
Here a frock moves, black and bulky,
Sidling to the east.
Why so sulky,
Comrade priest?
You used to strut, do you recall?
Your broadcloth belly with its state-
ly toss
Shining upon the people with its
cross.
Two ladies pass in heavy furs,
Shuddering sadly: “Ah I cried. . .”
With shaken sighs her veiling stirs.
A slide!
And she is down.
Oh, oh, oh,
Lift her up, so!
Singing with spite,
The wind wrings the wraps tight,
The reaper of men!
Fierce-fisted he kneads
The white canvas which reads;
“All power to the Constituent As-
sembly 1”


“We too had a meeting to some avail.
We debated. . . .
Deliberated. . . .
And adopted the following scale:
Five for a bit, twenty-five for the
night.
A copeck less wouldn’t be right.”
Even the wind-beat-
en grisettes use the
revolutionary jargon.
“Come with me, hon.”
It is late.
One flickering lamp
In the street. A stooping tramp
Goes past with shuffling gait.
The shrill winds hiss.
“Come here,
Poor dear,
Give us a kiss.”
“Bread 1”
“Oh, get ahead!”
As the hour ad-
vances, the streets
are emptied. Only
the starving and
homeless pass through
the cold midnight,
exchanging bitter
greetings.
Pitchy sky: no stars, no chart.
Hate, sorrowful hate,
Bursts the heart.
Black, holy hate.
Comrade,
Watch your gait!
They have trodden
the grapes of zorath,
and the vintage runs
dark in the streets.
The wind wafts the words:


Twelve Red Guards
move through the
snow. The drama
ivhich follows is
punctuated by the
notes of a far bugle,
by the crackle of
machine-guns, and
outbursts of revolu-
tionary songs.
The poem breaks ab-
ruptly into a ballad
about Vanka and his
sweetheart, Katya.
Vanka is a traitor
who has sold the
revolution for thirty
pieces of silver. And
Katya has gone with
him.
The wind is a whirl, the snow is a
In the night twelve men advance.
Black, narrow rifle-straps,
Cigarettes, tilted caps.
A convict’s stripes would lit their
Fires point their nightly tracks,
Freedom, ekh, freedom—
Unhallowed, unblessed!
Trah-tah-tah!
“It’s freezing, comrades, freezing.”
“To the pot-house went Vanka his
Katya to join.
Her stockings are stuffed with Ker-
ensky coin.
And Vanka himself is rich as a
prince.
He’s not one of ours, he’s deserted
long since.
Ekh, Vanka, boorzhooy, you wear a
white feather.
I’d like to see you and my girl get
together!”
Freedom, ekh, freedom,
Unhallowed, unblessed.
Vanka has Katya. . .
You know the rest!
Trah-tah-tah!


Fires blaze upon their track.
Their rifle-straps are gleaming black.
March to the revolution’s pace,
The enemy stirs in his hiding-place.
More daring, friends, take aim, the
At Holy Russia let’s fire a shot.
At hutted Russia,
Thick-rumped and solid,
Russia, the stolid,
Ekh, ekh, unhallowed, unblessed.

Ekh, thou bitter sorrow,
Ekh, the life we’ve won;

There’s a blade! With his glib
tongue
Silly Katya he has swung
To submit
Backward thrown, her head lies light,
And her teeth gleam pearly-bright.
“Ekh, Katya, you, Katya,
Chubby mug!”


“Under your left breast, my Katya,
There are scratches newly red.
Who has left a mark that bled
On your throat, my merry Katya?
Vanka teases

Ekh, ekh, dance for me:
You’ve a pair of legs, I see!
You used to go a pretty pace,
Wearing linen trimmed with lace.
You used to sin with the gold-braid
crew—
Come, sin, and get along with you!
Ekh, my heart leaps like a fish!
Your young cadet gave me my wish:
That beau did not escape the knife.
Refresh your wits, plague of my
Let us have a kiss from you.
Ekh, ekh, refresh me too!
Fine grey gaiters were your style.
You gobbled bon-bons all the while;
Kissed the cock-o’-the-walk, no
understrapper,
And now it’s any common sapper.
Sin away, my little tart,
It will ease your heart.”


Again the troika gallops along.
The cabman bellows a drunken
“Andrukha, hold the other horse!”
“Run back, Petrukha!” “Cut their
course!”
Crrrack-crack-crack! Crrrack-crack-
crack 1
The snow foams up like tossed sea-
wrack.
The cab and Vanka are out of sight.
Now cock the gun again, wheel
Crrrack! “You’ll learn, you churl,
To take another fellow’s girl!”
“The scoundrel’s gone.” “But I
know who
To-morrow will be quits with you.”
And where is Katya? Dead. She’s
dead.
The pretty slut shot through the
head.
Happy, Katya? Don’t you crow?
You carrion, lie there on the snow.
March to the revolution’s pace.
The enemy stirs in his hiding-place.
They drive through
the stormy night at a
smart pace. But in
their gaiety they
have forgotten the
twelve. There is a
skirmish. The rifles
crack. Vanka escapes
in the cab, but not
before his rival, Pi-
otr, has revenged
himself on Katya.
The twelve march on,
to a revolutionary
tune.


But Piotr is over-
come with remorse
for his vengeful shot.
He recalls his past
happiness, but his
companions jeer at
him kindly. Piotr is
induced to listen.
And again the twelve go marching.
Shoulders back and guns in place,
Only he, the poor assassin,
Marching does not show his face.
Forward, double-quick and faster
Now he moves at an even pace;
Buried in a ragged muffler,
Like a dog without a master.
“Comrade, come, what is your sor-
And that hang-dog grimace? Why?
Grief, Piotr, ’s cheap to borrow.
Does dead 1 Katya make you cry?”
“Ekh, comrades, you know the
Katya was my girl by rights.
How I loved her. God, the glory
Of our drunken summer nights!
It was she, it was the daring

It was her soft shoulder wearing

Piotr, are you a woman? Pooh!

Ekh, give up this silly chatter.
There are better things to do.


Comrade, have a little reason;
There’s no time to nurse you now.
Your poor trouble ’s out of season.
Harder loads won’t make us bow;
Dear comrade . . .”
Piotr moves a slower pace
And he shows a careless face,
Head thrown hack and eyes alight.
On his mouth a gaping' grin.

They break into a March to the revolution’s pace:

The Freeman
—a weekly paper edited by Mr. Francis Neilson and Mr. Albert
Jay Nock, is planned to meet the new sense of responsibility and
the new spirit of inquiry which recent events have liberated, especial-
ly in the field of economics and politics. It follows developments in
all phases of international life, and its point of view in the discussion
of industry and commerce is that of fundamental economics. In
dealing with public affairs, both domestic and foreign, it concerns
itself more with the principles of politics than with political events,
personalities or superficial issues; and especially with the economic
principles that underlie politics.
The Freeman is more interested in discovering popular sentiment
than in creating it and aims rather at enlightening and unifying
public opinion than at controlling or instructing it. It is grounded
in the belief that the greatest public service that can be performed
at this time is the promotion of free popular discussion, and that a
paper which desires disinterestedly to serve its age can do no better
than take this for its avowed function.
In its treatment of news The Freeman does not respect the
journalistic fetish of timeliness to the prejudice of accuracy, im-
portance and well-reasoned discussion. It does not in any sense
compete with the daily newspaper or with any weekly resume of
news. Nor does it pretend to compete with such organs of special
opinion, whether liberal or conservative, as are now serving a large
public and serving it exceedingly well.
The Freeman presents sound criticism, freely expressed, upon
literature and the fine arts, besides offering
works of creative imagination.
