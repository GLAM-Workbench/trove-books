French
National Day
14th July, 1917


Übc pleasure of pour presence is requested
at a DEMONSTRATION at the Town
Hall, Melbourne, at 3 p.m., on Saturday, the
14th July,
The Demonstration is to mark the National
Day of our great and gallant Ally—France.
Admission pill be by Ticket only, and, if
you are able to accept our invitation, will
you kindly 'apply to either of the Honorary
Organisers, and such Admission Card will be
forwarded .
As the seating accommodation is limited,
and a very big attendance is expected, you are
urged to apply for a Card of Admission as
early as possible.
The proceedings are to take the form of a
tribute to France, and no charge for admission
will be made. It is to be a Gift Afternoon,
and every guest is asked to bring a gift for
the French Patriotic Funds.
Her excellency Lady Helen Munro Ferguson
has signified her intention of being present,
the Lord Mayor, Sir David Hennessy,
will preside.
His Excellency the Governor, SIR ARTHUR L. STANLEY,
and
The Rt. Hon. the Prime Minister. Mr. W. M, HUGHES.
have graciously consented to address the gathering,


MADAME, MELBA
HAS VERY GENEROUSLY OFFERED TO SING.
This is Madame Melba’s first public
appearance since her last trip to America.
The powerful help she thus gives us will add
the greatest possible interest to the afternoon.
Owing to the difficulties of shipping goods
to France, it was decided to limit the Appeal
to money, and you are asked, therefore, to
make a gift in money, and not in kind.
Envelopes will be handed to every guest on
entering the Hall, wherein donations may be
put, and these will be collected. During the
proceedings an announcement will be made of
donations sent in before the Meeting, and, if
possible, a further statement made of the
approximate sum received during the afternoon.
Even if you are unable to be present, will
you not send us a donation, and thus permit
us to announce at our Demonstration a goodly
sum in response to our Appeal?
The burden of the French people is well-
nigh unbearable, and it is being carried with
a courage, a willingness, a realisation, and a
faith beyond power of expression.
France saved the civilised world in the
early months of the War . Shall we not help
her now?
R.S.V.P.
