In 1898 I contributed to the Anthropological Society at
Washington an article describing the initiatory rites and
social organisation of the native tribes of Victoria. 1 On
that occasion I stated : “ The only way at the present
time to accomplish what I have indicated [to define the
boundaries of the nations into which the aborigines were
divided] is to study the languages or dialects of the popu-
lation, grouping together those which have an evident
affinity.” It is now my intention to proceed with the
work I commenced in 1898.
At the time of writing the article referred to I had per-
sonally studied only two of the native tongues, but since
then I have made several additional journeys through
Victoria at various times for the purpose of visiting the
remnants of the different tribes and further examining the
structure of their speech. As no previous author has
attempted to supply the elements of the grammar of the
languages of the native tribes of Victoria, the pleasing
duty has devolved upon me to present to the reader a por-
tion of my researches in this direction. Gathering this
information from the lips of the natives, and reducing it to
1 “The Victoriai} Aborigines : their Initiation Ceremonies and Divis-
ional Systems.”—American Anthropologist, Yol. xi., pp. 325 - 343, with
map of Victoria, plate v.


a written form, has been a tedious and laborious task, the
difficult and tangled nature of which can be grasped only
by those who have embarked on the same line of investi-
gation. Space will preclude the consideration in this
article of more than the leading outlines of the constitution
of the several tongues.
In all the languages of Victoria, in every part of speech
which is subject to inflection, there is a double form of the
first person of the dual and plural —one of which includes,
and the other excludes, the individual addressed. Mr. J.
Dawson 1 observed two forms of the dual: “We two, thou
and I; we two, he and I;” but as he does not refer to
this peculiarity in the first person of the plural, I may be
pardoned for claiming its discovery in Victoria, having also
previously reported its existence in the languages of New
South Wales. 2
In all the dialects having the Tyattyalla structure, there
are four numbers —singular, dual, triple and plural. The
triple or trial number has also two forms in the first person
—one to include the person spoken to, and the other to
exclude him. The triple number has also been found by
me in the Thaguwurru and Woiwurru tongues, in which it
is now reported for the first time. In the eastern portion
of the Thaguwurru country, the triple is seldom used —the
speech of the people having coalesced with that of their
neighbours on the east, among whom the dual only is
recognised.
Among the native tribes of Victoria dealt with in this
paper, inflection for person and number is not confined to
the verbs and pronouns, but extends to many of the nouns,
prepositions, adverbs and interjections, a peculiarity which

was reported by me in certain aboriginal languages of New
South Wales last year. 1
It is beyond the scope of a short article like this to
furnish vocabularies of the dialects of every tribe. I have
therefore given two vocabularies only —the Tyattyalla and
the Brabirrawulung —the former being representive of the
tongues of Western Victoria, and the latter of Eastern
Victoria.
It may be added that a few of Mr. R. B. Smyth’s corres-
pondents noticed a dual in the pronouns, but the existence
of an inclusive and exclusive form in the dual and plural
was not observed by them. Portions of the conjugations
of a few verbs were also supplied to Mr. Smyth by some
of his contributors, but the grammatical structure of the
dialects was left untouched.
Applying a possessive suffix to nouns has been observed
in several islands of Polynesia. It was also briefly noticed
in a few Victorian tribes by some of Mr. R. B. Smyth’s
correspondents. The distinction between the “we inclu-
sive” and we exclusive” has been noticed in many dialects
of Polynesia and elsewhere, although not to such a full
extent as exemplified in the following pages.
The existence of a trial number was reported years ago
in Aneityum 2 and some other islands of the Pacific Ocean,
and was observed to some extent in the pronouns of the
Woddowro tribe in Victoria by Mr. Francis Tuckfield.' 1
Tlie trial number, as existing in the native languages of
Victoria, is different in character from that observed in
some other countries. For example, in the New Hebrides
the case-endings of the dual, trial, and plural are indepen-
dent, and vary from each other in form, thus:
1 Op. cit., p. 127.
* Rep. Aust. Assoc. Adv. Sci., i., pp. 482 - 483. 3 Op. cit., vn., p. 482.


We (dual inclusive) Akaijan
We (trial inclusive) Akataij
We (plural inclusive) Akaiji
But among the Victorian tribes, the trial number is formed
by adding another case-ending to that of the plural. For
example, in the Tyattyalla, Tyapwurru and Wuddyawurru
languages, an additional ending, kullik, is tacked on to the
suffix of the plural, as follows:
We (plural inclusive) Yurwengurruk
We (trial inclusive) Yurwengurrukkullik.
In the Thaguwurru and kindred tongues, the word baiap
is substituted for kullik, but it is employed in precisely the
same manner —It is added to the suffix of the plural—as in
the following example:
We (plural inclusive) Wanganyin
We (trial inclusive) Wanganyinbaiap.
In the Motu, one of the languages of New Guinea, Rev.
W. G. Lawes reports that the dual and trial of pronouns
are formed by additions to the plural. 1
The following authors have published vocabularies of
some of the dialects of Victoria: —
Mr. R. B. Smyth, “The Aborigines of Victoria,” Vol.
ii., pp. 1 220.
Mr. E. M. Ourr, “The Australian Race,” Vol. hi., pp.
437 589.
Mr. J. Dawson, “The Australian Aborigines of the
Western Districts of Victoria,” pp. 1 84.
Mr. J. J. Carey, from the manuscript of Mr. F. Tuck-
field, “Report Austr. Assoc. Adv. Science,” Yol.
vii., pp. 840 872.
There are other vocabularies, but the foregoing will be
sufficient for ordinary purposes of reference.
1 Motu Grammar and Vocabulary, p. 9.


All the languages of eastern Victoria, although differing
widely in vocabulary from the Thurrawal, 1 reported by me
last year, are yet substantially the same in grammatical
structure as that language. This remark also applies to
that portion of Victoria situated west of the 145th meridian
of longitude, the only difference being that the western
districts have the trial number, whilst the eastern have
not. The eastern and western tongues both have inflexion
for number and person of nouns, adverbs, prepositions, etc.,
in addition to that of the verbs and pronouns; both have
the double form of the first person in all numbers beyond
the singular. In the vocabularies of all these languages—
the Thurrawal, Tyattyalla, Brabirrawulung, etc. —there
are several words in common, showing a community of
origin. 2
Some of Mr. R. B. Smyth’s correspondents ventured to
send him stories purporting to be told in certain native
dialects. 3 I have looked over all these stories, and can
pronounce them to be mere ungrammatical jargon, written
by men who knew nothing of the structure of the languages
they were dealing with. They are on a par with the
-pigoo**- English of the Chinese costerer : “ Plenty me got
' 0 him cabbagee.”
It is desired in this place to thank all those gentlemen
who are in charge of Aboriginal Stations in Victoria, for
allowing me free access to the natives under their control,
and for other acts of kindness during my visits to their
respective districts, whilst I was engaged in linguistic and
other investigations among the native tribes of Victoria.

Orthography.
Eighteen letters of the English alphabet are sounded,
comprising thirteen consonants —b, d, g, h, k, l , m, n , p, r,
t, w, y —and five vowels —a, e, i , o, u.
The system of orthoepy adopted is that recommended by
the circular issued by the Royal Geographical Society,
London, with the following qualifications:—
It is frequently difficult to distinguish between the short
sound of a and u. A thick sound of iis occasionally met
with, which closely resembles the short sound of u or a.
As far as possible, vowels are unmarked, but in some
instances the long sound of a, e, and u are indicated thus,
a, e, u. In a few cases the short sound of u has been
marked thus, u.
Gis hard in all cases. R has a rough, trilled sound, as
in hurrah! W always commences a syllable or word.
Ng at the beginning of a word or syllable as ngu in ngu-ya ,
a camp, has a peculiar sound, which can be got very closely
by putting u before it, as ungu, and then articulating it as
one syllable. At the end of a syllable it has substantially
the sound of ng in “ sing.”
The sound of the Spanish nis frequent; at the beginning
of a word or syllable I have given it as ny , but when ter-
minating a word the Spanish letter is used. Yat the
beginning of a word or syllable has its ordinary consonant
value.
Dli is pronounced nearly as th in “ that,” with a slight
sound of d preceding it. Nil has also nearly the sound of
th in “ that,” but with an initial sound of the n. A final
h is guttural, resembling cli in the German word jocli.
T is interchangeable with d, p with b, and g with k, in
most words where these letters are employed. Ty and dy
at the commencement of a word or syllable have nearly


the sound of j or ch , thus dya or tya closely resemble ja
or cha. At the end of a word or syllable, ty or dy is
sounded as one letter; thus, lity, a child, can be pronounced
exactly by assuming e to be added to the y, making it
lit-ye; then commence articulating the word, including
the y, but stopping short without sounding the added e.
Dy at the end of a word can be pronounced in the same
way, the sound of d being substituted for that of t. In all
cases where there is a double consonant, each letter is
distinctly enunciated.
The Tyattyalla Language.
The Tyat'-tyal-la is spoken,by the natives about Lakes
Werringen and Albacutya, and is representative of the
speech of all the tribes scattered over the whole of that
moiety of Victoria situated west of a line from the sea
coast at Geelong 1 through Bendigo northerly to Pyramid
Hill, with the exception of the frontage to the Murray
River, from the latter place downwards.
The Boandik language, 2 spoken in the south-east corner
of South Australia, defined by being situated to the south
of a line from Kingston to Border Town, is the same in
grammatical structure as the languages of western Victoria
herein dealt with.
Nouns.
Number. —There are four numbers —singular, dual, trial
and plural. Wutyu, a man ; wutyu-bulin, a couple of men ;
wutyu-kullik, three men ; wutyu-getyaul, several men.
Gender. —Wutyu, a man. Laiaruk, a woman. Kulkun,
a boy. Lanangurk, a girl. Among animals, mamuk is
used for “male,” and pabuk for “female,” both in mam-
mals and birds; thus, wille mamuk, a buck opossum ; kauar
1 “ Victorian Aborigines etc.,” —American Anthropologist, xi , pp. 331
- 336. Map.
2 Op. cit., pp. 331 -336, and map of Victoria.


mamuk, a cock emu ; wille pabuk, a female opossum. The
kangaroo, mindyun, has an independent name, dhallung,
for the buck, and another, muty, for the doe. This rule
also applies to some other animals.
Case. —The principal cases are the nominative, possessive,
accusative, instrumental, dative and ablative.
There are two forms of the nominative, one of which
merely names the object under attention, as gal, a dog,
and then the noun remains unchanged. But when a tran-
sitive verb is used, the noun takes a suffix, as, Wutyuku
mindyul buyin, a man a kangaroo killed. Kulkunu bandyal
kargin, a boy a codfish caught. Gallu wille bundin, a dog
an opossum bit.
Possessive —A suffix is applied to the possessor and also
to the thing possessed, as Wutyuga gattimgattimuk, a man’s
boomerang. Laiura berkanuk, a woman’s yamstick. Kul-
kuna lahrnuk, a boy’s camp. The grammar also admits of
putting the thing possessed foremost in the sentence in
certain instances, for the sake of euphony, and then the
suffixes are transposed, as, lahrnga laiuk, instead of laiura
lahrnuk, a woman’s camp.
Anything over which possession can be exercised is sub-
ject to inflection for number and person. In the first
person of the dual, trial and plural, there are two forms of
the word —one, marked “inch,” including the person spoken
to; and the other, marked “ excl.,” in which the person
addressed is excluded:
Person.
Singular.
Ist My boomerang,
2nd Thy boomerang,
3rd His boomerang,
Gattimgattimek
Gattimgattimin
Gattimgattimuk
Person.
Dual.
j t f Our, incl., boomerang, Gattimgattimul
L I Our, excl., boomerang, Gattimgattimulluk

lstl ( Our, excl., boomerang, Gattimgattimandakullik
Person. Plural.
j Our, inch, boomerang, Gattimgattimurrak
lst | Our, excl., boomerang, Gattimgattimandak
The second and third persons of the dual, trial and plural
are omitted for want of space.
Accusative. —The accusative is the same as the simple
nominative. Instrumental. —Where a weapon or other
article is the remote object, the instrumental case takes
the agent suffix, as, Wutyu gattimgattimu burdenan, a man
with a boomerang struck I. Dative. —LaJirndal, to a camp.
Ablative. —Lahrnung, from a camp.
Adjectives.
Adjectives are inflected for number and case and follow
the nouns they qualify, as under :
Nominative —Wutyu kurunge, a man large.
Nom. agent —Wutyuk kurunguk gattimgattim yunggin,
a man large a boomerang threw.
Possessive —Wutyuga kurunga gattimgattimuk, a large
man’s boomerang.
Dative —Wutyugal kurungal, to the big man.
Ablative —Wutyugung kurungung, from the big man.
Comparison is effected by such expressions as “ This is
good ; that is bad; this is very good,” and so on, similarly
to the Thurrawal and Gundungurra languages. 1
Pronouns.
Pronouns are inflected for number and case, and are
without gender. There are two forms of the 4hireb person
in the dual, trial and plural, one of which includes the
individual addressed, and the other excludes him. The

These full forms of the pronouns are used chiefly in
answer to a question ; for example, “who is there ?” could
be replied to, “yurwalluk” (we, dual exclusive). “Whose
boomerang is this?” might elicit the answer, “yurwangek”
(mine), and so on. In conversation the pronominal suffixes
are used with the verbs, nouns, or other parts of speech,
as shown in the text of this paper.
The following are a few examples of the interrogatives:
Who is there, winya nyua ? Whom for, winyerra ? Whom
from, winyung ? What, nyanyo ? What for, nyanguk ?
Demonstratives are numerous, and usually follow the
word qualified. They vary with the position of the object
referred to with regard to the speaker, and also with its
distance from him, and are often inflected for number and
person. Ging, this ; ginyu, that.
Verbs.
Verbs have the same numbers and persons as the pro-
nouns, three tenses and three moods. The verb “tobe ”
has a substitute in the word yuma, which is inflected for
person and number. If an adjective, adverb, or other suit-
able word be taken as a predicate, we get the following
illustration:
Ist Person Good am I, Dhalguk yuman
2nd ~ Good art thou, Dhalguk yumar
3rd ~ Good is he, Dhalguk yuma
and so on through all the persons and numbers. Or the
inflection can be put on the predicate, as follows:
Ist Person Here I am, Gimban yuma
2nd ~ Here thou art, Gimbar yuma
3rd ~ Here he is, Gimba yuma
The following is the conj ligation of the principal elements
of the verb taka, “to beat.” The present tense is given
in full, but it is thought the fewt porsow* of the remaining
tenses will be sufficient.

Plural ~ „ Takdyerrangaty
The inflexion applies to the second person of the dual, trial
and plural, and also to the exclusive form of the first person.
Adverbs.
Yes, ngaie. No, wrekkea. Yesterday, dyalligea. To-
morrow, berbo. By and bye, mulluk nyungga. Long ago,
mullamea. In the future, mullukmea. Here, gimba. There
nyua. There (farther), mainyuk. There (farther still),
maiyo. Where is the camp, windyalahr ? Where art thou
from, windyangat kurtung? Whither goest thou, winyan-
gingukka ? How many, nyappur ?
Some adverbs are capable of inflection for person and
number, as follows :
Singular Where art thou ? Windyar
Dual Where are you ? Windyawul
Trial Where are you ? Windyatkullik
Plural Where are you ? Windyaty
All the persons in each number can be inflected.


Prepositions.
The comprehensive inflections in every part of speech
tend to diminish the use of prepositions, which are not
numerous. Several prepositions admit of inflection, as in
the following example.
( Ist Person Behind me, Walmengek
Singular < 2nd ~ Behind thee, Walmengin
(.3rd ~ Behind him, Waimenguk
Dual Ist Person i Behind us, incl., Walmengul

The other persons are omitted to save space.
Conjunctions.
A short word ba, or its euphonic variants, bam, ma, etc.,
appears to serve the purpose of “or,” “and,” or “because,”
according to the context.
Interjections and Exclamations.
These are not numerous. Halt thou, tyarrigi! Halt
you (dual), tyarrigiwal! Halt you (trial), tyarriyuatkullik!
Halt you (plural), tyarriyuat! Take care, ngatwurri!
Oease, kurungai! Exclamation of surprise, yukkai!
Numerals.
One, kaiup. Two, bulaty.
Tyapwurru and Wuddyawurru Dialects.
When travelling on the Hopkins River a few years ago,
I met a couple of old aborigines, one of whom was h native
of that river, and spoke Tyapwurru, whilst the other man
hailed from Ballarat district, and spoke Wuddyawurru. On
my taking a considerable number of notes of their dialects,


I found that the grammatical structure of both was iden-
tical, although differing somewhat in vocabulary. My
Wuddyawurru informant, “Jack Phillips,” died in 1901.
As both dialects are the same in structure as the Tyat-
tyalla tongue herein described, I shall introduce the pro-
nouns only in this paper. The following are the nominative
and possessive forms:
Singular.

Mr. J. J. Carey, from the MS. of Mr. F. Tuckfleld, pub-
lished an incomplete list of pronouns 1 closely resembling
the nominative case of the foregoing, but differing consider-
ably from the possessive. As Mr. Tuckfleld makes no
mention of the double form in the first person of the dual,
1 Rep. Austr. Assoc. Adv. Sci., Vol. vn., p. 853.


trial and plural, we may safely infer that he did not observe
it. The verbs of these languages are inflected for singular,
dual, trial and plural, the same as the pronouns. Nouns,
adjectives, prepositions, etc., are also declined for number
and person, as in the Tyattyalla language.
The Thaguwurru Language.
The Thaguwurru and kindred tribes occupied the country
drained by the Goulburn, Oampaspe, and Ovens rivers, 1
exclusive of a strip along the valley of the Murray, and
were bounded on the south by the main dividing range.
For the grammar of the languages of the Murray River
tribes, the reader is invited to peruse other articles written
by me on this subject.
Nouns.
Number. —Nouns have four numbers, as in the Tyattyalla.
Mariim, a kangaroo. Marum-bulaih, a pair of kangaroos.
Murum-baip, three kangaroos. Marum-buladhuin, several
kangaroos.
Gender. —Kulin, a man. Bedyur, a woman. Yernyern,
a youth. Burnai, a girl. Bubup, a child of either sex.
In animals the female is denoted by babannu, and the male
by laigurn; thus, burraimul babannu, an emu hen ; burrai-
mul laigurn, a cock emu ; mariim laigurn, a buck kangaroo
Bunyer means a doe of any animal when enceinte.
Case. —The nominative-simple indicates any object at
rest, as wangim, a boomerang ; yirrangin, a dog, Gannafi,
a yamstick. Kargin, a tomahawk. The nominative-agent
represents the subject in action, as, Kulindya walert tyilbai,
a man an opossum struck. Yirrangina mariim bundai, a
dog a kangaroo bit. Bedyura yok bangai, a woman an eel
1 “ The Victorian Aborigines, etc.” —American Anthropologist, xi., pp.
326 - 330, with map of Victoria.


caught. Babannunnu bubup tyilbai, the mother the child
beat.
Possessive. —The proprietor and the property each take
a suffix, as, Kulindyal wangimu, a man’s boomerang.
Bedyural gannanyu, a woman’s yamstick.
The article possessed can be inflected for person and
number, as in the Tyattyalla.

The Woiwurru Dialect.
This dialect was spoken on the Yarra, Saltwater, and
Werribee rivers, and extended from the main dividing


range southerly to the sea-coast at Geelong, Melbourne,
and Western Port. The Woiwurru tongue is the same
in structure as the Thaguwurru, although some words of
the vocabulary are different. About Western Port, the
Woiwurru was called Bunwurru by some families, but
it is essentially the same language. The rules for
the declension of nouns, adjectives and other parts of
speech are similar in the Thaguwurru and Woiwurru,
whilst the pronouns are identical, lienee my remarks will
be restricted to the conjugation of a verb. In the
Thaguwurru the verb “to sit ” is ngurna, but in the
Woiwurru it is ngulla. 1
Indicative Mood —Present Tense.

The Brabirrawulung Language.
The Brabirrawulung tribe occupied the territory from
the Mitchell River to the Tambo, including the watersheds
of these rivers and their tributaries, with the exception of


a strip of country along the sea-coast. This tribe is men-
tioned by R. B. Smyth in his valuable work on “ The
Aborigines of Victoria.”
As the Brabirrawulung was formerly an important and
centrally situated tribe, I propose adopting its name for the
language spoken in eastern Victoria from Tarwin River to
Gape Howe, and reaching back from the sea-coast northerly
to the Australian Alps. In my former article on the native
tribes of Victoria, 1 I adopted the name Kurnai (or Kunnai)
a native word meaning “man,” to distinguish all the people
within, the geographic limits above mentioned. I now
think, however, that the term “Brabirrawulung Nation ”
is more appropriate, because it is the name of one of the
native tribes within the region under consideration. Mr.
E. M. Curr states that in his opinion, the Gippsland (Bra-
birrawulung) tribes are all the same stock —one descended
from the other. 2 It has fallen to my lot to be the first
to explain the constitution of their language. There
are some differences in the vocabularies of the people
occupying the eastern and western portions respeptively
of the area above described, but the fundamental elements
of their grammar are the same throughout. The marriage
laws and totemic system of the Brabirrawulung nation are
the same as those in force among the adjoining coastal
tribes of New South Wales, described by me in a previous
communication to this Society. 3
Nouns.
Number. —There are three numbers —singular, dual and
plural. Dyira, a kangaroo. Dyirabulung, a couple of
kangaroos. Dyirawamba, several kangaroos.
1 “ The Victorian Aborigines: their Initiation Ceremonies and Divisional
Systems”—American Anthropologist, Vol. xi., pp. 330-331, and map
showing distribution of the native tribes of Victoria.
2 “The Australian Race,” Vol. in., p. 540.
3 Journ. Royal Soc. N. S. Wales, Yol. xxxiv., pp. 263, 264.


Gender. —Kunnai, a man. Rukut. a woman. The gen-
der of animals is distinguished by employing the word
brangula for males, and yukkana for females, as, dyira
brangula, a male kangaroo; dyira yukkana, a female kan-
garoo.
Case. —The cases comprise the nominative, nominative-
agent, possessive, accusative, dative, instrumental, and
ablative.
Nominative. —Wangin, a boomerang. Kunnin, a yamstick.
Gri, a canoe. Bang and nguya, both mean a camp. Lity,
a boy.
Nominative-agent. —Kunnaio waddhan dhanda, a man an
opossum eats. Waddhando dyerring dhanda, an opossum
leaves eats.
Possessive. —The chattel and the owner are both declined.
Wanginma kunnaia, a man’s boomerang. Grima rukutta,
a woman’s canoe. Nguyama lia, a boy’s camp.
Every object over which ownership exists can be declined
for person and number:
| Ist Person My boomerang, Wangingitha
Singular 2nd „ Thy boomerang, Wangingina
( 3rd ~ His boomerang, Wanginung
i«t Pp, / ° ur » inch, boomerang, Wanginalla
* I Our, excl., boomerang, Wanginalanalla
and so on through all the persons and numbers.
Dative. —Banggea, to the camp. Ablative. —Bangga,
from the camp.
Pronouns.
The following few examples of the nominative and posses-
sive pronouns will exhibit their inflection :
( Ist Person I, Ngaiu Mine, Ngithalung
Singular 2nd „ Thou, Ngindu Thine, Nginnalnng
( 3rd „ He, Nungga His, Nungalung


There are two pronouns for the first person of the dual,
and also two for the plural, one of which is used when the
person addressed is included with the speaker, and the other
when the person addressed is excluded.
Interrogatives. —Nganinde, who? Ngandoanggo, who
(did it). Nanma, wliat?
Adjectives.
Adjectives are declined for number and case, and are
placed after the qualified noun.
Verbs.
Verbs have the same numbers, persons, tenses and moods
as those of the Thurrawal language, reported by me last
year. 1 The following are examples in the present tense of
the indicative mood, of the verb “ to sit,” and the verb
“to see”: —
| Ist Person I sit, Bunnunganaty
2nd ~ Thou sittest, Bunnunganin
( 3rd „ He sits, Bunnunganung
{lst Person I see, Dhakanadha
2nd ~ Thou seest, Dhakaninna
3rd „ He sees, Dhakanunggo
Singular
Singular
In the first person of the dual and plural, there is a vari-
ation in the suffix of the verb, indicating the inclusion or
exclusion of the party spoken to.
Adverbs.
Yes, nga. No, ngalko. Tyilli, to-day. Mulgotbilla, this
evening. Yesterday, mulbokang. Brundhu, to-morrow.
Mulbitthunga, long ago. Tyillaiu, by and bye. Gunno,
perhaps.
Wunraan, where (singular). Wunmandu, where (dual).
Wunman ngurdurna, where (plural). Wulgunggo, which
way? Wulngin, how?
1 “The Thurrawal Language,” —Journ. Roy. Soc. N. S. Wales, Vol,
xxxv., pp. 127 - 160.


Prepositions.
Prepositions may be either separate words, or consist
of modifications of other parts of speech to give them a
prepositional meaning. Several prepositions can be in-
flected for number and person, like the Thoorga. 1
Buth, between, as, Dakanbulung buth, box-trees two
between (between two box-trees).
| Ist Person Behind me, Gandingitha
Singular 2nd ~ Behind thee, Gandingina
(3rd ~ Behind him, Gandinung
Numerals.
Gutaban, one. Bulaman, two.
Conclusion.
Having now fulfilled the gratifying duty of preserving a
record of the grammatical elements of the aboriginal lan-
guages of Victoria, I will ask the reader’s indulgence for
any shortcomings which are necessarily incident to the first
attempt to master a difficult subject —especially when the
immense geographic area dealt with is taken into consider-
ation. When first entering upon this work it was found to
possess no literature, beyond a few vocabularies, already
referred to in the preface to this article, and all my infor-
mation had to be obtained orally from the natives. Now,
however, that I have overcome the initial difficulties of
laying down the elements of the grammar of the several
languages, it will be comparatively easy for any future
investigator to extend and improve the work I have begun.
Vocabulary.
The following vocabulary contains 325 English words,
with their equivalents in Tyattyalla and also in Brabirra-
wulung, making a total of G5O aboriginal terms. Every
word in the vocabulary has been taken down by myself in
1 See my “Thoorga and Yookumbil Languages/’—Proc. Roy. Geog.
Soc. Aust., Q. Branch, Vol. xvn., p. 49 - 73.


the camps of the natives, and much time and care have
been bestowed upon the work. In the few instances where
a word is given in one language, and not in the other, either
the natives were not quite sure of the word, or I inadver-
tently omitted to note it. Again, some animals and plants
are found in one district, which do not exist in another.
