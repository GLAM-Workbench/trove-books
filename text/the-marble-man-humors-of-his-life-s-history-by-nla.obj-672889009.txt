CHAPTER I.
IN WHICH THE SOLILOQUY OP THE MARBLE MAN VERIFIES THE
PRESUMPTION OP “SERMONS IN STONES.”
T N abatement of popular prejudice I attempt tbis Auto-
I biography, well aware, at tbe outset, that the public
have a reasonable right to expect the narrative to adhere
to the solid truth. To belie that expectation would be to
belie my character.
No ordinary “ flesh and blood ” could long endure the
reproaches and resentment with which my appearance in
public has been systematically greeted; and I have suffered
in silence long enough to entitle me to a full share of public
commiseration. While the rest of the world is buried in
slumber, I pensively contemplate the monotony of my lot
and the insipidity of my sapless existence, marvelling the
while whence it arises that so peaceable (not to say passive)
an individual as I am, has had the ill-fortune to attract so
much enmity and excite so much scorn.
Too long have I thus tamely submitted to persecution intense
enough to wring anguish from a heart of stone. It is not the
fault of my detractors that it has failed to effect the end
in view; for to the captious critic I have been, so to speak,
“ a ready-made target ” for his puny pellets, whilst every cold-
hearted cynic, on the hunt for a seasonable sneer, has found
in me “ a natural quarry.”
Indeed, the tongue of gossip and the pen of slander have
both been over-free with my good name and fame; and not
content with aspersing my origin, deriding my genealogy,
and casting suspicion on my. birthplace, people have been


malignant enough to impeach my very existence—by stubbornly
denying my right to exist. Were it not for the interference
of one or two sharp-witted members of the medical profession
(notably Dr. McCarthy), there would long ago have been
an autopsy of my remains, and I should have been arbitrarily
cast aside as so much worthless clay. Thanks to the inter-
vention of such surgeon-sculptors, I remain in statu quo, and
the time has not yet come when careless clerics can flippantly
say of me “ Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”
But though preserved from an immature re-entry into
“ mother earth,” I have yet to learn what it is to enjoy
freedom from misrepresentation and malice. My nature,
character and composition have all been the sport of contra-
dictory conjecture; and the very variety of the conclusions
arrived at has forced me into public notoriety far beyond
the tension of either my hopes or my ambitions.
Even the knowledge that I began my career as an orphan
and a foundling —that the author of my being is still un-
identified and unknown —and that all my kindred were “ stone
dead ” before I was brought forth—has not availed against
the mischievous tendency of mankind to hail my advent
everywhere with ridicule and mistrust.
Since others, therefore, have inflicted on me so much
injustice, it only remains for me to do justice to myself, and,
with this intent, I propose to gather my flaws into focus and
run the rule over my protuberant virtues.
Though not cast in the same mould as most other men,
yet, like hnmanity in the average, the good and bad in nature
are freely mixed in my composition ; but the solidity of my
character presents an initial advantage in my favour when
contrasted with the frivolity of my contemporaries. As a
counterpoise to this, I own at once that I am naturally too
“ thick-headed ” to hope to compare with them in intellectual
qualifications.
And now, super visum corporis, let me first deal with my
bodily perfections and imperfections. I am a robust, sturdy
man, possessing (so say the doctors) a splendid constitution
and a superior physique, both pointing to the probabilities of


extreme longevity. My organs are sound, and singularly free
from fatty degeneration. I have, indeed, very few bodily ail-
ments, constitutional or acquired, with the exception of being a
martyr to gravel, which, like the gout in bluer-blooded families,
appears to be an infirmity indigenous to our race. Thanks to
the regular life I lead, I do not know what it is to suffer
from either toothache, spasms, dyspepsia, or rheumatism.
My appetite is uniform, and (being more a Stoic than an
Epicure) my digestion is perfect.
Turning now from an inspection of the body to an intro-
spection of the mental attributes (whose character the health
of the body so materially sways) I may claim at once that,
if not exactly a “ pillar of righteousness,” I am at least “ as
good as they make ’em,” being exceptionally free from both
the amiable weaknesses and grosser vices which afflict mankind.
As a rigid teetotaller, no other Grand Worthy Patriarch
deserves better of the Order. Not only have I never attained
the happiness of becoming “stone blind drunk,” but I can
boast, with greater truth than any of them, that liquor has
never defiled my lips nor found its way to my stomach. Not
that I have any fear that alcohol—good, bad, or indifferent —
would weaken my intellect, ruin my health, dwarf my faculties,
or cause any secrets to ooze from my bosom ! On the contrary,
I have a constitution capable of bidding defiance to the
ravages of drink, for even the delirious delights of an attack
of horrors are denied me. Herein I am deserving of the
greater credit for my abstinence, for whereas I am sober for
virtue’s sake, most other teetotallers remain in a comatose
state of sobriety only because they fear the inevitable ill-
consequences of a friendly wrestle with the essences which
owe their spiritual virility to an old-world Hennessy or a
new-world Toohey.
I do not wish my patrons to infer from this that I am
ignorant of the internal comforts of a well-kept hostelry ; but
i maintain that I have never set foot in a public-house except
when dragged there on business, or when my guardians wished
to screen me from the prying eyes of the inquisitive and
the incredulous. At such times I have had to tamely submit
B


to the practical jokes and ribald taunts of men (less manly
than I) who openly sneered at my presence and threw in my
teeth (so to speak) the charge that I was an encrimsoned
fraud and an empurpled hypocrite —further alleging that I
was far from being what I was made out to be, that I
was only a colorable imitation of “the noblest work of God,” and
that, at best, I was an ill-looking accomplice in a conspiracy
to obtain a livelihood by false pretences. To such reproaches
as these I inevitably remained mute, wisely trusting to the
disarming efficacy of silent contempt. One drunken brawler
went so far, on one occasion, as to level his fist at me and
strike me a heavy blow on the forehead. As phlegmatic as
an Amsterdam aristocrat, I never moved a muscle; neither
did my assailant repeat the blow, nor otherwise evince any
disposition to renew hostilities.
If my sobriety is sublime, let me add that my chastity
is phenomenal. To all immoral inclinations 1 am naturally
impervious, and to gallantries of every grade I plead not
guilty; while as for seduction and adultery, they are, with
me, lost arts, for I have been too severely nurtured to allow
the lusts of the flesh to prevail against my better nature.
No lamentations of ruined maids, or reproaches of giddy
matrons, can call a blush to my cheeks; and the most
tempting virgin is as safe in my company as in that of a
country curate, or of even St. Anthony himself. I make this
avowal in all humility, for who knows but that Fortune, to
compensate me for unnumbered years of single-wretchedness,
may yet carve me a Galatea to Pygmalionize my granite heart ?
Neither has the lust of ambition ever gained ascendancy
over my native love of retirement. Others of my race,
claiming to be men of more solid attainments than their
fellows, have not been slow to usurp the best places in the
Senate and the Synod, and to covet the cosiest nooks in the
service of the State; but, though equalling the rest of my
family in capacity, I excel them all in modesty. My thoughts
tend naturally to seclusion, nor am I ever tempted with even
a fugitive longing to
“ Leave iny sandprints on the Foot of Time.”


Of minor evils I am equally barren and my flaws are few.
I am incapable of bearing false witness against my neighbour,
and my lips sedulously refrain from speaking guile. Neither
to friend nor foe have I ever raised my hand in anger, and
although I once fell upon my guardian and nearly killed him,
yet the encounter was not of my seeking. There is but little
dirt in my nature, but on the contrary, an abundance of real
old-fashioned grit.
In all my tastes I am super-simple. In dress I am not
fastidious, and I am as presentable in one coat as another.
If I have any partiality in this direction it is for the grey garb
of a Quaker, which perhaps suits me better than another.
A “ masher ” I regard as ingeniously and ingenuously filling
the vacant grade in animal life between a peacock and a
pismire. Given enough apparel to hide any apparent deform-
ity and to conceal my nakedness from eyes too prying, and I
raise no question as to its cut or texture.
Levity is not among my besetting sins. Like the youth
whose mortal remnants inspired Gay’s Elegy, “ melancholy
marked me for its own,” and my stereotyped gravity eclipses
that of any “ Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”
My religious principles are fixed and unalterable. It is
conjectured by some superficial thinkers that I am addicted
to the worship of graven images, but in this they labour under
an error. Ever since the day when “ the mountain laboured
and brought forth ” —me, I have been enrolled among the
Dissenters, for as a dissentient being I am truer to nature.
I hold (I may add) a prominent position among “ primitive ”
methodists.
In politics, it is almost unnecessary to announce myself as
a thorough Conservative—one of the moss-grown, antediluvian
species which occasionally emerge from their graves to woo the
sweet suffrages of sour-faced electors. But lam naturally too
upright to be able to take a seat in Parliament, nor is any
legislative tribunal on earth empowered to suspend the
standing-orders relating to myself.
Of most political “ burning questions ” I take a volcanic
Mew. I believe ardently in the maintenance of the “primary ”


school system, although I would favor a little more attention to
the elevating studies of geology and physical geography.
Our land laws, I hold, should be so liberalised as to en-
courage the settlement on the soil of people like myself, than
whom none can be said to fulfil the residential conditions with
greater bona-fides ; nor, having secured our homestead lease,
ought we to be ever unsettled through lack of fixity of tenure.
Compulsory cultivation of the soil is an idea I scout as un-
lawfully interfering with our lethargic notions of settlement.
The rabbit pest I would promptly solve by petrifying the
rabbits.
On the vital question of the day I am, like all our race, a
Protectionist to the spine bone and fiscal marrow. I especially
hold that if the manufactured article enters duty free, the raw
material should not be taxed. In this respect the National
Party owes a heavy obligation to every member of our family,
for if there were no fossils, Protection would be an extinct vice.
My occupation in life is that of an Observer, pure and
simple. Our family motto — audi, vide, tace —is steadfastly ad-
hered to by me as an effective antidote against even the
garrulity of extreme old age. In this respect I am superior to
many better known and better hated representatives of my
race, who have literally talked themselves into power and
preferment, the foregoing family motto restraining them, when
attracted by the flesh-pots of Egypt, —not at all. These men,
I may observe, were well-authenticated fossils years before I
emerged from the hermitage in which I spent the best years of
my existence.
Beyond this occupation as an observer of all things worth
observing, 1 have no professional pursuit and but little
mechanical inclination, and this notwithstanding that my
foster-father is of a race ingenious in mechanism. His
grandsire was a builder, his sire was an architect, and he
himself has the reputation of being a great designer; but
through lacking either the genius, the industry or the luck to
turn his labors to good account, he is reported to have quitted
his calling, turned his back on honest trade, and dedicated the
balance of his life to so shaping my future that he might


proudly exhibit his offspring to the world as a chaste, polished,
and highly finished production. So great is his attachment to
me that he familiarly terms me “a chip off the old block,”
nicknames me “ Sandy,” and proclaims his boast everywhere
that I am the best of all his natural sons.
As my putative father cannot bear me long out of his sight,
I have had no opportunity myself to acquire either a profession
or a trade. Personally I have always had a desire to be a
lawyer, for I am flinty-hearted enough to threaten formidable
rivalry to Judge D •. On the other hand, I fear I would
not be a success at the legal profession, for though I can stand
being “ chiselled,” I am a bad hand at cheating.
As to my shortcomings—if any —they are plainly sins of
omission only. I have an hereditary aversion to a life of
active usefulness, and hence I am—l humbly own—open to
reiterated accusations of intentional indolence. My critics,
however, go so far as to arraign me as an idle imposter and a
worthless ne’er-do-well, and attribute all my misfortunes to
U ingrained ” iniquity. They forget that —not being what the
world calls “ a self-made man ” —I am not the architect of
my own fortunes, and that it is my mischance, not my fault,
that others attempted to carve my future for me and, by an
improper exercise of free masonry, carved it badly.
Against persistent and periodic ill-usage even the worm will
turn to stone, and I am heart-sick of emulating the patriarch
of the land of Uz. So I dedicate these memoirs to those who,
like my foster-father, are broad-minded enough to neglect
laying “judgment to the line or justice to the plumb-line.”
In perusing them, be good enough to admit that even a Marble
Man may, by a life of rigid propriety, become exalted into a
pillar of righteousness.
I wish, by these means, to be recognised as what I really
am not as the fraud the public conceives me to be. lam a
marvel, but not a myth; and when therefore, at last, “ this
too, too solid flesh shall melt,” and mother Earth again absorb
me ’ posterity do me the justice now denied me. If my
fossil fragments are forbidden to commingle in the State House
of the future with the aromatic ashes of defunct Premiers and


the deodorised dust of decayed poets, let tradition be at least
kind euough to no longer sandwich me between Perkin
Warbeck and the Wagga butcher.
I look thus to the hereafter on earth ; that beyond the
grave has for me no terrors, for in the matter of the fiery
furnace lam quite capable of out-Shadraching Shadrach. As
on earth I have been my own great obstruction, so when my
tour on earth is ended, I shall become my own tombstone,
sharing with Sir Christopher Wren, on equitable and appro-
priate grounds, the perspicuous epitaph—
“ Si nionumentum requiris, circumspice.”


CHAPTER II.
THE MARBLE MAN EXPLAINS THE THREE-FOLD CHARACTER OF
EXISTENCE, AND DISCOURSES WITH BECOMING GRAVITY ON
THE OBSERVANCES AND OBLIGATIONS OF LIFE.
IF you have not been amiss in your attendance at church
recently, but still groan under the influence of an
ecclesiastical exploration among the chasms of the ’ isms
you will do well to skip this chapter. It is a preternaturally
pious prelude, rendered necessary in explanation of the dual
character of my existence.
Except during a dread of its curtailment, few persons
trouble their heads about the complex significance of existence.
It is well that it is so, for when a youth is old enough to
recognise for the first time that he is a fledgling of the human
brood, it is the keenest folly for him to let his thoughts hark
back in conjecture how he came there ; the speculation is apt
to prove bewildering, and the conjectural retrospect is pro-
bably painful.
Such a wilful waste of the precious moments of which
Life is all too sparing is permissible only to dudes and dukes,
who enjoy the privileged pastime of mentally analysing the
blueness of their blood and the bleakness of their benevolence.
On the other hand, youths with any grit in their com-
position are content to recognise the fact that there they are,
and that, whether propagated by peer or produced by peasant,
they have “ got there just the same ”; and they wisely de-
termine that, as their stay here is regulated within uncertain
limits, it is their duty to make the most of their visit, to walk
in the sunny avenues of life wherever practicable, to vault
over or kick down all obstacles that a leap can avoid or a kick
overcome, and, whenever and wherever circumstances permit,
to lend a friendly hand to help a lamer dog over the stile or
a more luckless one out of the gutter.


So much for existence on earth. As for the existence that
has to follow the exit of the soul from the body, it is idle
to waste time in endeavouring to fathom that secret, for it is
simply unfathomable. Guess away at even its leading features
till all the hair emigrates from your head, and the last tooth
drops out of the last socket, and you will know even less than
when you began to sadden the sunshine of your life by con-
juring the unconjurable.
Dive into divinity as deep as you may —torture theology
to its utmost tension—and although you “gain the right to
wear silk stockings and govern a See,” yet you know as little
about the Infinite Hereafter as the babe on whom you pro-
nounce the blessings of baptism, and whose merry laughter
is nearer the standard of heavenly expectation than is the
more solemn intonation with which you represent your own
right reverend rigour !
Is religion, then, a myth ? By no means; but it is an
edifice of acts, not a Babel of sounds. Charity—not ceremony
—loosens the hinges of the gates of Paradise. Conscience—
not the clergyman —is the accredited plenipotentiary of
Providence. Christianity must be reared and fattened on
intermutual love, the practical exercise of which, in many
churchgoers, is supplanted by ceremony and cant. Hence it
is that the heathen in huts and hovels exhibit more frequent
touches of pure humanity than ordinarily emanate from
hard-hearted clerics, and pompous, priggish, and preter-pious
High Churchmen.
I have sermonised thus much concerning the existence
that is and the existence that is is to be, because I have now
to recall the fact that there is a third state of being, usually
ignored alike by profane and devout, and which I may as well
speak of—if the reader will pardon the paradox—as the
existence that was.
Pew members of the earth’s surface are permitted to boast
of a pre-existence, but this has been the proud prerogative
of my race from the first moment when the upper crust of the
earth began to force its way to the front.
Perhaps this enviable acquisition may account in some


measure for the scornful and vindictive treatment accorded
to me by most men; for it is a sad truism that, whatever your
station in life, your contemplation of the height of happiness
may he defined as the prospect of acquiring what is beyond your
reach. If you are only a common flute, you hunger to become
a Fife; and if you were a Fife, you would aspire to be one of
the instruments that do duty in the orchestra of the Theatre
Royal!
Nor is it less a truth that (as if the better to conceal your
idolatrous conception of the unattainable) you make hot haste
to inform your friends and the world at large how incurably
worthless is that which you cannot reach. When the wily
old fox found a permanent margin between his predatory paws
and the tantalising grapes, he solaced his bitterness by
circulating a rumour that the vine was a prey to phylloxera.
This world, be it noted, is fuller of foxes than of grapes.
From this I infer that my anterior existence is a source
of human envy, as vesting in me a pedigree for which Baron
Tennyson would give his beard, and King Midas would part
with his ears. Unfortunately, like all the privileged classes,
1 am condemned to pay for past glories by discounting future
prospects.
Existence has, as I have shown, a triple state—a past,
present, and future; but of these three states no being can
attain more than two. To most men belong the two last,
but to marble manhood the two first are reserved. Hence,
although my past is phenomenal and my present purgatorial,
what is called “the future” has no other end in store for me
" that I can see—but absolute annihilation.
Of my pre-existence, as thus alluded to, I may as well
speak first.


CHAPTEE III.
CONTAINING APOLOGETIC ALLUSIONS TO THE CONVICT BLEND,
NECESSARILY INCLUDED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE
PETRIFIED PHILOSOPHER.
IN’ gathering the particles of my pre-existence into the
concentrated form in which they now appear, I must
“ transport ” the reader to the earliest era in Australian
civilized history—to that period, in fact, which many a stickler
for ancestral etiquette would give the price of an earl’s ransom
to obliterate from record and remembrance.
In providing us with an ancestry, Great Britain was
charitable enough to give ns ungrudgingly the benefit of
her criminals. For such minor mercies we should be unre-
servedly grateful, for she might have been more severe upon
us and sent us her old nobility. In the latter instance our
national prospects would have suffered the deterioration which
awaits those who rely less upon their own merits and more
upon the merits of progenitors dead and decomposed.
Nor have we much basis for our sneers at our national
forefathers, for such is the change in men and manners, that
the criminals of a century ago were much better folks than
the God-fearing gentry of to-day. That this is a truism
needs but a peep below the surface such as, from my hermi-
tage, I was peculiarly privileged to take. This man is out-
wardly holy, but at heart he is a hollow humbug. That one
spouts volumes against intemperance, but he keeps a private
still. Here is such a one as presents to the world an attitude
of Puritan morality, but his source of revenue is a dilapi-
dated terrace of houses leased at fancy prices to the lowest
characters of the city. There is a pious layman drawling the
service for the day as the vicar’s substitute; at night he will
be robbing the poor-box to back a “dead-bird” at the Gar


rington. Next Sabbath, should the kettle boil oyer, he will
drawl away louder than ever, and dip his hand into the'
church-plate with increased dexterity and diminished diffi-
dence. This immensity of hypocrisy and coagulation of cant
make a civilised community the place, above all others, where
things are not what they seem, and seem not what they are.
These are facts we should remember when we feel tempted
to sneer at our ancestors ; for the times have changed more
than men have. In a.d. 1800, Smith stole a few Swede turnips
with which to appease the hunger of a starving wife ; and the
law, in a weak moment of mercy, forebore to hang him,
substituting the penalty of transportation for life. In A.D-
--1900 his great-grandson, De Smythe, embezzles three thousand
pounds to feed the . vanity of his .concubines, carries his
eye-glass and cane to his trial, is accommodated with a seat on
the floor of the court, and asking to be summarily dealt with,
escapes with three months’ light labour, apologetically admini-
stered by a reluctant bench of magistrates. In all ages and
all climes, the Law is a two-faced jade, ready, on the slightest,
provocation, to kick the costermonger and caress the Duke of
Cambridge.
The truth is, that we need neither bewail nor belaud the
historic convict strain in the blood of the nation. To those
whom it thus handicaps in the race of life, it also incites to
intenser efforts to w r in renown for their own achievements,
and gain esteem for their own personal merits.
In other respects it is a healthy safety-valve to any plethora
of pride. To the would-be patrician, whose vanity is centred
in his inherited lands and legacies, it is an opportune stum-
bling-block to trip him up whenever he flatters himself
that his gold can buy the adulation of admiration anywhere
but from the lip of a human leech or the pore of a human
sponge. Of a truth, a few of these scions of a convict nobility
need some such judicious claw-clipping, for they have an indo-
lence of intellect and an activity of scholastic brag, qualifying
them to prattle as patronisingly of Euclid’s Elements as if
their ancestors did not even know “ triangles ” when they saw
them.


On the same principle it is a salutary provision in Nature
to run the sharpest thorns in partnership with the richest
blossoms, so that even the frigid, gilded dame—apparently a
pachyderm in her pearls as well as a dowager in her draperies
—gathers her skirts with less artificial hauteur and more
womanly tremulousness when she recalls the fact that ill-
repressed infanticidal inclinations impelled her grandma to
■cross the raging main.
Pride of pedigree is a chimera. Blood is an ephemeral
■essential, not a barometrical ballast. Our duty, therefore, is to
bind ourselves over in our own recognizances to live in the
supremacy of the future, —not to wither in the supposed supe-
riority of the past.


CHAPTER IV.
HOW, BY MASSACRE AND MASTICATION, MY MOLECULES WERE
MASSED INTO MARBLE MANHOOD.
THE population of New South Wales, at the close of the
last century, was necessarily limited, for hunger and
the hangman had been gaunt partners in rendering the
sparse ranks of the pioneer populace still sparser.
Of the Pilgrim Fathers and aborigines, who had even then
undertaken to struggle for the survival of the fittest, very few
names have descended by fame to even a fugitive abiding-place
in the memories of the people. It is not to be expected,
therefore, that the names which I have now to divulge will be
as familiar to my readers as their individual merits deserve.
Of the primitive populace of the era at which I write,
this autobiography concerns itself about four only; and these
were—
Samuel Stone, convict.
Cornelius Clay, ditto.
Lemuel Lime, prison chaplain.
Bundarra, a native chief.
The first three arrived with the First Fleet, and the last was, like
myself, indigenous to the soil. Stone and Clay had been fellow
clerks in a nail-manufactory at Stratford—that gloomy suburb
of London, so noted for its piquant breed of costermonger and
ds peculiar expressiveness of dialect, of which latter fact
Chaucer, in a facetious moment, testified his acquaintance
when he wrote—
“ She spake the French of Stratford-atte-Bow,
The French of Paris being to her unknow.”
A theft., perpetrated by Stone, resulted in the conviction of
Clay, the law (as is its common custom) so disarranging justice
as to prove the guilt of the innocent man by thrusting him in
the dock and placing the actual offender in the witness-box to
testify against him.


But before Clay bad well tasted the delights of prison life,
Nemesis had already squared matters with Stone by bringing
him to justice for indulging in two wives more than the
license of the law condones. Of course, the trigamous Stone
should there and then have succumbed to remorse and excul-
pated Clay, and so he would, if this were a work of fiction; but
being a narration of fact, the truth compels me to state that
he was not such a fool as to add to his punishment by adopting
the stereotyped suggestions of remorse.
Hence it came about that the guilty and the innocent
became links in the one chain as fellow-passengers to Botany
Bay. Clay went mad on the voyage; perhaps he brooded
over-much on his wrongs, or took too pessimistic a view of the
commission entrusted to him by the Judges of Assize, to go and
found a nation. At all events, there was the ordinary amount
of method in his madness, for soon after his arrival at Botany
Bay, be eluded the espionage of his custodians, and, escaping
to the untrodden interior, was captured and adopted by the
aboriginals whose habits and customs he captured and adopted
in turn.
The tribe, into whose hands Clay fell, was one of the last
to abandon the vice of cannibalism. Not that, like many man-
eating savages, they made raids upon adjacent tribes for sup-
plies, but like unscrupulous Cabinets, they gratified their
passions by aid of political expedients. For instance, when
Death demanded any of their number, they ate the remains in
preference to burying them, an item of funeral simplicity that-
had, at least, both personal economy and sanitary utility in its
favour. Likewise, when individual quarrels had a fatal
ending, the tribe “ waddied ” the survivor, and then ate and
enjoyed the remnants of the two combatants with a relish
which the merits of the quarrel did not in the least degree
impair. Bundarra was chief of a small squad of man-eaters —
a sort of black Battenberg in potentiality. Clay and he
became much attached to one another—a true partnership in
black and white which resulted in the Circassian becoming as
confirmed a cannibal as his sable brother.
Ten years later, Stone, having been detected, during the


days of famine, in robbing the hen-roost at Government House
(poultry-farming being even then a gubernatorial weakness)
escaped to the interior to avoid the probabilities of death on
the scaffold. About the same time the Reverend Lemuel
Lime, prison chaplain, also disappeared, in company with
another runaway convict who had tempted him with the
alluring fiction of a mountain of gold seen by the latter during
the incidents of a former escape.
The reverend gentleman’s disappearance was naturally the
subject of extraordinary comment, mingled with not a little
self-gratulation in the minds of those who hoped he would
never return. He was a miserable-minded ecclesiastical
dwarf, whose admonitions and interference in the treatment of
the exiles gave the lash an impetus from which it is not yet
relieved. He is reported to have remarked about the scaffold
on Gallow’s Hill, on one occasion, that “ six men could hang
there very comfortably, but seven would find it rather
crowded.”
The chaplain’s companion died on the road to the mountain
of gold, and the chaplain himself, who had become gaunt with
grief and haggard with hunger, was retracing his steps when
he suddenly encountered Stone, who had also been many days
without food. It is rather more accurate to say that Stone
encountered him, for the runaway, dreading recapture, crept
up behind the obnoxious chaplain and brained him with a
hastily-improvised “nullah-nullah.” Then he fled from the
| sight of the corpse, but at night, hunger overcame all his
religious scruples, and he returned and attacked the remains
of the reverend dwarf with extreme unction, eating half at
night and the balance next morning.
Here again Nemesis was on Stone’s track with hotter
haste than usual, for the last morsel of the first missionary
had scarcely stuck in the craw of the convict, when a spear,
hurled by Bundarra, simultaneously ended Stone’s gluttony
and his existence.
There being no tribal precedent to determine whether
the corpse belonged exclusively to its captor or should be
treated as a windfall to the credit of the whole tribe, Bun


darra decided the matter in his own favour (as potentates
invariably do) by giving orders to Clay to prepare a fire
and bake the carcass against Bundarra’s return from paying
his attentions to the dusky daughter of a neighbouring chief.
Whether the charm and coquetry of the sable Hebe were
in excess of those displayed by the black-gins of the present
day (of whom not one in a hundred is a Venus in charcoal) I am
unable to say; but the fact remains that Bundarra, forgetting
that his dinner was getting cold, and the piece de resistance
long ago done to a turn, prolonged his love-making till the
shades of evening obscured the day, whereupon he hastily
wended his way back to where he left his Circassian cook
and valet. The latter was asleep beside a slumbering fire,
and the heap of clean-picked bones surrounding him showed
that he had committed a fraud upon his partner by annexing
the latter’s dinner as well as his own. From the placid smile
that adorned his dreamless sleep, it was evident that he had
at last become reconciled to his greatest foe, and that, what-
ever their former dissensions, the latter now agreed with him
very well indeed.
When Bundarra recognised the treachery practised on
him, his countenance became bloated with rage, and stepping
back to give additional zest to the blow, he crashed Clay’s
cranium with the stone-hatchet which he always carried in
his girdle. It goes without saying that, as the surviving
partner and executor, he made out a clear right to be deemed
“the heir of the body.” After eating him unbroiled, the
nigrine epicure repaired to an adjacent cave to sleep off the
effects of the feast; but whether attacked by that apoplexy
which succeeds gluttony, or through the internal discomfiture
which the composite character of the food occasioned, it only
needs to be added that Bundarra fell into a sleep from which
he never wakened.
Even to this day the descendants of the tribe speak in
ominous whispers of the mysterious and simultaneous dis-
appearance of the chief and his white ally, while Bundarra’s
black Dulcinea showed the intensity of her grief by praying
two whole moons for his return, after which she married the


richest of her discarded lovers, to whom she eventually bore
thirteen picaninnies, and died in the full odor of sanctity.
Meanwhile, the concentrated particles of the three mur-
dered, mangled, and masticated men reposed in the skeleton
of the black, Bundarra; and the stalactites and stalagmites
in the cave dripped their incessant calcareous deposit upon
the eccentric combination. Before many years the incorporation
of all the elements was complete, and the molecules of the
four bodies were welded by petrifaction into the fossil form
in which I now appear.
Truth, you thus see, is funnier than fiction, and to convince
you of this I have been careful to omit none of the details of
my development. Superficial critics may speak of the whole
narration as a far-fetched theory; but it is not a theory at
all—it is a scientific fact. Of course there are some who deem
me a little far-fetched myself; and so would you be, reader,
if, like me, you were fetched from the bowels of the earth.

CHAPTER V.
INNOCENT INCIDENTS OF MY INFANCY, INCLUDING MY ADOPTION
BY A CHILDLESS COUPLE.
I AM unable to indicate the whereabouts of the souls o£
the fonr ill-fated fractions of whom I am the surviving
integer, nor can I say with certainty what became of
the bones of three of them. My career of petrifaction began
with the calcareous union of the four bodies, three of which
had been rendered boneless, each by the teeth of his destroyer
and immediate survivor.
Dimly conscious of the awful, though natural, changes
which time and lime were working in my organisation, I lay
in an unbroken trance for generations. I can only estimate
the duration of my sleep by the fact that, when aroused from
this state of torpor, I found the colony of New South Wales
on the eve of celebrating the Centenary of an existence whose
infancy marked the completion of my manufacture and the
beginning of my slumber.
At this era I was rudely aroused from my lethargy, the
operation being accomplished by nothing less sleep-defying
than an explosion. Whether the eruption of the earth’s
surface was in obedience to natural laws or stimulated by
dynamite, I am unable to say. I had bai’ely time to realise!
that the whole hill-side was in the throes of convulsion before
two men extricated me from the surrounding debris , hoisted
me on their shoulders into a tent-covered waggon, and drove
off with me as fast as provincial horseflesh could trot. On
the journey I lay in a dead faint at the bottom of the cart.
When I recovered consciousness, I found myself comfortably
located in a bed of straw in one of the apartments of a country


inn. It was only an ordinary outbuilding, but I had been so
long inured to exposure and privation that I could not have
felt greater contentment had it been a palace.
The injuries I had sustained by the explosion proved, on
examination, to be far from trivial, although on Ihe whole I
escaped better than I expected. My head was environed with
bandages and cross-bandages ; my feet rested against a terrace
of hot bricks ; and my face was generously pitted with powder
pustules. My first experience of returning consciousness
revealed the presence and attentions of an elderly couple, who
were bending over me with almost supernatural anxiety,
and to whom I adjudged myself indebted for the bricks
and bandages.
These people, I afterwards learned, were related to one
another in the capacity of husband and wife, and as they figure
m these memoirs as my foster-parents, I must devote a few
lines to a description of their personal appearance.
The man was a quaint-faced, solemn-visaged man, by name
Pietro Paoli. He was nearly six feet in height, but appeared
of much less stature by reason of a natural rhomboidal addition
to his back, which afflicted him with an awkward and
depressing stoop. His hair was raven black, but his beard
was snowy white, as if claiming to be the elder of the two
hirsute advantages. His nose was the perfection of a purplish-
pmk proboscis, and was as aquiline as his jaw was vulpine.
His leaden eyes, though lustreless, were not without a certain
e mphasis of expression ; his teeth were the color of dead dice,
and his skin wore the bronze hue of sun-shrivelled leather.
&uch a combination of primary colors gave him the appearance
°f a rainbow in flesh and blood.
His wife was the more elderly, but less unique, of the two.
Her face would have been altogether commonplace but for
a marked peculiarity in her dentition; the regularity of
alternation between existent teeth and missing molars was
such as to convey the impression that she had only one row
teeth. So exactly did each upper tooth fit each under
vacancy, and vice versa, that it seemed unnatural to expect her
amuth to open, a virtuous assumption of unwomanliness which


the testimony of her husband could always be relied on to
disprove.
They remained for some moments staring at me in silence,
which was broken at length by the woman saying, in a subdued
tone, “ Who is it ? What is it ? ”
“ Hist ! ” responded the man, placing over his lips a finger
whose virgin cleanliness had succumbed to cigarette juice ;j
then advancing to the door he peered nervously outside, and
having satisfied himself that no one was within earshot,
he closed it and said to his wife, in a dramatic whisper,
“Sybarita! you have often worried me about the childless;
character of your life. Weep no longer, caro sposa; I have;
brought a poor motherless infant to you for adoption.”
“Mercy me, Pietro!” responded the woman, half-enchanted,
half-alarmed, “he seems a big child for his age. Has he been;
weaned yet ? ”
“ Yes —ages ago, I suspect. He is a poor foundling whom
it was my good fortune to discover on the hillside, where his
unnatural parents had left him to starve or rot, for all they!
cared. Be a mother to the urchin, and, perhaps, when wd
get too old to work, we may look to him to provide the
maintenance of our declining days.”
“ Poor little brat! ” rejoined the dame, dropping on my
eyebrow a crocodilian tear that might have scalded all the
hair off it; “have you any suspicion who his mother is?
There’s the banker’s daughter, who has of late exhibited
unmaidenly ungracefulness, and who, I know,
“ Malediction on the woman,” exclaimed Pietro, “ you arej
many milestones out in your suspicions. This child is not'
the fruit of commerce. He is no ordinary offspring, but his
parents are as great an object of mystery as Jo-Jo’s mother.” |
“ Well, don’t get annoyed, Pietro. I ’ll do my best to make!
up to the brat for the natural protection he has lost; ” and
she accented her good resolutions by throwing her arms]
around my neck and ardently squeezing me to her bosom.!
Such a display of the warmth of her affection met with no
response from me, for I had conceived an antipathy to my
foster-mother from the first, which perhaps accounted for hei’


ever afterwards describing me to the neighbours as cold,
ungrateful and heartless.
Amidst a mutual display of facetiousness and fuss, coupled
with what appeared to me to savour of patriarchal “billing and
cooing,” the worthy pair continued to fondle and caress me
until the small hours of the morning, and took turns at holding
me on their knees the better to examine my figure in all its
lights and shadows. During this time I was the object of
many practical exhibitions of their tender solicitude. At one
| time they would playfully tap me a few times on the nose;
j then they would vary the performance by administering gentle
cuts on the legs, concluding by hysterically hammering me on
the head. After this they gave me a steaming hot bath, and
scrubbed and scoured me till I shone like an Ethiopian
! exquisite. I have been the victim of an average share of
! ablutions since, but never shall I forget the industrial vigour
I which characterised my first bath.
“He looks a heap better now,” said my foster-mother
I exultingly, to which remark Pietro responded with a sly
E chuckle, accompanied, with an observation that I was “ an old-
fashioned oddity, but none the worse for that.”
“As for the abrasions and bruises which disfigure his
I body,” he continued, “I have a secret lotion which will work
I on them like a charm,” and suiting the action to the word, he
drew a Brobdignagian phial out of a packing-case and
I ril bbed the liquid contents into me with a muscular vim which
| suffused his own countenance —internally with blood and exter-
nally with perspiration. The lotion must have been a strong
specific, for it stained and burnt his fingers during the appli-
cation, while as for me, it fairly ate its way into my integu-
ments, and left my body more raw and sore than before.
Eor many succeeding days I kept my bed, and notwith-
| Ending nay daily bath and Pietro’s assiduous application of
I the lotion, my condition reached at length so critical a stage
: that Pietro decided to call in the local physician. In answer
I to his wife’s inquiry why he had not invited the latter s opinion
earlier, he slowly closed one of his lack-lustre eyes and
muttered that he would have liked to, but that lie didn t


believe in doctors in general, and couldn’t make up his mind
how far to trust this particular disciple of the healing art.
The medical man, thus summoned, bore the reputation ofj
being a clever practitioner, too straightgoing to delude hisj
patients as to their actual condition ; and was neither so!
oleaginous nor so omniscient as the general run of rural
medicos. He ran an analytical eye over me, probed one or two!
of my protuberances, sniffed incredulously, and then said, with;
an accompanying wave of the hand (as if deprecating - and!
defying any counter-diagnosis) “ I can be of no assistance!
whatever, my good man. The proper place for that ” pointing!
to me, “is the local churchyard.”
“ Holy St. Thomas ! ” shrieked my foster-father, as if whatj
he was about to say was manifest enough to risk an appeal tew
the most sceptical saint in the calendar, “do you mean to sayl
that it is cold clay already P ”
“ The rigor mortis is too apparent,” answered the doctor,!
“ to deceive any medical man with even a rudimentary know-1
ledge of his profession,” and with this he rudely pushed aside!
Pietro’s hand, conveying the offer of a liberal fee, and
out in a state of professional wrath that to me appeared?
unwarranted by the circumstances.
Pietro, though rather more crestfallen than he cared to!
show, was evidently averse to adopting the pessimistic view!
suggested by the doctor’s diagnosis, for after mechanically!
raising and lowering the rhomboidal addendum to his back, hel
made a cigarette, lighted it, swept his eyes over me in swiftj
survey of my condition, and, turning to Sybarita, hissed his
sentiments through the little spasmodic puffs of smoke.
“ Poof ! ” said he, “ that fellow’s a quack, and I always
thought so. The foundling’s worth forty dead ’uns to me yet,l
or living ones either, for that matter. One swallow does notf
make a summer, and this pragmatic physician is only a pro-1
fessional unit, after all.”
Next day, determined to seek the best professional advice
in the colony, he brought me to Sydney, leaving Sybarita at
home in a state of hysterical hopelessness and addled alariflH
Evidently he feared the worst, disguise his sentiments as he


might, for he had me conveyed by rail in a close box in which
I looked for all the world like a coffined corpse all ready for
the last emergency.
As good fortune willed it, he soon discovered a couple of
city practitioners whose diagnoses delighted him ; for, after
subjecting me to a thorough overhaul, they declared that I
had all the appearance of a well-developed, well-preserved,
specimen of the genus homo, needing only careful handling and
skilful treatment to assure me a prolonged and prosperous
career. They advised recourse to a gay life for me, assuring
my guardian that the more fresh faces I saw every day, the
better for my prospects of success.
In such skilled and scientific hands it is small wonder that
I grew in virility, public estimation, and marble manhood day
by day.


CHAPTER VI.
I ENCOUNTER ANOTHER PETRIFIED PHILOSOPHER, AND IN THE
COURSE OF CONVERSATION CATCH A CLUE TO ML
PARENTAGE.
7\ S soon as I became convalescent, the medical men urged
the necessity of immediate outdoor exercise, advising
that I be taken about a good deal in order to improve
my locus standi; and so Pietro, adopting their suggestion, took
me for an occasional ramble round the city and suburbs. As
I was not yet able to walk alone, I was indulged with a seat
in a species of perambulator, which plebeian people are
addicted to calling a wheelbarrow. On one of these occasions
an incident befell me from which I gathered considerable
encouragement, as opening my eyes to the fact that, however
singular my adamantine anatomy, I was not the only Marble
Man in the world.
It was a balmy evening in spring, and the spirit of slumber,
evoked by the climatic drowsiness, was accentuated by the
undulating motion of my bucolic brougham—a zigzagy way-
wardness which inevitably characterised our peregrinations
whenever my step-father became unusually elevated, as he
frequently did of late—l suppose, at the apparent advance
of our mutual prospects. I remember falling asleep, and
finding, on waking up, that Pietro had deserted his post; as I
subsequently ascertained, he was improving his acquaintance
with the innkeepers of the classic neighbourhood of wicked
W oolloomooloo.
As the reader will infer, it was by no means a novel
sensation for me to experience an utter sense of loneliness;
but of late I had grown so accustomed to the society of my
attendants, that my heart sank as I realised that grey dusk
was setting in fast, and I was alone in the centre of a dismal
park. As the chilling sensation of solitude increased, I peered


through, the dusk in vain pursuit of a familiar face, until
[at last the very marrow in my bones sustained an icy shock
*by the discovery which came to me when, glancing ovexhead,
I actually beheld —another petrified man !
At the first blush I endeavoured to convince myself that
!my eyes were having a jest with me—in fact, playiug me a
trick such as is often experienced at sea in the ocular and
j jocular illusion of a mirage ; but the harder I stared, the more
£ perspicuous appeared the phenomenon, until I was forced at
! last to admit that there stood in front of me a being who,
in all material points, might have been a replica of myself,
j I had heard of the devilry of doubles and the witchcraft
lof wraiths, but this theory was discounted by the fact that
iin immaterial points the figure befoi*e me exhibited differences
of detail. For example, he was undoubtedly a
f built and more comely personage than I could claim to be,
i for his limbs were well-proportioned and better fashioned than
I mine, and he was attired in such superior vestments that his
presence occasioned me almost as much mortification as
j surprise.
When I first observed him, he was standing upon a high
j pedestal, and, looking neither to the right hand noi’ to the
1 left, had his eyes intently fixed upon the entrance to “ our
I beautiful harbour.” In his hand he held an opera-glass,
I which, I have since learned, is an optical instrument invented
j for the double-barrelled service of the sea and the stage.
I After a time my curiosity got the upper hand of my
j humiliation, and I determined to accost him.
A breezy evening, sir,” said I.
“ Doff your cap, and stand at attention,” he l’oared; “in
I day we’d have holystoned the decks with a lubber like
I you.”
I Orestfallen at my reception, I remained silent for a space;
I tut seeing the severity of his features relax, I said, “ What’s
| your name, if I may make so bold P ”
Oh, no offence,” he replied, with unexpected suavity;
My name’s Jem—plain Jem Cook among familiars.”
“ Great Caesar ! ” I exclaimed, “ surely not the illustrious


navigator whom it is customary to sandwich between Don
Pedro Fernandez de Quiros and La Perouse ! ”
“ The same,” said he, “or at all events what is left of mel
since I was killed by the Otaheite savages. The warrior
that skewered me did me the further honor to eat me, but
I disagreed with him more than his gluttonous soul contem-j
plated. I had barely time to calculate the latitude and
longitude of my anchorage in his stomach before he went asj
mad as a Malay, and steered off at full speed to the mountains,;
where contrary winds heaved him into the heart of an
active volcano. When we were discovered, after the lapse*
of many years, the lava had moulded us into the one material,
and it was a heavy undertaking for scientific men to say!
whether I had merged into the nigger, or the cannibal had
become engrossed in Captain Cook.”
“ But you are the famous mariner, are you not p” I
enquired.
“I believe so,” was his answer. “Fortunately, the black
gourmand had the instinct to swallow my telescope without!
noticing any material increase in the toughness of his repast ;
and here you see it as found by my side; but a stronger item!
of identification was afforded by a bunion on my left foot,
so peculiar in its anatomical vagrancy that it could neither!
be counterfeited nor digested, nor yet erased by eruption.”
“ Where do you live ? ” I proceeded to enquire.
“ Why here, of course,” he made answer. “ This pedestal!
is my post-mortem quarter-deck, and I am devoting myi
eternity to watching for the first appearance of the Chinese
fleet.”
Observing a look of wonderment on my face, he continued—
“ When I discovered this continent, I took possession of it in
the name and in the interests of the British people, and I need
to keep a sharp look-out to prevent it passing into the hands
of an inferior race.”
“ Do you think John Chinaman has any show of ousting,
John Ball ? ” I asked.
“ All I can say is that John Bull’s descendants arl
greasing the plank of Asiatic acquisition. This continent is a


Paradise to China’s million starvelings, and, foreseeing this,
our statesmen should have closed every colonial port against
Chinese immigrants. But instead of ejecting every Mongol
mongrel neck and crop, they are encouraged to run away with
Australian gold, and leave the colonists Asiatic diseases by
way of unequal barter. Until the last Chinese hoof disappeais
from this territory, there is always the danger that China,
emboldened by our supineness, will lay pagan hands upon this
continent.”
“ Free Trade, my ancient mariner,” I ventured to explain.
Free devils,” he retorted; “ Free Trade is right enough till
it gets too d free, as in this case. The capitalist gives
the Hindoo, the Malay, and the Mongol perfect freedom to ruin
j the white-faced artisan in the latter’s only avenue of existence ;
but, to be consistent, he should give these inferior races the
freedom of his personal hospitality, as well as freedom to wed
bis offspring and sit in brotherhood at his councils. But so
long as the competition is confined to crushing the corns of the
labouring classes, the patrician legislator tolerates the presence
of the pagan; because, in the conflict between Labour and
Capital, that same pagan is the latter’s mute, mechanical ally
9- sort of leprous lever which he can make use of to overturn
<dl Labour’s organisations. A man must be very far petrified
w ho fails to see that.”
“ You reason too profoundly for my political philosophy,”
I answered, “ and so we will quit that theme. But tell me,
• are you perfectly contented with your station P ”
“Not exactly,” he replied, “ I should prefer a billet as a
member of the Marine Board. I think I could infuse a little
life into those ‘ most potent, grave and reverend seigniors ’ ;
Imt successive Premiers have rejected my nomination on the
grounds of my youth and inexperience ; generously counselling
me to renew my application next Centenary.”
As if regarding his rejection in the light of a slight,
m y replica resumed his habitual pensiveness ; then rousing
rmself, he asked me for my card.
“ Alas, kind captain,” said I, “ I have none, for I have
never been baptised.”


“ Blast the fellow,” he interrupted (a favorite imprecation,
by the way, among- mariners and marble men) ; “if you have
no name by baptism, you have one by inheritance from
your parents.”
“I have no parents,” I replied—“at least, none that I
know of. My guardian says my birth must remain unregistered
because, like Topsy, ‘ I growed.’ ”
At that moment a delicious and delirious suspicion shot
athwart the bows of my intelligence, which I hastened to
express by saying, “ Perhaps you’re my father ! If you are,
for pity’s sake, end this mystery by a well-timed confession.” 1
“Me!” he roared; “ well, that’s the best joke I’ve heard
for many a year. I am accustomed to being alluded to as
a £ sad sea-dog ’, but damme, sir, I never went quite so far as
that. It would be worse than seducing a mermaid. Besides,
I’m a bachelor, and as free from gallantry as lam from gout.”
There was an air of convincing candour in his denial, and
I was about to turn away to conceal my disappointment and
my tears, when the captain added, “ Come, cheer up, young ’uni
You go to the end of the park, and put the question to another
of our race, whom you will find there, and who —now I think
of it —is the founder of just such a thick-headed lot as could
include you in its ranks without any disparagement to
its family virtues.”
“What!” I exclaimed, “ are there more of us in theses
parts ? ”
“Of course there are. You do as I tell you, and cross-
question the bald-headed old gentleman who is stationed at
the park-gate, wasting his eternity in ogling all the frisky
damsels and risky dames who parade that thoroughfare. I
kou 11 find him standing on a pedestal like mine, but don’t
mention my name to him, for we haven’t exchanged a word
since I came here. He is sensitive about the courtesies due
to his rank and dignity, and resents my presence as a public
trespass and a personal insult.”
Just then, our colloquy was ended by the appearance of
Pietro, looking little less petrified than I was. Abruptly
starting my unicycle on its wild career, he broke even time


for a fair proportion of the homeward journey ; but becoming
,'fatigued, he halted the vehicle and shared my berth for some
| hours, so that it was midnight when we returned to our
[lodgings; and, overcome by the dual effects of weariness and
[excitement, I was soon sleeping the sleep of the righteous
i and the rigid.


CHAPTER VII.
I VAINLY SEEK MY Pa AND Ma IN THE RIGID RANKS OF ROYALTY.
THE reader can better picture, than I can pen, the thrill
of expectancy which I felt on the morrow, when my
guardian aroused me at daybreak to say “ Here, hurry'
up, Sandy, and let me equip you in your regimentals, foi
I want to be off to Hyde Park before the crowd gathers. Thil
is our Centennial Celebration, and you shall witness the
ceremony of unveiling a statue.”
I was ignorant then what a statue was, or in what respect*
unveiling differed from “ taking the veil,” but I gatherel
sufficient gratification at the prospect afforded me of bringing
to a successful issue my Japhetlike exploration in search ol
a father.
The ancient mariner had not deceived me as to the latitude
and longitude of the locus in quo , for precisely at the spot
he had indicated on the previous evening stood another
member of our race —one, too, who, in personal polish and
graceful attitude, was as superior to Captain Cook as thJ
latter was to my own clumsily-formed, ill-complexioned self.
I felt something akin to filial pride glow within my flintyl
bosom, as my lips almost involuntarily emitted the magiJ
word “ Father.”
My kinsman—in appearance, if not in reality—stareJ
stupidly in my face, and muttered, “Eh, whatP Another one!”
“ Are you not my father ? ” I enquired, realising thej
sagacity of the sentiment that
“ He either fears his fate too much,
Or his deserts are small,
Who dares not put it to the touch,
And win or lose it all.”
“ May I be pulverised if I can tell you,” was his flippantf
reply. “ I admit I led a good old uxorious life while it lasted,


and I left quite a quiverful of hostages to fortune; but,
hang me, if I am prepared to identify you.”
“Don’t be too positive in your negative,” I proceeded,
“ much depends upon your answer.”
“ That may be,” he rejoined, “ and I own that there is
just the least trifle of a family likeness between you and
Albert Edward, and your skull appears the duplication of
|Alfred’s; but, in the absence of stronger corroboration of
[your claim, I am afraid you must remain disowned, as far as
; I am concerned.”
“At least, kind sir,” I pleaded, “ inform me what is your
rank and station that I may pursue my investigations further,
I if I so desire.”
“ Oh, as to that,” said he, “ every one knows me about
these parts. I have forgotten my actual surname, but lam
familiarly known under the sobriquet of ‘ Albert the Good.’
“Why so ? ” I enquired, with not a little prompting of
personal pride.
“ Blessed if I know,” he rejoined, “ unless because I never
any good; we are at the antipodes now, you know, where
I everything European is reversed.”
“ What are you doing where you are now ? ”
1“ Doing nothing—except sheltering and counselling the
unemployed when they meditate a fresh raid on the State
coffers.”
‘ But why do you disown me; is there no possibility of
Proving myself of royal origin ? ”
“ Book here, my good fellow,” he replied; “it is infinitely
better to get yourself grouped in any section other than the
j r °yal or semi-royal classes; my descendants have the repu-
tation of doing very little to attract either the admiration or
j approbation of humanity. There are too many of them, as
is, for the comfort of the British workman.”
WaS a^ t° interrogate him further, but he reared
imself a little more stiffly on his royal roost, and said, “ Don’t
Worr y Ine any further, for lam out of sorts to-day. My wife
arrived by steamer last night, and intends to take up her
quarters where she can command an indirect view of my


movements. I’m none too happy at the prospect, for I knowj
by past experience, the tight rein she is likely to exercis(
over me. All the pretty girls will pass me by with a pityini
grin, and my old friends —the unemployed —will desert na
in a body, and go to her for future counsel. She can advisi
them, even better than I can, how best to Jeremy-Diddk
the taxpayers.”
With this —perhaps his final attempt at marital supremacy
of speech —he ceased speaking, and left me in a state of doubt
expectancy, and confusion, that was pitiable to witness. The
disclosure that I was soon to set eyes, for the first time, on 8
female member of our race, unlawfully set fire to my imagina
tion; and when I reflected that perhaps the newcomer stoot
to me in the saintly relation of mother, my impatience reachel
the dignity of a delirium.
Just then I heard the stirring strains of martial musicj
I saw throngs of sane men and refined women bending theii
awe-stricken heads like heathen Hindoos at the Juggernautl
I saw a figure fleeced in spotless white, and noted how hones!
men and healthy women held their breath while the figurj
was disrobed of its outer drapery; I saw statesmen, and
professors of all the sciences, prostrate themselves in hallowed
homage before the new petrifaction; I saw vicars and vaga'
bonds, curates and churchwardens, prelates and paupers-H
frothing at the lips in reverent adulation of the Marble
WOMAN ; and far away to the rear I heard Captain Cook, on his
pedestal, muttering —“ Thou shalt not worship any graven
image ! ”
Some hours afterwards the spot was deserted, except for
the presence of myself and my guardian, and a few tawdrily
attired women, whom I at first mistook for Her Majesty’s
maids of honor, but who quickly undeceived me as to that
section of my loyal belief.
Pietro had been mingling freely with the crowd during the
day, and, as a consequence, he lost no time in wheeling the
barrow to the foot of the throne, where he stretched himself
out for a long recuperative nap.
Availing myself of so exemplary an opportunity, I tugged


Way at the skirts of the marble dame, and howled “ Mamma ”
to such sonorous variety of accents as to include, by turns,
die whole gamut of sounds.
| Alas! for the icy imperiousness of court etiquette ! I failed
(jo induce the petrified lady to utter a single word of response ;
Ind rightly reasoning that muteness belied maternity, I
ioncluded that my arrogant assumption of royal descent had
buffered the extreme penalty of disillusion.

CHAPTER VIII.
I SOLICIT A CONFESSION OF MATERNITY FROM A MUMMY, WH[?]
DENIES "THE SOFT IMPEACHMENT."
WHEN” I awoke next day, I felt a strong sense of mental
disconragement at my failure to establish my claii<
to be regarded as a weed in the Royal nursery ; ad
on my foster-father expressing his concern at the manifest
change in my appearance, I resolved to unburden my mind Oc
its troubles by taking him fully into my confidence. I
This I did by narrating to him my adventures of the tvi
preceding days, at the details of which he laughed so heartil
that I feared he would end the gluttony of his glee by a]
attack of apoplexy. After scratching his chin, as if extractiii
no small measure of enlightenment from his epidermis, lr
said :
“ I confess your origin has been a puzzle to me from th
first, and although I have no desire to restore you to you]
unnatural parents, I should feel more at ease if the mystery d
your identity were known, at least, to our two selves.”
“ I am sure,” I hastened to say, “ that my parents, if evfil
we discover them, would not seek to tear me from you.”
“ I ’ve no fears on that score,” he explained, “ and I think
in our investigations, we had better follow the maxim of tin
French police —First find the woman. But how or where ? is]
I own, the rub ; unless, as now suddenly strikes me, you<
I
mammy
“ Yes ! what of her ? ” I eagerly inquired.
“ Is a Mummy,” he replied.
Leaving me to digest this unexpected revelation as best 1
might, Pietro walked hastily out, and presently returned wit*
a cab, in which we were soon merrily whirling along. Whe|«
the vehicle halted, my guardian stepped out briskly and, afte 15


looking around him, suddenly turned to the cabman and, with
Lome display of anger, inquired what he meant by dropping us
fit the gates of Parliament House.
“ Durn your gory old soul, you all-fired jackass,” retorted
jthe cabman, “ didn’t you say to drive you straight to the
Museum where the Mummies were kept ? If this isn’t the
[place in question, where in thunder are it ? ”
Pietro, cursing the whole race of cabmen for a choice
collection of well-developed fools, gave fresh and specific
instructions, locating the Museum in College-street as our
•original destination.
f Very soon we entered the murky edifice where so many
'anatomical absurdities are held in barren bondage; and I
t 1 confess that, as I recognised quite a proportion of familiar
maces, I shuddered to think that the future might relegate me
o end my days in this gloomy prison, perhaps as a cell-mate of
he Cheirotherium, a page to the Plesiosaurus, “ hoots ” to the
jllrachiopods, or a lacquey to the Labyrynthodon.
After nodding familiarly to the Moa, and shaking hands
|with the Mastodon—playmates of my youthful days when
“ I dwelt in marble halls,
With vassals and serfs at my side ”
I underwent the ceremony of a formal introduction to the only
ffemale Mummy with which the establishment is embellished.
I The lady in question was rather of the brunette than the
1 3 on de type of beauty. Her face, though relieved of the fire
<J f' youth, exhibited all the comeliness and graces of a serene
Jold age; it was comparatively free from wrinkles, and could
F>ot be said to owe any virginal freshness to paints, powders or
•pomatums. She took rather more care to conceal her personal
t arrQS than is considered fashionable among the fair sex, for
j" er was simplicity itself, consisting only of a nocturnal
flapper wound in skilful and multiple folds around her
| a S r ant person; and neither stays, crinolines, flounces, nor
panprovers were invoked to puff or pad any of nature's short-
ly mgs. I n short, however giddy may have been the inclina-
i.mns °f her youth, her whole appearance now emitted an
| ense °Tour °f respectability more than qualified to chill all


unseemly or improper advances. When she smiled —as shj
frequently did —she displayed two pearly rows of artificjl
teeth which, it appears, she was forced to wear by direction c
the Curators of the Museum, who thus hope to keep her i|y
touch with the artful advances of an artificial civilization.
many virtues were modified by only one apparent vice—tlj
wonderfully well-preserved old dame was an inveterate snul
taker, a sin which she excused by pleading the prevalence k
moths.
The ceremony of introduction ended, the lady smiling*
apologised for her recumbent attitude, explaining that she Wt
too advanced in years to sit up without assistance.
“ Why, how old are you, ma’am F ” I inquired.
“ Young man,” she replied, s “ spare my blushes. Where at
your manners to ask such an impertinent question of a lady
But there,” she sarcastically added,” I supppose these are nin<o
teenth-century amendments on the customs in vogue in n
day.” i
I blushed at her sneer at my comparative lack both I
manners and antiquity, and hastened to assure her that, lili
herself, I belonged to the age of chivalry that is dead an*
buried.
Considerably mollified, she proceeded to say, “ Whatevfi
my age, I flatter myself few young widows carry their years I
well. Not but that I might have exchanged my widow’s wee#
for a bridal sceptre any time these last three thousand yeaft
either in Egypt or Australia, and without committing an*
greater anachronism than did my friend and schoolfellow, tt
Baroness B C ! But lam proud, young man, to ad
that I have remained ever true to the memory of my onf
husband, poor old Potiphar, captain of the king’s household.”!
“ Oh, lor ! ” I gasped, “ are you really Mrs. Potiphar, til
heroine of the esclanderie in which modest Joseph earned!
martyr’s reputation F ”
“Ugh! Do you tell me,” said she, “that that scandal h® 1
penetrated to the ears of the people of this remote dominion'
I thought it was forgotten long ago, and that Charley Dißj
and Lady Colin C had deposed it from its polygamol


Well. Poor Joe ! lam afraid there are not many of his sort
a .n the Australian colonies.”
0 “No, indeed,” interjected my foster-father, “there are more
'Mrs. Potiphars than Josephs in this part of the world; ” and
; he proceeded to vehemently chuckle, as if he had said a
good thing —ignorant the while that Mrs. P. was
Regarding him with a vindictive pair of evergreen eyes in
Resentment of his satiric facetiousness.
Anxious to change the character of their conversation, I
inquired whether she knew many of the great people in
jPgypt.
“I know all the Biblical bon-ton and all the historic elite”
she replied, “ and my roll of personal acquaintances extends
from the first Pharaoh down to Arabi Bey.”
“ Did you know the Pharaoh that travelled to the bottom
the Red Sea ? ” asked Pietro.
( “ Speak low,” murmured the lady, “heis in the next room,
an as high a state of preservation as I am.”
“ J ee-rusalem ! ” exclaimed my guardian; and Mrs. P.,
Ignoring his note of antiquarian astonishment, continued:
The true history of Pharaoh’s litigation with the Children of
{lsrael has never been written. As a matter of fact, their
jpmanimous refusal to renew his promissory notes was the secret
iof their pilgrimage to the ‘Promised’ Land, which, yon will
pnderstand, had been mortgaged to them by Pharaoh as
■security for advances on the usual terms, and of which they
(simply took possession by default.”
“Well, but how about the ten plagues P ” enquired Pietro.
1 “By the light of modern intelligence, they are only so
Imany ordinary incidents. The plague of frogs, for example,
l' Vvas 110 thing more than an influx of French reeidivistes”
“ the locusts ? ”
I _ Were Egyptian lawyers, who multiplied and replenished
ff! 1 . su ch rapidity that Pharaoh nicknamed them ‘the
F wteenth tribe of Israel.’ It is needless to explain that they
(devoured everything devourable.”
I . n this strain the antediluvian Mrs. Langtry entertained us
I 1 promiscuous scraps of history and legend pertaining


to ancient days, much to the delectation of my foster-fathei
who would have willingly lent his ears to such discourse a
long as the lady’s tongue should endure. As, however, thi
conversation had no apparent hearing on my parentage, I
resolved upon solving my doubts by putting a leading question
and accordingly enquired of Mrs. P. whether, by any stretch o
antique imagination, she could recognise in me a son and heir.i
To my disgust, though not at all to my surprise, sq
scouted the suggestion, and spitefully insinuating that I wal
the posthumous son of a mermaid, she closed the interestin
colloquy with a sigh; and my errand to the mermaid beinj,
just as resultless, I prepared to quit the Museum.
In passing through the great hall, I unluckily trod on th
digits of the Diphrotydon, who winced so acutely that tin
great sea-serpent laughed himself into a fit of anguineoir
apoplexy, at which all the mermaids sighed in submarid
sympathy, while the zoophytes simpered in semi-zoologic zest.


CHAPTER IX.
OF THE MELANCHOLY MISCHANCE WHICH SECURED MY ADMISSION
INTO THE LOCKUP AND THE MORGUE.
I 7\ ETER the depressing incidents narrated in the last
[A chapter, I concluded to let the proof of my parentage
go by default, a resolution which Pietro was himself
sufficiently crestfallen to applaud. Por the next few weeks
rwe led a jog-trot existence, into which neither incident nor
excitement effected an entrance; and this, as far as I was
concerned, was as good as a sea-voyage in bracing up my
; nerves and giving tone to my stomachic vigor.
On my foster-father the monotony, I was sorry to see, had
a very different effect, as causing him to seek relief in the
giddy whirl of that gaiety in which grog affords all the
; enlivening essentials. Indeed, his addiction to alcohol was
[fast assuming the form of intense idolatry, and the deepening
i hne of his purple proboscis was everywhere recognised as the
outward badge of his inward servitude.
In order to indulge in uninterrupted intercourse with the
potent liquors, whose distilled damnations “ charmed him never
: s ° wisely,” he adopted the precaution to fit up a corner of
barrow as a receptacle for the flasks, bottles, and demi-
johns, which now became as essential to our peregrinations
as a special class of comb is to the personal outfit of a police-
court reporter—so much so, that I grew ashamed of the strong
spirituous stench with which the atmosphere of my rustic
andau was sensibly saturated, and blushed vividly when
'Well-meaning, but mistaken, missionaries thrust temperance
tracts into my hands, and Domain Evangelists exhorted
1 1Ile to beware of a drunkard’s grave.
I I now suffered a good deal from the pangs of solitude,
| 0r j except during the intervals necessary to allow the fumes


of the liquor an opportunity to evaporate, my foster-fa the
did not permit me to share much of his society; and h
curtailed our “ walks abroad ” in order the longer to enjo
the convivial companionship of kindred habitues of the poi
house. Add to this, that the propriety of our perambulation
was now frequently upset by his unreliable efforts.to balancjj
the barrow when he was too unsteady to balance himself.
On one of these occasions—when I regret to say Pietro’i
ebriety was at a very emphatic ebb—we were rudely accostet
by a vigilant and vindictive member of the police force
Policeman XXX 666 (that was the number of the Beast) wai
a perfect Bonaparte in bluchers, whose enervated energies
found appropriate vent in dodging burglars and belting
Bacchanalians. In connection with the latter capacity hii
bludgeon had seen active service, having for some years pasl
bestowed sounding raps and gaping wounds indiscriminate!)
and impartially upon septuagenarian swipers, inoffensive China
men, juvenile hoodlums, and toothless old witches of ninety
nine.
“ Move on ! ” he thundered into the ears of Pietro, ai
injunction which served to- increase the latter’s activity
without, however, abating his erraticism of movement.
Then, as if recognising the immediate necessity of counter
manding the first order, the policeman roared “ Halt !be you
a burglar? ”
To this mild averment of an enrolment in the extensive
brotherhood of the knights of the crowbar and chisel, ml
guardian grunted an indistinct denial; and the policemafl
continued: “ I knows better, my lad, and so I just warns you.
Three times I’ve had a blooming dream about meeting a
burglar just here, and I identifies you as the cove what
figured in them dreams. So take a fool’s advice —be off peace\
ably about your business , or I ’ll have your heart’s blood.”
However much Pietro’s intentions may have leaned cof
compliance, he was insufficiently master of himself to render
literal obedience to the law. The grog in his stomach and
the energy in his constitution had undertaken a final bout
for the supremacy, and just at the moment when the policeman


j counselled his speedy emigration, the grog achieved a knock-
out, and Pietro fell to the barrow, face foremost. He had
sufficient sense and activity in his final struggle to
wriggle far enough into the barrow to shield himself under
me—a tactical manoeuvre which XXX 666 did not sufficiently
observe, or he would scarcely have acted as he subsequently
did : for, after drawing his fingers over the baton as if it were
a cat-o’-nine-tails itching to scratch a convict’s hide, he brought
it down with a sickening crash —not upon the head of Pietro,
but upon my own unoffending skull.
Xow, as I have before observed, my skull is naturally
of a diplomatic degree of density, and whatever brain I may
chance to possess is environed by an unusually callous cuticle ;
so that it was by no means a miracle that the descending
bludgeon broke into myriads of splinters. On the policeman,
however, the unexpected occurrence fell with all the force
°f a phenomenon, for he staggered back in as perfect a
condition of stupefaction as if he had been the recipient of
the blow instead of the donor of the benefaction.
After apostrophising his splintered bludgeon in terms
which showed how pathetically he regarded this climax to
its roll of brilliant victories, he sat himself helplessly down
°n the kerb way, and diversified spells of weeping by snatches
reflection. What was the nature of his thoughts may be
inferred by the frequent recurrence of such sentient spasms
as H knowed it”; “them dreams”; “drat all burglars ;
an< i many more remarks of a like significance.
So long a period did he sit, with downcast eyes, in
to mourning and meditation, that he did not observe
ijm subsequent movements of my foster-father, upon whom
le °blique echo of the blow had a slightly stirring effect.
l( s an immediate sequel of this revival, Pietro ejected all
ead marines” from the barrow, and, after annexing the
80 e surviving flask, “ stood not upon the order of going,” but
“ Folding his ‘ duds,’ like the Arabs,
rr,. As silently stole away.”
at is to say, as silently and swiftly as semi-steady legs
o<mlcl carry him.


A few minutes after Pietro made his unceremonious exit.
XXX 666 timidly approached, peered into the harrow to see
that my senseless condition was not assumed, and straightway
discharged at my unoffending head the full cargo of resentful
reproaches with which his sorrowful soul was loaded.
“ Dog of a bleeding burglar ! ” said he, “ you’re there, yet,
Them dreams have not deceived me, and my promotion is as
good as blooming well got. For all that, I ’ll make it extra
hot for you for the loss of my baton. Poor beggar! ”
(with another tearful glance at the splinters) “ You fell in
fair fight, and you ’ll he terribly avenged. Out of respect to
your memory, the charges shall be multiplied, not squared—!
drunkenness to start on; riotous conduct and obscene language
as well ; indecent exposure and vagrancy ; sacrilege and
burglary ; unnatural offences ; tearing a policeman’s uniform;
and, to crown all, executing me in the assault of my duty
By these relics of my faithful comrade ” (reverentially
gathering the splinters) “ I swear to fit this prisoner for
a trip to the other world. I ’ll arrange that he and Xosey
shall take an early morning walk very shortly; and, myl
sanguinary nightmare, you—will—never—return.”
Hysterically hissing the concluding portion of the fulmination
through his tobacco-stained teeth, he proceeded to wheel me
off to the lock-up, halting but once on the way —to re-inspect
the sacred splinters and renew the oath of vengeance.
Arrived at the watchhouse —which is to the penitentiary!
just such a prologue as a Muscovite University is to the
Salt Mines of Siberia—we had to wait a few minutes for the
lock-up keeper. That worthy dignitary had, it appeared,
gone on duty to the nearest hotel to ascertain whether it was
closed or open during prohibited hours; —an item of information
of such official importance as to impel him to arouse the
landlord, gain a stealthy entrance by a remote avenue,
follow the host on tip-toe into a dimly-lighted parlor, and
hurriedly return with sunny smiles around his lips, and
glistening dew-drops on his beard—conclusive evidence that
his official expedition had not been resultless.
“ Ah, what have we here ? ” he enquired of XXX 666.


“ My nightmare, sergeant,” replied the subordinate.
“Your grandmother,” rejoined the superior officer with
a mixture of a smile and a sneer; “What the d 1 do you
[mean, man ? ”
“ I mean that I can identify him as the ringleader in
them dreams I told you about; he s the fellow what sat on
|my chest. Anri look here —you know how much Dick Turping
valued his Black Bess ? ”
“Yes, man ; that’s a matter of police history.
“Well” (exhibiting the consecrated crumbs of his baton),
i“ I feels just as how I’m Dick Turping, and here are the bones
o’ my bonny Black Bess.”
“ Bosh, man ! ” said the sergeant, “it’s Black Maria you’ve
more need to be thinking of ; you ’re evidently a shingle short.
“ No, a whole baton.”
“Well, here, help haul this fellow in, and we’ll concoct
the charge afterwards.”
And so the two constables, sweating and swearing at my
weight, conveyed me into a cell and lowered me on the floor
with a gentleness which duly tested the solidity of my skull.
Next morning, the sergeant took a look at me by daylight,
an d exclaiming, “By all the Saints, the fellow’s dead,” he
had me removed to the Morgue in readiness for a coroner’s
inquest.
Of the incidents and details of the inquiry before the
coroner, I have here a short-hand report, furnished me by
ihe Law Reporters of the Mourning Herald, and confirmed by
m y own personal recollections thereof.


CHAPTER X.
IN WHICH THE INQUEST IS INITIATED, AND THE TESTIMONY
THE POLICE IS WONDERFULLY LIKE POLICE TESTIMONY.
ON March 19th, the City Coroner (so runs the report)
commenced an inquest on the dead body of a man
(name unknown) found dead the day before in a cel} '
in the city lockup, where he had been confined on the previous
night. An elderly man, named Pietro Paoli, who was the
last person seen in deceased’s company prior to the latter’s
arrest, was apprehended in the precincts of the court on
suspicion of being concerned in the homicide of deceased.
Mr. Bigge Wigge, Q.C. (instructed by the firm of Eagle,
Sparrowhawk and Kite), prosecuted on behalf of the police (
and the Honorable Colossus Cheeke was specially retained by
Messrs. Sharke, Pike, and Gudgeon to defend the prisoner
Paoli, and to watch the proceedings in the interest of the
relatives of the deceased. The deceased appeared in person.
After the body had been duly viewed and reviewed, the
jurors—to the number of thirteen —were severally sworn tot,
conduct the inquisition without fear, favor, or any show of
affectation. Mr. Bigge Wigge then made a few preliminary
remarks relative to everything in general and nothing ini
particular, and in which he took the Court into his confidence asl
to his opinions of the law of homicide, the state of the weather,!
the infallibility of the Jury system, the advance of Protection,
the antiquity of attainder and the law of escheat, the odds on
the Melbourne Cup, the reprieve of Mrs. Maybrick, and the
merits of Rignold’s Shakesperian interpretation. The cus-
tomary hysteria of applause greeted the conclusion of his
harangue, and after this subsided, he proceeded to call
evidence for the prosecution.


Constable Bartholomew Belisario Beltanbangem, XXX 666,*
was first pnt into the box, and the oath administered to him
by a fellow-policeman in words following, that is to say—
“ The evidence yon shall give in this inquiry shall be the truth,
the whole truth, or so much of the truth as seems convenient,
skelp yer in the gob.” At the conclusion of this adjuration,
the administrator of the oath thrust a tattered testament
under the tremulous nose of the witness, who brought his
lips to the Bible with a bellicose bang.
In answer to the coroner, the witness deposed that he first
saw the deceased about midnight, standing motionless at the
corner of Macquarie and Bridge streets; issued the regulation
order to “move on,” meaning thereby to “move off,” but
deceased failed to obey ; witness then interrogated him as to
who he was and what he was doing in that neighbourhood at
that hour of the night; deceased muttered something about
having an appointment to meet a girl he knew; not satisfied
with the explanation, threatened to arrest him for having no
lawful or visible means of support; deceased continued to stare
a t witness with savage stupidity, whereupon witness deter-
mined to reason with him with the help of the baton; deceased
resisted with his skull, and the baton broke into the pieces
produced.
At this stage—while unfolding the package containing the
sacred splinters—witness showed a disposition to faint, and
the crier handed him a glass of water, at the taste of which
he spat vehemently, grimaced vindictively, and revived viva-
ciously. Continuing his evidence, he added that deceased,
struck, fell to the ground and did not offer to move ;
the aid of an adjacent wheelbarrow trundled him to the
Nation and assisted to lock him in a cell. Bid not handcuff
Police OTE -—These satiric references, here and elsewhere, are not aimed at the

him because he (deceased) had only one arm; nor leg-iroi<
him, because he had a varicose vein in each of his crurali
members.
Mr. Wigge : —ln your opinion, was he drunk or sober ? 1
Mr. Cheeke :—I object to that question. Drunkenness is a;
matter of fact, not of opinion.
The Coroner:—l shall allow the question. I would as soor
take a policeman’s opinion on drink as I would that of an
analytical chemist. If he is not an authority on the subject, he
has no right to be in the Force.
Witness : —From the singular behaviour of the deceased, 1
will swear that he was far advanced in intoxication.
Mr. Wigge:—You say your baton broke into splinters
Can you offer the Court any reasonable explanation of this
phenomenon P
Witness : —Only that deceased’s head was the harder of tin
two. The like never happened me before, although I had use<i
the bludgeon under similar circumstances scores of times.
Mr. Wigge:—When did you last so use it ?
Witness : —A month ago, in apprehending a drunken
inmate of the Benevolent Asylum.
Mr. Wigge : —lt did not fracture on that occasion ?
Witness : —No ; but the man’s skull did.
Mr. Cheeke:—l wish to interpose a question. Where il
that man at the present time ?
Witness : —He is in the gaol hospital, undergoing a sentencf
of six months’ hard labor.
Mr. Cheeke : —On what charge ?
Witness : —Assaulting me in the execution of my duty.
Mr. Cheeke : —lt seems to me that you assaulted him.
Mr. Wigge:—l can convince the Court, if your Worshif
thinks it necessary, that my learned friend is labouring unde?
a forensic delusion. I can lay my hands on a great many
decided cases, which establish beyond doubt that it is
impossible for a policeman to be guilty of assaulting a man
under apprehension. The Law—which, as your Worship knoveSr
is the incarnation of common-sense —presupposes all the
inoffensiveness on the side of the police, and all the violence


bn the part of persons tinder arrest. All the authorities
unite to support this theory.
The Coroner: —There is no necessity to urge the matter
any further. I am sufficiently acquainted with the first
principles of British law, and I am surprised that Mr. Cheeke’s
zeal in his client’s behalf should betray him into advancing
such a silly contention.
Mr. Cheeke :—I beg your Worship’s pardon, and I apologise
to the witness.
In answer to the Coroner, the witness further added that
he was unable to account for the man’s unexpected death in
the cell; would swear that the blow from the baton did not
accelerate death; if pressed for an opinion, would venture
the suggestion that the vermin in the cell had bitten the
fellow to death; knew of his own knowledge that cell-bugs
were decidedly gluttonous, gregarious, and non-fastidious in
j their habits.
Mr. Cheeke: —Was not the blow given by you with the
baton a very severe one ?
Witness :—I think not.
Mr. Cheeke :—Why so ?
Witness:—Because no blood followed the stroke, and the
skull was only slightly dented where the blow fell. It did
i occasion a true wound.
Sergeant Michael O’Finnigan, ***ooo9, was then called,
a nd deposed :—Am an Irishman, and remember the seventeenth
°f March; shortly after midnight assisted the last witness
to transfer from a wheelbarrow to the lock-up a man who
Was senselessly drunk; spread some blankets on the floor and
very tenderly put the prisoner in his little bed ; left him
j a 1 emperance tract and a can of dirty water, and did not
visit him again that night; next morning went to arouse
I Ui to clean oat his cell, and received no answer; having
J-P-ion as to his critical condition, despatched a messenger
<* a doctor, who, on his arrival, ordered the removal of the
0 y fo the Morgue.
| -Mr. Wigge ; —At what stage of the discovery did you
611 of a medical man P


Witness: —As soon as I ascertained beyond doubt th&
tbe man was dead. I
Mr. Wigge : —What was the charge entered against him jfc
Witness: —He was given into my custody by the las*
witness for vagrancy, but I ordered the charge to be alterel
to that of wilful and indecent exposure.
Mr. Cheeke: —To what do you attribute his death ?
Witness: —To the effects of bad grog.
Mr. Cheeke : —Why bad grog ? o
Witness : —Because, from forty years professional ana
personal experience, I conclude that good grog is neithel
fatal nor injurious. t
Mr. Cheeke : —You speak very positively about decease!
being drunk. Have you no doubt on that point ? I
Witness : —Hone whatever, for while I was assisting thf
last witness to locate the deceased, the stench of Gflenlivef
was intolerable. y
Mr. Cheeke : —Do you imbibe yourself P
Witness: —Do I what ? What are you giving us ? I
appeal to your Worship whether I am here to give evident#
for the prosecution or to answer conundrums ? I
The Coroner: —I am aware that great latitude is allowel
in the cross-examination of policemen, but I would ask counsel
not to subject the witness to any unnecessarily severe test. 1
Mr. Cheeke: —I insist upon knowing, witness, whethel
you are yourself in the habit of drinking to excess ? (
Witness :—I ’m a teetotaller—once I was a worthies?
swiper, but the Salvation Army reclaimed me.
Mr. Cheeke : —How old is your conversion ?
Witness : —A fortnight.
Mr. Cheeke: —Then the unfaded grog-blossoms on youf
nose belong, I presume, to an earlier epoch of your existence ?f
Mr. Wigge:—l protest, your Worship, that my learned,
friend is exceeding the ordinary license of cross-examination. I
The Coroner:—l am loath to interfere, but I must warfl
counsel that his questions can only have the direct effect
prejudicing his client’s case.
Mr. Cheeke :— I will withdraw the question and substitute


another. On one occasion—before yon quitted the tents of
Tophet—were yon not so far delirious in liquor that you
entered a grocer’s shop in Waterloo, and sat down in a basket
ibf artificial eggs, under the delusion that you were a broody hen P
i Witness : —I vow
Mr. Wigge : —I protest
Mr. Cheeke : —I insist
The Coroner: —Really, gentlemen, these recriminations are
becoming painfully frequent, and these police-reminiscences
are utterly beside the question at issue.
i Mr. Cheeke:—l submit that my question is pertinent to
the inquiry. In order to rebut the suspicion of foul play,
I propose to show to the jury that the police witnesses are
quite capable of “ hatching a conspiracy ” against my client.
The Coroner : —I disallow the question.
Mr. Cheeke : —Well, did the last witness ever confide to
pou that he had experienced any dreams upon this or any
other subject ?
Witness:—He confessed to me that, soon after entering
phe force, he had three distinct dreams upon the subject of
■police promotion.
Mr. Wigge : —What on earth has this trash to do with the
Present inquiry ? How do dreams bear upon deceases ?
L W u d affinity is there between the two ? Admit that the
I, witness is a slave to nightmares or any other nocturnal
FyStemper, does that exonerate an advertent homicide, or
reduce ari accusation of murder to marble-manslaughter ?
I Mr. Cheeke : —The relevancy, though remote, is rational,
r. a man shrieks out “ Anna Maria ” in his sleep, such a
prcumstanqe may afterwards be lawfully adduced against
f\ 111 a suit for crim. con., or an action for breach of promise
P Carriage.
L t The Coroner:—'Nothing is too visionary for a court of law;
iTI ru^e * s t° admit only the best evidence obtainable.
‘ ist witness may be examined on this point, but not the
Assent occupant of the box.
Co
able Beltanbangem was then recalled, and, in answer
E


to defending counsel, admitted that he had made the statemei
as alleged, and had had the dreams as affirmed by tl
sergeant. On the first occasion he dreamt that he arreste
a predatory washerwoman, and was uplifted to the grade c
sergeant; on the second, that he captured an Asiatic fan-ta
sharper, and was exalted to the rank of sub-inspector; am
on the third, that he had a desperate encounter with a ont
armed burglar, and became Inspector-General of Police.
Mr. Wigge:—What was the basis of the midnight mea
preceding these dreams F
Witness: —Tripe (laughter).
The Coroner: —“ Such stuff as dreams are made of.
(Renewed laughter).
Mr. Cheeke: —On your oath, witness, did you ever g
through the marriage ceremony with the deceased ?
Mr. Wigge : —I object to the question.
Mr. Cheeke: —It is perfectly admissible. Does no
Blackstone say —
“ Is this law P
“Ay, marry , is’t—crowner’s quest law ? ”
Mr. Wigge : —I fail to see the logic of it.
The Coroner:—Learned counsel should know well enougl
that the logic of law is superior to logic itself. The Full Coni
has always ruled that if a witness has ever been guilty <
bigamy, the accused must he deemed innocent of eithl
burglary or attempted murder.
Witness: —I decline to say whether I ever went throug
any ceremony of any character with any person whomsoever. I
The Coroner: —That answer is satisfactory. Do you wiJ
to examine any of the police witnesses further ?
Mr. Cheeke: —After such an expression of opinion frol
the Bench, I do not.
The Coroner: —Then I will adjourn the inquest till
morrow for the production of further evidence. The prison®
may he enlarged on bail, but the jury must be locked nj
The counsel and myself will refresh. No order will I
given at present for the interment of the body.


CHAPTER XI.
IN WHICH I SEE MYSELF AS THE SCIONS OF SCIENCE SEE ME.
ON" the resumption of the inquest next morning, the
increase in the ranks of unwashed spectators testified
to the great and growing interest awakened in the public
mind by the suspicious circumstances already unearthed, as
well as those foreshadowed by the first day’s proceedings.
Pietro, on surrendering to his bail, presented a phenomenal
outline of sobriety, which painfully evidenced the shock sus-
tained by his system at the gravity of the accusation preferred
against him. The Coroner seemed none the worse for interim
refreshment, and the Bar exhibited an outward pai*ade of
artificial astuteness, as if in indication that their wits, like the
Pipper’s razors, had been sharpened for the fray. Mr. Horse-
hair appeared in the capacity of junior counsel to Mr. Bigge
Wigge; and Mr. Jabez Jowle sat in physical and professional
juxtaposition to Mr. Colossus Cheeke.
Most of the leading members of the medical profession,
attracted hy the scientific characteristics of the case, had risked
alike the unwonted gratitude of patients, and the undying
resentment of undertakers, by taking unto themselves a special
holiday. As the doctors and lawyers ensconced themselves in
trailing array in the circle of chairs sacred to professional ease,
subjected the limited accommodation of the Court to a
severe strain, and humorously illustrated the trite observation
that “where the carcase is, there also will the eagles he
gathered together.”
-Poger Rock, State-geologist, was the first witness called,
deposed as follows —I have examined the conglomerate
grease of the prehistoric personage, who is the subject of this
®fiuiry. X find it to he that of a well-nourished adult pre-
amite male. Externally, the carcase is covered with a
a io us calcareous cuticle, studded with pleocine protuberances
P® Porphyric epidermis. On submitting portions of it to


mineralogical analysis, they exhibited traces of the existence of
a great granite heart, a big basaltic breast and a strangely
Silurian stomach. The viscera were in an advanced stage of
volcanic eruption, whilst the abdomen was interstratified with
indelible intestinal irregularities. The result of a partial disl
section of such of the meridian structure as had escaped decomi
position showed distinct indications of a glacial groin and a
saline spine. On turning my attention to the nether segments,
I found a carboniferous calf and a tertiary thigh, terminating
in each leg in ferruginous feet.
Mr. Wigge : —Did you notice any facial contortion about its
mouth that would indicate recourse to foul play ?
Witness :—None ; the mouth was miocene.
Mr. Wigge What sort of eyes and ears ?
Witness : —Eozoic.
Mr. Wigge : —What description of forearm ?
Witness: —Fossiliferous.
Mr. Wigge :—And palate ?
Witness :—Palsezoic.
The Coroner: —In your opinion, what was the cause of
death ?
Witness : —Senile decay.
Mr. Cheeke: —It is not a murdered mineralogical mon-
strosity ?
Witness No more than it is “ Imperial Caesar, dead and
turned to clay.”
Dr. Lancelot Liverpad was next summoned to the witness-
box, which he was not permitted to reach without running the
gauntlet of a battalion of basilisk eyes bloated with professional
envy. In appearance, he was a gentlemanly edition of Guido
Fawkes, and carried as many letters in his post-baptismal hag
as one of Dan. O’Connor’s salaried mercuries. If doctors, like
lawyers, possess the privilege of getting to Heaven “ by?
degrees,” the witness was well on his way to the region of
bliss, for he held a game license from almost every University
extant, from Massachusetts to Melbourne, and from Syria to
Sydney.


Having parenthetically prefixed his lips to the Book which,
like the Pontiff’s toe, was none the worse for yesterday’s
kissing, he deposed as follows: —I am a duly and legally
qualified medical practitioner, and produce my license to kill.
At an early hour on the 18th I was sent for by the police to
attend a man in the lockup, who was supposed to be in a dead
or dying condition; on arrival I found him in articulo mortis ; on
examining him closely, I found little or no hemorrhage, and the
skin dry and blistered; the pulse was imperceptible, and the
breathing slow, irregular and painfully labored; tried an
injection, but with barren results. His features at this time
presented the ghastly and cadaverous pallor of a dying man,
and his whole frame was paralytically immobile, —so much so,
that a strong galvanic shock, which I then administered, had
no other effect than to cause his hair to stand upon end.
The Coroner Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.”
(Laughter).
Witness (continuing) : —His condition was comatose and
such as to afford little hope of recovery ; in fact, he breathed
his last soon after the application of the galvanic battery.
Mr. Wigge :—Did you perform a post-mortem on deceased ?
Witness Ho ; I did not think it necessary, as lam posi-
Lve as to the cause of death, which I ascribe to the action on
ihe stomach of an irritant poison. I do not think alcohol
w °uld cause the appearances I have indicated. Eating unripe
fruit or mildewed mushrooms might. I adhere, however, to
fhe thesis wdiich first presented itself to my imagination —that
death is due to the administration of herbal remedies by an
unlicensed practitioner. If the viscera be preserved for
ana lysis, my theory will, I feel sure, be confirmed.
Mr. Wigge :—Did you have recourse to the stomach pump?
Witness :—I endeavoured to, but I found that there was so
u °b mucous or other obstruction in the throat that the pump
AV °uld not work.
Mr. Wigge :—What was the external condition of the
st omach ?
in r^uess —Mery hard and rigid, and very much distended;
fact > the general outward appearance of the deceased


stamped him as a man much addicted to gluttony and good
living.
The Coroner:—Are you positive as to the deceased’s gender?
Witness : —Yes; not only from his attire (which might, of
course, mislead), but from the apparent absence of any tongul
in the mouth.
Mr. Wigge:—Might not the lingual member have been
removed at some earlier period by a special surgical operation
Witness:—No; it had the appearance of having wasted away
through long disuse. It was a genuine, hut rare, case oi
lingual atrophy, a calamity wholly confined to the masculine
section of humanity.
Mr. Wigge:—To what do you ascribe the hard, warty
excrescences on deceased’s hack P
Witness: —They may be the after-effect of a shot-wound, or
they may be skin disease, or scratches by the convict-cat; in
fact, they may arise from any and every cause. I attach no
importance to them.
Mr. Wigge :—Might they not indicate that he had been on
visiting terms with a well-armed and heroic lady P
Witness :—They might, or they might not.
To the Coroner: —l cannot speak with preciseness as to the
deceased’s age, hut he was toothless and very old. His passing!
away was painless, and there were none of the contortions and
contractions ordinarily symptomatic of an agonising death. 1
am prepared to swear that I could have saved the deceased!
had I been summoned earlier.
The Coroner : —Do the circumstances of his decease point tel
the necessity of any alteration in the existing law ?
Witness . —Undoubtedly. I think Dr. Creed should be askedl
to introduce a Medical Bill, confining the intervention of|
medical men to three contingencies —when the patient is halel
and hearty ; when he is hypochondriacal only ; and when hej
is dead.
Mr. Jowle : —Will you swear that the man was dead when
you ordered his removal to the Morgue P
Witness: —Yes. I adopted the standard remedies to ascertain;
if life was actually extinct.


Mr. Jowle - What tests did you resort to ?
Witness: —Drawing an iron bar, at white heat, across the
nape of his neck ; and placing a flask of neat brandy to his lips.
Mr. Jowle: —As he neither flinched at the grilling of the
flesh, nor opened his month for the spirits, you inferred that he
was dead ?
Witness Precisely.
Mr. Jowle Is not the application of a mirror the extreme
test? . _
Witness: Only with females, in which case it is an infallible
indication of either the presence of vanity or absence of vitality.
Mr. Jowle : —lf lack of vanity is assured, lack of vitality is
inferred ?
Witness In females, yes ; but with male corpses the offer
of grog is the surer test. If the spirit is in, the spirit is not
long kept but.
This concluding the cross-examination, the witness resumed
his place amongst the chirurgical coterie, whose professional
envy had thawed in the presence of a suspicion of malapraxis
against an unlicensed practitioner.
Benjamin Fawcett, H.M.D., then walked to the box with
majestic surgico-scornful gait, and, kissing the Testament as
oordially as if he were greeting an old friend, he deposed: I
am a homoeopathic physician, and have examined the deceased
at the request of the Coroner. I conclude, from my examina-
tion, that cancer, accelerated by the apathy of allopathic
ammalculae, cut him short in the bloom of early manhood.
To the Coroner: —Am prepared to swear that every human
bei *g is predisposed to cancer. Why then prematurely die ?
Consult Dr. Fawcett who is, to German Charlie, as Hyperion
to a Satyr
The Coroner :—Et satyr a, and stand down. (Laughter).
Mr. Horsehair intimating that the Crown was not at pre-
®ont prepared with any further testimony, the Coroner ordered
e inquest to stand adjourned till next day, and gave instruc-
ts that deceased should, in the interim, be photographed so
k. 8,8 “ secure the shadow ere the substance faded.


CHAPTER XII.
I AM SUMMONED TO A SEAT IN THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, BUT A[?]
DETAINED IN DURESS BY THE CORONER.
ON the third day, public interest in the proceeding
reached its climax, and owing to a rumour that til
multitude intended to rescue Paoli and lynch thf
petrified man, the hands of the court were strengthened with J
squad of soldiery, and ingress to the inquest was obtainable bj
ticket only.
The first witness examined was Nineveh Melville, Esq., J.P.,
M.P., C.M.G-., &c., * who, on being duly sworn to indulge in
the unparliamentary pastime of telling the truth, deposed thal
he was Chairman of Committees of the Legislative Assembly
and also a caterer for sepulchral sequestration ; and, in the
amalgamation of these professional pursuits, possessed ub
doubted facilities for “ judging the quick and the dead]
From information received, he was led to believe that hi
presence was required on the previous day at the Morgue
Understanding that a well-authenticated fossil was in a fit stati
for coronial enquiry, he had concluded that either the E 1
of C ds or the new R y C r f had give!
up the ghost. On attendance at the Morgue, he introduced
himself to the deceased with an offer to provide him with
furnished ground-floor apartments on liberal terms, with a
reduction in the case of families or twins; to his astonishment 1
he recognised in the deceased the remains of a morose old
fellow whom he had in years gone by hired on several occasions
to fulfil the functions of a mute at first-class funerals; would
* Note. This facetious reference to the little demagogue is intended in no
derogation of his political activity. An undertaker being a sine qua non to the
proceedings, the most eminent (among the existing or the ex-) has been chosen. As
to Mr. Melville s political achievements, it is noteworthy that he has recently been
unanimously chosen to rule over an Assembly where originally he had great difficulty
in securing an audience of one. Such is the triumph of mind over matter !
t The witness’s opinion, not the writer’s.


swear to deceased by virtue of a wall-eye which the corpse still
retained ; had lost sight of him for the last few years—in fact,
ever since discharging him for riotous behaviour at a funeral
festivity.
The Coroner: —What form did the display of riot assume P
Witness : —Soddening sombre solemnity with the spiritual
semblance of a smile. (Cheers in court, promptly suppressed,
at the crier’s command, by the soldiery).
The Coroner :—Have yon anything further to add to your
testimony ?
Witness :—Only that is my politico-professional opinion that
the body should be buried without further remonstrance or
delay. I regard its presence above ground as a vital insult to
the members of our time-honored profession; and it appears
to be the thin end of the wedge in a movement to supplant
funerals by fossilization. Cremation is a bad enough innova-
tion ; but when it comes to petrifaction, it is time that we
coffin-coiners consolidated in opposition.
Mr. CheekeHave you had such experience in fossils as
to enable you to speak in the authoritative manner you have
to-day assumed ?
Witness : —I have been ten years in Parliament, and have
been associated with Protectionists all my life.
Mr. Wigge. —You have, in your day, rendered great service
as a Government whip.
Witness:— Yes; and greater service still as an Opposition
«courg e (Cheers, in which, to the crier’s consternation, the
soldiery joined).
Mr. Wigge:— l believe that from your place in Parliament
J’ou once said that “ a man must live.” How do you reconcile
bat necessitous axiom with your feverish desire to entomb the
?
Witness:—l did say so; but I did not intend my remarks
Jj a Pplicable to the subject of this inquiry. Peradventure,
e line must be drawn somewhere, and I draw it at marble
men.
Mr. Cheeke : —lt is much more to the purpose with you that
6ri rilUs t die ; is it not ?


Witness : —Yes, provided they do their duty to society I
securing decent and respectable interment —not like this felloi
simply perambulating the provinces to save funeral expenses!
Mr. Cheeke:—You saw the corpse at the Morgue—was yol
examination of it anyway extended ? I
Witness:—No. Of course, I ran my rule over him, an
estimated the relative suitableness of colonial pine and stains
mahogany.
Mr. Cheeke :—Anything else P
Witness :—I smelt his breath.
Mr. Cheeke : —What did you infer therefrom ?
Witness:—That he was neither a newspaper reporter nor l
member of Parliament.
Mr. Cheeke : —ln your opinion, is deceased a Freetrader 1
a Protectionist ?
Witness : —I do not recognise him as a staunch Protection^
Mr. Cheeke : —Why ?
Witness : —He is not noisy enough ;as a disturber of puhj
meetings, he would not earn the cost of his enlistment.
The Coroner : —That will do. Call the next witness.
Peter Parr, on oath, deposed:—l am clerk of the Legislate
Council, and, by special permission of that honorable house, I prl
duce all the records of the petrified branch of the LegislatuJ
Mr. Wigge:—Be good enough to read to his Worship at
resolutions of the Council, bearing in any way upon the subjei
of this inquiry.
Witness: —On the fifth of November last, on the motion o
the Honorable Godfrey Goutytoes, it was ordered as follows—l
“ Whereas a rumor has gained ground to the effect that an unidentified mJ
fossil is now in Sydney, it is hereby resolved that a call of the Housel
made for the seventeenth of March next in order to ascertain whetil
any of the members of this honorable House, being moribund, a<
missing ; or being dead, are unburied.”
Mr. Wigge : —Have you a picture of the Roll Call ?
Witness : —Only Miss Butler’s ; but that is sufficiently tri
to life to accurately depict all the humors and infirmities
the situation.


Mr. Wigge : —Were there any absentees ?
Witness: —ISTone.
Mr. WiggeDid the presence of the full strength of the
Council necessitate any change in the structural accommoda-
tion of the Chamber ?
Witness Yes; this had been anticipated by the President,
who had portion converted into a hospital ward.
Mr. Wigge Did all the members answer to their names ?
Witness :—ln one fashion or another; those who were too
old to mumble the responses, made signs.
Mr. Wigge:—As a result of the roll-call showing no
absentees, was any resolution arrived at ?
Witness : —Yes ; Sir Simon Sciatica proposed (it is hardly
correct to say that he “ moved”), and the Honorable Punctilius
Paralysis seconded, tbe following resolution :
“Whereas, from the evidence elicited at a call of the House this day, it
appears to this honorable House that there is, within the colony s
boundaries, one distinctly-developed fossil not yet included in the
ranks of its Legislative Councillors, it is therefore resolved that a
deputation instantaneously wait upon Lord Carrington and, with bowed
heads and on bended knees, humbly pray that he will be graciously
pleased to order the fossil aforesaid to be translated to this Chamber
without delay.”
Mr. Wigge :—Was there any dissent to this resolution ?
Witness : — ~V ery little. Mr. David Buchanan argued that,
as the resolution imposed an additional burden on the people,
it ought properly to originate in another place ; but Mr. Jacob
; Col hbated this contention by showing that resolutions affecting
an } r particular Chamber must originate in the Chamber they
Particularly affect.
Mr. Wigge 'Was the errand undertaken by the Deputation
with success P
Witness :—lt was. I have here a Commission from the
I Governor-in-Council summoning the fossil in question to a
Seat M the Legislative Council (Profound Sensation in Court).
The Coroner:—Let the Commission be read without delay,
I Ml with all due reverence. The Court will stand during the
et ' e inony, with the exception of the jurors and myself, who
I i fall upon our knees. The police will draw their batons,


and the soldiery will present arms, and at the conclusion fir
a feu dejoie.
The witness then read the Commission in words following
that is to say—
Royal Writ of Habeas Corpus.
Victoria, by the grace of &e.
To all to whom these presents shall come (I
not come, greeting or not greeting, as tt
case may be.
Whereas it is represented to me that a fossil whose name is unknown, lii
who can be identified by the police, is not yet enrolled among the venerali
members of the Legislative Council, these are therefore to summon, com
mand, enjoin, request and empower the said fossil, in his own proper persol
to attend at the Legislative Council aforesaid and there take oath, before!
or our deputies, to legislate with favor and without fear; to take such par
in the counsels of the nation as his inclinations and infirmities permit; t
resist and reject all bills, resolutions, &c., except such as appear bare]
progress or barren of result; to mar, mutilate and mangle such as seem]
extend the popular liberties or contribute to the public weal; and to tyranfl
cally alter and despotically amend such as represent the labors and recoil
the opinions of the people’s own representatives.
At your peril fail not.
Given at Government House, &c., &e.
C N (L.s.J I
Mr. Cheeke : —ln the face of that document, I submit that
your Worship can go no further with these proceedings. The
soldiery should he instructed to escort the Marble Man to
the Legislative Council.
Mr. Wigge : —But the basis of our contention is that the
man is stone dead !
The Coroner: —l do not know that even that circumstance
can be lawfully regarded as a disqualification from a seat h
the Legislative Council. It would, of course, be pushing the
merits of our Constitution to an extreme limit. I should he
glad to be shown any precedent for this course.
Mr. Cheeke : —To elicit this, I propose to ask the witness
if any other members of the present Council are dead.
The Coroner :—That may be done.
Witness (hesitatingly) : —I am inclined to think not, though
some are “ awfully near it.”


J Mr. Melville (interjecting) : —I will undertake to say that
there are none dead who are unburied.
The Coroner :—Silence, sir. You are out of order in inter-
fleeting anything in this Court. I care as little for your
opinion as my learned brother at Illawarra cares for the
public press.
Mr. W. P. Crick (who had entered the Court while the
JCommission was being read): —If your Worship will per mitme,
las amicus curiae , I can convince you that the Law, in regard
|to summoning Legislative Councillors, draws the line at
t dead men.
The Coroner: —l shall be extremely obliged.
Mr. Crick : —lf one actually dead man may be on the roll,
so may ten, twenty, thirty, and so on, until the whole Council
consists of dead men; for, once admit the principle, no line can
be drawn or limit imposed. The result of this extreme step
would therefore be equivalent to an unconstitutional “ dissolu-
tion ” of the whole House.
[ The Coroner:—With your usual legal shrew T dness, Mr.
[Crick, yon have extricated me from a position of great judicial
jcmbarrassment. I shall therefore detain the deceased, and
pdl conclude the inquiry to-morrow, to which date, therefore,
[the Court stands adjourned. Lock up the Marble Man and
T le jury; under 7 John I, indulge them with neither meat
L or drink; and renew the sureties for the appearance of
Mhetro Paoii.


CHAPTER XIII.
In WHICH I AM THE SUBJECT OE IDENTIFICATION AND CROSS
AND COUNTER-RECOGNITION.
OWING- to the number of witnesses still to be examined
no time was lost on the fourth day in resuming th
thread of the inquisitorial inquiry. The interventioi
of Royalty in the corpse’s favor haying opportunely nippedjii
the hud the riotous efflorescence of the almighty soaplesi
the soldiers were disbanded, and permitted to “ recruit ” a
the canteen of their corps, or “ smell powder ” —if not literal
at the cannon’s mouth, at least ungrudgingly on the flami
cheeks of the cooks and Cleopatras of kindly kitchens.
David Towrag Darksell, the first witness to face tl
forensic footlights of the day, deposed that he was an office
in the Department of Prisons, and the proper custodian
all records in identification of convicts and discharged felons
He produced a parcel containing the photographs of
principal prigs at the penitentiary.
Mr. Wigge (staring ominously and suggestively at tk
alleged corpse as sat upon by the Coroner) : —Sweep your ef
over the Court, witness, and tell us if anyone here present b®
a picturesque abiding-place among the pages of your album 9
The witness’s response to this recklessly comprehensk
inquiry was lost amidst the noise caused by the sudden » Ilt
sweeping stampede of the spectators; and the Coroner,
inquiring what was the genesis of this exodus of number
ordered Mr. Darksell to repeat his reply.
Witness : —I have all of ’em here —three for stealing
a dwelling, two for fraudulent insolvency, one for arson,
for bigamy, one for wife-desertion, and four under 9
provisions of the Cattle Stealing Prevention Act.
Mr. Wigge : —What in thunder are you talking
To whom are you alluding ?


Witness. —To the jury.
Mr. Wigge : —Eh ? A—hem. 1 did not intend to direct
your research to them, but to the deceased.
The Foreman of the Jury hereupon also appealed to his
Worship to protect its members from all inclemency of
insinuation, and added that it was becoming a favorite pastime
in certain quarters to pour insult on the oily heads of honest
jurymen.
The Coroner: —Tut, tut, man; every juror is expected to
have the courage of his “convictions.”
Witness (resuming) : —I am not prepared to swear that
prisoner’s carte-de-visite is in my album; but I feel morally
certain that he has been in trouble before. To my experienced
eye he has all the appearance of a “ hardened ” offender.
Mr. Wigge:—That is sufficient for our purpose.
Edward Essayist Pulsford next deposed:—l am a statistical
laundress and denominational detective in the employ of the
Free Trade Corporation. In the latter capacity 1 have been
°n the track of the deceased for years past, hut until yesterday
I failed to lay hands on him. I recognise him as a melancholy
member of the “ personation push ” ; some of his accomplices
are already in custody, and I hope to bag the remainder next
general election.
Mr. Jowle :—ls he not a duly qualified voter P
Witness :—I understand that he owns a small allotment of
land in the Devonshire-street cemetery; but his residential and
Property qualifications entitle him to only one vote, whereas he
as recorded at least a thousand votes at every city election
daring the past twenty years.
The Coroner (lifting his eyes from a perusal of “ Artemus
Ward”) : —I understand; his political belief is singular, hut
ls votes are plural (laughter).
Witness: —He voted ninety times for Mr. Schey on the
° c casion of that gentleman’s recent resurrection ; hut he eluded
°ar vigilance, as he always does, by remaining in strict
See lusion from one election to another. He is never seen
e3Cce pt on polling days.


Mr. Wigge: —When did yon see him last ?
Witness: —I canght a glimpse of him at the Schey-
Anderson election. He was attired in a shrond, a skull-cap
and a pair of spectacles, and dodged about as Mr. Single’s
double.
Mr. Wigge : —Do you know who his employers are ?
Witness : —Only by rumour, which is, of course, not always
reliable. He is supposed, in his day, to have served many
masters. Mr. Davies was credited at one time with keeping
him in his regular employ, and even Mr. O’Connor has been
accused of occasionally hiring him to do odd jobs in his political
backyard. At present Mr. Toohey enjoys the reputation of
having the most influence in raising him from his bier.
The Reverend Rheoboam Reredos, being called upon to
testify as to the character borne by deceased, stated that he
had had him under diocesan disquisition for some time past,
with the result that he felt called upon to denounce him as a
seedplot of infidelity—in fact, as soulless an agnostic as had
yet come under his clerical cognisance.
Mr. Cheeke : —Have not your travels in theology induced
an idea in your mind that there is a race of petrified persons
on earth, whom it has been the orthodox, but erroneous, custom
to speak of as “ the illustrious dead ? ”
Witness : —I cannot say that my researches have had that
effect.
Mr. Cheeke: —To begin with, may not Cain—the first
Morrison —be a petrifaction, distinct from his fellow-men in
death as in life; for since no one would bother to kill him, o>
fortiori , who would take the trouble to bury him ? Then there
is Moses —is not the site of his sepulture a secret P And Lot’s
wife—is she not an undoubted saline petrifaction ?
Witness : —I decline to discuss such heterodoxical opinions-
You are more irreverent than the subject of this inquest.
Laban Lemuel Levi, a claimant to a genealogical genesis in
the lost ten tribes, was next called, and objected strenuously
to take oath on a Sheigatz Bible. On the Coroner instructing


him to swear in his usual custom, he complied with such literal
lingual intensity as to drive the last witness out of the Court,
and bring a blush to the bronzed cheek of the corpse.
Eventually, he escaped with the coroner’s censure, and being
accommodated with an emasculated edition of Holy Writ,
touched the interior with the tip of his nose and deposed that
he identified deceased as “ the Wandering Jew” of fiction.
In cross-examination, he explained that on arrival in Australia,
the victim of perpetual motion recognised such a territorial
affinity to the Promised Land that he begged the removal of
the curse, which was accordingly diverted into an obligation
on him to remain for ever in the sphere he had so sensibly
selected —to ensure which perpetuity he had been transformed
into solid stone.
Mr. Wigge : —As the evidence shows that neither scrip nor
scrap, jewels nor money, was found on deceased, it is right for
me to announce that the Crown does not rely on the theory
advanced by the last witness.
Octave Broulard, a visitor from Neo Galedonie, after
deposing how much the colony reminded him of la belle France,
identified the deceased as the Gallic navigator, La Perouse,
whose port-mortem habitation had hitherto baffled French philo-
sophy and Parisian inquisitiveness. He was prepared to swear
to the identity by virtue of the deceased’s Napoleonic nose,
irrespective of the fact that the bony part of the corpse had
long ago disappeared.
Robert Hannan, private detective, and ex-sub-inspector of
Fijian police, identified the remains as those of the Government
geological surveyor, Lamont Young, who disappeared at Ber-
magui; was of opinion that search should be instituted for
Schneider and the other missing members of the party, all of
whom had probably been stoned to death by the malefactors
Whom the mines had attracted.
Morosus Mildew deposed that he was a Civil servant, in the
Se nse of civility to those only who hold preferment in the
F


hollow of their hands ; was the bloated head of a bloated
department, and, like the playful iguana (whom he much
resembled) had gained the topmost branches by continuous
crawling; recognised the deceased as his long-lost brother,
from whom he had been separated at the destruction of
Pompeii and the Herculaneum; since then, he (witness) had
led a lickspittle life, never believing it possible that he would
see his brother again; recognised deceased by the diminutive
dimensions of his brainpan, by the absence from his breast of
any of the milk of human kindness, and by a general phreno-
logical parallelism to himself. If the Coroner would order his
brother fossil to be delivered to his charge, witness would
answer for his maintenance, as he had a vacant clerkship in
the Service all ready for him, provided he would enter into
recognizances to act as a tyrant to his subordinates and a toady
to his superiors. This offer not meeting with any response
from the corpse, witness crawled out of court on his hands and
knees, and licked the dust from the feet of examining counsel
by the way.
Charles Hall, a talented worshipper at the Thespian temple,
deposed that the deceased was “ Caesar’s ghost, ’ with whom he
was on terms of prolonged personal intimacy.
Mr. Wilshire, of the party of “ law and order,” and Mr. G. R.
Dibbs, of the party of neither law nor order, also deposed to a
belief in the spectral origin of the deceased; but whilst the
former inclined to an idea that it was “ Fisher’s Ghost,” the
latter obstinately adhered to the theory that it was the veri-
table celebrated “ Kiama Ghost,” which had been entrusted
with an officer’s commission in a Freetrade Falstaffian regi-
ment at the last general election; and, doing battle against his
(witness’s) followers, had caused the rabble to sustain a bloody
rout.
Colonel Puella Puff, in his depositions, stated that he was a
haberdasher by trade and a military genius by profession ; he
dissented from the dicta of the previous witnesses, and


recognised the corpse as that of a master-gunner (long since
deceased) to whose inaction he attributed the whole deficiencies
and shortcomings of the military forces. The deceased was the
author of the defalcations for which poor Webster was unjustly
martyred; had caused the whole armament to rust, the
monster guns to explode, and the detonating material to non-
explode ; had impelled the men to mutiny and the majors to
inefficiency ; had inspired drunkenness, incited desertion, and,
broadly speaking, had driven the battalions to the devil’s own
condition of deficiency and disrepair.
To Mr. Jowle :—Believed himself on safe ground in attri-
buting the whole disorganisation and disaster to the deceased ;
if not too late, would counsel that witness and Major Staylace
and Captain Tightboots be empowered to try the deceased by
garrison court-martial.
To Mr. Wigge : —Colonel C 1 had, he was sorry to
state, delegated the supervision of the Torpedo Corps too
infernally much to the deceased.
The Coroner (majestically) —
“ 111 fares the land, to infamous ills a prey,
Where epaulettes accumulate, and military men decay.”
Doctor Cornelius-N'epos Cato Caesar Creed here pre-
sented himself in preferment of evidence contradictory of that
tendered by the last witness; but the Coroner and the Bar
unanimously held that he was disqualified to testify, inasmuch
as he had an unorthodox and awkward knack of not only uttering
the truth himself, but causing it to chemically effervesce out of
the deepest well. The doctor accordingly retired with threats
of interrogatories in another place.
Henry Hector Skuthorpe, a savage slab of back-block
humanity, carelessly compounded of raw beef and ribaldry,
swore with many oaths that the remains were the disinterred
fragments of either Dr. Leichhardt or old Classen —preferably
the former and the greater of the two explorers ; had kept the
relics in a case near Cunnamulla for the last ten years in
readiness for the appropriation of a proper reward from the


Governments of New South Wales and Queensland ; considered
the disturber of the relics should be prosecuted by the police
on a charge of sacrilege.
The Coroner :—I shall not record this witness’s testimony ;
he has had the impudence and indecency to appear in the
witness-box with a dirty shirt on his hack and an impertinent
boil on his neck; and from his breath I feel sure that he pur-
posely and of malice aforethought got roaring drunk the
Christmas before last. All these are, to my mind, overt acts
in a conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice; and, therefore,
for not having the common decency to conceal his contempt of
this court, I order him to he imprisoned in Berrima gaol for
three years (the first two in irons), and to receive three
whippings of thirty lashes each.
The offending witness was hastily dragged into durance,
vigorously protesting the innocence of his linen and the blood-
guiltlessness of his boil; and the evidence in the inquiry being
now concluded, the Coroner announced that he would reverse
the ordinary method of procedure, and address the jury himself
before the Counsel had time to bewilder brains by bemuddling
facts.


CHAPTER XIV.
WHICH REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE JUROR AS A BUCOLIC BEING
WITH A HEAD LIKE A PUMPKIN AND A MIND LIKE
MARROW.
TN his charge to the jury the Coroner was as. lucid as
! Nature reluctantly permits Coroners to be. He impresse
T upon them that the novelty of the investigation increased
its difficulties and enhanced its importance. Since the days
when the first man was created and the first woman manu-
factured (which latter fact he facetiously alluded to as the
basis of woman’s claim to man’s “protection”), no. more
eccentric personage than the deceased had come within the
purview of a Coroner and his jury. He felt painfully the
singular responsibility which had been thus thrust upon nim;
and he doubted not that so praiseworthy a diffidence found an
echo in each honest juror’s breast.. With regard to the
corpus delicti, he might ease their difficulties by laying his
official finger on the exact point of divergence, between this
and all ordinary subjects of coronial investigation. He could
best do this by assuring them that, in a legal sense, the
difference was accurately expressed by the discrepancy between
the terms “ petrifaction ” and “ putrefaction.” This distinction
well digested, their first duty was to determine who. the
deceased was, and on this point the evidence vas copious,
even if contradictory. At the dawn of the inquiry, deceased
had suffered the misfortune of appearing before them as a
nameless unknown; but whoever he might be, the petnfacient
fact remained that he had got there just the same. Neithei
should they suffer this initial helplessness to harden their
hearts against human justice, for it was his duty to tell them,
as they might themselves see, that the lack of identity had,
during the progress of the proceedings, changed to random
recognition. Of the rival theories set up by the several
witnesses, the jury might believe any, all, or none ; and they


might intimate which of the witnesses, if any, should be
sent to Judge Windeyer on trial for perjury. It was his
duty, however, to remind them that identification was a relative
virtue, not an exact science. For example, for a creditor to
identify a debtor is strikingly easy; but for a debtor to identify
a creditor is proportionately hard. Their next duty was to
determine what circumstances had contributed to the demise
of the stalwart being upon whom they would presently sit.
For himself he thought that felo-de-se should be scouted as an
unworthy hypothesis.
The foreman of the jury here rose in his place and protested
against the introduction of the Branxton matter or any Home
Rule politics into the inquiry ; and he thought his Worship
was exceeding his duty in speaking of the*'great “ o-ray-tor ”
as “that fellow Deasy” or branding him as “an unworthy
hypothesis.”
The Coroner good-humoredly explained the error into
which the foreman had fallen, and observed that, in the teeth
of so perfect a protestation of intelligence, for him to further
enlighten the enlightened would be like throwing pearls before
oysters. He plainly saw that the deliberations of the jury
would reflect on themselves the average amount of juridical
credit, and he now left it for them to decide whether the
circumstances presented themselves to their minds as having
their origin in “ natural causes,” or as demanding, on the
other hand, a verdict of crim. con ., breach of promise, or
justifiable homicide. Finally he conjured them to drown
prejudice in their cups, and in their deliberations to do their
duty to their Creator, their country and themselves.
Mr. Bigge Wigge, having straightened his silken gown
and wiped his forehead and blown his nose, expressed adulatory
appreciation of His Worship’s oratory, and his deep-rooted
recognition of the prominence due to each and all of the
jurors in the ranks of sensible men. As to the subject of
the inquiry, he was dead and done for; he deserved no com-
miseration at their hands, for what earthly right had he to
die P As to the authors of the miscreant’s demise, the jury


had to say whether the police or the prisoner was wholly
to blame. As enlightened men, they must acquit his clients—
the police —for the obvious reason that the Law and the
Legislature alike contemplated virginal crimelessness m the
conduct and composition of the Force. The police, as they
knew, were the keystone of civilization’s arch; without them,
there’would be neither civilization nor crime, and the goddess
of liberty would be at the mercy of the demirep of lawlessness.
On the other hand, it was for the prisoner, Paoli, to prove
his innocence, which, he vigorously submitted, accused had
failed to do. Whilst warning them to fight shy of his learned
and honorable friend’s sophisms, he protested that they would
fail of their duty if they neglected to honorably exonerate the
police and convict the accused of wilful murder.
The Honorable Colossus Cheeke—smoothing his spectacles
and simulating a professional jury droop—extolled the magni-
ficence of the Coroner’s charge, and enrolled each and every
juror in the seventh heaven of sense and sensibility. In reve-
rence to the deceased he asked them to show honor to his
honor, tears to his tragic termination, and mercy to the milk-
white hero so unjustly saddled with his misfortunes. In
the absence of a fragment of damnatory testimony against his
client he would not insult their intelligence by an atom of
exoneration, but he would implore them not to be deluded by
the chicanery of his learned friend, who was a humbug ot the
first water and a deluder of the deepest drivel.
When the jury retired, Mr. Jowle applied to his Worship
to reconsider the sentence passed on the offending witness,
Skuthorpe, and reduce it to a fine of £5, the culprit agreeing
to enter into recognisances to appear (when called upon) m a
boiled shirt and an unboiled neck.
The Coroner : —I cannot comply with your request. I have
just received a wire from the Chief Justiciary to say that the
sentence is not a day too much or a stroke too many, and t a
to work out the problem of his release should bestow on the
witness much wholesome fun.


After a brief retirement, tlie jury returned into court, and
through their foreman, delivered the following verdict: —
1. The jury find that the remains are those of a well-developed human being,
presumably of the male gender, but who the decayed old gentleman is, or what is the
nature of his religious belief, neither the jury nor any one else can say.
The jury further find that the deceased came to an untimely end through
privation and exposure, accelerated by the intense inclemency of the weather and the
volcanic character of his sleeping apartments.
3. And further, we find that no blame whatever attaches to the police, but there
is sufficient “ constructive ” evidence against Pietro Paoli to warrant us in convicting
the said Pietro Paoli of counterfeit coining and marble-manslaughter.
3. Having saddled the said Paoli with the above offence, we desire to add, as a
“ rider,” that in our opinion it is incumbent on the authorities to ascertain if any
more petrified men are in seclusion, and, under promise of a free pardon, to invite
them to emerge from their hiding-places and claim the privilege of the franchise.
The Coroner endorsed the verdict by committing the pri-
soner for trial to the Assizes, accepting bail for his appearance,
the accredited sureties being Mr. Roseby and Dr. M‘Carthy.


CHAPTER XV.
REVEALING THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PARABLE OF
THE TINKER AND THE TERMAGANT.
upon a time-when roller-skatiug was an unknown
( ) virtue and Protection had hardly begun to worry the
intestines of men's intellects-a superannuated school-
master had his household blessed with the presence of an only
daughter, so ugly that fops fought shy of her shadow, and
farmers longed to utilize her to scare the
orchards and the parrots from their wheatfields. It was
therefore, with no ordinary shock of surprise that her academic
philosopher of a parent received the intelligence that her ban
was sought in wedlock by a tinker casually visiting the
nei “My good fellow” protested the schoolmaster, “candour
compels me to direct your attention to her consummate
ugliness. You have surely not perceived that she is crook-
backed, wry-necked, flat-chested, and pug-nose . ,
“ I aint a-biddin’ for a Wenus,” was the tinker s response.
“But consider her remaining disparities—her bandy legs, her
club feet, her bald head, and her angular skullm short, my
worthy friend, she is a kaleidoscope of infirmities, and, o
crown all, she is ‘bearded as a paid.
“ I don’t care a tinker s curse.
“But my reckless Lothario, consider further. Know yon
that she’has a diabolical squint, and that—like the goddess
of colonial justice—she is blind in one eye.”
“ All the better if she squinted worse, or was blind m botft.
« But she is nearly deaf; and, as to speech, she is tongue-tied.
« Not bad qualities in a wife,” chuckled the unfastidious
tmS “ Look at her teeth—she is boar-toothed as to three, while
the residue of her dentition is represented by a minus quality,
argued the candid abecedarian. ,
“Wouldn’t have her altered for the world, responded the
stubborn wooer ; “ she ’ll suit me from toe to tusk.”


“ Then, again, noted you not that her face was a panorama
of small-pox pustules P and her temper registers a higher
the'rmometrical maximum than that of Petruchio’s Katharina.”
“ The first perfection makes up for the second failing.”
“ Even so, my love-sick patcher of asthmatic pans and
physicker of phthisicy kettles ; yet common humanity, forsooth,
urges me to decline your suit. My conscience forbids me to
assent to a stranger linking his future with a female phenome-
non, ugly enough for exhibition purposes.”
“ Ah, there you put the solder in the right crack,” grinned
the sooty suitor; “ you acknowledge your daughter to be
only fit for a show ; and you see, my scholarly sir, it’s only
for a blooming, bleeding show T want her.”
*****
Though the body of the above anecdote is old, its clothes
are new; even without the redemption of the latter, it would
be worth narrating in accordance with a growing custom, by
virtue of which all original stories nowadays are old, and all
oft ones original —as testifies that prince of punsters and
pitiless raconteur , E. Lewis S 1.
The application of the parable is to be found in the diffi-
culties experienced by my foster-father in procuring the
Coroner’s assent to my being returned to him for re-adoption.
His Worship found himself in a dire dilemma how to dispose
of me, for as scientific evidence pointed to the probability that
I would keep like frozen meat and better than the Ten Com-
mandments, it became expedient to preserve me for production
at the trial of Paoli. To the latter’s offer to renew his
adoption of me, the Coroner for a time turned a deaf ear, pro-
testing my abstract worthlessness for anything but show pur-
poses, to which base uses I came at last—with his approval,
and through the avarice of my foster-father’s ambition.
My career as a showman’s puppet was not of long dura-
tion, but it was certainly the most exciting period of my
existence. The spectators who abused me were in the
majority over those who spoke of me with tenderness; and
few indeed were those who showed a just appreciation of my
solid merits. On the other hand, the privileged conversations


which I was permitted to overhear (through the popular
ignorance of my possession of the sense of hearing), wove a
charm around the bleakness of my lot. I intended at one time
to give them a place in these memoirs, hut I have charitab y
expurgated them; their reproduction would only afford more
work for the lawyers —and Mr. Varley. . _
I may here state that the criminal proceedings instituted
against my foster-father were soon afterwards abandoned, Mr
G. B. Simpson, Attorney-General, declining to file any bi
against the accused. On receipt of this intelligence, Pietro
determined to proceed with me to Melbourne for the benefit of
our common health, Sydney being now too hot for us both.
The sea-voyage had very little effect on me, one way or
another; but with Pietro it served as a check-valve to his
recurrent spasms of drunkenness, “the dog having returned to
his vomit ” as soon as the terrors of the law loosened their
hold on his craven conscience. To me, his. abject surrender to
the dictates of sea-sickness was the occasion of much merri-
ment ; I fancy that the Alpha and Omega of his stomach had
never before come into closer contact, the era of his infancy
not excepted.
At Melbourne it was sought to make me the victim ot
an attachment which Iby no means reciprocated; and my
foster-father demurring, I was brought before the court and
locked up as a ward in Chancery. Inquiries were set afoot,
and soon unearthed the intelligence that I was the lawful son
and heir of a back-block squatter, named . To my
earlier expectations of proving myself the offspring of royalty
this was a decided chill; but even a squatter is better than a
sea-serpent. ,
Eventually the attachment formed for me was decided to be
unlawful and was dissolved by order of the court. My long-
lost parent willingly ceded me back to Pietro, who, hearing
that a Marble Woman had made her appearance in Sydney,
decided to chance climatic drawbacks and return there, with
a view of taking immediate advantage of the opportunity,
thus presented, of securing a periodical supply of pure-bred
petrifactions.


CHAPTER XVI.
HAVING VOLUNTARILY SUBJECTED MYSELF TO “A CHANGE OF
STATE,” I BRING MY LIFE HISTORY TO AN ABRUPT, BUT
APPROPRIATE, CONCLUSION.
UPON - our return to the city of skating rinks and schisms,
we lost no time in paying our respects to the Marble
Woman, who, on receipt of our cards, gave immediate
orders for us to be conducted to the cellar in which, by the
force of fate, she was then located.
With a flushed face and a fluttering heart, I entered the
presence of Her whom the Pates had ordained to become my
“ better half,” even if not literally “ flesh of my flesh and bone
•of my bone.” One shy glance at her modest face and melting
eyes, and I was hers for ever; my adamantine heart molten in
admiration of as sweet and charming a divinity in stone as my
orbits had ever encountered. The arch-rogue, Cupid, had —I
discovered—drawn upon me for a bill of affection in her favor,
payable at first sight.
My more prosaic foster-father merely surveyed her peerless
form with the eye of a geometric geologist, and then rudely
inquired “ who on earth she was.”
“ Alas ! ” said she, in dulcet tones that tickled my throbbing
heart, 11 1 thought all mankind was acquainted with my name
and misfortune. Next to Mrs. Eve, of Eden, I am the most
notorious and ill-fated woman in the world. I am—Lot’s
wife ; ” and so saying, she wiped away a gathering tear that to
others might have appeared briny, but to my eyes was as a
pearly dew-drop.
“ Wheugh! ” whistled Pietro, while my amorous ardour
suffered just the least sensation of an icy chill as I thought of
the elder Weller’s deprecation of elders and elderly widows.
“You seem struck with astonishment,” she modestly re


sumed, interpreting our countenances with, the sentient
keenness which characterises every member of our race.
«To confess the truth,” said Pietro, “ I did not expect to,
meet you here in a city cellar. I thought you were comfortably-
located in Asia Minor.” T i l, rln n a
“My story is as short as it is sad. When Lot bade u&
hurry up and emigrate from Sodom, I had to flee with what-
ever attire I could first lay my hands on. When we reached
the city boundaries, I heard shouts of feminine rejoicing. Bean
in mind I was only a woman, and with the instinctive curiosity of
my sex, I looked back, and —horresco referens /—I beheld one of
the silliest sluts in Sodom arrayed in my newest bonnet my
last Parisian gown, and my ball-room set of false teeth. I waa
so annoyed at the discovery that I stood rooted to the spot-as
petrified and immobile as a piece of corned beef. On lookiaff
to Lot for a display of sympathy with my suffering, I realised
that I was an abandoned woman. Sinking through the earth
with shame, I have since then passed from tier to tier, from
layer to layer, from stratum to stratum till yesterday I emerged
at Woolloomooloo —the exact antipodes of the spot on which X
originally petrified. That is the sad short sequel of my fatal
but feminine curiosity.” . ~
“ Well,” Pietro dryly observed, as if uncertain ot the
groundwork of his scheme, “ now you two have been thrown
together by fate, I think it would not be amiss if you entered
into everlasting partnership by getting spliced without delay.
“ I confess,” said Mrs. Lot, drooping her eyes, that we
appear made for one another, and that it really seems as if the
magnetic attraction of love had drawn us together. I have
hitherto moved in a superior stratum of society to what yom
friend is accustomed to, but there agam-even with such
unsentimental beings as we are—Love levels all layers.
And so, without further parley, it was agreed to have the
banns published at once, and the ceremony set down for that day
week, which binding engagement I and the captivating widow
“ cemented ” with a kiss, into which eaoh of us threw the full
flavour of our beings.
During the interval between the making of the match and


the date of its consummation, Pietro and Sybarita —who came
down in hot haste when she heard of my brilliant engagement
.—spared no pains to characterise the ceremony with the eclat
so extraordinary a union merited. Invitations were freely
disbursed among friends and acquaintances, and all the
politically halt, the socially lame, and the morally blind were
bidden to the marriage feast.
The majority of invited guests either came themselves or sent
proxies; very few sent apologies. Sir H —y P—s, it is true,
sent five-pence, and with it an intimation that “ occupying, as
he did, a position of great responsibility —responsibility equally
due to all sections of society —he felt that, as a member of the
Government, he could not, with propriety, take part in the
festive proceedings ; ” and the honorable B — S— regretted that
“ he was was but slightly acquainted with the merits of Marble
Women.” More substantial than sentimental, Mr. Franciscan
Abigail, regarding us as less popery than physical, sent the Union
a wedding present of a papal bull, which he had captured and
impounded whilst straying on the Protestant highway. Better
than all, the Honorable the Postmaster-General caused to be
sent to the festive ceremony a cable to the following effect: —
“ From Dan to Beer-sheba. The whole population of Australia
—including the Devil and Mr. Yarley—is prodigiously proud
of your maritime undertaking. Have caused a public holiday
to be proclaimed, and a day for thanksgiving to be set apart
in all the churches. Such testimony in favour of Hew South
Wales is certain to make Victoria cross.”
As some compensation for the cold-water thrown on the
projected union by any dignified absentees, it is worthy of
record that all my old friends —the anatomical absurdities
erstwhile referred to —secured “ the evening off ” from their
guardians at the Museum.
Apprehending that the sketch would be incomplete without
a reference to the bride’s apparel, I may observe that she was
becomingly attired in maritime silk, with pepper-and-salt
trimmings, and wore a wreath of seaw r eed, generously donated
by the younger of the mermaids. Sybarita and Miss Twinkle-
anshein, an accomplished Syrian lady, officiated as the brides*


maids—the latter attired in a lovely robe of Mount-Olive
green. _ .
As we toed the mark in front of the ecclesiastical exquisite to
whom the task of tying the knot was delegated, the historic
dignity of the proceedings sustained an affront by his solemnly
intoning the information—“ Man that is born of a woman, hath
but a few short ’’whereupon he stopped short and nervously
said, “ Excuse me ; the importance of the occasion rendered me
short minded, and I thought, for the moment, that the burial
service would be more appropriate.”
“It is only a distinction without a difference,” said a
courtly voice in the rear, and, looking back, I saw that Royalty,
in the petrified person of ‘Albert the Good,’ had deemed it
no derogation of dignity to be present at our conjunction.
«I think differently,” spoke up Sir Nineveh Melville (who
had on the previous day been knighted for his services in the
cause of Labor and Travel); “I’ve been the victim of a
practical joke, an anonymous letter having been sent to fore-
warn me that a ceremony of another character was on the
tapis. However, as I’m here, I ’ll enjoy myself as well as
the best of you,”—which he did, in a temperate, way, by
flirting desperately with the Mummy and the mermaidens.
Without further hitch we were duly hitched, and straight-
way repaired to the wedding feast. “ Due justice was done
(as provincial reporters say) to the rock-cod, the sand-mullet,
and the salt salmon, the last-named being of Mrs. Lot’s own
curing; and the meal finished up with a capital dessert of
pudding-stone, ancient dates, and the choicest wall-fruit.
After the feast, the clergyman retired, but before departing,
he handed us our marriage lines, which read as follows :
.< 0n an August day, by the Eev. Titus Abrick, Sandy McGregor, grand-nephew of
General Trappe-Eock, Commander of Her Majesty’s Land Forces, to Sal Ammoniac,
only surviving daughter of Chloride of Sodium, and relict of the late and highly-
respected Mr. Lot, squatter and grazier, of Padan-aran Plains. No cards. Home
papers please copy.”
After this, the bride insisted on winding up the proceedings
with “saltatory” diversion, and right merrily did the whole
company foot it until the wee sma’ hours of the morning.


Captain Cook opened the hall with the leading lady of the
Cheirotherium ilk, while the Mastodon whirled the Mummy
about “as if to the manor born,” The Moa danced a jig,
and one of the mermaids a sailor’s hornpipe, while Sir Nineveh
M. entered into Terpsichorean rivalry with the Plesiosaurus.
The latter’s cousin, the Ichthyosaurus, assisted Albert the Good
to dance a “Sir Roger de Coverley ” ; and the Sea Serpent
entwined himself in Sybarita’s affections during the mazy
measure of the giddy waltz —to the exceeding envy of Pietro,
who found solace for his jealous misgivings in copious draughts
of stone gin. During the interval between the dances, some
vocal music of an unique character was indulged in, and the
gem of the evening was voted to he the trio “ Auld Lang
Syne,” feelingly rendered by Miss Twinkleanshein, Mrs.
Pontiphar, and her whom they now speak of as nee Mrs. Lot.
Of course, there were one or two minor defaults in the
success of so impressive a ceremony, as, for instance, when
bricks instead of rice, were thrown after the departing turtle-
doves ; and, at early morn, Pietro —not sober enough to
recognise that he was no longer my propelling partner—sent
for the conventional wheelbarrow and insisted on trundling
Sybarita home in fleeting memory of the past. In his loco-
motions he ran down XXX 666, and, missing his skull, inflicted
irreparable injury on him with the wheel, thereby invaliding
the heroic policeman for life with the conjoint maladies of
spinal paralysis and hemorrhoids.
In the heyday of our honeymoon, I prepare to take my
leave of those who have followed my footsteps from the cradle
t 0 the 1 mean, to matrimony. With so matchless a
partner by my side, I am enabled to look on the future with
hope, and on the past with indifference. With the charming
prospect of gracing our household hearths with a marble boy
(the image of papa) and a petrified lass (so like mamma) our
marital felicity is truly trebled, and it would be odd indeed if
“ after life’s fitful fever,” we did not—like drunken sentry —
<l sleep well.”


CHAPTER XVII.
“ NUNC DIMIMITTIS."
THE time lias now arrived for me to bid farewell to those
to whom these memoirs of a “ blasted ” life have been
dedicated. “What!” inquires the patient reader,
“without a moral to the fable?” and expediency suggests an
affirmative answer. Begin at the thin end of a snake, and, as
you stroke his glossy skin, you expand in enconiums on its
soft, shiny, sleek and silky smoothness; but abruptly you end
your eulogy as you recognise that so much sleekness and soft-
ness end in a bag of venom. As the venom to the snake, so is
the moral to the fable.
Nevertheless, it is becoming in me, in the absence of any
special moral, to lay emphasis on the sage superiority and
serene supremacy of Marble Manhood. Join me in a philo-
sophic glimpse of the Australian world as it lays, literally at
our feet, and you will admit the accuracy of my contention. *
What a kaleidoscopic entertainment is ours ! Here we see,
in its naked deformity, this sphere of sweat and struggle —
with here and there an oasis of truth in an arid sweep of error.
The bitterest enemy of mankind is Man, and the religion of
humanity is rivetted to the rock of selfishness. Help yourself
and you will probably prosper; help others and you stand a
chance of being left to fall by the way. The Levites are many,
and the Samaritans are few.
Shake the kaleidoscope and inhale a definite glimpse. Here
you have what is termed the Political World. As you truly
observe, it is not a pleasant spectacle. If there were less
&
* Note.— This chapter is an intentional extravaganza, aimed only at the “ black
sheep” in the political, ecclesiastical, legal, judicial and commercial classes. For the
purposes of this sketch, it is necessary to treat the sins of the small minority as
emblematic of the class which they discredit. A petrified observer would naturally
follow the Virgilian precept—“ From one, judge all.” They do not represent the
writer’s opinions except from the standpoint of Marble Manhood.


riotous men in the foreground, it might well pass for a diorama
of Donnybrook Fair. The most prominent profess a Spartan
simplicity of public morals; claim to merit the mantles of
Brutus, Cato, or Cicero ; and loudly regret that they were not
en evidence when Diogenes was exploring with his cynic’s
lantern. Yes; it is decidedly amusing when we reflect that
many of them have long since lost their political virtue—
Judas-Iscariotised in the crucibles of cant and corruption.
What are they wrangling about now ? Now and always,
about Religion. Why so ? Simply because they have no reli-
gion themselves; wherefore the necessity of assuming a virtue
when they have it not —which is the first maxim in the primer
of politics. But see how the practice differs from the theory.
In theory, the test question is—Will you use your best endea-
vours to serve your country with fidelity, truth and honor P In
practice, the crucial inquiry is—Which God do you serve ?
The God of Rome or the God of ruiu-Rome ? And the candi-
date, inwardly serving no God at all, swears to outwardly serve
the God that he deems most politically profitable. And what
lip-service! Yerily, the candidate’s faith hath saved him; his
fanaticism hath made him holy whole. List to the sarcasm
with which he saturates his sneers at the faith of his Parlia-
mentary coadjutors. What is his title to mock the religion of
his rivals P The best of all titles—his own unquestionable irreli-
gion. Later on, the scales will fall from his eyes, and his soul
will enfranchise itself from the bile and bondage of bigotry;
too late to restore his lost political manhood —the sword of
Titus Oates, which he has been wielding so long against
others now turns against himself and cuts him off from the
people in cold contempt.
Yes ; these are the rulers of the populace —Cabinet Ministers
in esse or in posse. Here is one who is a specimen of the many.
Has he brains ? Very little, and that little uncultivated. Has
he brass ? Very much, and that much judiciously invested.
He has the sapience of his shekels, for, without the generosity
to give to the poor, he had the sagacity to lend to the political
Lord. Has he not therefore a pre-emptive right to his
portfolio P Like ’s baronetcy, it is his by purchase. What!


you argue that the public despise him on that account. Bah !
you do not know the masses so well as I do. “ Whene’er he
takes his walks abroad, how many poor he sees ; ” and nine
out of every ten of them present themselves with a petition
praying that he will kick them—for to he booted by constituted
or arrogated authority is, in their judgment, a boon which
uplifts them above such of their fellows as have rearward
spheres that do not itch for acquaintance with an official boot.
Sir Walter Raleigh is deemed a courtier because he sacrificed
his elegant cloak to spare Queen Bess from contact with the
slush of the common road. Better courtiers are the masses;
they humbly lay their bodies in the dust to enable their rulers
to walk over them dryshod.
Did you ever see a Cabinet constructed ? No! Well, Cabinet-
making is a special science, not a common trade. What is
Number One’s excellence ? Making soporific pills and ampu-
tating afflicted legs. Then make him Minister of Mines;
his unfitness is his fitness. No. 2 P He keeps a pop-shop.
“ Oh! my prophetic soul, mine uncle ! The very man foi
Colonial Treasurer. No. 3 ? He can cobble boots. Good,
make him first Lord of the Admiralty. No. 4? He is an
ex-policeman. Ah! a model Minister of Justice. No. 5 ?
He assists Capital to fight Labor. Excellent; give him the
portfolio of Works. No. 6 P Well, all his friends agree that
he is simply good for nothing. Eh! Is he rich ? Very.
Then send him to represent us in the Council. What gorgeous
fun to see the people pay while the politicians pipe ! Disgusts
you, does it, my rural Diogenes ? Well, give the kaleidoscope
another shake ; or rather, the better to effect our puipose,
give it a “ special cant.”
What a pretty prayerful picture! You are right—these
are the Clergy, who wear special habilments that they “ may
be known of men.” What are you shuddering at ? The red
spots on their canonicals. That is gore. You unsophisticated
man, do you not know that the clergy splash their surplices
with blood to express with emphasis their thirst for the lives
of malefactors ? What are you mumbling ? “ I will ha\ e
mercy, and not sacrifice.” Where did you read that ? In the


Bible. Ah! I thought it was not the utterance of the
colonial clergy. You have noted the two men in the back-
ground with repulsive faces and without canonicals. They
are, as yet, only honorary members of the corps clerical —no
nearer in affinity than accredited acolytes. Yes; they are —the
flogger and the hangman. The Christian Church finds them
meat and occupation.
Even there you lay your finger on the backbone of
Christianity, as presented to us in soulless skeleton form
by sanguinary exponents of the tender and merciful love
of Almighty Cod ! Why do we erect scaffolds ? Why do we
retain whipping-posts ? Why do we build and endow Poor
Houses ? To please the Clergy and High Churchmen. The
Anglican and Dissenting sections are the worst offenders
therein. Myself a Dissenter, I say so with regret. To
do the Priests justice, they are mostly ranged on the
humane side during conflicts for the blood of offenders.
As in Norman days, they stand between the rulers and
their victims. Their despotism is a benevolent one, so far
as repudiating the exaction of an “ eye for an eye, etc.,”
is concerned; and the statesman is right who, in combating
the politico-pugilism of their Church, finds just speech in
paying tribute to its practical piety. It is the Protestant
clergymen, unfortunately, who choose such texts as “ Why
should So-and-so escape the gallows,” or “I say unto you —Let
ns arise as one man, and demand that we be not cheated of
the blood of this woman ! ”
Hush! The Archdeacon has just entered the edifice; see
how he grovels to his more exalted brethren, and how his
humbler brethren grovel to him —that is true Christian
humility. He has just arrived from praying at the couch
of Lady Lamentation, who is groaning in the agonies of
tic-doloreux. Why is he mopping his forehead so vehemently ?
Poor man, he is tired; he had to hurry past the hovel of a poor
woman, who lay a-dying of consumption and semi- starvation,
accelerated by the illusage of a drunken husband; unless he
hurried, the neighbours might have begged him to enter and
soothe her dying agonies. Why was he reluctant to accept


the task ? What a question ! Why, because he is a Christian
clergyman, and being a Christian clergyman, he knows on
which side his earthly bread is buttered. You do not see the
Reverend T. B. Tress in this pragmatic ecclesiastic throng.
No; he is a practical humanitarian, hunting about in quest
of distress that, whqn found, he may alleviate it; the hair
of the Australian evangelical exquisite is graced with few
tresses. You have seen enough of this lot; give the kaleido-
scope an artful wriggle.
Who are these ? Pickpockets! No, my phrenological
genius, these are Lawyers —the flea-like units of a profession
so inherently tricky that a special Act of Parliament had
to be framed to confer the hall-mark “gentleman.” Are
they without their uses in this very funny world ? By no
means. If you have a foe you fear will rob you, employ a
lawyer to spare your foe the task. Thus will you enjoy a
hearty laugh at your enemy, and the lawyer a heartier laugh
at you both. Is this fair ? What odds ! It is strictly legal.
And legal will it ever be while the people are such Jubilee
Jugginses as to trust the manufacture of the Law to Lawyers.
Don’t let them catch you looking at them, or they will charge
us a guinea for every observation.
Who are the gorgeous Grorgons in the front rank of the
profession p Hush ! or they will pack you off to gaol for con-
tempt. These are the Judges, who have partitioned crime into
four groups —theft, violence, inchastity and contempt of court.
Be ye therefore wise in your generation, and strain a point
always to conceal whatever contempt you may have for a court
of justice. Well, what whimsical ideas get possession of you !
You thought they were Red Indians because their belts
are embellished with scalps. If you must know, there is
a tendency among some Judges, when they order a man or
woman to be hanged, to make it a point of personal honor to see
that he or she is hanged, even though they have to fly in the
teeth of the solemnly-expressed desire of the jury who con-
demned the culprit and carefully considered the case. This is
judicial reform with a vengeance. In capital cases there is now
seldom such a thing as trial by jury; it is trial by judge, and it


is whispered of some of the latter that they recount their
successes as often as a Sacristan enumerates his relics. Radical
folks say, too, that some of them are for electing a new patron-
saint by whom to model their judgments. Can you guess
whom ? Look at the picture of the Crucifixion for inspiration.
Our Saviour? No; but very near it; guess again. Pontius
Pilate. Correct.
Now give the instrument a solid, respectable shake, and
have a look at the silken swine—the dull-eyed and heavy-
browed pachydermata, that now appear. These are the mag-
nates of Commerce, who hold that Parliament should be a
drygoods warehouse, where you may measure out legislation
in the respectably hippopotamic style that you weigh out a ton
of tallow candles. Let a reformer tread on one of their tender
politico-commercial corns, and the modern Mompesson shows a
shivering inclination to retch as he shrugs his shoulders and
says, “He is without respectability; he says ‘ dammee.’”
Thereupon the magnate proceeds to seduce his friend’s daughter,
averts the shipwreck of his honor (?) by destroying the unborn
evidence of his crime; and again thanks Cod that he himself
is respectable and never says “ Dammee.”
Have you seen enough of this modest world of ours ?
Well, pull down the blind. Hold; I did not tell you to smash
the kaleidoscope. Righteous indignation! Ah, well, you
know now what I mean when I say that if you itch to see man
at the nearest point of perfection, you must wait till he is well
and truly petrified; and if you prefer to deal with Human
Nature in its thoroughly sinless stage, you can find it nowhere
else but in— “ The Marble Man.”
The End.
