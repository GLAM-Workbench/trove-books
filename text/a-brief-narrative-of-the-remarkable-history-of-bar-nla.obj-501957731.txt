A BRIEF NARRATIVE,
&c. &c.
“ Old friend, thy face is valanced since we met!”—Sharspeare.
SINCE I find it impossible to walk the streets
without exciting the curiosity of all who see me,
from my remarkable appearance, and not always
having an opportunity of satisfying them, I have
been advised by my friends to present the public
with a short account of my adventures since I first
left England, until my return from New Zealand,
and which I hope will prove acceptable to all who
may feel anxious to hear something about New
Zealand, as well as to those who may wish to have
an account of the circumstances which led to my
adoption as a Chief, by the Natives of that remark-
able Island. And as I aspire no further than to pre-
sent them with a plain statement of facts, 1 hope
some allowance will be made by my readers for
all deficiencies of style, only detailing, as I have
said before, the truth, without resorting to the aid
of imagination.
I left England in the year 1827, in the brig Wil-
ma, with Captain Teat, bound for Rio de Janeiro,
touching at the Western Islands. When we arrived
at Rio, or at least in a short time afterwards, all
hands were paid off from the ship, owing to some
dispute between the Captain and crew, the exact
cause of which I cannot at this period of time re-
A


member,; but, at all events, it was something of
very little consequence. I received a good character
from the Captain of the vessel, who was further kind
enough to recommend me to a gentleman, a mer-
chant of the name of Burke, through whose interest
in the course of a short time I procured a berth as
steward in the barque Nimrod, commanded by
Captain Illbeck, bound for Sydney, N. S. W.
When we arrived at Sydney, I told the Captain
that I should prefer stopping on shore to returning ;
he accordingly gave me my discharge, and also a
recommendation to a person of the name of William
Bunn, a merchant, who is since dead, through whose
interest I got a situation in the Bank of Australia,
under W. H. M’Kenzie, Esq. I stopped in his
employment for about two years, when 1, persuaded
by some of my old shipmates to join them in a voy-
age to New Zealand, told him it was my intention
to go to sea again; I therefore left that gentleman,
who behaved to me not only as a master, but acted
in every way as my friend.
I then joined the brig Elizabeth, Captain Browne,
hound on a trading voyage to New Zealand for flax.
We remained on that coast, and in the different
places adjacent, for nearly eight months, during
which time I had an opportunity of acquiring the
New Zealand language as fluently as my
own.
I took a great fancy to that part of the world:
in fact, so much so, that I made up my mind that
on my arrival in Sydney again, I would procure
a berth, if possible, as trading master, for any mer-
chant from whom I could get employment, either
to return or settle ashore, and trade on any of the
Islands, or stop on board of a ship ; but the former
appeared to me to be preferable. So accordingly


on my arrival at Sydney, I went to see my former
master, Mr. M’Kenzie. I told him my intention ;
he advised me to go if I thought proper, and re-
commended me to a gentleman of the name of B.
Montifier, who had just at that time formed an
establishment for the flax trade—at least he was
going to send persons down to New Zealand to
trade for flax for him. None but persons who
could talk the language were wanted; therefore I
was lucky enough to procure a berth with him, at
least under him, as a trading master. Ihe follow-
ing is a copy of the agreement made between Mr.
Montifier and myself:—
COPY.
»< It is hereby agreed between L. Baron Montifier, Esq. and
Barnet Burns, that the said Barnet Burns shall proceed in the
schooner Darling, now about to sail to the port of Maia, in New
Zealand, there and then to commence bartering with the Natives for
flax, &c. such trade* as may be shipped under his charge per said
vessel, and in fact to act as the sole and entire agent of the said
L. Baron Montifier, at the aforesaid port of Maia, or at any other
port or -place to which he may hereafter be directed to proceed. It
is also understood, that the said Barnet Burns is to be totally un-
connected with any other establishment at New Zealand, or else-
where : that of such trade as may from time to time be forwarded
to him, he'\s to render a just and true account; and that he is in
every way to use his utmost exertions to promote the interest of
his employer.
“ In consideration of which services, the said L. Baron Mon-
tifier hereby agrees to pay to the said Barnet Burns the sum of four
pounds per month, to commence from the date of his sailing from
* Articles for baiter, as tobacco, &c. &c.


Sydney, together with a commission of five pounds per cent,
on all flax, to be valued at twelve pounds per ton weight. Should it
be desired by the said Barnet Burns to relinquish the service of his
above-named employer, it is understood that the said J. B. Montifier
is to have sufficient notice of such intention, to enable him to send
a person down to take possession of whatever trade or flax might
be on hand. It is also expected that at such places as the said
B. Burns may remain for any length of time, he will make use of
every conciliating means in his power towards effecting a permanent
and friendly intercourse with the Natives, and that he shall obey
the instructions which may be from time to time forwarded to
him by the said J. B. Montifier.
“Signed in Sydney, the 12th day of February, 1831, in the
presence of &c. &c.
1 left Sydney, pursuant to agreement, in the
schooner Darling: and after a passage of fourteen
or perhaps a few days longer, we put into Corfier,*
to land another trading master in that part of the
Island. We lay in Corfier River for about a month,
until there was a house built to put the trade into
that was for that part. We got all the trade for
that place ashore safe, and every thing then seemed
as if things were going to turn out favourably.—
While we lay in this River a great number of the
Natives used to resort to the vessel to see her, and
try to get things out of her; I do not mean to say
steal anything out of the vessel, for they were then
certainly rejoiced to see not only the ship, but the
captain and crew. After the expiration of a month
we sailed for Mocaw, there to land another trading
master. Nothing occurred here worthy of par-
ticular mention, only that we landed the man and

liis trade ashore safe, and had a house built for
him. We then touched at Taranackia, to see the
state of the white people and Natives there, who
informed us that they were on friendly terms with
each other at that part, but expected to have a war,
or at least to be disturbed by other tribes, who it
appears had made up their minds to plunder them.
We next touched at Entry Isle, and procured pro-
visions. We remained there but a short time.—
When we started from thence, we went through
Cook’s Straits to get to the east side of the Island ;
and after an absence of four months from Sydney,
I arrived at my destination, Maia, where 1 landed,
without a house being ready, a complete stranger,
not a white man to he seen, notone residing within
two hundred miles of me. The vessel only re-
mained here two days, when she sailed for the Bay
of Islands : therefore I was under the necessity of
landing my trade in canoes, and leaving it in one
of the Native Chief’s huts. So, here I was amongst
a set of Cannibals, trusting wholly and solely to
their mercy, not knowing the moment when they
might take my trade from me, and not only my
trade, but my life. Directly I landed here, the
Chief, whom I had particularly selected to trade
with, left me; so I had the whole charge on my
own hands. I was obliged to carry my musket,
and constantly sleep with it by my side. In fact,
I had to keep watch all the time. Then for the
first time since I took my fancy to visit New Zea-
land, I felt frightened at my situation : I knew I was
not sure of my life an hour.
In the course of a few days, my trade Chief re-
turned with a large quantity of flax ; I traded with
him, by giving powder, muskets, shot, blankets,
tobacco, &c. I did all in my poAver to please the


Natives, who were very soon delighted with me.
I stopped here for nearly eleven months before I
received any news from my employer, when at last
a vessel arrived from Sydney, sent down to receive
the stock that I might have on hand. At the time
the ship arrived, it was a poor time for the trade in
this place;* so they had orders to take away the
trade. The following is a copy of a letter that I
received from Mr. Montifier :
“ Mr. Burns,
« Sir,
“ I have authorized Mr. Sims to make such arrange-
ments with you relative to your stay, removal, or otherwise, at New
Zealand, as he may deem most proper.
“ I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
“ L. Baron Montifier.”
On receiving this letter I gave up all the flax and
remaining trade to Mr. Sims, which I must say gave
me a great deal of trouble. The Natives, when
they found the trade was going to be removed, grew
quite cross ; indeed they felt inclined for plunder.
On one occasion, a cask of powder was got fiom a
person, a Native, who was in the act of stealing it;
but, however, he was detected, and severely pun-
ished, according to their laws and habits.
At this time I was under the protection of a
Chief of the name of Oyer, who had a great regard
for me. The fact is, I had married his daughter,
who at the time the ship arrived was on the point
of being confined. For which reason I was obliged
to make a settlement with Mr. Sims, and take trade
in lieu of the money due to me.
* I mean Mala.


The vessel soon after sailed, and 1 was left be-
hind. Words cannot express in what state my
feelings were ; suffice it to say, that it would have
been better if 1 had been dead. The ship which
contained all my friends and countrymen leaving
me, at one side, and on the other, my wife who
would not quit her native country ; and as she
was on the point of lying in, I could not bring my-
self to leave the country with the ship.
In two days after the vessel sailed, all the men
belonging to the tribe, whose protection I was un-
der, went to cultivate their potatoe gardens, which
are generally some distance from their pas* not
expecting any danger to occur either to me, my
wife, or any of the tribe that remained at home,
who were but few.
On the morning after the tribe went farming,
as I have mentioned before, I was told by a person,
who acted as a servant of mine, that he had bad
news for me. I asked him what it was, and he
told me that he had overheard a conversa-
tion between some persons who came for the ex-
press purpose of seeing whether the tribe was
away or not, that they might be enabled to plun-
der the trade that I had. I did not conceive for a
moment that they ever intended to serve me so; but
they were jealous of the tribe I had stopped with,
whom they imagined had advised me to send away
the ship, and all the trade, as they had enough for
themselves. And for that reason they were de-
termined to have all the trade that was left be-
hind for themselves, or die in the attempt. This
intelligence gave me a great deal of uneasiness. I
had ventured much for what little I had; I had

struggled hard for it by night and day; and for
1 W ° S determined 1 would perish in its
I acquainted my chief with the affair. He began
to cry when I spoke to him about it; and told me,
tliat his tribe was so far distant, that it would be
no use trying to defend the property I had, for it
certainly would be taken from me, and not only
that but my life very likely. The only plan that
' se l w , a \ for me to get a large war canoe,
mic take the best part of my trade along with me
and proceed to Poverty Bay, where I could be pro-
tected by his friends. We accordingly got a canoe
ready and loaded her as much as we could. I, my
rM r I athcr ’ and some of his s,aves embarked,
and bid the rest of the persons whose husbands’

and shewed us their sorrow at parting, by crying
and cutting themselves with flint glass until thf
nlood came streaming from them ; it grieved them
so much that we should leave them for the want of
protection.

that we were forced to run for a place called Whar/yl

nV 6 /, to dme ie was Jarful that the tribe
would follow me by land, and therefore would have
a chance of catching me. All hands went on shore
but myself and wife, who were obliged to sleep in
the canoe all night. 1
an ?" ttr n fo, ! oWine: , mornin S we put to sea again,
and steeied for a place called Wyshee; a place
which when I had arrived at, I could not leave
QW.mg to the sea running into the bay so very


heavily ; therefore, I was obliged to haul my canoe
up out of the water, and allow the Natives, (who
were my Chief’s relations, and who flocked around
me in hundreds,) to carry my property forme, whic i
they had to do for nearly thirteen miles through the
country, before I arrived at Poverty Bay, the pla
I intended to go to. When I got there I was re-
ceived comfortably enough ; they said, they would
encourage me in the trade, supply me with victuals,
and protect me to the last moment of their lives.
I only remained here twenty-four hours aftei my
arrival, when I proceeded about twelve miles fur-
ther into the country, as I was advised it would be
the best and most secure place for me to remama,
their strongest pas being in that place,
arrived at the pas, I was very well received, the
Natives were overjoyed to think that I had made
my escape from the Wattihahilties , who were de-
cidedly enemies on both sides. i
I had nothing to do here for some time after I
arrived, therefore I had an opportunity of viewing
this part of New Zealand which I think is the fi-
nest and most beautiful of all the !s and ; at least
what I saw of it. Here I found plenty of game,
such as ducks, pigeons, and other kinds of buds
plenty of pork, potatoes, melons, and Indian
Lrn; Y in fact every kind of vegetable in abundance.
I remained in this place about three we eks,wlienl
heard there was a white man at a place called Whe-
rowhero ; I intended to go to see him, but I was dis-
aonointed on account of some trouble aiising be-
tween the Natives who had heard that another tribe
about twenty miles off were come to war with them.
It was now for the first time I went to battle, it

being my Chief’s* particular wish for me to accom-
pany him. I needed but very little pressing to take
this step, as I thought it was better to go than stop
behind by myself. I gave them all the muskets I
had, also all the powder and shot belonging to me.
b>o we set out from here for a place called Mari-
a a the; I dare say nearly seven hundred of us. We
had to strike right through the country about twen-
ty miles, where we heard the enemy were. On the
evening we arrived, we perceived a great deal of
smoke arise at different places, from which we
thought the enemy were not far off.
I will now give you a slight instance of New
Zealand sagacity. We had a dog along with us,
a common thing amongst New Zealanders, who
generally take these animals with them when they
aie going to war. I should have mentioned before,
that we intended to lay in ambush the night we
perceived the smoke; but the dog having made its
way right to where the enemy lay, and the enemy
finding it to be a strange dog seized it, and made
it fast round the leg with a piece of cord, by which
ineans, with the help of a person who was piloted
by the dog, they discovered where the whole of us
Jay, and took the opportunity of making their es-
cape, for when we came on the following morning
to where we thought they were, we found them
gone. We pursued them, but could only take four
peisons, who were some of the slaves that were em-
ployed carrying their provisions. They were shot
and devoured; on which the tribe performed a warf
dance, and then proceeded towards home again.
* 1 being then regularly ruled by a Chief.
t A dance to denote their joy at conquering the enemy , they
perform it before and after battle.


When we arrived home every thing went on plea-
santly enough. I stopped nearly six weeks trading,
and procured a great quantity of flax and pigs. I
agreed with my Chief that he should take care of
the stock belonging to me, while I would proceed
on land with some of the slaves, and purchase some
more flax, as I expected a ship in the course of a
short time to arrive, which caused me to be in a
hurry to collect all the flax I could, as I was then
trading on my own account.
I went on land about twenty-eight miles, to a
place called Muthlia , where I remained some time
procuring flax. I bought a great quantity of flax
here, but unluckily a jealousy took place between
the Knightarangy tribe and the tribe I was with.
They came upon us and attacked us. There were
not many of us to be sure, but, however, we gave
battle to a man, were beaten, and every soul killed,
and not only killed, but eaten except myself, whom
they spared, making a prisoner of me, thinking
thereby to procure a ransom from my Chief for me.
They took me along with them in the bush ; they
had no houses belonging to them, being a regular
wandering tribe.
While I was amongst these people, I got particu-
larly acquainted with a female of rank, who told
me that it was her father’s wish that I should act
as a friend to him ; by so doing, he would make me
a Chief, would give me land, pigs, and property
of different kinds. She also told me, the others
belonging to the tribe had a great spite towards
me; and should they have an opportunity, would
certainly kill me; for which reason, I had better not
leave the rendezvous at all, unless in company witli
her father, who was head chief amongst them, or
in her own company.


I must note one thing, that is, a Chief’s daughter
has that superiority over her meaner subjects, that
if there were vengeance sworn by any persons
against another, and they were in act of killing him,
by such female running and putting her mat over
such person’s head, it would at once prevent the
murder taking place.
I was here but a very few days, when I made my
mind up to escape from them, I was so uncomfort-
able, but I was so closely watched, it was out of
the question to attempt it. They could see by my
manners that I was no way inclined to stop with
them, and would often say, “ What is the matter
with you? You may think yourself happy that we
do not kill you !” Others again when they had an
opportunity, would spit in my face, and tell me they
would eat my very heart the first opportunity they
had. I was afraid to complain of them, because it
would only cause some of them being put to death,
and by that means get me into fresh trouble.
I will now proceed to relate, how, when, and
where, I first got to be marked, or more properly
speaking tattooed. When I found there was no
chance of making an escape, I tried to make them
all think that I was getting very partial to them, and
by that means I found that I was both loved and
respected by them. On one occasion the Chief took
an opportunity of telling me, that it was the wish of
the other Chiefs under him, not his own, that I
should allow myself to be tattooed after the manner
of his subjects. I asked them what was the reason
for wishing it. He told me it was merely to make
sure I should stop along with them, bring them
trade, fight for them, and in every way make myself
their friend. I told this old man who had a great
legard for me, that I did not fancy the tribe; I


could not stop along with them; that I was losing
a good deal of time by stopping with them; and
that I never gave them reason to serve me so. I was
losing all my trade; I was losing my time. In fact,
I told them that I should kill myself, if I could not
ffct away. The old Chief began to ciy, and told me
that though he was head Chief, in such cases he
could not make those that were under him do as he
thought proper; that he would ellect all in his
power forme, but he was greatly alarmed thatotheis
would find an opportunity to have my head ; though
this should never be done with his consent. He
therefore advised me to take caie of myself, and
consider what was best to be done.
In the course of about three weeks after I was
brought here, I met one day a gang of persons in the
bush, as I happened to be out fowling. They came
up to me, and said, “ Now my fine fellow, we have
got you, you shall never lend a hand to kill any of
our relations again.” I cocked my piece, and told
them to fire, if they were inclined to kill me. At
that moment one of them stepped towards me, and
told me, that if I would fight for them I should not
be injured. I told him I would, “then” says he,
«*• you must let yourself be tattooed the same as we
are.” I expressed my readiness; at which there
was nothing but exclamations of joy amongst them.
They lifted me up on their backs and carried me
to their settlement. They told the old Chief that
they had brought me to an agreement—that I was*
to fight for them, and was to be tattooed as a pledge
of my sincerity that I would act as then friend; f'oi
which reason they would prove true to me, and
would give me any thing that they had. 1 con*-
sidered in my own mind, that I had bettei agiee to
their wishes ; as I could plainly see it was out of my


power to make an escape. I did not know whether
my own tribe would find me or not, nor whether I
might not fall in the hands of a strange tribe, per-
haps that might behave worse to me; so for the
purpose of getting extra liberty I told them they
might commence tattooing me as soon as possible.
They immediately began the operation the priest
cutting in the flesh with bone instruments, which
was horribly painful.
In seven days after they commenced,* I took the
opportunity one night, while it was raining, (you
will read in any history of New Zealand, what an
aversion the Natives have to night travelling) to
make my escape ; and on the following morning, I
could perceive from the top of a mountain, that I
w r as but a short distance from where my wife and
friends were: but then it was terrible travelling,
nothing but bush ; in addition to which, I was not
very well supplied with shoes, the fact is, I was
barefooted. It took me three days to reach home
as I had several round-about ways to go, to avoid
being seen by the Natives, several of whom were
in search of me; I mean the tribe from whom I es-
caped. When I arrived where my friends were, I was
received with the greatest joy : there was nothing
to be heard hardly but the firing of musketry.
I mentioned before, on my leaving Maia, that the
Natives there to shew their grief cut themselves
with glass; the same thing is done both for joy and
grief: many of them crying and cutting themselves
terribly with flint glass, which was always done
against my will, but that was no use, it was their
fashion, and they would not, nor could they be per-
suaded to drop it.
* l should mention I was about one quarter tattooed here.


They all flocked round me, inquiring howl was?
how the rest of their friends were ? and what kept
me so long? whether I had good luck in trade or
not ? how I came to be tattooed, &c. I told them
I had been taken prisoner; that their friends were
all killed ; that my flax* was all burned, and I was
obliged to submit to them by letting myself be
tattooed. Directly they heard it, they swore ven-
geance against the perpetrators of such deeds; and
accordingly there were sixty men picked out, well
armed, to go to the very spot from which I had
escaped, according to my directions. I stopped at
home myself, being unwell, or else I should cer-
tainly have gone along with them. These men were
to search for the persons with whom I had been,
detained ; and if they could, were to return with
the heads of every one whom they might kill; but
however, in this point they were mistaken, for the
enemy when they found I had made my escape,
knew what would occur, and for that reason left
their abode, at least, their place of rendezvous : so
that when my friends arrived there, all the satis-
faction they had was to take away four pigs that
were left behind—any thing in the way of plun-
der, particularly from an enemy, being sweet to a
New Zealander. After an absence of five days,
they returned again, and informed us of all that
passed. I remained there for some time trading,
and got a good deal of flax.
I should have mentioned before, that when I re-
turned from the Knightarangys, I went to see the
white man that I alluded to, who was trading for
another person; to whom I sold all the flax and
other articles that I had in the way of trade, for
money, some tobacco, powder, and other things
necessary to carry on trade.
* I had a good deal of that article when I was taken prisoner.


I went some time after up Tooronga river, about
three miles distant to buy some flax. They were
in my debt, as I had advanced them trade before,
and when they came to make a muster of what
flax they had, I found it was not near enough to
pay me. They then went about half a mile up the
river to get some more flax: I remained behind
with what flax I had got in my canoe. They had
been but a few minutes gone when I heard the noise
of musketry. I asked some of the persons that
remained behind what was the matter? They told
me, they expected it was a quarrel; and in a short
time returned, and told me they were fired at by
the Walkathowas , (a tribe consisting of about four
hundred men, women, and children,) and could not
settle with- me then; but if I would call again,
they would be happy in doing so.
I left these people, and proceeded down the river
again with my flax. These persons, who were
called the Biddiraakos, directly I left them, went
and made every kind of arrangement for storming
the pas belonging to the Walkathowas, and accord-
ingly they sent word to the tribe that I was along
with, and told them that they wanted help; they
also told several other tribes the same: and the
Jesuit was, they all agreed to go and kill every one
belonging to the Walkathowas tribe, if they pos-
sibly could do so; and I amongst the rest was one
who was particularly requested to go by all parties.
I consented ; so we set out, I having the command
of about one hundred and fifty men. There were
about six hundred men altogether. We marched
to the Walkathowas pas, which was very strong:
we surrounded it three weeks, during which time
there were several persons shot and devoured.
The mode of warfare of the New Zealanders is


simply this. When they are attacked by a strange
tribe, they fly directly to their pas, where they stop
if they do not conceive themselves able to face their
enemy : and such was the case with the Walka-
thowas. There were a few, certainly, that came
out, but it was to search for provisions ; a very
good reason, after being about three weeks confined
within the limits of a pas, only about a quarter ot
a mile round, with a beautiful river close to it;
but they generally paid dear for their temerity. 1
will relate one instance;
Two days before the pas was taken, one ot the
principal Chief’s wives tried to make her eacape,
by attempting to swim across the river; but un-
fortunately for her she was taken, and made a
prisoner of. They then took her away about a
quarter of a mile from her pas, and informed her she
was to be killed and eaten. Each of the principal
Chiefs then began to bespeak their part of the body
in the presence of the woman. One said he would
have a leg, another said, he should have an arm,
another her heart, &c. &c., until she was fairly
shared out amongst them. When this was done she
was ordered to go to the river, and wash a quantity
of potatoes. Whilst this unfortunate woman was
away, the Natives made a large hole, the same kind
as I spoke of before, for cooking in the bush, and
got every thing ready for cooking her. On the
woman’s return, she was told the oven was getting
ready for her. She said, it could not be helped.
She was then ordered to prepare for cooking. I
affirm positively, that I saw this woman gather
green leaves, lay them down on the hot stones, tie
both her legs together herself, and then ask one ot
the party to tie her hands. When this was done
she took a friendly leave of two or three persons that


she knew, and threw herself down on the leaves.
When she was over the fire, she begged some of the
party would knock her brains out; but they would
not: they kept heron the fire for a few minutes,
then laid potatoes over her, and covered her up
with earth (aye, before life was half gone), until she
was cooked fit for eating. I assure you, so sweet is
the flesh of a New Zealander (an enemy) esteemed
by these people, that part of this woman’s body was
sent upwards of three hundred miles off to other
friends, merely that they might have a taste.
These unfortunate persons after being attacked
all day by the persons outside the pas , would in the
night time allow the enemy to come and trade with
them; such as giving mats for something to eat,
flax for a little powder; so that by trading in the
night time, in this kind of way, my friends had an
opportunity of seeing which would be the best way
of gaining admittance. They formed the plan of
making a complete rush; and all proceeding at
once, with the help of a tomahawk, to cut an
entrance through the pas, which is constructed of a
large fencing, made fast together with vines. They
did so; we effected an entrance, and made every
soul it possessed prisoners, about four hundred in
number. When they brought the prisoners out,
they were all regularly shared between each tribe ;
and I myself was an eye-witness to about sixty
being killed and eaten.
I will here mention how and in which way dead
bodies are cooked for eating, as many perhaps never
read before of such a thing. I shall relate this as
plain as I possibly can, and mention nothing but
truth. In the first place, if a man of any con-
sequence is killed, a person of any rank, his head is
generally cut off, and saved to be sold in the way of


trade to the shipping, or in any other way in which
they may dispose of such heads ; the bodies they cut
up in quarters, something like the way you see a
pig cut up by a butcher. They are not very par-
ticular about washing their provisions, at least they
are not particular in washing human flesh ; but just
as the piece is cut off they cook it, not one single
particle of the body goes to waste. Their fashion
of cooking is this They dig a large hole, in which
they light a fire. They have got a particular kind
of hard stone, (and in case they should be short of
stone, they use a sort of hard mud), they put these
stones in this fire until they become red hot ; and
when that is the case, they cover the stones with a
kind of leaf: they then take the meat, or carcase
whichever it may be, and lay it down on these
leaves, and then put their potatoes on the top of the
meat, which they coverall over with other leaves,
and then fill the hole up with damp clay, until the
steam which is confined underneath the earth com-
pletely cooks it. This may appear to some persons
a curious way of cooking; but I can assure them,
in such a way they can cook a most beautiful dinner
if they have a mind to take a little pains. For my
part 1 have cooked pork and potatoes as completely
in this manner as ever I have eaten them cooked in
Europe. They serve up their victuals in baskets,
made of flax, which they are very particular in
having clean ; indeed, so much so, that they get a
new set of baskets every time they sit down to their
victuals. This is the only thing they are particular
in with respect to either eating or drinking. They
have also a method of preparing human flesh, for
the purpose of travelling; which is done by making
a fire underneath a grating of vines : they then lay
the flesh over the smoke of the vines, until it is per


feclly smoked, without the help of salt ;* they then
put it in the sun until it becomes quite dry. Such
is the way they get meat ready for travelling. I
have given a description now of their manner of
cooking, and shall proceed to my return home to
my friends.
About three weeks after we arrived, a vessel called
the Prince of Denmark, came from Sydney, with all
kinds of trade on board. The captain asked me, if
I had been trading for any person lately. I told him
I had not; therefore, I engaged with him for the
sum of three pounds a month, and no per centage
on flax. He agreed with me to go about thirty
miles further along the coast, where my wife’s
brother lived, to a place called Youkawa , it being
the most likely place at that time of the year for a
good flax trade. The captain left me to take the
trade ashore, and proceed to Youkawa in a canoe,
as I was not ready to start exactly at the same time :
so accordingly, he sailed for some other part of the
coast. In the course of two days afterwards, I pro-
ceeded in a canoe with my wife and child, and her
two brothers, together with slaves enough for the
management of the canoe. When I arrived here, I
found one white man trading for Captain Kent,
who remained at one side of the river, which is a
beautiful one, and I on the other; but still one
tribef only divided, or at least, commanded by two
brothers.
I remained here for some time; I dare say
nearly three years, during which time I was con-
stantly trading for one person. I sent during this time
* New Zealanders do not like salt; for that reason, they say White
men do not eat as well as New Zealanders.
tThe name of this tribe Hooringawherea,


about 107 tons of flax up to Sydney. The Vessel
had been sent to me three times ; but hearing such
bad news from New South Wales of the distress of
England, I was determined then on never leaving
New Zealand; and for that reason I did all m my
power to please the Natives.
This was the place where I enjoyed happiness;
this was the place where I was tattooed; at least,
where the remaining part of my face was marked,
and not only my face but my body. Ido not mean
to say, I have been tattooed altogether against my
will, as I submitted to have the latter part done.
In fact, I thought within myself, as one part of my
face was disfigured, I might as well have it done
completely, particularly as it would be of service
to me, and so it was. In the hrst place, I could
travel to any part of the country amongst my friends
if I thought proper. I was made and considered
Chief of a tribe of upwards of six hundred persons,
consisting of men, women, and children. I could
purchase flax when others could not.
was as well liked amongst the rest of the Chiefs, as
though I had been their brother.
During the time I remained here, a messenger
came to me, and told me there were three of my
countrymen some distance off to be killed. I en-
quired the circumstances, which were as follows
A Whaler* had put into the East Cape for pro-
tons. During her stay there, three of the crew
ran away. In return, the captain of the ship seized
fifteen of the Natives, and took them away they
could not tell where, until news came afterwards by
land that the men were landed at the Bay of Islands.
• i f org et the ship’s name, also the captain’s, but she was a Strang,©
° whaler, at least an English whaler.


But before this was known, the Natives on shore
were determined on killing the white men. They
were confined by one of the greatest tyrants of a
Chief on that part of New Zealand, of the name of
Cotahrow. When I had all the information I re-
quired about them, I gave orders to my tribe, and
told them to get a canoe ready ; to get themselves
well stocked with arms, and to prepare to come
along with me to rescue my countrymen. The mo-
ment they got the word, every one seemed to me to
be as anxious to go as I was myself. Such was the
regard they had for me. I, and sixty of the ablest
men, most of whom were Chiefs, manned a canoe,
and went directly to the East Cape after them, a
distance of about thirty leagues. We had two days
fair wind ; mid on the third day arrived there, at
least as close as we could get by water. When we
got on shore we hawled our canoe up in the bush,
and covered her over with leaves. We then
marched up the pas where the men were confined,
a distance of about six miles. We were on very
good terms with these people before this affair took
place. We went direct into the pas, where we were
received with the greatest civility, every thing as
amiable as possible. All we could expect was pre-
pared for us; such as a supper of pork, potatoes,
pumpkins, &c., not knowing at the time what our
business was. After supper, I took the opportunity
of making our business known. I enquired of the
Chief before mentioned, “ if he knew anything of
three men who had run away from a whaler ?” (It
is the fashion of a New Zealander, when he speaks
about any thing particular, to study a long time
before he makes an answer. On a sudden, he rises
up, and begins his conversation in a passionate kind
of manner, at first; then, by degrees he gets calm.


and then sits down : his friends get up, in the same
kind of way, and speak to the same purpose.) He
told me I could not see the men. He said he had
sent the men away, that he was determined on
keeping the men, as payment for the Natives that
were taken away from him. I then began to reason
with him ; and told him he could not blame the
men that run away from the ship ; the captain was
the person to blame ; but, however, he insisted on
keeping the men, and would not give me the least
satisfaction more about the affair. When I found
this was the case, I walked out of the house, or
rather hut, and strayed about for some time, until it
got dark. I then met a child, and took the oppor-
tunity of asking it a few questions, (knowing it to be
the only way in which I could find where the men
were confined.) The child did not know me from,
a New Zealander, and the question and answer
were as follows: “My boy, do you know where
the white men are ?” “ Yes; they are over there,
pointing to a hut at the opposite side of the pas.
I ran directly, burst in the door, and there I found
three persons almost naked, whom I accosted in
the following manner: “How do you get on.
Countrymen ? How long have you been here .
They said they were miserable; they had been
there these six days, and were receiving informa-
tion every day that they were to be killed, and
begged of me, if it was in my power, to save
them. I told them I would see what I could do
with the Chiefs, by paying a ransom; I had nothing
at present to pay for them ; but, however, they
should not be killed until my return. I went into
the house again where the Chief was, and spoke to
him as follows : “ Will you give those white men
up to me? If you do, I will return you a compli


merit.” He said, it was hard to ask the like of
him, and told me to consider. I then told him if
he would give them up to me, I would give him a
musket for one, a blanket for another, and a small
keg of powder for another. He considered for
some time and at last asked me if I told a lie or
not ? I told him it was the truth. He said he
would let his friends know of it, and if they would
agree to it, he should be satisfied. I then sent one
of my acquaintances, a Chief, along with him, and
told him to encourage the others as much as he
could. When he came back he told me to make
myself contented about the men, as I should have
them on the terms before-mentioned, but he should
go along with them in his own canoe, and that I
must be satisfied to agree to those terms; that I
should pay the articles I promised to him when
he took the men to my house; and in default
of payment, that he should return with the men
back again to his own place. I told him every
thing was perfectly correct; he should be well
satisfied for his trouble, or else it should be mv
fault. J
So on the following morning we started; his
party in one canoe, and I along with my company
in the other. We had a strong North East wind,
and run along at such a rate, that we arrived at
Voukawa on the third morning; the wind being,
as I said before, from the N. E. set a very heavy
swell into the Bay, and our companions not being
very well acquainted with the harbour, got aground
on the bar, capsized, and in less than twenty minutes
every single thing belonging to the canoe, and the
canoe itself, along with the white men who came
on shore, as well as the New Zealanders themselves,
were all instantly made a prize of. (It is a law of


the New Zealanders, that if their most sacred friend
is wrecked, he is made a lawful prize of: eveiy
thing is taken away from him in the way of pro-
perty, and the captives can do whatever they think
proper about it afterwards —a regulation that gene-
rally causes a war among the Natives to get their
property back again ; but, however, it was not the
case in this affair.) The Chief was quite willing
I should hold the men for nothing, if I would use
my exertions to get him his canoe and pioper y
back again, which was done the moment 1 ordered
it, and the next day he took his departure tor his
own place. Thus fortune favoured me ; for it was
not in my power to pay for them, though I was
determined they should never leave me when once
I got them on shore, even if war should be me
result of it. These men afterwards went up to
Sydney, in the Byron Schooner.
I remained at home after this for nearly six
months, when a vessel called the “ Bardaster
of Liverpool, commanded by Captain T. J. Chal-
mers, arrived off the Bay, early one morning. A
the moment the vessel was reported, I launched a
canoe, (I had no idea, she being such a large vessel,
that she had any commands for me,) and went on
board; when, to my surprize, I found my em-
ployer’s agent on board, who enquired of me how
much flax I had for him. I told him, and he said,
that I must remain with it, and wait till the return
of another vessel, which was coming down with
trade. I told the agent I was determined on going
to Sydney. When he found that was the case, he
told me that I should have to pay the sum of five
pounds for a passage. I then told him it was rathei
hard to serve me so; but, however, as I wanted to
have a settlement in Sydney, with my employer, I

Natives came off to the ship; I suppose not less than
fifty canoes came off, full of men and women, who
immediately came on board. One of these persons
told me she had something to say m private; and
when I inquired of her in her own language, what it
was ?—she told me that she heard the men saying,
as there were not many hands on board the ship,
they would take her; there being plenty ot hie
arms and other property on board the ship, that
would be of great service to them. The moment
I got a hint of this, I acquainted the captain, and
advised him to get a line drawn across the quarter
deck and stationed a man with a loaded musket
to keep sentry and send the Natives on shore
which was immediately done. I then invited the
principal Chief and his son, into the cabin, to take
some grog; and when I got him there 1 kept him,
but did not let him know my intention for doing so,
but told him I should like his company until morn-
ing, to talk to him about other parts of New Zea-
land. He seemed to be perfectly satisfied. I then
came out of the cabin and ordered all the Natives
on shore. Directly they heard me speak the lan-
guage they were quite surprised. I insisted on their
going, and when they found I was resolute, they
immediately quitted the ship.
About twelve o’clock the following day, several
boats arrived with whalebone, brought on board
by two Europeans for trade. When all the whalebone
was on board, we got under weigh for New South
