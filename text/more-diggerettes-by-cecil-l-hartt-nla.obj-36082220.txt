Shortly after his arrival in France, General Per-
shing was talking to an English “Brass-hat,” when
a Digger sauntered by. “To what nationality does
that chap belong?” asked Pershing. “Oh, he’s an
Australian, ’ ’ said Brass-hat. ‘ ‘ But he didn’t salute, ’ ’
complained the Yank General. “That’s nothing,”
replied the other. “Why, they’re wonderfully good
to what they were. At one time they would have
knocked yon over—now they go round.”
Digger: “Speak English, Madamzell?”
French Lady: “Un vairy, vairy leetle, M’sieur.”
Digger: “That’s oright, you’ll do me! Now will
you put me wise about where I can grab a bosker
blow-out? I’m as empty as a drum.”
French Lady (highly tickled): “Oh, M’sieur is
vairy drole. Ne comprend pas. ” .
Digger (as he walks off): “That’s the worst of
them French tabs. . They look oright, but they’re
as ignorant as blanky bandycoots. ”

Heard a Padre reading a Digger a lecture on the
evils of cards and gambling. Digger staggered the
sky-pilot by informing him that a euchre party was
even mentioned in the Bible, and that Neb-euchred-
Nezer.
First Digger: “Saw yer with a new cobber, Joe.
What sorter bloke is ’e?”
Second Digger: “A real tony sorter cow. Too
perlite fer me. Went inter a joint and ’ad some
cawfee, an’ it bein’ ’ot, I pours mine inter me saucer
and blows it to make it cool; but ’im! Struth, ’e
pours ’is inter ’is saucer an’ fans it with ’is ’at!”

Returned Light Horse Digger: “In war you rea-
lise the speed of a bullet. It’s so quick that it’s
past you before you hear the sound.”
Interested young thing: “Good gracious! It
would catch you however fast you ran, wouldn’t
it?”
Sister (observing a strip of bare skin along pa-
tient’s waistline): “Come here, Private Hardcase,
and I’ll mend your shirt.”
Digger: “Oh, it’s orlright, Sister. It’s a Manx.”

First Digger: “You and I have got these ’ere
profiteers beat, Dig.”
Second Digger: “ ’Ow’s that?”
First Digger: “Well, we both take the same size
in boots; what’s wrong with goin’ ’alves in a pair,
eh?”
Ist Digger (in England): “Wot a funny coat the
kid’s wearin’J”
2nd Digger: “That’s an Eton jacket.”
Ist Digger: “Wot et it?”

Digger was a bit of a student of architecture. Ad-
miring an old French church, lie asked a near-by
Frenchman:—
“Can you tell me who built that church?” “No
compree, ” replied the Frenchman. Later, he was
enthusing over the Amiens Cathedral, so inquired
from a local inhabitant: “What’s the name of the
bloke who planned most of these buildings?” “No
compree,” was the reply. Days later he was in
another town where a funeral was in progress. ‘ ‘ Par-
don me!” he interrupted the undertaker, “but ’oo
are yer plantin’?” “No compree,” said the under-
taker. “Blime!” ruminated the Digger as the pro-
cession moved off. “I thought that bloke ‘No Com-
pree’ was too clever to live.”
Digger: “Who are you?”
Nurse: “I’m the head nurse. ’’
Digger; “What did you come for? It’s the leg
nurse I want.”

After the battle of Polygon Wood, two stretcher-
bearers, plodding through the mud, found an un-
conscious Digger by the roadside. They lifted him
on to the stretcher and trudged three kilos to a
dressing station. Lowering the stretcher and feeling
all out, they were, of course, delighted to hear the
Digger gurgle: “Goo’ boysh ! I’ll fight anything in
Brish army. Hie!”
Dear Old Lady (to Digger, who lias been telling
her how he got his medal) : “Just to think you had
actually to kill four Germans!—and I don’t suppose
you had killed even one before the dreadful war
began?”

The old lady had been wearying the Digger with
questions as to how he got his M.M. till at last he
handed her this:—
* ‘ It’s this way, missus: They give it to me for bein ’
the only bloke that didn’t bring down an aeroplane
with a Mills bomb.”
Digger “I want ter get a transfer to me elder
brother. ’ ’
C. 0.: “ What’s his number?”
Digger: “7596, Sir!”
C. 0.: “Does he belong to a field unit?”
Digger: No, Sir! He’s workin’ on the Sydney
trams. ’ ’

The Digger had got his full size issue of knock—
head, arms, legs and all. The sympathetic visitor
approached the bedside: ‘‘And how did you come
to be wounded so badly?” “Sniper!” economically
replied Digger. “Gracious me!” said the lady, “he
must have hit you an awful lot of times!” “Only
once,” he replied. ‘The was using a 15-inch
gun! ’ ’
Ist Digger: ‘‘Heard you went to Bill’s ‘welcome
home’ last night. Have a good time?”
2nd Digger: “No, dead tame! Only got twelve
bob for the empty bottles this morning.”

Sergt. (on parade); “Now then, Spiffkins, pay
more attention. You’re not back on the farm now,
you know.”
Pte. Spiffkins: “I was just thinkin’ a non-com.
was like our dawg. ”
Sergt.: “How’s that?”
Pte. Spiffkins: “The more stripes you give bin),
the more he yelps.”
Digger: “If you were to put tlie lid on we would-
n’t get so much dust in the soup.”
Cook: “’Ere, young feller! Your business is to
fight for your country!”
Digger; “Yes —but not to eat it!”

Sergt.-Major: “I want both of you to remove a
dud ‘7s’ shell wot’s lauded iu the Captain’s dug-
out.”
One of the Diggers: “One of us could do that.”
Sergt.-Major: “Both of yous!—YOU can go in
first and take it out, but if the thing goes off,
YOU can go in and clean up the mess!”
Transport Driver (going towards front line) :
“Want a lift, Diggers?”
Diggers (returning from leave):. “Not on your
sweet life, old son! We’ll get ther soon enough per
boot. ’ ’

Digger met two Americans for the first time, so,
turning to the nearest, he asked: “What Army do
yer belong tor’ “Oh, I guess we’re Americans,”
said the Yank, “and we’re come over to get right in
and clean up the job for you guys!” “Oh, yer do, do
yer?” said the Digger, and tapped the Yank on the
head with a bottle. “Well, consider yourself the
first casualty.”
War Correspondent (to captured German Officer):
“If you have a pair of Zeiss glasses, I would like to
buy them from you.”
German Officer: “I vould very mooch like der
glasses to sell, hut—mein Gott! von .of your Austra-
lian soldiers took dem from me twendty minutes
before I captured vos!”

Harddoer was all in when he was wanted, but he
was very religious. On this occasion we were sur-
prised by a nest of Huns, and the only thing to do
was get—and as I got I came upon him on his
hnees. “What in ’ell! ” I said. “Only a bit of
a prayer for them that’s hit,” sez ’e. I got back safe
and said a word for the rest of his soul, but present-
ly he sauntered in pushing before him a big fat Hun.
“How the ” said I. “You was praying for
mercy when I saw you last.” “Yes,” sez ’e, giving
the Hun a prod, “his jills ’ere caught me at it!”
Sympathetic old lady: My poor fellow, you liave
lost a leg!”
Digger; “Struth! So I ’ave, mum! I’m a for-
getful cow orlriglit—l’m always loosin’ somethin’.”

Jim* “What the 11 are you shivering for, Bill?
If your’e goin’ to get hit, you’ll get hit, but there’s
no need to shake the trench down on top of
ns!”
’- * ■ -‘i ’ !
Bill (gloomily): “Br! It’s orright fer you ter
talk, but look at the life I’ve led!”
Light Horse Sergt. (who has lost patience with
Trooper O’Regan): “Never approach horses
from behind without speaking to ’em. If you do
they’ll kick you in yer thick head and in the end
we’ll have nothing but lame horses in the squadron.”

Sammy (to Digger with whom he has been swapp-
ing yarns):—“Say! Guess you don’t specialise in
raising George Washingtons in your country?”
Digger:—“An’ I guess it would be easier to find
a billy-goat’s feather than .one of them blokes in
the United States to-day!”
“Tommy” Officer:—“Why did yon not salute
me ? ’ ’
Digger (fed up) : —“Blast yer! Think a man’s a
blanky windmill?—’Aye a good look at me—then
go ’ome and tell yer ma yer’ve seen a real soldier!”

English Lady (after the usual umteen ques-
tions) : —“And are your people well off.”
Digger (fed up):—“Yes! About thirteen
thousand miles.”
Digger had been treated well by an English
family whilst on leave. The ‘old man’ had been
stung for several pounds and he didn’t like the
idea of just clearing out without a word. The
night before his draft left for France he visited
Ids friends, but his manner was so strange that
they felt compelled to ask what was wrong, “It’s
this way,” he said. “I cabled to the dad to send
me a tenner, and I got his answer this morning
to say we’re ruined. You see, the old bloke has
been looking after the goanna farm, but he’s gett-
ing old and forgetful like. He left the sliprails
down one night, and all me blinkin’ goannas got
out.”

Tactless Lady: “To tell the truth, you are the first
private I have ever danced with.”
Digger: “Struth, mum! I didn’t know me mates
was so particular. It doesn’t make any difference to
me who I dance with.”
An M. 0., tired of listening to tales of ‘lead-swing-
ers,’ said he would give anyone a month’s spell who
could spin him something new. One stepped for-
ward. “Well, what’s wrong witli you?” “Sunburnt
on the roof of my mouth.” “How did you get
that?” “Laying on me back lookin’ at aeroplanes.”
Me got the month.

Voluntary Lady Worker: “How interesting! And
you are a boundary rider on a bee-farm. Are the
natives very savage in your part of Australia V *
Private Hardface (with an aristocratic drawl):
“Oh, yes! Specially in the boomerang season.”
The usual platoon bore had wearied us even when
we reached the Red Sea, and everyone else was limp
and exhausted. “Oh, shut up!” growled a Digger.
“You’ll get yer blinkin’ teeth sunburnt.”

Officer: “Is there any man here who wants to dis-
embark in a different state to that in which he en-
listed?”
Digger: “Yes! I enlisted blind drunk, and I want
to land sober.”
Irate Drill Sergt. (to recruit who hangs back in
the line): “Dress up there, No. 5, and show your
snout, or I’ll bloomin’ well mark you absent from
parade. ’ ’

The General and his staff were on a tour of inspec-
tion. Halting before a hole from which dense dust
was rising, the general asked what was going on.
“Who’s the silly wanting to know what this
is,” said a voice from below.
“Do you know it’s the General speaking to you?”
demanded a staff officer,
“Well, if ’e’s a blanky General,” said the voice,
‘ ‘ ’e ought to know wot this ’ole is for. ’ ’
They were ploughing along up to the front line
when a spent bullet kicked Bill on the side of the
head. Bill picked up the missile, and was examining
it, when his cobber, a souvenir-fiend, asked: —
“D’yer want it, Bill?”
‘ ‘ Want it! ” growled Bill, ‘ ‘Wot th’ 'ell d’yer think
1 stopped it for?”

Prawn Merchant (in whom the Digger lias discov-
ered one of his old officers) : “I wish you hadn’t seen
me. ’ ’
Digger: “Cheer up! We all have our ups and
downs.”
Prawn Merchant: “It isn’t that. But you being
one of the old Battalion, I’ll have to give you a
deener’s worth for a sprat.”
Digger (to popular Chaplain): “The boys arst me
to invite you to join ’em in a drink.”
Padre: “No thanks, Digger, not now. I’m just
getting ready to preach a sermon.”
Digger: “That’s nothing, Sir. We’re getting ready
to listen to you.”

The Dear Old Thing:—“And what do you con-
sider the most dangerous time during a flight?”
Airman: —“About half a second before the crash
comes.”
The troopship was getting a final rough and
tumble across the Bight, and Bill, seeing Jim lean-
ing disconsolately over the rail, essayed to cheer
him up. “Getting near home now,” he said, “tres
bon ain’t it?” “Dont talk to me about home”
groaned Jim, “I come from Longreach.”

He was in front of the London Hippodrome using
language that would shame a Bullocky. “You’re
roaring hard,” said a pal who strolled up, “what s
up?” Pointing to the gorgeously uniformed door-
keeper, the Digger, full of hope and cheerfulness,
replied;—“See that bloke that Brirrish General?
—Well, I salooted the cow, an’ ’e ain’t got the
manners to return it!”
The Diggers on the job were supplied with an
outsize in shovels, and protests were of no use, so
perched on the next truck was a large boulder that
had taken seven men to place there.
After a while the N.C.O. came on the scene and
demanded:' “What the H d’ycr mean?—
there’s a rock on the last truck as big as a ’ouse,
an’ the chows at th’ other end can’t shift it!”
“I never seen no rock,” said the innocent-faced
Digger, “and if there was, it serves yer right fer
makin’ the boys use these blanky big banjoes.”

Australian (on pick and shovel duty on Sunday) :
—Struth! —They say it took the Lord six days to
build Heaven and earth —and now on the seventh
they put us poor blanky cows to work diggin’ it
up again!”
Instructor: —“Private Digger, give a description
of the modern service rifle.”
Digger:—“lt’s a mixture of wood and steel, with
a hole down the centre for lightness, and for officers
to look down to sec if a bloke’s thumb nail is
clean. ”

the air. Would yer believe it, mates, w’en the
sandbags come down they was covered with snow—

is damned funny stew!”

The argument was on the greatest recovery of
the war. The Allies’ recovery from the last Ger-
man offensive was winning till the old soldier
chipped in. “We were in support, when a terrible
disaster happened. I was carrying me rum issue,
when some blighter ran into me and spilt it all.
Well, swearin’ did no good, so I went without that
day, but next mornin’ I goes out, and wot do I
see on the ground, but me rum issue froze to a
solid lump of ice. Well, I puts it into a dixie and
melts it down, and in a couple o’ minutes, I was
tearin rum into me. That’s the greatest recovery
I know.”
ank:—ass, I came through the big war with-
out a scratch.”
Digger:—“Well, what kind of insect powder did
you use?”

“ ’Gw do yer spell delightful, Bill?”
Digger Bill wanted some eggs, so he approached a
farm Avoman: “Madame, avez vous des oeufs?” at
the same time holding np four fingers indicating the
number he required.
“Oui, M’sieur, quartre oeufs!”
“Blimey, no! ‘En’s eggs! Who the ’ell said cats’

• A Yank soldier ‘put one up’ on a Digger about
a famous echo in America. “If one were to call
out at 11 a.m., the echo would not be heard till
3 o’clock that afternoon.”
‘ ‘ That’s nothing, ’ ’ said the Digger, ‘ ‘ Why, in Aus-
tralia we sounded the bugle call in 19] 4, but yous
blokes didn’t ’ear it in America till 1917.”
A young “Tommy” officer was inspecting some
Diggers, when he came upon one whose top tunic
button was undone. Pointing to the offending Bill-
jim with his cane, he turned to the Digger Sergeant
and bleated: “I say! Look heab ! Heah’s a Dally man
half-naked!”

Officer (to Private McSmith, arriving on parade
late): “Private McSmith ! What are you late for?”
Private McSmith (breathlessly): “Parade, Sir!”
The ungainly form of a camel, ridden by an in-
toxicated Digger, appeared out of the desert and
headed for the Australian lines, where a wide-awake
guard, pointing his rifle at the beast, in accordance
with instructions, yelled “Halt! Who goes there?”
to which a very beery Digger, taking cover behind
the hump, replied; “Don’t shoot, yer silly cow, this
camel don’t know wot ’alt means yet.”

Bill was ‘swinging it’ on deafness. His case
puzzled the Army M. 0., so a civilian doctor was
called in. After examining the patient he said to
the M. 0.; “I’ve known alcohol to work wonders in
cases like this. Give him stout at 11, a bottle of beer
at dinner, champagne about tea-time, and a nip of
whisky at night. Keep it going for several days.”
A week later, Bill underwent another examination,
but he was still presumably deaf.
“Did he get the alcohol that I ordered regularly?”
the doctor asked the M.O.
“Yes,” replied the M.O.
This was too much for Bill. “You’re a liar!’ ’
he snarled at the M.O.

Just a few lines to let you know how surprised
