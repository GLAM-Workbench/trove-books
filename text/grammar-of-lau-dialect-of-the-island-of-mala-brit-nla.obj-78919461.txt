GRAMMAR
OF THE
LAU DIALECT
OF THE
ISLAND OF MALA,
BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS.
The Bei\ W. G. IVENS , M.A.
Melanesian Mission Press, Norfolk Island, 1914.




PREPARATORY NOTE.
The M.S. of this Lan Grammar was put into my kands
by the Rev. W. G. Ivens (formerly of the Melanesian
Mission), and is part of his wider work on Mala languages.
It should be understood that he has not had the advantage
of reading in proof or of revising the pamphlet, so cannot
be responsible for any errors that may have crept in.
The Lau district proper is on the N.E. coast of Mala,
and the language and vocabulary differs considerably from
the Lau of Port Adam, which is the Lan of this
Grammar. This Lau has naturally a certain admixture
of Sa?a, the language spoken all round Port Adam.
Probably the purest Lan is spoken at Sulafou, an islet
off the N.E. coast. The people there claim to be the
ancestors of the Port Adam colony. Probably Sulafou,
Suraina, Port Adam, was the order of the migration from
lagoon to lagoon. On the West coast where Lau is also
spoken there is a considerable Fin admixture, the language
of the bush behind the Langalanga lagoon.
Norfolk Island,
A. I. Hopkins.
June. 1914.




LAU.
i. Distribution of the Language.
Lau is the name of the language spoken by the
inhabitants of the artificial islets lying off the N.K. coast
of Big Mala. The coast language from Uru on the N.E.
to Langalanga, Alite Harbour, on the N.W. is prac-
tically Lau.
The inhabitants of Ai-lali on the mainland opposite
the island Aio are an off-shoot of the Lau-speaking
peoples, and the people of the two villages in Port
Adam, Ramarama and Malede, speak Lau, and hold as a
tradition that their forefathers migrated from Suraiua
near Ataa cove.
ii. ALPHABET.
(a) Vowels?a, e, i, o, u.
(h) Consonants?k, g : t, d : b : q, gw : m, in : n, n :
r, 1 : s, f.
1. The vowel oin Lau frequently represents ain Sa?a,
fou = /mu, Jinau htnou, tnouri = mauri, (mouri also
appears as mori), loulou = Inulau, cf. ilnhou (Clawn)
often pronounced as inihau. Where in Sa'a a changes
to e in certain words after a preceding i or o, no such
change is made in Lau in the same words, i'a fish, Sa?a
�*� : ua still, Sa?a ue ; Pam' at sea (of a ship), Sa?a i?esi.
Breaks appear in pronunciation owing to the dropping of
certain consonants, but this is not so common as in Sa?a.
Sa?a maVi broken, Lau moi ; ma?ti to fear, Lau mou.


2. The gis hard ; the Melanesian g is not heard, but
its place can'be detected by a break in the pronunciation,
e.g. t?a for iga fish. The gin Lau may replace kin Sa?a,
igera = ikire ; g also occurs in the Pers. Pron. Ist Plur.
excl. and 2nd Plur. where Sa?a has a break, igami ~ I?wit,
g also replaces Sa?a h t luga = luhe.
3. In many words t has been dropped, am' to cry =
lam, asi sea = tasi, ? ola canoe = Sa?a 'tola = Lau tiola.
There is no sound of it with il, nor of m with h.
4. There is no tv in Lau, the place of it (where it
occurs in Sa?a( is supplied by </, qalu eight = Sa?a t ciUti,
Ulaqa = Ulatva. Qin Lau may represent hin Sa?a, qai
reciprocal sutlix = ha'i. The sound of qis kic ;gw may
represent qin Sa?a, gwou head = Sa?a qa'u, gwini wet =
Sa?a qini'e ; gwou deserted, Mota won.
5. Nasal mis not as common as in Sa?a, but it is heard
in mane male, m ela child.
6. There is an interchange between tc and 1 , e.g. nima
or lima = five ; ilahima middle, Sa?a danutne ; inala to
discern, Sa?a ilala ; / and r are both used and the sounds
are distinct.
7. / replaces Sa?a //, fern village, Sa?a hern (court-
yard) ; fuli place, full fera village, Sa?a hull name site of
house, hull bed. The sound represented by f often
approximates to r, and it is hard to distinguish between
the two. ,
Hi. ARTICLES.
(a) Demonstrative Articles? na: si: ta, te : ntae ; qe: fe.
Plur.? gi, mat, ote.
(l>) Personal Articles ?a, ui.
1. na denotes a, the, and is of more general use than
the corresponding na in Sa?a ; na is used both with Sing,
and Plur., na noni the body, na sasigamu your brethen, na
coalesces in pronunciation with the conjunction nut, and.


2. si has a more indefinite use than iui, and denotes a
part, a piece, any, and is equivalent to met in Sa?a; si doo
tte the thing, gamelu ka ania si taa f what are we to eat Y
si ere tire stick, si dov gu saea tta the tiling (that which) 1
said ; si cannot be used of the Plural.
3. tu, te = any, a, a certain one, at all, another, the
other, and are probably the same as the numeral ta one ;
there is little difference between the use of ta and te ; ta
gule/era a city, ? uluna ta ai the third one, ta yule ala/aa
nan the half of my kingdom, ta bull ?aba the other hand,
ta sasma ta ai a man?s brother, ta rufe gale hoi a two young
pigeons, e lam si situ ana ta tooui not clothed in any gar-
ment at all; fa may mean * only ta ro ai only two people
(cf. L lawa /u?e ro * ittotii ) ; ta is also used with the nu-
merals, te matte ma lani ta ro mane one man ir two men,
ta ro si ho two minds, ta ro tanale penny two hundred
pence ; te geni sarii a maiden, ie taijilia ini a he alone, te
uiai falaete one only ; te is used of units (as at a in Sa?a),
tejiu/e doo only seven things, te ai ma te ai one by one,
too te at singly. Xi may be added, tani a ini everybody,
some others, ana tani /era gi in all lands; si may be
added, fast fou a rock, te si na doo a thing apart, accursed ;
te si gula ? i'idimani a little while; ke may replace te, kest
gala *didimani a small piece, ro kesi knrui bata two small
pieces of money ; ke and si may be combined, te ke si gula
? i'idimani , e lam asia n a te ke si doo there is nothing
at all. ?
4. mae is used with /era, dani, rodo , oru, and corres-
ponds to the use of ha'i with similar words in Sa?a, mae
/era a village, maedntxi a day, maerodo darkness, /ai mae
oru qa?iliu the four winds ; mae may be via e, ma = eye,
= one, and e the construct form (cf. Sa?a maa ni , a).
5. qe is used in certain phrases, qe a/e a woman, qc
P a a fish, qe oru a widow ; na may be prefixed, na qc da
gi fishes.
6. te is evidently the same as ye the reciprocal prefix,
and as in Sa?a (cf. Sa?a /m?i), it is used both as a prefix


and as an article. It conveys the notion of recurrence,
and may be used of one of a series, fe rodo a night, fe axua
a day. fe is also used of things spherical in shape, fe
kakara'ikna a hen?s egg (Sa'a hoi kite), fe bread a loaf, fe
hubnlu a star, fe no a hill, fe rade a reed, fe ijale hoia a
young pigeon ; na may precede, na fe vo a hill ; or to,
tefuana ta fe no every hill, te fe mel a in a tala an only son.
fe is also used as the equivalent of the multiplicative
(ha'n in Sa?a), ro fe ania two Growings, 'olufe nianialagu
three denials of me, Jiu fe ade doo ta'ala seven cases of
wrong doing.
7. gi denotes plurality, na mane gi the males ; it may
be separated from the noun, na doo nia gi his things ; it
is also used with the Pers. Pron. Plur. gia gi we, gera gi
they, and is probably the same as the tinal i in Sa?a,
i'emere'i we two, etc.
8. It is questionable whether ole is not properly em-
ployed of females only, ote aia nia his female relations,
ote *a*iua his sisters, ote geni women, ote ai you women ;
gi may be added, ote ai gi yon women. In Port Adam
ote seems to be employed as a regular plural article ote
mane gi !
9. mat is used with Nouns of Relationship only, m ai
'asi nia his brethren, ro m ai telana mother and daughter-
in-law, ro moi taxi no brethren.
10. ais used as a Personal Article with the names of
males, native or foreign, a Leo, a Joe. ni is used with
names of females only, native or foreign, ni Man/, ni Alida ;
it is also used with certain Nouns which denote women,
where in Sa?a n� or a is used, ni te nau my mother, ni
t naetnane a man's sister ora woman?s brother, ni aia female
relations, ni doo the woman (Ba'a a keine), ni mela ne that
woman ; but it is not used with afe wife nor geni female;
ni is not used with the Plural.


iv. NOUNS
1. Nouns which take the possessive suffixes:
(a) parts of body, lima hand, liuxayu my hand, \tba arm,
?abamu thy arm.
(b) Position, hurt behind, buriyu behind me, i doluma.ua
in the midst, i kamexxa loho beside the lake.
(r) Certain states and doings of men, mano breath, macla
death, tolafa way.
(d) Certain terms of relationship, la ro maitelana , but
ni te ula, ro max funmia relations-at-law, but xia funo
uia his mother-in-law : sasi brother, or, sister, siutlyu ,
is the only word denoting relationship which takes
the suffixed pronoun.
2. Formation of Nouns.
There are certain terminations which mark out certain
words as Nouns, the terminations are added to Verbs,
Adjectives and Adverbs, and the Nouns thus formed ex-
press abstract ideas. The terminations are :
(a) attached to Verbs, a, la,fa,ta; mae, to die, maca ,
death, sickness ; uioela death ; bae to speak, luxe!a
speech, baea word ; fana to eat,/mum and f anal a focal;
macmae/a sickness; vxeafana ere the light of the fire;
ixaofa the first ; ta is seen in the root afuta meaning
?all,? which is only used with the suffixed pronoun,
afutagera all of them, afutana naai yi all the people.
Compound Nouns may be formed, girigiri lifua
gnashing of teeth, saifama dooa wisdom.
(b) Attached to Adjectives and Adverbs, la, dieua good,
dienala goodness, lata excess, ro fe tasala twice as
great.
3. Construct form.
To make a construct form e is added to the first of
two Nouns, ��? oe yula the chief place, ua/ai vnxe ora


qa?iliu the four winds, toloe f era hill, fuli abae ai man's
handiwork. When the final vowel of the first member
ends in a, ae contracts to e, aqale mu?t ten baskets, na'vfe
meld eldest child, fufue ai seed.
3. Gerundives.
Verbal substantives which may be considered as Gerun-
dives are formed by adding the suffixed Pronouns to Noun
forms in la, naunilana his being killed, adelana the doing
of it, foul etna news of it, talaeland because of, olisilana his
being answered, J analana his eating, gtroulana his drink-
ing, ogulada their being gathered together. The words
*o*olo right, moult left are treated in the same way, Voio-
laiju my right hand, ton little, tnvlagu my infancy, diena
good, dieualana si doo good things.
4. Genitives.
The Genitives are r, ui, li, si. Alafaa i lani kingdom
of heaven, <jeui i Sa'a Sa?a woman.
hi is used mainly in construction : fate ui f era a native
paddle, haea ui svgela deceitful words, gwai ui gtcaila
anointing oil, mem edua ni lalano wild honey; also rosuli
ui viauatai garni hear us in mercy, gu ada ni dor Haw u I
see thee with pleasure, to'o ui hu'o live in ignorance, ni
gula ui lea nia a place for him to go; li replaces ni in
certain words, malimaea enemy, malitafa channel in reef.
si is used in certain phrases; ofu si doo bundles, ro
tooui si doo 2,000.
The Genitive is frequently omitted, olu tea dour, three
measures of flour, niumudi fauala crumbs of food, mane
Sa'a a Sa?a man, falisi vine vineyard.
The Preposition ana may be used to denote the Geni-
tive; luma anafooa house of prayer, tala ana fanualama
way of peace.
A Genitive is also shown by the use of the suffixed pro-
noun 3 Singular or Plural in agreement with the idea
expressed iu the second Noun; i tolonufera on the tops


of the hills, gtroiiua ua ai yi head of men, 'abada ai yi
men's hands.
The ordinary possessive idea is shown by juxtaposition
in cases where the pronoun cannot bo suffixed, ufe n��,
my wife, arai nia her husband.
5. Plural.
To shew plurality yi is used following the Noun, na
mane yi the men ; oro many may be added ua mane oro yi
many men ; tani ai oro many people.
gera Per. Pron. 3 Plur. is used to mark plurality, yera
fiolo the hungry, gera priest tla adeu urina the priests
acted thus. Totality and completion is shown by sui
finished, or sui na , afutada sui they all, yera lea sui na
they have gone already ; ua also shews completion yera
lea ua they have gone. To express totality the suffixed
Pronoun, 3 Pers. Sing., and all Pers. Plur. are added to a
root afuta , formed from afu to complete, ta Noun suffix,
afutana fera all the land, afutana uouiyu my whole body,
afutayolu all of us, afutada sui da nalia they all received
it; ua may be prefixed ua afutana uonina his whole body.
The numeral qalu eight is used as an indefinite number,
qalu doo iuau all my things, qalu fera all lands, but cf. te
si ua doo test ua fera may be the correct usage. Tefuuaua
means ? all ? 4 every,? tefuuaua na fera every land, te = one
fuua Noun formed from fuu = Sa?a //��, real, for all
time, ua suffixed Pronoun : other forms are fafuuaua ,
(fa causative) fafuuaua si dtsj the real thing, also to'ofuu-
nami real, true.
6. Sex formation.
To shew sex m<i�e is used for male and gent for females.
7. Nouns of Relationship.
Of all the Nouns denoting relationship sasi brother,
sister, is the only one that takes the suffixed Pronoun.
The word used for 4 father? is ma'a ?the Article na is
used with this, ua ma'a uau my father, moaka nan is also
commonly used j mela na ai so and bo?s bou ; aia with the


Article in sing, ote pint*., mi aia man?s sister, nmcnmae
man's sister ; 'uni brother (sister) is only used with the
prefix nun which marks reciprocity of relationship, m�t�-
\i*i uau bx*ethren ! In speaking of pairs ru is used, ru
nun' �asina two brothers, ta ru mamana father and sou,
(mama appears to be used in this phrase alone.)
The word for 4 child * is me/o, mela nia his child. The
Adjective gale is used preceding the Noun to describe
something young, ro fe gale hula two young pigeons.
? Mother? = te, the Article is ni, ni te uau my mother,
ta ro mat telana mother and child, with inav added, my
wife end child; the la of telana is the Noun suffix and va
the suffixed Pronoun ; ta ro maifuntma two relations-at-
law.
oi person, man, is used as a vocative, mela ai you there !
a duo ai hey, you ! ua ai 'ue your people, ai ni raoa servant,
ai tou the less.
v. PRONOUNS.
1. Personal Pronouns.
Singular I. iuav, nan , gn.
2. i?oe, 'ue, *o.
3. inid , nia, ni, e.
Plural 1. inch igia, gia ; igulu, golu.
excl. igarni,garni, mi: igamelu, gamelu.

3. igera, gera, da; idalu, data.
Dual 1. inch igoro, goro.
excl. igatnere , gamere.
2. igamoru, gamoro.
3. idaro, daro.
The forms with i are never used by themselves as the
subject, but are always accompanied by the shorter forms,
igera da oda via da ei ada va they see but do not see; the
three longer forms in the Singular are of more or less
infrequent use. The initial iis run on to the preceding
vowel in pronunciation.


All the forms without i ere used alone ns the Subject
of the Verb. Where there are three forma the second
and third are generally used togethei as Subjects, garni
mi lani *i saefamana we do not know ; but the short forms
01, gu, mi, 'la, may be used alone as subjects, gn si saea
I do not know. forms in fit are not used as a Trial,
but are used to narrow the application.
nin is used as meaning, there is, si mam-ana ni ?ana
there was power in him, ? ejifa/e bread nia agamtJu ; it is
also equivalent to the Genitive, ana maedaui nia Abiathar
in Abiathar?s time ; when the meaning is, there is, it is,
via is preceded by e, na liqa gera cuin ?nda they have' their
holes, nip. te ai e nia i luma there is only one person in the
house ; nia na = that is it.

man the light of the body is the eye.
e is generally used of the Neuter, e lani it is not, no!
e lani ?ana it is lost, e uta f how ? etui im it is finished ;
e appears also to be used, as in Sa?a, with a personal sub-
ject, ma e erisia na to*o *e tui when he had sent away the
people ; the best usage is the particle ka without a
Pronoun.
gi is used with the forms in the Plnr. but not with
those in lu, gia gi fi dao na we have just come.
igera and gera are used as equivalent to a plural
Article, igera na Judea the Jews.

2. gatnoro.
3. daro.
A second object of the Verb always appears in the
suffixed Pronoun, gn latii si adasia na *ula I saw no canoe,
qera gutafigera na mane gi they persecuted the men. All
Prepositions governing Nouns have the Pronoun suffixed
as an anticipatory object in agreement with the Noun,
gea lea fanoxia fern they went to harm the land, fafia si
thx) concerning the matter.
The Verb dari to wish, has the Pronoun suffixed where
in Sa?a none is used, via lani si doria gtcou ana he would
not drink (it) of it,
To taifli alone, the Pronouns are suffixed, te taiJUia he

The different classes of Nouns to which the Pronouns

These Pronouns are also suffixed to the Preposition
fan to, to afnta all, and to certain Noons which have no


independent existence ; ntqfa concerning, 'o'ofa approach-
ing to, enceinte ; �e, rhez ; mara of one?s own accord, te
taifilia mar ana he alone; also to the Verb to'o to hit,
to'ogu , to'ona , etc.
4. Demonstrative Pronouns.
�m, ne, this ; vena, nana , none, that; mi n nana , that is it.
j/o, an Adverb, there, is used as a Demonstrative, tefe
doo go ana only one thing, inan go agn I for my part; ne
may be added, gone = that, iniVi gone that is so ; ha that,
diena ha g<x>d ! hago that, there.
5. Interrogative Pronouns.
ti who, with Personal Article prefixed, ah?. The ex-
clamation ha may be added for emphasis, ah' ha who P ati
mane what man ? ati has also an indefinite use, ati etunlia
who knows P ne may be added for emphasis, ate ne who
then ? gerati Plural who P
ta'a, tafa , what ? ta'a may mean, of what sort ? ta si
doo fa*a what sort of thing P ta'a what ? that which ;

vi. POSSESSIVES.
Singular 1. 'agn.
2. 'am n.
3. 'ana.


Plural 1. incl. ?aga, ?again.
excl. ?again!, ?agameln.
2. 'agamn, ?agamnlu.
3. ?agera, ?ada , ?adalu.
Dual 1. inch ?agnrn.
exol. 'agamere.
2. ? agamoru.
3. 'adaro.
The Possessive is used ;
(1) of things to eat and drink, si fanaa agn some thing
for me to eat.
The Personal Pronouns are used instead of the Posses-
sive when the idea is of food generally and not of a par-
ticular meal, si doo ni giron inau a drink for me.
(2) As meaning ? for me,? etc., ? for my part,? * belong-
ing to,* ?at,? ?with;? geni ?agn a wife for me, ?e lea ?ana
he went his way, gu ha gele dan go ?agn if 1 but touch,
fnana n alia fera uia ?again to get his land for ourselves,
si doo ?ana ?agera priest taifil igera but for the priests only;
si vi am ana via ?ana power in him, his power, si dixi oro
?agn I have many things, e lani ?ana not in it, lost; via
soe 'agera he questioned them, soea satana ana a doo ask
so and so his name, via ledia tasi doo ?agn he asked me
about something, ogana ?agera their debt.
(3) As the Object of a Neuter Verb, gera da gele ?ana
they marvelled at him, gu inn amu I beseech thee, dan
?agn touch me, hot a ?ana blessed is he.
(4) With Neuter Verbs when the Object is separated
from the Verb, uia hubu tete ?adalu he regarded them
fixedly; ka Ingata?i sanfini ?ana let him go secretly, da
hae aisile ?ana they spoke scornfully of him ; ala menie
gamn rend yon, is a variation.
(5) To express 4 of,? ?from among;* ati mane?aganiu
what man of you.


ADJECTIVES.
The Adjective 'afoa apart is also followed by the
Possessive.
It will be seen that the one Possessive in Lan does the
work of the three that are used in Sa?a. A Port Adam
man asking for a Sa?a woman ns geni 'ana (as has hap-
pened before now at Sa?a) would bo asking whether he
wanted to 4 eat? her?the Sa?a use being keni nana ??ana
being reserved for things to eat.
vii. ADJECTIVES.
1. True Adjectives e.g. diena good, ago hot, gwart
cold.
2. Adjectival terminations, 'a, la.
'a is affixed to Substantives or Adjectives ; fahili to
defile, bili'a dirty, gain heavy, guln'a heavy, hnln black,
buhulu'a black, rodn night, rorodo'a dark.
la is affixed to Substantives; m a'lla rich, mu ( hag,
Jcobukobula fat, kohu to be fat, boehoda whole or big, bae
to be whole or big, tagalola of thick forest, matted, tagolu
to be wandering.
3. Adjectival Prefixes, 'a, ma, fata, m. Those are all
prefixes to Verbs.
'afoa apart, 'aluga loose, 'ala'a up, ? a'ahu'a red (abn
blood), mawisinisi broken, mat ala only, merely, tefe m ela
matala an only child, tatagwelu headlong; m appears to
be used in moi broken, (Sa?a 'o'i to break).
4. Comparison of Adjectives. Two prepositions are
used, fast fiom, tasa beyond; the suffixed Pionoun is used
with fast, but the Possessive is used with ta*a: nu boso e
baita'fast ana 'asufe a pig is larger than a rat; gera bait a
tasa 'agent they are much larger than those.
A superlative is expressed by asm, e baita asia it is
very (too) large.

account for this.
(2) The syllable a'i is suffixed by itself to Nouns to
convert them into Verbs: sato sun, satou'i to place in
the sun ; sasu smoke, sasua'i to smoke over a fii?e. To
this syllable a'i the Genitive hi may be added, and to
the form a'ini the consonants f, (I), m, (u), n, (r), t, are
prefixed : olt to return, olifa'iui to carry back, lolonia'tui
to dip, ala to answer, alama'iiti to consent, son to become,
sauna'ini to make, tagala to be lost, tagalana'tut to drive
out, foa to pray, foal a'tut to pray for.
The Genitive >u is often omitted and is not invaxiably
used as it is in Sa?a, gonita'i to receive, gtrouta'i or gtoou-
ta'ini to be left alone, oalana't to appox?tion, fatalama't to
command, ant appeax-s to be used as a Verbal Suffix,
ut to throw, uiani to throw away ; lag a to drive, lagaani to
drive away; tala to .strike, talaani to destroy; taga to


scatter, tagaavi : ani is also used with to'o to hit, to?o ani to
understand. Certain Participials are formed from Verbs
by the addition of these suffixes (without ni) : tegela'i
lost, olita'i converted.
The Suffix nu'iui is added to the Adverb taran continu-
ous, tarauna'inia fera right through the country.
5. Prefixes to Verbs.

think, famanatui to teach, oro many, faoro to multiply;

liu reciprocally, qa'ifamanatai to instruct, qa'isusi to
sacrifice, qa'isuasuafi to meet, qa'idori to desire, fa' I ap-
