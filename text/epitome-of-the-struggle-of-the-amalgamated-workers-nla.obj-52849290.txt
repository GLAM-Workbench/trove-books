EPITOME OF THE STRUGGLE
OF THE
Amalgamated Workers’ Association
of Queensland.
QUEENSLAND SUGAR STRIKE
WILLMETT'S LTD., PRINTERS, TOWNSVILLE.
Statement and Balance Sheet from July 4
to December 1, 1911.


EPITOME OF THE STRUGGLE.
Early in the year the Amalgamated Workers’ Association approached both the Australian
Sugar Producers Association and the various Milling Companies asking that a Conference
to discuss the rates of pay, hours of labour, and the conditions of employment
obtaining in the Sugar Industry throughout Queensland.
The conditions obtaining in the industry at the time were a disgrace, and were really the out-
come of the removal of the Kanaka. The employers accepted all the protection that the Federal
Go's eminent had given to the industry, and very little, if any, was passed on to the men who were
employed in the mills and fields. The hours worked in the mills were from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and
the minimum wage for labouring work was AT 2s. 6d. per week with food, half-a-crown per week
bonus being allowed to any person working right through the season. The conditions of the field
workers were little better, the hours being anything from 10 to 12 per day, and the wage £1 ss. per
week. In the harvesting season the cane-cutters worked on contract, and although good money is
earned b} some gangs, the hours w'orked are out of all proportion to the money earned.
The A.W.A. made a demand of a minimum wage of 30s. per week and found, both in mills and
field, hours of labour to be eight (8) per day, and that a uniform agreement be drawn up giving the
employee the same rights and privileges as the employer. This agreement to apply to the whole of
the Sugar Districts of Queensland. The A.S.P.A. and the sugar barons refused to have anything to
do with the Union, and stated that they would deal with their individual employees as in the past.
Preparations were then made by the A.W.A. for a struggle, and a definite plan of campaign
laid down. The various Puanches operating in the Sugar Districts were notified to be in readiness
for a call-out of the mill and field hands immediately an attempt was made to commence crushing.
This policy was followed right through, and as the mills started to crush the men ceased w T ork, and
within one month of the first call-out the whole of the sugar mills in Queensland were involved.
Camps were formed at each strike centre, the men being housed and fed by the Association. Fully
6000 men w T ere under canvas, and a splendid system of picketing was brought into play. During
the whole period of the Strike the Colonial Sugar Refining Company made strenuous efforts to
secure seal) labour from the southern States. They were fairly successful in securing a large
number of men, but the unionists in the different centres succeeded in persuading most of them to
join the strikers.
After the struggle had continued for three months the Australian Labour Federation appealed
to the Transport Unions of Australia asking them to co-operate with us and endeavour to bring
pressure to bear upon the employers. The combined unions immediately agreed to come to the
assistance of the men on strike. This had the desired effect, as the Australian Sugar Producers’
Association agreed to meet the Unions in Conference and discuss the questions raised.
The Conference proved highly successful: the Millers’ Association granting the eight-hour day
in all the mills and the 30s. per week minimum, also allowing time and a-quarter for overtime.
They also agreed to meet the Executive of the A.W.A. and draw up a satisfactory agreement, such
agreement to be adopted by the millers and growers throughout the State. The question of field
labour was dropped by the Unions, it coming under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Customs,
who issues regulations definately stating the wages to be paid for field work.
We sincerely thank one and all for the splendid support accorded to us during the struggle,
without which it would have been impossible to have carried the strike to such a successful
conclusion; and a word of thanks is also due to the Transport Unions who acted so swiftly and
decisively when called upon to bring influence to bear upon the employers.
The accompanying balance-sheet gives full information in regard to the cost of each centre,
and also gives the total amounts paid out during the fignt. A list of all subscribers outside the
A-W.A. is also attached.
