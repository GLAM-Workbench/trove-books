INTRODUCTION.
In laying these notes before the public, the writer
may state that he has for some time past been
engaged in calling attention to the great loss sus-
tained in the reduction of gold ores, and the extent
to which this loss may be diminished by means
already known and in practical operation. The
interest thus aroused has entailed on the writer an
extensive correspondence with inquirers on most
of the gold-fields, and, as the supply of full par-
ticulars to each person was impracticable, it
appeared to be desirable that these details should
be put in such a form as to bring them within the
reach of all concerned. These pages have no
pretension to the character of a treatise, being
simply rough notes thrown together, principally
bearing on the practical points where diversity of
opinion might be expected, and addressed to those
having some acquaintance with the business of
quartz-crushing.
Many readers may not be prepared to concur
in all the views advanced; hut with the main
object of these notes?the advocacy of a searching
and systematic enquiry into the processes in use ?


the form and extent of the loss at present sus-
tained, and such improved methods of operating
as may reduce that loss within reasonable
bounds ?few will disagree.
Careful experiments, extending over many years,
have shown that where the undecomposed sul-
phides exist in any considerable quantity in the
quartz?as they do in most of our mines?the loss
in reduction varies from twenty-five to seventy per
cent, of the total gold contents, or, at a low
estimate, .�1,000,000 per annum, for this colony
alone; and, so far as reliable statistics can be
obtained, the gold mining districts of Europe and
America are in the same position.
It is needless to dilate on the advantage that
would result from the retention of only such
portion of the gold now lost as it is known with
certainty can be effected, or the stimulus it would
give to our great industry. This must be obvious
to everyone, and the writer trusts that the import-
ance of the subject will excuse the imperfections
necessarily attending a production of this kind in
so condensed a form.

NOTES
OK THE
REDUCTION OF GOLD ORES.
In considering 1 the methods in use for the extraction of
gold from the minerals with which it is usually associated,
it should be borne in mind, that the treatment must vary
both with the peculiar conditions of the gold itself, and
also with the character of the other metallic bodies aggre-
gated with it in the quartz. To enter into all the modifica-
tions that would be required in each part of the treatment
to meet the different descriptions of gold-bearing quartz,
would extend these notes to too great a length, without
adding much to their usefulness, ?the mineral character of
the great majority of our quartz mines being nearly the
same, and only varying in degree. The following notes
are, therefore, only intended to point out the principles on
which our reduction processes should be based, as regards
the greater part of our quartz mines, without reference to
the exceptional cases, where the presence of rarer minerals
requires a change, or modification of the system pursued.
The subject may, for convenience, be divided into three
parts ?first, the reducing machinery; second, the extraction
of the free gold; and third, the means best calculated to
save the pyritous gold, now passing away with the waste
tailings.
The reducing machinery may he divided into two classes,
first, machines depending on impact for their crushing


power, such as stamping mills, ?and inventions on a similar
principle to Balfour?s crushers ; ?second, grinding machines,
such as the Chilian mill, arrastra, <fec. #
The force gained by impact will be readily understood
when we consider the simple action of driving a nail into
a beam. If we place the hammer on the head of the nail,
and endeavour to thrust it in by pressure alone, an enormous
amount of power is required to effect the purpose. But use the
hammer in the ordinary way, and the nail is driven home with
great ease. This is what is meant by the force of impact, and
its degree is ascertained by multiplying the velocity with
which the blow is given, into the weight of the hammer.
A stamper might rest on a piece of quartz, and be loaded
with many tons of weight without crushing it; but let the
same stamper acquire the force of impact by falling only a
few inches, and the piece of quartz will be crushed to a
powder. In the ordinary stamping mill, the velocity is that
of a body falling under the well-known law of gravitation,
and is, therefore, only capable of increase by increasing the
weight of the stamper on the lift, ?that is, the distance the
stamper has to fall. It has been proposed to use stampers
working on the principle of the steam hammer, and the
increase of the velocity would no doubt give increased
crushing power; but whether this plan would not be attended
by inconveniences more than counterbalancing the advan-
tages gained can only be settled by actual trials, and those
hitherto made have not been successful.
* Two other mills are used for crushing ores. One the roller mill,
where the ore passes between two revolving horizontal rollers, kept in
close contact by a weighted lever. This mill is employed for the coarse
crushing given to lead ores, but it is useless where fine crushing is
required. The other is the common flour-mill, or modifications of it,
only applicable to further reducing the tailings to any required degree
of fineness.


Balfour?s Crusher is simply a strongly-made fan, similar
to those used for the fan blast, the arms being faced with
flat hammers, and driven at from fifteen hundred to two
thousand revolutions per minute. The great velocity is
necessary to compensate for the want of resistance?this
being only the inertia of the pieces of quartz, A number
of machines on this principle have been patented in the
United States, but the speed at which they have to be
driven causes such an amount of wear and tear, and liability
to accident, that after repeated trials they have been
abandoned. Another fatal defect in these machines is the
action on the gold, which is broken up into infinitesimally
small particles, rendering it very difficult to collect without
passing all the sand through an expensive process. In a
trial made at Clunes of one of these machines, where the
crushed material was carried by the blast into a chamber
fifteen feet in length, and there allowed to settle on the
floor, ?it was found that the sand at the far end of the
chamber contained as much gold as that close to the
machine,? thus indicating that the gold had been broken
into particles so small as to allow of its floating fifteen feet
in the atmosphere of the chamber.
The action of the grinding machine will be best illustrated
by considering the effect of a pestle pressing on a piece of
stone. So long as this pressure is downward only, it will
require great force to break the stone � but if, while the
downward pressure is continued, a lateral twist is given to
the pestle, the disintegration of the stone is effected at once.
This is the principle of the Chilian mill, where the rollers
make one complete revolution on the vertical line of their
diameter, for each revolution in the basin, thus obtaining the
twist which really gives the grinding power, and but for
which the action and effect would be similar to that of a
garden roller on a gravel walk. The arrastra partakes in a


minor degree of the same principle, the crushing power
being mainly derived from the grinding action caused by
the stones dragging over the quartz ; but it must be evident
that the grinding action in this machine is less than in the
Chilian mill, and its disintegrating effect is in proportion.
In consequence, the arrastra is seldom used, except for
reducing sand to a fine powder, and even for this purpose
machines on a similar principle to the flour mill are more
effective.
The disintegrating power of a crushing mill must then
depend either on the grinding action or the force gained by
impact; and if this principle had been kept in view,
inventors would have saved much time and money, which
have been thrown away in the manufacture of machines the
educated engineer could at once see were useless.
The Chilian mill was much used in the early days of
quartz mining in this colony, when the rich surface deposits
of gold were opened; hut when the poorer quartz had to be
treated, it was found too slow and costly for operating on
the large quantities of material required to make the mines
pay. As the quartz was raised from a greater depth,
another objection was found to attend the use of this mill.
The grinding of the undecomposed sulphides in mercury
with heavy rollers, has a great tendency to promote a combi-
nation of these sulphides with the mercury, forming what is
known to crushers as black amalgam, and causing a great
loss, both of time, mercury, and gold.*
The Chilian mill is now seldom used, expept as a second
process after the stamps, or for grinding and amalgamating
rich concentrated sand after the latter has been roasted.
* In working a Chilian mill with heavy rollers, the writer has seen
seventy pounds weight of mercury sickened by the sulphides, so as to
form into this black amalgam, in the course of a few minutes after the
action on the mercury first begun.


For ordinary quartz crushing 1 and amalgamating, even when
worked with great care, it does not save a larger percentage
of gold than well-arranged stamping machinery will do, and
is far inferior in other respects.
The stamping mill is the machine now used almost uni-
versally for the reduction of gold ores, and is so well known
that a description of it would he superfluous for those to
whom these notes are addressed. Many modifications of the
details of construction are in use, and it will only he neces-
sary to consider the principles on which the more important
of these are based. The old Cornish stamps have rectangular
heads, the provision for raising the stamper being by means
of a tongue projecting from the lifter, which tongue is
caught by a cam keyed into a large cam barrel, and the
openings for the escape of the crushed material are of small
area. The faults of this arrangement are, that the stamper
being lifted from a point some six or seven inches in front of
the centre of gravity, a strain is brought on the lower front
brace, and the back top brace, which greatly adds to the
wear and tear ; while the centre of the cam barrel being a
long distance from the lifter, the leverage is increased in
proportion, and a considerable amount of driving power is
thus wasted. The introduction of round heads has remedied
many of the defects of the old Cornish stamps. A disc on
the lifter supersedes the projecting tongue, and the cam
barrel is replaced with a shaft set close up to the lifters. On
this shaft are keyed the wipers, which catch the discs at the
side of the lifters. By this means the lifting point is
brought much nearer the centre of gravity, and the leverage
is reduced to a minimum, while a partial revolution of the
stamp occurs at each blow, so as to equalise the wear of the
head. The screw disc, a plan introduced by Mr. John
Martin, to whom the mining? interest is indebted for many
improvements in the details of mining machinery, is a great


advance on the old plan of keying the disc to the lifter, as it
allows of exact adjustment without stopping the stamps.
Doubts have been expressed as to whether round heads
would crush so well as square heads, but an effectual trial
made, where the conditions were exactly the same, proved
that there was little, if any, difference between them in
crushing power.
Round stamps are usually worked at a lower rate of speed
than square ones. This has arisen from a desire to make
the lift with as little jar as is possible, and for this purpose
using long curved wipers. It would, however, be more
economical to use shorter wipers, even at the cost of a little
extra power and jar, for the purpose of allowing more speed.
With from eight to nine inches lift, stamps should be driven
at the rate of eighty blows per minute.
The advantage attending increased speed is not that
derived from the extra number of blows per minute
alone, for the water in the stamp coffers being kept
in a greater state of agitation, the sand is cleared away
more rapidly through the escapes, thus preventing that
choking of the coffers which impedes the effective action
of the stampers, and the increase of quartz crushed will
he found to he greater than the extra number of blows
per minute will account for. With a similar view of getting
the sand out of the coffers as soon as it is crushed small
enough to pass through the gratings, it is always advisable
to have the escapes cut as large as they conveniently can he,
occupying the jwbolje front and back of the coffers. The
quantity of water used may be from five to eight gallons per
head per minute, the exact amount being regulated by the
character of the material to be crushed and the weight of the
stampers.
The most serious objection to the use of the stamping
mill for gold ores, of the character common in this colony,


was the large proportion of gold beaten up under the
stampers, into such small particles that they could not be
retained by the ordinary processes, thus causing a great
loss of gold. This, in Germany, is called ? beating the
gold dead,? and was, no doubt, one of the reasons why
stamping machinery was at first held in such disfavour. The
objection has been in a great measure, if not entirely, over-
come, by the introduction of false beds~into the coffers,
although, in several parts of the colony, these are still only
viewed as a means of saving the coffers from wearing out,
while the great advantage derived from them is overlooked.
When properly arranged, they allow a large proportion of
the gold to remain in the coffers, and for this purpose the
false beds should have a layer of broken quartz, from two to
three inches thick, between them and the bottom of the
coffer. The area of the bed should be the same as that of
the head, so as to allow sufficient space around them for the
gold to get down below the level of the false beds, among
the loose quartz, where it will be protected from the action
of the stampers. When the false beds have a larger area
than the face of the heads, a hollow is formed in them, in
which the gold is liable to collect, and there get beaten up.
The false beds are cheaper when made of wrought, instead
of cast iron, from the greater durability of the former.
Shoes are now in general use, both for round and square
heads, and have a decided advantage in keeping up the
weight of the stamper, and in the facility with which the
worn-out shoe can be replaced.
All stamps should be made self-feeding, to save labour,
which can be much better expended in attending to the
means adopted for saving gold. Wire gauze or perforated
plates are used for covering the escapes, but the plates are
generally preferred. The gauze may run from twelve to
sixteen wires to the linear inch, and the perforated plates


may be of a corresponding gauge. This gauge should be
suited to the character of the gold in the quartz; where this
is fine, the crushing must be fine also; where coarse, the
crushing may be coarse. Cases may even occur where it
would be advantageous to lose a portion of the free gold
through coarse crushing, for the sake of saving a larger
per-centage of the rich auriferous sulphides.
Outside the coffers, the appliances used for amalgamating
have been so numerous as to render it impossible to describe
them all within the limits to which these notes are
confined. They have each been tried?had their day?and
been thrown aside for simpler and more effective plans;
although modifications of old amalgamating machines are
still from time to time brought forward only to be aban-
doned. It is almost impossible to induce inventors to
believe that the old South American plan of concentrating
on properly constructed blanket strakes will retain nearly all
the free gold, and that to introduce complicated and expen-
sive machines to do the work, which can be done as well by
simpler appliances, is a change for the worse instead of for
the better. The error is in supposing that the loss now
sustained on our crushing works is all in the form of free
gold, which it is possible to secure by improved methods of
amalgamating.
The means in general use in this colony for retaining the
gold are ?amalgamation in the stamp coffers, mercury
ripples, copper plates coated with mercury, and blanket
strakes. But before examining each of these processes, it
may be well to consider the character of the material to be
treated.
Besides gold, most of our quartz veins contain the
sulphides of iron, lead and antimony, in greater or less
quantities. Other ores are found in the veins, but not
usually to such an extent as to affect the extraction of the


gold; and it is, therefore, not necessary to dwell on their
character in this short sketch.
The sulphides of iron (iron and arsenical pyrites) are the
ores most frequently met with, and which carry enclosed in
them the most gold. The galena, or lead ore, also contains
gold, hut it is not usually rich, and antimony ore is found
in small quantities in nearly all our veins. In some districts
we have veins of antimony mixed with quartz and gold, in
which case the treatment for separating the gold, and
rendering the antimony available, must he a distinct one,
and is not entered on in these notes.
Most persons engaged in crushing operations will have
noticed that when the sulphides of iron (pyrites or mundic)
are exposed to the action of air or moisture, natural decom-
position takes place, and they are slowly converted into
oxides; hut if kept under water, this decomposition is so
retarded as to be hardly perceptible. In the quartz veins a
similar operation has been going on. Near the surface, and
above the water level, the sulphides are usually decomposed,
the oxide of iron thus formed giving to the quartz and
adjoining rocks a red or brown tinge. As the depth of the
mine increases this decomposition gradually becomes less
perfect, until at a distance from the surface, varying
according to the close or open nature of the rock traversed,
the sulphides are unaltered. In all cases it will be found
that below the permanent water level, little, if any, decom-
position has taken place. The gold thus liberated near the
surface has probably helped to form the rich deposits found
at the outburst of so many of our quartz veins, and the
locking up of a large proportion of the gold in the unde-
composed sulphides found at a greater depth would tend to
decrease the yield of gold obtained from the veins below a
certain point.


In considering'this subject, we may divide the gold found
in the quartz veins into two kinds, ?first, the free gold, or
such as is deposited in the quartz or slate in a form render-
ing it capable of being liberated by the ordinary reducing
process; and second, the pyiitous gold, meaning that depo-
sited with, and enveloped by, the ores of the baser metals?
in our case principally with iron in the form of iron and
arsenical pyrites. The greater part of the free gold is
deposited in particles large enough to be separated from its
matrix by ordinary crushing, although the degree of fineness
to which the quartz should be reduced must be regulated
by the character of the gold. Some portion of the gold
will still remain embedded in particles of quartz sand, but
with well adjusted arrangements the amount so lost will not
be great, considering the character of the majority of our
veins. Exceptional cases, where the gold is in very fine
particles,?and the loss of it in this state is heavier, ?will be
met with, when the treatment must be modified to suit each
case; but any effective plan of concentrating the sulphides
from the waste tailings, would at the same time save most
of the free gold lost in this form.
The pyritous gold is so closely incorporated with the iron
ores that it is not liberated in ordinary crushing; and even
if it could be so, it is in such a minute state of division
that the greater part of it would be lost, were it subjected
to the treatment found to be the best for obtaining the
coarser gold. Under the microscope, gold may be seen on
the broken faces of particles of sulphide, when the latter are
so small as to be nearly invisible to the naked eye, and much
of the pyritous gold is in this minute state of division. No
effectual plan has yet been discovered of extracting this gold
directly by amalgamation, on account of the injurious action of


the sulphur and arsenic in combining with and breaking up
the mercury.*
Such being the condition of the gold and metallic ores in
the quartz, we may now proceed to examine the plans most
in favour for extracting the free gold from the crushed
material.
The first of these is the use of mercury in the coffers, a
plan all but universally followed in this colony, although in
cases where the sulphides are in large quantities it is deci-
dedly injurious, and frequently causes a great loss of gold.
Where the quartz contains a large percentage of these
sulphides, they gradually accumulate in the beds or coffers,
until they are in sufficient quantity to sicken the amalgam
already formed. This has then a tendency to break up, and
passes away in minute globules, or else it adheres to the
particles of pyrites, and is carried away with them.
Instances are known where nearly all the free gold in the
quartz has been carried away in this form and lost. These
results are not confined to this colony alone. Kiistel, in
describing the processes used in California, says, when
mercury is used in the coffers, u a great many fine particles
of amalgam adhere together, and form small spongy
blackish lumps, which are so light as to float, and on
account of being coated with foreign matters, will not unite
with the accumulated amalgam. Of this amalgam very
little can be saved ; it floats over blankets, copper plates, or
ripples. It is, therefore, an error to use mercury in the
battery, if concentration is in use, and the tailings are not
saved. The finest gold is easier retained by concentration
than this floating amalgam.? He further states, that where
mercury is used in the coffers, and the gold is heavy, they
* This desideratum may yet be found; but the chance of at some
time finding it ought not to delay the adoption of the good practical
system already established.


retain from sixty to seventy-five per cent, of the gold
obtained, and where the gold is light, they get a less
favourable result.
Now this proportion is nearly the same as that we obtain
here from the coffers, without using mercury in them; and
so far the use of mercury in the battery does not show any
advantage.
The experience, therefore, both of this colony and
California indicates that the benefit derived from the use of
mercury in the coffers is not so great as is usually supposed,
and that in many cases it is injurious, as compared with the
system of using no mercury in the battery, but having an
effective concentrating process outside. Unless the latter
is present, no changes should be made without careful
experiment.
The ripples, or troughs filled with mercury, made use of
in this colony, are all based on the same principle ?the fall
of sand and water on to the surface of the mercury, when
the coarser particles of gold are taken up and remain in the
ripple. They are simple, inexpensive, and should retain
from twenty to twenty-five per cent, of the total yield,
where the gold is of average fineness.
The copper platforms are tables covered with sheets of
copper coated with mercury, and part of the gold or amalgam
in the sand and water from the battery, passing over them,
adheres to the mercury on the plate. These copper tables
are used in the great majority of our crushing plants, as
they are readily cleaned, and require little expenditure of
labour in attending to them. The strong hold they have
obtained here in practical working would seem to indicate
that they are the best known means of saving the gold.
But such is far from being the case, and the general favour
in which they are held has arisen more from the small cost
at which they are worked than from their intrinsic value, the


former property being rendered indispensable by the compe-
tition among the machine owners crushing for hire. When
the gold or amalgam adheres to the plate, the surface is
roughened, and the sand sweeping rapidly over it, is apt to
pick up minute particles of amalgam and carry them av\ aj.
This is so well known that few crushers would care to leave
the plates covered with amalgam while crushing an additional
poor lot of quartz, although the poor sand will not cany oft
more amalgam than the rich; only in the former case more is
carried away than is added; in the latter, the balance is on
the other side. This loss may be easily tested by cleaning
half of a copper plate well and equally charged with
amalgam, and then passing waste sand over the other part,
(in imitation of the conditions when the battery is at work,)
for a few days, when it will be found that a considerable
per-centage of the amalgam has been carried off. Without
the use of mercury in the coffers, these tables would be
very ineffective; and even with all the advantages that can
be given to them, the writer has met with no instance where
blanket strakes, placed at the end of coppered tables, have
not retained more or less gold, while the trials of copper
plates at the end of well-laid and worked blanket strakes
have hardly shown a trace of gold. In one experiment of
the latter kind, where the mercury was kept in a ripple box
at the bottom of the plates, and these brushed over with it
at short intervals to keep them sensitive, the mercury was
found to have lost some of the gold with which it was
charged when the trial began, and no gold was found on the
plates. As these tables were in such general use, great care
was exercised in testing their capabilities, but the result in
every case indicated that they had been far over-i ated.
The above views are supported by the experience of the
Californian miners. Under the heading ? Amalgamation
with copper-plated platforms and other copper fixings,


Kiistel only thinks it necessary to remark ? u Very imperfect
and mostly abandoned. ?
It would be well for our quartz crushers to weigh these
facts, and if they prefer still to retain the copper tables, at
least let them not neglect to take the precaution of laying
down blanket strakes at the end of them.
Blanket strakes have long been used for the concentration
of the gold in the South American mines, and even in the
pyritous mines where the gold is so fine as to be rarely seen
with the naked eye, they trust entirely to fine crushing, and
long ranges of strakes. That this trust is not misplaced the
trials made here, extending over a period of ten years, have
proved. One amalgamating machine after another has
succumbed before the efficiency of this simple plan, and it
will in time even replace the copper plates.
The principle of working strakes is to run the water and
sand over a long table, covered with woollen cloth, or tanned
skins?the fall of the table, and the quantity of material
running over it, being so arranged as to allow the heavier
particles to be retained by the rough surface, while the
lighter material is swept away with the water. These
tables should be built on a stout well-braced frame,
arranged so that the inclination can be altered at pleasure to
suit the varying quantity of water available. This frame is
planked over with stout Scotch flooring, and then divided
longitudinally into strakes from fifteen to eighteen inches
wide, by strips of wood two inches wide, nailed down to the
table. It is usually made plain; but a better plan is to
break it every three feet, with a drop of two inches on to the
next strake, as by this means the current of water is broken
at every three feet, and its velocity equalized. Great care
should be used in making the floor of the table smooth and
level ; and the blankets, when laid down, should adhere
closely to the wood, without wrinkling. In South America,


tanned skins, cut to the proper size, are made use of for
covering the strakes, those skins being chosen which have
fine short hair.
Trials made with similar skins prepared here, and close-
wove green baize, showed no perceptible difference in the
results, and therefore the latter article has been used. The
inclination of the table, and the amount of water and sand
passing over it, should be so proportioned just as to keep the
blankets clear, and any wrinkle or inequality should cause
them to choke with sand.
By this means every facility the system will allow is given
for the gold, and other metals or ores, to be retained on the
blankets.
The width of table allowed may be from twelve to fifteen
inches per stamp-head, and the length from eighteen to
thirty feet, this varying with the character of the gold,
quantity and quality of water, &c. The same conditions
must regulate the inclination of the table; but if there is
sufficient water, a fall of one in sixteen is considered tfye best
working arrangement.
The frequency with which the blankets are changed must
also depend on the character of the material operated on.
When this is of the ordinary description, the upper row may
be changed every hour, the second row every two hours.
On the remaining portion of the table, the blankets on the
upper half may be changed every six hours, those of the
lower half every twelve hours. Some quartz is so charged
with sulphides as to require the blankets to be changed
much more frequently, or there is occasionally a carbon-
aceous slate or clay mixed with it, which forms a slimy
covering on the blankets, soon destroying their effectiveness
as concentrators. In this respect, as in most others con-
nected with the extraction of gold, no fixed rule can be laid
downj the working details must be modified to suit


the conditions, and each establishment should ascertain
the best arrangement for the material they have to treat,
not copy their neighbours plans, whether suitable or other-
wise.
When the blankets are removed from the table they are
washed in a cistern, and the sand thus accumulated should
be barrelled to extract the free gold. The barrels are best
made of cast iron, and may be about four feet long by two
feet in diameter. This size will take a charge of from eight
to ten cwt. of sand, and from two hundred to three hundred
pounds of mercury, the quantity of the latter used depend-
ing in part on the amount of gold expected; but it is better
to have a large charge of mercury, there being more chance
of securing all the free gold, and less chance of losing
the mercury itself.
The barrel should be charged with damp sand, the mer-
cury added, and then be set to work for eight hours, at the
rate of from fourteen to sixteen revolutions per minute. The
mercury will break up and be distributed through the sand
in minute globules, thus bringing it in contact with the
particles of gold. The barrel should then be filled up with hot
water, and worked for some four hours more, the speed being-
reduced to five or six revolutions per minute, for the purpose
of collecting the mercury again.
When the process is finished the mercury is first drawn
off, and the contents of the barrel are then emptied into a
cistern. A large proportion of broken mercury and amalgam
will still remain in the sand, and the whole should therefore
be passed through some good concentrating machine to
separate the mercury and amalgam. On some works pieces
of iron are mixed with the sand, or an iron roller is placed
inside the barrel for the purpose of grinding the sand finer,
but the amount of benefit to be derived from this will depend
on the character of the sand. Where this contains a large


per-centage of the sulphides, the ruhhing or grinding action
assists them to sicken the mercury and amalgam, breaking
these up, and rendering it difficult to collect them together
again, when a large proportion is lost. Cases have occurred
where half the mercury used has been lost from this cause,
and no doubt a large proportion of the gold was lost at the same
time. Various means have been used to restore this sickened
mercury, sulphuric acid and iron filings, cyanide of potassium,
and sodium amalgam; and when there is any suspicion of
the mercury in the barrel being affected, it should be
examined, and, if necessary, some one of the above plans
should be used to restore it. Where the blanket sand is
heavily charged with sulphides, and the plant for extracting
the pyritous gold has been erected, it would be better to send
the sand direct to the furnace, either without or with further
concentration, according as the sands may be rich or other-
wise.
The relative proportions of gold obtained in each part of
the processes described will vary with its character; with
coarse gold a very large portion will remain in the coffers,
and when the gold is fine the proportion retained there
decreases, while that obtained outside the battery increases.
With quartz having the gold of average fineness, and where
mercury is not used in the coffers, the latter may give sixty-
six per cent., the ripple boxes twenty-three per cent., and
the blankets eleven per cent, of the total yield of gold.
The loss of mercury on a crushing establishment is a matter
of great importance, not from the value of the mercury only,
but because it usually indicates a corresponding loss of gold.
The greater part of the mercury passing away has been
ground to a fine grey slime; and when placed under the
microscope, it is found to consist of innumerable minute
globules of mercury, which will not coalesce. In many
cases this floured mercury is heavily charged with gold, so


much so as to be more correctly designated floured amalgam;
and sometimes, through ignorance or carelessness, a consi-
derable per-centage of the gold is lost in this way. It will
be seen, therefore, how necessary it is that the loss of
mercury from each part of the process should be ascertained
weekly or fortnightly, the cause and form of this loss deter-
mined, and a record kept of the results.
In the reduction works of California, the loss of gold
appears to be quite as great in amount, and to arise from the
same causes as that sustained here; but the system they
have adopted for its extraction is somewhat different. Their
most approved plan is to crush coarsely in the stamping mill,
and then to complete the reduction and amalgamate in
circular pans, with mullers revolving on the bottom, which
grind the coarse sand from the battery to a fine powder,
along with mercury. Numerous contrivances for this
purpose have been patented, but Wheeler?s pans, lately
introduced into this colony, are considered the most effective.
From the extensive use of these pans in the treatment of
mixed gold and silver ores, it is probable they are well
adapted for that purpose, although no statistics have yet
reached us that would allow of an exact comparison between
the results obtained from them and those obtained by means
of the longer-known processes. But I doubt if they would
be any improvement on the best plans now in use here for
the treatment of our auriferous quartz. Kiistel (who is
evidently a strong advocate for them) states that with these
pans, ninety-five per cent, of the total gold contents can be
extracted, provided the quartz is free from auriferous
sulphides, that is, if it is all free gold they have to deal with.
But with quartz of this kind, we could obtain nearly the
same result from the cheaper plans we now use; and as
well nigh all our veins yield sulphides in greater or less
quantities, we must face the problem as it is, not as it might


be. Judging from the trials already made, and the
established principles on which all our operations must be
founded, these pans are not likely to work satisfactorily on
our pyritous ores, and where the sulphides are in larg?e
quantities, much gold w'ould be lost. Some improvement
has been made in this respect, by first grinding the sand to
the degree of fineness required, and then liaising the muller
before the mercury is added, so as to have only a rubbing
action while they are used for amalgamating. How this
pan may answer for extracting the gold from the roasted
sulphides has yet to be proved, but for ordinary tailings it will
probably be equal to the arrastra, that is, it may retain
about one-third of the total gold contents of the sand.
The roasting of the quartz previous to crushing was, at
one time, an almost universal practice in this colony; but
this plan has been gradually abandoned on most of our
mining fields, indicating that increased experience has
proved the advantage gained was not equivalent to the extra
cost incurred. Roasting is still in use on some of our gold-
fields, where the sulphides are plentiful, and mercury is used
in the coffers. Under these circumstances, the partial
decomposition of the sulphides will decrease their tendency
to act on the mercury. But it is probable that a still better
result would be obtained by crushing the raw quartz without
mercury in the coffers, using a concentrating process outside;
and the settling of this point well deserves the attention of
the companies interested. Where it is intended to extract the
pyritous gold, after the free gold has been obtained, roasting
of the quartz before crushing is inadmissible, on account of
the partial decomposition of the sulphide increasing the
difficulty of separating them from the worthless sand.
In the course of experiments made at Clunes, it was
found that the greater the heat to which the quartz was
subjected, the greater was the loss of gold sustained. When

the sulphides were on the outside of the pieces of quartz
subjected to the roasting process, a glazed slag (mixed
silicates of iron and alumina) was formed, and throughout
this slag part of the gold was distributed in minute
particles, invisible to the naked eye. In the interior joints,
?where only partial decomposition had taken place?black
veins of melted sulphides were formed, with which the gold
appeared to be intimately intermixed, instead of collecting
together. The affinity of the mercury for the free gold was
greatly affected, and this has generally been ascribed to the
coating of the gold with a fine film of sulphur, although
careful microscopic examination, with high powers, failed
to detect any trace of this film. Lately, Mr. Latta has
discovered that bringing gold up to a red heat produces the
same effect,?the change being evidently confined to the
exposed surface, as it disappears on this surface being broken.
When antimony is present in the quartz in quantities that
will affect the mercury, it might be advisable to roast before
crushing, for the purpose of volatilising the antimony. But
even in these cases, it has yet to be seen whether still better
results would not be obtained by depending on the concen-
trating process, and treating all the concentrated material in
the same way as is used for the extraction of the pyritous gold.
Keeping before us the great loss inevitably sustained in
the redaction of gold ores, even with the best appliances
known, * it will be readily seen how greatly that loss may be

Arts, will show: ?


increased by any carelessness or want of knowledge on the
part of those in charge of the works. In nearly all the
crushing establishments of this colony the work is carried
on from day to day without an attempt being made to dis-
cover what is the amount lost, and in what form that loss
occurs. Yet it will be seen from the above details, that any
person having the control of these operations, should not
only be acquainted with the principles on which they ought
to be founded, but that he should be prepared to enter into
the investigations required to enable him to ascertain the
comparative efficiency of each part of the process.
For this purpose the mercury used should be carefully
weighed at short intervals, to ascertain what the loss is,
and in what part of the process it occurs. The tailings
should also be sampled as they leave the crushing-house
several times during the day, and the accumulated samples
tested at the end of each week or fortnight, to ascertain
what amount of gold is being lost. These samples may be
sent to any competent assayer, where exact returns are
required; but for ordinary work, rough assays by amal-
gamation, on the plan described in the Appendix, will be
sufficiently accurate for general use; as these will come
within fifteen per cent, of the actual gold contents, provided
they are made with due care. Records should be kept of
all these assays, and regular returns made, not only of the
amount of gold obtained, but also of the gold and mercury
lost, with full information as to how and where that loss
occurs. The rough and ready system of dealing with the
nice question of the extraction of gold, has been so long in
use in this colony, that many will be surprised at the pro-
posal that they should require such returns from the
managers of mines, yet they are made regularly in the gold
mines of Europe and South America, and in at least one of
our large mines. Without them, companies are working


entirely in the dark, and that in conducting operations
where the loss at the best is very great. It might he
supposed that there are not many companies in this colony
so apathetic as to prefer remaining in ignorance of the
extent of their loss, rather than enter on the active
endeavour to reduce it, such knowledge would force them
into. The outlay of a few shillings per week for material,
and a little extra work for the manager, can hardly be
considered a sufficient excuse for not prosecuting these
investigations, and there can be no doubt they would result
in a largely increased yield of gold.
The above notes refer to the extraction of the free gold
only, and the treatment required to obtain the pyritous gold,
the form in which probably eighty per cent, of the loss now
sustained occurs, has yet to be considered.
The ores with which great part of the gold now lost, is
incorporated, are the iron and arsenial pyrites, the former
being usually the richest in gold. They are found in greater
or less quantities in all our quartz veins, the proportion in
some cases reaching as high as ten per cent, of the vein stone,
and varying in gold contents from a trace up to fifty ounces
per ton.
Instances have been known where the sulphides have
yielded over one thousand ounces of gold per ton, but these
were no doubt exceptional cases. As a general rule, the value
of the sulphides will be in proportion to their per-centage in
the quartz, and the amount of free gold obtainable by the
ordinary process. While the sulphides in the heart of the
Vein may be rich, those in the slate immediately adjoining it
are usually poor; and even in the vein itself there is great
difference in their value. No trial .of a single sample will,
therefore, be any criterion of the average yield of the sulphides
in a vein; any more than such trial would be of the average
yield of the quartz.


The best test is to take a fair sample of the ordinary waste
tailings, or the waste blanket sand, after the free gold has
been extracted by the methods in nse for that purpose, wash
out the sulphides, and take a sample for assay. If this is
done with due care, some trust may be placed in the results
obtained; but the necessity for this care cannot be too
strongly enforced, lest companies should be led into unwar-
ranted expenditure in the endeavour to obtain gold which may
not exist.
It may not be out of place to note here the principal
characteristics of the iron ores to be treated.
The iron pyrites is a bisulphide of iron, crystallizing in the
form of the cube. The colour varies from bronze yellow to
nearly silver white.
Faces of the crystals frequently striated. Brittle, but does
not yield to the knife, and by this property it may be distin-
guished from copper pyrites, which it readily scratches

These ores are usually found together in the veins, some-
times one, sometimes the other, predominating. Galena is
frequently associated with them ; the chemical composition of
this ore being?
Lead, 85 parts.
Sulphur, 13 parts.
A trace of gold in chemical combination has been found in
the iron ores, but the quantity was so little that it may be


left out of the calculation, nearly all the gold being deposited
mechanically, in minute particles in the sulphides, great part
of them so small as to be invisible to the naked eye, and some
of them requiring a good microscope to determine whether
they are gold or not.
In all mining countries where attention has been given to
the saving of this gold, the plans tried were first directed
towards treating the tailings in bulk, by re-grinding and
amalgamating, or some analogous plan ; but from the fineness
of the gold it must be evident that the reduction of all the
tailings to such a gauge as would allow the pyritous gold to
be liberated, could only be effected at an expense greater than
the value of the gold that would be obtained. Such grinding
as can be practically given to it by the best machines known,
has extracted about one-third of the gold contents, and this at
such a cost as to leave only a small margin for profit, unless
the tailings were exceptionally rich. Even in the latter case,
they will probably contain such a per-centage of sulphides as
would materially affect the amalgamation, and thus bring up
another objection. As, however, it appears that with good
arrangements for extracting the free gold, the bulk of the gold
lost is only that enveloped in the sulphides, by separating the
latter from the worthless sand (and in doing this most of the
free gold escaping would be retained also), we obtain the gold
in a small quantity of rich material that will pay for the
more costly processes required to extract it. By this means,
probably nine-tenths of the worthless sand, and the cost of
operating on it, will be got rid of, and the one-tenth retained
will consist of sulphides, and particles of quartz sand envelop-
ing gold, of a small proportion of free gold, and more or less
sand not containing any gold,?the quantity of the latter
depending on the efficiency of the concentrating process used,
and the extent to which it is carried.
The greatest advance which has hitherto been made towards


the saving of the pyritons gold has resulted from the follow-
ing up of this system, although before bringing it to perfec-
tion there ?'re still some difficulties to be surmounted. The
principal of these is the complete concentration of the
sulphides from the worthless sand.
The specific gravity of the quartz is about 2'6, and that of
iron pyrites (our great gold bearing ore) is about 4 ?7, this
small difference offering great obstructions to their perfect
separation, as all persons acquainted with practical ore-dress-
ing will at once perceive. But this difficulty is increased
through the pyrites being so much more friable than the
quartz, great part of it being in consequence crushed into
a fine powder, which cannot be separated from the sand by
any of the common ore-dressing machines now in use.
The sulphides hitherto operated on consist of the larger
particles retained on the blanket strakes, or separated from
the waste tailings by means of Mr. Munday?s patent buddle.
But even this amount of saving is well worthy the attention
of mining companies, as the results obtained at the Clunes
works for some years past prove" beyond a doubt, seeing it
would add at least �300,000 per annum to the returns from
our quartz mines, and by doing so, double the profits derived
from them. There is now, however, a certainty that the con-
centration may be carried much further than it has hitherto
been, by means of the improved percussion table.f
* The returns from the Clunes works, of the working of the pyritous
ores from their waste tailings, for the year ending September, 1867, were
as follows:
268 tons of concentrated material operated on, containing, by assay,
3 oz. 9 dwt. 3 grs. of gold per ton.

t Since these notes were written further improvements have been
made in the working of the patent buddle.


The system adopted for the treatment of the sulphides is
simple and easily understood, being merely the elimination of
the sulphur and arsenic, and the conversion of the iron into
an oxide, so as to liberate the gold, and allow mercury to be
used for its extraction.
A plan based on the same principle was long used for
dealing with the pyritous ores of North Carolina and South
America. The ores were first crushed, and the gold thus
liberated taken out; they were then exposed to the action of
the atmosphere for a year, to allow of natural decomposition
and oxidation, when they were again re-treated; the gold
obtained in the second operation being nearly the same
amount as in the first; and this was repeated for four or five
years, by which time the gold was exhausted.
By the plan now followed, instead of waiting for four or
five years for the oxidation of the sulphides, the process is
completed in two hours in an oxidating furnace.
If the pyrites is brought up to a dull red heat, in an open
vessel or furnac�, the oxygen of the air will combine with the
sulphur, arsenic, and iron, forming the pyrites; the two first
constituents pass off in the form of sulphurous and arsenious
acids, and the iron will be converted into a brown or red
oxide. This change can be effected in the ordinary reverbe-
ratory furnace, but the time and labour expended in raking
over the material until every portion of it has been exposed
to the action of the air for a sufficient time to ensure its
decomposition, renders this a slow and costly process. The
oxidating furnace now in use at Chines (designed by Mr.
Latta) remedies these defects. In this, the fire is applied in
a similar way to that of the ordinary reverberatory furnace,
but provision is made for throwing in a superabundance of
heated air. The bed is from thirty to forty feet long, and
from five to six feet wide, set at an angle of about twenty
degrees, and there is an opening for the discharge of the


roasted sand, between tlie lower end of the bed and the
bridge of the furnace. It is fed at the upper end, and the
material is gradually raked down the inclined bed, which is
thus kept covered with a thin layer of sand. In travelling
down the bed, every portion of the sand is exposed to the
action of the air, and it is found that about two hours
exposure in the furnace is sufficient to allow of the complete
oxidation of the pyrites. The action is continuous, small
charges of the raw material being fed in at the upper end, to
supply the vacancy caused by the drawing off from the
bottom. A dull red heat is found to be the most effective,
and the sand is quenched with water as it leaves the furnace.
The gold is still for the most part enclosed in the particles
of oxide of iron, and a grinding process is required to
liberate it, and facilitate its absorption by the mercury. The
plan hitherto used is to grind the moistened sand under
broad-faced Chilian rollers, in charges of two hundred pounds
weight each, with one hundred pounds of mercury. The
latter is broken up, and distributed through the moist sand
in myriads of small globules, thus bringing it into contact
with the minute particles of gold. After this grinding and
amalgamating has been carried on for half-an-hour, water is
admitted, and the mercury collects together again. The sand
is then flushed into a cistern, and the mill re-charged. From
the cistern the sand is run through concentrators, for the
purpose of collecting the finely-ground mercury which passes
off with the sand from the mill.
Taking the average of the last twelve months? work at
Clunes, eighty-six per cent, of the total gold contents of the
pyrites treated was obtained by this means, and it is probable
that considerable improvements will yet be made. One of
these would be the grinding of the roasted sand to a fine
powder previous to amalgamation. In this way a more
thorough disintegration of the sand would be effected than is


practicable in the mill, and the surface of the gold would be
burnished, so as to restore its affinity for the mercury, injured
by the heat to which it had been subjected. This plan will
shortly be tested.
The system of extracting gold known as Plattner?s process,
from its having first been brought into practical operation by
him at Reichenstein, in Germany, is founded on the affinity
of chlorine for gold. The ground ores are first roasted, and
then put into shallow vessels with a false bottom. The
chlorine gas is obtained by putting the proper equivalents of
manganese, common salt, and sulphuric acid, into a generator,
and w'hen heat is applied, the gas is evolved and conducted
under the false bottoms of the cisterns. When the latter are
fully charged with gas (which may be known from its rising
through and resting on the sand), they are closed up for from
twelve to thirty-six hours, to allow time for the combination
of the* chlorine and gold. The chloride of gold formed being
soluble in water, it is dissolved out of the sand, and the gold is
then precipitated from the solution by the addition of sulphate
of iron. If this process is carefully conducted, nearly all the
gold will be obtained. The labour attending it is not great,
but the cost in this colony of the chemicals required has
hitherto been the great objection. This cost would be much
reduced if the manufacture of sulphuric acid from the
sulphides were combined with the extraction of the gold,
and the formation of an establishment for this purpose, in a
central position, would be attended with great benefit to the
quartz miners.
Many attempts have been made to extract the gold from
the sulphides in their raw state, for the purpose of avoiding
the cost of eliminating the sulphur and arsenic by roasting.
But even with the use of sodium amalgam and other
chemicals, the trials hitherto made have not been attended
with satisfactory results up to the present time. Fine


grinding in mills or barrels with mercury alone will not
extract a fair proportion of the pyritous gold. Still, many
of our crushers keep trying this plan ; and having extracted a
part of the gold, at once jump to the conclusion that they
have obtained it all, or nearly all. Unless these trials are
properly conducted, they may lead to much useless expen-
diture, and to the formation of opinions having no sound
basis to rest upon, but which may have a most injurious
effect in delaying substantial progress. Before any trust can
be placed in such experiments, the character of the gold to
be saved, and the per-centage that can be extracted by the
processes now in use, should be known. The exact amount
that can be obtained by the new plan, and that still left in
the sand, will then give the data requisite for making a fair
comparison, and show if any advance has been made. It
might be supposed that to advocate such an obviously neces-
sary precaution is hardly required; yet through neglect of it
large sums of money have been thrown away, and the false
opinions and prejudices it has fostered offer no trifling
obstacles to the dissemination of correct views.
In most instances the gold obtained in these trials is free
gold, which ought to have been extracted by the ordinary
appliances already considered, had these been efficient and
suited to the work. Let our crushers try any method of
saving the gold they are now losing, which their experience
may suggest, but no conclusions should be drawn from such
trials until it has been ascertained by exact assay what gold
is left in the sand after it has been operated on.* Any one
* This caution is applicable to other places besides this colony. One
of the largest gold mining companies of South America for years took
great credit to themselves for the large returns obtained in re-treating a
portion of their tailings. When the work came to be closely looked
into, it was found that out of 45 ozs. of gold contained in the 50 tons
re-treated daily, they obtained about VI ozs., a result anything but
satisfactory.


entering on the path of experimental research should hold his
opinions and theories loosely, prepared to abandon or change
them as each addition to his experience may direct; and unless
he is imbued with this spirit, it would be almost better to fall
back into the ranks of those who hold that ignorance is bliss.
Taking the question as it now stands, it has certainly been
proved in the most convincing way?viz., by practical
working on a large scale, carried on for several years?that
the coarser particles of the sulphides in the waste tailings,
may be separated, and the gold extracted by a process which
even now shows a profit of over seventy per cent, of the value
of the gold obtained, and that in dealing with sulphides con-
taining under three and a half ounces of gold per ton, thus
showing that even one ounce of gold per ton would do more
than pay the cost of operating. With the richer sulphides
present on most of our gold fields, the profits would be propor-
tionally larger.
These facts are incontrovertible, and they have been open
to any one who would have enquired for the last three years;
yet, strange to say, they have attracted little attention, and
even when pressed upon the notice of mining companies, it is
difficult to overcome the indifference which exists in all
matters connected with the improvement of the great interest
of the colony.
When the erection of a plant for the extraction of the
pyritous gold would be inconvenient, the richer sulphides
might be shipped to England, where an unlimited market
will be found for them. One parcel sent there was sold by
its gold contents, at the rate of �3 10s. per ounce, and the
agents reported ? that as the working of these ores becomes
? better understood in England (a result immediately conse-
? quent on a steady supply) so a keen competition will arise,
? and an extreme value be realized.?
A very large proportion of the sulphides are crushed so fine
that they cannot be separated from the waste sand by the


plans hitherto used; and, for several years past, experiments
have been carried on, with the view of discovering some
dressing machine that would effect this object. A percussion
table, so modified as to remedy the defects of that ore dresser,
has been designed and worked for some time past by the
writer; the trials hitherto made indicating that it will save
a very large proportion of the fine pyrites, which has, up to
this time, escaped from all other machines tried. The object
of these notes, however, is not to press on the notice of the
mining community an invention in which the writer is per-
sonally interested, and where doubts might be felt as to the
accuracy of results obtained by him in working these tables.
But the question of a more intelligent application of the
principles on which the methods adopted for the reduction of
gold ores should be based, and of the saving of the pyritous
gold, is in a different position. Here we have facts and
statistics to rely on, over which the writer has no control, and
such as no reasonable man can doubt. To the enquiry, if on
one mine where the sulphides are comparatively poor, and in
small quantities, over �2,000 per annum can be realized by
operating on them, what would be the effect of the general
adoption of the system on the mining interest and the
colony ] Only one reply can be given. It is for those inte-
rested to determine how long they can afford to throw away
gold needlessly, and neglect the profits that might be derived
from this source; but in no other pursuit than gold mining
would a matter of such importance to its successful prose-
cution be passed over, even for an hour. The market for
gold is practically an unlimited one, so that the price is
uniform; and there can hardly be a stronger illustration of the
beneficial action of competition on human progress, and the
apathy and want of enterprise attending its absence, _than the
present state of this question.
Both in the mechanical and metallurgical operations


attending the treatment of gold ores, the plan followed
should depend on the character of the gold and the minerals
associated with it in the vein, instead of one system being
employed for all, whether it is adapted to the material to
be operated on or not. The loss with the best arrange-
ments must be a large one, considering the great value of
the metal obtained, and therefore every separate part of
the work should be carefully watched, and its action and
results investigated; for little improvement can be expected
unless the degree of efficiency attained, and the extent and
character of the difficulties to be overcome, are first known.
For this purpose some metallurgical knowledge is no
doubt required; but that necessary in the present case is
of such a simple character as to be within the reach of
every man possessed of ordinary ability, and there is no
excuse for anyone accepting the responsibility attending
the conducting of a crushing establishment, without making
himself acquainted with the principles on which the opera-
tions must be based, if they have to be carried on creditably
to himself, or with the greatest amount of profit to the
company, who have entrusted their business to him.
We are inclined to look back to the days when the rich
surface quartz was broken up by hand, or by some roughly
constructed machine, with mixed feelings of wonder aud
pity for the ignorance which then prevailed. In a few
years we shall probably regard the waste of the present
time in a similar light, and the sooner we set about
providing a remedy for the existing evils, the better will it
be for all parties concerned.


APPENDIX.
The following description of a plan used for testing the
value of the waste, may be of some use to those not
already acquainted with it.
Sampling from Stamps.? When the object is to
ascertain the value of the tailings after leaving the ordinary
process for extracting the gold, the plan adopted may be
as follows:
Take a new bucket (to be kept solely for this purpose),
and place it under the spout carrying otf the tailings from
the mills, until it is full of sand and water, not allowing
it to run over. This should then be emptied into a filter,
?the process being repeated six or eight times in the
twenty-four hours.
To form the filter, take an ordinary cask with one end
out, and a hole at the bottom to allow the water to run off.
This cask is set on end, and a piece of canvas or strong
calico is thrown over it, and thrust down so as to form a
bag in the cask, ?a hoop being slipped on to keep it in its
place, and a loose lid fitted to the cask to prevent dust or
gold from getting into it. The water gradually filters
through the canvas or calico, leaving the solid matter
behind. After the process has been continued for a few
days, the contents may be emptied into a clean tub, well
mixed together, and the quantity required for assay taken
out.


Sampling from Heaps. ?Sections should be opened on
different parts of the heap, and a cut taken from the top
to the bottom of each, so as to get about an equal quantity
from each section, and the sand so obtained should be well
mixed together.
In sampling both from the mill and heap great care
should be taken to use enamelled dishes, clean tubs, &c.,
to make sure that the gold obtained belongs to the sample,
and has not come from any other source. Unless this is
attended to, the result of the assays cannot be depended on.
Amount op Sulphides, ?This may be roughly deter-
mined by taking, say fifty-six pounds from the sample
when dry, and washing it several times over with great
care, to separate the sulphides. The latter may then be
dried and weighed, and the amount per ton easily calculated.
Amount of Gold. ?The assay for this should be first
from the general sample of tailings, and second from the
clean sulphides obtained as described above. If an exact
assay is required, one or two pounds weight of each
(taking care that these are fair specimens of the bulk),
may be sent to some assayer of standing, who will make
a return of the total gold contents that can be depended on.
Or rough assays may be made on the spot, which,
although not giving the full amount of gold in the sample,
will yet come within fifteen per cent, of it, if carefully
carried out in the following way :
Assay by Amalgamation. ?The sample to be tested
must be dried and weighed. If it is a rich sulphide, one
pound weight will give a sufficient trial, ?if poorer material,
from two to five pounds may be used. The first point is to
roast the sand, and this may be done over an ordinary fire,
in an iron frying-pan, or on an iron plate. The sand should
be spread thinly on this, brought up to a red heat, and
frequently raked to expose every part of it to the action of


the air. The roasting should be continued until no smell
of sulphur can be felt on bringing a portion of the sand
close to the face; and to finish it a smart heat should then
be kept up for half-an-hour. If in the amalgamation the
mercury is affected, this will probably arise from imperfect
roasting.
When the sand is taken off the fire, it should be left to
cool for a short time, and then be rubbed to a fine powder
in a wedgwood mortar; an iron one might have gold
adhering to it. A convenient quantity (say from half a
pound to a pound) of this may then be taken, and sufficient
water added to clamp the sand, and make the particles
adhere together. This is placed in the wedgwood mortar,
with from two to three ounces of mercury, and the whole
ground together for twenty minutes. The mercury will
break up into globules, and be distributed throughout the
damp sand. Water must then be added, and the pestle
worked slowly round, when the mercury will collect again.
The sand should then be washed off, and the process
repeated (using the same mercury) until the sample has
all been operated on. The mercury must then be carefully
washed, to free it from every particle of quartz or iron, as
these would otherwise remain with the gold, and render the
assay incorrect.
The easiest way of thoroughly cleaning the mercury is to
pour it from one saucer into another several times, washing
the saucers each time they are emptied to get rid of the
particles adhering to them. The water should then be taken
off with a clean sponge, or piece of rag, and the mercury
covered with nitric acid. The acid will first be coloured
green, then orange fumes will be given off, and as it becomes
saturated with nitrate of mercury, it will clear again, when
the acid should be poured off, and a fresh charge added. As
soon as the mercury is all dissolved the gold will be seen in


the cup or glass vessel used, in the form of a dark brown
powder. The acid should then he poured off, and clean
water added several times to wash out any acid that may still
be adhering to the gold. The latter may then be dried and
weighed. Before using mercury for an assay, a small por-
tion should be dissolved in nitric acid to make sure that it
does not contain gold.
If, from any carelessness, the white nitrate of mercury is
deposited, it is better to stop, and wash the mercury clean,
as described above, before going on with the process. The
sample of gold obtained should also be examined with a
magnifying glass, and if there are any particles of quartz, or
other extraneous matter still mixed with it, an allowance
should be made for these in weighing. Fine scales that
will weigh to the twentieth part of a grain should be used for
weighing, and this should be done as soon as the sample is
dried, for the gold is in such a fine state of division, that a
portion is almost certain to be lost in handling it.
With care and a little experience the assay by amalgama-
tion will be found sufficiently accurate to guide ordinary
work, although the return will always be less than the
actual gold contents of the sample; but it should not be
entirely relied on ; as the presence of some minerals might
seriously affect the result. Occasionally, therefore, correct
assays should be obtained, both as a check on the rough
assays, and also in cases where great exactness is required.
