OF THE WHOLE OF THR
P4SSEM9ERS
A\ I� PART OF
The CREW
OF THE SRA lIORSK,
On her Homeward Passage from Sydney, and
the Plunder of 18,000 ounces of Gold by the
Murderers.
We have just received intelligence of
one of the most daring cases of plunder
and wholesale murder on the high seas
that it is our duty to make public for
many years. It appears that the crew
?and thirteen passengers of the ill-fated
ship, the Sea Horse, some of whom had
been seeking to better their condition by
toiling at the diggings of Ballarat, Ben-
digo, and the several numerous diggings
of the surrounding country, whilst others
had gained a respectable position in life,
by mercantile and other pursuits, all re-
turning light-hearted and elated by their
good success to the land of their birth,
and to look on the dear faces, and glad-
den the hearts of the dear ones they
had left at home, but whom they were
doomed never to meet no more on enrtVi
f i erew T . x Spaniard known
by the ne of Digo Salvesata, and three
others, who were tempted by a love of
gold to gain possession of the valuable
cargo, to do which, they conceived the
horrid idea of putting the whole of the
.passengers and that part of the crew
who would not join them to death. The
following are the facts of this demon-
like outrage: ?It appears that the Sarah
Ann of North Shields on their passage
home was driven by the gales into the
German ocean, and it was in sight of
the white cliffs of Old England that
these horrible murders wereicornrnitted,
As the Sarah Ann was laying at anchor
on the morning of the 12th, at day-break
they saw through the' fog the .ill-fated
vessel, and not seeing any one on deck
they hailed her, and on receiving no an-
swer a boat was immediately lowered,
and they went on board, and on getting
below a shocking sight met their gaze,
with one exception, the whole of the
aspsengers and the remainder of the crew
were in their berths stiff and cold, with
their throats cut, and otherwise dread-
fully disfigured. One poor man had a
piece of dirty sheet tied tightly round his
throat, and about eight inches of it stuffed
tightly into his mouth. On this being
removed, there was a large wound in
the throat four inches in extent from
right to left ; there were five incisors on
the right side ending in one deep one oa
the left. The windpipe was cut through
and the muscles of the neck on the left
side; the forehead was contused and
scratched. The hair was covered with
blood. On the back part of the right
hand there were several scratche. Most
of the victims were more or less muti-
lated. On going to the Captain?s cabi�
ancther shocking sight presented
he was laying completely hacked to
pieces, his tongue was completely cut out
at the root, and his entrails strewed oiu
the cabin floor, showing that there had
been a terrible struggle ; it appears from
the statement of a man who had stowed,
in the hold to escape the slaughter, that
the second mate, who is one of the mur-
derers, treated the passengers and the
rest of the crew with some grog in which
some laudnum was mixed, which ren-
dered them senseless, and while in that
helpless state murdered them in the man-
ner described, they afterwards went to
the Captain?s cabin, who fought bravely
but was overpowered by numbers, they
then took all the gold they could find
and lowered the long boat and made off
with their ill-gotten gains. The tiller
of the bout has been found, so whether
they have escaped and sent the boat
adrift is not known, but search is being
made after the murderers, and we hope
they will soon be taken, and meet with
their just reward
You landsmen and you seamen bold,
Attention give to me.
While I a tragedy unfold,
Upon the briney sea ;
In the German ocean it occurred.
Near the sight of land,
Twenty-eight fell victims
To the cursed murderers? hands.
The Sea Horse it from Sydney sailed,
Bound for Old England?s shore,
Wiith crew and thirteen passengers,
Whose fate we now deplore ;
Returning home with hard-earned gold,
Acioss the briney main,
But alas! the ones they loved at home,
They ne?er will see again.
Four of the crew they laid a plan,
The passengers to slay,
And with the gold they dearly earnt,
O?er the seas to bear away ;
These murderers were led away,
All by their thirst for gold,
nd their victims they did cruelly slay.
Most shocking to unfold.
In some grog they mixed some laudnum
And soon they fell asleep,
And then these wretened monsters
To their victim?s berths did creep ;
Then to the Captain?s cabin,
Intent on blood did steer,
And mangled his poor body,
How dreadful for to hear.
The Sarah Ann from North Shields,
As by the facts appear,
Saw the poor ill-fated ship.
And boarded it we hear;
nd found the gory victims?
How shocking for to read,
May the murderers soon be taken
n I suffer for their deeds.
