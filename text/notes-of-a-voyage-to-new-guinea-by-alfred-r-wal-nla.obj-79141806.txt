The bar would seem rather to be due to the action of the waves
which strive to continue the line of coast. The river bears its
mud far out to sea, leaving the coarser particles near the coast.
The waves beat these up and mix with them shells and other
productions of the sea. The bar is formed where the*waves break
on the coast and struggle to stop the river current.
If this current is carried out into the deep water, the supporters
of the pier system expect that the bar will not re-form until the
general line of coast shall have advanced so far that the breakers
again begin to beat upon the shore in front of the current, and
when that place the piers must be prolonged.
The advance of the coast at the mouth of the St. George has
always been slower than on the northern and central portion of
the Delta, which is considered to be due to the strong action of
the littoral current at this point. It is expected that for a long
course of years this current will keep the mouth of the piers free
from obstruction by a new bar.
The navigation of the Danube numbers at present rather more,
on an average, than 2000 vessels a year, having a burden of nearly
500,000 tons.
The greater part of these vessels enter in ballast, and load with
corn, principally Indian corn. Wheat and other grain, horns,
timber, hides, tallow, and salt are also exported.
The timber, a soft pine, is rafted down from the Carpathian
Mountains to Galatz, whence it is either shipped or formed into
much larger rafts for towing to the Bosphorus.
In Bulgaria there is abundance of oak of a description well
suited for ship-building, but the Turks will not allow it to be cut
for sale; although the forests are seriously injured to a large extent
by the peasants, who may cut down the finest trees at their
pleasure for firewood, a licence which they abuse most wantonly.
The Turkish law relative to oak timber acts very detrimentally
upon ships frequenting the Danube, as they have difficulty and
are put to immense expense in procuring hard timber for repairs,
although abundance is close to them.
The Danube and neighbouring lakes abound in fish of various
kinds, of which the sturgeon or maron is especially fine. Large
quantities are taken yearly, from which excellent caviar and oil are
obtained; the flesh is salted down.
The fisheries are farmed by the Government to individuals who
have the exclusive right to fish.


XV. ?Notes of a Voyage to New Guinea. By Alfred R.
Wallace, Esq., f.r.g.s.
m Head, June 27, 1859.
Having been for three months the sole European inhabitant of the
vast island of New Guinea, I trust a few notes of my visit may
prove interesting, in the absence of much definite information as to
that remote and imperfectly known country. Even at Macassar,
Amboyna, and Ternate, whence a considerable trade is carried on
with the north-western coasts and adjacent islands, I could learn
nothing, except about one or two spots which had been visited by
my informants ; and even as regards them, the points on which I
was most interested had seldom been inquired into. I was led to
believe there were several places where the natives had been suffi-
ciently in communication with Mahomraedan and European traders
to render it safe to reside among them. I have now ascertained,
however, that there is on the main land only one such place, viz.,
Dorey; where more than thirty years ago the inhabitants were
found by Lesson and Duperrey to be quiet and inoffensive.
According to the best information I have been able to obtain, there
are at the present time absolutely no other inhabitants than the
native Papuans over the whole of this great island. Not a single
Malay, or Bugis, or Ceramese settlement exists, though several are
scattered over the outlying islands; the principal being at Sal-
watty, a large island, forming the apparent north-west extremity of
New Guinea, from which it is separated by a very narrow strait.
The statement often found on maps that New Guinea is ? inhabited
by Papuans and Malays,? is therefore incorrect.
The whole northern peninsula of New Guinea, as well as the
islands of Wagion, Salwatty, and Balauta, are exceedingly rugged
and mountainous. There is a continued succession of jagged and
angular ranges of hills, and everywhere behind them, ridge beyond
ridge stretch far away into the interior. Over the whole country
spreads an unvarying forest, of a somewhat stunted appearance,
broken only by the very widely-scattered clearings of the natives
on the lower slopes. Near Dorey the loftier mountains retire a
little backward, and seem to reach their greatest altitude in the
Arfak range, which the officers of the Coquille ascertained to have
an elevation of 9500 feet. Dorey harbour, or bay, is formed by a
long, low promontory, curving round towards the Arfak range,
which rises abruptly from the opposite side of the bay. Towards
the extremity of this promontory is situated the village of Dorey,
and opposite, at about a mile, is the inhabited island of Man-
sinam, and a smaller one uninhabited. At the village of Dorey I
built a rough jungle-house, in which I resided for three months,


occupying myself (in the intervals of fever) with exploring the
natural history of the surrounding district
The Dorey promontory is a raised coral reef, and, geologically
speaking, a very recent one. The beach is a mass of dead and
broken coral, not yet ground into sand, and quite impracticable for
walking; and from this beach up into the jungle, and even on to
the hill, to the height of 200 or 300 feet, there is scarcely a per-
ceptible change in the coral rock, and the masses of coral and
shells that everywhere strew the surface. In some of the gulleys,
however, I found traces of a core of stratified rock. During my
whole stay at this place rain was the rule, sunshine the exception.
On half the days there was heavy rain, on half the remainder a
continual drizzle, or intermitting showers, while even on fine days
there was often a dull haziness in the atmosphere, very different
from our usual notions of the sunshine of the tropics. The last
month of my stay should have been the dry season, but, if there
was any difference, it was rather wetter and cloudier than before.
Neither were the winds any more to be depended on than the
weather. According to theory , we went in the west moonsoon and
came back in the east; but we found the winds directly opposite
in both cases, whenever it was not a dead calm, and thus made
seventeen afid sixteen days? passages of a distance of 500 miles.
The inhabitants of Dorey live always on the coast, or more
properly in the sea, as they always build their houses at or below
low-water mark, raised on posts, and reached by a rough and
tottering causeway from the beach. Of all houses I have yet met
with, these are the most wretched. They are very low and long,
and the roof is shaped like the bottom of a boat. Old mats,
cocoa-nut leaves, broken boats, and bits of board, make a dwell-
ing such as some shipwrecked sailors might hastily set up for a
temporary night?s shelter, but which it seems hardly credible that
any people should contentedly live in. The natives of the interior
do not differ perceptibly in physical character, but have a distinct
language, and are called ? Arfaki ? by the Doreyans. Their
houses are very similar, but are raised 12 or 15 feet high, on a
perfect forest of thin poles, a few of which are put diagonally, and
prevent the whole from falling with the first wind. It is singular
that these people know the use of diagonal struts, whereas the
comparatively civilized Bugis and Macassar-men are quite ignorant
of it, their houses being invariably inclined to one side by the
prevalent winds, and only kept from falling by the posts being
pretty firmly set in the ground, and the building connected with
them framed strongly of bamboos. The Doreyans are fishers and
traders, the Arfakis are agriculturists. The former catch turtle
and tripang, which they sell for beads, knives, and cloth, and pur-
chase of the Arfakis their rice and yams, plantains and bread-


fruits, and numbers of tame cockatoos and lories, which they sell
again to the Ternate and Tidore traders. All these natives have
the characters of the Papuan race very strongly marked; ?the flat
forehead, heavy brows, and large nose, with the apex bent down-
wards, are almost universal, as well as the harsh curly hair, which
often forms an enormous stiff mop, and is then highly esteemed.
It has, in fact, a very grand and imposing effect. The colour of the
skin varies greatly. In general it is a dirty black, or sooty colour,
but varies to a fine brown, which is often quite as light as that of
the pure Malay races. Skin disease is very common, and in the
children scrofulous diseases abound, which are seldom seen in
adults; it is probable, therefore, that the former die from neglect.
The men wear the ordinary strip of bark cloth, the women gene-
rally a Bugis sarong, or any piece of cloth or matting they can
obtain. Tattooing is generally practised ; slightly by the men, but
much more extensively by the women, who usually have the whole
chest covered with elegant tracery, following the curves of the
bosom. The females, however, are, without exception, the least
engaging specimens of the fair sex it has yet been my fortune to
meet
In mental and moral characteristics the Papuans differ remark-
ably from the Malay races. They are much more impulsive, and
do not conceal their emotions and passions. They are inquisitive,
talk much and loudly, and laugh boisterously ; reminding one of
the negro character, as much as of the negro form and aspect.
The natives of Dorey are not to be trusted in anything where
payment is concerned. If they do not actually steal, it is, lam
inclined to think, only from fear of consequences. They are, how-
ever, not a fair sample of the New Guinea tribes, having been too
much in contact with the lowest class of Mahomraedan traders, with
whom they find it necessary to take every advantage in self-
defence. They possess the rude artistic genius of so many of the
Oceanic tribes, decorating their household utensils and the prows
of their canoes with elaborate carving, and the posts of their coun-
cil-house with obscene caryatides.
The language of the Doreyans resembles that of the Aru and
Ke Islands in containing a large number of monosyllabic words,
as well as others excessively polysyllabic, offering a remarkable
contrast to the striking dissyllabic character of the whole Malayan
group of languages. It exhibits also the Polynesian characteristic
of several distinct terms for certain objects according to the prefixed
pronoun; thus, ?my head,? ? your head,? ? his head,? are ex-
pressed by three distinct words. This language, or mutually in-
telligible forms of it, is spoken by the coast-dwellers over an ex-
tensive area?at Amberbaki, 100 miles west, in the islands of
Wagion, My for, Jobie, and Mysory?and at Amber poea and some


other islands in the great bay, the natives can converse with those
of Dorey, and seem very similar to them in appearance and
habits. They are evidently a wandering race, answering to the
Bajees, or sea gipsies, of the Indian Archipelago.
I found Dorey very unhealthy, and altogether a very disagree-
able place to stay at, but I was obliged to remain till a schooner
trading farther east returned to Ternate. Fevers, remittent and
intermittent, with dysentery, were very prevalent, and after the
first fortnight I generally had two and often three of my servants
ill at the same time. One died of dysentery, and 1 was myself
ill at least half the time of my residence in New Guinea. Neither
was I rewarded by great success in my researches ; on the con-
trary I found Dorey a very bad locality ; the low grounds a quag-
mire, the hills rugged and impracticable, while the principal ob-
jects of my search, the rarer species of Paradise-birds, were not to
be found. M. Lesson had obtained quantities of native speci-
mens, but now even of these none were to be obtained.
The principal article of trade on the northern coast of New
Guinea is a fragrant aromatic bark, called mussoeg, which is carried
to Java, where the natives extract an oil of great reputed efficacy
as a remedy for various disorders. This is obtained only at one
locality, Wandammen, deep in the great, bay. Besides this, tor-
toise-shell is an important article of trade, with a small quantity
of beche-de-mer and sago. Wild nutmegs are also plentiful, and
in the district about Macluer Inlet a small schooner obtains an
annual cargo.
The Dutch Government have taken possession of New Guinea
up to the meridian of 141� east of Greenwich. This claim is
often looked upon in England as a kind of usurpation, but persons
so viewing it are not probably aware, that along nearly the whole
of the coasts included within the northern and southern extremities
of this line, an extensive trade is carried on exclusively in vessels
sailing from various ports of the Moluccas and carrying the Dutch
flag. Considerable portions also of this extensive line of coast
have been, or are being, surveyed by the Dutch Government; and
instead of cavilling at their claiming so much, it seems more rea-
sonable to admire their moderation in not claiming the whole of a
country with which they are so intimately connected. Should the
Royal Geographical Society?s collection not yet contain them, I
may take this opportunity of calling attention to a very beautiful
series of maps of the Dutch possessions in the East, by Baron
Melvill van Carnbe'e.
On the small island of Mansinaru, opposite Dorey, have been
residing for about three years two German missionaries. I fear,
however, that in the Doreyans they have very impracticable ma-
terials to work on, and I am afraid they neither have made nor


will make much impression. From the little I have seen of the
Dutch missionary system in these countries, I am bound to declare
my opinion that it is altogether wrong in principle. I allude to
the custom of the missionaries being also traders. In the island
of Lombock, during my stay there, two gentlemen were employed
in winding up the affairs of one of these trading missionaries, who
had failed to the amount of some 20,000 dollars. He was de-
spised for his ignorance and incapacity in business by the acute
Chinese and native traders, and was therefore in a decidedly false
position when attempting to teach them. It seems to me that a
man in trade (especially in these countries) attempting to teach
Christianity is in a terrible dilemma. To make his trade profit-
able, he must drive hard bargains, he must take little advantages
even of the necessities of bis customers and disciples, and thereby
stultifies his own teaching of unselfishness and charity. If he does
not do this, he cannot live. The best and most effective mis-
sionary system I have seen is certainly that of the French Jesuits
in the Straits, in Siam and in China, because by living in poverty,
and establishing an almost entire community of property between
the teacher and his disciples, they prove convincingly that their
sole object is the benefit of their flock. Whatever the doctrines
taught may be, the method of teaching is certainly admirable.
When in Amboyna, in January last, I heard that an explor-
ing expedition was decided on to fix upon some place on the
coast of New Guinea for a settlement. A war steamer and a
sailing vessel, carrying troops and stores, left that port in March,
and commenced their exploration on the south-west coast, near
the Utanata river, from which place to the island of Lakahia they
made a detailed survey. They then came round to Dorey, where
they arrived on the sth of May. A few days before a coal-ship
from Banjarmassin, in Borneo, had left for Amboyna, having stayed
in Dorey harbour two months, waiting for the steamer?s arrival.
The captain told us his agreement was to return on a fixed day,
which was some days past when he left. The steamer was nearly
out of coal, and could neither go on nor go back. It lay a month
in Dorey, and the soldiers, firemen, &c., were kept hard at work
cutting down and sawing up huge trees for fire-wood. This was
all done and all got on board, and the steamer was to leave for
Amboyna the next day, when back came the coal-ship. Now out
went the wood again, and the coal being taken in, the steamer
went off to Humboldt Bay, where they stayed a few days, opening
a communication with the natives, who are quite unsophisticated,
but superior morally and physically to the Doreyans. The plan
of the original expedition was to explore the whole coast on their
return, but they were short of provisions, and went straight back
to Amboyna. The results of this voyage were not very great, and
