NOTE.
This rough lisi of ExhibitB has been most hurridly compilcd and
printed during thè last three days, chiefly frani thè lista and notes sup-
plied by thè exhibitors themselves.
It has no pretensions io any bibliographical vaine, bui it is hoped
that it will prove of Service to our guests and visitors as a finding-list.
It has been found necessary to employ five different persona to ma he
parts of thè lisi, hence thè want of uniformity.
Its existence , be its merits what they rnay, is entirely due to thè
industry and zeal of my valued assistants, Messrs. G. H. Gì fard and Hugh
Wright, ably seconded by thè skill and enterprise of our prinfers —
Messrs. Hennessey, Campbell 8f Co.—who bave worked day and night
to help us.
We regret that it has been impossible to prepare alphabetical lists of
authors and thè more famous printers rcpresented.
