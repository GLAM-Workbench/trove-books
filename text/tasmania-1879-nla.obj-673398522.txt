JAMES BARNARD,
GOVERNMENT PRINTER, TASMANIA.
Gold mining is being successfully prosecuted. The value of gold
obtained in 1878 was officially returned at £100,000; but the quantity
really procured is known to have been much more. The average yields
of some of the crushings of the Tasmanian Mine at Beaconsfield, in 1878,
were over 4 ozs. of gold to the ton of quartz.
A Company is now mining for copper at Badger Head, near Port
Sorell, with good prospects. At Mount Ramsay, about 10 miles from
the now celebrated tin mines of Mount BischofF, is a lode of bismuth, said
to be in one part three chains wide, of which Mr. Ulrich, the well-known
geologist of Victoria, says that it is one of the richest deposits, if not the
very richest, of this rare metal discovered in recent times.
