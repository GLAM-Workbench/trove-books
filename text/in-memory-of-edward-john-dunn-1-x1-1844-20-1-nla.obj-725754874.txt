EDWARD JOHN DUNN
GEOLOGIST
1844 Edward John Dunn was born at Bristol, Somerset, England, on
November the first.
1849 Arrived in Australia and at first lived near Goulbourne where he
began collecting pebbles (some in the collection were donated to the British
Museum).
1856 —joined his parents at Beechworth, Victoria. At this time the famous
Woolshed diggings were at their zenith. On his way he saw a herd of seal in the
Murrumbidgee river at Gundagai. Seals may be the solution of the bunyip myth.
At Beechworth he was educated at a preparatory school and Church of England
school; later was coached in Latin, Greek and Euclid by Henry Phelan of Dublin
University; then was tutored by a Hungarian nobleman, Mr. Rochlitz, a refugee.
Most of his holidays were spent in collecting rocks and minerals for which this
district was famous. This collection was later donated to the Geological Museum,
Melbourne.
1860 About 1860 Mr. Dunn entered the Land Survey Office, Beechworth,
and learnt office work and practical surveying under Mr. John Darbyshire. After
two years in this office he engaged in field work. About this time he discovered
remarkable stones containing fluid (enhydros) and sent specimens to the British
Museum and the Geological Survey, Melbourne. He believes no other stones of
this type containing water have been discovered elsewhere.
1864 He entered the Geological Survey under Selwyn, and joined Mr. Ulrich’s
camp at Tarrengower; he remained in the survey till it was abolished in 1869.
Under Mr. Ulrich’s splendid training he was now able to take geological work.
1869 Passed his examinations as mining surveyor.
1870 Made a geological sketch map of the Parish of Beechworth.
1871 —Furnished with letters from Viscount Canterbury (Governor of Victoria)
to the Governor and others in Cape Colony, he arrived there in 1871, and on


arrival was met by a representative of the Cape Government and asked to undertake
at once reporting on copper mines. He accepted on the condition that before beginning
the work he should be allowed to study thoroughly the Diamond fields. This was
agreed to, and he left at once for the Kimberley mines which had just been
discovered. He saw, and held in his hands, the first diamonds taken from these
mines. On the way to the Diamond Fields he examined the conglomerate at Dwyka
river and discovered a glacial conglomerate near Hope Town.
His paper „Notes on The Diamond Fields 44 , showing plans and sections of
Du Toit’s Pan and Blufontein Igneous Pipes, and the terraces along the Vaal River
was published the same year.
On December 1871 he spent a day at Alexander Bay at the mouth of the
Orange river, but fortunately saw no diamonds. Recently, at this spot diamonds
were discovered in such great quantities as to have proved a calamity not only to
S. Africa but to the whole world.
Two years were spent travelling through Cape Colony. Travelling in these
early times was wrought with much danger from the blacks and the real Bushman
races and from wild animals. On one occasion he narrowly escaped being killed
by a wild Bushman.
1873
Jermyn St., London, where he got his certificate for assaying and visited numbers
of mines in Great Britain.
He met all the great scientists of the day and was bombarded with questions,
as all were anxious for news about the Diamond Fields.
1874 He was invited to read a paper before the Geological Society of London
describing the volcanic nature of the diamond pipes.
He returned to the Cape and spent ten months travelling through Natal, the
Transvaal and the Free States.
1875 Returned to London where his geological sketch map of S. Africa was
published at his own expense. On this map was shown, under the name of Lydenburg
Beds, the group of gold-bearing rocks that include both the East Transvaal Goldfields
(Pilgrim’s Rest, etc.), and the great Rand Goldfield that was opened up in 1886,
and which has already yielded hundreds of millions worth of gold.
(Later in the Cape Argus, May the first, 1883, appeared this paragraph: „Mr.
Dunn assures us that no one has yet realized the sober truth that the Transvaal is
an infinitely richer gold-bearing country than any which has yet been discovered.
Within a couple of years he is assured that, whatever losses there may be by reason
of rash speculations and there will doubtless be many the actual output of
solid gold will be enormous. 44 )
South Africa was able to pay off her debt with her output of gold.
Before returning to The Cape, Mr. Dunn married Elizabeth Julie Perchard of


Jersey. The diamonds in her engagement ring were found by him in Kimberley,
and her wedding ring was made from gold he washed out at The Rand.
1876 During 1876 —1877 he made a sketch survey map of the Stormberg coal
area. This map shows the area in Cape Colony occupied by the upper or Molteno
Coal Measures. He also reported on and helped to develop the Cypher-Gat coal
mine at the same place.
1880 Aug. 2nd. He was the first to use a drilling machine in S. Africa. An
Ingersoll machine was used for drilling coal at Camdeboo near Aberdeen. Carbonate
was imported from S. America with the machine for boring purposes, but the expense
was so great that he discontinued using it. He obtained leave to visit Kimberley
in order to procure local material (boart), which proved a complete success, and
reduced the cost of boring by the cost of carbonate. For this he received a letter
of thanks from the Government. He was the first to suggest the use of S. African
boart for drilling. This led to its becoming a valuable product for export.
1880
Town on the stone implements of S. Africa.
1883 He discovered a beautiful mineral in Serpentine in E. Transvaal, and
forwarded specimens of it to the British Museum. It was not at the time recognised
as a new mineral. Many years later, however, it was rediscovered in Tasmania, and
named Stichtite. The British Museum authorities acknowledged their oversight.
In this year a visit was made to Australia and the conglomerate at Wooragee
near Beechworth was found by him to be distinctly glaciated; it corresponded with
the Dwyka conglomerate of S. Africa. The same year he returned to S. Africa, and
after completing a journey from Grahamstown to Petermaritzburg, Natal, he was able
to announce the existence of Lower Coal Measures (Permo-Carboniferous), much
older than the Molteno Measures ( Rhaetic); the Southern portion was delineated
on a map published by him at Cape Town in 1886 and named Dwyka Coal Measures.
In this year he also found glaciated pebbles at Prince Albert, Cape Colony.
Shortly after this he paid a visit to Griquatown and found, amongst the
excavated material at the chief spring there, the first large find of complete
pear-shaped implements.
During the fifteen years in S. Africa he travelled the whole country from the
Limpopo River to Cape Town, and from east to west. Geological data was always
obtained when possible.
While going through the fossil section with the curator at the Bloomfontein
Museum, he noticed a variation in one of the specimens which greatly interested
him. At his suggestion this fossil saurian was sent to England for investigation to
Sir Richard Owen. This was later named Platypodosaurus Robustus by Sir Richard
Owen.


1884 —He was elected Fellow of the Geological Society, London. In that year
he discovered in the East Transvaal a wonderful plant named after him Streptocarpus
Dunnii by Sir Joseph Hooker.
1886 —He returned to Victoria and entered private practice as Consulting
Geologist chiefly for English and European firms; he also undertook professional
work for the State Mines Department. He discovered and mapped for the department
an area of rock older than Ordovician at Heathcote the first Cambrian found in
Victoria.
1887 A second edition of the Geological map of S. Africa was published in
Melbourne.
1888 The coal at Korumburra was favourably reported on by him and that
coal field was opened up.
1889 Visited the Northern territory and made a trip round Australia.
1889 Examined Mt. Morgan when the rich surface ores were being worked
and 1,000 oz. of gold were being won per day.
1890 Surveys of Bendigo were made.
1891 A report was made on Wild Duck Creek (Derrinal) glacial beds.
1892 The wonderful glacial developments of the North West coast of
Tasmania were discovered by him; a paper on this was published by the Royal
Society of Melbourne.
1893 Published through the Mine’s Department a report on the Bendigo
Goldfield, which is an accurate survey of that field. He was the first geologist to
discover the means of continuing the lines of anticline; for the first time sections
were shown in this report that saddle reefs were formed on the anticlinal axes, and
that they were conformable to the strata.
1893 The first Bendigo report was published, and the second in 1896.
He was largely connected in advising the Broken Hill Prop, in the early years
of the company. He saved the Sulphide Corporation from losing lode. In two
years working the lode would have been outside their ground. On his advice the
adjoining land was acquired, and the situation was saved.


1297 —An interesting discovery at Ashford was made by him in the North
of N. S. Wales of glacial conglomerate underlying a thick coal seam. This was
of the same age as the Dwyka Conglomerate of S. Africa and was identified as such.
1899 —On his way back from Europe in 1899 he revisited S. Africa and at
Vereening examined the coal mines, and identified the conglomerate underlying
the coal as Dwyka Conglomerate, and the seams as belonging to the lower coal
measures. The whole extent of the coal measures in S. Africa was delineated on a
map published in Cape Town in 1900.
Hundreds of mines of various types, including many of the most important
in the States of the Commonwealth, New Zealand, and New Caledonia were
visited by him.
1904 —He was appointed Director of the Geological Survey of Victoria.
1905 The Geological Society of London awarded him the Murchison medal
for the work done in S. Africa and Australia.
While director he discovered the Powlett Coal Field. The site of every hole
drilled on the Powlett Field was determined by him as director up to 1912. One
of the first holes bored struck a seam of coal 9 ft. thick. The reorganization of
the survey began under Professor Gregory, was continued, and an effort was made
to bring it nearer to Selwyn’s standard. The old electricity buildings and stacks
were utilized and converted into a laboratory, and the staff removed there from
Richmond. Portion of the building was altered into a library, and the scattered
literature was gathered together there. After long continued effort a new building,
which had been wanted for sixty years, was erected as a geological museum. It
was furnished gradually with show and store cases, and the valuable collection
of rocks, minerals and fossils, previously stored in vaults, was displayed to the
*
public.
During this period he brought the marvellous views and wonderful rock scenery
of Mt. Buffalo and the mysteries of the Buchan caves prominently before the
public, and these places were made available to tourists. On Mr. Dunn’s advice
Buchan marble was used in the building of the Melbourne Public Library instead
of N. S. Wales marble.
A large area was reserved around the mineral springs at Daylesford and
elsewhere to protect them from damage and to ensure the attraction of the surrounding
beautiful forest.
Much valuable work was produced by the staff in the same period.
1911 —His book „Pebbles“ was published. His collection from which the
illustrations were drawn is now in the British Museum.


1912 Having reached the age limit, he retired.
1913 Mr. Dunn revisited the Northern Territory to report privately. While
at the Victoria River he discovered one of the most interesting of 400 species of
acasias indigenous to Australia, named Acacia Dunni by Sir E. Hill of Kew Garden,
England.
1914—1915 He wrote a book on gold occurrences, for which hundreds of
photographs, maps, plans and sections were prepared. This book „Geology of
Gold“ which is the outcome of his professional experiences was brought out in
1929 at his own cost with the object of recording his many unique experiences,
and that the knowledge gained should not be lost, but help others in the search
for gold.
1924 The Geological Survey of S. Africa published a map of that region
which amply confirmed Mr. Dunn’s map published in 1887.
1928 —He visited Cohuna and wrote a report on the condition under which
the remarkable Cohuna skull was found. This skull proves that Australia was
inhabited at a remote period by a race akin to that once inhabiting Java according
to Sir A. Keith, and which preceded the present Australian race.
During his visits to various countries, valuable ethnological and other collections
were made by Mr. Dunn.
1931 „The Bushman“, a book dealing with the pigmy race of S. Africa
was published.
1932 In December of this year he brought under the notice of the Melbourne
public the grave neglect of a probable great asset in the Riverina Coal Field.
From 1860 to the present time Mr. Dunn continually sent specimens of interest
to the British Museum.
His ethnological collection of Bushman objects was given to the Pitt Rivers
Museum, Oxford.
Collection of Australites to the British Museum.
Cellection of 800 pebbles to the British Museum.
Collection of Victorian N. E. stones to the Mines Dept. Museum, Victoria.
Also smaller collections, and specimens to museums, universities in Australia,
Africa and Europe.
