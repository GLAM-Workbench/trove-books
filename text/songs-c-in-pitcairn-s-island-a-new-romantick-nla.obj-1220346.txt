Song. —PIPES.
And Chorus of Sailors and Marines,
When British thunder shakes the main,
And Neptune starts to hear it roar ;
Her flag with honor we'll maintain,
While truth shall tell from shor& to shore*
That where Old Albion's flag: may fly,
Is still the land of Liberty.

Another Part of the Island.
Air, —OTAHEINA.
Oh sister dear!
How shall we steer
Our course amid these dangers?
How could you go
To lead me so
Among these handsome strangers ?
I cannot stay unless we run
Most surely we are all undone !
Air. —OBEREA. .
Beneath that Palm whose lengthen'd shade,
At even stretches through the glade,
While silver streams majestic glide
A down yon mountain's sloping side,
With wishful eye cast o'er the main
My father sings this mournful strain:
Dear native land ! Alas! for me,
Doom'd ne'er again thy cliffs to see.
■ Dear native land, &c. -
Yet should some friendly hand once more
Conduct him to the wish'd for shore,
What sweet reward would he receive,
Who bade the Mourner cease to grieve ?
With joyful looks across the main
My father then might sing this strain:
Dear native land ! what bliss for me,
Once more thy milk white cliffs to see !
Dear native land! &c.


SCENE 111

Song. —PIPES.
Westminster is full of wigs.
Lawyer's heads, and briefs and bag® ;
Lords and commons, carts and gigs,
Silks and satins, rogues and rags ;
Covent Garden, Drury Lane,
And Pidcock's show, are very grand \
Piazzas keep you from the rain,

Tollol, 4c,
Temple Bar is very neat,
Fleet street's lit with gas at night,
Blackfriars is from Dorset street
The second turning on the right;
Ludgate hill you hardly can
Pass for crowds, and shops such store—
St. Paul's is just behind Queen Anne—
You never saw the like before !

Shall in out hearts and memories live.

Around all Europe's Ports I've been,
And Afric's sandy shore, -

Yet ne'er have I my lot deplor'd*
When roaming near or far;
For every land can still afford,
His pleasures to the Tar. *
He still a jovial bowl can find,
A friend that's true, —a Girl that's kind;
And sing, Yeo, Yeo, fol de rol, &c.
When grbg that cheers the Seaman's soul^
Runs short in distant parts;
Outlandish wines can fill the bowl,
And warm our merry hearts,
Tho' British damsels far surpass,
All else beneath the sun;
When far from them a foreign lass,
Is sweeter much than none.
Thus still a jovial bowl we find,
A friend that's true,—a Girl that's kinA
And sing, Yeo, Yeo, fol de rol, &c#
