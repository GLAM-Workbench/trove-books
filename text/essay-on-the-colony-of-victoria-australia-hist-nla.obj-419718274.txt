ESSAY ON THE COLONY OF VICTORIA
(AUSTRALIA).
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY, POPULATION AND HISTORY.
1. The colony of Victoria, the smallest but the richest and the most thickly
populated of all the various divisions of Australia, although not settled half so
long as New South Wales, is situated in the south-east of the continent,
between the 84th and the 39th degrees of south latitude and the 141st and
150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is
about 420 geographical miles, its greatest breadth from north to south is about
250, and its extent of coast line nearly 600. The area of Victoria is 87,884
square miles, or 50,245,760 acres. The whole continent of Australia is
estimated to contain 2,944,028 square miles, so that Victoria occupies about
one thirty-fourth of its surface. Great Britain contains 89,044 square miles,
and is, therefore, slightly larger than Victoria, while the Netherlands, with
20,527 square miles, is not quite one-fourth so large. While Victoria is the
smallest, its attractiveness, from various causes, has been so great that it is
the most populous colony in Australia, and contains about 39 per cent, of the
whole inhabitants of the continent. The census taken on the 3rd April, 1881,
showed that the population at that date consisted of 452,083 males, and
410,263 females, or a total of 862,346. It was estimated that on December
31st, 1882, the population would be 472,684 males, and 427,613 females, or a
total of 900,297.
2. Australia is said to have been first discovered by Guilliaume le Testu,
a Provencal pilot, in 1542, but the first well authenticated visit of any
European ship was that of a Dutch vessel, the Duyfhen, which, sailing from
Java on November 18th, 1605, landed at a place which its captain called Cape
Keer Weer, near the present Cape York, where several of the crew were
killed by the natives. Several Dutch expeditions followed. Dirk Hartog,
of the Dutch ship Endraught, discovered Endraught’s Land, on the west coast
of Australia, between 35° and 22° south latitude, in 1616. Zeachen, another
Dutch captain, discovered a large portion of the western coast of Australia in
1618, and gave it the name of Arnheim’s Land. Captain Jan de Edel dis-
covered a portion of the west coast, between 30° 20' S. and 26° 30' S., in 1619.
The south-west cape —Cape Leu win—was discovered in 1622, and named
after the ship in which the discoverers sailed. In 1627 a portion of the
south coast was discovered by Captain Pieter Nuyts. In 1628 De Witt’s
Land, in 15° S., was discovered, and named after the commander of the
Dutch East India squadron. The same year a Dutch squadron of ten ships,
convoyed by a man-of-war, despatched to explore the Australian coast, was
lost in Hontman’s Abrolhos islands, about 30 miles from the main land—the
man-of-war being the only ship that was left to tell the tale. Hitherto the dis-
coveries had been of the most sterile and inhospitable portion of the continent,
which was then universally known by the name of New Holland. But in
1642, Abel Jan Tasman was despatched by Anthony Van Dieraan, the
Governor of the Netherlands Indies, to prosecute geographical surveys on the
coast of New Holland. In his two voyages he discovered Tasmania and New
Zealand, and surveyed a large portion of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the coast
of what is now known as Northern Queensland. The honour of discovering


the south-eastern portions of Australia, in which are situated the populous
and important colonies of Victoria, New South V ales, and South Australia, is
due to Captain Cook, the eminent British navigator. He made the land near
Cape Everard in Gippsland, lat. 38° S., and long. 148-53 E., on April 19th,
1770, and then steered north-east, coasting along a large portion of New South
Wales and Queensland.
3. The colonization of New South Wales in 1788 was the result of the
news which Captain Cook took to England of the resources of south-eastern
Australia. Ten years later George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, sailed
in a whale boat through what are now known as Bass’s Straits, and landed at
Western Port. Four years after the discovery by Bass, in 1802, Port Phillip,
on the shores of which the City of Melbourne is now built, was entered by
Lieutenant Jolm Murray in the armed brig Lady JSelson. An abortive attempt
to colonize Port Phillip was made during 1803 by Lieutenant-Colonel David
Collins of the Royal Marines. It was not until 1824 that two explorers from
New South Wales —Messrs. Hovell and Hume—made their way overland from
Sydney, and on their return gave a glowing account of the country around what
is now Melbourne and Geelong. In 1834 the Henty family crossed Bass's
Straits from Tasmania, and established a settlement at Portland Bay, 200 miles
west of Port Phillip, from which they gradually pushed on to the rich agri-
cultural and pastoral lands of the Waunou, the Wando, and the
1835 the neighbourhood of Melbourne was colonized by two parties from Tas-
mania—one led by John Batman, who landed on May 29th, and the other by
John Paseoe Fawkner, who arrived on August 28th. The district of Port
Phillip was visited during the same year by Major, afterwards Sir Thomas,
Mitchell, the Surveyor-General of New South Wales, who traversed the
northern and western portions of what is now known as Victoria. He was
much struck by the richness of the country, and on his return to Sydney gave
it the name of Australia Felix. The result of Sir Thomas Mitchell’s report
was that a great impetus was given to the settlement of Port Phillip. Regular
government Avas first established on September 29th, 1836, the first Govern-
ment Resident being Captain William Lonsdale. On September 30th, 1839,
Mr. C. J. La Trobe was appointed Superintendent of the district. From that
time its progress was rapid. The population, which in 1839 was only 5,822,
had increased in 1844 to 26,734, and in 1849 to 66,220. In 1851 the district
was separated from New South Wales, and constituted a colony under the
name of Victoria. The discovery of gold following shortly afterwards, a large
immigration set in, first from the neighbouring colonies, and then from Europe,
and in 1854 the population was 812,307. A new constitution, conceding
self-government to the people of Victoria, was proclaimed on November 23rd,
Since that date the progress of the colony has been steady and rapid;
and it may be safely said that the amount of material prosperity enjoyed by
all classes of its inhabitants is not exceeded, if indeed it is equalled, by that
possessed by the people of any other country in the world, since its revenue,
its imports, its exports, have more than kept pace with the large increase in
its population.
4. Victoria is bounded on the north and east by New South Wales, on the
west by South Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, Bass’s
Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.
5. Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire
length from east to west by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely
dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit
of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast.
The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to
the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides
the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian
Alps ; and that part which separates the county of Ripon from that of Boning,


and extends into the county of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The
higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered Avith snow for several months
in the year. The mountainous country is for the most part densely wooded
to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter suoav
line are quite bare, or only partially covered Avith dwarfed trees or shrubs.
From the longitude of Melbourne to the westward the Dividing Range rapidly
dwindles, so that, although presenting in places points of considerable height
—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From
Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches aAvay to the Western district, a
chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude. That portion of the
Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending
in the form of a regular triangle to a Avidth of 200 miles along the Avestern
boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination
towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing
Range and its spurs is moderately undulating ; it is in some parts destitute of
timber, but closely wooded in others,
G. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending
in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain.
The highest peaks are finmd in the eastern portion of the Dividing Range
and its offshoots. The chiefs of these are : —The Bogong Range, 6,508 feet;
Mount Feathertop, 6,303 feet; Mount Hotham, 6,100 feet; Cobberas, 6,025
feet;. Mount Cope, 6,015 feet; Mount Bulla, 5,911 feet; Gibbo Range, 5,764
feet; Mount Wills, 5,758 feet; Mount HoAvitt, 5,715 feet; Mount Buffalo,
5,645 feet; The Twins, 5,575 feet; Mount Tamboritha, 5,381 feet; Mount
Wellington, 5,363 feet; Mount Cobbler, 5,342 feet; and Mount Kent, 5,129
feet. So far as is at present known by observation, there are at least 15 peaks
over 5,000 feet high, and 15 between 4,000 and 5,000 feet. There are, how-
ever,- many peaks above 4,000 feet whose actual heights have not yet been
determined.
7. The rivers in Victoria are for the most part inconsiderable. Many of
them are liable to be partially dried up during the summer months, so as to
be reduced at that season to mere chains of pools or waterholes. With the
exception of the Yarra, on the banks of Avhich the metropolis is situated;
the Golburn, which empties itself into the Murray about eight miles to the
eastward of Echuca; the Murray itself, and some of the Gippsland
streams, not one of them is navigable except by boats. As, however, they
drain the watershed of large areas of country, some have already been, and
others Avill ultimately be, made feeders to permanent reservoirs for the purposes
of irrigation, gold-washing, and manufactures. The Murray, which forms the
northern boundary of the colony, is the largest river in Australia. Its total
length is 1,300 miles, for 980 of which it flows along the Victorian border.
The names and lengths of the other principal Victorian rivers are as follow:
The Goulburu, 345 miles; the Glenelg, 281 miles; the Loddon, 224 miles;
the Wiramera, 228 miles; the Avoca, 163 miles; the Hopkins, 153 miles;
the Wannon, 151 miles; the Ovens, 141 miles; the La Trobe, 135 miles; the
Mitta Mitta, 176 miles; the Yarra Yarra, 151 miles.
8. Victoria contains numerous salt and fresh Avater lakes and lagoons, but
many of these are nothing more than SAvamps during dry seasons. Some of
them are craters of extinct volcanoes. Lake Corangamite, the largest inland
lake in Victoria, covers 76 square miles, and is quite salt, notwithstanding
its augmentation by numerous fresh-water streams. It has no visible outlet.
Lake Colac, only a feAV miles distant from Lake Corangamite, is a beautiful
sheet of Avater, 10 square miles in extent, and quite fresh. Lake Burrumbeet
is also a fine sheet of fresh Avater, embracingß| square miles. The Gippsland
lakes —Victoria, King, and Reeve—are situated close to the coast, and are
only separated from the sea by a narrow belt of sand. Through this there is
an entrance which is often uaAdgable, but is subject to be closed at irregular


intervals in consequence of the shifty nature of the sand at its mouth. Works
have been commenced with the view of making the entrance permanent.
Lake Wellington the largest of all the Gippsland lakes, lies to the westward
of Lakes Victoria and Reeve, and is united with the first-named by a narrow
channel. South-east of Geelong is Lake Connewarre, connected with the sea
at Point Flinders.
CLIMATE.
9. From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate more suitable
to the European constitution than any other colony upon the continent of
Australia, since within a comparatively limited area it possesses the climatic
advantages of the more favoured portions of Southern Europe. Upon
examining a chart showing isothermal lines, it will be found that Melbourne
is situated upon or near the line corresponding with that in the northern
hemisphere on which Marseilles, Bordeaux, Bologna, Nice, Verona, and
Madrid are situated. The difference, however, between summer and winter,
and the hottest and coldest month, is far less in Melbourne that in any of
these places. In the ten years ended with 1879, the maximum temperature
in the shade was 111°, which occurred once only; the minimum was 27 w ,
which also occurred only once; and the mean was 57°. Upon the aA r erage, on
four days during the year the thermometer rises above 100° in the shade;
and generally on about three nights during the year it falls below' freezing
point. The mean atmospheric pressure, noted at an observatory 91 feet above
the sea-level, was in the same ten years 29'93 inches; the average number of
Avot days Avas 132, and the a Average yearly rainfall Avas 28 inches, as compared
Avith 29'95 inches at Sydney, and 2L3G niches at Adelaide. In some districts
of Victoria, notably amongst the mountains, the rainfall is more than in
Melbourne, Avhile on the plains tOAvards the north-Avestern portions of the
colony it is somewdiat less. But in this respect Melbourne may be taken as
fairly representative. The hot Avinds, which are the terror of new-anWals,
are neither so frequent nor so severe as is generally supposed. The average
number of hot-wind days in the year does not exceed 8, and of these the days
of intense heat do not exceed 2or 3. Generally the hot Avinds last only one
day, and the maximum is three, the change from the hot north to the cool
and refreshing south Avind being usually accompanied by a thunder storm,
which completely alters the oppressive atmosphere and converts it into one of
delightful coolness and freshness. These hot winds, although severe upon
old people and children, are not unhealthy. On the contrary, they destroy
the germs of disease; they act as poAverful disinfectants, and prevent any
ill effect which might result from heat accompanied by dampness.
10. The rain does not all fall at one season, but is distributed throughout
the year. In Melbourne the mean rainfall is 40 days during spring, 24 during
summer, 29 during autumn, and 42 during Avinter. At Sandhurst, Avhich may
be considered typical of that portion of the colony Avhich lies north of the
Dividing Range, the number of days during Avhich rain falls is IG4 days per
annum, and at Portland, on the sea-coast, 108 days. The seasons in Victoria,
as in the other portions of the southern hemisphere, are the exact opposite of
those in Europe. The spring commences on the 23rd September, and brings
with it pleasant and moderately warm Aveather, with a considerable number of
Avet or showery days. Summer commences on the 22nd December, the longest
day in the year. January is the hottest month of the year, although the hot
winds are not usually severe before February. Autumn commences on the
20th March; the Aveather is cool and agreeable; the intense heat is no longer
felt, and the fresh breezes from the north and north-west create a mild and
agreeable temperature. Winter commences upon the 21st June, the shortest
day in the year; the temperature is comparatively mild, the thermometer
rarely falling beloAv 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Frosts are rare near the sea,


although more frequent in the interior, and especially amongst the mountains.
In the more level country the ice which forms during the night never lasts for
more than three or four hours after daylight, and although snow occasionally
falls amongst the hills, and remains for some time upon the mountain tops, a
fall which occurred at Melbourne during July 1882 created great excitement
amongst the people, many of whom had never seen such a sight before.
LAND LAWS, PEODUCTS OF THE SOIL, ETC.
11. The first settlement of Victoria was made by graziers, who depastured
their live stock, horses, sheep, and cattle upon the unoccupied Crown lauds
of the colony, paying for their occupancy a small rental to the Government.
As the population increased, and especially after the discovery of gold, the
system of selling land by auction, which had always been followed in the
towns and in a few rural localities, was extended to all the country districts.
Subsequently greater facilities for the acquisition of land were given to persons
of small means, who were allowed to take up, for farming and grazing purposes,
any land which had not been previously alienated, in blocks not exceeding
CIO acres in extent, and to pay for it at the rate of twenty shillings per
acre by payments extending over a series of years. The laws relative to the
occupation of land have been modified from time to time, but, at the present
moment, the mode of obtaining a farm is as follows : —The intending farmer,
or, as he is generally termed in Australia, the selector, chooses any piece of
unsold or nnleased land which he may desire, sets up a post three feet high at
each corner of the block, places upon each of them an announcement of
his intention to apply for the land at the nearest land-office, and deposits
with the district surveyor the survey fees. The land is subsequently
surveyed, and all persons interested are informed that upon a certain
date a license to occupy the land will be granted, unless good reasons,
such as its being auriferous, its being claimed by some other person,
or the mala Jides of the selector, can be shown to the contrary. The
application of the intending fanner is then investigated by the Local Land
Board, and subsequently approved of by the Board of Land and Works.
Thus, by an easy method, every resident in Victoria, British-born or foreigner,
can, by paying one shilling per acre per annum for twenty years, and con-
forming to certain conditions as to residence, fencing, and cultivating,
become the possessor of a farm of any extent up to 320 acres. Should
any person desire to obtain a farm in fee-simple by purchase from the
present holders, it may be obtained at prices from £3 to £2O per acre,
according to the value of the improvements which have been made, the
nature of the soil, the distance from a raihvay station, &c. It is possible
that the present land Jaws may be somewhat modified, but any change
will certainly be in the direction of granting greater facilities to intending
farmers.
12. The total area of the colony of Victoria is 50,215,760 acres. Of
these, 19,819,739 acres have been sold, or leased with right of purchase,
and 36,420,021 acres remain in the hands of the Crown, and of these it is
calculated that about 9,410,932 acres are suitable for agriculture.
13. In order to give greater facilities for farmers and graziers to convey
their produce to market and to the ports of shipment, a large and compre-
hensive system of railways has been undertaken by the Government. One
thousand two hundred and forty-seven miles were, on 9th August, 1881, open
for traffic, 159 miles were in course of construction, 291 additional miles were
authorized under existing laws, and a proposal was before Parliament to
construct several hundred miles of new railways at the time this Handbook
was being written.


11. The ordinary crops in Victoria are those of Northern and Central
Europe, viz., wheat, oats, barley, hay, and potatoes; but, in addition to these,
the soil produces all the fruits, vegetables, and grasses of Southern Europe.
Maize is grown in some localities, tobacco in others, the grape ripens all over
the colony, and many excellent varieties of wine are made ; the mulberry
and the olive thrive well north of the Dividing Range. Owing to the great
diversities of soil and elevation, and consequently of climate, Victoria can
grow in one locality or the other every description of agricultural produce
which is to be found in Great Britain, France, or Italy.
15. The extent of land under the principal crops, the gradual increase of
agriculture, and the yields are set forth in the following table: —

i which they were
from which they
portions of the United Kingdom


came; to the improvement of their live stock—horses, cattle, sheep and pigs,,
in which they can more than hold their own with the graziers of any country
in Europe; and to the production of dairy produce—butter, cheese, bacon and
hams, in which they are unsurpassed. Of late years a not inconsiderable
area of land has been laid down in vines. At the present moment there are
between 5,000 and 6,000 acres of vineyard in the colony, and about 800,000
gallons of wine are made annually. The quality of the wine is excellent, and
it has received the highest encomiums from the best judges in Europe. At
the Exhibitions at Vienna, Philadelphia, and Paris the wines of Victoria
obtained a large number of prizes, and at the last-mentioned exhibition the
proportion was greater than was awarded to any country exhibiting.
Recently, the Hon. L. L. Smith, the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers
taking charge of the Victorian Court at the Amsterdam Exhibition, has intro-
duced the manufacture of champagne, and has achieved a large measure of
success. The northern portions of Victoria are well adapted for the growth
of the olive, the fig, and the mulberry, but the manufacture of olive oil and
sericiculture can scarcely be said to have gone beyond the experimental stage.
Oranges and lemons grow all over the colony, side by side with the fruits of
Northern Europe,—the apple, the pear, the cherry, the plum, the strawberry,
and the raspberry ; and those of Central Europe —the peach, the apricot, the
fig, and the mulberry. Tobacco is very largely grown, and at the present
moment the annual production is about 1,500,000 lbs. The growth of hops
is so large that Victoria promises to be before very long independent of any
foreign supply.
19. Two other industries for which Victoria is well adapted, although very
little attention has been directed to them of late years, are the cultivation of
flax and of beet. Flax culture appears to have disappeared for the last few
years, owing to the absence of proper scutching machines. Very few residents
possess much practical knowledge of the cultivation of flax. In 1868 there were
31 acres, and in 1869, 34 acres under this crop in the neighbourhood of Melbourne
and Geelong. The yield was in the first year 120,000 lbs. of fibre, and in the
second 31,000 lbs. of fibre and 150 bushels of linseed. From that date the
area under flax has steadily declined, and last year it did not exceed 3 acres.
And yet the importance of this crop is considerable, inasmuch as about
100,000 gallons of linseed oil are annually imported, and there is a great
demand both for flax and hemp for the manufacture of string, twine, and
rope.
20. The culture of the beet-root has not passed much beyond the experi-
mental stage, although it has been demonstrated that the soil of the colony is
well suited to that description of crop. Some years ago a distillery was
established for the manufacture of beet-root spirit, andmore recently a company
was projected for the production of beet-root sugar. Spirits and sugar of
good quality have been made, and fair prices realized ; but the difficulties in
the way of establishing a new industry in a country where labour is so high
as in Victoria have hitherto prevented the development of the beet-root
industry.
21. Victoria produces a large number of excellent forest trees. The wood
is uniformly hard and durable, and well adapted for building. The most
important kinds are the various varieties of the eucalyptus —the red and
blue gum, the stringy bark, the iron bark, the messmate, and the white
gum—the blackwood andlightwood, which are well adapted for cabinet work,
and the myall, which has a sweet scent, and is largely used for fancy articles.
The Murray pine is the only description of soft wood indigenous to the
colony. The wattle produces gum, and its bark is largely employed for
tanning. From all the gum-trees, or, to give them their scientific name,
the various branches of the eucalyptus family, a valuable medicinal oil is
distilled ; and from a small-sized variety, which grows exclusively in the


north-west of Victoria, is produced an oil largely used in the manufacture of
varnish. The tree-fern is extremely beautiful, but it does not appear to have
any economic uses. In addition to the indigenous trees of Victoria, all of
which are evergreens, a large number of useful and ornamental trees and
shrubs, deciduous and otherwise, have been introduced. Several varieties of
pines—the oak, the elm, and the plane-tree—thrive well.
22. The more important industries of Victoria are those which have to do
with breeding and fattening of live stock. Owing to the exceptional mildness
of the climate and the general fertility of the soil, sheep, cattle, and horses can
live without either artificial food or shelter, except for the horses working in
towns or on farms. The number of live stock in the colony during 1881 was
as under : —Horses, 275,516 ; milch cows, 329,198 ; other large cattle,
957,069; 10,860,285 sheep, and 241,936 pigs. There were in addition about
3,000,000 head of poultry.
23. The gross value of the pastoral produce in 1880 was as follows :

Total
9,855,800
or about £ll per head of the whole population.
24. In addition to the larger and more useful animals, the rabbit, the hare,
the pheasant, and the deer have been introduced; the former two have increased
to such numbers that they have become a nuisance. The native game includes
kangaroos of several varieties, bustards, ducks, geese, swans, snipe, and
quail, so that an agreeable variety of animal food is always procurable. The
coasts of Victoria are fairly well supplied with fish, and in the rivers,
besides the acclimatised trout and perch, are found several excellent varieties
of fish ; one, the Murray cod, grows to a large size.
25. The wool of Victoria is justly regarded as among the best, if not the best
in the world, and realizes the highest price in all the markets of Europe. This
result is as much attributable to the skill and energy of the flock-owners, who
have spared neither labour nor expense in procuring the best stud-sheep from
Europe, as from the exceptional adaptability of the soil and climate to the
various varieties of the ovine race, and especially to the merino. The cattle
are as large and as well-bred as any in the United Kingdom, and the breed of
horses, both blood and draught, not at all inferior, A great stimulus is given
to horse-breeding by the racing clubs and agricultural societies which are to
be found all over the colony.
26. Attempts have been made by the Acclimatisation Society to grow
Angora wool and to introduce ostrich-farming. The soil and climate north
of the Dividing Range are believed to be well adapted for these purposes.
MINES AND MINERALS.
27. Gold-mining is an important industry. The total quantity raised up to
the end of 1881 was 50,505,567 ounces, valued at £202,022,268. The total


raised throughout the whole of Australia and New Zealand up to the same
date was valued at £288,000,000, so that Victoria has raised more than two-
thirds of the whole quantity of gold raised in this part of the world. The
number of miners employed during 1881 was 53,128, of whom 45,187 were
Europeans and 7,941 Chinamen, and the yield was 858,850 ozs., valued at
£3,435,400, Most of the mines are now worked hy large public companies,
and some of the shafts are sunk to great depths. Nineteen shafts are more
than 1,000 feet deep, one at Stawell being 2,500, and another nearly 2,000.
The value of mining plant and machinery at the end of 1881 was estimated
at about £2,000,000 sterling.
28. Victoria contains other metals and minerals besides gold, and within
the last few months considerable impetus has been given to coal, tin, and copper
mining. Silver, antimony, lignite, cobalt, and kaolin are also found ; there
are abundant supplies of slate and building stone, and clays well adapted for
brickmaking and pottery.
MANUFACTURES.
29. Statistics of manufactures and works in operation are usually collected
by means of the staff employed by the municipal bodies to collect statistics of
agriculture. The collectors are instructed to obtain returns only from establish-
ments of an extensive character, except when the existence of industries of an
unusual or interesting character seems to call for special comment. No attempt
is made to enumerate mere shops, although some manufacturing industry may
be carried on thereat. Were this done, the record of manufactories of the
colony might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. On April 1, 1881, the
census collectors were instructed to obtain accurate returns. There were at
that date 145 flour mills in the colony, which, during the year, operated upon
7,281,053 bushels of wheat, and produced 157,784 tons of flour ; 81 breweries,
in which 12,314,224 gallons of beer were brewed ; 165 brick yards, some
being also potteries, which made 55,565,715 bricks and pottery valued at
£34,600 ; 151 tanneries and fellmongeries, which operated upon 2,066,061
hides and skins, and produced leather, basils, pelts, &c., valued at £1,406,274 ;
16 woollen mills, which used 1,372,603 lbs. of wool, and produced 1,095,013
yards of tweed, cloth, and flannel, 1,892 blankets and other products ; 38 soap
and candle works, producing articles worth £450,924 ; 10 tobacco manu-
factories, producing 1,646,850 lbs. of tobacco, 4,213,000 cigars, the total value
being £199,920. There were besides, 92 workers in books and stationery, 7
in musical instruments, 13 in prints and pictures, 20 in carving, turning, &c.,
6 in designs, medals, and dies, 1 in philosophical instruments, 6 in surgical
instruments, 4 in arms and ammunition, 134 in machine tools and implements,
192 in carriages and harness, 19 in ship and boat building, 29 in materials for
building houses, 78 in furniture, 44 in chemicals, 218 in dress, 18 in fibrous
materials, 44 in animal food, 182 in vegetable food, 260 in drinks and
stimulants, 255 in animal matters, 420 in vegetable matters, 20 in coal, 219
in stone, clay, earthenware and glass, 2 in water, 28 in gold, silver, and precious
stones, and 159 in metals other than gold and silver,
30. The value of the materials operated upon during 1880 was £8,012,745,
and the value of the articles produced £13,384,836. This shows that the
manufactures added £5,372,091 to the wealth of the colony, and that the
manufacturing interest is nearly as important as the agricultural, which only
produced £5,395,020, and much more important than the gold-mining. The
number of manufacturing establishments during 1881 was 2,469, the number
of hands employed 38,141, and the approximate value of the land, machinery,
and plant, £7,465,328.

WAGES OF EMPLOYES AND PRICE OF FOOD.
31. The subjoined tables show the cost of living in Victoria and the remune-
ration of all classes of employes. It will be seen that there is scarcely any
other country in the world in which an artisan, a labourer, or a domestic
servant can obtain so many of the comforts and luxuries of life. The supply
of workmen and workwomen is almost always less than the demand, and it is
very rare that any skilled or unskilled labourer finds any difficulty in procuring
employment. On the other hand, clerks, shopmen, tutors, and the large
class of educated persons who have not been brought up to any profession or
trade, while they are physically unfit for, or, at least unaccustomed to manual
labour, find the battle of life quite as difficult in Victoria as in any part of
Europe. And for two reasons. In the first place, a far larger proportion of
these classes emigrate than amongst those above and those below them ; because
they generally have sufficient means to pay their passage, and because they find
it extremely difficult to gain a livelihood in the mother country. In the second
place owing to the universality of public instruction and the desire for social
advancement in Victoria, the proportion of young persons who desire to gain a
livelihood from occupations requiring some degree of education is larger than
in most parts Europe. It should not be forgotten that it is almost impossible
for any person to obtain employment as a clerk or shopman unless he
possesses a fair knowledge of English.

Throughout Victoria the recognized working day for artisans and labourers is eight hour;
The prices given are those prevailing in the metropolis. In country districts the cost of groceries, tobacco,
wine, Coat, &c., is somewhat higher, and that of agricultural and grazing produce, firewood, &c., lower, than
in Melbourne.


COMMERCE.
34. The imports into Victoria during 1880 amounted in \alue to
£14,556,894, and of the exports to £15,954,559, the total external trade of the
colony being £30,511,453, or at the rate of £35 17s. Bd. per head. This is
a larger proportion than in any other country in the world except Holland.
The trade of Great Britain is £l9 10s. 4d. per head, and of Belgium,
£33 13s. 2d., and of Holland £39 12s. sd.
35. The following table, which gives the distribution of Victorian com-
merce during 1880, shows that the larger proportion of her tiade is with the
United Kingdom. The item “ Other British Possessions ” includes the neigh-
bouring Australian Colonies, with which a large proportion of the intei change
takes place:—

Seventy per cent, of the exports were the produce or manufacture of Victoria.
36. The principal imports wei’e cottons, silks, and woollens, manufactures of
iron, steel, copper and tin, wine beer, spirits, and tobacco, earthen and glass-
ware, books and paper, oils, chemicals, aud drugs.
37. The principal exports were wool, £4,234,045 ; gold aud bullion,
£3,691,822 ; grain, £597,382 ; flour, £244,693 ; preserved meats, £142,368 ;

boots and shoes, £54,131 ; and machinery, £54,995.
38. The fiscal policy of the colony is that of moderate protection.
GOVERNMENT : GENERAL AND MUNICIPAL.
39. The constitution of Victoria is a reflex of that of the United Kingdom.
The Governor, who is appointed by the British Government, is the representa-
tive of the Queen, and performs functions analogous to those of Her Majesty.
The Assembly, which has powers quite as great as those of the House of
Commons, is elected by universal suffrage, and there is no property qualifica-
tions for its members. The Council, which holds a position in the constitution
somewhat similar to that of the House of Lords, is elected by the persons avlio
pay rates to the various municipal corporations, and its members are compelled
to have a small property qualification. The colony enjoys self-government
to the fullest extent. The Ministry of the day can only hold office so long as
they possess the confidence of a majority of the members of the Assembly,
and so soon as they forfeit that confidence, whatever be the cause, they are
compelled to resign and to give way to Members of Parliament who repre-
sent the views of the majority of the popular branch of the Legislature.
40. The revenue of Victoria for the financial year ending June oOth, 1880,
was £5,186,011 and the expenditure £5,108,642. About £1,750,000 was raised
through the customs and excise, stamps, fees, fines, and legacy duty. The
railways, which are the property of the Government, returned more than
a million and a half, nearly a million was derived from sales aud leasing of


public estate, and the balance was made up by the earnings of the post-office
and electric telegraph, ports and harbours, water supply, and a number of smalt
items. The expenditure was upon the ordinary requirements of a government;
education, railways, and water supply, and the interest upon the public debt.
■4l. The public debt of Victoria on June 30th, 1881,amounted to £22,593,102,
and Parliament has authorized the issue of another loan amounting to
£4,000,000. The following arc the principal items for which the public
debt was incurred :
Railways ••• ••• £17,728,366
Water Supply ... ... ••• jwi
Defences ... •••
Public Works and Buildings ... 086,4-6
State Schools ... ... 800,000
42. The average rate paid as interest, after some 6 per cent, debentures have
been paid off, an operation which will commence in 1883, will be per cent.
The railways return about four per cent, profit. The water supply is not quite
so productive, but it is estimated that in about five years the returns from
the* works constructed with the public debt will more than recoup the
Government for the expenditure incurred. _ . . ,
43. Municipal government is universal throughout Victoria, as -well in the
rural districts as in the cities and towns. The ratepayers elect their own
mayor and councillors, and these latter control the streets, lighting, paving,
&c.; the necessary revenue is obtained from rates, from licenses, and from a
subsidy granted by the general Government. The revenue of the various
municipalities was in 1880, £821,953, and the expenditure £976,870 ; these
bodies had incurred debts amounting to £726,525.
EDUCATION.
44. The basis of the educational system of Victoria is that secular
instruction shall be provided by the State, without payment, for all children
whose parents may be willing to accept it, but that, whether accepted oi not,
satisfactory evidence must be produced that all children are educated up to a
oiveu standard. The system has been most successful in its operation ; and for
securing the object sought to be attained, it is believed compares favourably
with that of any other country in the world. It was officially estimated by the
Government Statist that in 1878 all the children in Victoria between the ages of
6 and 15, except about 7|ths per cent., were receiving education during some
portion of the year. It has also been estimated that the children attending school
for not less than thirty days in a quarter amounted to about 68 per cent, of
the numbers on the rolls, a proportion of efficient school attendance which,
it is believed, has been attained in but feiv countries. Higher education is
provided at the University of Melbourne, to which are aftliated a Church of
England (Trinity) and Presbyterian (Ormond) College. A Woiking Mans
College is in process of formation* and there are many high class giammai
schools for young people whose parents desire to pay for their education.
45. There is no State religion in Victoria. All the denominations stand upon
an equal footing as regards the State, which does not contribute any public
money to the funds of any religions body. The most numerous church is
the Episcopalian, presided over by Bishop Moorhouse, which numbered at
the last census 299,542. Next come the Roman Catholics, under Archbishop
Goold, which has 191,157 adherents. The Presbyterians number 132,591;
the Wesleyans, 108,393 ; the Baptists, 20,373 ; the Independents, 19,878 ; the
Lutherans, 11,149; Jews, 4,330 ; and Pagans—principally Chmese—l 1,159.
46. The great majority of the inhabitants of Victoria are of British birth.
Thus, 499,199 were at the last census returned as having been bom in


Victoria, 142,906 in England, 86,733 in Ireland, 48,153 in Scotland, and
4,547 in Wales. Every European nation is, however, represented in the colony.
Germany contributes 6,144 males and 2,427 females ; Holland, 241 males and
81 females ; Belgium, 92 males and 20 females ; Sweden and Norway, 1,319
males and 56 females ; Denmark, 918 males and 121 females.
47. Letters of naturalization are granted to aliens residing in Victoria upon
their taking an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty ; Imt, without becoming natu-
ralized, alien friends resident in the colony may acquire real and personal pro-
perty, and may convey, demise, and bequeath it in the same manner as if they
had been British subjects by birth. Alien women married to British subjects
become thereby naturalized. During the eleven years ended with 1879 the
following persons of different nationalities have become naturalized: —French,
35; Belgians, 5; Dutch, 10; Austrians, 14; Germans, 546; Italians, 24;
Spaniards, 4; Portuguese, 3; Russians, 9; United States, 13; Chinese, 42;
subjects of other countries, 251 ; total, 956.
48. It will be seen from the above information, that great as are the
physical benefits presented by a residence in Victoria, they are equalled if not
excelled by the moral and social advantages. Not only are wages high,
employment steady and easily procured, the climate excellent, and food cheap,
but the government is entirely in the hands of the people ; elementary
education costs nothing, being provided by the State ; all religions are equal
before the law; and there is no State church.
49. To all persons to whom Europe denies a career, and compels them to labour
from infancy to old age for a pittance insufficient to procure the necessaries,
to say nothing of the comforts of life, as well as to the artisan, the farmer,
the small capitalist, the vinegrower, the sericiculturist, the workman—British
and foreign, Dutchman and Dane, Frenchman and German—Victoria says
Come—there is room for all of you—bring your vigorous arms, your valiant
hearts, your skill and knowledge. Come, and bring with you your Avives and
your little ones, for I have room for all of you.
THE VOYAGE FROM EUROPE TO AUSTRALIA.
50. In these days, the rapid voyage between Europe and Australia may be
regarded as a pleasure trip. The passage does not take more than 40 days—
it is frequently done in 37 or 38—and, Avith the exception of a little rough
Aveather in the Bay of Biscay, and perhaps off the Cape of Good Hope, the
sea is almost like a mill-pond all the Avay. Indeed, much less bad weather
is encountered between Plymouth and Melbourne than betAveen Liverpool
and New York ; and the voyage across the Atlantic, although shorter, is
much less agreeable than a trip to the antipodes.
51. There are several means of reaching Australia, and the passage money is
adapted to the pockets of all classes.
52. The mail steamers sail from London, touching at Plymouth and Port Said,
traverse the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, and call at Colombo (Ceylon),
King George’s Sound (Western Australia), and Adelaide (South Australia).
A branch line leaves Venice for Alexandria, and the passengers proceed
across Egypt by railway, meeting the direct steamers at Suez. The steamers
of the Orient line sail from London, touching at Plymouth, St. Vincent (Cape
de Verd Islands), and the Cape of Good Hope. In certain seasons these
fine ships come through the Suez Canal. Then there are lines of steamers
sailing to Melbourne from Hamburg, Antwerp, and Bordeaux ; and the
Messageries Mari times from Marseilles, sailing through the Suez Canal, and
touching at Mauritius and Reunion. From Sydney, Avhich is connected Avith
Melbourne by railway, one line of steamers sails to San Francisco (California),
and another, by Avay of the Queensland ports, to Batavia, Aden, and Naples,
and London. The passagejby any of these routes rarely if ever exceeds 40 clays.


53. There are, in addition to the steamers, regular lines of sailing ships which
ply between Great Britain and Melbourne. The best known are Wigram’s,
Green’s, the White Star, the Victoria, the Aberdeen clippers, the Thames
and Mersey. The ordinary period of the passage is from 70 to 90 days.
54. On both steamers and sailing ships passengers may rely that the pro-
visions will be excellent, and that every care will be taken for their comfort
and convenience.
55. The rates of passage money vary from £7O to £5O in the first class, from
£35 to £2O in the second, and from £lB to £l4 in the steerage.
OCCUPATION.
56. The occupations are classified at the census under a great number of heads.
Like the nationalities and religions, they have been brought on by estimates
to the past year, and may be arranged in the following groups :—Ministering
to Government, 5,000 ; ministering to religion, 1,000 ; ministering to health,
3,000; ministering to law, 1,400; ministering to education, 7,000; ministering
to art, science, and literature, 2,300; traders, 13,000; assisting in exchange
of money or goods, 9,500; ministering to entertaining or clothing, 33,000;
domestic servants, 28,000; contractors, artisans, and mechanics, 51,000;
engaged (in mining, 39,000 ; engaged in pastoral pursuits and agriculture,
110,000; engaged in land carriage, 15,000; engaged in sea navigation, 3000 ;
dealing in food, 17,000; labourers, 34,000; wives, widows, children, &c.,
500,000; following other pursuits or no occupation, about 20,000.
ABORIGINES.
57. It is estimated that, at the first colonization of the district now called
Victoria, the Aborigines numbered 5,000. When the colony was separated
from New South Wales the number was officially stated to be 2,693. In
1877, the Central Board for the Protection of the Aborigines took a census,
by means of which they ascertained that the Aboriginal population had
become reduced to 1,067, of whom 633 were males and 434 were females; the
adults numbered 770, and the children 297; those entirely black numbered
774, and those of mixed blood 293.
ROYAL MINT
58. The Melbourne branch of the Royal Mint was established in 1872. From
the time of its opening to the end of 1880, 4,144,376 ozs. of gold had been
received thereat, valued at £16,557,148. Gold is issued from the Mint as
coin or as bullion. The former, with the exception of 165,000 half-sovereigns
in 1873, and 80,000 in 1877, has consisted entirely of sovereigns, which have
numbered 16,335,800. The bullion issued has amounted to 25,019 ozs.,
valued at £94,757.
BANKS.
59, There are 12 banks of issue with 347 branches within the colony.
According to the sworn returns of these institutions, their note circulation
at the end of 1880 was £1,236,046, and their total liabilities £19,488,572, as
against which the coin and bullion in hand amounted to £3,854,635, and the
total assets to £23,284,822. At the same date the capital stock paid up was
£9 126,250, and the total amount of reserved profits was £2,714,730. The
average rate of last dividend paid to shareholders was per cent, upon the
paid up capital, and the amount of last dividend declared was £474,140.
The shares of most of the banks were at a very high premium.


SAYINGS BANKS.
60. Two kinds of savings banks exist in Victoria—the ordinary savings
banks, which were established in 1842, and the Post Office Savings Banks,
which were established in 1865, Of the former there are 12, and of the latter
190. According to the returns for 1880, the number of depositors in the two
institutions was 92,114, -who had to their credit £1,661,409, or an average of
£lB Os. 9d. to each depositor. The highest rate of interest which savings
banks are permitted to give on money left on deposit is 4 per cent., and this
rate is given by both class of savings banks.
SHIPPING.
61. The number of vessels entered and cleared out in Victorian ports during
1880 numbered 4,191 of an aggregate burden of 2,179,829 tons, and carrying
103,698 men. The tonnage was larger than in any previous year. More
than half the vessels, two-thirds of the tonnage, and three-fourths of the men
belonged to steamers. 1,713 of the ships which entered were colonial, 260
British, and 73 foreign. Of those which cleared 1,771 were colonial, 271
British, and 73 foreign. Amongst foreign flags, the United States ranked first,
Germany second, Holland third, and France fourth.
POST OFFICES.
62. A very efficient postal system exists in Victoria, and post-offices are
established throughout the length and breadth of the colony; 1,100 of such
institutions existed in 1880, as against 802 five years previously. In the
same quinquennial period the letters, newspapers, and packets despatched and
received in a. year increased from less than 24,000,000 to 38,394,169.
MONEY ORDERS.
63. Money-order offices in Victoria in connection with the post-office had been
established in 288 places up to the end of 1880. Besides the issue and pay-
ment of money orders at these places, such orders are issued in favor of Victoria,
and Victorian orders are paid at places in Great Britain and Ireland, Germany,
India, Canada, and in the various Australasian colonies. The number of money
orders issued during the year was 151,677, of an aggregate value of £423,318,
and the number paid was 166,022, of an aggregate value of £485,888. The
number and value of the orders issued in favour of the United Kingdom are
always much greater than the number and value of those received therefrom;
but the reverse is the case with orders between Victoria and the neighbouring
colonies. The net amount remitted to the United Kingdom by this means has,
however, been gradually falling off, whilst the net amount received from the
neighbouring colonies has been fast increasing.
ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHS
64. Telegraphic communication exists in Victoria between 284 stations
■within ber own borders. Her lines are connected besides with the lines of New
South Wales, and by means of them with Queensland and New Zealand. They
are also connected with the lines of South Australia, and by their means with
Western Australia and with the Eastern Archipelago, Asia, Europe, and
America. They are likewise united with a submarine cable to Tasmania. In
1880 the miles of line along which poles extended numbered 3,215, and the
miles of wire 6,019; the telegrams transmitted numbered 1,160,912, of which
348,446 were on Government business. A considerable extension of the lines,
as well as an increase of business, takes place each year.


FRIENDLY SOCIETIES.
65. Friendly Societies in Victoria have for years past been much patronised
by the industrial classes, many of whom have derived great benefit from their
connection therewith. So far as their relations with the State are concerned,
these societies are under the supervi siou of the Government Statist and Registrar;
and there are also public auditors and valuers. Thirty-two parent institutions,
having 748 branches, furnished returns to the Government Statist for 1878.
The number of members was 46,074, of whom 8,810 received sick pay during
the year for periods extending over 58-,443 weeks. The number of members
who died was 425, and the number of wives who died was 218. The total
income during the year was £171,987, and the total expenditure Avas £144,506.
The amount to the credit of the funds at the end of the year, after deducting
debts, was £417,375.
CLERGY.
66. There being no State religion in Victoria, and no money A r oted for any
religious object, the clergy are supported by the efforts of the denomination
to which they are attached. In 1880 the total number of registered clergy
Avas 736, of whom 172 belonged to the Church of England, 93 to the Roman
Catholic Church, 161 to the Presbyterian Church, 144 to the Wesleyan
Church, 49 to the Independent Church, 47 to the Baptist Church, 20 to the
Bible Christian Church, sto the Jewish Denomination. Besides these there are
officials connected Avitb some of the denominations Avho, without being
regularly ordained, perform the functions of clergymen, and are styled lay
readers, lay assistants, local preachers, mission agents, &c. The number of
these is not known.
CHURCHES AND CHAPELS.
67. The buildings used for public worship throughout Victoria in 1880 num-
bered 3,307, of which 353 Avere State schools. The approximate number of
services performed during the year Avas 267,126; the number of persons
for whom accommodation was provided was 419,370, and the number of
persons usually attending worship Avas 267,126. Of the whole number of
buildings used for religious services, 573 belonged to the Church of England,
860 to the Presbyterians, 912 to the Methodists, 531 to the Roman Catholics,
167 to the Independents, 112 to the Bible Christians, and 77 to the Baptists.
CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.
68. There is no poor law in Victoria, but a very complete organization exists
for the relief of the sick, the infirm, and the necessitous, by means of the
many excellent charitable institutions Avhich are scattered throughout the
length and breadth of the colony. These establishments are for the most part
subsidised by the State, and many of them are also largely contributed to by
private persons. There are 34 general hospitals, besides a Lying-in Hospital,
an Eye and Ear Hospital, and a Children’s Hospital; there is also a Blind
Asylum, a Deaf and Dumb Asylum, and an Immigrants’ Home. There are
5 Benevolent Asylums, 7 Orphan Asylums, 9 Industrial and Reformatory
Schools, 5 Hospitals for the Insane, and 5 Female Refuges. These institu-
tions had in all 28,442 inmates during 1880 ; their total receipts Avere
£283,732, of which £203,574 Avas from the Government, and their expendi-
ture AA r as £280,469. There are 37 other associations for the relief of distressed
or indigent persons, which are generally managed by ladies. These are termed
Benevolent Societies ; the names of three of them indicate their connection
with the Jewish body, but no distinctive denomination is perceptible in the
titles of the others. The acts of relief during the year numbered 11,378, the
receipts amounted to £14,016, of which £6,530 Avas from the Government,
and £7,486 from private sources, and the expenditure to £13,802.

By Authority: John Ferres, Government Printer, Melbourne.
G 9. The Melbourne Public Library is open to all classes of persons over 14
years of age, without payment, on week days, between ten a.m. and ten p.m.
The buildings up to the end of 1878 had cost Ti 11,004, and were still
unfinished. These funds were provided by the Government, as also were
further moneys amounting, with the sum just named, to £313,162. The
estimated value of the private contributions, consisting of books, pamphlets,
maps, &e., is £13,020; and the total number of books in the library 111,594.
The institution was visited in 1880 by 261,886 persons. In most of the
towns in the colony there are free libraries, athemienms, or scientific, literary,
or mechanics* institutes, some of which receive books on loan from the
Melbourne Public Library. One hundred and eighty-eight of those institu-
tions furnished returns for 1880. ' Their statements show that the total
receipts in that year amounted to £26,805, of which £7,128 was contributed
by Government, and £19,677 by private individuals ; that the number of
volumes amounted to 254,168; and that the number of visits during-the year
amounted to 2,600,000.
70. The National Gallery contained, at the end of 1880, 93 oil paintings, 17
objects of statuary, and 8,020 drawings, engravings, and photographs. The
school of painting connected with this institution was attended in the year
by 5 male and 33 female students, and the school of design by 61 male and
107 female students. The Industrial and Technological Museum, which joins
the last-named institution, contains 1,433 publications, 30,672 specimens, and
150 drawings. Class lectures, given in 1880, on chemistry and mineralogy,
were attended by 43, on engineering by 361 students. The collections of
the National Museum, which is situated on the grounds of the Melbourne
University, consist of specimens of minerals, stuffed animals and birds,
insects and other objects of curiosity. The cost of the edifice was £8,500,
and it was visited in 1880 by 96,247 persons. All these institutions are
open to the public free of charge.
