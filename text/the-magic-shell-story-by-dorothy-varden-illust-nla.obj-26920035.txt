It was a glorious Summer morning, and Judy had spent a
lovely time on the beach, playing and paddling in the cool, sparkling
water.
She walked slowly along the warm, golden sands, hoping to
find some of the beautiful shells which sometimes were washed up
on the shore.
Presently she came to some rocks which barred her way. She
climbed to the top of the barrier, and found herself looking down
at a tiny, sheltered cove; protected on each side by rocky arms
stretching out into the sea.
There was a little beach of clean, smooth sand, and Judy
carefully climbed down, thinking how lovely it was to find such a
delightful place and have it all to herself !
She sat down at the water's edge, looking out towards the
blue sea, glittering in the bright sunshine.

Judy climbed to the top of the barrier.


A
J \ movement on the water suddenly caught her eye. She
looked closely, and saw a beautiful shell, quietly floating towards
her on the incoming tide.
Judy longed to wade into the sea and grasp it; but she knew
it was too far away to reach, and she had promised never to risk
the danger of entering the deep water.
So she held her breath, and hoped that the lovely shell would
come in close to the shore.
Slowly it floated closer and closer, Judy watching anxiously
all the while. At last it reached the shallow water, and Judy dashed
in and picked it up in triumph.
She waded back to the little beach, holding it very carefully
in her hands. She sat down with the shell in her lap, and gazed at
the delicate colours glowing beneath its pearly sheen.
Quietly she sat in the pleasant warmth of the sheltered cove,
admiring this lovely thing that had been brought to her by the
gently flowing tide. *

3he held the shell to her ear and listened to the sound of
the sea. She knew that when the seas were stormy, the roar of
the wind and the noise of the angry waves would thunder from
the hidden depths of the shell.
But now the sea was calm and peaceful, and all she could
hear was a quiet, drowsy murmur, like a softly sung lullaby.
Judy listened tor a while, and was about to put the shell
back in her lap, when she heard the whispered sound of her own
name !
"Judy! Judy!" whispered the voice from the shell.
"It can't be!" thought Judy. "I

the whispered reply.

Judy leaned forward, and gently placed the shell on the water
lapping so quietly at her feet.
And then the strangest thing happened ! As soon as the
shell touched the water, it began to grow bigger and bigger.
Quickly it grew, until it became the size of a small boat, and,
strangest thing of all, standing in the shell appeared a very lovely
lady !
The lady wore a long, beautiful green dress, and she spoke
in the clearest, sweetest voice Judy had ever heard.
"Thank you very much, dear," she said. "It was kind of you
to do as I asked."
Judy was too amazed to speak ! She was tongue-tied with
surprise, and perhaps just a little scared at the wonderful thing
she had seen.
Words were bubbling up inside her, but she just couldn't get
them out!
The lovely lady saw that Judy was a little shalcen. She smiled
kindly, and said, "Don't be afraid, dear; nothing can harm you."
A wave of relief swept over Judy. Somehow she knew she
had nothing to fear in the presence of this kind, beautiful stranger.

last the words struggled forth. "Oh, please tell me all
about yourself," begged Judy. "I can't understand what has
happened."
The lady stepped out of her boat, and sat beside Judy on
the soft, warm sand.
"We are going to give Father Neptune a birthday party,"
she said, "and we asked him to meet us here in this secret little
cove."
"But there's only one of you," said the bewildered Judy.

had Judy seen such a beautiful sight. All the colours
of the rainbow flashed in the bright sunlight. The delicate tints
of the pretty shell boats, and the gaily coloured dresses of the
passengers, made a blaze which almost took her breath away !
Leaving their boats rocking in the wavelets, the lovely ladies
jumped ashore, and surrounded Judy and her friend in a merry,
laughing group, talking excitedly about the party.
Judy soon learned that these happy people were Sea Nymphs,
who had come from near and far to celebrate Father Neptune's
birthday.
They had lovely names: Crystobel and Lurline and Diana and
Rosalind were some that Judy could remember.
The name of Judy's friend was Helen.
"Hurry up, girls!" cried Helen. "Father Neptune will soon
be here."
The Sea Nymphs ran to their boats, and hurried back with
all sorts of parcels. These they opened, and spread out on a rug
of woven seaweed. There were oyster patties and sandwiches of
shrimp and crab-meat, and all the most delicious sea-food you
could imagine, and lemonade in golden goblets !

When everything was
they gathered on the shore, look-
ing out to sea for Father Neptune.
"Who is he, really?"
pered Judy to Helen.
"Why, dear, don't
know?" replied Helen. "He's the
Ruler of th£ Sea." \ \ %
Suddenly the water in the cove was violently disturbed. It
heaved and boiled and foamed, and then, breaking the surface,
then, breaking the surface,
appeared the head and shoulders of a big, bearded, jolly-looking
old gentleman !
The water streamed from his hair and beard as he strode
ashore, waving his trident on high and laughing in great good
humour.
"Many Happy Returns," Father Neptune," cried the Sea
Nymphs, as they crowded around to give him a birthday kiss.
And "Many Happy Returns" piped Judy, timidly, when it came
to her turn.
"Why, bless my soul!" boomed Father Neptune, in his great,
deep voice, "who is this little stranger?"
Helen hastened to explain, and Father Neptune lifted Judy
in his strong arms, so that she, too, could give him a birthday
kiss.


King Neptune saf on his sand throne.


TL Sea Nymphs and Judy helped to make Father Neptune
comfortable. They heaped up the sand into a kind of throne,
and there he sat, with his trident stuck in the sand beside him.
It was a long iron staff, with three prongs at the top, and
Judy regarded it with much curiosity.
"Is that Father Neptune's toasting fork?" she whispered to
Helen.
"No, dear," answered Helen. "That is his sceptre. It is the
emblem of his authority over all the sea."
"Ho! Ho! Ho!" roared Father Neptune, who had overheard
the question. "Toasting fork! That's quite a good idea. I never
thought of using it for that!"
The party went with
swing.
Father Neptune did full justice to all
the good things provided, and the
Sea Nymphs and Judy also had their
share.
"Now, what about a song?" cried
Father Neptune, when the last crumb
had disappeared.


The party went with
swing.

At once there was bustle and confusion of a hurried
departure. Hastily the remains of the feast were cleared away,
and there was a rush to the boats.
"I'll tow you into the deep water, 1 Vcried Father Neptune,
and, grasping the whipit were flung rfc him, he plunged into

Slowly the fleet drew away, while Judy waved farewell. Sad
she felt at parting from her new friends, and she wished there had
been time to arrange a future meeting
Father Neptune released the ropes, and disappeared beneath
the sea, with a last good-bye and thunderous shout of "Thanks
for the party."
Faintly she heard Helen's clear, sweet voice calling "Good-
bye, Judy dear; we will meet again."
She saw Helen stretch her arms over the water, as she had
done before. Again she heard the strange, magic word, and, as
the sound died away, the boats and their lovely passengers
disappeared !
Judy rubbed her startled eyes; but all she could now see was
a fleet of the pretty shells, floating quietly out to sea on the ebbing
tide.
Her eyes wandered wistfully over the silent, empty beach,
which so recently had been bright and gay with movement and
laughter and song.


Judy lifted beautifilKshell from the water, and carefully
carried it horpe. Often she places it to her ear, and sometimes, in
rough weather, she fancies she can hear Father Neptune's deep,
rolling voices mingled with the /oar of seas.

She placed it gently on the water, but again there was no
response.
