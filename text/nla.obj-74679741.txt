A.P.A. Leaflet, No. 7.
The War Precautions Act
and a Proposed Amendment
Under the provisions of the War
Precautions Act, 1914-16, and the very
numerous regulations made there-
under, the naval and military autho-
rities have the widest and most arbi-
trary power that could be well con-
ceived. Nothing more arbitrary and
subversive of civil liberties could be
devised even were Australia, as Ger-
many is, in a state of siege.
It ought to be an obvious truism in
a democracy of the character existing
in Australia that no deprivation of the
rights and liberties of individuals
should be countenanced except upon
the gravest consideration. It is cer-
tain that no such conditions exist in
Australia as would warrant the hand-
ing over to the military authorities of
these vast powers; in fact, Justices
Duffy and Rich, in their dissenting
judgment in the bread case, 22 A.L.R.,
at p. 213, say that Melbourne ? is con-
ducting its domestic affairs as in times
of profound peace;? and what is true
of Melbourne is true of Australia in
this respect. However, our War Pre-
. Acts and Regulations do
place in the hands of the military
authorities the whole of the civil
liberties.
NO PARLIAMENTARY SANCTION.
Be it remembered that regulations
are not passed by Parliament ?they
are made by the Governor-in-Council;
they do not necessarily express the
will of Parliament, and Parliament
does not debate them. No such ex-
tensive delegation of power has been
made in English constitutional history
since the time of Henry VIII. Be-
hind the backs of your representa-
tives are your liberties thus filched
away. By these regulations the mili-
tary authorities are empowered to
arrest, search and question any per-
son, to enter at any time anywhere,
seize property and detain it, and so on.
Under Regulation 19, any person
who for any purpose attempted to
elicit information with regard to
the condition of the troops would
render himself liable to six months?
imprisonment. If you speak over
your ?phone in any language other
than English, you may have your
telephone cut off, and suffer other
penalties. If the military authorities*
have certain suspicions of you, how-
ever unfounded and erroneous, they
may go on board and prevent your
taking a proposed sea trip.
NO FREE SPEECH.
Under the fatal 28th Regulation,
the freedom of expression is gone.
This regulation makes it an offence
for a mother to plead with her son
not to enlist, to engage in any con-
versation in public or private which
might be construed by a jingoistic
magistrate as likely to prejudice re-
cruiting. It is under this regulation
that Barker, Skurrie, Klausen, Man-
deno and others were gaoled for the
expression of working-class senti-
ments ; Holland fined heavily for pub-
lishing anti - conscription literature ;
and generally the mouths of people
effectively closed on anti-militaristic
questions.
Under a sub-clause, the Censor
stands guard over any proposed pub-
lication dealing in any way with the
war or matters arising out of it, and
may, by most effective means, prevent
its issue. The censors are military
men, to whom labor and peace ideas
are notoriously anathema. No refer-
ence, direct or indirect, can be made to
the fact that an article has been
censored. *? v y
BRUTAL POWER OF SEARCH.
But Regulation ,50 is par excellence
the weapon of oppression in the hands
of the military. On the merest sus-
picion?may be without the slightest
justification?they may enter your
home at any time, day or night, by
force if they think it necessary, ran-
sack the place from top to bottom,
search you, and cause your wife to be
searched by female searchers, seize
anything within the very wide ambit
of this regulation, take it away and de-
tain it or destroy it, or deal with it as
they think fit; and however outrage-
ously you may have been treated, you
have no redress.
The suspicion may be baseless, the
seizure unwarrantable. You cannot
appeal, you cannot get compensation,
no civil tribunal can be approached,
there are no means of calling in ques-
tion the- officer?s bona fides ?his mere
opinion, is final and fatal.
FACTS TO FACE.
Under this regulation the premises
of the Australian Peace Alliance
raided and searched by two officers,,
and thousands of copies of two leaflets
were seized and taken. They are de-
tained now, and the military authori-
ties refuse to return them or to give
any information concerning them. One
leaflet is by the well-known writer,
John A. Hobson, and was published
in England (in the ? Nation?) and in
Victoria, presumably with the cen-
sor?s permission. It is a striking ar-
ticle?it deals with the question of
peace ?but the military say the people
shall not see it. The other deals also
with peace, and was published in the
? Labor Leader.? It is called ?Wo-
men and Children First.? But our
military authorities will not allow it
to be distributed here, and the public
are at their mercy.
The Socialist Party?s premises have
been, raided and * searched; so, too,
have . those of the No-Conscrip-
tion Fellowship. Printed matter was
seized and. its fate is unknown. Ross,
of the Socialist Party, was accosted in
the street and threatened with a per-
sonal search there and then, and they
have the power to do this to any man
(see Reg. 50b) on the merest sus-
picion.


THE WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT AND A PROPOSED AMENDMENT.
Lastly, but by no means leastly, the
Trades Hall of Melbourne was raided
at midnight, and the carefully pre-
pared and moderate report of the
Trades Union Congress on Conscrip-
tion seized and later the premises of
the ? Labor Call ? were visited and
copies seized there as well as the set-
up type. The entire number of the
? Socialist ? of August 4 was seized
and confiscated.
AMEND THE ACT.
Against these arbitrary proceedings,
there is no redress of any sort, nor any
appeal. These powers are undoubtedly
too wide. They are unnecessary, and
constitute the gravest danger to de-
mocracy; for democracy cannot pos-
sibly function in face of this repres-
sion.
It is imperative that something be
done, and done at once.
Two courses are open:?
(1) Repeal the Act altogether;
(2) Amend the Act by giving to ag-
grieved persons the right of appeal to
a civil court.
It is proposed to ask Parliament to
pass the following short Amendment.
No action shall be brought against
any naval or military authority, or any
person acting under the authority of
any naval or military authority for
anything done without malice, under
the provisions of the War Precautions
Act, 1914-16, or any Regulation made
thereunder, but any person, company,
firm or other body or group of persons
aggrieved in any manner by anything
done or omitted to be done or any re-
fusal or neglect to do any act, matter
or thing whatsoever, by any such naval
or military authority or person author- !
ised as aforesaid, may appeal to a Jus-
tice of the High Court or of a State
by summons or petition in a summary
manner. And upon the hearing, the
said Justice shall have power to award
any compensation he shall think fit,
or to make any order against the said
naval or military authority, directing
such naval or military authority to do
or refrain from doing any act, matter
or thing whatsoever, and generally
make any order as such Justice
shall seem just, including an order as
to costs.
If you think this Amendment is
necessary, lend the movement your
support. By action in your union,
league, or other organisation, you may
have the foregoing amendment ap-
proved and your Federal Representa-
tive instructed to vote for it.
