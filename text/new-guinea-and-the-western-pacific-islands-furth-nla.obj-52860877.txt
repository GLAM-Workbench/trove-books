Sift, • Downing Street, June 18, 1383.
Her Majesty’s Government have considered the request of the Governments of
the Australian Colonies that the Queen’s sovereignty ma} T be established in the eastern
part of the island of New Guinea, possession of which was taken in Her Majesty’s name
by Mr, Chester, an officer of the Queensland Government, on the 4th of April last, by
proclamation, a copy of which I am to enclose, and they are of opinion that sufficient
reasons have not been shown for the annexation at the present time of so large an extent
of territory.
It is, however, very desirable to be assured that no foreign Power will attempt to take
possession of, or to exercise jurisdiction over, any part of the territory included in the
proclamation.
I am, therefore, directed by the Earl of Derby to request that Earl Granville will have
the goodness to inform him whether, having regard to the steps which have been taken
at various times in recent years, and more particularly (1) by Captain Moresby, R.N.,
when, in the year 1874, he took possession of the islands at the south-eastern end of
New Guinea; (2) by Her Majesty’s Government in annexing to the Colony of
Queensland other islands on the south shore of New Guinea in the year 1878; and (3)
to the step lately taken under the direction of the Government of Queensland, as well as
to the fact publicly known through the papers presented to Parliament, that the
establishment of the Queen’s sovereignty in New Guinea has long been under con-
sideration, Her Majesty’s Government can rely with full confidence on the absence of
interference by any foreign Power in New Guinea, pending the declaration of the
Queen’s pleasure with respect to the prayer of the Australian Governments.
Lord Derby does not, of course, suppose that it is probable that such interference will
take place, but in such a case as this it is desirable to guard, as far as possible, against
the risk of any foreign claim being set up.
In connexion with this point I am to call attention to the letter from Sir T. Mcllwraith,
printed at page 132 of the Parliamentary Paper on New Guinea [C. —3617], lately
published, of which I enclose a copy.

Your Excellency, Sydney, April 22, 1884,
I have the honour to submit to you—condensed in a few words —the, chief points,
referring to our conversation on Friday last.
I, —I -wish to know if it is the intention of the Imperial Government to appoint a
Deputy Commissioner for the North-east Coast of New Guinea, or anywhere near the
Maclay Coast.
11. —Can Ibe sure that the requests in my letter of 28th October 1883* (I have
the honour to send you a copy), which I addressed to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies, on behalf of the inhabitants of the Maclay Coast, as their Representative
(pro tern.), will be regarded in case of a British Protectorate or Annexation ?
The reason why I am anxious to have a decided answer, will be easily understood
by your Excellency. Knowing the natives of the Maclay Coast well, and having gained
with considerable difficulty their perfect confidence, the presence of a Deputy Commis-
sioner will place me (as well as the Deputy Commissioner) in a false and difficult
position with regard to the Natives, which will necessarily lead to a general
misunderstanding.
I have taken the liberty of placing this request before you, on account of the following
opinion lately expressed in the Report of the Western Pacific Commission :
“ This (the Maclay Coast) is the part of New Guinea most remote from Australia,
and is inhabited by quiet and friendly natives, over whom Baron Miklouho-Maclay
(a Russian subject) has acquired an influence which it might be difficult, and certainly
would be undesirable to overthrow or undermine.”
* This copy is not sent. It is printed on page 85 of [C.-3863.] of February 1884, containing <£corrc-
“ spondence respecting New Guinea and other islands, and the Convention at Sydney of Representatives of

In case your Excellency should not find yourself in a position to give me the required
information, I beg that you will submit the above to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies, and grant me the favour of his reply.

Enclosure in No. 5.
My Lord, Foreign Office, August 9, 1884.
The German Ambassador called upon me yesterday by appointment, and
informed me that his government wished to take steps to protect more efficiently those
islands, and those parts of islands in the South Sea Archipelago, where German trade
is largely; developed and is daily increasing. They desired, therefore, to come to a
friendly understanding with Her Majesty’s Government as to the general principles to
be observed for the protection of subjects of the two countries respectively, and also as
to the limits of the islands and territories in which either country is most interested.
Count Munster added that the wish of the Australian colonies to settle on the side
of New Guinea opposite to Australia, and to exclude from that part of the island settle-
ments or establishments of other countries was regarded by the German Government
as perfectly natural. But the German Government were of opinion that there are parts
of the wild country on the north side of New Guinea which might be available as a
field for German enterprise.
I observed to Count Munster that the statement which he had just made appeared
to me to be of a general and preliminary character. I could only • answer in a general
way and from a personal knowledge of the views of the Colonial Office on these
subjects.
I must repeat, I said, that we had no jealously of German colonisation, unless in any
particular case it should clash with the acquired rights of this country. I was quite
aware of the important positions which Germany occupies, in some of the islands
alluded to. The German Government, on the other hand, must also be aware of those
in which Great Britain has a great interest. I did not think that the Colonial Office
would object to, on the contrary I believed that they would approve of, a more precise
definition of the places in which the two countries respectively held a predominant
position.
With regard to New Guinea, on which island Germany had as yet founded no
establishment, the German Government knew that communications had been taking
place between the Home and Colonial Governments, and I might mention, but at
present in confidence, that those communications are nearer a conclusion than is as yet
known to the public:
I added that there were islands on which the predominance of Germany is undoubted,
there were others on which that of Great Britain is clear. There might be spots where
the interest of the two countries is more equal, and where the arrangements to he made
would require more careful consideration, but I believed that there ought to be no
difficulty in coming to conclusions satisfactory to both countries.
It appeared to me, I said, that it would facilitate a good understanding if the two
Governments were to come to some such common agreement against the foundation of
convict establishments, as I had recently proposed with regard to South Africa.
I begged Count Munster to consider this answer as informal. It was only intended
to encourage the German Government to give a more distinct idea of their views, and
further,explanations as to the particular islands and parts of islands referred to as being
those where German trade is largely developed and is daily increasing.
After consultation with my colleagues, I was able this afternoon further to inform
Count Munster that Her Majesty’s Government had no desire to oppose the extension
of German colonisation in the islands of the South Seas which are unoccupied by any
civilized Power.
I added that the extension of some form of British authority in New Guinea, which
will be shortly announced, will only embrace that part of the island which specially
interests the Australian colonies, without prejudice to any territorial questions beyond
those limits.

Sir, Downing Street, August 28, 1884.
With reference to the decision of Her Majesty’s Government to advise the
Queen to establish Her Majesty’s protectorate over the greater part of the coasts of
New Guinea lying, to the eastward of that part of the island which is claimed by the


Government of the Netherlands, I am desired by the Earl of Derby to enclose a report
taken from the “ Times ” of the 12th of this month of an answer given in Parliament by
Mr. Gladstone to Sir W. McArthur, and to request that you will inform Earl Granville
that circumstances render it most desirable, in Lord Derby’s opinion, that the procla-
mation of the Queen’s protectorate over so much of the island as it is intended to bring
within the scope of it should no longer be delayed, and his Lordship therefore proposes,
with Lord Granville’s concurrence, to take immediate steps to give effect to Her
Majesty’s intention in this respect.
The portions of New Guinea over which it is proposed that the protectorate of Her
Majesty should extend consist of all the coasts of the island not in the possession of the
Dutch Government, with the exception of that portion of the northern coast comprised
between the 145th degree of east longitude and the eastern' boundary of the territory
claimed by the Dutch, including the small islands immediately adjacent to those portions
of the coast over which the protectorate will extend. The 145 th degree of east longitude
is proposed as the western limit of the British protectorate on the northern coast, in
order to include within it the territory owned by natives on the “ Maclay coast,”
whose claim for such protection was a principal consideration with Her Majesty’s
Government when they determined to advise Her Majesty to assume this responsibility.
The Maclay coast extends from the neighbourhood of the Cape Croisilles (which is to
the eastward of longitude 145) to Cape King William, and south of this last-mentioned
point commences the narrower portion of New Guinea, the whole of which it is necessary
to bring under British control.
Lord Derby trusts that Lord Granville will be able to signify at a very early date his
concurrence in the course proposed to be taken in regard to this question.

New Guinea.
Sir W. McArthur asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether the “ Protection ”
mentioned in Lord Derby’s despatch of May Q, 1884, to the Governors of the Australian
Colonies, as intended to be established in New Guinea, and towards the cost of which
the Australian Colonies had agreed to pay 15,000/. for the year, would establish the
complete jurisdiction of the British Government over New Guinea and the adjacent
islands, so as to afford protection to the natives, not only against the lawlessness of
British subjects, but against the lawlessness of the subjects of other nations.
Mr. Gladstone. —The protection mentioned in the despatch of Lord Derby is in the
nature of a protection which Her Majesty’s Government advised the Queen to establish
over so much of the coast of New Guinea as lies to the eastward of the Dutch claim
upon the sduthem coast of that island, but excluding portions on the northern side of
the island. I cannot give a minute definition now of the line up to which this protec-
torate will extend, but within the limits of it, it will answer the purpose mentioned by
my hon. friend in his question, that is to say, the jurisdiction of the Government will
be sufficient to afford protection to the natives against lawless action, by whomsoever
taken, whether by British subjects or foreigners. The jurisdiction does not extend to
the islands to the north and east of New Guinea.
Sir H. Wolff asked whether the Government of the Netherlands had been com-
municated with on the subject.
Mr. Gladstone.—l do not see why there should be any communication with the
Government of the Netherlands, inasmuch as everything to which that Government lay
claim has been carefully excluded from the arrangement.
Sir H. Holland asked whether an independent High Commissioner would be appointed
, to govern New Guinea.
Mr. Ashley replied that the High Commissioner, when appointed, would be entirely
independent of the Governor of Fiji,

Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Berlin of the 9th of August, recording the substance of a
conversation which had taken place between Lord Granville and the German Ambas-
sador at this Court, with reference to the wish of his Government to come to a friendly
understanding with that of Her Majesty in regard to the protection to be afforded to
British and German subjects in the South Sea Archipelago, and as to the limits of the
islands and territories in those regions over which either country might seek to extend
its interests and influence, the case of New Guinea being especially referred to on the
occasion of the conversation in question.
Lord Granville has since received your letter, dated August 28th,f and its enclosure,
stating that, in Lord Derby’s opinion, circumstances render it most desirable that the
Proclamation of the Queen’s Protectorate, which had been decided upon over so much
of the coast of New Guinea as is not in the possession of the Dutch Government, and
with certain other specified limitations, should no longer be delayed.

(Draft.)
.■Sir, Foreign Office, September , 1884.
In my confidential despatch of the 9th ultimo, I recorded the substance of a
conversation which had taken place on the previous day between myself and the German
Ambassador, with reference to the desire of his Government to come to a friendly
understanding with that of Her Majesty as to the protection of British and German
subjects in the South Sea Archipelago, and as to the limits of the islands and territories
in those regions over which either country might seek to extend its interests and
.influence.
On that occasion Count Munster observed that there were parts of the wild country
on the north side of New Guinea which might be available as a field for German enter-
prise, and I informed his Excellency that the extension of British authority in New
Guinea, which would be shortly announced, would only embrace that part of the island
which specially interests the Australian Colonies, without prejudice to any territorial
questions beyond those limits.
The result of the communications which have lately been going on between the Home
and Colonial Governments is, that Her Majesty’s Government now propose to proclaim
and establish the Queen’s Protectorate over all the coasts of New Guinea not occupied
bv the Netherlands, except that portion of the northern coast comprised between the
145th degree of East Longitude and the eastern Dutch boundary.
The British Protectorate will include the small islands immediately adjacent to those
portions of the coast over which it is established.
* No. 5. f No. 6.


The 145th degree of East Longitude has been fixed as the western British limit on
the northern coast, in order that it should embrace the territory owned by the Natives
on the Maclay coast, whose claim for British protection has long been under the con-
sideration of Her Majesty’s Government, and was one of the principal reasons which
determined them to advise the Queen to assume the responsibility of establishing a
Protectorate in New Guinea.
The Maclay coast extends to the southward as far as Cape King William, where
commences that part of the coast extending to the Dutch southern boundary, which, for
obvious reasons, it is indispensable to bring under British control.
Her Majesty’s Government have been actuated in making this communication by their
desire to promote the friendly understanding which the German Government have
proposed to establish with reference to these territorial questions, and I have accordingly
to instruct you to communicate to them the substance of this despatch in a note to the
Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Majesty, as to the protection of the interests of German and British subjects respectively
in the South Sea Archipelago, and for the more precise definition of British and German
territorial interests in those regions, to which further reference is made in my letter of
the 6th instant.f .I am now to request that you will state to the Earl of Derby that he
German Charge d’Affaires has called at this Office to say that his Government consider
that this subject would be best treated by a Commission, and that if this plan were
agreed to, they would appoint as German Commissioners Mr. Krauel, German Consul-
General at Sydney, and Doctor Stiibel, Councillor of Legation and Acting Consul at
Apia.
He added that his Government proposed Levuka as the place of meeting for the
Commission, partly because it was central, and also because Mr. Krauel was going there
in connexion with the proposed investigation of the land claims of German subjects
in Fiji.
Baron von Plessen begged for an answer to the above proposal, and expressed a wish
to learn the names of the British Commissioners, if the idea of a Joint Commission were
accepted.

Lord Derby would suggest that the reply might be to the effect that, putting aside
the question of New Guinea, which has been the subject of separate communications,
Her Majesty’s Government think there will be advantage in a joint consideration of the
interests of Germany and England, and of the subjects of the two countries, in the Pacific
Ocean, but that Her Majesty’s Government are disposed to think that it would be
preferable that the subject should be first discussed generally in this country by repre-

G OVERNOR SIR W. F. D. JERVOIS, G.C.M.G., C.B. (NEW ZEALAND), to the RIGHT
HON. THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G. (Received September 26, 1884.)
Government House, Wellington,
My Lord, August 16, 1884.
With reference to previous correspondence concerning the steps taken by
Mr. John Lundon of this Colony with a view to the annexation to New Zealand of the
Samoan Group, I have the honour to transmit herewith extracts from the “ Auckland
Weekly News ” of the 26th January last, and the “ New Zealand Herald ” of the Bth
inst., on the subject.
2. I am bringing these extracts to the notice of the High Commissioner of the
Western Pacific. Your Lordship will perceive, however, that not much importance is
attached to Mr. Lundon’s movement, either in this Colony or in Samoa,
I have, &c.

Enclosure 1 in No. 13.
From the “ Auckland Weekly News,” January 26, 1884.
New Zealand and Samoa.
Mr. John Lundon has received from Samoa a copy of a petition to the Queen, which
has been drawn up, asking that Her Majesty W'ould allow the islands to be joined to
New Zealand. The petition refers to the fact that the people of Samoa had been taught
to worship God by missionaries from England, and prays Her Majesty “to cast the
shadow of your mighty Empire over us.” The petition goes on to state that they
desire to advance in civilization, in religion, as part of the Government of New Zealand.
They had asked the New Zealand Government to allow a deputation to visit them and
formerly to cede Samoa to their Government. They had sought this on account of the
aggressive acts of other nationalities. They pray the Queen to take the islands of
Samoa, and to add them to her Empire —by incorporation with New Zealand. This
petition was drawn up at first by direction of Malietoa (the nominal King) and other
chiefs, but since then Malietoa had been influenced against it chiefly by the representation
of two Americans, who greatly disliked the idea of Samoa becoming British. The
most powerful chiefs are still, however, in favour of annexation, and there is little doubt
that if the New Zealand Government sent down a steamer to bring up a deputation,
the Samoans would be found to be almost unanimous. By the latest news it would
seem that the Imperial Government are not disinclined to allow Sir George Grey’s Bill
of last session to become law, and if so, it would seem that a union with Samoa might
be easily brought about.

Public Feeling in Samoa. —The Proposals for Annexation.
“ A Resident ” sends the following communication (which we have been compelled to
hold over for some considerable time) from Samoa, relative to recent proposals for
annexation to New Zealand
Apia, Samoa.
We have observed with some surprise that from time to time the press of New
Zealand has lately published a series of articles and letters purporting to have come from
someone understanding the feeling of the Samoan natives, and expressing a strong desire
on the part of Samoans for annexation to New Zealand.
At first it was supposed that these publications, on account of their extreme improba-
bility, would meet with no regard from the well-informed public, but as the spirit which
o 15064. B


prompted them has evidently taken hold, and is obtaining considerable influence in the
Colonies, and as a further notice of a petition for annexation has arrived per last mail, it
is surely only right to inform the public of the true state of feeling here, and to contradict
the mis-statements which have so long been allowed to go unchallenged.
If there ever was a wish on the part of New Zealand to annex this group, the diplo-
matic mission to effect such annexation could not be entrusted to worse hands than those
of Mr. Lundon. And if the ruling powers of the native Samoans have been possessed
of a similar desire, the visit of Mr. Lundon has caused a complete revulsion. In fact the
result of his conduct and actions here, and writings in the Colonies, have been an
alienation of the confidence and respect of the natives and foreigners, and loss of dignity
to resident Britishers.
There never has been a bond fide petition by Samoans of any influence or standing
here to be annexed to New Zealand. Mr. Lundon certainly did go round here with a
petition form, which would be impertinent were it not silly. I cannot say that he got no
signatures, for I believe he did get some, and if he had had more dollars to give away he
would have obtained many more ; for, for one piece of silver each many signatures can
be procured from Samoan’s chiefs, and those of lower degree, though perhaps not
carrying much influence. Mr. Lundon, however, only visited two places during his
short stay in Samoa, so that if he had got more signatures, they would not be
representative.
Mr. Lundon’s representations have met with more attention from readers than they
otherwise would, on account of the good understanding which apparently exists between
him and the King and the Government of Samoa. That there is really no such friend-
ship is perfectly well known here. The King has twice complained to the British
Consul here in writing, of the “ importunities of a man named Lundon,” who insisted on
paying visits to the Government, and bothering them with annexation schemes and other
matters, to the disturbance of the Government, and asked the Consul to prevent him
from continuing such visits. Again, the King and Government refused to accept a
dinner which was offered them by Mr. Lundon, and this with a Samoan means a good
deal, as the reasons must be very solid which will prevent him accepting anjr invitations
to kaikai. The King further requested the British Consul to remove Mr. Lundon from
Samoa, on account of disturbing the people by improper speeches. I hope the two
foregoing facts will be sufficient to show that Mr. Lundon has not got the importance
here that he pretends to possess ; if not, more can be given to prove that by the common
people here he is held in ridicule and contempt.
The last of your-publications which arrived here is the “ Auckland Weekly News ” of
January 26, in which appears a copy of a petition drawn up by King Malietoa’s direction,
praying Her Majesty to add Samoa to her Empire by incorporation with New Zealand.
I am afraid that this copy has been taken from no original, for Malietoa distinctly denies
having directed such a petition, and no other Samoan, so far as I have been able to find
out, knows anything about it.
In connexion with this, I may mention that a “ malaga ” or travelling party of 300
people from Atu —an important political district—came here on the 11th of March last,
to ask the King whether it was true that he had given away the country to New Zealand,
as they had heard that it was commonly believed that New Zealand wanted to take
Samoa, an action they would protest against. This demonstration was the result of
false reports, and a contortion of the publications of colonial newspapers, but it evidently
shows that the spirit of Samoans is the reverse of what it is represented to be in the
colonies. The Samoans are certainly not in favour of annexation to New Zealand,
'though they may have a wish for British annexation. They at one time did petition
Great Britain to -annex them, but it must be remembered that they, about the same
time, conferred the same honour on Germany and the United States of America.
Before I finish, I beg to refer to an article which appeared in your paper of December
7th. Of this article there is nothing true, except that the Government received
Mr. Lundon, and that some of them would like to visit New Zealand, as they have
visited Fiji and America, if they are brought for nothing .and get well entertained as
regards creature comforts during their journey, as they have unlimited leisure and are
fond of travelling. It is not true that France will take Samoa, as it is impossible owing
to native treaties of this kingdom with Britain, Germany, and America, but it is also not
true that there is an ill-feeling between the French Government and the French priests
here, as the French Government puts a man-o’-war at the disposal of the Samoan Bishop,


to facilitate his visiting the different stations in his diocese for some months each year.
All the members of the Samoan Government have never yet met together, and none of
them know anything of Sir George Grey’s resolutions. It is needless at present to enter
into every point of Mr. Lundon’s statements, but I must repeat that he has wilfully
misrepresented the state of feeling in Samoa on the question of annexation.

therein, I have to-day addressed the enclosed note to Count dc Hatzfeldt in the terms of

M. le Secretaire d’Etat, British Embassy, Berlin, September 19, 1884.
As your Excellency is doubtless aware, verbal communications have recently
passed between Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and His
Majesty’s Ambassador at the Court of St. James with reference to the desire of the
Imperial Government to come to a friendly understanding with the Government of the
Queen as to the protection of British and German subjects in the South Sea Archipelago,
and as to the limits of the islands and territories in those regions over which either country
might seek to extend its interests and influence.
On that occasion his Excellency Count Munster observed that there were parts of
the wild country on the north side of New Guinea which might be available as a field for
German enterprise, and Earl Granville informed the Ambassador that the extension of
British authority in New Guinea, which would be shortly announced, would only embrace
that part of the island which specially interests the Australian colonists, without prejudice
to any territorial questions beyond those limits.
The result of the communications which have lately been going on between the Home
and Colonial Governments is that Her Majesty’s Government now propose to proclaim
and establish the Queen’s prerogative over all the coasts of New Guinea not occupied by
the Netherlands Government, except that portion of the north coast comprised between
the 145th degree of east longitude and the Eastern Dutch Boundary.
The British Protectorate will also include the small islands immediately adjacent to
those portions of the coast over which it is established.
The 145th degree of east longitude has been fixed as the Western British limit on
the northern coast, in order that it should embrace the territory owned by the natives
on the Maclay Coast, whose claim for British protection has long been under the
consideration of Her Majesty’s Government, and was one of the principal reasons which
determined the Cabinet to advise the Queen to assume the responsibility of establishing
a protectorate in New Guinea.

The Maclay Coast extends to the southward as far as Cape King William, where
commences that part of the coast extending to the Dutch Southern Boundary which for
obvious reasons it is indispensable to bring under British control.
In making to your Excellency this communication, I am instructed by Earl Granville
to add that Her Majesty’s Government have been actuated by their earnest desire to
promote the friendly understanding which the Government of the Emperor have proposed
to establish with reference to these territorial questions,

I am directed by Earl Granville to transmit to -you, for the information of the
Earl of Derby, and for any observations which he may wish to make thereupon, a
translation of a note from the German Charge d’Affaires at this Court, containing some
observations which he has been instructed by his Government to make in reply to the
announcement of the intended Protectorate by Her Majesty’s Government of a portion
of the coast of New Guinea, which Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Berlin had made
in obedience to the instruction from this Office, the draft of which was enclosed in my

My Lord, German Embassy, September 27, 1884.
According to a communication of the Foreign Office of the German Empire, the
British Charge d’Affaires in Berlin has addressed a communication to it under date of
the 17th of the month, from which it appears that Her Majesty’s Government intend to
place under British protection all the coasts of New Guinea which are not occupied by
Holland, with the single exception of that part of the North coast which lies between
the 145° of East longitude and the eastern boundary of the Netherlands possessions.
The small islands in the immediate neighbourhood of the strip of coast to be placed under
British protection are to be included.
According to instructions, I have the honour, in reply to this, to inform your
Excellency that the Imperial Government has taken cognizance with thanks of the
contents of the communication referred to, but that the projected extension of the
British protectorate in the north and north-east of New Guinea, after the previous
declarations of your Excellency, comes unexpectedly to the Imperial Government, and
they wish temporarily to reserve to themselves the adoption of any attitude on the
subject.
According to the conception of the Imperial Government, the delimitation of the
areas which interest both sides on that stretch of coast should be the subject of a friendly
understanding by means of a commission.

With reference to the Note which I had the honour to address to his Excellency

Government propose to proclaim over part of the coast of New Guinea, I am now
instructed by Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to state to
the Imperial Government that Her Majesty’s Government have carefully considered the
communication which Baron Plessen was instructed to make on the proposed limit of
this Protectorate, and have decided that the declaration to be made shall limit the British
Protectorate to the whole of the south coast, including the islands contiguous to it,
instead of that which they had at first proposed.
This will be done without prejudice to any territorial question beyond these limits.
It is with great satisfaction that Her Majesty’s Government have come to an arrange-
ment in which they find themselves in perfect accord with Germany.
In case any questions should arise as to those districts which lie beyond the limits
described, Her Majesty’s Government are of opinion that it would be better to deal
with them diplomatically than to refer them to the Commission which it is proposed to
appoint with regard to the islands of the Pacific.

With reference to my letter of the 18th instant,* I am directed by Earl Granville

called at this office on the 15th instant, and made a verbal communication to the

““ The Imperial Government take note with satisfaction of the declaration contained in
Mr. Scott’s note of the 10th ultimo respecting the limits of the British Protectorate in
New Guinea, and are glad that Her Britannic Majesty’s Government are in accord with

They are willing to meet the wish expressed in Lord Granville’s private letter to
Baron Plessen of September 25th, that the meetings of the Commission to consider certain
other points connected with the South Sea should take place in Europe.
The Imperial German Consul-General at Sydney, Dr. Krauel, who is specially
conversant with South Sea affairs, and who has been selected as the German Com-
missioner, has consequently been instructed by telegraph to proceed to Europe, and
accordingly embarked at Sydney on the 7th instant.
As Dr. Krauel has also been named German Commissioner for the proposed investi-
gation of the land claims of German subjects in Fiji, the Imperial Government wishes, and
possibly it may likewise appear desirable to Her Majesty’s Government, that the delibera-
tions of the Fiji Commission should also take place, in the first instance, in Europe. The
Imperial Government are of opinion that London would be a proper place for discussing
both subjects, and that any subsequent inquiries that might be needed on the spot could
be made either by Dr. Krauel on his return to Australia, or by some other German official

for giving effect to the Resolutions of the Convention in any other manner that to Her
Majesty may appear preferable.
2. I take the opportunity of mentioning that in one point the Draft Bill requires an
amendment in the interest of Fiji. I refer to the provision of section 26, under which
the contributions of the Colonies are to be in proportion to population.
3. Under this provision the contribution of Fiji would be unfairly large if the Native
population should be taken into account, and too small if it had sole reference to the
white inhabitants. Probably the .proportion of the revenue to that of the other
Australasian Colonies would be the fairest means of determining the contribution of
Fiji.

(Received November 4, 1884.)
My Lord, Sydney, September 22, 1884.
I have the honour to enclose copy of a letter I received from Commodore
Erskine requesting information concerning a certain vessel which had sailed from this
port under German colours, ostensibly for the Phoenix Islands, having a large mixed
cargo of merchandise and a German professor.
2. I obtained from Mr. Stuart the necessary information, copies of which are herewith
enclosed, and forwarded it to the Commodore.
3. Although certain circumstances gave an air of suspicion to the vessel, I believe
that no further object can he attributed to it than a commercial venture, probably
instigated by Prince Bismarck’s late declaration of giving Imperial protection to
German subjects wherever established in trade, and it may be the commencement of
German trading centres in the Pacific Islands,
4. I have the honour to annex an interesting article from the “ Sydney Herald ” on
German policy in the Pacific.

Commodore Erskine to Lord Augustus Loftus.
My dear Lord Augustus, Carthina, September 17, 1884.
I have just heard disquieting rumours regarding a certain steamer named the
“ Samoa,” which left Sydney a few days ago under German colours, ostensibly for
the Phoenix group. lam told she is oivned by one Dr. Trench, a German naturalist,
and that she had on board a larger cargo of trade than could be required for the
purposes of natural history and the skinning of birds ! !
My informant believes that she has gone to establish a German settlement in one of
the Pacific Islands, probably the Solomons, in the interests of a syndicate, who proposes
to carry out the policy indicated by Prince Bismarck and to force the hand of the
German Government by starting such a company as the Borneo Company, and
extending German influence in the islands of the West Pacific.
Do you know anything about this vessel ?
I think it Avould be well to make inquiries, as her movements are certainly surrounded
Avith suspicion.
I am, &c.

Dear Mr. Stuart, September 17, 1884.
I have received information of a rather suspicious nature in regard to the
departure from Sydney, a feAV days ago, of a steamer named “ Samoa ” (she is said
to have another name previously to taking that of “ Samoa,”) ostensibly for the Phoenix
Islands. lam told she is owned by a Dr. Trench, a German naturalist, and that she
had on board a larger cargo of trade than could be required for . the purposes of natural
history or scientific objects. She is sailing under German colours, and it is suspected
0 2


that she has gone to establish a German Settlement in one of the Pacific Islands,
probably the Solomons, in the interests of a syndicate which proposes to carry out the
policy indicated lately by Prince Bismarck in his speeches, and to force the hand of the
German Government by starting such a company as the Borneo Company' with a view
to extending German influence in the islands of the Western Pacific.
It would be well to have inquiries made in regard to this vessel as her movements
appear to be surrounded with suspicion.
Will yon kindly procure for me all the information you can and as soon as possible.
Very truly yours,

Sir, Custom House, Sydney, September 19, 1884.
I have the honour to forward herewith information relating to the loading and
clearance of the foreign-owned steam vessel “ Samoa ” for Phoenix Island.
The vessel in question was British owned as the “ Sophia Ann,” and on the 11th
July was sold to a German subject, and the British certificate of registry returned
and cancelled as required by law.
I also forward copies of the usual clearance documents, viz.:—
Clearance certificate from the German Consulate.
Passenger list.
Manifest of cargo.
The cargo is of the character usually carried by island traders, and the vessel is, I
believe, intended for use between the various South Sea Island stations established by
the owners.

Enclosure 4 in No, 28.
German Policy in the Pacific.
We are informed by a recent cablegram that a resolution was passed in the Cape
Parliament in July last to the effect that it would be expedient for the Imperial
Government to annex that portion of territory on the south-west coast of Africa just
recently annexed by Germany. The Imperial Government, however, did not accede
to the request of the colonists, and now the Germans have quietly appropriated the
country which the colonists deemed necessary for their safety and development. We
sympathise with the Cape Parliament to-day, but it is more than likely that we shall
at no very distant date be sharers with them of their disappointment and sorrow. We
have no wish to establish anything like the Munroe doctrine with regard to our rights
in the Pacific, nor do we object to any legitimate and responsible colonisation of any
of the Pacific groups by any civilised Power; but we think the people of these Colonies
will most decidedly object to the policy foreshadowed by Prince Bismarck’s address
some time ago, and confirmed in recent action, which, under the pretext of “ protecting ”
the interests of any German trading firms, virtually seeks to prevent any colonisation or
responsible government by any other Power. The policy of the German Chancellor at
present seems to be, not to form Colonies, which will involve the German Government
in responsibility and expense for maintenance and good government, but to prevent
other nations from doing so whose interests are most directly concerned. The claims
or trading rights of some German trading firms, however small and insignificant, are to
be put forward as barriers to the annexation of any areas wherein these claims exist.


It is at once apparent that such pretensions, if allowed, would be extremely embarrassing
to any Government; that they may be made to cover a very extensive area, and that,
in fact, they may virtually prevent annexation or the assumption of jurisdiction over
any of the Pacific groups. The remarks which were made by the Chancellor referred
primarily to the recently acquired Angra Pequena; but it is not difficult to see that the
principle is especially intended to apply to the Pacific, and it is here that we are directly
concerned and affected. We may not be ripe for federation at present, but few, if any,
will question the assertion that it will be accomplished at no very distant date. It will
then be a matter of the greatest importance that Australian interests and influence
predominate in all those large groups which lie so close to our shores. But if the
present dimly foreshadowed policy of the Chancellor be carried out, this will scarcely
be possible. If the policy which has obtained in Samoa, for example, be carried out in
the savage islands of the Western Pacific, the consequences must be much more
disastrous than they have been in that group. How r ever imperfectly Samoan chiefs
may govern, they have at all events some considerable influence and power over the
whole of the people, a condition which does not obtain in the Western Pacific. Had
Germany annexed Samoa years ago, and assumed all the responsibilities of directing
the government and enforcing order, it would no doubt have been the better for the
world and for the Samoans themselves; but the German Government has always refused
to take such a step, whilst it has at the same time also objected to any other Power
annexing the group, because German interests are so much involved there. The con-
sequences arc that Samoa is still without a Government which is worthy of the name;
—that large numbers of the people have been killed in the constant inter-tribal w r ars,
which might all have been easily prevented years ago by any European Government;
—that the lands of the people have passed into the hands of the German firms in
exchange principally for rifles and ammunition, with which the foolish natives can fight
each other, and the whole development and trade of the group is etfectually prevented
or hindered. This policy may probably suit the German people, and, so far as Samoa
is concerned, we cannot now interfere ; but it most certainly will not suit the Australia
of the future if such a policy is carried out in the Western Pacific groups, and we may
at once face the fact that such a policy is already begun. A correspondent of the
“ Auckland Weekly News,” writing from London lately, says, with regard to German
feeling on this matter, “ It is very evident that a bold policy of colonisation finds favour,
“ not only in popular circles, but also amongst the moneyed classes, who are quite willing
“to find the sinews of Avar. An influential syndicate of Berlin and Hamburg financiers
“ are prepared to establish a colonial bank to facilitate colonial enterprises, and it Avas
“ alleged in the Reichstag a few days since that German bankers had purchased the
“ Samoan Plantation Company’s shares and also intended to establish ‘ several grand
“ Colonies in New Guinea.’ The group of capitalists included Baron Hausemann, of
“ Berlin, and Messrs. Ohlendorff and Godeffroy, of Hamburg. Negotiations Avere opened
“ Avith the firm of Herren Hernsheim, who own extensive properties in the South Seas.
“ They submitted a scheme of operations to the syndicate, who thereupon announced
“ their intention to act independently. The Messrs. Hernsheim, irritated at these
“ tactics, exposed the Avhole scheme, which the other parties to it now seem inclined to
“ repudiate altogether.” - The agitation in favour of Bismarck’s scheme for subsidising
a line of Australian mail steamers is increasing in intensity, and threatens to become
sufficiently pronounced to overcome the scruples of the Reichstag, which will probably
sanction the vote next session. The Chancellor, Avith characteristic bluntness, has
intimated that, in seeking to establish a mail service in the Pacific, he has £ * other irons
in the fire ” besides the carriage of mails. What they are may be readily conjectured.
Now it may at once be granted that if this scheme means the assumption of jurisdiction
over any Western Pacific Group, which is as yet unclaimed by us or any other PoAver,
and the consequent assumption of responsibility and the maintenance of order there, we
cannot resent or effectually oppose the action, hoAvever much avc may deplore the
inaction of the Imperial Government or their refusal to take action on our behalf. But
it is extremely likely that the so-called colonisation policy of Germany is not colonisation
at all, and that the simple effect of it, so far as these Colonies are concerned, will be to
prevent any jurisdiction over the island bj r the Imperial Government which will affect
the interests of German firms. Let us hoav examine how this will affect the natives,
and with Samoa before us as an example, we may say that the natives will get full
liberty to fight and kill each other as hitherto, and that in exchange for their lands they
Avill be supplied first Avith Tovver muskets, then Avith Sniders and Winchester rifles, and
any other modern appliance for destroying life Avhich they may desire, that they may
C 3


more effectually carry on their warlike operations. In the Western Pacific, as in Samoa,
this fighting would in time become a nuisance to the trading interests, and then the
people would probably be told, “ You must not fight any more, or we will fight you.”
The natives might not unnaturally say, as they do in Samoa to-day, “ Why, you have
“ taken our lands and our cocoa-nuts for guns and powder, and rifles and bullets, made
“ expressly for us to fight with, and now, after you have got our lands and property,
“ you won’t let us use on each other the guns for which we parted with them.” The
Samoans may object; but they have to submit, because Samoans are easily got at by a
man-of-war, and they are also under the direction of their chiefs; but it would not* be
so easy to manage matters thus in the Western Pacific, though there may be no very
formidable combined opposition in any of these groups. This so-called policy is, in
fact, a most selfish one, and one which in no way whatever protects the rights of the
natives themselves, whilst its effects on these Colonies would be very serious indeed.
To mention but a few. If we cannot assume any jurisdiction over any of these groups
simply because sortie German trading firm has set up an establishment there, then, of
course, we can exercise no authority over German subjects or over subjects of any other
foreign Power. Any Englishman residing there will be compelled to obey every order
issued by the High Commissioner, but a foreigner can smile at them all. A British
trader cannot sell a percussion cap, but a German may sell Winchester rifles, with
which the Britishers may be shot. A British vessel must return to Sydney r in ballast,
whilst the foreign flag is flying over full cargoes, because the master or supercargo dare
not carry the trade which the natives require before they will sell their copra. If all
alike are prohibited from selling guns, the British trader could not complain, but at
present it is not so, and unless we adopt some other plans than those which Lord Derby
appears to favour, there is no probability of the present injustice being removed.
The labour traffic regulation or suppression will also be seriously affected by this policy.
If no jurisdiction is assumed over those groups, the labour traffic cannot possibly be
regulated as sugar planters desire it to be. If any regulations to be worked from these
Colonies can be framed which will effectually prevent the abuses of the traffic in the
islands, those regulations, if faithfully carried out, will virtually suppress it altogether.
Whether or not the traffic can be so regulated in the islands if jurisdiction be assumed
there as to protect the interests of the natives, and also provide cheap labour for
Queensland and Eiji, is a moot point which I do not now discuss ; but 1 feel very certain
that if this “ German interests” policy is to prevent the assumption of jurisdiction over
these islands, the British traders who do business in these waters will continue to feel
the effects of outrages committed by labour-vessels, even though the traffic be entirely
abolished in these Colonies and Eiji. The Imperial Government may declare the traffic
to be illegal, or the Queensland Government may so hamper it by regulations as to make
it impossible ; but unless we have some jurisdiction in the islands we cannot prevent the
natives from being taken to Samoa or to New Caledonia. The planters in Fiji and
Queensland may be injured or ruined, but the natives will not be benefited, and British
traders will still have to suffer for the wrong-doings of those who have preceded them.
We shall have the usual tales of massacres on the honest trader or the passing ship;
and though our ships of war may punish the natives if they can get near enough, we
shall - not be able to examine, much less to punish, those whose actions in the first place
may have caused the outrage. The same complications will also affect the residents
who follow legitimate trade in the several groups, A German planter in the Solomons,
“ protected ” by the Chancellor’s policy, can emploj' as many natives on his plantation
as he pleases. He can send his schooner to a neighbouring group, and fill her with
any number of men whom he can induce to engage; but his next-door neighbour, the
British planter, will have his license taken away, and his vessel seized, and himself made
prisoner, if he should dare to work his plantation on the same lines.
The land question, also, will be another source of trouble in the not very distant
future. I hold it to be absolutely certain that those Western Groups must be annexed
in some form or other by Australia, or by some of .the Great Powers of Europe.
They can never form a Government of their own, and from their proximity to Australia
they cannot be allowed to remain in their present savage condition. The longer this
step is deferred the greater will be the difficulties connected with it. All land-buying
is at present forbidden by the High Commissioner and by Colonial Legislatures, so that
no British subject can acquire land irom the natives. This is, undoubtedly, just and
right; but there is no law to prevent any foreign subject from effecting a so-called
purchase from any native who may profess to be the owner of the island or block of
land which the white man may desire, and in the aftertime some deeds carefully signed


and sealed will be produced as constituting a good and valid title to the land. Cine of
the last letters from the Fiji correspondent noticed the issue of a Blue Book by
Mr. Govens there, containing a correspondence with Prince Bismarck, in which the
Chancellor demands, in no uncertain manner, that some lands claimed by German
subjects which were purchased prior to the annexation of the group, but the titles to
which were disallowed by the Land Court, shall be allowed and confirmed. If ihis
demand be complied with, the precedent will of course be acted upon by all other
foreigners who have disallowed claims, and only British subjects who have disallowed land
claims in Fiji will suffer. The longer we delay the assumption of jurisdiction-fin some
way or other over these groups the longer will be the list of difficulties we shall have
to encounter. The respective Colonies have cheerfully agreed to the payment of the :
15,000/. which Lord Derby demanded from us, but no definite action has as yet been
taken. It is quite apparent that the Imperial Government is not anxious to increase its
responsibilities in the Pacific, and there is ho doubt a large party in England -who are
decidedly opposed to any further extension of territory, or to any further assumption of
jurisdiction, over savage tribes. This may be excusable in England, but it is simply
incomprehensible to those who know the islands well, that so little apparent interest
should be taken by the people of New South Wales in the settlement of a question
which so vitally concerns the development and well-being of the Australia of the
future.

(Received November 4, 1884.)
My Lord, Sydney, September 22, 1884.
I have the honour to enclose to your Lordship herewith copy of a correspondence
between Mr, Service, the Victorian Premier, and Mr. Stuart, on the question of addressing
a further appeal to Her Majesty’s Government to establish a Protectorate over the
unappropriated islands of the Pacific as well as over the whole of New Guinea.
2. Your Lordship will observe that Mr. Stuart in his reply does not concur in the
views of the Victorian Premier, and considers that however urgent may be the question
of New Guinea, a further pressure at this moment would be open to an imputation ol
restlessness and impatience, and he adds that he is unable to join with him in urging
such a departure from the resolution of the Convention as to agitate for a' complete
Protectorate over ail unappropriated islands.
3. Mr. Stuart suggests, as a more judicious course than that proposed by Mr. Service,
that the “ Imperial Government should unite with other European Governments in
“ coming to an understanding that none of these islands outside New Guinea should be
“ taken directly or indirectly by any one Power, but the inhabitants of all nations should
“ be permitted the right of trade and communication with all, and that such trading
“ should be under the joint protection of the nations.”
4. These views of Mr. Stuart coincide entirely with the opinions which I have
expressed to your Lordship and to your Lordship’s predecessor.
5. I have stated that the South Seas (comprising thousands of islands) are too
extended for any one Power to control or to supervise; and that this control and super-
vision could alone be efficiently exercised by a perfect understanding between the naval
Powers of Europe, through the means of an European High Commissioner.
6. If some such general European Protectorate is not established, then will inevitably
arise continual difficulties and disputes among the Powers in regard to trading with, and
colonising, these islands, even if not in regard to their annexation.

The New Guinea and South Sea Islands Question.
The following correspondence has passed between Mr. James Service, the Premier of
Victoria, and the Honourable Alexander Stuart, on the subject of further united action on
the part of the Colonies for the establishment of a Protectorate over New Guinea and
other islands in the Pacific. On the 17th instant Mr. Stuart received the following
telegram:—
“ I invite your attention to the still unsettled and unsatisfactory condition of the
islands question. We have gained something as regards Guinea, but even that is
imperfect, leaving out, as I understand, the north-west portion. As regards other islands
the policy of delay adopted by Lord Derby simply increases the difficulty. Twelve
months ago the islands might have been ours without difficulty. Now, at any moment,
another Power may appear upon the scene. All considerations induce me to submit at
the present juncture that we make unitedly one more effort to prevail upon England to
make a complete work by establishing a Protectorate over unappropriated islands,
respecting, of course, international obligations. If you concur in this course, what 1
should suggest is that Colonies having an Agent-General should instruct by telegram
their Agents to consult and make one more united effort with Lord Derby ; or even the
premier Colonies not having an Agent-General to concur, to authorise one of the other
Colonies to speak for them in tins matter. To leave the matter where it is would be an
impotent conclusion to our efforts. But more than that we should be letting slip an
opportunity that may never recur.
“ James Service,
“ Chairman of Convention Committee.”
Two days afterwards—on the 1 9th instant —Mr. Stuart received another telegram as
follows: —
“ I send for your information the following telegram just to hand from the Premier of
New Zealand in reply to my circular telegram, of which you had copy, namely: ‘ Pacific
‘ Islands —Qnite concur; will instruct Agent-General as you suggest; telegraph me
‘ terms your cablegram to Agent-General, and we will send one in accordance.’ ”
On Saturday afternoon Mr. Stuart wrote to Mr. Service the following letter in
reply
“ Colonial Secretary’s Office, Sydney,
“ My dear Service, September 20, 1884.
“ Three days ago I received your telegram respecting the Protectorate over the
unappropriated South Sea Islands. I regret to have to inform you that Ido not concur
with the view you take of the desirability of again urging upon Lord Derby that
immediate steps be taken to extend England’s Protectorate over all these islands as well
as over the whole of New Guinea, notwithstanding the announcement in your telegram
of yesterday that New Zealand has signified its concurrence. As regards New Guinea,
I do not think it was ever contemplated by the Convention to urge a Protectorate over
the north-west portion. All that we desired to secure was that the portion not hitherto
claimed by the Netherlands, i.e., the southern and eastern portions, should be those
protected or in some way incorporated with the British Empire. This matter is, in ray
opinion, an urgent one, but I think we have done enough for the present in the way in
which we have represented this urgency. If the matter be not within a reasonable
period carried out by the Imperial Government, I am sure that this Colony will join with
you and others in reiterating the views of the Colonies, but at the present moment I
think that our doing so would be open to an imputation of restlessness and impatience, as
we know' that grave steps of this kind, wherein questions of an international character
may arise, cannot be forced as those of minor importance. But however this may be, I
find myself unable to join with you in urging such a departure from the resolution of
the Convention as to agitate for a complete protection over all unappropriated islands.
All that the Convention did, as it appears to me, was to state broadly its view that
further accession of dominion by any foreign Power over these islands would be highly
detrimental to Australia, and injurious to the British Empire. But the Convention
carefully guarded itself from dictating in any way to the Imperial Government the mode
by which such should be accomplished. Personally my own belief is that such a course
as you favour would be at the present juncture extremely injudicious, and that it
probably would be better if the Imperial Government could see its way to unite with
other European Governments in coming to an understanding that none of those islands


outside New Guinea should be taken directly or indirectly by any one Power, but that
the inhabitants of all nations should be permitted the freest trade and communication
with all, and that such trading should be under the joint protection of the nations. I
can conceive no time more unsuitable than the present, when the watchful, and it may be
in some degree the jealous, eye of foreign nations is forced on these islands, for any
such distinctly assertive act as you suggest being taken by Great Britain, and I do not
see that we would be acting a truly loyal part to the Empire if we were to urge her to
assume a position of embarrassment which would be likely to provoke the hostility of
foreign nations. Nor do I think such a course would hasten that which we really do
want and which alone the Convention urged, viz., a Protectorate over the south-eastern
portion of New Guinea, and a friendly arrangement with other Powers as to the non-
interference with the South Sea Islands other than is involved in the regulation of the
trade therewith by mutual arrangement. In putting forth these views I beg to assure
you that I am not actuated by any wish to stand aloof from co-operation with your or
any other Colony, but solely from a desire to look upon the question in the broad light
of what is most likely to accomplish the object we have at heart, and to do that
effectively but with the least embarrassment to the interests of the whole Empire,

Proceedings have given pleasure to the natives, who place themselves with confidence
under Her Majesty’s protection. Am about to proceed to the eastern ports. The
mission will, I hope, be completed to enable me to leave New Guinea about the 27th for

COLONIAL OFFICE to Major-General P. H. SCRATCHLEY, C.M.G.
Sir, Downing Street, November 17, 1884.
You are aware that steps have been taken to proclaim Her Majesty’s Protectorate
and jurisdiction over the southern shore of New Guinea and. the country adjacent
thereto, from the 141st meridian of east longitude eastward, as far as East Cape, including
any island adjacent to the mainland in Goschen Straits, and to the southward, of the said
Straits as far south and. east as to include Kosman Island.
2. I am now directed by the Earl of Derby to inform you that Her Majesty has been
pleased to appoint you to be her Special Commissioner, to exercise her authority within
this Protectorate, and that the necessary Commission will shortly be transmitted
to you.
3. Until Her Majesty shall be pleased to make further provision for administering
law in the Protectorate, that territory, as well as all other parts of New Guinea up to the
143° east longitude, remain under the operation of the Western Pacific Orders in Council;
it is, therefore, necessary that you should be enabled to exercise the authority which is
vested by those Orders in the deputies of the High Commissioner, and Sir William Des
Yoeux has been instructed to forward to the care of the Governor of New South Wales an
instrument appointing you to be a Deputy Commissioner. As it is proposed to place a
steamer at your disposal for the duties of the Protectorate, you will have more ready
means of access to the islands near New r Guinea than are at the command of the High
Commissioner, and it has accordingly been decided that your powers as Deputy Com-
missioner shall extend to the islands lying to the north of latitude 15° south, and to the
west of longitude 100° east, and for so much of the Solomon Islands as lies beyond those
limits. Copies of the Western Pacific Orders in Council of 1877, 1879, and 1880 are
forwarded herewith.*
4. ,You will, however, be independent of the High Commissioner in respect to the
Protectorate, and will correspond direct with the Secretarj 7 of State for the Colonies as
regards matters occurring beyond the Protectorate; but within the limits assigned to you
as Deputy Commissioner you will act on your own discretion, without referring to the
High Commissioner for instructions; but you should, as far as practicable, inform him of
your proceedings.
5. The Australian Colonies have agreed to provide 15,000/. during the year
ending June 1, 1885, for the expenses of the Protectorate, and upon your arrival in
Australia you will ascertain by communication with the several Governments whether
the Colonies will provide in subsequent years a sum adequate to the due maintenance
of the Protectorate, as it is clearly understood that the Protectorate is established at the
desire of the Colonies, and is not to be a source of expense to this country. You will,
therefore, fully understand that you are not to contemplate or to incur any expense in
New Guinea for providing buildings for yourself or your officers until the wishes of the
Colonies as to the continuance of the Protectorate have been ascertained, and the
necessary funds provided.
6. Upon your arrival in New Guinea j t ou will place yourself in communication with
Mr. Romilly, a Deputy Commissioner of the Western Pacific, who has been placed in
temporary charge of the Protectorate pending your arrival, and will take over the charge
from him.
7. You will be supplied in Sydney with a copy of the instructions given to him by
the Commodore when leaving him in charge,
8. It is not possible for Lord Derby, with the limited information which he possesses
as to the circumstances of the country, to now give you instructions in detail respecting
the duties which you will have to perform as Special Commissioner. You should proceed
to make yourself acquainted with the country, its harbours and general features ; and you
should lose no time in entering into friendly relations with the natives, and in endeavouring
by all means in your power to inspire their confidence, and acquire their goodwill.
9. You will especially make it your duty to explain to them that Her Majesty, in
taking them under her protection, has their welfare in view, and that you are sent to
secure to them the safety of their persons, the enjoyment of their property, and
particularly to protect them from being deprived of their lands by force or fraud. At
the same time you will make it known to them that if it shall be decided to allow Her
Majesty’s subjects or others to purchase land, such transactions must in every case be
conducted through you ; that their wishes in these matters will be respected, and that
* Not printed.
D 3


the purchase money will be paid through you to them, unless in any case it shall appear
desirable to apply it in their behalf for some object in which they are directly interested.
You will also explain carefully, and satisfy yourself that they comprehend, that by the
sale of land they deprive themselves of all further claim to it, and that it becomes the
absolute property of the purchasers. In the event of any such purchases being made, it
will be your duty to see that both parties agree as to the boundaries of the land, and
that these boundaries are defined by beacons or other easily recognisable marks. All
such transfers should be carefully recorded in a register, and all subsequent transactions
must be similarly recorded, or they will not be recognized by Her Majesty’s Government.
10. You should give all proper encouragement to peaceful and legitimate trade between
the natives and persons who may visit the Protectorate; and in this, and in other matters,
you will, doubtless, receive willing and efficient aid from the missionaries who have settled
in New Guinea, and established a friendly intercourse with the natives.
11. It will, however, be your duty to prohibit all dealings with the natives in arms or
ammunition, explosive substances, or spirituous liquors, and to enforce by all means in
your power the regulation issued by the High Commissioner on the sth of April 1884,
to prohibit the supply of arms, ammunition, and explosive substances to natives of the
Western Pacific Islands ; a copy of this regulation is enclosed.
12. It is probable that attempts may be made to engage labourers for Queensland, and,
possibly, other places, from among the natives in the Protectorate; and should such
attempts be made, it will be your duty to place every lawful obstacle in their way.
Natives from New Britain and other islands near the Equator have proved not to possess the
physique required for continuous labour, and heavy mortality followed their introduction
into Queensland. The Government of that Colony have, in consequence, prohibited their
further engagement by vessels sailing from Queensland ports. It will be your duty
to second these praiseworthy efforts of the Colonial Government, and to prevent the
recruiting of natives of the Protectorate for employment away from their own country.
13. Power is given to you by your Commission to appoint such necessary officers as
you may think expedient; but at present you should make no other appointments than
of an officer to give you general assistance, and of a private secretary. You are at
liberty to appoint Mr. Romilly to the former of those two positions; the experience he
already possesses of affairs in New Guinea and its neighbourhood should prove of value
to you, and as he is a Deputy Commissioner for the Western Pacific, you will be able to
utilize his services within the Protectorate or beyond it, should you find it advisable to
detach him for services to which you cannot personally attend; it being intended that in
both capacities he should act under your immediate instructions.
14. After your arrival in Australia you should report to me whether you find other
officers indispensable, and you will be at liberty to engage such as appear to you
absolutely necessary, bearing in mind that the funds provided by the Colonies must not
in any event be exceeded.
15. It is also desirable that you should as soon as possible after arrival report what
arrangements you will be able to make for locomotion, and for keeping up communication
with the Colonies and with England. You are, doubtless, aware that mail steamers run
regularly through Torres Straits, calling both ways at Thursday Island.
I am, &c.

No. 43.
The RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF DERBY, K.G., to ACTING HIGH COMMISSONER
SIR G. W. DES VCEOX (WESTERN PACIFIC).
Sm, Downing Street, November 17, 1884.
I requested you by telegram* on the Ist instant, to appoint Major-General Peter
Henry Scratchley, R.E., C.M.G., to be Deputy Commissioner for the Western Pacific for
the district north of latitude 15° south, and to the west of longitude 160° east, and also
for so much of the Solomon Islands as lies beyond those limits.
I have now to transmit to you a copy of a letter}* which I caused to be addressed to
the Admiralty, from which you will observe that Her Majesty’s Government had decided
that the establishment of Her Majesty’s Protectorate over the portion of New Guinea
lying along the south coast from the 141° east longitude eastward, as far as East Cape,
including any islands adjacent to the mainland in Goschen Straits, and to the southward
of the said Straits as far south and east as to include Kosman Island, should be
proclaimed. The Commodore has been instructed to carry this decision into effect, and
I have to inform you that Her Majesty’s Government have selected Major-General
Scratchley to be Special Commissioner for that Protectorate.
2. The territory comprised in the Protectorate will, until other arrangements are made,
continue to be within the operation of the Western Pacific Orders in Council; and as
General Scratchley will not, by virtue of his appointment as Special Commissioner, be
possessed of legal jurisdiction, unless Her Majesty should issue some further Order in
Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, relating especially to New Guinea, it is
obviously convenient that he should possess the powers of a Deputy Commissioner. It
is proposed to provide him with a steamer for his duties in the Protectorate, and as he
will thus have more ready means of access to the parts of New Guinea beyond the
Protectorate and to the islands near to New Guinea than are at your command, I thought
it advisable to extend his powers as Deputy Commissioner to the islands within the
above-mentioned limits. Major-General Scratchley will leave this country to take up
his duties in New Guinea about the 20th of this month, and it was therefore necessary
to telegraph to you in order that the requisite instrument might reach him without loss
of time.
3. It is necessary that General Scratchley should act quite independently in matters
arising within the Protectorate, and as it would manifestly be impracticable for him to
refer to you for instructions in all cases, when he may find it necessary to put in force
his powers elsewhere as Deputy Commissioner, I propose to instruct him to act upon his
own discretion in matters arising under the Western Pacific Orders in Council, but to
inform you of any action which he may take, and of which it is proper that you should
be informed. I shall continue, whenever practicable, to conduct through you all
correspondence relating to the area beyond the Protectorate, but comprised in Major-
General Scratchley’s Deputy Commissionership, unless for any reason it may appear
necessary to write to him direct.
4. In making these arrangements, I have not been unmindful of the continuous labour
which has been imposed upon you by your careful and vigilant performance of your
duties in connexion with the Western Pacific High Commission, and I trust that, while
I shall still receive the benefit of your advice on all questions relating to the South Seas,
you will by these arrangements be relieved of some of the labour and care which at
present devolves upon you.
5. It is intended that Mr. H. H. Romilly shall serve under General Scratchley in the
Protectorate, and as he may probably be detached occasionally for duties elsewhere
under the Western Pacific Orders in Council, it is desirable that he should retain his
position as Deputy Commissioner, acting in this capacity also under the orders of
General Scratchley, and reporting to him.
6. I also propose to take an early opportunity of considering the provisions of the
Orders in Council in reference to the powers of Deputy Commissioners, and shall in that
case address you further on that subject.
I have, &c.

I have requested General Scratchley to communicate on his arrival in Australia with
the Governments of as many of the Colonies as he may be able to visit before his
departure for New Guinea, which, of course, cannot be long delayed ; and it is desirable
that he should ascertain, at as early a date as possible, what provision the Colonies are

2. I am now directed by the Earl of Derby to acquaint you that the Queen has

My Lord, Berlin, December 1, 1884.
I have the honour to report that Prince Bismarck told me to day, in the course
of conversation, that he had received a telegram from the German Consul at Samoa, to
the'effect that the King was endeavouring to obtain for that island British Protectorate.
The Chancellor said that this step would create a very bad effect in this country, as
the Germans had for some years past been interested in the island, and the Reichstag
had already had before it for consideration the question of a subsidy to a Hamburgh
house trading with Samoa. The Prince added that he trusted that I should be able to
give him an assurance that Her Majesty’s Government had no intention of annexing the
island.
I am informed by Mr. Meade that there are apprehensions in New Zealand that the
Imperial German Government may, sooner or later, annex both Samoa and Tonga.


Will your Lordship authorise me to state to Prince Bismarck that Her Majesty’s
Government will give positive assurances that the independence of both places will be
respected by them, provided that reciprocal assurances are made to the Queen’s
Government by that of His Majesty the Emperor ?
I have, &c.

Sir, Downing Street, December 5, 1884.
With reference to my telegram of the 2nd instant,* informing you that the Chiefs
in the Protected Territory of New Guinea had begged that natives taken to Queensland
might be returned to their homes, I have the honour to transmit to jou a copy of a
letter from the Rev. W. G. Lawes, which appears in the “ Times ” of to-day.
The charges made in this letter are of a very grave character, and as the name of
the vessel implicated is given, there should be no difficulty in prosecuting an effective
inquiry into the case.
I request that you will bring this matter before your Ministers, with the expression of
my hope that, in the event of Mr. Lawes’ assertions proving to be well founded, they
will be able to take measures, not only for bringing the offending parties to justice, but
also fcr returning to their homes the natives thus fraudulently recruited.
I have, &c.

Enclosure in No. SQ.
Extract from the “ Times, ” December 5, 1884.
New Guinea.
We have been favoured with the following letter, written by the Rev. W. G. Lawes
from New Guinea to a friend in England :
“ Port Moresby, New Guinea,
“ September 15, 1884.
“ Dear Mr. , I take the liberty of troubling you again with a letter in the
interests of the aborigines of this land. I do so, knowing how gladly you will do any-
thing you can—
‘ For the right that wants assistance
‘ ’Gainst the wrong that needs resistance.’
“ You are aware that some Queensland vessels have been ‘ recruiting ’ (as they call
it) at the east end of New Guinea. In ‘ The Times ’ Parliamentary Summary for
June 17, I see Mr. Redmond asked a question in the House respecting the reported
doings of the ‘ Ceara.’
“Reports of the irregular proceedings of these vessels led the Queensland Government
to issue an order on the sth of July last forbidding any more vessels to recruit native
labour on New Guinea or adjacent islands. But some hundreds of New Guineans are
still in Queensland. How these were obtained, and the necessity for their return, the
following narrative will best illustrate.
“ The mission schooner ‘ Ellangowan ’ arrived here on the 10th instant from Murray
Island, in Torres Straits. On board of her was a stowaway, a native belonging to the
east end of New'Guinea. He was one of 11, who reached Murray Island in a small
boat, escapees from a plantation in Queensland (probably on the Herbert (?) River).
They were treated with every kindness at Murray Island by the people and missionaries,
but no one there knows their language, so that their story could not be fully understood.
We have in the mission school here young men from the district to which the escapee
belongs, who speak his language, and these again know thoroughly the language of
Port Moresby. So that we have good and reliable interpreters. The following is his
story interpreted to me by Johnny and Kumate :
' “My name is Uakuri, and I belong to Bou. (Bou is the native name of a village near
to East Cape, close to Killerton Islands.) A large native canoe had come to Bou from
Basilaki (Moresb} r Island), and I returned in it to see some friends at Basilaki. (Basilaki,
or Moresby Island, is about 25 miles from Bou, and there is frequent communication
between the two places.) While at Moresby Island a foreign vessel, which I think is
named the ‘Lizzie,’ came. This was five moons ago. (From native reckoning this would
be before the new moon of April 26, but there is some doubt about exact date.) Two
boats came in, one beached while the other lay a little way off. In the latter were men
with guns. The boat that came in had three Yari boys (Yari= Teste Island) on board
with some white men, and they had plenty of tomahawks and knives in the boat. The
Yari boys told us that the white men wanted men to go in the ship to work at a place
they called Samsiweri (? Townsville) for three moons, at the end of which time they
would bring us back. Also that they would give a tomahawk and other things to every
man who would go, which he could give to his friends, and tiicn when he returned he
should have a box and foreign things. So a lot of the Moresby Island men went, and I
went with them. We did not desire to go away, but we very much wanted the toma-
hawks, and we were afraid of the men with guns in the other, boat who would be
angry, we were fold, if we did not go. The white men gave each of us one tomahawk,
one large knife, five pipes, five sticks of tobacco, and about a fathom of cotton cloth.
Each man who received the things was led down to the boat and not allowed to return.
After we got on board, the vessel went to Duan and Morna (Normanby and Lauchlan),
where 13 more men were got, and all these were told that they would only be three
moons away. When the vessel was full, and I do not know how many there were,
we never counted them, we sailed away. They gave us rice to cat, but we were always
sick after eating it. We had water, but not so much as we wanted. Some were beaten
by the white men because they would not do things they were told. While we were at
sea our names were written down by the captain, and we were told that we were going
for three years. We had not been told this before. Until then we -were told three moons.
Ido not know whether the Yari boys knew, but Ido not think they did. They seemed
as much surprised as we were. We were 15 nights at sea, and then anchored at


Samsiweri (? Townsville). As soon as the ship was anchored we were told through the
Yari boys that a gentleman would come on board and ask us if we had plenty to eat
and drink on board, and if we came of our own desire, and we were to be sure and say
‘yes,’ and not tell him that any of us had been beaten. If we did not say * yes,’ the
captain would never take us back, and we should have to stay in the foreigners’ country
for ever. So when a gentleman came and asked us, we answered as we had been told.
After a while we were taken on shore and up a river to a place were there was plenty of
sugar cane. The three Yari boys went back, I believe, in the ship which brought us. We
had to work all day, and were beaten with a piece of short rope if we sat down to rest.
Some were tied to a piece of wood and flogged, and then put in irons until next
morning, when they were set to work again. They gave us bread and rice, but we were
not accustomed to that food, and we were never satisfied; some could not eat it at all.
At night we all slept in one house, we lay on the boards and had pieces of blanket to
cover us. Five of our party died and others were ill. We were frightened and very
miserable, and so after we had stayed our three moons we crept down one night to a boat
took some pumpkins out of a pumpkin-house and some bottles which we filled with water,
and pushed off from the bank. The current soon carried us down to the sea, when we
hoisted the sail and stood out. We ran before the wind and were soon out of sight of
land. When it blew very hard we were afraid, but we were in search of life and going
to our homes, so we tried to be brave and strong. After six nights we saw land. We
were very glad, because we made sure it was Yari (Teste Island), but when we got close
we found it was a strange land. We were very hungry and tired, and so we went
ashore and gathered a few cocoanuts, and then we thought we would sail away, but the
tide had gone out and we could not drag our boat out, so we sat down by her and waited,
expecting the people of the place would kill us. But they belonged to Missionary and were
very kind to us. When I saw the ‘ Ellangowan ’ 1 wanted very much to come away in her,
and so I hid under some sails in the hold and did not come out till she got to sea.
“ Uakuri is an intelligent young man about 24 years of age and unmarried. Many of
those who went with him were married. Murray island is 550 miles from Townsville.
“He knows the name ‘ Ceara,’ and says that men went in her from Tupetupe (Engineer
G.P.), Oraive, and Koiaria, and that they went for three moons only.
“He was told also by natives that a vessel had been to the other side of East Cape
to villages called Barabara, Porotona, and Hirivau, and took men by force. One man
was shot and his dead body fastened to a tree and made a target of by white men. Of
course these stories must be taken for what they are worth, but they are believed by the
natives, and they all point to the fact that outrages have been committed by white men.
“ The personal testimony of Uakuri given above is thoroughly trustworthy. I know
natives well, and have no doubt in my own mind that in all he told me he was speaking
the truth. Natives do not generally distinguish foreign vessels by their names, but as a
two-masted schooner named the ‘ Lizzie,’ Captain Wawn, has been recruiting at Moresby
Island, no doubt he is correct as to the name of the vessel he was taken in.
“ His testimony is supported by the following facts : (1) The relatives of those gone
expected them back in three moons and say they went for that time; (2) the mission
teacher Pi, at South Cape, went alongside one of the vessels and was told by the natives
on board that they were coming back in three moons; (3) the numerous reports of
vessels having by unfair means got men away ; (4) the fact that several parties of natives
have attempted to escape, preferring the dangers of a long sea voyage in an open boat in
the hope of reaching some friendly land to the unendurable life of bondage on a plan-
tation (see annexed cutting); (5) the seizure of the* Forest King’ by Her Majesty’s ship
‘ Swinger ’ in July last for having no proper interpreter, and for taking natives who
believed they were going for three months only.
“ All this constitutes strong presumptive evidence that the men from New Guinea now
on Queensland plantations were taken there under false pretences.
“ The reasons which induced the Queensland Government to forbid any more vessels
going to New Guinea for labour will, I hope, lead them to insist on the return of those
who were brought before that prohibition and who are still in Queensland.
“ Justice and humanity alike demand their immediate return. It is impossible to
investigate their case in Queensland. No interpreter is obtainable there who can explain
what is wanted or translate all that is said. Besides which they are in the superior white
man’s country and in his power, and are too frightened to say anything that they think
will make him angry. Then there is interested local influence. The * Ceara ’ was away 38
days, returned with 108 men, and disposed of them (according to newspaper report) for
20/. a head. Such large profits and quick returns are apt to bias the judgment.
o 15064. F


“ I enclose a cutting from the ‘ Queenslander ’ of August 9, containing report of
police magistrate at Townsville re alleged misdeeds of ‘ Ceara.’ You will see how futile
such inquiries are. Captains, Government officers, mates, and their log-books may be.
examined for ever and nothing will come of it. They are all on the one side and all
interested. The police magistrate admits that he could not examine the natives satis-
factorily for want of an interpreter, and also says that he has no doubt outrages have
been committed on most of the islands in question.
“ If the confidence of the people at the east end of New Guinea is not restored by the
speedy return of their sons, husbands, and brothers, complications will ensue, and re-
prisals on innocent white men will take place. The British Government, whatever form it
may take on New Guinea, will be discredited and looked upon with suspicion by those
who believe that they have been deceived and their homes desolated by the white man.
“ All these alleged misdeeds have taken place at the extreme eastern end of New
Guinea, but the report of them, with many additions, will travel all along the coast.
“ I also enclose cuttings from the official ‘ Regulations and Instructions for the Guid-
ance of Government Agents appointed under the Pacific Island Labourers Act of 1880,”
published in Brisbane. I have underlined in red ink those that were violated by the
vessel in which Uakuri was taken, supposing his statement to be true.
“ Most sincerely and earnestly do I hope that the Imperial Government will stop the
entire traffic in human flesh in all these waters. It is very rarelj’ that the native side of
the question can be made known. They have no means of making their voice heard.
Polynesians who are civilized and advanced may be quite willing to work for white men
in Queensland or elsewhere, but these generally want too high a wage for the employers
of native labour. To natives less advanced, and and those in a primitive state, such as
New Guineans, whose life is as free as air and who call no man master, the work and
routine of a sugar plantation is simply intolerable. They would rather risk death in any
form than endure it. I know enough of the natives here to be perfectly sure that if they
knew the life they would not willingly go even for three months.
“ Eighteen months ago I wrote to the Colonial and English press that which I would
reiterate now in the light of recent events : —‘ You can get men in New Guinea for labour
in Queensland if you are prepared to take them by force or deceit, but not otherwise.
It will save loss, disappointment, and endless trouble if this be clearly understood from the
first.’
“ In spite of that warning they have been taken (there is ample proof) by fraud and
deceit. The wrong can only be righted by their return.
“ The importance of the subject and the deep merest I feel in it is my only apology for
the length of this.
“ I remain vours, &c.

May it please Your Excellency,
We, Her Majesty’s loyal and dutiful subjects, the Members of the Legislative
Council of New South Wales, in Parliament assembled, have the honour to communicate
to your Excellency the following resolutions adopted by the House this day ;
1. That this House having under consideration the following resolutions adopted
at the Australasian Convention, held in Sydney in November and December 1883,
namely:—
“(1.) That having regard to the geographical position of the Island of New
Guinea, the rapid extension of British trade and enterprise in Torres Straits, the
certainty that the island will shortly be the resort of many adventurous subjects of
Great Britain and other nations, and the absence or inadequacy of any existing
laws for regulating their relations with the Native tribes, this Convention, while
fully recognising that the responsibility of extending the boundaries of the Empire
belongs to the Imperial Government, is emphatically of opinion that such steps
should be immediately taken as will most conveniently and effectively secure the
incorporation with the Britisli Empire, of so much of New Guinea and the
small islands adjacent thereto as is not claimed by the Government of the
Netherlands.
“ (2.) That the governments represented at this Convention undertake to
submit and recommend to their respective Legislatures measures of permanent
appropriation for defraying in proportion to population such share of the cost


incurred in giving effect to the foregoing resolutions as Her Majesty’s Government,
having regard to the relative importance of Imperial and Australasian interests,
may deem fair and reasonable.
“ (3.) That the Convention protests in the strongest manner against the
declared intention of the Government of France to transport large numbers of
relapsed criminals to the French possessions in the Pacific, and urges upon Her
Majesty’s Government to use every means in its power to prevent the adoption
of a course so disastrous to the interests of Australasia arid the Pacific Islands.
“ (4.) That the Convention expresses a confident hope that no penal settlement
for the reception of European criminals will long continue to exist in the Pacific,
and invites Her Majesty’s Government to make to the Government of France such
serious representations on this subject as may be deemed expedient.”
records its approval of the said resolutions.
2. That this House, recognising that the time has not yet arrived at which a complete
federal union of the Australasian Colonies can be attained, but considering that there
are many matters of general interest with respect to which united action would be
advantageous, recommends the adoption in substance of the accompanying Draft Bill
for the constitution of a Federal Council, as defining the matters upon which such
united action is both desirable and practicable, and as embodying substantially the
provisions best adapted to secure that object.
3. That a humble address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that Her Majesty
may be graciously pleased to cause a measure to be submitted to the Imperial
Parliament for the purpose of constituting a Federal Council of Australasia upon the
basis of the Draft Bill adopted by the Convention held in Sydney in the months of
November and December 1883.
4. That an address be presented to his Excellency the Governor, communicating
the foregoing resolutions, accompanied by a copy of the Draft Bill therein
referred to.

of a Federal Council of Australasia on the basis of the Draft Bill agreed to by the


Sydney Convention, which was adopted on the 30 th ultimo by the Legislative

Government House. Sydney,
My Lord, November 6, 1884.
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s telegram of
31st October.*
2. I immediately forwarded the exact words of it as a circular telegram to the
Australian Governors, being under the impression that such was your Lordship’s wish.
3. I communicated your Lordship’s telegram immediately on its receipt to the
Attorney-General, Mr. Dailey, now Acting Colonial Secretary, who has consulted the
Cabinet on the proposals contained therein.
4. I have the honour to annex a Minute from Mr. Dailey, stating the grounds on
which this Government is unable to concur in the suggestion for the establishment of a
council of advice to aid Major-General Scratchley in exercising the Protectorate over
New Guinea, nor in the proposal to double the contribution previously agreed upon, of
which Minute I forwarded your Lordship an analysis in my telegram of 3rd November.f
5. I presume that the Governors of the Australasian Colonies will address their replies
to this circular telegram direct to your Lordship. I have, however, received a telegram
from the Administrator of the Government of Tasmania, Mr. Dobson, of which I enclose
a copy,J in which he states that the Government of Tasmania is not prepared to increase
its contribution towards the Protectorate of New Guinea beyond the sum already agreed
upon, of which I have sent your Lordship this day a copy by telegraph. J
(?. I am informed by Mr. Dailey that he had received a telegram from the Colonial
Secretary of New Zealand requesting to know his views as to the request for doubling
the contribution, and expressing much dissatisfaction that the other Pacific Islands were
ignored, and only New Guinea thought of, to which Mr. Dailey replied that it was the
intention of this Government to contribute according to agreement, but that they were
unable to enter into any undertaking for doubling contribution.

The Cabinet has had under consideration the telegram from Lord Derby, a copy
of which his Excellency forwarded for the perusal of the Acting Colonial Secretary.
Having carefully considered the situation, the Cabinet finds itself practically powerless
to take any additional steps concerning the Convention Resolutions.
* No, 22. t No. 27. t See No. 33.

After the adverse vote in the Assembly on Thursday evening, it would be obviously
impossible for the Government to assume the responsibility of participating in the
establishment of a Council of Advice such as that vaguely outlined by Lord Derby.
Had, Parliament given its approval to the Convention Resolutions, the Government
would have been in a position to consider the question with some degree of freedom ;
but, under existing circumstances, it would be an unauthorised procedure to undertake
any responsibilities, the assumption of which would be at variance with the recent action
of Parliament. Apart from this Parliamentary difficulty, however, the Government is
unable to perceive the necessity or the advantage of the suggested Council of Advice.
As far as the exercise of the protectorate authority is concerned, the Government has
unlimited confidence in such exercise by the Imperial Authorities. As to the pro-
posed doubling of the contribution, the Government is equally powerless ; any such
undertaking on our part would be imprudent, and in all probability would not be
sanctioned. .

Count Munster called at this office on the 15th instant, to say that Prince
Bismarck was very glad to learn from the memorandum which Your Excellency had
delivered to him that Her Majesty’s Government had the best intentions towards the
German Government in respect of Samoa and Tonga, and his Excellency was instructed
to thank me for this communication.
His Excellency observed that some private individuals had been working in those
islands for British annexation, and it would be desirable if the Government of
Samoa should be informed that such a movement was disapproved by Her Majesty’s
Government.
As to the proposal of an engagement to respect the independence of Samoa and Tonga,
the German Government had already declared in 1879 and in 1880 their willingness to
do so, and they were now quite willing to enter into negotiations for that object.
With regard to the South Sea Islands, his Excellency observed that the Australian
Colonies laid claim to them, and the annexation of a portion of New Guinea had placed
Germany at some disadvantage, but the German Government took notice of the assurance
of Her Majesty’s Government that no further annexation would take place until after
the proposed discussion as to the British and German interests in the South Seas had
taken place.

2, I have further to request your Lordship’s attention to the following resolutions
adopted unanimously on the sth of December 1883 by the Australasian Governments
assembled at the Convention of Sydney :
I. “ That further acquisition of dominion in the Pacific south of the Equator by any
foreign power would be highly detrimental to the safety and well-being of the
British possessions in Australasia, and injurious to the interests of the Empire.”
11. “ That this Convention refrains from suggesting the action by which effect can
best be given to the foregoing resolution in the confident belief that the.
Imperial Government will promptly adopt the wisest and most effectual
measures for securing the safety and contentment of this portion of Her
Majesty’s dominions.”
111. “ That having regard to the geographical position of the Island of New Guinea,
the rapid extension of British trade and enterprise in Torres Straits, the
certainty that the island will shortly be the resort of many adventurous
subjects of Great Britain and other nations, and the absence or inadequacy of
any existing laws for regulating their relations with the native tribes, this
Convention, while fully recognising that the responsibility of extending the
boundaries of the Empire belongs to the Imperial Government, is emphatically
of opinion that such steps should be immediately taken as will most con-
veniently and effectively secure the incorporation with the British Empire of
so much of New Guinea, and the small islands adjacent thereto, as is not
claimed by the Government of the Netherlands.”

Lordship by his Excellency the Acting High Commissioner of the Western Pacific,
I take the liberty of addressing myself directly to you, with the following request,
which will, I believe, very much simplify the question regarding the Maclay Coast of
New Guinea. As spokesman for the natives of that part of New Guinea, I have the
honour to request the Imperial British Government to recognise the autonomy of the
Maclay Coast, as Germany recognises the autonomy of Samoa, and hinders (by this
recognition) other Powers from taking it. Acceding to this request, the Imperial
Government will not only grant an act of justice tovyards the natives, but will also
satisfy the Australian Colonies, who arc anxious to prevent the North Coast of New
Guinea from falling into the hands of another Power. For the British Government
such a decision will further be a saving of extra expense and a prevention of possible
trouble with the natives.
I have addressed a similar request, viz., recognition of autonomy of the Maclay
Coast, to the Government of Russia, and intend likewise to appeal to the Governments
of Germany and France.

(Received December 24, 1884.)
My Lord, Sydney, November 12, 1884.
With reference to that portion of your Lordship’s telegram of 31st October,*
respecting an augmentation of the contributions by the Colonies towards the purchase
of a steamer for the use of the Special Commissioner for the Protectorate of New Guinea,
I have had some conversation with the Acting Colonial Secretary, and have suggested
that, in lieu of incurring the expense of the purchase of a steamer, the “ Wolverene ”
might possibly be available for this service.
2. This ship, intended originally for a floating naval college, has not been utilised for
this object by this Government, and has only been an useless expense to them. No
more suitable ship could be found for the purposes required for the Special Commis-
sioner. She is in perfect order, having been lately in dock, and merely requires a
sufficient crew to enable her to go to sea. She is roomy ; an excellent sailer; and is
capable of serving as a comfortable residence for the Commissioner when stationed at
New Guinea, where there are no means of housing him. He would also then be enabled
to cruise about the coast and adjacent islands for the purpose of supervision and
information.
3. It is, I think, very advisable that a ship of certain calibre should be stationed at
New Guinea for the service of the Commissioner; and, moreover, that there should be
a small armed force, either marines or policemen, to support and give effect to his
authority.
4.. As a result of my conversation with Mr. Dailey, I have now the honour to enclose
copy of a minute which I have received from him, of which I telegraphed the substance
to your Lordship on the 6th instant,f in which my Government place the “ Wolverene ”
at the disposal of the Imperial authorities. He further suggests that facilities for
manning the ship might be found in the voluntary re-engagement by the officers and
discharged men of the “Nelson ” and “ Diamond,” who are about to be relieved on the
re-commission of those ships.
5. Your Lordship will observe by Mr. Dailey’s minute that it is the great desire of
my Government to assist the Imperial Government in carrying out the arrangements for

Minute Paper.
Subject:—Respecting contribution by the Colonies towards the purchase of a steamer
for use of Special Commissioner for the Protectorate of New Guinea.
The Cabinet having had under its consideration the telegram from Lord Derby to
his Excellency as to the creation of the New Guinea Protectorate, and suggesting the
purchase in England by the contributing Governments of a steamer for the use of the
Special Commissioner, submits to his Excellency the following proposal :
The Government will place at the disposition of the Imperial authorities the
“ Wolverene,” now lying in Farm Cove. The ship is in perfect sea-going con-
dition, and would perhaps be found, under existing circumstances, to be a vessel
specially suitable for the requirements of the Commissioner. As, so far as the
Government is aware, no steps have been taken to secure an official residence in
New Guinea for General Scratchley, it seems to the Cabinet that this roomy and
safe ship might be immediately used by the Commissioner as a temporary residence
until the necessary arrangements are made for his accommodation on shore, that is,
if a fixed place of residence for him is contemplated. The Cabinet would point out
that facilities for manning the vessel might be found in the discharged crews of the
“ Nelson ” and the “ Diamond,” Her Majesty’s vessels of war, now in this harbour.
In submitting this offer to the Imperial Government through his Excellency, the
Cabinet desires to assist the Imperial Government in carrying out, under circum-
stances of some difficulty, the arrangements now being made for the Protectorate
of New Guinea. The Cabinet being unable to accept a larger responsibility as to
contributions than that which has already been communicated, is not in a position
at present to do more than make the offer which is now submitted.

New Guinea lying east of the Netherlands boundary and on the islands of the New
Britain Archipelago, and have become possessors of land by means of legal purchase
(Kaufvertrage) from the natives, the districts in question, under reservation of the legal

Emperor, and the German flag hoisted there in token of the annexation.

In reply to your letter of the 20th instant,* I am directed by the Earl of Derby
to observe that it appears from a telegram published in the “Daily News” newspaper
of the 23rd instant, that the recent German annexations in New' Guinea and the adjacent
islands were effected by the “ Hyaene ” and the “ Elizabeth,” which left Sydney on the
23rd of September and the 16th of October respectively. In view of these facts, and
of Baron Plessen’s note of the 2/th of September, enclosed in your letter of the 29th
of the same month,f Lord Derby is of opinion that the action taken by the German
Government before the meeting of the Commission which had been agreed upon, seems
to entitle Her Majesty’s Government to recover their freedom of action.

Instructions have now been sent to take measures at once that the small islands

the Louisiade Archipelago, shall be included in the British Protectorate, the northern
limit of which will also be advanced from East Cape to Huon Bay.

from the Agent-General of Victoria, enclosing two telegrams which he had received from

As the German Charge d’Affaires in London had, on the 27th September last,
intimated that the delimitation of the areas which interest Germany and England on
the north coast of New Guinea should, in the opinion of the German Government, be
tbe subject of a friendly understanding by means of a Commission, the course now taken
in proclaiming German jurisdiction over that coast, without any previous communication
with Her Majesty’s Government, appears to require explanation.

I am directed by the Earl of Derby to acknowledge the receipb.of your letter of

Edward Malet, reporting a verbal communication made to his Lordship by the German
Ambassador in London, relating to the proposal for a mutual engagement between this
country and Germany to respect the independence of Samoa and Tonga, and to the
question of further annexation by Great Britain in the South Seas, pending the discussion
which had been proposed as to British and German interests in those seas.
Before causing any communication to be made to the Samoan Government in the
sense suggested by the German Ambassador, Lord Derby would be glad if Lord Granville
would consider the point whether, after the course recently taken by Germany with
regard to the annexation of a part of New Guinea and other places in the South Pacific
Ocean, the arrangements and understandings referred to in the verbal communication
made by Count Munster can be considered to be still in existence and binding.
I am also to suggest, for Lord Granville’s consideration, whether, with reference to the
concluding paragraph of his Lordship’s Despatch of the 19th instant,J it may not be
desirable to intimate to the German Government that their action in New Guinea had
rendered it necessary for Her Majesty’s Government to extend Her Majesty’s protection
over the remaining portions of New Guinea and the islands in the neighbourhoods.

1. Ministers respectfully request his Excellency the Governor to inform the Secretary
of State for the Colonies that, while they are favourable to the annexation of New
Guinea, as intimated by r cablegram, they have instructed their Agent-General in London
not to join the Agents-General of the other Australian colonies in urging the Imperial
Government to take immediate action with reference to the New Hebrides and adjoining
islands.
2. Ministers understand from statements made by Her Majesty’s Government in the
Imperial Parliament, that some agreement exists between England and France with
respect to these islands, and they would be exceedingly unwilling to press on the
Imperial Government the adoption of any action which might lead to complications with
other nations.
3. Ministers believe that no such objection can be urged against the annexation of
New Guinea, and from its proximity to the northern coast of Australia, it is extremely
desirable that this island—or so much of it as is not claimed by the Dutch—should be
placed under British rule.
4. Ministers would remind your Excellency that both Houses of Parliament in this
colony passed addresses to Her Majesty in favour of the annexation of New Guinea in
the year 1875,
5. Reports that the French Government propose to obtain possession of some of the
New Hebrides or adjoining islands for the purpose of establishing large convict depots
there having been circulated, Ministers would respectfully point out to the Imperial
Government that the transportation of a number of criminals to any of these
islands would be a source of serious danger to the future welfare of the Australian
colonies.

Enclosure 1 in No. 110.
My Lord, British Consulate, Samoa, November 11, 1884.
I have the honour to inclose a copy of a despatch sent by me to the Consul-
General at Fiji, concerning Samoan affairs, since which events have occurred that, a
chance opportunity offering, I feel it my duty to report direct.
On the Qth instant 1 received a visit from the King, who in great distress sought my
advice. He told me that on the previous day the German Consul had sent his inter-
preter to him, who read a document to the Government virtually giving a preponderance
of influence to the Germans, such as establishing a police under German officers, having
a German treasurer, and other such things. He asked that the document be left with
him for discussion, but was refused, and was informed that he would be required to sign
it the following day. He complained most bitterly that he was being made under
threats of man-of-war compulsion to sign an act that he was not allowed to discuss.
The next day I received the inclosed letters which themselves will give your
Lordship a true statement of Samoan feeling. I was, until I received copies, in utter
ignorance that such action had been taken, which I believe was done in accordance
with my advice given long since, viz., that any such subject must be from themselves
without any foreign aid.
There is no doubt whatever that the feeling is universal and genuine, and that the
Samoans have now the greatest and sterling anxiety to be saved from what they openly
state to be an existence of slavery, I beg that your Lordship will pardon this hurried
despatch, caused by the unexpected chance of sending this information. A complete
report will be forwarded on first opportunity.
I have, &c.
Her Britannic Majesty’s (Signed) W. B. Churchward,
Principal Secretary of State, Acting British Consul,
for Foreign Affairs.
Sir, British Consulate, Samoa, October 28, 1884.
Referring to my Despatch J of the 6th December 1883, I have now the
honour to inform your Excellency that the anticipation stated therein of a certain
action being taken by the Germans is likely to be realised, Mr. Weber, as owner
of Mulinu Point, the seat of Government, having called upon the Samoans to redeem
or vacate this property.
My information is obtained from as reliable a source as is procurable, viz., from a
party of natives commissioned to ask my advice and opinion in the matter subsequent
to a Fono held amongst themselves.
They were most earnest in the matter, and informed me that after a Government
consultation they had offered payment hut it had been refused on account of a speech
from the Vice-King on the subject, at which the German authorities had taken
offence.
This speech, 1 have since ascertained, was to the effect of protesting against the
unfairness of the trial that deprived them of Mulinu, also against paying for land that
was considered to be really their own.
* No. 64. | No. 73. % Not printed.
, I 2


There existed, in my belief, another reason for this act of severity, viz., that the
Samoan Government intended to reopen the question, and for that purpose had arrested
the principal witness on whose evidence the case was given against them at the trial.
This man, a chief of Atua, and one whose name is affixed to more bad land deeds
than any other single man in the country, made his escape in the night, as is claimed,
by outside assistance, consequently the trial could not come off. He is now in Atua
amongst his own people, from whence it is highly improbable, if not impossible, for the
Government to get him back.
My visitors also informed me that it was the general opinion the Germans wished to
pick a quarrel with their government for annexation purposes. This they said was
made clear by speeches to them, by the man-of-war placing flags on various parts of
their coast, and also planting cocoa nuts on the reef islands.
Of course I could give no advice or opinion on the first subject, as such would
certainly be made public and no doubt have caused bad feeing as an act of interference
in what did not concern my office; but 1 explained that the flags were merely for
surveying purposes, and that the planting cocoa nuts could harm no one, and was not to
be taken for an act of possession as such is understood in their own custom.
I knew they had already been to the German Consul concerning the last two subjects,
and on my asking why they came to me after interviewing him, they replied that as he
belonged to the nationality of the man-of-war whose captain was present at their
interview, they were not sure they were correctly informed.
Shortly after this I had to abruptly dismiss them, for becoming excited, they commenced
a conversation that I could not listen to in this consulate, such as they would all fight
anyone who hoisted any other flag than the British flag over them, and that they would
all like to see flying over them.
There can be no doubt that the natives are really alarmed at the many reports of
German annexation, and as a body resent the idea. The increasing loud talk of German
power and importance impressed upon them every day of their lives, backed up by the
newspaper reports of German desire for land acquisition, all of which in a more or less
distorted condition they attain knowledge of and formally discuss, naturally cause them
• to think very seriously of the matter.
There is a report here that distinct orders have been received from home to enhance
in every possible manner the value of German interests in the group, and to lose no
opportunity for impressing the natives with German importance, with the view of
establishing a Protectorate.
From the very loud and decided manner in which some of the principal Germans have
been talking lately, and all of them generally, there would appear to be some reason for
believing this report to be a fact. A noticeable thing is that few of the German remarks
of their own intentions of advance are unaccompanied with corresponding depreciation of
British ideas.
A source of great personal annoyance to the Germans is of course the undeniable and
increasing preference that the Samoans have for the British, coupled with the moral
c eriainty, as shown by recent events, of soon being in active commercial opposition with
British enterprise and capital.
The preference for the British here has almost taken an official character, as instanced
by an entirely unprecedented act on the part of the King, who, previously to the
departure of the British Syndicate that came here to negotiate the acquisition of the
American and McArthur’s land claim, sent the principal member some handsome mats,
a ring, &c. These presents were publicly brought to the hotel and delivered by the
King’s wife, who was escorted by some of the government police. This could not have
been done without the consent or knowledge of the whole government, who to a
noticeable degree keep His Majesty a sort of prisoner, and regulate all that he does.
There can be but little doubt that the pressure put upon the Samoans in the Mulinu
affair has very much more to do with their openly expressed opinion of British sympathy
than the speech complained of, which in itself was nothing more than a natural grumble
from the loser of a lawsuit, for the vice-king was the man whose claim was disallowed.
Before the arrival of the British Laud Syndicate, although an arrival was expected, yet
it was thought to be in the American interest. Of this the Germans took little or no
notice, although a considerable quantity of land is claimed by both parties; but when
it was found to be a British enterprise, which, if carried out, would place the Germans
very much in the shade, the loud talk became redoubled, and has continued so ever
since.


The last cause ±t>r complaint is that the missionaries at their annual meeting made use
of the word Peretania (Britannia) too frequently, in fact the smallest accidental
circumstance forms a subject for loud-spoken suspicion.
30th October.—l have just received a message from Mulinu to the effect that the
King, Tairaua and Taipule, intend.doing or saying nothing until the arrival of a British
man-of-war, by which they expect a letter in answer to the king’s sent last November
through Captain Acland, of H.M.S. “ Miranda.” This is in itself a certain proof of the
now universal desire for British influence here. When the letter in question was sent
no one appeared in the matter but the King himself and two or three of his people,
although’ others were cognisant of it, yet His Majesty did not wish it to be known what
had been done.
Now, I am assured that the whole Government as a body are most anxious for a
favourable answer, and have privately sent me word that it is the desire of the whole
people. If they do not receive a favourable answer, they hint at doing something
mysterious of their own accord. They have not told me what that is, but I imagine it
is what they have threatened to do before, viz., hoist the British flag, and proclaim
themselves British, In anticipation of such an occurrence I should be glad of your
Excellency’s advice in the matter.
31st October.—This morning the annexation alarm amongst the natives was vastly
increased by the quite unexpected arrival of the German 12-gun corvette “ Marie.”
This appeared to corroborate all the previous reports that had been spread abroad. The
“ Elizabeth,” 19-gun corvette, being also daily expected, seemed to surely point to a
naval demonstration of some sort or other in these parts. The next day I received a
visit from the Commander of the “ Marie ” and the German Consul. The former told
me that he suddenly received telegraphic orders at Callao to proceed without delay to
this station. Dr. Stuebel at the same time stated that he was left in complete ignorance
of her mission further than that she had been ordered for service on this station. She
is, I understand, to wait here for orders presumably to arrive per “ Elizabeth.” Although
Dr. Stuebel informs me that he has had no intimation of the “ Elizabeth ” calling at all.
I have been informed from several sources that the German Consul will, now the
“Marie” is in port, proceed to enforce a settlement of certain German causes of com-
plaint against Samoans, the nature and importance of which I have not as yet been able
to ascertain. This will have the effect of still more alarming the Samoans.
Finally, I would respectfully again ask your Excellency for instructions as to line of
conduct to be observed should the natives carry out their threat and hoist the British
flag as against aggression, and proclaim their desire to become British. This, lam
confident, they will do, should they come to any difficulties with the Germans, which at
present is very likely ; and should these difficulties not occur, it is more than probable
that before long, perhaps on the arrival of a British man-of-war, an offer of cession will
be made.
It is on this account that I am anxious to know your Excellency’s views as to the
line of conduct to be observed.

Also we wrote an earnest request to the Governor and assistant rulers in the
Government of New Zealand, that they would support our prayer to Her Majesty the

To their Excellencies the Governor and Chief Assistant Rulers of New Zealand.
Your Excellencies, Mulinuu, Samoa, November 5, 1884.
We are the King and rulers of Samoa. We write to you to make known our
prayer and entreaty to Her Highness the Queen of England in order that there may be
set up the sovereignty of the Government of Her Majesty the Queen of England in our
islands, and that it should be entirely at the disposal of Her Majesty’s Government as
to whether they should be formed into an English colony or be connected with your
Government in New Zealand.
Our King wrote nearly a year ago giving over the sovereignty of these islands to Her
Majesty the Queen and the Government of England. We have also been very anxious
for an answer, but no answer has yet reached us.
. We, therefore, send this entreaty to you in order that you may forward it to Her
Majesty and the Government of England.
We earnestly entreat you to assist us by praying Her Majesty the Queen of England
to accept our request.
We earnestly beg that you will listen to our prayer, and will render us all possible
assistance, for our fear is great on account of the information we have received that our
islands are about to be seized by Germany.
We love much and respect the Government of England, because we know the
Government of England acts justly and protects well the people who are under its rule.
We do not want any other government to take possession of our government.
We earnestly entreat and beg your Excellencies to make known our prayer to the
Queen and the Government of England by means of a telegram.
We rely on Her Majesty the Queen of England to devise some means to prevent
Germany from taking possession of our islands, which is not according to our desire.
We trust that your Excellencies, by your aid and by your entreaty to Her Majesty
the Queen, will bring to pass the setting up of Her sovereignty in Samoa.
May your Excellencies live.
We are.
To Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland,
Your Majesty, Mulinuu, November 5, 1884.
We are the King and Chiefs of Samoa, who write to your Majesty to pray and
entreat you to receive our request. It is now nearly a year ago since our King wrote
to give over to your Majesty the sovereignty of Samoa.
We have been very anxious while Waiting for an answer, but no answer has been
received.
Your Majesty, great is our regard for your Government, for we know well our people
will be protected, and we shall have peace under your rule.
Therefore, we entreat your Majesty that our anxiety may be relieved, which arises
from our earnest desire that Samoa may be given over to your Government.
It is entirely at the disposal of Your Majesty as to whether it is better for us to
become an English colony, or be connected with the Government of New Zealand.
Your Majesty, our hearts are grieved and our fear is very great indeed with regard to
other governments who desire to take possession of our Government, which is not
according to our wish. Therefore we entreat Your Majesty that you will speedily
come to our assistance in order that you may save us according to the sentiment
expressed in our request.
We wish to make clear to Your Majesty, we, the King and Chiefs of Samoa, give over
our islands to the sovereignty of the Government of England.
We rely on the Government of Your Majesty to protect our people. We hope and
pray to God that Your Majesty and your Government may .prosper.

To his Highness the Vice-Consul of England.
Sir, Mulinuu, November 11, 1884.
I wish to inform your highness that I have now written to Her Majesty the
Queen nf Great Britain, and made known to Her Majesty our petition which has been


committed (placed in the hands of) the Governor of New Zealand. It is mentioned also
in that letter.
I beg (have begged) your highness that you would explain to Her Majesty every-
thing that gave rise to my receiving the agreement which was made last night with
Germany.
I and my Government have been much distressed lest our group of islands should be
taken by Germany. I wrote yesterday to the German Consul to give me a copy of the
agreement with me and my Government. But the German Consul replied that he
could not give me and my Government a copy. Then the whole Government met
together and deliberated what was right to do, and it ended in our rejecting the agree-
ment ; it was not received.
Notwithstanding that our distress still continued; it was getting very near the hour of
the night that was fixed to hold the meeting, and I was walking in the road when Tupua
Tamasese came down. He spoke distressfully and told me that bad story, and I became
again very anxious ; and I said, “ Let us both go and receive the agreement, in order
that we may be at peace to-day, and let us wait some decision from Great Britain.”
I beg your highness to make known to Her Majesty the great regard (love) of myself
and my Government to the Government of Great Britain; and also our strong desire to
give up our group of islands to the Government of Great Britain. I hope in Her
Majesty. Do not bear in mind (as an injury) this agreement with. Germany. lam
determined that when the sovereignty of Her Majesty is exercised over these islands,
then that agreement shall end. Let not your highness be offended, but do you make
these things clear to Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain, and do you send this
letter by the steamer at Tutuila.
Malietoa,
the King of Samoa.
To Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland.
Your Majesty, Mulinuu, November 11, 1884.
This is to make known to your Majesty that I, the King of Samoa, and the Chiefs
of my islands have sent a petition to your Majesty that you would set up your
Government in Samoa.
We have sent that petition to the Governor of New Zealand, and have besought him
to send it by means of a telegram to your Majesty, and make known to your Majesty
that he has received our petition.
We have informed your Majesty in our petition that painful anxiety has taken pos-
session of our minds, because we are very much afraid of Germany lest they should take
our islands against our will.
Your Majesty! We are in distress on account of the Government of Germany, lest
they should take our islands. Therefore we have accepted another treaty with Germany.
I wish, in consequence, to make clear to your Majesty that I have accepted that treaty
against my will; likewise also against the will of my Government, but 1 have accepted
it on account of my fear, for I have thought if your Government should be set up in
these islands then that treaty will become of no effect.
I have entreated the English Consul here that he will make clear to your Majesty
all the reasons of our fear which have led us to accept that treaty, and to make clear
also to your Majesty the meaning of that treaty, and to inform you also of the great
regard of myself and my Government for your Majesty and the Government of
England, and our very great desire to give over our islands to the Government of your
Majesty. I respect exceedingly the Government of your Majesty, and I trust that
speedily you will receive favourably our petition.
May your Government be established.
Malietoa the King,
Samoa,
your humble servant.

Enclosure in No. 118.
Sib, Foreign Office, January 3, 1885.
Count Munster spcke to me to-day on the subject of New Guinea.
His Excellency said that he had received a letter from Prince Bismarck on the
matter. The Chancellor did not understand the objections which had been made by
the English public to the German annexation in New Guinea.
He was ready to treat about the boundaries of our respective possessions in New
Guinea, and also about the islands in the South Sea, in the way that was formerly
agreed.
The Chancellor had understood that Her Majesty’s Government had given Germany
full latitude as regarded the North of New Guinea, by what was communicated by
Mr. Scott on the 9th October last.
I read to Count Munster the words used by Mr. Scott, which conveyed the decision
arrived at by Her Majesty’s Government after consideration of the communication
which Baron von Plessen made on behalf of his Government respecting the limits of the
British Protectorate, viz., that the declaration shall limit the Protectorate to the whole
of the southern coast, including the islands contiguous to it, instead of that which they
had first proposed.
“ This will be without prejudice to any territorial questions beyond these limits.
“ It is with great satisfaction that Her Majesty’s Government have come to an
arrangement in which they find themselves in perfect accord with Germany.
“ They are of opinion that if any questions should arise as to those districts which lie
beyond the limits described, it will be better to deal with them diplomatically than
to refer them to the Commission which it is proposed to appoint with regard to the
islands in the Pacific; ” and I said that I could not put the same interpretation on
them as Prince Bismarck had done ; and this view was confirmed by what Count Munster
had said in conversation with me on the 15th of December, namely, that “ with regard
“ to the South Sea Islands, the Australian colonies laid claim to them, and the
“ annexation of a portion of New Guinea had placed Germany at some disadvantage,
“ but the German Government took notice of the assurance of Her Majesty’s Govern-
“ ment that no further annexation would take place until after the proposed discussion
“ as to the British and German interests in the South Seas had taken place.”
Count Munster said that it applied to us only, an opinion to which I stated it was
impossible to agree.
I added that the Cabinet had considered the matter to-day, and that I should write
a despatch on the whole subject in a short time.
In the meanwhile, Lord Derby would answer some pointed questions put from
Australia by saying that the German annexation has been made without a previous
intimation, and that Her Majesty’s Government were now in communication with
Germany on the whole subject.

affairs, and consequently the great importance of these subjects was hardly realized in
this Colony. Besides, there is certainly a general feeling throughout the country
against federation in the ordinary sense of the term, arising partly from the view
that the distance between New Zealand and Australia is too great and the climate too
different to make any arrangement like that now existing in the Canadian Dominion
desirable, and partly from the disagreement amongst the advocates of federation as to
details—some desiring that the Council should be a legislative, others only a deliberative,
body.
3. Again, with reference to New Guinea, it is argued that, though it is possible that
a trade may arise between this Colony and India by the Torres Straits, the direct
interest of New Zealand in that country is very slight, and the readiness with which this
Colony has taken part in the movement as regards the New Guinea Protectorate may
be attributed to its being regarded as a step towards annexations in the Western
Pacific.
Thus the Government, whilst declining to advise Parliament to contribute anything
further than a proportionate part of the sura originally asked for, have determined to
propose next session that this Colony shall guarantee the cost incident to the acquisition
of the Samoa and Tonga groups of islands, which they hope may be effected.
4. Considerable interest is exhibited in New Zealand concerning the Western Pacific
Islands. This arises partly from fears connected with the French Recidiviste Bill, and
the possible occupation of those islands by other European Powers, partly from the hope
that an extensive trade with them may arise.
5. A memorandum by the Colonial Treasurer, Sir Julius Vogel (of which I enclose
copies) has been adopted by ray Ministers as expressing their views on these subjects.
6. Your Lordship will perceive that in that memorandum reference is made to the
New Zealand “ Confederation and Annexation Act, 1883,” (which I transmitted with
my Despatch of the Bth September 1883 J), to which my Government are anxious
that Her Majesty’s assent should be given.
7. The following resolutions were introduced by the Government into the Legislative
Council and House of Representatives respectively:—
Whereas at a meeting of Delegates from the following Colonies, namely, Fiji, New
South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and
Western Australia, held in Sydney, during November and December, 1883, the
following resolutions§ were agreed to.
* No. 113. t No. 71. X No * 31 in [C. 3803] February 1884.
§ These Resolutions are printed at pages 142 and 143 of [C. 3863] February 1884.
K 4


And whereas, at the said Convention, a draft Bill to constitute a Federal Council
of Australasia was also agreed to: And whereas, in pursuance of the undertaking
given by the Delegates from the Colony of New Zealand, it is desirable that the
resolutions of the said Convention should be submitted to this Legislature :
This House resolves:—
That it agrees generally with the resolutions of the said Convention; but, in order
that its views may be specifically expressed, it resolves as follows :
(a.) That it approves of the steps taken by the British Government for the
establishment of its rule over New Guinea, and hopes that like measures will
be taken for a Protectorate over the islands of the Pacific Ocean not under
the dominion of any stable government.
( h .) That this Colony is willing to pay, in proportion to its population, a share
of the sum of 15,000/, proposed by the Imperial Government.
(c.) That it desires respectfully to protest against the transportation of criminals
to the French possessions in the Pacific.
( d .) That it requests the British Government to make such representations to
the European Powers as will prevent the maintenance of penal establishments
in any of the Pacific Islands.
(c.) That the establishment of such a Federal Council, as is proposed in the
Convention’s draft Bill, is premature.
{f.) That, so far as the Bill aims at enabling the colonies to jointly initiate
legislation on questions of common interest and importance to the several
colonies, it has the cordial support of this House.
(g\) That, to place the proposed measure in accordance with these opinions, it
will be necessary to vary the Bill so as to provide:—First, That the Federal
Council shall not make representations to the Imperial Government direct,
but to the several Colonial Governments, Second, That any measure it
initiates shall not have any force within any colony, nor affect any colony,
until it is adopted by the Legislature of such colony.
8. In the Legislative Council the subject was thoroughly discussed, and the
Resolutions were amended by striking out (/.} and ( g .), and adding the following words
to (e.): —
“So far as New Zealand is concerned, the geographical position of New Zealand
requiring that the Federal connexion between New Zealand and Australia should
be less close than that between the various Australian Colonies.”
9. In the House of Representatives, however, the discussion did not come on until
the evening of Saturday the Bth November, when several members had already left
Wellington, and it was generally understood that the session would end the following
Monday. There was therefore a strong feeling that in such circumstances the question
could not be adequately considered; and although members of both the present and
the late government spoke strongly in favour of the resolutions (subject only to a
verbal alteration making it clear that the sum of 15,000/. which this Colony would
undertake to pay a share of, was that which was first proposed by the Imperial
Government), they were amended by striking out resolutions (<?.), {/.), and (§•.), and
substituting the following words :
“ (e.) That it is of opinion that further negotiations should take place between the
Australasian Colonies with regard to Federation, and that further consideration of
the question be postponed until next session of Parliament.”
10. I transmit copies of ,the resolutions* as agreed to by the two Houses respectively.
The New Zealand “Hansard” containing the debates is not yet printed ; but I will
transmit copies as soon as they appear.
11. From my telegram of the 17th Novemberf your Lordship will have already
learnt the conclusions arrived at by Parliament; and will have seen that in accordance
therewith my Government urge the postponement of the Federal Council Bill.

Enclosure in No. 127. '
Questions relating to Federation and the South Sea Islands.
Memorandum to Cabinet by the Colonial Treasurer of New Zealand.
The Colonial Treasurer of New Zealand, having for many years past taken great
interest in questions relating to the South Sea Islands, submits this memorandum to the
Cabinet regarding his views as to the present situation.
1. There are four subjects relating to the islands calling more or less for a distinct
decision on the part of the Colony through its Legislature.
2. These questions are, —
{a.) The annexation or establishment of a protectorate over New Guinea and
other islands in the Pacific.
(b.) A contribution by the Colony to the cost of a High Commissioner and his
staff in special relation to New Guinea;
( c .) The question of any of the islands in the South Seas being used for the
reception of convicts;
(d.) The proposal to establish a Federal Council.
It is better to deal with these subjects separately.
3. (a.) New Zealand has less direct interest in New Guinea than in the more
easterly islands. The annexation of New Guinea, or a large portion of it, is of
commanding importance to Queensland because of its proximity to that Colony. The
establishment of a Foreign Power in the south-east of New Guinea would, in course of
time, be as disastrous to Queensland as would the foreign occupation of one of its
islands be to New Zealand, or the foreign occupation of Tasmania be to Victoria. The
southerly Colonies of Australia have somewhat more interest in the annexation of
New Guinea than has New Zealand; the interests of the latter are mainly concerned
in the annexation of the islands to the eastward of Australia. Considering less their
geographical position than the trade which has grown up with them, Victoria and
New South Wales have probably as much interest in the islands to the east as
they have in New Guinea, so that in making New Guinea the most prominent
subject of their representations they have shown rare disinterestedness. Still no
colony has so much interest in any one island, or group of islands, as Queensland has in
New Guinea, and the Colonies were bound to look at the question from something
more than a selfish point of view. It is well, however, that the situation should be
distinctly understood, because there is no reason why New Zealand and other Colonies
should carry their self-sacrificing disposition so far as to fail to press on the Imperial
Government the immense importance to them, now that the question, as far as it relates
to New Guinea is settled, of the annexation of the other islands. The Colonial
Treasurer holds that the Parliament of New Zealand should be asked to express its
approval of the annexation of the easterly islands, as well as of New Guinea. The
re-enactment, slightly altered, of the following resolution, passed by the House of
Representatives last year, would seem to meet the case so far as an expression of opinion
is concerned: “ That the British Government should, under existing circumstances,
“ take steps for the establishment of its rule over such islands in the Pacific as are not
“ already occupied by or under the protectorate of a Foreign Power, and the occupation
“ of which by any Foreign Power would be detrimental to the interests of Australasia.”
It might, however, be better to follow more nearly the language of the resolutions
passed by the Convention last year. It would embarrass rather than aid the Imperial
Government to enter into the question of the conflicting interests to be considered in
relation to the islands east of Australia and New Guinea. But it can do no harm to
make a special reference to the Tonga and Samoa groups of islands, which are probably
the most valuable of the islands yet unannexed. The Tonga group is now ruled by an
aged king. It is an open secret that whenever he dies there are likely to be such
disturbances in the islands as will make the Natives glad to welcome the intervention
of a strong Power. Viewing the situation of these islands with regard to Fiji, putting
apart all other considerations, there would seem to be no doubt that Great Britain
should be prepared to intervene at Tonga whenever the necessity arises. The Samoan
Islands possess advantages of which Foreign Powers have shown themselves aware.
Negotiations relating to them will probably be of a very delicate nature, and it is better
to refrain from saying more than that they are fully as valuable to Great Britain as to
other Powers, In relation to all these questions, it is clearly alike the duty and the
interest of the Colony to strengthen, not to weaken, the hands of the Imperial
o 15064. L


Government. A point of great importance to New Zealand does not seem to have
entered into the consideration of the Sydney Conference, and yet it is well worthy of
careful deliberation. The Colonial Treasurer alludes to the Act passed last year,
reserved for Her Majesty’s approval, providing a machinery for enabling one or more
islands to be annexed to New Zealand. As far as the other Australasian Colonies are
concerned, it must be better in all respects that the islands annexed should, without
expense to them, become integral portions of a constitutionally-governed Colony, in
preference to a system of a protectorate or of Crown-colony government. The Act
makes it clear that the New Zealand Legislature is agreeable to an increase of the
territory of the Colony. It is greatly to be hoped that Her Majesty’s assent will be
given to the Act.
4. ( b .) The contribution of 15,000/. asked for seems to be intended as an expenditure
on New Guinea especially. From what has already been said it is clear that this is an
expenditure in which New Zealand has a minimum amount of interest. But the same
in less degree may be said of Victoria, and it would be so impolitic of New Zealand to
place itself outside the Australasian combination, that the Colonial Treasurer is
favourable to the Colony sharing the liability on the basis of its limitation to the same
proportion of the whole contribution as the population of New Zealand bears to the
total population of the Australasian Colonies. In round figures this would amount to
2,500/. a year, more or less.
5. (<?.) The restriction of convict settlements in the Pacific is a question of over-
whelming interest to the Australasian Colonies. To some extent they may keep the
convicts from their shores by stringent legislation ; but, beside the inexpediency, in the
interest of friendly relations, of having to adopt such legislation, the injury does not stop
with the actual access to the Colonies of the criminals themselves. Their presence indeed
in the Colonies, where they could be to some extent held in restraint, deplorable as it
would be, would perhaps be less injurious than that they should carry throughout the
Pacific Islands their crime-stained instincts, and lay the foundation of future generations
of lawless peoples. No representations on the subject can be too strong, but it is to be
doubted if it is not better calculated to aid the British Government in its negotiations
that the representations should be made to it direct, rather than fulminated in a manner
calculated to arouse the pride of a great nation. It should be easy to show that France,
from which country the danger is apprehended, that, in the interests of her own posses-
sions in the Pacific, and of the large trade which must grow up between them and the
Colonies, it would be to her own advantage to seek some other part of the world as a
home for her criminal population.
6. ( d .) Upon the question of a Federal Council there seems to be some misunder-
standing, both as to the exact nature of the proposals under consideration, and as to the
extent of the desire expressed for federation by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Practically the views of Lord Derby, as to saving the Imperial Government additional
expenditure, are sufficiently met by the Colonial Legislatures singly giving their
guarantees to provide funds. This it is proved can be done without recourse to federa-
tion. The Federal Council Bill is a measure calculated to arouse mistrust, because it is
impossible to determine what consequences may arise from it. Its advocates profess to
see in it the road to an ultimate Australasian Dominion; but it is by no means
established that such a result is desirable. There are not the same reasons for
constituting a dominion in Australasia as there were in Canada. The Australasian
Colonies are of vast size, their systems of central and local government have been
matured according to the wishes of their respective peoples : federation would impose
irksome restraints on the self-governing powers of each Colony, would reduce the
competition and emulation that now work favourably, and would give no sufficiently
compensating advantages. Federation of the entire empire would be impeded, rather
than promoted, by a permanent federation of the separate Colonies. The benefits that
would follow Imperial federation are as certain as those of Colonial federation are
doubtful. If the federation of Australasia is desirable, it should be brought about
openly, not insidiously. The Feberal Council Bill either does not aim at federation, or
aims at fastening it on the Colonies by gradually and involuntarily committing them
to it. The Colonies are not yet sufficiently agreed on vital points to be ready for
federation. T'o decoy them into it is to run the chance of creating feelings of a nature
so bitter that their one effort will be to subsequently free themselves.
The leading features of the Bill are :
(a.) That, subject to the Colonial Legislatures approving the Act {i.e., the Bill under
consideration), the Federal Council constituted by it will thereafter have absolute
and final powers of legislation on a great many questions.


(5.) The Council will have powers of legislation on further questions specially referred
to it.
(<?.) The Council may make such representations or recommendations to Her Majesty
as it may think fit with respect to any matters of general Australasian interest or to
the relations of Her Majesty’s possessions in Australasia with the possessions of
Foreign Powers.
(i d .) Each Colony is to be represented in the Council by two members, excepting
Crown Colonies, which are to be represented by one member each.
Regarding (a.) and (5.), it is only necessnry to point out how a word or a sentence
may alter the meaning of an Act, to show it does not follow that the Council’s legislation
will be satisfactory because the Colonies approve of its dealing with the questions to
which the legislation relates. Nothing short of the Colonies separately approving each
measure after the Council passes it can meet what they require, whilst they retain their
independent rights of government.
The authority to make representations (c.) to the Imperial Government cannot be
exercised beneficially. The Council is to have the option of not sitting more than once
in two years. It may work, it is true, by Committees, but no Colony would be content
that authoritative representations should be made on its behalf by Committees not
selected by it; and, as to the Council, it may not be sitting when the representations
require to be made. Neither, however, to Council nor Committee could a Colony
safely leave the power of making representations on its behalf. It really all comes back
to this point: that, as long as the Colonies are not federated, as long as each is self-
governed, and the Government of each responsible to the local Legislature, it will be
impossible for such Governmment to do justice to its responsibility and yet allow part
of the powers it ought to exercise to be exercised by others. There would be a constant
struggle between each Colony and the Federal Council. The Imperial Government
would espouse the rights of the Council, would decline to receive separate representations,
and there would be coolness and want of friendly understanding between the Colonies
and the Colonial Office.
The conditions of representation ( d .) in the Council would not be satisfactory to
Colonies which, like New Zealand, make their ordinary system of representation to
depend mainly on the basis of population. A single large Colony, with the aid of two
or three smaller ones, might override the rest of the Colonies, possessing double the
aggregate population. If the Council were a mere Convention to frame measures for
the consideration and approval of the Colonies separately, and to make recommendations
to the Colonial Governments on subjects of joint importance, but not to the Imperial
Government, the basis of representation would be of less consequence.
But these objections are only directed against the measure as a Federal Council Bill.
Were its objects less ambitious, and did it merely aim at enabling the Colonies to pass
laws on subjects of common importance to them all, too much could not be said in its
praise. The Colonies have long felt the want of dealing with particular subjects by
common laws, and would hail a machinery by which, as regards those subjects, a
common law could be made to prevail. By providing, as before suggested, that no law
should have force until approved by the Colonies separately, the objections would be
met, as the independence of the several Governments would not be overridden before the
time arrived for efficient federation.

Your Majesty, Mulinuu, Samoa, November 5, 1884,
We, the King and Chiefs of Samoa, now write to Your Majesty that you will
grant this our humble request.
Our King wrote nearly a year ago, begging Your Majesty to take possession of
Samoa, and we have waited anxiously for a reply, but have received none.
Your Majesty, great is our respect for your Government, and we know that you will
protect our people, and that they will be contented under your rule; and we therefore
earnestly pray Your Majesty to relieve us from our great anxiety and trouble by quickly
extending your Government over Samoa, and either making it a British colony or
allowing us to be governed by New Zealand.
Your Majesty, our minds are full of trouble, and we are much afraid that other
nations desire to take our country against the wish of our people, and we therefore
implore Your Majesty to save us by granting our petition. .
We wish to make this clear to Your Majesty that we, the King and Chiefs, will give
over our country to the Government of Great Britain, and we rely upon Your Majesty
to protect our people.
We pray to God that He will bless Your Majesty and Government.

Enclosure ift No. 131.
Sir, - Foreign Office, January 13, 1885.
I transmit to your Excellency herewith translation of a letter from the German
Ambassador at this Court, notifying officially to Her Majesty’s Government that the
German flag has been hoisted in token of annexation on the north coast of New Guinea,
and on the islands of the New Britain archipelago.
Prince Bismarck, as your Excellency informed me by telegraph on the 19th ultimo,
has already apprised you of this fact.
Her Majesty’s Government were quite unprepared for such an announcement, for the
recent negotiations with the German Government, which I will briefly recapitulate, had
led them to believe that a friendly understanding had been arrived at between the two
Governments, in virtue of which neither Power would make fresh acquisitions in the
Pacific Ocean pending the meeting of the Anglo-German Commission which had been
agreed upon.
On the Bth of August last the German Ambassador intimated to me the wish of his
Government to come to a friendly understanding with Her Majesty’s Government as to
the general principles to be observed for the protection of the subjects of the two
countries in the islands of the South Sea archipelago, and also as to the limits of the
islands and territories in which either country was most interested.
While recognising as natural the wish of the Australian Colonies to be paramount in
the part of New Guinea opposite their coast, his Excellency said that his Government
were of opinion that there were parts of the wild country on the north coast of New
Guinea which might be available as a field for German enterprise.
I pointed out to his Excellency, however, that Germany had as yet founded no
establishments there, adding that the German Government already knew that com-
munications had taken place between the Home and Colonial Governments respecting
New Guinea, and I mentioned in confidence that these communications were nearer a
conclusion than the public yet knew.
On the following day, after consultation with my colleagues, Unformed Count Munster
that Her Majesty’s Government had no desire to oppose the extension of German
colonization in the islands of the South Seas which were unoccupied by any civilized
Powers, but I warned him that the extension of some form of British authority in New
Guinea would be shortly announced, explaining, however, that it would only embrace
that part of the island which specially interested the Australian Colonies, without
prejudice to any territorial questions beyond those limits.
On September 19th, Mr, Scott, Her Majesty’s Chargd d’Afiaires at Berlin, informed
the German Government that, in consequence of the communications which had lately
taken place between the Home and Colonial Governments, Her Majesty’s Government
proposed to proclaim and establish the Queen’s Protectorate over all the coasts of New
Guinea not occupied by the Netherlands, except that portion of the northern coast
comprised between the 145th degree of East longitude and the eastern Dutch
boundary.
It was at the same time explained that the British Protectorate would include the
small islands immediately adjacent to those portions of the coast over which it was
established, and that the 145th degree of East longitude had been fixed as the western
British limit on the northern coast, in order that it might embrace the territory owned
by the Natives on the Maclay coast, whose claim for British protection had long been
under the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government.
On September 27th, Baron Plessen, the German Charge d’Affaires in this country,
made a communication from his Government to the effect that the proposed extension
of the British Protectorate to the north and north-east of New Guinea was unexpected,
and that his Government wished temporarily to reserve the attitude to be taken up by
them ; and it was added that, according to the conception of the Imperial Government,
the delimitation of the areas which interest both sides on that stretch of coast should be
the object of a friendly understanding by means of a Commission.
On October 9th, Mr. Scott, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Berlin, informed the
German Government that Her Majesty’s Government, having carefully considered the


above communication, had decided that they would limit their protectorate to the whole
of the southern coast, including the islands contiguous to it, but without prejudice to
any territorial question beyond these limits. Mr. Scott expressed the satisfaction of Her
Majesty’s Government at having come to an arrangement as to which they found
themselves in perfect accord with Germany, and added that in their opinion," if any
questions should arise as to those districts which lie beyond the limit described, it would
be better to deal with them diplomatically than to refer them to the Commission which
it was proposed to appoint with regard to the islands of the Pacific.
On October 15th, Baron Plessen expressed the satisfaction of his Government at the
limitation of the British Protectorate, and suggested that the discussion of the points
connected with English and German interests in the South Seas should take place in
London.
After consulting Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, I informed the
German Ambassador at this Court, on November 10th, that Her Majesty’s Government
agreed to the proposals of the German Government, and that they would appoint a
Commissioner to meet the German Commissioner, Dr. Krauel.
On December sth, your Excellency, in giving assurances to the German Government
respecting the islands of Samoa and Tonga, added that Her Majesty’s Government did
not contemplate any fresh arrangements in the Pacific Ocean pending the result of the
negotiation agreed to between the two Governments.
On the 15th of December the German Ambassador expressed the satisfaction of his
Government at these assurances.
As regards the South Sea Islands, his Excellency observed at the same time that the
Australian Colonies laid claim to them, that the annexation of a portion of New Guinea
had placed Germany at some disadvantage, but that his Government took note of the
assurance of Her Majesty’s Government that no further annexations would take place
until after the proposed discussion respecting British and German interests in the South
Seas had taken place.
On the 19th December, only four days later, your Excellency informed me by
telegraph that you had received an intimation from Prince Bismarck that the German flag
had been hoisted at three places on the north coast of New Guinea, and at ten places
in New Britain, New Ireland, and Sable Land; and on the 26th I received an official
communication from the German Ambassador to the same effect.
His Excellency has further informed me, as you will have learnt from my Despatch
of the 31st ultimo, that he is instructed to state that his Government do not consider the
establishment by them of this Protectorate to be prejudicial to the proposed Commission
any more than the establishment of the British Protectorate on the south-east coast can
be so considered.
You will have learnt from my Despatch of the 3rd inst., that I have since had a
further communication from the German Ambassador in explanation of the course
pursued by his Government, and that I have informed his Excellency that Her Majesty’s
Government cannot acquiesce in the interpretation which the German Government put
upon the negotiations which have passed between the two Governments on the subject
of New Guinea.
In view of the action of the German Government, instructions have been sent to the
Commodore on the Australian station desiring him to proclaim the Queen’s Protectorate in
New Guinea from East Cape to the Gulf of Huon, which is understood to be the limit of
the German annexations, and over the Louisiade and Woodlark groups of islands. The
D’Entrecasteaux islands are included in the previous proclamation.
I have now to request your Excellency to notify to the German Government the steps
taken by Her Majesty’s Government to extend Her Majesty’s Protectorate in New Guinea.
In doing so, your Excellency will explain the view taken by Her Majesty’s Government
of the late negotiations, adding that the recent action of Her Majesty’s Government has
been prompted in a great measure by the desire to obviate all the inconveniences that
might arise from an absence of jurisdiction on the coast of New Guinea between the limits
of the British and German Protectorates.
You are, moreover, empowered to say that, should the German Government still desire
it, Her Majesty’s Government are ready, with a view to clearing up the question, and
removing chances of differences between the two Governments, to proceed with the
proposed Commission for the consideration of questions affecting British and German
interests in the Pacific.
Her Majesty’s Government have recently received reports that a treaty has been signed
between the Representatives of Germany and the King of Samoa, and you will inform
the German Government, with reference to these proceedings, that Her Majestj 7 ’s
L 4


Government fully rely on the assurances which have been exchanged between the two
Governments in regard to the independence of Samoa and Tonga, and anticipate that
any treaty which may have been signed will not be ratified, so far as it may be incon-
sistent with those assurances.
It is desirable that your Excellency should endeavour to ascertain more precisely the
extent of the territory which has been occupied by Germany on the coast of New
Guinea.
I am, &c.

Telegraphic.
19th January 1885. —I cannot sanction dispatch steamer. As there is no question here
respecting national feeling Samoa, no ground for Colonial inquiry. In important speech
Saturday Prince Bismarck mentioned agreement binding England and Germany
maintain status quo in Samoa, and Colonial action would be regarded as breach of
agreement, and might lead to immediate annexation by Germany. If action of Colonial
Government does not preclude, Her Majesty’s Government will, as far as possible,
at approaching Conference secure British interests.

Enclosure in No. 134.
“ Nelson,” at Sydney,
Sm, December 2, 1884.
In continuation of my letter of the 11th November* I have the honour to report
the further steps taken by me in connexion with the establishment of a British
Protectorate over the southern shores of New Guinea.
1. On my return to Port Moresby on the 11th November, I found the barque
“ Conference,” which I had chartered before my departure from Sydney, had arrived
with 558 tons of coal, which enabled me to complete the ships, and to land about 120
tons for future use.
2. Having received a report from Mr. G. F. Hely, Government Agent of the
schooner “ Elsea,” which vessel had arrived during my absence, I held an investigation
into the circumstances, all the particulars of which are enclosed herewith, and I decided
to embark the natives, 26 in number, from that vessel, and to return them to their
homes.
3. Having completed the coaling arrangements and other matters, I despatched the
“Espiegle ” on the 15th November, with the Rev. Mr. Chalmers, to collect the Chiefs
in the neighbourhood of Hood Bay, and on Monday the 17th I left Port Moresby in
H.M.S. “ Nelson,” and arrived and anchored in Hood Bay, off the village of Kerepunu,
the same afternoon, having the “ Espiegle,” “ Dart,” and “ Swinger ” in company.
4. Here I had some difficulty in selecting a single representative Chief for this exten-
sive and important region, but finally determined to appoint two, viz., Kiniope, the
principal Chief of Kerepunu, for the harbour and tribes in the vicinity, and Koapena,
the powerful and influential Chief of Aroma, for the extensive districts to the eastward
of Hood Bay.
5. Having read my address to the Chiefs on board the “ Nelson,” and presented those
mentioned above with their staff of office, I took occasion to speak to them, more
especially with reference to their tribal quarrels, which are continually occurring, and
as the Chief of Hula was present, and as that tribe had within the last few days returned
from a raid against Kapa-Kapa, and had a few hours before Captain Bridge’s visit
{see his report) burnt that village and killed some of the inhabitants to pay off an old
score, I exhorted him to keep peace in the future. His answer was decidedly pertinent:
“ Suppose Kapa-Kapa killed Hula man, am [ not to kill Kapa-Kapa man in return ?”
“ I said, “ Certainly not. Queen Victoria desires to prevent bloodshed amongst those
“ she is taking under her protection.” After much deliberation, the old fighting Chief
said, “ Well, it shall be peace, and peace for ever and ever.” I only hope he may keep
his promise. Another tribal war was actually going on at the time of my visit between
Kalo and an inland tribe Quiapo, in which the Chief of Kalo, the son of the man killed
on the occasion of the “ Wolverene’s” visit, was killed, and several others wounded.
6. After the palaver, two shells were fired at extreme elevation, together witn several
rounds from the machine guns, which evidently created a considerable'impression. The

natives were all more or less excited, and Koapena, who is a Chief of Chiefs, and has great
influence and power, as the last shell burst, harangued his countrymen; said, “ There !
“ Did I not tell you to make friends with these foreigners ? Look what they can
“Jdo ! Am I not the only Chief, &c. &c.” The flag was hoisted on the 18th November
in the village of Kerepunu, with the usual formalities ; and I sailed in the afternoon for
Argyle Bay, where I arrived at 11 a.m. on the following day, in company with “Espidgle,”
“ Dart,” “ Raven,” and “ Swinger.”
7. I selected this place principal!} 7 on account of its magnificent harbour in preference
to Toulon Island, which I had originally thought of, but as Toulon Island is thickly
populated by a wild set of fellows, I considered it expedient to send Captain Bridge
with Mr. Chalmers to read the proclamation to them, and to bring the Chiefs of that
island to me if practicable. Captain Bridge carried out this duty with his accustomed
tact and ability, but was unable to persuade the Chiefs to come. I trust, however, that
his visit will have a good effect in restraining the quarrelsome propensities of these
people, who have a bad name along the coast, and who have quite recently been in
collision with the crew of an English “ bochc-dc-mer ” vessel, the particulars of which I
was unable to obtain.
8. This was the only instance where the Chiefs showed great apprehension, my address
was read to them in the fore cabin, where they sat clutching each other’s hands, every
sound seemed to fill them with terror, and when the palaver was concluded they lost no
time in tumbling into their canoes ; nothing would induce them to remain to partake of
the food which had been prepared for them, and although they said it was very good,
and called me their father, and made use of expressions of friendship, they were, never-
theless, uncommonly glad to depart.
9- On the 20th November, the flag was hoisted in a prominent and picturesque
position in one of the numerous villages that cluster round this magnificent bay, with
the usual formalities. From here I despatched the “ Raven ” to Cooktown, in order
that I might receive any telegrams or further instructions (which might have arrived
there) before my departure from the New Guinea Coast.
10. Leaving Argyle Bay at 1 p.m., I proceeded to South Cape, where I arrived at
5 p.m., and anchored, in company with the “ Espiegle,” “ Dart,” and “ Swinger,” off
the mission station at Stacey Island.
11. Having interviewed the Chiefs in the usual manner, Manuega, the Chief of South
Cape, complained that his friend Dalabu, from Catamaran Bay, had been taken away,
and Paena of Sapauri stated that his younger brother Kodeaba had also been taken in
a labour vessel, and requested me to implore Her Majesty to send them back. The
spontaneous manner in which these men preferred their request, without the slightest
prompting, and immediately the purport of my address had been explained to them,
was the stongest evidence that they had understood the words of my address, and
showed the depth of their feeling with regard to their missing friends and relatives.
The flag was hoisted on the 21st, at the mission station on Stacey Island, with the
usual formalities, Manuega being invested with an armlet as his badge of office, my
stock of sticks having become exhausted.
12. A party in pursuit of botanical treasures, for which this neighbourhood is
remarkable, headed by Captain Bridge, and under the escort and direction of the
Rev. Mr. Chalmers, here made the ascent of Cloudy mountain, 4,000 feet above the
level of the sea, and the Union Jack was planted on its hitherto unsealed summit.
13. From here I despatched-Captain Bridge in the “ Espi6gle ” to Moresby Island
(Basilaki), to land the escapees belonging to that island, and to endeavour to bring the
Chiefs to meet me at Dinner Island, to which place I proceeded on the 23rd November.
During this intricate passage I caused the “ Swinger ” to keep four cables ahead of
the “ Nelson,” and to sound, and passing between Blanchard and Heath Islands, I
entered the China Straits, and anchored off Dinner Island at 3 p.m., the “ Dart ”
having passed to the westward of Heath Island without discovering the Heath reefs
laid down on the chart.
14. Having assembled the Chiefs, and having read my address, Kapoiani, of Ha}’ter
Island, complained that two of his sons, married, and living at Connor Island, were taken
away in some ship on the understanding that they were to be returned immediately,
and they have not been brought back, although it is many “ moons ” ago.
15. On the morning of the 24th, the “ Espibgle ” returned from Basilaki with the
touching report concerning the landing of the escapees ( see enclosure). I certainly
was not surprised to find that the Chiefs, whose emotions must have been severely tried,


could not be persuaded, in the moment of their excitement, to leave their island, to
trust themselves to the tender mercies of the white man.
16. The flag was hoisted at Dinner Island on the 24th, with the usual formalities ;
Tokema, Chief of Hayter Island, being invested with the badge of office.
17. The ceremony being concluded, I despatched the “ Swinger,” with the Rev. Mr.
Chalmers, to collect the Chiefs in Milne Bay, and to return the escapees belonging to
that neighbourhood. The “ Espihgle ” remained at Dinner Island, and I sent the
“ Dart ” to the Killerton islands to select a suitable anchorage for the “ Nelson/ where
I arrived at 4 p.m.; the “ Swinger ” arrived at 10 p.m., and on the following morning
the flag was hoisted on the easternmost Killerton Island, with the usual formalities, and
the Chiefs belonging to the East Cape district, as well as those from Milne Bay, were
afterwards assembled on board the “ Nelson.”
18. Here Isaaka, Chief of Barabara, East Cape, complained that five men had been
taken in a ship, and Jeremia also stated that one had been taken from Dadui, and had
not returned. Iposu also made a similar complaint (see “ Swinger’s” Report). At
this interview I took the opportunity of addressing a few words of advice to them all
on the subject of cannibalism, a practice which 1 exhorted them to give up, and to
live at peace with their neighbours. The subject was a delicate one, especially to
Imogoton, Chief of Rabi, who had only the day before attacked a neighbouring village
for the simple purpose of killing and eating somebody. Two men and one woman
were killed, and the bodies of the men were reserved for the feast, that of the woman
thrown away, and Imogoton had probably just risen from his disgusting meal when he
was picked up by the Rev. Mr. Chalmers and brought on board the “ Swinger.”
19. After the ceremony the “Dart” was detached to return the Milne Bay Chiefs,
and the “ Swinger,” being no longer required, I despatched that vessel, having com-
pleted her with coal and provisions, to the Duke of York and New Britain groups,
with orders to return to Port Moresby on completion of that service.
20. I then weighed, and passing through the China Straits, picked up the “ Espiegle ’ ’
and “ Raven,” and proceeded with them to Teste Island, where we arrived and anchored
at 6 p.m. The “ Dart ” also arrived at 10 p.m. On the 25th, the flag was hoisted for
the ninth and last time, with the usual formalities, on the north shore of the island, and
the Chiefs assembled on board afterwards, when I handed over an armlet to Buobuno,
who represented his father, the principal Chief on the island.
21. Maige.na here complained that three of his relations had been taken in a ship, and
had not been returned. I informed them that I was aware that many “ boys ” from
New Guinea had been taken away to Queensland, and that as in each case of the visits
of the labour vessels, Teste island people had been the interpreters between the white
men and the natives, and had, in fact, induced the natives to recruit; they were them-
selves responsible for the continued absence of many of their friends, and could not be
held free from blame if the nature of the engagements into which they had entered had
not been properly explained to the New Guinea natives.
22. In connexion with tliis subject, I cannot refrain from mentioning that I was

requisition than bibles or h} 7 mn books, the grim humour of this gift and the words of
the inscription will be fully realised.
23. Having completed the “ Raven ” with coals and provisions, I ordered Lieutenant-
Commander Ross to convey Mr. Chalmers to Port Moresby, calling at South Cape
and Dufaure Island; and on arrival there, to bear (sic) Mr. Deputy Commissioner Romilly,
the “ Harrier ” returning to Sydney to change crews. The “ Dart ” proceeded to
Cooktown to convey my telegram, No. 9, reporting the conclusion of the mission
with which I had been entrusted, and I sent H.M.S. “Espiegle” to Port Moresby
to inform Mr. Romilly of my departure from the New Guinea Coast, and at 2 p.m.
on the 26th of November, I left Teste Island for Sydney in H.M. ship “ Nelson,” where,
after a favourable passage, we arrived at 5 a.m. this day.

24. It will be seen by my report that several Chiefs of New Guinea have complained
to me that many of their friends have been taken away by labour vessels to Queensland,
and have not been returned, and they have furnished me with some of their names.
25. As the officer delegated to make known Her Majesty’s Protectorate, I desire to
transmit formally to Her Majesty’s Government the request which has been made to me
by these Chiefs, viz., to implore Her Majesty to cause all natives living within the
limits of the Protectorate, and who are engaged on Queensland plantations to be returned
to their homes. This request appears to me to be both just and reasonable. There
can be no doubt whatever that the natives of New Guinea and adjacent islands
recruited to Queensland believed that they were to be returned in three months, and
had no idea as to the true nature of their agreements, and the fact remains that the
natives consider that they have been deceived, and injured by the white man.
26. I enclose a return* which was furnished at my request by the Queensland Govern-
ment, by which it will be seen that, up to the 30th June of this year, 101 natives had
been recruited from Moresby Island, 112 from the Eastern Louisiades, and 206 from
the Western Louisiades. It must be remarked that the list of those recruited at
Moresby in all probability includes a number from the mainland, and also that the names
furnished to Captain Bridge at Moresby Island only represented the names of those
belonging to the villages in the neighbourhood of Hoop Iron Bay.
27. The establishment of the Protectorate which it has been my privilege to proclaim
has been well received by the natives of New Guinea, and starts under favourable
circumstances. There arc no land claims or other complications to unravel or decide ;
there is no foreign element to disturb our administration, and no intoxicating liquors or
fire-arms have as yet been introduced; and, lastly, the natives have shown implicit
confidence, and trust in the protecting arm of Great Britain, and in the justice and
humanity which they look for at her hands. I therefore urgently appeal to Her
Majesty’s Government to remove the only obstacle which remains in the way of friendly
relations, and the just cause of complaint which they would otherwise continue to
foster, and which they would not unnaturally in all probability take every opportunity
to revenge.

“ Espiegle,” at Port Moresby,
Sir, November 22, 1884.
I have the honour to report that I left Sydney in Her Majesty’s ship under my
command on Sunday, 19th October, and arrived at Moreton Bay on the 23rd. Having
completed with coal, I left again the next day, and, passing inside the Barrier Reef
without anchoring, arrived at Cooktown on 30th October.
2. The periodical full speed trial was carried out on 27th October, when the engines
worked perfectly, the alterations in the bearings having proved altogether successful,

I have the honour to report that I left Port Moresby at 5.20 a.m. yesterday, and
proceeded to Kapa-Kapa, where I anchored at 1.20 p.m.
2. In the night, a few hours before our arrival, one of the two villages which compose
Kapa-Kapa had been attacked and burned down by the Hula people, who killed three
and wounded 11 of the inhabitants, without loss to themselves. This was in revenge for
an unprovoked murder of a Hula man a fortnight ago. The people of the remaining
village were much excited and frightened at our appearance, and embarked their women

and children and goods in canoes for conveyance to the shore, as their houses stand on
piles in the water upwards of 100 yards from the beach. The Reverend Mr. Chalmers
soon induced the Chiefs to go ou board, and I sent off some of the wounded, who were
attended by Slaff-Surgeon Irvine. His care of them had the best effect and fully
restored confidence.
3. I left Kapa-Kapa at 3.45 p.m., and anchored for the night off Kaile, receiving on
board the Chief and teacher. This morning I proceeded to Tupusilei, and after com-
municating, went on to Port Moresby, where I arrived at 11.30 s.m. to-day.

Sir, November 17, 1884.
1 have the honour to report that I left Port Moresby at 5.45 a.m. on
15th November, and, having to steam against a fresh breeze and head sea after clearing
the barrier, did not reach Hood Bay till 5 p.m. 1 sent a boat at once to begin sounding
the channel towards the village of Kerepunu; and when the breeze had subsided the
Reverend Mr. Chalmers went on in the whaler to communicate with the Chiefs of
Aroma.
2. To avoid as much as possible the head sea caused by the recent long-continued
south-east wind, lat first took the inside route. The weather became so dull, clouds
of mist collecting about the low hills near the shore, that the light proved unfavourable,
and, although in addition to the navigating officer, who was conning the ship from aloft,
a man was at the masthead and a signalman was stationed as a special look-out man on
the forctopsail yard, whilst both leadsmen were placed well forward. 1 was obliged to
go outside, taking the passage by which the ship entered on the 4th instant.
3. On approaching the passage the helm was starboarded to clear a reef, when the
ship rubbed against a small patch on the port side, which, even when close to, was very
indistinetty seen. The diver has now been down to examine the bottom. He reports a
broad rub, as though occasioned by some soft white substance, apparently young coral,
along the port side, inclining downwards ; but, beyond one or two small abrasions, the
copper is not injured and no sheet will require replacing.
4. At I p.m. on Sunday, the channel having been buoyed, I weighed and proceeded
further in, mooring immediately opposite the village. The Kalo Chiefs, except one who
had been killed on Wednesday in an unsuccessful attack on the stronghold of an inland
tribe, came in during the afternoon, and Mr. Chalmers returned, bringing the Chief
Kaopena during the evening.

alongside, and the principal Chief, Yerabe, came on board. At first he was much
frightened but was soon at his ease. .
2. Accompanied by Mr. Chalmers and Yerabe 1 landed at the village Mailiu-para,
and assembling the Chiefs and leading inhabitants read the accompanying address, a
translation of which was immediately afterwards read by the teacher Terai.
3. The people appeared to thoroughly understand what was said to them, saying so
when asked if they needed explanation of any part of it. They seemed to be greatly
pleased with the announcement made, especially the prohibition of wars. One old man
was so delighted with this that he repeated several times, that it w T as good, and folded
me in his arras. Yerabe and his people promised to make known what had been told
to them, to the natives of Dedele and the neighbouring coast.

Verabe and other Chiefs of Mailiu-Kolo.
I have come here to tell you that Queen Victoria has sent one of her great Chiefs,
the Commodore, to proclaim that this part of New Guinea is henceforward to be under
the protection of Great Britain. The Commodore has already proclaimed the Protec-
torate at several places. He has now gone further east with four men-of-war, one of
them many times as big as the man-of-war in which I have come here.
This is the meaning of what is being done:—The people of New Guinea will be
protected by Queen Victoria; no one, whether a white man or not, will be allowed to
lake your land from you; no one will be allowed to injure your wives and children ;
no one will be allowed to take you, against your wishes, away from your homes. There
is- to be no war between your tribe and any other, .If you have any misunderstanding
with any other tribe you are to refer the matter to the first of Queen Victoria’s officers
who may come to your country. Righting will certainly bring punishment upon those
who begin it. You are to treat all white men whom Queen Victoria may allow to
dwell amongst you in a proper manner. Any injury done to them will be punished.
If you have any complaint to make against a white man you are on no account to act
against him yourselves ; but you are to make it known to the Captain of a British man-
of-war or other white Chief as soon as possible.
If any person comes to ask you to buy fire-arms, gunpowder, intoxicating liquors,
you are not to buy from them, but are to make known the matter to the first British
man-of-war you see. If any white man wants you to sell your land to him you are not
to do so.
Queen Victoria wishes you to become her children, and that you and your wives and
little ones may be peaceful and happy.
You are to look upon all Chiefs whom she may send to you as your friends. Her
Chiefs will always be friendly with those who behave well, and it will be their duty to
punish those who wilfully do wrong.

“ Espiegle,” at Dinner Island,
Sir, , November 24, 1884.
I have the honour to report that I left South Cape at 6 a.in. on 23rd November,
and anchored in Hoop Iron Bay the same afternoon. The Rev. Mr. Chalmers accom-
panied me on shore to the village of Moni-a-tau-ari, and two of the natives being
forwarded by you to their homes, went with us. We were received in the most friendly
and indeed grateful manner by the people of Basilaki. The meeting with their long-
lost relatives and friends was truly affecting. They explained to us that they had given
them up for dead, and that we had brought them back from the grave.
2. Three Chiefs, Ta-eusi-a-ha, who has a son still absent, supposed to be in Queens-
land, Go-ko-re-re, and Nau-na-sara returned with me to the ship, when I read the pro-
clamation proclaiming the Protectorate, Mr. Chalmers read to them a translation of it
into their own language. 'On being assured that they understood the meaning of it, I
made them the address enclosed. TK leturn of their friends is thoroughly appreciated
by these people. On hearing that the " Espiegle’s ” stay would be short they said they
would be ashamed if she left before they could send on board a present of at least a
pig. They collected with surprising quickness a considerable present of vegetables,
fruit, a large pig, &c., and brought it on board.
3. The natives state that there arc still absent of the party to which those just
returned belonged the following:—
Tu-qua-quada. Goi-la-uai.
Muku-muku. ‘ Ta-nu-vai-sina.
Tu-au. Vai-o-iot6.
To-mi-lcsi. Borekava.
Tau-ka-bai. Badu-e-sai.
Hai-da-va. ' Ka-enia-una.
Tau-no-i-a. Ta-ua-si.
Ua-ko-mo. Sai-de.
They begged me to try and procure their return, and I told them that you would
do all that you could for them, and that the Chiefs had better go with me to sec you.
After some time, Si-mi-ro-ro, said to be an important Chief, undertook to come; but as
he did not appear during the night Mr. Chalmers went on shore this morning to try and
induce him to come, but without success. Another Chief, Bailele, at first told me he


would come, but as soon as the ship moved ahead he went back into his canoe. Under
the circumstances it is not surprising that the Chiefs who have not got over the
excitement consequent on the recent return of their long-lost friends should wish not to
leave home at this moment, though assured of a safe return. There can be no doubt
of their gratitude.
4. Mr. Chalmers and I were shown the new and well-built native house of a white
man. Captain Miller (?), who had stayed with them seven moons collecting birds. He
came over from Teste Island in a schooner-rigged boat, and had left only a day or two
before our visit. He had three native servants. The Basilaki people remember H.M.S.
“ Basilisk ” well, and that she was a paddle-wheel steamer. They showed us, unasked,
where she had anchored.
5. I left Hoop Iron Bay at 6.30 a.m., and arrived here at 9-0 a.m. to-day.

To-day you see how your good will be cared for now that you are under the

here for no other purpose than to bring back your friends. You must promise me that
you will live at peace, make no wars on other tribes, and do what Queen Victoria’s
Chiefs tell you. If you have any cause of complaint against a white man you are on
no account to act against him yourselves, but must bring the matter to the notice of the
first of Queen Victoria’s Chiefs who comes here.

Address of the Commodore, delivered on board H.M.S. “Nelson,” the 17th day of
November 1884.
Keniope, Koapena, and Chiefs of Kerepunu, Aroma, and other districts, —
I have asked you to come on board to-day in order that I may explain to you about
the ceremony which will take place to-morrow on shore. I have been sent to this place
to notify and proclaim that Her Majesty the Queen has established a Protectorate over
the southern shores of New Guinea, and in token of that event I am directed to hoist
the British flag at Port Moresby and at other places along the coast and islands;
therefore I intend to hoist the British flag here, and to read a Proclamation which will
be dulv translated to you in your own language, and copies of which I hope to be able
to send you printed in your own language, and in the meantime an English copy will
be given to each Chief for the information of your people.
♦I desire on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen to explain to you the meaning of the
ceremonial which you are about to witness. It is a proclamation that from this time
forth you are placed under the protection of Her Majesty’s Government, that evil-
disposed men will not be permitted to occupy your country, to seize your lands, or to
take you away from your own homes. I have been instructed to say to you that what
you have seen done here to-day on board Her Majesty’s ship of war, and which will be
done again on shore, is to give you the strongest assurance of Her Majesty’s gracious
protection of you, and to warn bad and evil-disposed men that if they attempt to do you
harm they will be promptly punished by the officers of the Queen. Your lands will be
secured to you. Your wives and children will be protected.
Should any injury be done to you, you wdll immediately inform Her Majesty’s officers
who will reside amongst you, and they will hear your complaints and do justice. You
will look upon all white persons whom the Queen permits to reside amongst you as
your friends and Her Majesty’s subjects. The Queen will permit nobody' to reside here
who does you injury. You will under no circumstances inflict punishment yourselves
upon any white person; but if such person has done you wrong, you will tell Her
Majesty’s officers of that wrong, in order that the case may be fairly inquired into. You
must lenow that it is for your protection and security and to prevent bloodshed that the
Queen sends me here to you, and will send her officers to live amongst you; and now
I hope that you all clearly understand that we are here as your friends. You will all
keep peace amongst yourselves, and if you have disputes with each other you will bring
them before the Queen’s officers, who will settle them for you without bloodshed.
Should bad men come amongst you bringing fire-arms and gunpowder and intoxicating
liquors, you are not to buy them; and are to give notice at once to the Queen’s officers,
so that such men may be punished. Always keep in your, minds that the Queen guards
and watches over you —looks upon you as her children, and will not allow any one to
harm you; and will soon send her trusted officers to carry out her gracious intentions
in the establishment of this Protectorate.
Keniope and Koapena were here presented with a stick as an emblem of their
authority.

on board to be delivered at the following places : —Conner’s Island (1), Milne Bay (5),
Bentley Bay (1), Ferguson Island (l), Harris Island (1), Normanby Island (1). While
at Thursday Island, I received instructions from Mr. Chester, P.M., to take 12 New
Guinea islanders, runaways, from the Johnstone River to Basilisk Island. On arrival at

sailing for that purpose in the course of the day.

Sir, November 12, 1884.
With reference to your letter of this date, I have the honour to request that
you will land with the New Guinea recruits who escaped from Queensland plantations,

“ Nelson.” Port Moresby,
Sir, November 12, 1884.
With reference to your letter of this date, informing me of the arrival at Port
Moresby of the schooner “ Elsea ” with 26 New Guinea boys on board, and that you have
been instructed by the Queensland Government to return 10 of them, physically unfit,
to their homes at various islands on the eastern coast of New Guinea, and considering
the great risk involved in landing these natives, who have been taken to Queensland
without knowledge of the nature of their agreement, and the great probability of
reprisals which might naturally be expected, owing to the hostile and revengeful feeling


thereby engendered, which, if exerted against a small vessel such as the “ Elsea/’
drifting about in the calms prevalent at this season of the year, would probably end in a
wholesale massacre of the crew if suddenly attacked by an overwhelming number of
exasperated savages; it is my direction to you to discharge the said natives of New
Guinea into Her Majesty’s ship under my command for conveyance to their homes.
You are to send me a complete list, setting forth the names of the said natives with all
information in your possession with respect, to the precise locality from whence they
came.
I have, &c.
(Signed) James E. Erskine,
H. L. Warren, Secretary. Commodore.
P. —Having in view that the expense of returning these natives to their homes falls
on Messrs. Burns, Philip and Co., and that Her Majesty’s ship under my command is not
supplied with provisions suitable for these natives, you will direct the Captain of the
“ Elsea ” to send with them regulation rations, say for three weeks.

Q. 17. How did the white men treat the natives of the places they called at while

Q. 18. Name places where this happened?— A. Bentley Bay; they took a woman
and a boy from a village called Yadi. At Teste Island the woman escaped from the
ship. She escaped by letting herself down by a rope, and swimming on shore. She
had no wound on head.
Q. 19. Was she for plantation work, or what?— Q. They said she was to be the
cook’s wife; she slept with the cook, who was a black man.
Q. 20. How was it done, the getting of the man and woman ? where were the men of
the village ? was the woman alone on the beach ? — A. The woman and boy were in
a canoe, and went alongside of the boats. The men of the village were feasting; it was
feast time.
Having got the woman on board, they (the natives on shore) told her husband that
his wife was on board, and he said he would go too, but he had an ulcer on his leg, and
he was sent back. The schooner pillaged and burnt the village. Both boats from
schooner were armed.
Q. 21. Why did they burn village ?— A. There was no cause.
Q. 22. Next village touched at, what happened there ?— A. They did nothing cruel
there. They got five men, gave hatchets, &c., in payment for services, same as at
Milne Bay.
The next place after that men refused to come on board when asked. Schooner
people then got rifles to make them do so. Natives then ran away. Schooner men then
fired at them ; they did so from boats ; one man and one woman killed dead; we saw it
from ship plainly. Nobody was recruited. We then went to Normanby Island.
Q. 23. What happened there ? — A. When we got near the land natives came off in
big canoe ; came alongside to trade. Schooner men fired. Natives all crowded to one
side. Canoe capsized. Natives swam for shore. Boats lowered from schooner gave
chase and picked them up, nine were taken alive, three shot dead, one is here present.
The bodies of the natives who were shot were washed on shore.
The man mentioned as being present was examined and stated as follows, viz.,
I went to ship to trade and get foreign things. What happened has been told you by
Konaga. 1 swam awa} 7 ; the boat caught me, and took me on board. I would not have
ironc on board; I could not help it.
Q. 24. Are you afraid to go home ? will you be killed on account of others missing ?
— A. No, lam not afraid; they won’t kill me; those who w r ere shot were my own
relatives.
Konaga again called, stated.
We went to another village, same island, but a good distance off. Schooner people
traded, bought vegetables and fruit, and remained there that night. Next morning
schooner people went on shore in two boats and traded again, remained that night also.
Third morning, -went ashore again. Wanted people To go on board. Natives w r ere
suspicious, would not go. The natives then armed themselves with spears. The white
men armed themselves with rifles.


The natives used their spears; — results one white man wounded. White men fired, and
a native was killed.
There were no recruits taken at this place.
Went to another place where there were three large villages, they did nothing wrong
there, gave hatchets, &c. Recruited a great number.
Went to another small village called “ Saunaroi,” Harris Island. A native was shot
here, because white men were angry with the natives for asking for too much trade.
A native of “ Saunaroi ” was present, but being interrogated, nothing could be elicited
from him, the interpreter not being able to comprehend his particular language.
Konaga re-examined.
Q. 25. How many natives did you see killed altogether while you were on board
the schooner? — A. I.cannot count now. I should have to count up each village.
At Saunaroi there were seven in canoe. One was shot dead. The canoe made off.
Schooner’s boats chased it, overtook it, and took remaining six natives on board and
kept them. One of these six was wounded also ; he was cared for, but died from effect
of wounds afterwards, on board the schooner. Of the remaining five, one is here, and
four still in Queensland.
Went to another village ; two men swam off, and were taken on board; they thought
it a good ship. Others were also recruited by trade presents.
The schooner was now full of natives for Queensland labour.
No one was ill-treated while on board, and they received plenty of rice, &c.
Q. 26. If you, any of you, were landed from the “ Elsea ” at any of those places.
Could you get home ? say, Barrabarra, for instance ?— A. All would be near home,
except two Saunaroi boys (Harris Island).
In regard to the escapees, they all belonged to “ Basilaki” (Moresby Island).
The captain of the schooner that recruited them was Captain Wawn, of the “ Lizzie.”
She has two masts.
A chief called “ Kedalavan,” one of the escapees, called and examined. He belonged
to “ Yireari,” Basilaki, Moresby Island.
Q. 27. What happened to you all! tell me a story of it, just as if you were recounting
it to one of your own head chiefs?— A. The boat went off to trade. We were deceived
by the Yarn men (Teste Island), who said we would only be away two moons. I went
on board, so all the other boys went too. There were a lot of other boys, too, from
Basilaki, about 26 in all recruited there.
There was nobody shot, but we were all very hungry ; not enough food; we w T ere ail
under the impression that it was only for two moons.
Kedalavan said captain was a bad man ; not enough given to eat, and was in the habit
of beating natives with a rope.
Concerning the later Jive escapees.
Q. 28. Were they recruited in the same ship ?— A. Yes, and made the trip the same
time.
Q. 29. Were you all* (escapees) on the same plantation ? — A. Yes.
Q. 30. When did you all find out that you would have to be a long time in Queensland,
and not two moons only ?— A. Nothing was said during the voyage ; when we arrived,
Varri Boys (Teste Island) told us we must stay three years niaking sugar, and then we
should be sent home.
Q. 31. When you found that out, why did you not make remonstrance I—A.1 — A. When
w r e heard three years, we all wept bitterly, and said, “We have been cruelly deceived.
You gave us to understand two moons, whereas we find we must remain three years,”
Q. 32. Were the names of the recruits taken by the captain of the schooner in which
you were recruited ?— A. Yes.
Q. 33. On arrival at Townsville, a gentleman came on board and told you all bff to
different plantations; why did you not then complain ? — A. A gentleman did come
on board and informed us we were to remain three years, reading out our names and
plantations; when we heard it was three years we began to cry, and the gentleman
said “ Don’t cry, don’t cry.”
Q. 34. Why did you run away from plantation ?—lt was on account of death on
the nlantation. So many dying, and we were beaten; on that account we ran away.
Q. 35. Are there many New Guinea boys on the plantations ? — A. A great many,
brought before us in other vessels ; we were surprised to see our countrymen there.
O 2


Q. 36. Was plantation near the sea? — A. A long way inland.
Q. 37. Did you come down a river from it, or walk ? — A. Walked. (When we went'
to the plantation, we went in steamer, and either tram or train).
Q. 38. Was plantation on the banks of a river; if so, what distance off?—A. No.
We came overland, and got a Chinaman’s boat (Ist boat) in the river. At daylight we
reached the sea.
Q. 39- There was a second boat used by some of you, in which there was a gun ;
how did it come there ?— A. The reply to this question was vague. The gun appeared
to have been in the Chinaman’s boat (Ist boat), was taken from them by the Murray
Islanders. Murray Island being about 550 miles from the Johnstone River.
Q. 40. What was in the second boat ?— A. Rollocks, oars (a pumpkin, two bags
potatoes, their own), several empty bottles taken'from plantation.
Q. 41. Had you any water? — A. Yes; we saved the empty bottles taken from
white man and filled them with water.
Q. 42. How many bottles had you ?— A. Three to each man.
Each boat was about six days on the passage to Murray Island.
The second boat arrived at Murray Island on the 17th October 1884.
Q. 43. Did any other boat besides get away from Queensland ?— A. Don’t know of
any other boat.
Q. 44. Wore there any New Guinea boys left in Queensland when you left ?
A. Yes, plenty New Guinea boys and others.
Q. 45, How do you like plantation life ?— A. When in own land could work well,
but on plantation “ all cry,” work bad, eat nothing, only food in morning, work, work,
all day, in evening too tired to eat panakin of rice.
Q. 46. Is there anything you, or any of you would like to ask me ?— A. If we can
be taken back to our land we shall be very glad, but, if our countrymen left behind in
Queensland could be sent home too, we would be very thankful, and when you come
to our country we will give you plenty pigs.
Q. 47. Were all the recruits in Queensland deceived as to the length of time they had
to remain there ?—Yes, all same us.

The Gertnan Ambassador called to-day at this Office, and left an “Aide
Memoire ” on the subject of New Guinea, a translation of which is enclosed for your
Excellency’s information.
Count Munster at the same time communicated verbally the contents of a Despatch
which he had received from his Government to the following effect;
His Excellency was instructed to say that there was a misunderstanding as to the
import of Mr. Scott’s note of October 9-
The German Government understood from that note, which was supplementary to that
of September 17, that Her Majesty’s Government had limited their Protectorate to the
south-east coast of New Guinea, and that Germany was free to establish a Protectorate


on the north-east coast, which would in no way conflict with British interests and
projects.
His Excellency was moreover instructed to point out that his Government had
previously intimated that the north-east coast of New Guinea would be a suitable place
for the development of German interests.
I am, &c.

Translation.
Aide respecting the Negotiations between Germany and England
relating to ‘New Guinea.
1. As early as June of last year, an association of German subjects intimated to the
Imperial Government, that they were about to carry out on the north-east coast of New
Guinea, and in the archipelago of New Britain an undertaking which had been already
in contemplation in the year 1880, but had been deferred under the impression produced
by the refusal of the Samoa proposals.
They coupled therewith an application that the protection of the Imperial Government
might be granted them for their undertaking to the same extent as is accorded to German
enterprises in West Africa This application was complied with on the part of the
Imperial Government; the German Consular officers and Naval commanders in the South
Sea were, even at this early stage, empowered to place under the protection of His Majesty
the Emperor, the independent territories on the north coast of New Guinea, eastward
from the Dutch frontier, as well as those in the archipelago of New Britain where
German settlements existed, or where acquisitions of land had been effected by German
subjects.
By means of an instruction to the Imperial Ambassador in London, of August 2nd,
the Imperial Government expressed to the Royal Government of Great Britain the wish
to come to an understanding with it respecting a delimitation of the sphere of jurisdiction
of both Powers throughout the South Sea, and respecting the principles to be made
applicable by each party to the subjects of the other party. With regard to New
Guinea, it was expressly observed that the Imperial Government regarded, it is true, the
wish of the Australians to possess the independent portion of the southern coast of
the island, situated opposite the Colony of Queensland, as justified, but held a similar
pretention to the north-east coast as not justified.
In an abstract point of view, the independent portions of New Guinea might with
equal justice become the objects of either German or English enterprises. The Imperial
Government contemplated, as was the case in West Africa, so also in the South Sea,
placing under the protection of the Empire such territories as through the predominating
extension of German trade, or in consequence of preparations for the same, should appear
suitable for such a purpose.
According to the report of the Imperial Ambassador in London, of August 9 of last
year, reporting his execution of the above instructions, Lord Granville had consented to
the suggestion of the Imperial Government for a friendly discussion. With regard to
New Guinea, he intimated confidentially that the negotiations between the English
Government and the Australian Colony (Queensland), respecting the annexation of the
southern portion of New Guinea, were near conclusion.
Lord Granville further acknowledged that upon various islands the influence of
Germany, on others that of England , was predominant; that, however, there were also
islands,where the interests of both countries seemed to be equally balanced. It was
specially desirable that these should be the subject of a thorough joint examination and
understanding.
A simultaneous communication from Lord Granville, of August 9, forwarded by the
Imperial Ambassador, stated “ the extension of some form of British authority in New
“ Guinea, which will be shortly announced, will only embrace that part of the
“ which specially interests the Australian Colonies, without any prejudice to any
“ territorial questions beyond these limits.”
By a Despatch of August 31, the Imperial Government communicated its assent to
Lord Granville’s suggestion to make the question of the interests of both parties in the
South Sea the subject of examination by a Commission, The Imperial Government
nominated Dr. Krauel, the Consul-General in Sydney, and the Councillor of Legation
O 3


Dr. Stubelj the consular representative in Apia, as its Commissioners, and recommended
Levuka as the seat of the Commission, since Dr. Krauel was already under instructions
to proceed to that place as Commissioner for the adjustment of the Fiji claims.
In a note of the 17th September, the Royal British Charge d’Affaires in Berlin, on
behalf of his Government, informed the Imperial Government, to its surprise, that Her
Majesty’s Government were about to proclaim a protectorate over the entire coast line
of New Guinea not subject to Dutch sovereignty, with the single exception of the strip
of the north coast lying between the Dutch frontier and 145° east longitude.
This communication stood in contradiction to the proposals made by the Imperial
Government in August for an agreement, and to the above-mentioned communications
of Lord Granville. Baron Plessen was therefore directed, by instruction of September 25th
of last year, to inform the Gornment of Great Britain that, in view of the explanations
hitherto exchanged, the contemplated extension of the English Protectorate in the north
and north-east of New Guinea came unexpectedly upon the Imperial Government,
and that they must reserve their attitude with regard to the same. For the rest, in the
view of the Imperial Government, the discussion by the Commission might also inclnde
the delimitation of either party’s sphere of interest with relation to that stretch of
coast.
Baron von Plessen forwarded, under date of September 27, a communication from
Lord Granville of the 25th of the same month, wherein the wish was expressed that the
deliberations of the Commission in which it was intended to discuss the smaller islands
of the South Sea, should be held in Europe rather than in the immediate vicinity of
Australia. In consequence of this, the Consul-General, Dr. Krauel, was summoned to
Berlin from Sydney.
The note presented by the English Charge d’Affaires in Berlin on the 9th October
contains the express declaration that the English Government, after careful consideration
of the communication made by Baron von Plessen respecting the boundary of the English
Protectorate in New Guinea, had resolved to limit this protectorate to the southern coast
with inclusion of the adjacent islands, instead of giving to it the extension at first con-
templated. This would be done without prejudice to any territorial question beyond
these boundaries.
The note further expressed the wish that any questions which might, arise respecting
the districts of New Guinea lying outside the indicated boundaries should be settled
diplomatically lather than be referred to the Commission which it was in contemplation
to institute respecting the islands in the South Sea.
Under date of the Bth October, Baron Plessen reported that Lord Granville had
expressly reminded him that the Imperial Government recognized as justified the wish of
the Australians to guard against the establishment of a foreign Power on the southern
coast of New Guinea.
Under date of 11th October, Baron von Plessen transmitted the substance of the English
Proclamation, according to which the British Protectorate was proclaimed over the
southern coast of New Guinea, eastwards from the 141st degree of east longitude, and
over the islands lying off this stretch of coast.
In reply to a question put in Parliament on October 23 respecting the area covered by
the British Protectorate in New Guinea, the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies,
Mr. Ashley, stated that this Protectorate had been proclaimed only over the south coast
and over the adjacent islands, and that it was not at present possible to define the inland
boundaries of the English Protectorate, which would extend as far as the local conditions
might require. The Blue Book “New Guinea and the Western Pacific Islands,”
(C. 4217), contains a map which limits with clear lines the frontiers of the English
Protectorate in New Guinea to the south coast between the Dutch boundary and East
Cape, including the small islands immediately adjacent to this coast.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s • Despatch
of the 13th instant, and to enclose copies of a note which, in accordance with
the instructions conveyed therein, 1 have to-day addressed to Count von Hatzfeldt,
recapitulating the recent negotiations between the Governments of the Queen and of
the Emperor, with regard to New Guinea and the South Sea Islands, and notifying to
the Imperial Government the steps taken by Her Majesty’s Government to extend the
Queen’s Protectorate in New Guinea, and at the same time informing his Excellency
of the readiness of Her Majesty’s Government to proceed with the proposed Commission
for the consideration of the questions affecting British and German interests in the
Pacific.
I also informed his Excellency of the reliance placed by Her Majesty’s Government
in the assurances exchanged between the two Governments with regard to the
independence of Samoa and Tonga.
In a further note, copy of which I have the honour to enclose, I requested his
Excellency to be good enough to give more precise details as to the extent of the
territory recently occupied by Germany on the north coast of New Guinea.
I have, &c.

Sir E. Malet to Count Hatzfeldt.
M. le Secretaire d’Etat, Berlin, January 17 r 1885.
Earl Granville, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
has received from his Excellency Count Munster, the Imperial Ambassador in London,
a letter notifying officially to Her Majesty’s Government that the German flag has been
hoisted in token of annexation on the north coast of New Guinea, and on the islands
of the New Britain Archipelago.
Prince Bismarck, on the 19th ultimo, had already apprised me of this fact through
Dr. Busch, Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
Pier Majesty’s Government were quite unprepared for such an announcement, for
the recent negotiations with the Imperial Government, which I will briefly recapitulate,
had led them to believe that a friendly understanding had been arrived at between the
two Governments, in virtue of which neither Power would make fresh acquisitions in
the Pacific Ocean pending the meeting of the Anglo-German Commission which had
been agreed upon.
On the Bth August last the Imperial Ambassador intimated to Earl Granville the
wish of the Government of His Imperial Majesty to come to a friendly understanding
with Her Majesty’s Government as to the general principles to be observed for the
protection of the subjects of the two countries respectively in the islands of the South
Sea Archipelago, and also as to the limits of the islands and territories in which either
country was most interested.

Whilst recognising as natural the wish of the Australian Colonies to be paramount
in the part of New Guinea opposite theii; coast, his Excellency said that the Government
of the Emperor were of opinion that there were parts of the wild country on the north
coast of New Guinea which might be available as a field for German enterprise.
Earl Granville pointed out to his Excellency, however, that Germany had as yet
founded no establishments there, adding that the Government of the Emperor already
knew that communications had taken place between the Home and the Colonial
Governments respecting New Guinea, and his Lordship mentioned, in confidence, that
these communications were nearer a conclusion than the public yet knew.
On the following day, after consultation with his colleagues, Earl Granville informed
Count Munster that Her Majesty’s Government bad no desire to oppose the extension
of German colonization in the islands of the South Seas which were unoccupied by any
civilized Power; but his Lordship warned his Excellency that the extension of some
form of British authority in New Guinea would be shortly announced, explaining,
however, that it would only embrace that part of the island which specially interested
the Australian Colonies, without prejudice to any territorial questions beyond those
limits.
On the 19th September Mr. Scott, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at this Court,
informed the Government of the Emperor that, in consequence of the communications
which had lately taken place between the Home and Colonial Governments, Her
Majesty’s Government proposed to proclaim and establish the Queen’s Protectorate
over all the coasts of New Guinea not occupied by the Netherlands, except that portion
of the north coast comprised between the 145° of east longitude and the eastern Dutch
boundary.
It was at the same time explained that the British Protectorate would include the
small islands immediately adjacent to those parts of the coast over which it was
established, and that the 145° of east longitude had been fixed as the western British
limit on the northern coast in order that it might embrace the territory owned by
natives on the Maclay Coast whose claim for British protection had long been under
the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government.
On the 27th September Baron Plessen, the German Chargd d’Affaires in London,
made a communication from the Imperial Government to the effect that the proposed
extension of the British Protectorate to the north and north-east of New Guinea was
unexpected, and that the Emperor’s Government wished temporarily to reserve the
attitude to be taken up by them, and it was added that, according to the conception of
the Imperial Government, the delimitation of the areas which interest both sides, on
that stretch of coast, should be the object of a friendly understanding by means of a
communication.
On the 9th October Mr. Scott, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires here, informed the
Imperial - Government that Her Majesty’s Government, having carefully considered the
above communication, had decided that they would limit the British Protectorate to
the whole of the southern coast, including the islands contiguous to it, but without
prejudice to any territorial question beyond these limits.
Mr. Scott expressed the satisfaction of Her Majesty’s Government at having come to
an arrangement as to which they found themselves in perfect accord with Germany, and
added that, in the opinion of the British Cabinet, if any questions should arise as to those
districts which lie beyond the limit described, it would be better to deal with them
diplomatically than to refer them to the Commission which it was proposed to appoint
with regard to the islands of the Pacific.
On the 15th October Baron Plessen expressed the satisfaction of the Imperial
Government at the limitation of the British Protectorate, and suggested that the
discussion of the points connected with English and German interests in the South Seas
should take place in London.
After consulting Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Earl Granville
informed the Imperial Ambassador in London on the 19th November last that Her
Majesty’s Government agreed to the proposals of the Imperial Government, and that
they would appoint a Commissioner to meet the German Commissioner, Dr. Krauel.
On the sth December, acting under instructions from Earl Granville, I gave assurances
to the Emperor’s Government respecting the islands of Samoa and Tonga, and I added
that Her Majesty’s Government did not contemplate any fresh arrangements in the Pacific
Ocean pending the result of the negotiations agreed to between the two Governments.
On the 15th December Count Munster expressed the satisfaction of the Emperor’s
Government at these assurances.
As regards the South Sea Islands, his Excellency observed at the same time that the
Australian Colonics laid claim to them, and that the annnexation of a portion of New


Guinea had placed Germany at some, disadvantage, but that His Imperial Majesty’s
Government took notice of the assurance of Her Majesty’s Government that no further
annexations would take place until after the proposed discussion respecting British and
German interests in the South Seas had taken plaqc.
On the IQth December, only four days later, I informed Earl Granville, by
telegraph, that I had received an intimation from Prince Bismarck that the German
flag had been hoisted at three places on the north coast of New Guinea, and at ten
places in New Britain, New Ireland, and Sable Land; and on the 26th his Lordship
received an official communication from the Imperial Ambassador in London to the
same effect.
His Excellency Count Miinster has further informed Lord Granville that he is
instructed to state that the Government of the Emperor do not consider the establish-
ment by Germany of this Protectorate to be prejudicial to the proposed Commission,
any more than the establishment of the British Protectorate on the south-east coast can
be so considered.
Earl Granville has since had a further communication from his Excellency in
explanation of the course pursued by the Imperial Government, and his Lordship has
informed his Excellency that Her Majesty’s Government cannot acquiesce in the
interpretation which the Imperial Government put upon the negotiations which have
passed between the two Governments on the subject of New Guinea.
In view of the action of the Emperor’s Government, instructions have been sent to
•the Commodore on the Australian Station, desiring him to proclaim the Queen’s
Protectorate in New Guinea, from East Cape to the Gulf of Huon, which is under-
stood to be the limit of the German annexations, and over the Louisiade and Woodlark
groups of islands.
The D’Entrecasteaux Islands are included in the previous Proclamation.
I am now instructed by Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs to notify to the Government of the Emperor the steps thus taken by Her
Majesty’s Government to extend Her Majesty’s Protectorate in New Guinea.
In doing so, I am to explain the view taken by Her Majesty’s Government of the
late negotiations, and to add that the recent action of the Queen’s Government has
been prompted in a great measure by the desire to obviate all inconveniences that might
arise from an absence of jurisdiction on the coast of New Guinea between the limits of
the British and German Protectorates.
I am, moreover, empowered to say that, should the Imperial Government still desire
it, Her Majesty’s Government are ready, with a view to clearing up the question and
removing chances of differences between the two Governments, to proceed with the
proposed Commission for the consideration of questions affecting British and German
interests in the Pacific.
Finally, I am desired to say that Her Majesty’s Government have recently received
reports that a Treaty has been signed between the Representative of Germany and the
King of Samoa, and I am to inform the Government of the Emperor, with reference
to these proceedings, that Her Majesty’s Government fully rely on the assurances which,
have been exchanged between the two Governments in regard to the independence of
Samoa and Tonga, and anticipate that any Treaty which may have been signed will not
be ratified, so far as it may be inconsistent with those assurances.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Bramston’s letter of the
31st ultimo,* informing me, by direction of the Secretary of State, that Her Majesty’s
Government are in communication with the Government of the German Empire in
reference to certain alleged annexations by that Power in the South Seas. I trust that
the result of those communications may be to lead to the abandonment by the German
Government of pretensions which have no valid foundation in historical or legal right,
or in political necessity, or in colonial establishments founded by settlers of the German
nation.
Mr. Bramston says he is instructed to remind me that the Victorian Government
have been aware from statements made in Parliament in August last by Mr. Gladstone,
that the British Protectorate would only be established on the southern coast of New
Guinea, excluding the islands to the east, and further territory to the north, which, he
proceeds to inform me, will now be immediately annexed. I am glad to see by the
journals of to-day that the necessary proceedings have been taken to this end. But
I submit that the act of all the Australasian Governments in affirming the original
annexation made by Her Majesty’s Government of Queensland, gives ample ground for
the non-recognition of the recent alleged annexations of Germany.

Respectfully shevveth,
That your memorialists have heard with regret and alarm that there is reason to
fear that France is contemplating the annexation of the New Hebrides and Solomon
Islands.
That for more than 30 years the Presbyterian churches in Scotland and the Colonies
have maintained missions in these islands; that in the prosecution and support of these
missions more than one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling (150,000/.) have
been expended, and several valuable lives sacrificed; that through the labours and
influence of the missionaries, thousands of the inhabitants have been led to renounce
idolatry and its cannibalism and other demoralising customs, and to embrace Christianity;
and that there is good ground to believe, if the missionaries are allowed to continue
their efforts without molestation, that the whole population will soon be christianized
and civilized.
That your memorialists fear, from what has taken place in Tahiti, that if a French
protectorate were established, very serious discouragement would be given to the

missionaries, and great obstacles be thrown in their way by the protecting power ; and
that, in fact, the labours of the last thirty-seven years would be in a great measure lost.
That your memorialists are of opinion that the establishment of French convict
settlements in any of those islands would be ruinous to the native population, and do
serious injury to our Australian Colonies; and that as it would be deeply resented by
the Colonists, it would jeopardize the amicable relations between this' country and
France (or any other foreign power allowed to annex or establish a protectorate over
, any of these islands); and they earnestly pray your Lordship to bring this whole matter
under the attention of Her Majesty’s Government, and urge them to take whatever
steps they in their wisdom may think best to prevent an issue which your memorialists
believe would be disastrous to pure Christianity in those distant lands, and most
detrimental to Colonial and Imperial interests.
And your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

I mentioned to Count Munster to-day that 1 had heard that the German
Government intended to publish at once a new White Book upon the subject of New
Guinea, and I observed that in the recent Angra Pequena White Book the memorandum
communicated by Mr. Scott to the German Government bn October 10 of last year had
been omitted.
This omissipn, I said, probably arose from inadvertence, but as there was some
excitement upon Colonial questions, both in Germany and in England, and as I believed
that both Governments wished and considered that such questions might be amicably
and satisfactorily arranged, I thought it desirable that in each country the public should
understand clearly the position of the other. I hoped therefore that care would be
taken not to omit from the White Book about to be published any important communi-
cations from Her Majesty’s Government, and I specified more particularly the two notes
which Your Excellency addressed to the German Government on the 17tb instant.

consultation with the Law Officers of the Crown, Her Majesty’s Government have
decided that the territory and islands oyer which Her Majesty’s Protectorate has been
proclaimed shall be declared subject to the Queen’s sovereignty, and part of Her
dominions. When this has been accomplished it will then be competent to Her Majesty,
in pursuance of the Acts 6 & 7 Viet. cap. 13 and 23 & 24 Viet. cap. 121, to proceed
by Order in Council to provide for the civil government and administration of justice
in these places. The jurisdiction over all persons, whether British subjects, the subjects
of other civilised powers, or natives, will thus be complete and effective.
Until Her Majesty’s Government have learnt the actual point to which the'
Protectorate extends on the south-east coast of New Guinea, which will probably be
at Huon Gulf, it is not possible to define the limit inland of British sovereignty; and
the details of administration to be effected by the first Order in Council will require
further consideration before they can be announced. I am, however, to state that the
effectiveness of the administration will in - great measure depend upon the amount of
contributions which the Australasian Colonies may desire to provide, and Lord Derby

“ Nelson,” at Port Moresby,
Sir, New Guinea, November 11, 1884.
I have the honour to report the progress which I have so far made in the mission
with which I have been entrusted.
2. Having on my arrival at Brisbane on the 25th October received their Lordship's
telegraphic instructions to proceed as ordered, I left Moreton Bay on the 27th ultimo
and after a favourable passage, arrived and anchored in Port Moresby at 2 p.m., of the
2nd instant; on approaching the land, H.M.S. “Esptegle” was sighted and she entered
the port shortly after us,
3. Here I found H.M.S. “Raven,” “Swinger,” and “Harrier,” which vessels had
arrived at Port Moresby on the following dates respectively, viz., “ Harrier,” 21st
October ; “ Raven,” 25th October; “ Swinger,” 31st October.
4. I found to my astonishment on arrival the British flag flying at Port Moresby, it
having been hoisted on the 23rd October by Lieutenant Willcox, commanding the
“ Harrier,” on the requisition of Mr. Deputy Commissioner Romilly; the correspondence
which ensued on the subject is enclosed.
5. In order to prevent the appearance of any contretemps, I took no further steps
than to direct the Union Jack to be hauled down at sunset, and determined, notwith-
standing the unauthorised ceremony which had already taken place, to carry out my
instructions, and to hoist and salute the flag and to proclaim Her Majesty’s Protectorate
in as formal and thorough a manner as possible.
6. Having procured the invaluable services of the Rev. Messrs. Chalmers andLawes, I
despatched the “ ” and “ Raven ” to bring in the Chiefs living to the eastward
and westward of Port Moresby, and having collected all the influential Chiefs in the
Mosu and neighbouring districts, I invited them on board H.M.S. “ Nelson,” when I
delivered an address (copy enclosed) which was translated and read to their, in the
native tongue by the Rev. Mr. Lawes.
7. At this interview I took the opportunity of informing the natives, through their
Chiefs, that it was the intention of Her Majesty to send a High Officer to live amongst
them, and that on my departure from the New Guinea Coast, I had been instructed to
leave Mr. Romilly in temporary charge of the Protectorate, and having introduced that
officer to them, I enjoined them to bring any complaints they might have to his notice,
and to submit to his authority and decision in all matters. At the same time I singled
out “Boe Vagi” the most influential Chief in the Port Moresby District, and presented
him with a handsome present in “ trade,” together with a stick six of which I had
provided at Sydney mounted in silver, with a florin let into the head, that side on which
Her Majesty’s image and superscription is displayed being uppermost, and presented it
to him as an emblem of his authority, and in order that, through the medium of one
man in each district, all circumstances in which the interests of the natives were concerned
might be brought to the notice of Her Majesty’s Representative. I also presented
24 Chiefs of considerable importance with a small present of trade, and having shown
them the wonders of the “ Nelson ” and fired two shells and some rounds of Nordenfelt
and Gardner ammunition, they left for the shore.
8. Between 8.15 and 9 p.m., the ships were illuminated by lights at the yard arms and
in the gun ports, and several rockets fired, the “ Nelson’s ” electric light and siren
being also used, which had, I believe, considerable effect on the natives.
9. On the following day at 8 a.m., I publicly proclaimed Her Majesty’s Protectorate
and hoisted the British flag with the usual formalities. Notes of the proceedings on this
occasion, together with a copy of my proclamation and address are enclosed.
10. On Friday the 7th instant, I left Port Moresby in H.M.S. “Nelson” and
proceeded to Hall Sound; the “ Raven ” having returned the Motu Chiefs to their
homes, joined me there at 6 p.m. On the following day, the Chiefs of the following
tribes in the neighbourhood of Hall Sound, vizt., Lolo, Naara, Maioo, and Kivori, came
on board, when I addressed them in the same terms as on the previous occasion, and
explained to them the meaning of the ceremony about to be performed on shore, and at
the same time I selected “ Lavao ” the principal Lolo Chief to represent this district, and
presented him with his stick.
11. In the afternoon a landing party was transferred to the “ Raven,” and the British
flag was hoisted in the village of Delena, the Proclamation having been first read with
the same-formalities as before, the “ Nelson” and “Raven,” firing a Royal salute.
12. On Sunday I proceeded to the northward and anchored off the village of
Motumotu, the Rev. Mr. Chalmers embarking in the “ Raven,” and picked up the Chiefs
P 4


of‘ the villages of Lesi, lokea, and Oiapu. These, together with eight of the Chiefs of
the Motumotu district, came on board the “ Nelson ” and listened to my address which
was translated to them with the liveliest interest.
13. On the following morning, the 10th of November, the Proclamation was read and
the British flag hoisted in a prominent position at the entrance of the river off the
village of Motumotu, with the usual formalities, and in the presence of a large concourse
of natives. An old Chief of Motumotu, Semese by name, was here selected by me as
the representative Chief of this district, and present with his staff of office.
14. The ceremony being concluded, I weighed and returned to Port Moresby, and
arrived at 8 a.m. this day.
15. It is my intention to proceed along the south-east coast of New Guinea and to
hoist the flag at various places, probably at Kerepunu, Amazon Bay, South Cape,
Dinner Island, East Cape, and Teste Island, leaving the latter place for Sydney about
the 27th instant.

H.M. schooner under my command, with Deputy Commissioner Romilly on board, on
Wednesday the 15th October, and anchored under the lee of Lizard Sound the same
afternoon.
2. I was detained by bad weather at this anchorage until Sunday IQth when I left,
and arrived at Port Moresby on Tuesday afternoon the 21st instant.
3. Having received the accompanying letter from Deputy Commissioner Romilly, I
landed all the small arm men on the forenoon of the 23rd instant under the command of
Lieutenant Elliot, and they were marched up to the mission compound and fallen in
abreast of the flag staff. Deputy Commissioner Romilly then read the accompanying
proclamations in English, and the Rev. W. Lawes, Missionary, read it in the Motu
language, and explained it to the Chiefs and natives there assembled.
The “ Union Jack ” was then hoisted and saluted with a feu-de-joie, a Royal salute,
and three cheers for Her most gracious Majesty ; this terminated the ceremony.
4. Her Majesty’s gunboat “Raven” arrived here at 4.45 p.m. on Saturday 25th
instant, and then Lieutenant and Commander Ross informed me that you were coming
here, so I determined to await your arrival and inform you of what had taken place.

At 7.30 a.ra., according to previous arrangements, the Commodore left H.M.S.
“ Nelson,” accompanied by Mr. Deputy Commissioner Romilly and a numerous staff of
officers, consisting of heads of departments. On landing he was received by Captain
Bridge of H.M.S. “Espisgle” and other officers of the squadron, and by a guard of
Marines, and immediately proceeded to the Mission Station, where the following people
were assembled round the flagstaff,—the Rev. Mr. Chalmers, Rev. Mr. and Mrs.-Lawes,
Mr. Chester, Mr. Goldie, and six other British subjects engaged in the Beche-de-Mer
fishery, Boe Vage, and about 36 Chiefs of the Motu district.
A battalion of seamen and Marines of the squadron formed in a hollow square round
the flagstaff.
The Commodore then read the proclamation, copy attached, which was afterwards
read in the native language by the Rev. W. Lawes.
The Union Jack was then hoisted under a general salute, the band playing “God
save the Queen,” a royal salute being at the same time fired by H.M.S, “ Nelson,” the
ships dressed in flags.
A “ feu-de-joie ” was then fired by the battalion, three rounds of blank cartridge, the
National Anthem being played between each round.
The Commodore then addressed the assembled people as follows :
“ Officers and Men !
“ Mr. Romilly and Gentlemen!
“ This interesting and important ceremony being now formally concluded, it only
remains for me, in Her Majesty’s name, to express the fervent hope that under the
blessing of Almighty God the establishment of this Protectorate may conduce to
the peace, happiness, and welfare of the people of this vast territory.

them alike from the encroachments of foreigners and the aggressive or unlawful
actions of persons of whatever nationality; may the blessing of civilization and
Christianity, the seeds of which have been already sown by English hands in the
persons of the good and valiant gentlemen who I am delighted to see present on
this occasion, increase and multiply exceedingly amongst them, and, lastly, as the

and hoisted on New Guinea under the authority and by the command of Her most
gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, I most fervently pray that the establishment of a
British Protectorate on these shores may tend to ensure the integrity and inviolability
of the great Australian Colonies, and promote the best interests of their people, and
I trust that this important step may be attended with the happiest results, and
redound to the honour of Her most gracious Majesty the Queen, for whom I now
invite you to give three hearty cheers.”
Three hearty cheers being given, the Commodore, having shaken hands with the
principal Chiefs and other officials, returned to the “ Nelson,” and the company
dispersed.
The number of natives assembled was about 400, a large proportion being unfor-
tunately but unavoidably absent, owing to their departure in large numbers for trading
to the western ports.
Proclamation.
Proclamation on behalf of Her most gracious Majesty Victoria, by the grace of God,
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith,
Empress of India, establishing a Protectorate of Her most gracious Majesty over a
portion of New Guinea and the islands adjacent thereto.
To all to whom these presents shall come. Greeting.
Whereas ifhas become essential for the protection of the lives and properties of the
native inhabitants of New Guinea, and for the purpose of preventing the occupation of
portions of that country by persons whose proceedings, unsanctioned by any lawful
authority, might tend to injustice, strife, and bloodshed, and who, under the pretence of
legitimate trade and intercourse, might endanger the liberties and possess themselves of
the lands of such native inhabitants, that a British Protectorate should be established
over a certain portion of such country and the islands adjacent thereto.
And whereas Her Majesty, having taken into her gracious consideration the urgent
necessity of Her protection to such inhabitants, has directed me to proclaim such
protection in a formal manner at this place : Now, I, James Elphinstone Erskine,
Captain in the Royal Navy and Commodore of the Australian station, one of Her
Majesty’s Naval Aides-de-Camp, do hereby, in the name of Her most gracious Majesty,
declare and proclaim the establishment of such Protectorate over such portions of the
coast and the adjacent islands as is more particularly described in the Schedule hereunto
annexed.
And I hereby proclaim and declare that no acquisition of land whensoever or
howsoever acquired within the limits of the Protectorate hereby established will be
recognized by Her Majesty. And Ido hereby, on behalf of Her Majesty, command and
enjoin all persons whom it may concern, to take notice of this proclamation.
Schedule.
All that portion of the southern shores of New Guinea commencing from the
boundary of that portion of the country claimed by the Government of the Netherlands
on the 141 st meridian of east longitude to East Cape, with all islands adjacent thereto
south of East Cape to Kosman Island, inclusive, together with the islands in the
Goschen Straits.

Enclosure 2 in No. 148.
Sir, “Nelson,” at Sydney, December 2, 1884.
Having concluded the mission with which 1 have been entrusted, I desire to make
a few general remarks.
1. My anxious desire has been to carry out the wishes of Her Majesty’s Government,
and to notify and proclaim Her Majesty’s Protectorate along the southern shore of
New Guinea, from the 141st degree of east longitude to East Cape, in as thorough and
complete a manner as possible.
2. Nine different centres were therefore selected, and I endeavoured to collect all the
Chiefs within the radius of each of these places where the British flag was hoisted, and I
considered it expedient to appoint a prominent Chief to represent each of these districts.
At the same time the proclamation and my addresses have been rendered into various
dialects spoken along the southern shores, and have been carefully and thoroughly
explained to the various Chiefs.
3. News is transmitted in this country with astonishing rapidity, and is quickly passed
on along the coast from one tribe to another. I have no doubt, therefore, that all
particulars of our visit, and the information of what has been done, will be well known
by this time from one end of the Protectorate to the other. Although circumstances
made it impossible for me to approach the shoal and dangerous coasts to the westward
of the Gulf of Papua, I had in view the fact that the. island of Sabai, on which there is
a mission station, and which is the only place to the westward which I could have visited,
even in a small vessel, is included in the boundaries of Queensland. Before leaving the
Australian coast, I therefore, asked the Queensland Government to allow Mr. Chester,
Police Magistrate of Thursday Island, to meet me at Port Moresby, to render me the
assistance which his knowledge of the western portion of the New Guinea coast would
afford, and before his departure I requested Mr. Chester, who is about to take a cruise
in the neighbourhood of the Fly River, to take every opportunity of explaining and
notifying the Proclamation to the natives and others visiting that portion of the coast.
4. It will readily be seen that it would have been impossible for me to have carried
out this programme without the assistance of the Rev. Messrs. Chalmers and Lawes,
whose acquaintance with the people and knowledge of their habits, are well known and
acknowledged. From the moment of my arrival, these gentlemen have placed their
invaluable services entirely at my disposal; they have been ready night and day to assist
me in every possible way; they have spared no pains in translating and explaining the
terms of the proclamation and addresses which I have made, and in collecting. the
numerous chiefs, who, but for them, would never have come near the ship. These
gentlemen, who first came and settled single handed amongst these wild and cannibal
tribes about 10 years ago, have, by their firm, but conciliatory and upright dealing,
established such a hold over the natives as many a crowned head would be proud to
possess. I have been lost in admiration of the influence which they command over these
savage but intelligent people. During our cruise it has happened that a boat has been
sent in the middle of the night to bring off a Chief; when it is imagined what it is to
suddenly surprise and wake up the inhabitants of a native village, to inform the Chief
that he is wanted and must go off immediately to a huge man-of-war, and for that man
to comply without demur, it will be understood what a magic effect is produced by a few
words spoken by “ Tamate” or “ Missi Lawes,” the native names for Mr. Chalmers and
Mr. Lawes.
5. Under these circumstances I desire to testify to the invaluable services which have
been rendered to me by Messrs. Chalmers and Lawes, and to express the hope that they
will be duly acknowledged by Her Majesty’s Government. The wonderful confidence
shown by the natives must be entirely attributed to their influence.
6. I hope our first visit will have a good effect in checking the tribal quarrels which
are constantly recurring,
7. I had the. opportunity of speaking to the Chief of Kabadi, with reference to the
extensive land sale which had been negotiated on his property; he said to me, “It was
Q 2


“ the ‘ hoys ’ who sold the land; when I heard of it I did not agree. I don’t intend to
“ part with my land.”
8. Before leaving Port Moresby I drew up a few regulations, which I considered
absolutely necessary (copy enclosed).
9. The schooner “ Elsea,” a regular trader to New Guinea, arrived at Port Moresby
during my absence, and I was informed that, in consequence of a supply of spirits being
landed from that vessel, a disgraceful scene was enacted, in which a few white men bore
a prominent and shameful part. I, therefore issued the regulation making Port Moresby
the port of entry, and respecting the landing of spirits.
10. The schooner “ Retriever,” bringing stores for Mr. Page, an Englishman, who is
engaged in a search for cedar and other wood, and has been for some time on the coast,
arrived, and the captain was immediately served with the proclamation, and a copy of my
regulations.
11. I found that “ Boe Vagi,” Chief of Port Moresby, was in the habit of flying a
Union Jack, given to him by Mr. Chester, on the occasion of the annexation by
Queensland, and I had to use a little diplomacy in getting it from him. I caused a blue
flag to be made, on which a “ Bird of Paradise ” was represented in all its gorgeous
plumage, on a white ground, and an exchange was thus readily effected.
12. In concluding this report, I desire to express my acknowledgments to Captain
Bridge, and the officers and men of the ships serving under my orders for the ready help
and assistance which they have afforded me. My acknowledgments are also especially
due to Staff Commander Osborn, whose unremitting attention to his duties, and whose
skill and ability as a navigator have enabled me to take the “ Nelson ” through intricate
and unsurveyed waters without hesitation, and without the slightest mishap.
13. I propose to send for their Lordships’ information, as soon as completed, a map
showing the places where the flag has been hoisted on the southern shores of New Guinea,
and the names of the various tribes within the limits of the Protectorate, as far as I am
able to procure them, and a list of the Chiefs whom I received on board.
14. I have given the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Lawes a passage to Sydney in H.M.S.

No. 148 a. y
SIR E. MALET, K.C.8., to the RIGHT HON. THE EARL GRANVILLE, K.G.
My Lord, * Berlin, January 24, 1885.
With reference to my Despatch of to-day’s date,* I have the honour to inform
your Lordship that after I had finished reading to Prince Bismarck your Lordship’s
Despatch of the 20th instant,* he spoke to me at length on the circumstances leading to
the present political estrangement between the two countries.
He said that at every point at which Germany had endeavoured to found a Colony
England had closed in, making new acquisitions, so as to restrict Germany’s power of
expansion. He proceeded to the question of New Guinea, and he asserted that he had
understood from Mr. Scott’s note of the 9th Octoberf that we had accorded him free
hand with regard to the north; that, to his understanding, the words “ -without
prejudice to any territorial question beyond these limits ” gave him such liberty.
I argued with the Prince on both points to the effect that we had not extended our
protectorates in the order stated; that we had, on the contrary, been going even to the
Cameroons before we were in any way aware that Germany intended to establish a
protectorate there; that in regard to New Guinea, when first Count Munster had
spoken about it, your Lordship had informed him that steps towards annexation had
already gone further than was known ; as to the words “ without prejudice ” conveying
such a meaning as the Prince attached to them, I assured him that the only meaning
which could be attached to them in the English language was that the question with
regard to the rest of New Guinea remained as it was before, and that, in any case, the
words were followed by the statement of opinion that questions regarding territories
beyond those which we had annexed should be dealt with diplomatically. The Prince
persisted that he had understood the words in an entirely different sense, and had con-
sidered that he was free to annex that which we had not annexed.
He proceeded to say that in order to show me how different were our relations only a
year ago, and how much he had desired that the good relations then subsisting should
continue, he would read me a Despatch which he had addressed to Count Munster on
the sth of last May.
He must believe that Her Majesty’s Government had entirely failed to appreciate the
importance which his Government attached to the colonial question, as he could, not
suppose that, if your Lordship had understood it, the successive annoyances to which
Germany had been exposed would not have been averted.
This Despatch of the sth May to Count Munster was a very remarkable one.
It stated the great importance which the Prince attached to the , colonial question, and
also to the friendship of Germany and England.
It pointed out that in the commencement of German colonial enterprise, England
might render signal service to Germany, and said that for such service Germany would
use her best endeavours in England’s behalf in questions affecting her interests nearer
home. It pressed these considerations with arguments to show the mutual advantage
which such understanding would produce, and it then proceeded to instruct Count
Munster to say if it could not be effected the result would be that Germany would
seek from France the assistance which she had failed to obtained from England, and
would draw closer to her on the same lines on which she now endeavoured to meet
England. The Despatch was a long one, and the Prince read it to me in German, but
the above was the gist of it.
Prince Bismarck went on to say that, not being satisfied with the result, and
attributing it in part to the Ambassador not having stated the points with precision,
he sent his son, Count Herbert Bismarck, to England, in the hope that he might
succeed where Count Munster had failed; but that he, unfortunately had only succeeded
in obtaining those general friendly assurances of goodwill which were of little value in
the face of subsequent occurrences.
The Prince then read to me a draft of a Despatch which he is now sending to Count
Munster, in which he takes up a remark, which his Excellency attributes to your
Lordship, in a Report on the Egyptian question, to the effect that the attitude of
Germany on the colonial question makes it difficult for your Lordship to be conciliatory
on other points.
The Prince next reverted to what he termed our closing-up system, and he men-
tioned Zululand, observing that the Boers claimed a cession dating from 1840 with King
Panda.
* See Africa, No. ] (1885). \ See Enclosure in No. 16.
Q 3


I said that I feared the Prince’s good faith had been imposed upon, as no such State
as the Transvaal had existed at that date, and that the only Boers who could have
obtained a cession of territory, if such existed, were our own subjects.
The Prince replied that it was not a question which a lawsuit would settle.
I then said to the Prince that the whole situation was undoubtedly a very un-
satisfactory one, and that it gave me great pain, as it had been my hope and
endeavour, under instructions from your Lordship, to bring about a more cordial
understanding between the two Powers; that I knew that it had never been the
intention of Her Majesty’s Government to thwart the colonial aspirations of Germany,
and that, in my opinion, our action had repeatedly shown this desire; but I said
that it would be impossible for us to act so as to meet his wishes, even where
it was easy for us to do so, unless we knew what those wishes were, and I therefore
begged him to tell me what now, at this moment, he wanted ; was it the parts of New
Guinea which we were now annexing ? Was it Zululand ? I said that the knowledge
of his wishes, whatever they might be, was better than that we should go on mutually
acting in the dark, and consequently running against each other.
The Prince replied that the understanding which he had arrived at with Prance in
consequence of his failure to come to one with us, put it out of his power to take up the
question now, as he had expounded it to us in May. The long conversation came to an
end by his saying that he had been anxious to explain to me the series of circumstances
that had preceded the present phase of the political relations between the two countries,
which he was sure I must regret as much as he did.

Annexation of New Guinea.
At a meeting of the Council of the Royal Colonial Institute, held on Tuesday,
27th January 1885, the following resolutions were adopted :
1. That the present unsatisfactory position of the New Guinea Annexation Question
prompts the Council of the Royal Colonial Institute to consider and review their
past action in this important matter.
It appears that on April 29th, 1875, a deputation of the Council and Fellows
waited on the Earl of Carnarvon, Secretary of State for the Colonies. The
memorial presented on that occasion, praying that the shores of Eastern New
Guinea “should be added to the Empire without delay,” pointed out that “it
“ would be most prejudicial to our interests that any position on the shores of
“ Eastern New Guinea, or of the islands situated off its coasts . . . should
“ belong to any other Power;” that “disputes respecting rights of fishing would
“ inevitably arise that “it is impossible to estimate the extent of insecurity to
“ the Australian portion of the Empire, and to British interests generally,”
should the territory fall “ into the possession of a Foreign State.” The memorial
further urged that “the secret of our Strength and security in that quarter of the
“ Empire lies in the fact that we have no one to interefere with us, and the only
“ remaining extensive territory in which any other nation could take up a
“ position of undesirable proximity is Eastern New Guinea. Were such a Power
“ established there, however amicable our relations with it might be, its presence
“ would at once and for ever entail upon the Imperial and the Australian Govern-
“ ments an increased expenditure for defences in time of peace, which would far
“ exceed whatever might be the cost of our establishing our authority in the
“ island. And, should war ever occur between us and the Power in possession
“ of New Guinea, we should enter into it having an outpost of our enemy
“ established in a very strong position at our very doors.” The memorial did
not omit to point out that “ the formation also by any other Power of a penal
“ settlement in New Guinea, similar to that established by the French in New
“ Caledonia, would be a constant source of injury and annoyance to the
“ Australian Colonies.”
u 150G4. R


In the following year, in a letter dated June 30th, 1876, the Council again
urged the annexation upon the Colonial Office.
On July 9th, 1878, the Council addressed a letter to the Colonial Minister, in
which it remarked : —“ The rights asserted or behalf of the British Crown when
“ formal possession of Eastern Papua was taken by the discoverers of its coast
“ cannot but be impaired by the lapse of time during which no occupation of
“ any part of the territory has been effected with a view to make good by actual
“ possession such formal claim. The Council would, therefore, submit that
“ Great Britain would now have less right of complaint were any other Power to
“ annex the territory than at the period referred to.”
Mr. Frederick Young, hon. sec., wrote on behalf of the Council on
December 9th, 1882, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, drawing
attention to an article in the “Allgemeine Zeitung ” of November 27th, 1882,
recommending the German Government to annex and colonise New Guinea.
The communication having been transmitted by the Foreign Office to the
Colonial Office, Mr. Bratnston replied, on January 4th, 1883, that Lord Derby
desired him to state “ that the proposal that a portion of ‘ New Guinea ’ should
“ be annexed to Great Britain is one which Her Majesty’s Government are not
“ prepared to entertain, and that his Lordship has no reason for supposing that
“ the German Government contemplate any scheme of colonisation in the
“ direction indicated by the ‘ Allgemeine Zeitung ’ of the 27th November.”
A deputation of the Council waited upon the present Secretary of State for the
Colonies on June Ist. 1883, and presented a memorial, setting forth a great
number of reasons in favour of annexation, and especially laying stress upon the
importance of keeping any Foreign Power from establishing itself in New Guinea,
which, it was urged, “ would, even in time of peace, cause many inconveniences
“ and expenses to England and her Australasian Possessions, and in time of war
“ would be a standing danger to Australasia, and a menace to British interests
“ in the East generally.”
At the annual meeting of the Fellows, held on June 29th, 1883, a resolution
was adopted approving of the action of the Council in presenting the above
memorial to the Secretary of State, to whom a copy of the resolution was
forwarded by his Grace the Chairman of the Council on the following day.
Besides the annexation of Eastern New Guinea having been thus directly
advocated by the Council of the Institute, it has been the special subject of
three papers read at the ordinary meetings, and has been urged by many speakers
in various discussions. Papers advocating it were read March 16th, 1875, by
Sir Archibald Michie, on “Great Britain and New Guinea;” December 17th,
1878, by Signor D’ Albertis, on “New Guinea: Its Fitness for Colonisation

I have the honour to request that you will inform the Earl of Derby that I have
been unofficially apprised by the Agent-General for New South Wales that he received,
on the eve of the despatch of the last Australian mail, a despatch written by his Lordship’s
direction, informing him that Her Majesty’s Ministers have lately decided to vary the
form of Government implied in the annexation of New Guinea in such a way as to
involve the assumption of a power equivalent to sovereignty.
My Government may feel natural surprise that a decision of so much importance
to all the Australasian Colonies should only be communicated to one of them, and I
have now to request that you will move the Secretary of State to give me such informa-
tion on the subject as he may deem due to Her Majesty’s Ministers at Melbourne.

Goverraent House, Melbourne,
My Lord, December 24, 1884.
I have the honour to transmit a memorandum which has been sent to me by
Mr. Service, with reference to the recent annexation of part of the North Coast of New
Guinea by Germany, in which he expresses the views of the Government of Victoria
upon the present position of the Colonies in relation to that question, and his reasons for
believing the Australian Colonists may rely with confidence that their interest in the
island of New Guinea will be secured by Her Majesty’s Imperial Government, and that
consequently Her Majesty’s Government will not acknowledge the action taken by
Germany with respect to the establishment of a protectorate over any part of that
country.
I have, &c.
The Right Hon. (he Earl of Derby, K.G., (Signed) HENRY B, LOCH.
&c. &c. &c.
Enclosure in No. 161.
Memorandum for His Excellency the Governor.
Premier’s Office, Melbourne,
December 20, 1884.
Mr. Service begs (o draw your Excellency’s serious attention to the attached
clipping from a second edition of “ The Age ” newspaper of the 19th instant, headed
“ German Annexation in the Pacific,” also to a clipping from “ The Argus ” of the 20th
idem on the same subject.
The intelligence therein conveyed of definite steps being taken by Germany to annex
or establish a Protectorate, nut only over the more important islands of the Western
Pacific, but even in the Northern portion of New Guinea, has already created
consternation in this community.
2. The surprise thus created is based upon the following facts :
Your Excellency is. aware that the Convention which met in Sydney last year,
representing the Governments of all the British Colonies of Australasia, passed, as
the first of its resolutions, the following, viz.:—


“That further acquisition of dominion in the Western Pacific, south ot the
equator, by any foreign Power would be highly detrimental to the safety
and well-being of the British possessions in Australasia, and injurious to the
interests of the Empire.”
The Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies, writing subsequently
to this, viz., on the 9th May 1881, gave this assurance, viz :
“ Her Majesty’s Government are confident that no foreign Power contemplates
interference with New Guinea.”
Again, in the House of Commons on the 24th October 1884, the Lord Mayor asked,
whether the Government had come to an understanding with Germany as to the
occupation by the latter Power of the northern portion of New Guinea, to which
the Honourable Mr. Evelyn Ashley replied;
“ The answer is in the negative.”
Prior to this, on the 2nd of July 1883, the Earl of Derby had publicly announced in
the House of Lords, that it would be regarded as an “ unfriendly act ” if any other
country attempted to make a settlement on the coast of New Guinea.
Further, in the telegram announcing General Scratchley’s appointment as High
Commissioner to control the New Guinea Protectorate, it was stated that he would
also be Deputy Commissioner for portions of New Guinea outside the Protectorate.
3. In view of all these assurances, Mr. Service submits that Australian Colonists were
entitled to rest in perfect confidence that their interest in the neighbouring island of New
Guinea was secured by Her Majesty’s Imperial Government, and it must be supposed
that the reported action of a foreign Power, if it be a fact, is without the knowledge or
consent of Her Majesty’s Government. Yet the reports are so detailed and circum-
stantial, and, further, so entirely in accord with the published utterances of the German
Chancellor, that it seems vain to doubt them.
4. Mr. Service must, in duty to this Colony, represent to your Excellency that not
only surprise but indignation will be the feeling here, if the reports referred to should
prove to be true. That feeling will no doubt be intensified, by the recollection, that
when Colonists acted in their own interests and hoisted, in Her Majesty’s name, the
Union Jack in New Guinea, Her Majesty’s Government thought fit to repudiate and
cancel that proceeding, alleging (to quote from Lord Derby’s despatch of 11th July
1883) that—
“ The apprehension entertained in Australia that some foreign Power was about to
establish itself on the shores of New Guinea appears to have been altogether
indefinite and unfounded.”
In Mr. Service’s communication of 18th June 1883, to his Excellency the Governor,
Mr. Service in referring to this, and urging action by the Imperial Government,
represented that;—
“ Australia is, in this respect, fettered in her action by her forming part of the British
Empire. She cannot take the course which her truest interest dictates without
the authority of the Crown ***** a strori g feeling of dissatisfaction
will spread throughout these Colonies, if England, while holding Australia back
from acting in her own interests, at the same time neglects to take a step which
Australia deems essential to her future security and welfare,”
The present position of matters is this, that Australia is not allowed to act for-herself;
neither will the Imperial Government act for her, and meanwhile she has to stand by
and see territories, the possession of which she regards as essential to her safety and
well-being, pass to another Power.
As one who strongly cherishes the connexion of the Colonies with the Empire,
Mr. Service cannot adequately express the feeling of disappointment which he entertains
at the want of response by Her Majesty’s Government to the aspirations of the
Colonies. !
Whether this report’should prove to be true, or whether exaggerated, in either case it
illustrates the extreme unwisdom of slighting the perpetual and strong representations
which have unceasingly been addressed to the Imperial Government on this subject for
the last 18 months.
5. But in the present situation it becomes necessary to consider what is yet practi-
cable. In Lord Derby’s despatch of 11th July 1883, before referred to, it is stated that
“ If there had been any evidence of the intention, which is said to have been apprehended,
“ of a foreign Power to take possession of any part of New Guinea, the views and
“ proposals of the Colonial Government could have been placed before Her Majesty’s
“ Government by telegraph, and if the circumstances had justified immediate action, it
“ could have been taken without a delay of more than a very few hours.”
R 3


Mr. Service now submits to your Excellency the evidence of the accompanying
reports which can be confirmed or disproved by the Commodore on the Australian
station. Mr. ■ Service now records the request already verbally made, that your
Excellency will be pleased to telegraph the intelligence to the Secretary of State, with a
request that steps may be at once authorised by telegraph, to save to Australasia such
of the neighbouring islands as are yet available.
6. Mr. Service further asks your Excellency to convey his strong protest, on behalf of
the Colony of Victoria, against the inaction which gives an open invitation to foreign
Powers to come and take possession of lands in which no Power can be so much interested
as the neighbouring and important communities of Australasia.

German Annexation in the Pacific.
Sydney, Friday morning.
The special correspondent of the Daily Telegraph , at New Britain, wires as follows :
“ The German war vessels ‘ Elizabeth ’ and ‘ Hyaene ’ have arrived here under
instructions from the German Imperial authorities to establish a Protectorate over all
the islands in this part of the Pacific occupied by German citizens or held by German
capitalists. The Imperial Protectorate has been established over the north coast of New
Britain, and the German flag formally hoisted and saluted. The same ceremony of
hoisting the German flag over all German property has been performed by these vessels
at New Britain, New Ireland, and the Admiralty Islands. A steamer from Samoa,
supposed to be in the service of the German Government, has been visiting various
nortions of the north coast of New Guinea and the adjoining islands, for the purpose of
concluding treaties with the native inhabitants for the transfer of land to the German
Government. So far as I have been able to learn, the object of these purchases is to
establish German claims to the territory in northern New Guinea and the neighbouring
islands in preference to any other nation. Already, large tracts of territory have been
acquired in this way, and wherever this has been done the German flag has been hoisted.
The German authorities here have also notified that they will not acknowledge the
interests of the citizens of any other nationality than Germany in connexion with territory
on the northern shores of New Guinea, or in New Britain, New Ireland, or the Admiralty
Islands.”

the German warship ‘ Elizabeth,’ after leaving Sydney, proceeded to Singapore, or some
other eastern port, where she was joined by four other vessels, and then proceeded to
New Guinea, and annexed that portion of the island not previously annexed by England,
and also New Britain, New Ireland, and the Duke of York, the Admiralty, and the
D’Entrecasteaux Islands. This is all the information obtainable here at present. The
‘ Raven’ having coaled, will return to New Guinea probably to-morrow.”

Extract.
I enclose to your Lordship, herewith, a Memorandum drawn up by Mr. Howard
Vincent, who has lately visited Sydney, on the French system of penal settlement in
New Caledonia.
Enclosure in No. 162.
French Transportation to New Caledonia.
Memorandum by Mr. Howard Vincent, late Director of Criminal Investigations,
London.
One of the principal objects I had in view in visiting Australia was to obtain the exact facts
concerning the transportation of French criminals to New Caledonia. Independently of
the deep interest every true Englishman cannot fail to take in all that affects the welfare
of British colonies, my attention had been particularly directed to the subject, and to
the measure proposed by the French Government for the expatriation of re-convicted
prisoners or “ recidivistes.” During the tenure of my late office of Director of Criminal
Investigations, I had been consulted by some opponents of the proposed law in the
Chamber of Deputies. In response to their request I prepared a memorandum showing
from English experience the futility of transportation as a means of punishment, the
expense it entailed upon the State, the injury it inflicted upon colonial fields of enter-
prise, and the diminution of crime in Great Britain since its substitution by a rigorous
system of penal discipline tempered by classification of offenders and conditional liberty.
But apart from these, so to say, public objections to the proposed law, its provisions
were far too sweeping to commend themselves to various societies for assisting discharged
prisoners, and freeing youthful offenders of the prison taint, with which I was connected
in London and Paris.
Although prevented by the imposition of a prolonged quarantine at Noumea on ships
arriving from Sydney, from going to New Caledonia as I intended, 1 have been able to
obtain the following particulars in connection with the island and its penal settlements
from officials connected with them, as well as from public documents and reliable private
testimony.
New Caledonia was discovered, as is known, by Captain Cook on 4th September
1774. The climate is said to be one of the most perfect in the Southern hemisphere.
The land, except in the mountainous districts, is exceedingly fertile, and in many
portions rich in mineral wealth. On more than one occasion naval officers called the
attention of the British Government to the desirability of establishing a settlement on
the island. But in 1848 Sir George Grey, then Governor of New Zealand, being on
a cruise of inspection to the places within his Government, in which he thought New
Caledonia to be included, was informed, when off the Isle of Pines, that the French flag
had been hoisted. He reported the matter to the then Secretary of State for the Colonies,
Earl Grey, and pointed out how dangerous to British interests such an occupation was
likely to be from a naval'and military point of view. But no notice appears to have
been taken of the timely warning, which was, I am informed, reiterated by the New
South Wales Government. The island was, therefore, formally occupied by the French
on September 24, 1853; and the annexation of the neighbouring Loyalty Islands was
also effected at the same time. Without entering upon the vexed question as to
whether the whole of the Pacific Islands should be under British rule, it is incontestable
that the presence of a great and frequently aggressive power on a range of territory
abounding with good harbours and natural advantages near the Australian coast cannot
add to the security of Australasia from hostile attack. We owe it to fortuitous circum-
stances that the danger has not ere this been demonstrated by engines of war; but it
has been made not the less apparent by the moral scourge under which the native races
of New Caledonia, no less than Australasia and Polynesia, are now labouring.
R 4


It was in 1864 that the first consignment of convicts was landed in New Caledonia, and
since then there has been an almost continuous inpouring of criminals. For several years
past it has been the practice to transport thither nearly all Frenchmen under 60 y'ears of
age sentenced to travaux forces or penal servitude for criminal offences. The number
thus transported reaches a total of about 17,300, but death and escapes have reduced
the actual number of criminals now on the island to 10,500. Apart from the large
mortality which has possibly existed through defective care and vicious habits, the
immense reduction in numbers shows clearly how little vigilance has been exercised to
prevent escape. This too is further proved by the discovery in Australia, since 1874,
of 247 French escaped convicts, besides many more against whom positive proof was not
forthcoming; and it is quite certain that the number of those not found and not suspected
is far larger.
Convicts are sent to New Caledonia on board hired transports, and placed in compart-
ments or cages, holding from 50 to 70 each, ranged in double tiers along the lower deck.
They are let out for exercise in detachments for half an hour daily. On arrival at
Noumea they are first sent to a fortified camp, where the clothing is allotted and the
gangs formed.
The classes are five in number, namely ; —
(a.) The first class, consisting of the best-conducted men, who may either obtain
a grant of land, be employed by the colonists, or as foremen in the public
service.
(A) The second class, which are employed in public works or agricultural pursuits
on behalf of the State, receiving a small salary.
(c.) The third class, which are employed in like manner, but without remuneration,
save very exceptionally.
{(I.) The fourth class, which are kept to severe hard labour, without remuneration,
but receiving a ration of wine and tobacco twice a week.
(e.) The fifth class, which are kept under the same discipline as the fourth class,
but without tobacco or wine.
New arrivals are placed in the fifth class if they have been previously convicted, but
otherwise in the fourth.
Advancement in class takes place by order of the Governor, or the recommendation
of the Penal Director, after the lapse of at least six months.
After the formation of the gangs, the convicts are transferred to the Penitentiary
on lie Nou to complete the first portion of their sentence. The gangs are formed
without any attempt at that classification of offenders by crimes and antecedents which
is so essential to reclamation, and the youth who has committed an offence such as
forgery, entailing a sentence of penal servitude, finds himself herded in the Penitentiary,
as on board ship, with villains of the deepest dye. Except when at work, there is
practically no supervision over them. Men of all ages, of all degrees of vice, are shut
up in sheds holding 50 each, and in which there is just space for them to sling their
hammocks. The consequences of such a system are too frightful to be described ; yet
all efforts have failed to induce the authorities to exercise stricter supervision, to classify
the convicts, and to bring moral influences to bear on their reform.
The lute Governor, M. Pallu de la Barriere, was sincerely anxious to do his best for
those under his charge, but his philanthropy was not of that practical character which
can alone meet with success among prisoners—the exercise of leniency tempered by severe
disciplinary repression. Crime, under his administration, increased both in character
and amount.
After a convict has served half his sentence without punishment, he may be recom-
mended for a reduction of his term, and subsequently for the remission of the remainder.
But if his sentence has been less than eight years he has to remain on the island for
double the period thereof, when he is free to return to France at his own expense. If
the sentence exceeded eight years his exclusion from France is for life, and the case of
convicts sentenced to penal servitude a perpetuitc is not taken into consideration for
conditional liberation until the lapse of 10 years of good conduct.
The principal punishments are—deprivation of privileges, chains, reduction in class,
and ridiculous prolongation of sentence far beyond the term of life. Flogging is not
allowed, and death sentences by court-martial have to be submitted to the President of
the Republic. There is, however, a frequent use of the revolver, with which the 300
military warders are furnished.
There are six prison farms, but they arc not productive in the proportion which might
be fairly expected, and the discipline is even less than on He Nou.


When a convict has reached the first class, which is possible within from two to three
years of his arrival in the Colony, he is entitled to conditional liberation, to have his wife
and children sent to him from France, or, if unmarried, to select a wife from a female
convict, or a volunteer from the hospital for abandoned women at Paris, sent to the
island as candidates for matrimony, to take up a landed concession or find employment in
the Colony.
New Caledonia is divided into five districts, and to one of these every license holder is
assigned, his choice being complied with if possible. The liberes are divided into two classes,
the first not being allowed to leave their district. Those who have shown such means of
subsistence as to justify their being given a grant of land are subjected to the supervision
of an officer who observes and reports upon their conduct. For the many who have to
seek employment and are unable to find work among the thousand or so free colonists,
there is a refuge near Noumea. The men in it are kept partially employed by the
State, receiving 50 centimes a day; others are allowed to work on their own account
and sell their productions under certain conditions, the whole being subjected to two roll-
calls every day. But the only difference between the men in the refuge and those in
the penitentiaries is in the degree of license allowed them.
Such in brief is the system in actual force. It requires no knowledge of prison
administration to show that the association under such conditions of large numbers of
criminals is in the highest degree pernicious, and absolutely ineffectual as a means of
punishment or a channel of reformation. The young —and one ship alone brought out
no less than 164 convicts under 25 years of age —are speedily corrupted, and free play is
allowed to the evil instincts of the vicious. The cellular, silent, and classified system,
which is in Great Britain exercising so powerful an influence in the reduction of serious
crime, is wholly absent. Transportation has little or no terrorising effect upon the
habitual criminal, who hails with delight the prospect of a comparatively easy life in
“La Nouvelle,” instead of the close confinement of a prison at home. The men released
under conditions find no difficulty whatever in evading the regulations, and pursuing a
career of criminality towards the unfortunate free settlers ami the native population.
The military warders arc insufficient in number and very inadequately paid. The
facilities for escape are numerous at the several ports, and even at Noumea. They are
frequently undiscovered, and when the contrary is the case, no steps are taken to ascer-
tain if they have taken refuge in Australasia, the only adjacent country, or if reported
to be there found, to obtain their surrender.
No wonder is it that there arc but few free colonists in New Caledonia, and of those
who are there without a direct interest in the contracts for the support of the convicts,
there is not one who does not consider the system of transportation a most grievous
wrong. The officials themselves know and have frequently represented its disastrous
effects; that its cost per head is nearly double that of convict establishments in England,
and that it effectually prevents the Colony becoming, as it otherwise might, a fruitful
source of national revenue.
But in spite of the appeals and representations of all entitled to be heard, in spite of
the clearest demonstration that the island is already crowded to overflowing with convict
life, and absolutely unable to maintain more prisoners, the French Government have
proposed a measure of unparalleled severity, and calculated if New Caledonia could
only hold them to increase fivefold its present criminal population of 10,500.
The Bill now before the French Senate provides for the transportation for life ;
(a.) Of persons twice sentenced within 10 years to penal servitude for any term, or
to solitary confinement.
[b.) Of persons sentenced, within 10 years, to one term of penal servitude or
solitary confinement, and twice convicted of offences, entailing a minimum
sentence of three months’ imprisonment.
(c.) Of persons four times convicted, within 10 years, for any offence designated as
a crime, or to at least three months’ imprisonment for larceny, embezzlement,
fraud, wilful damage to trees or crops, indecent assault, and that offence so
properly known to French law, and so unfortunately not provided for in British
criminal jurisprudence, namely, the incitement of minors to immorality.
(d.) Of persons who within 10 years have been five times convicted of vagrancy, and
have been once sentenced to at least three months’ imprisonment, and twice
convicted of any offence provided for under the heading (a), ( b ), and (c).
(c.) Of persons who, not coming under any of the preceding categories, have never-
theless been six times convicted within 10 years of any offence whatever ;
one of which has been visited by three months’ imprisonment.
u 15C64. S


Any period passed in prison is not to be taken into account in the calculation of the
period of 10 years within which the offences are to be committed to come within the
operation of the proposed law; and although no individual is to be transported below
the age of 21, offences committed under that age are to be considered by the court.
When the measure is carefully examined, and when one reflects that “vagrancy”
includes the offence of being at large without visible means of subsistence, it is clear that
the law will embrace an immense class of persons. Many may be idle and comparatively
worthless, but a large majority are not criminals or past all hope of reclama-
tion. But the effect of transporting them to New Caledonia, under existing conditions,
will be to make them both into habitual criminals, and to place their reform beyond the
bounds of possibility.
The danger to Australasia is even augmented by the proposal to give the majority of
these individuals their conditional liberty on arrival in New Caledonia, which cannot
support, efficiently watch, or prevent the escape of those already there; and the number
is to be still further increased by the “ privilege ” offered to every individual sentenced
to any term of imprisonment for any offence, of transfer to a Colony after having served
half of his time.
It is said that the French Government has proposed to the Senate that the Bill
should not define the Colonies to which criminals shall be transported. Those mentioned
are New Caledonia and its dependencies, the Marquesas Islands, the Island of Phu-
Quoc, and French Guiana. Their omission from the law will not be any advantage.
The Marquesas Group, the Society Islands, Corsica, and Algeria are, I understand,
the only French colonies in which Europeans could live under penal conditions of any
sort, and it is unnecessary to say that the two last-named places are far too valuable
and productive to people in such way, besides vrhich the one already contains a large
reformatory, and the other a military prison.
Such, then, are the results of French attempted colonisation in the Pacific. It has
brought no good to the countries occupied ; it opens out no fresh avenues of commerce,
and it is dangerous to surrounding communities from an offensive no less than a moral
point of view. The proposal, in question, as regards the recidivistes, has been probably
made to show that something is being done to purge France of elements of disorder
which from time to time overwhelm her, without regard to their costliness or actual
efficacy. It had its basis, doubtless, in the popular delusion among Frenchmen that such
prosperity as they hear credited to Australasia is due to the early system of transportation
to some of the Colonies, and profoundly ignorant, as they tod frequently are, of things
beyond the Gallic frontier, they fail to take into account how much injury that system
wrought in more than one case. Diplomatic remonstrance by a foreign State against a
measure of internal administration is always calculated to arouse the susceptibilities of
any nation, and more especially of a country situated as France is to-day in regard to
Great Britain and Europe. French statesmen, moreover, look upon Australasian agita-
tion against transportation to New Caledonia rather as a veil to an ambition, sometimes
expressed with more vehemence perhaps than discretion, to annex the whole of the South
Pacific islands. The Government fear, too, that their support will be doubtful if they
yield to foreign representation, however just, as to the use to which French territory
shall be put.
But if France could be induced to appreciate the fact that Australasia has no ulterior
motive but the wish to see established on a promising land near her shores fresh fields
of honest enterprise ; that her people only desire to cultivate amicable relations with
French colonists, which are impossible under the present condition of things; then, I
venture to think, the world would soon see the cessation of a system which no thoughtful
man can view with other feelings than of regret, and as opposed to all the principles of
the civilization of to-day. To repeat, French transportation to New Caledonia is
enormously costly, it promotes crime, it rears criminals, it acts in no sense as a deterrent
it frustrates colonisation, it impedes commerce, it inflicts grievous injury upon native
races, and it outrages humanity. Australasia is amply justified in her earnest protest.
Her Governments and citizens respect France. They wish to live in harmony with all men.
But the determination is justly unanimous to enforce measures, however stringent or
injurious to French mercantile interests in the Pacific, to prevent the possibility of
convicts gaining the shores of Greater Britain.

MR. JOHN STRACHAN to COLONIAL OFFICE.
(Received February 2, 1885.)
My Lord, ' Sydney, December 13, 1884.
I notice by the English press telegrams that your Lordship’s attention has been
called to a statement made by the man T. C. Kerry, a seaman, who made one of an
exploring party under my command, in May of this year, to New Guinea. For your
Lordship’s information, I most emphatically assert and declare the report as given by
Kerry to be one tissue of falsehood, enormous and unconscionable lying.
On the 24th day of May we were attacked by a large war party of Dongara men from
the west, numbering not less than 1,200 fighting men in some 25 war canoes, and whom
I successfully kept at bay by the aid of Board of Trade signal rockets, until enabled
to escape in the darkness, when I abandoned the “ lugger,” a craft of less than seven
tons, and made for that part of the coast opposite Saibai, distant 110 miles. On
Tuesday, 27th May, I called a halt on the plain at noon for the purpose of obtaining
two hours’ sleep, I having had no rest since leaving the “ lugger ” on the 24th.
Instructing the men, D. B. Walker and T. C. Kerry, to keep a vigilant look-out, and
to call me on the first sign of danger, I stretched myself at the foot of a tree, and fell
asleep. In less than half an hour I was awakened by a yell from Walker, who
simultaneously fired one barrel of his double-barrelled fowling-piece. Springing up, I
saw ranged on the brow of the hill about 12 men with their arrows drawn to the head,
and which they shot amongst us, one of which wounded Kerry in foot (slightly) ;
running towards them with a cry of “Follow them up, lads,” we began firing, on which
the Natives, who in the first instances had evidently fired on us from sheer fright, threw
away their bows and arrows, and ran. I immediately gave the order to cease firing.
After examining the arrows, and ascertaining that they were not poisoned, I demanded
the reason why my positive orders had been disobeyed, and a vigilant look-out not kept.
Walker accused Kerry, and Kerry accused Walker. However, I subsequently learned
that neither were on the watch, Walker being employed filling his pipe, while Kerry was
engaged picking the scabs off his sores. What makes this matter the more to be
regretted is, that the Natives were a small hunting party of the Biru tribe, who are
known to be friendly to whites, and who would have materially assisted us on our
journey to the coast.
That men were unfortunately shot, I believe, although as a matter of fact I did not
see them: but two of my men, T. C. Kerry and C. J. Stewart, assert that between
them they killed five Natives. On arrival at Thursday, I reported the matter to
H. M. Chester, police magistrate, and my depositions, acknowledged by every man of
my party to be substantially correct, are in the hands of the Queensland Executive.
After a weary tramp of 10 days we succeeded in making the coast, and were relieved by
the missionary from Cornwallis Island. During the expedition 1 explored over 1,000
miles of country, found 12 large rivers running far into the interior, and that with a most
miserable equipment of men and arms. In conclusion, I may state that lam and shall
be quite prepared to justify and vindicate all my acts and conduct before any properly
constituted tribunal.
I have, &c.

Atrocities in New Guinea. —ln the Anglo New Zealander aud Australasian Times
there are particulars of some startling charges which have been brought against the
expedition to New Guinea organized by the Melbourne Age newspaper. The charges
were first formulated in a statement made to a Sydney newspaper by a young man
named Thomas Kerry, who served in the expedition. Kerry stated, that about 4< p.m.
■ S 2


on the Queen’s birthday, while sailing down one of the rivers, they were attacked by
Natives, who advanced against the vessel in 23 large war canoes. The canoes were the
largest Kerry ever saw, and must have contained fully 1,200 men. As they came
towards the expedition schooner, the savages sang war songs, brandished spears, bows
and arrows, and gave horrible yells. The schooner ran among the canoes, keeping up a
running fire. The lighting continued until 7 o’clock, when the savages retired, but
subsequently resumed the attack, and the position of the explorers became so perilous
that they resolved upon a desperate experiment. The medicine chest was emptied, and
half filled with powder and dynamite. Two fuses were attached to it and lighted, and
the improvised infernal machine was thrown among the savages. The result was
terrible. Two or three canoes were blown into the air, and from 90 to 100 men must
have perished. As the Natives still threatened them, the explorers decided that their
only chance of safety was to abandon the schooner. The anchor was therefore tripped,
and the explorers got into a small boat, taking with them a little dry oatmeal, the
firearms, and plenty of ammunition. At midnight the sail and helm were lashed, with
the object of sending her up the river, and so deceiving the savages. The explorers
landed safely, and started to march for the coast. Towards the end of May they were
again attacked, but after the white men had succeeded in killing 400 Natives, the
remainder ran away. The exploring party sustained no casualties, with the exception
of a spear wound in the foot received by Kerry. The Anglo New Zealander says that
in the accounts of the expedition published in the Age nothing is said of the terrible loss
of life described by Kerry.

I Ait directed by Earl Granville to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before
the Earl of Derby, for his consideration in connexion with the previous correspondence
upon the subject of New Guinea and the Western Pacific, duplicate printed copies of
two notes from the German Ambassador at this Court replying on behalf of his

(Translation.) German Embassy, January 28, 1885.
Since the undersigned had the honour of informing the Royal British Government,
by note of the 26th December last, that the German Settlements on the north coast
of New Guinea and in the New Britain Archipelago had been placed under the
protection of His Majesty the Emperor, Sir E. Malet has addressed a note to His
Majesty’s Government, under date of the 17th instant, to inform them that the
Commodore on the Australian Station had received instructions to proclaim the
Protectorate of Her Majesty in New Guinea, from East Cape to the Gulf of Huou,
which it was understood may be looked upon as the boundary of the German
annexations, and also over the Louisiade and Woodlark groups of islands.
It is at the same time observed in the note that the D’Entrecasteaux Islands were
included in the earlier Proclamation,
The undersigned is instructed to answer that note as follows;
After the negotiations which had been carried on between the two Cabinets on this
subject since the beginning of August last, the Royal British Government cannot have
been less prepared for the announcement of the German annexation than were the
Government of His Majesty the Emperor in October last for the news that England had
taken possession by Proclamation of the whole of the south coast of New'Guinea and of
the adjacent islands.


By instructions sent to him by his Government on the 2nd August last, the under-
signed was enabled to inform Her Majesty’s Secretary for Foreign Affairs on the Bth of
the same month that the Imperial Government intended to place under the direct
protection of the Empire, as had been done in West Africa, so now also in the South
Sea, those districts in which German commerce has become predominant, or to which
expeditions, whose justification can be denied by no one, were about to be undertaken.
At the same time the undersigned expressed the wish of his Government to come to an
understanding with the Royal British Government about the geographical delimitation
of the districts in the South Sea under the sovereignty or protection of either party, and
generally concerning the principles to be applied within these districts by the one party
to the subjects of the other party.
That by this an understanding concerning the boundaries of impending annexations
was meant, follows from the fact that at that time districts under German sovereignty
did not yet exist in the South Sea, but only districts in which German commerce
predominated, or whither “ expeditions had been dispatched.”
As far as regards New Guinea, the undersigned designated the claim to the whole of
that part of the island not under Butch dominion, which had found loud expression in
Australia since the appearance of a German newspaper article in 1883, recommending it
for German colonization, as totally unjustifiable. He made the observation that England
had as yet made no legal annexation in New Guinea, and that there, as also in the Angra
Pequena affair, the principle, which had been successfully maintained in common with
England against Spain, ten years before, in the affair of the Caroline, Pelew, and Sulu
Islands, was still considered in force by the Government of His Majesty the Emperor;
according to this, only such titles to sovereignty are to be recognised as are actually
enforced.
Although by this [in the abstract the whole independent portion of New Guinea
formed in principle quite as justifiable an object of German as of English undertakings,
the Imperial Government desired nevertheless to recognise as justified the wish of the
Australians that no foreign power should settle on the south coast of New Guinea in the
region of the Torres Straits opposite Queensland.
As the Imperial Government contests in principle a natural right of the Australians
to New Guinea and the other independent island districts of the South Sea, this step
could not by any means indicate an intention of seeking the approval of the British
Government for the contemplated acquisitions.
The object of that step was rather the wish to avoid the possibility of collisions.
After that the expedition to New Guinea and the New Britain Archipelago, which
had been taken in hand in the spring of last year, and was under Imperial protection,
had become known in Australia by consequence of revelations and attacks against the
Imperial policy in the Budget Commission of the German Reichstag of the 26th June,
it was to be feared that English subjects would endeavour to put difficulties in the
way of this undertaking, and to provide against this was the object of the German
action.
An exchange of views followed the conversation of the Bth August last, which
terminated, as the Imperial Government has up till now understood the matter, with a
distinct promise from the Royal British Government that they would limit their intended
Protectorate in New Guinea to the south coast opposite Australia, and to the islands
adjacent to that coast.
The Imperial Government has been, therefore, more painfully surprised by the
contents of Sir E. Malet’s note of the 17th instant than the English Government could
be by any step taken by this Government.
In the first place the undersigned has to protest against the assumption, that in
the conversation of the Bth August last with Lord Granville, he limited the pretensions
of Germany to the north coast of New Guinea to this, “ that there were parts of
“ the wild country on this coast which might be available as a field for German colonial
“ enterprise.”
On the contrary, he described the whole independent part of the north coast as the
subject of a German colonial undertaking already in course of being carried out.
It is true that Lord Granville remarked at the time that Germany, at least up till
then, had founded no Settlements in New Guinea.
His Excellency could not, however, forbear observing, on his side, that there were
absolutely no English Settlements there.
The Secretary of State then remarked to the undersigned confidentially that
negotiations were proceeding about New Guinea with the Australian Colonies, and that
S 3


their conclusion in the sense of an annexation of the southern portion of the island was
imminent.
A doubt as to the geographical extent of this territory was the less likely to occur
to the undersigned, as Lord Granville, after having discussed the matter with the
other English Ministers, on the 9th August made the following communication in
writing :
“ The extension of some form of British authority in New Guinea, which will be
shortly announced, will only embrace that part of the island which specially interests the
Australian Colonies, without any prejudice to any territorial questions beyond those
limits.”
The concluding words of this note, “ without prejudice,” &c., could not be otherwise
understood, after the discussion which had taken place with the undersigned and his
Government, than as implying that the English occupation would not be extended along
the coasts beyond these limits; but rather that the status quo ante should remain in
force with regard to this coast, according to which it was legally res nullius.
The Imperial Government would have been therefore fully justified in at once issuing
the order to take possession of the whole north coast as far as East Cape. This, however,
was not done, because it was assumed by Germany that the proposed Commission for the
settlement of the geographical delimitation of the respective territories in the South Sea
was to deal with the interior limits of the island as far as New Guinea was concerned.
But the latter might offer more difficulties in the narrow eastern promontory than west-
wards towards the interior.
The Imperial Government were, therefore, all the more surprised when they received
the note of the ,19th September from Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Berlin, in
which it was notified, in contradiction of Lord Granville’s communication of the
9th August, that the English .Government intended to proclaim a Protectorate over
all the coasts of New Guinea not occupied by the Netherlands, that is, over all
the southern coasts,.and over the northern coasts besides, with the exceptions of that
portion of these coasts lying between the Netherlands boundary and the 145th degree
of east longitude.
The observation in the note of the 19th September, to which reference was made
lately in Sir E. Malet’s note of the 17th of this month, and which runs as follows:
“ The 145th degree of east longitude-has been fixed as the western British limit on the
“ northern coast, in order that it should embrace the territory owned by the natives on
“ the Maclay Coast, whose claim for British protection has long been under the con-
“ sideration of Her Majesty’s Government, and was one of the principal reasons which
“ determined the Cabinet to advise the Queen to assume the responsibility of establishing
“ a Protectorate in New Guinea,” was no convincing reason for the Imperial Government
to withdraw all claim to the fulfilment of the promise made to them by England on the
9th August. Many petitions have been laid before the Imperial Government, since the
formation of the Empire, to occupy unclaimed territories, without their having decided,
as is well known, till two years ago, to comply with some of these wishes.
The undersigned has already had occasion to communicate to Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment that this very expedition to the north coast of New Guinea was already projected in
1880, and since then has formed a matter of consideration for the Government of His
Imperial Majesty the Emperor.
On the other hand, the English Blue Books shows that the petitions which the
English Government wish now to lay stress upon have formerly been repeatedly rejected.
After the experiences which the Imperial Government have undergone in Angra
Pequena, on the Gold Coast, and lately also in Zululand, it would appear as if the
possession, too, of New Guinea had become an object of desire for England from the
time that Germany turned her eyes in that direction. That it is a necessity for the
Australian Colonies cannot be maintained in face of the fact that their population, notably
that of Queensland, is not yet sufficient to colonise even the coast-line of the Australian
Continent.
The Imperial Charge d’Affaires, Baron von Plessen, was accordingly instructed on the
25th September last to call attention to the contradiction existing between the contents of
Mr. Scott’s note of the 19th September and Lord Granville’s promise of the 9th August.
Hereupon the Imperial Government received to their satisfaction, in a note from Mr. Scott
dated the 9th October, the following declaration, which was in harmony with the promise
made on the 9th August, “ That Her Majesty’s Government have carefully considered
“ the communication which Baron von Plessen was instructed to make on the proposed
“ limit of this Protectorate, and have decided that the declaration to be made shall limit
“ the British Protectorate to the whole of the southern coast, including the islands contiguous


“ to it instead of that which they had at first proposed. This will lie done without
“ prejudice to any territorial question beyond those limits.” "~
A few days afterwards the English Government published a Proclamation exactly
answering to the above declaration, together with a map showing the extent of the
English Protectorate.
The Imperial Government was accordingly justified in assuming that the unoccupied
northern coast of the island was not only considered as no-man’s-land, but also that it
remained open to the German Government to annex it with the full consent of the
English Government, and that it only remained to fix the boundaries on either side in
the interior of the island. The possibility of a misunderstanding or conflict of interests
would thus be excluded. All formal obstacles seemed to them also now to be removed
which might have stood in the way of the taking possession on their part of the coast-
line from Huon Bay to East Cape. This view was confirmed by the following passage
in Mr. Scott’s note of the 9th October, quoted in Sir E. Malet’s note of the IJth instant:—
“It is with great satisfaction that Her Majesty’s Government have come to an
arrangement in which they find themselves in perfect accord with Germany.”
It is all the more surprising to the Imperial Government to find, in spite of the
above, that Baron Plessen’s observation, contained in his communication of the 27th
September, to the effect that, in the opinion of the Imperial Government, a friendly
agreement on the subject of the delimitation of the regions in which the two Powers are
interested on that coast might be arrived at by means of settlement by a Commission, is
now interpreted as if Germany, in the hope of the issue of the proposed negotiations by
Commission being favourabie to her, had bound herself for an indefinite period, even if
the negotiations lasted for years, not to take possession of any land in any part of New
Guinea or elsewhere, while England considered herself justified in occupying the whole
south coast of New Guinea, including the coast-line on the eastern extremity. This
assumption is contrary to the first postulate of the friendly agreement proposed by the
Imperial Government, that is, the principle that both nations have equal rights.
Then the Imperial Government were only lately made aware of the fact that such an
expectation couid seriously be laid before the Imperial Government on behalf of England,
through Mr. Meade, English Delegate at the Berlin Conference, the object of whose
proposals w r as to entirely exclude Germany from New Guinea. The opinion entertained
by the Imperial Government of these proposals was communicated to Her Majesty’s
Government by the undersigned in consequence of the instructions forwarded, to him on
the 29th December of last year and on the 10th instant.
Mr. Scott’s note of the 9th October contained the following passage ;
“In case any questions should arise as to those districts ” (of New Guinea) “ which
lie beyond the limit described, Her Majesty’s Government are of opinion that it would, be
better to deal with them diplomatically, than to refer them to the Commission which it is
proposed to appoint with regard to the islands in the Pacific.”
If Her Majesty’s Government held the view that until the termination of the
diplomatic negotiations no annexation was to take place in New Guinea, then it is they
who, by proclaiming the English Protectorate over the whole south coast, including the
easternmost portion of New Guinea, after themselves making this declaration, first acted
m contradiction to their declaration. The Imperial Government had given orders for the
hoisting of their flag so far back as August of last year, directly after the receipt of Lord
Granville’s declaration of the 9th of that month, and protest on their part against the
reproach of having acted in contravention of an undertaking entered into by them.
It appears clearly from the declarations of Her Majesty’s Government, and from the
English official map already mentioned, that the English Protectorate was to be limited to
the south of East Cape by a line coinciding with 152° east longitude (of Greenwich).
The statement made in Sir E. Malet’s note of the 17th instant, to the effect that the
D’Entrecasteaux Islands, off the north coast, were already included in the Proclamation of
a Protectorate made by England on the 6th November of last year, is equally at variance
with the assurances given to the Imperial Government by Her Majesty’s Government on
the 9th August and 9tb October of last year, as -well as with the text of the Proclamation
and the boundary clearly marked on the officially published map.
This also disposes of Sir E. Malet’s inquiry, contained in a second note of the
17th instant addressed to the Imperial Government, as to the extent of the German
Protectorate.
For the Imperial Government intended from the first to place under their protection
the whole northern coast, from the Netherlands frontier to East Cape, with the adjacent
islands.
S 4


It is not conclusive of tiie question, on how many spots on the north coast the
Imperial flag has been hoisted as visible proof of the German Protectorate. This question
on the part of the English Government is all the more remarkable, since, as is well known,
the whole of tiie south coast of the island was in the same way placed under the protection
of Her Majesty the Queen of England only by means of the symbolical act of hoisting
the flag, which was performed at only a few places.
The title of Germany to the whole of the north coast could not therefore be confuted,
even if, in opposition to the understanding come to between the two Governments in
August and in October, the English flag should now have been hoisted, to the regret of
the Imperial Government, on isolated portions of the north coast, and on the islands
contiguous.
To allege as a motive of the action resolved upon by the English Government the
desire to avoid any disputes which might arise from an absence of jurisdiction on the
coast of New Guinea cannot be regarded by the Government of His Majesty the Emperor
as sufficient; since already, in the course of the exchange of views which took place
in August of last year, the question of the creation of a sufficient jurisdiction in the
districts of the Protectorates of both countries was raised by the undersigned. In the
absence of any English Settlement there can be no pressing necessity on this point on the
side of England.
As regards the islands in the Archipelago of New Britain, the undersigned remarks
that there was never any intention on the part of the Imperial Government to make the
occupation of these islands the subject of negotiation between Germany and England.
For on these groups of islands there have existed, as was remarked already by the
undersigned in his conversation of the Bth August, for some time past, exclusively German
Settlements, and that, too, to an extent of which the tenth part would have formed
sufficient protest to the English Government for long since taking possession of this
archipelago.
If it should be objected on the English side that the Imperial Government ought to
have come to an understanding with the British Government before this annexation
concerning possible interests of England or her Colonies there, such an objection is
not in harmony with the attitude of England towards Germany on the coast of Africa.
For the first news of certain German acquisitions there sufficed to bring it about that
on the part of England, and that, too after the invitation to the West African Conference
had been sent, measures were 'taken or were approved which had for object to cut off
from the German acquisitions, by means of taking possession of large stretches of coast
such as those between Bimbia and Lagos, even the possibility of a further extension in the
Gulf of Guinea.
After these experiences the Imperial Government might possibly now also have to
expect the news of the planting of the English flag in the New Britain Archipelago, had
they not placed the Settlements there under their protection in time.
The undersigned is instructed to enter a protest against the Proclamation of the
Protectorate of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland (announced in Sir E.
Malet’s note of the 17th instant, and according to a telegraphic announcement from
Melbourne, already put into execution) over the part of the north coast of New Guinea
between East Cape and Huon Bay, as also over the D’Entrecasteaux, Woodlark, and other
islands adjacent to the north coast, as contrary to the promise of the English Government
given to the Imperial Government in official despatches.
The Imperial Government wish, however, on their side also to guard against any
cause of differences between the two Governments by coming to an understanding with
the British Government, by means of the above-mentioned Commission, respecting the
inland boundaries of the Protectorates of both parties in New Guinea, and more especially
in the east corner of the island, to which reference-has so frequently been made, and also
respecting the independent islands of the South Sea, where the interests of the one or of
the other predominate, and respecting the principles to be observed on both sides.
The undersigned has already had the honour to announce to his Excellency Lord
Granville, on the 29th December last, the arrival from Sydney for this purpose of the
Imperial Consul-General, Dr. Krauel.
The closing remark of Sir E. Malet’s note respecting a Treaty concluded by the
Imperial Consul-General at Apia with the King of Samoa will be answered by the
undersigned in a special note.

(Translation.)
German Embassy, January 28, 1885.
The note which the Royal British Ambassador at Berlin addressed on the 17th instant
to the Imperial Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with regard to New Guinea
concludes with the information that the Royal British Government have recently received
reports concerning the conclusion of a Treaty between the Representatives of Germany
and the King of Samoa, and presupposes that this Treaty will not be ratified so far as
the stipulations do not harmonize with the explanations previously exchanged between
Germany and England with regard to the maintenance of the independence of Samoa.
The undersigned is directed to reply in. a separate note upon this point, which is not
in direct connection with the New Guinea question, and has accordingly the honour, by
command of his Government, to give the following information to his Excellency Earl
Granville.
The Government of His Majesty the Emperor presumes that the present communication
from the Royal British Government with regard to the conclusion of a German-Samoan
Treaty refers to the Agreement which was signed in execution of Article YII, of the
German-Samoan Treaty of Friendship of the 24th January, 1879* on the 10th November
last, at Apia, between the Imperial Representative in Samoa, Consul-General Dr. Stuebel,
and the Government of that country.
While the Undersigned has the honour of inclosing, for the information of Her
Majesty’s Government, the annexed German translation of this Agreement, he expresses
the hope of his Government that the Royal British Government will be convinced that the
points agreed upon are within the limits of the German Treaty with Samoa, and encroach
neither on the independence of this group of islands nor on the rights acquired there by
other nations.
The advantages of greater legal security and of an improved penal administration in
Samoa, the institution of which is the object of the above Agreement, will benefit like-
wise the settlers who belong to the other Treaty Powers, while the Germans interested
will alone be liable under Article 7 for the cost of the arrangements agreed upon.
The Imperial Government has the intention of ratifying this Agreement, subject to a
closer examination of details, taking care that its stipulations shall also be strictly
observed on the part of the Samoanese.
They count on their exertions to bring about a condition of order in these islands not
being thwarted from other quarters.
The undersigned is instructed, with reference to this subject, to revert to the petitions
which were addressed on the sth November of last year by the Kings and Chiefs of
Samoa to Her Majesty the Queen of England, and to the Governor and Ministers of the
Colony of New Zealand.
The text of these petitions is now in the possession of the Imperial Government, and
confirms the supposition which had been expressed some time previously that they were
drawn up by English subjects, and signed under the influence of the deception that
Germany was contemplating an act of violence against the independence of Samoa.
It appears, moreover, that the King of Samoa, at the commencement of last year, had
already, by means of a similar petition, secretly offered the sovereignty over his country
to the Royal British Government.
The absence at the time of any disapproval of the conduct of those who had induced
the King to take this step has clearly contributed to encourage further attempts in this
direction. The Imperial Government expect with confidence that the instructions now'
contemplated by the Royal British Government will also have the result, of putting an
end to the agitation for the same object which is instigated from New Zealand.
The Undersigned avails himself, &c.

Agreement.
(Translation.)
In order to secure the advantages of a good government to the Germans who live in
Samoa, and in execution of Article YII of the Treaty of Friendship of the 24th January,
n 15064. T


1879. between Germany and Samoa, the Administrator of the Imperial Consulate for the
South Sea Islands, and the King, Viceroy, and Government of Samoa, have agreed upon
the following provisions:—
ARTICLE I.
A German-Samoan Council of State shall be formed. There shall belong to it the
German Consul or his substitute, two Samoans, of whom one shall be named by the King,
the other by the Viceroy, in concert with the Taimua and Faipule, and two Germans, who
shall be named by the German Consul.
ARTICLE 11.
The German-Samoan Council of State shall deliberate and determine upon all laws
and regulations whose introduction concerns {lit. corresponds with) the common interest
of the Samoan Government and of the Germans who reside in Samoa.
In particular, it shall lay down legal Ordinances, which shall be susceptible of
application to the penal acts of Samoans, if a German, or a subject of a foreign State in
German service, or a coloured labourer in the German service, or the property of such
persons, shall have been injured thereby.
Similar Ordinances shall be applicable to the penal acts of the coloured labourers in
the German service.
ARTICLE 111.
The Ordinances laid down by the German and Samoan Council of State shall be
issued as law by the King and Viceroy under their hand. It is to be mentioned in the
preamble that the law is issued after previous settlement by the German-Samoan Council
of State.
ARTICLE IV.
The King, in concert with the German Consul, shall appoint a German officer of
the Samoan Government. This officer shall be the Secretary and Counsellor of the King
in all matters which concern the Germans who reside in Samoa.
In penal matters, in which the Germans who reside in Samoa have an interest, so
long as not more than two years’ imprisonment with hard labour can be inflicted, he shall
exercise the office of a German Judge, in conjunction with a Samoan Judge, over
Samoan and coloured labourers who have been guilty of injuring Samoans or Samoan
property, alone over coloured labourers as respects penal acts committed by them amongst
themselves.
If more than two years’ imprisonment with hard labour can be inflicted, the German
Consul, together with a Samoan Judge, shall himself undertake the office of Judge, or
depute it to the German officer of the Samoan Government, or to some third person.
ARTICLE V.
With a view to provide for prisoners convicted on account of penal matters, in which
the Germans who reside in Samoa have an interest, a prison shall be erected.
Those condemned to imprisonment with hard labour shall be kept at suitable labour,
which can be converted into money to meet the expenses of management that are
incurred.
The German officer of the Samoan Government shall superintend all matters connected
with the prison.
ARTICLE VI.
The King shall, in conjunction with the German Consul, appoint police officials, who
shall discharge the service of the prison, and the duties of safeguarding the German
plantations. Such officials shall be subject to the orders of the German officer of the
Samoan Government.
ARTICLE VII.
The expenses rendered necessary in consequence of this Agreement shall be met out
of the law charges falling due, out of the fines, out of receipts from prisoners’ work, and


out of the taxes which are leviable on the Germans interested. A representative of
the German taxpayers shall be charged with the management of these moneys. The
imposition of the taxes, as well as the determination of the amount of the expenses, shall
be vested in the German-Saraoan Council of State.
ARTICLE VIII.
This Agreement shall come at once into force conditionally upon the approval of the
German Government. So long as that approval shall not have ensued, payment of taxes
shall not be liable to be exacted from Germans.
The Imperial German Government shall have the right to give notice of termination
of this Agreement, in which case it shall cease to be in force at the expiration of six
months.

I am directed by Earl Granville to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before
the Earl of Derby, copy of a letter which has been addressed to the German Ambassador
at this Court, informing him of the intentions of Her Majesty’s Government with
respect to the appointment of Commissioners to serve on the proposed Anglo-German
Commissions for the examination of the land claims of German subjects in Fiji, and
for the discussion of the respective interests of the two countries in the South Seas.
Enclosure in No. 165.
M. l’ Ambassadeur, Foreign Office, February 3,1885.
Your Excellency recently expressed a hope that Her Majesty’s Government would

over a certain portion of such country and the islands adjacent thereto.
And whereas Her Majesty having taken into Her Gracious consideration the urgent
necessity of Her protection to such inhabitants, has directed me to proclaim such pro-
tection in a formal manner at this place : Now, I, James Elphinstone Erskine, Captain
in the Royal Navy and Commodore of the Australian Station, one of Her Majesty’s
Naval Aides-de-Camp, do hereby, in the name of Her Most Gracious Majesty, declare
and proclaim the establishment of such Protectorate over such portions of the coast and

Sir, _ Downing Street, February 4, 1885.
I am directed by the Earl of Derby to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 29th ultimo,* enclosing a copy of a telegram which you had received from your
Government relating to the position of General Scratchley in connexion with the
administration of New Guinea.
The suggestion contained in this telegram that this country should bear part of the
expense connected with the administration of New Guinea, had not been expected by
Her Majesty’s Government, and places the whole question in a new aspect.
It has at every stage of the proceedings connected with the acquisition of New Guinea
been distinctly understood by Her Majesty’s Government, and they have never doubted
that the same was the understanding of the Convention at Sydney and of all the
Governments of the Australasian Colonies, that the Colonies, or some of them, were
pledged to bear the whole cost of any action that might be taken in connexion with
New Guinea in pursuance of the wishes of the Colonies,
It has, therefore, become necessary for Her Majesty’s Government to reconsider the
subject, more particularly with regard to the contemplated proclamation of British
sovereignty in New Guinea, as that step, once taken, would entail greater and more
permanent obligations than those of a Protectorate, and the suggestion of your
Government shall receive immediate attention.
Lord Derby has telegraphed to Lord A. Loftus his acceptance of the very liberal
offer of the “ Wolverene.” His Lordship had hesitated to do so in consequence of the
belief of the Admiralty that the ship was not in a sea-going condition, but he now
understands that she is being thoroughly refitted, and the loan of her will be a very
valuable assistance to General Scratchley.

which it is possible to base an objection to the occupation by Germany of places which
lie at a considerable distance from any of the British Colonies, and in which there have

Sir, Foreign Office, February 7, 1885.
I have received your Excellency’s Despatch of the 24th ultimo, || and I have read
with interest the account which it contains of the important conversation which you had
with Prince Bismarck at your interview of the 24tb, when you read to him my Despatch
of the 20th ultimo.^]
The Prince on that occasion spoke on the circumstances leading to the present political
estrangement between England and Germany, and proceeded to explain its causes from
the German point of view.
He stated that in his opinion Her Majesty’s Government had entirely failed to appre-
ciate the importance which his Government attached to their projects of colonization

and the value which they set upon the friendship of England; for he could not suppose,
had it been otherwise, that the successive 'annoyances to which Germany had been
exposed would not have been averted. He laid much stress on an important Despatch
which he appears to have addressed on the sth May last to the German ambassador in
London, and in which Count Munster was instructed to point out to Her Majesty’s
Government the service which England could render to Germany at the commencement
of her colonial enterprise ; that in return for such service Germany would support the
interests of England nearer home, and that such an understanding would be productive
of mutual advantage. The Prince added that he had sent his son, Count Herbert
Bismarck, to England in the hope that he might be able to promote the object in view,
but neither his son nor Count Munster had succeeded in obtaining more than general
assurances of good-will, which were of little value in the face of subsequent events.
The Prince complained of the “ closing-up ” system which he maintained had been
pursued by England at every point at which Germany had endeavoured to found a
Colony, so as to restrict her field of expansion.
Referring to the action of Germany in New Guinea, the Prince defended the establish-
ment of the German protectorate there, on the ground that Mr. Scott’s note of the 9th
October was understood as giving to the German Government full liberty of action with
regard to the northern part of that island.
He then questioned the right of England to hoist her flag in Zululand, on the ground
of a prior cession from King Panda to the Boers in 1840.
Finally, the Prince intimated that the understanding which Germany had arrived at
with France, owing to her failure to come to terms with England, precluded him from
taking up the question again on the basis proposed in his Despatch to Count Minister of
the sth Mayjastu;
Such appears to,be the substance of the Prince’s remarks, as reported in your Despatch,
and I need hardly say that Her Majesty’s Government would deeply regret that he
should consider that there is anything which approaches to a political estrangement
between the two countries. But in their opinion the foregoing views of their policy and
action and of the present situation are not warranted by the real facts of the case.
In the first place, I may unhesitatingly affirm that whatever feeling of estrangement
may exist in Germany against England, and whatever may be its cause, that feeling has
found no echo in this country. The sentiment here remains, as it always has been, most
friendly to the German Empire, and far from any desire existing on the part of the
British Government to obstruct in any way the expansion of the colonial policy of
Germany, they view with great satisfaction the opening up of new countries and the
development of trade by a people so long united to Englishmen by a community of
sentiments and of interests, and by all the ties which can bind two nations together.
The misunderstandings referred to by Prince Bismark in his conversation with your
Excellency are due to the suddenness with which Her Majesty’s Government became
acquainted with the departure by Germany from her traditional policy in regard to
colonization; and the misconceptions which have produced a change of attitude on the
part of Prince Bismarck towards this country can only be attributed to causes for which,
as I will presently show, Her Majesty’s Government are not responsible.
That Germany should be brought into closer relations of amity with France cannot
be a subject of regret to this country, but Her Majesty’s Government would greatly
deplore any diminution of her friendship towards England, especially if it were based on
an erroneous impression of the views and objects of Her Majesty’s Government and of
the feelings of the British people.
The belief of Prince Bismarck, that the policy of Her Majesty’s Government has
been intentionally hostile to German colonization, is so devoid of any real foundation,
that I think it desirable to enter at some length into the history of the case, from the
British point of view.
I may begin by stating that the despatch of Prince Bismarck to Count Munster of
the sth May, containing an exposition of the policy of Germany as to colonization and
of the understanding which he desired to bring about between England and Germany,
was never communicated to me.
Until the receipt of a Report from Lord Ampthill of the 14th June last of conversa-
tions he had had with Prince Bismarck, and up to the interviews which I had about the
same time with Count Herbert Bismarck, I was under the belief that the Chancellor was
personally opposed to German colonization.
The reports of Lord Ampthill were continuously and strongly to that effect, and on
the Is,th March 1884, his Excellency, referring to the agitation on the subject among
the shipping and commercial classes in Germany, stated that it was well known that the


Prince was absolutely opposed to their ardent desire for the acquisition of Colonies by
Germany, and was determined to combat and oppose their growing influence.
The anxiety expressed by Count Munster on behalf of his Government, that German
subjects should be protected at Angra Pequena, in no way removed the misapprehension
on my part.
But after the information received in June Lord Derby and I, together with our
colleagues, desired to meet the Prince’s views with regard to Angra Pequena in every
way compatible with the private rights of British subjects, and I know not how it can be
said that we departed from that course.
With regard to the observation, that my assurances to Count Herbert Bismarck were
only of a vague and general character, I must recall the fact that Count H. Bismarck
expressed to me his satisfaction with what I had said, a satisfaction repeated in very
friendly terms by the Chancellor to Lord Ampthill.
It was even then not clear whether the wishes of the German Government went
beyond the extension of the necessary protection to Herr Luderitz and the German
settlers on that coast. That right was not contested, and everything w T as done by Her
Majesty’s Government to meet Prince Bismarck’s views in that respect.
It was not until the announcement that the German flag had been hoisted at Angra
Pequena by the Commander of an Imperial ship of war, that Her Majesty’s Government
were made positively aware that the intention of the German Government was the
foundation of a territorial Protectorate.
Immediately on receipt of this intelligence, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Berlin
was instructed to inform the German Government that if that were their intention, Her
Majesty’s Government would welcome Germany as a neighbour on those parts of the
South-west Coast which were not already within the limits of the Cape Colony, and
not actually in British possession; and from that time Her Majesty’s Government
declined to sanction the proposals of the Cape Colony for further annexations on that
coast. ■
Prince Bismarck is mistaken in attributing to the action of the Secretary of State
for the Colonies a step taken in that direction by the Cape Government after the.
announcement of the German Protectorate, for so far from this being the case, it has
been very clearly shown in the Memorandum communicated by your Excellency to the
German Government on the 10th October last, that the project of extending British
jurisdiction on that coast originated from the Cape Government, and that as soon as the
establishment of the German Protectorate w r as known to Her Majesty’s Government
they declined to give their sanction to the Resolution of the Cape Parliament, which was
passed shortly before that event.
After the establishment of the German Protectorate of Angra Pequena and the
explanations which followed, there could no longer be any doubt as to the policy of
colonization adopted by Prince Bismarck, and since vigorously pursued by Germany, and
Her Majesty’s Government have generally had no reason to oppose it. Indeed, a field
was open to Germany, both in the East and the West, without entrenching on the
legitimate sphere of action of Great Britain. But Her Majesty’s Government would
have been unmindful of their duties had they neglected to place under the protection of
the British flag territories contiguous to British Colonies, the occupation of which by any
other Power would seriously prejudice British interests. The introduction of a foreign
administrative and commercial regime in territories where British traders had long been
settled, and had carried on a flourishing and unrestricted trade, would have obviously
raised important practical questions for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government.
Moreover, the possibility of the creation by some Powers of penal settlements in the
vicinity of British Colonies was a contingency which Her Majesty’s Government were
bound, if possible, to avert, as being highly injurious to the well-being and prosperity of
those communities.
There were also territories to which the British Crown had an inchoate title by cession
or otherwise, which had not been perfected by actual possession.
Impelled, therefore, by the above consideration, and certainly not by any wish to
oppose the colonial policy of Germany, Her Majesty’s Government took measures to
secure British influence and control over territories to which they conceived that this
country had an equitable and preferential claim, or the acquisition of which was deemed
essential to the safety or welfare of some neighbouring British possession.
Tdo not propose in this Despatch to enter into the history of each particular case.
I will only touch at present on the points referred to by Prince Bismarck in conversation
with your Excellency, and commencing with Santa Lucia Bay, I have to express my
U 2


I
approval of the reply which your Excellency returned to the Chancellor’s remarks
respecting the hoisting of the British flag in that locality.
The history of the case is as follows :
On the sth October 1843, Panda, King of the Zulus by a deed, of which a copy
has been already furnished to the Imperial Government, ceded the bay and mouth of the
River Qmvoloosi to Her Majesty the Queen.
The title thus acquired by this country has been recognised, and has never been
relinquished, and during recent years Great Britain has been in possession of the
Transvaal, so that there can be no question as to the extinction of all prior claims if any
such existed. The bay is marked as British in German maps.
It is only some 40 miles distant from the boundary of the Zulu reserve, and if the
troubles on the frontier of the reserve should continue to increase, it would be of the
first importance to Her Majesty’s Government to be able to check tiie importation of
arms and ammunition through this port.
This they could not do were the port in the hands of any foreign Power, and accord-
ingly the British flag was hoisted over it.
The reasons, therefore, which actuated this step were in no way founded on any
jealousy of foreign trade, but solely on the necessity of securing over the district in
question that measure of Imperial control, without which the good order and government
of the neighbouring possessions of Her Majesty might have been seriously imperilled.
For similar and equally cogent reasons, her Majesty’s Government felt themselves
compelled to proclaim a British Protectorate over the coast of the country known as
Pondoland, which lies between the Cape Colony and the Colony of Natal.
As regards the Cameroons and adjacent territories, their annexation or Protectorate
had been under the consideration of Her Majesty’s Government as far back as 1879,
though for various reasons they deferred any final action in the matter until a recent
date.
British interests, however, in those territories, are notoriously paramount, and indeed,
with the exception of the German houses in the Cameroons, the whole trade may be
said to be in British hands.
In November 1883, therefore, the British Cabinet decided to annex the Settlement of
Victoria to the dominions of the Crown, and to establish her Majesty’s Protectorate
over the adjacent territories commonly known as “ the Oil River districts.”
The actual Proclamation as regards Victoria was made on the 19th July 1884, and
Treaties establishing the Oil River Protectorates have also been concluded.
The question of New Guinea I propose to deal with separately in reply to a note
which I have since received on the 29th ultimo from the German Ambassador.
I need merely say at present that I approve your Excellency’s language to Prince
Bismarck on that subject.
I have only now to observe upon the remark which has been attributed to me, to
the effect that the attitude of Germany on the colonial question made it difficult for me
to be conciliatory on other points. I have never used any threat to obstruct the colonial
policy of Germany, or conveyed anything more than the mere fact that the recent
attitude of Germany as to Egypt had for the moment changed from the friendly one
previously maintained towards this country. All my declarations in public and private,
as well as those of Mr. Gladstone, and many of my colleagues, have been most favourable
to German colonization.
I authorise your Excellency to leave a copy of this Despatch with Prince Bismarck.

Earl Granville to Count Munster.
M. l’Ambassadeur, Foreign Office, February 7> 1885.
On the 14th ultimo I had the honour to receive from your Excellency a pro
memoria respecting the negotiations between the British and German Governments in
relation to New Guinea.
On the previous day I had addressed a despatch to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at
Berlin, instructing him to make a communication to the German Government on the
same subject, and to notify to them the extension of the Queen’s Protectorate from
East Cape to the Gulf of Huon.' That instruction was carried out by his Excellency in
a note to Count Hatzfeldt of the 17th ultimo.
On the 21st ultimo your Excellency called at this Office and communicated the
substance of a telegram from your Government, directing you to inquire whether it was
true, as stated by Sir E. Malet, that Her Majesty’s Government had proclaimed a
Protectorate over that portion of the coast of New Guinea which lay between East Cape
and the Huon Gulf, because, in the opinion of the German Government, their
proclamation of sovereignty over the northern coast included the district in question,
and the step stated to have been taken by Her Majesty’s Government was also, in the
opinion of the German Government, not in keeping with the terms of Mr. Scott’s note
of the 9th October, by which Her Majesty’s Government undertook to limit their
Protectorate to the southern coast.
On the 29th ultimo I had the honour to receive from your Excellency a note, dated
the previous day, communicating the answer which you had been instructed by your
Government to return to Sir E. Malet’s note of the 17th ultimo.
Your Excellency’s note recapitulates the whole course of the negotiations from the
point of view of your Government, and concludes with a protest against the extension of
the Queen’s Protectorate in New Guinea, as notified by Her Majesty’s Ambassador.
I do not intend at present to deal in detail with the various statements and arguments
contained in your Excellency’s note, but I am anxious, without further delay, to make
the following observations.
The chief point at issue would seem to be whether in September last, when Her
Majesty’s Government abandoned their original project of establishing a British
Protectorate over all the coasts of New Guinea not occupied by the Netherlands, except
that portion of the north coast comprised between the 141st and 145th degree of east
* Not printed. f Enclosure 1 in No. 164.
U 3


longitude, and when they consequently restricted their Protectorate to the south coast,
there w T as not an understanding between the two Governments that neither of them
should take any step involving the annexation of any portion of the still unoccupied
coasts of New Guinea without a previous agreement by means of a Commission or of
diplomatic negotiations.
That such an understanding did exist appears very clearly from the following
correspondence.
On the 19th September Mr. Scott, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Berlin,
announced to the German Government the original project of Her Majesty’s Government
to proclaim the British Protectorate as far as the 145th degree of east longitude.
On the 2/th September Baron Plessen, the German Charged’Affaires in this country,
informed Her Majesty’s Government that their proposal to include in the British
Protectorate the north and north-cast coasts of New Guinea was unexpected by the
Imperial Government, and that, according to their conception, the delimitation of the
areas which interest both sides on that stretch of coast should be the object of a friendly
understanding by means of a Commission.
I do not propose to deal here with the reasons, given in your Excellency’s note, for
the opposition raised by your Government at that time to the establishment of the British
Protectorate as far as the 145th degree of east longitude. But I desire to advert to those
passages in which it is stated that, on the Bth August last, your Excellency had informed
me that the German Government intended to place under their direct protection districts
in which German commerce was predominant, or to which German expeditions
“ were about to be undertaken,” and, further, that the whole independent part of the
north coast “ was the subject of a German colonial undertaking already in course of
being carried out.”
The argument which is apparently sought to be deduced from those passages is,
that on the Bth August your Excellency had, in fact, given notice to Her Majesty’s
Government of the intention of the German Government to occupy the north coast of
New Guinea.
It is with regret, M. I’Ambassadeur, that I must here take exception to your account
of what passed between us on the Bth August last.
I inclose a copy of my despatch to the late Lord Ampthill of the 9th August*
recording our conversation upon the occasion in question, and I beg to remind your
Excellency that I submitted the draft of that despatch to you at the time, and that you
agreed Avith me that it contained a correct account of our conversation. In it no mention
is made of any German colonial undertaking in New Guinea, or of any decision on the pait
of the German Government, either expressed or implied, to establish a Protectorate over
any part of that island.
Nor did Baron Plessen’s note of the 27th September contain any intimation of the
kind ; but it expressed, as above stated, the Avish of his Government that the stretch of
coast on the north and north-east should be the subject of a friendly arrangement.
Accordingly, in answer to that note, Mr. Scott, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at
Berlin, Avas instructed to inform the German Government that, having considered Baron
Plessen’s communication, Her Majesty’s Government had decided to restrict the British
Protectorate to the southern coast and contiguous islands, but “Avithout prejudice to any
teiTitorial question beyond these limits.”
Those words, which have apparently been misapprehended by the German Govern-
ment, had especial reference to the statement in Baron Plessen’s note of the 27th,
that, in the opinion of his Government, the question of the delimitation of the interests
of the tAvo countries on the north and north-east coasts should be the subject of a friendly
understanding by means of a Commission; and I desire particularly to draw the attention
of your Government to the terms of Mr. Scott’s note to Dr. Busch of the 9th October,
conveying the reply of Her Majesty’s Government, in Avhich it was stated that if any
questions should arise Avith regard to the districts beyond the southern coast, to which
Her Majesty’s Government had consented to restrict the British Protectorate, it Avould be
better to deal with them diplomatically than to refer them to the Commission, as
suggested by the German Government.
Her Majesty’s Government, therefore, consider themselves justified in maintaining
that the adoption of East Cape as the British northern limit was a provisional arrangement.
From that time until the announcement of the hoisting of the German flag in Ncav
Guinea, Her Majesty’s Government received no communication from the Imperial
Government which could lead them to suppose that they did not entirely acquiesce in
that arrangement.
* Enclosure in No, 5.


On the contrary, as recently as the 15th December your Excellency, in a verbal
communication, expressed the satisfaction of your Government at the receipt of Sir
E. Malet’s memorandum of the sth December respecting the islands of Samoa and
Tonga, in which it was stated that Her Majesty’s Government did not contemplate any
fresh arrangements in the Pacific pending the result of the discussion agreed to between
the two Governments, and your Excellency was instructed to observe that the annexation
of a portion of New Guinea by Great Britain had placed Germany at some disadvantage,
but that your Government took note of the assurance of Her Majesty’s Government,
that no further annexations would take place until after the proposed discussion of the
British and German interests in the South Seas.
It could not for a moment be supposed that such a communication was intended to
mean that Germany should be at liberty to make annexations in New Guinea and
elsewhere in the South Seas while England was to be debarred from so doing.
It was, therefore, with surprise that Her Majesty’s Government received, on the
10th December, the announcement, through Sir E. Malet, that, without anv previous
understanding, the German flag had been hoisted at ten places in New Britain, New
Ireland, and Sableland, and at three places on the north coast of New Guinea.
On the same day Her Majesty’s Government received a telegram from the British
Commodore on the Australian Station, reporting that the Commander of the German
ship-of-war “ Elisabeth ” had stated to the Commander of Her Majesty’s ship “ Swinger”
that the German flag had been hoisted on the north coast of New Guinea from the 141st
degree to Huon Gulf, including the Admiralty, Hermit, Anchorite, New Britain, and
New Ireland groups.
Immediately on receipt of this intelligence, and in consequence of the action of the
German Government, instructions were despatched by Her Majesty’s Government to
the Commodore on the Australian Station to proclaim the British Protectorate between
East Cape and the Gulf of Huon up to the German boundary, and also over the
Louisiade and Woodlark groups, and Long Island and Rook Island, provided he
found no evidence of a German Protectorate having been proclaimed over the two
latter islands.
This shows that it has throughout been the intention of Her Majesty’s Government
that the German boundary should not be encroached upon wherever it had been
established.
The British naval officer, who was entrusted with the execution of the above
instructions, reported that there was no sign of the German flag, and that nothing was
known of Germans by the natives up to Cape King William; that he had accordingly
hoisted the British flag on that cape as the northern point of British occupation, and
also over the islands mentioned in his instructions.
It will be remembered that Cape King William is the point at which, as stated in
Mr. Scott’s note of the 19th September, “ commences that part of the coast extending
“ to the Dutch southern boundary, which, for obvious reasons, it is indispensable to bring
“ under British control.”
The Imperial Government has itself admitted that the desire of, the Australian
Colonies to have control over the south coast of New Guinea was reasonable, and I
would now' point out to your Excellency that if, in September last, Her Majesty’s
Government had insisted on proclaiming the British Protectorate not only along the
south coast, but up to the 145th degree of east longitude, as they originally intended,
they would have been within their strict rights.
But out of deference to the representations of the German Government, Her
Majesty’s Government consented to restrict their Protectorate to East Cape, upon the
understanding, as I have shown, that all questions having reference to the districts
beyond that limit should be reserved for ulterior discussion.
The sudden establishment, therefore, of the German Protectorate over, a portion of
the coast from which Her Majesty’s Government had thus withdrawn, and over the vast
islands lying off the north-east coast of New Guinea, without any previous under-
standing with Her Majesty’s Government, entirely altered the position, and Her Majesty’s
Government consider that they were fully entitled to resume their liberty of qction as
regards the extension of their Protectorate up to the German boundary.
It has been argued in your Excellency’s note that the understanding as to the
delimitation of the respective territories in the South Seas had reference, so far as New
Guinea is concerned, to the interior of the island.
But, in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, there can be no reasonable ground
for such an interpretation, wdiich, moreover, would be opposed to the express words of
Baron Plessen’s note of the 2/ th September, where it is stated that, according to the
U 4


conception of your Government, the delimitation of the areas which interest both sides
(“ interessen-spharen ”) on that stretch of coast should be the object of a friendly
understanding by means of a Commission.
Her Majesty’s Government cannot, therefore, admit the validity of the protest,
which your Excellency has been instructed to make on behalf of your Government,'
against the extension of the British Protectorate over the north-east coast of New
Guinea and the islands adjacent; but, as the claims advanced by the German Government
appear to extend beyond the limits of the coast actually taken possession of by its
officers, if the German Government continue of opinion that the boundary proclaimed by
Her Majesty’s naval officers has encroached upon the limits of the German Protectorate,
and that there has been a mutual misunderstanding on the subject, Her Majesty’s
Government are willing to examine the question in a friendly manner with the German
Government, in order to settle the best point on the north-east coast of New Guinea for
the boundary of the British and German Protectorates.
I have, &c.

Sir, Downing Street, February 9» 1885.
In reply to your letter of the 2nd instant,* forwarding, for the consideration of the
Earl of Derby, a printed copy of a note from Count Munster, dated the 28th of January,
respecting Samoa, I am directed by his Lordship to submit the following observations :
A State Council in which Germans alone are represented, will, in the opinion of Lord
Derby, give to that nationality a preponderance in the political relations of the Samoans
towards other foreigners, which cannot but be injurious to the interests of British settlers
in the islands, for the arrival of a British mercantile competitor might be alleged as a
danger to German interests, and the State Council be pressed to determine upon laws and
regulations to operate exclusively in favour of the Germans; and as it would not be
possible for Her Majesty’s Government to accept a position of less influence and con-
sideration than is given to Germany by this treaty, it would apparently be necessary
for Her Majesty’s Government to call upon the Samoan King to enter into a pre-
cisely similar treaty for the benefit of British subjects, in order to secure the most
favoured nation treatment guaranteed by Art. H. of the British Treaty of August 28,
1879-
If this treaty had been confined to the establishment of a Court, and the procedure
to be observed in civil or criminal cases, and the punishment of offences in which German
subjects are concerned, for which alone Art. YH. of the German Treaty of 1879 provides,
the provisions of it would not be open to criticism ; but the creation of a State Council,
the appointment of a German officer of the Samoan Government, and the enrolment of
a German police to protect the plantations of German subjects appears to place Her
Majesty’s subjects at a disadvantage, and will prevent the Samoan Government from
acting independently in matters which affect the whole community. The arrangement
seems to give to Germany alone much of the influence which Lord Granville in
September 7, 1880, thought was too great an interference with the island government
to allow of its being assumed by the representatives of England, Germany, and the
United States of America, conjointly.
Lord Derby has no knowledge of the circumstances attending the preparation of the
petitions from the King and Chiefs of Samoa of the sth of November last, beyond what
is stated by Mr. Churchward in his despatch of the 11th November 1884, {* and in the
telegrams from the Governor of New Zealand of December 31, and 6th and 9th
January! last, and his Lordship has no reason to suppose that there is any foundation
for Count Munster’s complaints. The feeling in Samoa in favour of English annexation
appears to be spontaneous, national, and genuine.

I am directed by the Earl of Derby to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the

I am to observe that, as Lord Derby telegraphed to the Governor of New Zealand on
the 19th ultimof that Prince Bismarck had declared in the Reichstag that the agreement
to observe the status quo in Samoa would be observed, and that consequently no colonial
action in the direction of British annexation could be approved, there seems to be no

I see that it is stated at page 59 of the recent German White Book respecting
German interests in the South Seas that the pro memoria attached to Count Hatzfeldt’s
Despatch to your Excellency of August 2nd of last year was communicated to me in
the form of an aide-memoire.
The same statement was made to Mr. Meade when conversing with Dr. Busch and
M. von Kusserow in December last, and I enclose for your Excellency’s information, a
copy of a despatch which I addressed to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at that time,
explaining that no aide-memoire on the subject of the Pacific had been given to me by
your Excellency.
As this statement has now appeared in an official publication of the German Govern-
ment, and, being contrary to fact, is calculated to mislead public opinion, I have
to beg that you will be good enough to call the attention of your Government to the
inaccuracy.

Sir, Foreign Office, December 29, 1884,
From Mr. Meade’s memorandum of his recent conversation with Dr. Busch
and M. ! Von Kusserow, of the German Foreign Office, inclosed in your Despatch
of the 14th instant, it appears that they stated that in July or August of this
year, Count Munster was ordered to inform Her Majesty’s Government that a German
expedition was going to the north coast of New Guinea, and that later his Excel-
lency was desired to leave an aide-memoire with me on the subject.
I have to acquaint your Excellency that no aide-memoire on the subject of the islands
in the South Pacific has been given to me by Count Munster.
He communicated to me on the Bth of August the substance of one which he had
received from Berlin, and you will find it recorded together with the terms of my reply
in my Despatch to the late Lord Arapthill, of the 9th of August.
I submitted the draft of this Despatch to Count Munster, who agreed with me that it

Earl Granville to Count Munster.
M l’Ambassaueur, Foreign Office, February 16, 1885.
Her Majesty’s Government have attentively considered your Excellency’s note of
the 28th ultimo, enclosing a German translation of the Agreement signed on the 10th
November last between the Imperial Representative in Samoa and the Government of
that country.
Before discussing the same permit me to remind your Excellency that I informed you
on the 3rd instant that Mr. Thurston, the Colonial Secretary of Fiji, had been selected
to act as the British Commissioner for the enquiry into British and German interests in
the Pacific.
I stated at the same time that as far as Her Majesty’s Government were concerned,
the Commissioners might meet as soon as possible, but that on the other hand if the
German Government preferred that the general question should first be negotiated
directly between the two countries, Her Majesty’s Government had no objection to such
a course. I should be glad to receive an early intimation of the wishes of your Govern-
ment upon this point.
I will now proceed to offer a few remarks in reply to your Excellency’s communica-
tion of the 28th ultimo.
Your Excellency expresses the hope of your Government that an examination of the
terms of the recent Agreement between Germany and Samoa will convince Her Majesty’s
Government that the points agreed upon are within the limits of the German Treaty
with Samoa of January 24th, 1879, and encroach neither on the independence of this
group of islands, nor on the rights acquired there by other nations.
If, M. I’Ambassadeur, this Agreement had been confined to the establishment of a Court,
and of the procedure to be observed in civil and criminal cases, and the punishment of
offences in which German subjects are concerned, for which alone Article YII. of the
German Treaty in 1879 provides, its provisions would not in the opinion of Her Majesty’s
Government have been open to criticism, but the creation of a State Council, the appoint-
ment of a German officer of the Samoan Government, and the enrolment of a German
police to protect the plantations of German subjects, appear to place Her Majesty’s
subjects at a disadvantage, and will prevent the Samoan Government from acting inde-
pendently in matters which affect the whole community. The arrangement seems in fact
to give to Germany alone much of the influence with which in 1880 it was proposed to
invest an Executive Council, to be composed of one English, one German, and one United
States member. To this arrangement Her Majesty’s Government declined to accede on
the ground that-it involved too great an interference with the Government of the Island
to allow of its being assumed by the Representatives of Great Britain, Germany, and the
United States conjointly.
It will not be possible for Her Majesty’s Government to accept a position of less
influence and consideration than is given to Germany by the agreement under discussion.
If, therefore, it should be ratified by the Imperial Government in all its essential points,
it may become necessary for Her Majesty’s Government to call upon the Samoan
Government to enter into a precisely similar agreement for the benefit of British subjects,
in order to secure the most favoured nation treatment guaranteed to this country by
Article 11. of the British Treaty with Samoa of August 29, 1879-
Your Excellency has further been instructed to revert to the petitions which have been
addressed by the King and Chiefs of Samoa to Her Majesty the Queen, and to the
Governor and Ministers of the Colony of New Zealand praying for annexation to Great
Britain, and you state that the text of these petitions confirms the suppositions that they
were drawn up by British subjects whose efforts in this direction have been encouraged
by the absence of any expression of disapproval of such conduct on the part of Her
Majesty’s Government.
I have no knowledge, M. I’Ambassadeur, of the circumstances attending the prepara-
tion of these petitions beyond the fact that they were forwarded to the Acting British
Consul at the time of the recent German negotiations with Samoa, and I have no reason
to suppose that there is any foundation for your Excellency’s complaints.
The feeling in Samoa in favour of English annexation appears to be spontaneous and
genuine, and there seems no more reason to suppose that it has been instigated by
Englishmen, than that it has been intensified by the recent action of the German Repre-
sentatives. 1 have so recently informed your Government of the conditions upon which
Her Majesty’s Government were prepared to respect the independence of both Samoa
u 150(U. Y


and Tonga that I need hardly repeat my assurances on this subject. I beg, however, to
take this opportunity of expressing the gratification with which I had learnt from Her
Majesty’s Ambassador at Berlin, and from your Excellency that your Government had
promptly repudiated the action of their Consul at Apia in hoisting the German flag over
some laud there.
It is unavoidable that in places far distant from Europe the action not only of British
and German individuals, but even of official servants of each State may be such as,
unchecked, might lead to unnecessary complications.
Immediate enquiry and consequent action on the part of the respective Governments,
such as the German Government have now adopted, and which Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment are ready to adopt, on all similar occasions are the best antidotes against this risk.

Your Majesty, Mulinu, December 29, 1884.
I am writing to Your Majesty to make known my distress on account of
difficulties which are being caused to me and my Government by gentlemen of your
Government who are resident in Samoa.
I humble myself and beg and entreat Your Majesty to listen to my complaint.
' The first thing concerning which I wish to make known my complaint to Your Majesty
is this.
The agreement made on the 10th November between the Government of Germany
and the Government of Samoa.
The means by which that agreement was procured were unjust; for we did not want
it and we were not permitted to deliberate and consider well concerning it.
I wrote to the German Consul to give me a copy of that agreement in order that we
might understand clearly the words in the agreement. But he was unwilling to give me


a copy of that agreement iu order that we might understand clearly the words in the
agreement. But he did not reply, as he was unwilling to give me and my Government
a copy unless we should first accept it, after which he would deliver up a copy to me
and my Government. But the reason for my accepting it and for writing our names,
Mahetoa and Tupua, was on account of our fear through our being continually
threatened,
I make known this to Your Majesty in order that our withdrawal from the agreement
may be known on account of its containing many impracticable clauses.
Therefore I beseech Your Majesty not to assent to that agreement.
There is another matter concerning -which I complain to Your Majesty. It is in
reference to difficulties which are being caused at the present time by a subject of your
Government, M. Weber. He is continually endeavouring to produce divisions which
will bring about wars and quarrels in Samoa. I have many accounts of his acts which
he is doing at the present time in order to cause difficulties in Samoa. He is scheming
with certain Samoan Chiefs and keeps giving them money, in order that they may obey
his will, and bring insurrections against my Government. I complain to Your Majesty
on account of the wrong things done by M. Weber in order that you may check that
gentlemen and prevent him from continuing to cause matters to arise which will lead to
the shedding of the blood of men of my Government.
I trust that Your Majesty and your Government may prosper.
I am,

With reference to your letter of the second instant,* covering copies of Count
Munster’s Notes of the 28th of January, I am directed by the Earl of Derby to state
that his Lordship has deferred noticing the Ambassador’s observations respecting the
d’Entrecasteaux Islands until he was able to transmit to Earl Granville printed copies of
the enclosed Despatch from Lord A. Loftus, dated 17th December last,f which is now
in type for presentation to Parliament.
Lord Derby would suggest that it might be explained to Count Munster that Her
Majesty’s Government in deciding to include the d’Entrecasteaux Islands in the New
Guinea Protectorate did not consider that they were precluded from so doing by reason
of the Notes of the 9th of August and 9th of October; for these islands, which his
Excellency by some misapprehension speaks of as “ lying off the North Coast ” of New
Guinea, are at the south end of the Island contiguous to East Cape and Goschen Straits,
and from their position specially interest the Australian Colonies.
It might also be intimated that Her Majesty’s Government having accordingly decided
to include this group of Islands in the Protectorate, it was thought that this step might
be most conveniently effected by inserting them in the schedule to the original proclama-
tion which had not then appeared in the official gazettes of the Australian Colonies,
though it was on the point of being published ,* and by hoisting the flag in the group,
and by promulgating the amended schedule there, and at places in the Protectorate
where the Proclamation had been previously made. These measures have accordingly
been carried out, and I am to point out that they were actually iu progress before Her
Majesty’s Government were aware that the German Government intended to hoist their
