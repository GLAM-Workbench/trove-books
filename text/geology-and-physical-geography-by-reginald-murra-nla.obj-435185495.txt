PREFACE.
The want of a Manual of Victorian Geology has been frequently
expressed ; and though able writers have dealt with the subject,
some of their works have not been so prominently placed before
the public as their merits entitled them to be, while others are out
of print, and copies remain in the hands only of a few.
An essay on mining in the colony of Victoria was prepared and
published by Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn, then Government Geologist,
in connexion with the catalogue of the Victorian Exhibition in
1861.
In connexion with the Intercolonial Exhibition of 1866, a
pamphlet was published, entitled “Mining and Mineral Statistics,”
by Mr. R. Brough Smyth, then Secretary for Mines.
An excellent work on the physical geography, geology, and
mineralogy of Victoria, by Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn and Mr. (now
Professor) George F. Ulrich, was also issued in 1866.
In 1869, a large volume, entitled “ The Gold-fields and Mineral
Districts of Victoria,” was compiled by Mr. R. Brough Smyth,
who subsequently published a pamphlet styled “ Mining and
Mineral Statistics, with Notes on the Rock-Formations of Vic-
toria,” in connexion with a Geological Sketch-map of the colony,
prepared for the Victorian Exhibition of 1872 and the Inter-
national Exhibition of 1873.
A descriptive catalogue of the rock and mineral specimens
in the Industrial and Technological Museum, Melbourne, was
prepared, under the direction of Mr. J. Cosmo Newbery, Superin-
tendent, by Mr. George F. Ulrich in 1875, and embodied obser-
vations on the leading geological characteristics of Victoria.
From 1856 to 1868, the Geological Survey of Victoria was in
regular progress, under the direction of Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn,
assisted by the late Messrs. C. D’Oyley Aplin and R. Daintree,


and by Messrs. George F, Ulrich, Norman Taylor, H. Y. L.
Brown, Robert Etheredge, jnn., Charles S. Wilkinson, and the
writer.
At the close of 1868, the Geological Survey Department was
abolished by the Government, but in 1871 Mr. R, Brough Smyth,
then Secretary for Mines, obtained authority for the partial re-
sumption of the work, which was continued—first under his
direction, and subsequently under that of Mr. T. Couchman, his
successor —by three geological surveyors, Mr. Norman Taylor,
Mr. Ferdinand M. Krause, and myself, until the beginning of
1878, when all three were dispensed with.
As the only field geologist subsequently reinstated, and now in
the service of the Victorian Government, upon me devolves the
duty of preparing an essay showing the progress made up to date
in acquiring a knowledge of the geology of the colony. The
work is a digest of the principal information noted in the pub-
lications above mentioned, in the subsequently-issued geological
progress reports of the Mining Department, and in the works of
Professor McCoy, Mr. A. W. Howitt, and others.
The small amount contributed from original personal observa-
tion gives me no claim to appear otherwise than as a compiler,
and I undertake the task fully conscious that a life passed from
boyhood principally in the forests and ranges within the narrow
limits of Victoria has not been favorable to the acquirement of a
scientific education sufficiently advanced to enable me to furnish
an essay that will bear comparison with those of more gifted
authors, who have enjoyed the advantages of regular scientific
tuition and more extended field experience. If, however, there is
no geological fact mentioned in this work that has not been
already noticed by others, there are few that have not been
verified by personal observation.
The leading characteristics of Victorian geology were ascer-
tained by Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn, and a large area was geologically
surveyed in detail under his supervision. As regards general out-
lines, little can be added to the information collected by him,
though in matters of detail some corrections and amendments have


been made both with respect to the Geological Sketch-maps, and
the conclusions arrived at as to the position of some rock-forma-
tions which he had not the opportunity to fully investigate.
Irrespective of these matters of detail, to Mr. Selwyn and his
principal colleagues is due the credit of having first demonstrated
the leading facts of Victorian geology, and of having arrived at
general conclusions, which the results of subsequent inquiry have
in most cases tended to substantiate.
The latest Geological Sketch-map of Victoria, prepared under
the direction of Major Couchman, late Secretary for Mines, is—
with the addition of being geologically coloured—the topographical
map issued from the Crown Lauds Department, under the super-
vision of Mr. A. J. Skene, late Surveyor-General.
A few modifications and improvements, as regards detail on
previous sketch-maps, have been effected, but owing to the prac-
tical cessation since 1877 of geological survey on an organized basis,
and the limited time at my disposal for the work of revision in
the field, the improvement is not so marked as it might have been.
The map will, however, be found to contain valuable scientific
information, and, if studied in connexion with the various detailed
maps, drawings, and writings extant on Victorian geology, cannot
fail to prove of interest to scientific men and students of geology.
Mr. A. J. Skene’s map of Australia and Tasmania, geologically
coloured by Mr. A. Everett, chief draughtsman of the Mining
Department, has been prepared under the direction of the Secre-
tary for Mines from the most authentic data obtainable.
It will be found to be a most useful adjunct to the study of the
Victorian map, and will illustrate the remarks as to the physical
geography and geology of this colony as related to the rest of
Australia which will be met with in this essay.
Sixty-five geological quarter-sheets, each representing, on a
scale of 2 inches to 1 mile, an area of 54 square miles, were
prepared from minutely-detailed surveys under the directions
of Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn.
Similarly prepared maps of the principal gold-fields, namely,
Stawell, Ararat, Clunes and Talbot, Ballarat, Creswick, and


Sandhurst, with sketch-maps of a considerable area in Gippsland,
have been published under the directions of Mr. R. Brough
Smyth and Major Couchman, late Secretaries for Mines, and of
Mr. Charles W. Langtree, who now holds that office.
Seven Progress Reports have also been issued, embodying the
individual reports of the geological surveyors, with papers by other
contributors, and illustrative plans, sections, and drawings. Eight
decades, illustrating the palseontology of Victoria, have been pre-
pared and published under the direction of Professor McCoy; and
nineteen plates, with accompanying descriptions, of the fossil-fruits
found in the Tertiary gold-drifts, have been issued by Baron F.
von Mueller, Government Botanist.


CHAPTER I.
Physical Geography.
The Cordillera and its Spurs. Boundaries of Victoria.
Mountain Systems. River Systems. Drainage Areas.
A Cordillera, or mountain chain, conforming approximately in
direction to the eastern and south-eastern coast lines of Australia,
extends from Cape York, the extreme northern point of the
island-continent, through Queensland and New South Wales into
Victoria, which latter territory may be described as comprising the
south-eastern portion of Australia, and including—under existing
orographical conditions —the southern terminal spurs of the
Cordillera.
The boundaries of Victoria are —on the west, the 141st meridian;
on the south and south-west, the sea-coast from the 141st meri-
dian to Cape Howe ; on the north-east, a line from Cape Howe
to Forest Hill, a lofty point of the Cordillera which there passes
into Victoria; and on the north, the Murray River, from its source
near Forest Hill to the 141st meridian. The total area of the
colony is computed at 87,884 square miles, the extreme length
east and west being about 420 miles, and the greatest breadth
north and south 250 miles.
From Forest Hill the Cordillera trends south-westerly to a
point near St. Clair, between the head waters of three of the
principal rivers of Victoria, namely, the Yarra, falling into Port,
Phillip; the Goulburn, Joining the Murray; and the Thomson,
running into the La Trobe River, a few miles above where the
latter enters the Gippsland Lakes. From St. Clair, a great spur
of the Cordillera extends through the colony, in a general direction
slightly north of west to the Glenelg River, near the South Aus-
tralian border, where the range slopes down to the low-lying and
nearly level country, of which the western margin of Victoria from
the sea to the Murray principally consists. The Grampians,
which include the Sierra, the Victoria, the Duudas, and the Black
Ranges, constitute the terminal western points of this mountain
chain.
Another spur, which will for the sake of distinction be here
termed the Southern Spur, branches from the Cordillera at
St. Clair, and extends southerly, but in a very zig-zag manner, to
Wilson’s Promontory, the extreme southern point of Australia.
This spur is not so conspicuous a mountain chain as the western
range, but is of geographical importance, being really a portion
of the water-shed line extending from the extreme northern to the
extreme southern point of Australia.


The question as to which of these two spurs represents the
extension of the Cordillera will be discussed after the rock-
formations have been described, and data thereby given for the
opinion advanced.
The portion of the Cordillera from Forest Hill to St. Clair, and
the great range extending westward from St. Clair to the
Grampians, together constitute geographically, and will be here
referred to as, the “ Main Diride ”of Victoria, forming the water-
shed line between the Murray River system on the north, and the
numerous streams debouching on the southern coast between the
Snowy River and the Glenelg,
The loftiest summit of the Australian Cordillera is Mount
Kosciusko, 7,300 feet above sea-level, situated in New South
Wales, about 24 miles northward from Forest Hill. In Victoria,
tire highest points of the Main Divide are between Forest Hill and
St. Clair, the names and heights of the principal ones being as
follows:—Forest Hill, (about) 5,000 feet; Mount Cobberas, 6,025
feet; Mount Tambo, 4,700 feet; Mount Hotham, 6,100 feet ; The
Twins, 5,575 feet; Mount Howitt, 5,715 feet; Connor’s Plain,
5,500 feet ; Fullarton’s Spring-hill, 5,400 feet ; and Mount Mat-
lock, 4,561 feet.
Mount Bogong, 6,508 feet, and Mount Feathertop, 6,303 feet,
the highest mountains in Victoria, are peaks on northern spurs
from the Main Divide, the former between the Kiewa and the
Mitta Mitta, the latter between the Kiewa and the Ovens Rivers.
Westward from St. Clair to Mount Strickland, the Divide
maintains an average elevation of not less than 4,000 feet; but
from Mount Strickland to the Grampians none of the highest
peaks attain that altitude.
Mount Disappointment, 2,631 feet; Mount Macedon, 3,324 feet-
Mount Buangor, 3,247 feet ; Lar-ne-Gerin, 3,123 feet ; Mount
Ararat, 2,020 feet; and Mount M illiam, in the Grampians, 3,827
feet, above sea-level, are the highest elevations westward from the
meridian of Melbourne. The average height of the Main Divide
may be approximately stated at about 3,000 feet, some of the
lowest saddles being as low as 1,000 feet above sea-level. The
Main Divide has a general bearing of a few degrees south of west
taking a direct line from I orest Hill on the north-eastern boun-
dary line to Mount William, the highest peak of the Grampians,
m the western portion of the colony. The average distance of
the Mam Divide from the ocean coast is approximately 70 miles
or about the distance which the two mountains above referred to
(forest Hill and Mount William) are from the mouths of the
bnowy and Hopkins Rivers respectively, so that a line between
the two latter points is nearly parallel with one between the two
mountains.


In its principal deviations, the course of the Main Divide con-
forms noticeably to the configuration of the coast line ; the south-
ernmost point of the former is where the Cordillera bifurcates at
St. Clair, and is directly north of Wilson’s Promontory, the south-
ernmost point on the coast line. The Divide recedes northward
conformably to the indentation of Port Phillip, turns again
slightly south-westward, and then deflects north-westward, coin-
ciding in general direction with the coast line from Cape Otway
to Portland. Of the spurs branching from the Main Divide on
the north only those eastward from the Ovens River extend as
far north as the Murray ; the spurs westward from the Ovens
terminate on level country many miles back from the Murray.
That portion of the Murray River drainage-area which is con-
tained within Victoria lies to the north of the Main Divide, and
comprises more than half of the entire area of the colony.
The principal Victorian tributaries of the Murray are the Mitta
Mitta, the Kiewa, the Ovens, the Broken River, the Goulburn,
the Campaspe, and the Loddon, all of which rise in the Main
Divide, and are fed by numerous tributaries. Westward from the
Loddon are the Avoca, the Wimmera, and several smaller rivers
and creeks which run only during wet seasons, and whose waters
rarely reach the Murray, being received and retained in lakes and
swamps, the overflow from which is absorbed by the porous soil
of the low-lying tract extending from the Avoca to the western
boundary of the colony.
On the southern slopes of the Main Divide, the leading spurs
separating the principal drainage-areas lying between Cape Howe
and Port Phillip, extend down to, or to within a short distance
of, the sea ; but, to the westward of Port Phillip, a wide extent
of low-lying and level or slightly-undulating country intervenes
between the foot-hills of the Main Divide and the coast line. An
isolated mountainous tract, known as the Cape Otway Ranges,
totally unconnected by any conspicuous leading range with the
Main Divide, lies to the south of a line from Geelong to Warr-
nambool. The highest point in these ranges is Mount Sabine,
1,800 feet above the sea, and from the Mount Sabine Range
numerous spurs descend to the coast, where they terminate in
cliffs and bold headlands.
The Southern Spur, after leaving the Cordillera at St. Clair,
trends southward for some miles to Mount Baw Baw, where it
attains an elevation of about 5,000 feet; it then turns westerly as
far as the head of the La Trobe River, whence it makes a south-
easterly deflection, and descends to a level not 500 feet above the
sea in the neighbourhood of Drouin, where it fonns a low water-
shed between the valleys of Gippsland and Western Port, from
here the Southern Spur rises again, and forms the Strzlecki
Range, over 2,000 feet above the sea.


As the Strzlecki Range, and further south-east as the Hoddle
Range, it forms the main water-shed of the South Gippsland and
Western Port Ranges, and with its numerous offshoots constitutes,,
within an area lying to the south of a direct line from Western
Port to the Gippsland Lakes, a mountainous tract whose only-
connexion with the Main Divide is the low ridge near Drouin,
above referred to.
From the Hoddle Range one spur descends to the sea at Cape
Liptrap, while another slopes down to a low narrow isthmus
lying between Corner Inlet on the east and Shallow Inlet en-
tire west. South from this isthmus rises a rugged mountainous
tract, consisting wholly of granite, of which the highest peak.
Mount La Trobe, is 2,400 feet above the sea, and the terminal point
is Wilson’s Promontory, the southernmost extremity of Australia.
The Southern Spur separates the country lying to the south of
the Main Divide into two great divisions, each of which contains
a number of distinct drainage-areas. In the eastern division,
which comprises nearly the whole of Gippsland, there are several
independent streams, draining considerable areas between Cape
Howe and the Snowy River. The Snowy River has its sources
in New South Wales, but a large extent of its drainage-area lies
in Gippsland; its western water-shed line is a range starting from
near Mount Tambo, on the Main Divide, and extending to the
low country west of the river mouth.
Between the Snowy River and the outlet of the Gippsland*
Lakes is a small drainage-area, the waters of which pass to the
sea through Lake Tyers. From that portion of the Main Divide,
extending between Mount Tambo and St. Clair, and from the
Southern Spur between St. Clair and the Hoddle Range, rise a
number of rivers which irrigate the richest portions of Gippsland,
and finally mingle their waters in the Gippsland Lakes, whence
they reach the sea by a common outlet. The principal of these
rivers are the La Trobe or Glengarry—the Morwell, Narracan, and
Moe joining the La Trobe from the south and west; the Tanjil,
the Tyers, the Thomson, and the Macalister, affluents of the La
Trobe, from the north; the Avon, the Mitchell or
the Nicholson, and the Tambo. Between the Gippsland Lakes and
Wilson’s Promontory a number of minor streams empty themselves
on the coast or into the various inlets. The Albert and the Tarra
running into Port Albert, and the Agnes running into Corner Inlet,
head from a range which forms the divide between their waters
and those of the Morwell, and is an eastern offshoot from the
Hoddle Range. The Franklin, the Bennison, and Stockyard Creek
head from the Hoddle-Range, and flow into Corner Inlet.
In the main western division, that lying to the south of the
Main Divide and to the west of the Southern Spur, are a number
of distinct drainage-areas. Anderson’s Inlet, between Cape Liptrap


and Cape Patterson, receives the River Tarwin, of which the
eastern branches head from the Hoddle Range, and the northern
from the Strzlecki Range, both portions of the Southern Spur.
The Powlett River, entering the sea between Cape Patterson
and Western Port, heads from a western offshoot of the Strziecki
Range, which extends down to Griffiths Point, and forms the
southern water-shed line of the streams falling into Western Port
Bay. In the drainage-area of Western Port Bay, the principal
streams are the Bass and the Lang Lang, rising in the Strzlecki
Range, and the Tarago, formerly Tarween, with its affluent the
Buneep, heading from a range which branches south-westerly
from the Southern Spur, and forms the divide between Western
Port and Port Phillip. For several miles the Tarago skirts the
western slope of the Southern Spur at Neerim, and on leaving it
receives Brandy Greek, heading from the low “ saddle ” of the
Southern Spur near Drouin. From another portion of this
“ saddle ” small streams flow westward into the Lang Lang.
All waters eastward of the “ saddle ” flow into the Moe, and
belong to the Gippsland drainage system.
The Port Phillip Bay drainage-area is a very extensive one. Its
principal river is the Yarra, whose extreme sources are near the
bifurcation of the Cordillera at St. Clair. The main northern
tributaries of the Yarra—the Saltwater or Maribyrnong River,
the Plenty, and the Watts —rise in the Main Divide; while of the
southern affluents some head from the Southern Spur, and others
from the branch range therefrom which divides the waters of
Western Port from those of Port Phillip. From this range, por-
tion of which is known as the Dandenong Range, several minor
creeks descend to the eastern shore of Port Phillip. The Werribee
rises in the Main Divide, and enters Port Phillip midway between
Melbourne and Geelong. The Barwon River enters the sea
through Lake Connewarre, a little to the west of Port Phillip
Heads, and takes its rise at Mount Sabine, the culminating point
of the Otway Ranges. The Leigh or Yarrowee and the Moora-
bool, both northern affluents of the Barwon, have their sources in
the Main Divide.
In the Cape Otway Ranges, a number of creeks and rivers head
from the Mount Sabine Range. The principal of these are —the
Barrum, running into the sea immediately west of Apollo Bay;
the Aire, 5 miles north-west from Cape Otway; and the Gelli-
brand, which heads from Mount Sabine, and, draining the northern
portion of the ranges, joins the sea a few miles north-west from
Moonlight Head.
Curdie’s River intersects the low-lying western portion of the
Cape Otway district, and its mouth is about midway between
the Gellibrand and Warrnambool. The Hopkins, which drains a
wide area, has its outlet at Warrnambool, and its sources in a


considerable length of the Main Divide, extending from north of
Ballarat to the Grampians. The Gleuelg River, rising in and
skirting the northern slopes, flows round the western extremity
of the Grampians, and after being joined by the Wannon, which
receives their southern drainage, enters the sea at the 141st
meridian, or western boundary line of the colony. Several unim-
portant streams empty themselves at various points along the
coast, between the mouths of the Glenelg and the Hopkins.
North of the Cape Otway Ranges, and between the water-sheds
of Curdie’s River, the Gellibrand, the Hopkins, and the Leigh
Rivers, is a district containing numerous lakes, salt and fresh, °
The largest of these, and also the most extensive in Victoria,
is Lake Korangamite, a salt lake situated in a large central depres-
sion, about 350 feet above sea-level. Lake Korangamite receives
the drainage of nearly 1,200 square miles, but has no outlet save
by evaporation. It has been remarked of the lakes in this district
that those with no outlets are salt, while those having outlets are
fresh. Ihe explanation is that in the former the salt brought by
rain-waters from the soil of the surrounding country has no means
of escape, while in the latter it is carried away in solution, and thus
does not collect in sufficient quantity to affect the taste of the water
Many of these lakes are the craters of now extinct volcanoes.
Briefly recapitulating, we have, as the leading mountain features
of Victoria: Ist. The Main Divide, and its branch systems of
ranges. 2nd. The South Gippsland and Western Port Ranges, of
which portion of the Southern Spur constitutes the leading rid’o-e,
and which are only slightly connected with the Main Divide by
means of the low “ saddle ” to which the Southern Spur descends,
near Drouin. 3rd. The Cape Otway Ranges, totally unconnected
by any leading ridge with the Main Divide, and occupying a great
southern projection of the laud westward of the meridian of
Phillip, as the South Gippsland and Western Port Ranges occupy
a similar projection eastward thereof. As the principal groups of
drainage systems Ave have—lst, that of the Murray, north of the
Main Divide ; 2nd, the South-eastern or Gippsland systems, south
of the Mam Divide, and east of the Southern Spur ; 3rd, the
oouth-western systems, or those south of the Main Divide and
west of the Southern Spur.
The foregoing description of the principal mountain and river
systems has been given somewhat minutely, as I wish hereafter to
snow now the present physical structure of Victoria is due to a
complication of causes, in the form of geological changes, which
have been incessantly at work since the remotest epochs. An
attempt will also be made to indicate the comparative relations of
the sea and land surfaces, and the positions and courses of the
principal drainage channels, during various eras in the geological
history of this country. 5


CHAPTER 11.
List of Geological Formations. Relations of Main
Geological and Geographical Features.
The table of colours and explanations on the Geological Sketch-
map of Victoria (8 miles to 1 inch) shows four principal groups,
comprising in all thirteen distinct formations, known to exist in the
colony, and proved in most cases by palaeontological evidence to be
the equivalents, as regards geological position, of well-explored
analogous formations in Europe and other parts of the world.
On the detailed geological maps are shown several subdivisions
—into Alluvial, Post-Pliocene, Ncavct Pliocene, and Older Plio-
cene —of the deposits indicated on the sketch-map by one colour,
under the general heading of Post-Tertiary and Upper Tertiary.
The results of further investigation will, no doubt, justify sub-
divisions of the Mesozoic and Paleozoic groups.
Subjoined is a table of the principal groups and divisions of
Victorian geology, as shown on the Geological Sketch-map above
referred to, and the names of the colours used to distinguish
them:—

Victoria presents no striking geological features of which
counterparts cannot be found in other parts of the world. Of the
formations given in the above list, some, as before stated, can
with certainty be regarded, on palaeontological evidence, as
equivalents of well-known European strata ; in the case of others,
the evidence as to their precise position is meagre, but no doubt
exists as to the accuracy of their general classification. Repre-
sentatives of many of the subdivisions of European geology are
wanting, or occupy very small areas, in Victoria, though, as
regards some of them, Mr. Selwyn has pointed out that they may
at one time have existed, but have been removed by the action of
denudation.
Generally described, with reference to the physical configura-
tion, Victorian geology presents the following main features :
Ist. The Main Divide and its accessory systems of ranges north
and south, constituting a great central longitudinal area of Lower
Palmozoic rocks, through which protrude masses of granite and
trappean rocks, and on which are overlying or flanking deposits
of Upper Palceozoic, Mesozoic, and Tertiary ages. 2nd. The two
great southern projections of Victoria, comprising the Western
Port and South Gippsland Ranges on the east, and the Cape
Otway Ranges on the west, of Port Phillip ; also an area in the
western district, south of the main road from Hamilton to
Casterton, including a large portion of the drainage-area of the
Wannon, and extending westward to the Glenelg River.
In all these areas the prevailing rock-formation is of Mesozoic
age, though more or less overlaid by Tertiary sedimentary and
volcanic layers. W ilson’s Promontory, however, the extreme
southern portion of the South Gippsland Ranges, consists entirely
of granite ; and from near Anderson's Inlet to the head of Corner
Inlet the Silurian rocks bound the Mesozoic area on the south. A
protrusion of the Silurian through the Mesozoic rocks occurs at
Turton’s Creek, some 10 miles north from Corner Inlet. A small
area of Mesozoic rocks occurs near Bacchus Marsh. The total
extent of country in which the Victorian rocks of this series prevail
near the surface is about 4,000 square miles, but an additional
area of nearly equal extent is probably concealed by overlying
lertiary deposits. 3rd. The low-lying or slightly-undulating
tracks, consisting of sedimentary deposits of Tertiary and Post-
Tertiary ages. Of these, the principal are :—The level country
lying southward of the Murray River, from Wahgunyah to the
western boundary of the colony, including the Wimmera district,
and extending thence southward to the mouth of the Glenelg;
tracts bordering the sea-coast, and extending for various distances
inland, from the Glenelg to the Gellibrand ; from Loutit Bay
to Port Phillip ; from between St. Kilda and Fraukston across
to Western Port ; from the Powlett River to Anderson’s Inlet


(here however, the recent deposits rest very thinly on Mesozoic
rocks) ; from Corner Inlet to the Gippsland Lakes ; the country
bordering the latter on the north, and that extending eastward
along the coast nearly to Cape Howe. 4th. The areas on which
the Newer and the Older Tertiary volcanic rocks form the preva-
lent surface formation. Of the Newer Volcanic areas the principal
is that lying westward of the meridian of Melbourne, bounded on
the south partly by the Port Phillip coast and partly by the
sedimentary Tertiary and Mesozoic areas lying southward of a line
from Geelong to Portland; on the west, by a line from Portland
to the Wannon; and on the north by the Palaeozoic rocks of the
spurs from the Main Divide. Between some of its leading spurs,
strips of volcanic rock extend up to, and in some places over, the
Main Divide, thus connecting the great volcanic areas lying to
the south with those of lesser extent on the slopes towards the
Murray.
Older Volcanic rocks of the Middle Tertiary period constitute
the surface formation of various small areas in the Geelong district,
around Melbourne, near Bacchus Marsh, Ballan, and between
Lethbridge and Steiglitz ; but they are more extensively developed
in, or on either side of, the low-lying country which extends
between Western Port and the La Trobe valley in Gippsland, and
they also constitute the elevated plateaux known as the Dargo
and Bogong High Plains. The low ridge near Drouin, previously
described as forming the connexion between the mountain systems
of the Main Divide and the South Gippsland Ranges, consists of
decomposed Older Volcanic rock.
Throughout the colony, Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic
cappings and outliers overlie the Mesozoic and Palaeozoic rocks
up to elevations of nearly 6,000 feet above sea-level. Tertiary
deposits of marine origin are, however, only found below an
altitude of 1,000 feet above the sea; any Tertiary deposits above
that level show evidence of being due to fluviatile or lacustrine
agencies, at any rate so far as the existing arrangement of their
materials is concerned.
Having so far given a general description of the main geological
features, as related to the physical geography of Victoria, the for-
mations themselves will now be described in ascending sequence,
so as to portray, if possible, the natural operations and changes
that have taken place from Palaeozoic times to the present.

Granitic Areas. Mineralogical Characters—Stratigraphi-

Localities.
Granite occurs in protruding masses forming isolated areas of
varying extent throughout the colony.
To quote from Mr. Selwyn’s work: —“ It does not occur along
any defined axis or line, nor has it any physical connexion with
the main geographical axis of the country, hut forms isolated
groups of hills, such as Station Peak, Mount Eliza, Arthur’s Seat,
Wilson’s Promontory, &c., on the south, and Mount Alexander,
Mount Tarrangower, the Terricks, Mount Korong, Mount Beck-
worth, and others on the north.
Some of these —as Station Peak, the Granite Range of the
Anakies, the Terricks, some points on the Avoca Plains, and a
solitary outcrop west of the Glenelg River —are entirely surrounded
by level Tertiary or Volcanic country, and are not connected hy
any surface ridge with the main mountain system.
On the Main Divide itself, a portion west of Ararat, Lar-ne-
Gerin, Mount Buaugor, a portion north of Lancefield, Mount
Disappointment, Mount St. Leonard to Mount Arnold, and east-
ward of Mount Leinster, between Mounts Tambo and Cobberas,
are the only instances where granite constitutes the crest of the
Main Divide, and the greatest lengths of these granitic areas are
usually across, instead of along, the axis of the range. In most
cases, the granite outcrops constitute portions of the minor systems
of ranges formed by the leading northern and southern spurs from
the Main Divide, Of the two largest areas of granite, one is
that which extends between Reedy Creek and the King River,
and includes the Strathbogie Ranges; the other is that consisting
partly of granite and partly of rocks classed on the Geological
Sketch-map as Trappean, which extends from the Main Divide,
between Mount St. Leonard and Mount Arnold to the Goulhurn
on one side, and on the other to the Yarra, where it is connected
by a narrow belt with another large granitic area extending along
the Southern Spur from Mount Baw Baw to the head of the
La Trobe, and thence to near Dandenong.
Besides those already mentioned, the following are the principal
tracts where granite occurs as the surface rock :—An area sur-
rounded by metamorphic rocks between the Wannon and the
Glenelg, and several localities in the Grampians ; Yowen Hill,
Mounts Go war, Kerang, Egbert, and Mclntyre’s Ranges, near
Kingower ; between Ararat and Stawell; small outcrops near St.


Arnaud; Mount Bolton ; from Elphinstone, through Ravenswood,
to Tarrangower ; eastward of Ballarat ; Butter’s Ranges, near
Wangaratta ; Eldorado to Beechworth ; Mjrtleford to Yackan-
dandah ; Murray River, eastward of Mitta Mitta River ; the
Buffalo Ranges ; The Brothers, near Lake Oraeo ; Tambo River;
Swift’s Creek ; Dargo and Mitchell Rivers ; Snowy River, Mount
Ellery, Genoa River, Ram Head, Howe Hill, Gabo Island, Tam-
boon Inlet, Point Everard, the Bogong Mountains, and a small
outcrop in the head of a branch of the Avon, in Gippsland ;
besides a number of minor occurrences, which will be found
indicated upon the Geological Sketch-map.
Physical Character and Vegetation op Granitic Areas.
The physical aspect presented by the granitic areas is usually
of a rugged character, except where, in the less elevated tracts, the
outlines have been softened by denuding influences. In the higher
mountains, the weathering of the softer portions of the granite has
left, jutting from the soil, immense bare portions of the harder rock,
upon which great egg-shaped masses frequently rest on end, and
appear as though a touch would overturn them. (Figs. 1 and 2.)
The Wilson’s Promontory mountains abound in such “ tors,”
which are generally characteristic of granite country in this and
other parts of the world.
The granitic areas in Victoria, as a rule, are covered with an
inferior soil for either agricultural or pastoral purposes, and
support only small or medium-sized timber; but in some localities,
where the conditions are favorable and the climate humid, they
sustain a gigantic forest growth, with an almost impenetrable
scrub of smaller vegetation.
Fig. 1. —Granite Tor, Sheep Station Creek, Beechworth.


Fig. 2.— Granite Rocks near the Anakies.
In the valley of the Watts River, and on the southern slopes of
Mount Baw Baw, grow some of the loftiest trees (Eucalypts) in
the world, surrounded by a dense growth of hazel ( Fomaderris
apetala), musk (Aster argophyllus), dogwood ( Senecio Bed-
fordii), sassafras ( Atherosperma moschatum ), various pittospo-
mms, and numerous other shrubs and tree-ferns of several species.
The native beech ( Fagus Cunninghami ), one of the most beauti-
ful of our forest trees, attains its greatest perfection in these
localities.
Mineralogical Characters.
The typical granite of Victoria is the normal coarse to fine
crystalline-granular ternary compound of quartz, felspar, and mica,
which constitutes the typical granite of other parts of the world.
Nearly all other known varieties are also met with —as binary
granite , composed of quartz and felspar; griesen, composed of
quartz and mica, and devoid of, or very poor in, felspar ; syenite
granite, porphyritic granite, &c. The felspar varies in colour
from white to deep pink; the quartz is vitreous, white or grey in
colour, and from nearly transparent to opaque; the mica is black,
yellow, or white, and the three minerals occur in variable propor-
tions. Black tourmaline (schorl) is frequently present as an
accessary mineral. In the granite of Wilson’s Promontory, Beech-
worth, Mount Alexander, &c., prisms of schorl occur, singly or
aggregated in radiating masses. Dykes of fine-grained schorl-
aceous granite, accompanying quartz veins, intersect the ordinary
granite in the first-named locality; and numerous other varieties,
in the form of dykes, traverse the main granite masses.


At Yanakie landing, on the western shore of Corner Inlet, the
granite contains small garnets, and from the granitic detritus in
the same locality zircon, topaz, green and blue sapphire, and a
small ruby were obtained by Mr. W. Miller, manager of Yanakie
Station, and examined by Professor Ulrich, who also enumerates,
among accessory minerals occurring in Victorian granite, tin ore ,
epidote, chlorite, fiuor spar, and amethyst, at Beechworth and
Chiltern ; columbite, at Maldon ; molybdenite, at Yackandandah,
Maldon, and Moliagul; iron-glance, at Mount Korong; and iron
pyrites, generally distributed. The granites of various localities,
as Harcourt, Gellibrand’s Hill, Gong Gong, near Ballarat, &c.,
afford good durable building stones, and are also valuable for
monumental purposes. A very beautiful syenite granite, composed
of red felspar, quartz, and hornblende, occurs at Gabo Island,
and has been used in the General Post Office, the Custom House,
and the Australasian Insurance Company’s office, in Melbourne,
The typical Older Plutonic granite and kindred rocks unques-
tionably occupy the lowest stratigraphical position, and constitute
here, as they probably do throughout the world, the prevailing
rock foundation. Their appearance at the surface is evidently due
to the removal, by denudation, of once superincumbent sedimentary
strata. Geologically, however, these older hypogene rocks are
younger than the Palaeozoic strata of Silurian age, but older
than those classed as Upper Palaeozoic. The grounds for this
opinion are, that whereas the Upper Palaeozoic rocks, where found
resting on the granite, are unaltered, and their granite foundation
appears to have been as we now see it at the time of their
deposition, the Lower Palaeozoic rocks are invariably more or
less metamorphosed near their contact with, and frequently
contain injected veins of, the granite, showing that since their
deposition the granite has been in a heated and plastic, or possibly
a molten, condition. (Fig. 3.)
Another marked feature is that the granite intrusions do not
appear to be connected with the folding process to which the
IG 3 Silurian rocks have been subjected,

locally-contorted and crumpled state of the Silurian strata near
their contact with the former.
According to the description given by Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn, of
the country east of the Snowy River, the summits of many of the
hills and ranges there consist of nearly vertical Silurian slates
Eight feet.

The granite is a felspathic ternary compound. The granite veins cut sharply across the
indurated Silurian strata. They are fine-grained at the sides, hut coarsely aggregated in
the centre, and with strings and patches of yellowish orthoclase. Two sets of vertical'
joints traverse the granite. Main joints E. to W. The indurated Silurian rocks are dense

and sandstones, resting on edge upon the granite which appears
at the base of the slopes. These facts indicate that the presence
of the granite cannot be immediately associated with any idea as
to the nature of the forces which caused the general tilting,
folding, and corrugation of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks; and also
that the granite, as we now see it, could not have been the
foundation on which those rocks were originally deposited.
The inferences are that after, or perhaps during, the plication,
by whatever causes, of the Silurian rocks, an access of heat
caused the fusion of their foundation at great depths below the
then surface ; that this fused and plastic mass invaded and partly
absorbed the lower edges of their folds ; that beyond the limits of
such actual transmutation of the sedimentary strata into portion of
the fused granitic mass, the former were metamorphosed by heat
and other agencies combined for a greater or less distance from
the igneous mass ; and that after this mass had cooled and con-
solidated into granite under great pressure, and a great depth below
the then surface, the action of denudation during subsequent
periods removed portion of the superincumbent strata, and laid
hare its more prominent projections. (Pigs. 4 and 5.)
Tig. s.— Section showing contact or Granite and Silurian.—Tail Race op

Much of our granite may, therefore (as indicated by Mr. Selwyn),
be regarded as completely transmuted Lower Palaeozoic strata ;
but as this subject will be further dealt with in describing the
metamorphic stratified rocks, the Plutonic igneous rocks allied to
granite, but of somewhat different mineral combinations, will first
be noticed.
Among the areas represented as “Trap” on the Geological
Sketch-map, the rocks in three, namely, those of Mount Macedon,
the Dandenong Ranges, and Mount Juliet, besides others of minor
extent, appear to be intimately associated Avith the ordinary
granites, though the true relations of the rocks have not yet been
properly investigated. In all three instances there seem to be no
clearly-defined lines of demarcation between the rocks classed as


“trap” and the adjacent granites, while in some places a gradual
passage from one to the other, as regards mineral composition, is
•observable, and the different forms appear to blend with one another
as though they were simply rocks of varying mineralogical struc-
ture belonging to the same general mass. The trappean area of
Mount Macedon, on the Main Divide, as shown upon the geological
map of the locality, is partly bounded on the east by granite, ap-
parently not presenting any abnormal mineralogical character,
judging from the notes upon the map, which indicate coarse and
fine-grained varieties, with large and small plates of mica, and,
occasionally, schorl. Between this granite and the “trap” only
an approximate boundary line is indicated. The rock of Mount
Macedon itself, and of several other places in the same area, is
described in the notes upon the map as “ dark-grey felspar trap,
granular, and not at all porphyritic.” Mount Diogenes, another
point on the Main Divide, north-eastward from Mount Macedon,
is described as a dome-shaped mass of rock of a porphyritic
character, i.e., containing disseminated isolated crystals. A speci-
men from here is described, in a catalogue published by Mr.
Selwyn in 1868, as consisting of a light-coloured granular base,
with black specks, probably hornblende, and enclosing crystals of
orthoclase felspar and quartz. A general note describes the “ trap”
of the northern portion of the area as displaying “a soft ash-
coloured earthy and amygdaloidal character, whilst that of the
southern (near the granite) is dark-grey, granular, and crystal-
line.” Other varieties of “felspar trap,” “felspar porphyry,” and
“ granitic porphyry,” are described in Mr. Selwyn’s catalogue as
having been obtained from the Mount Macedon Range, and from
neighbouring trappean areas. Specimens lately examined show a
mineralogical composition, justifying the application of the term
“syenite porphyry” to some of the Mount Macedon rocks.
The “trap” of the Dandenong Ranges is shown on the Geo-
logical Sketch-map as being bounded on the south by granite,
and on the other sides by Upper Silurian rocks. Specimens of
“ ternary granite ” and syenitic porphyry, from near Dandenong,
and of “ micaceous felspar trap,” “felspar porphyry,” and “syenitic
felspar porphyry/’ from the Dandenong Ranges, are described in
Mr. Selwyn’s catalogue.
The Upper Silurian rocks near Lillydale show considerable
metamorphism near their contact with the “ trap” in the northern
part of the Dandenong Range, indicating a heated condition of the
trappean mass subsequent to the deposition of the Silurian strata.
The great trappean area, of which Mount Juliet is the centre,
and which also includes portion of the Main Divide, between
Mount St. Leonard and Mount Arnold, is more or less bordered by
granite, which forms intervening belts between it and the Silurian
'rocks.


So far as tliis tract has been superficially examined, no arbitrary
line of demarcation between the granite and the trap can be laid
down. The general characters displayed by the latter are various,
but of some typical samples I am fortunately able to quote the
following descriptions, supplied by Mr. A. W. Howitt, F.G.S.,
who has made the microscopical investigation of rock-structure
one of his special studies, and who has kindly examined for me a
large number of igneous rock-specimens :
“ MASSIVE TRAP, NEAR HEALESYILLK.
“ Ground-mass, micro-crystalline, consisting of felspar and
quartz. In it are —(1) Crystals of quartz; (2) Orthoclase crystals.
No triclinic felspar observable, but a little mica (? muscovite),
which is quite subordinate. In composition, this is a quartz-
felsite.”
Another specimen of trap rock from the Watts River, near
Healesville : —“ This is a quartz porphyrite (hornblendic).”
No. 1 specimen, from north of Yarra River, opposite Warburton.
—“Ground-mass, micro-crystalline, of quartz and felspar and a
little magnetite. In it are—(l) Felspar, mostly plagioclase; (2)
Chlorite pseudomorphs after hornblende; (3) Masses of felsitic
ground-mass. This is a hornblende porphyrite. ”
No. 2, north of Yarra River, opposite Warburton. —“ This rock
is in character between a quartz porphyrite and a quartz felsite,
there being both orthoclase and plagioclase felspars.”
Two remarkable belts, resembling enormous dykes, are indicated
as trappean on the Geological Sketch-map. One forms the summit
of the Mount Staveley Range, south from the Grampians, between
Wickliffe and Dunkeld, and protrudes through Lower Silurian rocks-
Judging from a hand-specimen, the rock is a felspar porphyry,
but I have not had an opportunity of obtaining information from
personal observation as to the extent and character of the outcrop-
The second forms the ridge of the Mount Camel Range, 10
miles north from Heathcote, and the rock consists there of a dark,
dense, hornblendic greenstone diorite—hornblende rock. It is in
the same line of strike with a large dyke of fine granite which
passes through Heathcote.
Still further to the south, in the same direction, another long
outcrop of greenstone diorite forms a range to the east of Lance-
field. The entire belt, from Mount Camel to Lancefield, follows
approximately the apparent boundary line between the Lower and
Upper Silurian rocks.
Mr. Norman Taylor describes the rock near Lancefield as being
very variable in its mineralogical character, some varieties being
greenish-black and dense (aphanitic), others light-green and por-
phyritic, and others nearly black, crystalline, and very hornblendic-


This greenstone was once largely used by the aborigines for
manufacture into stone-tomahawks and other implements. About
a mile north-east of Mount William, near Lancefield, is the site
(locally known as the native tomahawk quarries) wheuce they
principally obtained the stone.
Were a number of samples collected and microscopically ex-
amined, there is no doubt that a very great variety of mineralogical
structures and combinations would be shown to exist in these
'trappean rocks ; and, before adopting conclusions as to their
relation to the ordinary granites, further careful study will be
necessary. Two probable solutions of the problem suggest them-
selves. The first, is that the “trap” rocks of the localities referred
to are simply portions of the granitic mass, and, like it, of Lower
Plutonic origin, but that from some difference of composition, or
from having cooled under different conditions, their mineralogical
structure assumed forms different from those common among the
ordinary granites. The second, is that they are intruded or irrupted
masses through, or re-fusions of, the granite subsequent to its first
cooling, and that they indicate the localities of deep-seated volcanic
activity during Palaeozoic times, in which case they might be
classed as Upper Plutonic.
Illustrative examples of the latter theory are described by Mr.
A. W. Howitt, in his work entitled “ The Diorites and Granites
of Swift’s Creek and their Contact Zones, with Notes on the
Auriferous Deposits.”
In the work referred to, Mr. Howitt gives an exhaustive
description of the petrological and mineralogical characteristics of
the igneous and metamorphic rocks of SwifPs Creek, a tributaiy
of the Tambo River, and shows that after “regional” metamor-
phosis of the Silurian rocks of thatlocality, and at the line of passage
from the metamorphic into the normal Silurian rocks, intrusions of
granite and diorite took place, which effected aiound them a still
further metamorphism (“contact” metamorphism) of the slates
and schists. Mr, Howitt draws the conclusion that these intru-
sions took place after the close of the Silurian, and before com-
mencement of the Upper Devonian, periods, and wcxe piobably
■connected with the volcanic activity of that time, ihese Newer
Plutonic rocks will, however, be referred to when describing the
rocks of the Devonian period.
On the northern margin of the valley of the Wannon is an
area occupied by igneous rocks, classed as “trap, of the true
position of which, Avhether Older or Newer Plutonic, intrusive or
contemporaneous (i.e., the lava flows or injected sheets of their
period), nothing is known. Their character varies in different
localities. A few miles eastward from Castertou, a dark dense
greenstone is exposed in the bed of McPherson’s Creek. It is


in some places imdecomposed, and in others decomposed to a
condition resembling the decomposed Older Volcanic rocks of the
Tertiary period. On the slopes of the hills above, the rock appears
slightly decomposed, and exhibits a curiously-blended mixture
of portions of a dense aphanitic structure, with others of a porous
vesicular character, almost resembling pumicestone.
North of Coleraine, one variety is a dark, dense, flinty, and
exceedingly fine greenstone or Labradorite diorite. Another
description is wackenitic in character, resembling an altered
volcanic mud, rather soft, yellowish-brown, and highly felspathic,
with porphyritically-included crystals of felspar ; sometimes
vesicular, and containing in the vesicular cavities a soft, greenish,
clayey material (lithoraarge). In its composition, this rock also
approaches phonolite.
At the Nigretta falls, on the Wannon, the rock is a typical
quartz and felspar porphyry of a brownish-pink felsitic base, with
embedded quartz and felspar crystals. At Cavendish, further
eastward, is a dark greenish-grey, dense, and much-jointed rock,
apparently aphanite, not showing porphyritic structure. From an
outcrop in the Grampians, coloured as granite on the Geological
Sketch-map, specimens were obtained and described, in Mr. A.
R. C. Selwyn’s catalogue of 1868, as granite felspar-porphyry,
syenitic porphyry, and felstone porphyry. So little is known of
the geology of this portion of the colony, that a mere reference to
the lithological character of the rocks is all that can at present be
given.
On the northern slopes of the Barrabool hills, west of Geelong,
occurs a small area of what Professor Ulrich describes as “diallage
rock”—a coarsely-crystalline granular mixture of light-green
Labradorite, and of a dark-green augitic mineral, which, according
to its lustre and cleavage, is diallage. This Plutonic mass is sur-
rounded by Mesozoic rocks, but is evidently older than the latter,
from the fact of beds of Mesozoic conglomerate in the neighbour-
hood containing pebbles of the diallage rock. On accounts of its
colour and susceptibility to fine polish, this rock is well adapted
for ornamental purposes, though very hard to work.
The general conformity of the ordinary Lower Plutonic granites
to one type, in all parts of the world, indicates a general similarity
if not a synchronism of the conditions under which they attained
their present structure. Their varieties in character and arrange-
ment of mineral constituents may be justly attributed to —(1) local
differences as regards the presence of those constituents in greater
or less quantity, the entire absence of some of them, or the
addition of other than the common minerals ; (2) differences
in the character of the sedimentary rocks, which, in a trans-
muted form, have entered into the composition of the granites ;
(3) differences of heat, rates of cooling, intensity of chemical


and hydrothermal action, and of depths below the surface and
pressure of superincumbent rocks at which these agencies were
in operation.
The greater number of varieties of mineral composition and
arrangement, hardness,'general structure, texture, &c., noticeable
in the trappean or Newer Plutonic rocks, indicates that the con-
ditions under which these combinations were effected, and the
cooling of the rock-masses took place, were more varied than in
the case of the Older Plutonic granites.
Re-fusion may also in many cases have caused an altered
arrangement of component minerals.
Leaving the remaining groups of igneous rocks for consideration
in connexion with the sedimentary deposits of the geological
epochs to which they belong, the Lower Palaeozoic and meta-
morphic (azoic) sedimentary rocks will hoav be noticed.

Lower Palceozoic and Metamorphic (Azoic) Rocks. Silurian
Rocks—geographical extent. Metamorphic Rocks—areas
respectively occupied by Lower and Upper Silurian Rocks;
leading characteristics; general theory as to origin and
metamorphism. The Metamorphic Rocks — “regional ”
and “ Unaltered Lower Silurian Rocks—fossils.
Upper Silurian Rocks — fossils. Physical Character of
Silurian Country.
The Lower Palaeozoic rocks of Victoria have been referred,
upon clear palaeontological evidence, to the Lower (Cambro)
Silurian and Upper Silurian groups.
With the exception of the Lower Cambrian and Laurentian
rocks, not yet recognised, and probably not occurring in Victoria,
the Silurian strata are the oldest in the world that contain
vestiges of organic life. As surface or underlying rocks, they
occupy the greater part of Victoria, from the sea-coast to eleva-
tions exceeding 6,000 feet; from the Glenelg to Cape Howe, and
from Cape Liptrap to the Murray, constituting the prevailing
rock-formation of the Main Divide mountain system, and the bed-
rock of the entire colony, except in places where the subjacent
granites and trappean rocks have been laid bare. Taking a
broad view of the Silurian system generally, it may be described
as extending across the colony in a series of sharp alternate anti-
clinal and synclinal undulations, which form the mines folds of a
great, more or less, broken, synclinal trough, whose edges appear
at either side of the country.
Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn estimated the total thickness of the series,
making allowance for the recurrence of the same bands, at not
less than 35,000 feet.
The metamorphic rocks of the series, among which may pos-
sibly be representatives of the Lower Cambrian and Laurentian
groups, appear between the Wannon and Glenelg Rivers westward
of the Grampians—where they constitute the rock-formation of
the Avestern terminal spurs of the Main Divide—and in the north-
eastern or Omeo district, where they prevail over a considerable
length of the Main Divide and the country extending north and
south from it.
In both the districts mentioned, the rocks of this group are
metamorphic as regards lithological character, and are so indicated
upon the Geological Sketch-map ; but, in geological age, they
appear to be Silurian as regards the period of their deposition.


The normal or unaltered Lower Silurian rocks form the pre-
vailing rock-foundation from westward of Ararat to a line from
Melbourne to Heathcote ; eastward of that line, and occupying
the central eastern portion of the colony, appears the Upper
Silurian group, the rocks of which are clearly recognisable as far
eastward as a line from the Macalister River, in Gippsland, to
Bepalla. The Silurian rocks eastward from that line have been
indicated on the Geological Sketch-map as Lower Silurian, but,
from recently acquired information, it appears likely that they are
Upper Silurian as far eastward as Beechworth.
The leading characteristics of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks
generally, in Victoria, are the normal N.Wly. to N.N.EIy. strike,
and the high rate of inclination of their bands, caused by the crump-
ling or folding process to which they were subjected at a date
probably not long subsequent to their deposition, as we find nearly
horizontally-bedded rocks of Upper Palaeozoic age resting on the
abraded up-turned edges of the nearly vertical Silurian strata.
A statement of the generally-accepted working theory as to the
causes of this plication of the strata, and of other processes to
which they have been subjected, may not be out of place here,
for though familiar to most students of geology it may not be so
to the general reader, and will serve to elucidate foregoing remarks
as to the Plutonic rocks. In the first place, it is now recognised
as a demonstrated fact that most stratified rocks are the results of
the gradual deposit by the sea of matter once held by it in suspen-
sion or solution, and originally derived from the disintegration of
pre-existing formations, and that, by the action of pressure, heat,
chemical agencies, or whatever causes, these once soft and plastic
sediments were indurated and converted into rock-masses. The
results of astronomical and geological investigations combine to
justify the belief that this earth was once in a state of intense
heat, and in the condition of a molten mass environed by an
atmosphere of gases ; that, gradual cooling, allowed the consolida-
tion of a crust on the surface of the heated bulk, the formation of
water by the union of its component gases and the descent of that
water on the surface of the globe; and that from that epoch com-
menced the work of deposit, denudation, and re-distribution of
particles by aqueous action that has ever since been in unceasing
progress.
Whether this theory be correct in detail or not, it is very evident
that a hardened crust of some description, on which the first
aqueously-deposited strata could be laid down, must have been in
existence, and that during the formation of these earliest sedi-
mentary rocks conditions were present which do not obtain with
regard to the deep-sea deposits now in progress.
The earth was still in a highly-heated condition and of greater
bulk than now; the water probably covered the entire surface, and


continued for a long time after its descent in a state of ebullition,
and Avas charged with a greater amount of mineral matter in solu-
tion than at present. Natural chemical operations were in a
state of intense activity, aided by the heat.
With the abatement of the surface-heat, the loAver forms of
marine organic life appeared, and their remains were entombed in
the accumulating sediments which were laid doAvn by the water
upon the then thin crust of consolidated igneous matter.
The continued cooling process, and the reduction of the ex-
panding heat-force which had partly counteracted the attraction
of gravity, caused general shrinkage of the interior bulk ; the
hardened crust, with its superimposed sedimentary layers, drawn
centrewards by the attraction of gravity from within, and impelled
by the atmospheric pressure from without, naturally sank, and in
sinking became folded and corrugated through having to occupy
a decreased area. It is easy to conceive that during such process
the doAvnward undulations of the sedimentary layers, together
with the igneous crust on which they had been deposited, would
be lowered to within the influence of the heated nucleus, by which
the lower edges and folds of the broken and plicated strata would
be fused, partly absorbed, and altered. Distinct from the heat of
the internal mass, which would only radiate a short distance, heat
generated by motion would no doubt play an important part in
effecting alterations of the plicated strata. Such movements were
probably repeated from time to time at different parts of the
earth's surface as further contractions took place. Besides move-
ments resulting from general shrinkage, extraordinary pressure in
one locality Avould cause an upward thrusting in another of the
heated material, and the local transmutation thereby of the sedi-
mentary rocks at the planes of contact.
It is very improbable, as pointed out by Professor Jukes in his
Manual of Geology, that the primeval igneous crust consisted of
granite, as such a rock would not be formed at the surface. Every
vestige of the original crust has, in all likelihood, been re-melted
and transmuted along Avith portions of the superincumbent sedi-
mentary layers, and the granite, as we now see it, is the product
of the melted mass which has cooled at great depths beneath the
surface.
The above is at present the generally-accepted explanation as
to the cause of the highly contorted and plicated state of the
Older Palaeozoic rocks, and the previously noticed phenomenon of
their being frequently found resting on edge against the granite,
as well as their metamorphosed condition for a greater or less
distance from their planes of contact Avith the latter. The out-
lines of the theory as to origin having been so far enunciated, the
LoAver Palasozoic strata will hoav be more fully described, com-
mencing Avith the metamorphic stratified rocks or crystalline


schists, classed as Azoic from the non-discovery hitherto of any
fossils in their layers, though probably of Silurian age as regards
their deposition.
Metamorphic Rocks and Crystalline Schists.
Strictly speaking, all rocks composed of consolidated sedimentary
deposits have been metamorphosed, inasmuch as their present con-
dition is very different from what it was when they were first laid
down in the form of silt, mud, sand, gravel, or precipitates, owing
to the long-continued influences of pressure, heat, hydrothermal
and chemical.action; but the term “metamorphic” is here specially-
applied to certain groups of rocks, which appear to be the extreme
products of this process of transmutation, and may be divided, as
indicated in Mr. A. W. Howitt’s work, previously referred to, into
two kinds, “regional” and “ contact.”
The character of the first appears to be the result of long-
continued metamorphic action radiating for great distances and
gradually decreasing outwards from central foci. The precise
nature of this action is still a matter of conjecture, but it appears
to have been different from that which operated in the case of
the “ contact ” metamorphic rocks in which the metamorphism is
more local, and is evidently the effect caused by intrusions or
invasions of the sedimentary strata by igneous masses, the influence
of which did not extend very far and did not continue long in
activity.
In fact, it is frequently found that the “ regional ” metamorphic
rocks have been further and subsequently affected by “ contact ”
metamorphism at their planes of junction with the granites and
trappean rocks.
Of the two great “ regional ” metamorphic areas in Victoria,
one is situated between the Wannon and Glenelg Rivers, west-
ward of the Grampians, and includes the western terminal spurs
of the Main Divide ; the other is a tract of country in the north-
eastern portion of the colony lying to the eastward of the Dividing
Range between the Ovens and Kiewa Rivers, and of the heads of
the Dargo River, extending southward of the Main Divide into
the Tarabo Valley, and eastward and northward to the Murray.
The rocks of the western area have been but little examined,
and are very much overlaid by newer deposits ; they occur exposed
between the Wannon and Glenelg Rivers, north of the former and
south and east of the latter. They surround a central mass of
granite, to which their relation has not yet been studied, and con-
sist principally of brown and white fine to coarse quartzites, some
curious forms of granulite, foliated micaceous, talcose, chloritic, and
serpentinous schists, and schists composed of alternating quartzose
and argillaceous laminae. They are unconformably overlaid by


the Upper Palaeozoic sandstones of the Dundas Range, and are,
therefore, clearly of older date, probably Silurian, or possibly
of the Cambrian or Laurentian series. No actual gold workings
have been opened, though small prospects of gold are reported to
have been obtained from both alluvial deposits and quartz reefs
within this area.
The metamorphic rocks of the North-Eastern district, which
includes Omeo and other gold-fields, afford fine opportunities for
examination, as gradations of structure are in many places easily
traceable on the surface, unconcealed by any overlying deposit.
The best observed tract is that extending from the Dargo River,
near May ford, to Mount Bogong in one direction, and to Omeo
and Mount Tambo in another. On the western slope towards, and
in the bed of, the Dargo River at Mayford, are the normal Silurian
■slates and sandstones.
From Mayford, towards Bogong or Omeo, a gradual change is
observable in their character ; the ordinary rocks pass into silky
micaceous schists, followed by mica-schist, gneiss, and gneissose
Granite, finally merging into granite which yet shows occasionally
a rudely-schistose structure, indicative of its having been once in
the form of a stratified rock. Similar gradations are observable
all round this metamorphic area, of which the Bogong Range is
the most central granitic mass, though there are several other
granite tracts that appear either to represent foci whence radiated
the metamorphic influences which altered the Silurian rocks, or, at
all events, to be the extreme results of these influences. Besides
the common gneissose and micaceous schists, there are in the
Chiltern, Omeo, Bogong, and Mitta Mitta districts many varieties
of metamorphosed stratified rocks, such as nodular micaceous
schist, chiastolite schist, leptynite schist containing garnets,
hornblende schist, and others.
In some cases, the altered rocks agree in general direction of
strike with the unaltered, but in others the former show extreme
contortion, and their strike varies greatly from the normal direction.
Numerous dykes and injected masses of porphyry, greenstone,
diorite, &c., showing great diversity of mineralogical structure,
intersect the metamorphic schists throughout the Omeo district.
At Stawell, and near Ararat, occur small belts, about a mile in
width, of metamorphic rocks, consisting —as described by Mr.
Norman Taylor in his report upon the Stawell gold-field (Geo-
loo-ical Progress Report, No. 11.) —of foliated gneissose schists,
passing into true gneiss, composed of alternating layers of felspar,
hornblende, and quartz, hornblendic gneiss, and other varieties.
Some of the metamorphic rocks of Stawell, however, differ
very little from the normal Silurian strata, except in being gener-
ally more indurated and foliated than the latter.


“ Contact ” Metamorphic Rocks.
The “ contact” metamorphic rocks occupy zones fringing nearly
all the granitic and trappean rock-masses where the Paheozoic
sedimentary rocks come in contact with them, and sometimes,
though by no means invariably, form the walls of dykes or other
smaller igneous intrusions.
They very much resemble the “regional” metamorphic rocks
in variety of lithological character, and exhibit the same grada-
tions of metamorphism, though generally in a less degree, and
with the exception that distinct boundary lines can be traced
between them and the granite, when the latter is invasive or
intrusive, as distinguished from the “ regional ” metamorphic
granite.
The alteration often does not consist in more than induration, or
the addition of a spotted or slightly nodular character to the
ordinary slates, &c. For instance, hand specimens from the
junction of the granite and the Silurian rocks at Maldon can be
obtained, showing granite on one side and indurated siliceous
sandstone on the other. Near the contact of the trappean rocks
of Mount Camel, north of Heathcote, the Upper Silurian rocks
have been metamorphosed for a short distance to the conditions
of jasper, chert, quartzites, and siliceous breccias.
Breccias, made up of angular fragments of altered sandstone
cemented by siliceous matter, occur in places near the granite
boundary at Beechworth. At the junction of the trappean
and Upper Silurian rocks near Lillydale, the latter are much
indurated and in some places metamorphosed into schistose
quartzites.
At the head of the Buchan is a metamorphic calcareous schist
acutely corrugated, and on the Limestone River occurs a band of
nearly white marble. The “ contact ” metamorphism rarely ex-
tends more than half-a-mile, sometimes only a few yards, from the
granite or trappean boundaries, and in some cases has evidently
been effected at a date subsequent to that of the “ regional”
metamorphism, as shown in Mr. A. W. Howitt’s work, already
referred to, on the geology of Swift’s Creek, It may, therefore,
be justifiably assumed that there were two phases of metamorphic
action operating at different epochs.
In the earliest of these, the action was long-continued and far-
penetrating in its effects, and the blending or transmutation of the
sedimentary rocks with or into the plastic igneous masses which
subsequently cooled in the form of granite took place by slow
gradations of change. It is doubtful, too, whether the heat w r as
evolved from those igneous masses or was locally engendered by
the movements of the rocks themselves.
In the second, or later, era of metamorphism, the transmutation
of portions of the stratified rocks into granite was more complete,


but ceased at more abruptly defined limits, while the partial meta-
morphism of the former did not extend very far outside the limits
of complete transmutation.
Further investigation would no doubt show the existence of
various stages, intermediate between “ regional ” and “contact”
metamorphism, among the zones of altered rocks surrounding
granite areas lying between the extreme eastern and western
metamorphic areas of Victoria; but, in the present state of know-
ledge, only the two distinctions already noted can be indicated
with any degree of certainty.
The Unaltered Lower Silurian Rocks.
The term “ unaltered ” is here used simply to designate those
Silurian rocks which do not exhibit in their structure the distinct
effects, as above described, of “regional” or “contact” metamor-
phism.
The Lower Silurian rocks prevail westward of a line from Mel-
bourne to Heathcote, and form the “ bed-rock” or “ bottom” of all
the western gold-fields. On these rocks lie the most extensive
and richest auriferous gravels, and traversing them are the gold-
bearing quartz reefs to which Victoria so largely owes her present
high position as a mining country.
The leading petrographical features of the Lower Silurian
strata are their frequent sharp alternate anticlinal and synclinal
undulations; their strike, which varies in bearing from magnetic
north to north-west, and the invariably high rate of easterly or
westerly incline of the bands at angles of from 60° to vertical.
Lithologically, sandstones, slates, shales, and mudstones constitute
the prevailing types, and of these there are many varieties and
blendings of character. The sandstones vary from hard, dense
quartzose, and gritty, fine and coarse to soft and argillaceous, the
latter being usually more or less micaceous. They occur in bands
of from less than an inch to many feet in thickness, sometimes
distinctly schistose and sometimes exhibiting little or no lamination.
At the surface their prevailing colours are different shades of
brown, grey, and sometimes yellow, reddish, or nearly white; but
below water-level they are dark-grey or blue, sometimes nearly
black, and occasionally of a dark-greenish colour. Bands of hard,
dense quartzite or quartz-rock, as distinguished from vein quartz,
are frequent in the Whipstick country, north-west from Sand-
hurst, and also, more rarely, in other localities. Conglomerates
and breccias are very rare. A slate conglomerate is noted on
one of the geological maps as occurring at Spring Plains, and a
quartzite breccia is described by Professor Ulrich as occurring
near Maldon.
The slates, shales, and mudstones exhibit as many degrees of
texture, hardness, and colour as the sandstones. At the surface


they are usually white, grey, brown, yellow, or reddish, occasion-
ally mottled, and sometimes dark-grey or blue. Like the sand-
stones, they are almost invariably dark-coloured below the water-
level. The cleavage and the stratification of the argillaceous
layers are generally identical, but cleavage distinct from stratifica-
tion is not uncommon.
No limestone bauds have yet been found among the rocks of the
Lower Silurian series in the area west of Melbourne.
The characteristic and most abundant fossils of these rocks are
graptolites (polyzoa ), on the evidence of which Professor McCoy
was enabled to co-relate the Victorian Lower Silurian strata with
those of Europe and America.
In the commencement of the first decade of his Prodromus of
the Palaeontology of Victoria, Professor McCoy mentions that,
shortly before coming to Victoria, he found in the slate-rocks of
the old Roman gold-mines in Wales exactly the same species of
graptolites as those which he subsequently discovered to be the
most common in the gold-field slates of this colony; and that
the Romans had in Wales obtained gold from quartz-veins
traversing slates of exactly the same geological age as those of
Victoria.
The series known as the Llandeilo flags and the Bala rocks in
Wales are those to which our Lower Silurian rocks are shown on
palaeontological evidence to be the equivalents. The various
species of the family Graptolitidae which have been found in Vic-
toria, and have been figured and described by Professor McCoy
in his decades, are as follows:
Fhyllograptus folium (His. sp.), var. typus (Hall) ; Diplo-
grapsus mucronatvs (Hall sp.) ; D. pristis (His. sp.); D.
rectangularis (McCoy) ; D. bicornis (Hall) ; Didymograpsus
fruticosus (Hall sp.) ; D. quadrihrachiatus (Hall sp.) ; D.
bryonides (Hall sp.) ; D. octobrachiatus (Hall sp.) ; D. Logani
(Hall) var, Australis (McCoy); D. extensus (Hall); D. caduceus
(Salter); Diplograpsus palmeus (Barr sp,); Cladograpsus ramosus
(Hall sp.); C.furcatus (Hall sp.); Didymograpsus gracilis; D.
Thureaui (McCoy) ; D. Headi (Hall). The only forms other than
graptolites, mentioned by Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn in his essay, are
Hymenocaris , Siphontreta (S', micula , McCoy), and Lingula.
The Silurian rocks occurring eastward of a line from the
Macalister River in Gippsland to near Benalla, have been pro-
visionally referred to the Lower Silurian groups, partly on account
of their lithological resemblance to those westward of Melbourne,
and partly because of the discovery in the slates at Deddick,
near the New South Wales botmdary line, of a graptolite
(.Diplograpsus rectangularis , McCoy), and the identification at
Guttamurrh Creek, Snowy River, of Didymograpsus caduceus
and Diplograpsus foliaceus in vertical slates capping the granite.


It is very likely, however, that the classification of the rocks of
a considerable area in the eastern part of the colony may have to
he altered from Lower to Upper Silurian, if further investigation
tends to corroborate some slight evidence already obtained in .that
direction.
The ranges consisting of Lower Silurian rocks in the western
portion of Victoria nowhere greatly exceeded 2,000 feet in altitude,
and are generally much lower. The axial line of the Main
Divide is nearly at right angles to the strike of the rock layers,
while the courses of the principal rivers and creeks, and of the
leading spurs separating them, approximately conform to the latter
in general direction. Portion of the eastern (presumably Lower)
Silurian area is more alpine in its character : the two highest
mountains. Mounts Hotham and Feathertop, exceed 6,000 feet in
height, and the features of the country are on a grander scale than
in the western area, where the character of the Lower Silurian
ranges is marked by a general sameness.
Upper Silurian Rocks.
As before stated, the provedly Upper Silurian rocks occupy the
central portion of the main mountain system of Victoria, within
an area of about 100 miles in width, bounded on the west by a line
from Melbourne to Heathcote, and on the east by the Macalister
River and a line thence to Benalla.
Ihe northernmost extension of the rocks of this area is where
they slope - beneath the Murray Tertiaries, at the extremity of the
Mount Camel Range ; and their southernmost exposure, separated
by an area of superimposed Mesozoic rocks from the spurs of the
Main Divide, but without doubt continuous with the latter under
the Mesozoic rocks, is within a tract bordering the coast of
Waratah Bay and Corner Inlet, from Cape Liptrap to the Bennison
River, near loster. About 10 miles north of Foster a small
outcrop of Upper Silurian rocks through the Mesozoic strata
occurs at Turton’s Creek.
Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn remarks, in his work, that “a considerable
unconformity certainly exists between the L T pper and Lower
Silurian groups ; they present differences in general lithological
character and physical structure similar to those observed between
the same groups in Britain.”
I conceive, however, that the unconformity here remarked by
Mr. Selwyn simply refers to their lithological character, as the
precise lines of junction of the two groups have not been so
nearly ascertained as to enable it to be stated that they are strati-
graphically unconformable.
The undulations of the Upper Silurian rocks appear to be less
frequent than those of the Lower ; the average rate of dip is also
less in the former, the general rate being from 45° to 80°, though


vertical bands are not uncommon. The general strike of the
Upper Silurian strata is from N.N.W. to N.W., though at Cape
Liptrap and Turton’s Creek it takes the abnormal direction of
from N. 10° E. to N. 30° E. Considerable contortion is also
observable in the rocks along the Cape Liptrap coast. (See Figs.
6 and 7.)
Fig. 6.—Section.
These rocks exhibit as many varieties of texture, colour, and
hardness as do those of the LoAver Silurian group, but are usually
less slaty than the latter.
They consist principally
of sandstones, mud-
stones, rubbly shales,
and, occasionally, slates
or schists. Breccias, con-
glomerates, and quartz-
ites are sometimes met
with, as at Heathcote,
Fig. 7.—Fean.
Steep Silurian banks.
Anderson’s Creek, the Alexandra district, Cape Liptrap, and
other localities. At Cape Liptrap and Turton’s Creek are bands
composed of a curious mixture of volcanic and calcareous sedi-
mentary ingredients. Limestones of a 7 cry excellent quality occur
at Lillydale, at Waratah Bay, east from Cape Liptrap, and near
the Tyers River in Grippsland. Bands of nearly white, some-
what slaty, saccharoidal marble and grey sub-crystalline limestones
occur among what are supposed to be Upper, but may be Lower,
Silurian rocks in the Limestone River, one of the heads of the
Murray; and in the heads of the Buchan River, on the south side
of the Main Divide, is an outcrop from beneath the Snowy River
porphyries of the previously mentioned acutely corrugated meta-
morphic calcareous schist, the geographical position of which is
also doubtful.
Further north, however, on the Gribbo River, is a similar lime-
stone, in which Mr. A. W. Howitt found a fossil, identified by
Professor McCoy as Palceopora, indicative of Upper Silurian.
Other more or less calcareous bands are not unfrequent.
Several masses of encrinital limestone, or marble, occur in the
valley of the Thomson River in Gippsland, and one near the
Delatite River, 5 miles Avesterly from Mansfield. A striking
similarity of lithological character exists between all of these,
and, though far apart, they are in the same belt of rock-bands.-
The limestone is grey to dark bluish-grey, compact to crystalline,
and full of crinoid stems replaced by carbonate of lime. On being


polished, the limestone base is nearly black, while the fossil
markings are white, giving the stone a somewhat ornamental
appearance.
Among some very imperfect fossils collected from one of these
patches at Cooper’s Creek, near the Thomson River copper-mine,
Professor McCoy was enabled to identify Favosites Goldfussi with
traces of a lamelliferous coral closely allied to Diplophyllum
ccespitosum, small branching forms allied to Trematopora asfiolata
and Cladopora fibrosa, and one Beyrichia allied to B. lata , with
crinoid stems of the Actinocrinus type.
From another patch on the south side of the Thomson River,
between Walhalla and Toongabbie, were obtained numerous
crinoid stems of the Actinocrinus type, some traces of Gasteropoda
apparently of the genus Acroculia , but too imperfect for determi-
nation, and a fragment of Bellerophon.
From a third patch on the banks of the Deep Creek, a branch
of the Thomson, were obtained only indeterminable fragments of
crinoid stems and the coral allied to Trematopora astiolata found
in the Cooper’s Creek limestone.
This imperfect palaeontological evidence was, in Professor
McCoy’s opinion, closely indicative of Upper Silurian, though at
one time there appeared grounds for believing that the various
limestone patches referred to —clearly identical with one another
in geological position—might be Devonian, as they appear at first
sight to fill deep hollows or pockets in the ordinary Silurian
rocks, and to be the vestiges of what were once more extensively
developed beds of more recent date. On further examination,
however, it was found that they are in reality portions of lenticular
shaped beds of limestone, of limited extent, intercalated with the
ordinary Upper Silurian rocks. When the Upper Silurian rocks
were in process of deposition as sediments, isolated colonies of
"various forms of marine life appear to have occupied portions of
the sea-bed ; these extracted lime from the sea water, and by their
action beds of limestone were formed over limited areas, while
around them the ordinary deposits of silt, &c., Avere being
accumulated. They Avere subsequently covered, indurated, and
folded with the rest of the Silurian rocks, and here and there have
been laid bare by denudation, so that they present the appearance
of wedge-shaped vertical masses of limestone fitting into cor-
responding “ pockets ” in the slates.
In one well-marked instance, near the Thomson River, between
Toongabbie and Walhalla, a quarry has been opened in the
encrinital limestone, or marble, on the broAv of a steep hill ; doAvn-
ward the limestone disappears, and nothing but slates and shales
■can be seen along the face of exposed rock beloAV the quarry. In
the bed of the creek at the bottom of the hill, and in the same
line of strike Avith the large limestone mass above, is a small


isolated vertical lenticular mass of limestone of the same character,
about a couple of feet long and one foot thick, thinning out to
nothing upwards and downwards, and entirely enclosed by the
slates except on the exposed face. The proof here as to the lime-
stone being an intercalated deposit, and of the same age as the
associated Upper Silurian slates, is beyond question.
On paleontological evidence the Upper Silurian rocks of Vic-
toria have been identified as the equivalents of the Wenlock shales,
May Hill sandstones, and Upper Ludlow rocks of England, by
Professor McCoy, who has figured and described in his decades
the following named fossils :
Petraster Smithii (McCoy) ; Urastella Selwyni (McCoy); A
G-raptolite Retiolites Australis (McCoy); Trilobites— Phacops
caudatus (Prong) ; P. fecundus (Bar.) ; Forbesia euryceps
(McCoy); Lichas Australis ( McCoy); and HomalonotusHarrisoni
(McCoy); Leptama ( Leptagonia ) rhomboidalis (Wilck. sp.); Trem-
atospira liopleura (McCoy); T. formosa (Hall); Spirifera plica-
tella (Lin.), var. macropleura (Conrad) ; S. sulcata (His.) ;
Sprigerina reticularis (Lin. sp.) ; Rhynchonella ( hemithyris) de-
cemplicata (Sow.); Nucleospira Australis (McCoy); Pentamerus
Australis (McCoy); Cardium Gippslandicum (McCoy); Ortho-
ceras icycloceras) Ibex (Sow.); 0. bullatum (Sow.); O. capillosum
(Bai\); O. Lineare (Munst.); 0. Striato-punctatum (Munst.).
The general character of the Upper Silurian country is very
mountainous, though a great deal of it, especially around Mel-
bourne, is only moderately hilly or slightly undulating.
The crest of the Main Divide, from Mount Arnold to the heads
of the Barkly, a western branch of the Macalister, maintains an
average elevation of over 4,000 feet, and consists, as do most of
the branch range systems on either side, entirely of Upper Silu-
rian rocks. The descents from the Main Divide and its leading
spurs into the creeks and rivers are very abrupt, and sometimes
precipitous ; a very dense and luxuriant vegetation, consisting of
large Eucalypts, the various scrubs, and tree ferns, is found
wherever the depth of surface soil and rubble and the climatic
conditions are favorable, especially on the south side of the Main
Divide, in the heads of the Yarra, the La Trobe, the Taujil, and
the Thomson Rivers.

Middle and Upper Palaeozoic Rocks.
In this group are included—(l) Certain igneous rocks occur-
ring in G-ippsland, and known as the Snowy River porphyries ;
(2) Limestone and other rocks occurring in various localities, and
shown on palaiontological evidence to be of Middle Devonian age ;
(3) A series of conglomerates, sandstones, shales, and contem-
poraneous trappean rocks, some of which can be referred to the
Upper Devonian period, and others, though also provisionally
classed as such, may be of later date.
In describing these three groups of rock, I avail myself largely
of the information given by Mr. A. W. Howitt, in his contributions
to the Geological Progress Reports (No. 111., pages 189 to 249,
and No. Y., pages 117 to 129), and simply give a general synopsis
of that gentleman’s observations and conclusions, though I have
had the pleasure of personally examining, in his company, much
of the country described.
The Snowy River porphyries constitute a belt which passes into
Victoria from New South Wales, and occupies at the boundary
line a breadth of nearly 20 miles, extending between the head
of the Murray, near Forest Hill, and a little to the east of the
Snowy River. The western boundary of the belt includes the
Cobberas, and runs south to near the head of Lake Tyers. The
eastern boundary runs southward, keeping parallel with, and
slightly eastward of, the Snowy River ; and the porphyries con-
stituting the belt extend down to and disappear under the Ter-
tiary deposits which border the coast on either side of the Snowy
River mouth.
The rocks to the east and west of the belt consist of granite,
“ regional,” metamorphic schists, and Silurian rocks. The
main portion of the belt forms a mountainous plateau, lying
between the Snowy River and its western tributary, the Buchan;
and this plateau has a general slope, from an elevation of from
4,000 to 6,000 feet, near the Cobberas, to a level of about 1,000
feet above the sea, near the margin of the marine Tertiaries under
which the porphyries disappear near the coast line.


This general slope is not merely clue to denudation—though
that agency has exercised upon it a certain modifying effect, and
has also produced great surface changes in eroding valleys, &c. —
but chiefly to an actual dip in the ancient land surface of the
period to which the porphyries belong, as it is found that the
Lower Paheozoic rock-foundation on which they rest has a similar
slope ; and that, Avhile at the northern portion of the plateau the
Lower Paheozoic rocks constitute from 2,000 to 2,500 feet of
its base, and the porphyries form the remainder, the former pass
out of sight beneath the level of the rivers near Buchan, where
the latter still reach an altitude of 2,000 feet above the sea.
The bulk of the rocks consists of felstone-porphyries, felstone-
ash, and agglomerates : the lower portions of the series approach
more nearly to the quartz-porphyries in character, and are more
compact and porphyritic than the upper 2,000 feet, which exhibit
clearly a fragmentary character. The fragmentary portions vary
from microscopic dust to several feet in diameter, are usually
angular, more rarely slightly rounded, and consists of felstones
and quartz-porphyries of various kinds embedded in a felstone
base. The occurrence of a fragment of well-marked granite
among the varieties of felstones and quartz-porphyries is also noted
by Mr. Howitt, who adds, however, that he has not observed
fragments of sedimentary rocks in these agglomerates. In places,
particularly in the Little River, a branch of the Smywy River, a
distinct bedded or stratified appearance is noticeable both in the
fragmentary and in the more compact and porphyritic felstones,
though they do not present any evidence of the action of Avater in
sorting and arranging the beds. (Figs. 8 and 9.)
Fig. B.—Little Rivek.


Some of the higher mountains rising from the general level of
the table-land are marked by central masses of quartz-porphyry
of a distinctive character from the bulk of the Snowy River
porphyries.
In the north, the Cobberas, the Wombargo Mountain, and the
range thence northward to Mount Hotham, and in the south
Mount Tara and Mount Nowa Nowa belong to this class. The
general conclusions arrived at by Mr. Howitt are, to quote his own
Fig. 9.—Near Murrindal River.
(d) Very fine-grained rock—felspathic ;
dark to light purple, in alternating bands
of colour. Throughout the fine-grained
rock there are patches of coarse particles.
The dip is probably N. 10°-20° E. at 53°.
(c) Similarflne-grained rock, with coarse
fragments imbedded.
(6) Fine-grained rock, grey in colour
under the lens particles can be made out
which are angular—some seem to he
minute prisms of felspar.
(a) Agglomerate of varieties of fel-
stones, from 12 inches diameter to dust.
The surface weathers very rough.
words, that —“ The Snowy River porphyries may be regarded
as a great volcanic sheet, the lowest part of which is seen in the
Little River and the upper part at the Wombargo uplands. It
rests upon the Lower Palasozoic foundation, and in places has been
let down by faults into it. Its lowest portions approach the
quartz-porphyries in character, and in ascending it becomes more
and more fragmentary.”
In a portion of the district “ these great masses of felspathic
rocks seem to lie grouped around a central mass of quartz-por-
phyries of a somewhat peculiar character.” Mr. Howitt proceeds
to draw “ the inference that in the Snowy River porphyries we
may see the accumulations of ash, agglomerates, and lavas, due to
former volcanic activity in Pakeozoic times,” and that “ these
rocks, whose characters are obscure, may well be regarded as
having undergone such changes that former beds of fine ash, or
even of agglomerates, may have become structureless rock-masses
of siliceous and felsitic character.-”
The ridge extending from the Cobberas to near Buchan, along
which occur the masses of quartz-porphyries, is regarded by Mr.
Howitt as indicating the line of “ a meridional fissure on which a
series of volcanoes was built up/’ and the masses of quartz-
porphyry as the “ denuded t stumps of volcanoes round which

accumulations of felstone, ash, and agglomerate, with felsitic rocks
of indefinite character are still to he seen grouped.” (Fig. 10.)
From the fact of their being clearly more recent than the
Silurian rocks, and from their being overlaid in places by the
Middle Devonian limestones, the Snowy River porphyries may
with tolerable certainty he referred to the Lower, or to the lower
portion of the Middle, Devonian period, the limestones of which
latter epoch ivill next be noticed.
It may also be safely inferred that these Devonian lava-flows
filled, or partly filled, a great trough in the Lower Paheozoic strata
and granites, and that the sides of that trough rose to a far greater
elevation than they reach now. The action of denudation has had
less effect on the porphyries than on their boundary rocks, and has
reduced the latter to a lower level than the former. Some idea of
the extent of this denuding action will be conveyed in the remarks
on the Upper Devonian rocks.
The soil yielded by the Snowy River porphyries is usually poor
and gritty, though in the flat valleys near the heads of the streams
there is a black peaty soil, supporting a fair growth of snow-grass
and sub-alpine plants. The timber and scrubs are, as a rule, in-
ferior and scanty. The scenery generally, however, is by no means
devoid of attractiveness. The loftier summits are characterized
by a stern, rugged grandeur, while the lower portions of some of
the creeks and rivers wind through precipitous ravines and
canons, forming successions of picturesque waterfalls and deep
pools. (Fig. 11.)
One of the grandest views of mountain scenery, and at the same
time one of the finest examples of the results of denudation to be
found in Victoria, is to be seen from Turn-back Mountain, over-
looking the great valley of the Snow T y River.
Middle Devonian Rocks.
Bindi and Buchan Limestones , fyc.
These rocks appear to he confined to the eastern half of the
colony, and only occur at wide intervals as isolated patches of
from several square miles to a few acres in extent, occupying
hollows in older rocks. The largest areas of the typical lime-
stones of this series are at Bindi, on the Tambo River, and at
Buchan, at the junction of the Buchan and Murrindal Rivers.
The fossils found in these limestones are described by Professor
McCoy as characteristic of the Middle Devonian epoch, and some
of them are perfectly identical with some found in the European
Middle Devonian limestones of the Eifel.
The fossils described and figured by Professor McCoy in his
decades are as follows :—Favosites Goldfussi (d’Orb.), a coral;
Spirifera Icevicostata (Yak), Chonetes Australis (McCoy), and
Bhragmoceras subtrigonum (McCoy), Molluscs ; Asterolepis ornata


(Eichwald), var. Australis (McCoy), a ganoid placodermatons
fish, concerning which Professor McCoy remarks that it is an ex-
traordinary circumstance to find in Australia these representatives
of the “ great ganoid armour-plated fishes ” of the genus Astero-
lepis, which are amongst the most abundant and striking charac-
teristics of the Devonian rocks of Russia, “ in limestones of the
same age, and accompanied by the corals and shells of the Plymouth
and Eifel limestones of similar age, with which they are not known
to occur in England or Germany, and which do not occur with
them in the Russian beds.”
The Bindi limestones constitute a patch low down in the valley,
and on the east side of the Tambo River, and occupy a basin in
the older rocks, which here consist of granites, quartz-porphyries,
and indurated Silurian slates. The Tambo River has eroded its
course round the northern and western margins of the limestones,
along their junction with the older rocks, and consequently a
large portion of the western side of the limestone area has been
removed.
The dip of the limestone beds which remain is to the south-
west, or from their eastern rim.
The fossils found in the Bindi limestones are principally the
characteristic spirifers, and are very plentiful.
The Buchan limestones occur between the Buchan and Murrin-
dal Rivers, near their junction, and occupy a deep hollow in the
Snowy River porphyries, into which they have been further let
down by faults. The limestones are dark-blue to nearly black,
compact, and somewhat thickly bedded, and generally dip away
from the porphyries which encircle them. They also show evi-
dences of having been subjected to considerable folding and con-
tortion in places. Numerous sink-holes occur in this limestone
tract; in one place the Murrindal River flows into a sink-hole,
and has for some distance a subterranean passage, re-appearing
again further down its course. A surface channel exists, but
water only flows in it during floods, when the quantity is too great
to escape by the underground passage.
All the above-mentioned fossils have been found in the Buchan
limestones.
Other similar but smaller patches of Middle Devonian lime-
stone occur —occupying hollows in the Snowy River porphyries—
in the valley of Basin Creek, eastward from the Murrindal ; in the
Yalong Creek, near its junction with the Snowy River ; at Gel-
lingall, at the junction of the Woolshed Creek and the Buchan ;
at the junction of the Snowy River and the Buchan ; and at
Butcher’s Ridges, near Gelantipy, where there are three patches
occupying hollows in the porphyries —one capped by basalt on the
table-laud, and two other smaller ones on either side of Butcher's
Creek.


All these patches and outliers are similar in lithological cha-
racter to the typical limestones of Buchan, and contain the
characteristic Middle Devonian spirifers found in the latter.
The above-described marine limestones, whose total thickness
is estimated at 400 or 500 feet only, form the upper portion of
the Middle Devonian group, which they serve to identify. The
base of the group is composed of rocks of a different character,
which are found underlying the limestones and intervening between
them and the (Lower Devonian) Snowy River porphyries.
This subject has been ably worked out by Mr. A. W. Howitt,
from whose notes on the Devonian rocks of North Gippsland,
published in the Geological Progress Report, No. Y., pages 117
and following, I extract the following leading observations :
The lower beds of the Buchan group exhibit a thickness of
from 700 to 1,000 feet of calcareous tufas, felsite tufas, breccias,
&c., between which and the Snowy River porphyries certain
well-marked distinctions are noticeable. As previously shown in
describing the latter, no traces of aqueous action in their arrange-
ment can be observed, and the volcanic materials which compose
them appear to have fallen, and to have been arranged, on land ;
whereas, from the base of the Buchan series and upwards to the
unmistakably marine limestones, the tufas, breccias, &c., are of a
character which clearly indicates that their component volcanic
and other materials fell into, and were arranged by, water. From
the partculars given by Mr. Howitt in a number of sections, the
lowest beds consist of unstratified breccia-conglomerates, composed
of rounded and angular felsite blocks, with fragments of slates and
sandstones resembling those of the Lower Palaeozoic formations.
Above these occur fine and coarse breccia-conglomerates made
up of similar fragments and sandstones composed of felsitic grains,
all showing to a greater or less extent distinct signs of bedding.
A sheet of compact felsite and one of basalt, apparently repre-
senting lava-flows, are shown as occurring above these in one
section given by Mr. Howitt.
On thick red beds, resembling sandstones, rest the lowest lime-
stones, above which occur thick yellow beds, apparently either de-
composed felsites or consolidated felsitic mud. These are followed
by thin-bedded limestones, some of which contain numerous
angular felsite fragments, deposited either irregularly ormbands;
above these lie the thicker bedded compact blue limestones. The
following are verbatim quotations from Mr. HowitFs treatise :
a The°Buchan limestones are therefore only part of a continuous
series. The lower part of the group consists of coarsely aggregated
felsitic breccias, the coarseness of material decreasing, but with
alternations of texture, in ascending. The deposits also become
more distinctly bedded, and in places, as at Butcher s Creek, pass
into or alternate with subordinate conglomerates m which angular
or rounded fragments of sedimentary rocks are of common


occurrence. In all the late and in many of the earlier beds,
aqueous arrangement is clearly distinguishable. The coarse
angular breccias at the base indicate, I think, a shore line.
“In all the sections occur felsitic sheets which, as a rule, are
compact, and are found under conditions which almost always
suggest that they are of contemporaneous origin.
“The passage beds are compounds in varying percentages of
limestones and felsitic particles, the latter varying in dimensions
from mere dust to several inches in diameter.
“ The felsitic admixture gradually, or in places, suddenly ceases,
and the remaining beds of the group are then purely limestones of
the ordinary character seen at Buchan, and characterized by a
numerous marine fauna of Devonian age.
* * * * * “ The general conditions indicated are, 1 think,
these : —l. A sinking coast-line with either marine or littoral
volcanoes, from which trachytic materials were ejected as frag-
ments, or emitted as flows of lava (felsite-breccias, tufas, compact,
and porphyritic felsites).
“2. Gradual extinction of volcanic activity as indicated by
the finer character of the felsite fragments, their intermixture
with calcareous materials (calcareous felsite-tufas) and their final-
cessation with succession of purely marine limestones.”
Two small outliers occupy respectively small basins at Cowom-
bat, on the fall towards the Murray, in the north-eastern corner
of the colony, near Forest Hill, and at the sources of the Native
Dog Creek, the head of the Buchan, on the southern slope of the
Main Divide. In the first of these outliers, the observable strata
consist of nearly vertical yellowish a,nd blue thin shales, with some
bands of calcareous shale and limestone, resting on the Snowy
River (Lower Devonian) porphyries and altered Silurian rocks.
In the second outlier, the rocks consist of dark shales, with
calcareous nodules, and blue compact limestones, also resting on
the Snowy River porphyries. The elevations of these outliers
above the sea probably exceed 3,000 feet.
In both places imperfect fossils (corals and small brachiopods)
have been found, which Professor McCoy considered to be indica
tive of Middle Devonian age, though probably younger than the
Bindi and Buchan limestones.
A patch of Middle Devonian limestone is indicated on the
Geological Sketch-map as occurring to the east of the Mitta Mitta
River, south from Mount Gibbo, but has not been sufficiently
examined to admit of details being given.
The tracts occupied by the Middle Devonian limestones are
smoothly rounded and hilly, or undulating, with occasional cliffs
and scaurs; the soil is of fair quality, well grassed, and supports a
medium but thinly-scattered growth of timber. The general
aspect of the country is park-like, and affords a pleasing contrast
to the rugged sterile appearance of the encircling mountains.


The Tabberabbera Shales and Cobannah Quartzites.
Another group of rocks of Middle Devonian age was found by
Mr. A. W. Howitt to occur at Tahberabbera, at the junction of the
Mitchell and Wentworth Rivers, where, in black shales, associated
with limestones, he found the characteristic Spirifera Icevicostata of
the Buchan and Bindi limestones. Besides the black shale and
limestones, there is a series of slates, flinty shales, sandstones, and
quartzites, apparently belonging to the same group, extending
south-westward from Tahberabbera beyond Cobannah, and over to
Maximilian Creek, a branch of the Freestone Creek, running into
the Avon River.
These rocks have been folded, compressed, indurated, and meta-
morphosed, and so nearly resemble somewhat altered Silurian
strata that, prior to Mr. Howitt’s investigations, they were classed
as such. They are, however, according to notes furnished me by
Mr. Howitt, unconformable, and their folding has been effected
subsequently to that of the Silurian rocks. On the north and east
these rocks appear to be bounded by granite and Silurian rocks,
while on the south and west they pass under the Upper Devonian
rocks of the Iguana Creek and Maximilian Creek,
With the Middle Devonian rocks we lose the more conspicuous
indications of metamorphism, contortion, and folding which form
such prominent characteristics of the Lower Palaeozoic and of the
last described group of the Devonian rocks.
The rock-bands in the newer formations, including that to be
described next in order as Upper Palaeozoic, though generally up-
tilted and undulating, are in some cases horizontal, and have
nowhere been folded or metamorphosed to the extent observable
in the older rocks.
The Tahberabbera and Cobannah rocks may with tolerable
safety be regarded as Middle Devonian ; they are certainly not of
more recent date, and, as above stated, show an amount of
undulation in their beds equal to that observed in the Silurian
rocks, but are unconformable to the latter, while the Upper
Devonian rocks of Iguana Creek, which immediately overlie
them, rest almost horizontally on their upturned and denuded
edges, showing that, notwithstanding the close geological relation
between the Middle and Upper Devonian Groups, a very con-
spicuous stratigraphical unconformity exists between the two.
In fact, the observed stratigraphical relations to one another
of the various groups of Palaeozoic rocks naturally suggest their
classification in three main divisions (1) Lower Palaeozoic,
including Lower and Upper Silurian ; (2) Middle Palaeozoic,
comprising the Lower and Middle Devonian ; and (3) Upper
Palaeozoic, including the whole series of the Upper Devonian
rocks and those provisionally classed under the general term of
Upper Palaeozoic.


Upper Palaeozoic.
Under the above provisional heading are here included the
Upper Devonian rocks proper, and also the rocks of two large and
several small areas occurring at wide distances apart throughout
the colony. In some cases, stratigraphical position and lithological
character constitute the only grounds on which the classification is
based ; in others the fossil flora indicate a range from Middle
Devonian to Lower Carboniferous.
The Grampian Sandstones, in the western portion of the colony,
constitute one of the two large Upper Palaeozoic areas ; the other
is situated partly in North Gippsland, and appears to extend over
the Main Divide to Mansfield.
12.— Ledcouet Quarry, Grampians (looking South). Dip of
sandstone beds W. 28°, S. 33° 30'.


Commencing with the western area, we find the ranges of the
Grampians composed of a group of sandstones which rest partly
on granite and trappean rocks, and partly on metamorphic and
Lower Silurian strata.
As no further scientific examination has been made of the
Grampian Sandstones since the publication of Mr. A. R. C.
Selwyn’s work in 1866,1 cannot do better than quote that gentle-
man’s observations:—
* * “ A thickness of upwards of 2,000 feet is ex-
posed in the precipitous escarpments of the Grampians, Mount
Sturgeon, Mount Abrupt, and the eastern face of the Victoria
Ranges. The lithological character of the series, as exhibited in
the Grampians, is strictly arenaceous —massive thick-bedded sand-
stones, with bands of sandy flags, but no slaty or shaly beds.
Considerable varieties occur in texture and composition, from very
hard siliceous grit and quartz rock, with included pebbles of white
quartz (as at Mount Talbot, Mount Arapiles, and the Black Range),
to hard and soft fine-grained freestones. The prevailing colours
are shades of whitish-brown, reddish-brown, and white, and
rarely brick-red. Much cross-stratification or false bedding is
observable, but the whole formation has a westerly dip at rather
low angles, giving a gentle slope to the face of the hills in that
direction, whilst to the eastward the beds terminate abruptly in
bold rocky escarpments and almost vertical cliffs several hundred
feet in height. (Fig. 12.)
“In the Dundas and Black Ranges, the dip of the beds is
reversed or to the eastward, indicating a synclinal axis between
these hills and the Grampians, Sierra, and Victorian Ranges.
“In some places the beds are seen to rest directly on granite*
whilst in others they rest on the up-turned and denuded edges of
the Silurian strata.”
During a very brief visit to that portion of the country, I found
that the rocks of the Dundas Range form an isolated patch of the
same character as, and evidently once continuous with, the rocks
to the eastward.
The intermediate portions have been removed by denudation,
and the subjacent metamorphic rocks have been laid bare on
the western side of a broad valley, occupied principally by
Tertiary deposits, which extends from Cavendish to the Glenelg,
and separates the Dundas from the Sierra and Victoria
Ranges.
To the north, Mount Arapiles, and several smaller hills com-
posed of the same rocks, form tolerably lofty isolated outcrops.


rising abruptly from the level Tertiary country which surrounds
them ; and it appears likely that the Upper Palaeozoic rocks
may underlie a large extent of the Tertiary tract to the north-
west.
The general physical features of the ranges indicate, beyond a
doubt, that the Upper Palaeozoic rocks which compose them are
but vestiges of a once more extensively developed formation, and
that to long-continued powerful denuding action is due the re-
moval of the major portion of the series.
The eastern Upper Palaeozoic area has only been examined at
its northern and southern portions, near Mansfield, and in Gipps-
laud, respectively. There appears little doubt as to the rocks of
the series extending continuously between the two localities and
constituting a portion of the Main Divide, of which 'a proper
geological examination has not yet been made. Viewed as a
whole, this area is in the form of a wide strip or belt of about
100 miles in length, north-west and south-east, and averaging 20
miles in width. The general south-western boundaries of this
Upper Palaeozoic tract are the Macalister River, and its western
tributary, the Barkly River, on the southern or Gippsland fall of
the Main Divide, and a lino crossing oblieprely the upper portions
and including the heads of the Jamieson, Howqua, and Delatite
Rivers, eastern tributaries of the Goulburn, on the northern slope
towards the Murray, The north-western and northern boundary
is formed by the steep Silurian and granite spurs of the Strath-
bogie Ranges, and the Blue Range, near Barjarg. The north-
eastern limit on the fall toAvards the Murray is approximately a
line from the Blue Range between the Broken River and the King
River, to near the head of the latter at the Main Divide, and
thence on the Gippsland side, a line to the Avest of, and roughly
parallel with, the VVonnongatta or Mitchell River to Maximilian
Creek, where the boundary line turns eastward and then north-
ward to Tabberabbera. The rocks of the belt here extend east-
Avard of the Mitchell, and occupy portion of the country on that
side from Tabberabbera to near Bairnsdale. The southern
boundary is formed by the IoAV-lying Tertiary deposits which flank
the Upper Pakeozoic rocks along an irregular line from the
Macalister River at Glenmaggie to the Mitchell River at Iguana
Creek,
The Iguana Creek beds are the typical rocks of that group of
the Upper Palaeozoic division, which has been classed, on good
evidence, as Upper Devonian, and they are comprised in that
portion of the great Upper Palaeozoic area which extends eastAvard
from Freestone Creek, a branch of the Avon River. The northern
boundary of this particular portion is a line skirting Maximilian


Creek, the eastern branch of the Freestone, winding thence round
the south of Yellow man’s Nob, on the Crooked River road, and
thence northward to Tabberabbera at the junction of the Mitchell
and Wentworth Rivers.
The southern boundary is, as before stated, formed by the
flanking Tertiary deposits as far as Iguana Creek. The Mitchell
River itself flows approximately along the line of junction of the
Tertiariesand the Upper Palaeozoic rocks,forming the south-western
boundary of the latter from Iguana Creek to near Bairnsdale,
whence their north-eastern margin or line of contact with the
Silurian rocks runs north-westerly to Tabberabbera. From near
Tabberabbera to Iguana Creek, the Mitchell runs between cliffs
of the rocks of the Iguana Creeks groups.
Outside the eastern margin of the main mass, Mount Taylor,
whose base consists of porphyritic granites, and several other hills,
are capped with outliers of these Upper Devonian rocks. The
term “Iguana Creek beds ” was adopted, and the reference of the
rocks to the Upper Devonian period determined, because charac-
teristic fossil plant-impressions were found in the shales interca-
lated with the sandstones and conglomerates, which form lofty
cliffs on either side of Iguana Creek, above its junction with the
Mitchell. The fossil plant-impressions from here which have been
determined, figured, and described by Professor McCoy, are as
follows -.—Cordaites Australis (McCoy), Archceopteris Howitti
(McCoy)—allied to the Canadian Upper Devonian, A. JacJcsoni,
and to "the A. Hibernica of the Upper Devonian of Kilkenny
and Berwickshire, and Sphenopteris ( Eremopteris) Iguanensis
(McCoy), somewhat differing from, but apparently most nearly-
allied to, the Sphenopteris Artemesifolia of the Lower Carboni-
ferous rocks of Northumberland.
In an interesting account of a canoe voyage down the Mitchell
from Tabberabbera (Geological Progress Report, No. 111., page
214 and following), Mr, A. W. Howitt describes the nearly vertical
Middle Devonian rocks, exposed in the river gorge, as being over-
laid by very slightly dipping Upper Devonian beds of the Iguana
Creek group, which, as the river is followed down, gradually slope
down to its bed, the older rocks passing out of sight beneath. The
lowest beds of the Upper Devonian group, observed here, appear
to be bedded felstones, over which lie conglomerates and sand-
stones, fine and coarse siliceous conglomerates, quartzose sand-
stones, with pebble bands, gritty flags, and reddish sandstones.

Layers above these, as exposed at Iguana Creek and in the

with occasional pebbles, quartz grits, ferruginous conglomerate,
sandstones, blue and yellow sbales, sometimes containing pebbles,

Further westward, at the Freestone Creek quarries, near

the quarries, a few plant-

ter on the west from those
of the Wonuongatta or Mitchell on the east. This spur bifur-
cates at the eastern end, or loftiest point, of the Mount 'Welling-
ton Bange, near the trigonometrical station, and the two branch
leading spurs thus formed embrace the drainage-area of the Avon
River. The Mount Wellington Range itself forms the first portion
of the Avestern of these spurs, and terminates at its Avestern
extremity in a huge bluff, forming a conspicuous feature, visible
from the Gippsland plains and Lakes. The spur continues
westerly, but at a decreased elevation, to Mount Hump, whence
it turns southerly, and, with numerous alternating high points and
loav saddles, gradually descends till it splits up into the numerous
minor spurs sloping down to the level country betAveen the Avon
and the Macalister. Ben Cruachau, another conspicuous mountain,
about 2,800 feet in height, forms one of the offshoots from this
spur. The eastern leading spur from Mount Wellington, forming
the divide betAveen the Avon and the Mitchell, has a general
east-south-easterly trend to Castle Hill, and then turns south-south-
easterly, running out in numerous branch spurs on the low country.


The Moroka River is a branch of the Mitchell, and heads from
a broad valley between Mount Wellington and Castle Hill, whence
it flows north through precipitous ranges for the greater part of
its length, finally turning to the east and joining the main river.
A bold lofty spur, starting from Castle Hill, runs north between
the Moroka and the Mitchell Rivers, and its terminal point before
descending to their junction is the Snowy Bluff. At the SnoAvy
Bluff a section was noted by Mr. Howitt and myself, showing
OA r er 2,000 feet of Avell exposed layers, having a slight southerly
inclination, and resting on the abraded edges of the nearly vertical
Silurian rocks. Here, again, the lowest beds, immediately on the
Silurian, are conglomerates and conglomeritic sandstones, on
which rest quartziferous and porphyritic felsites and massive
bedded felstones, clearly contemporaneous, folloAved by alterna-
tions of laminar and rubbly shales, sandstones, grits, rubbly
mudstones, and conglomerates, with intercalated contemporaneous
layers of basalt (melaphyre); the uppermost bed noted is a coarse
conglomeritic sandstone. (Fig. 18.)
These Upper Palaeozoic rocks constitute the SnoAvy Bluff,
Mount Kent, and Castle Hill Range, and the country westAA r ard of
it; the lower eastern slope of the range, toAvards the Wonnongatta,
being Silurian and G-ranite.
The boundary line between the Upper Palaeozoic and the older
rocks from Castle Hill to Freestone Creek has not been examined;
but there is no reason for doubting the general identity in geolo-
gical position of the Snowy Bluff beds with those of Freestone
and Iguana Creeks, which have been shoAvn to be of Upper
Devonian age.
At the Avon River, where it emerges from the mountainous
country, above its junction Avith Valencia Creek, occur varying
bands of thick and thin bedded fissile, purple, brown, and
yelloAvish micaceous sandstones, and purple or brick-red rubbly
mudstones, “ cornstones,” Avith other varieties of sedimentary
rocks, the Avhole forming a group known as the “ Avon Sand-
stones,” in some of the red and yelloAV sandstones of Avhich was
found the Lepidodendron ( Bergeria ) Australe, figured and de-
scribed by Professor McCoy in the first Decade of his Prodromus
of Victorian Palaeontology.' Professor McCoy expresses a strong
opinion as to the Lower Carboniferous aspect of this fossil plant-
impression; and, from my own observations, I am inclined to
believe that the beds in which it is found are among the upper-
most of the group, and younger than, though conformable with,
the Upper De\mnian beds of Freestone and Iguana Creeks. It is
highly probable, therefore, judging from their stratigraphical
position, that the Avon Sandstones are —as indicated by Professor
McCoy, on palaeontological evidence —of Lower Carboniferous age,
or passage beds in that direction upwards from the Upper
Devonian beds.

At the western boundary of the Upper Palaeozoic rocks, on the
-east side ot the Macalister River, near Glenmaggie, their lowest
beds resting on the Silurian, are conglomerates, felstones, &c.,
analogous to those on the eastern margin. Between Glenmaggie
and Glenfalloch, further up the Macalister, a tongue of Silurian
rocks, extending from the main western mass of that group, pro-
jects into the Upper Palaeozoic area as far as Mount Hump, on
the divide between the Macalister and the Avon. The lowest
Upper Palaeozoic rocks flanking this Silurian projection on either
side are coarse conglomerates and breccias, followed by alternations

of other forms of sedimentary rocks and contemporaneous traps
(felsites, melaphyres, &c.). Huge masses of coarse dark-red
breccia-conglomerate are here and there to be seen lying loose on
the Silurian rocks near the boundary between the two formations.
In following up the Avon River to its sources near Mount
Hump and Mount Wellington, I obtained a tolerably plain
descending sequence of layers from the lepidodendron beds through
various thick and thin bedded conglomerates, sandstones, and
shales, down to conglomerates (containing boulders of mela-
phyre) under which lie bedded felsites and melaphyres, finally
underlaid by coarse grey conglomerate resting against the
Silurian. (Rig- 19.)
Of the igneous rocks associated with the Upper Palaeozoic
sedimentary beds in the valley of the Avon, some are clearly
contemporaneous whilst others may be intrusive. The examina-
tion made has been of too cursory a nature to enable reliable con-
clusions to be arrived at.
In their lithological character they are most interesting. Those
that are unmistakably contemporaneous are principally melaphyres, „
exhibiting various degrees of alteration, due to natural chemical
action. (Fig. 20.)

In some of them the basaltic character is still recognisable,,
while in others the original structure is quite obliterated. They
evidently represent the results of the volcanic activity of the
period. Besides melaphyres there are quartz-porphyries, felsites,
&c., of various kinds. The summit of the western bluff of the
Mount Wellington Range is composed of fine quartz felsite; and.
specimens of serpentine and diallage rock have been brought from
the country lying to the north. The results of microscopic
examinations made of some of these rocks, by Mr. Howitt, will be
found in the Geological Progress Report No. Y., page 144 and:
following.


Northward from the Mount Wellington Range, in the country-
watered by the Macalister, and its branches, the Barkly and
Wellington Rivers, none of the igneous layers have been observed
in situ, and the rolled fragments all appear to have come from the
Wellington Range. Conglomerates, also, are of rarer occurrence
and finer in character than in the Avon valley.
The prevailing forms are brown micaceous sandstones, purple
rubhly shales, some bands of hard grey gritty shales and flao-s
and a few fine conglomerate bands.
A general south-easterly dip at a loav angle is observable in
the Avon, and in various places in the Macalister valley; but there

are numerous local exceptions.
The most abnormal dips as re-
gards direction and rate of incline
noted by me are in the Macalister
near Glencairn, where there are
red rubbly mudstones and shales
on coarse yellowish-brown sand-
stones, dipping in one place S. 60 s
M . at 38°, and in another, a short
distance away, S. 73° W. at 41°.
The dip obtained furthest north was in the Barkly River
close to the western line of contact of the Upper Palmozoic
with the Silurian. The former consist here of hard gritty
flags overlaid by sandstones and red rubbly shales dipping S E
at B°. (Fig. 21.)
At the Crinoline, a very conspicuous hill about 4,500 feet in
elevation, between the Macalister and the Wellington, the rocks
are nearly horizontal, and the outcrops of the harder beds on either
side of the hill form a succession of cliffs, with steep grassy slopes
between, which give the hill the appearance to which it owes its
name. (Fig. 22.)
Fig. 22. —“ The Crinoline.”
From Glencairn.
From the summit of this hill the same appearances are visible
in the ranges on either side of the Macalister and Wellington as
far as the eye can discern ; cliffs and buttresses of the harder
rock-bands forming nearly horizontal broken contour lines round
the spurs of the mountains. The general appearance of the


mountains and the character of the detritus in the river beds indicate
that the upper Paheozoic rocks of the Macalister extend up to
and over the Main Divide whence the various sources of the river
take their rise, and are connected with the Upper Palaeozoic area
of Mansfield, between the Delatite and Broken Rivers. This,
however, cannot be proved without proper examination of the
country being made.
The general character of the more mountainous portion of the
Upper Palaeozoic area is very rugged. The rivers and creeks
frequently flow between perpendicular cliffs and through deep
rocky ravines, while many of the ridges and high points exhibit
very precipitous sides and craggy bluffs. The ranges and slopes
in the Avon valley are fairly clothed with large timber, and the
hollows support a tolerably dense scrub. The soil is, however, as
a rule, poor and gritty, though in localities where the melaphyre
bands crop out there are very small areas of a tolerably rich soil,
resulting from their decomposition.
The ranges in the Macalister valley are open and grassy, steep,
and sometimes precipitous, and for the most part thinly covered
with inferior timber. On the high lands the vegetation assumes
a sub-alpine character, and is composed chiefly of stunted scrub,
heath, snow-grass, mosses, and various herbs.
The Upper Palaeozoic area of Mansfield is beautifully park-
like in character, well grassed, and thinly timbered with fair-sized
redgums. The eminences, such as. Mount Tabletop and others,
have a tabular appearance, due to the almost horizontal and alter-
nating character of the rock layers, the harder of which project
in shelf-like contours round the slopes. The prevailing forms are
hard, gritty, thickly-bedded sandstone; hard, gritty flags, dense
brownish fine-grained argillaceous sandstones, and mudstones, or
“ cornstones,” similar to those of the Avon.
This tract is partly hemmed in on the south-west, north-west,
and north-east by lofty Silurian and Granite Ranges, through
which gaps have been eroded by the streams flowing into the
Delatite on the western, and the Broken River on the north-eastern,
side of the valley. To the south-east the country rises, and
becomes very broken and mountainous; Mount Buffer, one of the
highest points, attaining an altitude of 5,800 feet. This part has
not been properly geologically examined, but it is evident from
the boulders and pebbles of felsite, quartz-porphyry, greenstone,
syenite, &c., in the beds of the rivers that contemporaneous, and,
probably also intrusive, trappean rocks are associated with the
sedimentary Upper Palceozoic strata near the sources of the
Jamieson, Howqua, Delatite, and Broken Rivers.
From the horizontally-bedded appearance of the rocks of a
great bluff, visible at a distance far up the valley of the Howqua,
I felt justified in assuming, and so indicating on the Geological

Sketch-map, the extension of the Upper Palaeozoic rocks up to
the Main Divide, and their continuity with those of the Macalister
country.
On the ranges between the Jamieson and the Howqua, and
between the Howqua and the Delatite Rivers, are huge masses
of red breccia-conglomerate resting on the Silurian rocks, near the
boundary of the Upper Palmozoic, in the same manner as in the
Avon country.
The general resemblance to one another of the rocks in various
localities throughout the eastern Upper Paheozoic area justifies
the general provisional reference of the whole series to the Upper
Devonian period, which the Iguana Creek beds serve to identify.
At Mount Tambo, on the Main Divide, occurs a large outlier,
of Upper Palteozoic rocks, resembling, in general lithological
character, the Avon Sandstones, and containing, according to
Mr. Selwyn, similar plant-impressions.
Mr. A. W. Howitt’s map, and his accompanying essay on the
Devonian rocks of North Gippsland, supply the following infor-
mation as to the character and mode of occurrence of this outlier.
The foundation on which the Mount Tambo beds rest is granite
on the south, Upper Plutonic quartz-porphyries, &c., on the
south-east and west, and metamorphic crystalline schists on the
north-east. A small vestige of the Middle Devonian limestones
of the Bindi group also passes under the Mount Tambo beds, at
the south-eastern margin of the latter.
Ascending Mount Tambo from the north-eastern side, the
first layer of the Upper Palaeozoic series, resting on the meta-
morphic rocks, is a coarse conglomerate, without any sign of strati-
fication, and composed of rounded fragments of quartzite, quartz,
and indurated slates, with a few boulders and pebbles of siliceous
quartz-conglomerate.
This conglomerate bed becomes finer upwards, and passes into
a coarse reddish-yellow grit with sub-angular fragments of quartz
and indurated slate, overlaid by a bed of about 50 feet in thickness
of rubbly brick-red or purplish rock, showing little sign of strati-
fication. On this are sandstones, about 40 feet thick, followed by
about 120 feet of coarse to fine conglomerate ; then a second bed
of red rubbly rock overlaid by coarse conglomerate, forming the
summit of the mountain. The total thickness of these beds is
nearly 1,500 feet, and their dip is south-westerly at from 37° to
45°. Following the descending ridge south-westerly in the direc-
tion of the dip, the last-mentioned conglomerate is followed by
yellowish sandstone and sandy shales, with a covering of con-
glomerate. (Fig. 23.)
A gradual change commences from here ; the beds become finer
and more argillaceous ; the dip becomes more vertical, and is finally
reversed to the opposite direction, when it gradually becomes more


horizontal. The beds resting against the granite on the south side
are flinty shales dipping north-easterly, and slightly metamor-
phosed by silicification. The Mount Tambo beds thus form the
remaining vestige of a synclinal fold of Upper Palaeozoic rocks
resting in a trough or hollow of the Lower Palaeozoic sedimentary
and igneous rock foundation.
Mr. Howitt also mentions the occurrence of outlying masses of
the coarse breccia-conglomerates of this series resting on older
rocks in various localities eastward of the Tambo, on the slopes of
the Cobberas, and other localities ; also a patch of nearly horizon-
tally-bedded rocks, resembling those of Iguana Creek, in a deep
valley at the sources of the Bern River eastward of the Snowy
River.
On the Wild Duck Creek, between Sandhurst and Heathcote, is
a patch of conglomerate resting in a basin on Silurian rocks. The
age of this conglomerate, whether Upper Palasozoic or Mesozoic,
has not been determined, but Mr. Selwyn describes the character
and arrangement of the materials as being suggestive of a marine
glacial action, i.e., that the fragments composing the conglomerates
were conveyed from distant sources by icebergs. Other small
patches of similar conglomerate occur in various localities.


CHAPTER VI.
Conjectures as to Geological History in Palceozoic times.
Lower Palceozoic formations. Snowy River Porphyries.
Middle Devonian Rocks. Upper Palceozoic beds.
Having so far generally described the stratigraphical relations
and lithological character of the great Palaeozoic or primary
group, which constitutes the rock foundation of Victoria, it may
be well to venture, as suggestions for discussion, some conjectures
as to the history and nature of the geological chauges which took
place up to the close of the Upper Palaeozoic era. The chain of
evidence is of a rather broken character, and many of the theories
advanced may be refuted when further testimony shall have been
obtained. Certain data are nevertheless available, which, though
imperfect, consist, as far as they extend, of ascertained facts.
The reasoning on these facts may be incorrect, and the theories
advanced may ultimately prove untenable, but their consideration
can do no harm, as the discovery and rectification of mistakes
form important factors in the progress of scientific knowledge,
and the advancement by any person of an incorrect theory, based 9
on a few facts, may often lead to the acquirement of sounder
knowledge, by inciting inquiry for rebutting evidence in the shape
of further facts and more exhaustive reasoning on the part of
others.
The general deductions as to the geographical history of this
country do not differ, except in minor details, from the conclusions
arrived at as to that of other parts of the world.
In the first place, we see that our oldest rocks, the Silurian
strata, must have been deposited in horizontal layers to a thick-
ness, as generally estimated, of about 30,000 feet. Great as this
thickness appears, it is no more in proportion to the earth’s bulk
than a thickness of stout paper around a globe of 16 inches in
diameter. The general character of the Silurian rocks suggests
that they were deposited in deep water in such broad depressions
of the earth’s crust as then existed. Their component materials
were derived from the wearing away by water of still older
igneous, and perhaps also sedimentary, rocks, all vestiges of which
in situ have been obliterated. As shown in a previous chapter, it
is very improbable that the foundation on which they were depo-
sited consisted of granite such as we now see underlying them, the
present form of that rock being clearly the result of subsequent
deep-seated Plutonic action. Assuming as correct the theory that
the earth was once molten or red-hot, and that it was only after


it had sufficiently cooled that water could rest upon its surface, it
is easy to conceive that there would be a vast quantity of loose
incoherent material, volcanic dust, ash, &c., which would at once
be taken up and temporarily held in suspension by the water when
the. latter first settled on the earth. Add to this the heated con-
dition of that water the natural chemical and mechanical operations
which must have ensued, and the length of time they continued in
action, and the formation of so (comparatively) thin a layer—
resulting from the re-distribution of pre-existing matter —as the
total thickness of all the sedimentary Palaeozoic formations of
the earth’s present crust would amount to, is easily accounted
for.
Recent researches have shown that in deep seas, even at the
present day, there are frequently vast “mud clouds,” the deposit
of which on the bottom is exceedingly slow, and it may well be
imagined that the water which first enveloped this earth may have
for a time been able to hold in suspension the materials of all the
sedimentary rocks now visible. The probable greater bulk of the
earth, and the larger amount of water on its surface, has already
been alluded to.
Consequent on the diminution of the earth’s bulk through
contraction in cooling, the next processes were the folding and
corrugation of the layers which had been deposited, their meta-
morphism, and invasion or partial absorption by molten igneous
matter.
There is no reason to believe that these movements, as regards
the Lower Palaeozoic strata, took place simultaneously all over the
earth, or that they were of a sudden character; they may, for
instance, have commenced during the Lower Silurian period, and
have been in gradual progress during the actual deposit of the
Upper Silurian rocks. The action of regional metamorphism may
also be regarded as having taken enormous lapses of time to
accomplish its effects, and so also the consolidation of the molten
masses into the forms of granite, porphyry, &c., was no doubt the
work of incalculable ages. Neither was the Plutonic action, of
which these rocks are the results, confined to one period, for as
already shown there is evidence of its occurrence at distinct
intervals. It was from the folding and squeezing together of the
Lower Palaeozoic rocks that the first rude geographical distribution
of land and water surfaces properly resulted. The broader anti-
clinal and synclinal undulations formed respectively the elevated
land surfaces and the depressions occupied by the sea. This
period witnessed the elevation of the general axial line of the
Australian Cordillera, not as we now see it, in the form of a narrow
but well-defined and tortuous ridge, but as a broad elevated
broken plateau, having no defined water-shed line, but forming a
continuous land surface from Tasmania to New Guinea.


With the appearance of land surfaces commenced littoral and
terrestrial denudation ; the uptilted edges of the rock-bands were
abraded and worn down ; their entire removal in places caused the
first appearances of granite at the surface ; and the formation of
new rocks began to take place in the sea beds.
The next great geological development, as far as Victoria is con-
cerned, appears to have been the appearance of the great chain of
terrestrial volcanoes, which, as shown by Mr. A. W. Howitt, marked
the Lower Devonian period in this country, and the ejected lava
and ashes of which, though in an altered form, as well as the sites
of eruption, are recognisable in the belt of igneous rocks known as
the Snowy River porphyries. As already stated, the evidence
obtained by Mr. Howitt indicates purely terrestrial conditions as
having accompanied the development of this group, and it may in
consequence be inferred that the land was more elevated above sea-
level then than it is now, as the terrestrially-formed felsitic ash
beds of the Snowy River group can be traced to within a very
slight vertical height above the existing sea-level. That the
mountains attained a far greater altitude than now and have been
subsequently worn away is evident, if such points as the Cobberas,
6,000 feet high, be but the denuded stumps of the ancient volcanic
cones. This volcanic chain probably resembled, on a smaller scale,
that now in action in the Andes of South America. Its position
is worthy of notice, as it includes portion of the present Cordillera,
and extends southward from where the latter now diverges sud-
denly to the west at Forest Hill directly in the line of prolongation
of the general course of the Cordillera through New South Wales
from Mount Kosciusko to Forest Hill, and the general bearing of
the chain from Forest Hill to the mouth of the Snowy would, if
produced, run through Tasmania. Whether the crest of the land-
surface which once connected Australia with Tasmania was on
this line or further to the westward is a matter of speculation, but
it does not appear unlikely that the igneous belt extended to Tas-
mania, either as a wholly terrestrial or partially marine chain of
volcanoes. If the former, the connexion as a land surface was
probably severed by denudation early in Middle Devonian times.
It would be interesting to ascertain whether, in the older igneous
rocks of Tasmania, the same evidences are observable as those
which justify the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Howitt as to the
origin of the Snowy River belt of porphyries.
The development of this group must have been the work of an
immense lapse of time, and it is very likely that, during that
period, none of the existing area of Victorian land surface was
under water, so that there was no contemporaneous marine deposit
in process of formation within that area, but rather a removal of
material by the action of littoral, fluviatile, and very likely,
terrestrial glacial denudation, and the erosion of deep troughs and


channels in the Silurian and granitic rocks. The general principle
may here be stated, that in past geological times as now, wherever
a land surface rose above the sea, the action of denudation was
constantly removing material from such surface to the sea, where,
according to circumstances, it was re-distributed in fresh forms.
Briefly stated, emergence above the sea implies loss ; submergence,
accumulation. The close of the Lower Devonian period appears
to have been marked by a general submergence of the land surface,
naturally accompanied by encroaching littoral denudation, and the
erosion of bays and inlets, but without immediate cessation of the
volcanic activity which had been at work for so long, as evidenced
by the igneous character of the earlier aqueously-arranged Middle
Devonian beds of Buchan. Finally, the volcanic fires appear to
have become extinct, axid the land to have been depressed to a
great depth beneath the ocean, in the bed of which the limestone
deposits then accumulated in the deeper hollows in the older rocks;
and while the limestones were in progress in some places, beds of
a different character—the shales, slates, quartzites, &c., of Tabber-
abbera—were being laid down in another. Further contraction of
the earth’s bulk and other influences caused the uplifting, folding,
compression, and partial metamorphism of these new layers,
whose basset edges were, in their turn, subjected to abrasion, and
partly denuded simultaneously with the still further denudation
of the Silurian rocks. These Middle Devonian formations have
only been identified in the eastern portion of the colony, and in the
central portions, or on the southern and eastern slopes of the great
Lower Paheozoic mass. Any rocks of this age that may have
been deposited on the western, north-western, and south-western
slopes have been totally removed by denudation, or, if any vestiges
do remain, they are concealed by newer formations.
The striking stratigraphical unconformity between the Middle
and Upper Devonian rocks has been already noticed ; the former
are sometimes nearly vertical, while the latter are, in many places,
seen to rest almost horizontally on their upturned edges. This
seems to-indicate an emergence of the land, and a long continuance
of terrestrial and littoral denuding action on the Middle Devonian
and older rocks, subsequent to their plication and partial metamor-
phism, and prior to the commencement of the beds of the Upper
Palaeozoic group, in which are included the Upper Devonian rocks.
It has been shown how the rocks of the Upper Palaeozoic divi-
sion are most extensively developed in two great groups—one that
of the Grampian sandstones in the western portion of the colony,
and the other comprising the belt extending from Iguana Creek
to Mansfield, in the central eastern district. In his work, pub-
lished in 1866, Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn indicates the probability that
these two masses are respectively the western and eastern rem-
nants of a great anticlinal arch of Upper Palaeozoic rocks which


once overspread the whole of the intervening central portion of
Victoria, but of which all but the two extremities have been since
removed. In support of his views, Mr. Selwyn refers to the wes-
terly inclination of the Grampian sandstone beds, with their abrupt
east-facing precipices on the one side, and the west-facing preci-
pices of Timber Top, Mount Wellington, and Ben Cruachan on
the other, and he also cites the occurrence of isolated patches of
Upper Palaeozoic rocks in the intervening country. At the time
this was written, little was known of the geology of the eastern
Upper Palaeozoic belt, and the aspect, at a distance, of such hills
as Ben Cruachan and Mount Wellington favoured Mr. Selwyn’s
belief. The results of subsequent investigations, however, justify
a considerable modification of the views expressed by Mr. Selwyn
in 1866. The facts as regards the modes of occurrence of the
Upper Palaeozoic rocks are briefly as follows : —l. The Grampian
sandstones or western group flank and decline from the western
slopes of the great central Lower Palaeozoic mass; their original
margin of contact with the latter has been cut through by denu-
dation, and their eastern portion, wherever it may have once ex-
tended to, has been removed ; their lithological character and the
dip of their beds has favoured the development of the precipitous
character of their eastern faces.
2. The eastern group occupy a long and deep trough, hollowed
back far into the central mass of Lower Palaeozoic rocks, Avhich
form steep margins on all sides but that towards the coast.
3. The outlier at Mount Tambo occurs similarly, though its
containing hollow is at a greater elevation than that of the
last-mentioned group, and has been cut off at either end by
denudation.
4. With respect to intervening patches, that at Wild Duck
Creek is at a very low elevation above the sea, and I do not know
of a single instance where a capping of Upper Palaeozoic rocks
has been met with on any of the higher mountainous country be-
tween Mount Wellington, in Gippsland, and Mount William, in
the Grampians. The few conglomerate patches which do occur
are at elevations considerably under 2,000 feet, and appear more
nearly related to the Mesozoic rocks, which will be hereafter
described, than to the Upper Palaeozoic.
There can be no doubt whatever that during the Upper Palaeo-
zoic epoch the country was submerged below the sea to a depth
not less than 5,000 feet lower than it is now, and that previous
to such submergence terrestrial and littoral denudation had eroded
in the Granite, Silurian, Lower Devonian, and Middle Devonian
rocks, the troughs and hollows which were afterwards filled by
the Upper Palaeozoic beds. At the same time there is no reason
to infer that the entire central rock mass was submerged.


Considering that the materials constituting the Upper Paleo-
zoic sedimentary deposits must have been derived from the waste
of a land surface, and that that land surface was evidently,
especially in the case of the eastern group, at no great distance,
it appears far more iikely that the mountain masses in the central
and eastern parts of the colony, between the heads of the
Macalister and Mount Ararat, between Snowy Bluff and Mount
Tambo, and eastward from Mount Tambo, were very much
higher than now, and projected above the ocean, by whose waters
the Upper Palaeozoic layers were deposited in the open sea or in
the deep inlets thereof.
I do not, therefore, believe that the present Main Divide in its
central portion, between the head of the Macalister and the
meridian of Melbourne, was ever covered by the Upper Palaeozoic
rocks, but it is nevertheless most likely that they flanked the
southern slopes of the mountain mass, and overspread the entire
area from the Grampians round to near Wilson’s Promontory.
Possibly Australia and Tasmania were then separated by the
ocean, and the Upper Palaeozoic layers overlaid Wilson’s Pro-
montory and the South Gippsland country, and thus formed a
continuous flanking deposit from the Grampians to the Macalister,
but I am nevertheless inclined to believe that a great elevated
ridge of granite and Silurian rocks still existed, either above
water or only slightly submerged, extending from the Main
Divide approximately on the direct course of the Southern Spur’,
from Mount Baw Baw to Wilson’s Promontory, and thence to
Tasmania. This ridge may have been already somewhat lowered
by denudation in the region now occupied by the South Gippsland
Ranges, and over that portion, if anywhere, flowed the waters of
any strait that may then have separated Australia from Tasmania.
Whatever their geological relation, and that is very close, if not
identical, the Grampian sandstones and the rocks of the eastern
area are geographically distinct groups, and show very clear
evidence of a difference in the conditions of their modes of deposit.
The fine to moderately coarse arenaceous character of the
Grampian sandstones, the scarcity of conglomerate bands, and the
well water-worn character and comparatively small size of the
pebbles, where they do occur, coupled with the geographical rela-
tions of their beds to the older rock masses, all tend to indicate
that they were deposited at some distance from the coast line of
the period in a wide open sea, which then covered a vast area to
the north, south, and west. They were deposited against the
western, southern, and, possibly, also the northern, flanks of the
great central Lower Palaeozoic mountain mass, which had not
been then so much denuded as Ave now see it, and which projected
above the ocean of the period. The eastern edges of the Gram-
pian beds, Avhich rested immediately against the older rocks, and


■which would naturally have included the layers of a more con-
glomeratic character, have been entirely removed. If the patch
at Wild Duck Creek, near Heathcote, is correctly classed as
Upper Palceozoic—of which there is some doubt —deposits of that
age must have flanked the northern slopes of the older rocks, and
overlaid a large portion of the area now occupied by the Murray
tertiaries.
The rocks of the eastern Upper Palceozoic area show evidence
of different conditions in their deposit from those observable in
the Grampian Sandstones.
Taken as a whole, the belt of rocks from Iguana Creek to
Mansfield occupies a deep trough, or long indentation in the older
rocks, which constitute its margins on the west, north, and east.
The head of the indentation appears to be represented by the Mans-
field valley, and if so the Main Divide of the Upper Palceozoic
period was further north than the present one, and probably
in the position now occupied by the Strathbogie Ranges. This
will be further referred to during description of the Tertiary forma-
tions. The deposit of the Upper Palceozoic rocks in this district
was restricted latterly within comparatively narrow limits ; the
proximity of the land surface on either side is evidenced by the
coarse breccia-conglomerates along the edges, and the character of
the plant impressions discovered in some of the beds. While they
were being laid down, the boundary Silurian and granite rocks,
which formed the laud surface, evidently reached a very much
greater elevation than at present, aud projected above the sea.
There would also appear to have been two distinct volcanic
districts now represented by the most elevated parts of the Upper
Palaeozoic belt —one in the country lying between the Jamieson
and King Rivers, north of the Main Divide, and another on the
south, between the heads of the Wonnangatta and the lower part
of the Macalister, as the upper portion of the latter river appears
to contain in its bed no rolled fragments of igneous rock that have
come from the direction of the Main Divide, nor do such rocks
appear in situ far to the north of the Wellington Range in the
Macalister drainage-area.
The general geological appearances suggest the idea that, at the
commencement of the Upper Devonian period, a deep fiord or
sound, between very lofty and, precipitous mountain ranges, ex-
tended inland from the Southern Ocean to what are now the
southern bases of the Strathbogie Ranges ; the axial line of the
western range was approximately from the Strathbogie Ranges to
Wilson’s Promontory, and that of the eastern from the Strath-
bogie Ranges to between Bairnsdale and the Snowy River.
The tongue of the Upper Pakeozoic rocks, formed by the ex-
tension of the Iguana Creek beds in the Mitchell valley up to
Tabberabbera, seems to represent a minor inlet on one side of
where the great fiord debouched on the open ocean.


The land was in process of submergence, and materials washed
from the sides of the fiord, by terrestrial and littoral denuding
action, were deposited and arranged in its bed ; this arrangement
was probably aided by tidal action, which would exert a powerful
influence in such narrow confines.
During such deposit volcanic activity, which had been quiescent
during the latter part of the Middle Devonian period, again broke
forth and produced the contemporaneous igneous sheets. With
the sinking of the land this filling up process, by aqueous deposit
and lava-flows, was continued to the extent of several thousand
feet, and by the time it was accomplished the mountains of the
land surface on either side had been greatly reduced in height by
denudation, though they still rose above the ocean. The denuda-
tion to which both Lower and Upper Palasozoic rocks have been
subjected since the formation of the latter is incalculable, and has
exerted the most remarkable effect in obliterating from extensive
tracts every vestige of the Upper Palaeozoic rocks which once
overspread them.
The Mount Tambo outlier is apparently a portion of the de-
posits distributed in another fiord similar to that last described,
and separated from it by a mountainous land surface.
It is not to be supposed that the height of over 4,000 feet, to
which we nowfind the Upper Palaeozoic rocks in Victoria, represents
the level to which they accumulated for any considerable distance
away from the shore-line of their period. The thickest deposits
were evidently accumulated at no very great distance from the
land surface, whence their component materials were derived, and
the beds sloped away or thinned out seaward in every direction
from the flanks of the older rock foundation on which they were
deposited.
The beds generally have been comparatively very little affected
by upheaval or lateral compression, and in many cases their slope
appears to be that at which they were originally laid down. A
certain amount of uplifting and compression has certainly taken
place, but to an insignificant extent compared with what the older
rocks have been subjected to.

Mesozoic Rocks —Relations between Upper Palceozoic and
Mesozoic Rocks of Victoria with rocks of New South
Wales. The Bacchus Marsh Sandstones. Mesozoic Rocks
of the Wannon, Cape Otway, Western Port, and South
Gippsland. Coal-seams. Fossils. Conjectures as to
Geological History.
Before proceeding to describe the Mesozoic rocks it is necessary
to consider what geological changes took place previous to their
formation, and subsequent to that of the Upper Devonian.
With the exception of those beds of the Avon Sandstones which
contain Lepidodendron, and which have been shown to be very
slightly, if at all, removed from Upper Devonian, no rocks have
yet been found in Victoria that exhibit any kinship to the true
Carboniferous rocks. No fossils have been found in the Grampian
Sandstones, and it is possible they may be the equivalents of the
New South Wales Carboniferous rocks ; as before stated, they have
been provisionally classed, on stratigraphical evidence, under the
general term of Upper Palaeozoic, along with the Avon Sand-
stones and the Iguana Creek Upper Devonian beds. The geological
position of the New South Wales coal measures, whether Paleozoic
or Mesozoic, was for a long time a disputed question amongst
geologists, but the weight of evidence is now almost entirely in
favour of their being classed with the true Carboniferous (Upper
Palseozoic) series.
Their equivalents have not been identified as surface rocks any-
where in Victoria, and if they occur at all (still assuming the
Grampian Sandstones as older than they), it must be beneath the
Mesozoic or Tertiary deposits.
There appears to be a general consensus of opinion that the New
South Wales Carboniferous rocks, whose beds contain the charac-
teristic fossil plant-impression Glossopteris Browniana, are younger
than the so-called Upper Palaeozoic, and older than the Mesozoic
rocks of Victoria, whatever differences of opinion may exist as
to the precise geological position of either of the three groups.
Sir R. Daintree; in his work on the Geology of Queensland,
points out that the rocks of the Northern Carboniferous (Palaeo-
zoic) area there contain Glossopteris (which is there, in his opinion,
without doubt a purely Palaeozoic form), but no Toiniopteris,
whereas in the Mesozoic coal measures of Victoria, Richmond
River, in New South Wales, and the southern coal-field of Queens-
land, Tceniopteris is abundant, but no Glossopteris has ever been
found.


Mr. Charles Wilkinson, Government Geologist of New South
Wales, informs me that Glossopteris is found in beds lying between
layers which contain distinct Carboniferous (Palaeozoic) fossils,
and has kindly furnished me with the subjoined table, showing
the approximate relations of the New South Wales and Victorian
Mesozoic and Palaeozoic rocks. As Mr. Wilkinson’s classification
is based upon long practical experience in both colonies, it is
probably the most correct that can be ai’rived at.

Equivalents of the New South Wales Carboniferous rocks may

every trace of them as surface rocks has since been removed.
The only areas which they can possibly underlie are —Ist. The
broad strip of Mesozoic and Tertiary tracts in south-western
Gippsland, from the Mitchell River to Western Port, between
the coast line and the boundary of the Palaeozoic rocks. 2nd.
Portion of the district, consisting of Mesozoic and Tertiary or
Volcanic tracts, between Port Phillip and the Glenelg. 3rd. The

Whether they do underlie these areas or not does not alter the
fact that between the completion of the Upper Devonian forma-
tions (the Avon Sandstones, Iguana Creek and Mount Tambo
beds), and the commencement of the Mesozoic beds of South
Gippsland, Cape Otway, and the Wanuon, a vast interval of time
elapsed, during which the Carboniferous rocks of New South
Wales were being formed. If rocks of the latter group were
deposited in Victoria during that period, a further space of time
was occupied in subsequently removing them ; but if such strata
were not laid down in Victoria, it can only be assumed that the
period during which they were being formed in New South Wales
was occupied solely in the denudation and removal of previously
formed rocks in Victoria.
Whatever may have been the nature of the changes which took
place in the interval, it is very evident that there is a great
stratigraphical break between the Upper Paheozoic and Mesozoic
rocks of Victoria.
Mesozoic Rocks.
The Bacchus Marsh Sandstones.
In Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn’s work of 1866, the Bacchus Marsh
and Grampian Sandstones are classed as Upper Palasozoic, though
the opinion is expressed that they may be younger than the Upper
Palaeozoic rocks of the eastern district.
The Bacchus Marsh Sandstones, however, yield fossil plants,
which Professor McCoy regards as of a Triassic or Lower
Mesozoic type, and I feel justified in separating them from the
Avon River and Iguana Creek beds of Gippsland, the fossil flora
of which has an Upper Palaeozoic aspect. At the same time, the
characteristic fossil plants of the Bacchus Marsh group have not
been found in the rock-s of the other Victorian Mesozoic areas,
nor have the fossils common in the latter been found in the
former, and on this account the Bacchus Marsh beds are classed
separately from those of Western Port and Cape Otway. The
Bacchus Marsh Sandstones occur between the W'erribee and Ler-
derderg Rivers, a short distance above their confluence at Bacchus
Marsh, and extend in disconnected areas, much covered by vol-
canic layers, up the Werribee valley, as far as Greendale and
Ballan. They consist principally of coarse to fine whitish and
yellowish brown sandstones of variable degrees of hardness ;
the lower beds of the series, resting on the Silurian, in many
places consist of conglomerates. Outliers of conglomerate also
occur capping spurs on either slope of the Silurian range
separating the Lerderderg and Werribee Rivers. At Darley,
a few miles up the Lerderderg from Bacchus Marsh, is a coarse
unstratified conglomerate, consisting of a soft, earthy base, which


contains, amongst other fragments, sub-angular pieces of granite'
of a different character to any occurring in situ in the district.
I remember to have heard the late Sir R. Daintree say that these
fragments resembled no granite he was acquainted with occurring
as a rock mass nearer than Queensland.
The general appearance of the conglomerates, and the character
and mode of arrangement of their materials, are suggestive of
transport by marine glacial action, though, as remarked by Mr.
Selwyn, grooved or ice-scratched pebbles have not been observed.
In this respect the Darley conglomerates resemble those at Wild
Duck Creek, provisionally referred to as Upper Palaeozoic. It is
quite possible that the latter may be of Mesozoic age, as the
absence of clear Palaeontological evidence renders it impossible to
arbitrarily fix their position. Patches of similar coarse con-
glomerates with yellow sandstones are shown on the geological
maps as occurring on the Coliban River,near Kynetou, and between
Kyneton and Heathcote, -where the Silurian rocks are thinly
capped by a conglomerate, containing pebbles of quartz, quartzite,
hard sandstone, granite, and porphyry.’
The fossil plants found in the Bacchus Marsh Sandstones have
been figured and described by Professor McCoy in Decade No.
11. of his Prodromus of Victorian Paleontology/ They comprise
three forms of fossil ferns, namely, Gangamopteris angustifolia
(McCoy), G. spatulata (McCoy), and G. obliqua (McCoy).
These Gangamopteri are referred to by Professor McCoy as being
associated with the Glossopteris Browniana of the New South
Wales coal-fields, and, as indicating the relationship of the
rocks in which they are found, to the “ Talchir ” beds of the
Indian coal-fields. From what has been further ascertained,
however, it appears that Glossopteris is found in New South
Wales in two sets of beds, between which are intercalated marine
beds, containing fossils of distinctly Carboniferous (Palmozoic)
aspect.
Mesozoic Carbonaceous Rocks of (1) the Wannon, (2) Cape
Otway , and (3) TVestern Port and South Gippsland districts.
The areas occupied by Mesozoic rocks have been generally de-
scribed in a previous chapter ; but as it is desirable to indicate as
nearly as possible the known limits of the surface exposures of
these rocks, and also the areas covered by newer deposits which
they may reasonably be supposed to underlie, a more detailed
description of boundaries is here given for each of the three great
Mesozoic areas.
The Mesozoic rocks of the Wannon make their appearance
from beneath overlying Tertiary and Volcanic layers in the
Wannon River, between Hamilton and Coleraine, and are visible
thence westward as far as the Glenelg River, beyond which they


disappear under the tertiaries. They extend only a short distance
northward from the Wannon, as at Coleraine they are seen to he
bounded on the north by the trap rocks, and a short distance
north of Casterton by the Metamorphic schists. Southward
they are visible as far as Digby, but their actual extent
south and south-west is unknown on account of their being over-
lapped by the wide-spreading Tertiary and Volcanic layers which
constitute so large a portion of the surface area of the western
district. Even in the tract where they are near the surface,
the Mesozoic rocks of the Wannon district are so covered
by thin Tertiary cappings and deep soil that few observations
can be made as to their character or the inclination of their
beds.
Soft earthy sandstones, from greenish brown or drab to yellowish
white, and earthy or gritty shales, appear to be the prevailing forms.
Imperfect plant-impressions are numerous in many of the bands,
and some distinctly recognisable forms have been obtained. Seams
of somewhat impure coal occur in the measures at Coleraine.
This portion of the country consists of beautiful open downs of
great fertility, and affording rich pasturage.
The area occupied by exposed Mesozoic rocks in the Cape
Otway district is bounded on the south-west and south-east by the
coast line from near the mouth of the Gfellibrand River to between
Loutit Bay and Barwon Heads, and oh the inland side by the
flanking Tertiary deposits from the mouth of the Gellibrand to a
few miles south from Colac, and thence round to the coast. The
Mesozoic rocks of the Barrahool Hills, near Geelong, form portion
of, hut are separated as surface rocks by, overlying tertiaries from
those of the Otway Ranges.
Like the Mesozoic rocks of the Wannon, those of the Cape
Otway Ranges and Barrahool Hills consist principally of sand-
stones and shales with occasional coarse gritty beds composed of
granitic detritus and fine conglomerates containing pebbles of
granite, syenite, porphyry, metamorphic slate, and micha schist.
At the Barrahool Hills the conglomerate beds contain pebbles of
the underlying diallage rock in the vicinity, and Mr. C. S.
Wilkinson also found in them pebbles of Silurian slate containing
well-preserved graptolites. The colour of the sandstorms varies
from nearly white to dark greenish-grey or yellowish-brown ; the
texture is generally soft and earthy, though sometimes hard
durable sandstones are met with.
Throughout the whole series plant-impressions and very thin
irregular seams of coal are common.
The dip is very inconstant, and the rocks are much faulted and
unevenly bedded. Large and small nodules or indurated lumps,
sometimes calcareous and sometimes ferruginous, are common in the
sandstone. Distinct lines .of stratification are often discernible


in these nodules, and they appear to be indurations resulting from
natural chemical action rather than rolled fragments. On cliff
faces they stand out from the weathered containing sandstone,
presenting the appearance of a number of half-embedded cannon
balls. (Fig. 24.)

It is highly probable that the rocks of the Wannon and of the
Cape Otway district are continuous beneath the intervening Tertiary
and Volcanic tract, and also that the Mesozoic rocks extend for a
long distance inland beneath the volcanic plains from Colac towards
Skipton. Throughout the district cappings of Tertiary sand and
gravel overlie these rocks at various elevations up to 900 or 1,000
feet, both on the fall towards the coast and on the slope inland
from the eastern and western extensions of the Mount Sabine
Range which form the divide of the Otway district between the
coast on the south, and the Barwon and Gellibrand Rivers on the
north-east and north-west respectively.
The soil of the Cape Otway Mesozoic area is very rich, and
supports a dense vegetation of large timber and various scrubs.
The country is, however, very broken and intersected by a net-
work of creeks and gullies, with steep ranges between.
From a little to the west of the Gellibrand mouth to Loutit Bay
the sea shore is rock-bound, except at Apollo Bay and a few
smaller indentations. Very fine specimens of rugged and varied


coast scenery are afforded by the perpendicular cliffs, frequently
over 300 feet in height, with the shelving rocks and broken masses
at their bases lashed by the “rollers” of the Southern Ocean
which here burst ceaselessly upon them. (Fig. 25.)

The Castle Rock exposes a section of coarse-grained yellowish-grey Mesozoic sandstone,
upwards of 400 feet in thickness. Dip of beds, E. s°, S. 26°.
The Mesozoic rocks underlie the tertiaries between Geelong and
Queenscliff, as several outcrops of the former are visible, and there
is very little doubt that they extend beneath the southern part of
Port Phillip, a small portion of their edge being visible on the
eastern shore of the bay near the foot of Mount Martha.
The ridge formed by the granite and the Silurian rocks extend-
ing from Berwick down between Port Phillip Bay and Western
Port, though cut down and covered in places by low-lying tertiaries,
probably separates the Mesozoic rocks of the Geelong and Cape
Otway area from those of Western Port and South Gippsland.
The beds of the two areas are probably continuous with one another
beneath the sea, and may possibly be united by a narrow neck
beneath the tertiaries of the Carrum and Koo-wee-rup Swamps.


That these rocks do not extend to the north-east shore of Port
Phillip is evident from the outcrops of the Silurian rocks at and
around Melbourne, and on the St. Kilda beach at Kenny’s baths,
but it is possible that a tongue of Mesozoic rocks, extending in the
direction of Bacchus Marsh, may underlie the great volcanic plains
between Williamstown and Station Peak.

consists of granite, while on the opposite eastern or mainland side
the Mesozoic rocks appear in full development at Griffith’s Point.
The eastern passage of Western Port Bay thus forms the extreme
western limit of this group of rocks at the coast line. From Griffith’s
Point eastward they form cliffs along the greater part of the coast
line as far as Anderson’s Inlet, where recent sandy and alluvial
deposits cover their line of contact with the Silurian rocks of Cape
Liptrap. A line from between Anderson’s Inlet and Cape Liptrap
over to the nprth of Foster,
at the head of Corner Inlet,
would indicate very nearly
the boundary between the
Silurian rocks on the south
and the Mesozoic on the
north. The former dis-
appear altogether a short
distance east from Foster,
while the latter have been
proved to a considerable
depth below sea-level in
bores put down at various
places between Foster and
Port Albert. From Corner
Inlet north - eastward to
Tom’s Cap, the Mesozoic
rocks constitute the pre-
vailing rock-formation of
the ranges which slope
towards the level Tertiary
country bordering the
coast.

River, extending up from Western Port to the low saddle of the
southern spur near Drouin, and thence the valley of the Moe
Swamp, down to the junction of the Morwell and La Trobe


Rivers, form the boundary between the Silurian on the north and
the Mesozoic rocks on the south. The actual line of contact is
completely hidden so far by great accumulations of Tertiary
sedimentary and volcanic layers, which occupy the valleys and
flank the slopes on either side. From the junction of the Morwell
and La Trobe Rivers, for a distance of about 10 miles easterly
the Mesozoic rocks, in the form of a broad patch resting against
the slopes of the Silurian rocks, extend back for several miles on
the north of the La Trobe valley, and of their northern line of
contact with the Silurian rock good sections are visible in the
dyeis River and Rintoul’s Creek. (Figs. 26 and 27.)

Upper Silurian. Mesozoic conglomerate. Sandstones and shales. Coal-seam.
The widespread Tertiary and Post-Tertiary deposits of the
La Trobe valley, and those continuous thence round the eastern and
'southern terminal slopes of the Mesozoic tract which lies between
the La Trobe and the coast, effectually conceal the eastern limits
of the Mesozoic rocks and their line of contact with the Upper
Palaeozoic rocks of the Macalister, or any formations that may
intervene between the two groups. The south-western extension
of the Mesozoic rocks visible between Western Port and Ander-
son’s Inlet and the south-eastern extension of those eastward
from Corner Inlet pass under the sea, but to what distance cannot
be determined.
Except a small outcrop of Silurian rocks at Turton’s Creek, 10
miles north of Corner Inlet, the entire area within the above-
described boundaries consists of Mesozoic rocks more or less over-
laid and flanked up to elevations of about 1,000 feet by Tertiary
sedimentary deposits and volcanic rocks.
The Western Port and South Gippsland Ranges are similar in
physical character and vegetation to those of the Cape Otway
district. Their highest elevations, Mount Fatigue—and some
points of the Strzlecki Range—slightly exceed 2,000 feet above
the sea.
The rocks of Griffith’s Point, Kilcunda, and Cape Patterson
resemble those of the Otway district. The same descriptions of
sandstone and shale occur in the eastern and western Mesozoic


areas. At Griffith’s Point there are layers of coarse and fine con-
glomerate composed of granite detritus, pebbles of quartz,
quartzite, &c., and soft earthy breccia-conglomerates made up of
water-worn and angular fragments of somewhat hard greenish
mudstone. Some of the sandstones between Griffith’s Point and

Kilcunda afford durable building stones, hut, as a rule, the rocks
are of a soft felspathic character, much jointed and faulted,
the faults being frequently accompanied by basalt dykes, not
observed in the Cape Otway country. (Fig. 28.) False bedding
and frequent variations of dip and “ rolls ” in the strata are also
noticeable.
North of the La Trobe valley, along the Tyers River, and in
Rintoul’s Creek, fine sections occur, showing the contact of the
Mesozoic with the Silurian rocks. The lowest beds of the former
are coarse thickly-bedded ferruginous and siliceous conglomerates
of quartz, quartzite, hard sandstone pebbles or boulders, and sand,
derived from the denudation of the Silurian rocks, and, in some
places, 100 feet in thickness. These conglomerates become finer in
character towards the south, and are overlaid by thick-bedded sand-
stones, followed by alternating sandstones and shales, which, in
different varieties of colour, texture, and hardness, constitute the
prevailing rocks of the series, as developed north of the La Trobe
and in the South Gippsland Ranges, to the south of that river. The
bedding in these tracts is more regular than in the Cape Patterson


or Cape Otway districts, and the dip is nearly constant in a general
south-easterly direction at an angle of from 7° to 25°. (Figs. 29, 30,

Only two species of fossil fauna have yet been discovered in.
the Victorian Mesozoic rocks, viz., Unio Dacombi (McCoy),
found in the rocks of the Wannon, and Unio Murrayi (McCoy)'
discovered in a piece of sandstone from near Loutit Bay. Both
of these are fresh-water molluscs. Fossil plant-impressions are
very numerous, but only a few distinct species have yet been
identified. These are figured and described in Decades No. I.
and No. 11. of Professor McCoy’s Prodromus of Victorian
1 almontology, and are as follows:— Zamites {Podozamites')
Barklyi (McCoy); Zamites ( Podozamites ) ellipticus (McCoy);
Zamites longifolius (McCoy) ; Pceniopteris Daintreei (McCoy) ;
and Pecopteris Australis (Mor.) — P. Scarburgensis (Bean MSS.).
These are all characteristically of Mesozoic aspect. The three
Zamites and the Pecopteris are regarded as indicating the Oolitic
period of the Mesozoic epoch as that to which the Victorian
Carbonaceous rocks are most nearly referable. Pecopteris, asso-
ciated with these in Victoria, has also been found in New South
Wales and Tasmania associated with Glossopteris Browniana,
common in the coal-bearing rocks of those colonies but so far
unknown in Victoria.
This has been regarded by eminent authority as evidence in
favour of the Mesozoic age of the New South Wales coal-measures ;
but there is, nevertheless, very strong evidence in support of the
belief that the Victorian carbonaceous rocks form a younger group
of the Mesozoic series than do the coal-measures of New South
Wales, even if the latter are Mesozoic. The Palaeontological
evidence so far shows that Pecopteris is found associated with
both Glossopteris and Pceniopteris Daintreei, but that the two last-
named have never been found together, indicating that Glossopteris
had become extinct before Pceniopteris Daintreei came into exist-
ence, but that Pecopteris outlived the former and flourished con-
temporaneously with the latter. The late Sir R. Daintree, in his
work on the Geology of Queensland, lays considerable stress on
the non-association there of Glossopteris and Pceniopteris Daintreei,
the former of which he considers to be indicative of the Palaeozoic,
and the latter of the Mesozoic age of the rocks in which they are
respectively found.
It is very likely that of the numerous species of Mesozoic flora
some may have disappeared early in the epoch, while others
associated with them continued to flourish through its later periods.
The knowledge of how very superficial has been the search made
for fossils among the Mesozoic rocks of Victoria tends to guard
against too hasty assumptions as to the isolations of the Ganga-
mopteris beds of Bacchus Marsh to those containing Pceniopteris,
Pecopteris, &c., of the Wannon, Cape Otway, Western Port, and
South Gippsland ; or the relation of the whole Victorian Mesozoic
series to the Carboniferous rocks of New South Wales. There
is not a shadow of a doubt, however, but that the Mesozoic
rocks of the Wannon and Cape Otway, Western Port, and South


Gxppsland are all of the same geological age, and were formed
contemporaneously under very similar conditions, and that between
them and the rocks classed as Upper Palaeozoic of North Gipps-
land and the Grampians there is a great stratigraphical break,
representing an era of which we have no visible record whatever
in the shape of rock-formations. This period seems to have been
occupied, as regards the area of the present land surface of
Victoria, in the work of denudation. After the completion of the
Upper Palaeozoic beds, which, as before pointed out, appear to
have been formed during long-continued gradual submergence, an
opposite movement set in, and the land rose again to as great a
height above the sea as it had been previous to the commencement
of the Upper Palaeozoic layers.
This upward movement of the Victorian land may not have
extended to the central eastern portion of Australia, and, if so, we
may conjecture that, during the period of emergence here, the
northern portions of New South Wales may have continued
or even still sinking. This would imply continued
accumulation there but denudation here, and would account for
the absence in Victoria, between the two series classed respectively
as Upper Palaeozoic and Mesozoic, of any formations that can
with certainty be referred to the age of the New South Wales
coal-measures
The only alternative surmise is, that rocks analogous to the last-
mentioned were once deposited in Victoria, and were afterwards
removed ; but I am more inclined to the belief that while the accu-
mulation of the coal-measures was in progress in New South Wales
the Victorian land was simply undergoing denudation. It cannot
be said that representatives of the New South Wales coal-
measures may not underlie portions of our Mesozoic areas, but so
far as can be determined from the evidence of natural sections at
their margins, the Mesozoic rocks rest directly on Lower
Palaeozoic or older igneous rocks, and whatever intermediate
formations may exist must lie concealed beneath the Mesozoic
rocks in the deeper portions of the basins occupied by them.
Under any circumstances, there must have elapsed, after the
close of the Upper Palaeozoic period, and prior to the commence-
ment of our Mesozoic formations, a long period during which
denuding agencies were busy, and effected great changes on the
then rising land surface of the country. When this rising move-
ment had reached its greatest extent the land surface was more
elevated than now above the sea. The central mountain mass
was still of far greater altitude than now above the contour of the
present shore line, as it had not at that time lost the material of
which it has been since denuded during Mesozoic and Tertiary
times, and, notwithstanding the degradation experienced during
the Upper Palaeozoic period, still retained an Alpine character,
being then very probably many hundreds, if not thousands of feet
higher than at the present day.


With re-submergence the deposit of the Mesozoic rocks
commenced and continued during long ages of gradual depres-
sion, till a flanking deposit had been formed skirting the main
mountain system, from the Wannon to Port Phillip, and from
Western Port to the Macalister, to a height not less than
2,500 feet above the present sea-level. This does not neces-
sarily imply that every hill or spur of older rocks now under
that altitude*was then covered. The slopes of the main mountain
system were then less denuded than they are now, and a contour
line at 2,500 feet above that of the present shore line would have
been far nearer to the latter, measuring horizontally, than it is now..
The Silurian rocks and granite of Cape Liptrap and Wilson's
Promontory indicate the approximate position of part of the
southern margin of the eastern portion of the Mesozoic basin, but
it would be impossible without more accurate knowledge of the
geology of Tasmania and of the islands in Bass’ Straits to form a
conjecture as to the boundaries on the south-east, and south-west.
There is nothing to show what formations were deposited on the
north of the Main Divide during the Mesozoic period, unless the
conglomerates of the Wild Duck Creek belong thereto. Any
extensive deposits that may have existed have been removed, unless'
some remain concealed beneath the Tertiaries bordering the Murray.
The conditions under which the Mesozoic rocks were deposited
do not appear to have been altogether marine, but rather fresh
water or brackish, merging into marine. The conglomerates, at
the edges of the Mesozoic areas, speak plainly as to the vicinity
of the land surface of the period to the localities where we now
find them. The character of the fossil flora and of the few fossil
fauna yet found tell the same tale. We may regard the Mesozoic
rocks as deposits—in previously eroded basins —of sand, silt, mud,
&c., brought down from the land surface and arranged by shallow
waters, whose currents were fluctuating both in direction and
power. The land was in process of slow submergence, and, as it
sank, the material derived from its waste continued to be arranged
by marine or lacustrine action in layers of varying thickness j
sometimes evenly, sometimes unevenly bedded, forming ever-thick-
ening accumulations around the land-margin, near to which larger
fragments brought down from the land were rolled and arranged
by littoral action in the form of conglomerates.
Intervals occurred during which the conditions were favorable
to the accumulation in swamps and low-lying shallow basins of
growing or drifted vegetation, subsequently covered by further
layers of sand and silt, and altered to the form of coal.
These processes went on until the submergence had attained its
limits, and the land began to rise again. From this period com-
menced a denudation of the beds which had been deposited, and
the erosion in them, and in older rocks, of new and deeper hollows
or channels, which were destined in their turn to be again partly
filled by the accumulations of the Tertiary epoch.

Tertiary.
Formations of Tertiary age are very extensively developed in
Victoria, occupying nearly one-half the area of the colony ; they
are geologically divisible with tolerable certainty into three prin-
cipal groups, viz., Lower Tertiary (Oligocene), Middle Tertiary
(Miocene), and Upper Tertiary (Pliocene).
Lower Tertiary (Oligocene).
The Victorian Lower Tertiary beds, which the term Oligocene
has been employed to designate, really belong to the uppermost
portion of the Lower Tertiary group, and appear to occupy an
intermediate position between the Eocene and Miocene. Of the
Eocene, or Lower Tertiary strata of European and American
geology, there appear to be no equivalents exposed in Victoria
whatever may be concealed beneath newer formations, and the beds
classed as Oligocene are here the oldest known members of the
Tertiary series. They are exposed close to the sea-coast in a few
localities of very limited extent, of which the best known are as
follows: —Portion of the coast between the mouth of the Gelli-
brand River and Port Campbell; on the coast to the west, and also
about a mile inland on the east side of the Aire River a few
miles north-west from Cape Otway ; in a few places in the Geelong
district, and on the east coast of Port Phillip, near Mount Eliza
and Mount Martha.
These beds are exposed inland, near the junction of the Grange-
burn and Muddy Creeks, a few miles west from Hamilton ; also, I
understand, near Violet Town, to the north of the Main Divide j
and undoubtedly underlie large areas in the western and northern
districts. Lithologically, they consist principally of blue or grey
clays, sometimes stiff and tenacious, sometimes sandy, with patches
composed almost entirely of more or less fragmentary shells,
loosely held together by sandy clay. Calcareous septarian nodules
are common on the east coast of Port Phillip, in Oligocene clays,
which Mr. Selwyn describes as closely resembling the Eocene
strata of the Hampshire and London basins. In all places where
the beds are exposed, they are rich in fossils, among which are
some gigantic forms of Volutes and Cyprcea (cowry). Ihe forms


figured and described by Professor McCoy in bis Prodromus are as
follow : Voluta. Hannafordi (McCoy), V. anti-scalaris (McCoy),
V. strophodon (McCoy), Cyprcea ( Aricia ) gigas (McCoy), C.
gasfroplax (McCoy), C. eximia (Sow.), C. ( Trivia ) avella-
noides McCoy), C. platypyga (McCoy), C. ( Luponia ) lep-
torhyncha (McCoy), C. ( Aricia ) consobrina (McCoy), C.
(Luponia) contusa (McCoy), Limopsis aurita (Brocchi sp.),
(L. Belcheri (Ad. and Reeve sp.). Pectunculus laticostatus
(Qnoy and G-aimard), Aturia zic-zac (Sow. sp.), var. Australis
(McCoy), Cucullcea Corioensis (McCoy), Pecten Yahlensis
(Woods), var. semi-lcevis (McCoy), Waldheimia macropora
i(McCoy), Spondylus pseudo-radula (McCoy), &c.
Some of these fossils, or closely-allied species, are not confined
to the Oligocene, but are found also in the Miocene, and even in
the Pliocene beds.
Middle Tertiary (Miocene).
Formations of this age are extensively developed in Victoria.
They comprise deposits due to marine, lacustrine, and fluviatile
agencies, and also the rocks of igneous origin, classed as Older
Volcanic, which appear to be the youngest of the group, and to
form the division between beds of Middle Tertiary or Miocene,
and those of Upper Tertiary or Pliocene age.
In proportion to the actual extent of the tracts underlaid by
them, the Miocene strata, of marine origin, appear as the surface
formation of but very small areas, and are only exposed on the
sea coast, or on the slopes towards rivers and creeks, where the
newer overlying formations have been cut through and denuded ;
but their presence has been proved by bores and shafts, beneath
great tracts of which the surface formations are Upper Tertiary
or Newer Volcanic.
Rocks of Miocene age form the cliffs along the sea-coast, from
the Glenelg to the Gellibrand River, with the exception of a few
breaks between Portland and Warrnambool, where overlying
newer formations, occupying depressions in the Miocene beds, are
found at the sea-level. The coast scenery between the Gellibrand
and Warrnambool is of a most picturesque character. The cliffs
are about 200 feet in height, generally perpendicular, and jut out
into frequent headlands. (Fig- 32.)
The encroaching action of littoral denudation is well exemplified
by the number of islets standing at short distances out at sea.
These are of the same height and composed of the same rock-
bands as the main cliffs, and are evidently portions which have
been left unremoved during the denudation of the mass.
Miocene strata occupy a small area on either side of the Aire
River, north-west from Cape Otway. Eastward from Loutit Bay
they are again found, forming the cliffs along the coast.

The rocks consist of whitish and yellowish-brown sandy calca-
reous layers, sandy ferruginous layers, yellowish sandy limestones,
coralline limestones; composed almost entirely of fragmentary
shells and polyzoa, and calcareous clays. Near the mouth of the
Gellibrand is a bed of conglomerate resting ppon and composed of
rolled fragments of the Oligocene clays which occur there. There
are also some black clay beds, containing leaf impressions, east of
the Gellibrand, near where the Miocene beds thin out on the
Mesozoic rocks. Similar clays occur westward of the Aire River,
near Cape Otway, and at Point Addis. The cliffs on the coast
near Spring Creek, south from Geelong, have been described in a
report and geological map of that district by the late Sir R,
Daintree. The thickness exposed is about 300 feet, of which the
upper portion, of about 100 feet, consists chiefly of yellow sandy
limestone, composed principally of polyzoa and fragments of
echini spines. The principal characteristic fossils of these upper
beds are Cellepora Gambierensis, Spatangus Forbesi, and Terebra-
tula Compta. Next in descending order come about 150 feet of
yellow and brown sandy clays, containing a prevalence of bivalve
shells, principally Pectunculus laticostatus and pectens. Below
these are Oligocene beds, containing principally univalve shells.
Some of the limestones are very hard and compact, and blocks
may be obtained near Geelong and at Maude, on the Moorabool,
showing, when polished, handsome shell markings.
Near Melbourne, the Miocene beds, passing under the Older
Yolcanic rocks, consist of white clays, containing leaf impressions.

There is no doubt that they underlie the greater portion of the
western plains. At Mount Mary, an extinct Newer Yolcanic crater,
near the Werribee, ejected blocks of rock containing Miocene
fossils occur among the volcanic ash and other materials oi which
the hill is composed, showing that the Miocene beds underlie the


plains between Melbourne and Station Peak. They also occur
along the Murray, and have recently been proved, during boring

Many of our widespread ferruginous gravels and conglomerates

during that period. It may, however, be taken as an established
fact that no marine Miocene strata have been yet found in this
colony at an elevation exceeding 700 feet above the level of the
sea. It has been remarked that no marine Miocene beds are to

The Miocene beds apparently due to lacustrine action consist
chiefly of clays and lignites, filling basins in older rocks. Such a


basin exists at Morrison’s diggings on the Moorabool, near Mere-
dith, where, in some places, the Miocene deposit forms a “ false
bottom,” on which rest auriferous gravels of Pliocene age. The
extent of this basin is not well known, but its outlet to the sea
was unmistakably about where the township of Meredith now
stands. The great lignite deposit at Lai Lai is possibly of this
age, and there is no doubt as to the lignites of McKirley’s Creek
and the Tarwin in Gippsland being so, because they are overlaid
by Older Volcanic rocks. (Figs. 35 and 36.)
Ferruginous beds, containing fossil leaves, occur near Bacchus
Marsh, and beneath the basalt of the Dargo High Plains. In
many localities throughout the country are exceedingly hard
quartzites, which appear to be fine siliceous silt, or possibly

infusorial earth, cemented and indurated by siliceous infiltrations.
They often pass into siliceous conglomerates, containing well-
rounded quartz pebbles, which occasionally show signs of partial
blending with the siliceous matrix. Hydrothermal action has been
suggested as a probable cause in the production of these quartzites,
and it is readily conceivable that the percolation by heated waters
or steam, of fine sand and gravel or infusorial earth, would result
in the development of such rocks as the quartzites referred to.
Wherever the relative positions have been observed, these


quartzites have been found to be clearly antecedent to the Older
Volcanic rocks, and apparently synchronous with the marine
Miocene beds, and have on that account been classified as of
Miocene age.
The Miocene formations due to fluviatile action are principally
developed in Gippsland, where there are deposits of sand, gravel,
and conglomerate capped by older basalt occurring in isolated
patches, evidently once connected deposits, but now separated
from one another by the more deeply eroded river-valleys of the

prisca, has been obtained in auriferous gravels of Miocene age
beneath Older Volcanic layers at Hoddle’s Creek, Upper Yarra.
Older Volcanic Rocks.
The different Volcanic rocks of the Tertiary period are so
associated with the sedimentary layers that, in order to convey a
clear idea of their relations, it is advisable to describe them in
their order of sequence with the latter, instead of in a special
chapter by themselves.
The Older Volcanic rocks are the latest products, and mark dis-
tinctly the close, of the Middle Tertiary or Miocene era. There
do occur, occasionally, thin volcanic layers, interstratified with the
Miocene sedimentary beds, showing that vulcanicity was not
altogether dormant during the formation of the latter, but the
greatest volcanic activity evidently took place at the close of the
period. Where undecomposed, the Older Volcanic basalts are
usually dark, dense, and solid, of a polygonally jointed and some-
times distinctly columnar structure, and composed chiefly of
augite, labradorite, olivine, and specular iron. They are, however
as a rule, either wholly or partly decomposed. In the former
condition, they consist of red, yellow, purple, brown, and nearly
white amygdaloidal clays, containing hard lumps of less de-
composed rock showing concentric structure ; in the partly de-
composed state the rock exhibits in sections the appearance of a
conglomerate of such concentric masses in a clay matrix.
In every locality throughout the colony where the Older Volcanic
rocks are at the surface the soil immediately resting on or derived
from them is of great fertility and of exceptional value for agri-
culture. In the Neerim, Brandy Creek, and other districts in
Gippslaud, the natural vegetation growing on such soil is of a
most luxuriant sub-tropical character, forming a serious impedi-
ment to the labours of the selectors, who, during late years, have
eagerly taken up every available acre of such land.
The sources whence the Older Volcanic lava streams issued have
not yet been distinctly recognised; no well-marked points of erup-
tion such as are common in the Newer Volcanic districts have been
observed, and it would appear that the original volcanic cones
have been entirely removed by subsequent denudation, so that it
would only be in what are now narrow or small pipe-shaped dykes,
easily passed over unobserved, and probably far distant from where
the Older Volcanic rocks remain in considerable area, that we
might look for the vents whence the flows were poured forth. The
original extent covered by Older Volcanic rocks was once very


much, greater than now. -The areas we now see occupied by
them are for the most part disconnected vestiges of what were
once long, continuous, and frequently also widespread sheets,
which have been cut into and through by subsequent denuding
agencies, so that, in many places, the Older Volcanic rocks, which,
at the time they were poured forth as lavas, flowed down and
partly filled in the valleys of the period, are now the cappings of
ranges, owing to the erosion of still deeper valleys on either side.
Enough still remains to enable some conjectures to be formed as to
the areas once occupied by the Older Volcanic rocks ; the conclu-
arrived at will, however, be better understood after the
existing Older Volcanic areas have been described, and will, there-
fore, be included in the general sketch history of the Tertiary
period given in a subsequent chapter.
Older Volcanic rock occurs in patches, filling hollows in Miocene
and other older formations in the neighbourhood of the Moorabool
River, near Maude, and in one place as an intercalated band
between marine Miocene beds ; it also constitutes a considerable
area of the Bellarine district, south of Geelong harbor.
From between Ballan and Blackwood down to near Bacchus
Marsh the Older Volcanic rock occurs in a number of localities,
especially on the Pentland Hills, where some of the uudecomposed
basalt of this age is highly magnetic.
From near Romsey down to Melbourne there are several ex-
posures of this rock in beds and banks of creeks that have cut
their way down to it through newer overlying formations. Near
Flemington is an area consisting of Older Volcanic decomposed
basalt, which may be seen in natural section on the bank of the
Saltwater River, passing under Upper Tertiary ferruginous
deposits, capped with basalt of Newer Volcanic age. From
Hoddle’s Creek, a branch of the Upper Yarra, a series of discon-
nected patches, in some places underlaid by auriferous gravels, are
traceable in the direction of Melbourne, as far as Lilydale. Other
patches occur between the Yarra and the Plenty, near the
Kangaroo Ground. This formation occurs again at Berwick and
Cranbourne, and has been proved, by boring operations, to exist
beneath some 200 feet of Upper Tertiary deposits near Frankston.
Cape Schanck and portion of the country between Western Port
and Port Phillip, also Phillip Island and French Island in
Western Port Bay, consist of Older Volcanic rocks in places unde-
composed, and consisting of hard dark dense basalt. This rock,
more or less decomposed, occupies a strip extending from Griffith’s
Point along the east coast of Western Port Bay, and I believe
this to be portion of and continuous with the French Island and
Phillip Island layers, and to be united beneath the Newer Ter-
tiaries with the Older Volcanic rocks which occupy so extensive a
tract in the Neerim and Buln Buln district.


Large and small strips and patches are found between the
Tanjil and La Trobe Rivers and in various portions of South
Gippsland. A well-defined lead, covered by 200 feet of older
basalt, has been proved to trend, from between Walhalla and
Mount Baw Baw, southward to the level country near Toon-
gabbie. Very extensive sheets of older basalt probably underlie
parts of the low Upper Tertiary country of Gippsland, as it may
be seen sloping from the hilly country, and passing under the
plains at Haunted Hill, Toongabbie, Seaton, Glenmaggie, and also-
at many places on the south side of the La Trobe Valley, The
basalt of the Dargo and Bogong High Plains has been classed as
Older Volcanic, because it immediately overlies sedimentary beds
containing Miocene flora, and its lithological character also justi-
fies this classification. Here we find many hundreds of feet in
thickness of lava, for the most part undecomposed, and often
highly magnetic, showing, in many places, columnar structure in
a marked degree. Portions of the plains where the rock is bare
resemble a pavement of five-sided blocks ; while, on the slopes
below the escarped edges of the plains, acres in extent are covered
with pentagonal columns of basalt like logs confusedly heaped
together.
Similar outliers of basalt, but of-less extent, occur at Connor’s
Plain and Fullarton’s Spring Hill, both points on the Main Divide
between the Gippsland and Murray River basins, also to the
southward at Mount Useful and Mount Lookout, the ranges be-
tween the Aberfeldy and the Thomson, and between the Thomson
and the Tyers Rivers. A very small outlier occurs on the east
slope of Mount Matlock, and other patches are found on the
Southern Spur, between the sources of the Yarra and those of the
La Trobe.
The general evidence obtained from observation of the Older
Volcanic areas points irresistibly to the conclusion that they
are remnants of extensive lava-flows which poured down the
valleys of the Miocene period, partially filling in the basins and
covering the sedimentary deposits in them, and also spreading in
wide layers over the beds of the estuaries and inlets. Subsequent
denudation has cut through and destroyed the continuity of these
lava-flows ; new channels have been excavated to lower levels
than the ancient ones, which they filled, and fresh accumulations
have in many places overspread them.

posits. Fossils. Vegetable , Marine, and Land Animals.

Upper Tertiary.
Under this head are included all aqueous deposits, marine or
fluviatile, and. associated Java-flows, younger than the Older Vol-
canic, and older than the Newest Volcanic rocks, which latter are
taken as the latest products of the Tertiary period ; deposits
newer than they being regarded as Post Tertiary and recent.
On the geological sketch-map all the aqueonsly deposited forma-
tions, newer than Middle Tertiary, are distinguished by one colour,
as Upper and Post Tertiary ; but on the detailed geological maps
are indicated a number of subdivisions into Older Pliocene, Newer
Pliocene, Post Pliocene, and Alluvial.
In some of the maps the reference of deposits to European equiva-
lents has been omitted, and the formations have been classed in
their order of sequence as “oldest” and “older” gold drift,
“ recent ” and “ most recent,” or in progress. In many places the
lines of subdivision are clearly indicated by lava-flows, by the
character of the deposits themselves, and by the physical configura-
tion of the country, but in others no such lines of demarcation
exist. The classification of the deposits is the more difficult on
account of the scarcity of fossils whereby the true positions in the
Newer Tertiary series of any particular beds could be ascertained.
As in the case of the Miocene or Middle Tertiary formations,
avc have, among those of the Upper Tertiary series, beds deposited
by marine agency, and deposits clearly due to fluviatile action.
The marine Upper Tertiary deposits consist principally of fine
and coarse ferruginous sandy beds, in some cases hard, in other
soft and friable, gravels, conglomerates, sands, clays, and mud
shales.
They are found resting on the Older Volcanic, the Miocene,
beds, or the Mesozoic and Palaeozoic rocks, from the coast-line to
the flanks of the mountain systems, and up all the main valleys,
to elevations within 1,000 feet above sea-level ; they also lie on
the low spurs of the northern slopes of the ranges on the fall
towards the Murray. They have been much denuded during Post
Tertiary times, and are, consequently, wanting in many places,
while in others they are covered by newer accumulations or the
Newer Volcanic lava-flows.


A great extent of country near the western boundary of the
colony, along the Grlenelg River, along the coast from the Grlenelg
to Portland, and from Warrnambool to the Gfellibrand, consists of
Upper Tertiary sandy deposits resting on the Miocene beds and
Mesozoic rocks, and passing under the Newer Volcanic rocks at
the edges of the latter. Similar sandy and gravelly deposits in
extensive areas, or large and small outliers, flank on all sides the
Mesozoic ranges of the Cape Otway district, and of Western Port
and South Gippslaud. (Figs. 42 and 43.)

On the northern fall from the Main Divide, and passing under
the Post Tertiary deposits of the plains, are gravels and conglom-
erates, some of which are too widely spread to be due to other
than littoral marine action ; among these are richly auriferous
gravels and conglomerates.
Fresh-water limestones of Pliocene age occur near Geelong,
and in other localities.
The Pliocene deposits due to fluviatile action appear to be
younger than some of those of the same period which are of marine

origin, and to be among the
latest products of the epoch,
though there is no doubt that
the processes to which their for-
mation is immediately due began
very early in, if not previously to,
the Tertiary era. These ancient
river deposits consist of gravels,
conglomerates, sands, and clays,
occupying channels in the older
rocks, and where they are
worked for their associated gold
are known as deep leads. As
followed downwards toAvards
the sea or towards the Murray
Valley, they merge into wide-
spread marine deposits, the mar-
gins of which mark the approxi-
mate position of the sea-board of
the time when the lead channels
were occupied by rivers. The
gravels in these old river-beds
are covered by thicknesses of
from a few to several hundred
feet of newer aqueous deposits,
or layers of Newer Volcanic
rock (basalt).
Where there are two or more
distinct layers of basalt, there
are generally found interbedded
between them deposits of clay,
sand, gravel, and occasionally
lignite of varying thickness.
(Fig. 44.)
The deep leads of Ballarat,
Haddon, and Daylesford are
types of the lava-covered Upper Tertiary fluviatile deposits, while
the leads of Chiltern, Huntly, and Dunolly are instances of those
covered only by newer sedimentary accumulations.


Near Amherst is a deposit (probably lacustrine) of infusorial
earth, seventeen feet in thickness, resting on basalt. It is com-
posed entirely of the siliceous skeletons of microscopic animal-
culm ( Diatomacece ) and is largely used in the manufacture of
dynamite. Further remarks on the Pliocene gravels will be found
in connexion with the subject of auriferous alluvial deposits in
a subsequent chapter.
Among plant remains found in Upper Tertiary deposits are:—
Eucalyptus Pluli (McCoy), and the various species of fossil fruit
figured and described by Baron von Mueller, namely:—Spondy-
lostrobus Smythii, Phymatocaryon Mackayi, Trematocaryon
McLellani , Rhytidotheca Lynchii , Plesiocapparis prison , Cely-
phina McCoyi, Odontocaryon Macgregorii , Conchotheca rotun-
data, Rhytidotheca pleioclinis, Penteune Clarkei, Penteuue
hrachyclinis, Penteune trachyclinis, Dieune pluriovulata, Platy-
coila Sullivani, Phymatocaryon angulare, Conchotheca turgida.
The principal marine Pliocene fossils figured and described
by Professor McCoy are:—Mollusca.— Trigonia acuticostata
(McCoy), Haliotis Ncevosoides (McCoy), Cerithium Fleming-
tonensis (McCoy), Waldheimia macropora (McCoy), Ditrupa
Wormhetensis (McCoy), Lepralia Stawellensis (McCoy), Micula
Marthce (McCoy), Tellina Krausei (McCoy). Mammalia.—Arcto-
cephalus fVilliamsi (McCoy), and Physetodon Bayleyi (McCoy).
Among land animals of Upper Tertiary and Post Tertiary times
are Diprotodon longiceps (McCoy), D. Australis (Owen),
Phascolomys pliocenus (McCoy), Thylacoleo carnifex (Owen),
Macropus Titan (Owen), Procoptodon Goliah (Owen),
Nototherium Sarcophilus ursinus (Harris), Dasyurus affinis
(McCoy), Hypsiprymnus trisulcatus (McCoy), Canis dingo , and
others. Some of these appear to have become extinct at com-
paratively very recent periods, Avhile one, the Canis dingo, or
native dog, is still in existence.
Newer Volcanic.
The basalts, or anamesite and dolerite lavas, familiarly known
as “ bluestone,’’ occur in sheets or strips of varying breadth over-
lying a large extent of the central western portion of Victoria.
The great plains of the western district, from Geelong to Hamil-
ton and from Colac to Ararat, are nearly wholly of volcanic origin,
while most of the ancient river-beds or leads trending north and
south from the Main Divide are more or less filled in and covered
by lava flows which, though often confined between elevated
Silurian ridges near the hilly country, spread out and unite with
the wide sheets that constitute the plains. To the northward of
Ballarat, portion of the Main Divide itself is of volcanic forma-
tion, and a wide sheet extending to the north, and finally disap-
pearing under the Post Tertiary deposits of the Loddon, covers the


system of deep leads of Creswick, Climes, and Daylesford, on
their trend towards the Murray. At Ballarat there are four and
in other places two or three distinct layers of basalt covering the
leads.
The lowest overlie the deepest parts of the gutters, and the next
in succession spread more widely till, as may now be seen, the
uppermost lava-flow forms a wide sheet, covering not only the old
rivers and their tributaries, but also most of the lower ridges of
Silurian rock which separate them.
Throughout all the Newer Volcanic areas are found the points
of eruption whence the lava streams issued, mammaloid or conical
hills in many of ivhich well formed crater-basins still exist, while
in others the crateriform shape is still distinguishable though the
basin has been obliterated. Many of these extinct craters are now
occupied by lakes or lagoons, as Tower Hill, near Warrnambool,
which has an insular peak rising from the centre of the lake ;
Mount Eels, and other crater basins in the Western District, and
Mount Mercer, south from Buniuyong. Mounts Buninyong,
Warrenheip, Pisgah, Franklin, and numerous other volcanic hills
in the Ballarat, Creswick, Daylesford, and other districts, are
familiar instances of points of eruption where the outlines of the
craters are still discernible.
Around nearly all such points are scoriaceous lavas and volcanic
ashes, among which are frequently found ejected masses of older
rocks, from mere dust up to several tons in weight.
For instance, in the volcanic ash of the Anakies, near Geelong,
are found ejected blocks of granite. At Buninyong and Hardie’s
Hill, to the south thereof, are ash beds, composed principally of
large and small fragments of slate and schist. In some places, as
on the Werribee Plains, near Mount Mary, the ash beds present a
stratified appearance, as though their materials had fallen into and
had been arranged by water. It is probable that this may have
been the case, but there is no evidence of any very considerable
submergence since, as, had such taken place, very few, if any, of
the volcanic hills, composed as they are of loose incoherent mate-
rials, would have preserved their form as we now see them. It
is probable, however, as suggested by Mr. Selwyn, that some of
them formed low islands in the Tertiary seas.
Post Tertiary.
The Post Tertiary deposits, or those which have been formed
since the Newer Volcanic lava flows, consist of gravels, clays,
sands, mud, loam, &c., and sometimes form very extensive tracts
of good alluvial soil.
They rest directly on the Palasozoic or the Mesozoic rocks, or
Ou Tertiary beds and volcanic layers, as the case may be.


The surface deposits of the level plains around Sale, in Gipps-
land, and those bordering the Murray River, belong to this class,
and are not nnfrequently to be found almost undistinguishably
blended with those in actual process of formation. The sand dunes
and sand rocks of the isthmus between Corner and Shallow Inlets,
Cape Otway, and other parts of the coast-line, are of Post Ter-
tiary age, some of them being of comparatively ancient and others
of quite recent date or even now in process of formation.

Some of these consolidated sand-rocks show remarkable beddings
due evidently to the fact of their materials having been trans-
ported and arranged by the action of wind. At Warrnambool the
sand-rocks present a regular schistose appearance, with a strong
dip inland, as though they had been uptilted, but in reality due
to their having been formed by winds which blew the sand back
from the coast-line and deposited it in layers sloping at an angle
of about 30° on the inland slopes. (Fig. 45.)
Many of the gold drifts are of Post Tertiary age, and consist of
freshly denuded fragments from the Silurian and other rocks, or
the re-distributed materials of Tertiary gravels and other forma-
tions in their neighbourhood that may have been subjected to
denudation. A few deposits of inferior lignite are associated
with some of the Post Tertiary clays in creek and river flats.

General Concluding Remarks.
In drawing conclusions as to the geological history of this
country during the Tertiary epoch, the first fact to be observed is
the enormous denudation during Upper Mesozoic and Lower
Tertiary times, to which all pre-existing formations must have
been subjected before even the lowest Tertiary deposits found in
Victoria commenced to be laid down. The Mesozoic rocks-
especially appear to have been entirely removed from large areas,
and deef) channels to have been eroded along their lines of junc-
tion with other rocks. The sections obtainable in the Western
Port and South Grippsland districts show this beyond a doubt, as
we find that the great depression connecting Western Port with
the Grippsland Lakes has been eroded along the northern line of
junction of the Silurian and Mesozoic rocks, the former prevailing
on the north, the latter on the south of the valley, though at one
time the Mesozoic rocks must have extended right across, where
the La Trobe and Lang Lang Valleys are now, and flanked to a
considerable height the southern slopes of the Silurian and granite
ranges from Berwick to the Tyers River. On the southern
boundary of the South Gippsland Mesozoic area a channel has
similarly been eroded, where Corner Inlet and Shallow Inlet now
lie, along the line of contact of the Mesozoic rocks with the
Silurian and granite; so that the section across from Wilson’s
Promontory to the north of the La Trobe Valley shows deeply-
excavated channels at either side, separating the ranges composed
of Mesozoic rocks fi’om the granite and Silurian mountains to the
south and north. (Fig. 46.)
In the same way the rocks of the Mesozoic ranges of the Cape
Otway district have been, in a manner, isolated from the older
mountain masses, which they once extended to and flanked..

round to the bases of the Grampians, extending
in inlets up to Bacchus Marsh, Meredith, and
the Leigh River Valley, and overspreading the greater part of
the Western District and the low country bordering the Murray.
During the progress of deposit of the Oligocene clays, and the
Miocene calcareous beds, shell-fish in great variety of species


flourished in the seas, and left their remains to be entombed in the
sediments ; huge sharks and toothed whales lived in the waters;
coral reefs fringed the coasts, and furnished the materials for the
limestones. On the land we can also trace a different set of con-
ditions to those now observable; the crest of the eastern portion
of the Main Divide was further north, and the mountains were
still very much loftier than now, but more in the form of elevated
plateaux, intersected by broad valleys and high ridges, and less
sculptured and abrupt in their configuration than at present.
These conclusions are based on the appearance of the vestiges
which remain of the river deposits of the period, such as the
gravels beneath the basalt of the Dargo High Plains, and other
places along the Main Divide, which unmistakably indicate that
the streams which deposited them had their sources much further
north, and, consequently, that the Main Divide of that period was
further inland than the present one.
It is noticeable that the High Plains forming portion of the
Main Divide, lying between the Dargo and Cobungra Rivers and
Connor*s Plain, between the Macalister and Gfoulburn Rivers, are
now among the highest portions of the Main Divide, yet they
represent portions of what were mountain valleys during the
Middle Tertiary epoch. (Fig. 47.)
The vegetation was then of different character to that now
flourishing in Victoria. Instead of the now prevailing species of
oucalypts, lauraceous trees of various species appear to have pre-
dominated, the fossil leaves of the Dargo High Plains and Bacchus
Marsh being, as described by Professor McCoy, of that class.
Professor McCoy also remarks, with reference to one of the fossil
leaves, Salisburia Murrayi (McCoy), from the Dargo High
Plains, that it is nearly allied to some Miocene forms from the
Arctic regions. Lakes occupied broad hollows along the river
courses, and in them deposits of lignite, clay, sand, and mud were
accumulated. It is impossible to say what part, if any, was
played by terrestrial glacial action during this period, but the width
of the old river deposits, and the character of the materials, indi-
cate large volumes of water as having acted in their transport and
arrangement. This, taken in connexion with the fact that the
mountains from which the rivers rose were very much higher than
those of the present day, justifies the belief that the loftier summits
were capped with snow, and that glaciers existed in the higher
ravines. The absence of ice-grooves in the rocks has been
adduced as an argument against this conjecture; but when it is
considered that the rocks have since been denuded for many
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of feet below what Avas their surface
in those times, and that consequently any ice marks must have been
wholly obliterated, the objection ceases to carry much weight. ''
* Recent observers, Dr. von Lendenfeld and Mr. James Stirling, have
observed what they regard as distinct traces of glacial action among the
higher portions of the Australian Alps.

Tyers Rivers, indicate a river system whose course partly corre-
sponded to that of the Thomson River, but whose sources were'
further north than the present Main Divide. Similar belts of
Older Volcanic rocks, underlaid by gravels, indicate the existence,,
during Miocene times, of rivers rudely corresponding to the-
present Tanjil, La Trobe, and Tarwin Rivers. A succession of
similar patches from Hoddle’s Creek to Melbourne indicates the
ancient course of a river corresponding to the Yarra. (Fig. 48.)
The wider areas of Older Volcanic rock around Neerim,
Brandy Creek, Western Port, BatmaiTs Hill, Emerald Hill, and
North Melbourne, mark where the lava-flows of the period
filled in lakes and estuaries to the depth in places of hundreds
of feet.
It is uncertain to Avhat extent some of these last-mentioned
portions of the Miocene lava-flows which now constitute land
surface may have flowed over what were at that time submerged
areas. That such was the case in many places is evidenced by
the occasional layers of lava found intervening betAveen marine
Miocene deposits. It may be surmised, hoAvever, that any of our
Older Volcanic rocks, within 500 feet of present sea-level, Avere
in all probability spread out under Avater.
Connected Avith the volcanic activity of the period, hydrothermal
action, or the agency of heated waters, probably charged with
siliceous matter, appears to have been busy, and to have influenced!
the transmutation of gravels, sand, clays, infusorial earth, and
other deposits into flinty siliceous rocks and hard conglomerates.
Wherever the Middle Tertiary valleys Avere filled, or partly
filled, with lava, a diversion of the courses of the drainage channels
Avas caused thereby, and, as the work of denudation proceeded in
subsequent ages, new rivers cut their channels to deeper levels
than the former ones, entirely removing some portions of the older
gravels and. their superimposed lavas, and leaving others standing
in the form of eleAmted plateaux and ridges. In many places the
sites Avhere the Miocene streams found their outlet to the sea have
thus been obliterated by the entire removal of the lava, the gravels
beneath it, and also a considerable thickness of the subjacent bed-
rock. Thus, it may uoav be observed, that that portion of the
Southern Spur from Neerim to the loav saddle between the Moe
and Lang Lang Rivers consists of older basalt, which covers
sedimentary deposits, showing that the watershed line of the
Southern Spur was not, during Middle Tertiary times, in the
same position as Ave now see it; and, in fact, it is the rule rather
than the exception, that AAdiere remnants of lava-capped Middle
Tertiary fluviatile deposits are found at any considerable elevations
above sea-level, they form the upper portion of eminences high
above the beds of existing streams. The folloAving extract from
the Avork of Professor Jukes (Manual of Geology, 3rd edition,.


page 620) is interesting as being descriptive of geological pheno-
mena in Britain analogous to those which form a very marked
feature in Victoria ;
“Another and striking piece of evidence ( i.e ., as to the long
continuance of volcanic action during Miocene times among the
Hebrides) is given by the well-known Scur of Eigg. That
island consists of nearly horizontal sheets of basaltic rocks, like
those of Mull, resting unconformably upon oolitic rocks. After
their eruption, they must have been long exposed to the wasting
agencies of the atmosphere. A valley was cut out of them, and
its bottom was watered by a river which brought down shingle
and sand from the distant Cambrian mountains of the north-west.
These changes must have demanded a lengthened lapse of time,
yet they took place during an interval in the volcanic history of
the island. The igneous force which had been long dormant
broke out anew, and poured several successive coulees of vitreous
lava (pitch-stone) down the river-bed. In this way the channel
of the stream came to be sealed up, but the same forces of waste
which had scooped out the channel continued their operations.
The hills which had bounded the valley crumbled away, and the
lava currents that filled the river-bed, being much harder than
the surrounding rock, were enabled in a great measure to resist
the degradation. Hence the singular result now appears that the
former hills have been levelled down into slopes and valleys,
while the ancient valley occupies the highest ground in the neigh-
bourhood, and its lava current stands up as the well-known pre-
cipitous ridge of the Scur of Eigg. The gravel and drift-wood
of the old river-bed are still to be seen under the rocks of the
Scur.”
After the pouring out of the Older Volcanic lava-flows, a
partial submergence appears to have taken place, as we find
marine deposits of the Upper Tertiary or Pliocene period fringing
the country, and often overlying the Older Volcanic rocks up to
elevations of nearly 1,000 feet.
The sandy ferruginous beds of Tom’s Cap, in Gippsland, and
those extending from Melbourne to Frankston, belong to this
class.
This would appear to have been the last important downward
movement of the Victorian land, which seems to have subse-
quently risen gradually with a few minor oscillations to its
present status.
The upper portions of the rivers which formed the deep leads
of the western section of the colony —such as those of Ballarat,.
Daylesford, &c.—of the Upper Tertiary epoch, were probably
flowing contemporaneously with those of the Miocene era, but not
being filled by the Older Volcanic lava-flows, held their course
uninterruptedly to a later date. The mountains in those localities-


were, as elsewhere throughout the colony, loftier than they are
now, and the sea was nearer to their bases. As the land rose
after the last Upper Tertiary submergence, the rivers con-
tinued to erode their courses deeper, cutting through the Older
Pliocene marine deposits deep into the Silurian bed-rock, their
courses lengthening and their rate of decline decreasing as their
sources became lowered by denudation and as the emergence of
the land caused the retreat of the seas into which they emptied
themselves.
The accompanying table, previously published in the Geological
Progress Report No. VI., is subjoined, as conveying some idea of
the operations at work during the Tertiary period in different
parts of the colony :

The Newer Yolcanic lava-streams which poured from so many
points of eruption throughout the western part of the colony
partly or wholly filled up and concealed the rivers of the period,
forming wide strips occupying the valleys from side to side in the
hilly areas, spreading in broad sheets over the lower lands, and
forming the great basaltic plains which constitute so important a
feature in this country.
The occurrence at Ballarat of four distinct layers of basalt,
separated from one another by tolerably thick sedimentary accu-
mulations, shows that a very long period must have elapsed from
the commencement to the close of the newer Yolcanic period.
The basin of the Yarra affords an illustration of the successive
effects of the agencies, both aqueous and volcanic, which were in
operation during the Middle Tertiary and Upper Tertiary periods
respectively.
We have in the remnants of Miocene gravels, covered by
patches of Older Basalt, at Hoddle’s Creek, and from there to
Lillydale, at the Kangaroo G-round, and near the Saltwater River,
the vestiges of a Miocene river system, draining approximately
the same country as that now traversed by the Yarra and its
tributaries, the Plenty and the Saltwater Rivers.
That the mouth of this old river was in the vicinity of Mel-
bourne is shown by the Older Basalt occurring from Emerald Hill
to Flemington, and evidently filling in an estuary of the Middle
Tertiary period, though the connexion of this basalt with the
patches up the Yarra Valley has been severed by subsequent
denuding action. The partial filling up by Older Yolcanic lava-
flows of the river course, and the changes effected by littoral
action during the earlier Upper Tertiary submergence, caused a


fresh channel during later Upper Tertiary times to be eroded
along a different course deeper into the Silurian rocks than the
previous stream. This channel was in its turn partly filled in by
the Newer Volcanic lava-flows along the edges of or through
which the present Yarra in the vicinity of Melbourne now winds.
This basaltic strip lies between the hills of Northcote on the one
side and Kew Asylum on the other, and thence passes by Haw-
thorn and Richmond, between Jolimont and the Treasury gardens,
on the north-east, and the Government House domain on the
south-west. It undoubtedly covers an ancient river bed con-
forming to the Yarra, and holding precisely the same relation to
that river as the main trunk lead of Ballarat and Sebastopol
does to the present Yarrowee River. This lava-flow, though
covered with alluvial deposits below Prince’s-bridge, is no doubt
connected beneath those deposits with the widespread flows of
Footscray and Williamstown.
Thus we have brought into juxtaposition in the Yarra basin
evidences as to the fluviatile and volcanic operations of tbe Mio-
cene period, which are most extensively developed in Gippsland,
and the similar operations of the Pliocene era, of which the-
Ballarat leads are the typical representatives.
Changes with regard to the position of the mouth of the Yarra
have evidently taken place within comparatively recent times. It
is very evident that at one period the course of the river trended
from where Prince’s-bridge now stands, in a direction passing
between the Barracks and Emerald Hill, and over where the
Albert Park lagoon now lies, and that the outlet of the river was
between Emerald Hill and St. Kilda, The erosion of a channel
between Emerald Hill and Batman’s Hill and the junction by
that means of the Yarra with the Saltwater River must have been
effected long subsequent to the outpouring of the Older Volcanic
lava-flows.
It may be noticed that some of the species of fossil-fruit de-
scribed by Baron von Mueller are common to both Miocene and
Pliocene drifts, specimens having been found in the gravels beneath
Older Basalt at Tanjil precisely identical in species with some
obtained from the lead-gravels beneath newer basalt at Haddon.
This tends to show that some of the Miocene types of flora con-
tinued to flourish during Pliocene times.
In some of tbe Upper Tertiary clays of Daylesford, however,
eucalyptus leaves, akin to the present vegetation, are found in a
fossil state, thus showing that at some period during Upper
Tertiary times the pre-existing Miocene flora was superseded by
one of a type similar to that which now flourishes.
Post Tertiary and recent action has developed the existing
physical configuration. The present streams cut their way along
or across the lava-sheets, sometimes adhering approximately to the


old lines of drainage, and sometimes establishing independent
courses. In some places, as near Daylesford, the existing streams
eroded their courses through, and to a deeper level than, the upper
portions of the Tertiary rivers ; in others, as at Ballarat, the latter
are hundreds of feet below the present water-courses. To action
which took place during Post Tertiary times are also due the
surface layers of the great plains of the Murray, Gippsland, and
other low-lying tracts.
The sand rocks of Post Tertiary age along portions of the coast-
line, as at Warrnambool and Cape Otway, are aerial deposits formed
by the action of wind blowing sand into dunes and hillocks which
subsequently consolidated owing to the presence of calcareous
matter derived from the shell fragments associated with them.
These rocks have been partly denuded, and their materials are
now in course of fresh distribution by every wind. In some
places the sand is encroaching on and covering large areas of what
was in my own recollection good pastoral land. The method
of deposit in sloping layers, the variations in direction of the
slopes, the ribbed appearance due to certain winds, and the inter-
mixture of shell fragments, can all be observed, and to such
action we can infallibly refer the origin of the consolidated
beds, to which the operations now in progress present an exact
counterpart.
Though, geologically, the deposits since the newer lava-flows
are of very recent date, the time that has elapsed since volcanic
action entirely ceased must be very great, as may be seen by the
depths to which the present water-courses have cut their way
through layers of hard basalt deep into older rocks, and by the
deposits which have since accumulated in low-lying tracts.
It is interesting to consider the character of the fauna which
flourished in Victoria and Australia generally during Upper, and
even Post Tertiary times. The fossil remains found are those of
animals of genera analogous to those now existing, but of yastly
greater size. The Diprotodon, for instance, is described by Pro-
fessor McCoy as having belonged to the same family as that now
represented by our native bear or sloth; but the size of the bones
found indicate that the animal was about 10 feet in length and 6
feet in height, and was able partly to gnaw and partly to tear down
large-sized trees for the purpose of feeding on the leaves. Various
gigantic representatives of the kangaroo tribe, some of them
approaching 20 feet in height, inhabited the country, and the
marsupial lion, an animal akin to our small carnivores, but equal
in size to an ordinary lion, preyed upon the huge vegetable-eating
denizens of the plains and forests.
The present age is essentially one of denudation as regards the
land surface of Victoria. Yearly, daily, hourly, solid matter is
being carried away from our mountains, and though some of it


finds a temporary resting-place on the low lands, the general effect
is loss of such matter by its being carried away to form fresh
deposits in the ocean bed.
The general conclusions which suggest themselves as to the
Australian Cordillera are that, in Lower and Middle Palaeozoic
times, a continuous land surface, approximating in general direc-
tion to the present mountain system of Australia, extended from
New Guinea to Tasmania; that the portion of the Victorian Main
Divide, from St. Clair to the Grampians, was a great lateral spur
from the Main Chain; that during the Upper Palaeozoic or Lower
Mesozoic periods a strait was eroded to the south of where the
La Trobe and Lang Lang Valleys now lie, thus breaking the con-
tinuity of the land surface between Australia and Tasmania; that
subsequently to the deposit of the Victorian Mesozoic rocks in,
and the filling up thereby of, that strait, a fresh one was eroded
further south, between Corner Inlet and Tasmania; that the pre-
sent irregular and sinuous course of the main water-shed line is due
to the successive denuding agencies which have been at work since
the continent first appeared as a land surface, and that these
forces have from time to time been modified or altered in their
direction by the sedimentary rocks deposited in later times, during
periods of submergence, or by the products of volcanic action at
various epochs.
It would be tedious to attempt to describe all the cases where it
is evident that portions of the crest of the Cordillera were once in
different positions to the present line. Enough instances have
been already noticed in this work to indicate some of the
alterations that have taken place—the incalculable abrasion and
degradation to which the ancient rock foundation and subsequent
formations have been subjected, and the immeasurable lapse of
time that must have been occupied in bringing about the present
configuration of the country.
Difficult as it may be for the human mind to realize, the truth
of the main principles enunciated by the late Sir Charles Lyell,
and in which he has been followed by other eminent geologists, is
strikingly evidenced in the geological phenomena observable in
Victoria, which indicate —that to such slow action as we see now
in progress in this and other parts of the world, varied by periods
of greater or less intensity, changes of climatic conditions, gradual
alternate submergences and risings of the land surface, and other
natural causes, with occasional abnormal or cataclysmic move-
ments all our varied rock-formations and the alterations in the
physical structure of the country’from the remotest geological
epochs to the present day may be confidently ascribed.


CHAPTER XL
Dyke Stones. — Various Geological Ages. \st Group, Non~
auriferous ; auriferous. 2nd Group.
Dykes of igneous rocks showing an infinite variety of mineral
structure and composition intersect the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic
rocks in the form of injected wall-like masses of from a few
inches to hundreds of feet in thickness, and are sometimes
traceable for many miles, either continuously or by disconnected
outcrops in some defined hearing. Some of these dykes are
evidently products of Plutonic action during Palaeozoic times,
while others have been injected since the Mesozoic period, and
there is a marked difference of mineral composition between the
dyke stones of the two periods. The first group comprises
numerous varieties of granite, syenite, quartz-porphyry, felsite-
porphyry (elvanite), gabhro, greenstone, diorite, &c.; while the
second or more recent class consists of rocks of a basaltic
character, anamesite, anamesite-porphyry, basalt, lava, &c.
Ist group. —Intersecting the granite masses throughout the
colony are numerous dykes of very fine-grained granite, binary
or half-granite (aplite), eurite, and occasionally schorlaceoua
granite. Granite, half-granite (aplite), syenite-granite, ternary and
quaternary, granite-porphyry, syenite-granite-porphyry, felspar-
porphyrite,felsite,felsite-porphyry, (elvanite), and quartz-porphyry
in an infinite variety of composition and texture occur as dykes
traversing granite, metamorphic Lower and Upper Silurian rocks.
In different portions of any one dyke considerable diversities of
composition and texture may be found. Detailed descriptions by
Professor Ulrich of typical specimens of these rocks will be found
in the descriptive catalogue of the Industrial and Technological
Museum.
These dykes do not appear to possess other than scientific
interest, not being, as far as has yet been ascertained, in any marked
degree connected with the auriferous character of the quartz-
veins in the rocks which they intersect. According to Professor
Ulrich’s descriptions of the above-named varieties the predominat-
ing felspar in all of them is orthoclase, and though hornblende
occurs sometimes as an accessory mineral, and contributes the
syenitic character, it is not a prevailing ingredient, and frequently
occurs only in certain portions of dykes which elsewhere do not
contain it.


On the other hand, the dykes of diorite and allied rocks are
described by Professor Ulrich among “rocks in which the pre-
dominating felspar is triclinic (plagioclase),” as being “ essentially
compounds of oligoclase and hornblende, occasionally associated
with quartz and mica,” and “also known under the general term,
* Greenstone ’ —Hornblendic Greenstone, in contradistinction to
the Augitic Greenstone (diabase), not yet observed in Victoria.”
These dykes, which will he further referred to in the chapter on
auriferous reefs, &c., constitute marked and highly important
mining features in the great central mass of Upper Silurian
country between the meridian of Melbourne and that of the
Macalister Kiver, as with (hem are associated many of the auri-
ferous quartz veins of that tract of country. They vary from a
few inches to several hundred feet in thickness, and sometimes this
variation takes place suddenly, as in the case of the Morning Star
Dyke, at Wood’s Point, which in one place suddenly expands from
a few feet to nearly 300 feet in width. These dykes run some-
times with and sometimes across the strike of the Silurian rocks;
thus, for instance, in the Walhalla and Wood’s Point district they
run north-westerly with the strike of the Silurian strata, while in
the Alexandra district they have a direction often nearly east and
west at right angles to, or obliquely across, the strike of the
Silurian rocks. They are sometimes found rising in pinnacles or
shoots at intervals along some general course, with only the
track ” of a line of fissure between. Near the surface they are
usually soft and decomposed into a brownish earthy rock; but, as
a general rule, become hard and undecomposed at any considerable
depths. In mineral composition and texture great variations are
frequently observable at short distances apart in the same dyke.
Some are coarsely granular and highly hornblendic, or with
hornblende and felspar distinctly recognisable ; others are almost
structureless (aphanitic), or felstone-like in their character.
Quoting from Professor Ulrich’s notes in the lechnological
Museum Catalogue—“The extensive dyke of Gaffney’s Creek, arid,
in a less degree, the dyke of Cohen’s Reef, are in some parts dis-
tinctly crystalline granular, i.e ., show a granitic texture, with
triclinic felspar and hornblende plainly perceptible, whilst for the
greater part opened they are micro-crystalline granular, apparently
quite dense, light greenish grey —felstone-like—-with neither
hornblende nor felspar recognisable. In fact, if it was not for
the occasional changes in texture and composition just mentioned,
the rock would sooner he taken to he a true felstone than as
belonging to diorite, representing the variety felspathic diorite-
aphanite. A fine illustration of both a textural and mineialogical
change combined is exhibited by the dyke on which the Thomson
River copper mine has been opened. The copper-ore-beaiing pait
is here a coarse granular highly hornblendic diorite in fact,


nearly pure hornblende rocks in places —which forms ‘ shoot-like’
the northern termination of the dyke, whilst southward in strike
it changes within a very short distance through finely granular to
a nearly dense highly felspathic aphanite, closely resembling the
rock of the Cohen’s Reef and Gaffney’s Creek dykes just spoken
of.”
Besides their ordinary constituent minerals these dyke stones are
frequently more or less densely impregnated with copper, iron,
and arsenical pyrites, evidently the products of natural chemical
action subsequent to the injection of the dykes.
All the dykes of the first group comprising the orthoclase and
plagioclase felspar divisions are pretty clearly of Palaeozoic age,
and the portions we now see at the present surface may have been
perhaps thousands of feet below the surface at the time the dykes
were injected, owing to the vast denudation that has subsequently
taken place.
2nd group. —The dykes of the second group are all more or
less of a basaltic character, resembling the Older and Newer
Volcanic basalts. They are found intersecting the Mesozoic rocks
of Bacchus Marsh and Western Port, frequently accompanying
faults in the last-named locality. The “lava-streaks’ of Sandhurst
are simply basalt dykes, the rock of which differs little, if any-
thing, in composition frem the Newer Volcanic basalt of the
plains, except in being generally decomposed to a soft soapy clay.
These dykes are to all appearance of Tertiary age, and do not
appear to be in any way connected with the auriferous character of
the lodes which they intersect. With respect to origin, many of the
dykes of the various classes referred to, especially the non-auri-
ferous of the first group and the lava dykes of the second group,
are clearly of Plutonic origin, i.e., they were injected in a molten
or plastic condition, as evidenced by the alteration of the rocks
which they traverse at the planes of contact; but in the cases of
most of the auriferous dykes examined by me, and notably the
typical one of Cohen’s Reef, at all signs of contact
alteration are absent, the planes of demarcation between the dyke
stones and the containing slates are clearly defined ; and yet there
is no visible sign of alteration in the latter, such as would naturally
have been effected had the dykes been injected in a molten state.
I am led, therefore, to the belief that such dykes were in great
measure the products of hydrothermal action, and that when
injected into the fissures of the Silurian rocks they were rather in
the condition of super-heated mud than of actual fusion ; that
their development was due to mixed mechanical and chemical
action, differing from the distinctly mechanical intrusion of the
molten dyke masses on the one hand, and the chiefly chemical
deposition of mineral vein-stones on the other.


CHAPTER XII.

rocks.—Auriferous belts. Modes of occurrence of Gold.
Other Minerals. Theories as to the formation of Quartz-
veins. Nuggets. Auriferous character of Lodes at great
depths.
Auriferous Quartz-veins.
In the preceding portion of this work no notice has been given
to the auriferous veins, lodes, or reefs of quartz which form so
significant a feature in the geology of the Silurian rocks, and
which now, and will for a long time to come, exercise so impor-
tant a practical hearing on the prosperity of Victoria. Remarks
on this subject have been purposely deferred to the concluding
portion of the w r ork, so as to admit of the discussion of the
auriferous quartz-lodes in their scientific and practical aspect, in
the light of what has already been said on the general geology of
the country. It is unnecessary to describe all the various forms
and combinations in which lodes or veins of quartz occur ; the
principal have been already described in the numerous publications
issued by the Mining Department, and it is enough to say that in
every district, in every line of lode, and in every mine, differences
may be observed, due, no doubt, to local conditions present at the
time the veins were being formed, or to some subsequent move-
ments and displacements of the rocks containing them. In fact,
no two lodes are alike exactly, any more than two trees, though
in general features a certain resemblance to a greater or less
degree is traceable.
A marked difference, however, may be observed in some respects
between the reefs traversing Lower Silurian and those intersecting
Upper Silurian rocks. In the case of the former, the veins
traverse the rocks themselves, and, where dykes of igneous rock
occur, these are usually found—as evidenced by the fact of their
occasionally intersecting the quartz veins—to be of more recent
date than the latter, and though frequently of value as guides to
the miner, they do not appear to have in any way influenced the
auriferous quality of the quartz.
In the Upper Silurian rocks, the auriferous quartz-veins very
frequently are found to traverse, accompany, or intersect from side
to side, dykes of diorite of older date than themselves, and with
the presence of which their auriferous quality appears to be closely
associated.


In the Lower Silurian rocks, the general features are the same
throughout, though each district exhibits special peculiarities.
The lodes or veins of quartz, from the thickness of a knife-blade
to that of scores of feet, traverse the rocks, usually in directions
coinciding with the strike of the uptilted strata, but sometimes
crossing it horizontally, obliquely, or vertically. They exhibit
the same variations as do other mineral lodes, swelling alter-
nately into thick masses and dwindling to mere threads, or
disappearing entirely either in a vertical or horizontal direction,
holding even undisturbed courses for long distances, or broken
and displaced by faults or slides, forming “ saddle reefs,” as in
■the Sandhurst district, and dipping to the north or south in their
lines of strike; or flat reefs, as at Stawell, and holding courses
independent of the strike and cleavage of the containing rocks.
In the Upper Silurian rocks some reefs occur similarly to those
in the Lower Silurian, but they are, as before stated, very fre-
quently associated with diorite dykes, in or Avith which they occur
in every conceivable variety of form—as well-defined lodes,
accompanying the dykes on either wall, or intersecting them in
directions parallel Avith their courses; as vertical to nearly
horizontal veins crossing the dykes from side to side, but not
extending into the Silurian rock, or only to short distances; and
as irregular strings, veins, and bunches.
Throughout both Lower and Upper Silurian areas the aurifer-
ous reefs, whether traversing the rocks themselves or the intrusive
diorite dykes, occur in long belts conforming generally in direction
to the strike of the Silurian strata.
Within each belt are a greater or less number of different lines
of quartz reef, and between the belts are varying widths of country
in Avhich little or no gold can be found, though the rocks are of
the same character, and the quartz reefs as numerous as in the
auriferous areas.
Certain portions of the belts are richer than others, and intervals
or breaks occur along them, where they appear to be uon-aurifer-
ous; but Avhen the different proved auriferous portions are marked
on a map, their occurrence within tolerably well-defined parallels
becomes very noticeable, and affords numerous suggestions for
further exploration in search of both quartz and alluvial gold-
workings.
The auriferous belts are, as far as been proved, narrower,
and further apart, and the lines of quartz reef fewer in number,
and, as a rule, smaller in size, in the Upper than in the Lower
Silurian rocks; but, on the other hand, the average yield of gold
per ton of quartz from the former has hitherto considerably ex-
ceeded that from the latter.
Another circumstance may here be noted, namely, that all the
largest nuggets obtained in alluvial workings have been found
where Lower Silurian rocks prevail. I am not aware of any


nugget greatly exceeding 100 ozs. in weight having been found in
any of the Upper Silurian gold-workings to the east of a line from
Melbourne to Heathcote. Though this remark applies specially
to alluvial workings, it may he also extended to quartz reefs, as
larger masses of native gold have been found in reefs traversing
Lower Silurian rocks than have been discovered in the Upper
Silurian quartz-veins.
The forms in which gold occurs in the reefs are various. It is
sometimes evenly distributed through the stone, hut is more
frequently confined to some particular band, either on the foot or
hanging wall, or, more rarely, in the central portion of the vein or
lode. The auriferous portions of the stone in some places take
the form of irregular disconnected patches, in others well-defined
zones or “shoots” of varying vertical width, which dip at different
angles northward and southward in the direction of the strike of
the reef. The gold itself occurs in tolerably large lumps inter-
mixed with quartz, in strings, ragged pieces, crystals, mossy
aggregations lining cavities, and in fine specks. It is also found
in mechanical combination with iron pyrites, a mineral almost
universally present in greater or less quantity in all quartz lodes,
especially below water-level.
Besides iron pyrites, copper and arsenical pyrites, galena,
antimony, and zinc-blende, are frequent accompaniments of
auriferous lodes, and in many mines one or other of these is
regarded as an infallible indication of the proximity of gold-
bearing stone.
Investigations as to the primal origin of gold would probably
■prove as futile as inquiries into the origin of any other metal or
form of matter, but the question of how gold came to be associated
with quartz in veins or lodes admits of at least a theoretical solu-
tion, and the first stage of the inquiry relates to the origin and
history of the quartz itself.
Without entering into a description of the various different
inodes in which quartz lodes and veins occur, the broad fact can
be stated that they occupy what were lines of fissure in the
Silurian rocks. As to how those fissures were formed in the
rocks a general conjecture can be arrived at. It has been shown
that the Silurian rocks—originally laid down horizontally were
crumpled, folded, and contorted so that their bands finally
assumed positions approaching the vertical, and that, whatever
may have been the cause, the forces operating were such that the
longitudinal axes of the corrugations took in Victoria, for the most
part, an approximately meridional direction. Such movements
could not take place without, in addition to the corrugation, con-
siderable faulting, Assuring, and great local displacements, and the
lines of fracture, naturally following those of least resistance,
coincided in general direction Avith the strike of the schistose
rock-bands.


It is scarcely to be imagined that all the fissures now occupied
by quartz-veins were formed within one short period. No doubt
most of them resulted from movements connected with or closely
following the corrugation of the strata, whether that process was
accomplished quickly or slowly; but with succeeding movements
further fissures and displacements were effected from time to time,
thug rendering the systems of fissures or lines of fracture more and
more complex. The existence in Upper Palseozoic rocks of quartz-
veins traversing conglomerates, which are themselves partly com-
posed of rounded pebbles of vein-quartz, is in itself a clear proof
that the formation of quartz-veins in fissures was not confined to
the Silurian rocks, though it attained its extreme development in
them. At the same time, it would appear that most of the
fissures occupied by quartz-veins in Silurian rocks in Victoria
were formed and occupied by their contents prior to the formation
of the Upper Paheozoic rocks.
With regard to the direction and extent of the fissures, much
depended on the character of the rocks they occurred in. In
evenly-bedded slates the fissures would generally be regular, while
in diorite dykes the shrinkage cracks would naturally be irregular,
though the fissures, if any, along the walls of the dykes would be
influenced, as regards regularity or otherwise, by the character of
the containing rocks. In one case a clean fissure or split between
two parallel rock-bands would be effected. In a second, the fissure,
owing to some conditions in the directions of the operating forces,
or the tenacity of the rock-bands, would follow the planes of
stratification, either horizontally, but not vertically, or would
intersect them obliquely in both directions. In a third instance,
an abnormal displacement would cause a fissure of which one
wall was clean — i.e., the plane surface of a rock-layer—and the
other wall irregular, on account of the plane of the former cross-
ing obliquely the basset edges of the layers in the latter.
Niimerous other cases and combinations might be instanced, but
the above are the principal, and serve to illustrate the phenomena
now observable in mineral lodes and veins. Fissures also occurred
along different portions of which all the conditions mentioned were
developed. The course of a fissure diverged from between two
parallel bands, and passing downwards, or laterally through one
wall, established the conditions described in the second case,
whence it passed into the third, &c.
Where plutonic or hydrothermal action resulted in the injection
of dykes, we find that while some of those dykes found their way
along the lines of least resistance or with the strike of the rock-
hands, others intersected the latter across their line of strike, either
■obliquely or at right angles.
Admitting generally that the fissures resulted from movements
-of the earth’s crust and the fracturing thereby of the rock-masses,


the next consideration is the method by which the quartz-veins
were formed into fissures, and the associated minerals conveyed
and deposited in or with the quartz. In the first place it is known
that silica, the principal, or nearly the sole constituent of quartz,,
is capable under certain conditions of being held in solution and of
being deposited from that state in various forms, crystalline, concre-
tionary, laminar, &c. Of several theories once entertained as to
the formation of quartz and other mineral veins or lodes, one was
that they were deposits, in the fissures, of minerals held in solution
by the sea during some period when the country was submerged,
ibis is untenable, for the simple reason, among many others, that
under such conditions the natural results would be the speedy fill-
ing up of the fissures by mechanically-formed sediments of mud
and detritus, of which we find no evidence whatever. Another
theory was that the quartz was injected in a molten state like an
igneous dyke. This is refuted by an overwhelming mass of
evidence, some of which also bears on the first-mentioned theory.
The various structures exhibited by quartz, whether crystalline,
amorphous, or laminated, are not those which it could be expected
to assume on cooling from a state of fusion , whether quickly or
slowly, or at whatever depth below the surface.
The walls of quartz-veins show not the least indication of having
been subjected to dry heat emanating from such veins. In the case
of quartz-veins traversing dykes, we see plainly that the latter
whatever their origin, were injected first, and that in shrinkage-
cracks and other fissures which formed in or along them during or
subsequent to their consolidation, the quartz has since been formed
in lodes, veins, strings, or bunches, in a manner wholly irrecon-
cilable with the idea that it was ever in a molten condition ; and
further, we find frequent instances of bunches or small veins or
patches of quartz occupying hollows or cracks remote or totally
isolated from large veins, and unaccompanied by any indication of
having attained that position by being injected in a molten state.
Such quartz-veins are occasionally to be met with in the Upper
Paheozoic (? Upper Devonian) rocks of the Avon, under conditions
which preclude all possibility of their being of Plutonic origin.
Dismissing the above theories, we can turn to a third, which
affords the most probable explanation. It is that the quartz veins
are the results of the segregation of silica from the surrounding
rocks themselves, or the subjacent Plutonic masses, and its con-
veyance by percolation—probably hydrothermal—waters into the
fissures, where it was precipitated, according to local conditions,
in the various forms assumed by quartz, much in the same way as
we see calcareous veins in actual course of formation in cracks
and fissures in limestones, and even in rocks containing but a
small proportion of lime. If to this action was added, as it is
reasonable to suppose, that of heated mineral waters, steam, and


vapours, bearing in mind fhat the intensely-heated portion of the
earth’s interior was then nearer to the surface than now, we have
a set of conditions under which it is easy to conceive the forma-
tion of siliceous veins, and the deposition with, or in them, of metals
or minerals which had also previously been in a state of solution
or volatility, though perhaps it may not be possible to reason out
exactly the various forms of chemical action which were developed
during the process. The late Sir R. Daintree strongly advocated
the theory that hydrothermal action arising out of deep-seated
Plutonic action played an important part in the formation of
quartz-lodes, and the deposit of their associated minerals.
Assuming the above general main conditions as having been in
existence, the infinite variety of modes of occurrence of quartz-
veins and associated minerals can bo reasonably attributed to
them, though their action was evidently subject to local modifica-
tion as regards degrees of intensity, or influenced by such
mechanical forces as may have been contemporaneously in opera-
tion. Thus we find that one quartz reef consists of white
amorphous quartz ; another is more or less evenly laminated ; a
third shows marked crystalline structure ; in a fourth, the lode
contains on one wall quartz of a different character to that
occurring on the other, and the two kinds may be found to be
separated by a clean parting or to merge into one another. Two
or more of the foregoing features may be found in different parts
of the same line of lode. Gold or other minerals may be found
near one wall more than the other, or any other of the phenomena
encountered by the miner in connexion with quartz-veins may be
mentioned ; but there are none that I have seen or heard of that
are not susceptible of explanation under the segregation and
hydrothermal theory, allowing for different degrees, of rapidity of
action, intensity of heat, the predominance of certain minerals or
vapours in one locality over another, and the various displace-
ments due to further movements of the earth’s crust which took
place during or subsequently to the deposition of the vein-stones.
It is not necessarily to be inferred that the fissures to which
the mineral waters determined were from the first as wide as the
veins which now fill them. No doubt successive re-openings,
caused by earth-movements, and enlargements of the fissures,
effected by the passage of moving waters, enabled successive de-
positions of quartz and other minerals to be produced, and to this,
no doubt, may be attributed the circumstance of some particular
band in a reef being usually more auriferous or more highly
mineralized than another. As a rule, it has been observed that
laminated or seamy quartz is usually more highly auriferous than
that of a massive amorphous character; and the idea has sug-
gested itself that the latter was formed quickly, there being an
excess of siliceous matter present, and the metallic minerals not
present in proportionate quantity; whereas, in the case of the


laminar quartz, the deposit proceeded slowly in successive coats*,
thus giving time for the associated deposit of the rarer minerals.
Much of the finer free gold, in portions of lode above water-
level, may have been originally in mechanical combination with
pyrites Avhich have since decomposed.
With respect to the primal origin of the gold itself, it can be no
better accounted for than can that of iron, lead, or any other metal
or form of matter; but with regard to its association with the
Palaeozoic rocks, there is an hypothesis available, the advancement
of which can at least do no harm. The conjecture is based on
the known presence of a minute proportion of gold in sea-water,
and it is supposed that when the Silurian rocks were being laid
down, gold was present in the water in greater quantity than now;
that much of it was gradually precipitated and deposited either
free, or in chemical combinations, with the sediments as they slowlv
accumulated, and that after the consolidation and upheaval of the
strata, permeating heated mineralized water, both of meteoric
origin and incorporate! with the rocks, conveyed the gold in
solution in company with the silica to the vein fissures, where it
was segregated into grains, strings, and crystals, forming masses
of greater or less size, from invisible specks up to large nuggets,
according to the intensity of the agencies at work. Premising
with the remark that the theoretical views advanced are only given
as a working hypothesis to be held with a loose grasp, and likelv
to be modified by new facts, Mr. A. W. Howitt, from whom I first
acquired the idea, has generously placed at my disposal the follow-
ing notes, which I quote in cxtenso.
“ 1. I assume the existence of gold in solution in the Palaeozoic
seas.
“ 2. The Silurian sediments, during their formation, necessarily
included a large amount of sea-water (organic matter may have
precipitated gold in a metallic state, and in a finely-distributed
condition, throughout and in these sediments).
“ 3. This included sea-water could not escape until the sedi-
ments were raised above sea-level.
“ 4. The geological evidence shows that before being so raised
they were folded, compressed, and depressed within the influence
of the internal heat of the earth, (It is immaterial whence this
heat was derived—possibly due to the molten interior, and heat
resulting from motion in the crushed sediments.)
“ o. The sediments were then invaded by molten rock masses
from below; were metamorphosed, melted, and absorbed as to
their lower portions ; the molten material was forced upwards
through the line of least resistance to the surface, and gave rise
to the Palreozoic volcanoes, e.g ., of the Snowy Eiver. The great
masses of molten material on final consolidation are represented
by the granitic rocks underlying all Victoria,


“ 6. The salts in solution in the sea-water included in the sedi-
ments, and the materials of the sediments themselves, reacted
upon each other under the influences of heat and pressure.
“ 7. The mineralized waters would find passage through the
contact planes of the igneous and sedimentary rocks, and by
fractures in the strata, &c.
“8. On the cooling down of the rocks, the waters would like-
wise lessen in temperature, and deposit their metallic and mineral
substances which they had ‘ leached ’ out of the sediments ;
would deposit them in the contact planes, faults, and fissures.
Faults which had been penetrated by dykes would also afford
passage to such waters, and to sublimations, e.g ., Cohen’s Reef
and also ‘ Steam-boat Springs of California.’
“ 9. All the saline solutions in the Paleozoic seas would enter
into reactions, and even if the gold had been reduced by organic
substances, it would, I think, be again chlorinated on the re-
generation of the felspars out of the materials of the sediments and
the alkaline chlorides and chloride of calcium in solution.
“It seems to me, therefore, probable that we may refer the
formation of auriferous veins and metalliferous lodes, generally
occurring in the Silurian and Devonian formations, to Plutonic and
volcanic action, which prevailed about the close of the Silurian
period and onwards, until our geological record closes in the
Upper Devonian. But we must also take into account a secondary
process which is always going on in the reactions produced by
meteoric waters percolating from the surface downward ; this
process is partly one of decomposition and partly of concentration.
“ The conclusions I arrive at are, therefore —First, that the gold
has been collected out of the sediments during the Plutonic and
volcanic action in Paleozoic periods ; second, that it has been (at
the surface) undergoing concentration, partly by the removal or
decomposition of metallic ores. We know that auriferous reefs
very frequently, if not almost always, occur in bands along the
strike of the sediments. In accordance with the above views,
I suggest that these bands represent extensive fractures, com-
municating downwards with the planes of contact of the igneous
and sedimentary formations. Such extensive fractures would
give passage to heated mineralized waters and to sublimations..
As to these bands, I think we may assume the following:—
“ Ist. The folding and compression of the Silurian rocks w r as
consequent upon the contraction of the earth s crust through
cooling of the globe.
“ 2nd. That fractures would most probably occur along the
axes of anticlinal and synclinal folds.
“ 3rd. The pressure of a folded and depressed portion of the
earth’s crust upon the molten material beneath would afford a
sufficient primum mobile to produce the upward thrust of liquid


rock masses through fissures, and generally against the overlying
sediments. This pressure, produced by the contracting crust,
would suffice to produce volcanic outbreaks, without calling in
aid ‘ waves of the molten interior/ &c. Nor could steam be
called in to produce the upward motion of the molten rock until
it (the rock) rose to within such a distance of the surface that
the pressure of the column of rock (or of molten rock) was no
longer sufficient to keep water fluid/’
The occurrence of auriferous quartz-veins in belts may—assum-
ing the above supposition to be correct —be due to the circum-
stance that a greater amount of gold was deposited in certain sets
of layers than in others, and that when the rocks were uplifted
from a horizontal to a vertical position, those bands which con-
tained most gold yielded the largest supply for deposition in the
quartz-veins, while in others containing little or no gold only poor
or barren quartz-veins were formed. lam aware that many diffi-
culties will have to be surmounted before the above theory can
take the position of an universally accepted explanation ; but in
the meantime it claims to be a good working hypothesis, founded
on well-digested information, and likely at no distant date to rank
—subject to a few modifications —among the established deductions
of science.
With regard to the occurrence in alluvial deposits of nuggets or
masses of gold, far exceeding in size any found in the quartz-reefs
themselves, and the consequent difficulty of reconciling this cir-
cumstance with the belief that all alluvial gold has resulted from
the degradation of quartz reefs, it may be observed that many of
the large nuggets found in alluvial deposits have been intimately
mixed with vein-quartz in such a manner as to leave no room for
doubt as to the latter having formed portion of the original matrix.
Some nuggets have been found on which distinct impressions of
quartz crystals were visible, and in nearly all large nuggets
there is a certain “ honeycombed ” or “ ragged ” appearance in
those portions that have not been smoothed externally by
attrition.
I do not lose sight of the hypothesis formed by Mr. Selwyn, that
pieces of gold disintegrated from quartz reefs may have been
subsequently added to in the drifts by deposit of gold from solu-
tion by meteoric waters. This was supported by the experiments
of Sir R. Daintree and Mr. C. S. WTlkinson, who proved that the
presence of organic matter or pyrites caused the deposit of metallic
gold from solution. It has also been urged in support of this
belief, that the largest nuggets were found where volcanic erup-
tions, as at Ballarat, had favoured the development of highly
mineralized waters, and that in parts of G-ippsland and other
places where there has been no volcanic activity, pieces of gold
above a few ounces in weight are rare.


Now, as a matter of fact, many of the largest nuggets that have
been found were discovered between Moliagul and Wedderburn,
close to the surface, in country where there is no indication of
volcanic action having ever taken place; while, on the other hand,
no pieces over 40 ozs. in weight have been found in the gravels
beneath the older basaltic layers in Grippsland, where one would
suppose the conditions for the development and action of mineral-
ized waters would have been equally, if not more, favorable, and
also of longer duration that at Ballarat.
I cannot help thinking, therefore, that the augmentation of
pieces of gold by further deposit from the surrounding meteoric
waters must have been very trifling, if it took place at all ; that
the large nuggets were originally formed in the quartz reefs, and
subsequently disintegrated therefrom; and that the occurrence of
larger masses of gold in one part of the country than in another is
due to the conditions under which the gold was first segregated in
the quartz-veins having been more intense in one group of rocks
than in another.
Tolerably large lumps of solid gold, or intermixed with but a
small proportion of quartz, and many ounces—in some cases
pounds—in weight, have been actually found in quartz reefs, and
those which I have inspected all looked as though, if subjected to
the long continued action of moving water in company with
pebbles and other hard fragments, much, if not all, of their associ-
ated quartz would be removed out of them, and the gold beaten
and welded into more compact form. It is not unreasonable to
believe that if a mass of gold one pound in weight could have
been formed under certain conditions in a quartz matrix, a mass
of 200 pounds or more might have been formed under similar but
more intense conditions, perhaps accompanied by additional con-
ditions favorable to the segregation of gold in larger masses than
ordinary.
Assuming the correctness of the previously enunciated theory
as to the general mode in which quartz and associated minerals
were segregated into veins, Ave have, in addition, the certainty that
those portions of quartz reefs which we now see at the present
surface were really formed at great depths below what was the
surface at the time they were in process of formation. Enough
has been said in the portions of this work devoted to geological
history to show that the denudation to Avhich the Palaeozoic rocks
have been subjected is simply incalculable. Most, if not all, of
our quartz reefs appear to have been formed during Palaeozoic
times, and consequently their original upper portions have been
removed by the denuding action of subsequent ages ; it is quite
possible, therefore, that when they were in process of formation
the conditions near the then surface were more favorable than at
considerable depths to the accumulation of the gold in large masses,
and that the large nuggets found in our alluviums were originally


segregated in portions of the quartz reefs which have since been
entirely removed, leaving their disintegrated gold to drop gradu-
ally as the surface became lower by abrasion.
Much has been said about the alleged prediction of Mr. Selwyn,
and other geologists, to the effect that quartz reefs would cease
to be auriferous below a depth of 400 feet. The general opinion
which has been tortured so industriously into a dictum, was pub-
lished many years ago when quartz mining, both in California
and in Australia, was in its infancy, and this opinion was simply
to the effect that, in the light of experience obtained in European
and Asiatic gold mining, auriferous quartz lodes were more likely
to decrease than to increase in richness as followed downwards,
and would probably become unremunerative within limited depths.
Mr. Selwyn personally, however, maintained the view that such
decrease would be inappreciable within the limits attainable by
human skill. The opinion has happily proved correct; our sub-
sequently acquired experience here shows that many of the lodes
yield good returns from depths exceeding 1,000 feet, and, at
Stawell and Sandhurst, rich yields have been obtained from double
fhat depth, so that the question as to whether deep quartz mining
will pay is practically answered in the affirmative as far as our
more important quartz mining districts are concerned, Mr, Selwyn
did not fail to record his conviction that there was no reason to
doubt but that quartz gold mining would prove as permanent a
source of wealth here as tin or copper mining in England. In
some places, however, quartz reefs, payably auriferous while in
Silurian rock, have been followed down to subjacent granite, and
have there been found to thin out and become unprofitable; so
that there is evidence, at all events in some cases, of the granite,
at whatever depth it may be encountered, forming one limit to the
successful dowmvard prosecution of quartz mining. I here refer
to granite as a mass or portion of the hypogene rock foundation,
and not as a dyke or injected vein; in the latter form granite or
some kindred rock may be found to contain payably auriferous
quartz-veins to indefinite depths while traversing Silurian rocks.
Admitting that there is nothing to preclude the hope that many
of our quartz mines may yield profitable returns from the utmost
depths to which human skill can penetrate, the first portion of the
opinion above referred to —as to probable decrease in richness of
the lodes as followed down—has not so far been refuted by
experience, though it is no doubt amenable to considerable modi-
fication. The fact can hardly be gainsaid —giving due credit for
exceptional rich yields from great depths—that, on the average,
richer quartz has been obtained from the surface portions of the
reefs generally than has been met with in the deep levels, and
though our lodes may be practically inexhaustible, there is nothing
to justify the expectation of an increased yield from them as
followed downwards.


To judge by the extraordinary richness of many of our alluvial
workings, and the size of the nuggets found in them, as compared
with the yields obtained from the auriferous quartz reefs near
them, the conclusion suggests itself that the denuded upper por-
tions of those reefs, whence the alluvial gold was originally derived,
must have been far richer than what remain intact, even allowing
for the denudation of the Palaeozoic rocks and their associated
quartz-veins, for a thickness of many hundreds or even thousands
of feet in vertical height above the present surface, and the con-
centration of the gold thus disintegrated into gravelly deposits of
comparatively limited extent. With the fact of our surface
quartz having so far proved of greater average richness than that
obtained from considerable depths,* and the strong evidence that
the quartz which has been denuded, and from which the gxdd of
the alluviums has been disintegrated by geological action, was
even richer still, the general correctness of the first portion of the
opinions referred to remains unchallengeable, though enough has
fortunately been proved to justify sanguine hopes as to the future
progress of deep quartz mining, and to warrant the expenditure
of capital in its development.
* The quartz-mines of Sandhurst afford a notable exception to this rule.


CHAPTER XIII.
Alluvial Gold Drifts. —Auriferous Miocene Gravel. Auri-
ferous Palceozoic Conglomerates. Tertiary Gold Drifts
of different periods. Different Classes of Alluvial Gold
Mining. General Geological History of Gold Drifts.
Under this head I here include any auriferous detrital deposit in
the form of earth, rubble, clay, sand, drift, gravel, conglomerate,
or cement —as distinguished from vein-quartz or matrix rock —
whether deep or shallow, loose and incoherent, or consolidated,
and of whatever geological age, from Upper Palaeozoic to Post
Tertiary. All Victorian gold drifts yet worked are of Tertiary
or Post Tertiary age, and were provisionally classified by Mr.
Selwyn in three principal groups, referable respectively to the
Older Pliocene, Newer Pliocene, and Post Pliocene epochs.
About twenty years ago, Mr. Selwyn advanced a strong opinion
as to the non-auriferous character of gravels of Miocene or Middle
Tertiary age, and based it on the non-discovery of gold in certain
gravels of that age which were prospected by the geological
survey party then at work near Steiglitz, and the alleged failure
of a mining company to obtain gold in a very deep deposit of
Miocene age at Morrison’s diggings, on the Moorabool, though
the Pliocene gravels resting on the “ false bottom” formed by the
Miocene deposit had been profitably worked.
I have been informed, however, that, during the operations of
the company in question, a small quantity of gold was obtained
on reaching the Silurian bed-rock, but that work was discontinued
before reaching the deepest ground, where any considerable
quantity of gold that might exist would naturally be expected to
be found.
Subsequent investigations have shown that payably auriferous
gravels of the Miocene period occur beneath the older basalt of
various parts of Grippsland, and in the T arra basin, so that the
mere fact of a gravel or drift being of that period is no evidence
as to its being non-auriferous. In New South Wales, a conglo-
merate of Upper Palaeozoic age resting on Silurian rocks has been
found to contain alluvial gold in fair quantity, and in pieces up to
several ounces in weight, so that there is no reason whatever to
doubt the possibility of finding payable gold in any detrital
deposit younger than and resting on Silurian rocks. There is
very good evidence to the effect that the quartz reefs and their
associated gold had been deposited in the vein fissures prior to the
formation of the Upper Palaeozoic rocks, and, therefore, such
gravels or conglomerates of Upper Palaeozoic or more recent date,


as rest immediately upon and are made up of detritus derived
from Silurian rocks, are certain to contain gold in the vicinity of
where the latter are traversed by auriferous quartz-veins.
It so happens that in the neighbourhood of most of our
gold-fields conglomerates of Upper Palaeozoic or Mesozoic age do
not occur, or have not been tested, but there are places where it
is reasonable to expect that the lowest beds of such conglomerates,
where resting immediately on the Silurian bed-rock, might be found
auriferous. These localities will be mentioned hereafter, though to
test them would be a matter involving considerable outlay and only
to be entered upon after ascertaining beyond a doubt the auriferous
character of exposed Silurian rocks within reasonable distance.
Among the tertiary gold drifts we can now identify those of at
least four distinct periods. (1.) That of Miocene or Middle Tertiary
age formed prior to the outpouring of the Older Volcanic lava-
flows. (2.) That classed as Older Pliocene, which in some places
appears to be of marine or littoral deposit, and in others the result
of fluviatile action. (3.) The deep lead gravels occupying gutters
or channels cut through, and therefore newer than the Older
Pliocene gravels, but older than the Newer Volcanic lava-flows.
(4.) Post Tertiary drifts and gravels, more recent than the newer
basalt, and made up of materials derived from the denudation of
some of the foregoing or from recently effected abrasion of the
Silurian rocks.
The different modes of occurrence of alluvial gold are so familiar
to our miners that it seems almost superfluous to describe them,
but it is as well to mention the principal classes of alluvial gold
workings in order to elucidate the remarks on the geological action
by which the gold was conveyed into the different positions in
which it is found.
1. Surfacing.—Earth or thin layers of clay, rubble, and decom-
posed rock on the slopes or summits of hills composed of Silurian
rocks. The gold is found free or associated with fragmentary
quartz, from the surface-earth dow r n into the chinks and crevices
of the bed-rock. In some cases the gold thus found has been de-
rived directly from some line of quartz reef traversing the Silurian
rocks, and is found to be ragged ” and unaltered in form; in
other instances a gravel drift has at one time existed, and has
been wholly or partially removed, and the w'ater-worn gold once
contained in it —primarily derived from the disintegration of quartz
reefs —has been left behind, and has simply dropped deeper as the
rock sui’face became abraded. Combinations of the two cases are
frequent, and some of our reef-washes, or other auriferous alluvial
deposits on slopes of Silurian rocks underneath basalt, represent
the precisely similar conditions which existed in former ages and
have been preserved from further change by the covering of
volcanic rock.


2. River, Creek, and Gully Workings. —The deposits of gravel,
drift, &c., resting on the Silurian rocks in the beds or on the banks
of water-courses. These deposits vary from a few inches to
many feet in thickness ; the gold is usually found low down in the
gravel, on the bed-rock or deep in its crevices; in river valleys,
terraces of auriferous gravel are sometimes met with on the rocky
slopes high above the river beds. These appear to be vestiges of
deposits formed before the water-courses had eroded their channels
to so great a depth in the bed-rock as they have since reached.
The gold in all these deposits has been either derived directly
from the disintegration of the quartziferous Silurian rocks, or
from the denudation and re-distribution of pre-existing drifts.
3. Leads.—Gravels, conglomerates, &c., of Middle or Upper
Tertiary age, deposited in the beds of ancient rivers, in some places
only covered by recent accumulations, and in others by one, two,
three, or four distinct layers of basalt. To such may be added
some “ reef-washes,” which have been formed during intervals
between the outpouring of two different lava-flows. The beds of
these ancient rivers are in some localities above, and in others
below, those of existing streams, and are worked by tunnels or
shafts accordingly.
4. Gravels, conglomerates, &c., apparently due to marine
littoral action ; these are generally more widely spread than Ihe
lead gravels ; the gold is more “patchy” in its occurrence, though
sometimes found in defined “runs,” not necessarily in the deepest
hollows of the bed-rock, but often on the ridges or slopes thereof.
Some of these deposits cap hills of Silurian rock ; others consti-
tute “ reef-washes ” beneath the basalt, but at higher levels than
the deep lead gutters. Though the above embrace the chief forms
of auriferous alluvial deposits, there is an infinite variety of
combinations to be met with, but all attributable to the same prin-
cipal cause —denudation by atmospheric and aqueous action of the
Silurian rocks and their accompanying quartz-veins. It is not to
be supposed, however, that all our alluvial gold was disintegrated
from its matrices only since the commencement of Tertiary times.
We have such irrefragable proof that denundation has been acting
on the Silurian rocks from their first appearance as aland surface,
that it is only reasonable to believe that considerable proportions
of the gold found in, and the materials composing, the various
auriferous gravels, were disintegrated from the matrices and rock-
masses during Upper Palaeozoic and Mesozoic times.
The water-worn character of the pebbles and boulders, and also
the gold itself in the gravels quite close to the apparent sources
whence their materials were derived, indicate that the fragments
wei’e broken from the rocks and rounded by forces acting prior to
the agencies which finally deposited the gravels, and that these
are for a great part re-distributions of pre-existing deposits


combined with the results of further denudation of the Silurian
rock-masses. A considerable portion of the materials now com-
posing the Upper and Post Tertiary gravels, and the gold associated
with them, may have once formed part successively of Upper
Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and Lower and Middle Tertiary detrital
deposits ; denudation during each succeeding period having sifted
and re-arranged the materials, removing the soft and friable,
leaving the harder fragments more and more water worn, and
making further encroachments on the Silurian rocks. Throughout
all changes, however, the larger disintegrated particles of gold,
owing to the high specific gravity of the metal, appear to have
been conveyed to but comparatively short distances from the
parent quartz-lodes. Once freed from its matrix, the natural
tendency of a fragment of gold of any appreciable weight is
merely to drop deeper, as the surrounding or subjacent materials
are removed, and though much of the gold in the leads has
probably travelled for some distance, it appears to have done so
principally while attached to portion of its matrix, or when in
small particles in company with masses of other materials which
carried it along with them ; or when a smooth bed-rock offered
no resting place.
On this circumstance may be founded a principle that, where
there are auriferous alluviums, there are likely to be aiuifeious
quartz-veins at no great distance. Though by no means new,
this principle has not hitherto been recognised in its full import-
ance, and there is reason to believe that its judicious application to
extensive and systematic prospecting would result in a largely
increased development of quartz-mining throughout the colony.


CHAPTER XIV.
Suggestions for further development of Gold Mining—quartz
and alluvial. General principles. Auriferous zones, or
belts, described according to geographical position from
nest to east. Metals other than Gold.
In indicating the directions in which mining exploration in
search of auriferous gravels and quartz reefs appears most likely
to prove successful, two circumstances, already pointed out, have
to be kept in view, as forming a basis on which to arrive at a
reliable conjecture as to the probable auriferous character of any
particular locality.
The first is the known occurrence of auriferous quartz reefs—
whether in Silurian rocks, or in dykes traversing the same —in
belts or strips of varying width, but of undefined longitudinal
extent. The second is the strong indication afforded by the
presence of any considerable quantity of gold in alluviums, as to
the close proximity of auriferous quartz reefs ; and conversely,
the likelihood, or indeed certainty, of finding alluvial gold in
detrital deposits, derived from and in the vicinity of rocks con-
taining auriferous quartz-veins.
The principal belts containing auriferous quartz reefs are now
tolerably well known so far as the country consists of exposed
Silurian rocks, and, in some places, the quartz reefs are being
worked on their extensions beneath alluvial deposits and volcanic
layers. Between these belts occur tracts of country which, though
consisting of Silurian rocks traversed by quartz reefs, have, in
spite of careful prospecting, failed to yield gold in remunerative
quantity, though, no doubt, there may be in such apparently non-
auriferous tracts minor belts or lines of auriferous quartz reef
which have hitherto escaped observation. The lateral limits of
the proved portions of the auriferous zones are, however, sufficiently
well defined, and their lines of strike sufficiently well marked to
furnish data for guidance in prospecting on the northward or
southward longitudinal extension of such zones. That these
zones do not maintain their auriferous character throughout their
entire lengths is evident; but it would appear that ou their lines
of strike the quartz reefs within their limits are auriferous for
various lengths, increasing in richness in one locality and dimin-
ishing in another. In fact, as a single line of quartz reef is
generally found to contain gold in successive shoots, separated by
barren intervals, so do the belts comprising each a number of
quartz reefs exhibit the same phenomenon. So long as the country


consists of exposed Silurian rocks, the belts can easily be followed,
and the quartz reefs or alluvial deposits tested at or near the
surface; but when we consider the comparatively small width,
north and south, of the exposed Silurian rocks composing the
western portion of the main mountain system, in which our richest
gold-fields are situated, and the maintenance of their character from
place to place by the auriferous belts within that width, we are
led to the conclusion that by following the lines of extension of
those belts, and penetrating the newer formations overlying the
Silurian rocks northward or southward of the Main Divide, we are
likely to discover fresh groups of auriferous quartz reefs tra-
versing the concealed bed-rock and auriferous gravels overlying
it in their vicinity. This remark applies not only to Victoria but
to the entire breadth of Australia, from Victoria to the Gulf of
Carpentaria, for there is no reason to doubt the continuance of the
Victorian group of auriferous belts beneath the newer formations
of the western portions of New South Wales and Queensland.
There is even a fair probability of discovering payable alluvial
gold in the lowest beds of Marine Tertiary, Mesozoic, or Upper
Palmozoic formations where these consist of gravels or conglom-
erates, and rest immediately on Silurian rocks on or near the lines
of extension of any of the known auriferous belts. In fact, con-
sidering that in such localities the Silurian rocks have very likely
been subjected to greater degradation than in the mountain
districts, and bearing in mind the tendency of gold to remain nearly
stationary during the removal of large quantities of other materials,
it is not unreasonable to infer that gold may thus be found in large
quantity, though probably more widely and irregularly distributed
than it would be in narrow leads of fluviatile origin.
No doubt the difficulties to be encountered would be great, and
search in such directions Avould not be justified except on excellent
data obtained where the Silurian rocks were near the surface; but
nevertheless, there are reasonable grounds for hope that, with
increased knowledge and improved mining appliances, the auri-
ferous belts will, at some future date, be traced for a far greater
length than they may be at present supposed to extend to.
It would be impossible to say how deep it would be necessary
to sink before reaching the bed-rock in the Murray Valley for
instance, but I believe that in any portion of it lying to the east-
ward of the meridian of Stawell, the greatest depth would not
exceed 1,000 feet. In the meantime, hoAvcA’er, there is abundant
scope for exploration in search of gold, Avhether quartz or alluvial,
in localities Avhere the depth would be comparatiAmly trifling, and
where the proximity of proved auriferous country would Avarrant
the expenditure necessary to prosecute the search. I will there-
fore now proceed to briefly describe the principal known auriferous
belts from the Avestern to the eastern portions of the colony, and


to indicate on their lines of extension, northward and southward,
where mining explorations would be attended with a fair chance
of success. It must be understood, however, that the sequence of
the gold-fields of each belt, in relation to lines of strike, can only be
indicated approximately.
The Geological Sketch-map of Victoria will be found a valuable
adjunct to the perusal of these remarks, and if intelligently used
by intending prospectors, will assist them to conduct their opera-
tions with reasonable prospects of success.
The westernmost gold-field in Victoria is that of Moyston,
where a moderate extent of alluvial ground and one or two rich
lines of reef have been worked. The reefs after being followed
with good results to a depth of 400 feet or more, are at present
unworked, though by all accounts there are good inducements to
attempt to trace them further. Approximately in the line of
strike of the Moyston reefs is the Frying-pan gold-field, where
some good finds were made, though little is being done at present.
The continuation of this belt northward and southward is likely
to contain other alluvial deposits and quartz reefs.
The next belt eastward is a very important one, containing as
it does Stawell, and the diggings northward and southward, the
Great Western, Armstrong’s, and Ararat gold-fields. An area of
exposed granite breaks the continuity of this belt between
Stawell and Great Western; but there is every reason to expect
that by following the strike of the rocks northward from Stawell,
more gold-bearing “ shoots ” will be found in the quartz reefs, and
fresh alluvial deposits opened up in the gravels and conglomerates.
Ararat, though of great extent and richness as an alluvial field,
is so far unimportant as regards quartz mining; but it is difficult
to believe that where the alluvial has been so productive, there
are not rich quartz reefs in the vicinity, either in the hills or con-
cealed beneath the alluvial deposits. The main lead of the Hop-
kins Valley, the outlet of the principal leads of Ararat, is likely
to prove rich where its position has lately been ascertained by
means of diamond-drill bores, just where, after a deviation to the
east, away from the auriferous belt, it re-crosses it again south-
eastward from Kangaroo Point.
The southern, and so far unexplored, extension of the Ararat
belt should pass in the direction of Yalla-y-Poora, where out-
crops of Silurian rocks are shown to exist on the Geological
Sketch-map. Careful prospecting is to be recommended in this
locality.
Eastward from the Ararat and Stawell belt lies that of Navarre
and Landsborough, on the southern extension of which, towards
Buangor, there appears to be good scope for the prospector.
Next to the eastward lies the belt containing St. Arnaud,
.Stuart Mill, Red Bank, Moonambel, Percydale, Amphitheatre,


Waterloo, Raglan, and Beaufort, all within a strip of moderate
width, having a direction approximately coincident with the
strike of the Silurian rocks. Northward from St. Arnaud the
country consists of wide plains, to prospect the deep alluvial
deposits of which would be expensive and difficult, though
perhaps future discoveries may warrant the attempt being made;
but on either side of a line from St. Arnaud to Beaufort there is
a considerable extent of country worthy of careful search, and
many reefs once worked, but now abandoned, which would in all
likelihood pay well were work resumed on them.
The range lying between Raglan and Waterloo, and terminating
at Beaufort, offers special inducements to the quartz prospector,
as from its denudation in past times a great quantity of alluvial
gold must have been derived, and there ought to be unremoved
reefs remaining, which contain gold in payable quantity. Gold
has been found south from Beaufort to the verge of the Lilerie
Plain, the deep ground of which is untried, and across that plain
far to the south, on the apparent prolongation of the belt, are the
Skipton diggings, thus indicating the probability of the main-
tenance of the auriferous character of the Silurian rocks beneath
the plain. Of this, however, more will be said in connexion with
the next two belts of gold-bearing country, one of which contains,
—north of the plains —Bealiba, Homebnsh, Avoca, Lamplough,
and Lexton ; on the south, Carngham, Linton, and Happy \ alley.
The other comprises:—North —Wedderburn, Wehla, Mclntyre,
Berlin, Moliagul, Goldsborough, Dunolly, Timor, Maryborough,
Amherst, and Talbot ; south —Haddon, Smythesdale, Scarsdale,
and Rokewood. It may be remarked that though names of
detached localities are given to indicate the course of the belts,
there are really but few breaks in the continuity of the auriferous
character of the last-mentioned from Wedderburn to Talbot, and
from Haddon to Rokewood. Alluvial diggings have been worked
all along from place to place in both sections of the belt, the gap
between which is occupied by the outcropping granite of the
Mount Beckworth Range, and the basaltic plains extending west-
ward from Ballarat to the Hopkins Valley, through Lilerie,
between Beaufort and Carngham. Underneath these plains must
lie the extensions of the leads trending west from Ballarat, of
those of Haddon, and doubtless many others at present unknown.
These are evidently joined near Lilerie by the Waterloo leads, and
several others near Beaufort. There is every probability that
where these leads cross the three last-mentioned belts, beneath
the Burrumbeet and Lilerie Plains, eastward of a line from Beau-
fort to Carngham, there may exist a deep alluvial gold-field equal
to any yet found in Victoria, and that the northern and western
lead system of Ballarat, though impoverished immediately west of
that city, may be found to have received a wonderful accession ot


wealth after crossing the courses of the three auriferous belts above
described. Though the relations are somewhat obscure, lam
inclined to class in the next belt to the eastward the gold-fields of
Kingower, Jones’ Creek, Carisbrook, Majorca, and Clunes north
of the plains, and the Whim Holes and other workings to the
south-westward of Ballarat. The deep leads on this belt between
Clunes and Miners’ Rest should prove payable.
Proceeding eastward, the next belt may be described as the
most important in Victoria. From the geographical position of
the various localities in relation to one another, and to the general
strike of the Silurian rocks, I regard as constituting exposed por-
tions of one great auriferous zone the gold-fields of Inglewood,
Tarnagulla, and Kay’s diggings, north of the plains of the Loddon
Valley, and to the south the gold-fields of Smeaton, Kingston,
Creswick, Ballarat, Buninyong, and the Durham ; the last-named
southern localities are continuous with one another as regards
auriferous character, there being no break from the Durham to
Smeaton, a distance, north and south, of 25 miles, in the alluvial
gold-workings, over a width averaging, from east to west, about
4 miles.
Southward from the Durham, the belt becomes poorer in gold,
the deep ground having so far proved unremunerative, and the
shallow diggings scattered and patchy. It is noticeable, however,
that the bed of the Leigh River has been profitably worked for
20 miles down from the Durham, and that auriferous gravels
have been traced from its banks under the basaltic plains south of
Mount Mercer, where the further continuation of the Durham
gutter is sure to exist. It is, therefore, quite likely that the belt
of Silurian rocks extending southward from Ballarat may here
be found to have regained its auriferous character, and that the
deep gravels resting on it beneath the basalt may be as rich in
gold as those to the north.
As regards the unexplored portion hidden by basalt, between
Smeaton and Tarnagulla, the indications are’most hopeful ; there
is every reason to believe that the belt retains its auriferous
character from the Madam Berry mine to Tarnagulla, a distance
of 30 miles, and that all the alluvial gravels between the basalt
on its course will prove profitable.
On a smaller scale, the flat alluvial country along the Bui Bui
Creek, between Tarnagulla and Inglewood, is likely to prove
auriferous in the vicinity of a line between the two places.
Separated from the Ballarat and Durham auriferous belt of
country by a broad strip, in which no gold workings of import-
ance have been discovered, the next to the eastward is the Elaine
and Mount Doran belt, too isolated to admit of its true relations
to others being determined ; it is, however, noticeable that the com-
mencement of the Hepburn Home Paddock lead is approximately


-where the prolongation of this belt might be expected to be,
and it may be inferred that auriferous deposits are likely to be
found where Silurian rocks constitute the “ bottom ” beneath the
great basaltic areas of Warrenheip, Bungaree, and Dean, in the
vicinity of a line from Mount Doran to the Hepburn Home
Paddock.
Steiglitz, the Moorabool diggings, Mount Egerton, Gordon, the
Korweinguboora reefs, and the workings westward of Daylesford
and thence to near Yandoit, constitute another belt of auriferous
country along which further discoveries are likely to be made,
especially in deep alluvial ground south ward of Egerton, along the
Moorabool Valley, and between Gordon and Egerton, where the
position of deep ground has lately been ascertained by means of
boring with the diamond-drill.
Next to the eastward is a very important auriferous belt com-
mencing at the north with Maldon, and extending thence south-
ward along Sandy Creek, Jim Crow Creek, Daylesford, and thence
to Blakeville. Further south on the same course payable gold has
been found near the Ballanee estate and along the Werribee River
to within a few miles of Bacchus Marsh, The deep alluvial
ground in the Loddon Valley, near Newstead, may be expected to
be payable below where it crosses this belt, and towards the
southern extremity the deep ground of the Ballanee estate is also
deserving of exploration.
Castleraaine, Chewton, and Fryerstown form portion of another
auriferous zone, the northern continuation of which, beyond the
granite of the Big Hill Range, is indicated by the gold-workings
of Myers Creek. . ,
To the south, Trentham, Newbery, Blue Mountain, Barry s
Reef, and Blackwood all lie in the same strike, the southern
extension being apparently the Lerderderg workings and Good-
man’s Creek, near Bacchus Marsh.
Ray wood, Sebastian, the Whipstick, Eaglehawk, and Sand-
hurst, north of the granite of the Big Hill Range, and south
thereof Taradale and Malmsbury, appear to constitute a distinct
belt, broken in continuity by the granite ; the northern extension
of this belt may be found under the plains beyond Raywood, and
the southern beneath the volcanic area around Kyneton.
In both the Castlemaine and Sandhurst belts there are great
probabilities of future valuable discoveries in the shape of auri-
ferous quartz reefs, both near the surface and at great depths.
This closes the list of the more important and well-marked belts
of auriferous country where Lower Silurian strata form the bed-
Heathcote, about the line of contact of the Lower and Upper
Silurian rocks, and the neighbouring gold-fields of Redcastle and
Costerfield, with those of Whroo, Graytown, and Rushworth,


further eastward, all in Upper Silurian strata, appear to form-
several small separate belts, the relations of which have not been
investigated.
Reedy Creek, Strath Creek, Diamond Creek, Warrandyte, and
other workings are all situated on what—judging from the
observed bearings of strike in various localities—is a curved belt
of rocks, the southernmost known auriferous locality on which is
near Templestowe.
The Ghin G-hin diggings, Yea, Higinbotham, and—to the south
of the granite and trap of the Watts Valley—Warburton and
Hoddle’s Creek appear to indicate another curved belt, though
the relations between the rocks of the various localities are
uncertain.
Proceeding eastward, the next belt is a very well-marked one,
the various gold-workings being situated along a zone of Upper
Silurian rocks, having a well-defined north-westerly strike. The
principal diggings are Merton, Gobur, Growlers, Spring Creek,
Alexandra, and the Acheron diggings, in the Goulburn drainage-
area, and north of the granite of the Main Divide, while to the
south are the workings of Cumberland Creek, the Upper Yarra,
Hawthorn, Pheasant and Russell’s Creeks, and Tanjil. Several
scattered gold-workings have been opened on either side of the
main line of this belt, such as Crossover, in Gippsland, the -work-
ings up the eastern branch of the Tanjil, and on the upper portion
of the Tyers, indicating the existence of other parallel strips of
auriferous country. There is a very good field for future mining
enterprise upon the course of the Merton to Tanjil belt, there
being a considerable extent of volcanic country on the Gippsland
side, which is likely to be underlaid by auriferous gravels, and
abundant scope for the prospector in quartz reefing. Most of the
known auriferous reefs on this belt are associated with diorite
dykes, which have an easterly and westerly direction across the
strike of the Silurian rocks.
The next well-defined auriferous belt is the most important in
the Upper Silurian country, and is nearly 100 miles in length.
On it are situated, in the Goulburn drainage-area, the Strathbogie
diggings, Maindample, Jamieson, Enoch’s Point, Gaffney’s and
Raspberry Creeks, Wood’s Point, and Matlock ; on the fall to-
wards Gippsland, BB Creek, Jericho, Aberfeldy, and Walhalla,
the latter place being celebrated for the Long Tunnel mine, the
premier quartz mine in Victoria. In nearly all. the quartz work-
ings along this belt the reefs accompany, or are intimately asso-
ciated with, diorite dykes having a direction coincident with the
strike of the Silurian rocks.
There is a fair field for the prospector in the many untested
portions of country intervening between the proved gold-workings
qn this zone.


The relation to other gold-fields of Foster and Turton’s Creek,
in South Grippsland, cannot well be indicated on account of the
great extent of country occupied by Mesozoic rocks which inter-
venes. It is by no means improbable that the lowest beds of the
Mesozoic strata, immediately resting on the Silurian rocks about
a line between Foster and Turton’s Creek, may consist of auri-
ferous conglomerates/
Turton’s Creek offers a tempting inducement to search for the
source from which the exceedingly rich alluvial gold found there
was derived.
A small belt in which the quartz reefs are not associated with
diorite dykes is formed by the Royal Standard Reef on the fall
towards the Gonlburn, and the Donnelly’s Creek Reefs in Gipps-
laud ; the extensions of this belt southward from Donnelly’s
Creek and northward from the Royal Standard have not been
discovered.
In the north-eastern part of the colony we have the great
auriferous belt which includes —on the fall towards the IMunay
the gold-fields of Rutherglen, Chiltern, Barnawartha, Eldorado,
Yackandandah, Beechworth, Stanley, Myrtleford, Bright, the
Buckland, Wandiligong, and the various workings along the
Ovens Valiev to Harrietville. On the Gippsland side—the-
Dargo and Cobnngra, Grant, Crooked River, the Wentworth,
Swamp Creek on the Mitchell, Boggy Creek, near Bairnsdale,
and other gold-workings. The Mitta Mitta and Dark River
workings, those of Omeo, Swift’s Creek, the Tambo and Nichol-
son Rivers, Zulu and Gibbo Creeks, and, in the east, Bendoc,
all demonstrate the existence of further zones of gold-beaiing
country, the northerly and southerly continuations and also inter-
mediate portions of which it would be desirable to test.
The above general description is only intended to roughly indi-
cate the main zones, each of which would, if examined, be found
to comprise a number of minor distinct belts, and each of these
a number of separate lines of auriferous quartz reef or
evidence of the existence of the latter in the form of auiifeious
alluvial deposits.
Along the lines of all the belts or of their extensions are un-
proved °tracts of exposed Silurian country in which surface
prospecting could be easily carried on, or areas covered with
sedimentary deposits and lava-flows, under which there would be
a fair chance of discovering fresh sources of gold supply. Atten-
tion may be drawn to the advisability of more careful exploiation
than has yet been made in search of lines of auriferous quartz
reef. The extent of proved auriferous alluvial ground is so very
laro-e, and it has been in many places so exceedingly rich, that
the* number of quartz reefs actually worked, and the extent to
which they have been developed, seem ridiculously smstll in


comparison. It is not an exaggeration to say that there are miles
in length of auriferous alluviums for every hundred yards of
worked quartz reef.
Making full allowance for the fact that the auriferous alluvial
•deposits are the results of the enormous denudation to which the
Silurian rocks have been subjected, and the disintegration with
them of an incalculable amount of auriferous quartz ; and further,
keeping in view that the portions of the reefs so denuded were
probably richer than what remain ; nevertheless the known ten-
dency of gold to remain stationary or simply to drop deeper, and
the fact of so many rich gullies and leads having been worked up
to ranges where the quartz reefs still remain practically untested,
all tend to justify the conviction that there are undeveloped stores
of wealth in our untried quartz reefs, and in the unexplored con-
tinuations of those that have been worked, far exceeding in
amount the yields hitherto obtained.
Admitting the principle that where there is an auriferous
alluvial deposit there is likely to be an auriferous matrix not far
distant, there is an unlimited field for exploration lying open for
mining enterprise, a field in which —though, as in other undertak-
ings, failures will be encountered—counterbalancing successes
will certainly reward patient and judiciously conducted search.
Other Metals.
Of metals other than gold there are few that do not occur iu
some form or other in Victoria, but although among these, silver,
copper, antimony, tin, lead, and iron have been found in various
localities in sufficient quantity to encourage efforts towards work-
ing them, no great successes have been achieved.
Antimony at Costerfield and Eingwood, copper at Walhalla
and Bethauga, stream tin in the Beechworth and Upper Murray
districts, and argentiferous lead ore at Buchan, have been worked
in some instances successfully, in others have proved failures.
No doubt in time our resources will become better developed;
but the fact cannot be gainsaid that in all metals except gold
Victoria is far poorer than the sister colonies ; on the other hand,
her pre-eminence in gold is likely to counterbalance the dearth of
other metals, and to assure to her for centuries to come a leading
position as a gold-raining country.


CHAPTER XY.
Remarks on the Coals and Lignites of Victoria .
In considering the question as to whether coal sufficient for
home requirements will ever be produced from Victorian mines, it
may be stated at the outset that we have not any exposed repre-
sentatives of the true Carboniferous rocks of Great Britain and
New South Wales: it is possible, but does not appear to be very
probable, that such rocks may exist concealed beneath the Meso-
zoic rocks, or beneath the Tertiary beds of the north-western part
of the colony ; their non-existence in any part of the main moun-
tain system of the country is an ascertained fact. The only rocks
in which exploration for coal can be carried on with any hope of
success are the Mesozoic rocks of the areas already described,
namely, the Wannon area, the Cape Otway area, or that lying
between the road from Geelong to Warrnambool on the north,
and the sea-coast on the south; and the Western Port and South
Gippsland Mesozoic area, or that lying between the Western Port,
Lang Lang, and La Trobe valleys on the north, and the sea-coast
on the south. It has already been shown that the Wannon and
Cape Otway beds may be continuous with one another beneath
the intervening Tertiary formations, and that the latter may ex-
tend for some distance under the great volcanic plains northward
from Colac.
As far as geological age is concerned, there is actually no reason
whatever why our Mesozoic rocks should not contain large and
payable seams of coal ; rocks of the same or even of more recent
periods do contain such seams in other countries.
Sir R. Daintree, in his work on the Geology of Queensland,
describes the Carbonaceous Mesozoic rocks of that country as
geologically identical with those of Victoria, and as containing
good workable coal seams on the east of the Dividing Range, where
apparently of lacustrine origin, though the marine beds on the west
of the divide appear to contain no coal.
The only question with us is, whether at any periods during the
deposit of our Mesozoic rocks the conditions for the formation of
large seams over wide areas were present; that they were to a
certain extent is proved by the seams which have been found, and
recent developments have tended to strengthen the belief that we
are not so poor in sources of coal supply as many are inclined to
imagine. Our main hopes are, however, centred in the Western
Port and South Gippsland Mesozoic area, where a tract nearly


equal in size to Northumberland has been proved to contain coal
seams at various localities round the edges, and also in the central
portions.
As regards the Cape Otway and Wannon districts the indica-
tions are not so favorable, though geologically their Mesozoic
rocks are identical with those of Gippsland and Western Port.
At Coleraine are small seams of an inferior description of coal,
the largest seam being about 20 inches in thickness. A small
seam of good coal exists near Colac, but it is not large enough to be
profitably worked, and of several diamond-drill bores put down in
the district to nearly 1,000 feet, not one revealed the existence of
another seam.
The deep bore at Portarlington, over 1,500 feet, passed through
no coal, though carbonaceous laminae occurred in all the cores of
rock brought up.
The same result attended the hore at Winchelsea, which was
carried to a depth of more than 2,100 feet.
Some small seams of good coal occur near Apollo Bay, but
have not heen sufficiently explored to admit of a definite opinion
being formed as to their probable value. Altogether, the pro-
spects of a workable coal-field west of Port Phillip are very
slender.
In the eastern Mesozoic area the evidences are of a far more
encouraging description, and, as before stated, there is a large tract
beneath which extensive coal mines are likely at no distant date to
be developed.
Concerning a number of the known and earlier discovered seams
of coal and their modes of occurrence, information will be found
in the Geological Progress Reports ; but I propose here to recapitu-
late the main features of that information, and can do no better
than repeat the description given in Progress Report No. VII.,
with additional observations as to discoveries and developments
effected since its publication.
Coal has been proved to exist in various localities throughout
the area under notice. Along its southern or coast boundary,
along the northern or inland margin, and at several places in
central portions.
Commencing at the coast-line, and proceeding south-easterly
from Griffith’s Point, the following are the principal known coal
seams :
The Sandy Waterholes seams are exposed in cliff section on
the coast, about 5 miles from Griffith’s Point, and are five in
number, all within a total thickness of 50 feet. The two middle
ones, 2 feet apart, are each from 18 inches to 24 inches thick, the
others being smaller; they dip inland, and it is stated that, in a
shaft now filled in, situated 100 yards back from the cliS, a seam
was cut which showed a thickness of 24 inches-of coal.


Deteriorated as they are by exposure on the face of the cliff, it
is difficult to pronounce with certainty on the quality of these
seams, but it appears likely to be very good if they are followed in ;
and as their extension inland could be tested for a few hundred
pounds, and they are within so short a distance of the shipping
place, they are certainly worthy of exploration.
The Kilcunda seam has been worked in from the face of the
cliff by means of an adit, and further inland from a shaft 100 feet
deep. Several “ faults,” one of which is a down-throw of 40
feet, dislocate this seam; but it has been followed from the shaft
along its strike (about W. by N.) for more than 1,000 feet without
a break.
The quality of the coal is excellent ; its thickness varies from
20 inches to 27 inches, or an average of barely 24 inches. The
“ holing ” is hard, and necessitates some waste in cutting ; but,
nevertheless, men of long and varied experience maintain that,
with proper management, this seam can be worked at a profit.
Its inclination is inland, somewhat E. of N. at 10°. Some 5,000
tons were raised and sent to Melbourne by the first company
which worked the mine, but proper arrangements for mining and
carriage were not perfected, and the undertaking collapsed. A
second company, formed under what appeared to be better auspices,
constructed a railway from the mine to the shipping place, and
sent a considerable quantity of coal to market, but gave up,
owing to the discouraging results of several diamond-drill bores
put down, at very ill-selected sites, to ascertain the extent and
trend of the seam prior to sinking a new main shaft, which was
found to be essential to the further development of the mine.
The ground is, therefore, at present lying unworked.
Of several diamond-drill bores put down in the neighbourhood,
one to the north of the mine proved a 20 to 24-inch seam at 165
feet, besides a number of small ones down to 873 feet. From
another bore, on Bridge Creek, 3 miles east of the mine, a
core showing 32 inches of coal was obtained at 490 feet, besides
other smaller ones above and below that depth.
Seven miles east from Kilcunda, a bore put down near the
Powlett River passed through two seams, one at 349 feet and
another at 687 feet, each about 30 inches in thickness, and con-
sisting of good coal.
The diamond-drill bores near Kilcunda, at the Bridge Creek, and
at the Powlett River, have satisfactorily established as a fact that
the coal seams are not mere patches.
The value of the information obtained by means of the last-
mentioned bore, as to the existence of two workable seams of good
coal, at easily accessible depths, and in nearly horizontal strata,
may in itself be regarded as an equivalent for all the expenditure
on diamond-drills since their introduction into the colony. The


statement made in a former report —that we had, at the time that
report was written, no guarantee as to the continuance of any
known coal seam beneath a single square mile —may now be with-
drawn. We have evidence of their continuance beneath many
square miles, and of the probable existence of many millions of
tons within a short distance of the surface, and within convenient
distance of a shipping place.
From the mouth of the Powlett River, 3 miles east from Kil-
cunda, for a further distance of some 4 miles, nothing is to be
seen of the rocks along the coast; but thence for 12 miles,
by Coal Creek and Cape Patterson to within a short distance of
Anderson’s Inlet, they are visible the whole way, and afford
excellent opportunities for observation.
At about the first exposure of rocks on the coast, travelling from
the Powlett towards Coal Creek, there are three small seams, and
further on a seam of about 10 inches of good coal with several
feet of black “ clod ” beneath it ; these are only visible at times
when the tide is low and the sand temporarily removed. About
this locality it is stated that a seam of 20 inches was proved
inland among the hummocks, but has since been obscured by
blown sand.
A mile westerly from Coal Creek is a coal seam of from 20 to
24 inches between two smaller ones of 4 inches each, all dipping
N.W. at 40°. This dip is exceptionally high and abnormal in
direction, the rocks on both sides, for some distance, dipping from
S.S.W. to S.S.E. at from 4° to 14°. In this locality, however,
much disturbance, variation of dip, and false bedding are visible
in the strata.
Two or three other small seams occur between here and Coal
Creek, west of the mouth of which are the two main seams, the
“ Rock ” and the “ Queen ” veins. Where exposed on the coast,
these seams dip W.S.W. at about 30°, but in a shaft (known as
Bury’s or Davis’ shaft) sunk through them a few chains inland,
the inclination is only 15°.
The section in the shaft is as follows : —Measures (sandstones,
shales, &c.), 57 feet. Upper coal seam —total thickness, roof to
floor, 30 to 36 inches, with irregular partings, reducing the avail-
able thickness of coal to about 24 inches.
Measures with a small 4-inch seam, 11 feet. Lower coal seam
—total thickness 42 inches, divided by impure bands into three
portions of 2\ to 3, 2\ to 3fc, and 22 to 24 inches respectively.
These measurements represent the general average, as no two sets
of measurements taken, whether in different parts of the shaft, or
on the coast outcrops, tally exactly, owing to variations in the
thickness of the coal and partings.
On the whole, I would estimate an available thickness of 24
inches of coal to be the average for each seam as now visible.


Eastward of Coal Creek, between it and Cape Patterson, the
basset-edges of some thirteen distinct seams are visible in the
rocks ; all have aS. to S.S.W. dip at about 12°; the largest of
these only is of workable size, and is from 20 to 24 inches thick ;
it was worked a short distance inland by the late Victoria Coal
Company, about twenty years ago, and yielded 1,900 tons of coal
before being abandoned on account of the difficulties of shipment.
At Cape Patterson, Mr. N. Levi has sunk a shaft, and cut the
coal seam worked many years ago by the Victoria Coal Company
—on the inland side of a disturbing fault—and though the avail-
able thickness of workable coal, so far as exposed, is rather small,
the quality is most excellent. The total thickness of the seam is
about 2ft. 6in., including impurities, but these may be expected to
disappear as the seam is traced inland, in which direction it has
been proved to extend, and to increase in size, by a number of
diamond-drill bores that have been put down. The last bore
passed through a seam of 43 inches, of which 2 feet was good,
and the rest somewhat impure.
About Coal Creek and Cape Patterson there are several large and
small basalt dykes, which intersect the rocks, and will assuredly
be found to locally affect and probably ‘ fault the coal seams.
The prevailing north-easterly dip of the ascending series of
rocks, visible from Cape Patterson towards Anderson’s Inlet, the
more regular and even character of the layers, and the absence of
dykes in that direction, are favorable indications that the large
Cape Patterson seams passing beneath them will found to
underlie a great area, and to continue tolerably persistent and
unbroken northward and north-eastward from Cape Patterson.
As pointed out long ago by Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn, the “Rock ”
and “ Queen*’ veins at Coal Creek are likely, from their south-
westerly or seaward direction of dip in that locality, to outciop
inland, assuming such direction of dip to be maintained; but, from
observations of the dips of the rocks generally along the coast, it
appears that the undulations of the beds are such that not only do
they incline north-eastward from Cape Patterson, but also change
their dip northerly from Coal Creek, and incline inland, as though
to pass under the lower part of the Powlett Valley.
Indeed, the idea that the Sandy Waterholes seams are the
western outcrops of the Cape Patterson seams, and that they
underlie the Kilcunda seam, is not so far-fetched as may at first
sight appear; but, nevertheless, the variable character and dip of
the rock-layers, and the absence of any markedly distinctive rock-
bands, forbid the adoption of any special theory,
In the ascending series of beds visible from Cape Patterson to
Anderson’s Inlet, there occur a few small coal seams, but, save one
of from 10 to 20 inches, none that appear likely to become of
importance.


At Foster, in the bed of Stockyard Creek, and close to the
boundary of the Silurian rocks, is a coal seam which possibly may
be worthy of more attention than has yet been bestowed upon it.
The coal itself is of fair quality, and as far as followed it dips
north-westerly in a succession of descending shelves, the thick-
ness of which increases downwards from 10 to 20 inches. Further
insight into the character of this seam could be obtained at very
small expenditure.
Between Foster and Port Albert the measures were proved in
bores to a considerable depth, and, it is stated, small seams of
coal were discovered more than twenty years ago.
Along the northern portion of the carbonaceous area there are
on the Bass River and in the adjacent ranges several outcrops of
coal seams up to 20 inches in thickness, some of which have not
yet received much attention. In the head of the Bear Creek, a
main branch of the Moe, is a seam (described in Progress Report
No. 111. as O’Mahoney’s seam) of excellent coal, though only 9
to 11 inches thick; this seam dips south-easterly at 32° (an
abnormally high angle, not likely to be maintained far), and, as it
shows signs of increase on its dip, is worthy of further trial.
In the extreme north of the carbonaceous area on Rintoul’s
Creek, 8 miles north of Traralgon, is a seam of bituminous
shale 10 inches thick, which yields a good illuminating oil, and
burns well, but leaves a strong residue of undiminished bulk. This
exposure is only the edge of the layer, as the Silurian rocks appear
a short distance up the creek; it dips south-easterly, and is very
likely to increase in thickness in that direction.
The Hazelwood seam outcrops on a branch of Billy’s Creek,
8 miles S.S.E. from Morwell.
In the width of a heading driven along it for a distance of 18
feet, the coal increases from 20 to 28 inches, with indications of
still further increase on its dip, which is to the S.E. at 27° (a high
rate of inclination, not likely to continue far).* The coal, as far
as proved, is soft, but burns well, caking and blistering strongly,
and appears likely to yield a very good coke.
The Moe coal seam is one of the most promising in Victoria ;
there are two exposures, about 2\ miles apart, and, though
not a matter of absolute certainty, these appear to be different
outcrops of the same seam. The western outcrop is at the
head of Mosquito Creek, 4 miles S.W. from Moe, on the fall
towards the Moe Swamp. Near the surface exposure only about
16 inches out of a total thickness of 24 to 28 inches is good
coal, but as followed beneath its proper roof, it improves, and
shows about 24 inches of good coal; this seam rests on a clay
* This seam has since been cut in a drive from a shaft sunk about 20
yards from the tunnel, and shows an average thickness of about 3 feet.


floor. The eastern exposure, in Messrs. Stephenson’s selections,
is in the head of a gully running into the northern tributary of the
Narracan ; here the coal has been followed from its outcrop
beneath its proper roof, and shows in the tunnel-face a thickness
of from 30 to 32 inches of first-class coal, with only one thin in-
significant clay parting ; it rests on a clay shale floor, and is
covered by a thick sandstone roof. The dip is southerly at about
10°, a direction and rate of inclination which carries the seam
under the Narracan Valley, where other exposures of coal, as now
being tested, are visible. One of these outcrops is in the bed of
the creek in the Narracan Valley Company’s ground, and, as far
as traced, shows a thickness of about 20 inches of good coal,
with indications of increase as followed in. This seam I consider
to be the Moe seam, and it rises to the southward on the south
side of the valley showing a synclinal “roll” in the measures.
The seam, 30 inches thick, which was struck at 117 feet in a
diamond-drill bore in the Narracan Valley, appears to underlie
the Moe seam.
On the Moe seam, in Mr, Stephenson’s selection, very satisfac-
tory exploration has been effected by the Moe Coal Mining
Company. From the outcrop, in a southerly direction for a
distance of half-a-mile, bores were put down at short intervals,
and, in each case, proved the continuance of the seam, and the
maintenance of its workable thickness and quality. A shaft was
sunk near the southernmost bore, and struck the seam, which
averaged 27 inches of good coal. An adit was then driven, and
met the coal seam on its southerly dip, the shaft being utilized for
ventilation. A level has since been extended for several hundred
feet along the coal, which varies from 20 inches to 30 inches in
thickness, and is, so far, only slightly displaced by a few trifling
faults, which will facilitate, rather than render difficult, the
working of the seam. There will be at least half-a-mile up the
incline of the seam, and probably 2 miles along its strike, to be
worked from the adit without expenditure for winding or pumping
machinery. Taking an average of 2 feet of coal, this gives over
2,000,000 tons available from the adit, and deliverable within a
few hundred yards at the Narracan Valley Railway, whenever
that line be constructed, and there is no reason to doubt that,
small as is the thickness of the seam, compared with those of
other coal-fields, the ease with which it can be mined and taken
direct to the railway trucks will enable the company, when in full
work, to realize a fair profit over and above working expenses,
royalty, and interest on outlay.
The Narracan Valley Company will be able to mine by means
of shafts the southern extension of the Moe seam ; and they have
also several outcrops in their ground of other coal seams of good
quality likely to attain workable dimensions when traced in from
their exposures.


In the central portion of the area, on or adjacent to a line from
Moe to Cape Patterson, are several coal outcrops, the most im-
portant of which is the Strzlecki seam, about 14 miles north from
Anderson’s Inlet.
There are two outcrops less than 2 miles apart, hut whether
of the same or of different seams is uncertain. The northern
exposure is on a western tributary of the Tarwin, near the divide
between that river and the Powlett.
In a cutting there is exposed, in a height of 7 feet, an aggregate
thickness of 3 feet of good coal, in three separate seams of 12
inches, 8 inches, and 24 inches respectively, the lower 18 inches
of the latter, or undermost seam, being very good indeed.
The southern outcrop is in a gully trending to the Powlett,
and here a short tunnel has revealed the existence of a seam (dis-
located to the extent of 3 feet in one place by a “ fault ”) con-
taining at the face of the tunnel an unbroken thickness of from
30 to 32 inches of excellent coking coal.
Whether the same or different seams, there is good reason to
believe that the coal exposed in these two outcrops underlies a
great area, and the discoveries made by means of so small an
amount of labour amply justify further research.
In the heads of the Tarwin, between the Strzlecki seam and
Moe, are several other outcrops, some of which show as much as
16 inches of good coal; but none of these, so far as lam aware,
have been in any way tested as to their extent.
The most important seam yet found in Victoria is the Mirboo
seam, the outcrop of which is in Berry’s Creek, about 2 miles
from the Mirboo Railway Station, on the property of Mr. William
Scarlett. A shaft sunk a short distance from the outcrop passed
through the seam at between 40 and 50 feet, and revealed a
thickness averaging 56 inches of solid coal. The seam dips at
the high angle of 32° in the shaft, but as the rocks exposed
at surface up the creek, in the direction of the dip, show a
much flatter inclination, it is certain that the seam will conform
thereto.
Considering its size, quality, and proximity to the railway line,
there appears no room for doubt as to the remuneratively workable
character of this coal seam if properly wrought.
The Boolara seam has recently been found in the bank of a
branch of the Morwell, about a mile and a half from the Boolara
Railway Station, and close to the Mirboo line of railway. This
seam is 3 feet thick, and though the upper portion is somewhat
impure near the outcrop it is of workable size. It is nearly hori-
zontal, and can be easily worked by means of an adit. It is quite
possible that this seam may be identical with the Mirboo seam,
though the distance between the two outcrops, and the paucity of
any data as to the dips and undulations of the rocks in the inter-
vening tract, forbids more than the mere conjecture.


The outcrops of the above-described coal seams occur dis-
tributed throughout an area which is, as before stated, nearly
equal to that of Northumberland, and is wholly occupied by rocks,
whose geological position, though more recent than that of the
true carboniferous rocks of England and New South Wales, is
well within the range of coal-bearing rocks generally. As com-
pared with those of the great coal-fields of the world, the coal
seams are small, with the exception of the Mirboo seam, the thick-
ness of which is regarded as about the most convenient known
for economical working.
The measures generally are much faulted, and are subject to
many variations of direction and rate of dip. Nevertheless the
explorations already made show that the known seams are not
mere patches, but extend over areas amounting in some cases to
several square miles,, with every indication of still wider exten-
sion. Some of these coal seams are of a thickness which, in
other coal-producing countries, even in Great Britain, is deemed
a workable size, provided the quality be good and the working
conditions favorable. The thickness here assumed as the work-
able minimum under most favorable circumstances is 16 inches of
marketable coal in one seam ; a standard far below the available
thickness of coal contained in most of our seams.
Of our known coal seams, the quality, almost without exception,
has been proved by analysis and experiment to be excellent; it is
more splintery and suffers more loss in carriage than the New
South Wales coal; but is, as a rule, superior to the latter for
steam, forge, and household purposes.
There are evidences to show the likelihood that our known seams,
even if they be but patches, are nevertheless patches of extent
considerable enough to admit of their being profitably wrought ;
and, in addition, there is no reason for supposing that the known
outcrops, due as they are to removal, by denudation, of overlying
strata, have all been laid bare at the best part of the seams they
belong to. Lastly, there are, in the Victorian carbonaceous series,
layers which do not appear at all, or whose extreme edges only
are to be seen at the surface.
Among these, there exists the possibility, as pointed out long
ago by Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn, of finding coal seams larger, and
more valuable than any of those known.
On the Kilcunda seam, which only averages barely 24 inches,
and where there is waste and difficulty in “ holing, ” owing to the
hardness of the floor, good miners could, when the mine was being
worked, make fair wages at 7s. per ton for screened coal, finding
their own powder, fuse, and candles, doing their own filling
and timbering, and making their own roads from the main
heading.


The coal of the Moe seam having a greater thickness, and a
better “ holing,” can be mined at a cheaper rate, while that of
the Mirboo seam, with its specially convenient thickness, should
be excavated for still less.
The general conclusion that I have arrived at is that, though
Victoria may never compete with New South Wales as regards
export trade, she nevertheless possesses within her own territory
resources of coal supply sufficient for the greater proportion of
her own wants. These resources will be more and more developed
with the extension of railways into South Gippslaud.
The main cause for doubt as to the coal from the small-sized
Victorian seams being mined at a profit consists in the fact, that
all coal produced in Victoria must be conveyed a greater or less
distance by railway, and it is possible that the cheaply-rained coal
from the large seams of New South Wales, conveyed by water
carriage from the mines to Melbourne, can be placed on the market
at a price which would not pay the Victorian coal miner. Against
this may be set the higher value of the Victorian coal for steam
and household purposes, and the power that could be exercised by
the State—without resorting to extreme protective measures —of
fostering the industry by conveying the product at a nominal rate
from the mines to Melbourne, along such railway lines as now
exist or may hereafter be constructed. This would probably be
found to work better than either imposing a duty on imported coal
or giving a direct bonus for that produced in Victoria.
Lignites.
Some of our lignite deposits may eventually prove of value.
The Lai Lai lignite does not seem to have found favour as a fuel,
but is uoav being utilized in the manufacture of an excellent
deodorant. The McKirley’s Creek lignite in G-ippsland is said
to yield per ton 6,000 to 8,000 feet of a gas which gives a light
equal in power to that of coal gas. There is likely to be found
an extensive deposit of this lignite beneath the volcanic country of
Neerim and Buln Buln.
Very extensive lignite deposits occur along the La Trobe, in the
Tarwin Valley, and along the foot of the ranges east of the Tarra
River in South G-ippsland. These may at some future date prove
valuable, either as fuel or sources of gas supply.
At Toongabbie is a bed of lignite, together with a layer re-
sembling a bituminous clay, which latter, on analysis, yields a
very high percentage of illuminating oil. It is, in fact, a sort of
kerosene shale, though of far more recent geological age than that
of New South Wales, being Upper Tertiary, whereas the latter is
Upper Palaeozoic in geological position.
