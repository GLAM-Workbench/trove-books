PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.
publication of this fourth edition seems to justify completely the expectation
originally expressed that the issuing of family articles in their then comparatively
incomplete state would bring forth, earlier than otherwise, fuller information by
those concerned. Herein, there is abundant evidence of such family interest.
Since the date of the preceding edition, 26 January 1943, several hundred
children have been born and consequently included in the record. From this source
alone the work will grow with the passage of time. Some additional families have
also been included, a plan that will be followed in each succeeding edition.
It does not yet seem to be understood that the original provision for regarding
certain descendants of a pioneer’s daughter as eligible for inclusion in the work was
revoked at the time of original publication. This opportunity is therefore taken
to repeat that eligibility for inclusion in Pioneer Families of Australia is limited
to families in the male line which arrived in any part of Australia before 1838.
The period of five years that has elapsed since the publication of the third
edition has increased the editorial work so much that it is now hoped to issue a
new edition at the end of every third year.
Copies of the Prefaces to previous editions have been inserted as Appendixes
to this edition in view of their advantage to fresh subscribers, but it is thought that
such provision will no longer be necessary when the work becomes better known.
The copyright covering the memoirs and the form of presenting the genealogical
information has not been relaxed, but exception will not be taken to excerpts therefrom
if suitable acknowledgment be made to their source.
This edition commemorates the 160th anniversary of the foundation of settlement
in Australia, at Sydney Cove, on 26 January 1788.

NOTE TO THE PRESENT REPRINT
It was the intention of my father, the late P. C. Mowle, to follow the fourth (1948)
edition with a new one every three years. When he died the copyright was left to me,
but unfortunately I have not had the time and opportunity to carry out his plan. Nor
could I find anyone else sufficiently interested to take on the somewhat tedious job of
bringing the book up to date, let alone adding more families as he intended.
Since the book has been out of print I have been asked by a number of people if
I would have the last edition reprinted. This has now been done, with the addition of
an index, which did not appear in the previous editions but which I think will be
useful. This particular index could have been half as large again, but by omitting
those names with initials only and nothing else to identify them, as well as those pro-
genitors and contemporary relatives of a Pioneer who did not themselves come to or
have any direct connection with Australia, I was able to confine it to 8,400 entries.
I should like to be able to promise further editions. The next edition may take
some years to produce; all 1 can say is that I am working to that end and would appreciate
hearing from any families who are able to bring their histories up to date.

PIONEER FAMILIES OF AUSTRALIA
a BECKETT.
Arthur Martin a Beckett, accompanied by his wife, arrived at Sydney on
14 November 1838, by the barque Lord Eldon. He was educated at London
University and after admission as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, on
9 March 1838, he decided to follow the advice of his eldest brother, who was
practising as a barrister of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and emigrate to
Australia. Upon arrival he submitted his “Diplomas and Testimonials” to the
Medical Board of New South Wales who, finding them to be satisfactory, caused his
name to be placed on its Register on 7 January 1839, and thenceforward he practised
as a Surgeon in Sydney with considerable success. On 13 May 1856 he was summoned
by the Governor to a Seat in the Legislative Council and nine days later was present
at the inaugural meeting of the First Parliament of New South Wales composed of a
Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly, which has become known as the
First Parliament under Responsible Government. He did not, however, serve for the
statutory period of five years, but went to reside in London for some years. On his
return to Sydney he resumed practice for a few years.

a BECKETT.
William a Beckett arrived at Sydney, with his wife and three children, on 23 May
1837, by the ship City of Edinburgh. He was immediately enrolled as a barrister of
the Supreme Court of New South Wales and on 20 March 1841 appointed Solicitor
General. On 15 July 1844 he was made an acting Judge of the Supreme Court
and continued so to act until 3 February 1846 when he was permanently elevated to
the Bench and to be “Resident Judge in and for the District of Port Phillip.” Upon
the establishment of the Colony of Victoria he was appointed Chief Justice and, in
1852, owing to the strain of the gold fever upon the population he felt obliged to
issue a cautionary pamphlet entitled, Does the discovery of gold in Victoria, viewed
in relation to its moral and social effects, as hitherto developed, deserve to be con-
sidered a national blessing, or a national curse? He retired from the Bench in 1857,
and returned to reside in England in 1863, where he published, in London, The EarVs
Choice, and other Poems. Previously, he had published The Siege of Dumbarton
Castle and other Poems; Lectures on the Poets and Poetry of Great Britain, with an
Introductory Lecture on Poetry, (Sydney, 1839), and The Magistrates Manual for the
Colony of Victoria (Melb., 1852). He was honoured with a knighthood in 1853.

ARNDELL.
Thomas Arndell, previously known as Arundell, arrived at Port Jackson with the
First Fleet, on 26 January 1788, having been appointed, on 25 October 1786, “Assistant
Surgeon to the Settlement within our Territory called New South Wales.” After
serving in this Office for five years, during which period he had, for nearly three years,
the direction of the hospital at Parramatta, he, being desirous of settling on the land
and obtaining from Governor Phillip a grant of 60 acres to further that object,
received permission from the Secretary of State, on 30 June 1793, to retire on a pen-
sion. On 1 April 1794, he received a grant of 70 acres of land in the Field of Mars
district and, in 1799, 100 acres in the Dundas district and a lease at Parramatta.
In 1801, he was possessed of 230 acres of land, made up of three grants from
the Crown, and 330 acres acquired by purchase from settlers, also 50 sheep, 20
hogs, 6 cattle and 4 horses, while on 14 June 1804, Governor King granted him 600
acres at the junction of Cattai Creek with the Hawkesbury River where he made his
permanent home under the name of Caddie (sometimes spelt Caddai) and where some
of his descendants still live. In 1799, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace at
Parramatta and, in 1801. for the Territory, and in a list, issued in August 1804, of
officers having principal charges and performing essential services without remunera-
tion, it is recorded that “Thomas Arndell has the inspection of all public affairs, under
the Governor’s directions, in the Hawkesbury and Nepean districts and performs the
duty of Magistrate.” On 1 December 1810, on behalf of the Hawkesbury settlers, he
presented a congratulatory address to Governor Macquarie on the occasion of his first
visit to the district.

BAYLY.
Nicholas Bayly arrived at Sydney with a detachment of the New South Wales
Corps as an Ensign. In a return of December 1801 he is set down as possessing grants
of land aggregating 631 acres, 30 of which were cleared and 8 under maize and wheat.
In December 1805 he was appointed Receiver of Quit Rents and in 1808 retired from
the Army on the rank of lieutenant, to which he had been promoted in 1802. In June
1809, he was given the position of Naval Officer (Collector of Customs) which he held
until the assumption of Office by Governor Macquarie, on 1 January 1810, who had
received instructions to displace all officers appointed by the subverters of the Bligh
government. During the next decade, he gave undivided attention to pastoral pursuits
on “Bayly Park,” his estate of about 2500 acres, at South Creek, about 15 miles
from Parramatta. In September 1820 he was appointed secretary to the Bank of New
South Wales and held that position until his death in May 1823.

BELL.
Archibald Bell was appointed an Ensign in the New South Wales Corps on 11
December 1806 and arrived at Sydney to take up duty on 7 July 1807 by the Young
William. In consonance with an instruction by the Secretary of State concerned he
was placed in possession of 500 acres of land on or before 31 October 1807 but a
valid deed of grant was not issued until 1 January 1810 owing mainly to the suspension
of the lawful Bligh government. The deed provided that this property, situated in
the District of Richmond Hill, was “to be known by the name of Belmont.” At the
same time a deed of grant for a further and adjoining 1,000 acres was issued in his
favour in recognition of his public services in the Richmond Hill district during two
destructive floods at the Hawkesbury River: this grant was called “Wormley Bury.”
Upon the recall to England of the 102nd Regiment, formerly the New South Wales
Corps, he was transferred, as a lieutenant —having been promoted to that rank on
15 October 1807—to the recently formed Veteran Company. A few months later he
sailed for England in the Admiral Gambier in connection with the occurrences that
had led to the deposition of Governor Bligh and upon returning to Sydney on 18
January 1812 by the ship Guildford he resumed wool-growing at “Belmont.” Two
months later he was placed in charge of a detachment of the Veteran Company at
Windsor. In 1820 he was appointed a magistrate for the county of Cumberland and
in the following year for the territory of New South Wales. He was appointed
Police Magistrate at Windsor on 16 November 1825 and had a seat in the Legislative
Council of New South Wales from 25 September 1832 until his death on 23 April 1837.

BETTINGTON.
James Brindley Bettington arrived at Sydney on 19 December 1827 by the brig
lonia. He at once commenced and for many years carried on the business of a
shipping agent. Becoming closely identified with the mercantile interests of the
community he was elected, in December of the following year, to the directorate of
the Bank of New South Wales, upon which he remained for many consecutive years.
He was appointed to the magistracy of the Territory in 1831 and during the period
1851-53 represented the “Pastoral Districts of Wellington and Bligh” in the Partly
Elective and Partly Non-elective Legislative Council of New South Wales. In 1834-
39 he acquired many purchase grants for pastoral purposes giving to those contigu-
ously situated in the county of Brisbane the name “Brindley Park” which had been
provided for in the deed of grant for a comparatively small area near Merriwa.
This property was considerably enlarged in subsequent years.

BLAXLAND.
Gregory Blaxland arrived at Sydney on 11 April 1806 by the William Pitt. On
5 February 1807 he purchased “the Brush farms” comprised of nine original grants
aggregating 455 acres in the Field of Mars district. Here he made his home and in
1816 established a vineyard principally with stock grown from cuttings he had brought
from the Cape of Good Hope. In 1813, he, in company with W. C. Wentworth and
William Lawson, and attended by four servants, discovered a practicable route for a
road over the Blue Mountains from the Nepean River to Mount York. The expedition
left “Lee Home,” his farm of 2,000 acres on South Creek, on 11 May in the morning
and a few hours later crossed the Nepean River at Emu Island, reached and named
Mount York on 28 May and a point six miles beyond it —subsequently named Mount
Blaxland—on 31 May. The party returned to the Nepean River on 6 June following.
Governor Macquarie immediately ordered one of the Assistant Surveyors (G. W.
Evans) to extend and report on the discovery and such report resulted in the building
and completion, in 1815, of a carriage road as far as Bathurst. He was appointed, on
14 November 1825, a Justice of the Peace, and, in August 1826, to the Committee of
the Agricultural Society of New South Wales, which had been established in 1822.
He visited England during the period 1822-24, and again in 1827-29. On the first
occasion he personally received for wine, the produce of “Brush Farm” vineyard, the
Silver Medal of the Society for Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce,
and, on the second occasion, the Gold Ceres Medal of that Society.

BLAXLAND.
John Blaxland with his wife and five children arrived at Sydney on 3 April 1807
by The Brothers, 252 tons, 8 guns and 21 crew, jointly owned by himself and Hulletts
Brothers & Co., of London, On 24 April he received a grant of 1,290 acres of land
—“to be called ‘Newington’ ” —upon which he resided for many years. The property
was situated between the Parramatta Road and the River of that name, with
Hacking's (afterwards Haslem’s) Creek on the east and Duck River on the west.
Apart from this grant, Governor Bligh, apparently having no official instruction,
was not prepared to allow him land, cattle and other indulgences represented to
have been agreed upon with the Governmnt before leaving England, and he therefore
returned Home by the Rose on 15 September 1808 to endeavour to obtain redress. His
mission was successful and the Governor (Macquarie) was authorized, on 26 July
1811, to give effect, under certain conditions, to the original agreement. This was
carried out, on 30 November 1813, by granting 6,710 acres in the Bringelly district, to
be called “Luddenham.” In 1812, he was appointed a member of the Court of Civil
Jurisdiction, in 1822 a Justice of the Peace for the territory, and in the same year to
the committee of the newly-formed Agricultural Society of New South Wales. On
8 March 1831 he was granted 10,240 acres, divided into 2,560 acres, in the county of
Northumberland and 7,680 acres in the county of Brisbane, by direction of the Secre-
tary of State, “in compensation for losses sustained in the straying of certain valuable
horses and mares into the Cowpastures at a time when the regulations prevented him
from taking the necessary steps to recover them,” and also “for injury sustained in not
obtaining from Government the full number of mechanics (sic) which, on leaving
England, he had been led to expect he should receive on his arrival in the colony.”
He was a member of the Legislative Council from 30 January 1829 until the proclama-
tion of a new constitution on 5 January 1843, and a non-elective member of the partly
elective and partly non-elective Council from 17 July 1843 until 13 September 1844,
when he retired.

BRADLEY.
Jonas Bradley arrived at Sydney with a detachment of the New South Wales
Corps, afterwards the 102nd Regiment of Foot. Upon the recall of that regiment to
England, in 1810, he decided to remain in the colony and become a settler. After
leasing farms in the Hawkesbury, Parramatta and Bathurst districts, he was authorized
by Governor Brisbane, on 30 April 1825, to enter into possession of 2,000 acres of land
in the present-day parish of Towrang, county Argyle. This prospective grant, called
“Lansdowne,” was alienated on 8 March 1831 on payment of five shillings an acre.
Additional and adjoining areas aggregating 1,036 acres were granted on 7 April 1839.
He distinguished himself as the first successful grower of tobacco in Australia, for
which he was awarded, in 1822, the First Prize of the Australian Agricultural Society.

BUSBY.
John Busby arrived at Sydney on 24 February 1824 by the Triton, accompanied
by his wife and four sons and one daughter: bis eldest son, George, following on 29
May 1825 by the Elizabeth. His experience as a mineral surveyor and civil engineer
in Scotland, where he had completed a mineral survey of crown lands in Caithness,
and provided a water supply for Leith fort, and also his connection with other public
works, notably the Caledonian canal and Stirling castle, enabled the Secretary of
State, in regard to his application to proceed to New South Wales in his professional
capacity, to advise the Governor that he could be employed as “mineral surveyor and
civil engineer,” for 200 days a year for three years with liberty to continue his services,
if required, for two years longer. Shortly after his arrival he surveyed and reported
upon the coalfields at Coal River, in Van Diemen’s Land, and at Newcastle, Singleton
and Maitland. In 1827 he devised a scheme of water supply for Sydney by undertak-
ing to bring water from Lachlan Swamp, situated at the southern side of the present-
day Centennial Park, to the south-east corner of Hyde Park, by a tunnel, subsequently
determined to be of a length of 12,000 feet or nearly 2\ miles. The average width of
the tunnel was 4 feet and the average height 5 feet. Although the tunnel was under
construction for 10 years it began to supply Sydney with water in 1830, while the de-
signer’s expectations were eventually fulfilled by a flow of from three to four hundred
thousand gallons a day. In accordance with the Secretary of State’s sanction he was
given a town grant of 8 acres 3 roods 23 perches on 19 October 1831, to be called
“Rockwall,” in the parish of Alexandria, co. Cumberland, and on 2 April 1835, 2,000
acres on the Hunter River, co. Northumberland, subject to a quit rent of £l5 per annum
for ever.

CAMPBELL.
Alexander Campbell sailed from England in November 1837 in the Earl of
Harewood and arrived in Port Jackson on 24 February 1838. He at once entered
the office of Grose and Street, merchants and shipowners, remaining with them until
he began business on his own account in 1840. In 1844 he, with James Nelson Smith,
established the mercantile firm of Smith, Campbell & Co., which became the represen-
tatives in Australia of the well known London house of Duncan Dunbar & Sons, ship-
owners. He remained in this firm until 1856, when he retired. He was a founder of
the Mercantile Bank of Australia (first as a private bank, but later incorporated by
Act of Parliament) and took part in its management in its early years. He was also
a promoter, and a first Director of the Sydney Royal Exchange, and an early supporter
of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, of which he was a Director for some
years. In 1860 he was elected unopposed as a member of the Legislative Assembly
of New South Wales for the Williams electorate, but did not seek re-election upon the
next appeal to the country. In 1864 he was appointed a member of the Legislative
Council of New South Wales, and on 30 August 1882 he became Postmaster-General
in the Parkes Ministry, and its Representative in the Legislative Council. On 30 July
1890, owing to failing health, he resigned his membership of the Council.

CAMPBELL.
Robert Campbell arrived at Sydney, on 10 June 1798, by the Hunter, in order to
establish an agency of the mercantile firm of Campbell, Clark & Co., of Calcutta.
In furtherance of this object he purchased the leases of two blocks of land on the
western side of Sydney Cove, subsequently converted into a grant of 3 acres 3 roods,
with a water frontage of about 860 feet, in consideration of his having erected thereon
substantial and handsome buildings. He was appointed a Magistrate and Naval
Officer (virtually Collector of Customs) by Governor Bligh on 2 May 1807, but
these appointments were annulled by the usurpers of the Bligh Government in January
of the following year. Although he was reinstated in both offices by Governor
Macquarie, he resigned them on 31 March 1810, realizing, as regards the Naval
Officership, the incompatibility of a merchant holding such a position. For his “zeal,
fidelity and attention” in conducting these offices the Governor notified his approba-
tion in a Government and General Order. On 29 October 1834, he belatedly received
a grant of 5,000 acres at Limestone Plains in part compensation for the loss of his
ship, the Sydney, whilst she was on the service of the Government of New South Wales
in 1806. The grantee and his sons used this property, named “Duntroon,” for pastoral
purposes for about seventy years and, in 1910, it became merged into the Australian
Capital Territory, the homestead forming the nucleus of the Royal Military College.
He was a member of the Legislative Council from 17 July 1825 to 5 January 1843.

CAPE.
William Cape, after spending many years as a bank manager in Lombard Street,
London, and afterwards as a tea merchant, decided, owing to the disastrous effects of
the Napoleonic wars, to migrate to Tasmania. Accordingly, he left England on New
Year’s Day and arrived at Hobart Town on 17 May 1822 by the Denmark Hill with his
wife and four sons and three daughters. Immediately proceeding to Sydney to
institute legal proceedings for the recovery of damages from the master of a ship he
had originally contracted with for certain accommodation on the voyage to Australia
and who had violated such contract, he, whilst there, decided to settle in New South
Wales and temporarily to take up the teaching profession in conjunction with his
eldest son who had accompanied him from Tasmania. He consequently removed his
family from Hobart Town, in June 1823, and then acquired and re-opened a school
called “The Sydney Academy,” but after a few months accepted the Mastership of
the Sydney Public School and continued in this position until June 1826. He also
turned his attention to the original purpose of migrating to Australia—the cultivation
of the land for which he had been ordered 2,000 acres. Actually, he had selected this
area near Launceston early in 1823, but having failed to occupy the land his claim
was forfeited. However, “in fulfilment of a promise made on or before 7 November
1825,” he was immediately placed in possession of 1,000 acres near Wyong, county of
Northumberland, the location shown in the deed of grant belatedly issued on 13
January 1841. He was also promised on 23 July 1828, and placed in possession on
7 October 1828, of an additional 640 acres “in satisfaction of all claims he may have
for the land originally ordered for him in Van Diemen’s Land,” This deed, which
located the land at Wyong Hill, was issued on 18 February 1840. These lands,
flanking a grant of 500 acres to his eldest son, provided a family property with front-
ages to the Jilliby Jilliby Creek and Wyong River which was chiefly used for raising
stock.

CHISHOLM.
James Chisholm arrived at Sydney with a detachment of the New South Wales
Corps on 14 October 1791 by the transport Britannia. Electing to remain in Australia
when the Corps—which, in the meantime, had been numbered the 102nd of the Line—
was recalled to England, in 1810, he obtained a licence to follow the calling of a wine
and spirit merchant, the business developing into that of a general merchant. He was
elected a director of the Bank of New South Wales on 10 December 1828 and remained
on the board without intermission. For some years he was a trustee of the Savings
Bank—established in 1819—and also the Sydney Free Grammar School. On 31
August 1819, he obtained a grant of 57 acres, “in the district of Sydney,” situated
immediately south-west of the present-day Redfern railway, station, the property
becoming known either as “Newtown Farm” or “Calder House.” Subsequently,
he acquired for business purposes a purchase grant of 1 a. 2 r. 31 p. on the eastern
side of George Street, Sydney, the deed fixing the eastern boundary at “the Stream of
Tanks.” He also obtained purchase grants in the rural districts of Argyle, Upper
Minto, Melville and Parramatta and increased their areas by private purchase. In
these districts, in the middle thirties, he possessed about 13,800 acres.

CLOSE.
Edward Charles Close arrived at Sydney on 3 August 1817 by the Matilda, with
a detachment of the 48th Regiment. Born in India, he was taken to England in 1798
and on 8 February 1808 received an ensign’s commission in the 48th (or Northampton-
shire) Regt. of Foot; served as lieutenant and adjutant in the Peninsular War, being
present at the battles of Talavera, Busaco, Albuera, Vittoria, Nivelle, Orthes and
Toulouse. After arrival in New South Wales, he continued in military service for
four years and then obtained grants of land aggregating 2,610 acres on the Hunter
River, where he settled. The township of Morpeth was laid out upon this property,
somewhat later. With the aid of Government labour, he gradually brought his alluvial
land under cultivation, establishing farms supporting a tenantry; also building the
house (known as “Closebourne,” afterwards Bishopscourt) which, in 1848, became
the Diocesan residence of the first Bishop of Newcastle (Dr. Wm. Tyrrell) and of
subsequent bishops. He was a member of the Legislative Council during the period
1829-1837 and was the first Police Magistrate of the Maitland district, and its Warden;
the first President of the Maitland hospital, and first district engineer for Newcastle.
He gave the site for, and, at his sole charge, built St. James's Church, Morpeth.
Remarkable for his practical Christianity and benevolence, he was revered by all
classes. Locally known as “The Father of the Hunter,” he received various public
testimonials—notably a presentation of plate, upon his resignation, in 1852, of the
Wardenship of the Maitland district. A handsome East Window, of five lights, was,
after his decease, erected to his memory in the Church he built.

COWPER
William Cowper arrived at Sydney on 18 August 1809, by the brig Indispensable,
with the appointment of Assistant Chaplain to the settlements in New South Wales.
A few days after arrival a Government Order notified that he had been temporarily
stationed at Sydney and appointed to the committee of the Orphan Fund. Later on,
he was directed to take part in the management of other benevolent associations and
on 15 September 1810 was made resident chaplain at Sydney—the parish of St.
Philip. He visited England in 1842-43 for treatment of his eyes and whilst there the
Archbishop of Canterbury conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of
Divinity in appreciation of his long and faithful services to the Church in Australia.
In January 1848, he was appointed to the newly-created Archdeaconry of Cumberland
and on 1 May following he laid the Foundation Stone of the second and present
Church of St. Philip, to the building fund of which he contributed £5OO. He had the
satisfaction of preaching the first sermon in the completed building on 30 March 1856.
In 1852, he acted as the commissary of the Bishop of Australia during his absence in
England. Upon his death, in 1858, a public funeral was accorded him by the
Government, at which there were present the governor-general, the judges, officials of
the Diocese and University, members of Parliament, and the leading civil officers and
clergy of all denominations.

William Cox, after serving as an ensign in the 117th Foot and 68th Foot, was
appointed to a lieutenancy in the New South Wales Corps on 28 September 1797 and
while holding this rank arrived at Sydney on 11 January 1800, by the Minerva, in
charge of a detachment of troops. The possession and management of farms being
then compatible with military duties, he commenced pastoral pursuits at “Brush
Farm,” in the Field of Mars district, and at “Canterbury Vale,” in the Petersham
Hill district, afterwards removing to the more fertile Hawkesbury district, in which
he was appointed a Justice of the Peace and Magistrate on 27 October 1810. His
appointment found great favour in the district, inasmuch as the settlers, in an address
to Governor Macquarie, on his first visit thereto, on 1 December 1810, expressed
their “unfeigned thanks” and conviction that it would promote His Excellency’s
“benign intention of distributing justice and happiness to all.” In 1814, he was
requested by Governor Macquarie to construct a road over the Blue Mountains, from
the Nepean River, near Emu Plains, to Bathurst, a distance of about 102 miles, the
route to follow that recently discovered by Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson. With
the assistance of a party of 30 artisans and labourers, he built the road in the short
period of 27 weeks, the work having been commenced on 17 July 1814 and completed
on 21 January following. In 1816, he enlarged his pastoral enterprises by obtaining
three grants aggregating 1,120 acres on the Mulgoa Creek, near Bringelly, and in the
following year a contiguous area of 760 acres. On 5 April 1821 he obtained a grant
of 850 acres on the Nepean River in the district of Evan, and on 30 June 1823, two
grants, one of 2,000 acres and the other of 1,000 acres, in the county of Roxburgh,
the former near Peel and the latter near Melrose. In 1823, he was elected Vice-
President of the recently formed Agricultural Society.

laid out Newcastle and was almost exclusively employed in the Hunter River district,
upon which he became a recognized authority. He visited England in 1827 and
whilst there published that which may be briefly described as The Hunter River
Directory and Emigrants’ Guide 1828. Whilst in England he married and also joined
the staff of the Australian Agricultural Company as a surveyor. Returning to Sydney
with his wife and child on 16 April 1830 by the brig Elizabeth he proceeded to Port
Stephens and from those headquarters of the company was actively employed for
three years in connection with its very extensive grants in the counties of Gloucester
and Parry. In 1833, he abandoned his professional calling and entered upon pastoral
pursuits at “Neotsfield,” a grant of 700 acres on the Hunter River near Singleton
promised on or before 7 September 1821. He added considerably to this property and
also obtained large estates in other parts of the Hunter River district. He was an
elected member of the Legislative Council for the county of Northumberland in
1845-48 and 1848-51.

chaplain in New South Wales and upon arrival was placed in charge of Pitt Town,
with provision for performing Divine Service at Wilberforce and Sackville Reach.
At the end of 1837 he was transferred to the Illawarra district with headquarters at

DOWLING.
James Dowling, accompanied by his wife and six children, arrived at Sydney on
24 February 1828, by the ship Hooghly, 425 tons. He had been called to the Bar at
the Inner Temple in 1815 and during the practise of his profession became well
known as a Court reporter and the co-author of Dowling and Ryland’s law reports.
This further experience justified his applying “for some judicial or other professional
appointment in any of the British colonies.” He was first offered the chief justiceship
of Sierra Leone or Dominica, but subsequently accepted a puisne judgeship in New
South Wales for which a Commission under the Great Seal was issued on 6 August
1827. He presented this commission to the Governor on the day after arrival and it
was read at an imposing and formal ceremony at Government House by the acting
registrar of the Supreme Court. In April 1836 he was appointed to act as chief
justice during the absence, in England, of Sir Francis Forbes who was obliged to
retire, owing to continued ill-health, in the following year, 30 June 1837. James
Dowling was then appointed chief justice on 30 August 1837 and was knighted in 1839.
He continued to hold the chief justiceship, and, by virtue of that office, a seat in the
Legislative Council, until his death, which occurred a few weeks prior to his projected
departure for England on eighteen month’s leave of absence for health reasons.
In reporting his death to the Secretary of State for the Colonies the governor recorded
that “marked respect has been paid to the memory of Sir James Dowling by all
classes of persons in the Colony, and his loss is very generally regretted.”

FAITHFULL.
William Faithfull arrived at Sydney on 14 January 1792 by the Pitt, with a
detachment of the New South Wales Corps. In 1799, and again in 1800, he received
a small grant of land in the district of Petersham Hill and on 1 November 1808 was
placed in possession of 1,000 acres in the district of Liberty Plains, with Cook’s River
as the southern boundary. In 1815, after the Liverpool road had. been carried through
the grant, he sold the portion on the northern side of the road, amounting to 300 acres,
and exchanged the southern portion for three areas of land, aggregating 600 acres, in
the Minto district. He then acquired and settled upon a property of 500 acres near
Richmond, called “Jordan Hill,” and three years later, in 1818, acquired the adjoining
estate of 700 acres by negotiating therefor the lands at Minto. Here, in conjunction
with other properties in the district obtained by purchase, he continued his pastoral
enterprises. In fulfilment of a promise of 22 January 1820, he was granted 800 acres
of land on the Mulwarree Chain of Ponds, in the present-day parish of Mangalore,
county Argyle, on 15 August 1834.

GIBLIN.
Robert Wilkins Giblin accompanied by his wife and eight children, four sons and
four daughters, arrived at Hobart Town, Van Diemen’s Land, on 3 January 1827, by
the ship Sir Charles Forbes. Accredited by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
Earl Bathurst, to Lieutenant Governor Arthur, he opened a college for boys at
Kangaroo Point, near Hobart Town, but gave this up when appointed by the
Lieutenant Governor to take charge of the Queen’s Orphan School for boys in Hobart
Town. He remained in this position for about five years, but differences of opinion
between himself and the visiting Committee regarding methods of control culminated
in a complete rupture. He then opened a school for boys at Newtown, near Hobart
Town, which he carried on with considerable success until his death in 1845, and not
a few of those who afterwards contributed to the building up of the Colony, whether
as private citizens or in some public capacity, received their training from its Head.

GIBSON.
Andrew Gibson, an assistant surgeon in the British Army, arrived at Sydney on
8 December 1826, by the John Barry, to take up similar rank in the Royal New South
Wales Veteran Companies. After six months service therein, he was transferred to
the Civil Establishment as an Assistant Colonial Surgeon and in this fresh position
spent two years. Then, deciding to adopt a life on the land and having already
obtained the promise of a substantial grant for such purpose, he resigned his civil
appointment on 16 February 1829 and settled on 2,560 acres at “Mulwarree Chain
of Ponds,” later Goulburn Plains; this area, called in the deed, “Tirranna,” passed
into a primary grant on 9 April 1835. Adjoining areas of 810 acres were obtained
on 8 April 1834; 897 acres on 15 December 1835; 1,056 acres on 10 December 1836
and 2,000 acres on 4 July 1837. He and some of his descendants have used this
property for pastoral purposes ever since.

HARRISON.
Robert Harrison, with his wife and five children, arrived at Hobart Town on
26 September 1823 by the Mariner. Intending to continue husbandry in Tasmania
he shipped thirty-four merino sheep, but owing to tempestuous weather encountered
in rounding the Cape of Good Hope, he landed seventeen only. With these forming
the nucleus of a high class flock he further advanced his venture by obtaining a grant
of 2,000 acres, called “Woodbury,” five miles from the town known later as Oatlands.
In 1828, in applying for an extension of grant, he stated that he had imported more
merino rams and some ewes of the same breed, that he had started the erection of a
stone dwelling house and also had enclosed 300 acres; had 53 acres in crop, had
100 pure merinos, 1,600 highly improved sheep and 1,000 “improved in a less
degree” and rented 5,540 acres from various persons. He belatedly received 1,000
acres, the extension requested, by way of grant, adjoining “Woodbury.” At the first
Midland Agricultural Show held on 2 October 1839 he was presented with an
inscribed Cup for “the best five finest woolled Rams in Ist Class.”

KEMMIS.
Arthur Kemmis arrived at Sydney in 1828 bearing a letter to the Governor of
New South Wales in which he was recommended to His Excellency’s protection by
the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Soon after his arrival he embarked his
capital in the Sperm Whale Fishery and after some difficulty he and a partner obtained
a grant of acres of land on the North Shore of Port Jackson upon which to erect
a wharf and sheds in connexion with the venture. He engaged himself in various
enterprises. Generally, much of his time was spent in pastoral affairs in the Bathurst
district and he also followed mercantile pursuits at Port Phillip where he founded
a Steam Navigation Company. He was appointed a magistrate of the Territory, and
obtained a purchase grant of 840 acres of land in the present-day parish of Groveland
in the county of Georgiana on 5 September 1838.

LAMB.
John Lamb, after resigning from the Royal Navy in which he had served from 1801
as a midshipman and from 1808 as lieutenant, arrived at Sydney on 6 May 1829 by
the brig Resource. He immediately established the mercantile firm of Lamb, Buchanan
& Co., and to promote the interests of the company he obtained, on 31 December 1834,
a grant of 2 roods 35£ perches of land on the eastern shore of Darling Harbour, and
on 25 February 1836, an adjoining area of 1 rood 16 perches. He was also granted
on 13 December 1837, 35£ perches in Elizabeth Street, Sydney, and on 29 April 1837,
2,560 acres, in the parish of Bherwerre, county St. Vincent, “in consequence of his
service in His Majesty’s Navy during upwards of twenty years,” and of which he had
been authorized to take possession on 20 May 1830. Upon the establishment of the
Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, in 1834, he was elected deputy chairman
of directors, and re-elected on three occasions, whilst in 1839 he was elected chairman
and remained in that position for many years. He was a non-elective member of the
Legislative Council of New South Wales (1844-51); an elected member for the
electoral district of the City of Sydney (1851-58), and a member of the Legislative
Council (“Quinquennial”) from 9 July 1857 to 10 May 1861, when he resigned.
Under an Order-in-Council of 1 November 1830 he took rank as a retired commander
in the Royal Navy from 7 May 1846.
GENEALOGY.
Captain Lamb, of the Honourable East India Company, was descended from a Border family. During
the Napoleonic wars his ship, in 1798, was attacked by the French privateer Clarisse, which he beat
off and then brought his own ship safely to London. In recognition of this service the merchants of
London presented him with a service of plate, while the English Government granted three of his
sons commissions in the Navy. These were taken up by John (of whom presently), William and
James; Edward, the fourth son, joining the Honourable East India Company’s Service.

Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur arrived at Sydney, with his uncle, John Macarthur,
on 9 June 1805, by the ship Argo. After farming for three years at “Chudleigh,” a
grant of SCO acres on South Creek, in the district of Cabramatta, he went to China
with a consignment of sandal-wood, on behalf of his uncle, thence proceeding to
England where he arrived at the end of 1810. He married whilst in England and, in
1812, returned to Sydney accompanied by his wife. He then purchased, “as a place
of residence,” “The Vineyard,” a farm of 140 acres on the northern bank of the
Parramatta River, near the City of that name, and on 9 July 1822, enlarged its area by
a purchase grant of 160 acres. On 1 November 1822, he obtained, for pastoral
purposes, a purchase grant of 1,000 acres in the present-day parish of Eden Forest,
county Argyle, named in the deed, “Arthursleigh,” and, in enlargement of this
property, he subsequently obtained purchase grants of 1,000 acres; 3,140 acres; six

MEREWETHER.
Edward Christopher Merewether arrived at Sydney in 1838. He was appointed
Aide-de-Camp (Civil) to Governor Sir George Gipps on 1 January 1842 and held
that position until he became Colonial Aide-de-Camp to Governor Sir Charles
Fitzroy, on 12 August 1846. Upon the establishment of the New Settlement of
North Australia he was appointed to the position of Chief Clerk—virtually Colonial
Secretary—on 1 December 1846, but the abandonment of the settlement led to his
appointment, on 4 December 1847, as a Commissioner for Crown Lands beyond the
boundaries of Location for the district of Lower Darling. On 1 March 1848, he was
transferred to the Macleay River and after spending six years in that district was
recalled to Sydney to act as Inspector of Distilleries. Early in 1856, he was again
appointed a Commissioner for Crown Lands and also Police Magistrate in the New
England and Macleay districts. On 17 October 1856, he received the appointment
of Clerk to the Executive Council and whilst occupying that position he proceeded
to England, at the end of 1858, as Government Agent to negotiate and assist in bring-
ing to a successful issue, a contract for a Steam Postal Service with the United
Kingdom, via Panama, for which authority had been given by Act No. 16 of 1858
of the New South Wales Parliament. Such a service was, however, abandoned.
During his visit to England he was requested to take up the office of Superintendent
of the Australian Agricultural Company which he filled from 1 October 1861 to 31
December 1875.

MINCHIN.
James Minchin, accompanied by his wife and five children, left Portsmouth for
Western Australia before the foundation of the Colony (1 June 1829) and arrived
at Fremantle on 12 October 1829. He built his first home in the town of Perth.
On 13 November 1829 he was given permission to obtain a grant of 1211 acres on the
Upper Swan River, and pursuant thereto acquired a farming, grazing, and wine
growing property, the purchase of which was completed by his third son, Alfred.
This property remained in the family until 1946. He died by misadventure at the
early age of 38 years and was buried on the bank of the River. His widow, together
with all their children except Alfred, afterwards went to the eastern colonies. As the
centenary of his death approached, a tablet to his memory was, by permission of the
Archbishop of Perth, placed by his descendants in the Upper Swan Church—founded
in 1839, two years after his death—there having been neither church nor churchyard
in the district in 1837. The inscription on the tablets reads:—“ln memory of
James Minchin who came to the Swan in the ship Caroline 12 October 1829. Buried
on this river bank 20th July 1837 beside five other settlers who were killed by natives
before this Church was built. Aged 38 years. Descendants to the fifth generation
have erected this memorial as a token of esteem. November Ist 1936.”

MOLLE.
George Molle entered the Army as ensign in 1793 and was promoted to the rank
of lieutenant, 1794; captain, 1795; major, 1804; lieutenant-colonel, 1808, and colonel
on 4 August 1814. He served at Gibraltar and the Cape of Good Hope and also saw
service during the continental wars. On 3 June 1813 he was transferred from the
Ninth (or East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot to the 46th (or the South Devonshire) Regt.,
then under orders for service in New South Wales, and on 20 June following was
commissioned Lieutenant-Governor of the colony. He arrived at Sydney, with his
regiment, on 14 February 1814, and took the oaths of Office of Lieutenant-Governor
on 20 March following. He received four grants of land, 1,600 acres on South Creek
called “Netherbyses,” and 1,550 acres in the Minto district called “Molle’s Mains,”
both on 20 June 1816; 500 acres on South Creek called “Catherine-field,” on 24
January 1817, and 300 acres in the Illawarra district on 11 September 1817. He
assisted in the formation of the Bank of New South Wales early in 1817 and in
September of that year left for Bombay, with his regiment.
GENEALOGY.
The family of Mow had long been in possession of Mains in the shire of Berwick. It appears from
an Act of Sederunt of the Court of Sessions of 11 August 1789, that William Mow and his brothers,
obtained authority to alter the spelling of their surname from Mow to Molle, which latter, it
appeared from ancient family documents, had been the original mode of spelling it.
One of the brothers.

MOWLE.
Stewart Marjoribanks Mowle arrived at Sydney on 19 May 1836 by the William
Lockerby in the guardianship of his youngest uncle, Edward Boxer Mowle, who had
already established himself in New South Wales as a merchant. After continuing
his education for some years at Sydney College he proceeded to Yarralumla sheep
station, Limestone Plains, for pastoral experience. He afterwards leased, for ten
years, a property of 2,560 acres on the Molonglo River, upon which now stands a
large part of the capital city of Canberra. Sheep farming did not fulfil his expecta-
tions and, in 1852, he obtained the appointments of Sub-Collector of Customs and
Water Police Magistrate at Twofold Bay. Subsequently, he exchanged into the Office
of the Legislative Council and, in 1883, was commissioned Usher of the Black Rod,
which position he held until his retirement from the Civil Service in 1905. He closely
identified himself with Civil Service institutions and art circles.

MURRAY.
Terence Murray first arrived at Sydney on 3 August 1817 with the 48th Regiment
in which he had served as Paymaster since 2 November 1815. He remained in New
South Wales for seven years and then left with his regiment for Madras, to which
station it had been ordered. The climate of India being unfavourable to his health,
he was obliged to proceed to England on leave of absence, and, subsequently, on 3
September 1826, retired from the Army on half pay. He decided to settle in Australia
and accordingly left Plymouth on 25 November 1826 by the ship Elizabeth and arrived
at Sydney on 7 April 1827.

OFFICER.
Robert Officer arrived at Hobart on 1 March 1822 by the Castle Forbes, as ship’s
surgeon. Being a member of the Royal College of Surgeons he was appointed as an
assistant supernumerary surgeon at New Norfolk and subsequently Surgeon Superin-
tendent of the New Norfolk hospital and President of the Medical Court of examiners.
He retired from practice, and on 18 April 1854 took a seat in the Legislative Council
(then the only Chamber) as the member for Buckingham. During that session a new
Constitution created two Chambers, a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly,
and to the latter he was returned, in September 1856, as a member for the district of
Glenorchy. He was elected chairman of committees, and on 15 August 1861, when
the speakership became vacant, was appointed to that office which he held until his
resignation on 20 April 1877. In 1869 he received the honour of knighthood.

RODD.
John Tremayne Rodd was for a time a tutor at Blundell’s school in Devonshire.
He afterwards spent some years in India and then became an hydrographer in the
Royal Navy and was principally associated, whilst in that Service, with a survey of
the Red Sea. Resigning from the Navy, upon the death of his wife, he left for
Australia with his three young sons and after a voyage of 104 days arrived at Hobart
Town on 22 January 1822 by the Tiger. Three months later he embarked in the
Castle Forbes and arrived at Sydney on 25 April 1822. He was appointed an Assistant
Surveyor on 30 June 1825 and three years later, owing to an injury received whilst
on duty, was given the position of Superintendent of Works at Newcastle—an
appointment which called for less arduous and active exertion. From this position
he retired in 1829 and at the end of 1830 went to England to correct a misrepresenta-
tion that appeared to have been transmitted in regard to the extent of land held by
him by grant. His appeal was successful and the Governor was directed, on 20
November 1831, to grant him 1,800 acres that he had rented from the Government
immediately adjoining his farm near Broke on the Wollombi River, if still available.
The full area was not, however, available and consequently 800 acres only were
granted at the location desired —on 9 April 1835—together with 1,000 acres at the
confluence of the Berenderry Creek and Krui River, in the county of Bligh.

to New South Wales, on 18 February 1826 by the Mangles. When the 57th Regiment
was added to the Indian establishment at the end of 1831, he decided to remain in the
colony and obtained a purchase grant of 640 acres near Mulgoa, called “Ravenswood,”
where he began a pastoral and agricultural life. He also closely identified himself with
public affairs in New South Wales by accepting, in January 1833, the honorary
secretaryship of the Australian Subscription Library (the precursor of the Public
Library of New South Wales) and, in the following July, a directorship of the Bank of
Australia. In 1835 he was elected president of the Australian Wheat and Flour Com-
pany and also of the Australian Union Benefit Society; in 1836 he was appointed a

there until 1838 when he removed to Sydney, leaving his brother and two sons to
manage these properties and also “Ellore,” another grant of 1,600 acres near the

STOKES.
Frederick Michael Stokes arrived at Sydney in 1830 and joined the clerical staff
of The Sydney Gazette —the first newspaper published in Australia (5 March 1803).
In 1831, he, with two partners, founded The Sydney Herald and issued the first
number on 18 April. Soon after, one of the partners retired and, in 1836, he himself
sold his half share to the remaining original partner. After spending a few years in
the northern districts, acting from 28 March 1838 as a trustee for the receipt of
Savings Bank deposits for the district of Port Macquarie, he again became associated
with the paper as sole owner and editor and so remained until 7 February 1841 when
he sold it to Fairfax and Kemp. In July 1840 he was elected a director of the Sydney
Ferry Company.

STREET.
John Street arrived at Sydney on 27 April 1822 by the brig Thalia. Being
recommended by the Colonial Office to Governor Brisbane he was, in consequence,
informed that a grant of land would be made to him in proportion to the means he
possessed, and armed with this promise he decided to settle in the Bathurst district.
Accordingly, a deed of grant was issued on 30 June 1823 under the Seal of the
Territory for 2,000 acres on the Campbell River in the present-day parish of
Langdale, county of Westmoreland, the property being called “Woodlands.” He
soon associated himself with public affairs, notably, a memorial to the Secretary of
State from the “landholders and proprietors of live stock” section of the recently
formed Agricultural Society (1 June 1822) protesting against the high rate of duty
on wool imported into England, which resulted in the “remission for ten years of
the duty which would otherwise have been attached to the wool imported into this
country from New South Wales,” advised Downing Street, in reply, and in 1824,
with a memorial in reference to timber duties pointing out the disadvantage cedar
was under compared with mahogany from the East Indies. So early as 1828 his
sheep had increased to 2.soo—partly founded with some merino ewes he had brought
from England—and horned cattle to 350, while a fair proportion of the property
was cleared and some under cultivation.

SUTTOR.
George Suitor arrived at Sydney on 6 November 1800 in H.M.S. Porpoise, his
passage in that ship having been arranged by the British Government in order to
supervise the transport of certain European trees and plants which he had selected as
suitable for cultivation in Australia. In further consideration of this service and in
fulfilment of a promise made to him as a prospective settler, he was placed in
possession, soon after arrival, of 180 acres of land in the district of Toongabbe, the
deed of grant, executed on 31 March 1802, providing that the property was to be
called “Suttor Farm.” In 1804, he, with two others, was appointed a trustee for 14
years of a common of 3,880 acres in the Baulkham Hills district. On 10 June 1815
he was granted 100 acres of land in the newly formed district of Bathurst, the property
to be known as “Wellington Farm,” and on 30 June 1823, 130 acres at the “township
of Peel.” In 1837-40, he obtained purchase grants of land aggregating 4,460 acres
in the county of Wellington and in 1833-39, 2,804 acres in the county of Roxburgh
and 180 acres in the county of Bathurst.

public works; commandant of the Newcastle district from March 1905 to October 1808,
including the appointment of “magistrate for Newcastle and the parts adjacent” on 23 February
1808; recalled to his former position of assistant surgeon and magistrate in Sydney by one of
the usurpers of the Bligh government, in which position he remained until September 1809
when he was allowed to retire owing to ill-health with the indulgences of a free settler; granted
950 acres of land on 1 Jan. 1810 in the district of Minto called in the deed, “Glenfield,” and
500 acres in 1811 in the Upper Minto district, called “Smeeton”: the practical discoverer
of the fertile district of Moss Vale and Sutton Forest which he afterwards linked with the
district of Illawarra; in 1819, with the permission of the governor, he succeeded in discovering
an alternative route to the long and difficult road across the mountains between Emu Plains
and Bathurst, by passing through the Cowpastures (on 25 April) into the “new country” of
Moss Vale and Sutton Forest and then through the present-day counties of Argyle and
Georgiana in a north-westerly direction to the banks of the Campbell River (9 May) within
a short distance of Bathurst, in which connexion the governor issued a special government
and general order on 31 May 1819 paying tribute to his zeal and perseverance and requesting
his acceptance of 1,000 acres of land in any part of the country discovered by himself (actually
selected south of the Bong Bong River and then called by the governor, with the grantee’s
concurrence “Throsby Park”); in 1821, superintended the making of a road from the Stone-
quarry Creek through the newly discovered country as far as the Cookbundoon Range, a

WALKER.
Thomas Walker was appointed a Deputy Assistant Commissary General on 25
December 1814 and in this capacity arrived at Sydney on 13 January 1818 by the
Friendship. Six months later he was placed in charge of the Commissariat at Port
Dalrymple, in Tasmania, where he remained for three years. He was then trans-
ferred to Headquarters at Sydney where he married and built a home for himself
near Concord on the Parramatta River. Subsequently, he was placed in charge at
Windsor and Parramatta and in 1825 retired from the Service on half-pay. In 1832,
he returned with his young family to Tasmania and settled on an estate called
“Rhodes,” granted to him in 1818, and which had been managed by his brother,
Abraham, for eight years. Here he lived until his death in 1861 when his family
returned to the original home at Concord.

WHITE.
James White arrived at Sydney on 24 July 1826 by the brig Fairfield. He had
been engaged in England by the Australian Agricultural Company to superintend
the transport of a number of valuable sheep to its extensive grants in New South
Wales —subsequently fixed in the counties of Gloucester and Parry—and upon arrival
there to become flockmaster. After occupying that position for a few years he resigned,
and then took up the management, successively, of several pastoral properties in the
county of Hunter. On 23 September 1839, in fulfilment of a promise made on or
before 6 July 1831 and an authorization to take possession on 18 October 1831, he
was granted 1,280 acres of land at the confluence of the rivers Isis and Page, and
there, at “Broomfield,” the name prescribed in the deed, he commenced sheep farming
for himself. He also obtained, in 1839-40, three purchase grants in the county of
Brisbane and acquired a property near Muswellbrook called “Edinglassie,”—so
named in the Crown deed in favour of the original owner —and also “Timor,” an
estate lying about twelve miles north of Blandford. These estates, considerably
increased in area, are still in the possession of some of his descendants.

WILSON.
William Wilson, and his wife, left Tilbury on 31 December 1832 by the ship
Westmoreland and arrived at Port Jackson on 19 May 1833. He settled on a farm
at Cook’s River and remained there until 1838 when he removed to Illawarra. In
1843, when reports of the fine country on the Richmond River filtered through from
cedar cutters, he fitted out a schooner with supplies and sailed with his wife and six
children for the new river—discovered in 1829. Arriving at the entrance on 9 February
1844 he found that the sand-bar would oblige him to leave his family temporarily
at Ballina. He then inspected the country on either side of the north arm of the
river as far as the confluence of the creeks subsequently named the Wilson and the
Leycester and fixed upon that position for the headquarters of his station which he
named Lismore after the island of that name on the Ardnamurchan coast, Argyllshire.
He took up about 36 sq. m. of country under licence to depasture stock beyond the
limits of location and obtained his cattle from the Macleay River. After spending
many years on this property, he found, in 1861, that the best parts of the station
had been selected and consequently he removed to Monaltrie, about six miles distant.
For a number of years he was closely associated with his brother-in-law, Henry O’Brien,
of Douro, Yass, in a venture designed to turn to advantage the great mortality amongst
stock due to the droughts in the forties. Their joint experiments resulted in the
successful “boiling-down” of carcasses of sheep for the tallow. The shipping of
this commodity in very large quantities to England and foreign countries saved many
squatters from ruin. He acquired many purchase grants of land in the environs
of Lismore.

WINDEYER.
Archibald Windeyer, accompanied by his wife and eight children, arrived at
Sydney on 11 December 1838 by the James Pattison and about ten months later —
9 October 1839—purchased “Kinross,” an estate of 640 acres adjoining Raymond
Terrace on the Hunter River, and there established himself on 6 April 1840. He at
once commenced pastoral pursuits, and became interested in wine-growing, being
awarded, in 1849, the Gold Medal of the Australian Botanic and Horticultural Society
for his Burgundy. He enlarged “Kinross,” on 5 January 1841, by two purchase
grants of 664 acres and 640 acres adjoining, and subsequently further increased it by
a purchase from his kinsman, Richard Windeyer, of 440 acres which he required for
conditioning cattle. In 1912, his descendants subdivided and sold for closer settle-
ment the property known as “Benbolba,” comprising 1,000 acres on the Upper
Williams River, which had been purchased by the pioneer before retiring from the
Ordnance Department in England, in which he served for thirty years.

WINDEYER.
Charles Windeyer arrived at Sydney, accompanied by his wife and eight children,
on 31 July 1828 by the ship Sarah. Intending to settle on the land he was authorized,
on 28 December 1828, to take possession of 2,560 acres on the Upper Williams
River, the deed of grant dated 24 November 1837 providing that the property be
called “Tiligra.” In the meantime, however, he seems to have preferred an
immediate assured income inasmuch as he entered the Civil Service, on 1 October
1828, as Principal Clerk in the Police Office. On 1 August 1831 he was appointed a
Magistrate of the Territory and Assistant Police Magistrate at Sydney and gazetted,
on 2 October 1833, “Second Police Magistrate for the Town and Port of Sydney.”
In 1837, he was appointed one of the Commissioners for examining and reporting
upon claims to grants of land and held this position in conjunction with the office of
“Senior Police Magistrate,” so recognized after the abolition of the position of First
Police Magistrate in December 1839. In consonance with the statute of 20 July 1842
declaring the Town of Sydney to be a City and providing for the incorporation of the
citizens, he was chosen and gazetted to fill the office of Mayor from 12 August 1842
until the first council had been elected, which, in fact, occurred on 9 November follow-
ing. He retired from the Civil Service in 1848.

WYNDHAM.
George Wyndham arrived at Sydney on 26 December 1827 by the ship George
Home. A few weeks later—2 February 1828—he purchased “Armadale,” an estate of
2,000 acres near Branxton and partly encircled by the Hunter River. He re-named the
property “Dalwood” and enlarged it, in 1838, by a private purchase of 640 acres and
again, in 1840, by a purchase grant of 640 acres: here he carried on viticulture and
farming. In 1831 he was authorized to take possession, as a primary grant, of 2,560
acres on Smith’s Rivulet, near Merriwa, in the county of Brisbane, for which a deed
was issued on 30 September 1839. He used this property —“Mulargarinda”—in con-
junction with adjoining leases of Crown land and also “Bukkulla,” a pastoral run of
about 100,000 acres in the New England district, for grazing purposes. “Dalwood”
and “Bukkulla” were celebrated in the sixties for the excellent quality of their wines.
In 1859 he exercised a pre-emptive right of purchase in respect of two portions of the
“Bukkulla” pastoral lease, embracing the vineyard, the homestead and other buildings.

APPENDIX A.
PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
gOME years ago, it seemed to me that the time had arrived to compile and publish
a genealogical history of pioneer families of Australia. Such a view was
strengthened by the recollection that with the passing of two more generations a
period would be reached when many families will have been settled in this country
for two hundred years.
The utility of such a work, which would record in a permanent form the descend-
ants of the earliest arrivals in Australia, seemed unquestionable, whilst it would also
serve to show the close bonds of kinship which exist between the families in
Australia and those of the Mother Country.
It was thereupon decided that the proposed work should include families which
had established themselves in Australia during the first half-century of settlement,
that is to say, the period 1788-1838, and be first published to commemorate
the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the arrival at Port Jackson of some of the
families or progenitors of families included in the work.
It was also decided that the publication should include families which settled in
Australia at a later period if the progenitor had married the daughter of a pioneer.
Thus, if a Lawrence arrived later than 1838 and married the daughter of a pioneer,
eligibility for inclusion in Pioneer Families of Australia would be strictly limited
to the family of Lawrence, and not open to descendants of daughters of the Lawrence
family. Such extended eligibility seemed desirable from the point of view that some
pioneers had daughters only.
It was further determined to include, at the head of each family article, a brief
memoir of the pioneer himself. Such an arrangement, it seemed, would have a wide
sentimental interest, whilst the obvious historical value of the memoir would be some-
what assured by the Editor assuming a fiducial responsibility.
In fulfilment of this plan, the accompanying work has been prepared with the
assistance of at least one member of every family included therein, and it is now
presented to subscribers as a trustworthy record of facts concerning the pioneer and
his descendants so far as can be ascertained. As it has not been practicable to obtain
the names of all the descendants even with the assistance referred to, the Editor
therefore hopes that publication of the articles in their present form of completeness
will bring forth earlier than otherwise the information desired.
In order to adjust omissions and ensure the correction of inaccuracies in any
subsequent edition of this work, and thus enhance its value, communication should be
established with the Editor. Alterations in genealogies, which naturally take place as
time goes on, should likewise be communicated.
The Founder and Editor of Pioneer Families of Australia is fully aware that
the families included in the present work represent only a very small proportion of
those which are eligible, and he therefore hopes that steps will be taken by other
eligible families to include their histories in any subsequent edition.
The memoirs in this publication and the form of presenting the genealogical
information are copyright. Exception will not, however, be taken to a brief quotation
if the source thereof be acknowledged.

APPENDIX B.
PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.
r£ HE Preface to the first edition of this work alluded to the difficulty of obtaining
the names of all the descendants of the Pioneer, and expressed the hope that
publication of the histories in their then state of completeness would bring forth,
earlier than otherwise, many missing names. Such expectation has been realized
and the names included in this edition.
Publication of the first edition has also revealed some incorrectness in dates
of birth, marriage, and death, as well as in other information. Instances of inaccurate
order of the birth of sons and daughters in branches of families were also found.
These have now been corrected.
The invitation to notify alterations in genealogies as they occurred after publica-
tion of the first edition, on 30 September 1939, has met with a gratifying response. The
information received has been placed in this edition and the opportunity also taken to
include for the first time a few more families.
The families on pp. 133-141 of the original edition, included in consonance
with paragraph 4 of its Preface, have now been placed in their alphabetical order.
These families did not arrive in Australia during the period 1788-1838, but became
eligible for record in the work through maternal descent. This extension of eligibility
was revoked by the postscript to the first edition without affecting the families
already included.
The Editor again wishes to record that he is fully aware that the families
included in the work still represent only a very small proportion of those which are
eligible, and he therefore hopes that other families qualified to include their histories
will do so when a more favorable time arrives.
The memoirs in this publication and the form of presenting the genealogical
information are copyright. Exception will not, however, be taken to a brief quotation
if its source be acknowledged.
A copy of the Preface to the first edition has been inserted herein as an Appendix.

APPENDIX C.
PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.
gratifying support given by members of the families included in the first
edition of this work enabled that publication to be revised, enlarged, and
reissued as the second edition on 26 January 1942.
As so many of those concerned had obtained copies of the first edition it was
not anticipated that the new edition, although it contained corrections and important
additions, would create as much interest as its forerunner and, consequently, fewer
books were produced. That was an oversight.
The shortness of supply thus created occasioned some disappointment and it
was therefore decided to publish another edition earlier than otherwise. Such an
edition is now presented as the Third Edition. It bears date 26 January 1943, and
commemorates the 155th anniversary of the foundation of Australia at Sydney Cove.
The new edition does not contain, in regard to the present war, references to
personal military service with the Australian Imperial Force or other volunteer
force as in the war of 1914-18. Simiar references will be considered in connexion
with a future edition. In the present war some members of families have fallen
in distant lands and their deaths have been recorded with great regret.
This edition has been produced on a plan that should be suitable for several
editions which will probably be issued during the next decade. It also seems reasonable
to hope that editions of the work will continue to be published from time to time
while Australia endures.
As in the second edition, the Editor again wishes to record that he is fully aware
that the families included in the work still represent only a very small proportion
of those which are eligible, and he therefore hopes that other families qualified to
include their histories will do so when the war is over.
Also, the memoirs herein, and the form of presenting the genealogical informa-
tion, are copyright. Exception will not, however, be taken to a brief quotation if
its source be acknowledged.
Copies of the Prefaces to the first and second editions have been inserted
herein as Appendixes A and B respectively.

INDEX
1. Entries rather than individuals have been indexed. That is to say, entries of the
same name or names might, in fact, refer to completely different persons. The page
on which the same entry appears more than once is marked *.
2. In order to curtail the size of the index, which obviously would otherwise prove to
be alarmingly large, it was decided to omit progenitors of the Pioneer and his con-
temporary relatives unless they were directly associated with Australia.
3. Surnames that could be identified only by initials have not been included unless
amplified by a rank or title. Ranks or titles are shown in parenthesis. With the
exception of Bishops, clergy of all denominations are shown as ‘(Rev.)’; those of the
medical, scientific or dental professions, where appropriate, are shown as ‘(Dr.)’;
Baronets and all degrees of Knighthood are shown as ‘(Sir)’.
