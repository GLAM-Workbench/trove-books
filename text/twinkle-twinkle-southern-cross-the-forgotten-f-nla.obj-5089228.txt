Foreword
Through its Australian collections built up over almost one
hundred years, the National Library of Australia is a rich
repository for a diverse range of materials which record and
document Australian life and achievement in many
different fields.
Robert Holden, Director of the Museum of Australian
Childhood in Sydney, draws on these collections and those
of other specialist Australiana libraries to survey and
analyse the development of Australian nursery rhymes both
as a distinctive form of juvenile entertainment and
education and as part of a folkloric tradition. In this work,
he presents his own interpretation and sets this particular
literary genre into the wider context of the social and
cultural history of Australia. Mr Holden?s text is enriched
and extended by a wide selection of illustrations chosen
from many rare and ephemeral publications held
principally in the National Library.
With the generous assistance of the Morris West Trust
Fund, the National Library is delighted to publish this book
as part of its continuing commitment to share the resources
of its great collections with the people of Australia to whom
they belong as a major information record and an important
part of our national heritage.

Preface
The study of nursery rhymes is by its very nature
interdisciplinary, requiring some familiarity with folklore,
children?s and adult literature, popular art and illustration,
social and publishing history, and the history of education.
Although researchers must guard against thin scholarship in
dealing with so many diverse areas of knowledge, they
otherwise risk limitations of vision if they believe nursery
rhymes, and folklore in general, can be valued and evaluated
within a single and narrow discipline.
In this respect, the varying collections of libraries and
particularly those of the National Library of Australia have
provided a logical basis for this study of indigenous Australian
nursery rhymes. The National Library of Australia?s collections
are inherently interdisciplinary, exhibiting as they do the goal
of gathering, organising and preserving knowledge of our
culture and history of all kinds and in many formats.
Furthermore, the National Library of Australia is a leading
institutional custodian of Australian folklore materials: in the
words of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Folklife in
Australia , it ?has demonstrated a long standing and continuing
interest in folklife matters, and is easily the government
institution in Australia with the best record in this area?. 1
Understandably, from its strength in these specific areas,
this folklore collection is usually thought of in terms of folk
song, folk music and oral history sources. While not seeking
to diminish their significance or the oral sources of much
folklore investigation, it is these rather exclusive attention-
getters which need setting against a broader backdrop of
national folklife in all its manifestations. Equally, it is all too
seldom realised and acknowledged that ever since the
invention of printing, folklore has not relied solely on the oral
tradition to further its boundaries. The printed word though
has not just codified traditional oral material it has also been
an originating source in its own right.
From the days of first settlement, Australia added local
elements to its imported folklore. In terms of Australian
children?s folklore such indigenous elements took many forms.
In the Australian experience my previous work, again based on
National Library holdings, on ?lost in the bush?, explored the
interaction and development of this Australian rheme from
fact to fiction to folklore in our printed records. 2
Equally engrossing are our attempts to produce made-to-
order folklore for our children in terms of indigenous nursery
rhymes. Much of this effort is scattered through a century of


ephemeral and frequently forgotten pamphlets of verse. The
National Library of Australia is particularly rich in its holdings
of such material, some of which can be found listed in their
publication Australian Children?s Books to 1980: a Select
Bibliography of the Collection Held in the National Library of
Australia . 3
Our bush ballads, galloping rhymes and our adult
Australian verse have introduced such folklore figures as ?The
Man from Snowy River? and ?Clancy of the Overflow?. Surely
it is time to populate this imaginative landscape still further
with characters from Australian children?s folklore. Such
nursery rhyme figures as ?The Man from Menindie?, ?Sandy
the Shearer? and ?Sammy the Swaggie? are as culture specific as
any of our adult folk heroes and warrant an equal place in our
mainstream culture and consciousness. They are indigenous
creations in their own right and should be set within the
context of Australian folklore which had its genesis in a
written rather than an oral tradition.
Children?s folklore derives from two major sources: it can
be self generated or it can be imposed by adults who are
usually family members. Thus there are play rhymes and
chants, children?s own folklore, which usually survives by oral
transmission across generations of children. In contrast, there
is the folklore activity of the family in which adults play a
leading role and which is frequently codified in printed form
as lullabies, folk and fairy tales, and nursery rhymes. However,
even though this secondary form of folklore is imposed it can
be every bit as variable as children?s own folklore and vary
greatly from family to family.
Although nursery rhymes are the main source of poetry
for young children, it is the playground rhymes of children in
Australia which have received significant attention rather than
any indigenous tradition of nursery rhymes. The following
work seeks to illuminate previously invisible terrain ?the
forgotten folklore of Australian nursery rhymes.

Introduction
How do we define and categorise the light-hearted charm and
uncertain ancestry of the nursery rhyme? The most
authoritative guide is surely that provided by lona and Peter
Opie in their Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes. According
to the Opies the term ?nursery rhyme? seems to have sprung
up in the third decade of the nineteenth century. 4 Before this,
the rhymes had been known as ?Tommy Thumb Songs? or
?Mother Goose Songs?. Such rhymes, by tacit and universal
consent, could be either spoken or sung, but however they
were delivered their prime object was, and remains, to soothe
and amuse an infant audience. It is also generally accepted that
many nursery rhymes were not originally conceived for an
audience of nursery age children at all and certainly were not
entirely the product of uneducated nurses and beldames of
olden times. Many, in fact were the product of capable satirists
and versifiers writing for an adult audience!
Following this lead, the Opies embraced
those verses which are traditionally passed on to a
child while it is still of nursery age. As well as the
nonsense jingles, humorous songs, and character
rhymes ... [they included] the more common
lullabies, infant amusements, nursery counting-out
formulas, baby puzzles and riddles, rhyming alphabets,
tongue twisters, nursery prayers, and a few singing
games, the words of which have an independent
existence in the nursery. 5
This categorisation enabled the Opies to draw their
nursery rhymes from a considerable variety of sources?from
adult as well as juvenile literature, from chapbooks,
broadsheets, moral pamphlets, popular songs and verses, and
from play, as well as from oral tradition. While some may feel
that the Opies? range was too catholic, it does point up the
extreme difficulty in defining and categorising the nursery
rhyme genre. It would seem safer not to be too dogmatic and
simply assert that a nursery rhyme is nothing more or less than
a verse, from whatever source, that enters into nursery lore or
is composed specifically for a nursery audience. And it is a
world into which an old blind fiddler may enter as easily as a
Shakespeare.
Now even if we accepted the Opies? wide-ranging
definition, the search for Australian equivalents could not be
expected to yield such variety granted that our range of
printed formats is much smaller and our literary output for
children almost entirely a twentieth-century product. This


survey of Australian nursery rhymes is therefore primarily
concerned with tracing the largely self-conscious development
of indigenous nursery verse and the publishing encouragement
such verse attracted. The examples I have chosen, like many of
the Opies', are culled from a range of ephemeral and often
forgotten booklets and slim volumes of rhymes specifically
produced for a nursery audience.
The first known published collection of British nursery
rhymes, Tommy Thumb?s Pretty Song Book, probably appeared
in 1744 and by the time the First Fleet sailed for Australia over
forty years later the canon of nursery rhyme literature had
been steadily augmented. Certainly by the end of the
eighteenth century over forty per cent of the nursery rhymes
recorded in the Opies? Dictionary were in existence and
popular favourites clearly circulating before 1788 included
?Sing a Song of Sixpence?, ?Ffickory, Dickory, Dock?, ?Mary,
Mary, Quite Contrary?, ?Baa, Baa, Black Sheep?, ?Little Boy
Blue?, ?Fley Diddle Diddle?, ?Jack and Jill?, ?Jack Sprat?, ?Little
Jack FForner? and ?Goosey, Goosey, Gander?.
By the middle of the nineteenth century in England,
the burgeoning interest in folklore studies generally, had
also prompted a specific interest in nursery rhymes. Many
of the rhymes and tales current in British nurseries were
collected and commented upon (sometimes rather
eccentrically) in James Halliwell?s standard reference works:
The Nursery Rhymes of England (1842) and Popular Rhymes
and Nursery Tales (1849). Researchers like Halliwell were
overwhelmingly interested in deducing the historical events
and personages which supposedly ?inspired? such rhymes.
They totally failed to appreciate the dynamic nature of the
nursery rhyme as part of the constantly evolving realm of
children?s folklore.
This antiquarian and folkloric interest was considerably
bolstered by the proliferation of specialised literature for the
nineteenth-century child. The result was an ever-increasing
demand for verse, stories, picture books and literary
amusements written for English nurseries. Newly-created verse
began to augment traditional nursery rhymes and sometimes
the broad community of children, as well as adults, took these
newly-minted nursery rhymes to heart and gave them classic
status as they moved off the printed page and into an oral
tradition. Notable examples from this time include ?Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star?, ?The Spider and the Fly?, ?Wee Willie
Winkie?, ?Mary Flad a Little Lamb?, ?There Was a Little Girl?,
?Ten Little Nigger Boys?, ?Old Mother Hubbard?, ?Oh Where,
Oh Where Has My Little Dog Gone?? and ?Higglety, Pigglety
Pop!? It is principally this literary genesis, this made-to-order
folklore which is examined in an Australian context in the
following pages.
With the increasingly popular sentimental image of the
Victorian child there came an influential reaction against the
supposed violence, cruelty and coarseness of many nursery
rhymes. Most of these misconceptions and prejudices are
encapsulated in a significant essay published in Charles
Dickens' magazine Household Words in 1851: A witch in the
nursery'. 6 The author of this essay, Richard Henry Home,
came to Australia the very next year for an extended stay of
almost eighteen years.

Thus, while Australia had no colonial equivalent of
such a nineteenth-century figure as James Halliwell it
was not entirely bereft of or unconnected with a
developing interest in children?s folklore.
Now it has been said that ?nursery rhymes call for as little of
anything in the way of introduction as would Mr. Punch, Guy
Fawkes or Santa Claus at a children?s party?. 7 Such a widely-
held belief is trivialising; it presupposes the genre is worthy
solely because it is time honoured and that nursery rhymes are
too precious and ephemeral to admit of scrutiny and analysis.
But all popular culture is subject to the vagaries of taste and
fashion. Additions as well as deletions to the nursery rhyme
corpus are an ongoing cultural phenomenon and, as the Opies
have shown, the recipe is not lost. Australian cooks have,
moreover, contributed a small serving to this feast and to that
vast menagerie that includes blind mice, an amorous frog, lost
sheep and a cat with a fiddle can be added Australian denizens
such as leaping kangaroos, irrepressible laughing kookaburras,
fearsome bunyips and clever rabbits who outsmart the dingo!
Indeed, the amusing antics of native fauna provide our
most obvious nursery rhyme subject and one which has
retained a perennial appeal for young Australians. However,
alongside this constant are other subjects whose novelty has
not been sustained: today?s children may well find it difficult,
if not impossible, to be as excited as their forebears over the
possibility of a tram or a train ride as described in some of our
nursery rhymes. Equally, some of the occupations these
rhymes depict (such as butchers delivering on horseback or
farmers milking by hand) or the pastimes they chronicle (such
as collecting eggs from a backyard poultry run) contribute to a
picture of Australian childhood past.
As a small illumination into the largely invisible terrain
of Australia?s history of childhood, these nursery rhymes have
never attracted a like spirit to the Opies. It is more than


twenty years since lan Turner wrote the first attempt at a
definitive study of Australian children?s play rhymes 8 and there
has been a burgeoning of scholarly interest in these rhymes as
well as increased validation of such research ever since. 9
Nevertheless, as wide ranging as this interest is it has not
extended into the area of nursery rhymes of local origin or
adaptation. Admittedly such nursery rhymes, which are elusive
and seldom anthologised, are much more likely to be the
product of an adult?s imagination rather than a child?s, yet
even so their place and status in an evolving view of children?s
folklore in Australia should not go unacknowledged.
Lan Turner?s pioneering book concluded, too hastily, that
there was no independent tradition of Australian nursery
rhymes 10 and only a few echoes of classic nursery rhymes
appeared in his patient accumulation gathered from verbal
sources. Certainly the contribution of Australian nursery
rhymes to popular culture is less significant than that of
Australian play rhymes. For the diligent researcher, however,
Australian nursery rhymes can be found and may cause us to
agree with the nationalistic sentiments of the Bulletin
expressed over seventy years ago:
?Banbury Cross? and ?Dick Whittington? and I?ve
been to London to see the Queen? ... are
quite out of place in this land of
kangaroos, rabbits and politicians
... The Australian kid has an
outlook different from that of
an English kid: the sort of songs he wants to sing will
not be those that the English kid sings."
In the process of unearthing this rare vein of Australian
nursery rhymes one also reveals yet another way in which
Australia has sought to find its own voice, to articulate the
Australian experience to its youngest members and give them
a literature of their own. Furthermore, it repopulates the
literary landscape, for in the process it brings minor poets to
the fore and extends the contribution of acknowledged and
better-known writers of verse for adults into the realm of
children?s literature.
It thus enables C.J. Dennis? single published volume for
children to appear less like a curiosity and more of a whole
with his long-term interests and literary output. It also enables
us to unravel something like a literary coterie in Sydney in the
early 1920s which was briefly brought together to consolidate
an interest in composing Australian nursery rhymes. This
interrelationship personalises and links figures who might not
otherwise have been revealed to us as like thinkers. Finally,
it allows one literary genre, albeit minor, to stand
recorded as an inspiration for further
practitioners in the ongoing process of
giving young Australia its own
imaginative territory.


Chapter 1
Nursery Rhymes in Colonial Australia
?Who killed cockatoo??
Molesworth Jeffrey, a minor mid-century literary figure in
colonial Tasmania has left us a touching look at English-born
parents attempting to pass on the oral tradition of their
childhood to young colonials:
The Author, while sitting one Winters evening beside
his Family-hearth, was striving to recall old Nursery
rhymes. Amongst sundry antique songs that he
endeavoured to vivify anew in his memory for the
benefit of his Bairns, was the one commencing with
Twinkle, twinkle, little Star.? But familiar as the first
lines of that Composition may sound to all whose
early life has been passed in England, neither the
Author nor his Wife was able to recite more than the
two commencing stanzas ... And so, after much vain
effort of memory, it was resolved that the Author
should do his best to supplement the hiatus from his
own stores of versification. 12
Jeffrey?s version, however, has nothing of a distinctive
Australiana touch about it; the nursery rhyme becomes
something akin to a hymn and sacrifices its carefree mood and
innocence to a didactic moral purpose:
... Still my fellow-creatures move
To admire the wondrous LOVE,
That design?d you what you are ?
Beacon to the traveller!
Still all heedless mortals tell
Of th? illimitable SKILL,
That uplifted you so high
In the void immensity.
Still excite them to adore
The eternal sovran POWER,
That sustains you night by night,
And replenishes your light.
Molesworth Jeffrey, [ Hashshelousho Melochirri\ (1864)
And if the middle class and intellectually stimulating
environment of the Jeffrey household could not reproduce the
classic nursery rhymes for mid-century Australian children, how
much more difficult must it have been for our founding fathers?
Part of the cargo, the imaginative cargo, which the First
Fleet undoubtedly carried to Sydney Cove in 1788 was a
cross-section of the folklore of the British Isles. Along with the
adult verses, folk songs, bawdy ditties, proverbs, riddles and
rhymes there would also have been items of nursery lore which


fc.
had begun to be codified in print from the middle of the
eighteenth century. The voices of white children were raised in
the Australian colonies from the very first day of settlement
when almost forty children (twelve years of age or under was
the contemporary definition of child) arrived. These children
constituted less than four per cent of the entire contingent ?a
proportion which was greatly at variance ,
with the structure of the society they
had left behind.
When the first English census was
taken in 1801 it was revealed that
almost half the population were
children?four million from a total of
nine million! The First Fleeter?s
deviation from this norm was not
significantly altered until the first fifty
years of settlement had passed.
Throughout the 1830s the first great
influx of children arrived as part of
immigrant families. In addition, by the
end of this decade the native-born
population were into their second
generation and secure family units were
becoming much more commonplace in
colonial society than they had been in
the past. 13 It should therefore not be
surprising that Australia?s first children?s
book appeared at this time and was produced to help redress
the inadequate schooling facilities for this sudden burgeoning
of children in the colonies.
No doubt in this largely alien environment both
immigrant and convict children, like their elders, sometimes
turned for consolation to the rhymes, songs and hymns of
their homeland. It is equally likely that some of this oral
bounty for children would eventually have suffered a sea
change and been reworked to accommodate local idiom and
invention. But just when was such verse of local adaptation or
even origin honoured with the permanency of print?
Local publishers last century were
usually booksellers, printers and
stationers first, and any publishing was
very much an ancillary and minor
effort. And so far as children?s
publishing was concerned it did not
achieve mainstream status until the
twentieth century: colonial publishing
for children was less than an ancillary
occupation and was more like an
indulgence! Granted the superiority of
imported printings, the small buying
public locally and the dearth of
Australian children?s authors and
illustrators, one can readily appreciate
why, of the seventy or so children?s
books published in nineteenth-century
Australia, most had the crude
appearance and limited circulation of
frontier printings.
The first children?s book written,
published and printed in Australia was Charlotte Barton's A
Mother's Offering to Her Children (1841). And perhaps the first
work of verse for Australian children was Archpriest Therry's
Hymns for Children published in Melbourne in 1846. Francis
Grundy's verse narrative, The Demon McGuire, about the


Urn - ' - ? V.. ...
i rfjijnwjf _
rough and tumble effect of the demon Southerly buster on
colonial Sydney appeared in 1870 and a few years later Louisa
Anne Meredith presented her Grandmammas Verse Book for
Young Australia (1878) which was later issued in a much more
elaborate and illustrated edition in London as Waratah Rhymes
for Young Australia (1891).
In a significant ?Preface? to the London edition Louisa
Anne Meredith claimed that this work was the first attempt ?to
provide Australian children with simple rhymes on local
subjects?. While none of these verses could be called nursery
rhymes a couple of them do appropriate characters from
nursery rhyme sources. These are used as a starting point for
extended verse narratives with the overt didactic intention of
conveying lessons on Australian natural history. Thus A Walk
with Miss Muffet? is used to describe the habits and habitat of
the trap-door spider.
Miss Muffet the lady is called,
Whom we all understand to have squalled
When a friendly old spider
Dropped close down beside her:
She was so amazed and appalled!
If Miss Muffet will put on her hat,
We will go for a walk and a chat;
Not far need we ramble,
Nor over rocks scramble,
Our way will be easy and flat.
I?ve a friend we will both call and see,
A recluse most unsocial is he,
Yet his fine taste in dressing
Ne?er fails in impressing
Us all with his grave dignity ...
He, a clever mechanic, begins
By stretching long ropes, which he spins
Of silk threads wove together
In sunshiny weather,
And so, soon a network he wins.
Of bright shining silk it is made,
And in accurate patterns displayed
In a trellis, whose angles
With dewdrops, like spangles,
Each morning at dawn are arrayed
Then, under a leaf or a flower,
He sits in a shadowy bower,
So patiently watching
Those fine meshes catching
The flies he intends to devour.
Now, my charming Miss Muffet, when next
By a spider your temper is vext,
Observe him more closely,
And do not morosely
Run off from him, cross and perplext.
Louisa Anne Meredith, Waratah Rhymes for Young Australia
(1891)


Louisa Anne Meredith could not hold back from adding
a stultifying weight of factual information about the natural
world to this nursery theme and extending it over fifteen
verses, with footnotes! Her didactic intent thus produced a
long-winded verse whose plodding mediocrity lacks the
refreshing sparseness and incantatory quality which are
hallmarks of successful verse for children, let alone the nursery
rhyme itself.
These are almost our sole nineteenth-century examples of
published verse for young Australians and after this brief
flowering the century was strangely quiet. And amongst this
slight output, there are few nursery rhymes of local invention
or even adaption. William Howitt who visited Australia
between 1852 14 and 1854 left us with one rare example. In his
children?s book A Boy?s Adventures in the Wilds of Australia
(1854) he recounts the brief tale of two birds who had built
their nest just where diggers were prospecting for gold. Instead
of destroying the nest they observed its daily life and were
inspired to compose a slight variation on a Victorian nursery
rhyme:
?Little Brown Betty lived under a pan,
And brewed good ale for digger-men.
Digger-men came every day,
And little Brown Betty went hopping away.?
William Howitt, A Boy?s Adventures in the Wilds of Australia
(1854)
Howitt actually sailed to Australia in company with his
friend Richard Henry Horne, the same Richard Horne who
only the year before had written a highly significant essay on
nursery rhymes for Household Words. Howitt?s wife, Mary, was
also a writer and her best-known poem, now part of classic
nursery literature, had been published in 1834: ??Will you
walk into my parlour?? said the Spider to the Fly?. This happy
convergence of literary ability and nursery rhyme interest
might have been expected to produce something significant in
the Australian environment. Unfortunately all we have is this
lone variation on ?Little Brown Betty? which enlivens Howitt?s
otherwise rather plodding text.
Another rare example of colonial adaptation of nursery
rhymes is quoted in an early primary school textbook: a
complaining colonial child seeks to summon fine weather
using a time-honoured nursery formula with the inclusion of a
local Victorian place name.

Go to Spain,
Never come back to Brighton again

It was also at this time, the 1860s, that the first separately
published items of Australian sheet music for children were
issued: significantly, these

lore and rhymes into the musical life of colonial Australia was
most frequently achieved via the pantomime. Two of Marcus
Clarke's least remembered efforts were such works: Goody Two
Shoes and Little Boy Blue, or, Sing a Song of Sixpence ... (1870)
and Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star or, Harlequin Jack Frost, Little
Tom Tucker and the Old Woman that Lived in a Shoe ... (1873).
Amongst these sparse examples the most noteworthy attempt
to adapt a traditional nursery rhyme to an Australian setting
was a version of ?Who Killed Cock Robin?? which appeared in
Adelaide about 1870 under the title Who Killed Cockatoo?
This new rendition of a perennial nursery favourite was
written by William Cawthorne and it would appear to be the
first work separately published in Australia which sought to
transplant such a nursery rhyme into a local setting.
Cawthorne?s slight pamphlet was very much a frontier
printing, crudely printed and presented with little if any visual
appeal for a young audience. As a novel item for an extremely
limited colonial audience it must have been issued as a very
small print run and most probably only circulated in Adelaide
so that the eastern states were denied the pleasure of an
Australian ?Cock Robin?.
William Anderson Cawthorne (1824?97) was a
prominent figure in the early cultural life of colonial Adelaide.
He had arrived there as an English immigrant in 1841 and at
the age of seventeen opened one of its earliest schools. Apart
from a brief and unsuccessful attempt at gold mining in
Victoria in 1852, he continued his educational role until
1855. Thereafter, for a brief while, he established an Academy
of Art and concentrated on another of his long-term
interests?the illustration of Aboriginal life and customs.
Cawthorne also established a music warehouse in Adelaide
and throughout his life maintained an entrepreneurial attitude
to colonial opportunity.
Cawthorne was also a frequent contributor of letters,
verses, short paragraphs, anthropological observations,
educational views and miscellaneous prose to colonial
newspapers and magazines. Amongst this minor output may
well be precursors of Who Killed Cockatoo ? ?other works in
the nursery rhyme format. Although anonymous, ?Australian
rhymes for Australian babes? published in an Adelaide
magazine in 1861 is very possibly one such item from
Cawthorne?s pen (a cutting of this verse is included in
Cawthorne?s scrapbook of personalia held by the Mitchell
Library, Mss 8232, p. 63). Its first verse reads:
Little Tommy Drew
Went to Wallaroo
To search for a mine:
He walked by the road
And found a big lode,
And said, ?What a rich man am I.?
Anon, Bell?s Life in Adelaide (May 1861)
Who Killed Cockatoo? was Cawthorne?s sole known
published work for children. Its first part adheres quite closely
to the traditional nursery version and this gives it direction
and narrative structure. Unfortunately, Cawthorne augmented
the work with a further eleven verses in an effort to introduce
even more local colour. When he was thrown completely on
his own poetic efforts and departed from the time-honoured
formula, he failed to produce more than a minor Australian
literary curiosity and hardly an item which might have entered
the folklore of a new country.

Who Killed Cockatoo?
Part I
Who killed Cockatoo?
I, said the Mawpawk,
With my tomahawk:
I killed Cockatoo.
Who saw him die?
I, said the Opossum,
From the gum-blossom;
I saw him die.
Who caught his blood?
I, said the Lark,
With this piece of bark:
I caught his blood.
Who?ll make his shroud?
I, said the Eagle,
With my thread and needle;
I?ll make his shroud.
Who?ll be chief mourner?
I, said the Plover,
For I was his lover:
I?ll be chief mourner.
Who?ll dig his grave?
I, said the Wombat,
My nails for my spade:
I?ll dig his grave.
Who?ll say a prayer?
I, said the Magpie,
My best I will try?
I?ll say a prayer.
Who?ll bear him to his tomb?
I, said the Platipus,
On my back, gently, thus:
I?ll bear him to his tomb.
Who?ll be the parson?
I, said the Crow,
Solemn and slow:
I?ll be the parson.
Who?ll carry the link?
I, said the Macaw,
With my little paw:
I?ll carry the link.
Who?ll chant a psalm?
I, said the Black Swan,
I?ll sing his death song:
I?ll chant a psalm.
Who?ll watch in the night?
I, said the Wild Dog,
As he crept from a log;
I?ll watch in the night.
Who?ll toll the bell?
I, said the Pelican,
Again and again:
I?ll toll the bell.
Then droop?d every head,
And ceas?d every song,
As onward they sped,
All mournful along.
All join in a ring,
With wing linking wing,
And trilling and twittering,
Around the grave sing:
Alas! Cockatoo,
How low dost thou lie;
A long, sad adieu!
A fond parting sigh!

Part II
Then came the Wild Cat,
And the bushy-tail Rat,
With a squeak and a mew;
While, in a hop,
Up came, with a pop,
The big Kangaroo.
The Quail, and the Rail,
Were there without fail;
And the pretty Blue Wren,
With master Emu,
And screeching Curlew,
From a beautiful glen.
And the bird of the Mound,
In Murray-scrub found,
With its eggs in a row;
And the Parrot with crest,
In a green and blue vest,
As grand as a beau.
And the Lyre Bird, grand,
That ne?er still will stand,
Came in on tip-toe.
And straw-colored Ibis,
Once worshipped with Isis,
Was present also.
And the Bronze-winged Pigeon,
And the roly fat Widgeon,
From hill and from dell;
And he that doth build
A bower well filled
With spangle and shell.
Then flying very fast,
Came Laughing Jackass,
Hoo hoo hoo! ha ha ha!
While he gobbled a snail,
And wagged his big tail!
Hoo hoo hoo! ha ha ha!
And the Snake, sneaking sly
With his sharp glittering eye,
As he searches and pries;
And the Lizard with frill,
Like a soldier at drill,
That fights till he dies.
And the saucy Tom Tit,
With his pretty ?twit twit,?
And his tail in the air;
And the wary quick Snipe,
With a bill like a pipe,
Hopping hither and there.
O wicked Mawpawk!
We?ll have you caught,
For the deed you have done;
We?ll slyly creep
When you?re fast asleep,
And break your bones ev?ry one.
?Yes Yes,? said the Hawk,
And the bird that can talk,
We?ll strike off his head.?
?Ah, Ah,? said the Owl,
?By fish, flesh and fowl,
?We?ll bang! shoot him dead.?
So they all flew away,
And still fly to this day,
O?er hill and o?er plain;
But he dives in the rushes,
And hides under bushes,
And they search but in vain.

Early attempts to provide indigenous literature for Australian
children were often frustrated by the great wealth of imported
printings from England. The last quarter of the nineteenth
century saw a huge proliferation of picture books, nursery text
and printed amusements all of which were as eagerly
appropriated into Australian nurseries as into their English
counterparts. Traditional nursery rhymes appeared in many
formats and enterprising British publishers used technical
advances in colour printing to present lavish editions
illustrated by Kate Greenaway, Walter Crane, Randolph
Caldecott and a host of lesser known figures.
These collections were internationally popular and
appeared in Australian bookshops within a short time of their
London issue. Amongst these is one work with the promising
title of Young Australia?s Nursery Rhymes (c. 1891).
Disappointingly, this is completely Anglophile in its choice of
rhymes and its illustrations are weak imitations of Kate
Greenaway?s work. In actual fact the book was simply a reissue
of a London imprint, Young England?s Nursery Rhymes (1890),
with no more than an altered title to tempt an Australian
audience. Yet even so, such a change of title at least marks an
awareness that a nationalistic appeal was beginning to be an
asset for this particular foreign market.
One of the earliest formats for nursery verse and certainly one
of the most popular nursery items in the second half of the
nineteenth century was the rhyming alphabet. The Opies'
Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes actually opens with five rhyming
alphabets including ?A Apple Pie? which dates from the
seventeenth century and has retained its popularity in the
nursery to the present day. Although no-one was tempted to
acclimatise A Apple Pie? into Australian culinary terms,
alphabets were produced whose localisations made them
culture specific for Australia. Such alphabets were the major
colonial contribution to nursery literature.
The first known example to be published here was The
Australian Alphabet of Natural History issued in Sydney in
1857. Unfortunately, its existence is only known from
advertisements?no actual copy appears to have survived.
Further Australian examples began to appear as more than
isolated curiosities during what was surely the heyday of
alphabet composition and illustration: in Victorian England
between 1865 and 1875, Walter Crane alone illustrated six
major alphabet books and his pre-eminence was only
somewhat checked a decade later by Kate Greenaway?s version
of A Apple Pie in 1886. The example of Crane and his English
contemporaries in popularising the alphabet book as an

indispensable nursery item was not lost on Australian
publishers and was certainly the inspiration to the Melbourne
firm of Samuel and William Calvert who produced two such
works in the 1870s: The Young Australians Alphabet and The
Australian ABC Book.
Both these alphabets display the typographical style and
layout common to much popular printing of the late nineteenth
century: the dominant capital letters and solidly blocked text are
coupled with vignette illustrations, often crudely coloured. Both
alphabet books were proudly displayed by the Calvert brothers
at the (Melbourne) Intercolonial Exhibition of 1875 and
attracted favourable comment from the judges:
The specimens of Picture Books, intended for Australian
children, designed and printed in colours by William
Calvert are very good, both in drawing and in execution,
and further deserve commendation as an attempt to
familiarize Australian children with the natural history
and surroundings of their colonial home. 15
The judges? concluding comments held the most truth:
these alphabets owed their success to their indigenous content
which was a considerable novelty in its day. In actual fact they
could not sustain comparison with the best of their English
counterparts. The Young Australian?s Alphabet contains
uninspired illustrations and trite, awkward verse. Only the
cover is eye-catching and shows evidence of illustrative and
design skills together with typographical inventiveness.
Even so, these alphabets had widespread colonial appeal
and their circulation was certainly much greater than
Cawthorne?s nursery novelty of the same decade. Together
with E.W. Cole?s ?Kindergarten Cyclopaedia? series of the
1890s, alphabets were the most popular and widely seen
nursery literature locally produced for colonial children. Cole?s
printings, however, were scrapbook style accumulations of
verse, puzzles, short stories and illustrations culled from an
anonymous range of English printed sources. Unlike the
Calverts, Cole neither commissioned new work on the local
scene nor devoted any significant attention to Australiana.

Is famous for Corn,
For Wool and for Gold.

Chapter 2
Songs for the Nursery
'Kookooburra, kookooburra, sitting on a gum tree'
Just before the end of the century the Australian poet Victor
Daley, writing in the Bulletin, lamented the lack of Australian
child-literature of song and story that will supersede the old
nursery favorites with their Northern color and Northern
ideality?. 16 Although Daley?s first volume of verse was
published the same year that he made this comment, he did
not attempt to rectify this national lacunae in his own verse.
His only discovery was a local play rhyme in popular use in
turn-of-the-century Sydney published in the Bulletin in 1898:
?Johnny and Jane and Jack and Lou;
Butler?s Stairs through Woolloomooloo;
Woolloomooloo, and ?cross the Domain,
Round the Block, and home again!
Heigh, ho! tipsy toe,
Give us a kiss and away we go.?
Anon, [?Johnny and Jane ], Bulletin (12 March 1898)
Perhaps the one person at the time who could have
answered Daley?s challenge, the one person who was most
capable and comfortable with the small scale, the bizarre
humour and the incantatory pace of verse suitable for a
nursery audience was Ethel Turner. She edited the children?s
page of the Australian Town and Country Journal in the 1890s
and Gum Leaves, her ninth book, was culled from its
contributions. This was actually the first of her books to be
published in Australia.
It was in this last decade of the nineteenth century that
children?s book publishing in Australia began to develop as
more than a sporadic occurrence. If we exclude E.W. Cole?s
numerous part publications of the 1890s from our survey,
almost the same number (about thirty-five) of imaginative
children?s books were published in Australia between 1841 and
1890 as there were in the single decade of the 1890s
themselves. Furthermore, the quality of production and the
tentative introduction of colour printing marked the 1890s
printings as valid attempts to compete with their imported
counterparts. This competition was also energised by the
emergence of a discernible colonial pride in local achievement:
Australian writing and illustrating for Australian children
presented in locally produced books. And a work like Ethel
Turner?s Gum Leaves (1900) was certainly worthy of acclaim
and pride.
Among the miscellany of items in Turner?s book were five
short verses which provide a link between the nursery
literature of colonial days and that of the new century:

Hey, diddle, diddle! The cat and the fiddle

More novel Would be for a great wallaby
The organ to play with one toe.
For the moon to give chase to the man on her face,
And the comet to join in the fun;
For the evergreen rabbit to weep at the habit
Of squatters infesting its run.
For the novelist pale to yield up his tale
To the sheep of 80-peep?s woeful verse;
For the ghost of the corner to sit on Jack Horner
While Coroner Cats seek a hearse.
For small dogs to giggle when cows give a wriggle,
That lands them away past the moon,
Is really quite stale, as is also the tale
Of the dish making off with that spoon.
Now, not to make off with a spoon when there?s moon,
Is a far more astonishing thing;
And to see the moon wriggle?oh, hey, diddle, diddle,
In that case you really might sing.

Solomon Simon met a snake,
He passed the time of day,
And next time you?re not wide awake,

And curled up in a hurry.

Sweet dreams, but I must scurry.?
Ethel Turner, Gum Leaves (1900)

Mary had a little shark,
Its teeth were pearly white.
She said, ?Alas! it cannot bark,
Though, bless me, can?t it bite.
?To keep the burglars bold away
Each night we turn it loose;
But it can?t run as fast as they,
And isn?t any use.
?But stay,? she cried, and clapped her hand,
And started off to run,
?l?ll take it to a dog-fish, and
Twill learn to bark like fun.?
Ethel Turner, Gum Leaves (1900)
My Pet
Have you seen the cat of Dorothy
Lee?
The one she calls her Catty-Puss?
If she?s proud of her pet, then what
should I be?
I?ve got a duck-billed Platypus.
Ethel Turner, Gum Leaves (1900)
It would seem that only after there was an appreciation of
and a growing demand for adult Australian literature, could
there be a corresponding and fruitful regard for locally written
children?s literature as well. Although Angus & Robertson,
who were to become Australia?s best-known publishers of
children?s books, had issued their first such title in 1896
(Louise Mack?s Teens), the regular appearance of children?s
books and the establishment of a stable of children?s authors
and illustrators did not begin until 1918. In that year we
welcomed The Magic Pudding and Snugglepot and Cuddlepie
and soon conferred classic status on them.
Australian children?s literature is therefore almost
exclusively a product of the twentieth century and received
considerable impetus from frequent statements made around
the turn of the century advocating a national literature for our
children. In terms of verse, that demand was met most
effectively during this period through the composition of
children?s songs. One of the earliest statements in this
direction was voiced in the ?Preface? to Edith Walker's Song
Stories of Australia for Little People (c. 1905):
It was possible to obtain many books of children?s
songs, but these were mostly of English, American and
German authorship, and it was necessary to change
and adapt words in most of the songs contained in
them before they could be used. There was none
among them which could tell the story 0f... our own
far Southern Land ...
In the schools, too, there is a rapidly increasing
demand for songs which shall have a special
significance for Australian children ... It is through
the medium of such songs that the spirit of patriotism
may receive its first stimulus ...

So far there has been but little attempted here in this
direction, and the Australian Child-World is lacking in
that which will surely become one of its greatest
sources of inspiration and development.
Of all the song books for children, those which enjoyed
the most widespread popularity date from this period and
were a trilogy issued between 1907 and 1913: Australian Songs
for Young and Old, Bush Songs of Australia for Young and Old
and More Australian Songs for Young and Old. 17 Some of these
songs permeated Australian culture to such an extent that they
remained current in school and nursery life until at least the
early 19605. There was hardly a child in the school system
before this who could not join in with two particular national
favourites from Bush Songs (1910): 'Kangaroo' and
'Kookooburra'.
Kangaroo Song
Old Bumpery Jumpety Hop and Go One
Was lying at ease on his side in the sun,
And this old Kangaroo, he was whisking the flies
With his glossy long tail from his coat and his eyes.
Bumpery Jumpety Hop and Go One,
Hop and Go One, Hop and Go One,
Sleep with an eye open out in the sun,
Bumpety Jumpety Hop.
He was wild in his youth was this old Kangaroo,
And learnt from experience all that he knew.
He could tackle a rabbiter?s pack, one and all,
For they often had hunted him, when he was small.
Bumpety Jumpety, etc.
Now foolish young Frisky, the woodcutter?s dog,
Came peeping at Bumpety over a log,
So it?s ?Up, Boys, and at im!? he barked to the pack,
And ?Right! we are coming!? the others barked back.
Bumpety Jumpety, etc.
I wish you had seen how old Bumpety stood
And boxed all their ears in the heart of the wood!
And he hopped off in triumph as soon as he?d done,
So we?ll all cry ?Hurroosha!? for Hop and Go One!
Bumpety Jumpety, etc.
Annie R. Rentoul, Bush Songs of Australia for Young
and Old (1910)
Kookooburra
(The Laughing Jackass)
Kookooburra, Kookooburra, sitting on a gum tree,
High among the branches, up tip-top,


When a lizard passes, rustling in the grasses,
Down you pounce and catch him,
flip, flap, flop!
Chorus ?( after each verse]
Kook-kook, Kook-kook! Then you chuckle gaily,
Laugh your merry laughter, ha-ha, hoo-hoo, hoo,
Ha-ha, hoo-hoo, ha-ha, hoo-hoo, ha-ha, hoo-hoo, ha-ha!
Till you make our sides ache laughing at you\
Kookooburra, Kookooburra, with your eyes of amber
Underneath a top-knot soft and gray,
Fluffety and funny, sweet as baby bunny,
When we want to talk, you fly away!
Kookooburra, Kookooburra, little soft blue feathers
Grow along your jacket round each wing!
When we think you sleeping, often we come peeping
Down below the gum-boughs, where you swing.
Kookooburra, Kookooburra, we got bushed at sundown!
Snakes and skeeturs scared us all around!
Then you came and sought us, laughing till you brought us
To the dear home-paddock safe and sound!
Annie R. Rentoul, Bush Songs of Australia for Young
and Old (1910)
So widespread and timeless has the appeal of these
nursery songs been, so enshrined are they in our national
consciousness that they can be said to have reached folklore
status.
Indeed, ?Kookooburra? was so much a part of national
childhood that it has received the final accolade: school
children appropriated it into their oral folklore by adding rude
rhymes to its basic format. Reminiscences of a World War I
childhood included class singing in school:
Class singing was the last thing of Friday ...
There was the kookaburra song, and in the first stanza
we could use all the shocking words which we would
never use at any other time.
Kookaburra, Kookaburra, [Cook you bugger, Cook
you bugger,]
S [h] its in an old gum tree
Until a lizard passes,
Rustling through the gr[arses]. 18
In these pre-war years the Calverts? alphabets of the 1870s
were not forgotten and two outstanding examples were published,
both in 1905. Today they are extremely rare and virtually
unknown but both are notable Australiana items which relied on
local content for their inspiration: The ABC Book of Beasts and
Birds and What I Saw at the Melbourne Zoo (1905) and The

Gum Leaves (1900) was the first book of
Ethel Turner's to be published in Australia and
included a number of short verses inspired
by nursery lore.
'The Jackass' by Edith Alsop from Some Children's Songs (1910). Songbooks of this time
were striving to offer nationalistic inspiration and colour to Australian children who were more
familiar with imported British culture. Like the kookaburra in the cage, the local product
would have been regarded as a curiosity!

What Rhymes with ?Bunyip??
?When the drought breaks the rabbits will come?
During this same period, at the beginning of the twentieth
century, some scattered whispers of local nursery rhymes began to
be heard, contributing to what was to become a more confident
voice in the post-war years. Thus in 1908, quite without precedent
or preamble, the Bulletin published six Australian nursery rhymes?
by E.R. 21 All were variations on traditional rhymes with
localisations to make them culture specific to Australia:
Goosey Goosey Gander,
Whither do you wander?
Your place is in the poultry yard
And not on the verandah.

I had a little pony,
His name was Dapple Gray.
I sent him down to Melbourne,
To win the Cup one day.

And now he pulls a hansom cab
Along a Sydney street.

Ever since its inception in 1880 the Bulletin had
promoted Australian folk culture in terms of narrative ballads,
bush humour and tall stories. Furthermore, its critical forum,
the ?Red Page?, was prepared to promote and review writing
for Australian children, as well as adult literature. The depth
of such enthusiasm and encouragement and the Page?s wide-
ranging coverage is shown by its comment on something as
ephemeral as a school magazine:
There?s a very urgent need for someone to arise and
shout the word Australia in the collective ear of the
varlets who run the State School Magazine of N.S.W.
They are doing much harm to Australian writers by
virtually training every kiddy from Hungerford to
Albury in the belief that his (and her) country is so
drought-stricken in letters that it has to loaf on other
lands for literary pabulum. 22
This is an example chosen from many which also serves
to place the promotion of something as esoteric as Australian
nursery rhymes as a less unexpected occurrence and in line
with discernible editorial policy.
The accolade of having such verse featured in the Bulletin in
1908 did not inspire a sustained interest in Australian nursery
rhymes. One isolated plea for indigenous nursery rhymes was
voiced in 1912 by a little-known poet, George Herbert
Gibson in his Ironbark Splinters from the Australian Bush. In a
section headed 'Nursery rhymes for infant pastoralists',
Gibson made an eloquent, if somewhat tongue in cheek,
demand for an Australian contribution:
The present writer has often deplored the scarcity of
really suitable books for Australian children?both
prose and verse?and, with regard to the latter,
especially, he has observed that the talented authors of
?Old Mother Hubbard?, and ?Sing a Song of Sixpence?,
etc., have in modern times had but few and
exceedingly feeble successors. He has, therefore, sought
in a humble way to supply what may be truthfully
described as a long-felt want, and, taking the classic
nursery rhymes of our childhood as a model or basis,
he has endeavoured to adapt them to the requirements
of the present age and a pastoral country: also, while
striving to preserve the purity of thought, and high
moral tone which characterise such classical
masterpieces as ?Baa, Baa, Black Sheep?, an effort has
been made to beguile the infant mind with realistic
situations, and local colour, in artful combination with
elementary information about finance and station
management. 2 '
George Herbert Gibson (1846-1921) emigrated to New
South Wales in his twenties. After some work in the outback
he joined the Department of Lands in 1876 and retired from
there in 1915 as an Inspector. In this capacity he travelled
widely throughout the state and gained first-hand knowledge
of sheep and cattle stations and of bush life generally. All this
experience informs his usually light-hearted and lively ballads
which were very popular in his lifetime. Gibson?s last book was
his 1912 volume of poems in which his adoption of the
nursery rhyme format added an arresting and different note to
his more usual choice of extended and narrative verse forms.
These rather bleak little rhymes are certainly aimed more
at an adult audience than infant Australians, and much of


their effect and impact obviously depends on the evocative
expectations which would be aroused in adult readers and
then confounded by the stark and cynical truth of their
sentiments.
See, saw, process of law,
The station must have a new master;
This one makes but a penny a day
?Cos wool won?t grow any faster.
G. Herbert Gibson, Ironbark Splinters from
the Australian Bush (1912)

Sheep grew wool for mortgagees.
Mortgagees came every day:
They grew rich, while I grew? gref.

Baa, baa, black sheep,
Have you any wool?
Yes, sir, oh yes, sir! three bales full.
One for the master, who grows so lean and lank;
None for the mistress,
But two for the Bank!

On the eve of World War I, a significant volume of brief essays
appeared in Sydney written by Donald E. Fraser, Inspector of
Schools for the Public Instruction Department. 24 Fraser
(1864-1918) was a popular, if minor, contributor to the
Bulletin and other papers where he wrote under the
pseudonym Jimmie Pannikin. His collected essays had
attracted widespread attention when they first appeared in The
Australian Worker.
Fraser was one of the earliest and most persistent
advocates for a significant Australian content in the school
curriculum. He also voiced a pioneering plea for a


reassessment and a reinvigoration of the place of folklore in
the lives of Australian children:
Australian fairy tales and Australian folk-lore do not
get sufficient attention in our schools; yet there is
good native-born material ready to hand. 25
Fraser has never been given the credit he deserves for his
campaign against a trivialising attitude to the interests and
conditions of Australian child-life earlier this century. He saw
value in the culture of young Australia and advocated a
consistent patriotic sentiment that permeated all aspects of
national life and not merely the realm of childhood:
If ye really wish to cultivate a healthy, vigorous
Australian sentiment in our schools ... it is not
enough that we should preach and teach patriotism.
We must practise it persistently and intelligently, by
helping, as best we may, all that makes for the
encouragement and growth of Australian ideas,
Australian literature, Australian Science, Australian
manufactures and inventions, all Australian life and
labor and living. 26
Unfortunately Fraser?s voice was understandably lost in
the hubbub of a nation going to war and adopting urgent new
priorities. His early death in April 1918 removed someone
whose proselytising interest in all things Australian would have
been aroused by the unparalleled range of children?s literature,
verse and nursery rhyme which appeared from Christmas
1918 and through into the early 19205.
The Australian Worker provided a forum for Fraser?s
pioneering support of Australian children?s folklore and
literature and their publication of his collected essays in 1914
may have encouraged another contributor to the same paper
to follow suit. Mary Gilmore, in her ?Women?s Page? of that
paper, tried to encourage readers to send in children?s play
rhymes. The poor response, however, resulted in only one
memorable Australian example:
Kangaroo and wallabee,
Hopping o?er the mountain free;
Paddy-melon not too slow,
One, two, three, and out you go.
Anon, The Australian 1 October 1914)
In desperation, thereafter, Mary Gilmore turned to reprinting
traditional English nursery rhymes in the next few issues. 27
In November 1917, the first significant twentieth-
century volume of Australian ?kiddie songs? for children
appeared: Furnley Maurice?s The Bay and Padie Book: Kiddie
Songs. The work was reprinted five times over the next thirty
years, yet today its appeal has quite faded. Its overly
sentimental verse which sometimes descends into baby talk
contains little memorable nursery verse. One of the few
exceptions is the first stanza of Maurice?s ?Sleep Song?:
Half-past bunny-time,
Possums by the moon;
Tea and bread-and-honey time,
Sleep-time soon.
Furnley Maurice, The Bay and Padie Book (1917)
The poet?s most renowned use of the nursery rhyme
format actually occurs in a powerful adult poem, ?Nursery
Rhyme?, published three years later:
One year, two year, three year, four,
Comes a khaki gentleman knocking at the door;
Any little boys at home? Send them out to me,


To train them and brain them in battles yet to be.
Five year, six year, seven year, eight,
Hurry up, you little chaps, the captain?s at the gate ...
Furnley Maurice, Eyes of Vigilance (1920)
Apart from George H. Gibson?s bleak and uncompromising
nursery rhymes of 1912 there are very few Australian examples
which depict the rigours, as opposed to the sentimentalities, of
rural life. Nineteenth-century Victorian strictures against the
common touch and cruelty in nursery rhymes deprived a
young audience of much that it enjoys and left it in an
expurgated imaginative territory. Most Australian writers of
nursery rhymes have tended to accept this circumscribed
realm and although the rural experience provides the prime
inspiration for our nursery rhymes it is a vision almost entirely
bereft of the cruel realities our bush poets captured last
century (an imbalance that still persists today).
One of the very few exceptions appeared in 1917:
Thomas Gunn?s Nursery Rhymes. Like Gibson, Thomas Gunn
(1873?1950) had direct experience of life on the land?he
was a grazier in the Maranoa District and knew at first hand
the arbitrary nature of rural life. His nursery rhyme ?Old Black
Crow? captures this feeling and presents it in a stark verse with
the appropriate feel of an old ballad:
Car, car, car, car, old black crow,
Where do you fly to when you go?
Where do you fly to past the trees?
Car, car, black crow, tell me please.
Car, car, nuby old black crow,
Do you pick eyes out where you go?
Do you pick eyes out, you black brute?
Car ?No? quickly, or I?ll shoot.
Thomas Gunn, Nursery Rhymes (1917)
Gunn?s slight pamphlet of thirteen Australian nursery
rhymes is perhaps the first separate local printing in this genre
since Who Killed Cockatoo? appeared almost fifty years earlier. In
the intervening years, while young colonials had been well
served by a plethora of imported printings of traditional English
nursery rhymes, any indigenous touch had not been honoured
with a published format beyond the pages of our daily press.
Gunn?s pioneering collection was augmented with a further
eleven verses and published in 1920 as Bush Nursery Rhymes.
Give a nice little root to the bandicoot.
To the ?possum a sweet gum tree,
And grass will do for the kangaroo,
But bread and milk for me.
Thomas Gunn, Nursery Rhymes (1917)
The Old Black Hen
?Cac, cac, cackle,? said the old black hen,
?l?ve laid an egg, and it?s one in ten;
Where 1 have laid it nobody knows,
But it?s safely hid from the bad black crows.?
?Cac, cac, cackle,? said the old black hen,
?l?ve laid an egg, and it?s one in ten.?
Thomas Gunn, Nursery Rhymes (1917)
Toast for Tommy
Toast for Tommy, and toast for tea,
Toast for Winnie, and toast for me,
Toast for Flora, and toast for Mum,
Toast the bread and we ll all have some.
Thomas Gunn, Bush Nursery Rhymes (1920)
In looking back over twenty years of scattered
contributions of Australian nursery rhymes, it is apparent that


* <^ ee -
there was a slight but growing demand for this genre: from the
first intimations of folkloric interest in Australian children
appearing in the Bulletin of 1898 (the beginning of indigenous
nursery songs), the Bulletins further interest in E.R.?s nursery
rhymes of 1908, the application of the nursery rhyme format
to adult verse by George Gibson in 1912, the call from
Donald Fraser in 1914 for ?patriotic? literature at all levels, and
Mary Gilmore?s unanswered call in the same year for more
children?s play rhymes, to the actual appearance of a pamphlet
of indigenous nursery rhymes by Thomas Gunn in 1917.
Such local efforts need to be seen in context and
competition with publications of traditional nursery rhymes
which were usually superior imported printings. One
competitive local example which catered to traditional interest
in a charming, if ephemeral, way was a suite of six nursery
postcards published c.1906 by the New South Wales Bookstall
Company. The illustrator Muriel G. Nicholls (1879??), who
was said to produce child studies ?better than Kate
Greenaway?, later went on to contribute illustrations to
Australian Nursery Rimes (1917).
However, so far as local efforts are concerned, their
tentative interest and halting starts appear in retrospect to be
part of an emerging concern for indigenous culture on all
fronts. And it was once again through the pages of the Bulletin
(at the end of 1917) that specific interest in Australian nursery
rhymes achieved its first major and national success.


Chapter 4
Folklore Made to Order
c The man from Menindee was counting sheep?
Previous examples of interest in Australian nursery rhymes,
extending from 1908 to 1917, were totally eclipsed when the
Bulletin again entered the field in late 1917. This time,
however, the conception, scope and result were radically
different from anything previously attempted. The Bulletin
proposed a competition, a search for nursery literature that
was aware of and catered to the idiosyncratic outlook of the
Australian child.
And it is surely significant that this was not merely an
invitation to previous literary contributors to the ?Red Page?
but something that sought to tap family folklore and
invention, something that reached out to the broader
population of readers Australia-wide. The Bulletin obviously
expected that its quest would attract widespread interest and
that it had an engaging relevance for the times.
Thus in August 1917 the newspaper issued the following
challenge:
Surely Australian nursery songs are as important
(nearly) as Australian drama or fiction. This field has
been almost entirely neglected, in spite of a large and
expectant public ... At present we have to give our
youngsters ?Banbury Cross? and ?Dick Whittington?
and ?l?ve been to London to see the Queen? ?which
are quite out of place in this land of kangaroos, rabbits
and politicians.
A guinea will be given for the best nursery rime
written by an Australian ... No parodies will be
accepted ... Competitors need not deliberately drag in
Australian references or Australian color ?an
Australian kid wouldn?t. A good Australian nursery
rime may have no direct reference to Australian
conditions, yet may be indubitably Australian in
content. The Australian kid has an outlook different
from that of an English kid: the sort of songs he wants
to sing will not be those that the English kid sings. 28
The wartime genesis of this imaginative call to arms
should not be overlooked. In Sydney in particular, the 1914?18
war years witnessed the production of some of the most
treasured Australian children?s classics: May Gibbs? diminutive
series of bushland booklets culminated in Snugglepot and
Cuddlepie which, together with Norman Lindsay?s The Magic
Pudding, was published in 1918. These works should most
properly be seen and evaluated as part of the pictorial
propaganda of a nation finding, for the first time, a national


bond of shared imagery and sentiment which proudly
proclaimed Australia. More ephemeral works like May Gibbs?
postcards of the gumnut corps, Lionel Lindsay?s full-page
?Chunder Loo? illustrations in the Bulletin and alphabet books
like Young Australia?s ABC of the War all contributed to boosting
national morale. The Bulletins nursery ?rime? competition was
part of this broader activity and illustrates how all levels of
culture, particularly folklore, are called into action as effective
weapons in times of national threat.
The answer to the Bulletins challenge was extraordinary
?one thousand entries were received in six weeks and the
entire ?Red Page? for 18 October 1917 was devoted to
representative contributions and an accompanying editorial
analysis.
The Bulletin ?rimes? were discussed under six categories; ?Abo.
rimes, Station-life, City-life, Nonsense rimes, Natural History,
and War-rimes?. The distinctions between these categories
aren?t always clear and other sub-categories such as ?Home
Life? and ?the Moral Tale? were introduced in the main body of
the text. Nevertheless, these six categories derived from thirty-
two ?rimes? are presumably a representative guide to the one
thousand contributions received.
The two examples categorised as belonging to the Abo.-
class? are diametrically different and highlight opposing
attitudes of the day. ?Take a stick? draws on native legend in an
effort to connect young white Australians to a wealth of
possible nursery lore other than their traditional English
source material. On the other hand, ?Little Ji-ka Ji-ka? offers,
by today?s standards, an offensive and demeaning stereotype.
The category ?Station-life? provided four examples and
some of the most outstanding ?rimes? of all. However, they
present an expurgated vision of outback life without any
sense of the threat and privation of that experience. The
complementary category ?City-life? provided two succinct
quatrains although possibly the most memorable is an
example in the sub-category ?Home Life?: ?Sonny boy, sonny
boy? is actually a poignant little ?rime? in which the
sentiment and the grim wartime reality behind the
apparently sing-song lines remind us that there would have
been many lonely families with husbands and fathers away at
the war.
?Nonsense rimes? provided the second largest category of
all, almost a quarter of the ?rimes? selected. More than half of
these take their inspiration from native Australian fauna and if
added to the ?Natural History? category become half of all the
?rimes? published on the ?Red Page?. Now while it is not
surprising that native Australian fauna and their antics should
provide pre-eminent inspiration to our nursery ?rime poets
there are other sources of inspiration whose failure to arouse
interest should also be commented upon. This is assuming, of
course, that the Bulletins categories and the number of
examples therein are proportionally representative of the one
thousand entries received.
Ir is surprising that there is only one outright war ?rime?:
?Over the sea is my Daddy to-day?. Once again, as with the
expurgated vision of the outback, one wonders why the war, ?a
paramount interest in most Australian kiddies? minds?, was so
meagrely represented. And almost entirely absent as a major
source of inspiration is the motivation behind The Magic
Pudding published only the very next year ?food! Surely some
of our most memorable traditional nursery verse is heavily


oriented towards an interest in food? Why were these
Australian examples deficient?
And apart from D.H. Souter?s ?The Man from
Mungundi (later changed to ?The Man from Menindie?) there
was little evidence that euphonious Australian place names
were a source of amusement and inspiration. Only the year
before in England the names of various London parishes had
provided inspiration for what was probably the most significant
volume of newly-minted nursery rhymes this century: Eleanor
Farjeon?s Nursery Rhymes of London Town (1916).
The large-scale public interest in the Bulletins
competition encouraged a reprint of the entire ?Red Page? for
18 October 1917 as an individual sheet. 29 Even more
significantly, fourteen of these ?rimes? were then selected for
publication in an illustrated Christmas booklet entitled
Australian Nursery Rimes (1917). An edition of ten thousand
copies was produced?an enormous print run for any
Australian publication at the time let alone a children?s item.
Presumably the booklet was a great success and novelty for
Christmas 1917. Perhaps its rarity today means that it was
literally read to pieces: in the last decade only two copies have
appeared in antiquarian bookseller?s catalogues.
In Australian Nursery Rimes , D.H. Souter alone was
accorded space for two verses; all twelve other contributors
were represented by only a single verse each. Additionally, one
of Souter?s verses was chosen to open the publication. And it is
not difficult to see why this pre-eminence was granted to
Souter s work nor why he shared the prize for the best work:
both of his nursery ?rimes? display the classic hallmarks of the
genre.
?The Man from Menindie? and ?There Was a Little
Rabbit? are succinct statements in verse; they present just
enough and no more. There is no extraneous detail, no
elaboration or justification and their impact is thus direct and
concise. Equally, their effect is also achieved by a forthright
rhyme and metre that finishes the whole with an air of
inevitability. There is a sing-song lilt to these ?rimes? although
they never descend into mere doggerel. There is nothing
precious and forced in their language or sentiment; they are
not simply wordplay to accommodate a rhyme or to embody a
quaint idea. There is narrative purpose and appeal in their
cyclical structure and even though they are culture specific for
Australia they do not fail to achieve a universality of appeal.
The final hallmark of these two nursery ?rimes? is the complete
lack of a self-conscious manner on Souter?s part in writing for
the young.
To a greater or lesser extent all other contributors to
Australian Nursery Rimes suffer in comparison with Souter?s
work, exhibiting as they do some of the above limitations.
One figure who could probably have matched Souter?s
engaging wordplay and wit only contributed illustrations to
the booklet. Norman Lindsay was at the time writing The
Magic Pudding and the success of its rambunctious adventure
is partly attributable to the Gilbert and Sullivan type songs
and verses which he liberally added to the story line. As this
nonsense verse from The Magic Pudding shows, Lindsay could
also have been a talented author of nursery rhymes.
?Onions, bunions, corns and crabs,
Whiskers, wheels and hansom cabs,
Beef and bottles, beer and bones,
Give him a feed and end his groans.?
Norman Lindsay, The Magic Pudding (1918)
Souter?s grasp of nursery rhyme essentials was exactly in
line with the thinking of the Bulletins editor in 1917, Arthur


Henry Adams (1872-1936), who actually held that esteemed
position twice between 1906 and 1919. Adams was a widely
experienced journalist and a respected author, poet, literary
critic and playwright. He was also a keen supporter of
Australian literary endeavours and particularly championed a
role for locally written drama. Adams? final words on nursery
rhymes were appended as a postscript to Australian Nursery
Rimes in which he stressed two major things: that the ?rimes?
originated to fulfil an expressed desire by Australian children
and that they were part of family folklore:
The interesting fact came to light that many of these
rimes were in actual use in the homes of the authors.
Evidently the Australian child had felt the need for
Nursery Rimes that fitted its environment more
familiarly than the traditional English Nursery Rimes;
and his father or mother had to satisfy that natural
instinct by putting Australian animals and birds,
Australian conditions out-back and in the cities, into
home-made Australian Rimes. 30
Viewed in this way, the Bulletins nursery ?rime?
competition of 1917 becomes the first major attempt in
Australia to record children?s folklore. A recognition of this
pioneering interest illuminates the almost invisible landscape
of family folklore in Australia and helps to offset the myth that
such interest was not evident until the second half of the
twentieth century.


The Red Page
Australian Nursery Rimes
The kid that edits this page has had approximately a thousand
Australian nursery rimes to choose from. He has even found a
few genuine Australian rimes already sung by our kiddies.
Ethel Pawley has heard Australian kiddies sing:?
Captain Cook
Broke his hook
Fishing for Australia.
Captain Cook
Wrote a book
All about Australia.
That is the best our folk-lore has done: we can consciously do
much better.
A number of competitors make the suggestion that from
the selected nursery rimes a children?s illustrated book should
be made, for sale at Christmas for a war-fund. The results of
this competition will be submitted to a publisher, though time
is short for the publication of such a book, properly
illustrated, by the Christmas season. The consent of all
competitors to such a scheme is taken for granted, and each
selected contribution will bear its author?s signature.
Despite our prohibition many parodies were sent in,
though in some cases these were mere Australian versions of well-
known nursery rime-forms. Thus it seems hard to overlook a
pleasant and genuinely Australian variant of ?Ten Little Nigger
Boys, in which ?Ten Little Rabbits? are similarly decimated, since
their fates are genuinely Australian. The author?s name has been
lost, owing to his, or her, failing to sign every page of the MS.
Ten Little Rabbits
Ten little Rabbits playing round a mine,
One slipped down a shaft, then there were nine.
Nine little Rabbits, hopping through a gate,
One caught in a snare, then there were eight.
Eight little Rabbits, gazing up to Heaven,
An eagle hawk swooped down on one, then there were
seven.
Seven little Rabbits, up to their tricks,
When a red fox grabbed one, then there were six.
Six little Rabbits, hunted in a drive,
One got a dose of shot, then there were five.
Five little Rabbits, drinking round a bore,
One got squirted up, then there were four.
Four little Rabbits, scratching round a tree,
One ate a quince-jam bait, and then there were three.
Three little Rabbits saw a jackeroo,
One got asphyxiated, then there were two.
Two little Rabbits, flirting in the sun,
A gohanna swallowed one, then there was one.
One little Rabbit, feeling lonely, when
She had a family, and again there were ten.
Many competitors made the mistake of forwarding long
narrative rimes. Where the youngster wants narrative it must
be short. Act One: Enter Miss Muffet, sits, eats curds and
whey. Act Two: Enter Spider, sits beside her. Act Three: Exit
Miss Muffet. Curtain. When the mouse ran up the clock all it
did was to run down again. The black hen merely laid eggs,
with a feminine desire to please the male, for gentlemen.


Sometimes she laid nine, and occasionally, with a praiseworthy
effort, ten. Georgie Porgie bravely kissed the girls, but they
inexplicably wept. However, when they began to play, he
merely ran away. Though there is a second verse to the
accident to Jack and Jill, few children want that anti-climax.
Mary?s lamb has three verses and a moral, though no child is
interested in its subsequent adventures. There are exceptions,
of course, but these are nursery rimes that kiddies have to have
read to them.
The classical example of nursery rimes, ?Hey, Diddle,
Diddle!? illustrates the perfect form. The child merely wants
moving pictures?puss plays a fiddle, a cow makes a
magnificent leap, a dog breaks into mistimed hilarity, and an
elopement occurs among the table cutlery. These pictures have
no connection with each other: there is no short-story?just
haphazard pictures of things familiar to the child?s mind. And
nothing that is flashed on the child?s mental screen appears
ludicrous to it; these happenings are, in the child?s mental
world, interesting and possible.
Many competitors were too clever, too sophisticated. Some
gave us pathos for grown-ups. Some even inflicted puns on the
kid. Many told stories q/lcicls, not to kids. A few wrote lullabies,
not nursery rimes. Though nursery rimes are in the first instance
taught to children, their delight is to learn them themselves. And
many rimes were spoilt by a roughness of the metre: the kid?s ear
will pass by many faults if the tune goes trippingly.
The rimes submitted may be roughly divided into these
classes: Abo. rimes, Station-life, City-life, Nonsense rimes,
Natural History, and War-rimes.
In the Abo.-class Joice M. Nankivell gives us the abo.-
version of the kookkooburra?s laugh, which means in native
language: ?Take a stick.?
Goug gour gahgah, goug gour gahgah,
Laughs the Kookkooburra,
Goug gour gahgah, goug gour gahgah,
Loud to one another;
Goug gour gahgah, take a stick,
Goug gour gahgah, take it quick,
Kookkooburra, Kookkooburra;
Goug gour gahgah, throw it high,
Till at last it strikes the sky,
Goug gour gahgah, goug gour gahgah,
There it sets the sun a-burning,
And assures the days returning,
Goug gour gahgah, goug gour gahgah,
Kookkooburra, Kookkooburra.
The native names in the following, Angela Kennedy
assures us, are well known:?
Little Ji-ka Ji-ka! All the darkies like her
In her dainty Sunday dress and pinny.
Give her wattle-blossom and a joey possum?
She?s a good Australian piccaninny.
And she lives outside Benalla with her father, Doutta Galla,
Who eats snakes for breakfast till he?s pale.
He kills them with a waddy, and devours the head and
body?
And little Ji-ka Ji-ka eats the tail!
??Ma?w?�r ?


The war has become a paramount interest in most
Australian kiddies? minds. H.W. Stewart provides the best
Kid?s Complete History of the War: ?
Over the sea is my Daddy to-day,
Over the sea in Flanders.
When I feel lonely for him I say:
Daddy has gone with the guns
Fighting the German Huns
Over the sea in Flanders?
Gone with the guns
Fighting the Huns
Over the sea in Flanders.
The Moral Tale is not strictly a nursery rime: it is merely
a mean advantage taken by the grown-up to frighten the kid.
However, as a curiosity, Jean Macpherson?s is printed for its
Australian setting:?
The fierce and frightful Bunyip
Lives in a lonely scrub,
And catches all the dirty boys
Who do not like their tub.
He has a rapid aeroplane
Steered by a flying-fox,
To grab the naughty little girls
Who never darn their sox.
And many a boy who played the wag
The fearsome Bunyip caught,
And girls who would not do their task
Back to his den he brought.
There in a dark and horrid pool
He soaks the dirty boys,
And feeds small bunyips on the girls
In spite of all their noise.
Home Life in town and country is responsible for some
delightful rimes. R.H. Croll, taking advantage of the license
allowed in nursery riming, gives us this delightful dressing
song: but it is a song for Mother, not for the kid.
Sonny boy, sonny boy, just me and you.
Here?s a little jacket, here?s a little shoe.
Daddy?s gone to fight for him, far away in France.

G.K. Soward?s rime deserves space because it aptly
expresses the Australian liking for the rain. Where the English
kid tells his rain to go away and come again another day, the
Australian youngster sings this:?


Rain! Rain!
Come, down with you rain!
Don?t keep away any longer.
The holes are all dry,
And mummy will cry
If you keep away any longer!
Rain! Rain!
You?ll get the cane
If you stay away any longer!
My daddy will sigh,
And the little lambs die,
If you stay away any longer!
Rain! Rain!
Dear, ducky rain,
Don?t stay away any longer!
I?ll buy you a train
And a sweet silver chain,
If you won?t stay away any longer!
Two Outback vignettes: ?

With your baby in your pouch will you hop, hop, hop?

And he laughs, and he laughs, as if he couldn?t stop.
He gives Mrs. ?Possum a pain in her head,
For he always wants to laugh when she wants to go to bed.

Six fat geese were grazing by the shore,
They gobbled up grass till they could eat no more.
One flew east and one flew west,
And one flew onto a bulldog?s nest.


One flew north and one flew south,
One flew into a dingo?s mouth.
The one that flew east fell into the sea,
The one that flew west stuck in a mulga tree,
The one that flew south had a long way to go.
And then got smothered in the drifting snow.
The one that flew north was the fattest of the lot,
So I twisted her neck and put her in the pot.
J.H.
The weather is going to change!
Jackasses are down from the range.
When you hear that jovial scoff,
Wet seasons are not far off.

There was once a baby Roo, Baby Roo,
In a valley where the mallee
And the grasses always grew.
He would hop and skip and jump, Baby ?Roo,
Such a happy little chappie,
Such a pretty fellow, too.
And when he was tired of play, Baby ?Roo,
Niddy-noddy, sleepy-body,
Do you know what he would do?
Jump into his mother?s pocket! Baby ?Roo,
Curl up warm there, safe from harm there,
Sleep and dream the whole night through.

There was a little Rabbit
That was hiding in his burrow,

So he found another burrow
And the Dingo didn?t eat him.

Every kid will have his or her preference: this kid confesses
to several. ?Six White Cats? has the right jingle, but the pub-pub-
pub jars. Father is more likely to be found there. Funny; but
would kiddies think it funny? Somehow this kid suspects it will
become popular. 'Josephine's' Baby 'Roo is neat and charming,
but too matter-of-fact for the child's wandering mind. 'Bill's'
Kookaburra who greeted Captain Cook is too clever. Some
unnecessary lines, omitted by this page, put 'Six Fat Geese' out
of the running. 'Rain, rain!' will be popular outback; but it seems
to have one verse too many. Too long, too, is N.M.H. s story of
Billy Kooka and his mate. 'Old Mother Kangaroo' has the right
atmosphere; 'Little Billy Bandicoot' has none: he is just a drab
fact. 'Muster, muster!' has the right rime and metre, and the
ludicrous surprise for its climax. 'Kangaroo, carry me,' is apt but
rather slight: and 'Wallaby, Wallaby, why do you jump?' rightly
asks the question without burdening the kid's mind with the
answer. The 'Five Grey Rabbits' is fearfully exciting, and there is
a thrilling climax. It is sure to be popular, owing to its galloping
metre. But this kid's personal preference must be divided
between 'Old Bob's Canter,' by Walter E. Perroux, Proserpine,
Q., and 'The Man from Mungundi,' by D.H. Souter, Sydney,
whose name sometimes is signed in other parts of this paper. The
guinea is divided between them, and all other rimes printed will
be paid for. 31

The engaging cover design by Harry Weston to
Australian Nursery Rimes (1917) clearly announces
what is to be found within: indigenous rhymes for
young Australians. The Bulletin competition which
produced these 'rimes' was the first major attempt to
provide made-to-order children's folklore in Australia.
While a few of these 'rimes' have entered our oral
tradition and are well remembered, the booklet is
rarely sighted today and is here reproduced
in its entirety.

Chapter 5
'Kid Rhymes'
'Out across the spinifex, out across the sand'
The Bulletin competition of late 1917 was the specific catalyst
behind at least two other significant nursery rhyme projects in
Sydney immediately after the war. However, there were other
more general factors at the time which contributed to a broad
interest in and demand for nursery literature, both traditional
and indigenous.
In the post-war years, the publication of Australian
children?s books became firmly centred in Sydney with Angus
& Robertson maintaining the lead they had established in
1918 with The Magic Pudding and Snugglepot and Cuddlepie.
At the beginning of the second decade they issued such major
titles as the first post-war edition of Dot and the Kangaroo
(1920), May Gibbs? Little Ragged Blossom (1920) and Little
Obelia (1921), C.J. Dennis? A Book for Kids (1921) and Amy
Mack?s Bushland Stories (1921). A stable of children?s authors
and illustrators was thus being established and their efforts
presented as part of mainstream publishing activities.
Furthermore, Australian children?s folklore was being
made-to-order in the pages of May Gibbs. An oral tradition of
cautionary tales had grown up in Australia, particularly for the
rural child and these were the beginning of indigenous
folklore for Australian youth;
The average bush youngster has a horror of darkness,
and talks in awe-struck whispers of hairy men, ghosts,
and bunyips. This fear is inculcated from babyhood.
The mother can?t always be watching in a playground
that is boundless, and she knows the horrors that wait
the bushed youngster. So she tells them there is a
bunyip in the lagoon, and gigantic eels in the creek;
and beyond that hill there, and in yonder scrub, there
is a ?bogey-man.? 32
Such folklore was finally given a pictorial dimension in
the work of May Gibbs; her banksia man was the embodiment
of these ?hairy men? lurking in the bush. Equally, her gumnut
babies were an almost elemental derivation from the
Australian bushland flora itself and from their very first
appearance were seen to be ?a genuine and an original
contribution to our Australian folklore?. 33 Her characters
contributed to a national pictorial vocabulary; an indigenous
family of nursery favourites for Australian children.
May?s delight in wordplay frequently bubbles to the
surface in her stories: the very names Snugglepot and
Cuddlepie are themselves clear evidence of this delight. Their
plosive, full-bodied sound rolls around the mouth and shows


that May possessed a keen ear attuned to language suitable for
the nursery. Significantly, one of her earliest projects for
children was entitled ?Nursery Rhymes from the Bush?
(c.1905). Unfortunately, its Australiana content failed to
interest a London publisher and when May was finally in
demand, back in Australia, she did not revive this project.
May Gibbs did, however, make some contributions to
our nursery rhyme lore. In 1924 Chucklebud and Wunkydoo
included a most soothing lullaby sung by Mrs Possum to a
sleepy gumnut baby:
There, there, Soo, Soo,
Never care, Soo, Soo,
Day?s done, Soo, Soo,
Night?s begun, Soo, Soo,
Stars are out, Soo, Soo,
Moon?s about, Soo, Soo,
Cats are fighting, Soo, Soo,
Sheets are biting, Soo, Soo,
Grubs are growing, Soo, Soo,
Seeds are sowing, Soo, Soo,
I wonder why?
I wonder why?
I wonder why, Soo, Soo?
May Gibbs, Chucklebud and Wunkydoo (1924)
And hidden away in one of hundreds of May?s comic
strips is her own version of the traditional counting rhyme:
Ten Little Gumnuts, swinging on a vine,
One fell off, and then there were nine.
Nine little Gumnuts staying out too late
A Banksia man took one, then there were eight.
Eight little Gumnuts saw the Moon in Heaven
One sprang up to it, then there were seven.
Seven little Gumnuts, ill in bed with ticks
The Dr. couldn?t cure One then there were six.
Six little Gumnuts learning how to dive
A big Fish swallowed One, then there were five.
Five Little Gumnuts, heard the Bunyip roar.
The Bunyip caught One, then there were four.
Four Little Gumnuts, sitting on a tree
A Whirlwind snatched One, then there were three.
Three Little Gumnuts sailing on the Blue
One fell overboard, then there were two.
Two Little Gumnuts playing ?wag? for fun.
A Big snake came along, then there was one.
One Little Gumnut sitting in the Sun
He melted right away, then there was none.
?Oh? sobbed Bib and Bub ?lt?s sad, as sad can be?
? ?Tis but a song? cried Goanna ?Come along to tea.?
May Gibbs, The Further Adventures of Bib and Bub (1927)
This sudden proliferation of interest in Australian children?s
literature and its folkloric role established a general context for
the ongoing encouragement of Australian nursery rhymes after
the Bulletins competition. A further factor which must have
fostered an interest in nursery age literature in the early 1920s
but which has not, to date, been cited as contributing to this was
the immediate post-war concern for baby care.
On the eve of World War I there had been, increasingly, a
critical eye cast upon the infant mortality rate in Australia and
its damning comparison with New Zealand?s much better
record. Thereafter, the war itself diverted attention to adult
care and away from issues of maternity and child care.
Fdowever, when it was realised that the number of babies
under twelve months of age who had died in Australia during
the war years was almost equal to the number of soldiers lost,
there was widespread concern. 34 The nation?s greatest assets, its


infants and its young men, had been decimated and only the
latter had received the publicity of casualty lists and honour
rolls. It was time to redress this imbalance.
Politicians, medical figures, historians, journalists and
self-appointed experts were united in vocalising the threat to
Australia and re-energising jingoistic sentiments which might
otherwise have been in danger of waning after 1918. And the
answer to this racial suicide was unanimously seen to be the
education of the Australian mother. The maternal figure in the
home became the domestic exemplar of a prouder national
image of Australia?the Motherland. The war front was
relocated into the nurseries of Australia only now the enemy
was disease, lack of baby care facilities and, above all,
ignorance. The weapon was a campaign to educate mothers
into a role as nation builders. 35
The most eminent medical authority to lend support to
this thinking and program was Dr Truby King. He had visited
Sydney in December 1919 as a guest of the Royal Society and
was instrumental in promoting the idea of a Baby Health
Week, the first of which was held in Sydney in 1920.
Thereafter Baby Health Clinics and Baby Health Weeks
became a part of the Australian way of life.
This awakening interest in nursery care thus helps us to
see publishing interest in nursery rhymes as more of a
coherent part of Australian demands and interests and less as
an isolated phenomenon. Unfortunately many of these factors
were not sustained into the depressed years of the 1930s and
there was a discernible lessening of interest in indigenous
nursery rhymes in that decade.
The production of Australian nursery rhymes such as those
featured in the Bulletin prompts one to ask if any of this
made-to-order folklore was ever really assimilated into an oral
tradition. One Melbourne researcher of children?s folklore in
Australia has suggested that the only ?rime? which has
remained in circulation is ?Little Ji-ka Ji-ka? 36 and has
concluded that folklore cannot be written to order. While this
conclusion is broadly true its dismissive stance devalues the
printed word and overlooks the limited geographical range of
much oral folklore. In the days when recitation, in the home
as well as at school, was a socially endorsed attribute, many
Sydney children at least may well have used Australian Nursery
Rimes in their repertoire.
One Sydney correspondent to the Museum of Australian
Childhood vividly remembers the Bulletins nursery Times?
being read to her in the late 1920s and although the booklet
itself was later lost, these ?rimes? remained current as part of
her family?s cherished folklore:
Some of the ?rimes? have endured and are still recited
and enjoyed by small children?who have heard them
from a fourth generation. There is a bit of variation
which has crept in over the years of re-telling. 37
Further evidence is provided by the National Library of
Australia?s O?Connor Collection of Australian Folklore. 38 Here
someone who was raised in Tasmania in the 1920s still
remembers four of the ?rimes?. No doubt there are others who
experienced these ?rimes? via the actual Bulletin booklet or
later via their rare appearance in anthologies or from an oral
source.
The Bulletins booklet was only sold as a novelty in
Sydney during the 1917 Christmas season; its single printing


and ephemeral nature mitigated against any long-term
assimilation of its nursery ?rimes? into Australian family lore
on a large scale. Four of the ?rimes? resurfaced in 1932 in the
first significant anthology of Australian poetry for young
readers? Frolic Fair: A Book of Australian Verse for Children
Under Ten. None of them seem to have reappeared thereafter
until 1967 when Joyce Saxby included five in her anthology,
One Hundred Poems Chosen for Children. The booklet itself
faded from view and today is virtually forgotten. A fine copy
did, however, appear in a Sotheby?s book auction in
Melbourne in 1990 and fetched a most impressive sale price of
$1100! No doubt much of the auction interest in this item
was generated by Norman Lindsay collectors ?the booklet
contains two illustrations by Lindsay.
In its day the Bulletins competition did have a
discernible if short-lived influence on Australian versifiers and
for a few brief years there was a flurry of interest, particularly
on the Sydney scene, in composing nursery rhymes. The
competition was very likely the impetus behind a local series
of nursery rhyme shape books and it undeniably prompted
Angus & Robertson to plan a major collection of nursery
rhyme adaptations. The failure of this collection to appear was
offset by the inspiration it generated in C.J. Dennis whose A
Book for Kids (1921) was the ultimate outcome of his
involvement in this otherwise unproductive project.
In 1918 a Sydney publisher issued a series of five shape
books for children; Little 80-Peep, Mary Had a Little Lamb,
Red Riding Hood, Little Miss Muffet and Little Betty Blue.
Although their titles were taken from traditional nursery
rhymes their entire production was proudly Australian.
These are amongst the most delightful of all Australian
nursery publications and their rarity and the fact that very few
such novelties were produced is explained in a plaintive letter
from the publishing house:
We would like to point out that these booklets
represent the first attempt by an Australian Publishing
House to produce children?s cut-out Booklets ... The
Artist is an Australian, the verse is by an Australian,
the blocks were made by an Australian firm of etchers
... Owing to the high cost of labor in Australia, the
price of these booklets made it impossible to market
them ...
Until a tariff wall is erected around Australia
prohibiting the market to American and Japanese
goods of a similar character, it would be folly for any
firm to attempt to market booklets of a like nature. 39
This enterprising publisher was actually Harry Weston
who had provided some illustrations, including its cover, for
the Bulletins booklet. No doubt the unsigned illustrations in
the Baby Booklets are from his pen; the verses, unfortunately,
remain anonymous. The restrictions which were a justifiable
complaint in 1918 continued to blight the local production of
children?s book novelties and it was to be over a decade before
another series of Australian shape books were issued. 40
The most effective verse in the Baby Booklet series was
contained in Little Miss Muffet and centred on the antics of
Australian fauna:
Ring-a, Ring-a Kangaroo!
Learn to hop like your mothers do!
Over a twig held high from the ground.
Up we go! Down we go! Round and round.
Anon, Little Miss Muffet (1918)


Three lizards went down to a water-pool
At the foot of the old bush track
But a cunning fish took a tail off?swish.
And two-and-a-half went back.
Anon, Little Miss Muffet (1918)
A slight contribution to this evolving interest in culture-
specific nursery rhymes for Australian children was Albert
Bock?s pamphlet: The Alliance Choice Budget of Nursery
Rhymes, Original, Wise & Otherwise, published by the author
in Tasmania c.1920. There is very little evidence of any
original contribution to this collection of traditional nursery
rhymes apart from a variation of ?Doctor Foster Went to
Gloucester? with its relocation to the northern Tasmanian
town of Deloraine:
Doctor Kane went in the rain,
To visit a patient at Deloraine;
And on his way back he missed the track,
He stept in a puddle, a very deep mudhole
And never came back again.
Albert Bock, The Alliance Choice Budget of Nursery Rhymes
(c.1920)
One wonders if this was an original piece by Bock or
something that evolved in the nurseries of Tasmania.
The major outcome of the Bulletins competition was an
ambitious publishing proposal which involved six Australian
poets: Ruth Bedford, Leslie H. Allen, Amy Mack, Harry
Burrell, C.J. Dennis and Zora Cross. Of these, Leslie Allen
had the most recognised ability for writing verse suitable for
children: his Billy-Bubbles appeared in 1920 and was a
popular, if brief, success. Ruth Bedford had already had some
precocious verse, not children?s verse, privately printed while
still a schoolgirl. Amy Mack was well known for a series of
short nature stories for children and Harry Burrell was a
family friend of Mack and her husband, and a total
newcomer to writing. CJ. Dennis had no profile as a
children?s author while Zora Cross? only verse for children,
The City of Riddle-Me-Ree, had appeared in 1918. All of these
figures formed an association with Angus & Robertson and
all contributed a varying number of nursery rhymes to the
projected anthology with the majority being by Zora Cross
and Ruth Bedford.
In 1920 Ruth Bedford sent nursery rhymes which she
had co-authored and which had previously appeared in the
Bulletin to George Robertson of Angus & Robertson in the
hope that he would consider publishing a modest booklet. 42
From Robertson?s reply it was obvious that he had already
been considering a volume of Australian nursery rhymes, of
adaptations rather than totally original verse:
When the Bulletin Nursery Rhyme Competition was
on we determined to try a volume of the old rhymes
adapted, when circumstances permitted it. 43
Robertson?s attitude was therefore diametrically opposed
to the stance the Bulletin had taken in regard to indigenous
verse. It was this chauvinistic question concerning the
suitability of adapted nursery rhymes over original Australian
rhymes which differentiated the efforts of these versifiers.
Zora Cross was engaged to edit this volume of ?old
rhymes adapted? and worked sporadically on it over the next
four years. In expectation of an eventual release it was even
advertised in 1924 as Australian Nursery RhymesN


Unfortunately, after an initial burst of interest and activity, a
number of factors combined to slow the project down.
CJ. Dennis, surely the most prestigious contributor, disliked
Ruth Bedford?s verse and specifically criticised it for being
?acclimatized?. 45 Ultimately, Zora Cross failed to bring the
project to completion; thereby causing a rift in her
relationship with George Robertson, and also depriving
Australian children?s literature of what promised to be a
distinguished collection.
The story of this ill-fated project has never been told and
certainly warrants detailed attention. (The correspondence
and rhymes submitted to the Angus & Robertson anthology
are held in the Mitchell Library, Sydney. The rhymes
reproduced over the following pages are from this source.)
Almost all of the dozens of nursery rhymes written for
Angus & Robertson were ?acclimatized? ?they were traditional
rhymes adapted to an Australian setting. The most memorable
of these rhymes were those written by Ruth Bedford and Zora
Cross.
Ruth Bedford (1882-1963) was a poet, playwright,
journalist and children?s author whose literary talent was
manifested at a precocious age: her first booklet of verse was
published in 1893. Between 1913 and 1934 she produced
three volumes of verse for young Australians. Surprisingly,
none of her efforts in the nursery rhyme genre were included
in these works. Her friendship with Dorothea Mackellar (they
collaborated on two novels) may have prompted a similar
interest in nursery rhymes in her compatriot: Mackellar?s
volume of verse, Dreamharbour (1923), includes a section of
?Old rhymes and undertones? which pays homage to various
nursery rhyme characters and extends their narrative into
adult territory.

Ruth Bedford, ?Angus & Robertson anthology? (1920)
Zora Cross (1890-1964) was a very different figure to
Ruth Bedford and at first glance it is perhaps difficult to see
why George Robertson should have entrusted her with the
compilation of a book of nursery rhymes. After all, in its day
Zora Cross? poetry was regarded as rather forthright in its
frank and sensuous themes of love and sexuality; it was
uncompromisingly adult. The woman herself aroused strong
partisan feelings in many and George Robertson was so
affected as to compare her to Charlotte Bronte!
When Angus & Robertson?s nursery rhyme anthology was
proposed, they had already published two volumes of Cross?
adult verse and were about to issue another. They had issued a
very slight booklet, a brief verse fantasy of hers for children,
The City of Riddle-Me-Ree , in 1918 and this was her sole
contribution to children?s literature. Even so, this complex and
self-dramatising personality was able to curtail her often prolix
and undisciplined writing and produce succinct nursery verses.

The other nursery rhymes contributed to Angus &
Robertson?s project, with the exception of Leslie Allen?s verse,
were nowhere near as effective as those of Ruth Bedford and
Zora Cross:
The Snail
Snail, Snail, shoot out your horns.
You walk so slow you must have corns.
And you?d walk slow and your joints would crack
If you had to carry your house on your back.?

He called Miss Maggie ?Sticky-beak,?
Fie! but only once;
Then teacher made a cap for him,
And wrote upon it ?DUNCE.
Harry Burrell, ?Angus & Robertson anthology? (1920)
The only positive outcome of this ill-fated project was
that CJ. Dennis? contributions grew from a few short nursery
rhymes into an entire publication: his 1921 work A Book for
Kids.
CJ. Dennis was a household name in Australia during
the First World War as the country took his characters from
The Sentimental Bloke to its heart. However, this success was
not sustained and both Dennis and his publisher were
disappointed with the sales of some of his later works. It was
in this mood of some self doubt that George Robertson
attempted to involve Dennis in his projected anthology of
Australian nursery rhymes:
I did not intend asking you to contribute to
A. & R.?s Nursery Rhyme Book ... but in your
present state of mind and body I feel sure the job will
do you good. 46
Robertson?s typical concern for the wellbeing of one of
the firm?s authors prompted this gesture and yet he could
scarcely have foreseen that it would soon engage all of Dennis?
interest and zeal. One week after Robertson first suggested the
idea and sent copies of Ruth Bedford?s nursery rhymes,
Dennis was already committed:
Certainly I shall do some nursery rhymes for you. In
fact, I have finished a few already, but I shall do some
more before sending the lot. I do not care for the
sample rhymes you have sent. These are merely
parodies of well known English rhymes and say very
little for the originality of Australians. 47
Dennis, in fact, probably did not need much encouragement
to embark on a project for children. As early as 1915 he had
written to another publisher outlining some of his plans and
interests: ?I have already, almost ready, and in preparation ... A
Book of Australian Fables & Fairy Tales ... A Book of
Illustrated Nonsense Verse.? 48
It was no wonder then that Dennis responded to George
Robertson?s proposal with immediate creative zeal. Within
three months he sent Robertson the first of the promised
rhymes. Significantly, however, he was no longer prepared to
contribute to a collection but clearly preferred a separate and
individual work ?a work that was to become A Book for Kids-.


By this mail I am sending you a few Australian nursery
rhymes ... I promised them, for your collection, but if
A. & R. will favourably consider a book of kid rhymes
by C.J. Dennis, I should like them kept for that. 49
Robertson?s enthusiasm for this new proposal was
immediate and sustained and Dennis devoted much of 1921 to
his so-called ?kid rhymes?. He did, however, stress that they were
not all nursery rhymes and that their intended audience was
wider than originally conceived: ?Something for kids of all ages.? 50
Although this was Dennis? first, and only, book for
children it was not the first time that he had used a nursery
rhyme format. He had appropriated the incisive brevity and lilt
of such rhymes to good effect in his satirical verse for adults on
more than one occasion in the past. As early as 1907 he had
composed political jibes based on ?Mary Had a Little Lamb?
and ?Cock Robin?. 51 Dennis? renewed interest in nursery
rhymes following Robertson?s commission over a decade later
also produced further parodies for an adult audience: 52
Ding, dong, bell!
Truth is in a well.
Can politicians fish her out?
?Tis very hard to tell.
C.J. Dennis, ?Nursery rhymes (for political babes)?, Herald
(4 December 1922)
Hi, diddle, diddle! The Federal riddle!
Elections will be here soon;
And I neither know nor care how they go
Any more than the man in the moon.
C.J. Dennis, ?Nursery rhymes (for political babes)', Herald
(4 December 1922)
Dennis? parody of traditional nursery rhymes for satirical
purposes should not be thought of as contradicting his
professed aversion to ?acclimatized? rhymes. He obviously felt
that the parodic use of nursery rhymes for an adult audience
was justified while at the same time Australian children
deserved their own nursery rhymes.
The characteristics of children?s play?humour, vulgarity,
wordplay and the interweaving of reality and fantasy?are also
the characteristics of the successful nursery rhyme and serve to
remind us that such rhymes are frequently accompanied by
actions, mime and other playtime activities. Dennis? verses are
ideally suited to this play mode; they are robust and boisterous
entertainment. Indeed, the opening line of each verse in
?Cuppacumalonga? reads like a playground taunt:
Cuppacumalonga
?Rover, rover, cattle-drover, where go you to-day??
I go to Cuppacumalonga, fifty miles away;
Over plains where Summer rains have sung a song of glee,
Over hills where laughing rills go seeking for the sea,
I go to Cuppacumalonga, to my brother Bill.
Then come along, ah, come along!
Ah, come to Cuppacumalonga!
Come to Cuppacumalonga Hill!
?Rover, rover, cattle-drover, how do you get there??
For twenty miles I amble on upon my pony mare,
Then walk awhile and talk awhile to country men I know,
Then up to ride a mile beside a team that travels slow,
And last to Cuppacumalonga, riding with a will.
Then come along, ah, come along!
Ah, come to Cuppacumalonga!
Come to Cuppacumalonga Hill!


? ?? ? n
?Rover, rover, cattle-drover, what do you do then??
I camp beneath a kurrajong with three good cattle-men;
Then off away at break of day, with strong hands on the
reins,
To laugh and sing while mustering the cattle on the
plains?
For up at Cuppacumalonga life is jolly still.
Then come along, ah, come along!
Ah, come to Cuppacumalonga!
Come to Cuppacumalonga Hill!
Rover, rover, cattle-drover, how may I go too??
I?ll saddle up my creamy colt and he shall carry you ?
My creamy colt who will not bolt, who does not shy nor
kick ?
We?ll pack the load and take the road and travel very quick.
And if the day brings work or play we ll meet it with a will.
So Hi for Cuppacumalonga!
Come along, ah, come along!
Ah, come to Cuppacumalonga Hill!
C.J. Dennis, A Book for Kids (1921)
Equally effective is Dennis? ability to weave a carefully
balanced strand of reality and fantasy into a beguiling pattern.
Niceties of discrimination play no part in the nursery rhyme;
reality and fantasy are intermingled and their territory has no
clear demarcation. Dennis obviously appreciated this as well as
the value of wordplay. Invariably he chooses words for their
onomatopoeic effect, bizarre sound and rhyming potential.
In his mastery of the incantatory line Dennis could be
considered Australia?s answer to Edward Lear. This is most
apparent when he takes an unusual Australian place name and
centres it in nonsense verse that appropriates something akin to
the drive and confident momentum of Lear?s limericks. And
although Dennis? rhymes are assertively culture specific, such
real-life Australian towns as Burrumbeet, Ballarat, Gundagai,
Oodnadatta and Booboorowie {sic) have a euphony that gives
them universal appeal. Dennis even went so far as to insert
such comic inventions as Beetaloo and Cuppacumalonga into
his list of actual towns! His use of Australian place names is
such that a total inversion of reality occurs. These place names
become of most significance for their comical sound and
bizarre word colour: they become, in fact, nonsense words as in
this ?ridiculous riddle? and its companions:
Woolloomooloo
Here?s a ridiculous riddle for you:
How many o?s are in Woolloomooloo?
Two for the W, two for the m,
Four for the l?s, and that?s plenty for them.
C.J. Dennis, A Book for Kids (1921)

C3xx,
The Traveller
As I rode in to Burrumbeet,
I met a man with funny feet;
And, when I paused to ask him why
His feet were strange, he rolled his eye
And said the rain would spoil the wheat;
So I rode on to Burrumbeet.
As I rode in to Beetaloo,
I met a man whose nose was blue;
And, when I asked him how he got
A nose like that, he answered, ?What
Do bullocks mean when they say ?Moo???
So I rode on to Beetaloo.
As I rode in to Ballarat,
I met a man who wore no hat;
And, when I said he might take cold,
He cried, ?The hills are quite as old
As yonder plains, but not so flat.?
So I rode on to Ballarat.
As I rode in to Gundagai,
I met a man and passed him by
Without a nod, without a word.
He turned, and said he?d never heard
Or seen a man so wise as I.
But I rode on to Gundagai.
As I rode homeward, full of doubt,
I met a stranger riding out:
A foolish man he seemed to me;
But, ?Nay, I am yourself,? said he,
?Just as you were when you rode out.?
So I rode homeward, free of doubt.
C.J. Dennis, A Book for Kids (1921)
A Change of Air
Now, a man in Oodnadatta
He grew fat, and he grew fatter,
Though he hardly had a thing to eat for dinner;
While a man in Booboorowie
Often sat and wondered how he
Could prevent himself from growing any thinner.
So the man from Oodnadatta
He came down to Booboorowie,


Where he rapidly grew flatter;
And the folk will tell you how he
Urged the man in Booboorowie
To go up to Oodnadatta?
Where he lived awhile, and now he
Is considerably fatter.
C.J. Dennis, A Book for Kids (1921)
Riding Song
Flippiry-flop! Flippity-flop!
Here comes the butcher to bring us a chop,
Cantering, cantering down the wide street
On his little bay mare with the funny white feet;
Cantering, cantering out to the farm,
Stripes on his apron and basket on arm.
Run to the window and tell him to stop ?
Flippity-flop! Flippity-flop!
C.J. Dennis, A Book for Kids (1921)
Growing Up
Little Tommy Tadpole began to weep and wail,
For little Tommy Tadpole had lost his little tail.
And his mother didn?t know him, as he wept upon a log;
For he wasn?t Tommy Tadpole, but Mr. Thomas Frog.

The Funny Hatter
Harry was a funny man, Harry was a hatter;
He ate his lunch at breakfast time and said it didn?t matter.
He made a pot of melon jam and put it on a shelf,
For he was fond of sugar things and living by himself.
He built a fire of bracken and a blue-gum log.
And he sat all night beside it with his big-black-dog.

The Unsociable Wallaby
Willie spied a wallaby hopping through the fern ?

The Drovers
Out across the spinifex, out across the sand,
Out across the saltbush to Never land,
That?s the way the drovers go, jogging down the track ?
That?s the way the drovers go. But how do they come back?
Back across the saltbush from Never Never land,
Back across the spinifex, back across the sand.

The Feast
Cackle and lay, cackle and lay!
How many eggs did you get to-day?
Two in the manger and four in the shed,
Six in the box where the chickens are fed,
Two in the tussocks and ten in the tub,
And nearly two dozen right out in the scrub.
Hip, hooray! Pudding to-day!
I think the hens are beginning to lay.
C.J. Dennis, A Book for Kids (1921)
The Famine
Cackle and lay, cackle and lay!
How many eggs did you get to-day,
None in the manger, and none in the shed,
None in the box where the chickens are fed,
None in the tussocks and none in the tub,
And only a little one out in the scrub.
Oh, I say! Dumplings to-day.
I fear that the hens must be laying away.
C.J. Dennis, A Book for Kids (1921).
An interesting development during the 1920s was the
increasingly effective use of nursery rhymes in advertising
campaigns. In Three Centuries of Nursery Rhymes and Poetry
for Children (2nd edn, 1977), the Opies devote one complete
section to ?Nursery rhymes in advertising? and list nursery
publications and novelties from 1860 to 1971 which were
issued to enhance the image, or at least the sales, of various
products.
In Australia such attempts included the elaborate
promotional Christmas ventures staged by Farmer?s Store
(Sydney) to advance itself as ?the Children?s Store?: in
December 1919, for example, the store staged a series of
nursery rhyme tableaux complete with a souvenir booklet of
traditional nursery rhymes. More typical was the publication
of a collection of nursery rhymes adapted to incorporate
validating references to specific nursery-oriented products like
baby food, soap, toys and children?s clothes. As early as 1903
the Willsmere Certified Milk Company (Melbourne) had
issued a series of twelve postcards with nursery rhyme
adaptations to promote their product. In 1919 two Australian
companies published acclimatised nursery rhymes in their
promotional campaign for Glaxo powdered milk and Sun-
Raysed dried fruit:
Pussy cat, Pussy cat, where have you been?
I?ve been out looking for milk sweet and clean.
Pussy cat, Pussy cat, how did you dare?
Didn?t I say there?s no GLAXO to spare?
I?m just as sorry as sorry can be:
It?s all meant for Baby and Mother and me.
Anon, Glaxo Nursery-Rhymes (1919)
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard,
The Milk had gone sour in the night.
She did get a scare! But some GLAXO was there
So her baby had breakfast all right.

1920s Nursery Versery
'As I was going ... from Bourke to Gundagai'
CJ. Dennis? A Book for Kids , either whole or
in part, in selections from Dennis? total
output or as individual poems in anthologies,
has remained current in Australian nurseries
since its first publication in 1921 and it is
rightly regarded as a classic Australian
children?s book. Its success provided ongoing
encouragement and example to some
Australian children?s poets in the move away
from the overly sentimental and fantasy-
oriented subjects which had dominated our
children?s verse and into more robust
territory. While A.A. Milne at much the same
time on the English scene was capturing its
nursery life and pastimes, Dennis was
depicting the spirit of the less cossetted and
constrained Australian child.
Dennis' reputation and achievement, however, eclipsed a
significant volume of children's verse published only the year
before A Book for Kids appeared. The poetic potential in
young Australia's pastimes and viewpoints as captured in brief
verses untrammelled by patriotic sentiments, moral
restrictions or the overseeing eye of a
patronising adult was first realised in Leslie
Allen?s Billy-Bubbles. Allen?s work was a
modestly produced booklet, unillustrated
and even somewhat austere in its
presentation, while Dennis? work was a
much more imposing large quarto. Much of
the visual appeal of A Book for Kids was
generated by its colour cover which, together
with the textual illustrations, were by
Dennis himself.
The cover was unprecedented on the
Australian children?s book scene in terms of
its bold, even crude and eye-catching
graphic. The most popular illustrations in
Australian children?s books at this time were
delicate and refined fantasy works such as
had been popularised by Ida Rentoul Outhwaite. Dennis'
alarming, impish, wide-eyed figure makes immediate contact
with the viewer; there are no concessions here to adult
conceptions of sentimental child beauty! The result is a naive
graphic of great strength which heralds the type of verse


within: vernacular, robust and direct. Faced with all this it is
no wonder that Leslie Allen?s Billy-Bubbles was largely
overshadowed and has been forgotten today.
When Allen?s book was at the printers, George Robertson
invited him to contribute nursery rhymes to the Angus &
Robertson anthology and some of these contributions
appeared later in a second edition of Billy-Bubbles published in
1924. Allen dealt with nursery life and humour, with innocent
pastimes and the self-centred imaginative territory of the
young and it is a pity that he never produced another volume
of children?s verse. Even so, in its day it must have surprised
many that an erudite scholar like Allen could produce even
this one volume of simple and unpatronising verse for an
audience which was absolutely at the opposite end of the scale
from his usual one.
Leslie Holdsworth Allen (1879-1964) would, in fact,
have been a more likely choice than Zora Cross as the compiler
of Angus & Robertson?s anthology of rhymes. They had
published his first volume of classical poems and prose in 1913
and he was widely respected and known as a figure of diverse
cultural interests. He was a noted classical scholar and lecturer
with a Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig, and when the
nursery rhyme anthology was first mooted he had just taken up
a post as Professor of English at the Royal Military College,
Duntroon, Canberra; a post which he was to hold until 1930.
Here his relatively undemanding academic duties allowed him
to indulge his multifarious interests in Australian art, the
theatre, translation, literary criticism and writing poetry.
The format of Allen?s Billy-Bubbles is restrained, more
befitting a volume, of classical translations from its scholarly
author. The verse itself, however, belies this restraint and is
exuberant, entertaining and aimed directly at a young
audience with no hint of condescension, or of an overseeing
adult with one eye to a more mature audience. Much of the
verse, in fact, reveals a true poet?s keen eye for the style and
metre of the nursery rhyme:
Teddy Bear
Teddy Bear
Sat on a chair,
With ham and jam
And plum and pear.
?This is queer,?
Said Teddy Bear,
?The more I eat
The less is there!?
Leslie H. Allen, Billy-Bubbles (1920)
Puff-tail Peter

And pops it down,

You haven?t been once,

Leslie H. Allen, Billy-Bubbles {1920)
The counting rhyme, ?Thistledown?, is a variation of a
classic nursery rhyme and like much of the book?s other verse
encourages recitation with its forthright rhymes, its effective
repetition and its unfailing sense of rhythm;
Thistledown
Thistledown, Thistledown,
One, two, three!
What shall I wish for?
What shall it be?
?l?ll have a dolly!?
?A drum for me!?
Thisdedown, Thistledown,
One, two, three!
Thistledown, Thistledown,
Four, five, six!
All shut your eyes tight
While each one picks!
?Mine is a trumpet!?
?Mine lolly-sticks!?
Thistledown, Thistledown,
Four, five, six!
Leslie H. Allen, Billy-Bubbles (1920)
In 1923 Allen wrote to George Robertson concerning the
fate of the nursery rhymes he had submitted to Angus &
Robertson?s projected anthology:
I wish you?d let me have back those nursery rhymes. I
have no copy, & I want to include some of them in a
new edition of Billy-BubblesP
The most memorable of these verses was ?The Locust?;
I had a little locust no bigger than my thumb.
I put him in a match-box, and there I bade him drum.
I opened up the match-box, to see if he was there?
?Buzzi? went the locust, and flew into the air.
Leslie H. Allen, Billy-Bubbles (2nd edn, 1924)
In the enlarged second edition of 1924, Allen continued
C.J. Dennis? effective use of Australian place names with the
same touch of the nonsensical in his verse ?Penrith?:
As I was going to Penrith
I met two Chinamen with


A great big gun
And a hot cross bun
To catch a speckled hen with.
Leslie H. Allen, Billy-Bubbles (2nd edn, 1924)
The publishing opportunities for poets writing children?s
verse have always been limited and perhaps Angus &
Robertson?s nursery rhyme anthology was not the only
project in this line to be abandoned. Furthermore, we
would be mistaken if we judged publication in book form as
the sole forum for the popularisation of children?s verse.
Special ?Children?s Pages? or ?Columns?, sometimes part of a
?Women?s Page?, have been a popular part of many
Australian newspapers since late last century. The
inspiration which editors of such pages ?like Ethel Turner
in The Australian Town and Country Journal, Mary Gilmore
in The Australian Worker and Amy Mack in the Sydney
Morning Herald ?brought to the task, gave encouragement
to many writers of verse for children as well as to child poets
themselves. Three newspapers which, in the early twentieth
century, consistently featured verse by significant poets were
the Sydney Morning Herald, the (Melbourne) Leader and the
(Melbourne) Herald. It was usually a page in the Saturday
issue of these newspapers which featured such work; the
most notable, perhaps, being C.J. Dennis? page in the
Herald of the 1920s which featured verse for adulr and child
alike.
Almost all of this ephemeral writing is an untapped mine
of verse for young Australians; the laborious page turning
involved in unearthing these items is a daunting task.
However, when we consider that in the 1920s in the Sydney
Morning Herald alone such successful authors of verse for
children as Alan Mickle, Edyth Bavin, Launcelot Harrison,
Ruth Bedford and Leslie H. Allen were contributors, then the
significance of this ephemeral writing becomes clear. Precious
little of this output has been collected and an anthology of
such verse would greatly augment the canon of one genre of
Australian children?s literature. One of the very few exceptions
to this lacunae is verse by E.T Luke: his contributions to the
Leader were published as a booklet in 1921 as Australian
Nature Studies and Nursery Rhymes.
Clippety, clopperty, clippety clop;
Gallop away till you come to a stop.
Off again cantering quietly along?
Hoofs beating time to the words of your song.
E.T. Luke, Australian Nature Studies and Nursery Rhymes (1921)
Little Danny Dun,
Was a Mallee farmer?s son,
And loved to chase the lambs about for fun, fun, fun.

Butted Danny right away,
And from the grassy paddock made him run, run, run.

Hold it with your tiny thumb.
Eat it slow as slow can be
Till the stone is all you see
Twixt your finger and your thumb?

Baby, Baby in the hay?
Got his Daddy?s cap to-day.
Baby?s proud as proud can be ?
What a big brave man is he.

The Laughing Jackass
?Laughing Jack, Laughing Jack, Tell me, I pray,
How to be happy, like you every day.?
?How to be happy like me ev?ry day?
Laugh at your troubles, and they?ll fly away.?
E.T. Luke, Australian Nature Studies and Nursery Rhymes (1921)
Dennis? influence was also apparent in an engaging
booklet published in 1922 entitled Kangaroo Rhymes. Its
author, Stephen Grey, drew on the same educational demand
and nationalistic zeal which had produced Jimmie Pannikin?s
Thoughts for Teachers in 1914. To that end, Kangaroo Rhymes
contained a Foreword by the Director of Education in
Victoria which provided a succinct summation of the
contemporary interest in indigenous children?s folklore and
nursery rhymes;
The great nursery rhymes are folk-songs, born in the
popular mouth and owing very little to conscious art ...
Every nation has its songs, its verses, its tales dedicated
to childhood and adolescence. Australia is slowly
working out her salvation in this direction, but she is
too young as yet to have much individuality. Her
children still speak of the old world as Home, and
learn the nursery rhymes of their mothers. With years
will come tradition and a folklore to be the parent of a
new world of wonder for our little people. Meanwhile
local writers and artists are seeking to bridge the gap
by creating for the children literature of a distinctively
Australian flavor. 54
The most successful nursery verses in Kangaroo Rhymes are
two which build on traditional formulas. ?The Three Swagmen?
uses the opening gambit ?As 1 was going ...? which has inspired
almost a dozen classic nursery rhymes including As I Was
Going to St. Ives?. Another of Grey?s nursery verses, ?How
Many Miles??, instantly recalls ?How Many Miles to Babylon??
However, what makes these two new rhymes so noteworthy is
that, like CJ. Dennis, the author used actual Australian place
names such as Lilydale, Bourke and Gundagai to extend the
frontiers of nursery rhyme into Australian territory:
How Many Miles?
?How many miles to Lilydale?
O, wise old walking man;
With your brown, brown face and tired eyes,
And your stick and billy-can.?
?How many miles to Lilydale?
?Tis many miles away;


Too many miles for little feet
To travel in one day.?
?How many miles to Anywhere?
O, tell me, if you can.?
?The road is long and the hills are far,?
Said the wise old walking man.
?Take me away to Anywhere,
O, wise old walking man.?
But he shook his head as he walked away,
With his stick and his billy-can.
Stephen Grey, Kangaroo Rhymes (1922)
The Three Swagmen
As I was going down the road from Bourke to
Gundagai, Sir,
I met three swagmen by the way who each had but
one eye, Sir;
Two were dressed in dungarees, and one was clad in
moleskins,
None of them had shaved or washed, and none of
them had whole skins.
When I said, ?Pray tell me why you are so very
youthless,?
Each man opened wide his mouth and it was black
and toothless;
None of them could speak a word, and none of them
could hear me,
So I went away again and nobody came near me.
Stephen Grey, Kangaroo Rhymes (1922)
Leslie Allen was not the only prominent professor in the
1920s to find a respite from university duties through the
composition of verse popular with a nursery audience.
Professor Launcelot Harrison (1880-1928) had a most
distinguished academic career with a worldwide reputation
culminating in his role as Challis Professor of Zoology at the
University of Sydney in 1922. His wife, the children?s author
Amy Mack, had contributed some verses to the Angus &
Robertson anthology and this may have been a catalyst to
Harrison?s own efforts published in 1925 as Tails and
Tarradiddles. Certainly some of his more memorable brief
verses are admissible as nursery rhymes:
The Wallaby and the Bull-ant
The Wallaby sat on an ironbark stump,
Budgeree, Bndgeree, Bingy ?
Wondering how far he was able to jump,
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy.


The Bull-ant sat on the Wallaby?s tail,
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy ?
And the Wallaby started off full sail,
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy.
The Bull-ant?s face wore a satisfied smile,
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy ?
For the Wallaby found he could jump a mile,
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy.
The Perfesser & Alter Ego [Launcelot Harrison], Tails and
Tarradiddles (1925)
The Fantail
Flit-a-
Flirt-a-
Fantail?
Flutter down the creek;
Once his tail
Is open,
Can?t shut it for a week;
All he has
To sing about,
Just a little squeak;
All he has
For supper, just
A squito in his beak;
Flit-a-
Flirt-a-
Fantail?
Flutter down the creek.
The Perfesser & Alter Ego [Launcelot Harrison], Tails and
Tarradiddles (1925)
Possum up a Gum-tree
Possum up a gum-tree, look down at me;
Possum up a gum-tree, what do you see?
For your babies, bread of my baking;
For your lady, gown of my making;
For yourself, a shoe and a sock;
1 have them all in the lap of my frock.
Possum up a gum-tree, come down to me;
A little girl is nicer than an old gum-tree.
The Perfesser & Alter Ego [Launcelot Harrison], Tails and
Tarradiddles (1925)
Another item in this intermittent series of nursery
publications appeared in the mid 19205: Cole?s Happy Time
Picture and Nursery Rhyme Book. Today?s audience could be
excused for thinking that the Cole of the title was merely a
tribute to Old King Cole of traditional nursery rhyme fame.
However, E.W. Cole (1832-1918) was Australia?s best-known
bookseller last century and the compiler of the first classic
Australian children?s book, Coles Funny Picture Book (1879).
Most of Cole?s publications were cutting-book type
accumulations of verse, snippets of prose, short stories and
illustrations culled from a very wide range of unacknowledged
sources. However, Cole?s Happy Time Picture and Nursery
Rhyme Book was a significant deviation from this style. This
was no mere compendium of copyright free nursery verse and
illustrations: it is one of the very rare instances in which the
services of both an Australian author and illustrator were
commissioned to produce an entirely original new work.
Lillian Pyke wrote forty-five nursery verses and an alphabet,
and Percy Leason contributed eight full-page colour plates and
thirty-two black and white line drawings.


Lillian Pyke (c. 1881-1927) was more popularly known
as a children?s novelist rather than a children?s poet and for a
decade from 1916 until her death enjoyed popular success as a
writer of school stories. Percy Leason (1889?1959) had
contributed two illustrations to the Bulletin s Australian
Nursery Rimes of 1917, but is primarily remembered today for
his humorous and satiric series of large black and white
cartoons which graced the Sydney magazine Table Talk
between 1926 and 1937 and chronicled the small town life of
?Wiregrass?. Leason left for America in 1939 to pursue a more
?serious? art career.
Some of Pyke?s verses were extensions or variations of
traditional nursery rhymes. While none of these rhymes are as
defiantly Australian as earlier examples by Ruth Bedford, a
number are still effective pieces of verse:
Hot Pies
Little Jack Horner sat in a corner,
Eating his Christmas pie,
But Johnny forgot that mince pies are hot,
(You wouldn?t, dear, nor would I),
And so the big plum, burnt poor Johnny?s thumb,
And made him loudly yell.
But mother so kind, some oiled rag did find,
And now his poor burnt thumb is well.
Lillian Pyke, Cole?s Happy Time Picture and Nursery Rhyme
Book(c. 1925)
Billy Tea
Polly put the billy on,
Polly put the billy on,
Polly put the billy on,
And let?s have tea.
For this is our picnic day,
Far from town we?ve come away,
On the sand to shout and play,
Let?s have tea.
With little sticks build up the fire
That will make the flame rise higher,
Of blowing it we never tire.
See it boils.
Bring the little bag of tea,
Just enough for you and me,
Oh, how thirsty does the sea,
Make us feel.
Pass the baskets all around,
Cakes and scones within are found,
And of lollies quite a pound.
Oh, what joy!
Soon our little feast is o?er,
We can eat and drink no more,
Come let?s down on to the shore,
Jump and run.
Polly take the billy off,
Polly take the billy off,
Polly take the billy off,
They?ve all gone away.
Lillian Pyke, Cole?s Happy Time Picture and Nursery Rhyme
Book (c. 1925)
It was also during the 1920s that a considerable
repertoire of Australian nursery songs began to accumulate.
One such item stands pre-eminent in this repertoire?Marion
Sinclair?s ?Kookaburra?:


Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree,
Merry, merry king of the bush is he.
Laugh, kookaburra, laugh, kookaburra
Gay your life must be.
This is certainly the best-known round song ever taught
in Australian schools and so widespread is its popularity that
it has achieved one characteristic of folklore: some reprintings
credit it to anonymous or traditional sources! As such, the
Australian Government?s report on folklife in Australia
quoted it as a specific example of dislocation of authorial
rights by ?the natural process of selection and adaptation
whereby folklife evolves within the community?. 55 The song?s
popularity has even breached national boundaries: a recent
edition presented it as ?an Australian folk song that has been
part of camp and conference experience for many American
young people?. 56 It is thus possible to assert that ?Kookaburra?
is the premier example of an indigenous Australian nursery
rhyme.
One collection of nursery songs typical of the 1920s is
Gum-Trees (1925) which exhibits all the period charm of the
decade both in its layout as well as in the quality of its words
and music. These
seven Australian songs
were a collaborative effort, with words by Jane de Burgh
and music by Mirrie Solomon (later Mirrie Hill). The
layout of the work was greatly enhanced by illustrations
which make this one of the most appealing nursery items of
the decade.
Little Brother Possum
Little brother ?possum
Ventures out at night,
Nibbles at the gum-leaves,

Nursery Rhymes for a Depressed Australia
?I want to be like Captain Cook?
In the lead up to the Depression of the
1930s an interest in promoting Australian
nursery rhymes, or even children?s literature
in general, was understandably distracted
by the stern economic realities and
deprivations of the time:
Goosey, Goosey, Taxpayer,
When will you ponder
On the sin of taxing work
For Parliament to squander.
Anon, Nursery Rhymes for the
Unemployed (193-)
Ruth Bedford, who had actually been
responsible for energising Angus &
Robertson?s nursery rhyme project,
contributed two last nursery rhymes to a
children?s magazine in 1924 and then
retired from the field. One of these reads:
Wallaby, Wallaby, run, run, run!
Out in the paddocks and under the sun;
Over the fences and down to the creek!
Don?t you stop running till Saturday week!
Wallaby, Wallaby, stop, stop, stop!
I want to watch you and see how you
hop.
Stay with me, play with me under the
gums,
And don?t run away until Christmas
comes!
Ruth Bedford, ?Nursery rhymes?,
Junior Australians (January 1924)
Angus & Robertson?s burst of
publishing activity in children?s literature
which started with May Gibbs? booklets in
1916 slowed down considerably after
1925. During this decade they established
a new imprint?the Cornstalk Publishing
Company?primarily for modest and
usually abridged reprints such as the
Gumnut Readers series of 1929. They
published only two new Gibbs titles
between 1926 and 1930, and these both
appeared under the Cornstalk imprint. No other new and
significant children's titles were issued by Angus & Robertson
during these years and this decline of interest effectively


brought to a close a classic period of writing and illustrating
for Australian children.
The depressed thirties were hardly conducive to
encouraging the publication of children?s verse. Indeed, one of
the most telling uses of the nursery rhyme format at this time
was for an adult audience. The Henry George League which
had originated in England and had an active offshoot in
Melbourne, was campaigning for social justice and political
economy. The League?s platform of democratic government
through proportional representation was popularised in a
booklet with the unambiguous title, Nursery Rhymes for the
Unemployed. Here they appropriated traditional nursery rhyme
characters and formats to further their criticism of the
government and champion the workers? cause:
Jack and Jill
Jack and Jill went up the Hill
To sink a well for Water.
We Tax their Rope,
We Tax their Tools,
I do not think we ought to.
Anon, Nursery Rhymes for the Unemployed (193-)
Litde Boy Blue
Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn,
There are thieves in the meadows and thieves in the corn.
These are politicians who cannot sleep
Till they?ve put a tax on all that we eat.
So waken up and have a try
To put honest men in the Ministry.
Anon, Nursery Rhymes for the Unemployed (193-)
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
Twinkle, twinkle, unjust tax
Placed upon the workers? backs.
Up above their reach so high ?
Keeps them scratching till they die.
And the landlord in the park
Thanks you for your good fat spark,
For to work he?d have to go
If you did not twinkle so.

The only significant addition to the nursery rhyme genre
during the 1930s was that made by D.H. Sourer in his Bush
Babs of 1933. David Henry Sourer (1862-1935) is today
remembered solely for his sophisticated Bulletin cartoons
which often featured his trademark of the slinking, sinuous
cat. In his day, however, Sourer was a creative personality of
diverse talents: playwright, novelist, journalist, illustrator and
cartoonist. An even less known achievement is his
contribution to Australian nursery rhyme lore.
Sourer was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and seems to
have been a self-taught artist and journalist. He arrived in
Sydney in 1887, a few years after the Bulletin was first
published. This was the newspaper with which Sourer was to
become intimately associated and which was to popularise his


name throughout Australia. He quickly assimilated into the
cultural and social life of Sydney and began turning out a
welter of chic and amusing pen and ink cartoons and
decorative illustrations: magazines and newspapers, textbooks,
children?s books and postcards all benefited from Souter?s
stylish pen.
And if Souter?s metier was small and ephemeral, his
reputation in his day was considerable and he was one whose
talent and contribution to black and white art in Australia
has been somewhat overshadowed by Norman Lindsay.
Souter?s artistic contributions to the Bulletin alone could
have numbered several thousand and this coherent, if
scattered, body of work is itself sufficient to cause a re-
evaluation of his place in our art history. It is time that this
imbalance was redressed to allow David Henry Souter to
emerge as one of the finest pen and ink artists in Australia?s
history.
What is at least recognised is Souter?s place in the
history of children?s book publishing and illustrating. The
production of children?s books in Australia is almost
exclusively a twentieth-century phenomenon and two of its
most outstanding turn-of-the-century examples were both
illustrated by Souter: Bubbles, His Book (1899) and Ethel
Turner?s Gum Leaves (1900). In the latter work, Turner?s
verbal ingenuity and wordplay inspired Souter to produce
some of his most amusing and light-hearted illustrations. It
is regrettable that the two were not involved in other major
projects in which their talents could have been combined
again in such a complementary manner.
Souter himself was most adept at wordplay and wielded
as felicitous a pen with language as he did with the drawn
line. The succinct and witty captions he wrote to his
numerous Bulletin cartoons for almost fifty years were
another side of the talent which used incantatory cadences
and clever rhymes for a young audience. In 1917 he was the
only contributor to have more than one ?rime? printed in the
Bulletin s competition booklet. A decade later he
consolidated that distinction by writing and illustrating a
number of entertaining new rhymes for the children?s
magazine Young Australia. Each of these new verses was
produced in a distinctive calligraphic script and set within a
decorative ink drawing of immediate appeal. Souter?s earlier
verse had stood out for its humour, inventiveness and
catching rhythms and in 1928 and 1929 he showed that he
had lost nothing of his skill.
Clippity, clippity, clippity-clop;
Round by the stock-route the creek and the crop.
Gallopping horses and gallopping dogs,
Dodging the rabbit-holes, jumping the logs.
When they get tired the horses will stop,
Then, we?ll come home again, Clippity-clop.

In 1932 one of the most significant anthologies of
Australian children?s verse was published: Frolic Fair was
specifically addressed to children under ten and even today,
sixty years later, it remains as a sensitive gleaning of some of
the best verse for young Australians. Of particular note is that
for the first time in fifteen years four of the Bulletins
Australian nursery ?rimes? were back in print and thus
available to a new generation. One of these was Souter?s ?The
Man from Menindie? and this renewed interest was almost
certainly the catalyst which prompted Souter to collect,
rewrite and extend his repertoire of nursery rhymes into his
very last book: Bush Babs (1933).
As befitting the most important nursery rhyme collection
of the decade, Souter?s book was presented in a striking and
innovative cover, the like of which had not been seen since
C.J. Dennis? A Book for Kids of 1921! Bush Babs remains
Souter?s most accessible body of writing for children and while
much children?s literature from this period may seem dated
and unnecessarily cute, Souter?s nursery rhymes retain their
robust nature and humour and are well suited to active
recitation.
And the ?Roo Jumped Over the Moon
THE KANGAROO is a splendid jumper;
Short forelegs, but its tail is a thumper.

For baby to lie in, sucking its thumb.
Of all the babes that are born, but few
Have a pram like the baby kangaroo.

So why shouldn?t you
Have Kangaroo Cats
Or a Katgaroo??

Bush Babs consolidated Souter?s long-term interest in
the composition of Australian nursery rhymes: between 1917


and 1933 the fascination of the nursery rhyme genre
maintained its hold and he added gradually to his repertoire.
This body of verse makes Souter one of the most prolific and
capable of our nursery poets. His
dual ability with text and
illustration established a mastery
which none have equalled. The
only other really stylish nursery
item of the decade, indeed the
only other really stylish Australian
children?s book of the decade, was
a hand-crafted ABC: An Alphabet,
Being a Book of Designs & Rhymes
(1932).
This rather pedestrian title
belies a book of great charm and
graphic variety. Twenty-six students
in the Applied Art School of the
Melbourne Working Men?s College
took one letter of the alphabet
each, wrote a simple rhyme and
accompanied it with a linocut
illustration. The guiding genius
behind this alphabet was Napier Waller, newly-appointed
senior art teacher at the College. Waller had taken up this post
in February 1932 and was a highly-respected printmaker,
mosaic and mural artist, and stained-glass window designer.
His indefatigable example was obviously an inspiration to his
new students and their alphabet is a remarkable tribute to his
wit and energy.
If it were not for Souter?s sustained literary interest the
Australian nursery of the 1930s would have relied almost
entirely on imported rhymes. Very few other Australian poets
of the decade addressed a nursery age audience and we have to
be particularly diligent to unearth their contributions.
New Children
All new children come at night,
Ushered in by candle light;
If the night has just begun
It will surely be a son:
But the time that girls are born
Is just before the early morn.

Oh Sir, Oh Sir,
You are a lovely man.
Wake up, black sheep,
Hey! it?s time for school;
Oh dear, oh dear,
My eyes are full of wool.
Brian Vrepont, Oh Marjorie Ann (1936)

Rhymes for the Times
?Twinkle, twinkle, Southern Cross?
By the end of the 1930s there were few heirs to the poets of
earlier decades who had written significant verse for Australian
children. Of those poets who had a volume of such verse to
their credit by the late 19305, only Ruth Bedford, Annie
Rentoul and Mary Gilmore managed to repeat the
achievement: C.J. Dennis, Leslie H. Allen, Furnley Maurice,
Launcelot Harrison, Ethel Turner, Kama Birmingham, Zora
Cross, Alan Mickle and D.H. Sourer are only known by a
single volume of children?s verse each. Our two most
outstanding figures from this period, D.H. Souter and
C.J. Dennis, both died in the 1930s and a new generation of
Australian poets producing a significant and sustained output
of verse for children did not appear until the 19605.
World War II was nothing like the imaginative catalyst
which its predecessor had been in terms of the production of
Australian children?s literature. If the gumnut babies and their
allies battling the banksia men in 1918 were a microcosmic
rendition of another more global conflict, there was no such
equivalent in Australian children?s literature in the 19405.
Furthermore, with one obvious exception, there was not a
significant children?s illustrated book produced during these
war years in Australia at all. And even in its day this exception,
Elizabeth Durack?s Way of the Whirlwind (1941), was itself
something of an anachronism; its folio size with bejewelled,
tipped-in colour plates offset by generous borders harks back
to the earlier years of the century and contains no hint of
wartime austerity or sentiment.
However, what did proliferate during these years of paper
rationing and restrictions were more ephemeral children?s
publications printed at low cost, in large numbers and
marketed more as stationery lines than standard bookselling
items. When printers and stationers entered the publishing
arena the quality of Australian children?s book production
(except in the hands of John Sands) reached its lowest point.
Traditional nursery literature, tales and rhymes were
particularly chosen as texts by these inexperienced new
entrepreneurs: they were familiar imaginative territory to all
and involved no new commissioning of texts, they were
copyright free and they faced little if any competition from
foreign printings.
Very little local nursery verse was produced for wartime
Australian children. As a copyright-free vehicle for displaying
the talents of a second generation of Australian fantasy
illustrators, these booklets inundated Australian nurseries with


little of any quality. Connie Christie, Kay Druce, Jean Elder,
Peg Maltby et al. introduced a new pictorial vocabulary that
devalued the fantasy tradition in Australian illustration. 57
These crudely produced printings demanded an
approach to illustration that was far removed from the earlier
fantasy tradition of the 1920s with its lavish ornamentation
and sophisticated style. The new demands of the 1940s
printings were for a much simplified style with broad washes
of colour. The basic need was to produce a cheap item for the
mass market and the result was that many of the illustrations
were bland and uninspired, often with little to differentiate the
style of different illustrators. Even when someone formerly as
accomplished as Ida Rentoul Outhwaite was lured back into
producing a nursery rhyme volume after ten years of absence
from the book illustrating scene the result was disappointingly
lacklustre. 58
The National Library of Australia?s Australian National
Bibliography, 1901?1950 (1988) lists at least forty such titles
primarily produced at the very end of the war years. To this
total we can add at least a further fifteen titles from other
bibliographical sources. This is a range of publications starting
in the early 19405, peaking in the most prolific year of 1945
and then declining to 1949; from the anonymously illustrated
works of the early 1940s to those by recognised illustrators in
the mid 1940s followed by Kay Druce and Rufus Morris
immediately thereafter.
While there seemed little interest in composing
indigenous nursery rhymes there was a slight predilection for
extending or retelling traditional nursery rhymes. This was
usually done to provide alternative happy endings although the
final result, unfortunately, provided bland nursery pap as these
rhymes were divested of imaginative rigour and robust appeal:
Little Miss Muffet
Little Miss Muffet
Sat on a tuffet,
Eating of curds and whey;
There came a big spider,
And sat down beside her,
And frightened Miss Muffet away.
Then Boy Blue came by
And took her up high
On a big downy feather so white;
They watched the birds play
Till the end of the day,
And floated home safely at night.
Frederick O. Barnett, Happy Endings to Old
Nursery Rhymes (1947)
Baa, Baa, Black Sheep
Baa, baa, black sheep,
Have you any wool?
Yes, sir; yes, sir,
Three bags full:
One for my master,
One for my dame,
But none for the little boy
That cried down the lane.
Little boy, little boy,
Where do you go?
Through lane and meadow where
Buttercups grow.
Little boy, little boy,
Why do you stay?
The black sheep is standing
There in the way.


Little boy, little boy,
Why do you cry?
The black sheep is bleating:
Why cannot I?
Eve Pownall, Nursery Rhymes Told Anew (c.1950).
Nursery rhymes are by their very nature economic verses
whose brevity of line and action encompasses just enough for
very young minds to handle and no more. These authors of
nursery rhyme extensions were inevitably making the verses
into extended narrative and moving well away from the realm
of nursery rhyme by attempting to impose logical conclusions
to their tales. According to the Opies there was something like
a fashion for these extensions in England and America at the
time. 59
Among the very few attempts at producing nursery verse
for Australian children during the war years was a robust
example written and illustrated by the Sydney cartoonist Unk
White: Twinkle Twinkle Southern Cross (1943). Its local setting
and eye-catching illustrations contrasted with the rather effete
and sentimental approach of other traditional fare and the
work?s appeal is as fresh today as it was almost fifty years ago.
Twinkle, Twinkle, Southern Cross
Twinkle, Twinkle, Southern Cross
What you are, I?m at a loss
Up above the world so high
You look like diamonds in the sky
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothing shines upon
Then you show your little stars
Like lights of fairy motor-cars
Then your bright and tiny spark
Lights the swaggie in the dark
Then you show your little beams
To light the way to happy dreams
Now Mrs Roo in all the dark
Thanks you for a tiny spark
How could she see which way to go
If you did not twinkle so?
On my roof the wombat plays
Basking in your silvery rays
Happy as a lark to be
?Twixt the sky and you and me
One two three ?and then two more
At school we learn that?s over four
But what you are, I?m at a loss
You?ve got me thinking, Southern Cross
In the dark blue sky you keep
And often through my curtains peep
For you never shut your eye
?Til the sun is in the sky.
Unk White, Twinkle Twinkle Southern Cross (1943)
The most significant collection of indigenous nursery
rhymes published in the 1940s was Harold Charles? Australian
Nursery Rhymes (1945). Presumably it reached an appreciative
audience for in a short time a more lavishly presented, if
abridged, edition appeared entitled New Nursery Rhymes.
TWINKLE, TWINKLE. SOUTHERN CROSS


While some of these rhymes warrant reprinting for today?s
audience most have neither the pith nor the energy of earlier
Australian attempts in the genre:
Greedy Me!
A carrot, a pumpkin, an onion, a pea,
All grow in my garden for somebody?s tea.
Now who do you think that someone can be;
A lady; a gentleman? No; just me!

Gobbled Granny?s Gooseberry Pie.
Sour and tart was Granny?s pie
Sorry and sad was Greedy Guy.

Cloppity, cloppity, clop.

Pussy, Wash Your Face
Pussy, wash your face,

To Market We Canter
To market we canter, we canter away,
On Robin, and Blossom the old dappled grey;

As we canter along, hear their shoes sing this song:

Three ha?pence for tuppence,
Three ha?pence for tuppence,
Their shoes seem to say.
Three ha?pence for tuppence,

Wasn?t he simple,
The foolish clown.

In the immediate post-war years, there continued to be a
relative indifference to indigenous children's verse in general
and one has to search particularly hard to find any attempts at
nursery rhymes:
Sing a song of sixpence,
Sing a song of sense,
Half a dozen kookaburras,
Sitting on a fence.
What are they all there for,
Bring some meat and see.
Twenty more come flying down,
On a jolly spree.
Meat for which he works not,
For each laughing jack,
Treat them very kindly now.
And they?ll all come back.
Sing a song of sixpence,
It?s worth sixpence to see,
Six and twenty jolly jacks,
Waiting for their tea.

Naughty Freddy Freckleface
Wouldn?t put his hat on,
Always stood upon the chairs,
When they should be sat on.

Perhaps the most significant volume of Australian
children's verse published in the 1950s was Mary Gilmore's
Verse for Children (1955). Even though this was from the pen
of so venerated a figure as Gilmore the work only achieved
publication in a small edition and that in which the type was
hand-set! Some of these verses, as the dustwrapper proclaimed,
'are nursery rhymes, with a lilting cadence that a child, once
hearing, will never forget':
Run Little Bettykin
Run, little Bettykin,
Run, run, run!
Silver stars a penny,
And thrippence for the sun!
But better than the sun
Is the nice new moon;
If Betty eats her porridge
She shall have it for a spoon.
Mary Gilmore, Verse for Children ( 1955)
One Snail, Two Snails
One snail and two snails
Had a little talk:
One snail and two snails
Went a little walk.
They came to a garden
And climbed up a tree,
Where a jolly old kookaburra
Gobbled up the three.
Mary Gilmore, Verse for Children (1955)
Bones in a Pot
Little Billy Button
Said he wanted mutton;
Miss Betty Bligh
Said she wanted pie;


But young Johnny Jones
Said he wanted Bones?
Bones in a pot,
All hot!
Mary Gilmore, Verse for Children (1955)
Mary Gilmore had first displayed an interest in
Australian children?s folklore as far back as 1914 when she
edited the ?Women?s Page? of The Australian Worker and tried
to encourage readers to send in children?s play rhymes.
Significantly, one of the most memorable short poems in her
1955 volume is ?Pulling the Sheets? which reads like a
children?s play rhyme itself. One can easily imagine a nursery
audience clapping in time and accompanying this poem with
other appropriate hand actions:
Draw the sheet, draw the sheet,
Draw the sheet and over;
We made the cloth of linen thread,
And bleached it in the clover.
Draw the sheet, turn the sheet.
Fold the edges under;
We saw the bud upon the flax,
And watched it in a wonder.
We saw the blue, the bonny blue,
And then the blue was over;
We hulled the flax that made the sheet,
And bleached it in the clover!
Mary Gilmore, Verse for Children (1955)
The use of the nursery rhyme format for satiric effect in adult
verse (which had been used to such good effect in the 1920s
by George Gibson and CJ. Dennis) was reactivated in the
1950s by Lex Banning. A number of his most striking poems
in Apocalypse in Springtime (1956) were based on traditional
nursery rhymes and include a terse and rather chilling
variation on ?There Was a Crooked Man?:
Nursery Rhyme
There was a crooked man
who walked a crooked mile,
while the crooked hands ran backwards
around the crooked dial.
He found his crooked journey
led him through a crooked town,
where all his crooked neighbours
were running up and down,
and conducting crooked businesses
in crooked shops and stalls,
while their shadows capered crookedly
upon the crooked walls.
So he followed their example
and, as he passed along,
sold his birthright for a fortune:
he had got it for a song.
He thought he had a bargain,
and was overheard to say,
?That sometime every crooked dog
must have his crooked day.?
But even as he said it,
and drew a crooked breath,
he reached his crooked mile?s end
and was straightened out by death.
Lex Banning, Apocalypse in Springtime (1956)


Banning?s use of the nursery rhyme format in his adult
verse was clearly acknowledged when his collected poems were
published: There Was a Crooked Man. One of this book?s most
memorable pieces was ?Nursery Rhyme for an Astronaut?:
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
how I wonder where you are?
How do you hide your ruddy face
in the midst of all this space?
Twinkle, twinkle, little sun,
going past me on the run.
Just like, as said some other guy,
a bleeding teatray in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little moon,
much too near you much too soon.
Until you move your ambling cliff,
both of us are frozen stiff.
Twinkle, twinkle, little Earth,
what a lovely rotund girth,
lovely people, lovely gin,
after nothingness spread thin.
Lex Banning, There Was a Crooked Man (1987)
Also in the 1930s J.D.G. Medley wrote a clever adult
version of ?Sing a Song of Sixpence? in his Australian Alphabet
(1953):
1933
Sing a song of Melbourne!
Money by the sack!
Fifteen hundred squatters
Squatting in Toorak.
Heaven all about them:
Hear the angels sing
?Strictly no admittance here;
God Save the King!?
1953
Sing a dirge for Melbourne,
All gone to the pack!
Squatters can no longer
Lord it in Toorak.
Lo! where castles glittered
Flatlets with con. mod.
That?s where squatters live now,
Chanting ?lchabod!?
J.D.G. Medley, Australian Alphabet (1953)
By the 1960s there was a great upsurge in the quantity of
Australian verse being published yet even so there were few
capable practitioners lured by the charms of children?s verse let
alone nursery verse. One of the few poetic voices to respond was
Irene Gough in One Sunday Morning Early (1963). This volume
was a breakthrough both in terms of the quality of its children?s
verse and for its presentation. Ure Smith, better renowned for
their production of fine art books, were the publishers and there
was nothing ephemeral or apologetic in its presentation.
One has only to compare it to Mary Gilmore?s volume of
children?s verse published nearly a decade earlier to appreciate
this advance in presentation. One of the most memorable
poems in Gough?s volume is a rhyming game, ?My White
Duck?, which begs for group recitation in which the whole
nursery could share:
First: My white duck, she flew one
Mile up to the fiery sun.
All: When I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My white duck flew home to me.


Second: My white duck, she flew two
Miles in to the city zoo.
All: When I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My white duck flew home to me.
Third: My white duck, she flew three
Miles out to the far country.
All: When I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My white duck flew home to me.
Fourth: My white duck, she flew four
Miles out to the far seashore.
All: When I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My white duck flew home to me.
Fifth: My white duck, she flew five
Miles to where the black shags dive.
All: When I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My white duck flew home to me.
Sixth: My white duck, she flew six
Miles into the mallee sticks.
All: When I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My white duck flew home to me.
Seventh: My white duck, she flew seven
Miles while looking out for heaven.
All: When I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My white duck flew home to me.
Eighth: My white duck, she flew eight
Miles back to her old home gate.
All: When I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My white duck flew home to me.
Ninth: My white duck, she flew nine
Miles away from me and mine.
All: When I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My white duck flew home to me.
Tenth: My white duck, she flew ten
Times away from me and when
All: I cried: ?Quark quacker duck,
Wherever can she be??
My duck never flew home to me.
Irene Gough, One Sunday Morning Early (1963)
Other poems in this book are also appropriate nursery
items combining as they do brevity of form with a sure ear for
rhythm and a sparse vocabulary untrammelled by fulsome
descriptions or sentiment:
Rock Wallaby
?Wallaby, wallaby
What do you eat,
Dancing the hills
On your nimble feet??
A berry, a leaf
Aaid a saltbush spray
Down by the spring
At dawn of day?
Irene Gough, One Sunday Morning Early (1963)

Clickety clack,

On the northern track.

With sidings to break

And hardly ever
A house between.
?Clickety clack,

Irene Gough, One Sunday Morning Early (1963)
The most significant promotion of Australian nursery
rhymes in the 1960s was provided by Joyce Saxby in her
carefully considered anthology, One Hundred Poems Chosen for
Children (1967). This anthology of Australian poems included
an entire section entitled 'Nursery rhymes and nonsense' which
featured ten nursery rhymes, opening with D.H. Souter's 'The
Man from Menindee' (sic). Due to the typographical layout,
the reader could be misled into assuming that all ten nursery
rhymes were by Souter! However, only the first is his and it is
the version found in Bush Babs. The remaining nine nursery
rhymes are taken (without acknowledgement) from the 'Red
Page' of the Bulletin for 18 October 1917 and are all by
different poets, even though this also is not acknowledged.
One of the characteristics of Australian children?s verse
since the mid 1970s has been an increasing element of
playfulness, of boisterous wordplay. Among the most
memorable examples are some which take their cue from
Dennis? use of Australian place names:
Oodnadatta
Parramatta
Names to make your tonsils chatter?
Tonsils chatter,
Silly patter
Oodnadatta
Parramatta.
Ronald Oliver Brierley
from Michael Dugan, comp., Stuff & Nonsense (1974)
Michael Dugan, Flocks? Socks and Other Shocks (1987)
There has also been an observable desire to amuse the
young reader at any cost and while comic verse holds a valid
place this desire has exposed us to much that is otherwise
quite trivial and pedestrian. Out of this often impetuous verse
the work of someone like Barbara Giles refreshes with its
unobtrusive craft and with no obvious desire to force
Australiana references upon the reader. Instead she takes
Dilemma

Oodnadatta

Gentle, more domestic, examples of nursery verse by
Michael Dugan and Lydia Pender avoid the high powered
energy levels generated by much of our recent children?s

Today a new regard for and an encouragement of
children?s folklore in Australia have fostered both research and
publishing enterprise. The (Melbourne) Institute of Early
Childhood Development, and June Factor in particular, have
turned the academic recording of children?s playground
rhymes into a more popular pursuit. In the process, such
folklorists have put Australians back in touch with a nationally
evocative area of nostalgia, with cultural continuity and,
perhaps most importantly, with an evolving sub-culture. In
short, they have returned many of us to our own childhoods
and showed that whatever our diverse environmental
conditions may have been, this unsophisticated outpouring of
playground rhyme is one shared link between generations.
And these spontaneous and irreverent outbursts have fuelled
the publication of at least seven popular anthologies in the
1980s. 60
I would claim that this elevation of what was once a
largely invisible sub-culture into mainstream culture has had a
discernible effect on adult poets: the newly accessible rhymes
of children have clearly influenced a number of our adult
poets in their choice of verse forms, subjects and approaches.
The zeal with which children parody traditional nursery
rhymes and mock or overthrow their elder's assumptions of
childhood innocence has been recognised and appropriated by
such contemporary Australian poets writing for children as
Max Fatchen and Bill Scott. It will be interesting to see if the
direction of this inspiration will be reversed, if some of these
adult attempts which utilise the nursery rhyme format will
enter Australian family folklore and thereafter be themselves
subjected to change by their young audience. This energising
process guarantees that our children's folklore remains a vital
component of contemporary culture rather than an ossified
relic relating only to past generations.

The chronological meanderings of Twinkle, Twinkle, Southern
Cross have walked many a crooked mile and unearthed much
made-to-order folklore of which some, at least, have a claim to
nursery fame. In the process they have offset the idea that
interest in and demand for Australian children's folklore was
only a relatively recent phenomenon. There is instead
historical and imaginative continuity between Molesworth
Jeffrey in mid-nineteenth-century Tasmania rewriting
traditional nursery rhymes for his deprived children and
today's poets reinvigorating the nursery rhyme format for a
contemporary Australian audience.
Twinkle, Twinkle, Southern Cross offers a new
constellation of nursery rhyme characters and nursery rhyme
lore. As claimed at the beginning of this survey:
to that vast menagerie that includes blind mice, an
amorous frog, lost sheep and a cat with a fiddle can
[now] be added Australian denizens such as leaping
kangaroos, irrepressible laughing kookaburras, fearsome
bunyips and clever rabbits who outsmart the dingo!

Twinkle, Twinkle, Southern Cross combines scholarship and entertainment as it
wanders many a crooked mile through the made-to-order folklore of Australia?s own nursery rhymes.
In the process it offers a new constellation of nursery characters to add to the more traditional figures.
Thus ?The Man from Menindie?, and ?Sammy the Swaggie? are introduced as folklore figures
appropriate to the Australian child?s interests and experience.
Examples from as early as 1854 and extending to the present day are examined in a wide-ranging
context of Australian literary and publishing history, the growth of nationalism and the welfare and
education of young Australians.

Robert Holden was born in Brisbane in 1948 and is currently the Director of
the National Trust's Museum of Australian Childhood (Sydney). He has
published and lectured widely on the history of Australian art and illustration,
on nineteenth-century photography and on children's literature and folklore.
