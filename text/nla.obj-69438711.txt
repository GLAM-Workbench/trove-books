From inquiry amongst the Bedouins and European residents in
Palestine it was ascertained that during the early summer the
level of the sea falls at least 6 feet below the level at which it
stood on the day the levelling was taken, which would make the
depression 1298 feet, and we may conclude that the maximum
depression at no time exceeds 1800 feet. Lieut. Syraonds, k.e.,
in 1841, made the depression 1312*2 feet.
The soundings in the Dead Sea by Lieut. Vignes of the
French Navy, gave a maximum depth of 1148 feet; making
the depression of the bottom of the Dead Sea 2446 feet below the
level of the Mediterranean.
The soundings in the Mediterranean midway between Malta
and Candia by Captain Spratt, E.N., gave a depth of 13,020 feet,
nr a depression of the bottom five times greater than that of the
bottom of the Dead Sea.
The levelling was executed by two independent observers, and
from a comparison of the two sets of levelling it is certain that
the levels have been obtained with absolute accuracy to within
3 or 4 inches.
The establishment of a chain of levels across the country with
Bench-marks cut on so many points cannot but prove of the utmost
importance for any future investigations or for any more extended
surveys in Palestine, such as are contemplated by the Society
which has been formed, since this survey was made, ?for the
accurate and systematic investigation of the archaeology, the topo-
graphy, the geology and physical geography, &c., of the Holy
Land for Biblical illustration.?
For the survey of Jerusalem itself it was of the utmost importance,
as it enabled us to connect all the levels in and about the city with
the level of the Mediterranean, and to harmonise, so to speak,
all the levels which have been taken.
XV. ? Journal of an Expedition from the Government Camp ,
Camden Uarhour, to the Southward of the Glenely River in
North-Western Australia. By E. J. Sholl, Esq.*
[Communicated by the Colonial Office.]
*
Monday , April 10th, 1865. ?Immediately after leaving the
camp we ascended a hill to the south-east, very stony and rocky,
yet, as usual, clothed with grass; and for about an hour we
* See Mr. Martin?s Journal of Explorations in the same region, * Journal Royal
Geographical Society,? vol. xxxy. p. 237. No map embodying the recent surveys
of the district has yet been received by the Society, but the map in Grey and
Lushington?s ?Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-Western
Australia? may be consulted with reference to the present memoir.? [Ed,]


travelled over country of a similar description, yet with hills
gradually decreasing in height. The country was lightly timbered
with eucalyptus, cork, and cotton trees, all of small diameter. The
hills we passed over might, I conceive, be made passable for carts
with very little labour. Everywhere we passed through grass, the
country presenting the appearance of a -wheat-field, the grass
being generally above the horses? bellies, and occasionally even
above the heads of the riders. From the summit of the highest
hill we had a splendid view of Camden Harbour, with its islands
and headlands to our right and rear, with Mount King in the
distance to our right and front. The baobab described by Dr.
Martin is situated in flat country; and, indeed, after leaving
the hills in rear of our camp, we travelled over tolerably level
country, occasionally undulating with ironstone gravel, having
the appearance of being waterwashed in heavy floods. The
ground was in places very soft, and must be boggy during the
winter season. Ido not consider that we have had a winter, or
rather rainy season, this year. About a mile on our course from
the marked baobab we passed over several gullies, with quartz
scattered among the gravel. After leaving this country we as-
cended some tolerably elevated ground, from which we saw Mount
Lookover, Port George IV., and Augustus Water, in our rear;
and Mount King to the south-west. Mount Lyell lay to the
south-east of us, and was plainly seen. Passing over the level
country we saw several kangaroos. The land was still lightly
timbered with eucalyptus, what is here named the cork-tree, cotton-
tree, box-tree, and, where the ground was particularly soft, cab-
bage-palms.
Shortly before our midday halt we commenced crossing the
Hampton Downs, which, at this particular spot, was not so well
grassed as the country we had previously passed over, but it
gradually improved. We encamped at noon, amidst abundance
of feed, on the bank of a stream which I thought to be a branch or
tributary of the Gairdner River, We had previously passed over
a larger stream, with somewhat boggy approaches, and having on
its banks, where we crossed, a small thicket of palms, an euca-
lyptus, with large broad leaves, and other shrubs and trees more
vividly green and throwing more shade than is generally found in
Western Australia. These streams evidently took their rise in
the McDonald range, and ultimately joined the Gairdner. They
were shallow, but during the rainy season these, as well as many
dry stream-beds which we crossed, must contain a large body of
water. The stream upon which we camped was running to the
southward. We bivouacked under what is here called the currant-
tree, about 9 or 10 feet high, greyish striated bark, with twisted
branches. The leaf is bright-green, smooth on the upper surface,


5 inches long 1 , and Ito inch broad. The fruit has a pleasant
acid taste ?black when ripe. It is of the size of a very small
currant, and, like most Australian fruits, has more stone than
flesh. It grows in small bunches, the fruit being in different
stages of maturity, green, red, and black. The stone or seed is of
a flat, oval shape. The branches appear to be adapted for boat-
knees, being light and tough. Close by there was another tree,
altogether unlike what I have seen elsewhere. It was a tall,
rough-barked young tree. The branches do not spread, but take
an �upward direction, and the leaves spring from the smaller
branches in fours. They were pointed, about inches long and
f inch broad in their widest part, or the centre ; they are of a
light-green colour. The tree was about 10 inches diameter at the
butt, or thickest part. There was also near us the everlasting
eucalyptus, with its smooth white stem and branches. The grass
at this place was principally kangaroo-grass. More birds were
seen on our way than we have met with at the camp. They were
principally pigeons, of a brown colour, but not bronze-winged.
Started at 3 o'clock, by which time the sun was less powerful.
Our party now consisted of eight, with four packhorses, and we
made a track, going in single file, which will last for some time.
We steered an east course through Hampton Downs ?a well-
watered country : creeks, running in the direction of the Gairdner,
being crossed every half or three-quarters of an hour. The land
was undulating, composed of ironstone, sand, and clay alternately,
and occasionally ?especially near some of the creeks ?of alluvial
soil. Whatever the soil might he, there was no lack of grass.
In crossing some of the streams, the ground was soft ?almost
boggy, and at the chosen fording-place of a branch of the Gairdner
Mr/Mc�ae?s horse was so far bogged as to oblige him to dis-
mount, To the southward of us there was a prominent hill, which
the settlers have named Mount Batten, and near it w r as the
elevated termination of a piece of high table-land, looking, until
we came closer to it, like a detached hill. They are conspicuous
landmarks. We halted for the night on the left bank of the
Gairdner, a small stream at this season, with boggy approaches
where we crossed it. The banks were fringed with palms. Our
halting-place was about 10 miles distant from the camp. During
the day I saw more grass than I have seen in any part of Western
Australia ; most of it kangaroo-grass, and some a reedlike grass, of
a coarse nature. Some of the grasses, especially those on swampy
land, w : ere sedgy. The day was tolerably cool throughout.
April 1 1th. ?Started at 20 minutes to 6, and steered an
easterly course for about an hour, and then E. by S. until 9 o?clock,
when we again resumed our easterly route to obtain a pass through
the hills. All the country passed over well grassed, and the


soil not so stony as that travelled over yesterday. On the banks
and in the immediate neighbourhood of the streams there was
rich alluvial soil. About an hour after leaving our halting-place
crossed a stream larger than that near which we camped last
night. We went over some very soft, boggy ground, and had to
pick our way carefully; but these places could be seen and, to a
great extent, avoided. Not so with the ? dry bogs,? as they are
termed. The ground is apparently firm?clay, with ironstone
gravel?hut is completely undermined. The horses plunged con-
tinually up to their knees, and no amount of care or circumspection
could prevent this. The ? dry bogs ? were in patches over some
four or five miles of country in our course. We skirted Mount
Lyell, a two-peaked hill; the distance between either peak being
being about 1 mile. Halted on the banks of a stream at 10 o?clock,
Mount Lyell bearing S.S.E., and distant about 2 miles. We passed
through a perfect thicket of reed-grass, growing high above our
heads; but generally the pasture consisted of kangaroo-grass,
very thick and very high. The horses, when camped in the high
grass, generally wandered to feed off less luxuriant growth.
Before this country becomes available to its full extent for stock,
the long grass will have to be burnt or cut down ; it will never be
eaten down. It may be trampled down, and allow room for the
young grass to spring; but in its present state the feed has no
attraction ?for horse-stock, at all events. The whole of the land
was lightly timbered with broad-leaved gum-trees, cotton, cork,
and box trees, all of slight girth. At 9 o?clock we rode up a hill
to look at the country. Mount Lyell was to the south of east,
and not far off. We had a good view all round, embracing the
valleys of the Glenelg and Prince Regent rivers. Our course was
through Mr. Mc�ae?s run and the Hampton Downs, the greater
portion of which are included in this run. The Hampton Downs
are all they have been described ?well watered and good feed.
The stream upon which we were encamped was running through
the Glenelg. Mr. Cowle stated our position to be lat. 15� 57',
long. 124� 59'. Left this place at 3 p.m,, and passed through a
splendidly-grassed country. The land improved very much, there
being less stone and more alluvial. As we neared the Glenelg
the trees increased in girth, but they were still scattered. There
was no undergrowth of scrub, nothing but grass. We had some
difficulty in crossing the numerous watercourses, some of them
being very boggy. If we could have seen our way the impedi-
ment would not have been heeded, but the thick and high sward
of grass concealed everything. We camped for the night on a
stream a few miles from the Glenelg, upon a plain of ironstone
gravel and quartz, but with the usual abundance of feed. We
estimate' the distance travelled to be 15 miles. Both peaks of


Mount Lyell were bare, the reddish-brown rock alone being visible.
Grass appeared on the slopes, and at the base some light timber.
During the day we saw some native plum-trees; the fruit.exactly
resembles a small plum, larger than a sloe. I was told that the
fruit was intensely bitter. I could only secure one plum, and,
content with the account given by others, did not taste it.
April 12th. ?Had a sleepless night, the mosquitoes being on
the qui vive until daylight. We proceeded towards the Glenelg,
steering about due south, as indeed we had done from our halting-
place at noon yesterday. Crossed several streams flowing towards
the Glenelg, which were more difficult to pass than those farther
north, the grass being higher and thicker, and the stream-beds
more soft. Mr. Mc�ae, however, was a first-rate pioneer, and,
after some trouble, we arrived on the banks of the Glenelg, at a
spot where it was divided into two branches ; both united lower
down, leaving a small island between the two. This we followed
for a about half a mile, when we came to some rapids; and at
this spot the stream we struck was united to the main branch.
The united streams were about 60 yards wide ; but in the rainy
season the river must be of considerable size, as there was
abundant evidence of the flow of a large body of water. The soil
on the bank is alluvial, in the bed of the river sandy and rocky.
We crossed at the rapids without wetting our feet ?the water was
not, in fact, above the horses? knees ?and then proceeded south
for about half a mile, where I determined to form my permanent
depot on the banks of a stream running into the Glenelg, with
abundance of feed, plenty of firewood, sufficient shade, and, in fact,
all that we require for the purpose. Our small tent was placed
facing the south ?our destined course ?where at the distance of
about a mile rise the Wheatley Hills. We arrived at this spot at
10 a.m. The country is generally gravelly, with occasional out-
croppings of rock, and here and there patches of alluvial soil.
There was no difference either in the character or quantity of the
grass, while the trees and shrubs were of the same description as
those we had passed before, except that at the Glenelg we again
met with the baobab, though not of so large a size as those near
our camp. On the banks of the river were paper-bark trees, lofty
but of no great girth, the thickest not being more than 10 or
12 inches diameter. The foliage was similar in shape to that of
the eucalypti, and possessed the same aromatic flavour. There
were also some trees of moderate height, more umbrageous than
the generality of Australian trees. They had a rougli blackish
bark, the leaves were dark and large, the trees bore a fruit not
in shape unlike a large white-heart strawberry, of a yellow-white
colour. The settlers called it the mulberry-tree, and say the fruit
when ripe is not unpleasant. What I tasted were acrid. Between


our depot-camp and the Glenelg we started a kangaroo, and on
the banks of the river saw a flock of black cockatoos, apparently
similar to those farther south. At our own depot the hawks, which
swarm to such an extent at Government Camp, began to collect
There were a few sand-flies and mosquitoes, but not swarming, as
they did at our bivouac the night before. Cool day.
April 13th. ?At a little before 7 A.M. Mr. Cowle and myself,
accompanied by Messrs. Mc�ae, Hindhaugh, Hick, and the native
Billy, started on our first exploratory trip in the Ranges. We
followed up the gully on which we were encamped for about an
hour and a half, our course being easterly, with a little southing.
The country was generally rough and occasionally boggy. Crossed
the stream-bed more than once, the fords being boulders of slippery
rock, over which the waters dashed. At its source we finally left
the stream and vainly attempted to make south, but the hills, for
the most part precipitous sandstone elevations, barred our progress.
We dismounted and walked up one of the hills, leaving Billy in
charge of the horses. The hill was of sandstone, with trap or
basalt at the base. From the summit the country looked very
rugged, especially in our course ?south?the hills being tumbled
together without any regard to arrangement, while the valleys
were as rock-strewn as the hills. On this hill was a solitary pine
?we had previously seen a few. It was not large, being from
12 to 15 inches diameter, and of moderate height. Descending,
we tried our best to round the hills, but were baffled by the fearful
country. Following on every occasion every valley which trended
anywhere near our course, we were continually driven back by
insurmountable barriers of rock. The valleys, in fact, were for the
most part ravines, or ended in ravines; the hills coming down on
either side, and allowing but a few feet of level country, if it can
be called level where masses of rock of every conceivable size, shape,
and angle, are strewn over the narrow path. The poor horses
were tumbling, jumping, and sliding every minute, their legs
and feet bleeding from the sharp rocks. After all this labour,
towards midday we found ourselves not more than 5 miles from
depot, with no prospect of getting farther south in this direction.
Before our noon-halt we tried to make the Glenelg by starting
north and east, but failing, bivouacked in a small grass-flat
surrounded by rocks, with a streamlet flowing through the centre.
We passed along several of these flats during our morning
journey. They were generally well grassed, and the soil was red
loam, but they were all of very limited extent. Grass as usual
was abundant in the most stony portions, and I only saw spinifex
among the crevices of the otherwise bare blocks of sandstone.
Starting at a quarter to 2 p.m. we pursued a generally north route,
sometimes a little to the east or west, according to the course of


the ravines. We were now gradually descending, having during
the former part of the day been going up-hill ?sometimes imper-
ceptibly, at others 30 and 40 feet in the course of a hundred yards.
We passed through masses of sandstone, assuming fantastic shapes
and forms, requiring but little effort of the imagination to give
them ? a local habitation and a name.? One plot of rock-scattered
ground bore a marked resemblance to a ruined churchyard. The
broken headstone, the dilapidated monument, the shivered pillar
and fragments of sepulchral architecture?all were there, while
some of the blocks were sharp in outline, and perfect as if they had
just left the stone-cutter?s yard. At half-past 2, although we had
since our noontide halt been travelling downwards, we were still
on very high ground, with the River Glenelg some hundred feet
below us, the descent being a perpendicular wall of rock ; on the
opposite side were hills of equal height and of equal steepness.
Here there were rapids. The course of the river was north and
south, taking, shortly from the spot where we were stationed, a
turn to the eastward, and afterwards a south-east direction. As
there was no chance of descending to the river at this spot, we
followed a course a little to the eastward of north, and travelling
down a ravine, the most steep, the most rugged, and the most
lengthy of any we had hitherto travelled, and which punished the
horses very severely, we emerged upon the level country south
of the Glenelg, and struck that river about a quarter of a mile
above the rapids which we crossed yesterday, and about two miles
below the spot where its course was from south to north. At
these rapids its direction was westerly. From the rapids we
proceeded to the depot-camp, which we reached at 5 o?clock. My
companions stated that the country was more rugged than any
they had previously passed over, and they had all more or less had
some experience of rough land ; one of them, indeed, had travelled
through the elevated Gipp?s Land territory. If our journey was
fatiguing it was not otherwise unpleasant. The day was fine and
cool; we had abundance of water ; the scenery was not only novel,
but extremely picturesque and often magnificent. A good bathe
in the depot creek soon restored energy and strength, and without
being damped by our non-success, w r e discussed the probable pro-
ceedings of the morrow. Seeing the impossibility of penetrating
the ranges in the direction we had pursued, we resolved to take a
south-westerly course as far as practicable.
April 14 th. ?A fine morning, but the flies, as usual, very
troublesome. We went round the west end of Wheatly Range,
travelling through more rugged country than even yesterday, but
there was not so much of it. We wandered about for some little
time, striving to penetrate through the hills, and struck the river,
pursuing a course a little to the northward of east. The Glenelg
YOL. XXXVI. P


was here running south. The cliffs came down to the water?s
edge on either side, and we had not gone far along the bank
before our way was stopped. We therefore pushed up the range,
following the ravines and valleys, and steering south wherever we
had a chance. The country was in every respect similar to that
which we traversed yesterday, except that the valleys were not so
well grassed, and there was more spinifex. After clearing the
hills we passed over some tolerably level table-land, sandy, and
thinly grassed, and at half-past 11 struck a large stream, which
we took at first for the Glenelg, but, as it was flowing north, it
was evidently a tributary. This stream I named, subject to the
Governor?s approval, the Mc�ae, after one of my companions, a
gentleman who had been of signal service to us throughout the
expedition. The river, where we struck it, was yards wide
from bank to bank, but the actual stream of water did not exceed
20 yards, or, at the furthest, 25 yards. On a ledge of rock
overhanging the river, we bivouacked; the horses looking at, but
not touching, the spinifex. A spring of water burst from the rock,
and formed a small stream, from whence we got a supply for
ourselves and horses. On either side the rocks lined the river,
but the hills were of no very great height. Among the plants in
the neighbourhood I noticed the hollyhock?very similar to our
own in leaf and flower; and the honeysuckle, red and white
flowers, but scentless. The trees here, and in fact throughout
the ranges where we have been, are eucalypti, casuarina, acacia,
cotton, cork, box, and palms. Also some trees bearing a fruit
resembling in appearance, when ripe, a russet apple, and, when
unripe, a smooth green apple. It was intensely bitter, and
contained a large stone ?in fact, it was nearly all stone. There
were some splendid lilies in the river, which emitted a perfume like
the violet. They were of different colours?white, pink, and blue
??the two latter light tints, as if the original white had been
stained with colour. The river must rise in the ranges which we
see to the southward, and will most probably furnish a pass
through them. We could not, however, proceed in that direction
to-day, in consequence of Mr. Cowle?s horse having cut his leg
too severely to travel. In fact, all our horses were more or less
maimed. We started a kangaroo, but with so large a party it is
next to impossible to get near enough to have a shot. On our
return route we took a north-easterly course, following down a
brook which we crossed on our outward trip, and which was
descended by our horses with very great difficulty, owing to the
steepness and rocky nature of its bed. Before arriving at this
brook we crossed the sandy table-land of our outward track, above
a mile to the southward and eastward, and found it thinly clothed
with grass. We passed the Wheatly Range (by following the


before-named brook) to the westward of a detached hill on the
eastern point of the mountains. We left the Mc�ae at 2 o?clock,
and arrived at depot camp at half-past 3. All the flat lands
over which we have passed ?and they are not many, and limited
in extent ?possess a soil of either sand or ironstone gravel,
sometimes of both. The great peculiarity here, as well as in the
land to the north of the Glenelg, is the total absence of under-
growth bushes ; between the widely separated thin and short trees
there is nothing but grass and creepers. Let it be thin or thick,
good or bad, tall or short, still it is grass. The trees were gene-
rally of small girth ; the largest we have yet seen did not exceed
15 inches diameter, and trees of this size were very rare. The
baobab-trees of course are exceptions, for they, on the other hand,
are of enormous circumference; but after leaving the tree named
in my first day?s journal, we did not see another until we came to
the Glenelg, and then we met with a few. There is one or two
near our depot camp. They are an unfailing sign of water ?not
necessarily surface water, but of water at a short distance from the
surface. They are more plentiful near the government camp than
I have seen elsewhere. Looking through the opening at the back
of my tent, I see two as I am now writing, of noble girth, but not
so large as others. Between the camp and the well, and along
the now dry bed of the watercourse which supplied us when we
first landed, and until lately, there were several, and this makes
me the more confident that there will be no great difficulty in
obtaining water at the driest season. The palms are generally
indicative of surface water, and grow in soft swampy land, and
upon the margins of rivers and streams. In travelling along,
whenever we saw palms in our course, we prepared to flounder
through soft or boggy ground, and in nine cases out of ten the
ground was either the one or the other. The sandstones in the
ranges have every variety of size, form, and colour. From blocks
weighing hundreds of tons to pieces weighing a few grains; in
shape, columnar, tabular, pyramidal, in pavement blocks, like
gigantic walls, with every line separating each block, as level and
as closely cut as if placed there by human agency, like ruined
castles, with towers and battlements ?half defined and half
defaced, massive boulders, and pebbles of the size of marbles;
lying in every attitude, presenting angles in every possible position,
they seemed like the remains of cities, built by giants, and scattered
abroad in some great convulsion of nature. The hues of the rock
are varied to a degree ?dark brown, light brown, yellowish brown,
yellow, white, red of different shades; sometimes several colours
in the same rock. Again, while many rocks are clothed with
grass, others are quite bare. We have thus anything but monotony
among the ranges. Owing to the cause before stated, we could
p 2


not make a good day?s work, and our extreme distance south was
not more than three miles, hut the horses were nevertheless much
bruised, and cut about the legs, and seemed to have had enough
of it; so I determined to halt to-morrow (Saturday), and, as a
matter of course, on the succeeding day, and then make a three
days? trip, as there appears at last to be a chance of making some
southing. We had a tolerably cool day, and in fact when we got
among the hills the change of temperature for the better was
invariably marked. Upon examining the map, it would appear
either that we are not on the rapids named by Grey (at the spot
where the river bends to the southward), or that the Wheatly
Range, or the river itself, is incorrectly laid down. Our depot
camp is about three-quarters of a mile south-west of the rapids,
and the range faces us about half a mile, or from that to a mile
distant, its position being east and west. To the eastward, half a
mile?s travelling brings us to the eastern end of the small detached
hill round which we passed on our return trip this morning, and
by going a mile to the westward, we came round the western
point of the range. From a mile and three-quarters to two miles
is the extent of the range facing us to the south, neither end of
which, east or west, is distant more than a mile from the River
Glenelg, According to the map, our present position is two miles
to the eastward of the range, or in fact on the opposite bank of the
Glenelg. We are on a peninsula, hemmed in by the river on
every side, except south, with a point or two east or west of south ;
and such a peninsula! except the flat upon which we are encamped,
which extends back to the rapids, and up and down the river for
a limited extent, the country is one mass of sandstones, of more
or less elevation. Mr. Cowle informed me that he was not yet
perfectly satisfied of our exact position, but he was inclined to
believe that we were not on the rapids described by Grey. We
saw no marked trees, nor any other sign of Grey?s party.
April Ibth. ?To-day was the hottest we have experienced since
leaving Camden Harbour, the weather having been generally cool
?much cooler than I have experienced it at Government Camp.
We have also had some heavy dews at night?a very rare occur-
rence at camp. The festering sores which afflicted so many in
camp are also fast disappearing. Saw to-day a beautiful water-
lily growing in a different part of the creek upon which we are
encamped. It was sweet scented; the flower was large, white-
edged, with a fringe of light blue ; and under the surface was
blue, of a darker tint.
April Ibth. ?Remained in depot all day. Hawks swarming
about the place in hundreds. Not a thing could be left for an
instant but it was pounced upon, and, if at all eatable, carried
away. Wherever we go, one or two accompany us; and no


sooner are fires lit, and preparations made for meals, than they
come from all quarters. They are brown birds, about the size of
a small fowl. They are fearless, and stand to be shot at, not
moving, though the revolver-bullets strike the branch upon which
they are perched within an inch of their bodies. Bathed in a pool
of water a few hundred yards down our creek ?a pleasant place,
surrounded by palms, the only approach to tropical vegetation
which I have seen.
April 17 th. ?We all had a tolerable night?s rest, and started at
20 minutes to 7 a.m. on our journey. The party consisted, besides
myself, of Mr. Cowle, who is somewhat better this morning, Mr.
Mc�ae, Mr. Hick, and Billy. We took three days? provisions.
The day was fine, but calm. Found a much better pass to the
eastward of the Wheatly Range than the one we travelled on
Friday, on our return route, by following up a creek. At half-
past 8 arrived at a spot a quarter of a mile north of our bivouac
on Friday, travelling over comparatively easy country, tolerably
well grassed. From this place we attempted to get south by
following creeks, but did not make more than half a mile in a
direct line by 10 o?clock, when we were brought up by a creek,
with rocks to the water?s edge on either side, and a barrier of
rocks in the centre, over and among which the water tumbled very
prettily. A fringe of palms skirting the stream added to its
picturesque appearance. Mr. Hick shot two white cockatoos,
somewhat different from those I had seen at Camden Harbour.
The topknot was white, and the feathers under the wings light
yellow. At Camden Harbour the topknot is sulphur-coloured.
Got, near our halting-place, some berries, not unlike, in appearance,
black currants. They grew on a tree, not dissimilar in height
and appearance to the one described as being at our noontide
halting-place on the 10th instant. The fruit, however, was dif-
ferent, larger, and growing on stalks?not in bunches ; the leaves
were light-green, smooth, 4 inches long, and inch broad.
They call it the elder-tree, but there is not much similitude.
Around the camp I marked some smooth-barked white gum-trees,
larger than any we have before seen ?about 18 inches in diameter.
Walked out with Messrs. Cowle and Mc�ae to have a look at
the country to the southward and westward. We went about a
mile, and found, with the exception of some rocks near the camp,
that the course, for this country, was fair travelling. Mr. Mc�ae
and myself climbed up two hills, Mr. Cowle being too unwell to
make the attempt. We found the appearance of the country to
the southward promising, hut due south the ranges seemed to bar
our progress. The Wheatly Range was beneath us to the north,
and we could see over it the hills on the other side of the Glenelg.
On one of the hills which we ascended there was a cave, in which


were the remains of a native fire?apparently one native. It was
recent ?that is to say, about ten days or a fortnight old?the ashes
not having been either much disturbed by the wind or intermixed
with dust and droppings from the roof the cave. We saw the
McDonald ranges in the distance, and also Mount Lyell, far
away from and beneath us. We estimated our height above the
sea-level at 1800 feet. On our return picked up a piece of stone
which the natives had been sharpening for their spears and knives,
&c. It is something like obsidian, but not so highly glazed. The
hills which we climbed were sandstone, with trap or basalt at the
bases and in the valleys. The trap-rock was intersected by veins
of quartz, and there was a peculiar outcropping of that stone in
small, spiculse and large crystals. The ground at the base of the
hills was strewn with the debris of quartz, some of it as fine as
sand.
April ISth. ?Left camp at half-past 7. Crossed numerous
creeks and streams; this country is beautifully watered, and,
steering 8.W., at half-past 8 struck the Mc�ae. At this spot it
consisted of large reaches, bordered by palms and lofty paper-
bark trees. The reaches were connected by narrow channels formed
by the hills descending on either side. These channels were rock-
strewn, and the water passed over between the rocks, either in the
form of cascades or rapids, according to the height. We crossed
the Mc�ae at one of the rapids, and followed it up, the stream
running about n.n.e., we of course steering in an opposite direction.
The travelling became very difficult; the hills were often perpen-
dicular, like walls of masonry, for in many places even the joints
are distinctly marked, always precipitous. Our course was at the
base; and when the ledge of rocks over which we travelled sloped
off to the water?s edge, we had to cross the stream the best way
we could, and make our way along the opposite side until similar
impediments compelled us again to ford the river, which we crossed
and recrossed five times. Some of these fords were difficult, owing
to the masses of rock of all shapes, over whose slippery points and
surfaces the horses stumbled, and sometimes fell, but happily no
accident happened to horse or rider. At one place we were
blocked in on both sides, and had nothing for it but ascending
the bank. We were at the time on the right side of the Mc�ae,
and luckily the hill was not so steep as its neighbours. It was,
however, quite steep enough ?something like Mount Eliza, at the
back of my former residence, but not so high. We dismounted
and led our horses, not going straight up the ascent, but twisting
and turning among the large stones, and thus saving the animals
an additional pull. Halting on the summit of the hill to breathe
ourselves and horses for 10 minutes or so, we pursued our journey.
By the river?s side I noticed a peculiar-looking tree, the only one


of the sort that I observed during our journey. It was larger
than its companions, and looked more like an English forest-tree
than any I 'have seen in Australia. It was richly clothed with
dark foliage, threw out long and spreading branches, and was a
complete shade-giver. The leaves somewhat resemble the myrtle.
The soil of the country over which we passed was sandy near the
river, in patches between the rocks, and reddish brown upon the
hills ; but rocks and stones were everywhere, and grass of course.
We have never been without grass?much of it coarse and rank,
but most of it sweet and good. Saw some yellow-crested cockatoos
near the hill which we had just climbed. The descent on the
other side was not so abrupt, and we had no occasion to dismount.
Passing over some level bare rocks, with here and there ledges
from half a foot to a foot high, we were again brought to a halt
at some rapids, which appeared difficult to cross, while our progress
was barred by a wall of rocks, with no convenient shelf wide
enough for our horses. In some still water a short distance from
the rapids there were beautiful water-lilies white, with edges
fringed with filaments like feathers or down. The flower was
five-petaled, small, and inodorous. With some splashing and
slipping, we crossed the rapids, and, ascending a stony hill of
moderate height, came along some tolerably level country for about
a quarter of a mile. Here I observed for the first time, though it
afterwards* appeared that it was?if not plentiful ?pretty generally
dispersed, a fruit-bearing plant, about feet high. There are
two stems springing distinct from each other, the shorter one about
one foot long, bearing a leaf which resembles somewhat the potato-
plant ; the longer one, 2 feet, bears the fruit in three pendulous
seed-vessels, in shape like the English gooseberry, and enclosing
a large number of striated seeds, enclosed in a sweetish pulp, the
flavour being more grateful than most of the so-terrned edible
fruits of the country. The colour of the ripe seed-vessel is a rich
sugar-brown. It exudes saccharine matter, and is sticky and
clammy. I picked a specimen, root, stalks, leaves, and fruit; and
also collected some fruit, which became crushed, and afterwards
fermented in my havresack, but I managed to save tbe seed.
When I arrived home, my son produced some specimens he had col-
lected in the immediate neighbourhood of the camp; so it was no
novelty, after all. Almost immediately after passing these plants,
we came to a patch of baobab-trees, the first I had seen since
leaving the Glenelg. Still following the course of the Glenelg?
we were now on the left bank?we crossed again at some rapids,
and, ascending a bank of moderate elevation and steepness, pro-
ceeded along some richly-grassed table-land?clayey soil, with
stones intermixed?until gradually nearing the water?s edge, the
accustomed rocky bar compelled us once more to cross the river.


Travelled over some bare rocky ground, full of ledges and fissures,
and, coming to a grassy flat, we camped at noon in its midst,
among a clump of short trees, sufficiently close together to throw
a grateful shade. Our halting-ground was about 80 yards from
the Mc�ae, distant from our sleeping-camp 7 miles, and from the
depot (due south) 9 miles. Our course has been rather to the
westward of south. While at dinner a hawk, more bold than his
companions?and none of them are too modest?pounced down
among the trees, and was easily caught by one of the party, and,
after due examination, let go. Messrs. Mc�ae and Hicks ascended
a hill to the westward of our camp, and reported that the country
looked clear in the direction of our course, but said there was a
range running north and south to the eastward. We left camp
at 3 P.M., and following up the river shortly afterwards, passed
through a very small patch of thicket, with climbing-plants cross-
ing from tree to tree, obliging us to cut our way. The soil was
alluvial, and very soft. Here I saw ferns for the first time?a
delicate feathery-leaved plant. After emerging from this thicket,
we travelled over undulating country, gradually ascending in our
course, which was now due south. The flat through which we now
passed was bounded east and west by hills rising like walls, with
occasional valleys between, of apparently similar flat land. The
distance between the hills on either side was at first but a few
yards, but this gradually extended, and the average width of the
plain during the 6 miles we went over it was almost, if not quite,
half a mile. It was splendidly grassed, and the herbage was
thinner and less rank than on the north side of the Glenelg, and
more fitted for the immediate use of stock. The soil was generally
gravelly, sometimes sandy, and occasionally rich loam. Judging
by the habits and tastes of our horses, I should prefer taking up
land of this description for stock to the more densely-grassed
country contained in Mr. Mc�ae?s run; but this was comparatively
a small patch, although the valleys running at right angles on
either side, as well as many of the hills, seemed equally well grassed.
The Mc�ae had now dwindled into a creek, no longer broken into
wide reaches; and after following it along the valleys, it branched
off, one stream coming from the westward and the other from the
southward. The latter we considered the main stream, and, as
it was in our course, continued to follow it up through rocky
country. After travelling about 3 miles among our old friends
the sandstones, we camped for the night in a narrow valley, through
which the Mc�ae, a small but still running stream, flowed, and
which was fairly grassed. The hills on either side are not high,
and the horses relished the grass, which was short and sweet.
Noticed the banksia-tree on the banks of the Mc�ae, not having
seen it north of the Glenelg. It is short and scrubby, and seems


out of its latitude. It is apparently peculiar to the Mc�ae.
Several kangaroos were started during our day?s march. Mr,
Cowle informed me that we were 2500 feet above the sea-level.
I should not have thought so; but as we have been ascending,
generally gradually, and sometimes abruptly, since we left the
Glenelg, I suppose it must be so. We had now come about
19 miles south of our depot-camp; and as there is nothing to
prevent the movement of pack-horses, while there is some prospect
of our proceeding still further south, I determined to shift the
depot-camp, in furtherance of my slow and sure plan of feeling
the way in front, and being able to calculate as nearly as possible
how long it would take to remove the party back on our tracks
through a country which offered no serious impediment, now that
we had discovered passes through the hills, to tired and jaded
horses. Mr. Cowle places our present camp in about latitude
16� s.
April 19 th. ?Up at 10 minutes past 5, after a cool and re-
freshing night, and started at a quarter past 7. We passed
yesterday?s shady bivouac at 9. Noticed in the country we passed
over some scrubby stunted cypress, which also grew in the neigh-
bourhood of Camden Harbour. It is not however plentiful, nor is
it useful for any purpose, being a mere bush. The box-tree and
the cotton-tree very plentiful here and throughout our line of
route, the former a very hard and the latter a very soft wood.
Got to the flat, where we slept, on Monday at 20 minutes past 12.
Left at 3 p.m. and got back to the depot at a quarter past 5,
travelling back on our tracks with good speed. Resolved to rest
our horses until Friday, and then move on.
April 21st. ?Did not start until 8 o?clock. Proceeded to our
sleeping-camp of Monday and had to halt, my horse having twisted
off its off hind-shoe in the ranges. Noticed more particularly at
this spot the native apple-trees. They were loaded with fruit,
a bout the size of a small apple, and which I have formerly described.
The tree is about 30 feet high, the stem 6 inches diameter; bark
dark brown, lying in flakes; leaves in pairs, eight pairs being on
one stalk, of a light-green colour, narrow and pointed at the end,
about 2 \ inches long and 1 inch wide in the broadest part; the
stalk upon which the leaves are placed 15 inches long. The shrub
called the sand-paper plant is also here, as well as at Camden
Harbour. The leaves are dark green, with a rough upper surface,
like fine sand-paper ; they are dry and crisp, but not brittle or
easily broken. The leaves grow in pairs, upon a stem rising from
the ground about 4 feet high. They are 3� inches long and
2 inches wide, and nearly oval. There were trees in our neighbour-
hood, the stem clothed with brown stringy bark, the branches
white and smooth, like the ordinary white gum of the country,


and the leaves we�e also precisely similar. It presented a very
strange appearance, but my companions recognised it as the ? Gum-
top Stringy-bark ?of Victoria. A graceful-looking tree close by
attracted my attention. It was 40 feet high, the stem 4 inches
in diameter, leaves dark yellowish green, 6 inches long, 2\
inches wide, thick, and rounded at the apex. Started from this
camp at a quarter past 2, and at 5 o?clock halted on the right
bank of the Mc�ae, in splendid feed of kangaroo-grass up to the
horses? bellies. We were on a small flat containing about 100 acres
of this feed, which grew on clayey soil, and our camp is fixed in a
clump of young trees about 60 or 70 yards from the river?s bank.
The river flows from south to north, and here forms the arc of
a bow, which encloses our flat. On the opposite or west side
of the stream the sandstone-hills rise to a great height, sinking
lower towards the south.
April 22nd. ?At 9 o?clock this morning we arrived at our
destination, the junction of the two creeks. Resolved to halt here
until noonday, and then push on a flying party to the southward.
We are on a rocky piece of ground, with the Mc�ae, now a mere
brook, running close by. About our camp lizards of every size
and colour sport among the rocks.
April 23rd. ?There was a cool breeze from the southward this
morning, but the sun?s rays were very powerful. We have lost
mosquitoes, sandflies, and other flies, but the ticks are very
troublesome, crawling about in every direction, and much annoying
the horses. Six or seven are cut out of our nags at one time.
The hawks still accompany us, and one was caught by hand. When
laid down he stretched Ids legs, shut his eyes, and was to all
appearance ?what he intended us to believe?dead. Upon moving
a step or two back, he raised his head, and seeing that simulating
death would not do, commenced pecking at the finger of his captor,
who had approached again towards him. When he saw that there
was no one nearer to him than a few yards, he leisurely flew a short
distance off. Bathed in a narrow reach of the Mc�ae, but without
much comfort, the bottom being composed of sharp-pointed rocks,
the water hot, and leeches in great numbers. Leeches were not
met with in the Glenelg, nor do we hear of their having been seen
in the neighbourhood of Camden Harbour. They seem to be
peculiar to the Mc�ae, as far as my experience goes. Mr. Cowle
makes the latitude of our camp 15� 59' 8".
April 2Uh. ?Started at a quarter past 7 upon our exploring
trip. We took with us three days? provisions, intending, unless
compelled to return in consequence of losing shoes, to be away
from camp for that period. Arrived at our halting-place of
Tuesday last at 8 a.m., and continuing to ascend the valley for
about half a mile farther on, we reached the summit of the range


up which we had been travelling since we left the Glenelg. Here
we dismounted, and leaving the horses in Billy?s charge, climbed
up the highest hill, which had an elevation of about 100 feet above
the valley, and may be considered the highest point of this part of
the range. The view was extensive, and the following bearings
were taken by Mr. Cowle and entered in my note-book at the
time:?A hill w. by N., distant about 9 miles, apparently sandy,
was supposed at the time to be the Red Cone Hill, near Doubtful
Bay, but this cannot be, as, upon reference to the map, that hill
appears to the southward of our position. The one we saw is
a remarkable hill, and easy of identification ; Mount Lyell n. by
w. J w.,* about 20 miles; Mount Double Cone n.w. by N., 25
miles; a table hill n. f E., about 35 miles. This we conjectured
to be Mount Waterloo. In our course there were three distinct
ranges of hills, all of which seemed to be much lower than the
one we were on. Their course averaged east and west. The
nearest and smallest range was distant about 5 miles ; the second,
somewhat higher, about 10 miles; and the third, the highest,
which looked blue in the distance, not less than 25 miles. The
country between us and the nearest range appeared practicable.
Mr. Cowle considered that we were now 3000 feet above the level
of the sea. As this is the highest point of the range in this direc-
tion, and the spot is prominent, I give it a name, and propose, with
the Governor?s consent, to call the hill Mount Cowle. Descending
the hill, we remounted our horses and proceeded over the crest
of the range. Immediately after leaving the source of the Mc�ae
on one side, flowing north, we struck the head of another creek on
the southern side, and flowing south. This we followed over very
rugged country (the country, by the by, which looked practicable
from the hill-top) for about 2 miles, when we were stopped by
a complete block of rocks before and on either side of us. We
had for some time been driven into the stream, there being no
passage on either side, and had made our way with difficulty
among large boulders of rock. The stream had increased rapidly
in width, depth, and volume, and though so near its source, was
larger than the Mc�ae, at our second depot. Mr. Hindhaugh
went ahead a short distance on foot to see whether there was any
chance of our getting along by another route, and on his return
reported that the country was impassable for horses. He had gone
down the rivulet for about a quarter of a mile, when it was joined
by a larger stream, and the united waters flowed towards the west-
ward. It would most probably be joined by numerous creeks from
this and the next parallel range, and by the time it reached the sea
* [According to the tracing subsequently furnished by Mr. Cowle, Mount Lyell
is placed a point or two to the eastward of north from Mount Cowle. ?E. J. S.]


coast have become a river of some magnitude. I think it not
improbable that, in the valley between either of the ranges which
we saw from Mount Cowle, a stream of more or less magnitude
flows towards the sea. We retraced our steps, leading our horses
over the worst portions of the ravine in which we were confined,
and encamped higher up the creek at 10 minutes to 12. The
latitude, by observation, of our camping-ground, was 16� 2' and
some odd seconds, our farthest south being as nearly as possible
16� 3'. Mr. Cowle made the longitude of our halting-place
124� 55' e. It was a pretty spot, overhung by sandstone cliffs,
between which the stream rushed over the rocks. On a ledge of
rock some 10 or 12 feet above the water we boiled the water for
tea, the horses feeding higher up the valley, where there was
a diminutive flat. Between the fissures of the rocks a sufficient
number of trees flourished to throw a grateful shade, some of which
I had not noticed before. There was one light grey-barked tree,
with dark-green leaves, pointed, 3J inches long by 2 broad, with
a fruit somewhat resembling the seed-vessels of the rose, which,
when ripe, were of a dark-red colour. They were sweet to the
taste, and grew upon a short stalk in clusters of 6or 8. Mr.
Hindhaugh brought in a sample of a narrow-leaved palm, the
leaves diminishing in breadth from half an inch to the thickness of
a thread ; they were fine and tough, and seemed well adapted for
the manufacture of hats, and when prepared, of cordage. I did
not see the palm itself, nor were anymore seen by Mr. Hindhaugh,
except a few in the locality where he procured this specimen.
I blazed some saplings at this place, from which exuded a large
quantity of white viscid fluid, which turned dark on exposure to
the light, looking not unlike india-rubber. One of the trees was
marked by Mr. Hindhaugh J. H., his initials, and these marks may
serve to identify the spot at some future time. The lizards were
very plentiful on the rocks, and they seemed to be of the same
colour as the particular mass of rock on which they sported ?the
various shades of brown and yellow. They were most expert fly-
catchers. Resumed our retrograde march at 3 o?clock, it being
my determination to return to depot, there appearing to be no
opening in this direction, and follow the branch of the Mc�ae,
which came from the westward, hoping to find an outlet to the
southward. We had not gone more than a mile when Mr, Cowle?s
horse lost a shoe, and we halted while Mr. Hindhaugh shod the
animal. Our last nail was thus consumed, and, recollecting
the nature of the country we had to pass on our way home, and
knowing how utterly useless a shoeless horse must be in these
ranges, I determined to return back without delay. Before
travelling in this country, not only should the horses be well shod,
but each rider should be supplied with a few spare shoes and


plenty of nails. The shoes themselves are seldom lost. We
arrived at the depot-camp by sundown, when I gave the order for
commencing our homeward march the next morning. Mr. Mc�ae
returned from a pedestrian trip shortly after my arrival. He had
been with Graham up the western branch of the river, and after
getting over some rough-and-tumble country, which however
could be traversed by horses, they gained the summit of some
table-land, which was, for this place, fair travelling, and extended
in the direction we intended to have gone. He considered the
opening at the spot where he turned back, about 4 miles from
camp, of a promising nature. During our trip to-day there was
less grass than usual, spinifex being the rule.
April Zbth. ?Returned on our tracks. Tried occasionally to
get a better crossing-place over the Mc�ae, but were not successful.
These crossings caused some little excitement, and the leading
horsemen generally waited on the opposite side to see the whole
party safely over. The scene thus viewed was not devoid of
interest. Masses of rocky hill, rising perpendicularly several
hundred feet above the water?s edge, with just sufficient ledge at
the base to permit the party in single file to travel along; the
river tumbling over immense stones at the ford; the hills, with
their accommodating ledge, on the other side. We (Mr. Mc�ae
and myself) just got across the third ford, and going a little down
the right bank of the river, turn, and after a few minutes? halt,
push through a thicket, which, although we have broken through
it three times before, seems as impervious as ever. It is formed of
stiff thorny trees, or rather shrubs, which spring up from among
the stones ; no vestige of earth to be seen. They are sufficiently
high to meet overhead. What with guiding the horses over the
stones, and defending head, body, and limbs from the thickets, all
are well employed. But this is not all. Showers of green ants
descend upon our heads and shoulders, and it must have been
amusing to a lookef-on to see persons at the same time hastily
engaged protecting themselves from ants, thickets, and the rocks
at their feet. Happily the thicket is a small one, and we emerge
hot enough, but with leisure, to destroy the insects which have
been persecuting us. The green-ant is about half an inch long, of
a light arsenic green, and dwells amidst the foliage of trees. Their
bite is very sharp, but beyond the pain at the time, no great in-
convenience is suffered. A small black ant, with a red head,
is a more troublesome insect For some time after being bitten
there is much pain, and the part swells. Their bite, in its effect, is
similar to that of the serjeant-ant. Luckily they are not so plentiful
as the green ant, nor do they reside in trees, otherwise passing among
their habitations would be a task unpleasant, to say the least. We
baited early at the camping-place of Monday week, and where


Mr. Mc�ae had marked the white-gum-trees. Here we remained
for the rest of the day. Two miles south of our present halting-
place we came down a very steep hill, to avoid that which we had
hitherto ascended and descended, and which I described in a former
part of my Journal. We did not gain by the change ;it was
quite as steep as the hill we avoided, but somewhat shorter.
Discovered among the rocks of our camping-place a creeping
plant, with leaves and tendrils like those of the cucumber, only
much smaller. The fruit was the size of a small cherry, quite
round, of a bright scarlet colour. The taste is like that of the
cucumber. This is the most uninteresting, as regards situation
and aspect, of our halting-camps among the ranges, and yet there
is a greater variety of trees and vegetable productions than in
any other. Each time that we have visited it I have found some-
thing new. I collect, as well as I can, specimens of fruits and
seeds, but from not having proper receptacles, many of them get
mixed, crushed, and broken. 1 also collect ripe seeds of every
plant near our camps, although I do not know the nature or the
character of the blossoms?many of them are creepers. This has
been an extremely hot day, Mr. Mc�ae told me that he had seen,
though not in this part of the North district, a guana having a
hood, which, when the creature is in repose, lies flat on its shoulders
and back, but, when it moves, is spread open, and when it jumps
from tree to tree, appears to act like a wing. It is of moderate
size?the guana, not the hood. Since my return my son informs
me that he has seen one of these animals. We saw very few
guanas during our journey, and I have not met with a snake in all
my rambles on foot and on horseback; but two have been seen by
our party during this journey?a small and a large one ?and
three were killed at the Government Camp in our absence?
one of them upwards of 10 feet long. They cannot be considered
plentiful in this part of Australia. We have seen numbers of
butterflies of endless variety and hue. An entomologist might
spend some months very pleasantly and profitably here. In fact
there is a new field opened for students of Natural History in
every branch.
April 26th. ?Did not start until half-past 7. Arrived at depot
No. 1 at 10 minutes past 10, and crossed the rapids at the
Glenelg at 10 minutes to 11. Here we halted. Mr. Cowle
states our latitude to be 15� 44' 28". He is convinced that these
are not the rapids of Grey, which are 2 miles further up the river.
I did intend strolling off to visit the lower rapids, but some of the
horses had swollen backs, and I thought it advisable to defer this
visit to a future time, and bring the animals home before they
got worse. By shifting saddles, padding, &c., we have hitherto
managed to save the horses, who have only suffered in the feet


and legs. In condition they are not worse?some of them I think
are better ?than when they left Camden Harbour. Noticed a
herb with a grass-like stem, with seeds like those of wheat, but
reversed, lying upon the stem like the barbs of a spear. We
started at a quarter to 3, and after crossing the divided stream of
the Glenelg?we had been encamped on the island between the
two streams ?struck a direct course, instead of following back
our tracks by the bank of the Glenelg. The numerous streams
which impeded our progress before therefore passed to the
eastward or higher up, and this, together with the drying up of
the water, enabled us to push along with greater ease and rapidity.
We passed over lightly-timbered and well-grassed country, tolerably
level, with clayey, sandy, and gravelly soil, sometimes one and
sometimes the others, but the same description of herbage and
timber on each. In crossing the stream upon which we camped
on the 16th instant, ?and which we called Mosquito Creek ?but
higher up, my horse got jammed between the banks, and we had
some difficulty in extricating him, the bottom being soft, the
banks steep, and the stream-bed narrow. Shortly after leaving
this place, we came upon our outward track, which was very plain,
and which we followed. Most of the streams which had contained
water when we passed a fortnight since were now dry, and we had
to push on until dusk, when we were fortunate enough to arrive at
the creek known to us as Frying-pan Creek. There was plenty
of water here. We camped on the south bank, and soon found
we were in a mosquito neighbourhood. There was plenty of grass,
but the ground was so stony, that it was a difficult matter to pick
out sleeping ground. However it was not of much consequence,
as the mosquitoes would not let us rest. Mount Lyell bears
north-west, about half a mile distant. This two-peaked hill is
connected at the bottom by rising ground. There is no apparent
difference in the height of the two peaks, looking from our camp
at daylight. Both peaks were composed of bare red rock?either
basalt or trap. After leaving the Glenelg, and not far from its
banks, the ground was covered with lake-coloured everlastings;
further south the everlastings are dark crimson, and near Camden
Harbour pink and white.
April 21th. ?We were all up before daylight, but the horses
had rambled further than usual, and we could not start until
half-past 8. We crossed the Gairdner at 5 minutes past 2, higher
up than on our outward trip, at a gravelly ford. The stream-beds
which we crossed generally contained water, but not so much as
when we passed before; the water was now for the most part in
pools. Camped on the Gairdner. Particularly noticed Mount
Lyell in passing. There are neither trees nor herbage on either
peak, and very little of either on any part of the hill. At its


base there is the usual supply of grass and scattered timber. On
a hill to the north of Mount Lyell we collected some very large
pods of a triangular shape, from a creeper with a thin stalk. The
pods were disproportioned to the size of the stalk, nearly as much
so as a melon is to a melon-vine. They were not quite ripe, but
ripened by keeping, and, bursting open, exhibited a large quantity
of a cotton-like substance, with which the seeds were enveloped.
Encamped at the Gairdner, under the so-called mulberry-tree,
the large dark leaves of which shaded us from the sun. Some of
the ripe fruit dropped, but they were full of maggots. Left the
Gairdner at 20 minutes past 3, and at 5 o?clock halted for the
night on a creek running south, near the largest currant-tree I
have seen. It was loaded with fruit, which we obtained by
cutting down large boughs. We have not seen much game since
leaving the Glenelg. Yesterday we came across two emus, and
to-day saw one kangaroo, and birds called native companions?a
species of heron apparently. They were large birds, and I took
them at first for turkeys. The creek was very bare of water,
which seemed to be drying up fast. The mosquitoes were very
troublesome, as they have been at every place north of the Glenelg
and at our first depot south of that river. Some of the people declared
they were three inches long, but this is not the case. The largest
may be half an inch long. There is no doubt but that they are
great pests, and I do not envy the first settlers of this portion of
Western Australia.
April 28 th. ?We proceeded homewards by 10 o?clock, and
w ere again among those from whom we parted a short time ago,
and who came around to know all about the new country we
had seen.
If the result of our journey is not what w'e hoped, it is not
altogether unsatisfactory. Our knowledge of this portion of the
country has been enlarged, and we have no longer to rely upon
the statements, or to be guided by the opinions, of others. Our
expedition has proved to my satisfaction that the country over
which we travelled, south of the Glenelg, was similar in every
respect to that travelled over by Grey some 15 miles to the
eastward, and the probability is that the intervening country is
of a like nature. Whether it is as rugged and unpromising to
the westward I hope to discover by sending an expedition in that
direction. At the spot where we turned back, which was a few
miles south of Grey?s, and some 10 or 12 miles north of Lushing-
ton?s farthest, the prospect of advancing in our course, on horse-
back, w r as very poor. There was an opening to the westward
which might possibly lead to an outlet from the ranges in a
southerly direction. This will have to be tried. Should the attempt


fail, then horses must be taken as far as practicable, and from this
point parties on foot must explore the ranges.
Should level and fertile country be discovered south of the
ranges, then the hills over which we travelled will not be valueless.
Not only do they admit of stock being driven over, supplying
abundance of feed and water, but the elevation of the land will
render it well adapted for runs upon which to depasture, at certain
seasons, a portion of the stock which at other times feed on the
plains. The land does not of course yield so much grass, even in
the most fertile spots, as in the plains, much of the country from
its nature being unproductive ; yet a limited number of stock may
be kept in good health and condition in the ranges, which, I am
convinced, will become valuable when the low country on either
side is occupied.
I do not consider, nor do those whom I have consulted consider,
that sheep ought to be imported at present. Setting aside all
question of climate, the feed in its present state is not adapted for
sheep, but for large stock only. To bring sheep into this district
would, to say the least, be attended with much risk. Those that
have already been introduced have not done so well as to encourage
the importation of others. lam aware of the force of the argu-
ments employed to show that the fate of the sheep landed at
Camden Harbour ought not to influence speculators. It is said
that they were too young to withstand the effects of a sea-voyage
and a tropical climate, that they were not properly tended, that
they arrived at an exceptional season, that they were depastured
in the neighbourhood of the sea-coast, and so on, I allow all
this, but, at the same time, I do not see any reason for not dis-
couraging the importation of sheep for the present. Whether they
will ultimately succeed, when the feed is cropped down by larger
stock, I cannot tell ?time will show.
For horses, it is the opinion of every one that I have spoken to
on the subject, the country is admirably adapted. The feed is
well fitted for horses, who improve in condition, and they may be
reared in large numbers for markets close at hand.
Whether the feed and climate is adapted for cattle we have had
no opportunity of judging from personal observation, as none have
been imported, but those who have been accustomed to this de-
scription of stock speak highly of the capabilities of the country for
such purpose. One fact appears tolerably clear?that there is no
poisonous plant calculated to affect ruminating animals?or in fact
others, horses doing well?for none of the sheep have died from
the effects of poison. It was supposed, shortly after we landed,
that some of the Government sheep had died from the effects of
poison. 1 did not credit it at the time, and lam now convinced
that no vegetable poison exists. I speak of course only of the
YOL. XXXYI. Q


country near the sea-coasts, where the sheep have been depastured,
but I may add that I have seen nothing in my travels at all
resembling the poison plant of South-Western Australia. What
will be the value of horned stock reared here will depend upon the
progress of settlement. Without a dense population, it appears
to me that their value must be estimated by that of the tallow,
hides, and horns they yield, less the cost of production.
I do not say much respecting the agricultural capabilities of the
country over which we passed, because our course would necessarily
lead us from the low country. I must confess, however, that the
alluvial land on the banks of rivers and streams was of less extent
than I anticipated. Of its richness there can be no doubt But
were the quantity ever so great, it would not promote settlement.
In this climate no white man could till the ground, nor would any
white man be able long to endure the attacks of the insect enemies.
In most parts of Australia these nuisances disappear, or at all
events become less, as settlement extends, but here the nature of
the crop on low alluvial river-side lands would encourage, and not
disperse, the mosquitoes.
If coolie labour is to be employed it will be when pastoral occu-
pations gradually lead to others, and when wealthy speculators
grow articles of commercial value. Rice, cotton, sugar, indigo,
tea, coffee, &c., will not be cultivated by the class of men who
usually emigrate to new countries and form the bulk of the popu-
lation. Except in the event of some extraordinary or exceptional
inducement for immigration, such as gold in large quantities, or
other metals which may be easily worked and transported to the
port of shipment, I do not conceive that the country I have seen
will be the home of a large European population. It is essentially
a pastoral country, and will be permanently settled only by the
extension of pastoral occupation from the southward. It is my
conviction of this fact and my knowledge that establishments have
already been formed along the north-west coast, that make me so
anxious to penetrate the southern barrier which separates this
portion of Australia from the more level country to the southward.
We are now but a comparatively short distance from Roebuck
Bay. When once a pass is found?it is not more than two weeks?
journey from our furthest depot, and an opening once made, ex-
tension of pastoral occupation is but a question of time.
Of the natural resources of the country over which we passed,
lam not qualified to give a scientific opinion. There are many
vegetable productions, which may become, which perhaps are,
valuable in connection with arts and manufactures, medicine, &c.,
but I cannot state the fact with certainty. Of the trees, I may
safely say that for building, for furniture, or even for fencing, but
very few are available, and those in situations which would require


their being consumed on the spot. Some of the timber might be
valuable for turnery and small ornamental work, for it is very
hard and close-grained, but for all domestic and field purposes
wood will have to be imported, especially for the coast settlements
?if any.
On the sandstone ranges there are no indications of mineral
deposits, but at the base of the hills and in the lower valleys,
among the basalt and trap, there are evident signs of much
metallic accumulation. Our time did not permit us to make a
close examination; nor do I think the knowledge possessed by
any of our party was sufficient to render the time profitably
employed which was devoted to mineral researches, I have
mentioned one spot as offering a prospect of gold-discovery, and
also alluded to the specimen of copper-ore brought from the
Glenelg. 1 may likewise state that there was an abundance of
iron ores, some of them very pretty specimens, but otherwise of no
value in a new country.
The health of every member of the party, excepting Mr. Cowle,
who had an attack of incipient fever for two or three days, was
excellent. Not only did cuts and sores, brought with us from
Camden Harbour, rapidly heal, but any damage received en route
from stone or wood, also healed in the course of a few days. Men
and horses both looked as well on their return as when they started.
Even the horses? legs looked healthy, considering the battering
they had received. With fine weather, good water, the absence
of all privation, or even annoyance, except the mosquitoes, a short
trip, and good health, it is no wonder that we were all pleased
with our journey. For my part I have seldom passed a more
enjoyable time than that which I spent during our wanderings
among the sandstones.
XVI. Marine Survey of the Northern Territory of South
Australia. By Mr. F. Howard, Master R.N., to the Governor
of South Australia.
(Communicated by F. S. Dutton, Esq., f.r.g.s.)
On the 13th of May, having embarked the Government Resident
in the surveying schooner Beatrice, we proceeded to ascend the
Adelaide River, it being the intention of Colonel Finniss to explore
the upper part. We arrived at an anchorage about 6 sea miles
above the farthest point reached by the Beatrice last year on
the 17 th.
The same evening we were visited by a party of natives, who
came again the next morning; but on this occasion they were not
Q 2


allowed on board. I did not encourage their visits, as the river
here is very narrow, and the vessel was moored with warps to the
shore on both sides, and we had already seen something of their
pilfering habits. They belonged to the same tribe we had met
before, and with whom the affray at the first camp had occurred.
These natives having been sent away, we saw no more of them
during this trip.
On the 19th, both boats left to explore the upper part of the
river, the Government Resident going in Mr, Guy?s boat. After
proceeding about 15 sea miles above our anchorage, we camped
for the night. As I had to return to the vessel on the following
morning, I pulled up a mile or two farther, the river keeping a
depth of 12 feet, but getting very narrow?not over 20 yards, and
being almost blocked up with snags.
We obtained a good latitude position at our camping-place,
there being three observers, and on the following morning I
returned to the vessel. Mr. Guy and the Government Resident
proceeded towards the head of the river, but were only able to
get about 3 sea miles above our camp in their boat, to a place a
little way beyond where the river forked. They then followed
its winding course on foot 2 miles further south to lat. 12� 56' 15" s.
At this spot the river had dwindled to a running brook 4or 5
yards wide, with deep pools here and there. The country round
was a level open grassy forest of gum, scrub, and paperbark-trees,
the banks of the stream being lined with tall bamboos. The river
would be navigable for a vessel drawing 10 feet, and about 100
feet long, about 3 sea miles above our May anchorage, when she
would be stopped by the first bar of rocks, which are nearly dry
at low water. Beyond this the white-stemmed paperbark-trees
make their appearance, and get more numerous as the river is
ascended, until in the long s.e. reaches, near the upper end, they
are the prevailing feature of the banks, and make the river very
snaggy. In May the water was slightly muddy at the ship and
very good, but a few miles higher it was quite clear. In ascend-
ing the river, and rounding the different reaches, the appearance
of high woody land at the end of nearly every reach was a great
contrast to the dead flat of the lower part of the river.
On the 24th of May I visited a part of the Daly Range, about
a mile north of Fred?s Pass. The view of the country from it
was splendid, the grass in the plains being yet quite green, and
even where lately burnt off springing up again. The hill we were
on had been burnt only a day or two previously, so that it had
a most barren appearance, being composed entirely of masses of
white flinty sandstone, which appeared harder than granite. All
the hills on this range seemed rocky or stony. The summit was
thickly clothed with stunted timber of various kinds and variety


of foliage; on looking to the south-westward, over the range, we
saw that the country continued hilly and thickly wooded as far
as the eye could see. To the eastward stretched an immense plain
dotted over with lines and groves of trees marking the course
of some creek or the river itself?no part of the water of which
could be seen.
On the 25th of May, a small party of natives ?one man and
four boys?came down on the east bank of the river. They
belonged to a tribe we had not seen before. The man, after
some time, ventured on board, crawling along one of the stern
warps, and Mr. Guy succeeded in getting a photograph of him.
This party seemed to understand bartering better than those
farther north.
We weighed the same afternoon, and arrived off Escape Cliff
on the 28th of May. The same morning (28th), we had an
interview with a large body of natives, who mounted in the tall
mangroves to view the schooner as she lay at anchor waiting for
the ebb stream to take her out of the river. Two only swam off
to the vessel, and were afterwards landed in the boat; they had
been on board before, last year.
The Government Resident not being ready to proceed to the
Victoria and coast south-west of Adam Bay for a month, I thought
this a good opportunity to visit the Gulf of Carpentaria, to carry
out orders, and accordingly sailed on the sth of June.
The wind being strong from the eastward and south-eastward,
we had to work to windward along the whole of the north coast
of Arnheirn?s Land, and down the Gulf of Carpentaria to Limmen?s
Bight ?this made it a long voyage. I had expected to make the
passage in ten days, but such was the strength and steadiness
of the wind and current against us, that we did not arrive off
Beatrice Inlet, in the Limmen Bight, until the 20th of June.
We sighted Port Essington and ran along the coast, getting a
view of Port Bremer and Raffles Bay. Port Essington appeared
a dangerous place to approach, Vashon Head and Port Smith
being so much alike; and on our return passage, we nearly ran
on shore attempting to run in after dark, having, as we thought,
made out the entrance plainly at sunset. The land eastward of
Port Essington gradually rises, and seems to improve about
Raffles Bay.
The wind being very strong from e.s.e., we tried to make
a short cut by going through Bowen Straits and crossing Mount
Morris Bay, but after working through all day, we found the
south end entirely blocked up with shoals, and had to anchor off
Croker Island for the night. We had a good view of the west
side of Croker Island, which appeared to be rather stony and
mostly covered with scrub; towards its south end it appeared to


be much higher than the mainland. The Raffles Bay side of
Bowen Straits was densely wooded, without a clear spot, with
good-sized trees, mostly paperbark and white-gum. We had a
visit from three natives who came off from Croker Island in a
small sampan, a boat of Malay build. We hove to for them, as
it was blowing strong. On coming alongside, one of them held
up a fine large fish, saying ?Commander? plainly enough, and
on my making my appearance he presented it at once. This is
the first and only case I have ever seen of a North Australian
native making a present. These people had iron spear-headed
fishing-spears in their boat, ate biscuit and drank coffee eagerly,
and appreciated tobacco and cigars. I did not hear them make
use of any English words, except in repeating them after our
men; but they kept crying out several Malay expressions, apparently
without knowing their meaning. They remained on board nearly
thirty minutes, when we had to send them away and pursue our
voyage.
After leaving Croker Island we had very strong south-east
winds for four or five days, and on the morning of the 12th of
June remained hove-to under our close-reefed mainsail for six
hours. The wind was steady from south-east and generally blew
a fresh gale from midnight to noon, when it usually moderated.
Having to keep outside New Year Island and the adjacent
shoals, we saw nothing of the coast till the afternoon of the 12th,
when we ran into Junction Bay, and came to at 8 p.m. We found
this a more considerable opening than the chart had led us to
expect. The coast was very like the coast of Adam Bay, densely
wooded, and with occasional low red cliffs. Towards the head
of the bay, which we could only see indistinctly, the coast seemed
fringed with mangroves. The flood-stream set to the south-west-
ward from our anchorage (in 11 feet at low water, and about
1 mile off shore) towards a large creek or river falling into the
south side of the bay. We weighed soon after daylight on the
13th, and kept as close along shore as the south-east wind would
allow, passing about 10 miles north of the Liverpool River. This
part of the country appeared to be thickly wooded, and rising
toward the west bank of the Liverpool. From the number of
tires along the coast and inland, I should judge this part of the
coast to be thickly inhabited. At noon of the 14th of June we
sighted Point Dale, and soon afterwards the Wessel Islands.
Working through Bowen Straits, and past the English Company?s
Islands, occupied us till the 16th. These islands, and so much
of the mainland as we could see, appeared rather barren, being
covered with small scrub. Yet, by the fires we saw on shore,
both the above-mentioned groups must be inhabited. Although
it was the middle of June, the climate here was quite humid, and


several showers of rain fell each day?the sky being generally
overcast and cloudy.
The wind still kept against us, so that we did not anchor in
Limmen Bight till the afternoon of the 20th of June, when we
came to in fathoms, about 2 miles north of a small island lying
3 or 4 miles off shore.
After obtaining observations next day, 1 started with Mr. Guy
to explore the various openings in sight along the low mangrove-
shore, commencing with the most southern, as being nearest to
some isolated white rocky hills. This creek (No. 1) was a mere
drain, with mangrove-banks and numerous small branches. We
pulled the boat up until she jammed against the banks each side.
The bottom of the creek was sand and mud. Leaving the boat,
we stepped out into a bare sand-flat, extending to the foot of the
northern isolated rocky lump which we had called Mount Young.
One creek and all its branches expended itself at high-water spring-
tides in flooding the plain across which we walked to Mount
Young.
From the summit of Mount Young we had a good view of the
surrounding country. To the southward and south-west appeared
similar bare rocky hills, shining white in the sun, the more distant
forming a range, thinly wooded. Between this range and the sea
was a thick scrub. Turning to the northward, the country seemed
completely cut up by large creeks running in all directions, one
of which could be traced inland to the horizon, and which I at
once concluded to be the Limmen Bight River.
The coast to the northward seemed thickly covered with low
mangroves for some distance inland, through which ran many
small creeks; inside appeared bare sand-flats, extending to the
north-west as far as we could see, with narrow slips of grassy land
here and there. The whole country in this direction seemed a
dead flat, subject to occasional inundations Our view over the
plains was somewhat obscured by thick clouds of sand, driven
along by the fierce south-east wind, now blowing almost a gale;
so, finding we could do no more with the theodolite, which re-
quired to be held in its place by the legs, and came to grief after
all, breaking a level, we descended as fast as the rocks would allow
us. The natives were firing the country close to the foot of the
hill on the land side, but did not trouble us.
Mount Young and the other hills we afterwards visited are all
composed entirely of the same kind of quartzose sandstone as the
Daly Range on the Adelaide River; and some of the large blocks
were so hard as to beat in the back of my tomahawk without my
being able to make the least impression. In crossing the flats
we noticed numerous tracks of natives, dogs, and emus.
Getting out of No. 1 Creek as quickly as possible, for the sand-


flies were very thick, we sailed round to No. 2 opening, a fine
broad creek, nearly half a mile across, and from 2 to 5 fathoms
deep, and after ascending it for 8 miles, came to for the night at
a place where it seemed to be joined by No. 3 Creek, with an
increase of width. The bottom of No. 2 was either mud or brown
sand, and the only rocks seen were on some small, stony ridges,
from 20 to 40 feet high, and consisted of coarse reddish and
white sandstone. These slight elevations were usually covered
with gum-scrub, whilst the surrounding country was either bare
flooded plains, or grassy, with stunted trees and mangroves, the
soil everywhere light and sandy. This description applies not
only to the soil round No. 2 Creek, but to all the other land we
visited in the bight.
Passing over No. 3 for the present, I shifted the vessel several
miles to the north-west on the 24th, and left for No. 4 Creek,
getting to the head of its main branch the same night. It ended
in a sand-plain at the foot of one of the stony ridges. We went
up as far as the boat would go, and came back 3 or 4 miles,
where we camped for the night. The bottom of this creek was
generally sand; at the upper part the sand was being blown into
the creek off a bare dry plain in considerable quantities.
After descending No. 4 Creek I ran along the coast to the
north-westward as close as the sand-flat bounding the shore would
allow, passing by a low mangrove-covered beach, with several
small high-water creeks up which no boat could have gone, and
on rounding a point came on No. 5 Creek, which seemed pro-
mising, inasmuch as it seemed to me parallel to the coast. I
could not enter, however, as it was entirely harred across, being
just now low water. So we ran on past a flat, grassy country and
sandy beach until we came to Spillen?s Creek, which, being prac-
ticable, we ran, and made our arrangements for passing the night.
Next morning, after the observations requisite for the survey had
been taken, we started up Spillen?s Creek, which appeared to have
an unusual number of branches, the main creek soon became a
mere muddy drain, dry at low water, and with iron-stone pebbles
mixed with its bottom of mud. The land round where there was
an opening in the mangroves was low and sandy, and in places
well grassed.
After leaving Spillen?s Creek we ran along the coast to the
north-west without seeing any opening we could take. Past a
mangrove-point with a sandspit in its north-west side inside,
which appeared to be a creek, but at this time we could not get
near it, the mouth being blocked up by breakers, extending nearly
half a mile off shore. The wind was strong from east, so we
stood along the coast towards some sand-hills, the first we had
seen on this coast. Having effected a landing under the highest


(about 50 feet), I got a good view of the surrounding country
from its summit. The view to the south-east was intercepted a
mile?s distance by tall mangroves, but inland for miles, and round
to a W.N.W. bearing, appeared the bare flats I have before men-
tioned, some dry and with dense clouds of driving sand rushing
over them, others partially flooded. There was a small tea-tree
scrub in shore of the sand-hills with a salt-swamp between, and,
from the presence of a few mimosa-bushes at the foot of the hills,
I expect fresh water could be easily obtained here.
The only break to the dead level of the country in sight was
a small range some 20 miles distant, in a s.s.w. direction, which
I at once called Solitary Range. The coast looked so unpro-
mising that I determined to proceed no further, if I found the
latitude to be north of the fifteenth parallel. So the wind having
fallen, we found our w r ay into Sandhill Creek, where we passed
the night. The mean of my star latitudes on the sandspit coming
as near as possible 15� s., and having had the coast for 3 miles
north-west of it under my eye, I determined to return to the ship,
having had enough for the present of mud and sand-flies. Sand-
hill Creek proved to run in a regular labyrinth of small mud-
drains and mangrove-swamps, dry at low water; and we had some
difficulty in getting out of it.
On our getting well out from the land, I observed the schooner
under weigh, running towards us, Mr. Guy having run down,
thinking we might have some difficulty in getting so far to wind-
ward. We hoisted the boat up, and worked up under the lee
of Maria Island, where we came to in smooth water. The motion
at our former anchorages had been violent, particularly during 1
the ebb tide.
The 28th, 29th, and 30th of June, were spent in surveying
Maria Island, wooding, &c. The island may be described as of
good elevation, with a very stony soil, and covered with brush-
wood. Its rocks were coarse sandstone. In most of the flats
fresh water had lain not long before; and I have no doubt a
strict search would have enabled us to find some at present on the
surface. In one place we found an old canoe, and late tracks of
eight natives, but saw none.
We left Maria Island on the Ist of July; and on the 3rd,
Mr. Guy explored No. 5 Creek, finding it very like all the others,
with a muddy and sandy bottom, in some places mixed with iron-
stone pebbles. Little now remained to be done, viz., to explore
No. 3 Creek, and some of the branches of No. 2, which appeared
to run towards the hills, Mr. Guy performed the former service,
whilst I proceeded up Oyster Creek, which, after running to the
southward 4 miles, and sending off numerous small branches,
became a drain about 6 feet wide between mangrove-banks. As


it was high water we managed to force the boat up to nearly the
end of its course as a running stream. The country here was a
decided improvement on any we had yet seen, though the soil
was still very light and sandy, the grass looks very fine, and
numerous large paperbark-trees were scattered about, up one of
which I got; and, seeing a dry sandy continuation of the creek,
followed it up with a man as fast as I could. This dry bed had
only small salt-water holes here and there. It ran over a sandy
and rocky bed. I knocked up some of the rock, and found it of
the same kind as that which forms Mount Young and the other
hills. Here and there we came on holes filled with crystalized
salt?showing that this part had not been flooded for some time.
Most of the sandstone in the bed of the creek was impregnated
with iron. We saw numerous native-tracks crossing the bed of
the creek. After getting to within half a mile of a stony hill
of the same character as Mount Young, we retraced our steps
as fast as we could, fearing the falling tide would leave our boat
in the present undesirable position for the night. On our way
back I picked up a small water-worn quartz pebble, broken into
four pieces. This was'the only piece of quartz I saw on the
mainland, although I observed some among the rocks on Beatrice
Islet. We had some difficulty in getting our boat down the creek,
the tide having fallen a foot, and managed to stave her, but not
badly; the bottom of this creek had in places ironstone and other
pebbles mixed with the sand and mud.
We camped for the night at the entrance of Cockatoo Creek,
which we ascended next morning; it soon became very narrow
and winding, but a rising tide enabled us to pole the boat to
within a few hundred yards of its end, which we found in a sand-
flat not far from the foot of Mount Young. After again visiting
Mounts Young and Hummock, I returned to the boat and got
on board the schooner the same evening.
Mr. Guy did not get back till the evening of the 6th, having
ascertained the connexion of Nos. 2, 3, and 4 creeks, and that
No. 3 was the main outlet of the Liramen Bight River, which he
followed up in the boat for 16 miles, where it was still nearly
three-quarters of a mile wide. The various creeks he had ex-
plored generally ended in sand-flats, and near the end of one he
came on a fresh-water hole; the bottoms of these creeks were
sand or mud.
Only one native had been seen, though I am sure we were
generally watched, and at Spillen?s Creek the natives had fires
not half a mile from us. On every occasion of going on shore we
kept a good look-out for any traces of white men, but saw nothing
which could lead us to suppose that either the islands or main-
land had been visited.


We had now been absent from Escape Cliflfe for more than a
month, and as Mr. Guy and myself were satisfied with our explora-
tion so far, and that we could gain no more information without
bringing more experience to bear than we felt could be expected,
we determined to get back to Adam Bay as fast as we could.
Had there been time we should have liked to have examined the
coast up to the Roper, and tried to find a navigable entrance to
that river. During our stay in the Gulf of Carpentaria the
weather was cool and bracing, and everybody on board enjoyed
excellent health.
We reached Adam Bay on the 16th of July. On our return,
the Beatrice was at once employed to take a survey party of over
twenty men, their tents, stores, and two months? provisions, up
the Adelaide, at the request of the Government Resident. This
occupied us till the 28th of July. We landed the party higher
up the river than we had before taken the Beatrice ?the object
being to get a good landing-place and camping-place close by.
The river-banks here were rather steep and about 10 feet above
high-water mark; we were about mile below the limit of
navigation for a vessel of our draught of water; the river was
about 40 yards across. We filled up 8 tons of water abreast the
cam p ?baling it up from alongside. It was very muddy for a
day or two, but then became remarkably clear; we have been
using it ever since, and it has always been quite clear and sweet.
From the 28th of July to the sth of August we were employed
busily wooding, painting, repairing sails, and refitting generally,
which was much needed. During this period the natives murdered
Alaric Ward, the shepherd, in the middle of the day, and within
sight and hearing of the camp. The natives had commenced
their depredations two months previously, and had been getting
gradually bolder ?their last exploit being the thorough sacking
of a tent at the Narrows Camp whilst its occupants were in another
tent at breakfast.
The murder of Ward caused great consternation at the camp,
and delayed our sailing for the Victoria some days. We em-
ployed the interval in surveying and sounding out the south
channel through Clarence Straits, which we found to be good,
though narrow, with deep water.
We left for the south-west coast, with the Government Resident
on board, on the 12th of August, the Julia being in company.
We passed by Port Paterson (having before visited it, being
within reach of Escape Cliff at any time by boat), and commenced
our exploration in the bay north of Point Blaze. The morning
of the 14th opening in a thick fog, the Government Resident left
in the Julia to explore the coast close in; and in the afternoon
we followed round the bay in the Beatrice, the coast proving very


low, and fronted with mangroves, and the land inside apparently
swampy for 5 or 6 miles inland.
Blaze Point was a low wooded point, with extensive rocky
ledges extending more than a mile of shore. As the wind feL
light towards sunset, and we began to feel the ebb-stream setting
strong to the northward, we came to off Blaze Point. Weighed
at daylight, and commenced working down the coast outside the
Peron Islands. We only saw the mainland here from a distance;
it was very thickly wooded, and gradually rising towards Channel
Point, where it attained a height of about 80 feet a short distance
inland.
The Peron Islands are sandy, with grassy sandhills along the
west coast, and a grassy peak at the north end of the northern
island nearly 100 feet high. These islands have extensive reefs
and sandbanks off their west sides, running out to a distance of two
or three miles, outside w?hich the soundings are very uneven, and
bottom rocky.
About sunset we brought up in Anson Bay in fathoms, about
3 miles north-west of Cliff Head, and found the flood-stream setting
E.S.E., and ebb W.N.W., during the night, about one knot per
hour. At daylight next morning we observed a large opening in
the low land at the east corner of the bay. Weighed, and stood
towards it, as it had the appearance of a large river; but,
soon getting into 10 feet water had to bear up, and then steered
for Channel Point, which we approached to within 3 miles, when
the water shoaling to 2 fathoms, we again retraced our track,
hauling to the wind and working along shore to the southward,
and always getting into shoal water some distance off the east side
of the bay, till, at 10 a.m., we came to in 11 feet (low water),
Cliff Head bearing s.e. by s. about 2% miles. The Government
Resident then left in the Julia to explore the river, which we
decided to call ? The Daly,? should it prove of any size. The
ebb-tide meeting the Julia in the entrance, they were only able to
get up about 4 miles during the afternoon?the tide being very
strong, although this was the period of neaps. The river at the
Julia's farthest was about 500 yards broad, with 4 fathoms water
at half ebb, and mangrove-banks and in all respects looking very
like the lower reaches of the Adelaide. A long, narrow mangrove-
island divided the entrance, the east channel part, which was the
deepest. Numerous drift bamboos were lodged among the man-
groves, proving the river to come from a long distance inland, and
to be a fresh watercourse.
The shore or coast, between Channel Point and the mouth of
the Daly River, consisted of a dense forest of mangroves, very
high, with small creek-openings here and there. From appear-
ances, I should think that a ship-channel will be discovered, from


the mouth of the Daly running close in to the eastern shore of
Anson Bay, and out to the northward of Channel Point, between
Peron Islands and the main ; although the Beatrice , being on the
west side of the shoals, could not get into it.
Cliff Head is a line of red cliffs, very like Escape Cliff, running
along shore in about a S.S.W. and n.n.e. direction for more than a
mile, and projecting very little, if at all; it is about 50 feet high,
and the land behind rises to a height of about 120 feet, and then
falls gradually; it is thickly wooded. Between Cliff Head and
the Daly River the land is low, with a sandy beach. A sand-flat,
dry at low water, extended off shore about half a mile, along this
part of the coast. Southward of Cliff Head the land became low
and apparently swampy, with mangroves inland behind the beach.
At daylight, on the 17th of August, we weighed and ran to the
southward and south-westward for 9 miles, about 2 miles off shore,
in 3 and 4 fathoms; the coast being very low and thickly wooded,
with several high-water creek-openings. We then came to another
red cliff-point, more deserving the name of head than the last, but
not so high, with a curious flat-topped rock, about half a mile off
shore, outside which we passed at a quarter of a mile distance, in
3 fathoms water. We then continued our course round Anson
Bay, about 1J mile off shore, in 2\ and 3 fathoms. The land
was very low and thickly wooded. From the number of fires
hereabout, 1 should think this part of the country must be thickly
inhabited.
Anson Bay has been described as a fine harbour for shipping,
and free from shoals, and we found the water quite smooth and
holding-ground good, in this season and during the south-east
monsoon ; but from the appearance of the beach, I should think
the westerly monsoon sent a heavy sea into the bay ?a vessel
might even then get temporary shelter by anchoring in the west
corner, under Cape Ford. The east side of the bay appeared
very shoal, and I expect, from December to March, there is a
heavy break the whole distance from South Peron Island to Cliff
Head.
Cape Ford we found to be a long low slim point, instead of the
round flat point it appears on the chart; a ridge of high land runs
south from it, along the coast to the southward. For the first 5
or 6 miles south-west of Cape Ford the coast has a most barren
look, consisting of high, bare sandhills. Clump Point was low and
sandy?a mere long sandspit, with a few low mangroves at its
extremity, and a large clump of the same a little distance back ; a
dangerous covered reef extended some distance south-west of the
point.
Between this point and Cape Dombey, the coast was thickly
wooded; for a few miles south of Clump Point fronted with low


white sandhills, and then with occasional long lines of low reddish
cliffs, under which ran a continuous sandy beach. At the north
point of a shallow bay, about 12 miles south of Clump Point, the
bottom was rocky and soundings uneven, and a rock or ledge
breaking was observed about mile off shore. We anchored
about 8 p.m., a few miles north-west of Cape Dombey, and about
half a mile outside a rocky ledge, marked ? breaking ? on the
chart, but at present standing about 5 feet above water, and 200
or 300 yards in diameter. We next morning proceeded to ex-
amine a bay between Cape Dombey and Port Keats, in which
appeared a large opening on the chart; we found it, however,
entirely closed up by a low mangrove-flat, the only opening being
a very small stream running into the sea at the east end of a long
white cliff, and which had a sand-bar right across it. As we
stood along the south shore of the bay, we observed the land
become lower and looking swampy as we approached Tree Point,
Port Keats, off the mouth of which inlet we anchored for the night.
Next morning, at low water, we saw we were anchored close to
some very ugly-looking rocks, which, together with those off Tree
Point and Cape Hay, would be very dangerous for large vessels
entering. During the afternoon we ran into Port Keats with the
sea-breeze, and anchored 5 or 6 miles inside Tree Point. The
shores of Port Keats looked exceedingly low and swampy, the
only high land visible being Mount Goodwin to the southward ;
the navigable part of the port is narrow, extensive shoals running
off on each side; there is a sandy point and low cliff just inside
the west entrance point, but all the rest of the shore is mangrove.
The Government Resident proceeded to the head of the port in
the Julia , and found one or two landing-places ; the land, however,
was very barren and stony.
We sailed from Port Keats on the morning of the 20th of
August, and after rounding the extensive shoals off Cape Hay,
steered for Point Pearce, north-west of which we anchored at 8
p.m. The coast between the above points appears nearly straight,
with sandhills and cliffs in several places. At our anchorage,
north-west of Point Pearce, in 17 fathoms, the ebb-and-flow
stream ran north and south more than 3 knots per hour.
At 1 p.m. on the 21st we weighed with the first of the flood,
and a light north-west breeze, and steered for the Victoria River.
We tried to pass over Mermaid Spit, but the strength of the tide
prevented us. At dusk we came to in 8 fathoms, having regu-
lated our course by sextant angles of the distant hills to the east-
ward, and at low water next morning finding we had made a very
lucky hit, being right in mid-channel between the sand-heads.
Point Pearce had been out of sight for three hours, and I am
afraid the weather is but seldom clear enough to allow of its being


seen from the sand-heads, and used as a leading mark. The dry
sands had somewhat shifted and altered their shape since surveyed
in 1840. At our anchorage the tidal streams set n.w. by w. and
s.e. by e., about 4 knots per hour, and rather too much across the
channel to be pleasant. At 1 p.m. on the 23rd we weighed with
the first of the flood, and a very light wind from north-east, which
gradually hauled round by north to south-west.
Ihe afternoon turned out very dull and misty, and brought out
the dangers of the navigation. After passing the north-west end
of Quoin Island, the tide seemed determined to set us out of the
right channel, so that our proper course being about south, we had
to steer west and north-west to keep our position. Here the water
became quite calm and as smooth as glass, though a good breeze
was blowing aloft, giving us 4 or 5 knots' way through the water.
We had been able hitherto to fix our position by angles and
bearings to table and fossil hills, and part of McAdam Range,
but they now became miraged, and presented a continuous level
surface. Quoin Island and the low land on the west side of the
river disappeared altogether, even from the masthead, though we
knew they were only two or three miles off on either side. Luckily
River Peak hove in sight, and the north end of Quoin Island was
lifted, so that we saw it a distance of 12 miles. After getting a
few shoal easts of 'l\ fathoms, we anchored between Observation
Island and the mainland in 7 fathoms, and about 1 mile off the
latter. Here the flood-stream ran at least 6 knots per hour. The
position of Observation Island we never made out either going up
or coming down the river : it must be very low.
Next morning we had a fine breeze and clear weather, and
could make out all the hill-marks, and the place where the river
enters the range, and the mangrove-shore on each side presented a
very narrow green line. The flood-tide then running enabled us
to work up to Blunder Bay, where we came to in 5 fathoms, just
as the tide turned. As the schooner was out of the strength of
the tide here, and the anchorage seemed good, she was to stop
here in preference to Holdfast Reach, where we might, like the
Beagle , lose our anchors. At Blunder Bay. we were completely
surrounded by hills, most of them looking quite bare, and covered
with immense rocks; and though some of the hills to the eastward
were well- wooded, a near approach showed the timber to be small,
and the hills all rocks and stones.
Taking advantage of the flood, the Government Resident and
myself started up the river the same evening in the Julia and gig.
We reached Black Point, and brought up for the night at 9 p.m.
Several natives made their appearance in Blunder Bay before we
started, and as we passed Holdfast Bay the country was on fire on
both sides of the river, and the boats were hailed by the natives.


We were prepared to be alarmed at Whirlpool Reach, it being
now spring-tides, but being accustomed to the narrows of the
Adelaide River, to us Whirlpool Reach seemed hardly to deserve
its name, and we felt rather disappointed.
Next morning we proceeded up the river with a fresh south-east
wind, and made good progress. The scenery was certainly very
striking, but the rugged, barren ridges did not look well for a
settlement. We saw the gouty-stem trees for the first time when
rounding the high rocky point north of Shoal Reach, in which reach
the Julia had her first little difficulty with some shoals, but soon
got clear with the rising tide. As we advanced along the next
reach, which trended e.n.e., the country seemed to improve; the
sandstone ridges on the north side, though very broken and pre-
cipitous, were clothed with grass, and the south side of the river
was low grassy land, gradually rising. We landed up a small
creek on this side and walked about half a mile inland. The
country was covered with small timber and well grassed. This
being the dry season the grass was all withered, but looked of a
finer quality than that on the Adelaide.
We passed Mosquito Flat at high water and so got over the
shoals, but with barely enough water for the Julia; and after
getting a little bothered among the banks off the mouth of the
large creek, east of Curiosity Peak, we came to in 2 fathoms,
close to a detached hill, south-west of the Dome.
The cliff on the chart close to our anchorage is merely a per-
pendicular earthy bank, about 6 feet above high water. During
the afternoon I went up the adjacent hill, about 600 feet high ; it
is long, very narrow, and with high cliffs surrounding its summit.
I had a good view over Mosquito Flat and the Whirlwind Plains;
the former was a mere mangrove-swamp, with some grassy land
inside toward the foot of the hills; several creeks intersected the
flat and drained it, and the dry part had very evident water-marks
across the surface. A rise of a few feet only would send a stream
across the flat, from the Victoria; former marks showing that the
water would come in between Dome and the hill we were on.
Turning toward Whirlwind Plains, the part nearest us seemed
very little above high-water mark, but the country having been
lately burned, the grass looked green and pleasant; beyond 3or
4 miles the plains presented the appearance of a dense scrub,
which appeared to extend to the south-east as far as the next
range. The hill on which we were was nearly devoid of vegeta-
tion, except on its summit, which was flat, and at each end of
sufficient width to grow some small trees and a few tufts of grass ;
just under the perpendicular cliffs round the summit were some tall
fan-palms. The flood tide seemed to have some difficulty in
getting past the shoals off Mosquito Flat, for we did not get it till


2 p.m. next day, when we started, and passing along the foot of
sea range, opened out on the long reach through which the
Whirlwind Plains run, down which we proceeded about 3 miles,
when we came to. The plain at the foot of the sea range was low,
and covered with coarse grass very like that on the lower plains of
the Adelaide; on the opposite side of the river was a long earthy
or sand cliff crowned with an open scrub of small white-stemmed
gum-trees.
The general appearance of the Whirlwind was very
different from what I had expected; instead of open prairie-land,
covered with grass and with hardly a tree in sight, wherever I
landed, which I did repeatedly, I found myself in what I should
term an open grassy forest; the timber of which it was composed
being almost invariably the peppermint-gum common in South
Australia; the greatest height which it attained here seemed about
40 feet. The soil was of a deep brown colour and sandy nature,
and getting much lighter in colour beneath the surface. The
above description does not apply to more than half a mile inland
from the river on either side, as I did not go beyond that distance
at any time, and the wood was too thick to see more than 200
yards? distance.
The river, in the long reach, was about 300 yards wide, and
with scarcely any tidal stream, and about 2 feet rise. The east
side was generally cliffy, showing the nature of the soil very well,
and the west bank was fringed with a narrow, even wall of man-
grove-scrub about 15 feet high. Several very large gouty-stem
trees grew on the bank. On cutting into one with an axe, I found
the interior very soft and juicy, or spongy, and quite white. I got a
very good drink by sucking and chewing a large piece. It tasted
like the juice of a ripe cocoa-nut. We obtained some of the fruit,
which was the size of an emu?s egg, with a green skin like that of
a quince, but quite hard, and about a tenth of an inch thick, inside
which was a solid white spongy mass, quite dry and full of seeds
?this had a sweetish taste. I have no doubt this fruit is very
good if gathered when just ripe ; but those we got were evidently
last year?s, all the trees being without a vestige of foliage. Stokes
says too, they were in blossom in November. The plains near the
river seem much cut up by watercourses in all directions.
Nearly opposite the cone ?White Cliff? on Stokes?s chart of
the river, is a pebbly point behind which we came on a creek,
which, from the trees growing in its bed, must run with fresh
water in the rainy season?some of the men found a little. The
white cliff opposite appears to have obtained its name from the
grass growing down its face, which at this time of year would
appear quite white by moonlight; but where it had been burnt
off this cliff was exactly like the others; several pieces of lime-
VOL. XXXYI. R


stone were picked up hereabout. Sandy Island has a long pebbly
spit off its south end, on which several of the men picked up some
very pretty pieces of stone. As we advanced up the river the
banks seemed to get higher, and, for some miles before the
Whirlwind Plains cease, were nearly 50 feet high.
On the 26th we left Whirlwind Plains and again were pulling
along between hills; they were very stony, but covered with grass
and wooded with peppermint. At 8 P.M., whilst towing the
Julia, we both came suddenly on a ridge of rocks, and, after
getting clear, came to for the night; we were about 2 miles below
Steep Head. On the morning of the 27th I landed on the south
bank, and was surprised to find the watercourses full of limestone
lumps, and afterwards to see the soil covered with small pieces of
the same. I walked across the plain to the foot of the hills?dark
sandy soil, with a variety of*stones, including some large pieces of
red jasper; the grass was thick, and, apparently, of very good
quality. The country had not the cracked appearance of the
Adelaide, but the rain seemed to collect in watercourses and drain
off into the river.
After breakfast we succeeded in getting the Julia about half
a mile further up, when she again struck, so, seeing it would be
useless to attempt to get her any higher, the Government Resident
came into the gig, and, in company with the Julia s dingy, started
for as far up as we could get.
Steep Head soon came in sight, its black face composed of
laminated sandstone placed in horizontal strata. After landing to
examine it, we proceeded for a short distance to where we came to
a series of rocky bars extending nearly half a mile, over which we
dragged the boat, and came into a fine deep reach, where the
water was only slightly brackish, and a little rain higher up would
make quite fresh. We pulled on through a reach about 100
yards broad, and looking like some of the upper reaches of the
Adelaide, but wider. We pulled past an island, which leaves only
a very narrow channel, just wide enough for the oars on its north
side, and soon afterwards had to stop at what we supposed to be
Palm Island ?the river here coming to an abrupt termination as
a continuous stream. The water here was quite fresh, so we filled
all our breakers, the dingy also filling those she had brought
from the Julia. The bar across the river here was composed of
shingle, some of the stones being of large size. A number of
trees grew in the bed of the river, mostly tea-trees, some of large
size, also plenty of palms and small scrub. Most of the tea-trees,
though of large size, were inclined at an angle of 45� with the
water, in the direction of the stream, showing a powerful rush of
water at certain times. I went on to the next reach, separated
from the lower water by a bar about 30 yards across, composed of


rock and shingle, and had a quiet bathe some distance up, though
not without some fear of alligators, as we had seen one just outside.
The last reach reminded us very much of the Adelaide, having
the same kind of willow-like paperbark or tea trees overhanging
the stream ; the palms and reeds also seemed to be exactly the
same. We saw, however, no bamboos in the whole course of the
Victoria to this point; the land here, too, was much cut up by
watercourses ; the hills came close to the river and were very high
and remarkable in form, steep and rocky, but covered with grass.
We returned to the Julia in the evening after a little difficulty
in getting the boat over the rocky bars. Some of the men
thought the water had fallen a few inches, but I could see no
difference, except that the boat w r as deeper by 30 gallons of water.
The stream was running down over the stones at 9 A.M., and
the same at 4 p.m.
On the morning of the 28th we started down the river with a
fresh south-east breeze, and this being the first fair wind we had
had, we made good progress. Nothing of interest occurred until
2 p.m., when on entering the Mosquito Flat Reach, and appa-
rently in the centre of the channel, the Julia went on shore. The
river had evidently been shoaling up since Captain Stokes? survey,
as he had one fathom marked at low water, where we walked
about quite dry at half tide; in fact, before we left, it was possible
to walk right across the Victoria here at half tide from Mosquito
Hat to within about 100 feet of the south shore without getting
wet feet?myself and many others did it. Close to the south
shore, however, existed a narrow channel of from 3 to 5 feet water,
at low-water neaps. This, however, is the channel of the Wickham
Creek, and at low-water springs can have no connection with the
Victoria Proper. After we left her, each tide got lower, until
the flood never reached her at all, and she was left high and dry
during a whole day; showing that only the spring-tides reach
above Mosquito Flat. On our arrival on board, on the 31st, with
the Government Resident, I sent Mr. Guy up to the Julia with a
good supply of fresh water, and was very glad to see both boats
back on the evening of the 3rd of September. A stiff sea-breeze
had sent up a high tide the previous day, and enabled the Julia
to float off.
During the absence of the boats, the schooner had experienced
very hot dry winds from south-east, causing leaky decks, &c.; in
fact, the same winds that blew cool to us up the river, having to
come over many miles of hot burning naked rocks, became heated
to almost the temperature of an Adelaide hot wind. Two or three
cases of fever had occurred on board, and my boat?s crew and self
suffered from sore eyes, which soon got well when we got outside.
We had been able to get a plentiful supply of very good firewood
R 2


from Entrance Island?a sort of resinous pine, with hard sound
wood of a teak colour. This leads me to remark that the man-
groves of the Victoria River are mere brush generally, not growing
to a height of over 6 feet, and of no use whatever as firewood.
The writer of the ? Handbook of the Northern Territory? must
have been thinking of the Adelaide River, where the mangroves
grow tall and straight like pines, and to a height of 80 and 100
feet without a branch, when he mentions the mangrove-forests at
the mouth of the Victoria; the fact being that the said forests are
hardly visible from a ship?s deck at 4 miles? distance. I have
generally found that sand kills off the mangrove-trees altogether, and
from its mouth to Palm Island the banks of the Victoria are sandy.
Asa navigable river, I consider the Adelaide to be far superior
to the Victoria. In the former, a vessel of the size and draught
of the Beatrice can ascend nearly 80 miles, into fresh water, with
perfect safety. In the Victoria, the same vessel could not get
much farther than Holdfast Bay, without great risk ; and Mosquito
Flat, at this season, is not passable by large boats except at spring-
tides. There is a great difference in the soil of the two rivers, the
Adelaide being clayey and muddy, and the Victoria sandy. Ido
not pretend to have any idea as to which is the best for this
climate, but the land about the Victoria certainly looks the best,
that is, above Mosquito Flat. I notice one great difference:
whereas the water which falls on the plains of the Adelaide
appears to remain stagnant, until dried up by the sun or filtered
through the soil, the rainfalls on the Whirlwind Plains, and above
them, seems to run at once off in violent torrents ?which cause the
numerous small but deep watercourses I have spoken of before.
On the morning of the 4th of September, we ran from Blunder
Bay, with a fair wind, in company with the Julia, and got as far
as the point off Forsyth Creek. The same evening, the tide
having risen 22 feet, the Julia left us to make the best of her way
back to Escape Cliff, the Government Resident going on with us
to Timor.
XVll.? Notes on the West Coast of Madagascar. By Captain
J. C. Wilson, r.n.
The Island of Madagascar is little known except through the
excellent works written by the Rev. Mr. Ellis; and in those
works we find but slight mention of the western coast, which I
purpose to form the subject of this paper.
From the geographical position of the island, lying as it does
across the trade-winds, the climate and general features of the
east and west sides materially differ. The west is peopled by the
Sacalava tribes, who may be looked upon as quite as distinct a
