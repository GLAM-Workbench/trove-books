PREFACE.
In presenting the following pages to the Public, the Author desires to
express his deep sense of obligation to the Honourable the Premier, to
the various Heads of Departments, and to other Government Officials, who
have at all times so courteously acceeded to requests for information ;
also to the Editorial Staff of the various metropolitan and country
newspapers (from which much valuable matter has been culled), and
to all the authorities quoted.
It is hoped that the information contained herein, which has been
carefully collated both from personal knowledge and the most reliable
authorities—official and private—will prove useful alike to visitors
from other lands and to residents who possibly lack time or opportunity
to consult the voluminous and, in some cases, expensive works referred
to. At the same time the limits of the “ Guide” were such that the
efforts of the Author have rather been directed towards the consideration
of the leading Resources and Industries, than to the production of an
exhaustive description of the colony in all its features—or to the
repetition of much of the “ useful information” which already exists
in a popular form.
It has been found impossible in some cases to give figures for
1896; still, wherever practicable, these have been furnished, and in
many cases supplemented by those of even later date.
Notwithstanding that every endeavour has been made to prevent
inaccuracies, it is possible that errors may have crept in, and the
Author desires to thank —by anticipation—any of the Readers of the
Guide who may draw attention to these, should such occur.

INTRODUCTORY.
IN the statistics of Queensland is found matter for deep reflection
and—in the main—much encouragement, as evincing the past
productiveness and enormous possibilities of our Natural Resources.
When it is seen that in less than fifty years we have increased our
exports from £72,000 odd—the product of the then convict settlement of
Moreton Bay—to £8,982,600 (1895); that, since the separation of
Queensland from New South Wales in 1859 (when the population of
the former was about 25,000) we have increased over eighteen fold;
that amongst Australasian Colonies we take the lead in sugar pro*
duction—second place in pastoral matters and gold production, and third
place in point of size ; when to all this is added the fact that our Colony
was the last one of the group to whom legislative independence has been
accorded, the mind can but vaguely conjecture the enormous possibilities
which lie before us. Next to Western Australia this colony has the most
extensive coast line of any of the divisions of Australasia, it being
some 2,200 to 2,500 miles in extent, thus affording unlimited facilities for
international commerce in the varied products of the interior.
Whilst more generally explored than the large colonies of Western
Australia and South Australia, Queensland possesses in the far interior
potentialities for wealth which are unknown to the average colonist
certainly undreamed of by the rest of the wo-rld.
Artesian bores —upon a modest estimate yielding a total daily flow of
193,187,240 gallons—have already changed the aspect of life in the
western country, and will prove an important factor in the close settlement
of some of the most fertile of our land, of which the chief drawback
has hitherto been an irregular water supply.
The total acreage of the colony is 427,838,080, of which only about
one-thirtieth part (viz.: 14*142,502 acres) is alienated, or in course of
alienation, besides 271,271,312 acres which are held under lease;
constituting an effective area of 285,413,814 acres, which shows an
unappropriated area of 142,424,266 acres for pastoral and agricultural,
occupations. Geographically considered, Queensland extends from S. lat.
28° jB' tp lat. 10° 30', and from E. long. 153° 30' to 138° and is thus
abopt equally divided on the map by the tropic of Capricorn. Outside the
tropical Upe the most perfect climatic conditions may be met with,
,1* • P


whilst practically the whole of the colony may be said to be healthy and
•eminently adapted for a white population —as shown by the vital statistics
of the year 1895, which give a death-rate of only 11.38 per 1,000
(taking the third lowest place—with Tasmania —in Australia) far l >wer than
that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which stands
at something like 21.00 per 1,000 persons, or that of Europe generally,
the mean average of which is much higher still. In this connection may be
mentioned the very high birth rate as compared with that of the adjacent
colonies, being 32.85 per 1,000 (1895) against 30.61 per 1,000 in New
South Wales—the next in order of precedence.
These are mighty factors in the prosperity of any. State, a prosperity
which in the case of Queensland is largely evinced by the high marriage
rate for the same year, viz. : 6.23 (couples) per 1,000. By comparison
with the rates of the other six Australasian colonies, it will be seen that
we take third place ; Western Australia for obvious reasons coming first,
with 6.83 per 1,000, and New South Wales coming second with 6.35.
When it is remembered that the latter colony has now been established 108
years, or three times as long as our own, inducing a stability largely
tending to an entrance into the marriage state (although she no longer
Bolds the premier position in that respect, as in 1893-4) it must be con-
ceded that Queensland can hold her own with any country in the world—
age being taken into consideration. I have stated that the area of the
'Colony is equal to something under one and a half square miles per
head of population; whilst New South Wales has one inhabitant to each
■quarter of a square mile, and Victoria has rather more than thirteen
inhabitants per square mile. Assuming therefore, that in point of
productiveness (as is shown by intercolonial statistics), we are not far
behind these last mentioned colonies, there is room, and to spare, for from
Two million to eight million new comers !
Stupendous as has been the progress of some of the older colonies, our
T 895 Returns show that amongst Ahe colonies we take third place in
The matter of exports. In relation to population, this amounts to £l9
16s. 9d. per head, a figure considerably over those for New South Wales
and Victoria; indeed, with the single exception of South Australia,
(including Northern Territory) we are admittedly the largest exporters per
head of population, and only need an increased population to out-distance
all the other colonies. Speaking of South Australia, a glance at the
figures discloses the fact that in 1894 the exports exceeded imports by
J 61,203,148, whereas in, the case of Queensland the excess of exports
over imports in 1895 reached the substantial sum of £3,884,792 (the
imports per head being £ll 16s. 3d.) which somewhat discounts the
position held by South Australia as heading the list of exports per
•cap.! Our own import* per cap. for the same year were all but the


lowest of the group—thus proving conclusively our superior ability
to support a large population.
Apart from figures, however, a trip through Queensland is suffi-
cient to convince the most sceptical of her vast resources and climatic
advantages over many a field for emigration which, at present, is at the
zenith of public favor. The colony extends northward from the bound-
ary of New South Wales 1300 miles (exclusive of the possession of British
New Guinea), towards the maintenance of which Queensland is a contribut-
ing colony), and westward from Point Danger (at S.E. extremity) some
950 miles to the South Australian border, and embraces every variety of
tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate climatic conditions. The danger to
life from wild beasts which are common in many parts of the United
States, Canada, South Africa, &c., are here unknown—the reptiles alone
being at all troublesome, and that over a small extent of country. With
very few exceptions, life and property are as secure as in Great Britain,
and the few remaining blacks (aboriginal) are so outnumbered by the
white population, whilst most of them have become reconciled to their
altered conditions, that they do not afford the slightest menace to the
public safety. Wool, gold, and meat export have been the main indus-
tries of the past, but the production of sugar is increasing at a marked
rate—there being an enormous quantity of land adapted to the giowth of
this crop—and dairy farming, combined with mixed farming, promises to
play an important part in the not distant future.
Queensland has been styled the “ lazy nian’s paradise we prefer to
state that it is a poor man’s —as well as a rich man’s—country. With
capital and labour going hand in hand, there is no country in the World
which would respond more readily to the energy of man, and we have the
proof of the assertion in what has been accomplished in the short space of
37 years’ independence ! I have shown that our exports now total nearly
£9,000,000 per annum, and it is worthy of note that of this sum over
£8,000,000 is contributed by the four first mentioned staple products, in
the following order :
Wool £2,986,989
Gold 2,272,109
Meat and allied products ... ... 2,079,166
Sugar 796,117
On the other hand, the local production of many articles—for which
the conditions of soil, climate, &c., &c., have been proved to be admirably
suited—has fallen far short of the demand, necessitating a large import.
This condition of things is, in a measure, due to want of agricultural and
industrial enterprise, and partly to lack of population to support some of
the larger industries ; such as : —paper mills, iron works, powder mills, oil


mills, and perfumeries; in very few cases is it due to the want of the raw
material. It will thus readily be seen that Queensland offers the widest
scope for capitalist and agricultural labourer, the following being some of
the more important items in the imports during the year 1895 :
Manufacture of metals (including machinery, hardware, &c.) £684,758
Soft goods ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1,096,258
Bags, sacks, woolpacks, twine, &c. ... ... ... ... 98,000
Chemical products ... ... ... ... ... ... 168,025

Rice ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 35,643
Flour and cereals ... ... ... ... ... ... 877,030
Green fruit, seeds, plants, and vegetables ... ... ... 122,381
The proportion of the above which might be produced in this colony
can be safely valued at £2,000,000, and their production would not only
afford the means of living to a further population of 20,000, at the least,
but would in turn largely stimulate existing industries, by the accession
of persons to the colony.
Speaking generally, the reward of labour is greater than in the older
countries of the world, for .whilst a period of universal depression has
temporarily affected wages, it has also effected a reduction in the cost
of necessaries; increasingly liberal land laws, improved agricultural
methods, and a genial climate, combining to make the struggle for life less
hard here than elsewhere —especially to those who are engaged in the
pursuit of agriculture. As instancing the way in which these advantages
are becoming recognised, the latest official returns place the area under
cultivation at 299,278 acres—an increase of 47,208 acres, or nearly one-
sixth, upon that of 1893.
But what a small area is this when compared with the vast area of
agricultural land still imappropriated ! The total agricultural and grazing
farm land open to selection at the close of 1895 amounted to 10,289,683
acres (of which 455,103 acres were made available in the same year—
strictly for agricultural occupation), and in the early part of 1896 over
83,000 acres of the finest land in the colony —well watered, in close
proximity to markets, and with the best of railway facilities—were thrown
open to selection upon the most liberal terms.
It has been seen that home consumption will, in some directions,
absorb a considerably greater output than we can at present claim, but it
is as an exporting colony that we shall eventually take the lead, and we


are already turning our attention in that direction—as previously shown.
Our strength does not lie so much in our size, as in the wonderful fertility
of soil, range of climate, and antipodeal relation to the big markets of the
world. The size is beyond the grasp of the average visitor—being about
twice that of Canada, five and a-half times that of Great Britain, twelve
times the size of England and Wales together, and one hundred and ten
times that of the largest county in England, viz., Yorkshire.
As regards fertility of soil, enough cannot be said ; the mean average,
return per acre for some of our crops being as follows :
Wheat ... 15-89 bus. as compared with New York State yield of
14-86 average for J of a century.
Barley ... 18-72 bus. as against New York mean average of 22-88.
Maize ... 24-85 bus. as against New York mean average of 80-73.
Rice ... 36-45 bus. as against average in India of some 26 bus.
Rye ... ... 20-73 bus. as against New York mean average 13-67.
Potatoes ... 2-37 tons as against New York mean average about 2 tons.
Cotton 181 lbs. clean cotton per acre —same in United States, America.
Sugar 1-69 tons per acre of cane (about 1-50 tons in New South Wales).
Tobacco ... 8-77 cwt. dried leaf per acre, as against United States—
mean average of cwt.
Hay ... ... 1-93 tons as against New York mean average of 1-19.
Without here quoting the yield obtained from other crops, sufficient
variety has been shown to demonstrate both the fertility of our farms and
the wide range of products which result.
Seeing that we can show a better return 'per acre of wheat, rye,
potatoes, tobacco, and hay than obtains in the United States (where the
use of fertilizers is largely practised), a higher yield of rice than in India,
as well as a heavier crushing of sugar than in New South Wales, and a
very close approximation in other crops to average yields of the world, we
think our confidence in our Natural Resources is not misplaced.
Whilst on the subject of export, it may be of interest to examine the
following list of British imports during 1895, supplied by the courtesy of
the Under-Secretary for Agriculture, as showing the very large opening
there is in Great Britain for some of the above products, and many more
which may be profitably produced here :

And here I would like to refer to the peculiar advantages enjoyed by
Australia in general, and Queensland in particular, owing to the fact that
our winter (not very severe, at any time) occurs at the same time of year
as the European summer, and vice versa , a circumstance of the greatest
moment to exporters, producers, and the population generally. Thereby
we are enabled to find a ready market abroad for surplus products at
times when prices here are usually low, to relieve and steady the local
market throughout the year, and by the betterment of the producer to


effect an increase in wages generally. Perhaps the most promising
industry, if this advantage in respect of seasons be availed of, is that of
butter and cheese making. The local butter supply of Europe, North
America, and—it may be said—a large portion of Asia, is, at certain
seasons of the year, owing to climatic drawbacks, very far short of the
demand, and a practically limitless market is thus at one season of the
year, or another, open to products of the best quality only. Indeed, in
some countries—such as Japan—there is reason to believe that a per-
manent market may be secured. The high percentage of butter fat
yielded by the milk of our well kept herds ; the immense area of dairying
country which we have —as compared with New South Wales and Victoria;
the extensive educational process which is going on under the direction of
our Department of Agriculture ; and the spread of the “ factory system”
—largely due to the encouragement afforded by the Government in the
way of assistance to build factories for the manufacture of cheese and
butter should place us in a position to overtake our home consumption
and make a name in the world’s markets above that even of Victoria
(which contributed, in 1894, a total of 9,519 tons 18 cwt. to the British
market). Already a number of cold storage depots have been erected by
the enterprise of Government and others ; refrigerating cars are now
available for the conveyance of perishable products on the railway, and a
bonus of Id. per lb. of butter on shipment (with a further sum of Id. per
lb. at the close of the year, should funds permit), is paid by the Govern-
ment ; a trial shipment of tons was made under Government super-
vision in February, 1895, and realised a fair price in the London market.
At the time of writing, a further shipment of upwards of 60 tons is being
made under the supervision of the Agricultural Department.
Eggs form another item which is of interest in relation to export.
At a time when but 3d. to 6d. per dozen can be realised here, owing to
the bountiful supply—say November to February—-a ready market is
available in Great Britain for a few million dozen at 9d. to Is. per dozen.
Shipping facilities are now offered b} the British India direct line of
steamers between Queensland and Great Britain—specially fitted with
cold storage—the climate is eminently adapted to the raising of poultry
for laying and for the table, and enterprise and moderate capital are alone
needed to establish a most profitable industry.
Maize, honey, a variety of fruits, &c., would find a good market in
Europe if exported under favorable conditions ; indeed, the prices realized
on trial shipments have been sufficient to justify the conclusion that the
study of requirements of those markets as regards quality, and time of
shipment, will lead to a large trade between this colony and the home
markets.


Take, for example, the encouraging results attained by the neigh-
bouring colony of Victoria in shipments of fruit. These arrived mostly in
first-class condition, the growers were rewarded by a gross return in the
London market of 10s. to 14s. per case of apples, and 7s. or Bs. for pears.
Wet and over-ripe lots fetched 4s. to Bs. 6d. per case.
In addition to the above, the consignors received a bonus of 2s. per
case from the Victorian Government, which may be taken as covering
cost of packing, freight, and selling charges.
No shipments of green fruit appear to have been made as yet to the
European market from our colony, principally from the fact that our
surplus at present finds a profitable market in the adjoining colonies—to
which we consigned in 1895, 871,105 pkgs. of the value of £58,555 ;
besides a few experimental shipments of preserved pineapples—value
about £lOO. Of the latter, a few cases were sent to the United Kingdom.
With the advent of Mr. Benson—fruit expert to the Department-of Agri-
culture —fresh interest and energy have been infused into the realisation
of this valuable national asset, and Queensland may look forward to
shortly receiving a very substantial increase to her. revenue from this
source.
Before, however, this can be the case, there is ample scope for the
fruitgrower in the supply of local requirements, 225,426 packages of the
value of about £67,000 having been imported in 1895. And the sole
reason for the loss of this sum to our colony is the want of fruitgrowers.
The quality and variety of fruits which we have been and are now producing
cannot be excelled in Australia, yet the latest returns give our fruit-grow-
ing area as being only about 9,200 acres, besides 8,189 acres of gardens
and orchards, a mere fraction of that of the Southern Colonies. Experi-
mental shipments of Queensland honey have been made to London, and
expert opinion goes to show that, when initial prejudices have been
overcome on the other side, and shippers here have realized the high
standard of excellence and the uniformity of quality exacted by the home
markets, a grand opening exists there for hundreds of tons per annum.
In bountiful harvests the price of maize (corn) has occasionally
fallen very low, and upon one of these occasions a trial shipment was
made to Great Britain. Although not financially a great success, this de-
parture was by no means a failure. The good condition of the grain
upon arrival demonstrated the fact that, with the introduction of better
agricultural appliances, improvements in shipping methods, and lower
freights—all our surplus might be profitably disposed of in Great Britain
alone (of which the annual import is something like one ancl three-quarter
million tons) and, by relieving'the market here, that a good return might
he secured to the grower all the year round.


Onions, similarly, have been shipped from Melbourne (Victoria) as
general cargo, reaching London in good condition—although, owing to the
shipment leaving at the wrong time of year, a glutted market had to be
encountered, and the consignment was not as profitable as would have been
the case under more favourable conditions. This item offers the widest of
fields for the Queensland farmer, as not only is a way being opened up for
future export by the enterprise of our neighbours, but—first and foremost
—the present production is some 3,055 tons below our annual consump-
tion, and the local grower is supported by an import duty of 25% —equiv-
alent to at least 20/ per ton. The quality of onions grown here leaves
nothing to be desired ; in fact, the writer has seen specimens of several
varieties raised in the vicinity of Brisbane by European growers which
will bear comparison with those of any land. Before leaving the subject
of export, we may mention that the sale of South Australian wines is now
being pushed in London, and there seems to be no reason why our own
Colony which has produced some excellent vintages should not follow suit
in this matter. Not only is the consumption of imported wine in the
United Kingdom very large, being of the value of £3,000,000 to
£4,000,000 per annum, but dried fruit in the shape of currants and
raisins were imported by that country to the aggregate value of £1,660,000
in 1895 alone, and it is most satisfactory to note that a move is being
made in our own Colony towards what should eventually prove a most
important export industry. Grapes, Apricots, Apples, Peaches, Figs,
Plums, &c. are prolific growers in Queensland, and fairly large quantities
are already produced in the Southern and Western districts, which
would often yield a better return in the dried state, than when fresh.
Single shipments of dried fruits from oversea countries to Australia have
reached the high figure of 4,000 tons—valued at £120,000 —of which the
bulk might have been grown and dried here. The neighbouring Colony
of Tasmania is already engaged in the industry, and South Australian
enterprise has also taken up this matter ; it now rests with ourselves to
show that we will not take the back place in a trade for which our climatic
and topographical conditions are so well suited. In the Huon district
of Tasmania a Mr. Robt. Harvey has at work four evaporating machines
of a capacity of 50 bushels of dried fruits per day ; whilst at the establish-
ment of Messrs. Hardy and Sons Limited, of McLaren Vale, near
Adelaide (S.A.) sixty tons of currant grapes were prepared during the
1896 vintage, and 1,700 tons of grapes were converted into wine.
Compared with the last mentioned production from a single establishment,
our own 1895 crop of about 1,900 tons of grapes, seems to leave plenty of
room for extension. As with all industries for which support is sought
in the great markets of Europe &c., it is, however, necessary that only the
primest qualities should he sent out of the Colony. Experimental pro-
cesses should be discarded as far as possible, and the highest quality


aimed at, as only such will command attention at the hands of large
“ home ” buyers. It is encouraging to record that both by precept and
example—together with the granting of prizes for excellence in fruit and
vegetable growing—the Department of Agriculture are doing their utmost
to foster this and allied industries, and in this way openings are being
made not only for those who at present are engaged in developing our
agricultural resources, but for the immense army of workers which our
land is destined to see, and capable of supporting in comfort—if not in
affluence. Before dealing somewhat in detail with our crops, live stock,
topography, minerals, industries, land laws, social institutions, &c &c., we
think we cannot do better than quote a portion of a newspaper article by
the Rev. John Lamond, B.D. of Skelmorlie, N.B. who recently visited
Queensland, and whose remarks on his return to Scotland are particularly
weighty as coming from a disinterested visitor. He says, speaking of the
Darling Downs : —“ I have never seen, and I never expect to see again,
“ such beautiful pasture lands. . . . What impressed me most were
“ the vast openings for industry throughout Queensland and the whole of
“ Australia. ... In our little island, which we can conveniently
“ cross at some points in three or four hours, it is difficult to realize the
“vastness of these Australian plains. It almost appeared to me that the
“ surplus population of the world could be poured into them, and even
“ then Australia would be comparatively empty.”
Further on he says : —“ What is needed above all in Queensland is
“ that people should settle upon the land. I have sometimes wondered
“ that our crofters and ploughmen do not emigrate in larger numbers.
“ They have a practical knowledge of agriculture, and have been trained
“in habits of industry. In Queensland as in other parts of Australia,
“they would find land at a small initial cost, and there is no reason why
“ after twenty or thirty years of honest labour they should not be in com-
“ fortahle circumstances.”
And again : —“ I ought to state that the Queensland Government
“ are giving agriculturists every inducement to emigrate, and that
“ there is a special demand in the colony for men born north of the
“ Tweed. I met several of ‘ our boys,’ full of hope for the future, going
“ north to Cairns, Mackay, and other settlements. The advantage of
“going to the colonies is that there are more openings there than at home.
“ At the same time, life has not that rich background of interest which
“ we are familiar with in the old land.”
WATER SUPPLY.
Of paramount importance to all, we believe we may say —certainly of
as great importance to the agriculturist as quality of Soil—is the question
of water supply. Without it the best of land and the most favorable
temperature are useless to man and beast; with its aid, the very desert


may be made to blossom as a rose. Whilst the mean average rainfall of
Queensland is high, it is somewhat irregular and although most portions
of the colony are rarely visited by droughts, in others it is almost
an annual occurrence. One of the highest rainfall records was that
of 239.128 inches at Goondi, for the year 1894 ; and the lowest—that of
4.96 inches, at Kallidawarry, via Windorah, (some 700 miles west of
Brisbane) in the same year. Over a large extent of country the careful
conservation of rain and surface water is alcne needed to permit of
judicious irrigation of crops. This practice is being increasingly adopted
in many places with marked success. In 1895 an area of 6,447 acres was
treated in this manner, and an increase of from 10% to 100% upon non-
irrigated crops was secured in the case of lucerne, sugar cane, maize and
pumpkins. In the district of Ayr, comprising the rich alluvial lands of
the Burdekin delta, nearly 5,000 acres under cane, sweet potatoes,
&c. were irrigated, but owing—as in 1894—t0 heavy rainfalls in this
locality irrigation was not an advantage in every instance. In dry
seasons, however, the practice is an invaluable one, and every farmer
should be in a position in this colony to fall back upon artificially stored
water. Cane, cereals, fodder plants, and fruit trees all pay handsome re-
turns for the outlay, and it is only a matter of time when a good water
reserve will be considered as necessary as a plough. In many districts,
especially in the Western and North Western country, the rainfall is
so irregular that the conservation of water could not be attempted if such
were the only source of supply, and for many years not only did the more
severe droughts occasion endless loss amongst cattle and sheep, but many
of the townships were threatened with extinction for want of water.
About 13 years ago a private bore was successful in raising some 80,000
gallons per diem, and in 1895 the matter was taken up in a spirited
manner by the Government. Search was made for geological formations
which would be likely to yield artesian supplies, and a bore was put down
at Blackall, from which 178,000 gallons were obtained—since increased
to 300,000 gallons per diem. This was followed by others, until now
we have some 470 bores (mostly in the Western districts) of which
317 overflow with an output, as stated previously, of some 193,000,000
gallons per diem. This is equivalent to upwards of 70,000,000,000 galls,
per annum, an enormous body of water. By the kindness of Mr. J. B.
Henderson, Member Institute C.E. etc. etc.—who has charge of this very
important department I am enabled to make comparisons of the volume
of our artesian supply with that of some of the best known Australian
and British reservoirs. In round numbers, the above mentioned annual
discharge is more than seventy times the capacity of the Enoggera
Reservoir (from which source Brisbane until recently obtained its sole
supply) ; over 21 times that of the Malmsbury Coliban (supplying the
three important Victorian towns of Castlemaine, Sandhurst, and Carlton);


11 times that of the Yan Yean (supplying Melbourne); and 6 times
that of the Prospect (supplying Sydney.) The figures relating to the
British reservoirs are even more interesting, particularly when viewed in
the light of the population they supply ; Lake Vyrny (in the vicinity
of the city of Liverpool), Lake Thirlmere (near Manchester), and Loch
Katrine (near Glasgow), each support over 500,000 persons —or more
than the population of all Queensland —and their ascertainable contents
are, respectively, about one-fifth, one-eighth, and one-twelfth the capacity
of our bore water. Compared with Lough Vartry, from which the city
of Dublin is supplied, the annual discharge of Queensland artesian water
is 29 times as great. The population dependent upon the water of
the Lough amounts .to between 300,000 and 400,000. The last example
we will mention is the Lough Island Reavy Reservoir (County Down,
Ireland), near Castlewilliam and the River Muddock, a tributary of the
River Bann, of which the capacity is 1,798,750,000 gallons, or about
1-39 part of our annual artesian supply. The following are the capacities
of Reservoirs not given above :

Amongst bores sunk by Government, the largest yield is obtained at
Charleville, viz. : 3,000,000 gallons per diem. The temperature of the
water as delivered is 106° Fahrenheit, and as it possesses valuable
mineral properties is much used by residents and visitors for bathing
purposes. The flow is generally under control by means of a valve,
but the static pressure at the surface is such (100 lbs. per square inch)
that a magnificent jet of water some 30 feet in height can be thrown up
at will. The above has been sold to the Charleville Municipal Council
for the sum of £1,500. Of private bores from 40 to 50 overflow to
the extent of 1,000,000 gallons per diem and upwards; 11 to the extent
of 2,000,000 gallons and over ; and 7 have an output of 3,000,000
to 4,000,000 gallons. Temperatures vary from 85° in the case of
“ Aramac No. 1” (depth 650 feet), to 150° at Hamilton Downs bore
(depth 3,301 ft.) and 173° at Winton, where the depth of the bore reaches
4010 ft. Besides this varied suitability to irrigation, watering of stock, and
cure of certain forms of disease, the high temperature and great pressure


at which much of this water is delivered will be found of immense value
commercially and mechanically, and already we note that water from the
last named bore has been utilised for mechanical purposes. At Thargo-
mindah the pressure exceeds 280 lbs. per square inch. It will be seen
from the few preceding remarks that much has been done in a short space
of time towards the development of our resources in the interior, but
much remains to be done before close settlement can take place in the
Western districts. It has been estimated 'by our Government Hydraulic
Engineer that water-bearing strata occur over at least 106,000 square
miles. Besides this enormous area—which has been already proved to be
more or less satisfactory from an artesian point of view—there still
remain some 182,000 square miles of country of the geological formation
in which these water supplies occur, viz.: the Lower Cretaceous or rolling
Downs Formation, which have not been touched by the driller, and steps
are being taken to ascertain whether this South Western country will
respond as readily when tapped as has been the case with that already
explored. It is a remarkable fact that owing to the nature of the
soil, etc. the Western country —although deprived of a large portion of the
rainfall by the ranges which intercept the vapour laden clouds from the
Coast—produces grasses of better quality than other portions of the
Colony, so that with the advent of water the stock carrying capacity of
pastoral properties will be largely increased. Nor should we forget the
possibilities for agricultural settlement which have been opened up
in this manner and are being already availed of. At Barcaldine
and at Cunnamulla artesian water has been used on a small scale for
the irrigation of cereals and vegetables, and the results will probably
lead to an extension in this direction. The reticulation of these two
and other townships with means for the conveyance of bore water to
the residents has been effected, and doubtless the practice will be followed
wherever artesian supplies can be secured. A noticeable feature in the
greater number of artesian bores is that the tendency is towards increase
of flow as time goes on, an unmistakable evidence of the practically
illimitable extent of the sources of supply. Many hypotheses have been
put forward as regards the location of the “ head” from which these take
take their rise, but we cannot discuss them here. For further information,
we would refer the reader to an interesting paper on the subject by
Mr. Robt. L. Jack, F.G.S., F.R.G.S.—Government Geologist—and
other publications of our own and the New South Wales geological
departments.
From the 1896 report of the Government Hydraulic Engineer I
learn that the estimated value of our artesian bores up to the end of the
above year is some £900,000, and the total length of boring effected in
search of water is some 108 miles. The average depth of the Western
bores is 1,168 feet, but some excellent yields have been obtained at a much


less depth ; as at No. 2 bore, Saxby Downs, where a yield of 1,000,000 gal-
lons per diem has been secured at 548 feet ; at “ Bunda Bunda No. 1” —
1,500,000 gallons at 682 ft., and “Bowwater,” Millungera —2,600,000
gallons at 700 feet. The location of these bores can be ascertained by
constilting the report and appendices. On the other hand, many
bores have had to be carried to a depth of 1,000 to 4,000 feet, generally
resulting in a water supply of hundreds of millions of gallons per annum.
Exclusive of the casings, which are usually left in the successful wells, the
cost of boring ranges from 17s. per foot, to as much as 555. per foot in the
case of those of great depth ; in fact, the owner of one private bore,
some 4,000 feet in depth, is reported to have spent about £IB,OOO on
the same, casing included. The altitude of the various bores in the
Colony is very varied, and so far as at present known this does not
appear to be a factor in determining the flow of water. The bore of
which the mouth seems to be at the greatest altitude is that at Tambo—
-1,825 feet above sea level —yielding 200,000 gallons per diem; whilst
at Burketown, where the surface ground is only 12 feet above sea-
level, a flow of only 80,000 gallons per diem is attained, and at
Northampton Downs the magnificent output of 1,500,000 gallons per
diem has been secured at an altitude of 1090 feet above sea level. In
other instances the positions are reversed, the Muckadilla bore at 1,169
feet above sea level, yielding but 23,000 gallons, whilst that at Yarmouth—
-703 feet above the sea —gives 2,709,990 gallons per diem.
The natural supply of water in the Colony generally is not, however,
nearly so scanty as has been popularly supposed. In addition to the
noble streams which traverse many of the pastoral properties, there
are numbers of lakes—some more or less salt —which will become
generally known and utilised as close settlement takes the place of
unwieldly and oftentimes unprofitable cattle runs. Whilst nowhere
approaching the size of Lakes Eyre, Torrens, Gardiner and Frome (of
South Australia) our own are sufficiently large to command some notice.
In the South West we have Lakes Wyara, Numalla, Bullawarra, Bulloo,
Pender, Barolka and Mackillop (or Yamma Yamrna) ; in the West we
have the Diamantina Lakes, and Lakes Machatti, Spring, Phillipi and
Amaroo. Whilst Lake Nash is situated on the border of the northern
territory of South Australia. Not many miles from the township of
Boulia are a number of natural artesian springs known as Elizabeth
Springs. At Angy, some 50 miles to the north of these, and within
28 miles of Boulia township, twenty or thirty strong springs give an
abundant supply of water. According to reports quoted by Mr. R. L.
Jack in “ Geology and Palaentology of Queensland,” the temperature
of the water is not above normal heat, but so far as is known no
analysis of the same has been made.


In Central Queensland there are two large lakes, each several
square miles in extent, which are comparatively unknown, viz., Lake
Buchanan and Lake Galilee (or Jochmus.) Both of these handsome
sheets of water are close on 20 miles in length and four or five across their
widest part and the latter is only some fifty miles distant from the town
of Aramac, and can be reached by coach and saddle horse from Barcaldine
on the Central line of railway. Further north are found the less
important Lake Powlathanga, near Charters Towers, and Lake Lucy,
at the head of the Burdekin, about 130 miles distant as the crow flies, in
a north-westerly direction. During medium seasons many beautiful
stretches of fresh water adorn our cattle stations, but as these are
intermittent I will just mention one—that at Glenormiston—which is 1
mile in length, and 30 ft. deep. Scattered throughout the colony are
numbers of springs, providing the clearest of health-giving water;
many of them, such as that at Spring Bluff—on the main range, just
below Toowoomba—as well as the Spa waters of Helidon, in the same
neighbourhood, being noted for their perennial coolness. Besides the
various groups of hot springs in the neighbourhood of Boulia and
Warenda, there are those of Enniskillen, between Tambo and Blackall—
in the Central Districts. Some have a high temperature, and most valu-
able medicinal properties. Of these the Innot Hot Springs, situated 21-
miles north-west of Woodleigh Station, near Herberton, at an elevation of
1,900 feet afford a notable example ; the water from which is used either
as a hot bath, the natural temperature being 189° Fahr., or bottled for
drinking purposes, and according to analytical report is equal to many of
the renowned European mineral waters for the cure of certain forms
of disease.* Iru the Etheridge district also are extensive hot springs,
having valuable medicinal properties; these are about 45 miles distant
from Georgetown, and bear the name of the Einasleigh Hot Springs.
They consist of five distinct springs of the most beautifully clear blue

picturesque surroundings, or beauty of colour, such as the “ Pink
Terraces” of New Zealand (now destroyed by volcanic action), but in
point of symmetry the calcareous basins of many of them are in no way
inferior to those of our sister isles.
On the Saxby River, a tributary of the Flinders, which empties itself
into the Gulf, are found hot mud springs, of which the efflorescence
usually surrounding this class of spring consists mainly of a sesquicar-
b*nate of soda (native “ Trona”) and is used largely as a baking soda
and for other purposes. The following is an analysis of a sample of this

Further up the coast on the York Peninsula, are a group of springs heavily
mineralised, known as the Soda Springs. These are situated a short


distance inland from Princess Charlotte Pay and are near the route from
the Musgrave to the Coen township. The South Eastern, and the whole
of the Western portion of the Peninsula are abundantly watered by rivers
of exceptional length ; many of those on the Western watershed being
navigable for craft drawing about sft. of water, for a distance of 30 miles
from their mouth. Immense tracts of moderately fertile land are still
unoccupied on the western side, and seeing that the climate although
tropical is by no means severely so, and the rainfall far more regular
whilst little heavier —if any—than that of Brisbane, great inducement offers
to the settlement of the Peninsula. In what is known as the Gulf country,
viz : —that which is washed by the waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the
r i vers —many of considerable size—form a perfect network with which
the excellent land could be readily irrigated and turned into a veritable
garden. The temperature here is also pleasant during the greater part of
the year, the rainfall though rather irregular is ample. On the Gregory
River and its branches, fruit of varied description grows most prolifically.
Oranges, Lemons, and Bananas may be seen on the cattle stations, which
if grown in quantity, would find a ready market in the towns of Norman -
ton, Burketown, Croydon, &c. Grapes are grown to perfection, and most
kinds of Vegetables, so that it will be seen that this locality is greatly
favoured by nature as regards water supply, and should commend itself
to agriculturists generally.
I have alluded to the rainfall of this Western watershed as being
similar to that of Brisbane, and may add that that of the North Western
portion of the Colony is about equal to that of the far famed Darling
Downs. It is, however, as previously inferred, on the coast that the rain-
fall is greatest, and that there is the least need to resort to artificially
raised supplies. The district of Geraldton enjoys the unique distinction of
having the highest record both for annual mean.rainfall and mean number of
wet days in Queensland. From the map of Mr. J. B. Henderson showing
the rainfall to the end of 1894, it is seen that the former stands at 156.32
inches, and the latter at 156 (days), approximately. The actual rainfall
in ’94 was 211.24 inches, the number of days 184. It is interesting to
note, in this connection, that the maximum rainfall in England is 145
inches, whilst London has about 24 inches ; Nottingham, 23.9 inches ;
Paris, 22.9 inches ; New York 43" ; and Melbourne, 25.44" per annum.
The ports of Cairns, (103.82") ; Cardwell, (90.92"); Port Douglas,
(89.24") ; Cooktown, (74.12") ; Mackay, (72.73") and others within the
tropics enjoy heavy rainfalls, and here sugar, coffee, bananas, mangoes
and rice produce heavy yields.
The heaviest rainfall South of the tropic of Capricorn is at Nerang
(75.58") followed closely by Brisbane, (51.28"); Gympie, (49.81") ;
Bundaberg, (49.38"); Maryborough (48.99") and Toowoomba, (46.71").


In common with the South Western, Central, and Northern divisions
the coastal districts in the South East of Queensland possess various
stretches of inland water, not all of them well known as yet. In alluding
to lakes in the rest of the Colony, I have only mentioned the principal
ones, and of those in the Port Curtis electorate, I will just mention Lake
Graham, lying towards the head of Alligator Creek ; Lake Learmonth
in the vicinity of the Morinish Goldfields ; Lake Murray, a few miles
out from the City of Rockhampton, and Lake Victoria.
Undoubtedly the finest sheets of water near our Coast are the chain
of Lakes in the Wide Bay electorate —known as the Noosa Lakes, and
comprising Lakes Weyba, Dunella, Cootharaba, Cooroybah, Nibra, Como
and Cooloolah. Although of little or no service for agricultural pur-
poses—being periodically more or less salt, owing to tidal influence—
these extensive and picturesque waters are the resort of millions of fish,
endless in variety and of the finest eating quality. Perhaps one of the
commonest visitants of the “ finny tribe ” is the “ sea mullet,” (mugil
dobula), which is not believed to permanently inhabit these waters,
although a small number may do so. Speaking of fish, we believe the
record weight was obtained recently at Rockhampton, (some 200 or 800
miles to the north of these Lakes), from a wharf of which city an enor-
mous fish of the cod species was secured at the close of 1896, by the com-
bined efforts of two anglers, not, however, until a number of hooks and
portions of lines had ministered to his voracious appetite. The weight
recorded at the Corporation weigh-bridge, was 8 cwt. 7lbs. and the length
6ft. Bin. As may be imagined a heavy line was required to land this,
monster, and the haul was considered of such interest that a photograph
was obtained, and is now in the possession of a resident of Winton
(Central Queensland). Further particulars of our Queensland fishes will
be given further on.
Inland from the Noosa Lakes some 65 miles in a direct line, and
almost midway between Jondaryan on the Western Railway and Kilkivan
on the North Coast Railway, lies the district of Nanango, one which is
especially favored in regard to water, soil, and temperature ; although
not so much so in facilities of transport.
That which, however, concerns us more particularly just now are
the numerous large creeks (viz : —Stuart, Barker’s, Baramba, Boonara,
and Boyne,) and almost innumerable smaller watercourses, with which
the neighbourhood abounds. Deep and permament lagoons are found
on many of the flats removed from the creeks, and the nature of the
country generally is such that water is readily stored by means of
dams, where not already found. Wells have been sunk in various places
with a fair amount of success. On the Stuart Range about 20 miles
from the town of Nanango is a splendid piece of fresh water, but owing


to the dense scrub by which it is surrounded its existence was for a long
time unknown to the residents.
South East of the above on the Northern side of the Southern and
Western line of Railway is another of these beauty spots, known as Lake
Clarendon. Although not shown on most maps, it is of large size, and
■easy of access, being but a short ride from Gatton Railway Station. Wild
fowl and game abound, and it is a favourite resort of residents, yet com-
paratively unknown outside of the district.
All the important towns of Queensland have an abundant supply of
water for household and municipal purposes, obtained from river, reser-
voir, or bore. Perhaps the most abundant supply is to be found in the
metropolis, which is not only served by the Enoggera Reservoir—having
a capacity of 1,000,000,000 gals. —but to this have been added, of late
years, the reservoirs at Gold Creek and Mount Crosby, affording an almost
unlimited supply of excellent water. In addition to these public sources
of supply, tanks for the storage of rain water are almost invariably
attached to residences, so that ample water is secured for all purposes, and
there is scarcely a cottage even but has its bathroom. On the Southern
side of the City in the vicinity of Mt. Gravatt, lie a chain of water-holes
of great depth and containing the best of water, which could in addition
be utilized in the public service. Amongst others could be mentioned the
towns of Toowoomba and Warwick, supplied from reservoir, and the
Condamine River, respectively. The Warwick water supply deserves
especial mention, as being practically inexhaustible and of excellent
quality. At Gympie, and at Charters Towers, there are large sources
of supply in the rivers of these two districts, viz : the Mary, and the
Burdekin. Lagoons of large extent supply the city of Rockhampton with
the best of drinking water.
In many districts where the rainfall is deficient a compensating
abundance of dew is met with ; indeed without this wise provision of
nature, the herbage in drought stricken localities would speedily become
■exterminated and far more serious losses in stock occur than is the case.
To travellers, also, the heavy dew-fall of Queensland has often been of
incalculable value, it being not a very uncommon practice with them—
when in the “ back blocks” and short of water—to drag a blanket over
the dew-laden ground, and to utilize the water obtained by wringing
it out.
In concluding these few remarks I think I cannot do better than
quote the following from a Western newspaper “ Winton Herald" of 25th
Nov. ’96 as showing the appreciation which has been shown for the
liberality of our Government in the encouragement of artesian boring.
“An immense tract of our western country, which would be other-
wise valueless for grazing purposes, owes its present utility to the benefit


derived from the artesian bores, with which this part of the colony
abounds. Every year large sums are spent in these ventures, and in the
majority of cases so successful have they proved that there are few
pastoral holdings which have not one or more artesian supplies in
addition to the improvements in the shape of tanks, etc. In our own
district a large number of stations are now carrying on active boring
operations, and others still further west have in many instances had their
energy rewarded by striking a never-failing source of water supply. The
Government deserve every credit for the assistance given to local bodies
by the advance of money for boring purposes, though in our own case
this is unnecessary now. What chiefly effects this district is the Govern-
ment plan of sinking bores for the purpose of encouraging settlement on
the land. The soil is second to none in Australia, and needs only regular
rainfall or artificial water to make it produce almost any grain suitable
to a tropical climate—veritably a land flowing with milk and honey.
But revenons a nos moutons. Under the Central Boring scheme, the
Government intend sinking artesian wells, rather centrally situated, in
various districts of the colony, and we are credibly informed that this
district is fortunate enough to be so favored, though no particulars will
be available for a short time.”
SOILS.
In local “parlance” these are divided into “scrub,” “forest,” and
“ plains ’; though the terms to the new comer are somewhat unmeaning.
A more accurate division is that given by the Curator of the BrisDane
Botanic Gardens* at the Agricultural and Pastoral Conference of 1889, as
follows :—Argillaceous (or clayey), loamy, sandy, marly, calcareous, and
humus soils ; all of which are represented in the colony. Of the two
first-mentioned classes is much of our far-famed Darling Downs and
western country—as well as a proportion of forest land ; whilst the last-
named are invariably known as “ scrub,” comprising all those river flats
and hillside slopes which have received a large amount of vegetable mould
and other detritus from higher lands, and which are —or were originally
covered with an almost impenetrable jungle of trees and undergrowth.
In the neighbourhood of Cardwell, a depth of 30 and 40 feet of soil is not
uncommon. The sandy soils are many of them most fertile, as at Roma,
whilst others, such as have been utilised on our coasts for cocoanut,
mango and pineapple culture, have but a limited amount of fertility. Of
the two remaining classes of soils, that which I have styled “ calcareous”
(containing at least 20% of carbonate of lime) is the least commonly
met with, a deficiency which we can afford to make up by artificial means,
considering our wealth of almost inexhaustible humus soil. Inadvisable

as the practice is, many —if not most —of our scrub farms have been
unintermittently planted with the same crop for perhaps ten to twenty
years; and whilst some of our farmers practice the rotation of crops, the
“ old country” system of letting the land lie fallow every four or
five years, as well as that of applying fertilisers, is seldom adopted—nor
indeed has the fertility of our alluvial soils and some of those of volcanic
origin become even yet sufficiently exhausted to carry conviction to all.
Much as we should reprehend certain practices of the Chinese market
“In the heart of the scrub.”
gardeners in our midst, a valuable object lesson is afforded by the
assiduous artificial irrigation and application of fertilisers which they
invariably practice, even on the naturally fertile flats and gullies where
they locate their gardens. As instancing the unaided results obtained on
“ scrub” soils, it may be mentioned that in the Gympie Land Agent’s
district two crops of maize, each 50 bushels per acre, have been obtained
in one year ; also two crops of potatoes, aggregating 6 tons per acre;


oaten-hay, 2to 8 tons per acre; green lucerne, to 9 tons per acre
(according to the number of times it was cut) ; sweet potatoes, 10 and
even 20 tons per acre ; and sugar cane, 40 to 60 tons, yielding from 22
cwt. to 30 cwt. of sugar per acre. With proofs such as these, are
we not justified in stating that we have land of unsurpassable, if not
unapproachable fertility ?
Nor are the above mere isolated instances of the phenomenal yields.
In the Cairns and Douglas districts the average yield of maize for the five
years ending 1890 were (according to the report of the Registrar-General
for 1895) 40.75 bushels, and 44.23 bushels per acre respectively, although
owing to the exceptionally unfavourable climatic conditions between 1890
and 1895, this average was not maintained. It will readily be seen that
for a district to average (ever the space of five years) anything like the
above quoted figures, some very high yields must have been obtained.
In the district of Mackay during the year ’95 some 600 bushels of
rice were obtained from the small area of 14 acres, being at the rate
of 42.85 bushels per acre, and our average yield for the year 1890
was 32 bushels, as compared with the average obtained in India—one of
the chief rice countries in the world—of 12 bushels. As high as 68 bushels
per acre has been obtained by Mr. McPherson in Brisbane.
Fertility is not, however, confined to “ scrub” land. The red and
chocolate coloured loams of our elevated table lands—often 30 to 40
feet deep ; the clays of our south-western and western plains ; the volcanic
soil on which much of our heavy forest timber grows, and the sandy loams
of Roma, Goondiwindi, &c., have each their special recommendations.
In the chocolate soil of the Stanthorpe district, 3 tons of grapes, 2
tons of oaten hay, tons potatoes and 23 bushels of wheat to the
acre have been frequently noted; whilst the red soil of Toowoomba and
district produced at the rate of tons of grapes per acre, in the year 1895.
The comparatively low average yield of maize in the Herberton district
(29.35 bus.) as disclosed by the Agricultural returns for 1895 would seem
to favour the assumption that either owing to climatic hindrances in
that year, or careless cultivation, justice was not done to the crop.
Previous to 1882, crops of 60 and 80 bushels of maize, and 2 tons of
oaten hay per acre had been harvested, and considering the acknowledged
fertility of the chocolate and scrub soil of this table-land as evinced
by the heavy forest timber, large scrub timber, and dense undergrowth of
the district, we cannot accept these figures as by any means the best
it can show. The special characteristic of our table-lands—or plateaus—
is the cool temperature which they enjoy in comparison with land in the
same latitude, but at a less elevation from the sea-level. The temperature
of Herberton, for instance, is five to seven degrees lower than that of the
neighbouring towns of Cairns, Townsville, and Bowen (the two latter are


coastal towns further from the Equator) : whilst in the neighbourhood of
Toowoomba the thermometer registers throughout the year a considerably
lower temperature than is the case at Yandilla, Southport, Ipswich, Texas,
Cunnamulla and Thargomindah. This is the most marked in midsummer,
when the difference ranges between 6° and 18° in favour of Toowoomba,
as against 8° to 10° less in early summer and 8° to 7° less in mid-
winter than the above mentioned places, which are all in the same
or a higher latitude.
Although not directly connected with the question of soil, this
peculiarity of the table-lands has a most important bearing upon the
agriculture engaged in, as we not only, have in these lands all
the requisites in the way of soil, but the climatic conditions are such
that most —if not all —of the fruits and crops raised in the temperate zone
of Europe and the United States may be grown here to perfection.
I shall have occasion to refer to these later on.
So far we have only considered the humus or scrub soils (the term
“ scrub” being loosely applied, often, to all land covered with heavy
undergrowth, whether of alluvial or volcanic origin) and those found
on our table lands, not coming in the category of scrub soils.
Our forest lands are extensive and of such varied character that
to attempt to “ bunch” them is absurd. A large proportion of forest
timber grows on what may be called a “ hungry” loam, on heavy
clay, and sandy soils. Much of this soil although not suited to all
crops, may with deep cultivation, drainage and artificial feeding, be
made to produce various field and fruit crops to perfection. There is,
however, all over the colony a large amount of lightly timbered country
(some of which goes by the name of “bastard scrub”) with great depth
and fertility of soil, on which grain crops, fodder crops and artificially
sown pasture may be raised with excellent results. These loamy soils
vary from black to red, and constitute the greater portion of the
agricultural land still in the hands of the Crown, the scrub lands owing
to their paramount fertility having nearly all been alienated—those
which are absolutely inaccessible to market excepted.
Clay soils are found throughout the greater portion of the colony,
but are chiefly represented by the black and drab soils of the Darling
Downs, the Maranoa, and Western and Central plains. When aided by
a sufficient water supply, these have proved of great cropping quality. They
are fairly friable and sometimes of great depth, but in most cases require
artificial irrigation and drainage to be of much agricultural value. In
some few localities the rainfall and natural drainage are sufficient, and
where this is the case many heavy crops have been secured. The great
success attendant upon artesian bores to date is encouraging a very exten-
sive testing of our resources in the direction of artificial water supply and


conservation, and much has already been done to render these and other
lands responsive to the labours of the agriculturist. It is conceded by all
stockmen that the country at present being redeemed from drought by
artesian water, produces far better grasses than do our coast lands, an
experience fully backed up by the observations of the Chairman of the
Royal Commission upon Irrigation (Victoria, 1885,) on his visit to the
United Spates in the same year, upon which occasion he was accompanied
by John L. Dow, Esq., M.P. (Viet.), and another special reporter. It
was remarked by these gentlemen that none of the districts visited (and
they were many) were so productive nor were they so profitably cultivated
as those in California, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico (all of which are
irrigated), and may we not infer that soils which—without irrigation—
have, in fair seasons, produced such luxuriant pasturage as our western
plains, will, with its assistance, rival, and possibly outstrip those even of
California. I mention this State for the reason that, of all the Union,
California was alone considered by these gentlemen to approach in natural
advantages those of their own colony, and we think we may lay claim to
at least an equal place with our sister colony.
Calcareous and marly soils are not common. They are, however, to
be found here and there ; but owing to their small area and the scattered
districts in which they are situated, no general guide to their position can
be given.
Last—but not least —are the sandy soils, of which the Roma district
may be said to be typical. The suitability of these to the culture of the
vine has been proved by the foremost position occupied by Roma in grape
production, which, according to official returns, reached in 1895, some
one million odd lbs. weight, or in exact figures 2861 lbs. per acre in full
bearing. From the neighbouring district of Mitchell, on which sandy as
well as loamy soil is found, a return of about 1£ tons per acre was
obtained, and about 15 years ago as much as 10s. and 12s. per gal. was
realised from wine made here.
The cultivation of wheat has also been very successful in the Roma
and Mitchell districts, the average return per acre being, in 1894, as high
as 15.65 bus. and 14.99 bus. respectively. It is regrettable that the dry
season of 1895 conduced to a very much lower yield, although—failing
official figures—we estimate that the ’96 returns will closely approximate
those of 1894. The above are hut .24 bushels per acre below the average
for the colony, 1891 to 1895, and are in both instances above a 25 years
average for the State cf New York, quoted in 1890 by the Director of the
New York Agricultural Experiment Station.
More might be said on this most important subject, and possibly
opportunity may offer when referring to the various crops and districts in


detail, but sufficient evidence, we think, has been adduced to demonstrate
that—although much of our agricultural soil is at present given up to
pastoral pursuits, or —even worse than that—to the undisturbed posses-
sion of kangaroo and dingo, we have ample land of the very best quality
for agriculturist and pastoralist alike.
CLIMATE.
Speaking of Queensland from an agricultural point of view, our
climate is exceptional. The vast area of our territory, extent of coast line
and geographical position induce climatic conditions under which almost
any crop may be grown and any occupation followed. These may be
classed as Temperate—as experienced in the high lands of the south-
eastern portion ; Sub-tropical—extending over the remaining portion of
Queensland south of the Tropic of Capricorn, and including the table
lands within the tropics ; and Tropical—found in the northern portion of
the colony. Accurately speaking, the latter is about equally divided
between the South Temperate and the Tropical Zones.
It will have been seen that in point of productiveness our soils can
vie with that of any of our neighbours, which may be partly accounted for
by the fact that our genial climate often allows our farmers to harvest two
or even three crops in the year, where the southern colonies can only har-
vest one, whilst our tropical products cannot —by reason of geographical
position—be raised by any other Australian Colonies except South and
Western Australia. These two have not so far devoted any appreciable
attention to agriculture, so that in this respect we should hold a far
higher position than we do.
The Summer extends from September to April (inclusive) and al-
though within the Tropics these months are, with few exceptions, de-
cidedly hot, the temperature during the remainder of the year is pleasant,
and well suited all over the Colony to the growth of temperate field
and fruit crops and vegetables.
The summer Season in the South Eastern portion of Queensland, on
some of the more northern coast lands, and the elevated table-lands, re-
sembles somewhat the Winter Season in the Tropics, whilst the month of
May, June, July, and August afford the most beautiful weather —a dry,
healthy atmosphere, genial temperature, and cloudlesss sky, which if not
the joy of the Agriculturalist in the past, may with proper atttention to the
conservation of become so in the future, and has always been the
theme of unstinted praise by visitors from other climes. By many, our
climate is considered fully equal to that of Madeira, the Riviera, and the
chief sanatoriums of the Old World. The rigours of winter: snow, ice,
&c. are not experienced here, and their appearance causes as much
interest as w r ould that of our “ black swan” at “ home,” the only objection-


able features of winter being dry, cold winds which come from the
inland, and are styled “ westerly winds” The visitor finds these
rather pleasant than otherwise, although by residents of long standing,
they are considered bitterly cold. One notable feature is the almost
entire absence of the hot winds of the Southern Colonies and the
“ willy nillies” of the northwest of Australia. Cyclones visit some of
the northern towns (as is the case in all tropical countries), but only at
long intervals ; such disturbances on land and sea being fortunately but
rare occurances.
Compared with various towns throughout the world on the same
parallel of latitude—and in many cases even further removed from the
Equator—many of our towns, both without and within the tropics, can
show a very much milder mean average temperature. It may suffice for
our purpose to instance the city of Brisbane (about 68° Fahr.) as compared
with New Orleans, (69.1°) Cairo, (72.2°), Rockhampton, (72°) as compared
with Havana, (79.1°) Townsville, (75°) as compared with Bombay (81.3°)
The 1891 lowest mean shade temperature for the Colony was found
at Stanthorpe—sß° and the highest at Normanton—7B°, from which it
will be seen that although extremes of temperature may and do sometimes
occur, Queensland on the whole is not subject to them. As the
traveller goes West (speaking generally) and North, the temperature rises,
the South Eastern portion being in the matter of climate one of the most
favoured spots on the earth, summer heat being almost invariably tempered
by regular wind currents which set in from the sea ; and in a lesser degree
this applies to some of our Northern seaports and tablelands. In no portion
of this Colony is the temperature a bar to the residence of a white popu-
lation although owing to the ease and small expenditure with which
labourers from the adjoining South Sea Islands may be imported, most
northern agriculturists (especially cane growers) prefer to employ this
form of “ coloured labour,” and merely supervise the w r ork of these so-called
“ boys”. I think we may consider the fact that most of our trees are
overgreen—compared with the great preponderance of deciduous trees in,
say, (jreat Britain and the States—as in some measure supporting our
plea for climatic advantages over the major part of the globe.
Although advisable in order to produce the very best results, the
winter housing of live stock is neither necessary nor often practiced.
Immense flocks of the finest merinos, long woolled, and cross bred sheep
run on their pastures the year through ; cattle reach their best during the
winter season running at large in a good “ paddock”, horses likewise when
not engaged in heavy work find all their needs in the open fields—winter
as well as summer, and even dairy cattle have been habitually left during
the winter months to browse on the open pastures.
In the North, the rainy season may be considered as extending from


December to April, and it is during these months that the agriculturist
expects to see the main growth of all tropical crops. Following on these
is a cool season of short duration in which he can produce anything he
may fancy in the way of vegetables, &c. The Southern rainy season is
not so long, or so marked, indeed in some years the rainfall has been
spread over the whole year in such a manner as to entirely dispose of the
“ rainy season” for that year.
GRASSES.
The subject of grasses and grazing are of the greatest importance—
and should be of the greatest interest —to all who, whether as pastoralists
or farmers, have anything to do with the raising of stock. Our natural
grasses possess a vitality—and in good seasons a luxuriance—which have
contributed somewhat to apathy in the past. Thanks, however, to the
praiseworthy efforts of our Colonial Botanist, Mr. F. M. Bailey, F.L.S.,
and our Department of Agriculture, who have supplied information
respecting the relative value of our multitudinous grasses and have given
practical assistance towards supplementing or substituting these by more
suitable varieties where needed, an intelligent interest is awakening in the
minds of many ; and we may hope soon to see much larger areas of
artificially sown indigenous, and foreign grasses than we at present
possess. Grass is the mainstay, and in the great majority of instances
the only food, of our 6,000,000 cattle, 20,000,000 sheep, and 500,000
horses ! As such, it should command a large share of attention at the
hands of practical men.
The testimony of all travellers goes to prove that some of our natural
pastures (particularly in the western interior) possess the most valuable
fattening and drought resisting qualities, and when aided by artificial
water supply, they have still further improved. On many of our best
farms, irrigation is practised with the best of results, some 275 acres in
the neighbourhood of Toowoomba—largely prairie and natiiral grasses—
having made rapid growth in the spring under this treatment, although
not much benefited by the same during the cold weather. Speaking of
artificially sown pasture, the area returned under that heading fluctuates
considerably, that for 1898 having been 18,000 acres odd, whilst that for
1895 was smaller. Knowing the splendid results which can be obtained
from sheep, cattle, horses, and even pigs by these methods, the reason for
this apparent falling off must, it is thought by our Government Statisti-
cian, be ascribed to the cutting of a portion of the above area for hay.
However this may be, it is certain that a series of good “ dripping” seasons,
would have a tendency to discourage the laying down of fresh pasturage,
although it is evident that this method of providing stock foods is gaining
favour. The area required to support stock varies from one to four acres
for sheep, and 10 to 25 acres per head of cattle or horses. The long


rank pasturage of coastal and tropical Queensland affords excellent food for
cattle and horses, and its growth is phenomenal to those unacquainted
with climatic conditions such as we enjoy. Even on the western plains,
the grasses are sometimes sufficiently long to completely hide from view
the sheep which they support, but within the tropics a height of 12 feet
has been known to be attained, notably on the Morgan River, in the
vicinity of Cooktown. The country on which this is found is locally
called “ devil-devil,” presumably from its furrow-like and swampy nature,
which make it almost impassable in wet weather. But whilst the grass
of the interior is more scanty, its staying qualities are superior, and it is
pre-eminently adapted to the feeding of sheep, which attain a greater
weight of carcase here than in any other portion of the colony. In the
Diamantina district, on Monkira cattle station (between the 24th and
25th parallel of latitude) a high class herd of shorthorns, containing
many pedigree beasts, is kept up solely on the native grasses, and
although descended from cold climate stock, the properties of these
grasses are such that, as regards condition and hardiness, they leave
nothing to be desired. The same, indeed, may be said —perhaps with
greater force —of the herds on the Georgina River, than which no better
large herds of cattle have been raised in the colony.
With regard to the other Australian colonies (excepting Tasmania
and Western Australia) our number of cattle per acre seems very small,
but it will, I think, be readily conceded that this is rather due to our vast
and, perhaps, somewhat unwieldy extent of country, and to former want
of water, than to any inferiority of pasture, in view of the fact that large
numbers of our pastoralists have come to us from these self-same colonies,
and that our live stock are much more numerous in relation to the popu-
lation than are those of any one of the group ; for whilst Queensland
had in 1895 some 202 per head of population, the next colony in order of
precedence (N.S.W.) had but 57, or about one-fourth as many per cap. ;
which, of course, gives us a far greater exporting power. With closer
settlement, and the vastly improved pasturage which arises from it—and
of which many of our southern neighbours are to some extent already
deriving the benefit—may we not reasonably expect not only a higher
ratio per head of population, but per acre also ?
Before passing on to the question of stock, with which the subject we
have been considering is so intimately connected, I feel I cannot do better
than to draw your attention to a few extracts from a paper read before
our Stockbreeders’ Association in 1894 by Mr. F. Manson Bailey; to some
more recent information from the same high authority, published by the
Department of Agriculture in pamphlet form, and to some very pertinent
utterances of Professor Shelton, M.Sc. (Queensland Instructor in Agricul-
ture), which were delivered at one of our Agricultural Conferences, and
subsequently printed. At the meeting of stockowners, Mr. Bailey said :


“ The indigenous grasses of Queensland number about 300 kinds, all
of which perform some more or less important work in the economy of
nature, and will, as they are better known, be found of advantage to the
human race. In a pamphlet published by me a few years ago, about 160
sorts were brought under notice. In this paper I shall only draw atten-
tion to a few, which I would strongly recommend at once being experi-
mented with :
“ Landsborough Grass (Avthistiria membranacea) LindL, also known
as the “ Barcoo grass” and “Red Gulf grass,” is an annual and one of
the first that should be brought under cultivation, especially for hay.
Probably no grass, either indigenous or foreign, is so relished by stock.
So fond indeed are they of it that after eating down the plant they will
lick up every stray fragment that may be found lying upon the ground.
If this grass has but the least chance it will produce good seed for the
next season’s crop. When under cultivation, it makes a dense intricate
growth from 1| to over 2 feet in height, and being very leafy and full of
seed should make nutritious hay. It is the rule to cut grass for hay when
in flower, but with a grass like the one described, this rule cannot be
strictly adhered to, for from an early period of its life it continues to
flower, and mature seed. When closely fed it bears good seed on stems
only 2 or 3 inches high, and although a tropical grass, has been found to
thrive admirably in the Brisbane District.
“ The Blue Grass, Andropogou sericeu *, R . Br This is a general
favourite with the Queensland pastoralists. It forms a good leafy bottom
and the stems are never very hard and cany, so if cut at a proper time
would form good hay : it seeds freely, so if it has anything of a show it is
not likely to be lost. There are several forms of this grass ; some of
these are of quite a delicate growth, all of which would, besides being
good pasture grasses, be suitable for hay. The tall Tassel Blue Grass,
Andropogon sericens , va \ polyxt«chyns, however, would not be suitable for
this latter purpose.
“ Of the genus Panicum, our indigenous kinds number between 50
and 60, out of which the following three might be selected for trial under
cultivation :
“P. Dficompositum R. Br. ; which is very excellent grass, either for
pasture or hay, especially that form most generally met with upon Downs
cotmtry. The seed of this grass is one of those used by the aborigines for
food. In some parts, this is known as “ Barley grass.” I have also
heard it called “ Mitchell grass.” Mr. E. Palmer tells us that the native
name at Cloncurry is “ Tindil.” This grass attains the height of from 2
to 3 feet, forms a good leafy bottom, the stems also are leafy, and the
panicle large and spreading, bearing an abundant crop of seed ; in fact it
possesses all the requisites of good hay grass.


“p, Distachyum , Linn. This is another excellent grass, and although
it is what may be termed a tropical species, it has been found to thrive
well near Brisbane, where some years ago I saw a small patch under
cultivation, and at the time it occurred to me that it would be a very
suitable kind to sow with the “ Landsborough,” for the purpose of hay.
“ Of all Panicums it would be difficult to find one superior to the
“ Warrego Summer Grass.” P. Flavidum, Retz. In localities where
this kind grows it has the name of being the best fattening grass known.
It attains the height of from to 2 feet, is very leafy and is a prolific
seed bearer. Both this and the last-named are also found in India.
“ One species of Setaria, a genus closely allied to Panicum, may be
selected for cultivation. The one I refer to is frequently to be met with
in scrubs bordering Queensland rivers. I am not aware of its having
received a local name, but to botanists it is known as Setaria macros-
tachya, H. B. and K. In the scrubs this grass has a somewhat straggling
habit, but when sown in the open field it has been seen to greatly
improve, and from what I have seen of it, I consider it fully equal, if not
superior, to the S. italica, which is probably better known amongst
farmers by its local name of “ panicum.”
“ The Satin Top, in some localities also known as Blue grass, Andro-
pogon erianthoides , F. v. M. This is one of the most remarkable of our
grasses. Anyone seeing it when in flower would be surprised if told that
it was probably, for Downs country, one of the very best that could be
grown, yet nevertheless such is the case. The flowering stalks attain 4or
5 feet in height and are very “ cany,” but its shortly creeping root-stock
forms a very close leafy turf, before and even when the plant is in flower.
It is considered to possess high fattening qualities, and when only 2or 3
inches high, has been known to keep sheep in better condition than any
of our other grasses of double that height.
“ Astrebla is an Australian genus, all the species of which are known
as “Mitchell grasses” and highly extolled for their vitality; they are
usually met with in those parts of Australia subject to long droughts.
They are coarse plants as a rule, but though their stems may appear dried
up and without life, upon the fall of even a slight shower they seem to
renew their life and burst out into growth at each knot of the tall hard
stems. The above character applies to the species A. pectinata and its
tall, coarse variety triticoidf-s. The species A. elymoides, known in the
Gulf country under the name of “ Curly Mitchell Grass,” is of a very
different habit ; instead of forming erect stout stems, its stems trail over
the ground, often several feet in length ; these are leafy and a consider-
able part is occupied by the inflorescence. Under cultivation ' this sort
would probably be found a useful hay grass, even in the Brisbane district.
The first-mentioned kinds should be grown with the object of obtaining


seeds for sowing in drier parts of our colony ; they thrive well and have
produced good seed near Brisbane. The seed in appearance resembles
small grains of wheat, and in former times Avas largely used by the
aborigines for food, and in fact might even be groAvn at the present time
as a food grain.
“ PoLlinia fulva, Bentham—the Saccharum fulvum of Bobt. BroAvn,
and Erianthus fulvus of Kunth—has ahvays been highly spoken of by
pastoralists under one or other of the following local names :—“ Brown
Top,” “ Sugar Grass,” “ Red Grass,” and “ Bastard Mitchell Grass.”
In my pamphlet on “ Queensland Grasses,” page 25, I speak of it as
“usually being met with on Avet land, and such has been my experience
but lately in a packet of grass specimens received from a pastoralist on
the Georgina River, the following note is attached to the specimens of the
present grass : —“ It is much more drought resisting than the Mitchell
grass, and springs more quickly after rain.” It produces much sweet,
nutritious herbage, and is much relished by stock, so that when met with
it is generally found closely cropped. It, however, seeds freely, if only
allowed the chance, which is probably the reason it has not long since
been lost.”
The following is extracted from the pamphlet referred to, and I need
scarcely add is worthy of careful consideration by all those at present
engaged in stock raising—or who intend to enter this industry. In the
opening sentences of the remarks just quoted, Mr. Bailey refers to the
cultivation of experimental areas of the native grasses, and I am glad to
be in a position to record that his enthusiasm on this and kindred matters
has in the present instance been at length reAvarded, and that at date of
writing several plots have been laid out in,the gardens of the Acclimatisa-
tion Society, Bowen Park, Brisbane, and are in a thriving condition.
“ Queensland is proverbially rich in the number and nutritive
character of her indigenous grasses, but Avhen one takes into account the
great extent of territory and the fertility of the soil no wonder need be
expressed at her grasses being numerous in species and abounding in
nutrition. Our grasses have pecularities also which haAe attracted the
notice of persons of other parts. Perhaps the most striking feature is the
extraordinary tenacity of life Avhich many of them possess. To fully
understand this character, one mujfc have been out on our Avestern plains
during a drought, and been a witness to the breaking up of the dry time,
or a fall of rain for an hour or so to fully believe in the magic-like change
which comes over the country ; the old dry hard clumps or tufts of grass,
which to all appearance before the fall of rain Avere dead, will be found
in only a few days time covered with green leaf, affording abundant food
for the famishing stock. All the grasses of these extensive plains are of
a tufty character. Those of a creeping or spreading growth are found


along the water courses and around waterholes. This isolation of the
plants has doubtless its advantages during the time of drought, each in-
dividual plant has more room for its roots, and during heavy continuous
wet the plants are less likely to rot off than if crowded together; the
small opening spaces also afford room for the many useful fodder herbs
which spring up at their particular season of growth. It must not be
inferred that, because in their native habitat a number of our grasses,
both large and small, grow in detached tufts, that this feature would be
detrimental to the formation of a good permanent turf. Therefore, when
any such are found recommended in this paper it is assumed that the
tufty growth of these species in certain localities is due to surrounding
circumstances. On the other hand, some of our most excellent kinds
have a decided tussocky character, which if brought under cultivation
would only be found suitable for rough, uneven, rocky land. Grasses
from the colder climates of the globe do not as a rule take kindly to any
part of Queensland, while those of our own tropical parts are found to
thrive equally well in southern portions of the colony. It may also
be well to bear in mind, when selecting kinds for experimenting with,
that a grass in its natural habitat oftentimes gives hut a poor idea of its
real qualities —a poor weak and apparently worthless kind, which a person
may meet with here and there in one of our dense scrubs, may, when it
gets the chance of spreading by a clearance being made, so change char-
acter as to be by a partial observer unrecognisable, and therefore supposed
an exotic accidently brought to the colony mixed w r ith the seeds of some
other plants.
“In very few localities or situations are grasses entirely wanting.
Our dense scrubs have kinds peculiar to them which are only waiting the
hand of man to bring them out into cultivation, and it is gratifying to
know that in the few instances where this has been done success has
crowned the experiment. Our tropical kinds thrive in the southern parts,
and those of the great western and north-western downs or plains have
been known to succeed when brought and planted both in and around
Brisbane. This, unfortunately, is only known to the few.
I
“ Our grasses are found to be in the greatest variety on the open
coast lands, and on the vast southern downs ; here within a few paces one
may gather from thirty to forty kinds. This would not be found the case
on those extensive plains reaching from the Thompson to the Georgina
rivers, where the number of kinds is limited to about ten or twelve in a
similar radius. The pleasing feature is that the excellence of the kinds
fully makes up for the paucity of the number —there is almost a total
absence of troublesome or obnoxious kinds. IJere I must be allowed to
make a digression to say that very few indeed are the purely obnoxious
grasses of Queensland, and many of these at an early stage of growth


furnish a great quantity of leafy herbage, which is most nutritious.
W hen seeding they are obnoxious to the sheep-farmer on account of the
injury caused by the seeds getting into the wool. In the same way the
tiller of the ground speaks of the couch grass being an obnoxious, trouble-
some weed, when in its proper place no more valuable grass is known.
Thus it will be observed that some of the so-called obnoxious grasses may
prove of value to the dairyman.
All persons having to do with stock will acknowledge that a necessity
exists for variety in the food of cattle as well as man. This wise pro-
vision is forcibly brought home to the mind of one travelling during the
present season across the extensive western plains which have before been
alluded to ; the season has been a favourable one, and the country retains
much of its primeval appearance—that scourgfe the “ exotic weeds” has
not as yet overrun the indigenous plants. The stock from these parts
fetch the highest price in the market. For an explanation of this pro-
blem we have not far to search : besides the excellent grasses, there is an
admixture of wholesale and nutritious herbage. I have before observed
that a peculiar feature of this pasture is that the grasses are in a manner
isolated in turfs, and that while these turfs are at no great distance
asunder, there still remains room for the growth of other plants between
them. This space is usually occupied by plants which exist but a short
time, and as one kind dies away, having gone through the course of its
life by flowering and maturing its seed, another springs up to take its
place, and goes through a similar course of existence. Thus it will be
seen that the stock have a good variety of herbage to browse upon.”
The following remarks of Professor Shelton on the subject of “Bush
Hay, coming from a gentleman of such world wide experience, will be of
special interest to stock owners who desire to conduct their operations on
scientific lines. Alluding to the above, he said :
BUSH HAY.
“ By this dubious cognomen the wild grasses of Australia when
converted into hay are commonly known. Whether the hay is cut
from the coast forest la&ds or the interior plains, matters not; all
forms of hay made from the wild grasses receive, in Queensland at least,
instantaneous popular condemnation as “ bush hay.” This general
prejudice against hay made from the native grasses is somewhat difficult
to explain, albeit it has doubtless, like most ideas widely held, a basis
of experimental facts. It is not easy to understand why grasses of
unsurpassed excellence when grazed should be comparatively worthless
when dried into the condition of hay. It is a rule without exception,,
so far as I know, that, sour or otherwise, inferior grass makes an inferior
hay, and vice versa. Of course it is equally true that many of the best

grasses cannot, from peculiarities of texture or habit of growth, pro-
fitably be made into hay. Not unlikely, faulty methods of haymaking
are the explanation of the prevailing dislike of hay made from the
wild grasses. Certainly, I have seen both hay and ensilage exhibited
at various agricultural conferences and elsewhere, made from wild grass
that to all appearances was the very perfection of fodder. The hay was
beautifully coloured, aromatic as the best English hay, and of first-
class texture. Hundreds of thousands of tons of grass easily susceptible
of manipulation into this best of hay are annually, upon our grazing
lands, converted into smoke and ashes, within sight of farmers who
are striving by laborious ploughings and seeding to make crops of lucerne
and oaten hay. I can think of few, even of the best English grasses,
that surpass as a source of horse hay Kangaroo Grass ( Authistiria,
ciliata), or Oat Grass ( Anthistiria avenacea), while Blue Grass (pro-
bably Andropogon sericeus) and Mitchell Grass ( Astrebla elymoides) are
the most promising of grasses for hay suited to sheep and cattle.
This must be borne in mind; these wild grasses cannot be treated
in hay-making as we treat bulky lucerne and oats. If these fine
grasses are allowed to remain exposed to dews and scorching suns
after having once become well dried, they deteriorate rapidly, losing
colour, flavour, and quality, becoming soon as poor as “ bush hay”
well can be. The period of growth at which the wild grasses should be
cut will vary with the different species. The coarser growing sorts will
need to be cut earlier than the finer and more leafy : but all should be cut
somewhat early, say not much after the time of blossoming. During
clear, hot weather the crop will not bear exposure much longer than one
day. The finer lighter sorts that are cut in the morning should be raked
in the afternoon, and the curing process finished in windrow and cock. By
thus following the work up closely, allowing the least possible exposure to
the weather, the colour of the hay with its other valuable qualities will be
retained. This better class of bush hay ought to be available in quantity,
and at a moderate price, to every householder in the Colony. Most
likely the native meadows would be greatly improved, even for subsequent
grazing, by mowing. The mowing would prevent offensive weeds from
coming to seed and cause a thickening of the sod that could not but be
advantageous. A great Approvement in these wild meadows might
doubtless be effected by going over the soil in the early spring time with
the harrow or scarifier, thus loosening the indurated soil and facilitating
the ingress of air, heat, and moisture to the soil beneath.
LIVE STOCK, AND MEAT EXPORT.
The Pastoral Industry is generally—and I think justly—looked upon
as of the highest importance in all the Australasian Colonies, of which
it has always been the pioneer industry. Queensland is no exception to


this rule, indeed she is the Pastoral Colony “par excellence” of the
group. Although not possessing so many sheep as New South Wales
or New Zealand, nor quite so many horses as New South Wales, she far
outdistances the other colonies in number of cattle—having close on
seven million head, or more than all those of the other colonies, h ollow-
ing the usual practice of reducing all live stock returns to terms of sheep
(on the basis of one horse or one horned beast to ten sheep or ten pigs)
the 1895 live stock returns show us to have the equivalent of 92,869,146
sheep, considerably more than one third of the approximate grand total
for the seven Australian Colonies, which is equal to 258,699,180 sheep,
whilst our area is just between a fourth and a fifth of Australia. In
“On the Maranoa"-(Mount Abundance Station.)
relation to our exports, the products of this industry take a very high
place, as much as £5,000,000 odd being contributed by wool, meat, hides,
and allied products in 1895, or more than half the 'value of oui total
exports.
We have, however, by no means reached the full measure of oui
capabilities ; rather, we have but entered on the race with the great cattle
breeding countries for the markets of the world.
Victoria, New Zealand, and New South Wales, are all more heavily
stocked per square mile than is our colony (presumably owing to their


smaller area; the smallest of the three being most heavily stocked, and so
on —in direct ratio to their size). According to 1894 figures, the first
named Colony had 406 head of live stock (terms of sheep) per square
mile, exclusive of pigs, whilst we had in 1895 but 138.77 head per square
mile — including pigs—on the same basis of calculation. There is little
doubt but that with our own genial climate, we should be in a position to
graze as many—if not more—head per square mile, and upon the above
very modest estimate (equal to more than one and a half acres per sheep,
or about sixteen acres per large beast) we might carry some 271,298,944
sheep—or other live stock in proportion. It should be remembered that
all the colonies which exceed our ratio of stock to area, not only have
far larger areas under agricultural occupation than ourselves —thus rela-
tively raising their stock ratio on purely pastoral lands —but are so much
more densely populated that (as previously stated) our proportion of live
stock to population is—even now —greater than any others of the group, and
is some 160 times as great as the proportion in any European country.
Upon the whole, as shown by figures given in Mr. Thornhill Weedon’s
“Queensland Past and Present”—an invaluable statistical work which
has just made its appearance from the hands of the Government printer—
our live stock have increased rapidly notwithstanding some very severe
checks, in the shape of bad seasons, commercial depressions, and occas-
ional outbreaks of epidemic diseases, which are by no means as severe in
these Colonies as in other portions of the Globe. The latest and perhaps
the most serious visitation our herds have experienced has been that of
the “tick” (involving an outlay of some £20,000) but the stringent
quarantine regulations which were put into force —whilst proving a very
serious drawback to the industry—have proved so effective that'in many
districts the trouble is well-nigh overcome. It has been authoritatively
stated that no advance of the scourge has taken place since July, 1896;
indeed at time of writing the most encouraging reports continue to come
in as to its noticeable abatement. The few —and comparatively mild—
diseases with which our stock owners have made acquaintance here are :
Pleuro-pneumonia —ln the “ Sixties ” much loss was occasioned by this
disease, and on the 29th January 1862 the Pleuro-Pneumonia Act was
put into force, since which time its ravages abated, and it is now scarcely
known. (Inoculation of healthy cattle with lymph from a pleuro-
pneumonia beast, as now practised, is a thoroughly reliable specific).
Tuberculosis— A disease which in human beings as well as in cattle is
receiving much attention of late ; it is confined to the moist coastal
districts, and as inspectors possessing the highest medical qualifications
examine all cattle killed at the various meat-works, and further preventive
measures are being brought forward, there is no doubt that our Colony
will soon be able to boast of comparative immunity from this disease also.
Anthrax appears but seldom, and the sphere of its influence is small.


Blackleg, fluke, foot-rot, catarrhal fever, intestinal worms, worm
nests (Spiropteric Tumours) do not offer any serious menace to the
pastoralist. Scab is unknown.
Viewed in the light of our very large number of live stock per
inhabitant, it is scarcely a matter for much surprise that our home
consumption should be large. According to a careful calculation based on
the best figures available, the Registrar-General in his 1895 Report
sets this down at 890 lbs. beef and mutton per cap. per annum —not
counting other flesh products. This means that every Queensland
resident —man, woman and child —consumes 3-J- times as much as did
those of the United States (of which the total flesh consumption is
120 lbs.); nearly four times as much as Britishers, and nearly six times
as much as Germans did some fifteen years ago. Facilities of transport
have, however, largely increased of late, and these have tended both
to lower our own meat consumption by bringing a greater variety of foods
to our door, and to raise that of small meat-eating countries through a
consequent fall in values. The growing interest in agricultural pursuits
and consequent inevitably increased consumption of vegetable foods here,
coupled with an anticipated expansion in our meat export to these
countries will tend to still further lessen this contrast. It is even stated
that some nations which have hitherto been looked upon as almost
exclusive vegetarians are adopting a meat diet; a statement which would
seem to lend colour to my assumption as regards the tendency towards
equalization of the world’s meat supply.
The live stock of Queensland consist of horses, cattle, sheep, and
a few thousand pigs, besides a number of goats, of which no official
account seems to be taken— although these latter sometimes largely
contribute to the sustenance of settlers in new or poorly grassed districts.
Analysed, the proportion of stock to area in 1895 was : Horses, 70.0 ;
Cattle, 10.20 ; Sheep, 29.70 per square mile ; and the ratio per inhabitant
was : Horses, 1.02 ; Cattle, 14.82 ; Sheep, 43.12 ; Pigs, 0.22.
HORSES.
The exact number recorded at the close of 1895 was 468,743
an increase of 5.55% on the figures for 1894. Statistics prior to the
Separation of Queensland from New South Wales are somewhat un-
reliable, but as far as I can ascertain, the number of horses in 1844
was 650; these had increased by the year 1848 to something over
2,000 head, and it is roughly computed that at the close of 1859 the
number had again risen to about 20,000 head. Six years later we
have an authentic record that the number was 51,090, which would
be equivalent to an increase during that time of more than 17% per
annum on the assumption that there were no losses —a moral im-


possibility. Few horses (and those “ blood” stock) were imported, so
that the suitability of our climate for horse breeding cannot be gainsaid.
For farm and all heavy draught classes, a number of sires and
dams of the “ Clydesdale,” “ Shire,” and “ Suffolk Punch” breeds
ha\ e been from time to time imported—to use a stock phrase—“ reg’ard-
less of cost,” so that as fine a stamp of draught horses are to be met with
as “at home.” Pure bred stock of course run into fancy prices, but
good serviceable horses for plough or dray can be now bought for £5
to £lO, although a few years ago they fetched double the present price.
Of light harness we have some excellent, as well as indifferent,
examples. Sires of such breeds as the “Cleveland Bay,” “Roadster,”
and “ Norfolk Trotter” are to be found scattered over the Colony, and
can generally be obtained for breeding purposes for a small fee, but
frequently owing to apathy these advantages are not availed of, a loose
system of letting inferior stallions run with the mares is followed, and bad
stock results. In Coachers and Hunters growing interest is exhibited,
and is being fostered by handsome prizes for excellence in these classes
given at the annual meetings of the National Agricultural and Industrial
Association of Queensland, at Bowen Park, Brisbane.
Of coachers, both Yorkshires and Cleveland Bays are found here, and
a really excellent class of stock is growing up.
Although we have a small number of Arab and other thoroughbreds
by far the most numerous class is the “hack.” Here also is the widest
range as regards quality and—consequently—price. Saddle horses—the
progeny of full blooded sires and sturdy mares—are worth £8 to £ls, but
it is a common occurrence to see a fairly staunch unbroken colt go for a
couple of sovereigns in one of the numerous auction sale-yards. The
hardiness of some of these “ scrubbers” is, however, great; many of them
being capable of carrying their riders 50 miles a day for a week at
a stretch without sustaining any injury. In point of size this section
of our horses equal the best to be found in the Old World, their height
varying from to 17 hands—with breadth in proportion. In the less
densely populated districts, mobs of unbranded horses—the descendants of
a mixed lot, mostly those which have eluded station control—roam in
a more or less wild state ; these are occasionally caught and sent to
auction, where they are dubbed “ brumbies,” and although a few turn out
to be serviceable beasts, the unsophisticated have often bitter cause
to bewail their purchase. Horse riding is so common a practice, and
horse flesh is comparatively so cheap, that an astounding number of horses
change hands at the sale yards. It is in the matter of race horses that
Australia, and Queensland as much as her neighbours, has made the
greatest progress, and in which a never dying and national interest
is taken. It is a matter for regret that so noble a sight and inspiriting a


sport as horse-racing should be made an occasion for the gambling spirit,
which is so common an adjunct to the “ turf,” but great as the evil still
is, legislative attention has been already directed to this matter with
a measure of success, and I hope will at some no very distant date still
further seek to wipe out in our Colony this world-wide stain on the
grandest of sports. A few specimens of mules are to be met with, but
owing probably to the absence—speaking generally—of rugged country,
such as they are specially suited for, the breeding of this class of stock
has not been engaged in, and I do not think it is likely to be.
As regards Export, many attempts have been made to establish
a regular trade in horses with other parts of the Globe less favorably
situated for breeding, and although some few shipments to India from
this Colony (and to Great Britain from the adjacent Colony of New South
Wales) have been successful, the percentage of returns —owing to losses,
cost of feed and attendance during the voyage —have so far prevented
the trade being put on a sound footing. That a market exists for well-
conditioned, staunch stock is evidenced by the fact that a shipment
in November last ex Sydney per “ Southern Cross” averaged £2O per
head landed in London, and hacks per “ Gulf of Lions” brought £2O 10s.
od. to £27 14s. Od. each. The second great obstacle to this outlet for our
surplus, lies in the great disfigurement entailed by our system of
branding; but as this is a matter which is certainly remediable, we
may look forward to its removal when our surplus really necessitates
the finding of an outside market. At the present time the number
of horses is not much in excess of the requirements for station and
general use, and occasional inquiries for military purposes from India
and very recently from the seat of war in the Philippines —tending to
reduce the above, no serious apprehensions regarding this matter need at
present be entertained.
CATTLE.
Starting from the year 1844, when there were said to be some
18,000 head of cattle in what afterwards was to become Queensland, the
number of these rapidly increased to 87,000 odd in 1847. By the end of
1859 (the date of Separation) they reached 800,000 in number, in 1865
they amounted to 848,346 and at date of last returns (December 1895) to
6,822,401. That such an enormous growth of stock should necessitate an
extensive market goes without saying, and whilst for the first few years
this was found in local requirements and in shortages amongst the
Southern Colonies, the increased attention paid in the latter to stock
breeding soon closed that market to any but their locally raised cattle and
sheep, and Queensland was obliged to look further afield.
Amongst cattle bred for beef, the chief are of Durham and Shorthorn
origin ; there are, however, a few Hereford and Devon crosses, and


Aberdeen Angus polled cattle to be met with. As showing the capabilities
of the favorite Shorthorn, I quote the following from a paper by Mr
Peberdy —a stock owner of large experience—read at the Bockhampton
Conference in May, 1891 : —“ In the old days when there was no truck-
ing of stock, it was a common thing for Durham oxen, descended from
the best herds on the Bulloo and Cooper’s Creek, to march from their
homes to Melbourne—from 1,000 to 1,200 miles—and there compete with
and frequently beat, cattle raised on the best Victorian pasturage within
100 miles of the yards. Personally I have known Durham cattle to
travel through Queensland to Melbourne , the journey occupying over
forty weeks , and then some of the draft carried in a greater weight of beef
upon their frames than I ever saw upon the frame of a scion of one
of the competing breeds that had been bred and fed at large upon
Australian pasture. To particularise a few instances of extreme hardship
I have known Durham cattle to suffer, I may mention that some years
back several drafts of Western Queensland cattle had to make three
consecutive dry stages —viz., forty miles , thirty miles, and seventy miles.
Following these came a draft from one of the heaviest-fleshed Durham
herds in Western Queensland. Before they reached the end of the
seventy-mile stage the water had failed, and they had to make upwards of
of 100 miles vnthout a drink. All of these drafts accomplished the
task set them without loss or damage, and were marketed, at the
completion of a 1,000-mile journey, prime fat, the last draft averaging
over £lO per head.” The class of cattle found in dairy herds still
leaves much to be desired, but great improvements are being effected
amongst intelligent dairymen’s stock by the introduction of imported and
pedigree Jersey, Alderney, Brittany, and Ayrshire bulls. I may refer to
this in dealing with the subject of Dairy Products.
The prices of cattle vary much, according to breed and nature
of the season. No idea of the values of pedigree beasts can be
given, although Australian squatters have been known to pay £1,500
or £2,000 for a bull, but the price of ordinary stores of from two to
three years of age is at present 255. to 855., whilst fat cattle are worth on
trucks at inland railway stations from 50s. to 60s. ; and cows, 80s. to 40s.
Cows in milk range from £8 10s. Od. to £6. At the Enoggera yards,
Brisbane, values are of course higher. On the 21st January, 1897,
prime fat bullocks realised £8 12s. 6d. to £4 ss. Od.; medium, £8 to
£8 7s. 6d. ; best cows, (dry) fetched £2 7s. 6d. to £8; others from
£1 17s. 6d. to £2 2s. 6d. For statistical purposes the Colony is divided
into Southern, Central and Northern divisions. The first named carries
by far tbe greatest number, whilst the Central district has the smallest
number of the three. Owing to inclement seasons, the large increases
which seem to have obtained in early days (when only the pick of
the country was occupied) have not been maintained, a year or two

of high percentages being generally followed by a similar period of
depression (drought or flood), and I regret that in 1895 there was a small
decrease m cattle of 2*72 °/ 0 (although on the whole there was a gam in
stock of all kinds).
SHEEP.
The introduction of these, about the year 1840, formed the foundation
of the great squatting interests of to-day ; the term “ squatter ” (literally
—“ one who sits down,”) having been first applied in ’42 to pastoralists
generally, and since retained by them.
The total number of sheep in Mr. Leslie’s pioneer flock was little more
than 5,600, comprising about 4,000 ewes, 1,500 wethers, and 100 rams ;
by the year 1847 the number in the Colony was 536,580 ; by 1859 it was
2,000,000; by 1865, 6,594,996; and 1895 live stock statistics show the
number at the end of that year to have been 19,856,959, or an increase of
over two hundred per cent, on the 1865 figures ! As in the case of cattle,
this growth is in the face of the heavy “draws” made upon both classes of
stock for home consumption (estimated for 1895 at 226,426 cattle, and
905,704 sheep), by losses from bad seasons, and those killed for export, so
that the natural increase must be set down at a much higher figure than
is given above.
The principal breed is unquestionably the Merino, of which the clip
has often commanded very great attention in the home markets. The
early history of the establishment in the parent Colony of this breed is of
great interest to Queenslanders, for it may be accepted as an undoubted
fact that its adaptability to New South Wales conditions had much to do
with the favour it found with our own pastoralists.
From a work by Mr. G. W. Griffin, of Sydney, published by
direction of the Colonial Treasurer of New South Wales, I gather that
the first importation of Merinos was made by Captain McArthur in 1797.
These few Spanish Merinos were supplemented in 1804 by further
purchases from the Royal Stud at Hampton Court, the prices paid
ranging from £6 to £2B per head. The weight of fleece of the highest
priced beast being 7 lbs. 12 ozs. at date of shearing previous to the sale.
b rench and American sheep of this breed—each having their own
peculiar excellencies—were in the first instance imported into Victoria
about the date of our formation into a separate Colony, and doubtless
contributed to the high quality of Merino stock throughout the Colonies.
At a sale of Rambouillet or French Merino rams in 1861 by Messrs. R.
Goldsborough and Co., an average price of £B3 per head was obtained for
50 head. Of our own flocks, probably the most notable is that of Mr.
Wm. Allen, of Braeside, Dalveen. In colour these sheep differ from the


ordinary Merino —being almost exclusively black and are hardier and
more active than the white breed. The wool has now made itself a very
high name in the Colonial and home markets, and will probably lead to a
spread of this strain of Merino.
Besides the above, a variety of coarse woolled breeds, such as
Lincolns, Leicesters, Cotswolds, Shropshire Downs, and South Down,
are in the Colony—besides crosses of the Merino.
A remarkable and beneficial change has during the past few years
overtaken this branch of the pastoral industry, for, whilst in the early
days it was in the hands of a very small number of men, we find almost
uniformly on looking at the statistics of the past five years that the
“A Pastoral Triumph"—The record load of 101 bales of wool passing

number of owners has increased, and the average size of docks has
decreased. The net number of sheep in the Colony after home consump-
tion, losses, and export had been met, were in 1898, 1894, and 1895, less
than in either of the two preceding years—which were exceptionally good
ones. As regards the distribution over the Colony, something may be
said. Out of the 98 Petty Sessions Districts, as shown in the Registrar-
General’s 1895 Report on Agriculture and Live Stock, only eight are
without sheep; in thirty-nine districts the number per district is under


1,000 ; in eight districts the number is just over or just under the million;
the remaining forty-three districts have anything between 1,000 and
1,000,000. Very few are found in the Northern portion of Queensland,
18,246,907 being in the Southern and Central. Nearly eleven million
sheep—or more than half the total number in the Colony—are found in
the Petty Sessions Districts of Cunnamulla, Hughenden, Longreach,
Muttaburra, St. George, Winton, Blackall, and Barcaldine, so that there
may be said to be unlimited room for the extension of the industry ;
provided, of course, that the market is first secured. Only a very
superficial idea of the price at which stock will sell can be given in these
pages ; breed, time from last shearing, and nature of the season affect
values to an enormous extent. The following extract from the “Brisbane
Courier,” of 29th January, 1897, will give a fair idea of recent sales :
“ The weekly stock sales at the Enoggera yards yesterday afternoon
opened to a small attendance of local buyers, and right throughout the
market was exceedingly dull, with a consequent large fall in prices. About
4160 sheep were penned. The Jondaryan sheep were the first offered, and
all of the crossbreds were cleared at from 6s. 6d. to 75., and to Bs. 6d. for
one small pen, but only a few of the merino wethers were sold, from ss. to
ss. 9d., the balance being withdrawn. East Prairie merino wethers sold from
Bs. to Bs. 6d.; merino ewes at Bs., crossbred wethers at 55., and crossbred
ewes at 4s. Bd. Merino wethers from Ellington, a small draft, fetched
ss. 9d., and from 4s. 6d. was given for another lot of merino wethers from
East Prairie. St. Helens merino wethers were worth from 4s, to 55.;
Jimbour crossbred ewes made from 4s. 9d. to ss. 6d., and a small pen of
five reached Bs. 6d., while merino wethers from the same establishment
found buyers at Bs. 9d. to 55., some of the best of them being withdrawn.
For crossbred wethers from Darkie Flat ss. to ss. 9d. was paid, and a
picked pen realised Bs. 9d., and Eton Vale crossbred wethers were placed
at 4s. 9d. to 6d. 6d. From ss. to 7s. 9d. was given for merino wethers
from Kurrawah, and from 3s. 3d. to 4s. for merino wethers from Spring
Meadows ; while Logie Plains merino wethers were worth from 4s. 6d. to
4s. 9d. ; and Headington Hill merino wethers from ss. to ss. 9d. A fair
indication of the low state of the market was afforded by the comparatively
small values received for the Yandilla draft of merino wethers; prime-
conditioned sheep, which a month or two ago found ready purchasers at
from Bs. to 10s. 6d., going badly at ss. 6d. to 6s. 9d. One pen of cross-
breds from the same place made Bs. Back Plains crossbred wethers were
marketable at 7s. 3d. to Bs.; and Bowenville merinos fetched from 3s. to
4s. 3d.; while the whole of the Clifton draft was withdrawn from sale.”
Another report from Rockhampton puts the value of young sheep at
the opening of the year (1892) at 3s. to 45., according to age, sex, and
quality.


PIGS.
Thanks to the establishment in our midst of several bacon-curing
factories with first-class plants, and to the success attending the efforts of
the travelling dairy to widen the scope of our dairy operations (with which
pig-raising is generally associated), a very large and increasing interest is
being taken in this class of live stock.
Both in point of numbers and breed, great changes are taking place.
In 1847 there were but 200 in “ Moreton Bay settlementwe now have
100,747 (1895) —an increase on 1894 of about one-eighth—and this is still
under one-third of the number which the smaller colonies of Victoria, New
Zealand, and New South Wales each possess. The increase from 1898
to 1894 was even more marked, being at the rate of 81.71 % for the
year.
According to the latest available official returns (1895) the districts
where the chief progress was made in the twelve months and the respective
increases are as follows :—Marburg, an increase of 1166 head; Brisbane,
1000; Toowoomba, 825 ; Gatton, 762; Crow’s Nest, 759. Of the total
Petty Sessions Districts, none were wuthout “ grunters';” but the practice
of pig-keeping on a large scale seems to be confined to a few districts, of
which the following may be mentioned as contributing 45,425 head—not
far from half the total number :—Toowoomba, 5544 ; Rockhampton,
5331; Gatton, 4718 ; Beaudesert, 4515 ; Warwick. 3902 ; Laidley, 3868 ;
Dugandan, 3549; Brisbane, 3540; South Brisbane, 3436; Rosewood,
8068 ; Marburg, 2534 ; Crow’s Nest, 1420.
The breed which has been found most suitable to the climate, and
which is preferred by buyers, is the Berkshire. But a few years ago this
was a comparatively unknown sort; several imported specimens were,
however, distributed throughout the colony by the efforts of the Govern-
ment, bacon factory owners, and others—with the result that strains of
this pig can be purchased in almost any tow r n.
The Yorkshire, China, and other breeds common in Great Britain
are to be met with, but they are not suited to factory requirements in this
colony. Speaking broadly, their disability does not lie so much in size,
or colour, as in their tendency to put on excessive fat. Contrary to public
taste in the United Kingdom, and in most cold countries, the demand in
Queensland is for lean meat, and reasonably so.
The price of pigs fluctuates somewhat according to the law of supply
and demand, and is controlled by the various factories. The system
generally adopted is for a buyer to go round each district in the interests
of the factory, offer his 20s. to 275. for all well shaped beasts of lOOlbs. to
1601b5., and make arrangements for the farmers to deliver (free of cost at
the railway trucks, or other “ rendezvous”) any he may feel disposed to


sell at the price. Sometimes the buyer is one of the factory staff, but
oftener he is a resident in the district, and is paid a bonus of Is. or so on
each pig he purchases. So far, there has never been a serious glut in this
market, and in 1895 some nine tons of pig products (principally hams and
bacon) were imported for our own consumption, so that there is plenty of
room for the extension of this industry with a view to home, but more
especially —foreign trade. The ratio of pigs to population is still very
small—about as 1 to 4| —but considering the utility of this animal as
farm scavenger, his remarkable freedom in this country from disease, and
the heavy protective duty—ld. per lb. for salt pork, 3d. per lb. for hams
and bacon—which pig products from outside have to pay, the practice of
pig raising should, and is likely to, be much more general than it is at
present. On some of the stations in the Moreton district, notably Buaraba,
there used to be in former years, and I believe still are, large numbers of
wild swine, the descendants of some which had apparently got away into
the dense scrub, beyond the control of their owners, and had thus laid the
foundation of subsequent droves. Similarly, on the Pioneer and Herbert
rivers, &c., in the North, numbers are to be found roaming at large in the
scrubs, the property of anyone who takes the trouble to shoot them.
I may remark that these are the only class of live stock not required
by law to be registered ; even goats needing a registration fee of ss. and a
distinguishing mark within the precincts of the Brisbane and most other
municipalities. The number of pigs per square mile averages about -15.
EXPORT OF LIVE STOCK.
In view of the probable early renewal of efforts to establish this trade
—under more favourable conditions than hitherto—the following figures
from a report of some shipments from Sydney, in January, of 1895, may
be of interest to our readers ; the conditions being about equal in this and
the neighbouring colony:—The freight averaged £6 6s. a head, the
fodder £2 125., and other expenses brought the expenditure in Sydney up
to £9 15s. Id. a head. Putting down their selling value in Sydney at £5
would make their cost to the consignors £l4 15s. Id. per head. The
twenty-five bullocks were sold in London towards the close of February
for an average of £2l 12s. Id., less £2 9s. 2d. per head for London
charges.
Some nine head of Devons were very highly spoken of as being good
travellers, and “ dressing out” well at the Deptford yards. These were
of medium weight, and it was conceded that small, young cattle of the
same quality would always command a ready sale at prices equal to the
best American.

SUGAR.
Of agricultural products, this is our most important article of export
—a position which it has held for many years. In point of area, sugar
growing is accountable for 77,247 out of a total of 285,819 acres under
crop in 1895, and takes second place in this respect—maize being the
favourite crop. During the ten years ending 1895, both area under cane
and area crushed for sugar have increased steadily, the latter from 34,657
acres in 1886 to 55,774 acres in 1895—equal to 61% advance. Failing
official figures up to 31st December, 1896, it is impossible to give an
accurate statement of the relative position of the industry in that year.
The extent of land under sugar cultivation in the colony on 30th June,
1896, was returned as 84,883 acres, or an increase of 7489 acres over the
preceeding year. The increased areas planted are situated in the Logan,
Brisbane, Maryborough and Childers, Burdekin, Cairns, and Port Douglas
districts. An estimate prior to the opening of the 1896-7 crushing season
gave the area available for crushing to be 71,975 acres, which is an
increase on 1895 of 16,000 acres odd, and would mean —on the basis of
the sugar production of that year —some 25,000 tons more sugar. The
Sugar Journal, Mackay, gives the 1896 output as 98,000 tons, but the
production in 1894—91,712 tons—is the largest officially recorded, as is
the average return per acre of cane which was crushed, viz. : 1*84 tons
per acre. The year 1895 ranks next with 86,255 tons, at the rate of 1-55
tons per acre; this would give a return —according to Mr. Weedon—of
£18 per acre (export price). The above ratio happens to be that for the
ten years 1885—1895, and shows an advance of nearly a quarter of a ton
(say £2 10s,) per acre upon the mean average return for 1875 —1885.
Estimating the value still upon the 1895 basis (although much higher
values than £12 per ton prevailed during most of the time), and reckoning
the average number of acres crushed between 1885 and 1895 to be 40,000,
this represents a gain of £100,000 which can only be attributed to better
methods of growing and manufacturing.
These have undergone most important and, it is generally considered,
beneficial changes. Although the quantity of cane grown was at first
small, only 608 acres being utilized in this manner in 1866, its cultiva-
tion was, until quite recently, confined to planters with considerable capital,
who more often than not owned the mill to which the cane was delivered.
The indifferent quality of many of the makes of sugar, low prices,


threatened competition, and unwieldy nature of many of the sugar estates
led to a consideration of means to be adopted for the revival of the indus-
try. Large plantations have been subdivided, and sold on the most
liberal terms to farmers, with the understanding that the vendor binds
himself to take from the purchaser at a fixed price per ton all the cane
the latter can raise. In addition to this step, the Sugar Works Guarantee
Acts 1893 to 1895, which came into operation early in 1894, have enabled
groups of cane farmers to combine for the purpose of erecting mills of the
latest type, so that greater economy in production may result. Up to the
80th June, 1896, eight central mills had received an aggregate advance of
£201,679 175., since then others have been erected, or are in course of
erection, at a cost of another £IOO,OOO or so, which sums are, (or will be)
secured upon the joint and private freehold property of the shareholders,
and in some cases by debentures, insurance policies, bonds, &c.
The following account from a recent Courier of the Proserpine, near
Bowen, said to be the largest—as it is one of the latest erected—central
mills, will be of interest: —
“ The mill occupies a fairly central site on the south bank of the
river, and is connected by tramway with a landing wharf five miles
distant. The tram line, constructed by Mr. A. Mackenzie, of Bowen, was
completed a few days before last Christmas. Unlike the central mill at
Plane Creek, in the Mackay district, which has suffered much delay from
a short supply of water in this its first season, the location of this mill
seems to have been judiciously chosen, and a practically inexhaustible
supply of water assured. The capacity of the new mill is 5000 tons, and
with more cultivation, Mr. Fiddes, the Government engineer under the
Sugar Works Guarantee Act, who has frequently visited this district since
building operations commenced, has expressed the opinion that its capa-
city may be raised to 8000 tons each season. The machinery has been
supplied and erected by Messrs. Walker Limited, Maryborough, whose
work in connection with central mills is well known throughout the
colony.
The composition of the settlement is decidedly heterogeneous, em-
bodying English, Scotch, Irish, German, Danes, Swedes, &c. They
number slightly in excess of 400, and some idea of the progress made in
cane-growing may be elicited from the fact that already 900 acres are
under cane, all of which—should no undesirable flood or other visitant
make its presence felt —is expected to yield at least 1500 tons of sugar
next season. Mera, Rose Bamboo, and Striped Bamboo are the canes
most in favour here.”
In reviewing the year just closed, the above daily says : —“ The
mills erected under the Sugar Works Guarantee Act have been
steadily establishing themselves ; and a commercial start was


made in those ready to take advantage of the crushing
season. One feature of the year has been the increase in
number of small sugar farms, to supply which a large quantity of plant
cane has been required ; and, in order to meet the demand, it has been
found necessary to add to the area under plant cane at the State Nurseries.
The Department of Agriculture obtained from New Guinea a quantity of
different varieties of cane. These, after propagation, will be distributed,
and should they prove to be of equal worth to those formerly imported
from the Possession and placed in the ha*nds of canegrowers, the addi-
tions to the varieties of Queensland cane will be of great importance.
The central sugar mills at Mackay—the pioneers of the central mill system
• —continue to progress , and are now more than able to hold, their own. All
liabilities to date have been paid to the Government , and a dividend was
declared .”
Speaking of the latter, Mr. R. W. McCulloch, inspector under the
Act, said a few weeks ago :
“ A worse time could not have been selected for establishing central
mills than when the first two —the Pleystowe and the Marian—started in
the Mackay district. The two successive seasons have been exceedingly
adverse, but, notwithstanding this, both the companies have been able to
make good their interest. The Southern central mills have had a severe
winter to contend against, yet they have been able to pay interest, and
have credit balances of from £I2OO to £ISOO each. My impression of
central mills is that they must come out all right. The mere fact of their
being co-operative concerns will insure their being worked to the best ad-
vantage for both sides. They are all of the most modern design, and can
make a ton of sugar from as low a number of tons of cane as any other
mills in any part of the world. Given fair seasons, I have not the
slightest doubt of them meeting their engagements. One great thing
they have achieved is to bring about a very considerable settlement on the
lands around each.”
In 1896 seven of these mills had crushings—two of them for their
second season. The amount of sugar made by them may be put down as
follows:—Nerang, 780 tons; Mount Baupple, 1,050; Gin Gin, 1,050;
Plane Creek, 400; Pleystowe, 1,088; Marian, 1,816; Mulgrave, 750.
Until the figures showing the cost of manufacture and quality of the sugar
made are published, it would be impossible to say of the mills whether
they will be able to meet their interest liabilities to the Government.
With the exception, possibly, of Plane Creek mills—owing to small out-
put —these should be in a position to do so without difficulty.
According to the Sugar Journal’s review of 1896, Nambour could not
work owing to an early frost cutting the crops up. This mill, with the
Isis, Proserpine, and Mossman, should be working next season without


fail. The preliminary steps are now being taken, and the Government
has given a provisional promise as to guarantee, in connection with the
establishment of central mills at Aloomba, Bellenden-Ker, and Jarvisfield.
At present it is expected that these mills will work in 1898.
Without taking account of crushing plants which do not manufacture
their own sugar, there were fifty-three mills at work last year. Of these,
thirteen produced less than 500 tons each, seven over 500 and less than
1,000 tons each, fourteen over 1,000 and less than 2,000, and nineteen
2,000 and over. Several of the factories making under 2,000 tons have a
very much larger capacity, and their low output is due chiefly to their
having only just started, or to a short supply of cane owing to temporary
unfavourable conditions. As far as can be ascertained, the following
are the returns from the various districts :
District. 1894-5. 1895-6. 1896-7.
Estimate. Output.
Tons. Tons. Tons. Tons.
Brisbane ... ... ... 2,650 2,140 3,000 8,700
Maryborough and Isis ... 7,226 10,858 20,000 19,250
Bundaberg and Gin Gin ... 28,618 28,361 30,000 28,700
Rockhampton ... ... 665 1,580 1,500 1,600
Mackay 27,927 23,150 20,000 16,300
Burdekin 8,776 6,477 8,000 6,200
Herbert 13,695 9,900 11,000 10,500
Johnstone ... ... ... 5,215 5,357 7,000 8,500
Cairns 1,940 3,000 8,500 3,250
Total 91,712 85,823 104,000 98,000
From the foregoing it will be seen that the crop realised 6,000 tons less
than was anticipated last June, and this deficit is accounted for by the poor
results from the Burdekin and Mackay districts. On the other hand, the
Johnstone and Herbert districts have fully maintained their positions, and
this is the more satisfactory as the unknown factor of damage from the
grub pest had to be reckoned with to alter results.
The above output for 1896 would represent about 74,000 tons for
export, the average excess of production over export for the last three
years being 23,000 as compared with 20,700 tons (the average for the
three years previous to 1893-4.) There seems little doubt that the con-
sumption of the colony is now well over 22,000 tons per annum, and this
vve understand is partly attributable to the establishment of additional
jam factories in Queensland, and partly to the fact that the local produc-
tion of beer has increased from three anda-quarter million gallons in 1892,
to over four and a-half million gallons in 1895. The cane crop was
estimated to be taken off 71,975 acres, and if this was the area cropped,


the average return per acre would be 1.86 tons. This return is unusually
low, being .18 below that of 1895, and .19 below the annual mean for
the ten years ending 1895. It is likely, therefore, that the official estimate
of the area to be cropped is excessive, and it will probably be found that
not more than between 60,000 and 65,000 acres were cut. If we take the
higher of these two figures, we have a yield per acre for the whole colony
of a ton and a-half per acre, a result which is not very high, but which is
reasonably good under the circumstances.
The price of sugar in the wholesale market is, under the new system,
of very great interest to cane farmers. The Colonial Sugar Refining
Company, who practically control the market, have just notified to the
retail trade a rise of 20s. per ton on all lines except tablets, golden syrup,
and treacle. This means that grocers, &c., are now paying for tablets,
£24 10s.; IB (brewers’ crystals), £l7 10s. ; IX sugar, £l7 ; 1A sugar,
£l7 ; No. 2 sugar, £ls 10s.; No. 8 sugar, £l4 10s. Contrasted with the
average prices of seven or eight year ago, these are very low. As showing
the difference in values even three years back, I may state that in 1894 an
export of 1,298,200 cwt. was valued at £886,834, and in the following
y ear _ a lthough the quantity had increased by nearly 46,000 cwt.—the
total value was only £796,117.
On this subject a writer to the press says : —“ The price of cane has
not been generally reduced. North of the Wide Bay District the farmers
remain for the most part untouched. The exceptions are so few as not to
bulk significantly. Millowners have voluntarily assumed the burden oj
the changed market, not had it forced upon them by concerted pressure on
the part of the growers. This is a very uncommon departure from usual
practice. The explanation is not single or simple, or all on the surface.
Several reasons are in operation. One undoubtedly is the disclosure of
the large profits made by the best mills. All the sophistry the millowners’
intellect is capable of (though the millowners have mostly maintained a
prudent silence) could not efface the deep impression that documents such
as the balance-sheets of the Mackay central mills have made on the farmers
and the public mind. On an output of 3,481 tons of sugar, North Eton
made a profit, allowing for depreciation of plant, of £11,418. Although
the cane cost 15s. 2|d. per ton, the average cost of a ton of sugar, including
Government and Bank interest, was only £8 19s. lOd. At £8 10s. for 88
per cent, sugar, the present price of North Eton sugar would be about £9
ss. The Racecourse mill presented still more impressive figures. The
Homebush (C. S. Cos.) mill is believed to have excelled both results. The
output was more than double that of either of the central mills (a most
important factor in economy of manufacture), the quality of the cane very
high, and the management had the alleged advantage of chemical control
and oCthe experience gained by the largest sugar enterprise in Australia.”

It is a gratifying fact, however, that if the private millowners can
make a profit at the low market rates which have been ruling during
recent years, co-operative enterprise and a large turnover will be able to
withstand a further fall, should such an undesirable event happen.
Of a rise in value there seems little hope, in view of the persistent
efforts being made to establish the sugar-beet in the Southern colonies —
up to the present our sole customers for surplus sugar, we may say.
However, as a set off, there is the prospect of entering the port of Sydney
duty-free at an early date. The only solution of the difficulty appears to
lie in greater economy in production, and, ultimately in reduced prices for
cane. Growers could in most cases accept a lower figure, and still make
a fair living. Many of our scrub lands yield 30 to 40 tons of cane per
acre. The poorest sugar lands yield about 10 tons. Owing to the absence
of a return as to number of tons of cane cut in Queensland, I can only
form an estimate of our average yield of cane per acre from the average
tons of cane required to produce one ton of sugar. This may, I think, be
fairly stated at 10 tons, which on the 1895 basis would mean 15J tons
per acre —a figure comparing favourably with those of New South Wales
for same year, viz., 14 3-7 tons per acre. Cane prices vary; “Homebush”
gives 14s. per ton delivered on the truck at the nearest point of the com-
pany’s tramway, the company providing portable line for field use. The
central mills give about the same price. Other mills in the same district
give lower prices ; but as the conditions of delivery vary, the comparison
is not always easily made. At the Burdekin the price is 11s. at the
rollers. At Cairns it is Bs. standing in the field. I think that dis-
interested investigators must come to the conclusion that the average
price of cane in the North is a high one, and that the growers could
accept a substantial reduction without being compelled to abandon their
occupation. And it is more true of the growers than the millowners that
they have not yet exhausted the resources of economy. A reduction of
price might throw poor land, as it does small and wasteful mills, out of
use, but there is plenty of good sugar land to sustain the industry. Given
good land and good cultivation, and cane-growing would be profitable
though the farmer were called upon to share the burden of a worse than the
existing market. The value of cane to the mill-owner varies according to
the density of the juice, and in this respect it is interesting to compare the
average tons of cane required on Louisiana sugar plantations to produce
a ton of sugar (as exhibited by 202 samples quoted in 1889 by Dr. Peter
Collier, of New York), viz., 13 tons, with our own results at North Eton—
one ton of sugar from about nine tons of cane, and at Mackay —one ton
of sugar to about eight tons of cane. The field labour on the larger
plantations is mostly supplied by “ kanaka boys” ; men who have been
imported from the adjacent South Sea Islands. They are indented for a
period of three years at a stated wage, being fed and housed by the planta-


tion owner, who is responsible for their safety and comfort to the Inspector
of Pacific Islanders in his district. During their time of service under
indenture they are prohibited from working in the factory, or otherwise
usurping the white man’s position. At the end of three years they may
claim their tvages and a free passage back to their island, or may sign on
for a further period. A small proportion of time-expired boys bring their
wives and families with them with a view to making their home here.
Although tribal fights have occurred sometimes, they are by no means a
common occurrence ; indeed, the behaviour of many of these “ boys” is
exemplary.
“Cutting Sugar Cane.”
Amongst what are called “ cane farmers ” (■ i.e . small holders) kanaka
labour is not much utilized ; “ where there’s a will there’s a way,” being
well exemplified in this matter. In the North there may be more grounds
for these importations, but it has now been admitted by sugar authorities
in this colony that the colour line may be drawn at Townsville. Of
course this is largely a matter of opinion. Ido not think that disin-
terested onlookers can doubt that even in tropical Queensland a great deal
of the work in the canefield can be done by white men. They are not
really so physically “ soft ” in high temperatures as is often imagined and
asserted. But some of the work, especially that which must be done
amongst the cane, where the air is still, and the moist heat tremendous


through the summer months, is exceedingly distasteful to the unaccus-
tomed white constitution. Planters, great and small, would get on
badly if they were confined to the white supply. It is very likely that a
substantial proportion of the white labour offering itself in the sugar
districts is of indifferent quality. That is apt to be generally the case in
regard to the floating and shifting labouring population of new countries.
In the course of time, employers may be able to command the services of a
much better class of whites, and, if such occur, it is likely that white
labour will gradually oust the black. What we want are the mutually
helpful elements —more labouring men of the reliable, intelligent class,,
and new industries. The inevitable result will be : By increasing local
consumption and infusing greater intelligence, to assist existing industries,
and in new directions to make us more independent of imported goods,
which are capable of local manufacture. The proportion of Polynesians
to Europeans and other white races has for the past two years been
nearly stationary, and at the end of December 1895 stood at 1-90 per cent.
At that date they numbered 8,094 males and 651 females, of which the
greater number were employed in sugar cultivation. Besides these
there were 3,668 white workmen employed in the 151 crushing and sugar
making mills and refineries of the colony (about 87 of which are used for
crushing only). From all but two of these, returns were received for
1895, showing that £1,050,819 worth of machinery, of 8,227 horse power,
was employed in this industry, and the total value of plant, machinery,
Ac., was £2,192,366. The value of goods manufactured with this outlay
of capital was £906,560.
Although the latter is not so high a figure as that for which the meat
industry is responsible, in point of capital at stake sugar was £1,465,000
ahead of meat at the close of 1895, and it is likely that the difference will
be seen to have increased in 1896, when figures are available. Besides the
mills, there were in 1895 six rum distilleries which produced
from the molasses 111,034 gallons of proof spirit. Apparently only
19,153 gallons were exported, and of this, 5 gallons was sent to the
United Kingdom! About 359 tons of molasses, value £6,2.51 were ex-
ported to our near neighbours, and the balance of the 1,730,591
gallons of molasses (after a portion had been used for rum manufacture)
was converted into “ golden syrup,” or consumed locally in the
raw state. The possibility of finding outlets for our surplus sugar
beyond Australasia has repeatedly engaged the attention of growers
and manufacturers, but so far has not been satisfactorily proved.
Between January Ist and December 31st., 1895 only £5lB worth (ration)
went to the United Kingdom, out of a total export value of £796,117.
The following extract from the Annual Report of the Chief Inspector
of Distilleries—although only made up to 30th June, 1896, in accordance


with the usual practice of his Department—shows the various countries to
which we exported between June, 1894, and June, 1896 :

Total 67,451 62,064
As the quantity of sugar manufactured during the year ended 30th
June, 1896, was 86,255 tons, of which quantity 62,064 tons were
■exported, it will be noted that the sugar available for home consumption
was 24,191 tons, being nearly the same as in the preceding year.
Customs returns show that a small importation of foreign sugar,
amounting to tons, was also received into Queensland during the year
referred to.
It is pleasing, however, to note the Customs Statistics for the
calendar year just ended give the value of the 1896 exports to be
£862,033 or £65,916 more than in 1895, and as the slight rise in
values only took place a few weeks ago, this should represent a
substantial increase in tonnage over 1895.
Of probable buyers, the United Kingdom is by far the largest
■consumer of cane sugar, of which she imported in 1895, no less value than
£31,058,923. In 1887 the United States imported 84% of their sugar,
equal to about 1,258,000 tons. Their consumption of this commodity per
cap. was at that time 55-84 pounds, and this increased to 60 pounds in
1890. I have not the figures for recent years, but, according to a state-
ment in 1888 of the United States Consul in Sydney, the import into the
States about that time would appear to be nearly 1,000,000 tons more than
the above figures for 1887, and it is significant that whilst the population'of
the United States and the rate of sugar consumption per cap. are on the
increase, this particular industry—although artificially protected by a high
tariff—is not in nearly so flourishing a condition there now as it was
thirty to forty-five years ago. In fact, it has been stated that the United
States consumes fully one-fourth of the sugar product of the world. At
the present time the issue of the crisis in the British West Indies will be
awaited with much interest by this colony, especially as the Royal


Commission, which has been appointed to investigate the causes of the
depression, is presided over by our much beloved ex-Governor—Sir Henry
Wylie Norman. Besides the two large consumers above mentioned, the
Dominion of Canada, portions of South America, and even of Continental
Europe, China and Japan, would offer an extensive market for this
product if greater economies in production could be practised, and tariffs
did not prevent; or, should the bounty on beet sngar be removed—as has
recently been rumoured. I have shown that our own consumption
of sugar is only about one-fourth of the production, and is already much
greater per person than that of most peoples, being 95 lbs. or over
per cap. A large accession of population would therefore affect this
industry only to a very slight extent, from which it is clear that oversea
markets are of as great importance in this matter as in the case of, say,
meat and dairy products. Even if the threatened competition from
Australian beet sugar should be delayed a few years, it is only a matter of
time when the production of cane sugar on this continent will more than
cover the consumption, which is at present stated to be some 200,000 tons
per annum.
The cultivation of sugar cane here, is carried on over a very wide area
of coast lands ; from Port Douglas, in latitude 16° 30', to the southermost
boundary, in latitude 28° B'. The number of Petty Sessions Districts which
have an interest in the industry here are 19, of which Mackay stood at
the head in 1895 with 20,544 acres under crop ; Bundaberg being a very
close second (19,589 acres.) With regard to area crushed and sugar pro-
duct, the position is reversed ; Bundaberg sent the cane from 16,349 acres
to the mill, for a return of 24,162 tons, whilst Mackay crushed the cane
off 15,566 acres, and made 22,839 tons of sugar. The return of sugar to
the acre is thus 1.48 and 1.47 tons respectively. The highest yield was
in the Maryborough district—2 tons per acre. The port from which the
heaviest shipments were made in the year just closed is Bundaberg;
£301,834 worth left that place—nearly double the value of the shipments
from Mackay, of which the sugar export for 1896 was valued at £155,869.
The port of Dungeness contributed sugar worth £106,481 ; Geraldton
£78,554 and Townsville £75,890.
In the districts of Ayr, Cairns, and Mackay, irrigation has been
practised with some excellent results, and it is to be hoped that cane-
growers as a whole will recognise the advisability of following this
practice in all but exceptionally favoured localities. According to the
Registrar-General’s Report for 1895, over 5,000 acres (mostly cane) were
irrigated in these three districts, but unfortunately a large area at
the first named place suffered from a flood in January of that year —thus
nullifying any advantage it would otherwise have derived from irrigation.


MAIZE.
As in the United States, a greater area of land is devoted to this
crop than to any other. This has been so for many years, and may, in
both cases, be accounted for by its adaptability to a wide range of climate
and soil, freedom from disease, easy cultivation and the small expense
incidental to harvesting the crop. However that may be, it is
generally the settler’s first, and often his staple, crop.
About one-third of the land under cultivation in Queensland in
1895 was “in corn,” and the proportion in the United States is even
greater. During the ten years ended December, 1895, the area for that
year (100,481 acres) was exceeded twice ; in 1894 by 8,190 acres, and in:
1891 by 1,117 acres. The ratio of maize land to total cultivation inr
1888 was rather better than two-fifths, but as the area under wheat has
trebled since that year, it is conceivable that a portion of the last-men-
tioned crop is being raised by former maize growers. The extension of
sugar has also checked this crop. Besides the 100,481 acres planted in
1895 for grain, 1862 acres were planted for green food for cattle, and it
is satisfactory to note a considerable extension of the practice of hand
feeding, as exhibited by the increased area of this and other green feeds.
The average yield of grain per acre for the whole colony was 28*80
bushels in 1895 and 25*90 in 1894, the latter return being only once ex-
ceeded in thirteen years, viz.: in 1891, (80*3 bushels per acre). The
mean average yield in New York State (U.S.A.) during a quarter of a
century has been stated at 30*73 bushels. The relatively low prices
which of late years have been realised for maize have, doubtless, been in
a measure caused by overproduction, in which belief a section of growers!’
have turned their attention elsewhere. That this is by no means the sole
cause of the fall is shown by the fact that in 1895—notwithstanding an
import duty of Bd. per bushel—ll3,7B2 bushels (worth £18,466) were)
landed here from New South Wales, Victoria, and New Zealand. As the I
fluctations in the maize market have been considerable, much interest)
attaches to any method of storing the grain, and many systems have been
tried, with more or less success. Judging from the comparative absence!'
during 1895 of glutted markets, such as in former years paralyzed the!
trade, the holding of corn has been made possible by artificial means, scl
that a still steadier—if low —market may be looked for in the!
future.
This cereal is cultivated in 29 districts, extending over 12 degrees ol
latitude and 8 degrees of longitude. The heaviest returns for 1895 were <
obtained at Cairns, in the north, and Gin Gin, in the south, which j
obtained an average of 40*10 and 41*22 bushels per acre, over each
district, respectively. In only 3 districts—all in the south of the colony—
was the yield under 20 bushels per acre, but as two of these were fairlj


large producers, their low averages materially lowered that of the colony.
Of districts producing over 100,000 bushels in 1895, there were the fol-
lowing; in order of precedence: —Warwick, Laidley, Toowoomba, High-
fields, Gatton, Dugandan, Allora and Harrisville.
The total yield for the colony in 1895 was 2,391,878 bushels. Not
only has the area under cultivation increased considerably during the
decennium, but a marked improvement is apparent in thirteen of the
principal districts, as to the average number of bushels per acre in
1891-1895 compared with 1886-1890. The largest increase in 1895,
as regards area planted, was in the Gatton district—9Bs acres; as regards
yield of grain, Allora stands at the head of the list with an increase of
32,826 bushels.
With regard to the prospects at the beginning of this year in the
last-mentioned district, a correspondent stated that the crops ranged
from 10ft. downwards, and that there was every indication of a re-
cord yield. From one of the cultivations a cob was cut, which
measured 8 inches in circumference and 14 inches in length ; the grain
was large and even.
The following are some highly interesting remarks from the pen of
Professor Shelton, which appeared in the “ Brisbane Courier,” respecting
a trip made by him through what is known as the Fassifern district
(about covering the petty sessions district of Dugandan) ; the visit took
place on the 22nd and 23rd of December, 1896, when the forward state of
the crop promised a bountiful and early harvest, so that his statements on
the subject of this crop and methods of disposal have in addition to the
advantage of a long experience in one of the chief maize growing
countries of the world —the United States of America—especial weight
as being the outcome of an intimate knowledge of local conditions,
acquired in his official capacity of Instructor in Agriculture to this colony :
“ The first thing which strikes one in this district is the extent and
extraordinary promise of the maize crop. It seems now perfectly certain
that the early and late, and what may be called the intermediate crop,
will alike give a full yield of the highest quality of grain. What may be
seen in the way of corn-growing upon the prairies of Illinois and Kansas
can in a small way be viewed, at this time, from any commanding
position in the Fassifern. Everywhere the rank, purple growth of
maize covers hilltop and valley alike. Every field that has received
anything approaching attention in cultivation is up to the high-water
mark of cropping and promise of productiveness. ....
“ Upon the possibilities of utilising the Queensland maize crop, I
wish to advert briefly. In the first place, a glut in any one crop, be it
maize, wheat or potatoes, is a possibility in every agricultural community


the world over. We have only to turn in memory back two years to see
the Queensland wheat crop sacrificed at prices, to the farmer, often con-
siderably under 2s. per bushel. In America, quite as much as in Queens-
land, the farmer has learnt the painful lesson furnished by overstocked
markets in some particular crop. I have myself, more than once, seen
great crops of maize rushed upon the market at prices very much below
Is. per bushel in English money, and it always will be thus until
farmers learn, by experience, that to grow altogether, or even largely, of
of some one crop is always hazardous and frequently disastrous.
“ Cultivators will need to learn that to sell a crop or product
directly upon the market is not always the most profitable of the means
available to them by which that croj? may be converted into cash. The
American farmer, for instance, has learned that the corn crop may be con-
verted into pork or beef (impossible here), or in a dairy district, the
whole crop of maize may be made into ensilage, which again is con-
verted into high-priced milk and butter during the winter months fol-
lowing. Let us look briefly at certain of the methods open to Queens-
land farmers for marketing profitably the present maize crop.
THE EXPORTATION OF MAIZE.
“It is often urged that we may reasonably look to foreign markets for
an outlet for our superfluous crop of corn. This is a matter which the
Agricultural Department has frequently had occasion to study in recent
years with a view to alleviating to some extent the pressure of this par-
ticular crop. As a general thing, and with rare exceptions, lam satis-
fied, the Queensland-grown maize cannot be exported to London with
the hope of profit. Our farmers, even in such favoured regions as the
Fassifern Scrub, cannot produce maize so cheaply as their brethren and
rivals upon the Western States of America. I need not go into
details here. It is quite sufficient to state the fact. Some day, when our
lands are cleared and stumped and the fields are larger, and we learn to
make greater use of machinery, we may expect to alter the condition of
things, but the facts at present are as above stated. It is alike doubtful
if, during most years, we can compete with the States of the Balkan
Peninsula, which supply, more than any other country, the maize which
finds its way to the London market. For these reasons it seems clear to
me that the hope of relief from the exportation of maize may not
generally be entertained. Occasionally, with the scarcity of the crop
in America or in Roumania, it might be done, but with the crops re-
ported in America the present year, I conceive it to be hopeless.
TANKING.
“ It is possible, as shown by a wide and very varied experience in all
parts of the colony, to put up well-dried maize in air-tight tanks with
the assurance of its safe keeping. Many farmers follow the practice now,


and merchants and speculators have been doing it for years past, often
reaping considerable profits for their enterprise. It may always be
questioned whether the farmer is justified in speculating even in his own
crops and products, but when prices touch the very low levels to which
this crop often attains, I believe that the cultivator is justified in pre-
serving his crop for a rise which, judging by past experience, is inevit-
able. The cost however, of tanking is considerable, but there is little
doubt that when the price gets below Is. per bushel, the returns fully
justify the outlay. To preserve the crop in this way is sure to be a prac-
tice limited in its operation. It is only here and there, in the case of the
fore-handed farmer, that resort will be had to a practice which com-
mends itself rather to the merchant and grain dealer than to the man of
the farm.
FEEDING THE CROP TO PIGS.
“ This is the great resort of the Yankee corngrower, and the practice
of pig-feeding deserves in Queensland a much wider application than
hitherto it has received. My own experiments in America, made upon a
large scale, and covering several years of operations with those of
Dr. Miles and others, show conclusively that a bushel of shelled maize
may be expected to produce somewhere between 101 b. and 121 b. of in-
crease in the pigs to which it is fed. Taking Queensland values for the
live weight of pigs, which at the present time is approximately 2d. per
lb., we have a return of about 2s. per bushel for the crop thus fed ; with
the best quality of pigs, something better might be done. Perhaps
inferior ones would do rather less for the farmer in feeding. This
certainly will be counted a very handsome return for the maize and the
trouble involved in feeding the pigs. The cost of marketing the pork is
certainly very much less than the cost of carrying the crop to the nearest
railway station.
• THE USE OF ENSILAGE IN DAIRYING.
“ Very few Queensland farmers realise the enormous possibilities of
the maize crop in the production of cheap and abundant supplies of this
most nutritious fodder. Corn, whether put up in the shape of dried
fodder, as is done so commonly in America, and to a certain extent in
Queensland, or ensilaged according to the more modern practice, has
feeding possibilities beyond the dreams of our stockowners
Why should not this great, and for the present almost worthless maize
crop be set aside for the needs of next winter? Why should not our
farmers put themselves in such a position that, when milk brings 4d.
to sd. per gallon, as it almost certainly will during the coming winter
season, they may be prepared to reap the golden harvest that falls in
the lap of the fore-handed dairyman ? ”
From the above remarks we gather that Queensland farmers have by


no means exhausted the method now available of turning to profitable
account this important product of the land,, and I feel convinced that be-
sides the methods mentioned by the Professor, a study of the problem
connected with local distribution will do much towards bettering the
position of growers, a remark which may be applied to most of our farm
products, as shown by the following comparison by the Rockhampton
“Bulletin” of ruling prices in that city; distant but 450 miles (mostly
by boat), and in Toowoomba. The prices given are the highest ruling
in Toowoomba on Saturday, 80th January, and the lowest rates quoted in
Rockhampton on the same date : —Lucerne chaff, Toowoomba, £2, and
Rockhampton £5 10s. ; oaten-chaff, Toowoomba £2, and Rockhampton
£6; potatoes, Toowoomba £1 155., and Rockhampton £4 ; maize,
Toowoomba, Is. and Rockhampton Is. lid.; oats, Toowoomba, Bs. lid.,
and Rockhampton Bs. 9d.; eggs, Toowoomba, 4d., and Rockhampton, Is.
Bd.; butter, Toowoomba, 5d., and Rockhampton 8-£d. ; cheese, Too-
woomba, 6d. and Rockhampton 7|d.; fowls, Toowoomba 2s. and
Rockhampton Bs.; ducks, Toowoomba 35., and Rockhampton 45.;
turkeys, Toowoomba 10s. and Rockhampton 10s. The figures speak for
themselves ; but were we to give the lowest rates at each place compared,
the difference would be considerably greater than is shown in this table.
Take, for example, potatoes. They could be bought in Toowoomba at £1
55., or £2 15s. less than in Rockhampton. Then again butter could be
bought at Bd. in Toowoomba. The lowest wholesale price here was
Cheese was selling in the southern towns at as low as 4d. ; in Rock-
hampton, the cheapest price it could be purchased at was 7d. Coming
next to poultry, we find fowls selling in Toowoomba at Is. 4d., in
Rockhampton at 3s. ; ducks at 2s. 6d. in Toowoomba, 4s. here; and
turkeys at ss. in Toowoomba, and 10s. in Rockhampton.”
WHEAT.
Although in point of area sown for grain in 1895 (27,090 acres) and
crop raised (123,630 bushels), this cereal does not come up to maize at the
present time, the proved suitability of enormous tracts of land to the
growth of the former, and the frequently recurring shortages as regards
milling requirements, are certain before long to place it in the front rank.
Hitherto we have relied upon the adjacent Colonies of South
Australia, New Zealand, and New South Wales for requirements in
excess of local production, but last year (1896) a shortage in the first-
named Colony of about 500,000 bushels below their local requirements,
and in New South Wales of more than twice that quantity (in common
with our own still heavier deficiency) necessitated a large import from
across the Atlantic.
In 1895, notwithstanding an import duty of 4d. per bushel on wheat,


and 20s. per ton on flour—this Colony imported 864,530 bushels of the
former (value, £59,614), and 82,748 tons of the latter (value, £249,000
odd) from the neighbouring Colonies.
The slightly smaller area sown in 1895, and the disastrous effects of
unfavourable weather upon the return per acre—which was less than one-
fourth of that of 1894—led us to not only import flour, but grain ; and
that to a large extent. Over £90,000 worth of American wheat found its
way into the hands of local millers in a very small space of time; of flour,
the exact figures are not yet available, although there is little doubt but
that the imports have been heavy, both of Californian and Manitoban
produce. The approximate total import of flour in 1896, as very kindly
given by the Collector of Customs, was of the value of £370,232. From
the above it will be seen that, if immunity from that dreaded pest—rust—
and from drought, could be secured (and we believe are both
attainable), no grain crop holds out greater inducements than this one.
The following will give a rough idea of the progress made with regard to
the first-named trouble; the second line shows approximate ratio of area
affected with rust to the entire area sown with wheat:—
Year ... 1886 ’B7 ’BB ’B9 1890 ’9l ’92 ’93 ’94 ’95
Ratio ... 55 14 3 82 11 9 6 14 29 9 %
A comparison of the average ratio of the last five of these years with
that of the first five, will disclose the fact that the proportion of rust-
smitten wheat has fallen from about 33 %to something like 14 %. This
is in itself matter for much congratulation, but it is almost needless to
state that a very much lower percentage of loss is looked forward to in
the five years ending 1900. The most exhaustive experiments have been
and still are being conducted by the Department of Agriculture with a
view to eradicating this disease in our Colony, by introducing varieties of
seeds and methods of cultivation which do not favour it. A series of
Wheat Conferences have been held throughout Australia to consider this
and other questions affecting the industry—at which we were officially
represented by Professor Shelton—and nothing that science can suggest
or money procure is being left undone, in order to place wheat growers in
a position to supply local requirements.
With regard to the second difficulty with which the wheat farmer has
had to contend : Want of early rain.
This will undoubtedly be fully met by the extension of irrigation
systems. In the United States and in some of the Australian Colonies,
the most astounding results have been achieved by this practice, and
whilst our own experiences are too recent to furnish thoroughly reliable
data, enough has been done to show that in the scientific application of
surface water lies one of the secrets connected with successful wheat
D


culture. I have endeavoured to show that we are making progress as
regards methods of cultivation ; this is no less true as regards the area
planted, and extent of crop.
Speaking broadly, the average area during the five years ending 1890
was 12,500 acres ; from ’9l to ’95 it was 30,000 acres. 1895 excepted,
a very satisfactory advance has been made in the output of grain, this
having risen from 21,221 bushels in 1886 to an estimated return for 1896
of some 600,000 or 700,000 bushels. The average for the first quinquen-
nium was 110,000 bushels, for the second period it was 387,000 bushels
per annum. As, however, the rate of local consumption (calculated over
an extended period of years) is between four and five bushels of wheat per
cap., this is yet a long way short of the quantity required for food alone,
and even should the 1896 estimate prove correct according to official
figures, an import of 1,200,000 to 1,800,000 bushels of breadstuff’s will be
necessary during the current year.
Owing to the climatic and other difficulty previously mentioned, the
returns per acre vary much in different years (often on the same ground)
so that individual years do not give an adequate idea of the returns from
this crop. In the colony of New South Wales the yield of wheat rose from
10-45 bushels per acre in 1886, to 17'37 bushels in 1887; in our
own Colony the rise was even greater, viz., from 3-13 bushels to 22-10
bushels (same dates). The mean average, however, for the eighteen years
ending December 1895 is 12-29 bushels, which at recent prices, 4s. to 4s.
6d. per bushel, means a return of 50s. to 60s. per acre.
In the year 1895 some fairly high yields per acre were recorded from
experimental areas, such as : —An average of nearly 26 bushels on 11 acres
at Dugandan ; 25 bushels at Gayndah, and 32 bushels at Springsure.
Estimates for the crop just harvested placed the average yield over an ex-
tensive district at 30 to 32 bushels. The annual July returns will deter-
mine how far this estimate was correct, but an official estimate issued in
February, 1897, as regards the 1896 Agricultural Returns, gives the area
under wheat at 35,171 acres—the largest ever attained in this Colony.
The estimated yield is also the heaviest recorded, viz., 582,672 bushels,
and the average yield is over four bushels per acre higher than the mean
average quoted above.
In view of these exceedingly low averages from tw T o colonies which
are usually large exporters, there is no reason why Queensland should not
become eventually a wheat-exporting country. Professor Shelton has
again and again emphasized the fact that the conditions which obtain
here are as suited to wheat growing as are those in California, Manitoba,
and other great centres of this industry—perhaps more so. By averaging
the yield for a period of ten years —1885 to 1894 —Mr. Weedon’s year book
shows conclusively the high average return of our wheat-lands. The


following are that gentleman’s ligures :—Queensland, 15 bushels ; New
South Wales, 12 : Victoria, 10 5 South Australia, 7 ; Western Australia,
12 ; Tasmania, 17; New Zealand, 24. Amongst these colonies our own
has, during the last 17 or 18 years, attained the distinction of being ten
times at the head of the list, and only about three times at the foot of
same. The average for the United Kingdom is stated at about 27 bushels
per acre, and I may add an average of yields in one of the American
States—that of New York—extending over a quarter of a century, is
stated upon good authority to be 14.86 bushels.
‘ qßJ The comparatively small area devoted to this crop here may, of course,
have somewhat to do with such apparently high results, still, should an
extension of the area affect the average to the extent of a reduction by one-
third, we may still look for the developement of this industry into a large
and profitable one.
The neighbouring colony of New South Wales—with much of which
our Darling Downs have many things in common—is estimated by their
Government Statistician to have had, at the end of 1896, about 761,661
acres to be reaped for grain, and 194,948 acres to be cut for hay. These
are expected to yield 7,435,000 bushels of grain wheat (9.8 bushels per
acre), and 168,321 tons of hay.
In view of the fact that we have two or three million acres of wheat
land open to selection or purchase on 20 years’ terms by annual payments
of £7 12s. lOd. on each £IOO purchase money, the following statement of
about December 16th, 1896, is full of significance :
“ The S. M. Herald estimates the total acreage under crop in Austra-
lia this year, and excluding New Zealand altogether, at 4,234,409 acres,
and the yield of wheat at 18,643,400 bushels, and sets down the probable
needs of the colonies at 25,706,775 bushels, of which 4,602,895 bushels
are required for seed. The foreign grain ordered or afloat is 2,323,610
bushels, which will have to be made up by New Zealand or America.
The reason why New Zealand is excluded from the computation is
that at the present time it is impossible to obtain any reliable data from
that colony as to the probable harvest, though there is every indication
that it will be a good one.”
But our wheat-growing area is by no means confined to the districts
adjacent to the southern border of the colony. Very little, indeed, has
been done even in an experimental way, but as far North as Hughenden a
yield of 15 bushels per acre has been obtained from small plots. In the
central districts 32 bushels per acre were obtained at Springsure, 20
bushels at Rockhampton, 32 at Mackay, at Clermont, 12 at Banana.
This portion of Queensland, in the opinion of Professor Shelton and others
whose experience of the crop entitles them to judge, possesses some of the
most productive wheat-lands of Australia.


Settlers are wanted. New South Wales got them, and Queensland
will get them. New South Wales drew settlers from Victoria, South
Australia, and Tasmania. And Queensland will draw settlers from all the
Southern colonies as well as, let us hope, from oversea countries. It is
only a question of time when Central Queensland will have its prosperous
agricultural communities and districts. Eockhampton journals never
miss an opportunity of emphasising this chance for new settlers. They
know that magnificent resources have been neglected. They know that a
flourishing agricultural industry would be an incalculable advantage to
that part of the colony. It would mean closer settlement than grazing
farms, and perhaps a more profitable occupation of some of the grazing
farms. It would mean steadily increasing population and employment.
It would mean business for Rockhampton. We doubt if any other deve-
lopment could be mentioned which is so full of promise for Central
Queensland as the building up of a great wheat-growing industry. And
the pioneers are already putting in an appearance in the persons of
several Victorian gentlemen and their families, who bring with them the
experience of years, and all the mechanical appliances needful to the
cultivation of this cereal on a considerable scale. One of these farmers—
Mr. Griffiths —expects during the incoming season to have in at least 800
acres of wheat and 100 acres of general crops, while Mr. Warwick antici.
pates putting in 100 acres to start with. Mr. Griffiths has formed an
excellent opinion of the Central district of Queensland for wheat growing,
which he declares must ultimately become the granary of Queensland.
The Messrs. Griffiths and Warwick have secured their seed wheat, which
is of the Allora variety, at a cost of 6s. 6d. and 7s. 6d. per bushel, and on
to this has to be added the railway freight. The Agricultural Department
have promised to store this wheat until it is required.
It may interest farmers who contemplate entering this field of indus-
try to read the following report to the New South Wales Department of
Agriculture, by Mr. H. L. White, of Belltrees, respecting the above-men-
tioned variety of wheat.
“ I have just finished threshing the Allora Spring Wheat, the return
from thirty-six acres of poor land being 310 bags, equal to 36 bushels per
acre. This grain is a good sample, and lam offered 4s. 9d. per bushel by
the local millers. The quantity of Allora Spring wheat sent to me in
1893 was a quarter of a pound ; yield in 1896, 310 bags.” The report is
corroborative of the experience of others with this early variety. When
sowing must be done late this is one of the varieties most likely to
succeed.”
Intending wheat-farmers could not, however, do better than consult
with our Instructor in Agriculture on a subject to which he has devoted
much time and enthusiasm. At the present time the seat of the industry


may be said to be in the Southern division of the Colony, west of the
main range. Toowoomba was shown in 1895 to have reaped the produce
of 4,196 acres for grain, mown 215 acres for hay, and cut 433 acres for
green food ; Allora reaped 2,672 acres, and cut a couple of hundred acres
for other purposes ; Warwick reaped 1,996 acres, besides a small area cut
for hay and green food ; Roma reaped 1,367 acres, and cut less than 100
acres for other purposes.
To the east of the Range, 1,007 acres were sown with wheat,
but only the small area of 249 acres was reaped. The average return of
grain per acre was high, being 13.99 bushels per acre—as against an
average of 9.46 to the west of the Range. A few petty sessions districts
showed splendid results ; Dugandan—2s.ss ; Gayndah (small plot) 25 ;
Nanango —934 bushels from 57 acres reaped for grain.
Having been asked to report upon the capabilities of the latter
district, Professor Shelton says :
“ Whether the Nanango people can clear and stump the ground in
the first instance, and raise wheat in competition with the residents of the
plains, who add to their other advantages ample railroad facilities, may
well be questioned. Of this I have not the slightest doubt : That there
are tens of thousands of acres of land in the district under consideration
which will produce crops of wheat above the average yield even of Queens-
land, and I am equally certain that the quality of the wheat will rank with
the best produced in the colony. Having railroad communication, and
considering the possibilities of growth in other directions, I should have no
hesitation in saying that this district ought in the very near future to take
rank with the best in Queensland for the production of the great bread
staple.”
As regards the cost of production, few figures seem to be available
here, but broad conclusions may be drawn from the interesting figures
in the 1892 report of the State Board of Agriculture in Massachusetts,
U.S.A., as to the cost of cropping various cereals, &c., in Canada.
The total yield of wheat per acre is set down at 28 bushels, of which
the cost is about £3 6s. 6d. The principal items I should imagine to be
very similar to those incidental to the better style of farming in Queens-
land—such as : Rent (or interest on capital) about 20s. lOd. per acre—a
liberal allowance; seed, 6s. 3d.; ploughing, 12s. 6d.; harvesting, Bs. 4d. ;
threshing and cleaning, 11s. sd. ; planting, harrowing, rolling, thinning
and hoeing, and cultivating, are provided for at an outlay of another
6s. lid., bringing the total cost bushel up to a shade under 2s. 6d.
If then, our farmers can approach the above figures, I think it will
readily be admitted that there are “ dollars” in this crop ; at all events, if
our Canadian and American cousins find this so, what is to prevent our


farmers doing the same ! The right class of soil and temperature are
here, and nature’s reservoirs need only to be tapped in order to yield an
abundant supply of water. Aided by natural conditions such as these,
labour-saving machinery and brains will secure a big share of the world’s
trade in breadstuff's. The ample scope which exists for the extension of
the industry is apparent from the following extract from Messrs, Wm.
Cooper and Nephew’s “ Handy Companion
“ We give the following figures of the world’s wheat production for

It is apparent that the production of wheat has not kept pace with
increase of population. This is more strikingly shown by recent figures
in the Telegraph, of Brisbane, anent the decided rise in wheat values, by
which it appears that the world’s visible supply on October Ist, 1895, was
but two thirds of that on October Ist, 1894.

The milling industry in this colony is yet in its infancy. There are
now about 12 grain mills and an equal number of rice and spice mills
worked by steam power, employing a capital of £150,000, or less, between
them. The output of the first-named in 1894 was 12,080 tons of flour,
valued at £106,078, and 227 tons of other meal, value £2,080.


Much more might be written on the subject, but space forbids; for
any further information the reader is referred to the Report on Agricul-
ture and Live Stock, and other official publications.
OATS.
A varying amount of attention is paid to this cereal by our
agriculturists. Fairly good yields were obtained in 1894, but in 1895
both area and yield decreased considerably. On the 1894 area sown
for grain—1,477 acres—an average return of over 20 bushels per acre was
obtained, and 10,993 acres in hay-crop returned 20,300 tons of that
article.
Compared with the above, the area reaped for grain in 1895 was
555 acres smaller, and the yield was 19,576 bushels below that of 1894, so
that the rate of yield was not much over half that of 1894; there
was also a decrease in area sown for hay of 1,230 acres and decrease
in yield of hay of 7,802 tons. Whilst considerably below the average
of some of the United States, Great Britain, New Zealand, and Tasmania,
our average yield per acre over a series of years closely approximates
a like average for New South Wales and Victoria. The following will
show the position :
Bushels.
New York State, mean average 1862-1888 ... ... 30.72
New Zealand, mean (term of 10 years) ... ... 32.51
New South Wales, mean average 1878-1887 ... ... 21.55
Victoria, average for 1894 ... ... ... ... 21.14
Queensland, mean average (5 years ending 1894) ... 21.53
South Australia, average for 1894 ... ... ... 12.68
Western Australia, average for 1894 ... ... ... 12.46
The least favorable local results during the decade just closed occurred in
years of drought—lßßß and 1895, and the fairly uniform results obtained
during good years seem to point conclusively to the necessity of a reliable
water supply if one would be successful with this crop. It is doubtful
whether farmers in this colony can raise oats as cheaply as is done in the
United States (lowa, Is. per bushel); New Hampshire, lid. per bushel;
Maine, Is. per bushel; and Canada, Is. l|d. per bushel, but as the grain
maintains as a rule a stead) value of 3s. to 4s. per bushel, there is a wide
margin for extra cost—and profit too. It is worth bearing in mind also
that the cost per bushel in New Hampshire and Maine as quoted above is
more than half due to the fertiliser applied, although this again is
counterbalanced by a heavy yield—4o to 42 bushels per acre.
Possibly the strongest plea for an extension of the area under oats
for grain is the fact that every year we send away thousands of pounds
sterling for oatmeal. Though still a large sum, I note that the


imports of the former for 1895 are nearly £IO,OOO less than in 1894, and
those of oatmeal some £3,000 less. Taken in conjunction with the
greatly reduced home production, this change would seem to indicate that
other cereals are taking the place of this one as food, for both man and
beast —a change which may be due to scarcity, and consequent high price,,
as much as to anything. At any rate, local requirements are yet
sufficient to offer considerable inducement to the cultivation of the crop
the import duties of Bd. per bushel of seed and 4s. per cwt. of oat-
meal, contributing in themselves a good deal towards high market values.
As a fodder crop, oats are evidently gaining favour, an increase
in area equal to 33-J-% having taken place in 1895, as compared with 1893
and 1894.
BARLEY.
The area under cultivation for grain in 1895 was only 721 acres (as
against 1,418 in 1894), and the yield was the lowest during the decade
ending in December of that year. Excluding the latter, which was an
exceptionally unfavourable year, the nine years’ average is found to be
over 23 bushels, whereas that for 1895 alone was but 1076 bushels pel*
acre (total 7,756 bushels.) The 1894 yield was remarkable, insomuch
that it was second only to that of New Zealand (27*40), the difference
being *73 of a bushel per acre, and was considerably over the average
1894 yields in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western
Australia, respectively 17*25 ; 16*40 ; 15*73 ; and 7*53 bushels per acre.
The 1878-1887 average yield in New South Wales was 20*25, and that of
New York State (U.S.A.), for 1862 to 1888 was 22*38, so that this crop
would seem to be worthy of a more prominent place on our farms. Apart
from a few hundred acres for hay making purposes, which although of
greater area in 1895, produced but very little more hay than the 1894
crop, but a small area is under oats ; the future of this grain—and that a
brilliant one —lies in the large and increasing local consumption of malt.
During the year ended 30th June, 1896, the Inspector of Distilleries
reports that out of 149,548 bushels of malt which were used, only 12,988
bushels were of local production. This is a great advance upon the
previous years’ output of Queensland malt, which was then 4,537 bushels.
I quote the following short extract from the Report, as showing the
opening which exists for the crop under consideration, and the present
position of the brewing interests —with which this crop is so closely
connected: —
“ From returns received it was shown that 22 breweries were in
operation during the year ended 30th June, 1896, being three more than
in the preceding year. Fifteen breweries were situated in the Southern,
4in the Central, and 3in the Northern districts. The quantity of beer


brewed in each district was as f0110w5:—3,520,974 gallons in the
Southern, and 630,491 in the Central; while the Northern district
produced 672,092 gallons. The total gross quantity of beer brewed in the
colony during the year now reviewed was 4,823,557 gallons, being
738,918 gallons more than was brewed in 1895. The quantities of
materials returned by brewers as having been used in brewing during the
year ended 30th June, 1896, are as follows :
Malt, 149,548 bushels ; grain, 33 bushels ; sugar, cwt. ;
hops, 266,585 lbs.”
The value of the malt imported in 1895 was £48,837; that imported
during ’95-’96 would be worth some £40,000. Queensland is, however,
by no means the only importer of malt and malting barley.
The chief exporting colonies are New Zealand, South Australia, and
Victoria.
Three-fifths of the total area under barley in 1895 (or 1397 acres) was
destined for green food for cattle, and it is pleasing to note an increase of
fully 90% over the area so utilised in 1894. The provision of artificial food
for stock is a most important element in such climates as ours, and it is a
subject for congratulation that farmers are beginning to recognise its
necessity, The latest estimate of the total area under fodder crop (all
kinds) in Queensland is 20,372 acres. The bulk of the barley in this
'Colony is grown on the Darling Downs, in the districts of Allora, Warwick,
and Toowoomba. Small quantities have been tried in the Maranoa dis-
trict, but with poor success. As a hay crop, this has however been
successfully grown as far North as Herberton (S. Lat. 17°23') I may add
that the cost of growing a bushel of barley, as given by the Canadian
authority already quoted—Simpson Reume, gold medallist farmer—is put
down at Is. 3d.—a triumph of economy which our farmers would do well
to endeavour to emulate. The “ Warwick Argus” announced but a few
days ago that a site has been secured in that town for a malting house by
a gentleman who has had a long experience in the trade. The erection
will be the means of circulating a good deal of money, and the establish-
ment of this industry will mean the finding of a steady market for a
considerable quantity of the grain. This maltster wants to purchase 5000
bushels during 1897 ; 3s. to 4s. is now being paid by him. The article in
question estimates the annual home requirements of barley as of a value
of £75,000.
RYE.
Although the returns from past crops have been high, this has
■experienced a decided falling off since 1891. In the latter year 12,434
bushels of grain were obtained from 538 acres (23.11 per acre), and in
1895 only 4169 bushels were garnered, from 202 acres. The mean


average yield for the five years —20.73 —is very high compared to that of
other rye-consuming countries—say New York State, which showed
between 1862 and 1870 a yield of only 15.17 bushels ; between the years
1880 and 1888 the average in that State was only 11.94 bushels.
The liking for bread made from this cereal is not an international
one —although a most wholesome article of food —and its consumption is
practically confined to the Teutonic and Slavonic races. It is difficult to
account for the disuse into which this article of diet seems to be falling,
excepting on the supposition that the rising generation amongst our
German colonists, and others who have been accustomed to its use, are
adapting their tastes to their surroundings. In 1895 one hundred bushels
of grain were raised in the Northern division of the colony Dugandan,
Toowoomba, and Highfields accounting for 2888 out of the other 4069
bushels.
As regards rye sown for greenstuff, I have to chronicle two successive
increases in output for 1894 and 1895 ; in the case of the latter year,
equivalent to over 100 %. This satisfactory advance is mainly in the
Southern district, and is an evidence of the attention which is being paid
to the hand-feeding of dairy cattle and other stock.
RICE.
Prolific as the growth of this most important food product has proved
here, it is a matter for surprise that its cultivation has made so little
progress. Judging by the phenomenal increase of area in 1892- from
457 to 1118 acres —it might reasonably have been expected that by the
present time little or no imported rice would be consumed. The develop-
ment which seemed imminent in 1892 has not, however, taken place, and
1896 estimates of the area place it at 640 acres (yielding 12,136 bushels
of “paddy.”); a smaller acreage than in 1895, and a lower yield than
that of 1891.
Going back to the year 1890, I find that we imported some 7,500,000
lbs., and exported about 215,000 lbs., leaving for home consumption over
seven and a quarter million pounds, representing a money value of about
£45,000. Deducting the odd thousands on account of local production, we
had in that year to bring in about 7,000,000 lbs. of rice at a cost of
£43,000 odd. A glance at the 1895 figures will show how we stand by
comparison :
lbs. £
Imports ... ... 6,314,738 ... 35,643
Exports ... ... 231,899 ... 1,339
lbs. 6,082,839 £34,304
To which must be added local production, in order to ascertain the quantity
used for home consumption.


According to the table of averages in the Report on Agriculture for
1895, the returns per acre in 1886 and 1887 were as much as 66.44 and
50.86 bushels per acre respectively, although, contrary to expectations,
this is not due to restricted cultivation—the reason usually assigned to
high yields in the early days of a particular crop. To prove my assertion
I may mention that in 1892 —the year in which the greatest area was
planted with rice—the average return per acre was 29.99 bushels ; whilst
in 1889 the small area of 249 acres averaged 8.81 bushels—a smaller
instead of a higher average. It may therefore be reasonably inferred that
a very large portion of this colony, especially where the agriculturist is
favoured by a regular rainfall, is eminently suited to the cultivation of this
grain.
The mean average yield per acre between 1886 and 1895 was little
short of 8 { bushels, while the average obtained in India does not exceed
: 12. Within the last few years the Indian Government have spent a large
amount of money, time, and patience in trying to educate the natives out
of their prehistoric methods of cultivating rice, with the result that where
improved ploughs were used and deeper cultivation given, a yield of 40
bushels per acre has been obtained. This only serves to show that with
our rich soils and modern farming methods and appliances, an average
yield of from 60 to 70 bushels per acre can and should be obtained. Mr.
McPherson, in his experiments in Brisbane, obtained at the rate of 68
bushels per acre.
Generally speaking, the returns for 1896 were adversely affected by
the drought in the early portion of the year, the effect being to reduce the
average to about 19 bushels per acre, and, although this is much below
that of the preceding 10 years, it is unquestionably profitable.
The few facts given above will show the enormous scope which there
is for rice growing, in which, at least, 30,000 acres could find profitable
employment. It might be added that all imported rice has to pay a duty
of Id. per lb. say 3s. 6d. per bushel. Already 10 or 11 steam mills for
the grinding of rice, coffee, &c., have been erected in the colony, and for
a high class product, not only Queensland, but all the Southern markets
are open.
I append a few extracts from the Courier of 10th February last,
bearing directly on this point:—
Interviewed by a representative of that paper, Mr. Callaghan Walsh,
Cairns, who, by the bye, is a director of the Mossman Central Sugar Mill
Co., and a proprietor of the “ Rice, Coffee and Spice Milling C 0.,” of
Cairns, says:—
The difficulty I have experienced for the past five or six years as a
manufacturer, said Mr. Walsh, “ has been an insufficient supply of rice


paddy to keep the mill going anything like full time ; in fact, up to the
present I have not been able to secure enough to keep the mill going three
months out of the twelve. I have, however, at last procured a rice which
I am satisfied will meet the requirements of the colony, and overcome the
difficulties experienced by growers with the seed hitherto procurable.”
“ The variety referred to is what is technically known as the bearded
or spiked Java rice. Its prolificness may be imagined from the fact that
one grower obtained 28cwt. to 30cwt. as the product of 801 b. to 1001 b.
of seed. The planter also supplied this important information : He found
it would grow in wet or dry land equally well, it bore well to the acre, and
would stand for months in the field when ripe without laying down in
windy or wet weather, or shedding its grain a matter of the utmost im-
portance to the planter, as the crop thereby will wait his convenience to
harvest. Naturally the grain was difficult to thrash or strip, but Mr.
Walsh concluded that this was the most economic and profitable variety
of rice that could be introduced. For milling purposes he found this
variety a white, plump-grained rice, free from the appearance of Japan
rice, and the families who used it spoke in most satisfactory terms of its
flavour, which they thought much superior to any of the imported rices.
<< can be grown in the North with no more labour than is neces-
sary with a crop of wheat, oats, or barley in the South, for the same
modern labour-saving machinery can be applied to each. Mr. Walsh is
convinced that rice-growing in North Queensland will assume very great
proportions, and will be found by growers to be a remunerative as well as
a reliable crop. He describes it as'a splendid harvesting crop, the rice
paddy having the peculiarity of improving with age. It will keep for
years, and is not liable to attacks from weevils or other insects. 1 lanting
may be conducted from November to January, and it takes from thirteen
to fourteen weeks for the crop to mature. It is of very great importance
that it should not ripen for harvest until after the wet season, which gene-
rally ends from the first to the middle of May.
“ Asked as to the commercial prospects of rice cultivation, Mr. Walsh
said he had guaranteed growers to take the whole of their paddy at £7
10s. per ton. He could not compute the average yield per acre, because
the immense possibility of the crop had never been tested beyond scratch-
ing the ground with a hoe. There were a few European growers in the
Port Douglas district —notably Mr. Andrew Jack, a member of the Port
Douglas Divisional Board —who had expressed themselves highly satisfied
with the results of their rice-growing for the past few years in that
district. The sugar plantations are large consumers of rice, and while in
Brisbane, Mr. Walsh met one of the plantation managers from the John-
stone River, who regretted his inability to execute an order for Cairns
rice.


POTATO.
This is a very common crop with our farmers, and although some-
times a sufferer from fluctuations in the market, it is one of the “ stand
by s of the farm. Amongst a large section of those engaged in manual
labour, potatoes, corned beef, and “ damper” take a premier position in
the larder, so that domestic requirements absorb a considerable portion of
the crop ; and as to pig-feeding with this tuber, the extent to which it
may be profitably practised is illimitable.
Official records state the 1895 yield to have been 2.06 tons per acre,
whilst the estimate for 1896 is about 2.25 per acre, (the ten
years average is 2.31 per acre.) Comparing these results with
the known averages obtained in other parts of the woald, we
find that Queensland ranks after the United Kingdom, Canada,
Germany, or France; approximates very closely to Austria, and
completely outdistances the United States, in regard to yield of potatoes
per acre.
Foreign grown potatoes are subject to an import duty of 15s. per
ton, and yet in 1895 there was an excess of imports over exports of 12,400
odd tons, of the value of £33,600 odd !! Here, surely, is scope for enter-
prise.
It is undoubtedly true that many of the other colonies from which
these supplies were obtained are better suited to the growth of this crop,
but still, fairly remunerative prices might be always counted upon if in
times of plenty a portion of the crops were turned into pig flesh, or care-
fully stored, instead of rushed on the market in the senseless way which is
so often adopted. The chief seats of this branch of agriculture are at
Highfields and Warwick, both west of the main Range, and Gatton, Red-
cliffe, Laidley, and Crow’s Nest, both east of the Range—all in the South
of Queensland. At Rockhampton about If tons per acre were obtained in
1895, and at Winton (in the Central districts) a small patch gave over four
tons to the acre.
At Townsville (in the North) just over two tons per acre was recorded,
and on the Herberton tableland about 2f tons were obtained to the acre.
The potato is about as free from disease in Queensland as in any part
of the world —“black heart” being about the only one which gives trouble
—and this is no doubt to a great extent avoidable.
The estimated area and production for 1896 are:—9,4oo acres; 20,555
tons—a significant contrast to the 283,000 tons of potatoes which the
relatively small colonies of Victoria and New South Wales unitedly pro-
duced in 1895 !

SWEET POTATO —(lmpomcea batatas.)
This is an edible tuber, of the convolvulus tribe, which is much in
favor in this colony, especially among the farming population, and also
among the Polynesians, of whom it is often the main food.
Properly cooked, this root should be of a beautiful color, varying from
white to creamy, and of a flavour slightly resembling the chestnut. When
broken with knife and fork it should present somewhat the appearance
“A typical river scene.”
of a “floury” potato. The slightest degree of toughness is evidence of
carelessness in having either more than sufficient, or insufficient water in
the process of cooking. Almost needless to add, the sweet potato should
he cleaned and boiled iu its skin, in order to obtain the best results ; it
should not be cut with a steel knife, but broken, by preference.
The area under cultivation in 1895 was 2736 acres, from which 14,233
tons of sweet potatoes were obtained. The average yield for the decennium


was 5.61 tons per acre, and although the market is somewhat limited,
there are so many uses to which this may be put on the farm—notably,
cattle and pig feeding—that the crop is an extremely profitable one.
COTTON.
The cultivation of this plant has been carried on of late with renewed
activity, a ready market at a local mill contributing mainly to this result.
Large areas were under cotton-plant in early years, hut owing to a fall in
the world’s market, it was found that we could not compete at the price
we had to pay for labour, and the plant almost passed out of cultivation.
Those who find a profit in the crop are mostly farmers with large
families, who can do the light —although tedious work of picking
the balls of cotton.
The cultivation is stated to be no more troublesome than that accorded
to most other field crops, and can all be done by plough, scuffler, and
hoe.
The official figures for 1895 are : —Area planted, 494 acres (only 100
acres in 1894) for a return of 269,1101b5. of unginned cotton. Estimating
gibs, of the latter to yield lib. of clean cotton, we find that the average
yield per acre would be nearly 1821bs. At the price ruling locally—about
lid. per lb.—that would mean a return of 19s. per acre. It has recently
been the practice to obtain from the purchasing mill the seed necessary for
laying down a crop. The charge has hitherto been Id. per lb., but as this
is considered excessive by some, it may be found possible to reduce it
slightly.
A few lines from the last annual report of the Queensland Cotton
Manufacturing Co., Ltd,, may be of interest: —
“ Mr. D. Jones said that during the last couple of years, at all events,
the farmers had no reason to complain of the treatment they had received
at the hands of the directorate. Last year farmers received money for
their cotton as soon as they brought it to the mill.”
“ Through the operations of the company the district had greatly
benefited, as about £SOOO had been distributed during the year. Two very
fair consignments were to be sent to Western Australia next month.
The capabilities of Queensland for cotton production are stated to be
fully equal to those of the United States, excepting possibly that labour
and carriage to port of shipment are heavier on this side. Not only was
Queensland an importer in 1895 to the net amount of about £292,000
worth of cotton in its manufactured and raw state, but most of the
adjoining colonies are importers to a far greater extent, so that there is an
enormous market for our cotton goods —and consequently a splendid
opening for cotton culture.


ARROWROOT —(Canna edulis .)
Determined efforts are being made to find an oversea market for this
root product, and when once the prejudice existing in Europe against any
other preparations than those known as “ arrowroot” is removed, we may
expect a rapid development of the industry.
Practically none but Queensland arrowroot is used here, and there
are several mills which turn out a quality of flour fully equal to anything
which could be imported. The imports in 1895 consisted of about 90001bs.
weight, of a value of £44, whilst the exports (mainly to neighbouring
colonies) were valued at £3178. The local consumption would appear to
have been between 9000 and 10,000 lbs. weight. The average production
during the ten years ending 1895 was 2162.40 lbs. per acre, and the whole-
sale value of the prepared arrowroot ranges from 13s. to 18s. per cwt.
The plant itself forms a useful article of food for pigs.
The Agent-General for this colony has been at considerable trouble
to bring this article of commerce before the British public, and has
personally, and by exhibits at Shows, &c., advocated its claims. In a
recent Brisbane Courier appeared the following very useful information on
the subject from the pen of Mr. Thomas Lowry, Assistant Secretary to the
Board of Inland Revenue, London. This gentleman writes :
“ The term arrowroot, without prefix or qualification, should, strictly
speaking, be restricted to the starch derived from plants of the genus
Maranta. A purchaser asking simply for arrowroot would, presumably, by
use and wont, expect to be supplied with Maranta starch. Tons les mois, or
Queensland arrowroot, the product of Canna edulis, is quite a different
starch, and its physical properties and appearance are distinct from those
of Maranta starch. Inasmuch as the term ‘ arrowroot,’ without a prefix
or qualification, is now well established, the vendors of the Queensland
article would, in the Board’s opinion, best protect themselves by labelling
it as £ Queensland arrowroot (prepared from Canna edulis.)’ ”
TOBACCO.
The industry connected with this plant has undergone a great many
changes of late years. The increasing favour with which locally made
and grown tobacco is being received has, according to the latest official
estimate for 1896, resulted in a production of 8936 cwt. of dried leaf, from
834 acres —equal to about 10-| cwt. to the acre. This weight of leaf has
only once been exceeded, but the area has been so on two occasions; the
falling off being apparently due to poor results in 1895. Although largely
grown by Chinese gardeners, the cultivation is not confined to them.
The crop is one requiring almost incessant watchfulness, in order to
prevent insect attacks, &c., but the patience involved in its culture is one
which is well rewarded as a general rule.


Considerable fluctuations have to be noted in the price of the raw
material, as high as Is. and as low as 3d. per lb. having been given by
manufacturers’ buyers, but at 6d. per lb. (a very usual price) the mean
average yield for 1886-95, which is 8.47 cwt. per acre, would give a cash
return of over £24 to the acre. Indeed, it is a notorious fact that a
Chinaman in the South of Queensland, working with the aid of 14 of his
fellow countrymen, realised £2OOO in one season on 60 acres of land. Of
course, prices were then at a high point, but there is plenty of money even
now in the crop, and once the right kind of leaf is grown largely and pro-
cesses perfected, an enormous demand will set in from Great Britain alone.
In 1894 the Government imposed a license fee, and duty amounting to Is.
per lb. of tobacco, or 2s. per lb. of cigars or cigarettes, on manufacturers.
Dealers in tobacco have to take out a license, for which the fee is ss. per
annum.
COFFEE.
As an article of local consumption and export, this has a very pro-
mising future before it. The berry has been proved to be capable of pro-
duction here in the highest state of perfection, and the range of climate in
which the tree thrives is very wide. The value of our own net imports in
1895 was about £3,310, and the consumption may be set down at about
80 tons.
According to Mr. Weedon, the world’s consumption of the coffee
bean is over 500,000 tons annually, and is of a value of more than
£40,000,000 ! Given the right class of soil and climate (which we have
in abundance), it would appear that thousands might engage in this in-
dustry with profit in our colony.
As attention has only lately been given to this lucrative branch of
horticulture, we cannot make comparison with former years, but the re-
sults so far justify the highest expectation of growers. Only 60 acres were
recorded in 1895, as planted with the shrub, but it is believed that the re-
turns for 1896 will disclose a large increase of acreage.
The following is culled from the previously quoted report of an inter-
view with Mr. Walsh, of Cairns. This gentleman said “ that three selectors
sent in a little over half-a-ton of berries. These came from the Russell
and Barron rivers, and from over the Range. He roasted and ground
them and they were found to be of good quality and excellent flavour.
Considerable attention is now being paid to its cultivation around
Cairns, on the Russell River, and at Kuranda. From what he could
learn from growers, based on the price he was prepared to give, coffee
ought to be worth from £6O to £BO per acre per year. To use Mr.
Walsh’s own words, ‘ Coffee grows there like a weed, and only requires
some care in pruning and nipping the young shoots.’ ” The North is at


present, and probably will always be, the principal seat of this industry.
Besides the 60301b5. weight from Cairns in 1895, the district of Cook
contributed 49521b5., and Mackay 201 Gibs. ; the best average in the
colony being in the middle district —4951b5.
The neighbourhoods of Maroochy and Buderim Mountain are like-
wise attaining notoriety for the prolific bearing of their coffee plantations,
and a company is already formed, and has permanent offices in Brisbane,
for the purpose of developing the industry in every possible way.
Queensland coffee from Kamerunga, Mackay, has been exhibited at
various places in London —amongst others at the Islington Annual
“ Dairy Show,” and we believe is well spoken of.
A few healthy looking coffee shrubs may be seen in and around
Brisbane, and Rockhampton.
HAY, ENSILAGE, AND GREEN FODDER.
Although differing essentially as regards process of manufacture, the
material from which the first two forms of stock food are obtained, and
their ultimate use are often so similar that it may be as well to consider
them together.
■lt is probably not more than fifteen years since ensilage-making at-
tracted any attention in the colony, and from the following figures it
would seem that, to some extent, it is taking the place of the first named
system of feed preserving. In 1898 the production of hay was 42,353
tons, and in ’94, ’95, and ’96, it is put down at 55,696 tons, 50,966
tons, and 43,054 tons respectively. The mean average return of hay per
acre between 1891 and 1895 was just short of 2 tons, which may be con-
sidered fairly satisfactory. In 1894 (not our best year) our return of 1-99
tons was heavier than that of any of the other six Australian Colonies;
our average for the above quinquennium compare favourably with that of
New York State for 1861—1888, viz., 1-19 tons.
Of course the above figures do not give any idea of the big yields
which are obtained in isolated districts, both in Queensland and in New
York State.
At Stanwell, near Rockhampton, 2£ tons of lucerne hay per acre are
frequently gathered ; at Scrubby Creek, in the Rockhampton Land Agent’s
district, 3 tons of oaten hay have been obtained in good seasons, and
similar results have been recorded at Herberton in the far North.
In the same way, the Agricultural Experiment Station of the State of
New York reports a yield of 15 tons of green cut lucerne (equal to about 5
tons of hay) per acre ; probably aided by artificial manure. Lucerne and
oats appear to be pretty general favourites for hay crops, both here and in
the States, where the former is known also as “ alfalfa.” The proportions
of these two to total area here was in 1895 about 88 per cent.


The imports of oaten hay chaff, which were formerly considerable, are
now being reduced. There was, however, £IB,OOO worth imported in
1895, from neighbouring colonies.
As regards ensilage, the quantities made in 1898-4-5 were : 419 tons,
604 tons, and 748 tons respectively. The quantity in 1896 has not been
even estimated.
Readers who wish to gain information regarding the best methods of
saving fodder, and making ensilage, &c., should consult Bulletins 12 and
24, from the pen of Professor Shelton. These invaluable publications
may be obtained free from the Department of Agriculture, Brisbane.
Both 1895 and 1896 have experienced a considerable advance as re-
gards area sown for green fodder. The figures are :—1894 —12,029 acres ;
1895—19,552 acres ; 1896—20,372 acres.
As with hay, lucerne and oats take the lead; but the varieties of crops
sown for “ green stuff” are naturally more numerous. After oats, the
1895 returns show sorghum to be the favourite; then maize, barley, sugar
cane, wheat, panicum, and rye ; besides small quantities of miscellaneous
crops.
FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.
The varieties of fruit, &c., which may be, and are, grown in Queensland
are infinite, and the quality of many of these is unsurpassed. Owing,
however, to the vastness of our territory, “ squatting” was for very many
years considered the only industry to which the country was adapted, with
the result that horticulture was greatly neglected, and it is only of late
years that it has shown signs of becoming a most important factor in our
national prosperity.
With the advent of Mr. Benson as fruit expert, who brings to bear on
his duties a wide colonial and American experience, there may be said to
open up unlimited possibilities to the fruit grower, and the action of the
Government in appointing so highly qualified a gentleman is evidence of
the recognition of the above fact.
Mr. Benson has already done good service in visiting the various
fruit districts of the colony, making himself acquainted with the prospects
and difficulties of the growers; and since the destruction of insect pests is
of even prior importance to the judicious marketing of fruit, the pamplet
on “ fruit pests and the methods of dealing with them,” which has
emanated from his pen, will be welcomed by those who cultivate fruit for
profit, whom it will enable to produce a better quality of fruit, so that they
may take their rightful place in the world’s market.
It is not the purpose of these pages to give an exhaustive account of
all the fruits and vegetables which might be grown here successfully (for
they are almost endless), but rather to give an "account of what is now


being done in that way, and the tremendous scope which exists for exten-
sion on those lines. The matter has been so fully thrashed out by our
Press, especially in the Brisbane Courier, that I propose to rely largely
upon the accounts of our older established fruit growers, and upon authen-
tic reports regarding the position and prospects of many whom Mr. Benson
has visited and conferred with, as well as upon my own observations.
Referring to the well-known fruit district of Cleveland Bay, comprising
some 600 acres under fruit, the Courier says :
“ In the Macleay orchard are sugar bananas that have been growing
seven years, now in good bearing, and perfectly free from disease. The
mango thrives to perfection. Amongst the many kinds of oranges imported
by Mr. Corrie from Florida, it will be of much interest to orchardists to-
learn that a number have proved quite suitable to and at home in this
climate, and are now bearing heavy crops. They are the Majorca, Garey’s
Mediterranean sweet, Yalentia late, Maltese blood, Beech’s No. 2, Bell,
Foster, Omasassa, Saul’s blood, and Magnum Bonum.”
Speaking at Wellington Point Mr. Benson said “ After careful
observations made in going through the district that week, he would like
to tell them what fruits to grow. The soil had distinct capabilities of
growing citrus fruits, more especially the orange, to perfection ; mango,,
banana, pine, custard apple, and tomato. The lemon would not do, but
the Tahiti lime did well, and they could not grow too many of that fruit.
The orange ripened early in Queensland, and commanded the Southern
markets during the months of May, June, and July, before the crop was
available in New South Wales for competition.”
As regards the position and prospects on the “ Downs,’ Mr. Benson
recently stated at a public meeting held in Toowoomba : —“ He believed
they could grow suitable oranges upon certain soils, and in suitable
positions, sheltered from the westerly winds ; he also believed they could
grow Lisbon lemons. The soil was likewise capable of growing to advan-
tage certain varieties of American grapes, and figs. In addition to the fruit
he had mentioned, plums of various sorts would grow well, and he believed
they could produce a first-class dried prune. In California this was the
finest industry, and, from what he had seen, there was no reason why in
Queensland we should not be able to grow for both local market and
export. He was also surprised to see the way in which pears grew; they
grew here easier, were more prolific, and stronger than in New South
Wales.”
A most interesting review of the fruit industry was given at the
beginning of this year (1897) in the Courier, from which the following is
an extract :
“ Already we find the oranges of the Wide Bay district in steady
demand in the Southern colonies ; the pineapple of Nundah, Zillmere, and


other districts around Brisbane still supplies a large portion of their con-
sumption ; oranges and bananas from Buderim Mountain, and the districts
on the southern shores of Moreton Bay, have also a profitable market out-
side our own borders ; while the Darling Downs—extending from the Main
Range south to Warwick and Stanthorpe, and westward to Roma—are
becoming famous for many of the fruits of a temperate climate,
and some portions are proving specially suited to the vine. The green
fruit exported from Queensland during the year 1896 represented £66,965,
as against £58,555 worth in the previous year, and in addition to this we
have every year a larger quantity used locally either for domestic consump-
tion or in the manufacture of jams and jellies. These figures are but small
compared with those of New South Wales and Victoria, to say nothing of
little Tasmania. Yet they represent, as we have said, the foundation upon
which may yet be built an industry yielding healthful and profitable
employment to scores of thousands, an industry calling forth all the skill,
intelligence, and perseverance of which our people are possessed.”
If the vendors of “ soft” drinks could be persuaded that North
Queensland limes are as good as Sicilian lemons, and might be got far
cheaper, we believe a large supply of that wholesome fruit could even now
be obtained from the Herbert River, Cairns, and Cooktown. The annual
output of these districts in citrus fruits represents, according to latest re-
turns, 6195 cases of oranges, and 800 cases of lemons ; and a considerable
proportion of this was exported. In tomatoes a very profitable trade has
been carried on, as the season is so much earlier in the sheltered coast lands
than in the Southern colonies, and in the early spring there is a good
demand in Sydney and Melbourne. Mangoes also are already largely
grown in these districts, but with them—more even than with other species
of fruit —quality is everything.”
With the exception of vines, no figures are available with regard to
the amount of fruit produced in 1896, so that the following particulars
respecting 1895 will have to suffice : —The area under bananas, which may
be considered to be at present the largest fruit crop of Queensland, was
one-third greater than in 1894 ; and the crop was a very successful one.
The 3916 acres under bananas yielded 14,860,386 dozen of fruit, the top
but one production for ten years, according to the Registrar-General.
Nor is fruit growing restricted to the places hitherto mentioned.
Around and about Nanango—approached by coach from Esk (Brisbane
Valley Railway), Jondaryan (Western Railway), or Kilkivan (North Coast
branch railway)—the most splendid fruit-growing soil and climatic con-
ditions abound, and upon a recent visit Professor Shelton stated that he
was very greatly impressed by the excellent condition of the orchards,
which abounded in orange, apricot, peach and plum trees of the finest
■description.


Again on the Gregory River, in the Gulf of Carpentaria (between the
18th and 19th parellels of S. Lat. and on the 139th meridian of E. Long.),
there is splendid land awaiting the orchardist, as the following account of
what has been done will show :
It has already been proved by Mr. Barrett, of Gregory Downs, that
orange, lemon, and banana trees grow rapidly, and in due season yield a
prolific crop of fruit. Grape vines, too, take kindly to the soil and climate.
I have had the pleasure of eating as fine a sample of grapes locally grown
as may be found in the vineyards about Brisbane. Need it be added that
all kinds of vegetables grow luxuriantly, except, of course, during the very
warm months. A market for potatoes, maize, fruit, cabbage, butter,
cheese, fowls, &c., could be found at Burketown, Normanton, and
Croydon.
Brief reference has been made to the banana and grape crops, and
although the former constitutes at present a very large, and probably the
most important section of our fruit industry, vine culture will in all pro-
bability soon take the lead. Until the taste for dried bananas (of which
excellent samples are turned out at Buderim Mountain) has grown con-
siderably, the market for this fruit will be limited. Not so with the fruit
of the vine. Besides the historic use in the form of wine, there is a good
opening for the dried fruit. As stated by Mr. Benson, some localities are
not so suited to the growth of the very finest sorts ; but in our broad
extent of country suitable soils and climatic conditions can be found for
the production of the best qualities of raisins and currants. The quantities
and values of all kinds of imported fruits in 1895 (green excepted) were as
follows :—Bottled (equal to 15,855 dozen qts.), value £5128 ; dried,
410,313 lbs., value £10,077 ; currants, 1,535,087 lbs., value £12,001 ;
raisins, 941,783 lbs., value £9851 ; pulp, 108$ tons, value £2lll ; Total,
£39,186.
Of these it will be noticed that grape products constitute more than
half the value, so that the importance of the trade is very apparent, The
growing of suitable sorts and the erection of drying apparatus are in pro-
gress, and samples of the finished product are highly spoken of. I should
mention that successful experiments in this direction have been made by
Mr. Lester, of Roma, and Mr. Searle, of Mitchell.
The position of VITICULTURE in Queensland has been very ably
dealt with in a series of papers, written at the request of the Agricultural
Department —which appeared in the “ Brisbane Courier,” —from which I
have taken the liberty of making the following extracts (the writer is Mr.
Henry A. Tardent, of the Wine-grower’s Association, of Roma): —
“ In the Northern part of the Colony the vine grows luxuriantly,
giving an abundance of shoots and leaves. On the Eastern coast of


South Queensland the vine is grown profitably in many places, especially
the American varieties. The principal drawbacks here are the absence of
sufficient frosts to give a rest to the sap, and superabundance of rain—not
seldom at vintage time ; still, the results obtained by men like Childs and
Capner, Cox, Lambert, and others, in the neighbourhood of Brisbane,
show that pluck and energy can, to a certain extent, overcome those
difficulties. On the Dividing Range, at a height of some 2000 ft., the vine
is more at home. About Warwick there are already a few vineyards
(Kircher’s and others) situated on granitic soils, which have made a name
for their products, some of which are being already exported to Scotland.
North-west of those places extends the plateau of which I have spoken
The “Fruit of the Vine” (Roma, Maranoa).
above. It slopes gently towards the centre of the continent, and
comprises over 100,000 square miles, nearly all included in the basin of
the tributaries of the Upper Darling River. Numerous and of vast extent
are the patches of soil here suitable for the vine. The town of Roma, on
the Western Railway line, 820 miles from Brisbane, occupies nearly the
centre of it, and, strange to say, it is here that the wine industry has
made a start, and come to stay. I intend to dwell more particularly on
vine-growing in this particular distrtct, not only because I know it better
than other places in the colony, but also because it is unquestionably at


the present time the principal vine-growing centre in Queensland. The
average rainfall is about 26in. annually, and the aggregate heat necessary
to bring the grape to maturity is here obtained in about five months time
—from September to February inclusive.”
After describing the introduction of the vine to the district, about the
year 1872, and the varieties planted—mostly table grapes, such as Black
Hamburg, Black Prince, Doradillo, White Syrian, and Sweet William—
Mr. Tardent states that about 16 years ago new kinds of wine-making
grapes were largely planted. These are the Black Cluster, Black
Hermitage, Carbenets, Pino, White and Green Solferino, Verdeilho r
White Portugal, Reisling, &c. “ Our Black Cluster, known elsewhere
under the names of Mataro and Espar, originated, I think, in the south
of France, and in Spain. In cold districts it gives a somewhat harsh
wine ; but here in our sunny climate it has proved to be an excellent
acquisition. It shoots late, is hardy, and fairly prolific. When well
treated it gives an excellent red wine of a claret type, especially when
judiciously blended with Black Hermitage. This latter, called also La
Petite Sirrah, from its original habitat in Persia, has formed for centuries
the main “ cepage ” of the celebrated Hermitage vineyards in France.
Here it thrives well, and gives large crops of superior fruits, provided it is
pruned long and given plenty of room.”
After reference to the 1895 Report of the Registrar-General—which,
by the way, gives the area as being 1782 acres in bearing, and 289 not yet
bearing, of which total about one-fourth is situated in the Roma district—
Mr. Tardent goes on to show that with greater railway facilities, such as
would exist if direct communication were effected with Melbourne or
Adelaide in the South, or Port Darwin in the North of the Continent, we
would be able to supply the Southern capitals for some weeks prior to
their own season, and even far away “ Londoners ” might with the aid of
Australian shipments enjoy this princely fruit for at least eight months of
the year.
The production of grapes in 1895 was equal to about 1900 tons ; of
this —according to Mr. Tardent’s statements —I gather that some 1700
tons were consumed in the making of wine, leaving 200 tons for eating
purposes. Many of our grapes are extremely luscious, and bear carriage
remarkably well, and are, therefore, admirably suited for eating in a raw
state. The output of wine in the above year was 288,208 gallons. On
looking at our statistics for 1895, I find that there was an import to the
value of £27,188 ; 4,804 gallons of sparkling wine having paid a duty of
10s. a gallon on entry, and 89,269 gallons of still wines—a duty of 6d.
per gallon ! ! Surely a much larger home production may be expected in
the next few years, and this large sum of money be retained in the
Colony !


ORANGES.
As has been already stated, this fruit has made its way to the
Southern markets, and there established a reputation which doubtless will
grow with years. At the present time a large proportion of our output is
absorbed by shipments to the adjacent colonies when the fruit is scarce in
their markets, but with additional openings for the disposal of this crop, a
very great extension of the industry would be at once made possible.
Many parts of Queensland are as eminently suited to the perfect
development of the orange, as are the shores of the Mediterranean ; and
better methods of gathering, packing, and shipping will place us in a posi-
tion to command a market in these latitudes during their winter season.
With the object of testing the Canadian market during the out-season, a
few shipments were made by Messrs. Huddart —Parker’s steamers, but
owing to an alteration in the service, these were not carried out to a suc-
cessful issue. Upon the first opportunity, however, our indefatigable
Department of Agriculture will doubtless take up the matter again, and
now that commodious cold-storage has been provided on the British India
Co.’s, steamers running between Queensland and London, the successful
landing of this fruit is only a question of time.
The principal district devoted to orange culture in the colony is Mary-
borough, of which the soil has been 'proved to be most exceptionally suitable ;
the area in 1895 was 174 acres. Next in point of area is the district of
Cardwell (in the North) with 136 acres ; then follow Gatton —129 acres ;
Bowen—los acres ; and Douglas—lol acres (Northern district). It will
therefore be seen that the cultivation of this fruit is carried on over an
enormous extent of country, covering each of the three great divisions of
the colony. The area in 1895 was, however, only 1900 acres, producing
an average crop of 1050 doz. to the acre, a fairly satisfactory result, con-
sidering the dry weather experienced —the five years’ average being 1131
doz. per acre.
In some of the districts, notably Charters Towers and Cardwell, the
yield was quite phenomenal; the former averaging 4026 doz., and the
latter 3000 doz. per acre.
A special feature of this crop is the great success attendant on small
areas to the west of the Main Range.
The following extract from a paper read by a Mr. Biddles at the Mary-
borough Agricultural Conference of 1891, gives in a few concise words,
the practical aspects of orange culture : —“ We will say a man takes one
acre and plants it with seventy-five trees ; it can be well done for £2O.
Another £ls or £2O a-year, at the outside, for five years will bring it up to
£IOO or thereabouts. You can then count upon a tree bearing 100
dozen ; that at 3d. a dozen is 255. a tree, or £9O 15s. for one acre a year.
I have taken from one tree 500 dozen a year for the last three years, and


that is not a third of what you hear of sometimes. I put this estimate low,,
so as to allow plenty of margin for a few years. As the population of
Queensland increases the demand for this most popular fruit will become
greater, and will far exceed the supply. In my opinion, anyone going
in for orange growing could not call it a venture, for if they make it a
legitimate business it is a certain success.”
PINEAPPLES.
At one time a great favorite, and source of some splendid incomes,
this crop has seen many “ ups and downs.” The gross production in
1894 was 686,135 dozen (just double that of 1893), but in 1895 there were
very few more than in 1893, although the area had increased nearly 5%.
This fluctuation may be partly attributed to want of markets (and con-
sequent small returns), and partly to a fungoid disease which attacked the
plantations a few years ago for the first time, but which at present does
not appear to give any cause for serious apprehension if the proper steps
are taken immediately upon its appearance.
The area occupied in 1895 with this delicious fruit was 847 acres, of
which 447 acres were situated in the Brisbane district ; the increase on
1894 for this district was equal to about 25% —a fact which speaks
volumes for the favour in which this crop is here held. From a report of
the proceedings of the Bockhampton Agricultural Conference previously
referred to, I clip the following joint testimony as to the profitable nature
of the industry in Queensland :
“ Mr. Jones said he had it on very good authority that one gentle-
man in the south, who had eleven acres of land planted, had been ex-
porting pineapples for some years past to the annual value of £l,lOO,
while another grower, who had only three acres, realised £3OO a year.
Professor Shelton said that having had occasion to inquire a good deal
into the operations of pineapple-growers in the Southern part of the
colony, he could throw some light on the matter. Some weeks ago he
visited an establishment near Nundah. The owner had only five acres of
ground under cultivation, and his income from that patch was never less
than £7OO, and often went over £1 000. He had asked about a dozen
growers what an acre of pineapples was worth per annum, and the lowest
figure was £6O. Land that grew pineapples about Brisbane cost from £6O
to £l2O an acre. The other day he visited a pineapple garden of three or
four acres, a few miles up the north coast from Brisbane, and found that
the owner, on this small patch, was keeping a family and paying interest
on the purchase of his land, which cost him £125 an acre.
Several attempts—more or less successful—have been made to ship
the pineapple to distant countries, where their advent in a time of scarcity
would ensure a splendid price. All attempts, under ordinary conditions


of temperature, have come somewhat short of expectations, some few lots
arriving in condition, whilst others were totally spoiled. Recent develop-
ments in oversea carriage have made possible a big trade with Great
Britain, and I am pleased to record the safe arrival of a trial shipment
in the newly-erected refrigerating chambers of a British India Co’s
Steamer the “ Jumna.” The shipment consisted of 18 cases of pines
and 19 cases of mangoes.
Both in the neighbourhood of Brisbane, and further North, efforts
have been made to preserve the fruit, and, after many discouragements
loss of preserving plant by fire and sometimes scarcity of fruit—the in-
dustry of canning pineapples is now being carried on by more
than one Brisbane firm, and a really excellent article is turned out.
The following brief report on the tinned pineapple trade in London,
was forwarded by the Agent-General, and appeared in the local press
u pineapples (whole) : This is an article for which there is a very large
demand in England. The supplies come almost entirely from Singapore.
Tinned “ pines” can be bought from importers at the following figures :
l’s, li’s, H’s, lf’s, 2’s, 2i’s, 2*’S, 2f’s, 3’s, 3£’s, 2s. 9d. per doz. up
to ss. 6d, and 6s. 6d. per doz. The packers make tins for the different
sizes of pines, from lib. to so that they can make use of all the
sizes of fruit. They are, of course, graded afterwards, and put in
seperate cases according to the weight.
Chunks : The packers in Singapore during the last year or two have
introduced a new form of packing pineapples, in the shape of what they
call “chunks.” The pineapple, before being put into the tin, is cut
down in sections and again cut across. In this way the pineapple, after
the tin is opened, is more easily served at table. These fetch a higher
price than the others, and are gradually taking the place of the whole
pines. There is no use packing these chunks, however, smaller than
The prices of these run as follows: — ss. 6d. to 65.; 7s.
to 7s. 6d. These low prices, of course, have the effect of popularising
the fruit very much, and the result is, there is almost an unlimited de-
mand, not only in England, but all over the Continent. For Continental
use, the pineapples come without syrup, or, as it is called, “ au naturel.”
For the English market, only pineapples in syrup are taken.”
In 1895, some 214 packages of locally preserved pineapples
(value £105) were exported. Speaking at Rockhampton, in 1891, Mr.
J. S. Edgar, a gentleman of practical experience in fruit culture, stated
that Messrs. John Moir & Sons, of London, had expressed their willing-
ness to take all the preserved fruit which could be sent from a certain
factory, and yet, owing to lack of fruit at the time, this factory had not
received the support to which it was entitled. To keep up a supply
for one factory, several hundred acres would require to be put under


cultivation. There is abundance of land close to the railway lines
eminently suited for the purpose. The variety most favoured by pre-
servers is the Queen, on account of its superior flavour and evenness in
the size of the fruit. For local consumption, or shipping to the southern
colonies, the Providence, Smooth-leaved Cayenne, Sugar Loaf, Black
Jamaica and Trinidad are good sorts. The fruits of some of them grow
to a large size. At certain seasons of the year, when plentiful, the pine-
apple may be purchased wholesale for 3d. per doz., good-sized fruit, or
each retail. Besides being a pleasant table fruit, it is stated to possess
valuable properties for the cure of diptheria. Pineapples grow to a very
large size in certain parts of Queensland, 101 b. to 181 b. being no uncom-
mon weight for them to reach, and in Mackay they have been known to
weigh 301 b.
MANGO.
As a dessert fruit, as a condiment, and even as a medicine, this
is rapidly taking a prominent position.
As stated by Mr. L. A. Bernays in his “ Cultural Industries for
Queensland” there is no doubt that the mango is one of the greatest
delicacies of the vegetable world, and it is a notorious fact that a liking
for this fruit—once acquired—is undying. Its native habitat is India, but
so readily does it adopt itself to varied conditions of climate that it thrives
on the Southern and Central seaboard of Queensland ; although, naturally,
it attains its highest degree of perfection nearer the Equator. This
will be apparent from the following averages obtained in 1895 : —Northern
district averaged 1,400 doz. per acre ; Central, 1,108 doz. per acre;
Southern, 345 doz. per acre. So numerous are the varieties of this
fruit, that even an acknowledged authority, such as the gentleman above
named, has not attempted the task of classifying them. It may be
sufficient to say that the best mangoes are of good size (20 to 30
ozs. weight), free from fibre, and when the peel is removed (which may be
very easily effected) the pulp should be of a soft creamy consistency, so as
to enable it to be readily taken off the seed with a spoon. The flavour
and juiciness of a good mango are the delight of an epicure. The total
crop of this colony in 1895 was nearly 300,000 doz. (off 261 acres), more
than twice the product of 1894, thus showing its increasing popularity. In
speaking of pineapple exportation, reference was made to a consign-
ment of mangoes, which duly arrived in London, a portion of the
shipment being intended for Her Majesty the Queen —to whom they will
doubtless have been presented ere this ; this leads me to the subject
of foreign markets, and the following extract from our “ daily press” will
serve to show the possibilities of engaging in export for medicinal
purposes : —“ The “ Medical Press” says :—We are told that a determined
effort is to be made in the wholesale fruit trade next year to bring


the Indian mango to London in sufficient quantities to be of commercial
consideration. Its introduction would undoubtedly be the signal for its
use as a medicinal agent. The rind of the fruit (Garcinia Mangostana)
contains a volatile principle, allied in action to pure terebene, and a bitter
crystallisable substance to which the name of “ Mangostin ’ has been
applied. A decoction of the fruit is commonly employed in tropical
climates as an astringent, and is found useful in sore throat, nasal catarrh,
and other allied conditions. Mango chutney is used as a condiment, and
is found efficacious in the treatment of many forms of dyspepsia. Dr.
Murrell, who has obtained a small supply of the fresh fruit from India,
finds that it may be given with advantage in the treatment of chronic
bronchitis and winter cough.”
“A Railway Lengthsman and his Travelling Gear.”
In the form of “mango chutney,” as shown above, there is a
brilliant future before this fruit both in Australasian colonies and in
England.
At the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879, Messrs. Acheson
and Allen (two Queensland growers) were rewarded by prizes for their
preparation of chutney, and preserved mangoes ; and Professor Shelton
has demonstrated in a practical way, the ease with which it lends itself to
every method of preservation. So impressed is the last named gentleman
with this fact that in the course of a lecture on “ canning and fruit


preserving, he said that if he were going to plant an orchard along
the coast, he would have live or six mango trees to every one of any other
sort.
i
Propagation by seed being somewhat unreliable, inarching is the
commonly employed method. According to the previously quoted
authority—Mr. Edgar—plants which were taken up from the seedbed in
April, May, June and July, and planted in the open ground, throve very
well: so that the suitability of our autumn and winter season for this
operation is apparent.
The mango flowers from September to December, and the fruit is
generally ripened during January, February and March—and occasionally
even earlier. The tree does not mature sufficiently to produce a crop
of fruit for from three to six years.
COCOANUT. '
6,000 dozen of these were produced in 1895 from an area of seven
acres, as against 682 dozen in 1894, and the output promises to be much
larger for 1896 and 1897. Much attention has been bestowed upon this
invaluable variety of the palm tribe. The Cingalese have a saying that
this tree serves for ninety-nine known uses, the hundredth cannot be
discovered by man. However, this may be, its oil, fibre and food pro-
ducing qualities are such as to justify the extraordinary trouble to which
our Government have put themselves in the acclimatisation of this exotic
At the date of the first annual report of the officer in charge of these
operations, over 10,000 cocoanuts had been planted on the islands ad-
joining our coasts, and these have since been added to, so that when
maturity is reached, the production of nuts will be greatly augmented.
OLIVE.
Repeated attention has been drawn to this tree as a most valuable
subject for the attention of Queensland pomologists. For several years,
the olive has fruited in the neighbourhood of Brisbane and on the Darling
Downs ; it is only lately, however, that any extensive groves have been
planted, and as the tree does not fruit for from 10 to 17 years after planting
(according to Major Chapman—Bulletin No. 10 of the Department of Agri-
culture), there are no results worth chronicling. Another authority
Mr. L. A. Bernays—states that in South America, a fair crop of oil is
obtained at the fourth year. The average yield of an acre of olives is
variously stated at 60 to 64 gallons of oil ; this, at the moderate estimate
of Bs. per gallon, Avould, as shown by the above gentleman, give a hand-
some and ever-growing return. Although the olive lives to a greater
age than man, and gives an increasing yield of fruit if well cared for, it
does not invariably bear every year, a good season being counter-balanced
by a poorer one, and vice versa.


The two writers above mentioned, give the fullest information regard-
ing methods of planting, harvesting and preparing the products of the
olive. At present, Queensland does not possess any mills for crushing
the olive, linseed, sunflower seed, cocoa nut, &c., but with the extended
cultivation of these oil-giving products, it is reasonable to expect that
the machinery will be forthcoming.
The following extract from the Age , will show what Victoria is doing
in this matter, an example which we might well imitate : —“ Since the
Government oil-crushing plant was put into operation by Mr. Taverner
about twelve months ago, it has done excellent work in various parts of
the colony, well justifying the expenditure of £BOO on its purchase. The
Railway Department is already using a good deal of the oil, and finds it of
first-class quality, paying for it Bd. per gallon less than for the imported
article. On the English market, Victorian linseed oil is worth £l6 10s.
and that obtained from sunflowers, £l7 per ton. The residual product of
the former oil-cake makes the industry a highly useful adjunct to dairy
farming. The oil cake contains 7 per cent, of oil, sometimes as much as
10 per cent., and forms a first-class fattening food for cattle. Some which
was produced in this colony brought £6 per ton in the English markets
about three months ago. The oil industry, though still in a purely
initiatory stage, seems to have a very promising future before it.”
FIG ( Ficus carica.)
This eminently Mediterranean tree is similarly placed (with regard to
Queensland fruit-growers) to its compatriot the olive.
Although growing luxuriantly in this part of the world, its cultn a-
tion has not been systematically pursued, and imported figs in a dry state
continue to have a small demand, whereas locally produced fruit—equal
in quality and lower in price—might readily be had for the growing.
Indeed, that the flavour of some of the locally raised fruit is quite equal
to that gathered fresh on the Mediterranean shores, I can personally
vouch for. It is a matter of difficulty to ascertain even the approximate
area under this crop, but from a comparison of the returns for 1894 and
1895 it would appear that 9 or 10 acres is about the extent of ground
really devoted to the crop. The production seems to be about 200 doz.
per acre, which at 3d. per dozen when fresh, or say 2d. per doz. in a dried
state, might be considered a fairly remunerative crop for the extremely
small attention which fig culture involves. In its native habitat, this tree
attains a great age, and the writer has seen on the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea the most prolific crops taken off apparently barren
so il stony ridges of which a sunny aspect, and excellent natural drainage
seemed to be the chief features. Doubtless the possibilities of this fruit
here will be again put before our orchardists by Mr. Benson, as he is
already reported to have done.


LIME, LEMON, CITRON, SHADDOCK AND CUMQUAT (OR
KUMQUAT.)
These fruit bearing trees—all of which are of the citrus family,
and well-known commercially—are so admirably suited to this climate as
to form in portions of Queensland and the adjacent islands immense
natural orchards. In the neighbourhood of Ipswich, there were formerly
large quantities of the wild lime to be had for the picking—unhappily now
all but extinct, owing to the ruthless way in which the trees have
been treated. The shaddock also finds in Queensland a congenial climate,
and in the neighbouring islands of Fiji is reported to be so prolific
that the seedling trees are covering the river banks.
Speaking of the year 1895, the Registrar-General reports that one
grower made 300 gallons of lime juice from the produce of 8 acres
planted with limes—which at a low estimate should mean a return of £lO
per acre.
The lemon crop totalled 22,060 doz., and averaged 735 doz. to
the acre ; say, equal to £9 4s. Od. per acre. The cultivation of this fruit
was confined to the Northern and Southern districts (on either side of the
Range) and the best average return was obtained west of the Range, in
the North, viz.: 1817 doz. per acre—a handsome return, even at 3d. per
doz, (£22 14s. Od. per acre.) The Citron is not accounted for in the
Agricultural Returns, and as the demand is not, and is never likely to be,
as great as that for the two fruits just mentioned, it may suffice to say
that requirements can be amply met by local production—the perfection
of the Queensland grown citron and the excellence of local peel manu-
facture being such as to warrant the hope of a more than local demand
for candied citrus fruits.
Other methods of curing are sometimes adopted by Southern
Colonies, and might be so by us with advantage. Mildura growers of
oranges and lemons have not many months ago realised high prices for
stocks held by them, lemons netting up to 16s. per case and oranges
between 14s. and 15s.—of the latter, a Mr. Fitzpatrick preserved 200
cases in dry sand.
The demands of the London market are shown in the following, under
date January, 1897 :—“ All the manufacturers of orange, lemon, and
citron peel buy their fruit in brine. Citron comes from Corsica and the
coast of Morocco. The most esteemed comes from Corsica. It is shipped
to this market in casks containing Bcwt. to lOcwt. of fruit. The fruit is
simply cut in halves, put into the casks, and—when full—brine is poured in
of a strength sufficient to float an egg. The present value on this
market is 20s. to 225. per cwt. of fruit, They are cheap at present. The
price in a normal year would be about 255. Oranges and lemons come
£


from Madeira and Messina, in pipes of 6cwt. to 7cwt. of fruit. They are
prepared in exactly the same way as the citrons. The market for these is
very quiet at present. Prices are from 17s, to 18s. In a normal season,
the prices would be 20s. to 21s. per cwt. of fruit.
The Cumquat is a very heavy bearer, but as the demand is at present
small there would not appear to be much scope for extension, except
perhaps for the growers’ own consumption in the form of a preserve, of
which it furnishes a most delicious example. The yield in 1895 was 1400
dozen from an acre.
The Shaddock is not in great favour for eating purposes, although a
palatable preserve can be prepared, but its use for stocks on which to graft
allied fruits has been advocated, and it would seem that for this purpose a
imited demand may arise.
MELON (CitruUus vulgaris.)
The cultivation of this favourite is mainly carried on in the Southern
and Central littoral districts, the best average return in 1895
was obtained in the North-West of the Range—the area planted
there was insignificant ; the largest area and next best average being in
the South of Queensland. The exact official figures were—loo acres, for
a yield of 9,209 dozen.
A considerable trade is done with Ifrisbane and some of the larger
towns, where (at a low estimate) a net average of Bs. a dozen, wholesale,
is realised the season through. The returns at the above price would be
close on £l4 per acre, hut many growers within driving distance of the
metropolis are personally known to the writer to have made considerably
more than this amount by supplying the fruit trade with early melons.
PASSION-FRUIT (Passiflora edulis.) GRANADILLA (P
Quadrangularis.)
The first-mentioned is in considerable demand, both locally and in
the Southern Colonies. The \ ine from which it is obtained is of rapid
growth and fairly hardy, very leafy, and a prolific fruit bearer. Screens
of this warmth-loving plant may be seen on many a verandah in the
South of Queensland, and quite a large quantity of fruit thus passes into
consumption which cannot possibly be included in the annual returns.
AsMar as records go, 14,000 dozen were produced in 1895 from 6 acres—
a fairly satisfactory yield considering that the wholesale price is rarely less
than Id. per dozen. Experiments conducted by Professor Shelton in
1893, demonstrated the keeping qualities of this fruit under artificial cold
for aperiod amply sufficient to land them on the European markets, so
that if the taste for Passion-fruit and the closely allied Granadilla could be
cultivated sufficiently, we might look to a large extension of the area under
vines.


In size, the first named resembles a small egg; whilst the larger
variety of this species (P assi/lora macrocarpa ; Masters) has on the authority
of Mr. F. M. Bailey, attained a weight of 81bs.
PEACH ( Primus persica ) and its allies.
These include the nectarine, almond, cherry-plum, plum, cherry, and
apricot, and with the exception of the peach may be said to be cultivated
solely in the South of Queensland.
The 1895 agricultural returns give the area under peach trees as 16
acres (?), from which the yield was 22,808 doz. peaches. Of these about
8000 doz. were produced from an acre of trees in the North-—a truly phe-
nomenal yield.
Nectarines, plums, cherries, and apricots showed on an average 90
doz. 60 bus. 38 lbs., and 185 doz. per acre respectively. Of cherry plums
and almonds no detailed statement is made, but all the above are heavy
croppers between the Range and the Southern border—in fact on the
Darling Downs generally.
Many are the varieties of peaches and plums grown here, some of them
thriving on the coast lands, but few can excel the “ Toowoomba
peach ’ for size and lusciousness. “ China Flat” peaches are well suited to
our climate, and largely grown, and as this fruit ripens several weeks
earlier in Queensland than in New South Wales, where as much as 17s.
the half-case has been paid in the off-season, a remunerative opening
exists for those who will produce only the best of fruit, and go to the
trouble of careful marketing.
From the accompanying newspaper clipping of quite recent date it
will be seen that there is also a market in London, if our shippers will
comply with the technical requirements of the trade in tinned fruits. It
is pleasing to note that we have a gentleman in our midst who is so well
qualified to give instruction in present-day American canning as Professor
Shelton—
“ Apricots: There is also a good demand for this fruit, both whole and
in halves. Prices for 31b. tins run from 6s. up to 95., according to quality.
A large trade is also done in this country in apricot pulp. This is packed
in five-kilo tins (ten tins to the case). • The preparation is very simple,
namely—the fruit is cut in halves, the stones removed, and then the halves
are put into the tin. No sugar or other matter is added. The tins are, of
course, processed in exactly the same way as for the fruits.
“ Peaches: There is also a good demand for this fruit* the finer kind
being what is called the “ Lemon Cling,” where the stone clings to the
peach. Prices of these range from 6s. to, 10s., according,to quality.
u Cherries: There is, only a moderate demand for these. Prices are from
7s. to 95.” ,


Whilst on the subject of fruit-preserving, I quote the following re
pulp fruit, from which I think our own growers and preservers may get a
hint or two. The samples referred to were of the best class of F rench
pulp, imported for the Victorian Department of Agriculture with a view
to opening up a similar trade between that colony and Great Britain .
“ These were opened at the Department of Agriculture (says the
Argus) in the presence of a number of persons interested in the trade.
The samples sent were 101 b. tins of apricots, raspberries, and plums, and
it was reassuring to find that there was nothing in the quality of the pulp
which Victorians may not with care easily hope to rival. The best tin of
apricots was, no doubt, of good quality, rich in colour, and the fruit cut
in halves retaining its attractive appearance. This, Mr. Knight (the fruit
expert) pointed out, was a great consideration, buyers being able at a glance
to note the character of the fruit, and see that it was free from blight.
When Mr. H. M. Gooch was in London lately he accompanied Mr. Sin-
clair to a buyer of pulp, who showed them samples of the Australian and
American fruit, the latter being all in perfect condition, while the Aus-
tralian pulp was made unsightly by the presence of stems and leaves, a
fact that at once greatly lessens its value. The French fruit, like the
American, is perfectly clean. Mr. Gooch noticed, too, that there was an
excess of liquor in the Australian pulp as compared with the American,
which was fairly solid. The pulp is worth from £l2 to £l5 a ton in London,
and these rates, fruitgrowers say, will pay well. The tins in use by the
French are 6in. by 10in., and ten of them in a case hold just 1001 b. of
pulp. It is likely that a quantity of pulp will be shipped from Mildura
ihis year”
PERSIMMON ( Diospyros KaJci.)
This is a fruit of recent importation —sometimes called Japanese Date-
plum, from its country of origin—which has, however, proved itself to be
so thoroughly at home in our climate as to induce cultivation to a large
extent. Naturally, in the space of a few short years, little more than the
supply of local requirements has been possible, but the fairly remunerative
market which still exists will probably lead to heavier plantings.
The yield during 1895 in the Southern Division was 8826 doz., off
24 acres (aver. 134 doz. per acre), and in the Central Division, 125 doz.
for two acres. None are reported as growing in the North, or to the west
of the Range, in either of the other divisions. According to our Colonial
Botanist the tree requires a free, rich soil, and not much pruning.. The
rank-growing sorts will be much assisted in fruit-bearing by judiciously
pruning the roots. *.
APPLE (Pyrus Malus), and its allies.
This fruit, together with the pear, quince, and medlar, are practically
confined to the Western side of the Main Range—adjoining the New
South Wales border.


Of apples, the Southern district (west of the Range) produced 85,948
dozen from 79 acres, say 1088 dozen per acre, and—strange to say—the
average production (1000 dozen per acre) and the total production were
greater in the north of the Colflny, than to the east of the southern dis-
trict.
As will have been observed, the opinion has been expressed by our
Fruit Expert, Mr. Benson, that this Colony is not so well suited to the
production of fine-flavoured apples as are the neighbouring colonies of
New South Wales and Tasmania. Sufficient has, However, been said to
demonstrate that as far as yield is concerned, we have no reason to com-
plain, and there may yet be found localities where this fruit will grow to
perfection. Occasionally, some excellent apples are met with of local pro-
duction, but it must be confessed that many are wanting in the delicacy
of flavour so apparent in those from colder climes.
As an encouragement to present growers to aim at producing the best
at their command, it may be stated that one large local fruit-preserving
firm, at least, is determined to make a special feature of evaporating
apples, apricots and peaches, and eventually, cooking and dessert raisins.
The drying capacity of the apparatus referred to is sufficient to turn
out ten tons of prepared fruit per 24 hours, a plant which should in a
very short time (if fruit is available) to supply all local require-
ments, to the exclusion of the £82,000 worth returned as imported in one
year (1895). To those contemplating a trial of the London fresh fruit
market, the following cull from a Southern paper, respecting the season’s
first fruit shipment, per “ China,” leaving Melbourne about 20th February,
will be of interest: —“ As the Victorian growers will only need about half
the space available in the “ China ” —namely, 6,400 cases —the remainder
of the space will be filled with Tasmanian fruit. Eleven other boats will
follow, leaving each week till the Bth May, but Victorian experts advise
that the fruit should be forwarded not later than the 24th April, as after
that time it will come into competition with the early English cherries and
strawberries. From the end of March till early in May there is practically
no fruit in London which can come into competition with Australian fruit,
and colonial growers have, therefore, an excellent opportunity of doing
business. During last season, Tasmania shipped about 140,000 cases, and
Victoria nearly 14,000 cases of apples, and the prices realised averaged,
for the best shipments, about 11s. 6d. per case. The various items of
expense to Victorian growers were as follows:—Freight, ocean, 4s. Id.;
cost of special export case, yd.; tissue paper for wrapping apples, also
lining paper and paper shavings, including rail freight on material, Bd.;
freight to Port Melbourne, say, 8£d»; charge for alloting space, super-
vising shipment, exchange, &c., Bd.; dock dues, &c., London, com-
mission and insurance, say, 9d.; total, 6s. 9d. At 11s. 6d. per case, this


left 4s. 9d. net for the apples at the garden ; but some individual growers
averaged 12s. to 15s. 6d. per case in London , which netted them 6s. 9d,
to 9s. 3d. per case at the garden. Mr. Nepean Smith estimated that the
expenses per case in connection with the small shipments from South
Australia, last season, amounted to 7s. Id.” The shipment per “ China,”
mentioned above, has realised 12s. to 20s. per case in London.
The Pear ( Pyrus communis) has not, so far, been grown to nearly the
same extent as the apple, possibly because it does not carry so heavy a
crop. The remark made with regard to flavour in the apple applise
equally to the pear, but should a trade be impracticable in the green fruit,
large quantities might be marketed in the tinned form. This is the most
popular amongst this class of goods in the London sale rooms, and the
best Californian pears were fetching 14s. a dozen at the close of January,
of this year. Although the price is only 10s. to 12s. per dozen 31b. tins,
when in fair supply, the trade might be worth trying for ; but for inferior
sorts, it must be remembered, the demand is almost nil. This class of
fruit is packed twenty-four tins to the case. The method of canning
could be better described by our Instructor in Agriculture.
Quinces ( Pyrus cydonia) are slow of sale in the Colonies, as well as
in Great Britain (tinned.) The production, of which details are found in
the Report for 1895 was 1888 dozen from 5 acres ; no increase may be
looked for at present.
The Medlar ( Pyrus germanica ) grows fairly well in the colder
localities, but is not a favourite. No record of this crop is taken.
' RASPBERRY ( Rubus Idaeus.)
Found in a native state ( Rubus rosaefolius; Sm.) over a large
extent of country. Sometimes it alternates with the Cape Gooseberry
as a spontaneous crop from newly cleared land. The indigenous variety
being wanting in flavour, and the European variety being successful only
in a few localities (such as the Downs) a cross has been suggested by our
Colonial Botanist, which would doubtless lead to an extended cultivation
for market. A few American Blackberries, of which “ Lawton’s” may be
mentioned as an example, fruit freely, around and about Brisbane. It
would appear that a judicious choice of sorts of the latter, which belong to
the same family as our Raspberry,, as well as some of the American
‘• Black-cap” raspberries ( Rubus occidentalis) might result in valuable
additions to our fruit list.
STRAWBERRY ( Fragaria vesca.)
Has been grown with great success on some of the volcanic loams of
the coast; also on the Darling Downs. A fairly good market exists for
good samples; a favourite dish in the largest towns being “ strawberries
and cream.”


GOOSEBERRY (Ribes Grossularia) and its allies.
The cultivation of this fruit is confined to the South of the Colony
and to a small extent at present. The yield recorded in 1895 was 83
quarts per acre. In common with the Red Currant (R. rubrum)
Black currant (R. nigrum ) and white currant (R. rubrum, Var. album)
it succeeds well on the Darling Downs near the southern border, and in a
few favoured localities east of the Range—but not on the coast.
RHUBARB ( Rheun Rhaponticum.)
Although it is not the fruit, but the leaf stalk which is used for
culinary purposes, the above is of interest to Queensland fruit-growers
inasmuch as the plant thrives in the Southern districts, and is in no very
great supply so far. J
ROCK MELON ( Cucumis melo) and its allies.
This is not so great a favourite here as in Europe, but to those who
have a liking for the fruit it is readily obtainable, as it will produce
abundant crops of fine flavoured fruit in the South of the Colony, if
European raised seed be sown. The cucumber (C. Sativus ) grows almost
ike a weed, and is very much in favour here. The average 1895 yield
vas 480 doz. per acre. Of the same natural order (Cucurbitacece are the
.umpkin ( Cucurbita Repo,) the Vegetable Marrow, and the Gourd; also
'he Chocho, Chouchou or Chayota (, Sechium edule) —all of which give good
delds in this Colony.
The return of pumpkins for 1895 was 3,403 tons—at the rate of
learly 4 tons to the acre. Isolated districts, viz: the Northern, west of
he Range, and the Southern, west of the Range, yielded over 4 tons per
ere. Little demand exists for the Chocho as a vegetable.
ENDIVE ( Cichorium Endivia ) AND CHICORY (C. intybus).
The former is not much in demand, although growing successfully,
he latteras also found here, but is not grown other than as a garden
lant.
ONION ( Allium Cepa ) and its allies.
Gi\es abundant crops in this colony, and when closely cultivated pro-
aces splendid bulbs. Notwithstanding the inducements towards growing
ie above, a considerable import took place in 1895 (over £ 11,000), so
tat there is evidently an excellent opening in this direction. The 1895
rerage yield was 2$ cwt. per acre. The Leek (A. porrum), Garlic (A.
tivum), and Shallot (A. ascalonicum), also thrive in Southern Queensland,
id are worthy of more extended cultivation.
CELERY (Apium Graveoleus )
Grows to perfection, and has a moderate sale, but no particulars of
e production are published.


CABBAGE ( Genus Brassica).
Under this popular term may be considered the many varieties c
vegetables, known as Cabbage, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Brussels sprouts
Kale Kohl-rabi ( Brassica oleracea). By far the most important posi 10
from’ a commercial standpoint is that of the first named, of w ic
150 262 dozen were produced in 1895—according to the Eegistra:
General’s report on that year. The bulk of this crop was obtained m tfc
Southern district, but the return in the Northern district, west of the Bang
(2,869 dozen per acre), was considerably over the average for the who.
colony.
The return of Cauliflowers was insignificant, and the others were n<
grown in sufficient quantities to warrant detailed notice.
Closely allied to the above are the Turnip (B. rapa) and the Swede (j
campestris), which are neither of them as extensively grown as their suit;
bility to our natural conditions, and high nutritive value would seem
warrant.
The yield per acre, as shown in the 1895 returns, was about 4 cwt.
turnips, and 4£ tons of swedes, and the cultivation was practically confirn
to the south-eastern corner of Queensland.
PARSNIP ( Peucedanum sativum).
This vegetable yields a heavy crop, and is met with in the markets
an article of household consumption, but is not grown for cow feed, as
Jersey and other countries. Its value for milk production is such th
farmers would do well to devote their attention to it as a crop. I
figures are available regarding the quantity at present grown, as it may
said to be practically nil.
CARROT ( Daucus carota).
Another valuable cattle food. Can be grown over a large area, a
offers great inducements to extensive culture.
TOMATO (. Lycopersicum esculentum).
Very large quantities of this fruit are raised annually, the returns
1895 being: 1256 cwt. from 39 acres, in the South-east of the colony,
large portion of this passes direct into the hands of householders, an
good deal of tomato sauce of very superior quality is made in their horn
and in bulk by the preserving works.
BEAN.
The Scarlet runner ( Phaseolus coccineus) and the French-
Haricot—Bean (P. Vulyaris) are mostly cultivated in Southern Quee
land. The return in this district for 1895 was about 266 bushels to
acre (all kinds). The results obtained in the Central Coastal distr
were not so favourable.


PEA ( Pisum sativum)
This is a favourite South Queensland garden crop, and gives a good
money return to the grower. The yield in 1895 was 99 bus. to the acre,
and as with most of the fruits and vegetables under review, in more
favourable seasons a much higher yield would be obtained..
SUNDRY TROPICAL, AND ECONOMIC PLANTS.
Amongst the former, may be mentioned as growing to perfection in
the North of the Colony;—The Jack Fruit tree {Artocarpus integrifolia );
Bread Fruit tree {A. incisa ) ; Alligator or Avocado Pear tree {Persea
gratissima) ; Litchi {Nephelium litchi) ; and Longan {Euphoria longana ,
Lam.—sometimes classed as a Nephelium with the Litchi, to which it
is however said to be much inferior in flavour). Both the Date palm
{Phoenix dactylifera) and Papaw {Carica papaya) have been planted in
most latitudes within the boundaries of the Colony, and as far as the
writer is aware have fruited in the Southern as well as the Northern
disticts. The return of fruit from the last mentioned tree in 1895 was
850 doz. in Central Queensland, and 100 doz. per acre in Northern
Queensland.
The Indian Tamarind {Tamarindus indica) and the Queensland
Tamarind {Diploglottis Cunninghamii ) are large trees, from which a
pulpy substance is obtained which may be made into a preserve. That
derived from the pods of the first mentioned tree has a medicinal value
as a laxative.
The Whampee {Clausena wampi ) for its fruit; the Divi Divi
{Caesalpinia coriaria) for its pods (worth £lO to £l3 per ton) ; the
Cassava plant {Manihot utillisima and M. aipi) for its tapioca product;
and the Arnotto shrub {Bixa orellana) for the colouring matter which it
yields; might be extensively cultivated here, as they have been successfully
grown in most of the Coastal districts, and only require trial on a com-
mercial scale.
Many kinds of Pepper thrive remarkably well here; both of the
climbing order (Piper nigrum; order Piperaceae) and the Capsicums—
the “ Chilli shrub ” (C. frutescens ; order Solanacese), the Bird’s Eye
Pepper (C. baccatum), and the Bell Pepper (C. grossum).
Of ginger (Zingiber officinalis), two acres planted in the North
yielded 11,200 lbs.
Yams {Dioscorea alata) and Taro {Colocasia antiquorum) are used by
the South Sea Islanders in their native land as food, and for this purpose
are sometimes cultivated in the North of this colony, where they grow to
perfection.
The pea nut {Arachis hypogoea) is cultivated in the North and South
of the colony, and its great value as the source of the “ nut oil” of com-


merce should gain for it a wide popularity. Between a sixth and a third
of its weight consists of oil, and besides the latter, a large quantity of
nitrogenous matter is contained in the nut—facts which are so highly
appreciated in the United States that several millions of bushels are
annually raised ! Reckoning 221bs. to the bushel, our 1895 crop was
equal to 65 bushels per acre !
Cowpea (used by many as a vegetable), Imphie, and Kaffir corn
yielded respectively about 53, 12, and 33 bushels per acre. As regards
the latter, as much as two crops can be obtained from one sowing. Broom
millet has lately been introduced to the colony; the yield in 1895 was
24 cwt. per acre. There is a steady demand for the stems for broom
making; and as the standard of manufacture becomes higher, so is the
demand likely to increase materially.
Of seed and fibre producing plants which are successfully grown, and
give much promise, the following may be mentioned: —Rhea fibre
(Boehmeria nevea); Jute (Corchorus olitorius); Hemp (Cannabis sativa) ;
Queensland hemp, or “ Sida retusa” (Sida rhombifolia) ; Max, or Linseed
(Linum usitatissimum), &c., &c. Other economic plants include the
Quinine tree (Cinchona calisaya, &c.) ; the Camphor tree (Cinnamonium
camphora); the European walnut (Juglans regia); the Hazel or Mlbert nut
(Corylece tribe); and the Sweet or Spanish Chestnut (Castanea sativa.)
The three last mentioned thrive well on the Downs.
HORTICULTURE
This affords a means of livelihood in many of the large towns of the
colony, and the establishments of several of our metropolitan nurserymen,
in particular, are veritable fairy lands. These are as remarkable for the
luxuriant outdoor growth of tropical and sub-tropical plants of exquisite
colours, or stately magnificence, as for the variety of “ old country
favourites which we here meet with. Most of the useful products of our
gardens have been dealt with in detail; it therefore remains for me to
touch briefly upon the ornamental department —embraced under the term
Floriculture ; and to this end I cannot do better than quote from the
admirable digest of this subject by Mr. Theodore Wright, as follows
“In the Darling Downs district many of the most popular florists’
flowers of Great Britain attain to great perfection, and amongst the
successes may be specified pansies, violets, carnations, pinks, picotees,
balsams, cockscombs, amaranths, phloxes, Canterbury bells, petunias,
geraniums, heliotropes, dahlias, sunflowers, Indian and Chinese pinks,
mignonette, sweet peas, holyhocks, portulacas, penstemons, chrysanthe-
mums ; in short, an almost endless variety of annuals, biennials, and
perennials from every clime grace the ornamental borders ; edgings of box,
and other British favourites, help to maintain the charm of early


associations. Amongst the flowering shrubs in all temperate localities of
the colony, the rose in its many varieties is deservedly popular and quite
at home. The rose of old England is loved as much for the country it
represents as for itself, and some of its species and varieties thrive
over the greater portion of Queensland. But on the Darling Downs may
be seen the lilac, laburnum, laurestinus, camellia, honeysuckle,
weigelia, veronica, abutilon, berberis, deutzia, duranta, euonymus, gar-
denia, rhododendron, hibiscus, hydrangea, holly, ivy, jasmine, laurel,
magnolia, spirea, viburnum, and hosts of other ornamental trees and
shrubs in great variety, besides an endless assortment of conifers and
taxads from almost all the countries under the sun.
“ Sub-tropical Queensland is very favourably circumstanced for the
cultivation of flowers. During winter many of the old favourites, such as
pansies, asters, ranunculi, primulas, cinerarias, violets, and other soft-
wooded annuals and herbaceous plants, thrive admirably ; and in the
summer, plants which are only to be seen in hot-houses in the British
Isles, are regular occupants of the border. The same remarks apply to
shrubs and ornamental trees. Roses in very great variety succeed
admirably. Many of the handsome flowering and ornamental trees and
shrubs from the Brazils, East and West Indies, Mauritius, and Cape of
Good Hope are thoroughly at home in the sub-tropics ; and gardens well
stocked and tended can be made to show to as good if not to better
advantage than in more temperate climes, for these shrubs keep up a
display the year through. Where in Great Britain and on the Continent
there are conservatories, there are less costly but quite as attractive
structures in Queensland called “ bush” or shade houses. These are made
in various styles, and generally of very inexpensive materials. They are
very frequently used as ferneries, and with taste and skill in arrangement
it is quite surprising what an attraction they can become.
“ Balsams: cockscombs, zinnias, portulacas, petunias, verbenas,
geraniums, antirrhinums, phlox drummondi, and a few others do very
well in the tropics, and so also do many hot-house bulbs and herbaceous
plants. Begonias, colei, and a host of other ornamental foliage plants
are well adapted to grace the borders and parterres ; and for shubberies,
an immense variety of ornamental shrubs and trees are suitable. The
gaudy crotons from New Guinea occupy much the same place in Northern
gardens and shrubberies that the laurel and holly do at home. In the
tropics, in the spring time, instead of the laburnum and the horse-chestnut,
there is the gorgeous Poinciana regia with its brilliant display of scarlet
bloom, and the Jacaranda mimosffifolia with its garment of cerulean hue,
also the lagerstroemi®, in their many varieties of growth and,colour; and
the shrubs and large trees bloom profusely most of the summer through.
Among smaller shrubs there are poincianas, poinsettias, hibiscuses,


allamandas, hoyas, gardenias, francisceas, many varieties of palms,
conifers, and taxads ; also a great variety of grotesque and huge cacti.
British stove plants are more at home in the open borders in North
Queensland than in the best kept stove-heated winter garden in Europe.
One of the great attractions of the North at the present time is the variety
of indigenous orchids there and in that climate their cultivation is of the
simplest and easiest character imaginable. Orchid-houses, such as the
hush-house already described, will ere long be a marked feature m all good
collections in the North; and pretty nearly all the famous varieties grown
could easily be accommodated there with all that is needful to make them
vigorous and flonferous. The same remarks apply equally to ferns , and
many choice varieties of this beautiful family of interesting and attractive
plants may be easily grown there by the veriest “ tyro” in horticulture.”
FORESTRY, AND TIMBER EXPORT.
In concluding a review of the Resources of Queensland which belong
to the Vegetable Kingdom, reference must not be omitted to the wealth oi
timber she possesses. There are upwards of 800 varieties at presenl
known to our naturalists, and the number is continually being added to,
Exhibits have been made at various times, and have attracted a
considerable amount of attention ; notably at the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition, of London, and the Centennial International Exhibition, in
Melbourne. The enormous extent of forest country yet available foi
commercial purposes is beyond the grasp of the mind of man, and it if
satisfactory to note that—young as our Colony is the Government havt
shown in many practical ways their intention of adding to these resources
State nurseries for the cultivation of forest trees are situated in various
parts of the colony, and a day is annually set apart (Arbor Day) which al
State Schools observe as a holiday, the occasion being celebrated by th<
public planting of ornamental trees in the school grounds.
Many beautiful shade and timber trees have been imported from tht
Old World, and acclimatised to the Colony, but the variety of nativi
timbers is such that they only require to be better known m order t<
create a large export trade. Already our timber merchants and other
have received enquiries from Natal and the Cape re railway sleepers, etc.
and from Philadelphia as to wood-blocking. Our nearest neighbour-
New South Wales—has made a definite start in the trade, as will be see)
from the following press notice of a visit to England by a gentlemai
engaged in this industry :—“He took with him specimens of grey iron
bark, spotted and grey gum, tallowwood, blackbutt, mahogany, and cedar
The value of these for various purposes was brought under the notice o
leading engineers in England, with the result that orders were given fo
supplying certain of these timbers. The principal demand comes from th
railway companies for sleepers. Timber for wood-paving the streets i


also required, and since his return very large orders have been received to-
supply timber. A vessel has been engaged to load timber on the
Clarence direct for England, and she will sail in March. This is but the
first of many shipments. The price obtained in England is satisfactory,
and far in advance of what is paid locally. The opening up of this trade
is regarded as of much importance to the district and colony, and
already there is increased activity in the timber business on the Clarence.”'
“One of our Resources” —Timber-getters at Work.
All the timbers mentioned above are obtainable in Queensland in
large quantities , so that we may fairly expect to get a share of “ the good
things going.”
I note also that a trial of New South Wales hardwood is being made


in the erection of a large goods shed at Manchester for the Great Northern
Railway Company. To those unacquainted with the mechanical value of
our timbers, the following particulars respecting a few of those which are
common to the latter Colony and ourselves may be of interest. The
figures are derived from a work by the U.S. Consul in Sydney, published
under the authority of the Government of New South Wales, and may,
therefore, be taken as fairly accurate.
The “ proof transverse strength” was the weight (lbs. avoidupois),
which a lin. x lin. bar of perfectly dry timber could sustain between two
supporting points, one foot apart, without having its fibre or elasticity
impaired. The “ modulus of rupture” was eighteen times the load required
to break the bar.

Besides the above, there are many more deserving special notice,
amongst which may be mentioned the Spotted Gum ( Eucalyptus
maculata) , of which the timber is utilised in a large number of ways—
for ship, carriage, and bridge building; wheelwright’s requirements, and
street paving cubes. “ Bloodwood ” ( Eucalyptus Corymbosa) is believed
to be suitable for the latter purpose.
Another of the Eucalypti, of which we have so great a variety, is the
Turpentine tree, sometimes known as Peppermint ( Eucalyptus mierocorys );
by the natives it is known as “ Tee.” The timber is largely used by ship
and house builders, and by wheelwrights; it is strong, handsome, and
durable.
Stave wood ( Tarrieta argyrodendron) is plentiful in the Queens-
land scrubs, and in New South Wales. The name by which our
neighbours know the tree is “Black Stave” or “ Ironwood,” and the
timber is used by them for posts, sleepers, tiles, and bridges. It is said to
be tough in texture, and capable of great resistance to the action of water;
may be used for same purposes as the English Beech.
£500,000 worth of machinery, &c., was engaged in wood-working
at the date of the 1895 returns. Out of a total of over 150 establishments


(employing some 1400 hands), rather more than 100 are engaged solely
in sawmilling, of which the total capital value is set down, roughly speaking,
at £350,000. The average price obtained in 1895 by the mills for 100 ft.
super, was 12s. 5d., hardwood ; 18s. 4d., cedar ; 10s. 2d. pine.
“Giants of the Forest"-Moreton Bay Pine.
The “ Townsville Birlletin” mentions one log containing 2984 ft. of
cedar, and from which a “ flitch ” measuring 1000 ft. had been sawn.
Our contemporary speaks of a tree from which eight or nine logs, each
from 12ft. to 14ft. long, had been cut. The butt measured 7ft. 6in., and
the diameter of the smallest end was about 4ft.

Our Mineral Wealth.
This has been written about so often and so ably that it would seem
almost a superfluous, and certainly a difficult task, to revert to the sub-
ject. If, however (as was recently reported in the columns of our press),
a distinguished visitor from Great Britain, well informed in most com-
mercial matters, was so little acquainted with our magnificent and in-
exhaustible mineral resources, as to enquire whether we “ had any coal or
gold mines in Queensland,” it would appear that we have all the justifi-
cation and needed encouragement to again present the claims to universal
recognition of a few of our most prominent mining fields.
Mineral production accounts for a big share of the annual wealth of
Australasia —rather more than one-eighth—according to Coghlan—and
Queensland takes no mean place amongst her neighbours in this respect.
Of the £13,500,000 odd, attributed in 1895 to minerals, our Colony pro-
duced £2,495,976 —close on a fifth. Since the dawn of gold mining in
Queensland —but thirty years or so ago—over £39,000,000 has been
wrested from the soil of this Colony, in the form of gold ! ! Another
£10,000,000 may be said to represent the value of minerals raised in
Queensland, other than gold, since 1860.
To sum up, in the comprehensive words of a writer in the Brisbane
Courier :—“ Queensland, her extreme youth notwithstanding, has indeed
sprung into the proud position of the second largest gold-producer in
Australasia; her gold yields top the list of averages ; her gold winnings,
per miner employed, are considerably over double those of Victoria, and
more than three times greater than those of either New South Wales or
New Zealand, while she is fourth among the colonies in the aggregate
mineral production. With these facts staring us in the face, one is led to
speculate where Queensland would be if we had a mining population
equal to that of either Victoria or New South Wales.”
Men are what we need. On all hands, it is admitted, that few of
our mining “ shows ” (to use a popular term) have been developed to
their full extent, and that the majority are little more than “ surface
scratchings.” In the large majority of instances, the choice of fields has
been so great and the reasonable expectations of successful prospecting so
tempting, that our present mining population and invested capital—
whilst producing magnificent results—are inadequate to gathering the
harvest of former sowings. As has been suggested, had we a population
like our next-door neighbours, New South Wales and Victoria—*


either of which is two and a half times as populous as we are
we should probably hold the mineral record of Australasia, and
of the World. In confirmation of this remark, it may be noted
that the population and age of the colonies which surpass us in
point of aggregate mineral productiveness, are, in each case, greater
than our own, and—strange to say —whilst the gold production of the
two most important is shown by the following table to have been fluctuat-
ing heavily and on the decrease, that of Queensland has increased
uniformly with the increase of population, a fact which speaks volumes
for the exceptional inducements offered by our goldfields to the mining
world.

GOLD.
Gold mining is at present our most promising—as it has always been
our most important—single industry, as it finds employment and support
for no less than 56,000 persons. 9,473 miners’ rights were issued in
1895, and steam power of 8,677 h.p., with machinery for mining,
crushing, reducing and dressing ore, etc. of an approximate value of
£1,142,107 were employed in the industry. The annual fee for a mining
license is 10s. The number of Companies engaged in mining has
increased from 179 in 1884, to 220 in 1895; subscribed capital
£5,012,861.
It is impossible to obtain the aggregate amount of dividends which
the mines of Queensland have paid to investors, but according to the
sworn returns made under the Dividend Duty Act, £4,826,213 15s. 6d.
has been distributed from September, 1890 (commencement of Dividend
Duty Act) to 31st January, 1897.
The value of gold raised per mine (including assistants, such as
carters) was £143 per head in 1895, and this has previously been even
higher. Upwards of 2,000 distinct quartz reefs have been proved to be
auriferous, 1,943 of these are detailed in the Official Statistics for 1895,
and incomplete as the figures are acknowledged to be, nearly 13,000 square
miles of auriferous country have been worked in the reef and in the
alluvial. In the early days the latter predominated, but at present quartz
and “reef” gold constitute 97% of the whole output. The average return
of gold per ton of quartz was 1 oz. 4 dwt. 5 grs. in 1894 and 1.1.6. in
1895; the value may be roughly set down at £3 10s. per oz. The average
return per miner engaged in reefing was over £3OO per annum in 1894


and 1895. The March quarter of the present year shows the phenomenal
increase of.nearly 20,000 ozs. over the corresponding period in 1896.
CHARTERS TOWERS heads the list of goldfields. During the
last quarter of 1896 alone, this field contributed 57,030 ozs. from
crushings and 12,046 ozs. from the re-treatment of “ tailings.” The
total for 1896 was 234,139 ozs., worth about £772,760. Before 1872 the
present field was a bleak, nearly barren, desolate run for a few head of
cattle, with grass too poor and seedy for sheep. The Hon. Hugh Mosman
and some friends found reefs and took lumps of gold from the outcrops.
It is less than a quarter of a century ago since these gentlemen reported
the find, and yet at the end of 1895 it was officially recorded that
3,350,139 oz. of gold had been won, and the total value of gold raised up
to 31st December, 1896, was about £12,000,000. With figures of such
magnitude, little wonder that the “ Towers” field holds the premier position
among all Australasian goldfields, and what is more to the purpose is in a
position to retain that proud place by the aid of her deep ground below
the 2000 ft. levels. This phenomenal field occupies the edge of an
area of granite and syenite rocks, which simultaneously with their
upheaval, displaced many lines of auriferous quartz reefs, the whole
disturbance causing convulsions and faults in the previous overlying
strata upon a gigantic scale. Under such circumstances, therefore, it was
first maintained in theory, and later by practical work, that to as great a
epth as the quartz miner can ever hope to penetrate he will find a
ontinuance of these reefs. Indeed, within the past few months a shaft
“ bottomed” on the reef, being sunk for a few feet from the original
estimated depth of 2200 ft. vertical. Charters Towers miners, having a
veritable net work of reefs to work upon, and the knowledge where to find
them at deep levels, may be said to have brought mining within the cate-
gory of commercial or industrial enterprise. £13,000 is said to be paid
weekly in miners’ wages on the above field.
Next in order are the ROCKHAMPTON AND CROCODILE
CREEK FIELDS —of which Mount Morgan may be said to be the
representative, as only about 6,000 ozs. of gold were contributed by all
the minor fields together in 1896. From the Brisbane Courier of 21st
January, 1897, we learn that the Mount Morgan Company last year
treated 81,379 tons of ordinary ore for a return of 79,2990 z. of gold;
15,793 tons of mundic ore for 66,9190 z. ; 678 tons of slimes for 13250 z.,
and 6415 tons of low-grade ore for 35920 z., making a total of 104,265
tons of ore for 151,3170 z. of gold. The ordinary ore averaged 19dwt.,
the mundic 4oz. 4dwt., the slimes loz. 19dwt., and the low grade lldwt.,
giving an average per ton of stone treated of loz. Bdwt. As compared
with 1895, the stone treated shows an increase of 16,135 tons, and the gold
obtained shows an increase of 22,4370 z., while the average yield (notwith-


standing the quantity of low-grade ore treated) was only 6gr. lower than
that of 1895. The unparalleled richness of this Company’s property has
dazzled the world. Princely dividends have been paid out to the lucky
original shareholders, some of whom at least are now living in affluence
abroad. It has paid between September, 1886, and June, 1896,
£4,100,000 in dividends, or £4 2s. per share. Work at other places out-
side Mount Morgan has demonstrated, as it has outside Gympie, Croydon,
and the “ Towers,” that the gold does not end with the area within which
the principal operations are being carried on in the respective localities.
Right in the midst of agricultural and pastoral centres are to be found
mines which to a greater or lesser degree are adding either
to the gold, the silver, the coal, or the copper output of the colony.
Mount Morgan has not inaptly been called the “ Mountain of Gold.” In
its early days the mine yielded £IOO,OOO to £125,000 per month in
dividends on it’s 1,000,000 shares at £1 each. Immense sums of money
have been lost as well as made by speculators in these shares, who often
purchased scrip at a high price with a view to selling. The Company has.
for some time past been paying £25,000 per month (6d. per share), and has
been able at the same time to do some heavy prospecting, to lay down the
most expensive machinery, erect an inexhaustible reservoir of water, &c.,
&c. The number of employees varies from 1000 to 1100, and the wages
are good. The works are lighted throughout by electricity, so that —to
those at least, who prior to 1885 knew this little group of hills in all their
pristine peacefulness—-the “ fairy land” simile so often applied to this far-
famed mine would seem to be justified by its present busy aspect. It may
be mentioned, incidentally, that the 640 acre selection, of which the
ground now being mined formed a portion, was sold (subsequent to the
finding of gold “ colours”) for £1 per acre !!
In the neighbourhood, are the “ Struck Oil” claims (only a few years
old, and scarcely proved as yet), Crocodile Gold Field (at the head of
Gavial Creek), Ridgelands, Rosewood, Morinish, Blackfellow’s Gully, New
Zealand Gully, Cawarral, and Mt. Wheeler. From the latter a nugget of
250 or 260 ounces weight was secured, and a writer thus describes the find-
ing of it: —“ In a claim which one of the miners had pegged off near the
top of one of the spurs of Mount Wheeler early, one Sunday morning his
little boy took up his father’s pick to try if he could use it, and, standing
just within the boundaries of the claim, drove the pick into the black vol-
canic soil among the grass roots, and felt it stick, so that he could not lift
it. They found the point of the pick sticking into a weighty nugget of the
value of about £IOOO. It was an oblong piece of pure gold. On the upper
side it was dark, where the black volcanic soil had covered it, but on the
other side it was of a bright yellow; it appeared like a splash of molten
metal suddenly cooled when brought into contact with a cold surface.”
From 1883 to 1896 inclusive, the total output of these fields, including


Mount Morgan, is stated at 1,656,955 ounces of gold, and their per-
manence is strikingly shown by a comparison of the first seven years with
the second seven years of the period, which yielded respectively 618,622
ounces, and 1,087,214 ounces—a very noticeable increase for the last few
years.
CROYDON is a relatively young, and by no means the least pro-
mising goldfield of the Colony. Only 11 years have passed since it was
proclaimed, and at date of writing (March, 1897), the official returns for
February show a marked advance on those for January, and indeed, on
the average monthly yield—as calculated from the 1895 returns.
The ratio of calls to dividends was also most satisfactory during 1896.
The former only amounted to £14,000, whilst the dividends paid reached
the substantial total of £63,000. The average value of the gold was £2
9s. 6d. The average value per ton of quartz crushed was £4 14s. Od.,
not much under 2 ozs, of gold to the ton. Although the output for 1896
(85,955 ozs.) was somewhat impeded by want of water, this is considerably
in advance of previous years, and it will be seen that although it ig
impossible to foretell future returns, the very highest hopes may be
entertained of the prospects of this field.
In common with many of our goldfields, this one covers an enormous
area of gold-bearing country, which needs capital and men to develop it.
So numerous are the reefs, that good payable claims have often been
abandoned directly the stone became poor, instead of which a little
persistence would, in the majority of cases, have been handsomeyl
rewarded. In other cases the want of capital to provide pumping
machinery has stopped the work of prospecting before a return was
obtained. Over 300 claims have had crushings in the short time the field
has been worked, and at the present time nearly half that number are
gold producing. Indeed, so important is this field considered that it has
been made the subject of an exhaustive report by Mr. Wm. H. Rands,
of the Geological Survey of Queensland, and to this interesting work readers
are referred for further information. One thing is certain : except for it’s
out of the way position, Croydon would long since have received attention
at the hands of capitalists, the underground wealth would have been
unearthed in vast quantities, and the field would now, perhaps, rank as
the “premier” in the Colony. The old transport difficulties are now
largely done away with; deep sinking has proved to be an unqualified
success on similar auriferous country, and capital and pluck will reap a
rich harvest when brought to bear on the unquestionably extensive deposits
of the precious metal occurring here. The conservation of water on a
large scale is one of the most urgent needs of the field, and were capital
turned in this direction alone, a very great increase in the year’s returns
would be immediately apparent. The estimated population at the close of
1895 was about 2000 men and 1500 women and children.


GYMPIE next claims our attention. The year just closed (1896)
shows a return of over 73,700 ounces of gold from about 63,000 tons of
stone ; the value of the gold was over £258,000. At present the field is
almost entirely worked by companies and syndicates of Queensland
residents —a large proportion being engaged in actual mining on the pro-
perty they are financially interested in, or an adjoining claim. These com-
panies distributed £113,832 in dividends during the year, and the calls on
shares amounted to £86,440 —an exceedingly moderate sum when it is
considered that a tremendous amount of deep ground prospecting has been
done of late.
In common with all Australian fields, the gold was first found in
alluvial drift, and the ease with which it was obtained gave many a poor
man a “ lift.” Mr. J. Nash, the discoverer of Gympie (about 1866) put to-
gether—it is said—£Booo in a couple of years, and many similar instances
occurred. Nuggets of all sizes were found, some weighing as much as 800
ounces.
For several years gold continued to be found in the alluvial in suffi-
cient quantities to support a large number of miners, but when at last the
supply ceased, the bulk of the men moved on to other fields, or spread out
on all sides in the hopes of making new discoveries.
Attempts were, of course, made to find the reefs from which the
alluvial gold was judged to have originally come, with such success that
the present population is nearly as great as that in Gympie’s palmiest
alluvial days, and the prospects are far better than ever they were under
that class of gold-getting.
The history, present position, and prospects of some of the most
notable of the claims, as briefly sketched in the Brisbane Courier of 17th
February of this year, fully confirm this view :
The “ Lady Mary” was the first quartz reef found, being discovered in
November, 1867, by Messrs. Pollock and Lawrence. A few days after-
wards this find was followed by the exposing of the “ Caledonia.” Exceed-
ingly fine specimens were taken from these near the surface. The result
was further prospecting, with the consequent unearthing of others. How
rich these were may be imagined from the fact that 10 tons from “ Dodds’s
Caledonia” yielded 9980 z.; 3cwt. from “ No. 1 California” gave the magni-
ficent return of 3670 z. Dodd himself extracted llOOoz. from 10 tons, and
three crushings from the “ Caledonia” p.c., aggregating 3164 tons, yielded
75,9360 z., or 240 z. to the ton.
Gympie has, of course, had its periods of depression ; but there are
always some of the mines turning out good payable stuff. At present the
prospect is unusually promising. The exploration of the eastern ground
has, as has been stated, stimulated enterprise, while the discoveries in the
old workings seem to justify the prediction that the current year will see


another of those periodical changes for the better which have always
characterised Gympie. For instance, the “ Wilmot Extended” have recently
had a breaking-down which for richness would be difficult to beat. It is
the same break which about ten years ago turned out £70,000 in
dividends, although only 70ft. of stuff was taken out. At this particular
place there is a great stretch of country —about 800 ft. to the southern
boundary. It is right on the Russell reef, too, which gave such
sensational returns years ago, and which has since given from lOoz. to
12oz. to the ton. It is, in fact, in the centre of the golden belt, with the
“ Ellen Harkins” on one side, the “ Smithfield United” on another,
“ No. 1 North Phoenix” (which has paid princely dividends and never
made a call) on the north, and the “ Monkland” line on the south.”
The “ No. 1” has paid about £789,000 in dividends, or about £2l per
share ; last year’s payments aggregated £IO,OOO, or ss. per share.
As showing some recent results it may be mentioned that the “ South
New Zealand Junction” crushed 50 tons of stone for a yield of 787 ozs.
and “ No. 7 South Lady Mary” 117 tons for 873 ozs. These are practically
new discoveries in old ground , and as they are not the only good yields
from the older claims, there is little likelihood of the latter being abandoned
for a long time to come. The North Smithfield Co. obtained 13,837 ozs.
of gold, and paid £33,414 in dividends in 1896. “ No. 1 North Glanmire”
paid 3s. per ss. share that year, and has altogether paid over £l2 per
share. The “Phoenix Golden Pile” paid away £20,000, and the “Columbia
Smithfield” £19,800 in dividends during 1896. Adjoining the former of
these two claims is the “ Phoenix,” which distributed £6666 amongst its
shareholders last year. To the crushing machinery on Gympie, a cyanide
plant has just been added, having a capacity of treating 400 tons of
tailings per month. This development has been suggested by noticeable
losses from the ordinary treatment of the stuff raised by the Gympie
Gold Mines (previously known as the Eastern Monkland.) The character
of the gold here is extremely fine and pure, and it is remarkable for the
absence of the usual slate formation by which the Gympie gold is accom-
panied. The present depth of this claim is over 1450 feet, a depth which
has been exceeded by four other mines on the field. Elsewhere the gold
is very free and extraordinarily course. In every case it can be found in
conjunction with black shaly slate. Reefs several feet in width can be
traced in the workings for hundreds of yards, yet their value is infinitesmal
without the presence of the slate. Often the slate is no thicker than a
sheet of brown paper, yet coincident with it are rich gold veins.
In less than seven years the dividends paid by Gympie companies are
recorded as £797,053, whilst the total yield of gold from 1867 to 1896
has been 2,110,109 ozs. of the value of £7,385,400 odd.
As has already been incidentally mentioned, many—if not most—of


the miners on Gympie are also shareholders in some concern or other;
frequently they are found sitting as directors of the board in control of their
“ boss” —the manager. It is significant, too, that notwithstanding this
intermixing of interests, trouble rarely occurs, as the men have a very fine
perception of where their duty as wage-earners begins and ends. As was
remarked by a writer during the period of depression : —“ The spirit which
animates so many on Gympie is the true bond of fraternity, and to this
may be ascribed the freedom from labour disputes which the field has
enjoyed for so many years. The greatest harmony has always prevailed
between employer and employee, for the simple reason that it is hard to
tell where one leaves off and the other begins. Even to those unacquainted
with the field it will readily be observed how the interests of one are bound
up with those of the other, and how promptly this fact is realised on both
sides.”
It may be remarked, incidentally, that the returns for the quarter
ending March 81st, 1897, show an eminently satisfactory result for that
period, there being an increase as compared with January-Mareh, 1896, of
2608. ozs of gold from a smaller quantity of stone by 2180 tons. Dividends
have likewise increased by £1936, whilst calls have decreased £3692.
The ETHERIDGE and WOOLGAR may be said to have splendid
resources, which a combination of difficulties have greatly retarded in
developement. About 1000 men and 700 women and children are at
present on these fields, which according to the estimate of the warden at
the close of 1895 carry sufficient gold to support a similar number under
the present state of things for the next fifty years. An average of over
20,000 ozs. of gold has been turned out annually for the past 16 years,
and (as in the last-mentioned field) capital only needs to be applied in
guarding against droughts, and otherwise putting operations on a more
satisfactory footing. The Etheridge field is described as an area of enormous
extent, saturated with gold from the surface downwards. The principal
centres are situated on high ground, and being exceptionally healthy
should offer inducements to try this field. Prospecting has been very
imperfectly done, and good finds are frequently reported as being made on
new ground. Recent reports speak most encouragingly of the renewed
vigour exhibited on this field ; in fact, many “ shows” which have been
idle for 12 or more years—notably about Georgetown and Charleston—
are again being worked most remuneratively. These two mining centres
were supporting some 500 and 200 persons respectively at the date of last
reports; the latter township is about 26 miles from Georgetown. The
difficulties referred to at the outset are, it is pleasing to state, being
steadily overcome, and the outlook generally is very good. Alluvial
workings at Green Hills have largely assisted in the renewed prominence
of the field, 300 or 400 miners getting a good living at this place. There


are similar indications of a revival on the Woolgar goldfield. The output
for both fields in 1896 was 26,865 ozs., and the estimated value of
machinery some £60,000.
The RAVENSWOOD goldfield possesses an enormous advantage over
the Etheridge, inasmuch as it is connected by railway with the port of
Townsville, from which it is only 78 miles distant. In common with
many of our richest fields, it has had “ ups and downs,” but at the date
of last report of the Minister for Mines (1896) it was the means of sup-
porting about 2600 persons, of whom only 158 were Chinese. A small
quantity of alluvial gold is still found here—mostly worked by the
Chinese —but the mainstay of the field is, and will be, reef mining. The
total yield for 1896 was 14,965 ozs., and the value about £50,000. Divided
amongst the 400 or so quartz miners, this gives an average earning of
about £125 ; alluvial miners averaged (on the basis of the 1895 alluvial
yield) about £3B per head.
The report of the warden for 1895 states that “ more advanced mining
is being initiated every month, and the desire is to sink deeper shafts.
Capital is needed and must come from the outside. . . . Two or three
shafts sunk like the ‘ John Bull,’ and what is looked for in the ‘ Yellow
Jack,’ will soon cause all despondency to depart.”
The key note has been struck when it is said that capital is all that is
needed to make most, if not all, of our goldfields the Wonder of the World.
Gympie needed capital, and being near the populous centres got it, with
what splendid results everyone knows. And yet it cannot be said that
either Gympie or Charters Towers offered any more certain return for the
outlay than do this and many more fields in our colony. The difficulties
of treating the somewhat refractory Ravenswood ores led some time since
to the establishment of large chlorinating works, besides which a good
deal of new machinery has been put up during the year just closed.
CLERMONT is another good field and—contrary to the last-men-
tioned is almost exclusively an alluvial one, and as such may justly be
considered the leading “ poor man’s goldfield” of Queensland. At date of
last annual report the warden stated the population at 1409 persons—all
told ; but recently, however, several new finds at Blister Hill (One Mile)
and Dead Horse Gully (now the “Jubilee Rush” or Newtown) will materially
increase the above number. Just previous to publication there were 1000
men on the “ rush” alone. The first mentioned find is reported to have
given from 1 oz. to 7 ozs. 12 dwts. per load, and at White Hill 2 oz. and
3 ozs. a load have been obtained. The above gentleman sta ed a few days
ago that he had just returned from a thorough inspection of the new lead,
which was rapidly developing. The lead was fully a mile long, and fifty
claims were on payable gold. One claim washed 18 oz. for two loads,
got at 70ft. The wash is fully a foot wide, and the average washing


is from 1 oz. to 3 oz. The warden believes the lead is going to be per-
manent, with every prospect of improvement in the deep ground. Many
old, experienced miners in the Clermont district, men who are able to
judge, state that it is the richest—and what promises to be the most per-
manent—rush that has yet taken place on the Peak Downs.
The lead has now been traced into deep ground for one mile and a
half, leading at present north-east, and probably it will eventually be
traced to the shaft of the Quarry Hill Company. It is superior to anything
else found in the district, inasmuch as in most instances the washdirt is
what is termed “drive high,” and also exceptionally rich. The opening
of this lead so near town (one mile and a half) is of vast importance to
Clermont and district, and several business men are opening branches, to
provide for which, on the 15th March, a line was marked off fora street of
eight or ten business areas, which have all been taken up. Already
Clermont is showing signs of reaction, and business of all kinds is getting
quite brisk again.
Clermont enjoys similar facilities to those at Ravenswood, being but
62 miles from the main Central railway, and 227 miles from the port of
Rockhampton. There are some six or seven centres here—McDonald’s
Flat having in time past been the pick of these. It formerly supported a
large population, and now that the water difficulty has been in a great
measure overcome, will do so again. This camp has the advantage of an
excellently managed provisional school, averaging about 40 children.
Black Ridge and the Springs are some 15 miles out of Clermont, whilst
Copperfield is only four miles, but they had the larger population at the
date of last report. The gold here is alluvial. The Rockhampton Bulletin.
recently stated that the reefs in the neighbourhood are also looking well.
At Copperfield there are two cyanide companies at work doing well on the
old tailings. Messrs. Caldwell and Huston have taken up the old “ Star of
Hope reef, and are sinking on a large body of brown stone, being doAvn
about 40ft. The stone prospected for over an ounce per ton, which can
be readily believed, when it is stated that the returns from the tailings
average 7 dwt. per ton, this average having been maintained for seven
months. Many of the old reefs in the neighbourhood are being taken up
again, and two crushing plants are in course of erection. On the Star of
Hope line a very small amount of work has been done below the mundic
level, but if practically all the gold can be extracted by the use of cyanide,
there is no reason why the refractory mundic stone should not pay well.
Altogether, mining affairs on Peak Downs have a very encouraging
appearance, and after the recent rains, fossickers and gully-rakers should
be able to get a good bit of gold in the old workings. At the same time
it is the opinion of the warden and of the “ old hands” that the alluvial
workings are as yet in their infancy, and that they will provide a fair


living for many a long day to come. The 1896 yield of gold from this
field was 12,683 ozs.
Considering that the EIDSYOLD has been a proclaimed field for less
than 10 years, the aggregate result of 86,146 ozs., valued at £812,000, for
some 88,000 tons of quartz crushed during that period, may be considered
fairly satisfactory, although individual crushings have given as high as
ozs. to the ton. Several companies whose scrip is regularly quoted
on “ Change,” are engaged in further developing the splendid resources
of the above field, as well as at St. John’s Creek miles from Eidsvold
township, &s the crow flies), and Dykehead (27 miles from the township.)
These various centres support a population of 1300 to 1500 Europeans,
besides a few Chinese, and when development of the reefs has taken place
there will be room for many more. There is latterly a decidedly upward
tendency in the output of this field, the February returns being just double
those of January, 1897. New “ shows” are also being opened up, so that
the prospects may be considered to be bright. Two of the most prominent
of the claims were last year consolidated under the title of the “ Mount
Rose and Stockman Junction,” and have since then paid a first dividend
of £750, equal to 3d. per share on 60,000 shares. Another company,
now defunct, paid away the respectable sum of £12,750 in dividends
during its years of gold-producing, and the original Mount Rose and
S.J. Gold Mining Co. paid £34,000 in “ divi’s” during the seven years
odd, ending December, 1896, say 11s. 4d. per share, totalling £4500 per
annum. From a report of a recent visitor to this field, which appeared in
the Brisbane Courier, it seems that there are three batteries on Eidsvold,
one at Spring Gully, one and a-half miles west of the township, and twenty
head of stamps, now owned by the Heights of Alma Company. The
second one is the property of the Mount Rose and Stockman Junction
Company, containing fifteen head of stamps, one Huntingdon mill, seven
frue-vanners, and every appliance for saving gold. The third is the pro-
perty of the Hon. A. H. Wilson, of Maryborough ; it is situated three miles
from town, on the bank of the Burnett, and contains fifteen stamps and
two frue vanners. In the event of water supplies running short at the
two former mills, recourse is had to this battery, where there is always
water available, Besides these, a 30-stamper battery is situated on the
“Perseverance” line of reef at St. John’s Creek.
It may also be mentioned that there is every prospect of the early
Construction of a railway to this field, via Mount Perry, from which it
would be distant about 50 miles along the proposed route. At date of
writing the railway surveyor had just sent in his-report on two or three
alternative routes from various points on the Mount Perry branch line
from Bundaberg (at present 67 miles in length.)
The 1896 yields of other goldfields (at present giving small returns)


were :—Gladstone, 6040 ozs.; Coen, 4853 ozs. ; Russell, 790 ozs, ;
Mackay, 463 ozs.; Russell Extended, 642 ozs.; Mareeba, 991 ozs.: Tate,
50 ozs. ; Cloncurry, 1466 ozs.; Balcooma, 111 ozs.; Palmer, 4381 ozs. ;
Hodgkinson, 2991 ozs.; Paradise, 985 ozs.; Normanby and Bowen,
406 ozs. ; Pikedale, Talgai, Mount Shamrock, Tenningering and other
small fields, 2667 ozs ; Horn Island, 1292 ozs.; Cooktown, 403 ozs. ;
and Mulgrave, 146 ozs.
Indeed, the localities where indications, and even colour of gold occur
are so numerous, and the superabundance of under-manned fields is such,
that it is not the purpose of this sketch to deal with them. Anyone
desirous of obtaining the latest official information concerning same, or
fuller details concerning those briefly described above, are referred to the
annual report of the Under-Secretary for Mines, and the many interesting
geological bulletins issued by the Government Geologist, R. L. Jack, Esq.
Of the latter, No. 4 (on the Hodgkinson) and No. 5 (on the Palmer) may
be specially cited as obtainable on application at the office of the Geological
Survey, George-street, Brisbane.
I cannot conclude without special mention of the WARWICK gold-
fields, which are remarkable on account of age (about 33 years), proximity
to the metropolis, and particularly from their position. To take the last
point. It will be seen from the map that nearly all the goldfields of
Queensland are situated to the East of the Dividing Range, whilst this one
is situated on the other side, being on the western watershed at the head
of the Condamine river. Some six or seven centres have been established,
and in past years big nuggets have been found in all of them. At the pre-
sent time both alluvial and reef work are carried on, the former with fair
success (if one may judge from appearances), the latter —owing to the
primitive methods employed—probably being less remunerative. In 1895
some 200 or 300 men turned out 1000 ozs. or more of gold from all
sources, the crushings of quartz yielding about 16 dwts. of gold to the
ton. The district over which the gold is spread is an enormous one, and
there can be no doubt that the most favourable openings exist here for the
judicious expenditure of capital in opening up the reefs which have been
already laid bare, or in underground prospecting.
An interesting review which recently appeared in the Brisbane
“ Courier” states that at present the deeper shafts are only 240 and 150
feet respectively, and the fact that the best returns have been obtained
from the deeper of the two, and that the black slate and plumbago
faces (the usual accompaniments of payable reefs) have been generally
found to be the bottom strata come upon so far, should afford great
encouragement to the would-be investor. Even under present conditions,
nearly 4 ozs. to the ton were obtained from a recent crushing at Talgai; a
claim on Thanes Creek area has yielded ozs. for 238 tons of stone,
and another has given 36£ ozs. of gold from 45 tons of stone. Caual


Creek and Lucky Valley are mostly occupied by fossickers and alluvial
miners, whilst reefing is also carried on at the Palgrave field. Little
is being done at Leyburn. Another point very greatly in favour of these
goldfields is their proximity to the metropolis, and as they are all within
driving distance of the important town which gives them their name the
drawbacks, experienced by many fields, of high cost of living and
expensive freights are unknown here. Quite recent developments give a
very hopeful outlook to the field.
MINERALS OTHER THAN GOLD.
Although gold is the foremost, it is by no means the only mineral of
which we have untold wealth. Besides traces—as yet not followed up—-
of nearly all the minerals known to commerce, sufficient quantities of
some of these have been unearthed to justify the proclamation of nearly
forty districts, each under the jurisdiction of a Mineral Lands Com-
missioner, whose duties are to safeguard the interests both of the miners
and of the Crown.
From the latest available statistics, I learn that the total value of tin
exported between 1872 and 1897 is approximately £4,375,000, thus taking
rank next to gold in this respect. The principal tin producing districts,
in order of importance are Herberton (mainly lode tin), Cooktown,
Stanthorpe, Port Douglas, Kangaroo Hills and Ravenswood. The total
value of the tin raised in 1896 was £49,018. (1,554 tons) —a fall of
£19,000 on 1895. In the early days of this industry our production was
as high as 9,000 tons, of a value of £606,000 in a single year, and the
present small output is in no way due to the exhaustion of supplies (which
are practically illimitable) but solely to the heavy fall in value, the world
over—the present price being less than half that realised twenty years
ago.
Next in point of total value is Coal, although as regards present
output it holds pride of place. The deposits cf this mineral, with the
exception perhaps of iron-stone, are the most extensive in the Colony, and
may fairly be said to be inexhaustible. At present a very small portion of
these are worked, still a sufficient and increasing quantity is being raised
for our own requirements ; this was 371,390 tons during 1896 —value,
£154,987, and the export of the mineral is likely to be an important
feature in our commerce. The most important centre of the industry is
Ipswich, 328,169 tons of a value of £129,148 having been raised in 1896
Next in order is the Wide Bay district (the Burrum fields, near Mary-
borough) from which £15,412 worth was taken, and then comes Clermont
with £10,882 worth. There are a few workings at Warra and Clifton in
the Darling Downs district, and others between Ipswich and Toowoomba,
but the output is too small to deserve detailed notice. Coal has also been
raised at Moggil and Flagstone Creek (near Helidon) and is known to


exist on the Bowen River (near Mackay) and at Cooktown. The heating
qualities of the Queensland coal on this market are very good, and much
which is not suited for domestic purposes produces excellent gas and
coke.
Opal Mining has come to the front of late years, indeed this item has
only figured in the mineral returns since 1890, although isolated finds
were known previously. These highly prized gems have been met with in
many localities, mostly in the Western districts, and the area of opalifer-
ous country is estimated by an expert as being a belt of some 200 miles in
width, where tens of thousands of pounds worth only await systematic
search. The principal fields at present are those in the Fermoy Com-
missioner’s district (latterly known as Opalton) from which stones
roughly worth £85,000 were obtained in the two years 1895-6 ; the
population is between 200 and 300, and has been greater. The second
district in point of importance is that of Thargomindah, which con-
tributed opal to the value (on a rough estimate) of £20,000 in the same
time. The two centres—Duck 'Treek and Gowal —support something
over 200 miners. Another field is situated in the Jundah Commissioner’s
district, but at date of last report (1896) had only produced £BOO worth
during the year, and the population was very small. Speaking of the
first mentioned district, the Opalton correspondent of the Longreach
“Standard” says:—“Dick Shillington and his mate got a few good stones
in deep ground about two miles from town, and a few men are prospect-
ing in the locality. The late finds by Cruise-and party and Clapham and
party have caused a bit of a stir on. Poverty Flat* and in one or
two instances fair prospects have been obtained. Two prospecting
parties have left for the Main, and I hear some good prospects have
lately been obtained. At the Bald Nob some new ground is being tried
by several parties, and in one claim large pipes of inferior opal with
occasional fair stones are being obtained.”
Silver is found in abundance in the Stanthorpe district, indeed the
bulk of the production comes from this locality, which bids fair to become
as important a silver district as in former years it was a tin producing
centre. Queensland did not become a steady producer of silver till 1879,
and in the short space of 18 years she has raised silver to the value of
£661,715. The last of these years (1896) is attributed with an output of
£32,162 worth, towards which Stanthoi'pe contributed £15,302; the
Herberton district, £4,518 ; Ravenswood district, £10,260; and various
fields, £2,082. The first mentioned field consists of two or three claims,
one of which, the' “ Silver Spur,” Texas, gives employment to over'so'men,
and shows no signs of giving out; the leasehold covers an area of 30
acres. At Pikedale, also hear Texas, a furnace with a capacity of 70 tons
a’week, is being erected—a' course which has been prompted by the


excellent smeltings of some ore lately come upon, and in the few months
which have elapsed since the commencement of active operations, a
prosperous communit) of 35 to 40 men has been formed. The Herberton
does not appear to be in so flourishing a condition as regards silver mining
—due, without a doubt, to the superior inducements offered by tin mining
in the immediate neighbourhood. With regard to the Ravenswood dis-
trict, silver mining is going on at Ukalunda. The most noticeable claim
is that of four men (all miners), who, between them, divide about £4,000
as the result of the year’s work—a good thing, certainly. At Ravenswood
proper, silver has been abandoned for the superior attraction of gold,
which is likely to be constantly happening as long as prices keep low.
Besides the above, silver is found on the Coen River, in the extreme
North, on the Gilbert River (back of Ingham), at Gin Gin (near Bunda-
berg), and in combination with gold, copper, and bismuth ores in many
localities. At Lawn Hill, in the Burke district, some previously worked
lodes are again being taken up for the purpose of being worked on
economical lines, and as the assays are fairly satisfactory, 40ozs. to 50ozs.
silver per ton, and 70 per cent, lead ( silver being 2s. 9d. per oz., and lead
£ll per ton), the party ought to have their modest desires satisfied. A
first shipment of some 30 tons of ore will be shipped in a few weeks
for a trial. Mr. Cant, it is understood, intends to accompany the
first shipment to Aldershot, where, if the returns are satisfactory, he will
endeavour to procure a couple of pots by which the ore can be roughly
reduced on the field, thus effecting a great economy in freight and
bagging. The party intend starting at once.
Copper holds an important position as regards total production,
although owing to the low state of the metal market (not to any lack of
ore), the output recently has heen affected similarly to that of silver, tin,
and lead. The subject of these few lines divides with coal the honour of
being our first mineral export, whilst in value it exceeds it by £150,000,
the total value of the copper output from 1860 to 1896, inclusive, being
£2,008,116. In 1896 the Herberton mines (Chillagoe district) furnished
£16,360 worth ; Port Douglas (Mt. Molloy Copper mine), furnished £450;
Stanthorpe, £1,312 ; and sundry localities, £2920 ; making a total of
£21,042 for the year, whereas in 1872, when the price was half as much
again as it is now, the value of the output was £196,000. Deposits of
Copper exist on nearly every degree of latitude south of the 17th, and in
very various longitudes. The gradually stronger tone of the copper
market is already producing an improvement, and we may soon hope to
see the noted Cloncurry, Mt. Perry, and Peak Downs copperfields support-
ing something like their former number of miners. The chief obstacle to
the development of the Cloncurry mines, in the manner to which their
richness entitles them, is the want of railway communication and conse-


quent high cost of living, and cartage of ore. The quality of the latter is,
however, considered equal to any which has been raised in the famed
mines of the United States, and—given a good price—these fields will
prove a powerful factor in the progress of the Colony. Mt. Perry, as has
been already stated, has railway communication with Bundaberg, and the
Peak Downs is connected by rail with the port of Rockhampton, so that
the recent rise in copper to £sl 12s. per ton (with a firm market) should
prove a blessing to a large number of miners. Recently, very satisfactory
news have come to hand from Emerald Creek, near Mareeba, a 3 ton
sample from a 4ft. wide copper lode has shown 22 % of pure copper, and
an abundance of flux is to be had within miles of the claim.
Prospecting is also being carried on with fair success at Lucky
Valley, and if the find proves satisfactory it is expected that work on a
large scale will be entered upon in the locality.
Other minerals, not as yet constituting any large portion of our pro-
duction, are : Lead, of which the total output in 1896 was valued at
£6IBO ; Bismuth — £3,258 (1895) ; Manganese— £9oo ; and Wolfram—
£6o (a fall of £482 on 1895). Between 1873 and 1894 Antimony was
raised to a gross value of £35,258, although there does not seem to have
been sufficient inducement to continue the industry since then. Similarly,
in 1892 and 1893 gems, worth in the aggregate £9OOO, were unearthed, but
either from want of a market or the uncertainty of the finds, gem hunting
has not been pursued with much zeal, although rubies, garnets, specimens
of the oriental emerald, topazes, sapphires, and even diamonds have been
found, it is said, as far back as the “ seventies,” and continue to be found
at intervals. Agates are found so plentifully in some parts, as in one
locality on the Etheridge to have furnished the name of a creek—known as
“ Agate Creek.” Besides Wolfram, (Tungstate of Iron and Manganese),
Chrome-iron, Haematite, Magnetic iron, Carbonate of iron, and Clay iron
ore are found abundantly scattered over the colony, but owing partly to
these not occurring in close proximity to the coal and limestone which are
required in the reduction of the ore, and partly—l understand—to the low
price of the imported iron, no attempt has yet been made to work the
deposits. Cinnabar, occurring at Kilkivan, is another mineral of which
we have a large quantity, seemingly not workable at present with profit.
Zircon has recently been found at Eungella head station, near Mackay,
and about 6000 acres have been prospected and are expected to yield one
ton per acre. Cobalt has been found in small quantity, but its production
has not yet become an established industry. Molybdenum and Plumbago
are met with, but have not been commercially utilised. Platinum,
Asbestos, and Kerosene may also be mentioned as possible mineral assets
in the future. Quarrying for Building Stone is carried on in various parts
of the colony. Felstone porphyry is mined in two or three localities about

Brisbane. Bluestone is obtained from the districts of Ipswich, Too-
woomba, Dalby, and Rockhampton ; Freestone or Sandstone from Gatton,
the Diamantina, Maryborough, and Normanton ; whilst Limestone is
raised in the Petty Sessions district of Paradise. Several deposits of
crystalline limestone of a white and of a black color occur on some small
islands off the Queensland coast, near the Tropic of Capricorn, and in
\arious parts of the mainland ; excellent white marble is obtained near
Warwick. Besides the above building stone, there are many others which
are highly ornamental, such as : Granite (very abundant), porphyry,
serpentine, diorite, syenite, elvan (granitic porphyry), and dolomite.
Slate is also found, but in common with the above, has not, so far. been
utilised for building purposes.
The following return, obtained by favour of the Department of Mines,
shows at a glance the localities from which minerals (other than gold)
were obtained during 1896 :

Australian colonies (and from the furthest corners of the earth, for that

space of time, this will be one of the most popular “ breathing spots ” of
the metropolis. A\ ithin its limits are the Goal reserve, the Diamantina
Orphanage, Brisbane Cemetery, the Pound and Dutton Park.
Musgrave Park is likewise a place of growing beauty, many beautiful
trees having been planted here, which will make it one of the favourites
of the city gardens. The above faces Russell Street, about half a mile
distant from the southern end of \ ictoria Bridge. Another reserve is
situated just off Stanley Street East, and goes by the name of Wool-
loongabba Park, taking its name from the district. A pleasant hour or
two may be spent here. By far the best known, however, are the
Botanical Gardens and Queen’s Park, situated in the heart of the city, on

buildings of their class, but the Houses of Parliament, which were erected
at a cost of £lOO,OOO, are especially so. Round and about Brisbane are to

Of places for religious worship there are a large number, chief among
which are the Anglican pro-Cathedral (St. John’s), St. Stephen’s (R. C.
Cathedral), St. Paul’s (Presbyterian), Albert-street Church (Wesleyan), the
Synagogue, the Lutheran Church on Wickham Terrace, the Tabernacle
(Baptist), Wharf-street Congregational Church, and the Headquarters of
the Salvation Army, known as “ The Temple.”
The wants of gymnasts are liberally catered for by the Brisbane
Gymnasium, German Gymnasium, and the Young Men’s Christian
Association Gymnasium—in the Hall of the Association, George-street.
At Nudgee, on the railway line to Sandgate, some 9 miles out of
town, are situated the Orphanage of St. Vincent (under the management
of the Sisters of Mercy), and the Christian Brothers’ College, for boys ;
whilst at Nundah, the “ Home of'the Good Shepherd,”—undertakes the
training of girls ; all of them well worth a visit, both on account of the
work carried on and their surroundings. The terminus of this line of
railway is at Sandgate, a delightful and favourite seaside resort.
Another place of interest is to be found down the Brisbane River, in
Lytton, where are situated the Reformatory for boys, and military fortifi-
cations commanding the mouth of the river. Outside the entrance are
the islands of Dunwich and St. Helena, devoted to the care of the aged
poor and the custody of criminals, respectively. These spots are noted for
the picturesqueness of their surroundings, and tickets to visit may be
obtained at the Treasury.
IPSWICH.
Fare from Brisbane, 2s. 7d.; distance, 24 miles. A short ride brings
one to Ipswich—at one time a determined rival of Brisbane for the seat of
Government. From the historian previously referred to, we learn that
the first sale of land here, took place in 1843, at which 6s. to 235. a perch
was realised, and in 1846 the population consisted of 64 males and 3f>
females, as compared with some 7000 or 8000 to-day. The town is situated
on both sides of the Bremer River, and is known as North Ipswich, and
Ipswich proper. Many valuable coal mines are in this neighbourhood, and
the surrounding districts of Limestone, Newtown, Blackstone, Bundamba,
Sandy Gallop, and Churchill, afford opportunity for many delightful ex-
cursions. Commercial enterprise has obtained a very firm hold on this
town. On the North side of the river are the mills of the Queensland
Woollen Manufacturing Company, Ltd., the Phoenix Engineering Co.,
and Messrs. Hancock Bros’ saw mills; here also are situated extensive
Government railway workshops. On the main side are scores of large
commercial concerns, amongst others, the mills of the Queensland Cotto n


Co., and the vast business of Messrs. C’ribb and Foote —general merchants
and storekeepers.
Referring to one of the more prominent coal mines on the Northern
side of the river, the Queensland Times (Ipswich) says : —“ The Waters-
town Coal Company, whose property is on the Bremer River, near Tivoli,
have recently been sinking a shaft for the purpose of opening up new
seams of coal. We learn that fortune has favoured them, for during the
present week they struck the old Tivoli seam at a depth of 570 feet. This
seam was in former years successfully worked by Mr. James Gulland. We
are assured that that portion of it which has now been struck is fully 5
feet in thickness, and the coal which it carries is of excellent quality.”
Many other large coal properties exist at Blackstone, Bundamba, &c.’
one at least of which is worked on purely co-operative principles, and
these have been found to give very satisfactory results. Although mining
absorbs a large proportion of the working population, it by no means holds
the monopoly in this district. Cotton growing offers good inducements,
owing to the presence of a mill ready to purchase at a fair price, and as
the sdil is adapted to this crop, cotton is likely to reach an even more im-
portant position as the staple production of Ipswich farms. Dairy farm-
ing is annually gaining favour, and creameries are springing up on all
sides. Those at Millbong, Flinders, Coochin, and Bellevue are actually
proprietory concerns, but a system of bonus payments has been adopted
by the owners, by which the suppliers on one occasion received an addi-
tional fd. per gallon for the month’s supply of milk (October last). In
the case of all these creameries, the cream is despatched to the metropolis,
where it is converted into butter at a central establishment. Dairymen in
the immediate vicinity of Ipswich have a ready market for milk or cream
at the recently-established butter factory in North Ipswich. As this has
been incorporated with the old-established Ice Works on that side of the
Bremer River, and the very best butter-making machinery erected, a first-
class product is turned out, and a good price is realised —a very important
matter to the milk supplier, as well as to the factory owner. At present
a shipment of this brand is on its way (with others) to the London
market.
A great impetus has been lately given to farming by the prominence
accorded to fruit and milk products, and a small portion of the excellent
land which is to be found in the jurisdiction of the Ipswich Land Agent’s
Office was recently thrown open and briskly competed for. To show the
esteem in which this land is held, it may be mentioned that cash amount-
ing to £4,487 10s. 4d., and land-orders for over £l2, were deposited foi
rent and survey fees of the above eighty-eight “ blocks.”
The social institutions of Ipswich are very numerous and important.
Art, music, and literature are largely engaged in by the residents. Tht


te ress i s a bly represented by the Queensland Times , the Advocate , and the
Standard; and societies for the encouragement of all manly sports are
innumerable. >
n
LAIDLEY.
Eare from Brisbane, 65.; distance, 51 miles. On the route to this
ie ( l m portant farming centre a tract of fine dairying country is passed through,
is back of which again on both sides of the railway line are numerous fertile
e valle y s an( l luxuriant scrubs, affording the means of subsistence to a large
9 n umber of farmers, dairymen, and timber-getters. What is known as the
Rosewood Scrub, contains some of the finest agricultural land in the
i colony, and has enriched thousands. Before the better-suited Northern
j l an( ls were put under cane, a considerable amount of sugar was produced
' bere. At the present time maize, cotton, and hay crops receive a good
deal of attention, and to these may be added the cultivation of the grape
vine, the credit of which may largely be given to the Germans, who have
made this their home in large numbers.
An abundant supply of running water, the ease with which fodder
can be raised, and a ready access to the metropolitan market, will combine
to make this essentially a dairy-farming and fruit-growing district.
At Hatton Vale, a neighbouring district, pig-raising is largely carried on,
and supports a well equipped factory. Rosewood Railway Station is 36
miles from Brisbane, and is the centre of a quiet but prosperous little town-
ship, consisting of a few general stores, a couple of hotels, two saw-mills
and a moulding-mill, churches, &c. Creameries have been established here,
at Lanefield, and Grandchester (near the line of railway), and many other®
at some little distance away. Amongst the latter may be mentioned the
Co-operative Creamery at Rosevale Plains (on the south side of the line),
which is worked by steam power, and at date of last report was putting
500 gallons of milk through the separator per diem.
The petty sessions district of Laidley is the second largest producer
of maize in Queensland, and probably the chief producer of hay and chaff
(especially lucerne). The output of English potatoes is also considerable,
being something like the fourth in the colony in point of importance. To
show the amount of trade which is done it may be stated that during 1896
there were forwarded from the Laidley Railway Station 11,504 bales hay,
17,596 bales chaff, 4457 bags chaff, 45,153 bags maize, 4175 bags potatoes,
and 9378 gallons cream.
As might be expected, a thriving township forms the outlet for all this
agricultural wealth. Several of the Brisbane produce merchants have
here their resident buyer, and on recognised market days the place pre-
sents quite a lively appearance from the number of faimers and farmers’
families who have come to sell and to buy. Some half-dozen stores, the


inevitable hotels, a post office, a School of Arts, two or three saddlers and
other caterers for domestic and farm requirements, go to make up one of
the busiest little townships in the Moreton district; and no where, pos-
sibly, could these hard working, honest folk, find an abler champion than
in their valued local paper, the Lockyer Star.
Passing through Forest Hill, where dairying is largely in evidence,
the traveller will next reach GATTON—distant about 61 miles from Bris- ,
bane ; fare, 7s. Id. As regards maize and fodder growing, this petty
sessions district holds a very important position, but it is the potato crop
which may be said to be the staple, the quantity raised here in 1895
(2,496 tons), being second only to the crop in the Highfields district. Of
late years, however, fruit-growing has been entered upon, side by side with
the older established branches of agriculture, and with so much success that
Gatton oranges and grapes are in great demand, although the industry is
still in its infancy.
Interest, however, centres in Gatton, of late, principally on account of
its being the postal and market town of the Queensland Agricul-
tural College, which is distant about miles. The area
of the reserve upon which the College Farm is situated
is 1692 acres, and both the buildings and land are eminently
adapted to imparting a thorough knowledge of general horticul-
ture and agriculture in their scientific as well as practical aspects.
Agricultural operations are already in progress under the direction of the
Principal, Professor E. M. Shelton, M.Sc. A staff of able assistants
will be ready to second the efforts of this gentleman when the College is
thrown open to students (on the 30th June next.) The district is
healthy, and well supplied with churches of the Protestant and Roman
Catholic faiths, several well-stocked stores, a School of Arts, a Bank,
the usual educational facilities, creameries, &c.
The situation of this township of about 300 people is delightful.
Hard by flows a tributary of the Brisbane River—Lockyer Creek—
which ensures at all times an abundant supply of water. Many of
the river bends are extremely picturesque, and in its waters some fine
mullet, etc. may be caught at certain seasons of the year.
HELIDON.
72 miles —fare Bs. 7d. ;'is reached in something under 2f hours from
the metropolis, and the first stoppage is made here by the “ Sydney
Mail” after leaving Ipswich. Being on the high road from Brisbane to
Toowoomba, it was at one time a busy place, but the advent of the
railway has of course much reduced the traffic from teams and travellers,
as well as the number of stock passing through. Special interest
attaches to important quarries in the vicinity, locally known as


“ Pearson’s,” from which a very large quantity of stone has been and
is being trucked to Brisbane, for use in the building of the large bridges,
and other public works constructed of late years. Near these quarries and
ill the various glens and nooks with which this country at the foot of the
Main Range abounds, the most charming scenery is found; majestic tree
ferns, stately palms, roaring waterfalls, and lichen covered rocks seem to
open out to the delighted visitor a veritable fairyland, and many are the
picnic parties which make a starting place of this or the adjoining stations
of Murphy’s Creek or Spring Bluff. In the vicinity of Helidon several
mineral springs have been found, and are commercially utilised. By the
courtesy of the proprietors, the best known of these is open to all comers,
and is credited with so great vitalising powers that a trip to the Downs
could not be considered complete without a call at this place of interest.
Some 20 miles from Helidon is the settlement of Ravensbourne, and
.although the road is somewhat rough, the visitor will find himself
well repaid by the rugged grandeur of the hill country over which
he passes; whilst, to the naturalist, new wonders in the three worlds
open out at every turn. The above is 8 miles distant from Hampton
Station on the Crow’s Nest line ; fare Bs. Bd. to Toowoomba. Ascending
the main range on the railway line a series of panoramic views which are
excelled in few parts of Australia unfold themselves before the
•delighted eyes of the traveller, and these are scarcely lost to view when
one reaches
TOOWOOMBA.
Fare from Brisbane 11s. Bd. Distance 101 miles. 1,000 to 2,000
feet above sea level. The Capital of the Darling Downs and, as such,
of considerable importance. The estimated population at the close
of 1895 (including the shires of Middle Ridge and Drayton) was 12,800
persons, and the number of dwellings 1,975. The borough of Too-
woomba enjoys the distinction of having been one of the first proclaimed,
and for its relatively short existence of thirty-seven years has been a
marvellously prosperous one —commercially, agriculturally, and socially.
Although by no means the only town which can lay claim to the
title, this is undoubtedly the favourite sanatorium of Southern
Queensland. The vice-regal party usually spend the hottest months
of the year in the neighbourhood, and much of the prosperity of
the place must be attributed to the constant influx of visitors
Substantial flour and sawmills receive in a steady stream two of
the most prominent products of the soil; some half-dozen tanneries
convert into a finished article the hides and skins from surrounding
districts, whilst the products of the orchard and market gardens find a
ready outlet at one of the many stores, or at the preserving works in the
centre of the town. Add to this the various foundries, smithies, tin-plate

working establishments, breweries, aerated-water factories, soap factories,
fellmongeries, boot and furniture factories; and if the visitor arrive on
,market day (Saturday), he will be confronted by a scene of such intense
activity that will leave no doubt in his mind as to the prospects of a town
which is said to have once aspired to the position of metropolis ! Many
public buildings —not without architectural merit—are found here. The
Grammar School (cost £9,058), Town Hall (cost about £4,000), School of
Arts (£3,800), Lunatic Asylum (accomodating about 400 patients; cost
something like £107,050), Post Office, Banks, Court House, Hospital (58
bedQ; Masonic Hall, and various churches of the Protestant, Roman
Catholic, and Jewish persuasion are mostly substantial and attractive
buildings. The town is lighted throughout with gas, for which the
charge has lately been fixed at 9s. 2d. per I,oooft. (subject to the usual
rebate of 10 %.) The water supply is abundant, and is supplied from
waterworks, which adjoin the Hospital, on high ground.
Public baths, and extensive public gardens (Queen’s Park, in the
centre of the town, containing 70 acres; and a reserve of 32 acres on the
Range), provide healthful recreation, whilst literary and scientific tastes are
catered for by the School of Arts Library, of 4387 vols. (end of 1895), the
meetings of the “ Gordon ” and other literary clubs, several newspapers
—amongst which the most prominent are the Chronicle, the Darling
Downs Gazette, the Settler, &c.—and the various meetings of a couple of
agricultural and several church societies. Besides the Public Schools,
there are some 13 private scholastic establishments.
The suburbs of Toowoomba, including the populous district of High-
fields on the north, and the prosperous settlements of Emu and King’s
Creek, to the south, are occupied chiefly by a farming population. In the
suburbs there are several beautiful gardens that would do no discredit to
any country in the world. Here will be found growing in abundance,
apples, pears, apricots, peaches, nectarines, mulberries, lemons, oranges,
figs, plums of all varieties, loquats, quinces, the walnut, &c. The grape
grows here luxuriantly, and is cultivated with great care and attention by
several German colonists, who have also manufactured wine of excellent
quality. Some of the gardens are places of public resort, and are a sort
of Baden Baden on a small scale.
Highfields, in addition to its agricultural resources, has vast quantities
of timber, which gives employment to a large number of hands. It has
two sawmills, and supplies the district for miles around with the most
valuable timber.
As may be seen from the map, this railway station is an im-
portant junction. It is the starting point for the Western line, the
Pittsworth branch line and the Crow’s Nest line (Highfields branch);
besides being an important station on the main line to Sydney, Melbourne

and Adelaide. Continuing on the Southern line, some pretty country is
passed through; timber-covered mountain spurs alternate with picturesque
valleys, through which limpid streams wend their way. Here may ba
seen the snug little farmhouse, and there the fields of lucerne or maize
with their varied tints, whilst scattered over the landscape are the dairy
cattle to which the district owes so much of its prosperity. Under the
new order of things, butter and cheese making promise to take a still
more prominent position ; for whilst there are still some excellent makes
of “ farmers” butter and cheese, the bulk of the milk now finds its way to
the numerous creameries and butter and cheese factories dotted along the
line. Amongst these may be mentioned the Gowrie Junction butter,
cheese, and ice factory, Daly Bros, factory—Jondaryan (Western Railway),
the Westbrook Creamery, the Southbrook Creamery, and Pittsworth
Dairy.
Purther south—at Gbeenmount, in the neighbourhood of King’s
C reek two of the largest dairying concerns in the colony are situated.
’Che Greenmount Dairy Co., Ltd., distant about two miles from the rail-
way station of that name, has become celebrated for the quality of its


cheese, whilst the Pilton Dairy Co., Ltd., “ The Glen,” Kino’s Creek, is
producing butter of equal merit. During the year just closed, suppliers to
the latter received from to G-|d. per gallon of milk, the average being
and the company carries forward a substantial credit balance. The
Greenmount cheese factory has a storage capacity of 18 tons. From
CAMBOOYA (125 miles from Brisbane, fare 14s. 2d.), a coach runs three
times a week to the Leyburn gold fields (population about 500 persons).
The route covers a distance of about 29 miles, and the coach fare is 10s.
This is the most accessible railway station to the above fields. Adjoining
Leyburn are the Thane’s Creek and Talgai gold fields, to which the
nearest township of importance is Pratten—the centre of what is known as
Darkey Flat, beautifully situated on the Condamine. It is reached from
Hendon Railway Station by a coach running twice a week; the fare is 2s.
6d. The repurchased agricultural Toolburra lands are on this coach
route, and contain 11,000 acres of land. At date of writing, a few acres
remain to be purchased from the Lands Department at a reasonable price.
Yearly payments equal to £7 12s. lOd. on every £lOO of purchase money
are allowed; so that principal and interest will be defrayed in 20 years.
CLIFTON.
Distant 148 miles from Brisbane (fare, 86s. lid.) ; is a thriving
agricultural township. The chief resources of the district are wheat and
maize culture. Deposits of coal occur near here, but these do not appear
to be very actively worked at present. Besides the usual stores and hotels,
&c., there are a School of Arts, a State School, a Divisional Board Hall,
and Churches in the towmship. ALLORA, lately connected by railway
with Hendon (Southern railway) is within easy driving distance, and there
the richest black soil abounds, so that a great variety of crops can be grown
to perfection. In depth it varies from sto 10 feet, and in addition to the
water of Dalrymple and other smaller creeks an abundant supply can
generally be obtained 30 or 40 feet below the surface. The estimated
population of this Municipal borough at the close of 1895 was 1,000
persons, and the number of dwellings was 230. The township comprises
some well appointed general stores, butcher’s and saddler’s shops, several
hotels and churches, Municipal Chambers, a Bank, State School, Post and
Telegraph Office, and School of Arts (1182 vols). The manufac-
turing industries are well represented here by a flour mill, a couple of
dairy factories, a soap and candle works, and a soft drinks factory.
Referring to the dairying industry, it may be said that that no part of the
world is better suited than is this for the production of abundant green
feed. Lucerne, wheat, oats, barley, maize, and panicum grow luxuri-
antly ; and a fairly good rainfall, combined with streams of the purest
w'ater, offer exceptional advantages to the dairy farmer. The presence of
numerous factories and creameries, and proximity to the markets of

Warwick and Toowoomba ensure success to the careful man. The Press
is represented by the Allora Guardian (weekly)—a name to which the
latter is thoroughly entitled, for its spirited advocacy of the claims of the
district, as well as its consistent support of every forward movement.
WARWICK.
Pare from Brisbane, 18s. 9d. ; distance, 169 miles. This is an
important centre for the farming, mining, and dairying districts by which
it is surrounded. The town is prettily situated on the River Condamine>
wherein is found an abundance of cod and other fish, and is, perhaps,
more substantial in appearance than any other town in the colony. The
public buildings—among which may be noted the Town Hall, Masonic
Hall, Police Court, the Banks, several handsome Churches, a Convent, an
Hospital, &c., are mostly built of a durable stone found here in abundance.
The use of the latter is not confined to the larger buildings of the town,
many of the private residences being apparently built for succeeding
generations, and an air of quaintness is thus given which is peculiar to
Warwick. A School of Arts, with a library of some 3,767 volumes, the
Argus and the Examiner —both of great merit, and various societies
minister to the educational needs of the town; two tastefully laid out central
squares afford healthful recreation to residents, whilst the annual show
of the local Agricultural Society, and the Caledonian Sports—also an
annual event —ai’e the occasion of large gatherings from far and near.
As at Toowoomba—although in a lesser degree—the cultivation of the
grape vine is pursued side by side with other branches of agriculture,
several of the Warwick vintages being well-known throughout the Colony for
their excellent quality. Indeed, some of the surrounding hills would seem
to be the “ beau ideal ” of the vigneron. The remarks regarding crops at
Clifton and Allora are generally applicable to the whole of this district.
Warwick had at the close of 1895 an estimated population of 4,000
persons, and about 830 dwellings. An abundant supply of really excellent
water is laid on to every house within a certain radius. The pumping
works, having a reservoir capacity of 96,552 cubic feet, were completed in
1883, and the cost to end of 1895 was £19,598. A couple of flour-mills
turn into well-known brands of flour the wheat of the district, of which
wheat-raising may be considered a staple industry. A large brewery is
also doing a considerable local trade. Warwick is well supplied with
stores, stationers, jewellers, Ac. The medical and legal profession, tobac-
conists, and the “Press” are also represented ; the latter, as stated, by two
ably conducted papers. Much of the commercial activity of this thriving
town arises from the traffic to and from Goondiwindi, as well as from
that with Thane’s Creek, Talgai, and other adjacent goldfields. The
malting of grain seems likely to take a prominent position among the
industries of the place.


KILLARNEY.
Fare from Warwick, Bs. 6d. ; distance, 28 miles, Nestling among
the timber clad hills which give rise to the Condamine, this township
seems to invite the tourist by its irresistable charms. Here are the
“ Dagmar ” and “ Brown’s Falls,” imposing in their grandeur, or charm-
ingly playful—as the time of year decrees. Not far away on the heads of
the river are the trout hatcheries, a visit to which will well repay the visitor.
Here may be said to be the home of the apiarist, for here it was that bee-
keeping received its first real impetus, and Killarney honey ranks in our
metropolitan markets amongst the best. Two of the largest apiaries are
well worth a visit, which may be made by the stranger in full assurance of
a courteous welcome. Tobacco growing also occupies in this district a
most important place. Nor would a brief sketch of this historically named
locality be complete without reference to the “lakes” or lagoons, which
would seem to have been responsible for the name “ Killarney.” A few
miles from the township—on the Canning Downs Estate —are some of
those beautiful pieces of water which abound in South-eastern Queens-
land. This trip affords an opportunity for a lovely drive or ride ; indeed,
these are here the order of the day, and one cannot find a better spot in
South Queensland in which to spend a season of quiet enjoyment.
Returning from Killarney to Warwick we pass the now celebrated Yangan
Cheese Factory. In close proximity to a railway station and creek, the
factory seems to have an ideal situation, and many a trophy of the cheese
product of this proprietary factory has testified to the support accorded to
it by the surrounding cattle owners.
Just outside Warwick another factory belonging to the same pro-
prietors is seen, this time for the manufacture of “ Silver wood ” butter
—so named from the nearest railway station—a brand which not only has
earned the highest reputation in this Colony, but is even now making a
name for itself in other lands. By a recent steamer of the Nippon Yushen
Kaisha (Japanese line of steamers), a trial shipment of l,ooolbs. was
despatched to Hongkong, under the bonus system, and this has been
preceded by others of the highest quality which the Colony can produce.
The adaptability of the deep rich soil to the growth of green feed, and the
abundance of water and shelter for stock, make this an essentially dairy-
farming district.
STANTHORPE.
Fare from Brisbane 225. Bd. Distance 207 miles. Quite a change
of scenery awaits the visitor on his arrival at this tin-mining centre.
Although—owing to the decadence of the main industry—Stanthorpe
has little of its former bustle, it still retains evidences of prosperity.
Between 900 and 1,200 persons support a fairly large number of stores
and other places of business. The local School of Arts contains some-


thing under 1,000 volumes, several churches minister to the religious
wants of the people, and the proverbial “ cameraderie” of the latter offers
great inducements to those who would avail themselves of the salubrity of
the climate. A considerable trade is carried on with Texas, seventy
miles distant, famed—so far —for the excellence of its tobacco and its
mining industry. The passenger traffic is catered for by a weekly coach,
by which the fare is 20s. Great as the above resources undoubtedly are—
and silver mining, at least, never showed better prospects—there is a
great agricultural future before this border town. Wheat is successfully
raised here, as much as £1 per bag having been realised by Texas
growers, and it seems likely that mills will shortly be erected to grind the
grain on the spot. As regards silver, some splendid properties have been
acquired at the “ Silver Spur” and elsewhere, and on Pikedale Station
(not far from Texas) so satisfactory has been the quality of the galena
ore that a reverberatory furnace and buildings are going up at a heavy
cost. The matte obtained from some of the ore, assayed roughly : Gold,
5 dwt. per ton ; silver, 29(H ozs. ; copper, 28 to 88%.
Deep sinking for tin—owing to a depressed market —has not yet been
practised to any great extent, but where tried has been eminently
successful. The resources of this district are not, however, of the mineral
kingdom only ; as is evidenced by the fact that, recently, of Stanthorpe
grown cabbage realised as high as 9s. per dozen in a Western town at a
time when similar vegetables were only realising ls. Gd. to 2s. per bag in
Brisbane ; a fact which speaks volumes for the quality of the former.
GOONDIWINDI.
148 miles from Warwick by coach. Fare £2 10s. Od. On this
mail route, the visitor will pass the township of Inglewood, which is
prettily situated on the Macintyre Brook (on which—under the name
of the Macintyre River-—Goondiwindi is likewise situated.) Inglewood is
essentially an agricultural district, and tobacco growing holds an
important place amongst its industries. The larger town of the two
(Goondiwindi) with a population under the thousand, can boast of several
churches, a hospital. State school, Bank, a School of Arts (about 700
volumes) and a private school, and may lay claim to some importance as
the proposed terminus of a branch line of railway to be constructed from
Warwick, Dalby or Pittsworth —as may be sanctioned by Parliament.
Sporting interests are looked after by the Racing Club, and various
Athletic, Football, Tennis and Cricket clubs. Art and literature are
catered for by the local photographer, the stationers and the “ M‘lntyre
Herald,” an excellent newspaper ; (published Tuesday afternoons). The
legal, medical, and accountants’ professions are ably represented. In
addition to the usual complement of general stores, butchers, bakers,

saddlers and blacksmiths, Goondiwindi has a number of builders, cabinet-
makers, milliners, bootmakers and tailors, a couple of undertakers, a
jeweller, chemist, and auctioneer ; constituting probably the most impor-
tant border town of Queensland. The district is said to be well adapted to
the cultivation of grapes and oranges, and when connected by rail with
the larger markets of Australia may be expected to come greatly into
prominence in agricultural matters.
ST. GEORGE.
130 miles coaching from Yeulba ; 140 miles from Mitchell. Fare
from £2 to £3.
From an agricultural standpoint the township is yet in its infancy..
Cereals have been successfully grown for many years, hut on a very small
scale, and grapes thrive well in the somewhat sandy soil. Black soil
plains of great depth and exceptional fertility are found in the neighbour-
hood, however, and although at present the importance of this township
is mainly due to its position on the great stock routes, there is little doubt
that at no distant time agriculture will he largely in evidence. St.
George has communication with Goondiwindi by a stock route via
Well town. It possesses amongst other public buildings a School of Arts
containing over 500 volumes of hooks. The “ Standard” is a progressive
reepsentative of the Press.
CUNNAMULLA.
140 miles by coach from Charleville—fare £2 10s. Od. This rapidly
rising town is of special interest as the proposed terminus of a railway
extension from Charleville —now almost completed. A population of
some hundreds support 5 or G stores ; besides a brewery, a brickyard,
several saddlers, land and station agents, hotels, bakers, butchers, coach-
works, and blacksmiths, builders, a plumber, surgeon, chemist,
solicitor, hairdresser, an auctioneer, an accountant and a newspaper,
There are also two Banks, an Hospital, Divisional Board Office, Public
Library (over 800 volumes), State school, and private School for Girls.
The interests of the town are well looked after by a “ Progress Associa-
tion,” and there is some probability that their efforts will result in the
establishment of a local fire brigade, and also in the installation of the
electric light—from which the power will be derived from the Cunna-
mulla hore. The town is situated on the Great Bourke Route to New
South Wales, and consequently enjoys an important stock and general
traffic with that Colony—from which it is about 70 miles distant. Some
idea of the volume of the trade may be gathered from the fact that in
November alone of last year the customs collections from the two local
bonds amounted to £356.


CHARLEVILLE.
Fare from Brisbane, 475. 1d.—483 miles. A very important pastoral
township, and commercial centre for that portion of the colony comprised
in the Warrego and South Gregory districts. The business establishments
include those of the storekeepers (some of them carrying on business on a
large scale), bootmakers, auctioneers, butchers, bakers, watchmakers, hair-
dressers, fruiterers and cordial makers, saddlers, blacksmiths and wheel-
wrights ; Messrs. Cobb & Co.’s, coach factory, a soap works, two newspaper
and job printing offices, two or more sawmills, a builder, an upholsterer,
and a plumber. In a professional way there are a surgeon, with the usual
accompaniment of chemist, one or more solicitors, a barrister, and a sur-
veyor. The wants of the district in the way of clothing are supplied by a
tailor and dressmaker. There are both a private and a State school for
boys and girls; other public buildings are the Hospital and School of Arts
(over 500 vols.) One of the most promising industries of the place is that
of meat preserving, for which purpose extensive works are being erected
capable of slaughtering and chilling 400 head of cattle and 7000 sheep
per week. Another feature of this western town is the bore —one of the
best known in the colony for its curative properties. The following is
given as an instance “ Mr. Leadbetter, of Morven, met with a fall from
his horse and came up to Charleville to avail himself of baths at the bore.
Mr. Leadbetter tells us that the effect of the water .on his injuries was
astonishing. In a few days he felt as sound as ever, while before using
the water he could scarcely move. The water also cured Mr. Leadbetter,
some time previously, of a severe attack of rheumatism ; for the alleviation
of which complaint, however, its properties are well known.” Racing, it
may be said, is carried on with vigour in these western towns, and Charle-
ville is no exception to the rule. The Charleville Racing Club has recently
been formed, and has already held a Successful meeting. This is a great
coaching centre ; routes going from here to Augathella (56), Tambo (186),
Adavale (136), Cunnamulla (140), Eulo (180), Barringun (220), Blackall
(216), Thargomindah (280), Windorah (806), and Hungerford (380 miles).
ROMA.
Fare from Brisbane, 335. 4d. —318 miles. This town has been called
the “ Queen City of the West,” and certainly in some respects the title is
not unmerited. For healthfulness the district is unsurpassed, and although
Roma itself does not exhibit the bustle which it once did—especially at
the time it was a railway terminus—still there are evidences on all hands
of a commercial solidity and agricultural prosperity which promise well
for its future. Here is the chief centre of the grape-growing industry;
Maranoa wheat bids fair to hold an important position amongst Queens-
land breadstuff's; whilst not only grapes, but oranges and other fruits
thrive in the district. Speaking here a month or two ago, Mr. Benson —


Government fruit expert—said he considered the district eminently suited
to the apricot, prune, fig, peach, olive, pear, &c. The municipality of
Roma covers an area of 15 square miles, has an estimated population of
1400 (December 1895), and contains 400 dwellings. The numerous well-
appointed stores do a considerable trade with the outlying stations, of
which there are many fine examples in the district. A School of Arts,
musical societies, churches, and solicitors, minister to the intellectual!
spiritual, and litigious needs of the residents, whilst the Press is
ably represented by the Western Star and the Maranoa Advocate.
Several large manufacturing industries are carried on here, the
most noticeable being flour-milling. Besides this there are a
soap and cordial manufactory, and numbers of wine-making estab-
lishments , about 25 miles to the north there is also a large
saw-mill. The town enjoys the advantage of having two resident
medical men, and so highly adapted is the climate considered for
the cure of phthisis, &c., that a suggestion was recently made to
establish here an hospital for consumptives—a proposition which, for
reasons we can to some extent understand, did not find favour at the
hands of residents, and appears now to have been abandoned. The present
hospital occupies a delightful position. While dry, the climate is not arid,
the average yearly rainfall over a term of years having been 41-16 inches!
The soil in the neighbourhood comprises red and chocolate volcanic,
black alluvial (both highly productive), and sandy ridges. The latter are
stated, on the authority of Mr. Tardent, to be specially suited to light
wines, particularly white ; the first mentioned soils, having a marly or cal-
careous sub-soil, give—when planted with the right sort of vines—full
bodied and highly flavoured liquorous wines, whilst the alluvial loams
(with a fair proportion of lime), yield very palatable white and red wines.
Close by is the Village Settlement of Wallumbilla, a prosperous
individualistic settlement, from which some splendid samples of the
“ of the vine” have already found their way to the metropolis.
Reverting to Roma, it should be mentioned that juvenile instruction is
by no means neglected, both State and private schools being available for
the purpose. The public buildings not already mentioned are the Masonic
Hall, Court-house, Police Barracks, and Gaol.
The water supply of the town has been hitherto obtained from a large
dam on the outskirts of the town, but with a view to obtaining a better
supply, a movement is on foot—if steps have not already been taken—to
test the artesian possibilities of the ground on which the town itself is
built.
As the town extends, the high land promises to become the favourite
site for both public and private buildings. The streets show great uni-
formity, and are very roomy, with a width of 99ft. each. Each of the lead-

ing thoroughfares is pleasantly shaded with pepperine and white cedar
trees, most of which were planted about nine years ago, and during that
short period have attained a wonderful growth. On almost every hand
beautiful shade trees are observed. They are particularly noticeable in
Queen’s Park, comprising an area of Hi acres, and situated almost in the
centre of the town. The grounds are under the control of the municipality,
who have* erected a grand stand and lavatory, so that the park is now
a favourite resort of local cricketers and athletes generally. There are also
two recreation reserves of 68 and 50 acres respectively, which will no doubt
prove of incalculable value to the inhabitants of Roma in tho distant
future.
GYMPIE.
hare from Brisbane, 125.—107 miles. This is an important town of
12,000 inhabitants (Dec. 1895.) Although rich deposits of reef gold, in
the very heart of the town, have undoubtedly contributed mainly to its
support, evidences of agricultural activity are not wanting at the annual
agricultural shows which are held here, and there is no doubt that in the
near future Gympie will find an important source of wealth in the splendid
agricultural lands by which it is surrounded. The estimated number of
dwellings within the municipality at the close of 1895 was 2119 (the
fourth greatest in the colony.) Besides these there are a number of
churches, schools (state, private and denominational), an extensive hospital,
banks, hotels, a theatre, numerous public buildings, amongst which may
be mentioned the Post Office and Town Hall—both substantial buildings,
and a School of Arts. The sporting interests of residents are looked after
by various racing, fooball, tennis, &c., clubs ; besides which there are a
number of musical and literary societies and lodges. The Press are
represented by two high-class papers—the Gympie Times and the Gympie
Miner. Amongst the benevolent institutions are a Ladies’ Benevolent
Society, a Juvenile Dorcas Society, and an Ambulance Corps—recently
supplied with a special ambulance waggon.
Gympie, as will be seen elsewhere, is a most important mining centre,
and as such is worthily represented in the Queensland Internation Exhi-
bition, which is now open. Two of the mines—the “Phoenix Golden
Pile” and the “ North Smithfield”—have quite recently paid away £9BOO,
and £8854 for the quarter’s dividends, the “ Columbia Smithfield” and
“No. 4 Phoenix ’ paying £BOOO each during the same quarter, and many
others declaring handsome dividends. Towards the close of last year,
several of the above claims, with others, crushed in one month 2169 tons
of stone, yielding 6028 ozs. 8 dwts. of gold, and the dividends paid in that
period amounted to over seventeen thousnnd pounds sterling ! Although
the proprietary of a few mines is limited in number, most of the “ scrip”
is very well apportioned over the district, and the beneficial effect upon


the town of the distribution of these large dividends, in addition to the
thousands which are paid away in weekly wages, is apparent.
As regards methods of working, Gympie managers and directors have
shown a considerable amount of enterprise. Examples of this may be
found in the inauguration on the field of the “cyanide” process for
saving the very fine gold ; and in the crosscut —1200 feet in length—on
the property of the No. 4 North Phoenix Co., which has even now come on a
solid reef, so far yielding over 5 ozs. to the ton. Signs of progress are not
wanting in the town itself. Steps are being taken to increase the water
supply, a matter of great importance where a numerous population and a
quantity of steam power needs a large supply.
Some big finds were made in the seventies at Monkland, the extreme
end of the field. In 1872, for instance, “ Nos. 7 and 8 Monkland” reduced
1514 tons of stone for a return of 10,105 ozs., and in the following year
1480 tons from “Nos. 2 and 3 South Monkland” gave the handsome
return of 11,269 ozs.; the “ North Glanmire” —on the same line—in 1881
crushed 6,541 tons for 12,528 ozs.; while its immediate neighbours, the
“ No. 1 North” and the “ Nos. 2 and 3 North Glanmire,” turned out some
splendid stone a year or two later; the last-mentioned mine in 1885-6
gave nearly 37,000 ozs.
MARYBOROUGH.
Fare from Brisbane—by rail 18s. sd. (167 miles) ; by steamer, 20s.
saloon (180 miles). This is a very important shipping and manufacturing
centre. The estimated population of the municipality at the close of
1895 was 10,000 persons, and the number of dwellings was 2,245.
Education, music, literature, and art all receive an unusual amount
of attention at the hands of the residents. The School of Arts—an
imposing structure erected at a cost of nearly £4,000 —contains a museum,
and over 8,000 vols., and in this respect is the third in the colony in
point of importance ; the curriculum of the establishment, however,
yields to none. Elementary and technical education are splendidly
catered for, and by a judicious system of penny readings, &c., much
useful information has been popularised during certain seasons of the
year. Maryborough can also boast of two of the finest grammar schools
in the colony (that for boys having cost some £IO,OOO and that for girls—
£7,ooo. These are beautifully situated in extensive and well kept
grounds, and nothing is spared by the management which can minister to
the comfort and success of scholars. In addition to spacious show
grounds and a beautifully appointed cemetery of 60 acres —constituting
one of the sights of the town—there are picturesquely situated Public
Gardens on the river banks, within a stone’s throw of the Post Office.
These are under the care of a resident curator and staff, and contain
many rare and interesting plants, not commonly found in Botanical


| Gardens. Access to the “ bush-house” may be obtained on application at
the curator’s lodge. The Maryborough foundries are attaining great
prominence for the excellent quality of their work, and many
important contracts for sugar mill machinery and railway locomotives
have been successfully carried out. Pialba.— Distant 25 miles—fare 2s.
A deservedly popular summer watering place, and from recent indica-
\ tions there seems to be the intention—by encouraging industries
along the line of railway—to develop the latent resources
i of the country, and thus make this an additional source of
wealth to Maryborough. At present the chief trade is in sugar, timber,
coal and iron; the three first being largely produced in the district.
Close to the town is the famed Yengarie Sugar Refinery—between which
and the distant plantations, a large railway traffic in cane and juice
is carried on. The latter is conveyed, where practicable, in pipes laid on
from the plantations, but that carried by rail is enclosed in enormous
cylindrical tanks—each holding some 3,000 gallons of juice. Amongst
the notable buildings are the Hospital—situated on the extreme edge
of the town, the principal State schools, several of tfie Hotels and Banks,
the Town Hall, and the Catholic, Presbyterian, and Anglican churches
all fine buildings. St. Paul’s (of the latter denomination) contains one of
the finest peals of bells in the colony, and the performances of the bell-
ringers upon this peal fully sustain the musical reputation which the place
en i°y s - this connection it may be mentioned that there are both a
“Liedertafel” and an Operatic Society here. The “Press” is well and
largely represented ; the following being the principal publications,
Maryb orough Chronicle, Wide Bay New*, and Colonist.
BUNDABERG.
Fare from Brisbane, by rail, 235. 7d (217 miles) ; by steamer, 255.
(saloon), 272 miles. A rising municipality, having an estimated population,
(Dec 1895) of 5000, exclusive of outlying districts. The prosperity of the
town is chiefly due to the large sugar-growing interests with which the resi-
dents are identified. In every direction stretch such well known plantations
as Bingera, Fairymead, Mon Repos, Sea View, Waterview, and Winder-
mere, whilst on the east side of the town is situated the far-famed refinery
of Messrs. Cran Bros.: until the erection of the Colonial Sugar Company’s
refinery in Brisbane, the largest in the colony. The latest machinery has
been added by the Messrs. C’ran ; and at the present time manufactures a
large quantity of first-class refined sugar and golden syrup, the juice being
com eyed from the plantation to the works. A number of important in-
dustries such as saw-milling, iron foundry work, co-operative dairying,
distilling, brewing, ice-making, pottery and brick-making, soap-making, and
fanning are carried on here to a large extent, so that the future prosperity of
the town is assured. Besides the State schools, there are a number of public-
G


buildings, such as the School of Arts, Theatre (Queen’s), Custom-house,
Court-house, the Post Office—a substantial building surmounted by a turret
and clock, of which the face is illuminated at night and visible all over the
town—and the Hospital. On the bank of the river (Burnett), there is a fine
reserve, intended for public gardens, which will be an incalculable boon to
residents when the town becomes more crowded ; and on the southern
boundary of the town is found the Racecourse. A few miles out there is a
favourite sea-side resort of the residents. The progressive nature of Bunda-
berg is evident in its press, the Mail, and Star, and in its social institutions,
amongst which the town band is not by any means the least, the members
of this musical organisation having on many occasions gained well-earned
honours in competition with those of other towns. Several first-class hotels
offer the very best accomodation to visitors. It should be mentioned that
Bundaberg has participated to a large extent in the trade with the newly
settled Isis Scrub (distant about 30 —33 miles by rail), and has in times past
done considerable business with the famed Mt. Perry, from which it is about
67 miles by rail. Another line of railway—that to Gladstone —has been
completed for 35 or 40 miles, and will probably before many years are
passed, place this town in direct communication with Rockhampton and
Central Districts.
ROCKHAMPTON.
Distance by sea from Brisbane about 420 miles ; saloon fare, £3 10s.
This is the chief town and port of Central Queensland ; indeed, as far as
exports are concerned, it holds a higher position than Brisbane. A very
important trade is carried on in frozen meat, wool, tallow, sheepskins, gold,
precious stones (mostly opals), horses, leather manure (a preparation of
bone-dust), bones, hoofs, and sugar. In 1896, the value of exports
reached £2,405,792, and the imports for the same period were valued
at £569,732. The wharfage is commodious, and is being extended.
Although the temperature is somewhat high at times, Rockhampton
is noted for its healthfulness, the picturesque nature of its suburbs,
and the evident prosperity of its inhabitants. Life here in the winter
months is all that could be desired—both as regards climatic and
social advantages. A School of Arts—one of the finest buildings de-
voted to that purpose in the colony—provides ample literary food in its
eight or nine thousand volumes. Rowing, cricket, tennis, swimming, and
rifle clubs afford a variety of out-door sports ; whilst numbers of literary,
debating, agricultural, pastoral, and musical societies are in operation.
Rockhampton enjoys also the distinction of being the seat of two
bishoprics, and of having the only cathedral in the colony which is
throughout lighted by electricity. The latter (St. Paul’s, Church of
Eng.), is an imposing piece of architecture, situated at the corner of
William and Alma Streets, but bids fair to be eclipsed by the cathedral
lately erected by the Roman Catholic Church. Pleasure seekers will be


delighted with the surroundings of the city, and the many pleasure resorts
which are within easy access ; amongst these may be mentioned the “ Bat’s
Caves, of stalagtitic formation. Emu Park, a charming sea-side watering
place, is reached by train in less than an hour and a-half, at a cost of ss.
Bd. for first-class return ticket; and so popular is the place amongst
“ Rockhamptonites,” that hundreds of residents visit it upon every public
holiday. Fishing, yatching, and shooting are to be had in abundance,
both here and at the neighbouring township of Yeppoon. Capacious
hotels afford every comfort, and many of the luxuries of city life ; this is
especially so at Emu Park. Besides the above, the Botanical Gardens of
Rockhampton, in which there is an extensive lagoon whereon numbers of
wild fowl disport themselves, afford the means of spending many a
pleasant hour. The city is well laid out and lighted—electricity being
iargeiy used for this purpose. The progressive spirit of the place is
markedly shown in the splendid bridge—illuminated by a chain of
powerful “ arc lamps by which the Fitzroy is spanned, thus con-
necting iSorth Rockhampton with Rockhampton proper. The
public buildings are both numerous and substantial. Besides an imposing
Telegraph Office, Supreme Court, Court House, Custom House, Lands
Office, Bond Store, Gaol, Lock-up and Police Station, Mines Office,.
Titles Office and Emigration Depot, there are a Boys’ and Girls’ Grammar
School, State schools and four hospitals, including the magnificent
General Hospital, which contains 108 beds, and is an exceptionally
fine building in point of design, construction and situation. The city
has a State Orphanage, and a denominational Orphanage (Meteor Park),
a Benevolent Asylum, and a Lunatic Reception House. There are some
14 private schools, and one for boys under the direction of the Christian
Brothers, a Ladies’ Benevolent Society, a couple of daily —Morning
Bulletin and Record— and three or four important weekly newspapers—
Capricornian, People's Newspaper , Church Gazette , &c. “ Prosperity”
is stamped upon every feature of this important town, and nowhere
is this more apparent than in East-street on a Saturday night, where
the turnout would do credit, both as regards numbers and style, to-
many a southern town. The population of the two boroughs at the
end of 1895 was 17,157 persons, the number of dwellings 3,030, and
the year’s receipts and expenditure each about £24,000; the city of
Rockhampton being in this respect second only to Brisbane. Jointly,
the boroughs cover 54 l-10th square miles, the largest city area in
the colony, of which the streets are remarkably well laid out
as seen by our map. Some two and a half miles from the Post
Office are the celebrated Lake’s Creek Meat Works, which, with the
quarters of the employees (of whom there area bout 900) constitutes
an extensive settlement in itself. The wages sheet is over £2OO and the
output 300 head of cattle and 1,000 sheep per day. A ten mile ride on


the Central Railway (fare Is. 3d.) brings one to Kabra, whence a coach
runs twice a day to far-famed MOUNT MORGAN (fare Bs.) The latter is a
flourishing municipality of over 4,000 inhabitants, containing a number of
comfortable hotels, besides 700 and 800 dwellings, and more buildings are
constantly being erected. Figures respecting the mining operations will
be found elsewhere. Railway communication with the main line has been
sanctioned by Parliament, the route has been surveyed, and tenders for
the construction of the line will be called upon arrival of the rack rails on
order for a portion of the route. Two Abt locomotives have been
ordered, at a cost of about £3,000 each, for use in connection with the
latter —this system having been considered the most suitable for the steep
gradients which have to be mounted.
Mount Morgan contains many flourishing public institutions;
possibly none more so than the Hospital, a well appointed and beautifully
situated building, of substantial dimensions, and especially well supplied
with water. The hotels are numerous and well kept, besides being
moderate in price. There are a School of Arts, a Town Hall, numbers of
first-class business houses, etc. etc., and the Press are represented by two
progressive papers —the Chronicle , and the Herald. The accompanying
map shows the extensive nature of the township to which these
phenomenald eposits of gold have given rise.
LONGREACH.
424 miles from Rockhampton—Fare, £2 Is. 7d. This is the
most westerly of our towns having railway communication with the
eastern sea-board, and, as seen for tbe first time, opens up an en-
tirely new vista of life. Still, should the visitor expect to find himself
beyond the pale of civilization, he will be most pleasantly disappointed.
About a dozen hotels —many of them offering exceptionally good accom-
modation —several churches and banks, a School of Arts (421 vols.),
State and private schools, Court House, Lands Office, Post and Telegraph
Office and a variety of stores and other places of business constitute the
nucleus of this thriving and progressive pastoral and mining centre.
The present population of the town and district is 2,000 persons.
Longreach has, for a long time, beeen the starting-point for various
coaches; that for Arrilalah (fare 155.), Muttaburra, (255.), Minton,
(585.) and Vergemont (605.) The fact of the Fermoy Opal Fields (Opalton)
being reached from here, gives considerable importance to the town, as
both miners and buyers are constantly to and fro. The distance from
Longreach is 140 to 150 miles, and from Winton it is 78 miles. The
IVinton Herald states that the first discovery of opal there is alleged to
have been close on three years ago, when a Mr. Kerr, then a bookkeeper
on Warrnambool Downs station, picked up a nice specimen on the sur-
face. The original prospectors are said to have taken out stone valued


at £IO,OOO. The depth of sinking was from 6 feet to 45 feet, the best
specimens being found 14 feet from the surface. Some beautiful pieces
of the precious stone have been bought up by speculators for a mere
song, but others have fetched splendid prices. Opalton is on Sandy
Creek, a tributary of Vergemont Creek, and the route from Longreach
les over magnificent plains, dotted with spinifex, gidya, &c., being por-
tion of Maneroo, Evesham and Corona runs, &c. A most progressive
spirit is evinced by the residents of Opalton township, resulting, amongst
other things, in the establishment of a “ Progress Association ” and
“Co-operative Water Supply Society,” and, in their plucky efforts to lessen
crime, by wise restrictions on the liquor traffic. Naturally the country
about these districts is dry, and the climate somewhat hot, but these
drawbacks are being greatly mitigated by artesian water supplies ; in-
deed the activity in this direction has never been greater than it is at the
present time, and from present appearances it will not be long when the
terrors of a drought will be absolutely unknown. Careful attention is also
directed to the improvement of stock, &c., in furtherance of which, an
annual show of some merit is held under the auspices of the Marathon
Pastoral Society. In speaking of the social aspect, it should be mentiond
that the bicycle craze has thoroughly “ caught on ” in Longreach, where
there are some 60 cyclists, and a club has, of course, been formed for
the convenience of devotees. A handsome bridge—just completed at a
cost of £2,800-spans the Thompson River at Longreach. From
Arnlalah (reached by coach) a stock route leads to the Diamantina, and
thence to Lakes Machatti and Phillipi, Carcory H.S., and thence to
Boulia, near which are the famed Elizabeth Hot Springs.
CHARTERS TOWERS.
Fare from Townsville, 9s. 7d.; 82 miles. The centre of the premier
goldfield of Queensland, and one of the most progressive towns in the
Colony. Many of the mines (as shown elsewhere) are phenomenally rich
hut the record was recently reached when the No. 5 Day Dawn crushed
fo. an average of Si oz. 12 dwt. of go d per loa of stone. One months’
dividends amounted to thirty or forty thousand pounds, and the year’s total
exceeded £250,000. In January of the present year an electric lighting
plant, capable of supplying energy to 1500 ten candle-power lamps was
installed here at a cost of £7OOO, the high-class hotels—of which there is
an unlimited choice-as well as many of the business houses, being
illuminated by the new light. Charters Towers is situated about 1 000 ft
above sea level, and consequently enjoys a most delightful climate ; the
warmth of the day being almost invariably succeeded by a balmy ’sea-
breeze, which seems doubly welcome in these high latitudes. The' water
supply is of the best; the reservoir capacity is 288,000 gallons, and the
cost of construction—including additions—was £76,719 (to end of 1895.)

The munieipality of Charters Towers contains an estimated population of
5 000 persons (December, 1895), and about 1,100 dwellings. Evidences
of cuiture exist m the educational, musical, and social organisations with
whmh the field abounds. Besides Public Schools there are eleven private
establishments and a School of Arts containing some 8,000 vol.
C urches of all denominations are numerous ; there are also a Masonic
a and Hospital, several societies for benevolent purposes, racing clubs
patriotic societies, &c., &c. Business houses and banks are numerous and
substantial; the medical and legal professions are also largely represented.
TOWNSVILLE.
f )ist ance by sea from Brisbane, about 750 miles. Saloon fare (single)
f Os Herewith will be found a map of this city of 11,000 inhabitants
(including census district-15,000) ; the seat of the Bishopric of North
Queensland, and commercial capital of the North. It is pleasantly situated
on the shores of Cleveland Bay, in full view of Magnetic Island, on the
eastern side of which is Horseshoe Bay—a much frequented picnic ground.
The Northern Supreme Court is situated here, and amongst other public
buildings may be mentioned the Post and Telegraph Offices-a fine solid
ock of buildings, surmounted by a clock tower ; a Lands Office, Town
Hall, Divisional Board Hall, Custom House, Court House, Gaol, &c •
a Police Barracks, Titles’ Office, Hospital, Powder Magazine, Drill
eds, &c. New Market Buildings of a substantial nature are about to be
erected. Local seaport trade is very extensive, and the buildings of many
banking and mercantile houses are very fine. The streets of the city are
well laid out and kept, vehicles of every description ply for hire in the
streets, whilst regular lines of omnibuses go to and fro between Townsville
and the suburbs ; and, although the temperature during much of the year
is ot m the heart of the town, residence on the sea-front (but 100 yards
distant) is delightful. Cleveland Bay contributed during the half-year
ended on 31st December, 1896, the substantial sum of £107,837 in Customs
duties, being second in this respect only to the port of Brisbane. The
imports and exports in 1896 were respectively £722,991 and £1 897 502
The shipping for the year was 327,711 tons inwards, and 345,433 tons’out-
wards The port of Townsville is constantly undergoing improvements,
and at considerable expense. The jetty has cost nearly £150,000, whilst
the total expenditure on the harbour amounts to nearly double that sum
-an outlay, however, which seems fully justified by the importance of its
maritime trade. Townsville is practically the sole outlet for an enormous
area of mineral, pastoral, and agricultural country. Under the first head
may be mentioned the rich goldfields of Charters Towers, Rav.enswood,
and Cape River; patches of agricultural land are to be found all over the
istnct, although the latter is pre-eminently suited to grazing—some of
the frozen meat recently shipped from Townsville off this country having

given the greatest satisfaction on arrival in London, where it realised |ff.
to £d. per lb. above ordinary prices. The educational standard amongst
the residents is high, their being (amongst other agencies) a fine Grammar
School, erected at a cost of over £BOOO, several private and State schools,
a School of Arts, possessing 3000 volumes odd, and three newspapers of
considerable literary ability—the Bulletin, Star, and Herald. Of benevo-
lent institutions there are a State Orphanage and the Benevolent Society,
besides which there is a Reception House for Lunatics. The most
luxurious accommodation is found at several of the residential hotels,
gas is used throughout the town, and public gardens have been laid out
or are planned—in every direction, over 150 acres being reserved for
this and recreation purposes within the city area ; whilst Castle Hill
towers proudly over the whole to a height of nearly 1,000 feet.
MACKAY.
500 to 540 miles north-west of Brisbane ; saloon steamship fare, £4
10s. single. This may be called the “ home of* sugar,” and as
such has an able champion in the Sugar Journal, which certainly ranks
amongst our leading papers, and is the best of its kind in the Colony.
Several references have already been made to the sugar growing industry
as carried on here ; but it should be added that the district is eminently
suited for many other crops—maize, potatoes, tobacco, spices, grapes, and
oranges having been grown successfully. The cultivation of mangoes is
quite a speciality of the place. The municipality of Mackay had, on the
31st December, 1895, an estimated population of 4,500 persons, with 879
dwellings, but, of course, the population of the district would be more
than double the above figures. The town itself (on the Pioneer river) is
well supplied with a number of good stores, drapers, &c. There are also
several branch banks for the transacting of general banking business, a
School of Arts (containing some 3,555 vols.), an Hospital, a Custom House,
Court House, Post and Telegraph Office, Police Station and other police
quarters. Amongst other institutions, there is a Chamber of Commerce,
for the safeguarding of trade, and also a Benevolent Society. Literature
is abundantly supplied by the Mercury, Standard, and Chronicle—news-
papers which have all contributed to the former prosperity of the town—
as well as by other publications supplied by the numerous booksellers.
The medical and legal professions are both represented ; there are also a
couple of chemists in the town. Some attention has always been paid to
cattle raising, and not long ago it was decided to form a company for the
purpose of erecting meat works—a step which would be a great boon to
the district. Another industry which promises to take an important
position is Coffee growing, now being engaged in on a commercial scale
by a company having offices in the metropolis. The exports from this
port during 1896 were valued at £168.891 (being £89,748 above the


imports for that period), of which £155,869 was attributed to sugar, and
£9,541 to meat products. Several of the large central, and some of the
“ guarantee ” sugar mills are situated on the outskirts of Mackay, there
being also a number of smaller private concerns. About 100 miles to the
North is the rapidl) rising Proserpine district, which has elsewhere been
alluded to as possessing a large mill, erected with the assistance of the
Government. The soil is most exceptionally fertile, yielding something
like 30 tons of cane to the acre. Most of the institutions of primitive
civilisation are found here, viz., two storekeepers, a butcher’s shop, a baker,
two sawmills, a blacksmith, an hotel, a school, post office and police
station, not forgetting telephonic communication with the neighbouring
Bloomsbury Telegraph Office. About 8 miles west of the Proserpine lies
the Conway village settlement, whilst small alluvial miner’s camps exist
at Kelsey Creek (6 miles from the mill) and Happy Valley (about 17 miles
distant). Of pleasure resorts there are many near Mackay. Amongst
these may be mentioned Eimeo, and most of the eminences which are
found here. Perhaps one of the finest—though not well-known—places
for a day’s enjoyment is Mt. Oscar; which, although a private property,
is accessible to visitors requesting permission to avail themselves of the
panoramic views which are obtainable from this eminence.
The stability of Mackay is demonstrated by the fact that, in face of
the most disheartening circumstances, the cane farmers have been able to
hold their own, and a most progressive spirit has been apparent all
through-. As an instance of the latter it may be mentioned that steps are
being taken by the town residents to establish a telephone exchange, and
already a large number of subscribers have been secured. Turf, bicycle,
and rifle clubs afford many opportunities for recreation ; Masonic and
other lodges are numerous ; whilst industrial interests are looked after by
the Agricultural, Pastoral, and Mining Association, and the Pioneer
River Farmers' Association. Of scholastic establishments there is
sufficient variety for the most fastidious, these comprising three or four
State and five private schools, besides a high school.
CAIRNS.
Distance from Brisbane, 908 miles—Saloon steam fare, £6 10s. An
important shipping centre for the sugar and fruit growing industries, as
well as for the extensive gold product of the Hodgkinson, Muigrave, and
Russell River, and Herberton tin. The population of the municipality on
December 81st, 1895, was estimated at 2000 persons, and the dwellings
numbered 500. The wide streets, planted with trees, in which are found
representatives of all the principal trades and professions, afford a pleasing
surprise to the travellers on our coast. The chief of the many points of
interest round and about Cairns are, however, the Barron Falls—reached
by train in an hour and a quarter, at a cost of 2s. sd. Here, but nineteen


miles from town, is some of the grandest scenery in the Southern Hemis-
phere, and if viewed during the rainy season the sight of the main falls is
truly awe-inspiring. The rainfall being heavy in this portion of Queens-
land, the vegetation is most luxuriant, and many a pretty spot is met
with in the ( scrubs which stretch out on every hand. In some of this
country—between 18 and 25 miles from the coast—are a group of beautiful
pieces of water, of which the chief is Lake Eacham, and a visit to Cairns
would not be complete without seeing something of these charming places.
As has been said, the trade of the port is considerable. During 1896 the
tonnage of inward shipping was 208,927—and of outward—l 93,944 tons.
The Customs duties collected during the second half of 1896 amounted to
£13,454 —a slight advance on 1895. The press champions of Cairns are
the Argus and the Post. At the present time the Cairns-Herberton railway
extends only to Mareeba (46 miles), but when completed, a large accession
of traffic and trade may be looked for at the port of this productive
region.
Herberton, as has already been remarked, is an extensive tableland,
of which the climate is superb, and the mineral and agricultural wealth
is stupendous. The thirty-five miles between the terminus of the railway
line and this mining centre is now traversed twice a week by coach, of
which the fare is 20s. Herberton is duly represented by the Wild River
Times, and much information which has of necessity been omitted in these
pages may be obtained from this valuable periodical. Too much could
scarcely be said of the productiveness of the district, but the following
description of a giant tree of the “ficus” tribe must suffice :—The girth,
about sft. from the ground, is 158 feet, and inside of the tree is a hollow
fifteen Jeet in diameter. Travellers who desire to see this remarkable
specimen of tropical growth will find it on Mr. Albert S. Aplin’s
selection, twelve miles north of Herberton, and close to the townships
of Atherton and Carrington.
NORMANTON.
Distance from Brisbane—l94B miles. Saloon fare, £l2. Geographi-
cally considered, this is a most important port, and, as has been
repeatedly stated, there is little doubt that in this town of 800
inhabitants and about 166 dwellings, there are the makings of
a large commercial centre. When it is borne in mind that
Normanton is virtually the only outlet for the Croydon, Etheridge,
Gilbert, Woolgar, and Cloncurry gold-fields, and that in addition
to these, the country which could be tapped by a railway system
contains almost unlimited wealth in other directions—pastoral and mineral
—there would seem to be every justification for the early construction of
more lines of railway. Notwithstanding present drawbacks, the exports
for 1896 reached close on £250,000, in which gold figured conspicuously,


the next item in importance being meat-products. Last year’s outward and
inward shipping tonnage aggregated about 76,680 tons, and the customs
collection reached £14,2,58 for the latter half of 1896. Normanton,
although somewhat depleted of its former population in favour of the rich
gold mines of Croydon, is not without its attractions. The town is well
situated, and besides the Government buildings, stores, &c., there is a
School of Arts, which contains 10'57 volumes, and was erected at a cost of
£2OOO. CROYDON—94 miles distant —is reached by rail in 5£ hours, at
a cost of 10s. lOd. The population of the latter municipality in 1895 was
1767 persons, and the number of dwellings was 700, but recent develope-
ments of the mines have had the effect of largely increasing the population.
Both Normanton and Croydon have their own Press, the latter town—as
its size demands —supporting two vigorous papers, the Golden Age, and
Mining News. Normanton can only boast of one newspaper—the
Chronicle —a publication, however, which has always worked faithfully for
its constituents.
COOKTOWN.
Distance from Brisbane, 1008 mile—Fare, £7 10s. Although popu-
lated by only 2000 or 8000 persons (within the municipality) this port has
occupied no mean place in the history of the colony. The value of out-
ward and inward shipping during 1896 was over £155,000, of which an
export of £63,000 worth of gold formed the most important item. Next to
this is the export of tin from the Annan River and Mount Windsor, which
was valued at £9568 ; an industry which would be far more largely engaged
in were the price to offer greeter inducements. The town occupies a
prominent position at the mouth of the Endeavour River, and is surrounded
by many beautiful sketches of country and places of interest. The build-
ings number under 1000, but the position of the town as the port of the
Palmer, Limestone, and Coen goldfields, and the rich agricultural lands
around it, combine to make it a place of present commercial importance,
and of great promise in the future. Besides three excellent newspapers,
the Independent, the Courier, and the Endeavour Beacon, Cooktown
possessas the advantage of a fine School of Arts, containing some 1834
vols- (December, 1895), State and denominational (R.C.) schools, several
societies for the advancement of eommercial, agricultural, and social
objects; a Fire Brigade, Hospital, churches of the Roman Catholic,
Church of England, and other denominations, Banks, &c. All the trades
are numerously represented, as aie also the medical and legal professions.
Besides the gold and tin fields alluded to, much trade finds its way here
from the Mitchell River antimony fields, and the Chillagoe and Ashtonville
silver and lead mines. The local beche-de-mer and pearlshell fisheries are
also a source of wealth to the district, which has lately come greatly into
prominence owing to the rush of mines to the goldfields of New Guinea—
for which this is the port of departure.

QUEENSLAND INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION
1891




PART V.
Queensland International Exhibition, 1897.
The buildings comprising the above, of which we present a ground
plan to our readers, occupy some 7 acres, and contain a display of home
and intercolonial treasures, such as would do no discredit to any of
the British colonies. The space occupied by exhibits amounts to about
150,000 square feet.
The Exhibition is readily accessible from all parts of the metropolis
by road or rail. Trams and omnibuses pass the door at frequent intervals,
whilst cabs ply for hire at all hours to and from the city.
Entering from Gregory Terrace the visitor is confronted by a
handsome brick building of substantial dimensions. Here are the Mining
Exhibits, Fine Art Galleries, and Concert Hall. Facing the turnstiles is
the grand entrance, where are displayed the mineral treasures of the
colony. As viewed on entering, the place presents a most imposing
spectacle ; on either side are a number of gilded obelisks—ranging in
t eight from 30ft. 6in. down to Bft.—representing in cubic measurement
ie output of the several goldfields of the Colony. Almost in the centre
f the building immediately opposite to the door are two enormous
gilded pillars 35 feet in height, representative of the total output of
Queensland gold fields, which form a most striking comment on the value
of our mineral resources. Bound the walls of this section a number
of maps—geological, mineral, and outline—are suspended, the whole
being capped by an enormous map of the colony, specially prepared for
the occasion by the Surveyor-General. The dimensions of the above are
40 ft. by 29 ft., and a special staging of considerable proportions has been
erected for its reception, thus constituting a most instructive phase
of the Exhibition. Ranged on either side, outside of the obelisks, are a
number of show cases containing the most varied assortment of mineral
products, besides which there are a number of £ ton samples from all
the principal mining centres of the colony. The names of the latter
are borne by a number of flags hanging on either side, whilst the large
centre octagon contains the pick of our mineral wealth. Most of the
wealthy gold mines on Gympie, Charters Towers, Croydon, etc., are here
represented, and afford an excellent object lesson to those hitherto
unacquainted with this source of our national prosperity.
Beyond the Mining section, and through the curtained entrances, are
the Fine Arts Exhibits. European, Australasian and Queensland art are


here in full force; as, however, no description of treasures would
serve any useful purpose, it will suffice to say that they are dis-
played in four distinct courts, devoted respectively to Queensland,
British, Australian and Foreign exhibits. In addition to an entrance
to the Concert Hall, on the ground floor are situated the various
offices of the Exhibition Co., etc. At the foot of the staircase, left
THOS. FINNEY, ESQ., M.L.A.,
Chairmun of the Loard o Directors o the International Exhibition Company
hand side—-and within the main entrance —is the cloak room, whilst on
the same side of the hall are sitaated offices for H.M. Customs, the
Secretary to the Exhibition, and the Press and jury. The offices
of the Board of Birectors, and the General Manager face those


of the Customs. Admission to the Bush-house, and thence to the Annexes
constituting the main portion of the Exhibition—may be obtained either
from a doorway at the foot of the stairs at the Grand Entrance, or through
glass doors opening out on to the verandah. The view presented from the
latter is well calculated to make visitors from other lands express
astonishment at the beauties of nature which we can command, and to
give to the resident a more vivid idea than ever before of the unequalled
luxuriance of our scrubs. The bush-house proper is lighted most
effectively by some sixty incandescent electric lamps, and gravelled paths
—flanked with grottoes, ferneries, fountains, and even a waterfall—afford a
pleasant retreat from the more noisy buildings. In the construction of
this miniature fairyland, our native vegetation has been largely drawn
upon, in addition to many of the rarest exotics with which our
Acclimatisation Gardens are stocked; whilst the greatest care has been
exercised in providing adequate seating accommodation.
Undoubtedly, however, the most unique feature of this portion of the
Exhibition is the Octagon, representative of our native timbers and the
weapons of the aborigines of the colony. Viewed from the Grand Stair-
case. by which the visitor descends from the Mining Exhibits, a beautiful
expanse of green foliage meets the eye on the right hand, whilst to the left
and on the way to the annexes—is the substantial erection just spoken
of. The exterior of the latter—comprising diagonal and other panelling,
treated with a variety of ornamental barks (such as “ stringy,” “tea tree,”
“hoop pine,” and “ iron bark”), and outlined by light coloured tea tree
saplings—conveys, in attractive form, an idea of some of our best known
trees whilst the interior is a marvel of constructive ability.
The Dado is composed of red and black stringy bark, surmounted
by a rail of hoop pine. The Panels are of smooth and rough stringy
bark, alternating with hoop pine, and set off with panels of tea-tree
(Melaleuca Uucadendron ); the corners and angles being treated with
hoop pine saplings—quartered or halved (as necessary). The Lower
Ceiling consists of alternate oblong and triangular panels of tea-tree and
hoop pine. The Hips are partly exposed ; with tea tree sill to Lantern
Lights. The Mullions of lanterns are formed of tea-tree, with upper
cornice of same and hoop pine. The Lantern Ceiling is of stringy bark,
whilst stretching from this to the ground is a central column, treated
with hoop pine, and quartrefoil ornaments, with spars of the above.
The whole is decorated with magnificent trophies of native weapons, and
lighted by one of the powerful arc lamps of the Brush Electrical Company
(of which there are no less than forty distributed throughout the
Exhibition.) Passing through the neck of the Octagon, which is taste-
fully arranged—in accordance with the foregoing—the visitor enters the
principal avenue, known as Queen’s Avenue. Here are the Exhibition


Mint, the exhibits of many of our leading Manufacturers and Merchants,
the British section, a raised bandstand (at the intersection with
Normanby’s Avenue), &c., &c.; perhaps the most striking item being a
life-size figure of a knight in armour, seated on his war horse : the whole
of local design and workmanship. Parallel with this avenue are five
others ; the first on the left being named after Lord Lamington, and
the second after the late Sir Anthony *Musgrave (a former Governor of
Queensland); those on the right are also named—commencing with
the nearest —after ex-Governor General Sir Henry Wylie Norman,
Governor Cairns, and Sir A. E. Kennedy. At right angles to these are
a number of smaller avenues, named respectively “ O’Connell’s,”
“Palmer’s,” “Bell’s,” “Normanby’s,” “ Blackall’s,” and “Bowen’s.”
The most elaborate arrangements have been made for the safety of
exhibits, and the convenience and comfort of visitors. Refreshment
rooms of ample dimensions, the management of which offer an excellent
“ menu” at reasonable prices ; lavatories for ladies, and gentlemen; tea
rooms and gardens ; etc. etc., combine to make a visit all that could
be desired.
At the lower end of the Queen’s Avenue, entrance is obtained to the
grounds of the National Agricultural and Industrial Association, in which
a variety of shows and sports will take place during the course of the
Exhibition, to culminate in the annual show of Live Stock and Pas-
toral Products about the beginning of August next. At the present time
a considerable portion of this ground is occupied by every variety of side
show : —Shooting galleries, cinematographs, palmistry, wax works, merry-
go-rounds, &c. The lighting is effected by two powerful arc lamps,
supplied by the electrical contractors. The latter have no less than four
large dynamos at work.
Special railway arrangements have been made, by which tickets
to the Exhibition, including return railway fare are issued from Central
(Ann-street) and intermediate stations for the sum of Is. Bd. Trains
leave the Central station every half hour, commencing at 9 a.m.; the last
train returning from the Exhibition Station at 5.45 p.m.

PART VI.
Commercial and Social Conditions, &c., &c.
SHIPPING in Queensland holds no mean place, and indeed we may
be said to be a close competitor with the Southern Colonies and New Zea-
land. Age being taken into consideration, the extension of these interests
is marvellous, a result mainly due to the great facilities offered by a very
large number of ports. It will thus be seen that as a colony we have both
the natural wealth, and facilities for the shipment of that wealth, which
go to make great nations, and although the present direct tonnage entered
and cleared at our ports is but small compared with that of our neighbours,
it needs no special gift of prophecy to foretell an enormous oversea traffic
in the near future. The latest returns (1896) give the shipping trade of
Brisbane as £5,198,644 ; Rockhampton, £2,975,524 ; and Townsville,
£2,620,498. Five other ports have a trade of over £200,000, five exceed
£IOO,OOO, and two exceed £20,000 per annum. Two of the most note-
worthy—although not the busiest —ports of Queensland are those of
Gladstone and Bowen. The former is a natural harbour of extreme
beauty and exceptional capacity, likely in the near future to become one
of great importance. Already important meat-shipping interests are
centred at this port, which is now in direct communication with the old
world by means of a frequent service of magnificent meat-carrying-
steamers. Bowen is equally capable of berthing vessels of 9000 and
10,000 tons register, although not possessing quite so many natural
advantages as the first-mentioned port. According to Captain Williams,
of the “ Denton Grange,” when speaking on this subject, it is only
requisite that about 200 yards of dredging be effected to make the port of
Bowen “ second to none in Australia.” In his case he stated that he had
had no difficulty whatever in bringing his capacious vessel alongside the
wharf. It may be mentioned that a comparison of the total trade in
1895 shows that the value per ton of total shipping in Queensland was
more than double that of New South Wales and Victoria, three times
that of South Australia, and from four to six times that of Western
Australia.
The HISTORY of QUEENSLAND has been written, and re-written,
and therefore does not find a place in these pages. Law and order prevail
over the length and breadth of the land ; the DEFENCE of the Colony on
land is entrusted to a fine body of Police, and to a Defence Force, number-
ing (in 1895) 2769 officers and men, besides mounted infantry, and a large
force of volunteers. At sea, the Colony enjoys the protection of a pan-


Colonial squadron, and for active service a marine force of 800 to 400 men
is a\ ailable. The vulnerable points on our coast and strategic positions
have been fortified at heavy expense, and are considered to be fairly im-
pregnable. FINANCE, ACCUMULATION, and the CONSTITUTION
have been so ably dealt with by other writers, notably, by Thornhill
Weedon, Esq., of the Statistical Department, that it is unnecessary to
touch on these subjects in a work of so limited a size as the present.
The RAILM A\ S of this Colony constitute a most important factor in
her past and future growth. At the present time about 2390 miles of
railway are completed, 232 miles of new lines are authorized or under
construction, and the building of others is under consideration. Although
of no great length, in comparison with the large area to be served, our
railway system is far more extensive in relation to population than are
those of New South Wales, \ ictoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and New
Zealand. The Railway policy of the various Ministries has generally been
of a most liberal nature, a course of action which proves to have been
fully justified, in view of the fact that even at this early stage of our history,
several of our lines are able to pay the interest on capital without difficulty,
whilst others contribute the bulk of that interest. On the whole it may be
said that our railways, as at present managed, are in a very satisfactory
condition, it being always necessary to bear in mind that the primary
object with which State Railways are constructed is the development of
otherwise inaccessible resources—not the payment of dividends on capital
expenditure. A noticeable feature in Queensland Railways has been the
adoption of a narrow gauge (Bft. 6in.), thus materially reducing the cost of
construction and maintenance, and giving a promise of earlier return for
the outlay. From the report of the Commissioner for Railways (1896)
it is seen that the cost per mile of railway open in Queensland is £7,024,
being lower than that of South Australia, New Zealand, or Victoria,
less than half that of the New South Wales system, and somewhat over
one-seventh of the cost in the United Kingdom. Further, it is remark-
able that whilst Queensland has little more than one-tenth of the popula-
tion per mile of railway, one-eightieth of the train miles run, and a higher
percentage of working expenses to earnings than the United Kingdom,
the earnings per head of population for the year ending June 30th, 1896,
were better than those for the United Kingdom, and second—amongst the
colonies—only to South Australia. Reviewing the history of our railways
since 1865, we find that in many respects the financial year ending 30th
June last, exhibited a marked improvement over its predecessors. The
tonnage of goods and minerals carried was 1,026,889 ; the highest on
record—having nearly doubled in the decade. The number of train miles
run was 4,744,733 —also an advance on all previous records, and nearly
double that of 1885. The reduction effected in cost per train mile is very


satisfactory, the cost having been 4s. lfd. in 1876 (earliest recorded), and
only 2s. in 1895-6 (the lowest on record), or a percentage of working
expenses to gross earnings of 59-36 —a lower percentage than either
Victoria or New Zealand, although higher by 3-37% than the latest avail-
able figures for the United Kingdom (31st December, 1894). As the
present working expenses per train mile are already lower than those
incurred in the United Kingdom, it is apparent that a comparatively slight
increase in gross earnings will make our railway system one of the most
cheaply worked—and consequently best paying—systems in the world.
The railway traffic earnings for March, 1897, compared with those of
March, 1896, show a net increase of £5,758. Another pleasing feature of
our railways is the encouragement afforded by the Administration to local
engineers in the acceptance given to tenders for the construction in
Queensland of 30 heavy goods locomotives (at £2,390 each) in addition to
numbers of hopper waggons, insulated waggons, firewood waggons,
open goods waggons, &c., all of which are the means of providing a good
deal of work for the iron and timber trades.
The Postal and Telegraphic business of Queensland is efficiently
conducted by means of some 391 Post Offices, 642 Receiving Offices,
112 Money Order Offices, 1,139 Private Lock-boxes, 178 Letter Receivers,
366 Telegraph Stations ; and Telephone Exchanges at Brisbane, Charters
Towers, and Townsville, with others in course of construction at date
of last official report (December, 1895.) The length of mail routes at
that date was 29,507 miles, and the length of telegraph wires in July,
1896 — miles. The whole is controlled from the General Post
Office, Brisbane, at which there is a considerable staff under the direction
of the Postmaster-General. The latter gentleman is also charged with
the oversight of the Meteorological Department, ably managed by one
of the foremost scientists of the day—Clement L. Wragge, Esq., F.R.G.S.
F.R. Met. Soc., etc. The staff of the entire department comprises some
92 letter carriers, and about 1,000 other officials, and the total combined
revenue for 1895 was £234,693 —-an increase on 1894 of £19,079,
that derived from postal sources only, being the largest ever obtained in
this colony. Some interesting calculations are made in “ Queensland
Past and Present” as to the relative letter-writing capacities of the
various colonies, and Great Britain, together with a mass of other
information, to which the enquirer is referred.
SOCIAL CONDITIONS # are similar to those obtaining in other
English speaking lands. State Schools are liberally provided for the free
education of the young, and new “ provisional” schools can be obtained
at any place where there are 30 or 40 children with which to form a
nucleus. Grammar Schools for both sexes, and a large number of
private schools, are found in all the larger towns. Ninety scholarships for
boys, and thirty for girls are annually competed for by State School


children, entitling the successful candidates to three years’ free education in
a Grammar School. There are also three exhibitions—each of the value of
£IOO per annum—annually offered to students under 19 years of age who
desire a University education. The numerous religious bodies have equal
rights—there being no established church in the colony. Incidentally,
many of the districts over which ministers of religion have charge are very
large—notably some of the Western Roman Catholic Dioceses, and that of
the Anglican Bishop of Brisbane, whose jurisdiction extends over 209,278
square miles, having a population of 304,072 persons! The latter
denomination predominates by a large number.
In addition to the educational advantages provided by the schools,
nineteen Technical Colleges—either separate institutions or in conjunction
with Schools of Art—are devoted to providing instruction in Trades,
Art, and Commerce, and with this object have received State endowments,
varying from £ 100 (as at Zillmere) to £IOOO in the case of the Brisbane
College. Over £SOOO has thus been spent in endowments, besides annual
grants, which amounted to some £2404 during the two last financial
years.
Museums have also been founded in Brisbane by the Government for
the enlightenment of those who wish to become acquainted with the
Geology and other branches of the Natural History of the Colony, or with
the associations connected with its past and present history. There are
numerous scientific, musical, and literary societies, many of these being
affiliated with the parent societies in Europe. Amongst these may be
mentioned the Royal Society of Queensland, the Royal Geographical
Society of Australasia (Queensland branch), the Literary Circle, various
Chess Clubs, the Brisbane Draughts Club, the Brisbane Musical Union,
the Brisbane Liedertafel, the Cambrian Choir, Choral Union, Queensland
Shorthand Writers’ Association, Amateur Photographic Society, several
Amateur Theatrical and Parliamentary Debating Societies, &c., &c. In
connection with these and kindred associations, many most delightful
gatherings take place, while social life has all the amenities—if it does
not always possess the “ haut ton”—of the older countries of the world.
“At homes” and “ Cinderellas,” musical evenings, and garden parties
are as often brought into requisition to promote sociability as is the case
in other lands. Other organisations existing for this end are the clubs,
of which there are several in the Capital—some of them magnificently
appointed. Foremost amongst these may be mentioned the Queensland
Club, having a membership of close on 300 ; the Commercial Travellers’
Club, in Queen-street, is also a well-appointed and convenient rendezvous
for members and their business friends. Besides these there are the
Johnsonian Club, Londoner’s Club, Burns and Caledonian Club, &c.
The aged, the infirm, and those of unsound mind are amply cared for by


'Government, and private benevolence. An Industrial Home is open to the
Blind, and Deaf and Dumb ; Reformatories and Industrial Homes are pro-
vided for the neglected youth of both sexes ; in addition to some eight asy-
lums for orphan children. Friendly Societies minister to the wants of sick
members and their families, and so popular are these institutions that in
1895 the figures were —members 19,636, lodges 282; as compared with a
membership of 12,301, with 163 lodges and districts, in 1887. Prominent
amongst the Charitable Institutions of Queensland are the Masonic Lodges,
of which there are over one hundred situated in various parts of the Colony.
The Grand Lodge under each of the three constitutions is in Brisbane.
In the interests of breeders, farmers, and fanciers, we have the
Queensland Stockbreeders’ and Graziers’ Association, the National Agri-
cultural and Industrial Association, the Dog and Poultry Society, the
Fruitgrowers Association, Royal Agricultural Society (Toowoomba), and a
number of other metropolitan and provincial farmers’ associations, agricul-
tural societies, &c. All these have lately been centred in a Parliamentary
Committee, styled the “ Farmers Union,” and some good work has been
accomplished. One of the most notable developments in connection with
matters agricultural has been the establishment of the first of our colleges
for training young men in farm practice and science. This has been called
the Queensland Agricultural College. The time of the student is here
equally divided between labour in the field and in the class room. Every
student participates in all the operations of a well conducted farm, while
■competent teachers instruct the pupils in the “why and the wherefore ”
of farm practices. The present partial equipment of the College em-
braces : —a farm of 1692 acres ; three domitories and dining hall for 56
students; the main College building, 70ft. by 112 ft., containing lecture
rooms, library and rooms for study; and a very full assortment of the most
modern tools and implements. To these, new farm buildings, books, ap-
paratus, stock and implements are being constantly added. The College
year begins July Ist, 1897. Terms : —£2s per College year for board,
washing, lights, and rooms partially furnished. It may be mentioned that
the foundation of an excellent herd of cattle has been laid at this College
by the importation of ten of the best pedigree beasts obtainable in
Victoria.
PHYSICAL RECREATION is abundantly provided by clubs for
Lawn Tennis, Cricket, Football, Golf, Rowing, Sailing, Rifle practice,
Cycling, Bowling, Lacrosse, Poto, Gymnastics, &c.; and regular “meets”
of the hounds. Race meetings constitute another form of sport, which is,
perhaps, more largely engaged in than any other, and numbers of these
are held in almost every town aud township throughout the Colony, under
the auspices of the various racing associations.


Queensland’s Wealth of Territory.
As might be expected in so extensive a country as Queensland, a far
better chance exists here for men to acquire land than is the case, say, in
Great Britain—or even in the Southern Colonies of Australia. Enormous
tracts of the most fertile soil can be purchased from the State or private
owners at a mere fraction of the price such would realize in many another
land, whilst so vast is our heritage that, at present, only about one-
twenty-ninth part of the area of the colony, or 14,557,565 acres (31st
December, 1896), has been, or is in course of being alienated ; in addition
to some 272,440,960 acres held under lease or license.
The land laws of Queensland, which are already amongst the most,
liberal in the world, are constantly being improved and amended to suit
the changing conditions of the times ; and under these, the freehold of a
farm may be obtained on certain conditions at as low a price as 2s. 6d.
per acre, whilst cleared and cultivated freehold selections are often offered
privately at 15s. to 20s. per acre, with rough dwelling house and all
improvements thrown in.
Our Animal World.
In common with most countries which enjoy so favorable a climate
as Queensland, the earth, water, and air teem with animal life in their
most varied forms. At the same time, there is no continent in the world
enjoying a greater immunity from animals which endanger life than does
the continent of which Queensland forms a part. The worst our colony
produces on land are the snakes and alligators, and amongst the inhabi-
tants of our waters sharks are about the only ones to be avoided. Indeed,
with ordinary precautions, nothing need be feared from any of these.

throughout the Colony observe weekly half-holidays—of which a
