tralians were fond of “ Blowing,” alias “ Gassing,” Egotism
or “ Ta’l”.Talk, Well, perhaps so; but at all {events they
have also proved themselves able to “do ” something else
but “Talk’“ ori Blow,” and when we say—yes, and say it
with a “ Loud Voice ” —that our

“ Blow,” but simply stating an irreproachable, undeniable,

Australia, and that the few stray aborig-
inals to be found near telegraph lines
never dream even remotely of touching
the wires. The remainder of the state-
ment is quite correct, that is, if there is
any remainder. i

ANOTHER VICTORY OVER HYDATIDS.
Forsyth Street, Sand Hill, Wagga Wagga, X3th March, 1900.
I feel it mv duty to testify to the wonderful cure of Hydatids that has been effected in my own case by the
u*e of WEBBER’S YIXADATIO. I have suffered for the PAST SIX (6) FEARS from HYDATIDS ON
THE LUNG, and during that time I HAD SEVERAL SEVERE HEMORRHAGES, my life at times was des-
paired of, and twice the Sacrament was administered to me by our minister (Rev. G. A. Carver). Life in itself
was simplf a burden. I was attended to by doctors in Wagga and Sydney, who were very kind, and did all
in their power to alleviate my suffering. AFTER USING THE VITADATIO THE HYDATiD AND CYSTS
WERE EXPELLED FROM MY BODY, and I am thankful to say I have been restored to HEALTH and
STRENGTH SOLELY BY THE USE OF WEBBER’S VITADATIO. I am willing that you should use this
in any .way you choose, hoping it may be the means of leading other poor sufferers to try Webber’s
renowned Vitadatio. Yours respectfully,
Witness-W. J. FIST. (Mrs.) H. A. RUDD.
The facts of Mrs. Rudd’s illness are to my knowledge, exactly as she states, although I know nothing of the
nature of the disease or its symptoms, but she certainly is now well and strong. (Signed)
GEO. A. CARVER, Incumbent St. John’s, Wagga.
We, the undereigned.'know that Mrs. Rudd suffered as stated above, and we supplied Webber’s Vitadatio
to her. ’ (Signed) T. DOBNEY and CO., Storekeepers.
LIVER COMPLAINT.
Josbph Hopkins, Longford, Tasmania, June, 1899.
Mr. W. WEBBER.
Sir,— l was very much troubled with Liver Complaint, and after taking three bottles of your Vitadati I
•was a different man. I highly recommend it to anyone suffering from the same complaint.
Yours truly, JOSEPH HOPKINS, Longford, Tasmania.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
Shakespeare, who had the richest
vocabulary used by any Englishman,
employed ' only 16,000 words. Milton
could pick out from 8,000, but the aver-
age man, a graduate from one of the
great mn ndties, rarely has a vocabulary
of me m<m 3000 or 4000 words. The
ordinary person can get along comfortably
.vitfTS oo wordsTa
a knowledge of 200 words is sufficient to
carry a man through his life. This of

If a man wants to read newspapers and

“I’ve just made a bet of five dollars on you."
“On rue ? What is it T”
“ I’ve bet five dollars that you will suicide
within a week. I’ve been watching you very
closely for the last half hour, and all signs in-
dicate melancholy and despondency. Have you

poison, the rope, drowning or hanging ? ”
“ Did you actually bet five dollars t ” an
xioualy asked the young man.
“I did.”

"I’ll have to.”

A new story was afloat on Prince Russell
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
night, and is credited to W. W. Dudley.
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe. On the way over told his
fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England?”
“Well,” said the Prince, “It’s this way;
If the Prince of Wales should go to
America and pass through Washington
without stopping to call on father, we’d
think it darned queer, an’ so I thought
I’d stop over here a few days and pay my
respects to the Queen.” —“New York Star.’
Story or a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wife
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony If
t could berg* iniarily. 1
her diamond ncCiiiaCe to a worid-reßowned ’
establishment, she asked for bow much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “high
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball. Sitting in her box, resplendent
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reportprial description the following day
in the chief paper of the city.—“ New
York Press.”
