doctors gave him opening medicine, it killed'him.

Pity the poor printer 1 Whenever a
mistake occurs in the press, how easy it
is to pass it off as “ a printer’s error.”
Are not the contributors occasionally at
fault? Is their handwriting always of
thb copper plate character p In a colonial
jom’nal recently appeared the following :
—“There need be demand no longer for
Jules "Verne's and other blackguards’
works of imagination.” In a subsequent
issue it was pointed out that “other
blackguards’ ” should read “ Rider Hag-
gard’s.” Perhaps the printer’s reader
and the sub-editor were alike at fault
here. '
There was a young lady at Summer Hill,
With influenza was taken very ill.
She sent for the Doctor, a neat little dandy,
And he cured her at once with Trescott’s Squill
Candy.
“ I felt so nervous, mamma,” said a
little girl the other day, referring to an
accident which had happened. “ What
do you mean by being ‘ nervous ’ m
dear ?” “ Why, mamma, it’s just being
a hurry all over.”
One rough day in the bay, three boys in a boat
Got wrecked on a beach that was sandy.
They each caught a cold and had a sore throat,
And their motherscured them all with Trescott’s
Squill Candy.

DIGESTIVE

BLECKMAN'S DIGESTIVE TEA—This Tea
has been subjected to an ingenious process which
deprives it of the tannin which all Tea contains.
This principle is hurtful to the digestive organs.
It is found strongest in the inferior kinds of
Tea. Those who drink much tea sooner or
later have their stomachs coated with tannin,
which prevents those operations necessary to
the proper digestion of food, and leads to
nervous attacks and debility. Bi*ckman’s
Digestive Tea whilst preserving the wholesome
properties and aroma of good tea, has the
deleterious principle of tannin eliminated from
it, and we are glad to hear that it can now be
obtained from every Chemist.

Dr. WAUGH’S BAKING POWDER Beats all the Best
It is singular that laughter generally
proceeds from a mental cause, in most
instances without any corporeal influence,
and sometimes from an irritation of the
nerves wholly independent of mirth. Of
the former kind is the loud laugh of the
hysterical patient, and the convulsive one
in these paroxysms, sometimes induced by
the most distressing events. Of the second
is that produced by tickling; and, how-
ever singular it may appear, this has been
used in excess as a kind of torture to
induce confession.
Irate Old Gent, (to snoring inebriate)
“ Don’t you know if you kept your
mouth shut up you would make less
noise ?” Inebriate (drowsily)—“ So
would you.”
Consumption is most common in Bel-
gium, Scotland and Canada.
No one can breathe at a greater height
than seven miles from the earth.
The yearly waste in the United States
through drink is at least 500,000,000 dol-
lars. In forty years 10,000,000,000 dollars
have been thus wasted. This is equal to
the whole savings of the people from 1783
to 1857.
There is a masher at Ashfield, who everyone
knows,
Rather tall, and nclined to be bandy.
He had a coed id is dose, chilblains on his toes,
And he fixed himself up with Trescott’s Squii
Candy
The general public are commencing to find out
the superior quality of Silyeesteeam Schnapps,
and sales are steadily increasing. The Agents,
Messes. Ttjckee & Co., one of the oldest and
most respected houses in the Wine and Spirit
trade, repeat that they are more than satisfied
at the strides these Schnapps are making in the
public favor. They feel confident that the
superior quality, and the fact that they are the
most costly Schnapps imported will tell in the
long run, and they fully anticipate that in the
near future Silyeesteeam Schnapps will be the
only Schnapps drank.
The late Mr. Cobdeu used to tell the
following anecdote:—“When in Amer-
ica,” said he, “ I asked an enthusiastic
American lady why her country could not
rest satisfied with the immense unoccupied
territories it already possessed, but must
be ever hankering after the laud of its
neighbours, when her somewhat remark-
able reply was — £ Oh, the propensity is
a very bad one, I admit; but we came
honestly by it, for we inherited it from
England.’”
Light is produced by the vibrations of
ether. When the number is less than
450 billions the eye cannot perceive any-
thing, for these vibrations only produce
heat; above that number, up to about
727 billions, the eye perceives red, yellow,
green and violet, which, united in the
light of the sun, gives the impression of
white. Above 727 billion vibrations per
second, the vibrations strike the retina
too quickly to produce the sensation of
color.
