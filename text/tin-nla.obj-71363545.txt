The story of the discovery of' tin ore in Queensland belongs to the
romance of mining. There is a heavy black metallic sand found in the
beds of many creeks, well known to diggers and often a great nuisance
to the alluvial gold miner because from its specific gravity it interferes
with the operation of washing. This sand, though metallic, was known
to contain only iron and other metals which were of little commercial
value. But there was a certain creek in the southern part of the
colony near the New South Wales border, where a peculiar looking
black sand was noticeable where the ordinary dray track crossed its
bed. For years the track was used, and of all the wayfarers that
crossed the creek not one thought of taking up a handful of the sand
to look at it more closely, or to see whether it differed in any respect
from that which was to be found in a hundred creek beds in the colony.
It was not till 1871 that a man, more observant or more curious than
usual, examined the sand, noticed* the peculiarity of its appearance,
and enquired what it contained. And then it transpired that another
valuable metal had been added to the list of available Queensland
products
The tin ? rnsh ? which created the thriving town of Stanthorpe
differed from a gold rush only in the manner in which the workings
were held; instead of mining ? claims? the country was taken up in
selections. The extremely liberal terms on which these selections were
granted facilitated speculation. An intending selector marked
off the boundaries of the piece he wanted by affixing notices to trees
at the four corners, and making the best of his way to the nearest office,
paid down five shillings per acre. The selection was conditionally
accepted, almost at once, and a title was issued which enabled the
holder to claim exclusive possession of the mineral in it. This title
became absolute on payment of 15s. more per acre, and proof that
mining improvements to the value of .�1 per acre had made, the


boundaries of the selections being of course subject to revision when
definitely surveyed and laid out by the Government officials. Naturally
there was a rush for tin selections. It was found that a great number
of alluvial flats contained tin ore, and the taking up of one selection
was the signal for speculators to surround it by a chessboard pattern
of holdings selected on the chance that the ore deposit might extend
through them too. The preliminary title, obtainable by the first pay-
ment of ss. was cheap, and held good for at least twelve months ; and
while the first excitement lasted, the fact that tin had actually been
found in a particular spot made every selection within miles of in
a saleable property, and while this species of gambling was going on
work progressed briskly on the fields. The ore?stream tin?was
found in several places in deposits some feet thick mixed with very little
extraneous matter, and was obtained by stripping the surface soil and
washing the ? dirt? in cradles after the fashion of alluvial mining Tin
was then selling at more than double its present price, and the ore,
washed cleaned, contained from GO per cent, upwards of the pure metal.
Consequently no great working capital was required. A miner with his
shovel and tin dish could wash out many pounds? weight daily of the
ore, which was bought on the spot by traders, bagged and despatched to
port, in the year following the first discovery, ore to the value of
�108,310 was exported, in 1873 the export had risen to �370,912.
But, as in other mining, it was soon found that these exceptional
deposits were rare. The amount of tin-hearing ground was certainly
very large, but the expenditure of much money and labour was needed
to utilise it. Superincumbent masses of barren earth had to be removed
and the deposit of wash dirt was sometimes thin, sometimes very much
intermixed with worthless stuff, The desultory digging out of patches
and rough washing was too wasteful a process to yield a profit unless in
exceptionally rich spots. Labour had to be organised and the deposit
attacked by opening wide excavations giving a large ? face ? on which
gangs of men working in unison could operate. An abundant supply
of water was needed for sluicing, and the natural supply was neither
large, permanent, nor conveniently situated, for many of the workings.
Capital was needed to put up dams,' pumping machinery, and many
other appliances. As time went on the fever of speculation died away.
Companies with inflated share lists, such as had been formed at the time
of copper speculation, collapsed, selections changed hands, and tin
mining developed from a speculation into an industry. As organisation
and capital were brought to bear upon it, the cost of raising the ore was
continually diminished, so that deposits which at first were neglected
were profitably worked, although the price of the metal steadily sank
until it was less than half of what it had been at first. Naturally,
however, the total output decreased in value. The export of tin?ore
and smelted ?sank from �358,550 in 1871 to �187,201 in 1876. And
then another misfortune fell on the tin fields. The great drought which
more or less afflicted all the colonies during the years of 1877 and 1878
told heavily on the Stanthofpe tin fields. Water, and plenty of it, is
an absolute necessity in working stream tin, and the rain during these


years fell only in showers. The waterholes, natural and artificial, dried up,,
mounds of stacked ? wash dirt ? lay idle and the miners were unable
to do anything-. In the year 1877 54 tin mines are recorded, and they
only raised 2,579 tons of ore, showing how restricted they had been
in their operations. And in 1878, the condition of the industry was
even worse.
However, the drought passed away and tin mining was again prose-
cuted with renewed vigour. In 1879, the value of this export reached
a sum of �120,351, although the price of the metal remained at less
than halt the sum per ton obtained when Stanthorpe was first
opened. And the export was swelled by contributions from another
quarter rf the colony. In the north, on a portion of the Palmer gold field,
stream tin had long been known to exist. But the deposits attracted
little attention. Gold miners seldom turn aside from the search for the
more precious metal, and in this case the distance from port gave little hope
of profit to those disposed to work the ore. However, the progressive ex-
haustion of the alluvial gold deposits of the Palmer induced individuals to
turn to the tin, and it has since been worked, although not on a large scale
But recent discoveries promise to make the far north an important tin
producing country. In the mountainous countries behind the little
seaport towns of Cairns and Port Douglas, south of Cooktown, some
very important tin discoveries have been made. Alluvial tin is being
worked at a place called Tinaroo ; but lately the attention of miners
has been strongly attracted to a stream known as the Wild River
where lodes have been formed, rich in metal, thick and apparently well
situated for working. If the accounts sent down from the Wild River,
are correct, tin mining in the north will not only be a very important
but a permanent industry. There are, apparently in the district, a good
many deposits of stream tin, and when these are exhausted, the
lodes will still continue to yield metal for an indefinite time. And
durum the month of August stream tin has also been discovered in the
Port Curtis district, near the port of Gladstone.
It is quite probable that there is a good deal of tin land yet
undiscovered in the north. The metal has been found at several widely
separated points in a country which has hardly been thoroughly ex-
plored, and has certainly not been searched for tin. Prospecting
parties of gold diggers have roamed loosely over it, but it has been
very imperfectly examined even for gold, and the tin discoveries have
almost been accidental. Besides, in the country to the south of the
Cook district, tin has been noticed, although the discoverers have made
no use of their find. As the country becomes more opened up, and
better roads made, it is quite possible that a number of tin mining
centres will be established, and that these will be a large annual
output of the metal. Tin is likely to remain an important item in
the exports of Queensland.
