INTRODUCTION
The spectacular development of aircraft as an
essential means of communication and transport
in our modern society has resulted in an ever
increasing demand for highly dependable and
sophisticated operational services to ensure the
safety and expedition of those who fly.
Flight Service Officers play an indispensable and
dynamic role in the provision of these services
upon which pilots, both commercial and private,
depend. Flight Service is a demanding and highly
skilled occupation in a career industry that is
unusual, exciting, challenging, and having
particular appeal to the aeronautically minded.
Because of its “behind-the-scenes” operation,
the average member of the public knows little of
the functions of a Flight Service Officer. What
does he do? Where are flight service units
established? What qualifications does a Flight
Service Officer need? How is he trained?
This pamphlet sets out to answer these and
related questions in order that those considering
a career in Flight Service may be better informed.
It is meant only as a guide. More detailed
information can be easily obtained from any of
the Department of Civil Aviation offices listed.


THE WORK
As a Flight Service Officer you will be
responsible for providing certain operational
services and facilities to aircraft operating in
uncontrolled airspace. These include Pilot
Briefing, Flight Information, and Search and
Rescue Alerting Services, together with the
provision of communications between aircraft
and ground units and the operation of radio
navigational aids. A Flight Service Officer
therefore is closely associated with the pilot in
using skills and in providing services essential
to the safety of an aircraft and its occupants.


METHOD OF ENTRY
The Department of Civil Aviation is seeking
young men of evident stability who are prepared
to accept responsibility and who are capable of
working accurately and decisively under the
pressures of a time paced work environment.
Selection is competitive following notification in
the Commonwealth Gazette and advertisements
in the press.
To assist selection a series of aptitude tests is
applied. These do not require specialised
knowledge.
Selection is based on an assessment of an
applicant’s aptitude, qualifications, experience
and personal suitability.
To qualify for selection a good level of secondary
education is required. A pass at Form 4 level (or
equivalent) or higher qualifications with passes in
subjects appropriate to the training course will
enhance prospects of selection.
Aeronautical telecommunications or aviation
experience is not essential but preference will be
given to applicants who have demonstrated
tangible interests or actual ability or experience
in these fields.
Successful applicants will be at least 19 and
under 37 years and must:
be able to communicate fluently and clearly in
English;
be willing to serve at any Flight Service Unit in
Australia or its Territories;
be a British Subject (by birth or naturalisation);
meet the prescribed medical standards.


TRAINING
Selectees will undertake a training course
consisting of about 22 weeks theoretical and
manipulative training, followed by about 20 weeks
practical field training at representative Flight
Service Units.
The training syllabus includes Operational
Procedures, Aeronautical Knowledge, Navigation,
Meteorology, Radio Aids to Navigation and Radar,
Communications Technology, Radio Telephony,
Wireless Telegraphy, Machine Telegraphy and
Touchtyping.


CAREER BENEFITS
A career as a Flight Service Officer offers many
advantages. Flight Service Officers have the
satisfaction of doing a job that is absorbing and
vitally important. They have the rewards of good
employment conditions and salaries which are
augmented by special allowances for shift work.
In addition there are recurring opportunities for
advancement. Promotion is by merit —seniority
is considered only in those few cases where men
are of equal efficiency. Opportunities exist for
those suitably qualified to train as Air Traffic
Controllers.
