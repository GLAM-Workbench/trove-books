Enclosure to No. 1 (B.)
My Lord, Washington, 9 June 1850,
I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of the instructions addressed
by the secretary of the United States navy to Lieutenant de Haven, the officer
in command of the expedition in search of Sir John Franklin, prior to the sail-
ing of that officer from this country.
I have, &c.
The Right Hon. (signed) H. L. Bulwer.
Viscount Palmerston, g. c. b.
&c, &c. &c.
Sub-Enclosure to No. 1 (B.)
United States Navy Department, Washington,
Sir, 15 May 1850.
Having been selected to command the expedition in search of Sir John
Franklin and his companions, you will take charge of the two brigantines, the
“ Advance” and the “ Rescue,” that have been fitted out for that service, and
as soon as you are ready proceed with them to sea, and make the best of your
way to Lancaster Sound.
These vessels have been furnished to the government for this service by the
munificence of a private citizen, Mr. Henry Grinnell of New York. You will
therefore be careful of them, that they may be returned to their owner in good,
condition. They have been provisioned for three years.
Passed Midshipman S. P. Griffin has been selected to command one of the
vessels, you will therefore consider him as your second in command. Confer
with him, and treat him accordingly.
The chief object of this expedition is to search for, and if found, afford relief
to, Sir John-Franklin of the Royal Navy, and his companions.
You will therefore use all diligence, and make every exertion to this end,
paying attention as you go to subjects of scientific inquiry, only so far as the
same may not interfere with the main object of the expedition.
Having passed Barrow Strait, you will turn your attention northward to Wel-
lington Channel, and westward to Cape Walker, and be governed by circum-
stances as to the course you will then take.
Accordingly


Accordingly you will exercise you own discretion after seeing the condition
of the ice, sea, and weather, whether the two vessels shall here separate, one for
Cape Walker, and the other for Wellington Strait, or whether they shall both
proceed together for the one place or the other.
Should you find it impossible on account of the ice to get through Barrow
Strait, you will then turn your attention to Jones’s Sound and Smith’s Sound.
Finding these closed or impracticable, and failing of all traces of the missing
expedition, the season will probably then be too far advanced for any other
attempts. If so, you will return to New York.
Acquaint passed Midshipman Griffin before sailing, and from time to time
during the voyage, fully with all your plans and intentions; and, before you
sail from New York, appoint a place of rendezvous; change it as often as cir-
cumstances may render a change desirable ; but always have a place of rendez-
vous fixed upon, so that in case the two vessels of the expedition may at any
time become separated, each may know where to look for the other.
Nearly the entire Arctic front of the continent has been scoured without find-
ing any traces of the missing ships. It is useless for you to go there, or to re-
examine any other place where search has already been made, you will therefore
confine your attention to the routes already indicated.
The point of maximum cold is said to be in the vicinity of Parry Islands.
To the north and west of these there is probably a comparatively open sea in
summer, and therefore a milder climate.
This opinion seems to be sustained by the fact, that beasts and fowls are seen
migrating over the ice from the mouth of Mackenzie River and its neighbour-
ing shores to the north; these dumb creatures are probably led by their wise
instincts to seek a more genial climate in that direction, and upon the borders .of
the supposed more open sea.
There are other facts elicited by Lieutenant Maury in the course of his inves-
tigations, touching the winds and currents of the ocean, which go also to confirm
the opinion, that beyond the icy barrier, that is generally met with in the
Arctic Ocean, there is a polnia, or sea free from ice.
You have assisted in these investigations at the National Observatory, and are
doubtless aware of the circumstances which authorize this conclusion, it is there-
fore needless to repeat them.
This supposed open sea and warmer region to the north and west of Parry
Islands are unexplored; should you succeed in finding an opening there, either
after having cleared Wellington Strait, or after having cleared Parry Islands
by a northwardly course from Cape Walker, enter as far as in your judgment it
may be prudent to enter; and search every headland, promontory, and con-
spicuous point for signs and records of the missing party. Take particular care
to avail yourself of every opportunity for leaving, as you go, records and signs to
tell of your welfare, progress and intentions.
For this purpose you will erect flagstaff's, make piles of stones, or other marks
in-conspicuous places, with a bottle or banaca buried at the base, containing
your letters.
Should the two vessels be separated, you will direct Passed Midshipman
Griffin to do likewise.
Avail yourself of every opportunity, either by the Esquimaux or otherwise,
to let the department hear from you; and in every communication be full and
particular as to your future plans and intended route.
If by any chance you should penetrate so far beyond the icy barrier as to make
it, in your judgment, more prudent to push on than to turn back, you will d 6 so,
and put yourself in communication with any of the United States naval forces, or
officers of the Government, serving in the waters of the Pacific or in China,
according to your necessities and opportunities. Those officers will be instructed
to afford you every facility possible to enable you to reach the western coast of
the United States in safety.
In the event of your falling in with any of the British searching parties, you
will offer them any assistance of which they may stand in need, and which it may
be in your power to give. Offer also to make them acquainted with your intended
route and plans, and be ready to afford them every information of which you
may have become possessed concerning the object of your search.
In case your country should be involved in war during your absence on this
service, you will on no account commit, or suffer any one of the expedition to
py. a 2 commit.

commit, any the least act of hostility against the enemy, of whatever nation he
may be.
Notwithstanding the directions in which you have been recommended to carrw
your examinations, you may, on arriving out upon the field of operation, find
that by departing from them, your search would probably be more effectual.
The department has every confidence in your judgment, and relies implicitly
on your discretion; and should it appear during the voyage that by directing
your attention to points not named in this letter, traces of the absent expedition
would probably be found, you will not fail to examine such points ; but you will
on no account uselessly hazard the safety of the vessels under your command, or
unnecessarily expose to danger the officers and men committed to your charge.
Unless circumstances should favour you, by enabling you to penetrate (before
the young ice begins to make in the fall) far into the unexplored regions, or to
discover recent traces of the missing ships and their gallant crews; or unless
you should gain a position from which you could commence operations in the
season of 1851 with decided advantage, you will endeavour not to be caught in
the ice during the ensuing winter, but after having completed your examinations
for the season, make your escape, and return to New York in the fall.
You are especially enjoined not to spend, if it can be avoided, more than one
winter in the Arctic regions.
Wishing you and your gallant companions all success in your noble enterprise,
and with the trust in God that He will take you and them into his holy
keeping,
I am, &c.

arrived at this port four days ago from the United States, via San Francisco, in
command of the whaling ship “ Sheffield,” of 600 tons burthen, remarkably
well manned and found, belonging to New York, and purposes in a week to
continue on his course to the Arctic sea.
He assures me that he is fully determined to go as far north as the ice will
permit, and to use his utmost endeavours to obtain tidings of Sir John Franklin
and his party.
Captain Roys is still of opinion that a north-west passage may be found, and
that the chances of success in finding one are much greater by an easterly than
by a westerly course, in consequence of the prevailing westerly winds and north-
east current. He thinks, also, that land exists in about 70° due north of Behring’s
Straits,
* Extracts given.


Straits, because, he says, that in steering in that precise direction he
found the water too shallow, whilst when he deviated either towards the north-
east or north-west, his soundings did not decrease.
Captain Roys hoped to have reached the Sandwich Islands a month since,
nnd to have sailed again hence at least three weeks ago for the Arctic. He trusts,
however, that he is still in good time.
I have been expecting here for the last month Her Majesty’s ship “ Herald,”
but she has not yet made her appearance. The two vessels of war which it
appears were to have sailed from England last January for these islands, on their
way to the Arctic, cannot well reach Honolulu until the elapse at least of another
month.

1 have the honour to acquaint you that Her Majesty’s ship under my command
reached this place to-day, after a passage of 80 days from England ; that I have
not seen the “Investigator” since the Ist of February, and that it is my intention
to proceed to-morrow through the Straits, leaving the “ Gorgon ” to follow with
our consort when she arrives; and that should she not do so early, I shall make
my way to the Sandwich Islands direct, instead of complying with their Lord-
ships’ directions and calling at Valparaiso. The necessity of this deviation will,
I trust, be a sufficient reason; as I look upon our arrival in Behring’s Straits
during the first week in August to be essential to their Lordships’ orders.
The “ Gorgon ” will supply both vessels with the amount of provisions
expended, since leaving England, nearly, and as' Captain Paynter has made
arrangements for the procuration of bullocks and vegetables, during our pas-
sage through the Straits, the object of refreshing the ships’ companies will be
•obtained.

The “ Investigator ” not having arrived, I deemed it advisable to push on by
myself, leaving orders with Captain Paynter to join me in the Straits, on the
17th, should the “ Investigator ” not appear.
We reached this place, being favoured with fine weather, and having stayed a
day at Sandy Point, for the purpose of procuring fresh beef, on the morning
of the 16th, I had the happiness of being joined by the “ Gorgon ” and the

Her Majesty’s Ship “ Investigator, ”"1
25 April 1850. /
(signed)
Robert M‘Clare,
Commander.
“ Investigator ” yesterday afternoon ; so that we are now in a condition to fac e
the most difficult portion of the navigation, with 10 days’ fuel independent of
what can be spared from the discovery ships in case of need, which I have littl e
doubt, by choosing our time, will be sufficient to take us fairly into the Pacific ;
yet as the period for our arrival in Behring’s Straits is drawing on so fast, I feel
myself under the necessity of proceeding from here straight to the Sandwich
Islands, as the time lost by calling at Valparaiso would lessen the probability of
my reaching the ice by the Ist August.
Under this conviction, our provisions have been completed from the “ Gorgon,”
and with the 10 days’ fresh beef we have obtained here, together with the stores
their Lordships have provided for the health of the crews, 1 have little doubt but
that the object they had in view by ordering me to repair to that port will be
obtained, and that the health of the ships’ companies will not be impaired by
foregoing a relaxation, while the main object of their Lordships’ instructions
would be lost,
I have, &c.

Her Majesty’s Discovery Ship “ Investigator,” at Sea,
(Lat, 52° 36' S., Long. 80° 44' W.), 25 April 1850.
In consequence of the peculiar service upon which this ship is employed ren-
dering it impossible to procure any vegetables whatever, I have deemed it
expedient for the preservation of the health of the ship’s company, and at the
recommendation of the surgeon, that the accompanying scale of victualling should
be substituted for that at present used, established in the Admiralty regulations.
It is my direction that you substitute the said scale, and issue rations to the
ship’s company accordingly, until further orders.

the note of which I take leave to enclose a copy, for the information of my Lords

My dear Sir, Honolulu, 27 June 1850.
Captain Collinson, of Her Britannic Majesty’s Ship “ Enterprise,” is anxious
that the accompanying despatch should be forwarded to the Admiralty with the
least possible delay.
He left the “Investigator” all well off Cape Pillar; she is expected every
day, but Captain Collinson is so anxious to get to the north, that he will not
wait for her.
He will take in here what fresh provisions he can, and will sail in three or four
days.
I showed him Dr. Rae’s letter to you, published in New York, 13 April,
showing that all the coast from Behring’s Straits to eastward of the Coppermine
River, had been searched in vain.
I am, &c.

received from Captain Collinson and Commander M‘Clure, detailing their pro-

3. The “Enterprise” arrived at Honolulu, June 25th, and sailed June 30th,
and the “ Investigator” arrived July Ist, and sailed July 4th. The assistance
rendered by commander Aldham, and the ship’s company of the “Swift,” in em-
barking provisions, water, and other stores, enabled the commanding officers of
both vessels to grant their crews a short leave of absence; and commander
Aldham informs me, that all on board proceeded on their voyage in the best
spirits, and were anxious to commence their arduous undertaking,

“ Swift,” were of course delivered to Captain Collinson, and although the
“ Cockatrice ” did not reach Honolulu until three days after the “ Enterprise ”
had sailed, I am happy to add, the despatches which she conveyed were delivered
to the charge of Commander M‘Clure on the 3d July.

Her Majesty’s Ship “ Enterprise,”
Sir, Oahee, 29 June 1850.
I have the honour to report to you, that Her Majesty’s ship under my com--
mand reached this place on the 25th instant, after a passage of 65 days, from
the Straits of Magellan.
The severity of the weather after entering the Pacific, prevented any commu-
nication with the “Gorgon;” I have therefore had no previous opportunity of
reporting that I had taken the liberty of removing a boatswain’s mate from
that vessel into the “ Investigator,” as acting boatswain; the boatswain of that
ship having been left behind at Plymouth.
The necessity of making the best of my way to Behring’s Straits without the
least delay, induced me also to take from her all the provisions she could spare,.
and steer at once for these islands, instead of resorting to Valparaiso.
While in the Straits of Magellan, the Governor of the Chilian settlement, on
my urgent application, supplied the ships with four bullocks; the necessity of the
case he begged might be represented to his government, as by his instructions
he is forbidden to kill any of the cattle.
The “ Investigator” not having arrived, and the season being so far advanced,
I have determined to proceed alone, leaving orders for Commander M‘Clure to
follow with the utmost dispatch; and that if he is prevented by the severity of
the weather from following me into the pack, he is to cruise along the edge, so
long as the season will permit; and then having deposited, under the charge of
the “ Plover,” all the provisions she can take care of, he is to proceed to Val-
paraiso to replenish, returning to the Straits by the month of June,
I am much indebted to Commander Aldham for the cordial assistance he has
afforded in completing our supplies; and should the “ Investigator” arrive on
the Ist, I have taken the liberty of desiring him to remain a day or two, so as
to expedite her.

Her Majesty’s Discovery Ship “ Investigator,”
Sir, Woahoo, 1 July 1850.
I have the honour to acquaint you with my arrival at this place, for the
information of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and to state that at
3 p.m.


3 p.m. on the 20th April, we were taken in tow by Her Majesty’s steam sloop
“ Gorgon,” off Cape Pillar, blowing fresh from the westward, which gradually
increased to a gale, when the towing hawsers carried away upon the 21st, at
1 a.m.; the “Gorgon” remained in company till 10 a.m. of that day, when,
being unable to render any further assistance, she ran to leeward, with the inten-
tion of falling in with the “ Enterprise.” At 1 a.m, of the 22d observed a rocket
and blue light, but could not distinguish the vessel; answered the signal, expect-
ing at daylight to see her, but was disappointed. From that date to 12th
May we experienced nothing but strong westerly gales, with heavy sea, when it
began gradually to moderate, varying from S.S.W. to north, with occasional
squalls and heavy rain, until the 2d June, in lat. 17 deg. 46 min. S.; long.
105 deg. 64 min. W., it settled into the S.E. trade, drawing to E.N.E. as we
passed to the northward of the Equator, which wind has continued until our
arrival at this anchorage.

Her Majesty’s Ship “ Enterprise,”
Sir, Oahee, 29 June 1850.
I availed myself of a vessel sailing to California, to report our arrival here
on the 25th instant; and I now take the opportunity of the “ Swift” returning
to Valparaiso.
On entering the Pacific, owing to the bad weather and mountainous sea, the
“ Gorgon ” could not communicate; and as there was little likelihood her assist-
ance would be of any "avail until we reached a more temperate latitude, I sig-
nalled her to return to Valparaiso on the 23d April.
A continuation of westerly winds compelled us to pass to the eastward of Juan
Fernandez and St. Felix; and not getting the S.E, trade until we reached the
19th degree of south latitude, our passage from Cape Pillar has occupied
65 days.
By the “ Swift ” I have received their Lordships’ despatches, dated in March,
together with the Parliamentary Reports and Esquimaux vocabularies; but
I regret to add, that the balloons have been left behind, either at Panama, or
they have been carried on to California, in the American steam vessel.
Captain Kellet, who sailed from here on the 25th May, has appointed Cape
Lisburne as a rendezvous, whither I shall proceed to-morrow, having completed
water to 60 days, and provisions.
I am sorry to report that the “ Investigator” has not arrived; but as some
time will be lost in communicating with the “ Plover’’and “Herald,” there is
still a hope that the two vessels may join company previous to entering the
ice.
I enclose a copy of the orders I have left for Commander M‘Clure, which
contain my intentions, as far as I can be guided by the information I have
received.
I have, &c.

Memorandum.
Her Majesty’s Ship “ Enterprise,” Oahee,
29 June 1850.
So soon as Her Majesty’s ship under your command is fully complete with
provisions, fuel, and water, you will make the best of your way to Cape Lis-
burne, keeping a good look out for the “ Herald ” or casks, and firing guns in
foggy weather, after passing the Island of St. Lawrence. The whalers also may
afford you information of our progress.
Should you obtain no intelligence, you will understand that I intend to make
the pack, close to the American shore, and pursue the first favourable opening
west of the coast stream, pressing forwards towards Melville Island.
In the event of meeting land, it is most probable that I would pursue the southern
shore; but conspicuous marks will be erected if practicable, and information
buried at a 10-foot radius.
As it is necessary to be prepared for the contingency of your not being able to
follow by the ice closing in, or the severity of the weather, you will keep the
“ Investigator ” as close to the edge of the pack as is consistent with her safety,
and remain there until the season compels you to depart, when you will look into
Kotzebue Sound for the “ Plover,” or information regarding her position ; and
having deposited under her charge a twelvemonth’s provision, you will proceed
to Valparaiso, replenish and return to the straits, bearing in mind that the months
of June and July are the most favourable.
A letter from their Lordships’ hydrographer, relative to the variation of the
compass, is annexed; and you will bear in mind that the value of these obser-
vations will be greatly enhanced by obtaining the variation with the ship’s head
at every second or fourth point of the compass occasionally ; and the “ Investi-
gator ” should be swung, for deviation, in harbour, as often as opportunity may
offer.
Should you not find the “ Plover,” or that any casualty has happened to render
her inefficient as a dep6t, you will take her place; and if (as Captain Kellett
supposes) Kotzebue Sound has proved too exposed for a winter harbour, you will
proceed to Grantly Harbour, leaving a notice to that effect at Chamisso Island.
The attention of your officers is to be called, and you will read to your ship’s
company, the remarks of Sir John Richardson concerning the communication
with the Esquimaux, and which are contained in the Arctic Report received at
Plymouth.
Your operations in the season of 1851 cannot be guided by me, nor is there
any occasion to urge you to proceed to the N.E.; yet it will be highly desirable,
previous to entering the pack, that you completed provisions from the whalers,
and ; obtained as much rein-deer’s meat as possible. Captain Kellett’s narrative
will point out where the latter is to be had in most abundance, and where coal
can be picked up on the beach ; but husband the latter article during the winter,
by using all the drift wood in your power.
In the event of leaving the straits this season, you will take any weak or sickly
men out of the “ Plover,” and replace them from your crew; affording Com-
mander Moore all the assistance in your power, and leaving with him Mr. Murt-
ching the interpreter, together with the instructions which you have received
with regard to his accommodation.
To Commander M‘Clure, (signed) Richard Collinson.
Her Majesty’s Ship “ Investigator.”
Should it be the opinion of Commander Moore that the services of the “ In-
vestigator ” ship’s company, in exploring parties during the spring, would be
attended with material benefit to the object of the expedition, he will, notwith-
standing these orders, detain you for that purpose; but care must be taken that
your efficiency, as a sailing vessel, is not crippled by the parties not returning in
time for the opening of the ice.

I have the honour to report, for the information of the Lords Commissioners

I learnt, with much regret, that the “ Enterprise ” had only sailed the previous
day; and came into the harbour upon the 2d, when replacing my spars and com-

proceed this day for Behring’s Straits, to endeavour carrying into effect the orders

COPY of a DESPATCH from J. Parker, Esq. M. P., Secretary of the Admiralty,
to Rear Admiral Hornby, c. B., Commander-in-Chief on the Pacific Station.
Sir, Admiralty, 14 December 1850.
1 am desired by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you
that they consider it to be of the utmost importance, that in accordance with the
7th paragraph of the orders which their Lordships gave to Captain Collinson (a
copy of which is herewith enclosed), there should be an efficient depot, or point
of succour, in the most favourable quarter within Behring’s Straits, and as far in
advance as possible, on which the “ Enterprise” and “ Investigator” may have
to fall back, and where, in case of any disaster occurring to those vessels, the
crews may be sure of finding a safe asylum.
As the “ Plover” will have passed three winters in the ice it will be necessary,
if she is to remain a fourth, to furnish her with an ample supply of stores, fuel,
clothing, and provisions, and to withdraw such of her crew as may have already
suffered, or who may be desirous of quitting those regions ; such men only being
permitted to remain as may volunteer their services, and upon whom a strict
medical survey should be held.
I am therefore to signify their Lordships’ directions to you, immediately on
receipt of this despatch, to cause one of Her Majesty’s ships under your orders to
be equipped for the above purpose; and to order her captain to proceed forth-
with, by the Sandwich Islands, provisioning her to the fullest extent, and
providing her with as large a quantity of fuel and antiscorbutics as can be
obtained.
At the Sandwich Islands he will probably learn the “ Plover’s” rendezvous ;
and he is to use his utmost endeavours to reach Behring’s Straits before the
“ Plover” is afloat, and carefully refit her for the service in question.
Their Lordships further desire you will call for volunteers from the squadron
under your command, in order to form a crew for the “ Plover” until the autumn
of 1852, when it is probable that the “ Plover” will be withdrawn ; and besides
the credit they will derive from cheerfully coming forward for such an arduous
service, you will offer them double pay, as a further incentive, from the date of
their joining the “ Plover.”
In the possible contingency of the “ Plover” being thrown upon shore by the
pressure of the ice in Kotzebue Sound, and rendered unfit for the service, you
are to direct the captain of such ship as may be dispatched to receive her crew,
and to secure Her Majesty’s ship under his command in some convenient harbour
near the entrance of the straits, for the purpose of passing there the ensuing
winter of 1851, placing ample notices of the spot selected, in the event of any
parties either from Sir John Franklin’s ships or from those of Captain Collinson

Admiralty.
Her Majesty’s Discovery Ship “ Investigator,” at Sea,
(Lat. 51° 26' N.; Long. 172° 35' W.),
Sir, 20 July 1850.
As I have received instructions from Captain Collinson, c. b., clear and
unembarrassing, (a copy of which I enclose) to proceed to Cape Lisburne, in the
hope of meeting him in that vicinity, as he anticipates being detained a day or
two by the c< Plover ” in Kotzebue Sound, it is unnecessary to add that every
exertion shall be made to reach that rendezvous, but can scarce venture to hope
that, even under very favourable circumstances, I shall be so fortunate as to
accomplish it, ere the “ Enterprise ” will have rounded that Cape, as, from her
superior sailing, she hitherto having beaten us by eight days to Cape Virgins,
and from Magellan Straits to Waohee six. It is, therefore, under the probable
case that this vessel may form a detached part of the expedition, that I feel it
my duty to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Admi-
ralty, the course which, under such a contingency, I shall endeavour to pursue,
and have to request that you will lay the same before their Lordships.
Ist. After passing Cape Lisburne it is my intention to keep in the open water,
which, from the different reports that I have read, appears, about this season of
the year, to make between the American coast and the main pack, as far to the
eastward as the 130th meridian, unless a favourable opening should earlier
appear in the ice, which would lead me to infer that I might push more directly
for Banks’ Land, which I think is of the utmost importance to thoroughly
examine.
In the event of thus far succeeding, and the season continuing favourable for
further operations, it would be my anxious desire to get to the northward of
Melville Island, and resume our search along its shores, and the islands adjacent,
as long as the navigation can be carried on, and then secure for the winter in
the most eligible position which offers.
2d. In the ensuing spring, as soon as it is practicable for travelling parties to
start, I should dispatch as many as the state of the crew will admit of in different
directions, each being provided with 40 days’ provisions, with directions to
examine minutely all bays, inlets, and islands towards the N. E., ascending occa-
sionally some of the highest points of land, so as to be enabled to obtain extended
views, being particularly cautious in their advance, to observe any indication of
a break up in the ice, so that their return to the ship may be effected without
hazard, even before the expenditure of their provisions would otherwise render it
necessary.
3d. Supposing the parties to have returned (without obtaining any clue of the
absent ships), and the vessel liberated about the Ist of August, my object would
then be to push on towards Wellington Inlet (assuming that that channel com-
municates with the Polar sea), and search both its shores, unless, in so doing,
some indication should be met with to show that parties from any of Captain
Austin’s vessels had previously done so, when I should return and endeavour to
penetrate in the direction of Jones’ Sound, carefully examining every place that
was practicable. Sir, should our efforts to reach this point be successful, and in the
route no traces are discernible of the long-missing expedition, I should not then
be enabled longer to divest myself of the feeling, painful as it must be to arrive
at such a conclusion, that all human aid would then be perfectly unavailing, and
therefore, under such a conviction, 1 would think it my duty, if possible, to
return to England, or, at all events, endeavour to reach some port that would
ensure that object upon the following year.

W 4th. In the event of this being our last communication, I would request you
to assure their Lordships that no apprehension whatever need be entertained of
our safety until the autumn of 1854, as we have on board three years of all
species of provisions, commencing from the Ist September proximo, which,
without much deprivation, may be made to extend a period of four years, as,
moreover, whatever is killed by the hunting parties I intend to issue in lieu of
the usual rations, which will still further protract our resources.
It gives me great pleasure to say that the good effects of the fruit and vege-
tables (a large quantity of which we took on board at Waohee) are very percep-
tible, in the increased vigour of the men, who at this moment are in as excellent
condition as it is possible to desire, and evince a spirit of confidence and a cheer-
fulness of disposition which are beyond all appreciation.
sth. Should difficulties apparently insurmountable encompass our progress, so
as to render it a matter of doubt whether the vessel could be extricated, I should
deem it expedient, in that case, not to hazard the lives of those entrusted to my
charge after the winter of 1852, but, in the ensuing spring, quit the vessel with
sledges and boats, and make the best of our way either to Pond’s Bay, Leopold
Harbour, the Mackenzie, or for the whalers, according to circumstances.
Finally. In this letter I have endeavoured to give an outline of what I wish
to accomplish (and what, under moderately favourable seasons, appears to me
attainable), the carrying out of which, however, not resting upon human exer-
tions, it is impossible even to surmise if any or what portion may be successful.
But my object in addressing you is to place their Lordships in possession of my
intentions up to the latest period, so, as far as possible, to relieve their minds
from any unnecessary anxiety as to our fate ; and, having done this, a duty which
is incumbent, from the deep sympathy expressed by their Lordships, and parti-
cipated in by all classes of our countrymen, in the interesting object of this
expedition, I have only to add that, with the ample resources which a beneficent
Government and a generous country have placed at our disposal (not anything
that can add to our comfort being wanting), we enter upon this distinguished
service with a firm determination to carry out, as far as in our feeble strength
we are permitted, their benevolent intention!].

Her Majesty’s Discovery Ship “ Investigator,”
Kotzebue Sound (Lat. 66° 54' N.; Long. 168* W.),
Sir, 28 July 1850.
I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords Commis-
sioners of the Admiralty, that to this date we have had a most excellent run.
Upon getting clear of Waohee, on the morning of the sth, we shaped a course
direct for the Aleutian Group, passing them in 172° 40' W ; upon the evening
of the 20th continued our course, with a fine south-easterly breeze, but extremely
thick and foggy weather (which retarded the best of our way being made) ; got
fairly out of Behring’s Strait upon the evening of the 27th, and are now in a
fair way of realizing their Lordships’ expectations of reaching the ice by the
beginning of August, our progress being advanced by the favourable circum-
stances of a fine southerly wind, and tolerably clear weather; the latter we have
known nothing of since the 19th, which I can assure you rendered the naviga-
tion amongst the islands a subject of much and deep anxiety, seldom having an
horizon above 400 yards, that just enabled the dark outline of the land to be
observed and avoided.
It is with much satisfaction that I report the good qualities of this vessel,
having well tried her in the heavy gales experienced during five weeks off Cape
Horn, and in moderate weather, amongst the intricate navigation of these
islands, where so much depended upon her quick obedience to the helm,
although laden with every species of stores and provisions for upwards of

three years; from these circumstances, I am therefore fully satisfied she is as
thoroughly adapted for this service as could be reasonably wished.
I have not seen anything of the “ Enterprise,” or is it my intention to lose
a moment by waiting off Cape Lisburne, but shall use my best endeavours to
carry out the intentions contained in my letter of the 20th, of which I earnestly
trust that their Lordships will approve.
I am happy to be able to state that the whole crew are in excellent health and
spirits, and everything as satisfactory as it is possible to desire.

COPY of a LETTER from Captain Collinson, C.B., to the Secretary of the
Admiralty.
Her Majesty’s Ship “ Enterprise,” Port Clarence,
Sir, 13 September 1850.
I have the honour to transmit an account of the proceedings of Her Majesty’s
ship under my command, since leaving Oahee on the 30th June.
Being delayed by light winds, we only reached the western end of the
Aleutian Chain by the 29th July, and made the Island of St. Lawrence on the
11th of August, from whence I shaped a course for Cape Lisburne, in anticipa-
tion of falling in with the “ Herald,” or the “ Plover not however seeing either
of these vessels, and finding nothing deposited on shore, I went on to Wain-
wright Inlet, the last rendezvous appointed ; here we communicated on the 15th,
and being alike unsuccessful in obtaining any information, I stood to the north,
made the ice the following morning, and reached the latitude 72 deg. 40 min. N.,
in the meridian of 159 deg. 30 min. W., without serious obstruction; here,
however, the pack became so close that it was impossible to make way in any
direction except to the southward. Having extricated ourselves by noon on the
19th, we continued to coast along the edge of the main body (which took
a south-easterly trend), running through the loose stream so as not to lose sight
of the tight pack. At 4 a.m. on the 20th, we were in the meridian of Point
Barrow, and 28 miles to the north of it, when we found open water to the N. E.,
in which we sailed without losing sight of the ice to the north, until the morning
of the 21st, when we were obstructed by a heavy barrier trending to the S. W.
A thick fog coming on, we made a board to the north, in order to feel the pack
edge in the upper part of the bight, and not to leave any part unexplored.
Having satisfied myself that no opening existed in this direction, we bore a\vay
to the south, running through heavy floes closely packed, and pushing to the
eastward when opportunity offered; in this, however, we were unsuccessful,
being compelled to pursue a westerly course, the floes being very heavy and
hummocky ; by 8 p. m. we were within 30 miles of the land, and having clear
weather, could see the ice closely packed to the south, that left no doubt in my
mind that a stop was put to our proceeding in this direction, by the ice butting
so close on the shoal coast as to leave no chance that our progress along it would
justify the attempt to reach Cape Bathurst, a distance of 570 miles, during the
remaining portion of this season; and finding this opinion was coincided in by
those officers on board qualified to form an opinion on the subject, I determined
to lose no time in communicating with Point Barrow, but to attempt the
passage further north, in hopes that the lane of water seen last year by the
“ Herald ” and “ Plover ” would afford me an opening to the eastward ;
I therefore reluctantly proceeded again to the west, and turning the pack edge
15 miles further to the south than it was on the day after we left Wainwright
Inlet, we followed the edge of a loose pack greatly broken up, until we reached
163 deg. W. long., when it took a sudden turn to the north, in which direction
we followed it until the morning of the 27th, when we were in latitude
73 deg. 20 min., and found the pack to the westward, trending southerly;
I therefore plied to the eastward, endeavouring to make way, but such was its
close


close condition that we could not work, although we might have warped through
had the condition of the ice in that direction afforded us any hope, but this I am
sorry to say was not the case; and, on the contrary, the further we entered the
larger the floes became, leaving us in thick weather often in great difficulty
where to find a lane.
On the 29th the thermometer having fallen to 28 deg., and there being no
prospect of our being able to accomplish anything towards the fulfilment of their
Lordships’ instructions this season, I bore away for Point Hope, where I arrived
on the 31st, and found a bottle deposited by the “ Herald,” which informed me
that it was intended to place the “ Plover ” in Grantly Harbour this season.
I accordingly proceeded thither, with a view of taking her place for the winter,
and enabling Commander Moore to recruit his ship’s company by going to the
southward. On my arrival I found her inside, preparing her winter quarters,
and having examined and buoyed the bar, I attempted to take this vessel inside,
but failed in doing so owing to the change of wind from south to north having
reduced the depth of water four feet, and had to relieve the ship of 100 tons,
which was quickly done by the opportune arrival of the “ Herald,” before she
was released from a very critical position. The tides being irregular, the rise
and fall depending principally on the wind, and that wind which occasions the
highest water, producing a swell on the bar, it became a question whether
a considerable portion of the ensuing season might not be lost in getting the
ship out of Grantly Harbour, and on consulting Captains Kellett and Moore,
finding it to be their opinion, founded on the experience of two years, that the
whalers coming from the south pass through the straits early in June, whereas
the harbours are blocked until the middle of July, I have come to the conclusion
that I shall better perform the important duty confided in me by returning to
the south, and replenishing my provisions, instead of wintering on the Asiatic
shore, where there is not a prospect of our being the slightest use to the missing
expedition. It is therefore my intention to proceed to Hong Kong, it being
nearer than Valparaiso, and the cold season having set in, my stores and
provisions will not be exposed to the heat of a double passage through the
Tropics ; and as I shall not leave until the Ist of April, I may receive any further
instructions their Lordships may please to communicate.
The “ Plover ” has been stored and provisioned, and such of her crew as are
not in a fit state to contend with the rigour of a further stay in these latitudes,
have been removed, and replaced by Captain Kellett, and the paragraphs
referring to her in ray instructions fulfilled.
I have directed Commander Moore to communicate annually with an island
in St. Lawrence Bay, in latitude 65 deg. 38 min. N., and longitude 170 deg.
43 min. W., which is much resorted to by the whalers, and where any communi-
cations their Lordships may be pleased to send may be deposited by them, as they
are not in the habit of cruizing on this side of the straits ; and I have requested
Captain Kellett to forward to the Admiralty all the information on this head he
may obtain at the Sandwich Islands.
It is my intention to proceed again to the north, and remain in the most
eligible position for affording assistance to the “ Investigator,” which vessel
having been favoured with a surprising passage from the Sandwich Islands,
was fallen in with by the “Herald,” on the 31st July, off Point Hope,
and again on the sth of August, by the “ Plover,” in latitude 70 deg. 44 min, N.,
and longitude 159 deg. 52 min. W,, when she was standing to the north, under
a press of sail, and in all probability reached the vicinity of Point Barrow
15 days previous to the “ Enterprisewhen Captain M'Clure, having the
whole season before him, and animated with the determination so vividly
expressed in his letter to Captain Kellett, has most likely taken the in-shore
route, and I hope before this period reached Cape Bathurst; but as he will be
exposed to the imminent risk of being forced on a shoal shore, and compelled to
take to his boats, I shall not forsake the coast to the northward of Point Hope
until the season is so far advanced as to ensure their having taken up their
winter quarters for this season.
1 have received from my officers, and ship’s company, that assistance and
alacrity in the performance of their duty which the noble cause in which we are
engaged must excite; and I have the satisfaction to report, that (under the

the ice it has been so hazy, no great distance could be seen from the mast-
head ; but from what I have seen of the ice we are amongst, I am afraid our
northerly route will soon terminate. The ice here is very heavy, and appears
little broken up, and no great distance from the floes, which, if they are as
heavy in proportion, our sanguine hopes of Melville Island will too soon be
blasted.

sunshine; wind from the E. and N.E. quarters ; reaching N. and N.W. through
heavy streams and cross ice ; a.m. got into a lane of water which led into the
main body of the ice. 2p. m. when close to, tacked south-eastward. The ap-
pearance of the ice here is very disheartening, for from N.N. E. to W.S.W.
(mag.) there is a complete chain of locked floes, as far as can be seen from the
mast-head (with the glass) ; they appear also to be of an immense thickness, and
very hummocky, that they must be from the appearance of the ice we have
already come through. What I have seen of the ice makes me still hold to my
old opinion, that if ever the passage is made it will be along the land with
either small vessels or boats, or both. Latter part, light airs and variable, with
thick fog. Lat. 72 deg. 40 min. N.; long. 159 deg. W.

Light breezes, attended with thick foggy weather; wind from the S. W. quarter,
running north-eastward; a. m. got raffled amongst heavy ice; commenced
warping and sailing south-eastward; 9 a.m. got clear, made a few boards to
windward; after which kept away and run N. by E. and N.N. E. amongst
streams and heavy loose ice, taking the pack edge along as nearly as we could
guess, it being still thick fog, and only seeing it occasionally (all st. sails set).
Ends, light airs, almost calm, and thick. Lat. 72 deg. 40 min. N.; long. 158
deg. 50 min. Since yesterday we have deepened our water from 35 to 75, and
to night to 133 fathoms; by such sudden deepening it would appear that the
shoaled water part of all this strait and coast has at one time been dry; and no
doubt but the old and new world had here been connected; the soundings at
133 fathoms was soft slime, the lead completely covered with it.
Monday, 19th August.
Commences with light airs, and partly calm thick foggy weather; got raffled
amongst heavy ice ; down boats, and towed out from amongst it; 4a.m. a light
breeze from the S. W. quarter, reached S. E. for an hour, tacked and stood in
for the ice; when close to it, cleared up, when we found the pieces we had been
amongst were a few only lying at the edge of another chain of very heavy
locked floes, and at the head of a deep bight; it being impossible to proceed
any further in a N. and N. W. direction through, I may say, an impenetrable
barrier.


barrier, we run along the S. E. side of the bight, sweeping every bight so as not
to lose the edge in case of another opening. Having swept the N. W. side of
this bight, we have taken it now all round : the ice upon the S. E. side is still
very heavy- Midnight; tacked at the ice, it being thick; if the floes in general
be such as the specimens we have already seen (for I never either in Greenland
or Davis’ Straits have seen anything equal to those that I have seen here for
thickness and hummocks), sledge travelling would be of little use upon such ice ;
I hope we will find another bight that will take us further to the eastward ; as the
ice seems to lie in that sort of a way, say bight and bight; but lam afraid they
will terminate too soon for us. The greater part of the loose ice, that is the
heavy pieces, are blackened with earth and mud. I think they are annual
visitors, sent off by the strength of the river currents, which form them into
streams ; we have hove a number of empty bouilli tins upon pieces of ice with
the ship’s name and date on them ; I hope daylight will give us a launch east-
ward ; lat. 72 deg. 28 min. ; long. 158 deg. 50 min. W.

edge; running through streams, occasionally taking care not to lose the pack
edge as we went along ; all st.-sails set: 11 a. ni, it cleared up ; we were run-
ning along a body of ice much heavier than any we had previously seen ; to the
N. W. and N. there was not a drop of water to be seen, neither a loose piece of
ice along the edge of what I consider to be an old fixed floe ; still we see no
stoppage, but plenty of water along the edge; but it is always leading in
towards the land, and I have no doubt but the result of these bights will put a
stop to our eastern route as well as the northern ones have done. The loose ice
that is about seems not to have any connexion with the N. W. ice, it being
much lighter. Latter part, light breezes, variable and airy, still no ice ; but I
am afraid it is getting too narrow in the head of this bight. Lat. 72 deg. 7 min.;

All these 24 hours fresh breezes, with fleeting fogs and intervals of sunshine;

ward, got up into the head of the bight; found it to be the same as the last
bight we came out of; seeing no further progress possible eastward in this body
likely, bore up, and took the S. E. side of the ice along, but found no opening
in it; the S. E. side is composed of much lighter ice, intermixed with heavy
scunces and very cross; no water could be seen from the mast-head over it;
and with the assistance of the ice blink and refraction, I do not think there is
any water (that is to say, water we could safely say land water), at least within
15 miles of us. The ice here as we have been going along has been closing
fast; and as the wind is, no doubt the bight will soon be filled up: we have
shoaled our water suddenly to 33 fathoms while running down this side of the
bight. It is now my opinion that this terminates our easterly career; for since
we first made the ice we have never lost sight of the pack, or floe edge, taking
all the round together: 10 a. m. rounded the S. E. point after passing through
heavy sea streams, and wash ice. Ends, fresh breezes, thick fog, sailingW.S.W.

NARRATIVE of the Proceedings of Captain Henry Kellett, of Her Majesty’s Ship
“Herald,” from May 1849 to October 1850.
Her Majesty’s Ship “ Herald,” at Sea,
Sir, 14 October 1850.
In reporting to you my proceedings, for the information of my Lords Com
missioners of the Admiralty, since leaving Oahee on the 24th of May last, it is
painful to be again obliged to communicate my want of success in gaining any
satisfactory information of, or in rendering any assistance to, the missing expe-
dition, under Sir John Franklin : that there have been no want of native reports
of ships having been seen on the coast, the following letter, and the accompanying
correspondence will fully show.
I made a very fair passage up to the Aleutian Islands, where we met with a
fresh N. N. E. wind, with rain, which lasted many days. On making the Kam-
schatka coast (23d June), I found it covered with snow, with every appearance
of its having been a severe winter. Passing to the eastward of Behring Island
(2d July), we were favoured with southerly winds, with clear weather, which
carried us up to St. Lawrence Island by the 10th. In running across the Bay
of Anadyr, I spoke an American whaler, the “ America” of New Bedford; from
this vessel I learned that about 200 sail were in this sea, and through the
straits. Passing westerly of St. Lawrence, I met winds from N.W. to N.N.E.,
and what is of very unusual occurrence, beat through the straits with moderate
and beautifully clear weather; being able to see at the same time, Asia, America,
and the Diomedia Islands, all clear of snow, with the exception of the patches
in the valleys which never thaw; and in standing close under East Cape, found
the coast perfectly clear of ice.
Here a native baidar boarded us; they were aware of the “ Plover’s ” having
wintered in Kotzebue Sound, frequently mentioning Commander Moore’ sname;
these people had known him when wintering on the Asiatic side in 1848.
In running into Kotzebue Sound, we observed off Cape Krusenstern a very
extensive pack of ice ; I found the sound itself so encumbered with heavy floes,
through which I threaded my way, that at midnight, seeing no opening, I was
obliged to retrace my steps ; the pack appeared to extend from shore to shore.
Being in sight of Chamisso Island at the time, and within 12 miles of the
anchorage, 1 fired a gun in hopes that the “ Plover ” might have heard it. Next
morning, close to the edge of the ice, and distant 25 miles from Chamisso, I
dispatched a cutter, with Mr, R. Maguire, first lieutenant, to endeavour to com-
municate with “ Plover.” She passed a barrier of five miles through openings
between the floes, occasionally unable to see her way, and then got into open
water near Chamisso Island, where she found that vessel in readiness to depart
so soon as the ice would allow her.
Fortunately for me the weather remained fine; for most assuredly had it been
blowing a south-westerly gale, and thick, I should have run, and more than
probable have got myself into difficulties ; never having suspected the possibility
of any ice being in this sound so late in the season. While becalmed it was
curious to observe this extensive field breaking up and disappearing before its
great enemy : the temperature of the water was 50 degrees, and the air 60 degrees
Fahrenheit. A fresh north-westerly wind afterwards sprung up, with which
I worked out, under easy sail, to the entrance of the Sound. (6 a.m. 16 July.)
Having no ice in sight, I bore up for Chamisso to pick up my boat, intending
to anchor as close as the ice would permit; to my astonishment not a particle
was to be seen of that vast mass, which had but 30 hours before opposed a perfect

barrier to my entry; even all the shores within view were perfectly clear.
I found the “ Plover ” outside, having weighed the evening of my boat’s arrival;
she followed me into the anchorage under Chamisso Island, where both came to
at 1 p.m.
I was glad to find that her officers and crew were in such good health; although
during the winter serious apprehensions had been entertained, as symptoms of
scurvy had appeared in many, Captain Moore himself among the number. On
the breaking up of the ice his vessel had many escapes, and at one time he had
actually landed provisions, &c., fearing that something serious might happen.
During the winter his officers were frequently detached exploring the country
in the neighbourhood, Hotham Inlet, the Buckland River, Spafareif; they will
have added much to our geographical knowledge in these regions.
One of these journeys is, I consider, deserving of more particular mention; it
was performed by Mr. Pirn, acting mate of “ Herald ” (lent for the winter to
the “ Plover ”); he travelled across the country to Michaelouski, a Russian
settlement in Norton Sound, accompanied only by a Russian interpreter and a
native as a guide: he was 28 days on the road, and suffered much from want of
food and fatigue; his patient endurance, however, and spirit enabled him to
overcome all difficulties.
Commander Moore has, sir, no doubt, furnished their Lordships with the
details of this interesting journey.
I received from Commander Moore the * two communications marked A 1
and 2, acquainting me with Esquimaux reports which he had received during
the winter from the natives of Hotham Inlet, relative to the encampment to the
northward of a number of white people (in the vicinity of Point Barrow it is
supposed), and requesting my permission to proceed north to ascertain the truth
of these rumours.
Having completed his vessel with the few articles of provisions which he most
needed, I immediately dispatched him on this service, fearing it might have
been Commander Pullen and his party, who, in attempting to return, had been
obliged to winter on the coast; the natives having reported that the party they
spoke of would be fallen in with further south, as they had been endeavouring
to get that way. On the 21st July I left Kotzebue Sound for the north, and on
the 24th sent two boats on shore at Cape Lisburne to erect a mark and bury
information for Captain Collinson, this and Point Hope being the two rendezvous
I had appointed with him from the Sandwich Islands. I then with a north-east
wind stood to the northward, and made the ice, heavily packed, at noon on the
26th, in latitude 70 deg. 18 min. N., long. 167 deg. 48 min. W., 50 miles further
south than we encountered it last year. Working easterly, I again made it on
the 29th, in latitude 71 deg. 19 min. N., long. 162 deg. 57 min. W., and a third,
time within 20 miles of Wainwright Inlet.
Having now established the position of the pack, I bore up for Cape Lisburne
(running over in my passage south the “ Plover’s ” three rendezvous without
meeting her), to endeavour to fall in with Captain Collinson’s expedition.
On the morning of the 31st July, Cape Lisburne S. 50, E. 12 miles, we
fell in with Her Majesty’s ship “Investigator;” she had made a surprising
passage of 26 days from Oahee; left it on the 4th July; cleared the islands on the
6th, passed the Aleutian Group by Straits of Araankta on the 20th; Behring
Straits on the 27th ; met “ Plover” on the 29th, and “ Herald” on the 31st;
she steered a straight course and carried a fair wind the whole way.
From him I learned that Mr. Pullen had safely arrived at the Mackenzie,
and that he had been ordered to proceed* on another expedition, I saw from the
printed copy of the Arctic papers with which Commander M‘Clure supplied
me.
Commander M‘Clure being three men short of complement, 1 filled up the
vacancies with volunteers from my own crew, all excellent men and healthy.
I wished him to take from me some provisions, but he was perfectly full; he had
at the time vegetables on board, and their last bullock had been killed but a day
or two before; his men were in excellent health and high spirits; I went all
over his ship, and was highly pleased with the comfort and cleanliness below;
indeed

indeed with the whole ship ; everything appeared in its right place. Commander
M'Clure did not much extol her sailing qualities, but spoke in high praise of
her capabilities for taking the ice, with which intention he parted from me at
midnight, with a strong N. E. wind, and under every stitch he could carry.
He must have made the ice next day (Ist August) in about the same position
in which it was first made by me. He was seen again by the “ Plover ” on the
sth, in latitude 70 deg. 44 min. N., longitude 159 deg. 52 min. W., steering
to the north with a strong S.W. wind; they could only communicate by ex-
changing numbers.
I continued to cruise off Cape Lisburne expecting daily to meet the “ Enter-
prise.” On the 13th August “ Plover” hove in sight with Commander Moore on
board ; his legs were so swollen by exposure to the cold, that he was but just able
to hobble on board “ Herald.” His letter (A. 4)* will acquaint their Lordships as
to how far he reached to the eastward of Point Barrow, and of the reports he
found current in that neighbourhood.
My reasons for not acquiescing with him in sending another boat expedition
to the “ Mackenzie, (to follow up and investigate these reports) were,
In the first place, I am of opinion that these reports have been entirely created
by the anxiety of all on board the “ Plover ” to obtain information, which has
caused the natives to be fully aware of the subject on which the strangers wished
chiefly to be informed. The Esquimaux are quick, and where it is likely that their
natural cupidity would be gratified, are ever ready, can they but get a lead, to
exercise their ingenuity by inventing a story. In Commander Moore’s letter
(A. 3)* it will be seen that it -was after he had made the chief of the Hotham
Inlet tribe perfectly understand the object of “ Plover’s ” wintering in those
regions, that the majority of these reports were received ; only one, on which not
the least reliance was placed at the time, had been reported previously ; every
American ship which passes through these straits (said to number about 80) is
furnished with instructions relative to the missing expedition ; in fact, the whole
of the small extent of coast accessible to ships is, at this moment, alive with
native reports.
In Commander Moore’s letter (A. 4)* it will be observed that at Wainwright
Inlet he could get no intelligence, although he made every inquiry after the
missing ships; that the natives followed him along from the inlet, and that at
Point Barrow they had the story ready. From the chart before alluded to,
made by the native woman in Kotzebue Sound, it was supposed that the Kopak
was either Point Hope, Wainwright Inlet, or Point Barrow, all of which places
have been respectively visited this season.
The natives at Point Barrow told Captain Moore that they had not actually
seen either the ships or the graves themselves, but that they had learned the
story from some natives who come from the Kopak, with whom they meet to
barter at a place distant from Point Barrow, ten sleeps or days’ journey (about
25 to 30 miles each). From this he now infers, that the Kopak must be situated
a little to the westward of the Mackenzie.
Secondly, all these reports refer to the autumn of 1848, therefore should there
be any truth in them, Commander Pullen must have unravelled them in 1849.
From the Arctic papers published by their Lordships, I see that a party from
the Mackenzie was actually examining that part of the coast where they report
the Kopak to be ; therefore, an expedition of 20 persons would have embarrassed
them for provisions, as they could not possibly have returned this season.
At Point Barrow must have commenced their search, where they might have
arrived by the 20th of August, which would have left them but barely time to
run to the Mackenzie without making any search, and would in fact have been
doing nothing. Even so early as the 11th August, Simpson in speaking of this
same journey says, “it was a subject of unavailing regret, that the great dis-
tance of our wintering station rendered it impossible to spare a few days for the
examination of this interesting and magnificent stream ” (Colville).
With respect to wintering at Point Barrow, it would have been a most
eligible position for “ Plover,” did it possess the advantages their Lordships
wished, namely, a positively safe harbour, and one accessible to any ship that
might

might be sent to relieve her. To have placed her there with only 14 months’
provisions, it would have been necessary for a ship to have been sent to her next
year with supplies; and could she not have come south (which is not at all cer-
tain) her people would have had to be withdrawn, as the nearest approach to her
would have been from the Seahorse Islands, a position too distant for the boats
of any man-of-war to transport the provisions and stores necessary for her sup-
plies ; and had anything happened to her, she would have been entirely destitute
of resources to fall back on.
Their Lordships direct that should no position be found south of Wainwright
Inlet (into which place eight feet was all that could be carried this year by
Commander Moore), she was to be placed in Kotzebue Sound. Commander
Moore’s letter (A. 6 )* will inform their Lordships why that has not been done ;
he states that “ he could not winter there without almost certain destruction ; **
indeed, from the opinion of the ice masters, I had serious apprehensions for her
safety last season,
In my opinion Grantley Harbour is the only place, south of the straits, in which
the “ Plover” could be of the least assistance as a dep6t; I considered also, that
did either of Captain Collinson’s ships touch there, not having been able to
penetrate easterly, they could have wintered, and filled up fort heir next year’s
voyage, from the depot which I should be enabled to leave there.
After dispatching the “ Plover ” on the evening of the 15th August (Enclo-
sure), I continued to cruise off Cape Lisburne, where I placed on the 19th further
information for Captain Collinson. The natives had removed my first deposit,
but I knew that had another vessel arrived they would have presented the paper
to her ; all of them are now aware of the value of paper, and are most anxious
to be possessed of some, invariably looking to see if it contains writing.
On the 25th I landed at Point Hope, where I found, untouched, the bottle
deposited by “Plover ”on her passage north; I erected a more conspicuous mark,
and buried a bottle with further information.
Being now thoroughly convinced that “Enterprise” had passed, I made sail
for the straits with light northerly winds, with the intention of going to
Michaelouski, Norton Sound, to personally investigate the reports brought from
that place by Mr. Pirn during the last winter (C).
When 30 miles off East Cape, on the 27th, we communicated with the Ameri-
can whaler “ Margaret Scott,” of New Bedford, a full ship, bound southerly; no
news. I sent the assistant surgeon on board to visit her sick. Passed the straits
at 9 p. m., in a moderate gale, and next evening was becalmed within 10 miles
of Sledge Island, and arrived ofFEgg Island (Michaelouski) on the morning of the
31st. It being calm, I left the ship in a cutter, accompanied by Mr. Woodward,
purser, Mr. Seemann, naturalist, and Mr, Pim, acting mate.
On my arrival at the redoubt, I was excessively disappointed, after taking my
ship into this very exposed sound, to find that the chief and his secondf, those
who gave Mr. Pim the information, had both left for Sitka, taking with them
every paper and letter. The present chief is from Kodiak, speaks nothing but
Russian, and is entirely unacquainted with the country. On asking him what
further he knew of the reports promulgated by his predecessor, he told me he
knew of none; he was not aware of any white men being in the country ; that
none of their people were killed last year ; in fact, that Gusef (the former chief)
had left him without any information whatever relative to them.
I then interrogated our former interpreter, who had been Mr. Pirn’s medium
of communication; he said that Gusef had received a letter from Derabin subse-
quent to Mr. Pirn’s departure, but had hot heard that it contained anything par-
ticular, On asking him concerning the double-barrelled gun, said to have been
bartered by the Indians, he said he knew an Indian who had seen one, and some
clothes.
On my former visit to this place in 1848, a report, obtained through the same
interpreter, was current, of six Americans being in the interior; and among the
Esquimaux of Kotzebue Sound, the same year, a similar one was likewise in cir-
culation. I can only account for the Russians spreading them by the belief that
some one must be in their vicinity purchasing furs, the quantities annually
brought to the fort having during the last two years diminished more than one-
half.

half. They could not be persuaded by Mr. Pim but that the “ Plover ” was
trading; these suppositions have however been entirely set aside by xny visit.
It is quite possible that the “ Plover ” may have interfered with their trade, the
natives finding they could obtain from her all they wanted for fish and veni-
son, articles much easier obtained than furs, and disposed of without going
so great a journey. Gn relating to the chief the account brought by Mr. Pim,
that he had not heard or knew anything of this, but that he had received instruc-
tions from the Governor-general at Sitka to render every assistance to any officer
or men employed in searching after the missing ships, and endeavour by every
means to obtain information of them and relieve them. I had rendered into
German, by Mr. Seemann (naturalist), the notice from the Arctic papers
(page 97, No. 8 F.), in expectation of getting it translated into Russian by
Kakaff. He had left; there is, however, a man at Derabin, who will be able
to do so. I also gave him a letter 1 had from Baron Brunow, addressed to
the governor of the Russian colonies ; this settled all doubts; he told me he
was going to Derabin as soon as the frost set in, and that should any reports
with sufficient foundation exist, he would send an expedition to unravel them ;
also, that he would communicate with the “ Plover ” in the spring.
The redoubt of Michaelouski is situated in latitude 63 deg. 28 min. N., longi-
tude 161 deg. 51 min. W., south side of Norton Sound. There is shelter for
vessels of light draught in the bay in which it stands.
This redoubt supplies annually two forts, and one or two fishing posts in the
sound with goods. The most distant and most northerly fort is Derabin, situated
near the head waters of the Ko-ikh-pak which falls into Norton Sound, a short
distance to the west of Michaelouski Redoubt; its position in latitude and longi-
tude is unknown; a launch leaves Michaelouski in the spring with goods; it
takes her 35 days to reach this fort and 15 to return ; by winter travelling it may
be reached in six days from a fishing establishment called Gregora. The other
fort is called Kalmakosskoi, and is situated to the south-eastward of Michaelouski,
five days’ journey on another river falling into the sea west of the redoubt.
These are the only places supplied by the fort; they know of nothing of any
post on the Yucon, or of any establishment in or near Kotzebue Sound.
From our former interpreter, and also from the one at present on board the
“ Plover,” both of whom have been to Derabin, I learned that the Lek-kho is
the actual head waters of the Ko-ikh-pak, and not, as was previously supposed, a
river on the other side of the mountains, falling into the Arctic Sea. It is, how-
ever, difficult to get any of these interpreters to perform their offices faithfully;
they will neither propose the questions you wish, nor return the exact replies.
I sailed from Michaelouski the same evening, and arrived at Port Clarence on
the sth September.
I found here the “ Enterprise ” and the “ Plover,” the latter already inside
Grantley Harbour, preparing a house for the reception of her provisions, the
former on shore, having grounded in attempting to enter Grantley Harbour.
With every assistance we could give her they failed in getting her off' that even-
ing or the next morning.
They commenced to lighten her, which was done before the evening tide, of
more than a hundred tons, when she went off without damage of any kind.
They were obliged to heave her astern, and with the bower chain, as she had
no stern-holes, some difficulty and delay would have been experienced in doing
this had it not been for the ready resource of Mr. Skead (her second master), who
placed a small anchor in the port, the arras and shank making a perfect lead
for the cable. •
The “ Enterprise ” being re-stowed' sailed on the morning of the 14th
September, but being unable, from the strength of the north winds, to pass
through the straits, anchored under Cape York on the evening of the 16th. The
wind moderated on the 17th, and on the 18th she had a fair wind through. All
hands were now employed in erecting a storehouse, landing provisions, removing
the officers and men considered by the medical officers as unfit to remain in the
“ Plover ” on her extended service, of whom the greater part had, during the
last winter, showed symptoms of scurvy. Her complement I have completed to
40 persons (including the interpreter), with volunteers, many of them the best
men, arid all the healthiest from this ship.
Commander Moore considered his crew should not be further decreased ; the
natives here- are so numerous, certainly not so trustworthy, and more indepen-
dent in their manner than the natives of Kotzebue Sound. We were visited by

a great number of them; on these occasions many acts of pilfering were com-
mitted, and as yet they have not been accompanied by their women.
Their principal establishment, which is said to occupy a large space on the
banks of the river *, falling into Grantley Harbour, is called Kavyiak, distant a
day’s journey from the “ Plover’s” anchorage.
I wished to visit this place, and proposed to the chief doing so; he promised
to come for us, but, failing in his agreement, I would neither go myself or
permit any other boat to go near them.
By having the chief or his son to accompany him on his first visits to these
native establishments, Commander Moore has hitherto been most successful in
his dealings with them, having been on the most friendl} 7 terms both at Owrel,
on the Asiatic side, and in Kotzebue Sound. I entertain no doubt of his being
equally successful here.
On the 21st September, the “ Plover’s” house being finished, her provisions
all landed and stowed, and the ship herself dismantled, I endeavoured to get
away, but being becalmed I was obliged to anchor. On the 22d I again tried;
and finally, on the morning of the 23d, left Port Clarence with an increasing
breeze from the northward, which by 4 p. m. reduced us to close-reefed main-
topsail ; hove to 50 miles north of the east end of St. Lawrence Island. Next
day at noon we passed east end of St. Lawrence Island, with light northerly
winds, which shifted during the night to the eastward; by the morning it blew
a gale, rendering it necessary either to heave to, or scud ; I chose the latter.
The following morning (26th), the gale having lightened, we had just made
more sail, when Charles Kennedy, a. b., fell overboard from the main rigging,
striking the chains (it is supposed) in his fall ; the ship at the time was running
eight knots. The life-buoy was immediately let go ; sail promptly shortened;
the ship rounded to the wind, but all was of no avail; neither man or buoy could
be seen. To have lowered a boat in the sea then running would have been ta
sacrifice her crew. Besides the gloom which the loss of a man invariably spreads
throughout a ship, this was the more distressing, as in a period of nearly six years,
in all our gales, this was the first fatal accident that had happened to us.
At 8 p. m. on the 28th we passed the Aleutian chain by the Strait of Amoukta,
in a fresh gale, at north veering westerly, which carried us into latitude 33° N.,
longitude 155° W. by the 9th of October, where we have met light southerly
winds and calms, with extremely hot weather.
This season, to the north of Behring Strait, has been, as far as my experience
goes, unusually fine; the latter part of July, until the middle of August, remark-
able for the prevalence of strong north and north-easterly winds, which brought
the ice further south, but at the same time cleared the coast of it.
In the beginning of May there was a solid wall of ice from Gore’s Island to
Cape Thadeus. July Ist, the bay south of East Cape was full of ice, and on
the same date, from East Cape to Serde Kamen, a compact body of ice. Ice
drove north. Whales followed it up close. The furthest north any whale-ship
has reached this year has been 70 deg. 30 min., and that on the American coast.
The part of the sea clearest of ice has been the meridian of 171 degrees.
The Bay of St. Lawrence is much frequented by the whalers, both in going
north and in returning south.
I have transmitted for their Lordships’ information every document in any way
connected with the Behring Straits’ expedition during the present season,
that they should be in full possession of the means of judging of their impor-
tance, and have given them in detail my views and opinions respecting the
reports therein contained, to prevent that apprehension and anxiety in the minds
of those so much interested, which I consider an unexplained promulgation of them
would be calculated to excite. I have at the same time transmitted a copy of
my private letter to Captain Collinson from Oahee, in which they will see my
opinion as to the route he should follow on his vo} r age towards the straits. He
will have placed much weight on my experience, and has, I now feel, prolonged
his voyage by it. He left it an open question with Commander M'Clure, who
made a straight course (the proper one I now consider to be, pursued up to the
end of August), and succeeded in making a wonderful passage, passing from the
south side of the Aleutian chain to Cape Lisbume without making land.
Although I have been painfully unsuccessful in the object of my voyage, I hope
for their Lordships’ approbation of the manner in which I have endeavoured to
carry out their views and wishes. We are now on our voyage home; how much
more happy would it have been had it pleased God to have made us the means
of

of extending succour to the missing ships, in which many of us have old ship-
mates, and very dear friends.
Had it been vouchsafed to us, I feel certain that by the ability, assisted by the
untiring zeal of my officers, and the uniform good conduct of my crew, that I
should have given a good account of the resources over which they have honoured
me with the command.
In conclusion of this my third voyage to the Arctic sea, and return to the
tropics, I have felt it my duty to thus soon place their Lordships in possession of
my estimate of the conduct of my officers during the protracted service, by
writing a separate letter in their behalf.

The “ Herald” arrived at Honolulu, Oahee, on the 16th of October 1850,
after a good passage of 23 days from Port Clarence. Should their Lordships
wish to communicate with me previous to my return to England, a letter would
probably catch me at the Cape of Good Hope.

Enclosure to No. 4 (A.)
My dear Collinson, “ Herald,” Oahee, 20 May 1850.
1 have left here for you, tracings of everything we have done that could be
useful to you. Everybody has been anxious to contribute. Two tracings of
Wainwright Inlet, one of the survey of, and the other the eye sketch and position
of the ice when we first made it. This would be a good place for the “ Plover,”
and she could be got there had she the assistance of your steam launch, to land
the stores as we lightened her. I have left here for you also four tons of coals,
which you can either take or not, as you like. They are at Mr. Robinson’s
building yard, in bags ready for taking on board. There is no wood.
When you leave this you will of course run to the (southward) leeward of the
island, giving it a wide berth of at least 20 miles, for fear of calms. At that
season you will, however, have less chance of meeting them. Keep to the south-
ward of the parallel of Bird Island in making your westing, and do not haul up
for the south points of Kamschatka until you have got at least as far west as
Beechey went. You cannot follow a better track. Sighting the coast of Kam-
schatka, run from cape to cape of its coast, passing to the westward of St.
Lawrence Island.
Should you have a day or so light wind there, you will find the natives most
friendly, and you may procure a good supply of reindeer. It was here the
“ Plover” wintered in 1849; you have got a tracing of her harbour.
Leaving St. Lawrence, pass by all means to the westward of the Diomedia
Islands. Although Beechey recommends the eastern passage, it is neither so
wide or so safe. East Cape may be passed within a quarter of a mile, whereas
Cape Prince of Wales has a shoal running off it, not well defined in its limits.
If you should be obliged to pass through the Aleutian Group, by all means
prefer the Straits of Sequam (Amoughta); they are wide, safe, and free from
races, which none of the others are. I have passed through them. You will
find a very good description of them in the book which I have left for you, trans-
lated from the French by Mr. Woodward, purser of this ship, for your expedition.
I have now got you into the straits; of course you will not attempt to enter
Kotzebue Sound; should you do so, leave a bottle for me 10 feet magnetic north
of the pole on the top of Chamisso. Let this be an arrangement between usr
10 feet magnetic north from a pole, or the centre of a pile, will be always the
place to look for information; unless, indeed, instructions are cut or painted on
some conspicuous rock or bluff.
On the very western extreme of Point Hope, I shall leave a mark and bottle
for you, and shall consider this as our principal rendezvous; but if you cannot
wait, more than probable I shall fall in with you oft’ Wainwright Inlet, where I
shall erect an enormous mark on Point Collie. After that everything will be

uncertain. Close to Captain Beechey’s “ Asses’ Ears,” in a bay to the south-
ward and west of Cape Lisburne, I placed a mark and left a bottle last year.
I shall also leave a bottle there for you this year.
That you will be very late is beyond a doubt. You can hardly reach the ice
before the middle of August; at that time there is a very considerable breaking
up of the season. These seas may be navigated by a jolly boat in the months
of July, June, and part of May, but in the month of August I experienced strong
and frequent gales, with a very short uneas} r sea.
The weather improves again early in September. In Kotzebue Sound, at this
season, easterly winds prevail, with beautiful weather. At the end of this month
the winter commences and sets in rapidly. Some time in November the sound
freezes over (so say the natives here), and no doubt this is the case much sooner
further north.
I have sent you “ Nancy Dawson’s” track round Point Barrow, Mr. Martin’s
journal in command of my launch, and some remarks by Mr. Pullen and Sir
John Richardson, to show you the different opinions there are relative to the
natives.
My opinion is, that where women are present there is hardly ever any fear of
an attack from savages. The Esquimaux, whenever I have coirie in contact with
them, have been most friendly. Nothing, in fact, could exceed their endeavours
to please and assist, when I traced the “ Buckland,” where they were associated
in great numbers; and what is more extraordinary, that, with the exception of
some petty pilfering at Wainwright Inlet, there was not committed an act of
theft all the time we were among them.
Your object being to get to the eastward, it is to be considered which is to be
the best route. To pass round Point Barrow appears to be the most practicable ;
last year I think you might have succeeded in doubling it. From all we know,
and from the native account, the ice collects and packs heavily on Point Barrow,
open but for a short time, and not every year.
By their accounts there is every year a boat passage to the great river (Mac-
kenzie) from Point Barrow. You will see by Mr. Martin’s journal that they
saw broken water to the north and west of the point. The yacht was pressed on
to the shore, but the ice grounded and she escaped; something similar to what
happened to Beechey’s barge.
Should you be enabled to double this point and escape the shoal water, we
will see you return by the Atlantic (by God’s blessing, with our friends in com-
pany), as I do not consider you can return by the west.
The mouth of the Mackenzie may afford you shelter for the winter, or, still
better, one of the numerous islands east of its entrance. I believe that the
vicinity of a river is to be by all means avoided as a wintering station. The ice,
I see, was once completely forced over the island on which Fort Good Hope was
situated ; it is now shifted to the main.
From this position you could easily, in the early spring, send your parties, who
would do much, knowing they had their house close to them: very different
from Sir John Richardson’s party, who could not arrive at the coast until a con-
siderable portion of the season was spent, and were obliged to relinquish their
search early, so as to reach shelter before the winter set in. Should you fortu-
nately get to this position, you would have the means of communication with
England.
From this to get you into the Atlantic : I feel certain that ships of your size
could not pass by the route of Simpson ; it is obvious, therefore, that you would
be obliged to get directly north, so as to avoid Victoria, Wollaston, and Banks,
which may be all one great land, or a mass of islands. By this route, also, you
would almost ensure your friends not being to the westward of you.
You,are now at Parry’s Island ; get home as fast as possible by his old track.
By following the coast you will be exposed to being beached; almost impossible
to avoid it. When east of Point Barrow, anchored under a sandbank off Dease’s
Inlet, the boats had no ice in sight, with a fair wind and a strong easterly tide.
1 have no faith in the sea being very clear for any time by the fact of not seeing
ice; for in these seas at least packed ice cannot be seen in clear weather more
than 10 miles from a ship’s mast-head.
As for a polar basin, there may be one, but well filled with lumps of ice.
Wrangel’s always coming to open water proves nothing, from the circumstance of
ice not being seen for a greater distance than 10 miles. Arctic voyagers can

tell you when they are approaching ice at a considerable distance by the blink,
and also, when near the pack, of open water by the sky. I have seen myself the
blink very plain, one dark night, off Wainwright Inlet; but then I do not think
I was more than 10 miles from it. I have tried also to fancy I have seen a
water sky.
I am not trying to make you believe that these appearances are humbug, but
that they may be carried too far by an imaginative mind. As an example, a
man I had on board as icemaster, who had been a long time in the Greenland
trade, quite seriously came to report to me, while at anchor in Kotzebue Sound,
that he had been to the mast-head, and could distinctly see the blink off Cape
Krusenstern; that he thought it was nearer than that, but that he was positive
the pack was resting on that point, distant more than a hundred miles. Some
days afterwards we passed without seeing a particle of ice.
Another plan you may follow : make the ice west of Point Barrow ; follow it
westerly, and northerly when it will permit you; as you will be able to pass
through streams of ice and broken packs, you will get a long way north.
I consider that when the sea is open, clear water will be always found on the
meridian of East Cape further north than in any other; that is, when Point
Barrow and the coast of Asia are encumbered, a clear channel will be found
near this meridian, leading, more than probable, to a terra incognita.
You will see by my track how I was led that way, and might have reached, I
am convinced, a more northerly position, but that a blink was reported south of
me. It would not do, although we have hard sides, to run the risk of being
nipped or losing our chains, which we should do the first jostling match we have
with the ice.
If you do not find land, you will be exposed to wintering in the pack. The
land I discovered I am convinced you might reach, but it would perhaps be too
far west. There are harbours on the coast of Asia, south of Cape North (the
one Cook entered, for instance) ; there you might winter this season. Should that
prove a bad position, you might go through the straits and winter in St. Lawrence
Bay, Emma’s Harbour, Point Tchaplin, or a better position than either, Grantley
Harbour. You will bear in mind, however, that in wintering in any of these
ports that a vessel choosing her time for leaving the Sandwich Islands will always
get into Behring sea long before a vessel wintering in any of them is clear of the
ice. The “Plover,” within 40 hours’ sail of Kotzebue Sound, having cut
through 1 \ miles of five-foot ice, only reached it 20 hours before me, touching
at and getting on shore at Petropaulski. I could have arrived there a month
before, but that I had a long passage, and left late in the season.
I do not think your vessels can winter in Kotzebue Sound; although Sir
James Ross speaks of its many well-sheltered coves, it has none for you, and
none with more than eight feet water. Captain Beechey says that a vessel
would require, to enable her to winter there, good anchors and cables ; for good-
ness sake don’t try that, for were your anchors and cables to hold, the ice would
pass right over you.
I have endeavoured to give you all the information I possess, and have also freely
given you my opinions ; you certainly have a difficult and arduous task to per-
form, but all that zeal and ability can do, you and your companions will, I am
assured, accomplish. But what is zeal and ability without God’s assistance ?
That He may grant it you, that you may all return in health, to make glad the
hearts of your own friends, and to receive the blessings of the relatives and
friends of those of whom you are in search, is the earnest wish and pyayer of

NARRATIVE of the PROCEEDINGS of Commander T. E. L. Moore, of Her
Majesty’s Ship “Plover,” from September 1849 to September 1850.
Her Majesty’s Brig “ Plover,” Grantley Harbour,
Sir, Port Clarence, 2 September 1850.
I have the honour to communicate to you, for the information of the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty, an account of the proceedings of Her Majesty’s
brig under my command, since the September 1849, which I trust will meet
their Lordships’ approbation.
Her Majesty’s ship “ Herald ” having sailed on the morning of the 29th
September (1849), I commenced to dismantle the ship and secure her in the best
manner the nature of the place would admit. To effect this purpose the sails
were unbent, the running gear unrove, and the great bulk, of the more weighty
provisions and stores taken on shore and lodged in a house built of driftwood.
By these means, and taking advantage of spring tides, I was enabled to place
the vessel to all appearance in security in 12 feet water, with an anchor ahead
to the N. E., and the hempen and chain streams astern, with a kedge and stream
anchors. The stem being the strongest and most protected part of the ship
was thus placed to seaward, as I conceived that to be the direction whence any
danger of pressure from the ice was to be apprehended.
It was not until the 17th of October that the temperature of the air fell in a
remarkable degree, when ice began to form in the bay, rendering it necessary to
have the boats hauled up and securely housed for the winter. On the 20th the
ice, which was just strong enough to bear a man’s weight, apparently yielding
to the combined force of a rising tide and a heavy squall from the westward, set
out from the bay, dividing upon the stream cable and rudder, and rolling the
vessel from side to side in its passage, but producing no further injury than
ruffling and fraying the edges of the sheets of copper, with which it came in
contact.
On the 23d the ice had again formed permanently in the bay, and I set about
“housing in” the ship, which I was enabled by the plentiful supply of drift
wood in the neighbourhood, to make much more complete than in the previous
winter.
Although the ice was firm in the bay, it was not so for some considerable time
in the offing, being frequently broken and thrown into hummocks of great
height off the more prominent points of land, and in those places where the
strength of the tidal stream seemed greatest. In the meantime a large stock of
firewood had been collected and stacked in a convenient place, an observatory
built on shore, tide pole erected, &c., and all other necessary arrangements made
for employing the leisure hours of the crew by such means as were calculated to
instruct and amuse.
The reduction of the number of the ship’s company by the absence of Lieu-
tenant Pullen’s party, and the less social disposition of the natives here (in Kotze-
bue Sound) than on the Asiatic side of 'the straits, unavoidably tended in some
degree to circumscribe our resources, but not to lessen the cheerful confidence
with which our second winter was encountered.
Whilst the bay was yet navigable I took the opportunity of visiting the natives
residing upon the Buckland River, for the purpose of more completely gaining
their confidence, with the hope that they might be prevailed to hunt for us, or
prove themselves otherwise useful to us during the winter, and I have good,
reason to believe I have been successful to a considerable extent.
During the months of November and December the ship was visited b}f a large
number of natives, from time to time, bringing with them small quantities of
reindeer and fish (especially the latter), which they readily bartered for tobacco.
These supplies, though limited, proved sufficient to enable every one to enjoy
the close of the year with something of the comfort appropriate to that time,
besides which the voluntary exertions of the officers were not wanting in the
production of plays and other amusements, so highly conducive to health, and
calculated to ward off the depression of spirits so liable to afflict men thus cir-
cumstanced, if left entirely to their own resources : indeed, I can look back with
unalloyed pleasure on the unfeigned enjoyment of the crew at that season,
which


■which was more especially observable on Christmas-day, on which the men,
following the practice of the preceding year, dined together at one table on the
upper deck.
Among other sources of occupation and healthy excitement during the months
of November and December, was the migration of numerous herds of reindeer to
the southward, in pursuit of which parties were repeatedly allowed to leave the
ship, whose efforts, however, were not crowned with success, owing to the fleetness
of these animals, the openness of the country, and the want of previously arranged
plans of concealment, from which they might be surprised.
'Early in the month of December I had sufficient confidence in the peaceable
manners of the natives to allow some of the officers to visit a chief’s village at
the entrance of Hotham Inlet, hoping by that means to gain intelligence of Sir
John Franklin’s party, who might be heard of along the coast, as well as extend
a friendly feeling toward us as far as they had communication with neighbouring
tribes. Hearing of an old chief at that place, represented as a man of great
influence among these people, I paid him a visit in January, although the tem-
perature was then 35 deg. of Fahrenheit. I found him exceedingly attentive and
desirous to cultivate a good understanding with us, promising to forward my
views to the utmost.
Whilst yet at this place several natives arrived from some distance to the
northward to barter; they at first wished me to accompany them back to their
country, but on some of my party expressing a willingness to go with them, the
chief and his people displayed a most decided reluctance to permit it, enumerating
the difficulties, privations, and the dangers attending such a journey, and at the
same time endeavouring to persuade the strangers not to visit the ship ; and in
this eventually they were successful.
Similar journeys, for the express purpose of meeting northern natives, were
performed on the Spafareif River, as well as the village to the north and east of
Hotham Inlet, where an equally good reception awaited all visitors; but beyond
these points it seemed difficult to penetrate, the chief difficulty being our inability
-to induce the natives to act as guides to the habitations of the distant tribes.
Thinking some information relative to Sir John Franklin might be obtained at
the Russian Fort Michaelowski, in Norton Sound, I availed myself of the prof-
fered services of Mr. B. C. J. Pim, acting mate, to communicate with that place.
In this journey the principal obstacle was the hinderance of the natives, shown in
unwillingness and delay in supplying the necessary food for the dogs.
From these journeys, and some of the natives who visited the ship, I have
heard several reports of strangers visiting this country to the north, in boats or
ships, which it will be necessary to enter into more at length.
The first report I received in the month of November 1849 from a native of
the Buckland River, who stated that two ships as large as the “ Plover,” and
resembling her in the number of masts, &c., had, in the course of the summer of
1848, stood in-shore to the eastward of Point Barrow, and were visited by some
Esquimaux in a biadar ; and that after they had been on board a short time the
water shoaled, when the vessels put about to the northward, on which the natives
.left them; after this they were not again seen. This report was said to have
been brought during the summer of 1848, by a native who had actually been on
board one of the vessels, and who, they told me, visited Kotzebue Sound every
summer ; but although constant inquiries have been made this year, nothing more
could be elicited respecting him.
On the 30th of April Mr. Pim returned from Michaelouski Redoubt, bringing
•a report from the Russian authorities at that place, to the effect that in the
summer of 1848, a party of people, consisting of two officers and ten men, were
■on the north coast of the continent, with two boats; that they were in some
degree of distress, and that they had bartered their arms, &c. with the Indians
for flour and other provisions. This intelligence had reached Michaelouski in
-consequence of their bartering with the natives having interfered with the traders
at a Russian trading post on the river “ Ek-ko ” (so called by the Russians),
but which I take to be the Yucan or Colville River. The communication between
Michaelouski Redoubt and this place is said to be effected by means of light
boats ascending a river at the head of Norton Sound, called the Ko-iak-pak, and
crossing a mountainous ridge, and then descending a tributary of the Colville to
the post. The Admiralty polar chart confirms the practicability of this means of
■communication.

On the Ist of May 1850 four natives arrived from the northward, one of whom
had visited the ship several times before, and appeared perfectly to understand
the mission on which the “ Plover” has come to this country. He said that he
had been travelling a long distance up the River No-a-tok (a stream of 100
yards wide, and bordered thickly with pine trees, by Mr. Martin’s (second master)
account, who visited it in the month of February 1850, for the purpose of
obtaining intelligence of the missing ships), which falls into Hotham Inlet, north
of the opening of that sheet of water into Kotzebue Sound ; that he there met
a party of natives, who told him of a vessel and a number of people “ like our-
selves,” who were a long way to the northward, with whom they had bartered
for knives, beads, and tobacco. This man’s description of the country, and a
chart he drew, led me to believe that the place indicated to be somewhere near
Point Barrow. In proof of his assertions he brought a wooden model of the
blade of a knife, which the natives had bartered from the strangers, marked with
a cross or dagger near the haft.
My anxiety on receiving this report was very great, as beside the chance of
any of Sir John FrankhVs expedition having reached any part of this coast,
I dreaded the possibility of Lieutenant Pullen’s having attempted to return to
this ship at a later period of the season, and being detained by unavoidable
difficulties on the northern coast. As the only means of relieving my anxiety
on this point, I sent Mr. Thomas Bourchier, acting second master, to the chief’s
village, to ascertain what reliance might be placed on the report, and what pos-
sibility of effecting a communication. On his arrival there, the chief’s eldest
son, by far the most active and intelligent of his tribe, made every inquiry
regarding the report; after which he assured Mr. Bourchier that there was no
truth in it, but made up with the hope of obtaining the large reward of a musket
and a quantity of tobacco I had offered to any native who brought the proof
that he had fallen in with any strangers “ like ourselves.”
He also told Mr. Bourchier that the place where these people were was unap-
proachable, except by sea.
Notwithstanding this opinion of the chief’s son, there were others of the tribe
who maintained the truth of the report.
These rumours made me still more anxious for the breaking up of the ice; and
the small patches of land, as they appeared, and slowly increased by the melting
of the snow in May, were watched by us all with the most intense interest. During
this and the preceding month the ship was completely rigged and freed from
the immediate contact of the “floe,” by sawing to some distance around. In
June the ice was much thinned, becoming rotten in many places near the shore,
by which I was enabled to move the ship a short distance ahead into deeper
water. On the 22d of June some slight movement of the main floe was observed
to take place, which subsequently increased with each succeeding tide, but with-
out seeming to lessen the quantity of ice about us. The cause of this is, I think,
sufficiently apparent. The Buckland, and rivers of a smaller size, at this season
already completely thawed, and considerably swollen by the draining of the land,
presses the ice in Escholtz Bay on towards the sound, where it is subject to fre-
quent checks by the flowing tide and westerly winds; thus keeping the passage
completely blocked up, until very little ice is left in the bay or the sound. As
the bay cleared a little, giving the ice more play, the ship became much ham-
pered, requiring the utmost vigilance to prevent her being pushed high upon
the beach, or overwhelmed by the pressure of floe upon floe, frequently depend-
ing for her safety upon the anchors and cables; and when the former, losing their
hold in the ground, allowed her to drive, they still had the effect of keeping the
stem to the pressure, to which I conceive her safety was owing. It would be
difficult to convey an adequate idea of the slow but irresistible force of floe backed
by floe to the distance of several miles to the north-eastward, becoming greater by
accumulation at every resisting point. On the 25th of June the ebb-tide of both
morning and evening thus forced the ship on the ground, but the anchors still
kept the bows in the direction of the pressure; the floes of 3 to 4 feet in thick-
ness, rising along the inclined plane of the cables, then splitting to the distance
of several hundred feet ahead, were crushed beneath the stem, or thrown outwards
off the bows, then passing astern piled in broken masses of 12 to 15 feet in height
along the shore of the bay. Each time as the force of the ebb tide ceased, the ship
was with infinite toil brought out to deeper water, to be again brought into the
bay, or grounded by the succeeding ebb. Thus daily harassed, I remained waiting
any


any chance of open water until the 12th of July, when I was enabled to get as far as
the anchorage at Ghamisso, to find the sound still filled with ice.
Whilst surrounded by the many dangers and difficulties which I have but
vainly attempted to describe, I cannot too highly commend the indefatigable
exertions of Lieutenant Edward J. Lloyd Cooper, whose valuable assistance to
me on several trying occasions merit my warmest approbation ; and it is with
great pleasure that I have the honour to bring him under their Lordships’ notice,
as an old officer, whose career through the service has been marked with strict
attention to, and zeal in all his duties.
The amount and nature of the injury sustained by the hull of the vessel is
sufficiently apparent, but not of a kind to interfere with her efficiency for service,
being chiefly confined to. the copper sheathing, many sheets of which are com-
pletely torn off, below the water line, and others partly so, but the doubling
beneath does not seem to have sustained more than an immaterial bruising of its
surface; the midship section on each side is bilged, apparently about three-
quarters of an inch, and all the whelps of the windlass broken in the wake of the
bolts by the strain of the cables.
The health of the men was much better during the beginning and depth of
the winter than might have been expected; but in the spring scorbutic appear-
ances were observed by Mr. John Simpson, assistant-surgeon, which were soon
removed under his skilful treatment. In the month of April these appearances
were general, languor and bodily weakness being observable among the greater
number of the men while at work on deck. Under these circumstances, at the
recommendation of Mr. Simpson, I directed the issue of salt meat, hitherto used
four days a week, to be suspended, and in lieu, issued an increased allowance of
preserved meats, with a due proportion of vegetables and other articles of diet,
to be given. At the end of a fortnight I had the pleasure of seeing the sick list
much reduced, and the whole crew manifestly much improved in strength as well
as in looks, and whilst congratulating myself on this improvement, I was enabled
to barter a large quantity of venison from the natives residing on the Sparfareif
River. This welcome supply was'issued at the rate of two pounds per man each
day in place of the preserved meats, and proved a most beneficial variety in the
provisions, so that by the end of May the health and efficiency of the ship’s com-
pany may be said to have been restored.
I have omitted to allude to the individual journey and arduous services per-
formed by the officers and men under my command during the past winter, in
consequence of their results not always bearing directly on the subject of the
expedition, whilst it is a pleasing duty for me to assure their Lordships of the
continued zeal and assiduity with which each officer and man has continued to
perform, not only the duties of his station, but also in carrying out the objects
I had in view for the furtherance of the important service on which we are
employed. Often opposed by strong winds and snow drift in a temperature from
20 deg. to 40 deg. below Zero (Fahrenheit), and frequently obliged to pass whole
nights in the snow; and in their intercourse with the natives displaying a firm-
ness and conciliatory manner toward them, which has obviated anything like ill-
will or misunderstanding on their part.
On the 13th of July I determined upon burying a quantity of provisions on
the sandy spit of Ghamisso Island, for the relief of any parties that might possibty
arrive during my visit to the northward, and on the 14th landed the following
species, with directions on the face of a rock where they were to be found; viz.,
biscuit, 1601b5.; flour, 2801b5.; salt beef, 2081b5.; pork, 2081b5.; and preserved
meats, 208 lbs, A large quantity of ice still remained in the sound on the even-
ing of the 15th, when a boat arrived from Her Majesty’s ship “Herald,” (off
Cape Espenberg), that ship being unable to push through the pack, which had
detained me. The next morning I weighed (the ice having opened during the
night), and at noon met the “ Herald” about 10 miles to the westward, when
I returned with her to Ghamisso. I then received their Lordships’ letter of the
14th December 1849, directing me to the Sandwich Islands, to refit and await
further orders.
Having informed Captain Kellett, c.b., of the reports which I had received
during the past winter relative to strangers having been on the coast, I requested
him to allow me to proceed to the northward, for the purpose of obtaining any
further intelligence of them, which he immediately granted, and on the 17th
Juty I sailed, arriving off Point Hope on the morning of the 20th. I buried a
letter of information for Captain Collinson, c.b., acquainting him with the posi-

tion of the “ Herald ” and my proceedings, after which I bore up for Icy Cape,
off which place I arrived on the 23d, when, accompanied by Mr. H. Martin,
second master, Mr. C. W. Stevenson, master’s assistant, 11 men and two boats,
I left for Point Barrow. Lieutenant Cooper being in charge of the “ Plover,”
with instructions where to rendezvous, as had been previously arranged by
Captain Kellett and myself.
I felt a good deal of anxiety after leaving the “Plover,” in consequence of the
few hands left on board, Commander Pullen’s party and ray own having reduced
the number down to 26, officers included; but on the morning of the 9th of
August I was delighted to see her standing into Wainwright Inlet, at which
place I had arrived four days previous, when I was informed that Commander
M'Clure in the “ Investigator ” had been spoken with, from whom Lieutenant
Cooper received “the Book” in which is published their Lordships’ orders to
Captain Collinson, c.b. Having a strong N, E. breeze I made the best of my
way in the “ Plover ” to Cape Lisburne ( the appointed rendezvous), to communi-
cate the result of my inquiries to Captain Kellett, which I now beg to lay before-
their Lordships.
The weather being fine on the day I left the “ Plover” (23d July), I got into
Wainwright Inlet the same afternoon, and rested the people in the evenings
within two miles of Point Belcher. Shortly after leaving this place I met several-
natives, who told me they had seen a vessel with two masts about a month
previous, but I placed no reliance on this statement, as the report had evidently
been circulated amongst them by other natives that I was in search of two ships,-
and I could see their only motive was to obtain a present of tobacco. On the
24th I arrived at the second Seahorse Island (going north), on which I buried
210 lbs. of preserved meat, 128 lbs. pemican, 13 lbs. cocoa, and 19 lbs. sugar,.
and erected a post on the western extreme of this island, on which is marked
directions for finding the provisions. On the 26th I reached a small river in
lat. 71 deg. 11 min. N. ,* long. 156 deg. 52 inin. 34 sec. W., where I found
the provisions buried by Mr. Shedden, owner of the R. T. Y. C. schooner
“Nancy Dawson” last summer. They remained undisturbed, the post only,
which marked the spot, being partly destroyed by the natives; I did not of course
remove them.
On my arrival at Point Barrow on the 27th, I was received by the natives in
the most friendly manner possible, not only expressing themselves glad to see
us, but assisting the boats’ crews in tracking up the boats from a point about two
miles below the village. Parties of natives had followed me up the whole
length of coast from Wainwright Inlet, with whom I was in constant communi-
cation, but although every inquiry was made relative to the people reported to
have been at Point Barrow during the past winter, nothing could be ascertained.
I then commenced my interrogatory, when I was informed that a number of
people “ like ourselves ” had arrived at a river called the Ko-pak (when I was
unable to discover); that they had bartered their arms for food, were now dead
and buried by the natives there. On my further questioning them as to the
manner of their deaths, they appeared reluctant to answer me. I then offered
one of them a musket and a quantity of tobacco to guide me to the spot where
they were buried, but he, as well as all the others of his tribe refused, excusing
themselves by saying, that there were no huts on the journey at which they
could stop. From what I can understand, the river Ko-pak must be close to the
Mackenzie.
Finding I could obtain no satisfactory or definite information from these
people, relative to this widely circulated report, I pushed on to Dease Inlet, and
to 154 deg. 59 min. W. longitude, in hopes of meeting other natives who might
be more communicative on the subject, but to my great disappointment found
they had all left, on which I made the best of my way back to the “ Plover,” for
the purpose of obtaining a reinforcement of men, boats, and provisions, to enable
me to proceed to the Mackenzie, in order to ascertain, if possible, who these
people were, that were reported to have met their deaths near that river.
The weather continuing favourable, I was at the northernmost of the Sea-
Horse Islands on the 3d August, where I met several natives, one of whcpn had
a knife similar to the common English horn-handled table knife ; he said he
had bartered it from some people belonging to a vessel (most probably a whaler),
when, or on what part of the coast I could not find out.
On the sth I arrived at Wainwright Inlet; here I met a large number of
natives belonging to that place, who had just arrived from a bartering expedition
to


to the northward, from whom I received further information respecting the boats
that were said to have arrived at the Ko-pak.
They told me that the crews had quarrelled with the natives, who then shot
them with arrows and stabbed them with knives till they were all killed, after
which they were buried, some on one side of the river, and the remainder the
other, and that the natives had collected the arms which were represented to me
as making a large pile. They also told me that one of the boats still remained
at the Ko-pak, but the other had been washed away by the sea.
I beg also to inform their Lordships that after passing to the eastward of Point
Barrow I discovered several islands, similar in appearance to the Sea Horse
Islands, on three of which I landed, and took possession of the whole, with the
usual ceremonies, calling them the “ Plover’s Group,” intending with their Lord-
ships’ permission to name them individually after the officers of this ship, as a
mark of the high opinion 1 entertain of their merits, which I have the honour to
request their Lordships will be pleased to grant. On one of these I observed
tracks of sledges, trending to the north-east.
The natives also told me of the existence of a large island, east by south, true
of Point Barrow, about two days’ journey. This range of islands, with a close
heavy pack which I found in the vicinity, together with the shallowness of the
water, induced me to express my opinion to Captains Kellett and Collinson, that
it was impossible under the then existing circumstances for any vessel to pass to
the eastward. The deepest water I could find between the islands and the main
as well as close to the pack edge, never exceeded 11 fms., six to eight miles off
the land, nor could I see the smallest portion of water to the northward and east-
ward, or I should have extended ray voyage in that direction.
Having made Captain Kellett acquainted with the above circumstances, I pro-
posed to him that the “ Plover ” should be placed in a spot at Point Barrow,
which I had found available, where I could receive the provisions, &c., intended
to complete this ship till the autumn of 1853 and store them, and where she would
be altogether safer on the breaking up of the ice than in Kotzebue Sound, and
that I should start with an expedition to the Mackenzie River, which 1 con-
ceived might be done with every probability of being able to return before the
winter could set in. But inconsequence of Captain Kellett’s being of opinion, that,
by accompanying this ship to Point Barrow, he would endanger the “ Herald’s ”
being beset, or driven on the fiats to the eastward, and the impossibility of taking
on board the provisions necessary to victual my crew, and any parties that might
arrive during the next three years, the idea of wintering at Point Barrow was
abandoned. Had not the season been too far advanced to dispatch the boats from
Wainwright Inlet, to anticipate the prospect of their return the same season
(which I considered should be done, if possible, to obviate the risk of distressing
the Hudson Bay posts on the Mackenzie, by the addition of a large party) I
should have proposed starting them from that place.
The 15th of August having arrived, without hearing any tidings of Captain
Collinson, c.b., in the “ Enterprise,” and feeling it to be of the greatest import-
ance that he should be met with as soon as possible, I requested Captain Kellett
to allow me to run over the line between Cape Lisburne and East Cape, the one
he would most likely take ; that I should then communicate with any whalers
that might be in the straits, and in the event of receiving any information rela-
tive to him, return to the rendezvous off Cape Lisburne with the intelligence. But
if on the contrary I could hear nothing of the “ Enterprise” I might proceed to
Kotzebue Sound, and in a convenient spot bury such provisions as might be
thought necessary for any party or parties during the next winter, together with
a letter stating where the “ Plover” might be found, and the extent of my re-
sources; that I should also leave this ship’s pinnace, provided with all the
necessary gear, in a sheltered place, to meet a similar contingency; and after
this service had been performed to permit me to go to Grantley Harbour, Port
Clarence, to winter, as I did not consider the ship could again winter in Kotzebue
Sound without almost certain destruction. Permission in accordance with this
requisition was immediately granted, and on the 15th August I sailed from Cape
Lisburne, spoke two whalers near East Cape, the master of one, the “ Alice,” of
Cold Spring, informing me that he had instructions from the American govern-
ment to assist Sir John Franklin should he fall in with him; but as nothing
could be heard of the “ Enterprise ” I stood into the sound, and arrived off Cha-
misso Island on the 23d August; from whence, after burying 208 lbs. of pre-
-9- E served

served meats, 256 lbs. of pemican, 560 lbs. of flour, 36 lbs. mixed cocoa and
sugar, 9 lbs. of tea, and 18 lbs. of sugar, on the sandy spit of that island, leaving
directions on the face of a rock as to where the provisions might be found, and
fitting the pinnace, I again sailed on the 26th, and arrived in this harbour on
the 30th of August.
Grantley Harbour is in every respect preferable to Kotzebue Sound for winter-
ing in, being of less extent, and well sheltered by high land from the severe
northerly and easterly winds. The ship’s position is on the north side, about
two miles and a half from the entrance, where the tides and currents are scarcely
perceptible, and where the nature of the soil close to the beach is favourable for
building.
On the IstSeptemberHerMajesty’s ship “ Enterprise” arrived, when I received
the copy of their Lordships’ letter (dated 16 March 1850) to Captain Kellett,
directing him to express their approbation of the proceedings of this ship, which
I feel assured will, if possible, add to the zeal with which every exertion will be
made to carry out their Lordships’ views in respect to the search after Sir John
Franklin.
I beg to forward to their Lordships copies of Captain Kellett’s instructions to
me since his arrival in Kotzebue Sound, in July 1850.
I have, &c.

Enclosure 1 to No. 4. (B.)
Her Majesty’s Ship “ Herald,” Kotzebue Sound,
Sir, 17 July 1850.
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant,
deposited for me in a bottle on Chamisso Island, informing me of a native story,
stating that some people were encamped in the vicinity of Point Barrow, and
acquainting me of your intention to go north, and of your return to this anchorage
after the performance of this service.
I have also to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this day’s date, refer-
ring me to your former letter, and requesting permission to go north to clear up
this mystery.
As soon as your vessel is in all respects ready, you will proceed with all possible
dispatch to Point Hope, on the western extreme of which you will deposit a bottle
containing information relative to your movements, and of the arrival and move-
ments of this ship, with which you will acquaint Captain Collinson, should you
fall in with him.
From thence you will approach as near to Point Barrow as the ice will permit
with safety from being beset, and you will endeavour, in the boats, to reach Point
Barrow, where you will more than probable be able to ascertain whether the
information you gleaned from the natives has been true or otherwise. Should
you be convinced that no foundation has existed for their reports, you will return
to your vessel at one of the rendezvous indicated.
Before leaving the “ Plover,” you will direct the officer remaining in com-
mand to proceed to the first off-shore rendezvous ; but should the ice be so far
south as not to admit of his taking up a position there, he will go on to the second
off-shore rendezvous; and should that also prove an ineligible position, he will
proceed to the third off-shore and ultimate rendezvous.
Having remained at either of these places 10 days from the time of your
leaving with the boats, he will (should the weather permit) sail for the first
in-shore rendezvous; but should that be found a bad position for the ship, he
will advance as near to the second in-shore rendezvous as the water will permit;
and afterwards into any of these rendezvous as frequently as the weather will
allow, being careful to use every means in his power, by firing guns and otherwise,
to show the “ Plover’s” position to the boats for which he is on the look-out.
As I have made you acquainted with the sailing from England of the “ Inves-
tigator” and the “ Enterprise,” under the command of Captain Richard Collin-
son, c.b., and of their probable arrival in these seas before the Ist of Aughst, you
will keep a vigilant look-out for those vessels, following Captain Collinson’s
orders (should you fall in with hitti) for your further proceedings; always bear-
ing in mind, that Her Majesty’s ship “ Herald ” will be found until the 10th of
September


September west of Cape Lisburne, and after that time, until it is time to leave
these seas, off Chamisso Island.
As you are aware of their Lordships’ instructions relative to the necessity of
any boats which may be dispatched, returning in sufficient time to ensure their
vessel’s timely return to the southward, I have only to trust to your known zeal
and ability for the performance of this duty.

Her Majesty’s Ship “ Herald,” off Cape Lisburne,
Sir, 14 August 1850.
In reply to your letter of this day’s date, I beg to state that I fully concur with
you as to the lateness of the present season for dispatching a second boat expedi-
tion to endeavour to find out the place where a party of white men are reported
by the natives to have been murdered. '
I conceive so large a party as that you think necessary to proceed would
embarrass for provisions any party which may be sent from the “ Enterprise ”
or “ Investigator,” which vessels are I see expected to send parties to the
Mackenzie.
The boats might reach the Mackenzie by making a run for it, yet I do not
fancy they would have time to make the necessary examination of the inden-
tations of the coast, to find out a place so ill-defined as it appears to me from
all I can learn is the Kopuk.
With respect to your wintering at Point Barrow, you will state to me for their
Lordships’ information, whether you consider that the “ Plover ” would be
enabled to leave Point Barrow, on the breaking up of the ice on the ensuing
season.
By their Lordships’ instructions to Captain Collinson, 15th January 1850, I
am directed, exclusive of providing for other contingencies, to victual the
“ Plover” up to the autumn of 1853. You will, therefore, as this ship cannot
reach Point Barrow, inform me how near to the above proportion you can now
receive here, together with the number of men you will require to enable you t<?
perform the service referred to in your letter.
Wherever you may be placed, any boats, stores, &c., that you may require,,
shall be furnished from the ship. I enclose a list of the quantities of provisions,
&c., which the “ Herald” can spare.
I have, &c.

In consequence of our this morning’s conference, and in order to carry out the

ceed toward East Cape, and there endeavour to fall in with some of the whalers,
from whom it is more than probable you will get information respecting the
“ Enterprise.”
Should you obtain any intelligence which you consider I ought to be acquainted
with, you will return to this rendezvous, where I shall remain until the Ist of Sep-

a proportion of provisions sufficient for any parties who may arrive there during
the ensuing winter; and also to deposit distinct information as to where they are
to be found, and also of the “ Plover’s ” intended winter quarters; you will also
leave the boat and her fittings referred to in your letter.
After performing this service you will proceed to Grantley Harbour, make
good your defects, and erect a house for the reception of provisions, &c.
Ten men will be sent to assist you from this ship.

JOURNAL of the PROCEEDINGS of Commander T. E. L. Moore, of Her
Majesty’s Ship “Plover,” accompanied Mr. H. Martin, Second Master,
and Mr. C. W. Stevenson, Master’s Assistant, on a Boat Expedition to Point
Barrow from Icy Cape, between the 23d July and 9th August 1850.
23d July 1850. —At 0.45 p.m. I started from the ship with two boats; the
launch, 22 feet, and the gig, 22 feet, with two officers (Messrs. Martin, second
master, and Stevenson, master’s assistant), the interpreter, and 11 men. I had
not proceeded far when a biadar was seen coming towards us, which came
alongside. After conversing with them, I could gain no information respecting
the two missing ships. They kept alongside until we came abreast of their tents,
when they parted ; we, having a S. S. E. wind, went along the land very fast;
passed two small inlets, good shelter for boats, and a stream of heavy ice to the
westward. At sp. m. arrived atWainwright Inlet, where we found 21 tents,
and a great number of natives. They had taken their abode on the south side,
so I took the north, but was soon favoured with their company, I had a
long interview with them, but no information could be gained from them of Sir
John Franklin or his people; evidently they had not heard a word about them.
I made them presents, and we bartered some venison from them.
They became very troublesome, thieving all they could, so, after refreshment,
we started. They followed us some distance.
After we had got about 2 J miles from the entrance of Wainwright Inlet, I
observed a lagoon, which had a small outlet. As we proceeded we found the ice
closer in shore and packing. There was still a great quantity of heavy ice and
snow on the beach; fine, but threatening sky. Off Point Belcher heavy packed
ice was seen from W. S. W. to N. N. W., ice on the move, roaring very loud.
About two miles from Point Belcher, a biadar, containing about 12 natives,
came off, but no information could be obtained of Sir John Franklin. Ice appa-
rently closing the shore. Landed at 0.45 a.m., and made preparations for hauling
the boats up if requisite; pitched tent. I gave the men a few hours’sleep;
natives very quiet: dark, cloudy, rainy looking sky.
24th. —At Ba. m., started; the surf was beginning to rise; heavy packed ice
outside. The barometer showed 29*85; we proceeded close in shore. Off Point
Belcher the ice was closely packed, leaving a small lane in shore. Natives came
off; bartered their venison and several other things. Wind N.W., light and
variable, with a little rain; we tried to get the natives to accompany us to the
Seahorse Islands, but they soon left. They said that they had heard of, or seen
a vessel, one moon ago, with two masts; but their account was evidently false,
merely for gain. At 2. 30 p. m. came in sight of the Seahorse Islands. There
was not enough water for the boats between the first island and the main;
but we found 12 and 14 feet on going in between the first and second islandfe.
Landed at 3. 40 p. m.; pitched tent, it being thick, foggy, rainy weather; the
barometer showed 29*85 ; temperature, 46 deg. Dug a hole and buried 210 lbs.

of preserved meats, 128 lbs. pemican, lbs. sugar, 13 £ lbs. cocoa, for any
coming along the coast, on the second island (it has hummocks on it),
placing a mark on the western extreme to indicate the spot.
25th. —Fine breeze, S. S.W.; misty, foggy, wet; at 6 a.m. started; obliged
to go over to the S. W. bank, as the channel ran along that shore, steering
N. E. 3 E.; barometer showed 29*84; temperature, 46 degrees. We ran until
about 11 a.m., when we found ourselves close to the northernmost Seahorse
Islands, and very shoal water, which obliged us to pull two miles to the
southward to get through, having only two feet water. These can scarcely be
called islands; they are no more than sand banks, covered with heavy ice, about
eight and ten feet high, and only here and there the bank is seen. We moored
at Peard Bay, at 0. 30 p. ra.; heavy packed ice outside; steering N. W. through
heavy sailing ice. Observed some beach ice, newly formed, in a bight of a floe.
•3. 30 p. m. came to in Safety Inlet, in Peard Bay; safe shelter for boats. Went
in and erected a post to give notice to any parties that should arrive that we had
gone on. At 4. 15 p. m. started; passed two small inlets, apparently good
shelter for boats. sp. m. wind falling light, obliged to pull. The cliffs here
are all frozen, the same as at Kotzebue Sound, and the surface of them, as they
thawed, was falling. As we passed, land trending N. by W. 10. 45 p. m., came
to Refuge Inlet; pitched tent, and gave the men rest, they requiring it very
■much after so many hours pulling; boats just inside the entrance, in safety from
the ice.
26th.—Barometer showed 29*97; temperature, 40 degrees; land trending
N. N. W. \ W.; wind N. W. 3, misty, cloudy ; erected a post to give in-
formation. 7. 30, a biadar with natives arrived; no information could be
gained from them of any vessels. 8 a. m. started ; pulling and tacking along
the land and heavy ice. At 11. 50 a. m. came to a small river; boats went
just inside the mouth; latitude 71° 11'N.; bartered some venison from the
natives. This is the place the provisions were buried from the “ Nancy
Dawson ” last year. I saw the place; they had not been disturbed; but the post
had been cut down and was still lying close to its place, with part of the letters
.cut off; we erected another. 1. 20 p. m. we started, beating up the land. At
7p. m. observed an inlet; natives came off; they informed us that there was
plenty of water for the boats to go in, but time would not allow. No informa-
tion of Sir John could be obtained. At Bp. m. heavy land floes in sight from
Cape Smyth ; not able to proceed further, on account of the land floe, and heavy
packed ice. Stood in shore, and anchored under its lee. Cape Smyth N. W.
by N., two miles; wind north. About 50 natives came and sat down on the
beach, waiting for us to land ; they received us differently from those that I have
- generally seen; they all sat down in a line, and when I landed I passed along
the line and shook them all by the hand, and afterwards gave them presents;
they could give no intelligence of any ships or men, but they said that the ice
was close in shore, and that we must stand out to seaward, where we should find
water. A great many natives came in from the northward to visit us.
27th.—The barometer showed 29*84; temperature, 39 degrees; wind N. E. ;
fine breeze; cloudy, and very chilly. At 6, 30 a. m. weighed and made sail,
running clear of the land floe ; natives running along the land dancing,
singing, and beating the drum; land floe extending to about 2 | miles to
the northward of Cape Smyth; beating up to Point Barrow, and passing heavy
floes of ice. Observed several large flocks of birds migrating to the south ; wind
freshening, landed the men on the low land, about three miles from Point
"Barrow. Commenced tracking the boats up; a great number of natives came
and assisted. At 6. 30 p. m. anchored in a small bay at the N, E. end of Point
Barrow. Numerous natives on shore; I should say not less than 300. I pitched
my tent; the natives then sat down around it. Then presents were given to
them. One native gave information that a number of people like ourselves had
arrived at a river called Coo-pack, at what time I could not ascertain; that they
had bartered their muskets for food, were now dead, and had been buried by the
natives there; also that when the water came down, the ship or boat was washed
away. No reliance could be placed on this report, as the man who gave the
infoi’mation, several times whilst giving it, would stop and ask for or inquire
what something or other was. I offered him muskets and a large quantity of
97- -E 3 tobacco*

tobacco to pilot us to where the ship or boat had been seen, and where the mem
were buried ; but he would not go, stating there was no stopping places on the
road. I made up my mind to go on and seek more natives to the eastward of
Point Barrow for information, although they told me I should find none along the
coast. They have a separate house for dancing. After being there some few
hours I found them troublesome, and when I had been asleep about an hour,
1 was startled by hearing the noise of beads, and when I looked up there was a
man creeping in under the tent who had stolen a great many beads ; I got up,
when he soon retreated, and I saw no more of him.
28th.—The barometer showed 29’70; temperature, 56; wind north, 4 to 5.
At 6. 30 a. m., finding the natives inclined to be troublesome, got under weigh and
stood out; the gig being last in coming out, they took the advantage then of
throwing water at the boat, which, if they had persisted in, I should have returned
to them. In rounding Point Barrow, found four fathoms about one mile off-shore,
and two fathoms close in shore. Working up in shore. 11. 40 a. m., came to an
island ; Point Barrow bore W. 1° 30' S.; latitude of island, 71° 26' N.; erected a
post to give information ; found a strong current setting to the eastward from
2 to 2h miles per hour. After doing all I wished at the island, 00. 30 p. im
started, tacking as requisite to weather floes of ice, apparently lately broken
up; passed a second island. Three fathoms, about two miles off shore ; heavy
packed ice to the N. E,; ice blink to the N. (true); running along the land;
packed ice from 4to 1 i miles off shore; scattered floes of ice here and, there;
about 1 \ mile off shore 2 i fathoms; fresh breeze, but smooth water; large,
heavy, and long spars on the beach-to the northward, and land higher. 3, came
to the fourth island. I called these the “ Plover’s Group.”
Between the first and main, I got eight and nine fathoms through the channel;
from the N. E. point of third island, carried llto I to the beach. 5. 30 p. tm
landed; pitched tent in Dease Inlet, in a snug cove in the N. E. side of the bay;
made a large fire to dry wet clothes, there being plenty of wood,
29th. —Wind N. E.; barometer showed 29 - 74; temperature, 42 degrees.
At 5. 15 a. m. started, running along the land to the N. E. 7, came to a
small inlet; good shelter; tacked as requisite, working up along the land
and packed ice. At 10 a. m., about three miles from the shore ; the depth of
water Isto 1 £ fathom ;in shore 1J fathom ; five miles off the land, 1 | fathom ;
2\ miles from the shore 1 J fathom; carried that until close to the shore.
Observed land to the N. N. W; stood over, and found it to be two islands, one
small, and one very large. I landed on the small one to obtain the latitude;
found it to be 71 deg. 13 min, N.; a great many nests on the island : erected a
post to give information. At 0.15 p. m. started, beating to the northward and
eastward. The first island I called Martin’s Island, and the large one Cooper’s
Island, after the officers of the ship. Numerous flocks of birds migrating to the
southward; two miles to the north-eastward of Cape Simpson 11 fathom ; heavy
packed ice to the north-eastward. 4. 45 p. m. wind freshening, and threatening
weather, and sea rising, and the gig shipping much water; bore up for shelter,
but finding the islands not safe, I ran back for Dease Inlet, or, as I have
called it, Return Cove; very wet and cold; wind N. E,; force, 7to 8;.
squally, I found, when I stood over to the packed ice, that there was no more
water than 1 | fathom; that must have been five to six miles off the land. I
fancy for some distance that the water runs off shoal, and many islands may be
discovered in this quarter. The men being wet and cold, made a good fire and
dried themselves.
30th.—Latitude 71 deg. 11 min. 18 sec.; longitude 155 deg. 46 min., strong
breezes and cloudy; barometer, 29’46 ; temperature, 45 deg.; too much sea
for the boats to start; sent parties away shooting; wind on the increase, and
more to the north-eastward; force 8, and very cold. Finding no chance of a
start, and the barometer remaining low, made all snug for the night.
31st.—Strong breezes and cloudy, force of wind, 8; sea increasing in the bay;,
wind N. N. E.; barometer 29 - 63 ; temperature, 44. The land all round about
here very low, with small pools all over it. One stream running inland in the
N.E. part of the inlet, but not sufficient water for the boats. Very few birds
to be seen. A very fine owl was shot yesterday, and two hares were seen. In
the evening a little snow fell and laid on the ground; blowing strong; ice
coming in.


Ist August.—More moderate ; barometer 29 , 96 ; temperature, 40 ; preparing
for a start; wind N. E. ; intending to work to the northward and eastward of
the island called Cooper’s, and see what water there is outside, and how far we
can proceed in that direction. 7. 30 a, m. started ; standing out; temperature at
midnight, 28 J; ponds frozen over, and a great deal of snow fell. 9a. m. observed
an island bearing north ; when about five or six miles off the land, the island bore
N. E.; about 3 J miles off, 1 i and 11 fathoms ; observed four other islands bear-
ing W., W. N. W., N. E., E. N. E.; a very large quantity of wood on the islands;
between second and third islands carried one fathom from one mile off shore to
within 10 yards of the beach, then found seven feet. At 11 a.m. landed on third
island for the latitude ; erected a post; latitude 71 deg. 15 min. 40 sec. N. At
10.15 p. m. started, steering E. J N., running along the islands, four in number.
At la. m. about four miles off Cape Simpson, one fathom. Tacked a quarter
of a mile off. 3, beating up between Cooper’s and Martin’s islands and the
main; a strong current setting to the N. W. 6. 30, breeze freshening
rapidly, and the gig shipping too much water, and finding not the slightest
chance for a boat to penetrate to the N. E., or to pass the islands, there being
not a particle of water to be seen from them, not in any direction, except close
in shore. I also observed a strong ice blink from N. N. W. to E. by S. I bore
up for Point Barrow. Landed on Cooper’s Island, and took possession of the
group in the name of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria. 8. 30 p.m.
started, steering for Point Barrow.
2d.—Wind E. N.E.; fine. 3a. m. observed Point Barrow. At 3. 45, a. m.
observed that we were inside of Plover’s Island. In all sail, and pulled up
between the main and first island ; point of spit S. W.; 2 \ fathoms. 4. 30 a. m.
anchored off Point Barrow to obtain information, also to get sight; found
current running 1 1 to the southward, latitude by mer. alt. 71° 26' 23''.
At 7. 30 a, m. weighed; running along the land; two natives in their kyacks
accompanied us for about six miles; fine breeze and weather. Numerous
whales in sight, but very few birds to be seen, except at times large flocks
migrating to the southward ; offing remarkably clear of ice. 00 h. 00 m., came
to a large lagoon with two small outlets, not water enough for the boats ; this is
to the southward of Cape Smyth. 1 p.m. started, having got the latitude; and
some venison; running along the land at four, five, and three knots; passed Refuge
Inlet at 2. 30 p. m. (evidently the water had subsided since my going north
more than three feet, as I found all the inlets I had entered before now dry); no
water for boats to enter; passed the two small inlets.
At 7. 15 p. m. passed Safety Inlet; found this the same ; impossible for any
boat to get into it; wind falling light; running across Peard Bay; a great
quantity of snow and ice still on the beach ; ice cliffs falling away. 8, calm;
strong current against us ; obliged to pull; just forging ahead.
'3d.—At 3a. ra. spliced main brace, the men having had hard work; passed
through the channel of the first and second island. Finding the men much
fatigued, I pulled for the nearest shore.
At 4. 30 a.m. landed in the bay to the southward of the first island ; pitched
tent. 00. 00 p. m.; started for Provision Island; found provisions all correct.
At 10 p.m. barometer 30‘50; six natives arrived in a biadar with venison for
barter ; bartered, and sent them back for more.
4th. —Light airs from northward, misty, clqudy; barometer, 30‘49. At 4 a.m.
natives arrived, bringing more venison. 7.30 a.m. started; misty, light airs
from the northward; every appearance of a S. W. wind. At 11 a.m. found
current setting strong against us; obliged to track; found it very heavy work;
no ice in sight. OOh. opm. p.m. light westerly wind ; working down along the.
land. 1 p.m. pulling and tracking down; natives came off, but could not wait,

Observed the “ Plover” in the offing. At 2 a.m. made a large fire as signal
to “ Plover” that we had arrived. Natives gave information that two boats-
had arrived at a river named by them Coo-pom-me, and that the natives there
had shot them with bows and arrows, and stabbed and buried them, but that
one boat was still there. At 4.15 heard the report of a gun from “ Plover;”
tacked and shortened sail. Natives came over. There are six huts here;
they having no biadar, they were obliged to lash three kyacks together and
come across. It was so much the better for us. sa. m., the wind having been
light from W. and S. W., freshened, and came on to blow hard, with heavy
rain, surf, and breakers running high; found it impossible to pass the bar;
breakers from the spit to the main land. Found the natives too numerous, and
getting troublesome. I got all ready for a start. At 2. 30 p. m., shifted our berth
over to the west side; but we had not been there long before they came ; being
few in numbers they were obliged to keep quiet, stealing everything they
could see, and having a strong desire for tobacco; they barter their women for
that article. 3p. m., barometer 29-85-46 ; surf roaring very loud.
6th.—Wind south ; thick, foggy, misty; surf outside still roaring loud ; baro-
meter 29-86-45. I took a walk to see if the “ Plover” was in sight, but she
was not to be seen. Surf running heavily, impossible for any boat to pass the
bar; occasional showers of rain. In the evening a biadar came with natives;.
heavy rain for about two hours; tide rose very suddenly, nearly up to the tent.
The natives pitched their tent close to us, for the accommodation of the men, P
suppose. They took their departure at midnight; the barometer rose suddenly
to 30-00. I made inquiries of a woman, if she knew anything regarding the
boats and men that are said to have been killed at the Coo-pem-me, and she said.
“ No;” and it was from her party that the men told us the-news.
7th.—Squally, with passing showers; barometer, at Ba. m., 30‘58'47; wind
W. S. W.; heavy surf across the bar; not able to get out, and the ship not in.
sight. Men collecting scurvy grass. Dispatched Mr. Martin and the gig to-
survey and examine the river supposed to run up from the inlet. Barometer at
noon, 30*73 - 59 ; wind more moderate. Several natives arrived overland to visit
us. Soon afterwards two biadars arrived. They soon began to be troublesome,
they being by far the greatest in number; I therefore got everything into the
boats, and started off to see if it was possible to get over the bar. When I got
out found the surf very heavy, quite impossible for the gig to get over; but the
launch might have stood it, although attended with much danger. The current
was setting to the N. E., with a strong breeze. I could scarcely get back again.
Could see nothing of the “ Plover.” I returned to my old spot, and soon after-
wards the natives came again; but they found I was determined to keep them
in order, so they were very well afterwards, and in the evening much dancing
and singing. The natives were very much amused at seeing Mr. Stevenson:
having a swim, the first they had ever seen, so their astonishment may be ima-
gined. Mr. Martin returned about 7. 30 p. m., having gone up the river about
17 miles, and reports it to be a very extensive and large river; as far as he went,
it averaged five miles wide, water deep, quarter less three fathoms, the river
trending to the southward. I had one of the native women in to gain informa-
tion, as I find I can get more from them than the men.
I wished to know if she knew of any land to the northward of Point Bar-
row. She then drew me a chart, and placed a large island to the E. N. E. of
Point Barrow. They have to sleep one night on the snow to get there. No
inhabitants on it.
Bth.—Strong breezes, with passing showers of rain. Observed that the natives
had quitted their abode, and we supposed gone up the river. Finding no chance
of getting off to the ship, I sent the boats away shooting. They returned pretty
successful.
9th. —At 5 a.m. got under weigh, and ran down with a S. E. wind to the
mouth of the inlet. All ready to start off to the “Plover.” At 11 a.m.
Plover” hove in sight, coming down close along the land.
Started off' for ditto; anchored; arrived on board “ Plover” at half-past 12.
Glad to find every one well on board. I was then informed of their having seeu
ihe “ Investigator” on the 29th July, off Cape Lisburne.”

COPY of a LETTER from Captain Kellett, of Her Majesty’s Ship “Herald,” to
the Secretary of the Admiralty.
Her Majesty’s Ship “ Herald,” Honolulu,
Sir, 17 October 1850.
I have the honour to forward the medical report on the officers and crew of
Her Majesty’s ship “ Plover,” together with the surgeon’s letter on the health
of Mr. Johns, carpenter, which officer I have removed, and filled his vacancy by
an acting appointment to John Seath, late carpenter’s mate of this ship.
I have also to transmit a letter from Mr. Simpson (surgeon), assistant surgeon
of “ Plover,” requesting that I would order him to be borne as surgeon of that
ship. 1 found by their Lordships’ circular that I had not the power to do so,
but I have no hesitation in stating that Mr. Simpson is most worthy of the pro-
motion their Lordships have conferred on him, and to which I feel they intended
to confirm him.
With respect to the health of the “ Plover’s” crew at present, I have removed
all that the surgeon recommended ; but still, after a man has twice wintered in
the ice, his health cannot be depended on for a moment. A most healthy and
able man, whom I took up to her last year, I have been obliged this year to
■withdraw, for this reason : I consider it actually necessary that the “ Plover”
should be communicated with yearly, should their Lordships deem it necessary
to keep her in her present position until 1853. My letter relative to her provisions
is another reason for visiting her.
Next season she will require a new tilt-cloth for housing in; canvas only-
lasts a year.
Should their Lordships communicate with her, by sending one of Her Majesty's
ships from the Pacific, I consider a steamer could perform the service with expedi-
tion, safety and certainty, with little expense of fuel; one day through the Aleutian
group, and one day when she arrived within that distance of Port Clarence; but
whatever vessel goes, she should be prepared to replace both men and officers.
Should their Lordships wish to risk placing her at Point Barrow, a steamer
could perform the service with less risk of being beset than any sailing vessel
large enough to assist in carrying her necessary supplies.
The communication between this and Chili is so uncertain that it is more
Ilian probable these letters will reach the Admiralty before they can the Com-
mander-in-chief in the Pacific.
I have, &c.

COPY of Captain Collinson’s Orders to Commander Moore, of Her Majesty”s
Ship “Plover;" dated 13 September 1850.
By Richard Collinson, Esq., C. B., Captain of Her Majesty’s Ship “Enterprise,"
Commanding the Arctic Expedition.
, Having determined, that Her: Majesty’s ship under my command could not be
placed in Grantley Harbour for the winter, without the certainty of her expe-
riencing considerable delay in extricating herself during the ensuing season, and
it being the opinion of Captain Kellett, as well as yourself, that vessels arriving
from the south are able to proceed northerly three weeks earlier than those
wintering, in. these harbours:
I have to acquaint you that it is my intention to proceed to Hong Kong after
I have visited Cape, Lisburne. Your demands have been completed, so far as
the stores of the “Herald ” and this vessel will permit, and those officers and
men who, in the opinion of the medical officers, are not fit to stand the rigour
of another winter in these seas, have been removed; and their Lordships’ orders
contained in paragraphs 7,8, 9, 10, and 11 of my instructions may be considered
as fulfilled. As it is, however, advisable that a means of communication should
be established, which may be readily effected by the “ Owen,” through the
whalers, and as those vessels are in the habit of visiting St. Lawrence Bay, I
shall acquaint their Lordships that the small islet in latitude 65 deg. 38 min. N.,
and longitude 170 deg. 43 min. W. will be the rendezvous for that purpose.
I cannot add.to the experience you have gained with regard to your proceed-
ings during the winter, but it is necessary that every means of obtaining native
information should be resorted to, and deposited on Point Spencer before the ice
breaks up, so that this vessel may not be delayed by endeavouring to commu-
nicate with you, which I shall endeavour to do before I proceed to the south,
and in my passage north next year.
In the event of the “ Investigator ” arriving previous to my return, you will
detain Captain M‘Clure until the season is so far advanced as to render it likely
that I have been compelled to run through the straits without seeing you, order-
ing her to proceed, to Hong Kong instead of Valparaiso ; and I wish that a series
of tidal observations, both in the inner and outer harbour, may be immediately
commenced, in order that, we may be better able to form an opinion as to the
advisability of placing that vessel in your position, which I should like to effect
if it can be done without detriment to our proceedings during the ensuing
season.

to the Secretary of the Admiralty.
Her Majesty’s Ship “Herald,” Singapore,
Sir, 6 January 1831.
I have the honour to report, for the information of my Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, the arrival of Her Majesty’s ship under my command at this
place, after a passage of eight days from Hong Kong.
I remained at the Sandwich Islands until the 30th October, but from the
many whaling vessels which arrived there subsequent to the date of my de-
spatches to their Lordships, I was unable to gain the slightest additional informa-
tion relative to the movements of Her Majesty’s ships “ Enterprise ” or “ Inves-
tigator.”
The bag of Admiralty despatches and the box of balloons which I found at
Oahee on my arrival, as well as all letters for either of the three ships, I conveyed
with me to Hong Kong, expecting to fall in with “ Enterprise ” at that place, but
failing to do so, and seeing no probability of her reaching there, I delivered
them all to the care of the Commander-in-chief, with a request that should she
not arrive by the 31st January, he would again forward them to Oahee by
the first opportunity, in order to ensure their being in time for any vessel which
their Lordships might think fit to despatch to the northward.
We arrived at Hong Kong on the Ist of December ; during our stay at that
port the “Herald ” was refitted, and completed with provisions, and made ready
in all respects for the homeward voyage. Sailing on the 22d ultimo, we arrived
at Singapore on the 30th, at which place our stay will be guided by the arrival
of the mail from England.
The Hong Kong steamer arrived last night, but up to the date of her leaving
on the 30th, the “Enterprise” had not been heard of.
So soon as the English mail arrives I shall proceed on my voyage, passing
through the Straits of Sunda, on my way to the Cape of Good Hope.

Fort Confidence, Great Bear Lake,
Sir, 1 September 1849.
I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information of my Lords Commis-
sioners of the Admiralty, that the expedition under my command, that descended
the Coppermine this summer to the Arctic Sea, for the purpose of examining the
shores of Wollaston and Victoria Lands to the northward, in search of Sir John
Franklin and party, returned to this place to-day, having been quite unsuccessful
in its object, and with the loss of Albert, the Esquimaux interpreter, who was
drowned at the Bloody Fall, the particulars of which unfortunate accident I shall
mention hereafter.
Having made every requisite arrangement at Fort Confidence for facilitating
our progress across land to the Coppermine, I waited impatiently for the disrup-
tion of the ice on Dease River, to which our boat was hauled on the 7th June.
.Next day we learned that the upper parts of the river were clear of ice; and on
the following morning I started in company with four men and two Indians, and
a couple of sledges on which our baggage and provisions were stowed. The
Dease was still covered with strong and solid ice for two miles up its course, over
which we hauled the boat before getting to open water.
Our ascent of the stream was extremely slow, owing to the many barriers of
ice (some of them six or eight miles long) over which we had to launch the boat,
and it was the 15th before we arrived at the forks of the river, where it was my
intention to diverge from the route of Dease and Simpson. They followed the
north branch, whilst we ascended the south-east one. This stream was also
much obstructed by ice, and so very shallow, consequent on the coldness of the
weather, which prevented the snow on the high grounds from thawing, that the
whole party were almost continually up to their knees among water and snow
whilst proceeding up it. In ordinary seasons it was evident, by marks along the
banks, that there is sufficient water for a boat drawing some inches more than
ours throughout its whole length, which is little more than 15 miles, including
its various curves. On the 17th we passed over the ice on the lake from which
the stream flows. It contains many islands, and its breadth, where we crossed it
in a nearly south direction, is 3} miles.
Indian report had led me to believe that there was a creek having sufficient
•depth of water for the boat, flowing from this lake into the south branch of the
Kendall, which we were to descend to the Dismal Lakes; but in this we were
.disappointed, and consequently had a portage of six geographical miles to make
overland nearly due east.
I had examined this place in the winter, but the ground being then covered
with snow and ice, I could not form a correct opinion on the subject.
The west end of the portage is situate in latitude 67 deg. 10 min. 48 sec. N.;
longitude by account* 117 deg. 18 min. W.; and the variation of the compass
50 deg. 49 min. E.
Crossing the portage occupied us two days; the ice had not yet broken up in
many places on the river on its east side, and the water was 10 inches lower than
when Sir John Richardson and party forded it last autumn; we consequently
found some difficulty in descending it. Its general course is N.E. by E. (tr.),
•and length from where we entered it, to its influx at the west end of the most
easterly of the Dismal Lakes, 17} miles.
On the 21st we arrived at the station on the banks of the Kendall River, to
which provisions for the sea voyage had been hauled on dog sleds in April, and
found the two men who had been left in charge quite well.
We descended the Kendall next day to the Coppermine, which was still
covered with ice, so firm and solid that a person might have crossed the river
without being more than ankle deep in water.

"Proceedings of
Dr. Rae and Com-
mander Pullen, r.n.
During five days that we were detained here, we were occupied repairing the
injuries received by the boat, shooting deer to preserve the pemican, and
making observations when the weather would permit.
The result of three meridian observations of the sun gave mean latitude 67 deg.
07. min. 20 sec. N., and the mean variation from five sets of azimuths on dif-
ferent days (the extremes being 49 deg. 38 min., and 51 deg. 55 min.) was
60 deg. 37 min. 48 sec, E.
On the 28th the dwarf birch was observed to be in leaf, and the leaf-buds of
the willows began to develope. In the afternoon of the same day the river was
thought sufficiently open to permit us to descend it for some distance among
the driving ice; but after proceeding six miles, we found the stream again
blocked up.
We were so often and so long detained by interruptions of this kind, that it
was the 11th July before we arrived at the Bloody Fall, having been 14 days in
doing the work of one.
Notwithstanding the inefficiency of our steersman James Hope (one of Dease
and Simpson’s men), we ran all the rapids, including the Escape, without ship-
ping much water, and with all the cargo in the boat.
Hitherto deer had been so numerous that we could easily have shot enough
for the maintenance of a party double or treble our numbers. Here they had
become more scarce and shy, which could be easily accounted for by the proxi-
mity of the Esquimaux, no recent traces of whom could however be seen.
From the fall to the sea the ice remained fixed until the 13th, when it cleared
away, a circumstance that was very soon indicated by the numbers of fish which
appeared below the fall. With the aid of Halkett’s air-boat, which had been
brought from a hill some miles distant, where it had been left last season, a net
was set in one of the eddies, and before the men had finished arranging it, seven
fine salmon and two white fish were caught, and we afterwards obtained a supply
for several days’ consumption.
On the 14th we entered the sea, and found a narrow and very shallow channel
along the shore of Richardson Bay, until we came to its north side, where the
ice lay against the rocks. Here the latitude 67 deg. 51 min. 19 sec. N. was
observed; and two azimuths of the sun, the one on the meridian and the
other when on the prime vertical, gave variation 57 deg. 04 min. and 56 deg.
25 min. E.
Whilst encamped at this place, we were visited by seven Esquimaux, one of
whom I at once recognised as the active, intelligent man who had afforded Sir
John Richardson’s party such efficient assistance last season, when crossing the
river at the head of Back’s Inlet.
On inquiry I learnt that they had been well supplied with provisions in the
early part of winter and in spring; but that in the interval they had nearly
starved, owing to the scarcity of seals, having had to subsist for some time on
the skins of the larger species of these animals, which they had been preserving
for making boots. In the winter they had communicated, either directly or
indirectly, with the natives of Wollaston Land, none of whom had ever seen
whites, large boats, or ships.
They were all made happy by some small presents, and a supply of fish, which
they ate raw, and appeared to relish much. They left us near midnight, pro-
mising to return next day with some boots and shoes for sale.
On the 16th, by making a number of portages over the ice, we rounded Point
Mackenzie and entered Back’s Inlet, which was partially open.
Having a fine breeze from east, we set sail and soon ran to its head, entered
Rae River (discovered and named by Sir John Richardson last autumn), and
on proceeding three miles up it, came to the lodges, six in number, of our
Esquimaux visitors, who said that they had been so much alarmed at seeing the
boat under sail that they were on the point of running away.
As there was no possibility of our making much progress along shore until
the ice wasted a little more, I devoted the two following days to an examination
of this river; the Esquimaux whom I have already mentioned as our active
assistant last year willingly agreeing to accompany us.
At


At the distance of 9 £ miles from the river’s mouth, there is a perpendicular
fall of 10 feet, which extends across the stream, except a few yards on the north
side, where the rock slopes so much that, during the spring-floods, salmon and
white fish are able to ascend, affording the natives a fine opportunity of spearing
them.
Here I left the boat and four of the men, whilst in company with the other two,
and our Esquimaux guide, I traced the river 19 J geographical miles further. Its
course is nearly due west, and very straight; about the size of the Dease River,
and varying in breadth from 80 to 200 yards, with a very strong current, and suffi-
cient depth of water for a boat drawing 14 or. 15 inches. It flows over a bed of
limestone, and is bounded on the north, at the distance of half a mile or less
from its banks, by precipices of basalt from,loo to 200 feet high, superimposing
limestone of the same kind as that which forms the bed of the river.
At the extreme west point of our journey, we found a party of ten Esquimaux
with their families, who informed us that the stream maintained the same course
and size as far as they had seen it, which was somewhat more than three days’
march, or about sixty miles; how much farther they knew not, as they had never
been to its source. Two of this party returned with us to the boat, where they
received some presents, which I had some difficulty in getting them to accept, as
they said they had nothing to give in return.
On the evening of the 18th we ran down stream, and: lauded our guide among
his friends, who seemed very glad to see him return safe. They were now much
less timid than when we first met them, and we pitched our tent close to theirs,
without causing any apparent alarm, although it was afterwards observed that
two of the men kept watch during the night.
Early on the 19th we took a friendly leave of these simple and inoffensive
people, and pulled down to the mouth of the river, where 1 stayed until noon,
when the latitude 67 deg. 55 min. 20 sec. N. was observed. The cloudy
state of the weather during the two preceding days had prevented any observa-
tions being made.. New moon occurring to-day, it was high water at a few
minutes before Ip. m.; the rise being ten inches. In the afternoon, when on
our way to Cape Kendall, we experienced a severe thunder-storm from N. N. W.
which obliged us to land for shelter.
Our advance along the coast was so slow, that we did not arrive at the place
where the boats were left last autumn until the 24th. We found that they had
been much broken up by the Esquimaux to obtain the ironwork. The tents,
oilcloths, and part of the sails still remained uninjured, and were of much value
to us, as we were ill-provided with the two first of these articles. The “ cache ”
of pemican and ammunition was also untouched, having apparently escaped
notice from being covered with snow. The latitude 68 deg. 10 min. 44 sec.
N., and variation 56 deg. 8 rain. E. were observed here.
On the 27th a W. N. W. breeze having cleared away the ice for a short dis-
tance from the shore, we continued our course towards Cape Hearne, which we
reached before noon, and found its extreme point to be in latitude 68 deg. 11 min.
17 sec. N. Basil Hall Bay being filled from side to side with unbroken ice,
we encamped here. Next forenoon a light S. S. E. breeze opened a crack in the
ice, wide enough for the boat to cross to an island in the middle of the bay, on
the north side of which we found some open water, which enabled us to get two
miles beyond it.
At 3 p.m. on the 30th, we arrived at Cape Krusenstern, and when opposite its
high cliffs a strong breeze sprung up from N. N. E., which drove the ice so
forcibly against the rocks, that we were obliged to unload with all haste, and haul
the boat up on a drift-bank of snow to save it from being squeezed.
Here for the first time this season we found the ice broken up in the offing,
caused evidently by the strong currents of the ebb and flood tides ; whereas on
looking in the direction from which we had come, all, except immediately along
shore, was smooth, white, unbroken, and apparently as firm as in winter.
We were now at the most convenient though not the nearest point for making
the traverse to Wollaston Land, passing close to Douglas Island, and, there was no
necessity for our proceeding further along the shore, even had we been able to do
so, which at present was impossible; the high rocks presenting an insurmountable

barrier on the one hand, and the ice by its roughness equally impassable on the-
other. We pitched our tents on the top of the cliffs, in the ascent of which the
before-mentioned snow-bank served as a ladder, and waited for the first favour-
able change in the ice.
A few days afterwards, Albert (the Esquimaux interpreter) and one of the men,
when some distance inland looking for deer, overtook five Esquimaux travelling
to the interior with loads of salmon, which they had speared in a rivulet that falls
into Pasley Cove. From these the interpreter learnt that the sea ice had com-
menced breaking up only one day before our arrival, and that they had been in
company with the natives of Wollaston Land during the winter, none of whom
had ever seen Europeans, large ships, or boats.
During our long and tedious detention here, several gales of wind occurred,
principally from the northward, but the space of open water was so small that
they produced little effect upon the ice. Our situation was most tantalizing to
all the party ; occasionally at turn of tide a pool of water, a mile or more in
extent, would appear near us, and every thing would be prepared for embarkation
at a minute’s notice, in expectation of the opening increasing and permitting us
to cross to Douglas Island, but our hopes were always disappointed.
A number of observations were obtained which placed our encampment in
latitude 68 deg. 24 min. 35 sec. N., the longitude being very nearly the same as
that assigned to it by Sir John Richardson and Mr. Kendall. The mean variation
of the compass, from ,eight sets of azimuths, on different days, and at different
hours, was 59 deg. 8 min. 08 sec. E., the extremes being 57 deg. 42 min. and
61 deg. 25 min.
The ice continued driving to and fro with the tides, without separating suffi-
ciently to allow of the practicability of passing among it until the 19th August,
when there was more open water to seaward than we had yet observed, caused
by a moderate southerly breeze that had been blowing for the last two days.
After wailing some hours for a favourable opportunity of forcing our way
through a close-packed stream of ice that was grinding along the rocks as it
drove to the northward, we at last pushed off, and after more than once narrowly
escaping being squeezed, we reached comparatively open water, where we had
room to use our oars. We had pulled more than seven miles, and were still
three miles from the island (Douglas), when we came to a stream of ice, so close
packed and so rough that we could neither pass over nor through it; a thick
fog had come on, and the ebb tide was carrying us fast to the S. E. Under
these circumstances I thought it advisable to return towards the main shore, on
which we landed early on the morning of the 20th, a short distance to the south
of the place from whence we had started. AN. W. breeze came on some hours
after landing, and cleared away the ice a few yards distance from the beach,
of which we took advantage to shift our quarters, which being under some
crumbling cliffs, were neither safe nor convenient.
We poled along shore for three miles or more towards Point Lockyer (the only
direction in which we could go), and then took shelter in a small bay, into
which we had scarcely entered when the wind changed to E. N. E., and in a
very short time left not a spot of open water visible, either near shore or at a dis-
tance.
The wind continued to blow from E. and N. E. for the two following days,
during which, when the tide was in, we a few miles to the south,
principally by launching the boat over the ice.
On the evening of the 22d I ascended a hill near the shore, from which a fine
view was obtained. As far as I could see with the telescope in the direction of
Wollaston Land, nothing but the white ice forced up into heaps was visible,
whilst to the E. and S. E. there was a large space of open water, between
which and the shore a stream of ice, some miles in breadth, was driving with
great rapidity towards Cape Hearne and its vicinity.
As the fine weather had now evidently broken up, and as there was every
appearance of an early winter, I thought it would be a useless waste of time to
wait any longer in hopes of being able to cross to Wollaston Land ; I therefore
gave orders for our return towards the Coppermine, at which I did not expect to
arrive in less than a weeh, as the ice wore as unfavourable an aspect as it did
last year.
At


At an early hour on the 23d the men commenced carrying the baggage to
Point Lockyer, still more than a league distant, and afterwards hauled the boat
to the same place ; doing this gave all the party 10 hours’ hard work ; but our
fatigues were soon forgotten on finding some open water on the south side of
the point, in which w r e were speedily afloat and sailing before the fast-decreasing
breeze. It fell calm in half an hour; but we plied our oars to such good pur-
pose, that we pitched our tents late at night on Cape Hearne.
Here I had expected to find the ice close packed on the shore, and quite impas-
sable, but I was agreeably surprised to discover as we advanced, that there was
a lane of open water between the beach and the pack, wide enough for us to pass
through.
The only way that I can account for this is, by supposing that the gale
of wind that had been blowing from N.E. and E.N.E. had shifted to N. and
N. W. as it approached the land, and carried the ice along with it.
By working 17 hours next day we came to the mouth of the river, and on the
following morning ascended to the Bloody Fall. Here fish were still very
numerous, and whilst some of the party were cooking, others set a couple of nets
to obtain a supply for some days.
I may here mention, that when on the coast, we obtained as many salmon and
herring * as we could consume, when there was a piece of open water large
enough for setting a net to be found.
Deaseand Simpson, after hauling their boats over the rocks opposite the lower
and strongest part of the fall, had them towed up the remainder by water; and
as our boat was now much weakened by the rough usage it had unavoidably been
exposed to, for the purpose of saving time, and the tear and wear that would be
caused by having it dragged over the portage, I was desirous of doing the same.
I was the more led to do this, as the men were of opinion that it might be
effected with safety. All that appeared in any way difficult was easily done,
and there was only one short place to be ascended, which was so smooth that
a loaded boat might have passed it; here, however, from some unaccountable
cause, the steersman was seized with a sudden panic, and called to those towing
the boat to slack the line. This was no sooner done sufficiently to allow him to
get firm footing, than he leaped on shore, followed by the bowsman, and allowed
the boat to sheer out into the current, where the line broke, and the boat soon
afterwards oversetting, was carried into one of the eddies some distance down
stream ; to which Albert and I ran, and stationed ourselves at two points of rock
near which the wreck would pass. It drove to where Albert w 7 as, and he hooked
it by the keel with an oar until I came to his aid, when I fixed a pole in a broken
plank and called my companion to assist me holding on; he either did not hear
me correctly, or thinking he would be of more use on the bottom of the boat,
sprung to it, and before I had time to call him off, or even think of his danger,
they were carried by a turn of the current into a small bay, where I believed
both were safe ; not so, however, for the next minute they were swept out again,
and the last I saw of our excellent interpreter was his making a leap towards the
Tocks; he missed them and disappeared, nor did he rise again to the surface.
This melancholy accident grieved me much, as the brave lad was universally
liked for his activity, lively and amiable disposition, and extreme good nature.
On James Hope, the steersman, rests all the blame of the loss of the boat; his
carelessness in using a small towing-line when there was a much stronger one in
the boat, and his cowardice where there was no danger, can admit of no excuse.
On taking up our nets (which we laid carefully on the rocks for the Esqui-
maux), they were found full of herring salmon, in fine condition.
We commenced our journey across land, towards Great Bear Lake on the 26th,
each of the men carrying about 90 lbs., my own bundle being nearly 50 lbs.
Three days easy march brought us to that part of the Coppermine (latitude
€7 deg, 12 min. N.) from which it was my intention to make a straight course
to Fort Confidence. Here we expected to meet with some Indians, but we did
not fall in with them until the following evening, w'hen our loads were much
lightened, and we arrived here early this afternoon (being our seventh day from
the Bloody Fall), accompanied by upwards of 30 of the natives, who had joined us
.at different parts of the route.

Extract of a DESPATCH from Sir George Simpson, dated Norway House,
26 June 1850.
I am sorry it is not in my power to give any information respecting the fate
of the expedition under the command of Sir John Franklin, as no advices have
keen received here from the Arctic regions since the arrival of the express
which conveyed Chief Factor Rae’s letters, up to the 29th November, receipt
of which was acknowledged from London previous to my departure from
Canada.
The packets that were forwarded from Lachine to Mr. Rae and Captain
Pullen, under dates 21st January and 14th February, reached Red River settle-
ment respectively on the 30th March and 30th April, but, from the circumstance
of the bearers of the first packet having lost their way between Cumberland and
Lac la Rouge, occasioning a loss of nearly a month, they did not reach Isle a la
Crosse till the Ist June, one packet arriving there in the morning, and the
other in the evening of that day; the former was dispatched within an hour
.after its receipt, and the latter in like manner, the bearers of the second packet
overtaking those who started in the morning. As the navigation of the rivers
was open, it was expected that both packets would have reached Great Slave
Lake before the breaking up of the ice, in time to enable Captain Pullen and
Mr. Rae to have resumed their search, provided there were sufficient provisions
in the district for that service; but that is exceedingly doubtful, as the demauds
upon our resources during the three past years have exhausted our reserves
{which, under the most favourable circumstances are always low in that poor and
remote part of the country) to such a degree that it was found necessary to send
many of the servants, during the past winter, to neighbouring lakes to subsist
themselves by fishing. The two boat loads of provisions, with crews of 15 men,
ordered by me, under date 21st January, to be forwarded from Red River, to
meet the demands of the expeditions to be fitted out this summer, were dispatched
by Chief Factor Ballenden at the opening of the navigation, with 100 pieces of
pemican and flour, stores of tea, sugar, biscuit, pork, &c. for Captain Pullen and
Mr. Rae, and about 15 bales of clothing.
Owing


Owing to the late breaking up of Lake Winipeg these boats did not reach the
Grand Rapid until the 12th June, but as the crews consisted of 14 picked men
of the settlement, and one of the most experienced and active guides, they will
doubtless make an expeditious voyage to Mackenzie River; I fear, however,
they will arrive too late to be available for service during the present season of
open water.
It is expected the cargoes of these boats will be delivered entire, as arrange*
ments had been made to victual the crews for the whole voyage from Red River
to Mackenzie River.
The continued absence of Chief Factor Rae from the charge of the important
district of Mackenzie River is attended with very serious inconvenience to the
buisness, but we consider no sacrifice too great in giving effect to the views and
wishes of Her Majesty’s Government and the British public in reference to this
painfully interesting service.

Enclosure to No. 5. (D.)
Extract of a LETTER from John Rae, Esq., Chief Factor, Hudson’s Bay
Company, to Sir John Richardson.
My dear Sir John, ' Portage la Loche, 30 July 1850.
I have now the pleasure to acknowledge your several kind and interesting
favours, —of 15th August, from Norway House; of 18th and 19th, from Lake
Winipeg; and 6th September, from Rainy Lake, —all of which reached me on
the 6th of April, by our usual winter express. By the Government express, I
received three other letters from you on the 25th of June, and the two more, by
L’Esperance, on the 25th instant, the latest being dated on the 3d of April.
A list of all the articles brought from Fort Confidence to Fort Simpson was
made out, and credited to the expedition; but finding that all, or greater part,
would be again required for the contemplated expeditions, I do not send out any
accounts of them.
The quantity of dry meat remaining at Fort Confidence, before I left, was
2,2001b5., the best of which, amounting to 1,6001b5., was brought away by us;
and the remainder, being poor stuff, was given to the Indians, as our boat could
contain no more. Of the 1,600 lbs,, 850 were used on the voyage to Fort Simpson
and Slave Lake, leaving 750 available.
You are aware that I was, if possible, to resume my search this summer for the
unfortunate missing navigators. A Government express, conveying instructions
to this effect, met me on the 25th ultimo, one day’s journey below Slave Lake,
Commander Pullen, being in company with his party, received orders to the
same effect. The route pointed out for him being to the westward of the Copper-
mine, as far as Cape Bathurst; and from thence, out to sea, in the direction of
Banks Land.; rather a hazardous experiment with open boats. As the stock of
provisions would not admit of two expeditions being equipped, Pullen (who is
much better fitted for such an undertaking, in almost all respects, than I am)
had the preference, and will take with him pemican and dry meat to the amount
of about 4,500 lbs., which is to be stowed in one of our large batteaux and in one

of the “ Plover’s” boats. So small a quantity of provision is left at Fort Simpson
that Ido not know how our fall business is to be carried on. Two of the Govern-
ment men, who were unfit for active duty, returned to England ; and three of
the company’s men, including Neil M‘Leod, have been engaged in their place.
As 14 men and two boat loads of provisions have been sent from Red River
to this portage to fit out another expedition under my charge, I am somewhat
at a loss how to act, as the few instructions I have received direct my atten-
tion to places where in my opinion there is no chance of learning anything of
the objects of our anxiety. As it is the firm opinion of the gentleman in charge,
Mr. Murray, of theYoucan, that that river falls into the sea S. W. of point
Barrow, and is not identical with the Colville, it appears to me very unnecessary
that any party should proceed in that direction. To carry on a search from the
Mackenzie, along the coast to the westward, is equally unlikely to be of use.
In order, therefore, that the expenses incurred may not be entirely thrown
away, I have determined to return to Bear Lake, and pass the winter at Fort
Confidence, to build two boats there, similar to those of Dease and Simpson, and
with them attempt next summer to reach Wollaston or Victoria Land, vid the
Coppermine. That the time should not be unprofitably spent I shall, with two
or three men, visit the mouth of the Coppermine this fall, and probably go as far
as the bay where your boats were left in 1848, to see whether a “ cache” of
pemican deposited there last year is still safe; this I doubt, as the stony nature
of the ground was unfavourable to perfect concealment. Should we be fortunate
in procuring provisions during the winter, and our party be healthy in the
spring, I shall endeavour to proceed 12 or 14 days’journey to the northward,
over the ice, in the month of May next; and in the event of being unsuccessful,
as in all probability we shall be, the boats will be ordered to meet me at the
Kendall; and should the ice permit, 1 shall with them endeavour to blot out the
memory of my last year’s failure. In forming this plan I have been actuated
by but one feeling, namely, the desire of pursuing the route in which there is
the greatest probability of gaining some information, or finding traces of the
gallant navigators or their vessels. To facilitate this, I have requested Mr.
Hargrave to procure an Esquimaux interpreter from Churchill to replace poor
Albert, and to forward him by winter to Mackenzie River; also to send the
“ Halkett’s ” boat that I had with me at Repulse Bay.
Captain Pullen requested me to make over all the instruments of your expe-
dition to him, as soon as he was aware of his returning to the coast; this I at
once agreed to do, as he may want most of them at winter quarters. I cannot
say much in favour of the men that have been engaged for me; they are all, with-
out exception, either Indians or half breeds from Red River; good-enough men
in their way, but not well fitted for what we have to do.
I omitted to mention in the proper place that when the winter packet arrived,
and I received your instructions respecting the establishment of an Indian party
on the Coppermine, the Martin Lake chief, “ Tecoon-ne-betah,” with his party
was at Fort Simpson, and I had no difficulty in engaging them to pass the sum-
mer at certain stations in the route between the Kendall and the Bear Lake.
The leader received three notes, which were to be delivered to any Europeans
they might meet, in which the strangers were requested to put themselves wholly
in the hands of the Indians, who would guide them by the best road to the nearest
post, and feed them by the way. In the event, of not seeing any parties, other
notes, with a rough chart of the best route, were supplied, well wrapped in oil-
cloths, which were to be placed on poles in conspicuous stations.
Having arrived here long before “ L'Esperance,” and there being 10 cargoes
to lake over the portage, our provisions would have been done ere this had I not,
fortunately, brought two nets, with which we catch as many fish in the lake as
feed half our party.
My companion at Bear Lake will be Mr. MacKenzie, whom you saw at Fort
Norman ; he is a fine active fellow, and a good shot. I have promised him 130/.
per annum, which I don’t think too much.
I am, &c.

COPY of a LETTER from Commander W.J.S. Pullen , R.N., to the Secretary
of the Admiralty.
Sir, Great Slave Lake, 28 June 1850.
I beg to acquaint you for their Lordships’ information, that on the 25th
‘instant, while ascending the Mackenzie, and within one day’s journey of Big
Island on the Great Slave Lake, I received their despatch of the 25th of January
last, and humbly beg to express my gratitude for their expression and token of
■approbation of conduct.
With respect to the further search on the Arctic coast, after mature con-
sideration and consultation with Dr. Rae, I have determined on proceeding im-
mediately to the coast in accordance with their Lordships’ wishes.
I beg to lay before them a summary of my resources and arrangements for
the expedition.
(Ist, Boats.) —The boats in which we accomplished our first expedition are
in a very shattered condition, as well from the severity of the past winter as
from the injuries received during the trip ; in fact, one is utterly unseaworthy,
and with her I purpose patching up the other, and with a large new boat of
the company’s, now at Fort Simpson, fitted and adapted'for the work, to which
end I dispatched a messenger on the 26th instant, I entertain sanguine expec-
tations of satisfactorily performing the required duty.
On my arrival at Big Island I assembled my party, and acquainted them
-with the intended voyage, when they unanimously volunteered for the service.
Jt was with great regret that I found myself obliged to exclude two of the party
from accompanying, me ; Mr. John Abernethy (acting second ice-master),
who suffers from frequent illness, and is, I consider, unfit for so arduous an
undertaking; and John Senior, captain of the foretop, who has been suffering
with a bad.leg, supposed to be a chronic disease. Poor fellow, he was most
anxious and willing to go, and would run every risk. I have therefore deter-
mined on sending them to England.
To render efficient my arrangements, I have thought it necessary to engage
three of the company’s servants, viz. Neil M‘Leod as steersman and fisherman,
at the rate of 4/. 10s. per month ; William Hepburne and Gerome St. George
(dit Laporte), rated able seaman; their services commencing on the Ist July
1850, and ceasing, the two former on the embarkation at York Factory, the
•latter on my arrival with party at Norway House. As regards provision, stores,
. &c. Mr. Rae and myself considered it necessary to provide 30 pieces of pemican
and 15 pieces of dried meat, to obtain the former of which it would be requisite
■to proceed to Fort Resolution, as the lower posts could only supply two-thirds
.of that quantity. We accordingly proceeded for that post; but being to-day
•stopped by the ice for an uncertain period, 1 have thought it better, after again
• consulting with Mr. Rae, to make up the deficit with dry meat in preference to
•losing time; only preferring the pemican from its less liability to suffer from
wet. I accordingly return to-morrow towards Fort Simpson.
At Fort Good Hope I shall endeavour to engage two Hare Indians as hunters
and guides; one, who is there, having accompanied “ Dease” and “Simpson”
on their trips of discovery. These will augment our party to 17 persons in all,
■which will not be more than sufficient crews for the boats. I have made a
■ demand upon the company’s stores for such articles of clothing and equipment
as I deemed absolutely necessary, including a few presents for the Esquimaux, and
•possibly, for the natives of Wollaston, or Banks Land.
My present intentions are to proceed down the Mackenzie along the coast to
Cape Bathurst, and thence strike across for Banks Land; my operations must
-then of course be guided by circumstances; but I shall strenuously endeavour
to search along all coasts in that direction as far and as late as 1 can with safety
venture; returning, if possible, by the Mackenzie or by the Beghoola, which
the Indians speak of as being navigable, as its head waters are (by Sir John
Richardson) oxdy a nine days’ portage from Fort Good Hope, to meet which, or
•a similar contingency, 1 take snow shoes and sledges, &c.
During the past winter I observed constantly with those instruments left at
Fort Simpson by Sir John Richardson, and shall now retain them for a second

series, trusting to their Lordships’ approval of that measure. I have made known-
to Mr. Hooper their Lordships’ approbation of his conduct, for which he is deeply
grateful, and I beg to again recommend him to their favourable consideration as
a zealous and active young officer.
In conclusion, I beg to assure their Lordships of my earnest determination to
carry out their views to the utmost of my ability, being confident, from the
eagerness of the party that no pains will be spared, no necessary labour avoided,
and by God’s blessing we hope to be successful in discovering some tidings of
our gallant countrymen, or even in restoring them to their native land and
anxious relatives.

Extract of a LETTER from Sir George Simpson to the Governor and Com-
mittee of the Hudson’s Bay Company, dated Lacliine, 28 October 1850.
With reference to the communication from the Admiralty under date 11th
instant, stating that there “ was no supply of provisions at Great Bear Lake, and
that the party wintering there under Captain Pullen had no food but offal fish,”
I have the satisfaction to say that, by information conveyed by Chief Factor Rae
to Mr. Ballenden, in a private letter which reached him previous to his de-
parture from Red River, there had been no suffering either among whites or
Indians in Mackenzie River district during the past year (except at the post on
Frances Lake in the mountains), notwithstanding the extraordinary calls on our
scanty resources for the use of the recent expeditions.
Captain Pullen and some of his people passed the winter with Chief Factor
Rae at Fort Simpson, and others of his party wintered at a fishery on Great
Bear Lake, where the supply of fish was abundant and of the usual quality,
never complained of by the company’s servants, although in the letter from the
Admiralty described as “ offalbut as might be expected, the people being
unaccustomed to such diet were somewhat dissatisfied with it, an evil which
could not be remedied. The supply of pemican and flour sent from Red River
this summer for the use of the expeditions, had been received, which, in addition
to the stores of provisions collected during the spring at the different posts,
removed all apprehension of scarcity; but even were it otherwise, it would be
quite impossible at this season to forward supplies in time to be available for the
ensuing winter.
In the communication from Dr. Rae to Mr. Ballenden, already referred to, it
is stated that the despatches from England (noticed in the 21st paragraph of
my

Fort Good Hope, Mackenzie River,
Sir, 17 July 1850.
I have the honour to report for the information of their Lordships, a sum-
mary of my proceedings since the 28th ultimo, at which date I had the honour
of dispatching my last letter by the H. B. ship from York.
I returned to Fort Simpson on the 3d instant, from which date until the 11th,
my own party as also the people of the fort were busily engaged in preparing
the boats for the voyage, some of the blue jackets volunteering to act as carpen-
ters, and handling saws and planes with nearly equal facility as the marlinspike.
I have had the new boat (of which the dimensions are in the margin) fitted with
two masts, fore and aft sails, and an iron keel-band. She is certainly very large,
but the only smaller boat there (built for Sir J. Richardson) is not of sufficient
capacity to contain all our provisions and stores ; and should we have the good
fortune to discover the missing party, we shall be enabled to afford them more
efficient assistance, although her size will entail on the party a little extra work
as regards ice, portages, &c. The “ Logan” was as thoroughly repaired and
fitted as possible, and having received provisions, stores, &c. from Fort Simpson,
we started from that post on the 11th instant, reached Fort Norman on the
13th, stopped there one night to receive the contingent of provisions and stores
from that station, and arrived here yesterday morning, having pulled day and
night (the wind being almost constantly fresh against us) with exception of one
or two trials of sailing, in which the “ Try Again” (which name I have given
to the large boat) answered as well as could be expected. We have here com-
pleted our supplies, amounting to 45 pieces, sufficient for 120 days for our party
of 17; I intend also to take up the pemican buried at Point Separation, leaving
.a notice there, should any parties arrive and need provision, of the nearest post
where they may be obtained, which I consider to be that on Peel’s river, to
reach which cannot occupy them more than three days at the farthest, although
I do not consider it probable that any party can arrive, or at any rate before our
return, when I shall if possible replace it. I have engaged here two Indians to
accompany us as hunters, and made arrangements for others to look out for us
on the banks of the “ Beghoola” or “ Inconnu,” should we ascend that river,
which they say is seven nights from this, and well stocked with deer; but we
should probably take a rather longer time to accomplish the journey across, as
■our men cannot be such expert walkers as those trained from their infancy to the
exercise.
'Should we fortunately attain Banks Land and find the sea clear to the east-
ward and a favourable breeze, I am led to suspect that we may possibly pro-
ceed to Port Leopold ; but I only name this as a possible chance, should their
Lordships not hear from me of our return this season. Again, could we only
reach Cape Bunny with our boats, whence Sir James Ross turned to the south,
we shall certainly not return, but proceed on foot,Tor which I think we cannot
be better provided, all hands being equipped with dresses and mocassins of moose
leather, than which nothing is better adapted to resist the icy blasts of the frigid
north, requiring less under clothing, which should always be of flannel or
•woollens, except for the feet, duffle or blanket wrappers being far preferable to any
kind of .sock or stocking, and thus the men are less tightly and cumbersomely
•clad than with the usual provision of cloth garments, English leather shoes, &c.
I have written to Mr. Rae, requesting a supply of provision, clothing, &c., the
dormer to meet our wants in case of return by the Beghoola, and to carry us on

to the wintering station, which the period of our arrival can only determine ; the
latter to repay our Indian hunters, who will not go further south, and such others
as may assist us, for their services.
We are just on the point of starting, and 1 hope to reach the sea about the
23d instant. Wherever I meet with remarkable headlands or points either on
this coast or otherwise, I shall take care to have conspicuous notices of our visit,
and perhaps a deposit of provisions. Our stock on leaving Point Separation will
consist of 2,300 pounds of dry meat, and 1,700 pounds of pemmican ; also half-
a-dozen cases of preserved meat, which will remain so to the last.
Agreeably with the opinion expressed in the latter part of my journal, I do
not think that Captain Collinson’s ships will be able to get along the coast from
Point Barrow, if they reach so far, unless the ice be further removed from the
shore than at the time of our last voyage. The steam launch will have a good
chance, as drift wood is plentiful along the coast east of Cape Halkett, and of
course boats may again do what boats have done before.
The season has been extraordinarily fine, and our steersman (an intelligent
man), who was on the coast in both expeditions of Sir John Richardson and.
Mr. Rae, is confident of an open sea. Others also, natives of the country, are
of the same opinion.
Should I find provision and fuel plentiful on Banks Land, it is possible that
I may winter there, for the further prosecution of our search next season.
In conclusion, I beg to assure their Lordships, that no efforts (as I before said) -
will be spared to endeavour to carry out their, wishes to the utmost, and hope that
the termination of this season may, by God’s blessing, throw some light upon the
whereabouts of the missing ships.

NARRATIVE of the PROCEEDINGS of Her Majesty’s Ship “North Star,” Mr.
James Saunders , Master-Commanding, on an Expedition to Barrow Straits ,.
with Stores and Provisions, in 1849 and 1850.
Her Majesty’s Ship, “ North Star,’*
Sir, Spithead, 28 September 1850.
I have the honour to report, for the information of my Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, an account of the proceedings of Her Majesty’s ship, “ North
Star,” from the 19th July last year, up to which date their Lordships have-
already been made acquainted.
After the boats of the “ Prince of Wales” whaler left the ship on that date, I
proceeded along the edge of the ice in search of an opening to get through the
pack (as there was no land floe in Melville Bay), being occasionally compelled,
to make fast to a berg or large floe whenever our progress was impeded either by
the closing up of the ice or calm weather. In this way we continued making,
little or scarce any progress until noon of Sunday, the 29th of July, being
then in the latitude 74 deg. 32 min. N. and long. 59 deg. 17 min. W. when
a fine breeze sprung up from E.NJS., with clear weather, which enabled us to
run


run between the floes, which had considerably opened, leaving wide lanes of
water between them, at the rate of about five miles an hour. 1
We continued running in this way as nearly in the direction of Cape York as
the ice would allow us, and I bad then great hopes that we should be enabled to k
get through without much detention ; but we were doomed to be again disap-
pointed, for at about 4 p. m. the ice began to close very rapidly from the south-
ward, which prevented our further progress, and we were obliged to seek shelter
in a bight in one of the largest floes we could see. The wind shifted to S. S. E.,
and blew a strong gale with heavy rain. The ice, which was all in large floes,
pressed against each other with great force, squeezing up and breaking in all
directions.
The ship being providentially placed in a bight or notch in the floe, to which
she was made fast, we were enabled to veer her further into it as the edge of the
floe broke away by the outward pressure, and by that means kept her in the only
pool of water to be seen, and prevented her from receiving any injury.
The rudder was unshipped and hung across the stern, and the yard and stay
tackles got up, and everything prepared for hoisting, the large boat out, in the
event of any accident happening to the ship.
A quantity of provisions was also got on the upper deck, ready for placing in
the boats, if wanted, and which were kept up during the whole time the ship was
beset.
At midnight it blew a very heavy gale, with rain, from S. S. E., which weather
continued, with little intermission, for the two following days. We were thus
beset by the ice from this date until the 26th of September, and kept drifting
about with it in a totally helpless condition. Every opportunity, however, was
embraced of endeavouring to extricate the ship by heaving and warping, when-
ever the slightest opening took place in the ice.
During the month of September the bay ice formed so strongly as to cement
the whole mass together, forming one large floe.
On the 21st September it blew a strong gale from the eastward, and the ship
drifted with the pack rapidly to the westward, and at about 5 p. m. the ice was
opened, in consequence of its coming in contact with an immense berg of some
miles in circumference, which was lying aground and kept breaking up the floes
as they were carried against it with the current, the ship also drifting directly in
front of it, and at 9 p. m. she was within a quarter of a mile of it. The yard
tackles were got up on both sides in readiness to get the large boat out, as it was
impossible to say on which side they might be wanted, the ship being turned
round in all directions by the ice as it pressed in. We continued in this way
until about midnight, when we were pushed round the inner edge of the berg
with a body of ice which had now become v.ery small by the immense pressure,
and continued drifting with it to the north-west.
Fortunately, the ice was now small, and much decayed, for had it not been so,
nothing could have saved the ship, and, I fear, the crew also; for, unlike a
whaler, who, although severely nipped, is kept afloat by her empty casks until
provisions can be got up sufficient to last for a long time, with us it would have
been quite otherwise, for, being deeply laden, if nipped, would have sunk almost
immediately.
On the 22d September the ship continued drifting in the same manner .to the
N. W. with the ice, which was continually coming in contact with the numerous
bergs that w T ere aground. At noon, the latitude observed was 75 deg. 38 min. N*
and longitude 68 deg. 12 min. W.; throughout the day the wind was blowing
strong from the south-east.
At 1 a. m. of the 23d we were much in the same perilous situation as we were
at midnight of the 21st, being carried along in front of an immense iceberg which
lay aground, and against which the ice was pressing with great force; but the
same Almighty Providence which had protected us on all former occasions, was
equally kind in the present, and allowed us to be pushed clear of it, the ship
passing along its easternmost side about 300 yards from it.
We continued drifting along the land in a most unsafe and precarious situa-
tion, as the ice was carried about and broken up in its passage between the
numerous icebergs which lined the coast, until noon of the 26th September, when
we appeared to be drifting directly towards Wolstenholme Island, and it was
doubtful whether we should pass within of without it. Here providentially the
ice appeared much looser, caused by the water being much deeper, and allowing

the bergs that had passed the ridge of others that were aground off Dudley Diggs
(and which materially retarded the progress of the pack) now to float away. At
1 p. m. we opened Wolstenholme Sound, and observed it perfectly clear of ice,
caused by several icebergs lying aground off Cape Athol, which prevented the
ice from entering, and turned it outside of the island.
All sail was immediately made on the ship (although it was blowing a heavy
gale) to force her through the ice ; fortunately the masts and yards held on, and
she pushed her way through, and reached open water at 3p. m. The rudder
was then shipped, and we stood up the sound, anchoring in 19 fathoms, when it
became dark.
On the 30th September, after examining the sound, the ship was removed to
winter quarters at the head of the bay, and safely moored in latitude 76 deg.
33 min. N., longitude 68 deg. 56 min. 15 sec. W.
I cannot sufficiently express the heartfelt joy that every man and officer felt at
this unexpected and miraculous dispensation of Providence in releasing us from
the ice in the extraordinary manner in which we were; for if we had not got in
here, I fear very few if any of the crew would have survived the winter, as it
is more than probable the ship would have gone to pieces, and a sufficient quan-
tity of provisions could not have been saved to have lasted them for so long a
time. This the most thoughtless of the crew appeared to be quite aware of.
Here we found a settlement of Esquimaux, and another one about 12 miles
down the sound. They appear very harmless people, but possessing less inge-
nuity than any race of beings I have ever yet seen. Each settlement consists
but of one hut, in which a number of families dwell. These huts are generally
formed about half underground, on the slope of a hill, near the sea, the upper
part being built over in a very rude manner with rough stones. They do not
know the use of boats, and their only weapon appears to be a small spear, which
they carry in their hand.
They live entirely on raw food, mostly seal’s flesh. Not having boats, they are
compelled to follow the land ice to the north during the summer, depositing the
seals which they kill at their various stations along the coast, on which they
retreat during the winter, as their stock to the northward becomes exhausted.
As I cannot here enter into minor details as to our proceedings throughout the
winter, I would briefly state that the ship became frozen in on the 12th of Octo-
ber, when the housing was spread over, and every other preparation made for the
winter. The thermometer did not fall below zero till the beginning of November.
On the 24th of October the sun just showed itself above the hills at noon, and
did not reappear until the 17th of February when his upper limb again made
its appearance. A period of 116 days.
Durink the winter we had heavy gales of wind occasionally from the eastward,
during which time the thermometer invariably rose, sometimes nearly to zero,
as also in cloudy weather.
I may here add that throughout,the whole voyage neither the marine nor the
aneroid barometer have been of any use to indicate the weather, although both
appear quite sensitive and move together.
We found February our coldest month, on the 24th of which the thermometer was
registered at 9 and 10 p. m. at 63i* below zero, and at 61° for the following eight
hours. It also fell to 63 J® 0 n the 27th. The thermometer by which this was regis-
tered and the meteorological table was kept, I have carefully put away, in order
that it may be tested, as I believe that to be the coldest natural temperature ever
registered. On Monday the 28th of January 1850, an Esquimaux was brought
alongside in a sledge in a most deplorable condition from frost bites; and as his
companions threw him off from it at the foot of our ladder, making us to under-
stand they wished us to cure him, I felt compelled from humanity’s sake to
receive him on board, though reluctantly, as he was much in the way of our men
on the lower deck. For the first two months he appeared to do well, and I was
in hopes we would be enabled to cure him ; and in the meantime, as a sort of
recompense, I expected to make him understand our language sufficiently to
inquire if he could give us any information respecting Sir John Franklin and his
party, or any of the other Arctic ships. However in this I was disappointed, for
although he was on board upwards of three months, he did not appear to under-
stand us better than when he first came. His new mode of living being totally
different to what he had been accustomed, he became unwell and died on the 9th
of May.
Our


Our crew remained in good health and spirits throughout the winter, they of
their own free will taking every necessary exercise until the month of April,
when several slight cases of scurvy made their appearance, and on the 12th of
May the assistant surgeon (who examined the men every Monday morning)
reported to me that he feared we should have still more fresh cases, and recom-
mended that vegetable diet or pickles should be supplied to them as a preventive.
Having none on board for our own use, I felt it my duty to order that part of
what we had on board for the Arctic ships should be issued. I also directed
that the crew should be put on a full allowance of bread, they having been on two-
thirds during the winter, we not having had room to stow the same proportion of
that species as of the other kind of provisions on leaving England.
I regret to state that four of the men died, although neither of the cases could
be attributed to the climate. I cannot help here mentioning the very great
attention and kindness paid by Mr. James Rae, the assistant-surgeon, to the sick
under his care on all occasions; nor was it limited to that alone, for his atten-
tions to the ventilation of the ship, and health and comfort of the crew, were his
most anxious study, and I received many valuable suggestions from him on
these points. I therefore strongly recommend him to the favourable considera-
tion of their Lordships.
, At the commencement of the severe season we were annoyed with steam from
the galley, when a large ventilating funnel was placed over the coppers, and led
up through the housingj which completely carried away all the steam; several
other smaller ones were got up in different parts of the ship; and I may state
that throughout the whole season there was not a particle of damp on the lower
deck, and the temperature was between 40 and 50 deg.
Not being fitted with the heating apparatus, I got a stove fitted in the gun-
room, and another in the cabin, as also two on the lower deck, from which fun-
nels led through all the cabins, keeping the temperature to between 40 and
50 deg., and preventing any moisture from accumulating. The officers were
also enabled to dry their clothes when a strong fire was kept up, by hanging
them round about the funnels.
As the spring and summer advanced, shooting parties were sent away, when
all we succeeded in getting was only about 50 hares and a few wild duck.
Several foxes were also shot during the winter.
Beacons were erected on the north and south entrance of North Star Bay, in
which were placed a cylinder containing an account of our having wintered
there, and intentions of proceeding to the westward when liberated, a copy of
which I enclose.
A beacon was also erected to mark the place where the four men were buried,
in which a similar notice was enclosed; having added to it their names, ages,
and date of decease.
When the weather became sufficiently warm to allow the carpenters to handle
their tools in the open air, the ice was dug away from round the bows of the
ship for 3 feet deep, to examine and repair what injury she received in coming
through the ice last year, which was found to be very trifling; the galvanized
iron with which her bows had been covered was all ragged and torn off. It
being thinner than copper was of no protection to the wood, and only injured
the warps in hauling them across the bows.
The iron casks in which we held our tar and oil were broken up and used for
covering her bows, which made the ship in a much better condition for taking
the ice than when she left England. The upper deck was then caulked, as the
frost during the winter had drawn all the pitch out of the seams. The pitch in
the seams of the ship’s sides was found not to be injured, having been protected
from the intense cold by the snow embankment with which she was surrounded
during the winter.
During the month of June the rigging was refitted and blacked down, the
sails repaired, the ship and boats painted, and everything got ready for sea.
From this time the few cases of scurvy which had made their appearance
in April now rapidly disappeared, and since then we have all been perfectly
healthy.
About the Ist of July, everything being in readiness for sea, directly an oppor-
tunity might occur, ray whole attention was directed to watching the progress of
the dissolution of the ice ; and Mr. Leask, the ice master, was sent to the top of
a high hill every day, to examine its state in the offing.

The ice rapidly disappeared in the bay, the floe becoming covered with
pools of water, and in many places holes formed right through, which increased
in number every day. All along the shore the ice was broken up by the tide,
and it daily became more difficult to land.
On the 13th of July, the water caused by the melting of the snow on the hills
in the interior, which poured down like a river through the south ravine, had
completely cracked the floe across, and opened it out from 20 to 60 feet in
width.
I therefore determined to saw,a canal down to it from the ship, a distance of
2,030 yards.
On the morning of the 16th we commenced our labours, beginning from the
ship and sawing towards the crack. On the evening of the 22d the two straight
cuts were completed, the ice varying in thickness from 2 to 4 feet and a half.
On the 23d we commenced cross cutting, which we found to form more than
twice the above length, on account of having been obliged to enlarge the width
of the canal 1 yard in every 10, to admit of the floating out of the pieces
when the ice in the offing might open. On the evening of the 25th, the ice
having become so rotten, the saws and other implements were brought on board,
for it now decayed so very rapidly, that I considered it would soon all break up
itself.
During the latter part of July the ice decayed in an astonishingly rapid
manner; the floe, -which some short time ago was 4 feet in thickness, was now
broken into small; pieces, and was fast disappearing, so much so that the water
alongside the ship on the surface was perfectly fresh.
On the morning of the Ist of August the ship was got under weigh, and hauled
out of her winter quarters, where she had remained upwards of 10 months.
During the whole of that day and the next all hands were employed warping,
heaving, and towing her through the ice in the sound; and after very great
exertion succeeded in getting her into open water on the morning of the 3d. We
then made sail, and beat out between Wolstenholrae Island and the main, and
stood to the westward. About 25 miles west of Wolstenholme Island we fell in
with the pack, or middle ice, which we entered; and after several vexatious
stoppages and hard labour, we succeeded in reaching open water at midnight of
the 6th, and stood over for Possession Bay, on our passage to which, a distance
of 150 1 miles, we did not meet with any ice, not even bergs.
At 8 p.m. on the Bth of August, I sent a boat into Possession Bay to ascertain
if there were any tidings of the Arctic ships, or any other information to guide
me; having failed last season in meeting with the “ Investigator,” I was com-
paratively without instructions. At midnight the boat returned, without having
discovered any trace of the ships, except Captain Sir James Ross’s instructions
to Captain Bird, dated July 1848 (printed in Arctic Papers, marked C. page 4).
Also a notice from Captain Ross, stating that they got through the pack on the
evening of the 22d August 1848, examined Pond’s Bay on the 23d, and left this
notice on their way to Lancaster Sound on the 25th August. (A similar notice to
this is printed in Arctic Papers marked C. No. 11, page 7, from Captain Bird.)
Being desirous of obtaining observations for longitude at this place, to ascer-
tain the relative, position of our winter quarters, and the weather being foggy,
I laid off and on until it might clear up for that purpose, which it did on the
afternoon of the 10th; when having obtained the required observations, and
left a notice of my intentions to proceed to Whaler Point, or to any of the other
places mentioned in my instructions, to land the provisions, I then proceeded up
Lancaster Sound, with a tine breeze from the eastward, and made the land near
Whaler Point on the afternoon of the 12th, without meeting with any obstruc-
tion from ice. As we neared the land we found the ice extending off Port
Leopold about 12 miles. After trying every possible means to get the ship
into the harbour until 8 p. m. of the 14th, and without perceiving the slightest
prospect of success, 1 bore up for Port Bowen, having previously sent in a boat
with a notice (a copy of which is enclosed), stating, that finding no prospect
of getting in there, I would endeavour to land the provisions at Port Bowen or
Port Neill.
Captain Sir James Ross will already have acquainted their Lordships of the
provisions, stores, &c. which had been left there, and which appeared to me to
remain exactly as they had been left. The housing or tent cover was very much
torn and rotten, and I should say in another winter will disappear altogether.
(A copy
—


(A copy of the notice found there I beg to enclose*.) From the purport of that
notice I was left in such doubt as to whether the ships had gone home, and from
the appearance of the ice, and the bad season last year, I deemed it advisable to
land the provisions at all risks.
On the evening of the 15th of August we examined Jackson’s Inlet, Port
Bowen, and Port Neill, all three of which places we found; completely blocked
up with heavy land floes of old ice. Finding it perfectly impossible to land-the
provisions here, I again stood over for Port Leopold, and on the 16th made
another attempt to enter it, but I found the ice to extend much further off from
it than before.
The ice appeared to extend in a north-east direction in a solid pack from Cape
Clarence to the north side of Barrow’s Straits, completely blocking up that strait;
and also across Prince Regent’s Inlet to the south-east, where it reaches some
miles south of Port Neill. The first gale from either north or south will turn either
of these bodies right across the entrance of Port Leopold, and completely seal it up.
Finding it impossible to get into Port Leopold with the ship, or even to send
in a boat to remove the notice 1 had left there before going to Port Bowen, and
on account of the advanced state of the season not deeming it prudent to put off
any more time where there was so little prospect of success, I threw over a cask
containing a notice (a copy of which I enclose), and proceeded to the eastward,
with the intention of landing the provisions at some of the places indicated in my
orders.
At noon of the 21st, being in latitude 73 deg. 66 min. N., and longitude 83 deg.
42 min. W., two brigs were seen to the eastward, which on closing at about
3 p.m. were found to be the “ Lady Franklin” and “ Sophia,” in search of
Captain Sir John Franklin. By these vessels I received their Lordships’ letter
to me, dated 10th April 1850, together with a “ Return of the Arctic Correspon-
dence.” By that letter I was informed of the return of the “ Enterprise” and
“ Investigator,” which made the necessity of the provisions on board being
landed more urgent; I therefore determined to do so, if possible, somewhere
near Navy Board Inlet, which seemed to me on the passage up to be the only
likely place we saw, and at which I was informed by Mr. Penny I should find
a safe harbour.
Judging from the latter part of their Lordships’ letter, where I am ordered to
land the provisions at Disco or the Whale Fish Islands, that they imagined
I had not got over to the western side, and considering that provisions would be
far more available here, as I knew that the whole eight vessels in search of Sir
John Franklin were in Lancaster Sound, I therefore told Mr. Penny that
I would endeavour to land them as above-mentioned, if possible; and if a safe
harbour could not be found to land the whole, I would endeavour to land some
for his or the other ship’s use in the event of shipwreck, and proceed with the
remainder, as ordered, to Disco.
By him I received intelligence that the eight vessels came through Melville
Bay in .company, and that he, with his consort the “ Sophia,” parted from them
on; the Isth of August; off Dudley Diggs; that off Cape York they learnt from
the natives where we had wintered, and the “ Felix ” and “ Intrepid ” went in
search of us.
During the afternoon it continued perfectly calm, which gave the two vessels
an opportunity of writing home. At 2a. m. of the next morning (the 22d)
a light breeze sprang up, when we parted company. At five we observed a
schooner under the south land, and soon afterwards Commander Phillips came on
board from the “ Felix ; ” by him I received information that his schooner parted
company off Dudley Diggs on the 15th with Her Majesty’s ships “ Resolute” and
“ Pioneer,” also the “ Prince Albert,” and on the 17th he parted company with
Her Majesty’s ships “Assistance” and “Intrepid,” off'Cape Leopold. These
vessels were to proceed up the northern shore of Lancaster Sound ; he accom-
panied them into Wolstenholme Sound, opened the beacons we had left, and
found we had sailed. He also informed us that Captain Austin was going to
Pond’s Bay, and from thence up the south side of Lancaster Sound, and that letters
would be found in a cairn on a low point on the north side of Pond’s Bay.
„ On the morning of the 23d, being off Wollaston Island, I dispatched in a boat
(in charge of Mr. Leask, the ice master) to look for a harbour. At 2p. m. the
boat returned, and he then informed me that provisions might be landed in
a bay just within the easternmost Wollaston Island, the soundings gradually

decreasing; I therefore ran in and moored the ship in four fathoms, about a
quarter of a mile from the shore ; every thing was then got ready for landing
the provisions, which was commenced at 4a.m. of the following morning. The
beach, which consisted of loose stones, among which large pieces of ground ice
had been thrown up, rendered the landing very difficult; however, with the
assistance of all the spars and planks that we could collect we managed to get
them rolled up.
During the time we were landing the provisions the crew worked with great
spirit under the superintendence of Mr. John Way, the senior second master,
who conducted the operation with great energy and ability, and who seemed
determined that no obstacle should prevent the fulfilment of the object. He also
superintended the sawing out of the canal in Wolstenholme Sound, the landing
the notices in the boats at the various places, and every other duty where trust
was required, highly to my satisfaction, and I cannot too strongly recommend
him to the favourable consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty
for his promotion*, which I consider he so much deserves.
I would also further state, that whilst discharging the provisions and other
stores, I was highly pleased with the zealous and active part Mr, James J. Rutter,
the clerk in charge, took, in assisting, as far as possible, the fulfilment of that
important duty, especially considering the hurry and bustle which attended that
process, situated as w r e were. Not only on this occasion, but during the whole
time he has been under my command, I have had great reason to be pleased
with him, and would strongly recommend him also to the favourable considera-
tion of their Lordships for his promotion, which I consider he so well merits.
The drawings taken by him of Wolstenholme Sound, North Star Bay, &c., are
enclosed # , with the charts or plans of Wolstenholme Sound, &c., which latter were
drawn by Mr. Aylen, master’s assistant, under my immediate superintendence.
By the evening of the 28th of August we had succeeded in landing the pro-
visions as per invoices enclosed, which was a sufficient supply for lasting 100 men
for 12 months, in addition to a large quantity of preserved soups, vegetables,
pickles, and other comforts, and about 40 tons of coals. I also landed our own
housing to cover the tea and other perishable articles, which might prove very
useful in keeping men warm, and sheltering them in the event of shipwreck.
Whilst employed landing the provisions, three very large deer, with immense
horns, were seen walking about near them at one time (and I believe there were
more seen at other times) ; but we were far too much occupied to think of looking
after them.
Everything was now completed, except the erecting of a beacon flagstaff,
similar to the one erected on the 26th, on a low point outside (as per margin),
and for.which everything was landed ready; and it was my intention to have
sent a party to erect it next morning whilst unmooring the ship; but during the
night the wind shifted to the westward, and blew very hard the following morning,
causing a heavy ground-swell. As the gale was increasing, and the ship being on
a dead lee-shore, and the holding ground very bad, the bottom consisting of
loose stones, I could not venture to weigh the anchor; I therefore deemed it
prudent, for the safety of the ship, to slip the cable at the fifth shackle, and pro-
ceed to sea. Fortunately a stone beacon or cairn was erected near the provisions,
with a pole in the centre of it, in which was deposited a cylinder containing an
invoice of all that had been landed. This beacon is in lat. 73 deg. 44 min. N.,
and long. 80 deg. 55 min. W.
Having only about three months of the “ North Star’s ” own provisions
remaining on board, and considering it would be running far too great a hazard
to attempt to leave Navy Board Inlet with so small a quantity, owing to the
possibility of being caught in the pack on the way home, and thereby detained
another winter in the Arctic regions, I therefore desired the clerk in charge to
retain a sufficient quantity of those shipped on board for the expedition so as to
complete up a 12 months’ supply 7.
During the time the men were employed in landing the provisions, also
whilst securing and getting the ship out of Wolstenholme Sound, I found it
necessary

necessary to issue to the people actually employed, an extra ration of preserved
meat and spirits, and half a ration extra of bread, as the usual allowance is not
sufficient to enable men to continue for so many hours, and such hard work in
this cold climate.
At noon of the 29th we passed Cape Hay, where I intended to leave a notice
of where the provisions had been landed; but as the beacon erected by ourselves
on the outer point of Navy Board Inlet was so plainly seen from it, and there
being too much sea on to admit of a boat’s landing, I did not deem it necessary
to wait, and proceeded on to the eastward.
On the afternoon of the 30 th I sent a boat into Possession Bay to leave a
notice (as enclosed) of where the provisions were landed, and also to get obser-
vations for longitude. On the boat’s return I Avas informed that the notices left
by ourselves on the 10th of August and those from the “ Enterprise ” were
removed, and the enclosed (which I beg to forward) put in their place.
I also observed a schooner S. E. of us; but as it was calm we did not close
with her till about nine o’clock the next morning, Avhen I sent a boat on board,
and found it to be the “ Prince Albert,” Commander Forsyth, on his way to
England. The only additional information I received from him was; —he left
Her Majesty’s Ships “ Assistance ” and “ Intrepid,” and the “ Lady Franklin,”
“ Sophia,” and “ Felix,” all well in Wellington Channel.
On the afternoon a breeze sprung up and we soon ran out of sight of him. It
was my intention to have kept company with him until we had crossed the pack,
but he sailed so badly that I thought it better to proceed to Pond’s Bay, and
there land notices of where the provisions were landed; after which, if I had
met him, would, if necessary, have taken him in tow.
On the morning of the 3d of September we were off the north entrance of
Pond’s Bay, and the weather being calm, I anchored the ship with a kedge in
45 fathoms, as I found the current was setting out of the inlet, and a number of
bergs aground near us.
A boat was then despatched to examine the north shore of the inlet in search
of the letters that we were informed by Sir John Ross were deposited there, but,
after examining its north side for 20 miles, could not find any appearance of a
cairn. Two notices, similar to that left at Possession Bay, were landed about
10 miles apart, and placed in the centre of a cairn of stones.
At 8 p. m. the boat returned, and we weighed the kedge, and proceeded to
the S. E.
I regret not having met with Captain Austin, that I might have been able to
inform him of Avhere the provisions were landed; however I have no doubt
Mr. Penny will see him, who will give him the necessary information of my
intentions, which he promised to do before parting company.
At 4 a. m. of Sunday the Bth September, being in lat. 71 deg. 40 min. N.,
long. 71 deg, 10 min. W., the fog which we had had for the last four or five days
cleared away, and we observed ourselves close to the pack or middle ice; which
being loose, we immediately entered, and got through it by 10 a. m., without
much interruption, it being small and all of last winter’s formation. Its width
I estimate at about 22 miles. We then stood to the S. E., with a fine fair
Avind.
On the 9th at noon, when in lat. 70 deg. 2 min. N., and long. 62 deg. 20 min.
W., a pack or body of very heavy ice was observed ahead, and which compelled
us to haul to the N. E. for about 20 miles, and we then stood 50 miles true east,
when we again shaped our course down the straits; since which time we met
Avith no pack, but passed a number of bergs.
We got to the southward of Cape Farewell on the afternoon of the 14th Sep-
tember, but the wind hanging to the eastward Ave did not cross its longitudinal
meridian until the morning of the 18th September, being then in latitude
55 deg. 30 min. N. I may here mention, that although the ship was so long
beset last year in the ice, and has since passed through so much of it, that she
has neA’er once received a nip, and is now as strong and tight as when.she left
England.
1 regret exceedingly not being able to fulfil my instructions of last year, and
can only assure their Lordships that no exertions were wanting on the part of
myself, the officers, and crew, to do so: had last season been as favourable as the
present'for the navigation of the Arctic seas, I have no doubt I should have found
the “ Investigator,” or “ Enterprise ” before they left their winter quarters.

Sir,. “ Prince Albert,” Aberdeen, 1 October 1850.
I have the honour to report my return to. England, and. take the earliest
opportunity of communicating, for my Lords Commissioners’ information, that
traces of the missing expedition under Sir John Franklin have.been found at
Cape Riley and,Beechey Island, at the entrance to the Wellington Channel-
The annexed document was copied- from one left in a cairn at Cape Riley, by
Captain Ommaney, the day previous to our visiting it.
We observed five places where tents had been pitched, or stones placed, as if
they had been used for keeping the lower part of the tents down; also great
quantities of beef, pork, and birds’ bones, a piece of rope with the Woolwich
naval mark in it (yellow), part of which I have enclosed.
Her Majesty’s ships “ Assistance’.’ and “Intrepid,” when last seen by .me on
. the
see


the 25th of August, whilst off Point Innis, appeared to be well over with Cape
Hotham, carrying a press of sail, with a strong breeze from the westward.
Penny’s vessels were also in the entrance of the strait, and two American* brigan-
tines working over towards Cape Hotham.
As an officer belonging to Her Majesty’s service, although not having been
especially sent out by Her Majesty’s Government, I deem it incumbent on me to
inform their Lordships of the part this vessel has taken in the search.
The “Prince Albert,” under my command, left Aberdeen on the sth June ■
last. On the 2d of July, after experiencing a succession of westerly gales, we
arrived off Cape Farewell. On the 15th, met some whalers off the Black Hook
returning to the southward, not having been able to accomplish the passage
round Melville Bay. On the 19th entered the ice* and on the 21st came up
-with Sir John Ross in a labyrinth of heavy icebergs. On the 23d, met the
remainder of the fleet of whalers coming to the southward..
On the 26th, made out Captain Austin’s and Mr. Penny’s vessels, beset in the
ice, about 15 or 20 miles to the northward of us. From this time till the 9th of
August we were generally beset, occasionally experiencing some very heavy
shocks, when we succeeded in getting into a lead, and passed Captain Austin
-within a few miles, still beset. On the 10th his ships, by the aid of the steamers,
got into open water, and were tow'ed past us in a calm. The same evening they
were again beset. On the 12th, the steamers, assisted by blasting, forced a pas-
sage through. It being calm, Captain Austin very kindly offered myself and
Sir John Ross a tow clear of the ice, which we most thankfully and gladly availed
ourselves of. On the 14th we communicated with the natives at Cape York,
who gave us to understand that a ship answering the description of the “ North
Star ” had wintered somewhere about" Wolstenholme Sound ; the same evening
the “Assistance” was dispatched to ascertain the truth of this report.
On the 17th I parted company with Her Majesty’s ships “Resolute” and
“ Pioneer,” having previously arranged with Captain Austin to undertake the
examination of the south side of Lancaster Sound and Barrow Strait from Cape
Liverpool to Port Leopold, whilst he visited Possession and Pond’s Bays ; on the
18th we made the land five miles to the eastward of Cape Liverpool, closely
inspecting the coast, keeping within a quarter of a mile of the shore as far as the
Wollaston Islands. When off Cape Hay, it was blowing a gale from the'east-
ward-; we therefore found it impossible to land to ascertain if the fuel or provi-
sions had been touched since they were deposited there last year by Mr. Parker,
of the “ Truelove.” From what we could see from our deck, they did not appear
to have been molested ; the flagstaff had been blown down, and was lying on
the top of the coals. On the outer or western Wollaston Island, a notice was left
recording our visit, and the disposition of Her Majesty’s ships,-&c.
The gale having increased would not admit of our further examination of the
coast at this time; we were obliged in consequence of its violence to stand out in
the strait, and heave the vessel to in the midst of drift ice. On its moderating
the next day, we found ourselves off Cape York. As it was still blowing strong, I
bore up for Port Leopold. At 3 a. m. of the 21st, arrived off the harbour, but found
it closed with heavy ice ; with much difficulty our boat succeeded in getting in,
by being hauled some distance over the ice. It appeared by a document left at
the flagstaff’, that the “ North Star ” had called here on the 13th, but from the
state of the ice was unable to land her provisions, and had left-this to attempt to
land them at Ports Bowen or Neill; otherwise everything appeared to have been
undisturbed since Her Majesty’s ships “Enterprise” and “Investigator” left
last year. As it was intended by the parties who fitted this vessel out that she
should proceed to Brentford Bay, and commence operations from that place, I
made the best of my way up Prince Regent’s Inlet in order to effect that object.
.As we drew up towards Fury Beach the land ice gradually extended off the shore,
commencing a little to the southward of Port Leopold up to within 10 or 15
miles of Fury Point, when it stretched directly across the inlet, apparently in front
of Port Bowen. Finding great quantities of drift ice setting up the inlet, and
likely to close me in, with no port to take refuge in, I stood out to the northward,
with intention of proceeding down the western side of North Somerset; on
reaching the north end of Leopold Island, I found the pack extending from thence
across Barrow Strait towards the entrance of Wellington Channel; after having
forced our way through great quantities of heavy drift ice, the vessel receiving
man}' severe concussions, we got in with the land between Capes Herschel and

Hurd, and examined the coast as far as Point Innes in the Wellington Channel,
without finding any further traces of the missing parties, with the exception of
those already mentioned at Cape Riley.
There being no possibility of my penetrating to the south-west, as I had
intended, from the heavy ice in that direction, I ran back to Prince Regent Inlet;
the appearance of the ice being much the same, with no port to enter in the vici-
nity of my future operations, I was most reluctantly obliged to give up the idea
of remaining in these regions, more particularly as the season was fast advancing
when the ice begins to form ; and I knew from experience, if this vessel was once
caught, there would be no chance of our getting out again, as she has no power to
bore through it. I therefore determined, after most mature consideration, to return
to England. On the 27th I ran into Eardley Bay, near Cape York, and landed
a notice, with some pemican ; before our boat could get on board, a gale com-
menced, with a heavy sea, which nearly drove us on shore under the cape. On
the 28th I examined the western side of the entrance to Admiralty Inlet, from
thence across the Elwin Bay, keeping close along shore to Possession Bay, off
which place I fell in with the “North Star,” who I found had met with the
same impediments in Prince Regent Inlet as ourselves, and had consequently not
succeeded in entering either Ports Bowen or Neill, but had landed her provi-
sions inside the Wollaston Islands. We found that the “ Resolute” had visited
Possession Bay on the 18th, Captain Austin having left the night previous in the
“ Pioneer,” to visit Ponds Bay. On the 2d and 3d of September I examined the
shores of Ponds Bay, but could discover no traces of Captain Austin’s having been
there ; perhaps the “ North Star ” may have been more fortunate, as I saw her
standing in on the evening of my departure. On the 4th we lost sight of Cape
Bowen near Ponds Bay, and on the Ist instant arrived here, being the last and
smallest vessel that left England and the first that arrived in Barrow Strait.

EXTRACT of a LETTER from Captain F. W. Beechey, R.N., to Captain Hamilton ,
R.N., Secretary of the Admiralty; dated 9th October 1850.
As it is important to know whether the bones and rope found at Cape Riley
<x>uld possibly have been left there by the crew of my boat when we landed
therein 1819, I forward you an extract from my journal, by which you will
perceive that we left after dinner, and were on shore only a very short time ; it
is not at all probable that the crew would have any salt provisions with them
on that occasion, and the bones, I may safely say, were not left there by us.
The rope has evidently been manufactured since, by the yellow yarn which
runs through it, as it was not used in the manufacture of our cordage until
several years after the above date.
As to the foundations for the tents, I think they could not have been there
when I landed, or they must have been seen, for we ascended the hills and
looked about in every direction, so that all the traces are decidedly since the time
of our landing.

■make observations and examine the coast. Rowing on shore the stream was
found setting fast to the eastward, which on landing proved to be the ebb tide,
as the water had fallen nearly four feet by the shore, and continued to fall while
■the boat remained on shore.
The flood tide therefore here comes from the eastward.
The rocks were undermined in places, and in others rendered quite smooth
•for 13 feet above the high-water mark by the continued dashing of the sea,
which seemed to indicate an occasional open space of water of large extent.
A fair wind sprang up just as the boats landed, so that we had only time to
•ascend a hill for the purpose of taking a view of the coast and land to the west-
ward.

or eight miles in circumference, and very high (Beechey Island) : the eastern
side was quite perpendicular, and the earth had so fallen away towards the other
extremity, as to give it the appearance of being columnar. As we ascended the
height by means of the earth which had fallen down, a great many fossil shells
and an abundance of coral and madrepore was found. It was so abundant that
it was difficult to find a part entirely free from it. One large block was brought
on board for examination. °
The other boat which landed with Captain Sabine, brought on board some
plants and a glacerous gull. The variation was found to be 128 deg. W.;
unfortunately our stay was too short for any observations on the dip of the
needle.
At a quarter before seven, the ship was off the western end of Beechey
Island.
Two channels now opened out, one leading to the north (Wellington Chan-
nel), and the other due west; not a particle of ice was to be seen, although the
weather was so clear that we could have seen land at a very great distance, and it
seemed as if a breeze alone was required to ensure us a good run for the night
at least.

COPY of a LETTER from Captain Sir Edward Parry, R.N., to the Secretary
of the Admiralty.
Sir, Haslar Hospital, 11 October 1850.
On receiving your letter of the 7th instant, and the box containing bones,
canvas, rope, and wood recently found at Cape Riley, upon which their Lord-
ships desire a report from Sir John Richardson and myself, I considered the
best way of complying with their Lordships’ wishes, would be, to refer the bones
and wood for examination to Sir John Richardson, whose skill and experience
in such matters are greatly superior to mine, and to give my own attention more
particularly to the pieces of rope and canvas.
I have now the-honour to enclose Sir John Richardson’s Report, and to offer
the following suggestions of my own.
The only questions of any material interest, are two: —
Ist. Were the articles left at Cape Riley by any of Sir John Franklin’s
people ?
2d. If so, about what period ?
Independently of Sir John Franklin’s expedition, there are, primd facie, only
three possible ways of accounting for the rope and canvas being found at Cape
Riley,
Ist. They might have been left by the parties under the command of Lieu-
tenants Beechey and Hoppner, whom I sent to examine the coast on our first
discovery of it on the 22d of August 1819.
2d. If the rope and canvas belonged to the “ Fury,” when we lost her in Prince
Regent Inlet in 1825 (having landed all her stores on the beach for heaving
the ship down), it is possible that these articles may have been discovered by
the Esquimaux, appropriated to their own use, and carried to Cape Riley in the
course of their perigrinations.
3d. The articles might have been conveyed by one of Sir James Ross’s travel-
ling parties, detached from his ships in Port Leopold in the spring of the year
1849.
In dealing with these possibilities we may, I think, arrive at the following
conclusions:
Ist. It is quite certain that no encampment was formed at Cape Riley by
Lieutenants Beechey and Hoppner; the parties were on shore only a few minutes,
having been recalled in consequence of a fair wind springing up.
Nor could the piece of rope have been left by them, since the yellow worsted
thread is pronounced by the officers of Chatham yard to fix, beyond all doubt,
the date of its manufacture “ subsequent to the year 1824, as the order
assigning
see


assigning different coloured worsteds to each yard bears date 28th April of that
year.”
2nd. The order just referred to was issued exactly three weeks before I left
England with the “ Hecla” and “ Fury,” on that voyage in which the latter
vessel was lost in Prince Regent Inlet; that is, I left the Nore on the 19th of
May of the same year (1824), having quitted Deptford on the Bth.
These dates coincide so nearly with that of the order above quoted, that I
deemed it advisable to write to Captain Richards, superintendent of Chatham
Dockyard, to inquire whether he thought it possible that the new regulation of
inserting the yellow worsted may, as a special case, have been anticipated, in
furnishing rope to the “ Hecla ” and “ Fury.” Captain Richards’ very clear and
satisfactory reply (of which I enclose a copy) proves, beyond all doubt, that the
rope was not supplied to.the “ Furywhilst the circumstance of its having been
made of Hungarian hemp, shows that it was not manufactured prior to
1841.
3rd. The third and last question is merely one of fact; and it has, I under-
stand, been ascertained from Sir James Ross, that the party he sent out to the
northward from Port Leopold did not land quite so far westward as Cape Hurd,
so that they never approached Cape Riley within 30 miles.
The above facts appear to me to lead to the inevitable conclusion that the rope
was left at Cape Riley by Sir John Franklin’s expedition; and in all probability
the canvas likewise, as that also bears the Queen’s mark.
With respect to the period at which this occurred, which can only be con-
jectured by the state and appearance of the several articles picked up, their
Lordships will observe from Sir John Richardson’s very interesting report, that,
so far as the question admits of solution, there is at least a strong probability of
their having been left at Gape Riley about the year 1845.
I would therefore submit to their Lordships what appears to me the most
probable conclusion ; namely, that Sir John Franklin’s ships having reached this
neighbourhood on their way out in 1845, and being stopped there for a time by
the state of the ice (as I was, and as we know the present searching expeditions
have been), a- couple of boats may have been detached from each ship to land at
Cape Riley to make, the usual observations, collect specimens, and examine the
coast, a common occurrence in. all such expeditions. If detained for. a. night, each
boat’s crew may have pitched its own lent, and one for the officers, making five in.
all. The only circumstance which I cannot explain (supposing the encampment
to have been formed by Sir John Franklin’s people) is, the large size of the
tents, which Mr. Snow has just described to us as 12 feet in diameter and upwards,
and which is certainly very large for tents generally used on such occasions.
This may in part perhaps be explained by the stones, being thrown from the
centre, and the circle thus considerably enlarged when striking the tents.
At the commencement of their enterprise (which, looking to former discoveries,
the entrance to Wellington Inlet may fairly be considered), a part}' from the
“ Erebus” and “Terror” might not think it of any importance to leave a notice
of their visit, though it is much to be wished that they had ; and I should hope,
that at some more advanced position, Captain Ommaney and the other officers
will have succeeded in discovering some such notice, affording positive informa-
tion of the missing ships, and of the route they are likely to have pursued.
■ On the other hand, I feel confident that, if the expedition or any portion of the
people had landed at Cape Riley at a more advanced period, when success began
to be doubtful, and especially if in distress, or with a view to effect their escape
from the ice, some distinct notice of the facts would have been left at a point so
prominent and so likely to be visited as Cape Riley.
I may add, that under such circumstances, it is very highly improbable that
provisions so heavy and bulky as salt beef and pork would have formed a part of
of their supply, and mutton would, of course, have been wholly out of the
question. •

REPORT on certain Substances found on Cape Riley in August last, and brought
to England by Captain Forsyth, of the “ Prince Albert,” by John Richardson,.
Medical Inspector of Haslar Hospital.
Royal Hospital at Haslar r
Sir, 10 October 1850.
In compliance with the instructions conveyed by the memorandum of the
Secretary of the Admiralty of the 7th instant, addressed to you, I proceed to,
report on the following articles, stated to have been picked up on Cape Riley by;
Mr. Snow, of the “Prince Albert.”
No. 1. A piece of bone 4 h inches long, being the head and part of the shaft of
the fourth rib of the left side of an ox. This has been chopped from the other
end by the blow of an axe.
No. 2. Six inches and a half of the upper end of the seventh rib of the right
side of an ox ; the lower end of the rib has been sawed off, and the head broken off-
A large part of the surface of this bone is corroded as if from the action of salt.
This is the rib of a larger animal than that to which No. 1 belonged, and the
head has been broken off recently, that is, subsequently to the alterations of the
rest of the surface by exposure, &c.
No. 3. Part of the seventh dorsal vertebra of an ox, being the piece ta t articu-
lates with the head of the rib.
No. 4. Is the lower articular process of the left shoulder bone of a small hog.
No. 5. Is the upper end of the right thigh bone of a sheep, probably of the
Orkney or Highland breed, and rather old. The bone is of a hard compact
texture, which excited a suspicion in my mind of its being part of the thigh bone
of a small northern reindeer, but having no corresponding bone of that animal
for comparison, this is a mere suspicion, and it corresponds closely with the bone
of a small sheep, to which therefore lam inclined to refer it. It has been notched
by the corner of a hatchet or other sharp cutting instrument.
These five pieces of bone are all that bear on the present inquiry; they have
lost little of their original weight, and indurated animal matter, showing large
nucleated and common fat globules, under the microscope, is contained in the
cancellated structure of numbers 1 and 2. There is a quantity of animal fafc
in the bottom of the shaft of No. 5.
A few granular and simple fat cells, analogous to those existing in marrow, can
still be perceived in this fat when examined with the microscope, but probably
from exposure to cold, this marrow', which I conclude it to be, has undergone
considerable deterioration.
All the five bones have been much worn or rounded by attrition, most probably
by rolling among gravel in a watercourse or on the beach, within the wash of
the sea.
The sharp edges of the sawn and notched pieces are smoothed off, and the
softer ends of the bones rubbed down. The head of rib No. 2, alone, has been,
broken since the rest of the bone was exposed to friction.
Taking the climate into consideration, and particularly the shortness of each
season, to which the bones can have been exposed to atmospherical influences,
or to the action of water, they being of course covered with snow for 10 months
in each year, I should say that they cannot have been reduced to their present
state in less than four or five years, since the flesh was removed from them
and that they are not much older than that time. A small dipterous insect had
taken shelter in one of the cells of No. 2, and died there.
The other bones, viz., No. 6, a portion of the right shin bone of a young
• walrus


walrus; No. 7, the lumbar vertebra of a reindeer; No. 8, the left shoulder bone
of a young seal; No. 9, a portion of the rib of a walrus, are of very old date,
have lost much of their animal matter, are more or less disintegrated, are
partially clothed with ancient lichens, and have been most probably exposed to
the weather for a half or a whole century, or even longer. They appear to have
been imbedded in soil partially or wholly, or lying amongst moist grass, and not
on clean gravel, where I conclude, from their condition, the others were
found.
None of the bones bear the mark of a tooth, as they would unquestionably
have done had the place been visited by Esquimaux with dogs since they were
deposited there.
The other articles picked up at the same place, and sent to be reported on,
are, No. 10, a piece of -inch rope, now measuring 44 inches in length, and
having an eye spliced at one end, but which is said to have been when found
a foot longer, with an eye at both ends. It is bleached on the surface, but is
fresh within, so that in some places there remains enough of tar to soil the finger.
This rope has been fully reported upon from Chatham, and the date of its ma-
nufacture fixed as subsequent to 1841. No. 11, a piece of old canvas, with
Queen’s mark, seemingly a part of a boat’s swab, the length corresponding, and
the nail-hole to which it has been fastened, to the handle remaining. No. 12,
a chip of drift timber, the surface of a knot, which has been exposed for very
many years to the action of the atmosphere, so as to break down greatly the
connexions of its woody fibres. Subsequent to this exposure, and recently,
it has been cut from the piece of drift timber to which it belonged by an axe, or
other sharp-cutting instrument, not a stone hatchet. It has all the external
character of wood grown in an arctic climate.
On being examined under the microscope its structure was found to differ
essentially from that of a coniferous tree, or of any other tree that grows on the
banks of the American rivers flowing into the Arctic Sea, from pines and firs in
the absence of glandular discs, and from the others in the size and form of the
ducts and their markings. It corresponds most closely with the wood of the ash,
and from the amount of intracellular deposit in the specimen, it is inferred
to have belonged to a tree of considerable age. It has most probably drifted
from the Asiatic coast, and its being found at Cape Riley, bears on the currents
and passages of the Arctic Sea.
The mark of the axe wdiich it bears indicates the visit of Europeans to the
spot where it was found, as it does not appear to have been long exposed since
the cut was made ; that is not very many years.
As the recent bones have all been rolled and worn down, there is a possibility
of their having been cast ashore by the ice; had they been left at the time of
Captain Beechey’s visit to the same place, on the 22d of August 1819, I do not
think that the oily matter in their cavities would have been found so fresh ; but
we have no certain observations on the effects of so rigorous a climate in
preserving animal matter; and it is to be observed, that while the interval
between the thawing and freezing of the bones again does not exceed six weeks
in each year, 31 years’ exposure would be equivalent to only two or three years
in the temperate climate of England.
The beef bones, almost without doubt, belong to the ordinary pieces of salt beef
supplied to the navy, as their length, and the way in which they have been
chopped and sawed correspond closely with bones from a beef cask which
I examined at Clarence Yard. No. 4, I am inclined with as little doubt to
consider as the remains of a piece of pork. No. 5 may be the relic of an
officer’s dinner on mutton. The whole evidence to be derived from their con-
dition points to their deposit subsequent to Captain Beechey’s visit, and prior
to Sir James Ross wintering at Cape Leopold, and therefore, indicates that they
were left by parties from Sir John Franklin’s ships in the first year of his voyage,
when the ships probably detained waiting for an opening in the ice, and officers
bad landed from them to make observations.
Since the above report was drawn up, I have had the advantage of an interview
with Captain Forsyth and Mr. Snow, in the presence of Sir Edward Parry, and
have not found it necessary to modify the conclusions I had previously come to.
From Mr. Snow I learned that the crescentic spit, or low point which runs out
from the bluff headland of Cape Riley, has a convex surface, rising in the middle
and towards the foot of the cliff 12 or 14 feet above the water. The cliff, formed

in that part of earth mixed with fragments of the adjacent and underlying
limestone, is ascended by successive terraces, and on the first six feet above the
spit, or 20 feet above the water, the piece of rope was found. It had escaped the
notice of Captain Ommaney, who on the preceding day collected and carried
away the evidences that he found of the visit of Sir John Franklin’s people, for
such is the tenor of the note which he left.
The bones were picked up by the seamen of Mr. Snow’s boat, around certain
rings of stones on the spit, while that gentleman was busy transcribing Captain
Ommaney’s note of the 24th with Lieutenant De Haven’s of the 25th, and adding
to the originals a notice of his own visit.
Captain Forsyth, on interrogating the seamen, learned that they left behind
many birds’ bones, and brought away only the beef bones, and such as looked
most like the relics of ships’ provisions.
The tide rises there from three to four feet, and Captain Beechey found the
rocks worn smooth and hollowed out by the action of the waves, and ice to the
height of 13 feet. The influences of these agents, with the effects of the stony
rills emanating from melting snow, and pouring down the sides of the cliff, will
account fully for the bones having been so rolled since they were left.
The rings of stones, five in number, vary, Mr. Snow says, from 12 feet in
diameter to twice as much.
They did not strike his eye on landing, but his attention was called to them
by the men, who also observed two or three stones placed so as to rest a kettle
on. Captain Beechey says that had circular stones been on the spit when he
landed, he would have noticed them ; their subsequent formation points to the
visit of Sir John Franklin’s party. On the other hand, if that party made fires
either of coal or wood, the remains of the fires, if sought for, would certainly be
found.
The Esquimaux use oil-lamps, which produce much smoke, for cooking, and
place stones for the support of their stone kettles; so that, unless the encamp-
ments had been examined with reference to these points, and to the indica-
tions given by the surfaces of the stones as to whether they had been turned
within a few years, no very certain deductions can be made, especially as the
rings were not so conspicuous as to strike the eye at once. But there is nothing
to invalidate the opinion formed on other grounds of the spot affording traces of
the discovery ships.
In the examination of the wood and animal matters, I have availed myself of
the experience of my assistant, Dr. Clark, in the use of the microscope, and beg :
to enclose a note of some of his observations.
I have, &c.

Sub-Enclosure to Enclosure 1 to No. 7 (C.)
Memorandum of some of the Microscopic Observations made on the Wood and
Animal Matter of the Bones brought by Captain Forsyth from Cape Riley,
by Andrew Clark, m. d., Assistant Surgeon.
Examined with the naked eye the portion of wood submitted to me for exami-
nation, appeared of a pale ashen grey colour, contorted, gnarled, and disposed
in wavy fibrous fasciculi. It was much shrivelled also; the surface had a shining,,
almost silvery appearance, and there were other indications of its prolonged sub-
jection to the influences of air and water; it resembled a piece of oak, in fact,
after long exposure. At the suggestion of Sir John Richardson, I made it my
first object to determine whether the wood belonged to any indigenous tree.
From the size of the woody fibres ( pleurenchyma ), and the absence of the so-
called “ glandular discs,” the wood evidently belonged to none of the coniferse.
From the birch the specimen under examination differed in the size of the
woody fibres and in the character of the porous vessels or ducts (bothrenchyma).
In the birch the woody fibres are short and spindle-shaped ; the porous vessels
are larger; one side of many of them is barred or scalariform, and the markings
upon them are larger and more regular than in the specimen examined. From
the willow, also, the wood under examination is distinguished by the character
. of
. CnciO sUte


of its porous vessels. In the former the vessels are larger, the markings upon
them are pretty regularly hexagonal, each hexagonal spot being about 1200th
of an inch in diameter, and having a central, sometimes double diffractive
nuclear spot, which by transmitted light is of a bright yellowish brown colour.
The structure of the wood of the poplar resembles that of the willow, except
that the markings on the ducts are larger, being about 900th of an inch in dia-
meter, and that there is but one central oblong nuclear spot. The willow also,
therefore, differed essentially from the wood in question.
From the oak, which it resembled externally, it was found to differ essentially
in its minute structure. In the oak the porous tissue is more abundant, its
transverse diameter is smaller, and the markings upon it not only larger and
more irregular in shape and size than, but different in character from, the speci-
men sent for examination.
The markings of the porous ducts in the oak consist of a central yellowish dif-
fractive spot surrounded by a fine black, circumferential line.
The spot is oblong, and about one-fourth the size of the investing ring. In
the size and character of its woody fibres and porous ducts the specimen under
examination corresponds almost exactly with those of the ash; the only perceptible
difference between them is in the amount of intracellular deposit, that being
by far the greatest in the specimen under examination.
From that circumstance I infer that the wood has been removed from a tree
of considerable age.
I have compared sections of the wood sent with those of various other trees,
but as the results are irrelevant to the-object in view, I forbear giving them
expression.
From the examinations made, no doubt is left in my mind as to the character
of the wood sent for inspection; it is a piece of old ash.
From the disposition of the hestological elements of the wood, and from the
presence of much refractive matter around the woody fibres, I am disposed to
believe that the specimen sent has been removed from the immediate neighbour-
hood of a knotty excrescence at or near the root of the stem.
The position of the knot I infer from the amount of porous tissue'present in
the specimen, and the disposition of it around the ligneous fibres.
The matter removed from the bones was whitish, had a meliceritious appear-
ance, and was readily melted by the heat of the hand ; it contained, along with
a very considerable quantity of organic debris, three different kinds of fat cells ;
two of them almost peculiar to the marrow of bones. Associated with these was
much fatty granular matter and fatty crystals, the results, doubtless, of the dis-
integration of the cells. From the presence of this matter in the cancelli of the
bones, and from the character it exhibited under the microscope, 1 infer that it
cannot have been many years since the flesh was removed from them.
The matter removed from the bones I believe to be marrow, modified in struc-
ture and appearance by the influence of the various physical agencies to which
it must have been exposed.

Sir, Chatham Yard, 9 October 1850.
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday’s
date, and in reply thereto have to inform you that a close examination of the
records of this yard shows,
Ist. That the first supply of yellow worsted for making rope was received at
this yard from the contractor on the 11th of June 1824, and was issued to the
ropery for use on the 14th of the same month.
2d. That there is no reason whatever to suppose that yellow worsted could
have been used prior to the 14th of June, in anticipation of the order of the
28th April 1824, as, up to the 19th of February in that year, white worsted was
supplied from the store to the ropery, and no further supply occurred till the
14th of June 1824, when the yellow, came into use.

3d. Not any cordage of from one to two-inch was supplied from the yard to
Deptford or Woolwich between the Ist January 1824 and the sailing of the
expedition under your command on the 19th of May following, which is
accounted for by the Woolwich ropery being then in operation.
4 th. Any cordage supplied from Woolwich at that time must have borne the
mark of white worsted then used as a universal mark, and after the order of the
28th of April 1824 it continued the distinguishing mark at that yard ; the re-
maining store of white worsted was transferred from this yard to Woolwich, to
be there consumed. The clearness and accuracy of the storekeeper’s report to
me, and the great care he has taken in searching the records of his office, esta-
blish these facts as indisputable, and leave no room whatever for doubt as to the
rope found at Cape Riley (a specimen of which was sent me for examination)
having been manufactured in this yard after the 14th of June 1824, and there-
fore it could not possibly have been any part of the supply furnished to either of
the ships composing the expedition to the Arctic Seas under your command,
which sailed in May of that year.
Indeed I may go further, and give it as my decided opinion that the rope found
at Cape Riley by Commander Forsyth must have been made in this yard sub-
sequently to 1841.
The hemp used in its manufacture is clearly recognized as Hungarian by the
master-ropemaker, a man of much ability in his calling, and who, after ample
time for the fullest consideration, repeats his opinion as to its character most
clearly and decidedly, and it stands proved that no hemp of that growth was
received into this yard prior to 1841.
I hope this statement will prove satisfactory to you ; but if you wish to refer
further to the records of this yard, I shall have great pleasure in attending to
your communication.

OBSERVATIONS by Colonel Sabine, R.A., on Articles found at Cape Riley.
Perhaps it may throw some light on the fact of there being five tents that the
magnetical instruments supplied to Sir John Franklin’s expedition would require
more tents than any previous or any subsequent expedition.
There were three magnetical instruments, each of which would require a
separate tent, and these three tents would only be entered at stated periods for
observation.
Besides these three, there would be required a fourth tent for miscellaneous
observations, and a fifth for the protection of the observers.
I was therefore always prepared to expect that whenever the traces of a winter
station of the “ Erebus” and “ Terror” should be found, there would be some
appearance discovered of five tents in the locality where the instruments of the
“ Erebus ” should be placed, and five for the “ Terror.”
I think it probable that the two ships would establish their observations at
some little distance apart from each other, because it would contribute to convey
a character of independence to each. I think it far more probable that the
traces which have been discovered are those of a winter station than of a station
occupied for a few days during the season of navigation, from the quantity of
the remains of provisions which I understand to have been found, and which are
much more than are likely to have been consumed by an observing party during*
the very short time that the instruments would have been put up at a temporary
station.
It is quite possible, however, to suppose that the ships may have been stopped
during the season of navigation, and without any immediate prospect of getting
on.


on, about the time of the monthly term days*, and the tents may have been
established, and the instruments landed for observation on the term day ; that is
to say, they may have all been in order for commencing about 12 hours before,
and the observations continued for 24 hours; but at the close of the term day
they would, without doubt, have been embarked with all convenient despatch.

Sir, Haslar Hospital, 1G October 1850.
With reference to the reports of Sir John Richardson and myself, of the 11th
instant, relative to the several articles found at Cape Riley, and brought home
by Commander Forsyth, in the “Prince Albert,” I beg to state to you, for the
information, of my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that we have since
understood Colonel Sabine to have suggested that the encampment of five tents
may have been made by the expedition of Sir John Franklin for the purpose of
receiving the several instruments for magnetic observations. As this suggestion
seems to me to account for the large size of the circles of stones, which we could
not before satisfactorily explain, and also for certain erections of stones in the
centre of each circle, which were described by Mr. Snow as looking like fire-
places, but without any marks of smoke, and which were probably stands for the
instruments, or used for steadying them, I beg leave to draw the attention of
their Lordships to Colonel Sabine’s suggestion, which appears to confirm our
former conclusions, as to Sir John Franklin’s people having landed at Cape
Riley.

Franklin, and they were the only days on which, during the season of navigation, those magnetic
instruments, requiring the tents above alluded to, would be employed.

Her Majesty’s Ship “ Lady Franklin,” off Opernowick,
Sir, Tuesday, 4 June 1850.
I have the honour to request that you will inform my Lords Commissioners
' of the Admiralty that the expedition under my command arrived off Opernowick
yesterday, at 4 p. m., having been one month from Lievely, in consequence of
the south-west winds.
According to the arrangement before made, the services of the sub-governor,
Herr Johan Carl Christian Peterson, have been retained for interpreting, at the
pay of 78 I. per annum, 1 /. 10 s. being paid monthly by the Governor to his
wife out of this sum.
The expedition will sail from this at 4 a.m. to-morrow, that time being allowed
for the sub-governor getting his outfit in a state of readiness, and making the
necessary arrangements with the Governor. He is a person whom I have long
thought of, and I consider myself fortunate in obtaining his services, from his
perfect familiarity with the English, Danish and Esquimaux languages.
It was necessary to grant Herr Fleucher, the Governor, a guarantee that he
should incur no risk with the Danish Government for permitting the departure
of Mr. Peterson, their regulations being very strict on this point.
I had communication with Professor Rinck (now at Omenak), who would
gladly have accompanied me, but I was unable, on account of the distance, to
have a personal interview with him, which is the more to be regretted, as I
believe lie would have been of great service, not only as an interpreter, but also
in a scientific capacity.
I am sure their Lordships will be pleased to hear that my little vessels sus-
tained an immense pressure in North East Bay on the 18th ultimo, without the
slightest damage, and that they have otherwise shown themselves all that could
be wished.

I have also the pleasure of informing their Lordships that the crew of both
vessels are in good health, and that the prospect of an early north passage is still

I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords Com-
missioners of the Admiralty, that the expedition under my command reached
this on the 12th July, and has since been detained by the S. W. winds, which
have prevailed the greater part of the season, so as to render this year backward
in the extreme.
The wind, however, is now from the N. E., and the ice is opening very fast;
if it continue but for five days we shall be in the west water.
Captain Austin’s expedition is now about 10 miles to the northward of us,
having joined us on the 2d July in latitude 73 deg. 25 min., and longitude
56 deg. 20 min. W.
We have been rendering mutual services, and otherwise doing all in our power
to forward the object in view.
As yet no trace of the “ North Star” has been come upon, but it is to be hoped
she has reached Lancaster Sound.
The crews of the several expeditions are in the best of health and spirits, not
one being on the sick list.

COPY of a LETTER from Mr. William Penny, Commanding Her Majesty’s
Ship “Lady Franklin,” to the Secretary of the Admiralty.
Her Majesty’s Ship “ Lady Franklin,” Lancaster Sound,
Sir, 21 August 1850.
I beg to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the-
Admiralty, that the vessels under m 3" command got clear of Melville Bay on
Sunda)" the 11th August.
On the following day I landed at Cape York, and had communication with
the Esquimaux.
On the 18th Captain Austin’s expedition came up, and next morning I was
informed of a report, said to be got from the same Esquimaux I had on board
for several hours; it was to the effect, that Sir John Franklin’s ships had been
lost, 40 miles to the northward, and the crews murdered.
I immediately offered my services, together with those of my interpreter, and
was happy to find that the sole foundation for the tidings was that the “ North
Star ” had wintered in the situation referred to.
Immediately on the report being cleared up, Captain Austin left with Sir John
Boss’s and Captain Forsyth’s schooners in tow, and we were detained by calms
and bay ice, so that we did not reach Jones’ Sound till midnight on the 18th.
We were prevented from approaching within 25 miles of the Sound by a chain of
immense floes, and were obliged to haul out N.W. (per compass) to get clear of
the ice. We entered Lancaster Sound the following night in company with the
American schooners, having strong winds from the S.W. (per compass).
For the last 24 hours we have been dodging in the neighbourhood of Admi-
ralty Inlet, a heavy sea running, and very thick weather, my wish being to get
intelligence of places where provisions had been landed by the “ North Star:”
that vessel is now in sight ahead.
I have prepared this despatch for their Lordships, to forward by Mr, Saunders,
who will be able to inform you satisfactorily of the state of Lancaster Sound.
* * * *
From the information I have received from Mr. Saunders, it is at present my
intention to put my vessels into some bight on the north shore of the Sound,
allowing the ice to drive past them, and I shall then use every endeavour to push
to the westward, and follow out their Lordships’ instructions in that quarter.
Before concluding, I would beg to allude to the orders transmitted to Mr.
Saunders, relative to depositing his provisions on the Island of Disco.
By such a course being pursued, an otherwise invaluable supply is rendered
perfectly useless to all the expeditions at present in this quarter, and we are'
deprived of what we had reckoned upon, viz. a deposit in the Sound to fall back
upon, in case misfortune should compel us to abandon our vessels.
The report received from the Esquimaux at Cape York has proved correct to
the letter; and I cannot but refer to the service my interpreter, Mr. Peterson,
has rendered on this occasion, in exposing a story of Sir John Ross’s Esquimaux*
calculated to do much mischief.
I have, See.

EXTRACT of a PRIVATE LETTER from Mr. William Penny, Commanding Her
Majesty’s Ship “Lady Franklin,” to Captain Hamilton, R.N., Secretary of
the Admiralty, dated 21 August 1850.
Our passage through Melville Bay has been tedious in the extreme, and
nothing but south-west winds; however, my little vessels answer my expectatioa
to the letter.
From the report of Mr. Saunders of the state of Barrow Straits, it is my inten-
tion to put my vessels into a bight on the north shore, and allow the ice to drive
past us, or if by any possibility warp along the shore until I get to the westward
of this body of ice into the water. I shall then endeavour to carry out my ideas
hy


by searching along the north shore of Barrow Strait unto Melville Island.
Captain Austin has not made his appearance in the Sound, at least the “ North
Star ” has not seen any of the vessels. I spoke the American schooners, but
we soon left them out of sight astern. On the 20th it blew a gale : run nine
knots until we reached Admiralty Inlet, when we dodged until it should mode-
rate, to take a look at Port Leopold, to see if there was any intelligence of Sir
John Franklin or the “ North Star.” However, I got anxious to see what state
Barrow Strait was in with ice; so after dodging for 24 hours, bore away for the
north side of Barrow Strait. At noon of the 21st, the “ North Star ” was seen
coming out of the fog; at 2p. m. boarded her with their Lordships’ despatches.
You may judge my surprise to learn that he was to proceed to the Island of
Disco to land his provisions. I stated that their Lordships had calculated on
us finding them on the east side, and not in Lancaster Sound. I have endea-
voured to prevail on him to land some at Navy Board Inlet; however, he has
not given me his final answer.
If Mr. Saunders breaks through his instructions bymy advice, I trust Captain
Hamilton will do his best to see he does not suffer.
I have great hope of being able to reach a high longitude, for we have a full
month yet for operations.
I am confident their Lordships never intended that those provisions should
be again carried to the east side, and landed on the Island of Disco, I have
stated this to Mr. Saunders, so I should be sorry if any blame should be attached
to him. I must conclude by stating that while Captain Austin was in company,
we rendered one another mutual services.

Extract of a DESPATCH frdm Sir John Ross to the Governor and Committee
of the Hudson’s Bay Company, dated 13 August 1850. Baffin’s Bay,
Lat. 76, Long. 66. Off Cape York.
With respect to the “ Felix,” she is everything I could desire ; she sails well,
is an excellent sea boat, and is as strong as wood and iron can make her. We
received all the apparatus for balloons, and what I place most faith in, we have
four well-trained carrier pigeons, which were presented to me by Miss Dunlope,
a young lady at Ayr, who had trained them to keep up a correspondence to
two friends at a distance; I hope they will be the bearers of good news. We
have seen no vessel on our passage but a Danish government vessel (the “ Titus
97 . M which
jv


which we overtook on the 15th of June, out 31 days from Copenhagen. She
was in company two days, but parted in a fog. We have had, as usual, a foul
wind in Davis Strait, but beat to windward half a degree of latitude per day,
which, considering we have the “ Mary ” in tow, was as much as we could
expect. We have seen a good deal of ice near Cape Farewell, but very little
since. lam in hopes we shall have a very favourable season.
We arrived at Holsteinberg on the 23d June (lat. 67°, long. 54°), my object
being to obtain an interpreter, in which I am happy to say we succeeded in the
person of a native (Adam Beck), who speaks the Danish language, and of course
is understood by me. He is also a good fiddler, and already a favourite with
the men. We were detained here by both calms and storms, which succeeded
each other for six days, which has no doubt kept us behind the others; so that
I cannot expect to fall in with them till we get to Opernowick, as they will
of course have left the Whale Fish Islands before we can possibly get there.
I sent a duplicate of the first sheet, with some additions, by the Danish packet,
which I am now glad I did, as a heavy gale, after leaving Holsteinberg on the
30th, prevented her reaching the cod fishermen, and we were so unfortunate as
to arrive at Whale Fish Islands two days after the transport had left, when my
hope of being able to send this and all other letters by her were at an end ; but
I still expect to fall in with the “ North Star.” The squadron under Captain
Austin are only 14 days, and the two American schooners only four days before
us, and we have no doubt of getting up with them at Opernowick. We got the
coals that had been left for us by the whaler, completed our water, and sailed in
20 hours. From the appearance of wind and weather, I was tempted to risk the
Waigat Straits, by which I could gain some leagues on the other vessels, and I
happily succeeded ; but I would not on any account run such a risk again, the
navigation being both dangerous and intricate, and I am sure Austin’s vessels
could not have accomplished it. We have since had light winds, and are (Bth
July) within 400 miles of Lancaster Sound, where I shall lay down my pen till
an opportunity offers. . All well,
23d July. I forgot to mention that neither Captain Austin nor the Americans
have obtained an interpreter, and I am therefore the less sorry that I took so
much time at Holsteinberg ; but I believe that Captain Penny got one at Oper-
nowick. We have now fallen in with the remaining whalers, which 1 knew from
the heavy state of the ice would fail in getting round to the west land till the
fishing season was over. (17 July, lat. 74 deg. 36 min. north, off Cape Shakleton).
In the morning we suddenly fell in with five of the whalers, who, seeing it im-
probable that they could get round the north end of the ice, were running to the
south, to try the passage to the west land, in lat. 71. They reported that in a
gale of the 12th the American vessel was beset off the Devil’s Thumb, where
they still remained, about 30 miles north of us, where we could see them ; but
that Captain Penny and Austin’s squadron were in lat. 74 deg. 40 min., and bore
up in the storm, and would probably reach Melville Bay, where we would find
them: that all of us would no doubt yet run the middle ice, but would probably
be late.
We found little field ice, which was very favourable for the steamers, but a
great many icebergs. I gave a short note to Captain Leuchar, of the “ True-
love,” but 1 suppose you will receive this first. The storm of the 12th was very
severe, and damaged the bulwarks of the “ Marybut that was of no conse-
quence, as we had to take them away; and have now constructed her into a row
galley as well as a sailing vessel. She will row 10 oars, and I think will do the
work better than any that has navigated the arctic seas. On the 19th July we
spoke five more whalers, all standing to the southward, and in the evening com-
municated with Captain Forsyth in the “ Prince Albert,” which followed us
closely, occasionally assisting each other through the intricate passages among
the ice, with which we were now constantly surrounded.
On the 23d July we communicated with seven more of the whalers, which
were running south, having given up as hopeless the idea of making the north
passage in time to reach the fishing ground on the west land this season. On the
25th July we discovered Her Majesty’s ships commanded by Captain Austin,
and also the two vessels commanded by Captain Penny, and were now in lat.
75 deg. 11 min. 10 sec. north, long. 59 deg. 38 min, west, off Browne’s Islands;
and having gained the land, we were in hopes of overtaking Her Majesty’s ships,
which were then beset. To accomplish this, we continued our labours in cutting,
forcing.

forcing, and breaking, and daily gaining on them; but Captain Penny gained
also, and at last got out of sight. It was not until Saturday evening the 11th
of August that we overtook them, and on Sunday Captain Austin came on board
the “ Felix,” as also Captain Ommaney and Lieutenant Cator. Our communi-
cation (as became officers of the Royal Navy) was unreserved. I gave Captain
Austin a written statement of my intentions and views consequent on the late
and unfavourable season; our co-operation was determined on, and I was in
return furnished with an official copy of his orders to those under his command;
and after discussion, in order that the whole field should be simultaneously ex-
plored, as the best mode of discovering the position of the missing ships, it was
agreed that the “ Resolute” and “ Pioneer,” beginning at Pond’s Bay, should
examine the whole south coast of Lancaster Sound, Barrow Straits, and, if pos-
sible, Cape Walker; that the “ Assistance” and “ Intrepid,” beginning at Cape
Warrender, should examine the north coast of Lancaster Sound and Barrow
Strait as far as Wellington Channel, which they were directed to enter, and if
possible communicate with Captain Penny, whose orders directed his attention
to Jones Sound; that the “ Felix” and “ Mary,” beginning at Cape Hotham,
were to examine that and the different headlands to Melville Islands, and, if
possible, to Banks Land. My plans of communicating with each other were
approved of, and Captain Forsyth, in the “ Prince Albert,” was to proceed to
Brentford Bay, and endeavour to cross the isthmus and survey the west side of
Boothia Felix.
We now proceeded in company ; and the weather being calm, and peculiarly
favourable for the steamers, the “ Felix” was occasionally towed by the “ Pioneer”
and “ Resolute,” while the “ Prince Albert ” was also towed by the “ Intrepid ”
and “Assistance.” In the meantime Captain Penny, who had in vain attempted
to cross the middle ice, was overtaken; and on the 13th of August the whole
nine vessels were congregated at Melville Bay, off Cape York, where I shall
conclude this despatch.

“ Felix” Discovery Yacht, off Admiralty Inlet,
Sir, Lancaster Sound, 22 August 1850.
I have to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of
the Admiralty, that the “ Felix” discovery yacht, with her tender the “ Mary,”
after obtaining an Esquimaux interpreter at Holsteinberg, and calling at Whale
Fish Islands, proceeded northward, through the Waigat Strait, and overtook Her
Majesty’s discovery ships under the command of Captain Austin on the 11th of
August; and on the 12th, the senior officer and the second in command having
cordially communicated with me on the best mode of performing the service on
which we are mutually embarked, that arrangements were made and concluded
for a simultaneous examination of every part of the eastern side of a north-west
passage in which it was probable the missing ships could be found ; documents to
that effect were exchanged, and subsequently assented to by Captains Forsyth and
Penny. On the 13th of August natives were discovered on the ice near to Cape
York, with whom it was deemed advisable to communicate. On this service Lieu-
tenant Cator, in the “ Intrepid,” was detached on the part of Captain Austin, and
my part Commander Phillips, with our Esquimaux interpreter, in the whale
boat of the “ Felix.” It was found by Lieutenant Cator that Captain Penny had
left with the natives a note for Captain Austin, but only relative to the state of
the navigation; however, when Commander Phillips arrived, the Esquimaux
seeing one apparently of their own nation in the whale boat came immediately to
him, when a long conversation took place, the purport of which could not be
made known, as the interpreter could not explain himself to any one either in
the “ Intrepid ” or the whale boat, as he understands only the Danish besides
his own language, until he was brought on board the “ Prince Albert,” where
John Smith, the captain’s steward of that vessel, who had been some years at the
Hudson’s Bay settlement of Churchill, and understood a little of the language,
97. m 2 was


was able to give some explanation of Adam Beck’s information; which I deemed
of such importance that Captains Ommaney, Phillips, and Forsyth proceeded in
the “ Intrepid ” to the “ Resolute,” when it was decided by Captain Austin to
send for the Danish interpreter of the “ Lady Franklin,” which, having been
unsuccessful in an attempt of getting through the ice to the westward, was only
a few miles distant. In the meantime it was known that in addition to the first
information, a ship (which could only be the “ North Star”) had wintered in
Wolstenholme Sound, called by the natives “ Ourinak,” and had only left it a
month ago. This proved to be true; but the interpretation of the Dane was totally
variance with the information given by the other, who, although for obvious
reasons he did not dare to contradict the Dane, subsequently maintained the
truth of his statement, which induced Captain Austin to detach the “ Intrepid,”
with Captains Ommaney and Phillips, taking with them both our interpreter
(Adam Beek) and a young native, who had been persuaded to come as one of the
crew of the “ Assistance,” and examine Wolstenholme Sound. In the mean-
time it had been unanimously decided that no alteration should be made in our
previous arrangement; it being obvious that while there remained a chance of
saving the lives of those of the missing ships who may be yet alive, a further
search for those who had perished should be postponed, and accordingly the
“ Resolute,” “ Pioneer,” and “ Prince Albert,” parted company on the 15th.
It is here unnecessary to give the official reports made to me by Commander
Phillips, which are of course transmitted by me to the secretary of the Hudson’s
Bay Company, who, with the information written in the Esquimaux language
by Adam Beek, will no doubt be sent to you for their Lordships’ information ;
and it will be manifest by these reports that Commander Phillips had performed
his duty with sagacity, circumspection, and address which does him infinite
credit, although it is only such as I must have expected from so intelligent an
officer. And I have much satisfaction in adding, that it has been mainly owing
to his zeal and activity that I was able, under disadvantageous circumstances, to
overtake Her Majesty’s ships; while, by his scientific acquirements and accu-
racy in surveying, he has been able to make many important corrections in, and
valuable additions to, the charts of the much frequented eastern course of Baffin’s
Bay, which has been more closely observed and navigated us than by any
former expedition, and much to my satisfaction ; confirming, in latitude and lon-
gitude, every headland I had an opportunity of laying down in the year 1818.
And under these circumstances I trust that I do not trespass too far on your
condescension, in earnestly requesting that you will be pleased to move their
Lordships that (as in the instance of my nephew, now Captain Sir James Ross)
the name of Commander Charles Gerrans Phillips may be placed on the books
■of one of Her Majesty’s ships, in order that the well-deserved promotion of this
excellent officer, who, besides many other claims, is now serving on half pay,
may not be retarded: especially, that if the information I receive at or before
I reach Winter Harbour is such as I have reason to expect, it may be my duty
to proceed to Banks Land; and if no tidings of the missing ships are obtained,
it will undoubtedly be my duty to make further inquiry into the truth of my
interpreter’s statement, and in either case to prolong my absence from Great
Britain.
I have only to add, that I have much satisfaction in co-operating with Her
Majesty’s expedition. With such support, and with vessels so peculiarly adapted
for the service, no exertion shall be wanting on my part; but I cannot conclude
this letter without acknowledging my obligations to Commodore Austin and
Captain Ommaney for the assistance they have afforded me, and for the cordiality
and courtesy with" which I have been treated by those distinguished officers, and
others of the ships under their orders. Animated as we all are with an ardent
and sincere desire to rescue our imperilled countrymen, I confidently trust that
our united exertions and humble endeavours may, under a merciful Providence,
be completely successful.
I am, &c.

“ Felix” Discovery Vessel, off Cape Dudley Diggs,
Sir, 14 August 1850,
In obedience to your directions to communicate with the natives seen on the
ice close to Cape York yesterday forenoon, I proceeded in the whale boat,
.accompanied by the Esquimaux “ Adam,” your interpreter; and on nearing the
ice observed three natives (males) in communication with the people of Her
Majesty’s ship “ Intrepid” and boat’s crew of the “ Prince Albert,” both fast
to the ice.
As soon as the Esquimaux observed one of their own race in our boat they ran
to meet us, throwing up their hands and expressing signs of satisfaction. They
.also got into our boat without hesitation.
Our interpreter appeared to understand and be understood by them, and a
long and earnest conversation took place, in which the gold-laced caps of some
of the officers were alluded to.
But no European present being able to understand our interpreter, we quitted
■the ice after about half an hour’s stay; Captain Ommaney, who was on board
the “ Intrepid,” having seen a memorandum left by Mr. Penny r a day previously
with the persons we had communicated with, and which was merely a memorial
■of his visit. I was now anxious to rejoin you as the only person in the “ Felix”
who could understand whatever intelligence the interpreter had picked up, and
we accordingly proceeded in tow of the “ Intrepid” to rejoin the “ Resolute”
and “ Felix,” now far ahead and pushing on for Cape Dudley Diggs.
During the afternoon “ Adam” showed to our boat’s crew some signs of a wish
to impart something, and about 8 p. m. I dropped on board the “ Prince Albert,”
also in tow of the “ Intrepid,” and he immediately sought out the steward of
Captain Forsyth, who seems to possess a good knowledge of the language of
these regions, and through him we received the following communication :
That in the winter of 1846, when snow was falling, two ships were broken up
by the ice a good way off, in the direction of Cape Dudley Diggs, and afterwards
burnt by a fierce and numerous tribe of natives. He asserted that the ships were
not whalers, and that epaulettes were worn by some of the white men; that a
part of the crews were drowned; that the remainder were some time in huts or
tents apart from the natives; that they had guns but no balls, were in a weak
and exhausted condition, and were subsequently killed by the natives with darts
■or arrows.
No time was lost in imparting this intelligence to the “ Assistance,” and Cap-
tain Ommaney and myself, with Commander Forsyth, instantly proceeded in
the “ Intrepid” to communicate these particulars to yourself and to Captain
Austin,

“ Felix” Discovery Vessel, off Wolstenholme Island,
Sir, 16 August 1850.
In compliance with your directions that I should accompany Captain Omma-
ney, of Her Majesty’s ship “ Assistance,” and make further inquiry into the
truth of the reports referred to in my letter of the 14th instant, as well as to
those about a ship having passed the last winter in Wolstenholme Sound; I
have to state that about 9 a. m. yesterday I accompanied Captain Ommaney and
some of his officers on board Her Majesty’s ship “ Intrepid,” having with us the
Esquimaux interpreter of this vessel, and one belonging to the “ Assistance,”
who had given the original information to ours.
We proceeded in the steamer 16 miles up Wolstenholme Sound in a N. E.
direction, until we had shoaled the water to two fathoms L. W. Here three
-cairns were discovered and examined; within each of them we found a paper
signed by Mr. Saunders, the commander of Her Majesty’s ship “ North Star.”

No. 9.
Proceedings of
Captain Sir John
Ross, c. B.
The latest in date (3d July 1850) was close to the graves of four seamen, and
its contents were to the following effect:
That the cairn was erected by the crew of Her Majesty’s ship “ North Star”
to mark the burial places of William Sharp, A. 8., of Her Majesty’s ship
“North Star,” deceased Ist November 1849; William Brisley, boat’s mate,
deceased 30th January 1850; Richard Baker, A. 8., deceased 2d April 1850;
John Deverill, A. 8., deceased 17th May 1850.
It further stated that the “ North Star” was beset on the east side of Mel-
ville Bay, 29th July 1849, and gradually drifted day by day until 26th Sep-
tember, when they found themselves abreast of Wolstenholme Sound; and the
ice becoming slack, and the sound being perfectly clear, all plain sail was made,
and the ship pressed through, anchoring in the lower part of the sound the same
evening, and secured for the winter on the Ist October.
It further stated that she had remained there all the winter, and was to pro-
ceed in search of the Arctic ships as soon as the ice broke up.
This document was dated in North Star Bay, lat. 76 deg. 34 min. N.; long.
69 deg. 30 min. W., 3d July 1850, and signed J. Saunders.
The papers found in the other two cairns were dated 3d April 1850, and to
the same effect, except that they did not contain the names of the deceased
seamen.
A considerable space of the adjoining country was traversed in extended order,
and carefully examined by Captain Ommaney and myself, and a party of the
officers and men of Her Majesty’s ships “ Assistance” and “ Intrepid.”
Several Esquimaux huts were searched, but no living natives seen; two of
the huts covered the unburied remains of three or four natives.
A couple of shirts (one marked Corporal J. Cullamore), other fragments of
slop clothing, of broken bottles and crockery, iron hoops and nails, painted
wood, a: washing tub, and the footsteps of Europeans, as well as several pre-
served-meat tins, amply denoted the recent presence of a Queen’s ship in the
neighbourhood.
Although your Esquimaux interpreter still adheres to the statement he re-
ceived at Cape York relative to the loss of two ships in 1846, and the murder of
their crews, we were unable to discover any circumstance in corroboration ; and
from the silence of Mr. Saunders on the subject, and his expressed deter-
mination to prosecute his voyage in quest of the Arctic ships, 1 am induced to
hope such a lamentable occurrence has not taken place.
I should, however, recommend that the statement of the Esquimaux received
on board the “ Assistance” at Cape York, should be taken down in writing by
our interpreter, who is, as you know, fully competent to the task.

Report of Proceedings.
Her Majesty’s Ship ‘‘Resolute,”
at the Whale Fish Islands, 1 p. m.,
Sir, 23 June 1850.
1. I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords Com-
missioners of the Admiralty, of the arrival at these islands of the vessels of the
Arctic Expedition under my orders, they having left the Orkneys (as reported
in my letter of that day’s date) on the 15th ultimo.
2. Cape Farewell was sighted at noon on the 28th ultimo, bearing N. 25° W.,
distant 63 miles, and in the afternoon of the 30th, in latitude 59° N., longitude
47” W., the transport “ Emma Eugenia ” was fallen in with, and continued in
company.
3. On the morning of the 10th instant, the wind having fallen to a calm, with
every appearance of its continuing, the Whale Fish Islands being 280 miles dis-
tant, I deemed it advisable to cause the “ Resolute ” to be taken in tow by the
“ Pioneer,” and the transport by the “ Intrepid,” leaving the “ Assistance ” to-
make the best of her way. The four vessels arrived here just before noon on the
14th instant, and early on the morning of the 15th the “ Intrepid ” was
despatched to attend the “ Assistance,” which ship she met on the offing, and
returned with her in tow about noon.
4. Since the arrival of the vessels, every exertion has been used to clear the
transport, which would have been earlier accomplished but from the actual
necessity of placing ballast on board for her safety, as the last of the coals came
out.
5. Each ship is now complete between her and her tender, in provisions,.
stores, and warm clothing, to fully three years, and the tenders have on board
coals to the amount of 310 tons each.
6. Although the ships are somewhat crowded, yet they are at a comparatively
light draught, the mean being, of the “Resolute” 14 feet 6 inches, and
“Assistance” 16 feet inches, leaving them fully equal to a considerable
increase of weight, when recollecting the statements connected with their immer-
sion as merchant vessels with cargo on board.
7. The tenders may be said to be deep, the mean draught being, of the
“ Pioneer” 12 feet 11J inches, and “ Intrepid,” 13 feet 1 inch. They leave this
fully efficient in their engines and boilers. Some slight repairs and, adjustments
have been made here.
8. I have to observe with reference to the performance of these vessels, that
except in light winds “by the wind,” and strong breezes “ running,” they have
been able fairly to keep company ; the “ Pioneer ” having shown a superiority.
9. In the operation of towing under the then existing circumstances of medium
draught of water, in a calm, with the sea perfectly smooth, their speed may be-
considered as approaching four knots ; and against a moderate royal breeze, with,
a more than proportionate head swell, about two knots.
10. The sailing of the two ships has been, under their late trim, nearly equal;
the “ Resolute ” having had a little advantage in “ running,” and the “ Assist-
ance,” “by the wind.”
11. In the passage up from Cape Farewell, the straits were found to be
tolerably clear, the extreme of the stream of “land ice” having been met with
about the latitude of that place, on the 30th ultimo, and that of the stream from
the “pack” in latitude 66 deg. N., longitude 56 deg. W., on the 11th instant.
Bergs were not very numerous until this date, from which up to the time of our
arrival, they were found in considerable numbers.
12. Being unable to obtain at this place any information as to the state of the
ice further to the northward, Captain Ommaney visited the Danish settlement at
Lievely, Isle of Disco, and states “the season is considered fairly open; no records
have


have been found, or information obtained of the missing vessels ; the expedition
under the charge of Mr. Penny communicated with that place on the 2d ultimo,
all well; ” and that great civility and attention was shown to him by the autho-
rity there, who promised that any records met with or information procured,
should be preserved and forwarded.
13. It is my present intention in proceeding to the northward to communicate
with Opernowick, for the purpose of obtaining any information that may be there,
as well as a supply of Esquimaux boots, very desirable for travelling parties.
14. I regret to say that of the six bullocks brought from England by the
transport, five died during the passage.
15. The vessels composing the expedition may be considered in every way
efficient; and it is with much pleasure and satisfaction I report, that excellent
health and spirits, good will, and unanimity prevail throughout.
16. We proceed onwards at 2 p. m. this day.

expedition under my orders left the Whale Fish Islands at 2 p. m. on that day,
the ships being towed out by their tenders.

3. In the run up along the coast, the water as far as could be seen was clear
of pack ice, but bergs were very numerous.

REPORT OF ROCEEDINGS.
Her Majesty’s Ship “ Resolute,” at Sea
(Lat. 74 deg. 6 min. N.; Long. 58 deg. 30 min. W.),
Sir, 5 July 1850; 5 P. M.
1. In continuation of my report dated the 25th ultimo, off Opernowick (a
duplicate of which is transmitted herewith), I have the honour to acquaint you,
for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that Captain
Ommaney having returned in the “ Intrepid,” we proceeded to the northward at
7. 30. p. m. that evening.
2. At 11 p. m. the pack was made, extending apparently to the land, which, on
standing in shore to examine it, proved to be the case.

3. The vessels were then kept under weigh, off and on, to windward of its edge,
looking for a lead, but little, if any, alteration taking place, and the weather
becoming foggy, with every appearance of a change, they were, on the evening
of the 27th, made fast to bergs, a little to the northward of the Frow Islands
(lat. 73 deg. 0 min. N.; long. 56 deg. 25 min. W.).
4. Several whalers were seen fast in shore; and, by boat communication from
them, it was found that there were about 13 within a few miles of this position.
5. Colours were exchanged with Mr. Penny’s expedition on the 26th ultimo,
which, with the other vessels, was detained for an opening to get to the north-
ward.
6. The ice having slackened, and some lanes of water appearing in shore, at
9 a. m. on the Ist instant the ships proceeded in tow of their tenders (at the most
economical speed), along the land, through numerous winding lanes, and between
a considerable number of bergs, till reaching a little to the southward of Cape
Shackleton, where a stream of ice extending from the land arrested our progress,
and the vessels were again made fast to bergs.
7. The stream opened about midnight, and at 4 a. m. of the 2d, the vessels
again proceeded in tow, passing Mr. Penny’s expedition at 5 a. m., who, by
incessant labour of towing* and the occasional use of his sails, had been enabled
to reach thus far. Cape Shackleton was passed, and two deep bays crossed, in
which the land ice appeared then undisturbed; but by many turnings, and much
watchfulness, the vessels reached to the islands of Baffin, where all leads ap-
peared to terminate; and after careful search for one without success, the vessels
were moored to bergs, close under one of the islands.
8. At noon of the 3d some little promise of an in-shore channel appearing, the
ships proceeded in tow as before, until 4.30. p. m., when they were again brought
up by the ice; an attempt was then made to work, and cut the “ Pioneer ”
through; but the ice closing as fast as it was cleared away, and a thick fog
coming on, her screw was raised, rudder unshipped, and the vessels secured to
the land ice, to await the clearing off of the fog, so as to ensure a right lead
being taken the moment one presented itself.
9. About 1 p.m. of the 3d, the “Lady Franklin” and “Sophia” were lost
sight of, standing in a lane of water to the westward.
10. At 10. 50. a. m. of the 4th, the fog cleared off, and the ice having slack-
ened, the ships, after some little cutting and heaving, were enabled to proceed
again in tow at 1. 20. p. m., through numerous narrow lanes of water. By 4, 30.
the land ice was cleared, and the vessels reached to a large space of open water.
Ten whalers were here in sight astern, advancing in the same direction as our-
selves.
11. We thus proceeded, steering N.W. by W. (in which point most open
water appeared), until 10. 30., when the pack became visible ahead, extending
from the land seaward, as far on the horizon as the eye could reach; and at
11. 30. having closed it, carefully reconnoitred, and found that there was no
opening that gave the least hope of our advancing; the ships were cast off, the
steam let down, and all brought to the wind.
12. So far as an opinion can at present be given of the season, I would
observe, that it cannot be considered more than an average one; and that in the
last communication with the whalers, they were apprehensive of their not being
able to reach their fishing ground in time for success.
13. Some of these vessels have come up, and there are now 10 in company.
I avail myself of this occasion of detention to communicate with them, and
report my proceedings to this date, for their Lordships’ information.
14. It affords me much pleasure to state, that the performance of the tenders
has been very satisfactory; they have now remaining on board coals equal to fqll
30 days’ steaming,
15. It will also be gratifying to their Lordships to know, that good health
sind high spirits continue to prevail throughout the expedition.
16. We are now standing off and on the pack edge, in readiness to take im-
mediate advantage of the first favourable opening.
I have, &c.

(Lat. 74 deg. 35 min, N.; Long. 58 deg. 47 min., W.),
Sir, 8 p.m., 7 July 1850.
1. With reference to my letter of the sth instant (a duplicate of which
is transmitted herewith), I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information
of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that in the evening of that day a
lead having shown itself upon a change of wind, the ships again proceeded in
tow to take advantage of it, reaching this at 7. 30. a. m. of yesterday, where the
lead terminated by the outer “ floes ” being close up to the land ice.
2. The wind is at present southerly; but there is reason to hope, that so soon
as it changes, water will make, and enable us to proceed.
3. There are now in our neighbourhood, fast to the floe, the expedition under
the charge of Mr, Penny, and 13 whalers.
4. As the occasions of advancing are so sudden and uncertain, I avail myself
of this opportunity to report my latest proceedings for their Lordships’ infor-
mation.

COPY of a GENERAL MEMOR ANDUM addressed by Capt. Horatio T. Austin, C.B.,
of Her Majesty’s Ship “Resolute,” to the respective Officers commanding
Vessels in the Expedition under his Orders.
The following Memorandum was brought home by Commander Forsyth, of
the “ Prince Albert ” Discovery Ship.
Her Majesty’Ship “ Resolute,” at Sea
(Lat. 76 deg. 25 min. N.; Long. 61 deg. 34 min. W.),
25 July 1850.
In the hope that the expedition is now not far distant from the “North
"Water,” and although the nature and movements of the ice are so varied in
different seasons as to prevent any determination of plan until the moment for
acting arrives, it becomes desirable that what is contemplated in the prosecution
of the charge assigned to me (the accomplishment of which we all have so much
at heart), should be made known.
I therefore here promulgate it, and it is to be received as an addenda to the
instructions issued by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and carried
out with all the earnestness and zeal that so highly an important service
demands.
The circumstance of a tender being attached to each ship, establishes in
a great measure the security and confidence necessary in the prosecution of this
service (which would not be felt by one vessel alone), and admits of a partial
separation for the season, to enable a more extended search being made.
When maturely considering the most probable route of the missing expedition
in its return by way of Lancaster Sound, or of any of the crews that might have
left their vessels, it appears that they would have attempted to reach Pond’s
Bay either during the late autumn of last year, or the earliest moment this
spring, with the hope of meeting the whalers in the present season.
Therefore the “ Resolute” and her tender will proceed to Pond’s Bay, and,
97 • n 2 if

if it can be done, communicate with the natives there; then, as circumstances
admit, search along that shore on her way to Whaler Point.
The “ Assistance ” and her tender will commence the search at Cape War-
render, continuing it along the north shore to Wellington Strait, examine its
shores and neighbourhood, and proceed as far up it as is practicable, and
sufficient to fully satisfy that it has or has not been the course of the missing
ships. As Mr. Penny, in his success, will traverse the northern part of this
strait, there is good reason to hope that so very important a doubt will be set at
rest.
Should any record be found of Sir John Franklin having proceeded in that
direction, then it is to be made known to the “ Resolute,” by depositing a notice
thereof at either Cape Riley or Cape Hotham, and the search proceeded with
most vigorously, in which the “ Resolute” will hasten to join at the earliest
moment.
But in the event of no record being found there, and it is most desirable and
important that the ships should meet, or at least communicate results of labours
to this point, then the rendezvous to be between Capes Rennell, Hotham, and
Riley, the “ Resolute” standing to the northward from midnight to noon, and
to the southward from noon to midnight, in the meridian of Cape Hotham.
But should the examination of Wellington Strait be speedily accomplished,
without traces being found, and the “ Resolute ” not having reached the
rendezvous, then, in order to save time, the “ Assistance ” will take up the
search to Cape Walker, examining its neighbourhood thoroughly as far as
is practicable; and failing to obtain any information there, or to meet the
“ Resolute,” will then continue it on the north shore of the Parry Islands,
And with a view to have a fixed place where there is good reason to expect
that vessels may reach, should the rendezvous on account of time fail for com-
munication, then a full account of proceedings, with any change of plans called
for from circumstances not anticipated here, must be deposited at the southern
extremity of Griffith’s Island.
In the event of the “ Resolute” first reaching the rendezvous between Capes
Rennell, Hotham, and Riley, then all endeavour will be made to prosecute to
the entrance of Wellington Strait, touching at Cape Riley, and Cape Hotham,
in order, according to circumstances; and failing to meet there with information
of “ Assistance,” or traces of the missing expedition, will then proceed towards
Capes Rennell and Walker ; and not finding traces in that direction, will con-
tinue the search in the south-west, towards Melville Island, where it would
be expected to take up winter quarters; but if, on the contrary, traces are found,
then the object of reaching Melville Island would be abandoned, and winter
quarters taken in the south-west, according to circumstances.
Should “Assistance,” on reaching Cape Hotham, discover that “Resolute”
had preceded her, and gone on without finding any traces, she will make the
best of her way in the direction of Cape Walker; and failing to meet with
“ Resolute ” in that neighbourhood, or any record, will without delay carry on
the search along the north shore of the Parry Islands.
The “ Resolute ” failing to reach Melville Island to winter, will endeavour
to communicate in early spring with Winter Harbour; and should assistance
similarly fail, she must do the same, independently of other searching parties
that may be dispatched, as it is most important that the results of the several
examinations, made up to this period, should be communicated.
On every occasion of visiting the shore, a record must be deposited, comprising
every necessary particular, taking as a guide my minute of the 3d instant, and
being careful to note that a considerable supply of provisions and fuel is depo-
sited at Whaler Point, on the western entrance of Prince Regent’s Inlet.
With a view to attract the attention of any of the missing persons, care must
be taken that during the periods of darkness, and when fogs prevail, periodical
signals are made, rockets, blue lights, guns, muskets, maroons, drums, gongs,
bells, and whistles being employed as most suitable, according to circum-
stances.
When in open water, a document is to be occasionally thrown overboard con-
taining the necessary particulars, as detailed in the printed papers supplied.
The


The substance and spirit of their Lordships’ orders, under which I am acting,
must be the guide for any point not herein provided for, or whenever doubt
arises, as they will govern all the operations of the “ Resolute.”

COPY of a DESPATCH from Captain Erasmus Ommaney, of Her Majesty’s
Ship “Assistance,” to the Secretary of the Admiralty.
Her Majesty’s Ship “ Assistance,” off Lancaster Sound,
in Lat. 75 deg. 46 min. N., Long. 75 deg. 49 min. W.,
Sir, 17 August 1850.
1. I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information of the Lords Com-
missioners of the Admiralty, that Her Majesty’s ship “ Assistance ” and her
tender, Her Majesty’s steam-vessel “ Intrepid,” have this day succeeded in effect-
ing a passage across to the west water, and are now proceeding to Lancaster
Sound, officers and crews all well, with fine clear weather, and open water as
far as can be seen.
2. Agreeably with instructions received from Captain H. Austin, we parted
company on the 15th, at la.m., off Cape Dudley Diggs, as the ice was then
sufficiently open to anticipate no further obstruction in effecting the north passage.
He was anxious to proceed to Pond’s Bay, and from thence take up the examina-
tion along the south shores of Lancaster Sound, leaving me to ascertain the truth
of a report obtained from Esquimaux at Cape York respecting some ship or ships
having been seen near Wolstenholme Island, after which to proceed to the north
shores of Lancaster Sound and Wellington Channel.
On passing Cape York the 14th instant natives were seen. By the directions
of Captain Austin, I landed and communicated with them, when we were in-
formed that they had seen a ship in that neighbourhood in the spring, and that
she was housed in. Upon this intelligence, I shipped one of the natives, who
volunteered to join us as interpreter and guide.
4. On parting with Captain Austin, we proceeded towards Wolstenholme
Island, where I left the ship, and proceeded in Her Majesty’s steam-vessel
Si Intrepid ” into Wolstenholme Sound, and by the guidance of the Esquimaux
succeeded in finding a bay about 15 miles further in, and sheltered by a promi-
nent headland. In three cairns erected here we found a document stating that
the “ North Star” had wintered in the bay, a copy of which I have the honour
4o transmit their Lordships.
5. Previous to reaching the spot where the “ North Star” wintered, I exam-
ined the deserted Exquimaux settlement. At this spot we found evident traces
of some ship having been in the neighbourhood, from empty preserved-raeat
canisters, and some clothes left near a pool of water marked with the name of
a corporal belonging to the “ North Star.”
6. Having ascertained this satisfactory information, I returned to Wolsten-
holme Island, where a document was deposited recording our proceedings. At
6 a.m. of the 16th instant I rejoined the ship and proceeded in tow to the west-
ward, and am happy to inform you that the passage across has been made without
obstruction, towing through loose and straggling ice.
7. The expedition was beset in Melville Bay, surrounded by heavy and exten-
sive floes of ice, from the 11th July to the 9th August 1850, when, after great
exertion, a release was effected, and we succeeded in reaching Cape York, by con-
tinuing along the edge of the land ice, after which we have been favoured with
plenty of water.
8. Captain Penny’s expedition was in company during the most part of the
time, while in Melville Bay, and up to the 14th instant, when we left him off
Cape Dudley Diggs, “ All well.”

their destination ; the latter proceeded with him, and the former has remained
with us.
10, Having placed Sir John Ross in the fair way of reaching Lancaster Sound,
with a fair wind and open water, his vessel has been cast off in this position; I
shall therefore proceed with all despatch to the examination of the north shores
of Lancaster Sound and Wellington Channel, according to Captain Austin’s
directions.

This paper is placed here to certify that Her Majesty’s ship “North Star”
was beset at the east side of Melville Bay, on the 29th July last year, and gradu-
ally drifted from day to day, until, on the 26th September, we found ourselves
abreast of Wolstenholme Island, when, perceiving the ice a little more loose,
and the sound perfectly clear, we made all plain sail and pressed her through it,
anchoring in the lower part of the sound that evening, and arrived in this bay
on the Ist October, where she remained throughout the winter. It is my inten-
tion to leave as soon as the breaking up of the ice will permit, and prosecute my
voyage in search of the Arctic ships.

COPY of a LETTER from Rear-Admiral Tayler, C.B. to Captain Hamilton,
R.N., Secretary of the Admiralty, proposing a combined Land and Water
Expedition to examine all the Fiords in Barrow Straits and Banks Land.
Xetter from Rear-
Admiral Taykr,
Hamilton, Ln.
14, Great George-street, Westminster,
Sir, 4 January 1851.
As everything connected with the Arctic regions and the Esquimaux must be
interesting, however trifling, as links to connect the chain of information already
obtained relative to Sir John Franklin and his brave crew, I send you, for the in-
formation of my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, a few remarks made in
North Greenland by my son, who sailed from Copenhagen the Bth May 1850,
in the schooner “ Fortuna,” to examine the mineral productions of Greenland,
where they arrived the 12th June.
He returned to London the 27th October, with the Danish Governor of Green-
land, Captain Holbolt, r. d. n. The first place my son visited was Skinder-
walden, where the schooner was detained three weeks, by contrary wind, in a
small harbour called Dutchman’s Harbour; from thence they proceeded to
Omenak, in latitude 70 deg. 40 min. N. OIF this fiord Captain Ross’s squadron
was


was seen, after leaving Holstenburg, by the Danish schooner the “ Lucinde.”
The Island of Omenak, upon which is the Danish settlement, is about 50 miles
up the fiord of Omenak, and whilst the “ Fortuna ” was lying at anchor, about a
cable’s length from the rocks, in 65 fathoms water, a gale sprung up, and in the
course of 12 hours numerous large icebergs drifted towards the schooner, which
would have crushed her had they not grounded ahead of her; had they been
smaller ones, and not grounded, the schooner could not have escaped being
driven against the rocks; but when the wind shifted the icebergs drifted out of
the little bay in which she was anchored. When they left the harbour at Skin-
derwalden, the schooner was towed out by a large seal-skin boat, rowed by 12
women, double banked, and steered by a man with a paddle ; these boats will
pull eight or ten miles per hour, and perform a voyage of 40 or 50 miles per day.
They can carry sail off the wind, but the boats are too light to sail on a wind, as
they only draw about three or four inches, with 12 women and two men. The
size of these boats is about 24 feet length, four feet breadth, and from two feet
and half to three feet depth; the Esquimaux call them “ umiak.” They have
also the “kaiak,” a boat for one man, in which he can paddle at the rate of 10
miles per hour, and perform with ease a distance of 60 miles per day, continuing
it for a week if necessary.
The Esquimaux of Greenland are very peaceable; they have no implements of
war, and never fight. My son has frequently travelled miles along the coast
with several Esquimaux, and does not believe they would be guilty of any
treachery. It is the opinion that Adam Beck’s tale is a fabrication, to enable
him to return home, as he would not like to reside in a vessel deprived of his
accustomed food. The Esquimaux are very averse to performing work different
from their usual occupation; they could not be prevailed upon to carry black
lead two miles to the beach, although provided with seal flesh, and well fed and
paid ; but they would not hesitate going in their boats 100 miles with messages,
or letters, &c.
That the Esquimaux is capable of inventing a plausible tale to suit his own
purposes they had many proofs of. On one occasion they made an extempore
song, on a fat and lean Danish sailor; and Adam Beck, having seen the Danish
Governor and the officers of our ships with epaulettes, would not have been at a
loss to concoct his ingenious tale.
Had the crews of the “ Erebus ” and “ Terror ” landed without ammunition,
as he states, and found no means of subsistence, they would in all probability
(as they had provisions) have proceeded in their boats up one of the numerous
fiords abounding along the coast, in search of seal and fish, leaving marks which
would not have been disturbed by the natives. That boats did land is certain,
and a sudden gale or ice drifting in, might have caused them to leave with such
precipitation as not to observe the two shirts and nails, which were therefore left
behind ; the piece of hawser, about 14 inches long, might have been cut to make
fenders for the boats or oakum ; these things might have been concealed by snow
from the Esquimaux, if any of them had visited the tents, and when uncovered
by the sun, were first seen by our people. Stone boundaries for tents may be
seen in many places along the coast of Greenland, some of them appearing 20
or 30 years old; these places are the summer residences of the Esquimaux, and
they generally build a small one close by for the purpose of cooking; it is possible
our people may have found these stones ready placed, and pitched their tents
upon the spot; but my son states, that any one acquainted with such construc-
tions could tell at sight if the stones were built up by the natives or Europeans
unaccustomed to it. Our boats may have landed for many purposes; repairs,
fresh water, or washing clothes, but that the natives destroyed them there is not
the least foundation for the belief; if the men landed with muskets, provisions,
tents, &c., why not with ammunition, which is always ready in the arm-chest?
The tents of the Esquimaux are about 12 feet diameter, and several are frequently
pitched together.
From the information I have received from my son, and his remarks in his
diary, which is very interesting, as to the habits of the Esquimax, the nature of
the country, its resources in food, and mineral productions, and his description of
the deep fiords running into the country, 200 miles in some places, I do not
think it likely that the ships sent out will discover any traces of Sir John Franklin
and his crew.

blinks which form the icebergs, the ships from them would, in coming in contact
with a wreck, completely demolish it, but if any of the timbers had been
drifted on shore, it would still remain, as trees are frequently found on shore in
Greenland, which have perhaps drifted from America.
On one occasion a whaler was destroyed off Spitsbergen ; the men took to the
boats, one of which became fixed in the ice, and drifted with it from thence
southward round Cape Farewell and up Davis’ Straits to about 65 deg. north
latitude, where the survivors were rescued; this is a proof of the set of the current
from the north at Spitzbergen and east side of Greenland, and from the south up
Davis’ Straits and the west coat of Greenland, and round the head of Baffin’s
Bay. An Esquimaux in his kaiak was once driven over from Greenland across
Davis’ Straits to Cumberland Island, and, it is said, still lives there, the language
being a dialect of the Esquimaux. The Greenlanders are very expert in throw-
ing the harpoon with a throwing-stick, and frequently, when paddling in their
kaiak, will bring down birds flying with their one-barb harpoon, which, besides
the lance for killing seals, is the only weapon they use, bows and arrows being
unknown to them. The seals are mostly found in the fiords, and to kill them
must be approached with great caution; some of the Greenlanders place a piece
of white calico in the nose of their boats, to represent a piece of ice. If the seal
should dive within distance, he throws his harpoon under water, and seldom
misses his aim, when, if the seal is large, he tows it to land; should the boat be
upset, many of them have the power of recovering themselves with one stroke
of the paddle; but, if he does not succeed the first time, he is lost, and then if
he can disengage himself from his kaiak he lashes himself to it, that his body
may drift on shore, having a great horror of being devoured by fish. They inter
the bodies of their dead by sewing them up in sealskins, doubled up with
their knees upon their breasts; they then lay the body upon a sheltered rock
and pile stones over it. In one of these tombs, one of my son’s party found an
old cask, and a fish-hook and lance-head, both made of native copper; the hook
was formed of a semicircle of copper, passed through a little shank of bone, and
bound firmly to it by fibres of whalebone; it is supposed these things were at least
200 years old, for the body was completely decayed, and the Danes have had pos-
session and supplied the Esquimaux with steel hooks, &c., since that time.
I do not think if the “ Erebus ” and “ Terror ” were wrecked upon the coast
in Barrow Straits that the crews would travel into the interior, for it appears my
son observed nothing but ice and snow stretching inland, from a mountain he
ascended about 3,000 feet high; in fact the whole of the interior of Greenland
is one vast glacier. In the summer the sea coast is free from snow and ice for
a few miles inland, and where the fiords run into the land there is of course more
of it uncovered, but the glacier can generally be seen from any of the higher
mountains along the coast: these lofty mountains form a complete chain all
along the coast from north to south. It is therefore probable that they would
proceed in their boats up one of the deep fiords, which running so many miles
into the country abound with seals, &c,, and offers a more sheltered retreat. In
one of these fiords, in Banks Land or Melville Land opposite, the icebergs might
close them up for years, as icebergs that have been driven into the fiords have
remained many years without melting.
Supposing the vessels could not find a passage past Banks Land, they pro-
bably pushed into one of these fiords to lay up for the winter, and became closed
in by icebergs, which in 12 hours frequently drive in and surround a vessel;
smaller pieces of ice would so fill in the spaces between as to preclude escape for
several years. So situated, the vessels might be secure; and as they could pro-
vide fish and reindeer during the summer, there is no reason to believe they
would perish from want of food, for they could, like the Esquimaux, provide
sufficient in the summer to last the winter; and if we take into consideration
the quantity of provisions on board the vessels, there is every hope of their
existence, to prompt to further and effectual search. If the vessels reached the
head of Barrow Straits, it is most likely that a passage would be sought on the
side of Banks Land, being a more direct line for Behring Straits; and if one of
the large fiords presented itself, no doubt the vessels would push up it, as their
large and favourable appearance would encourage the idea of a passage; but
when once entered, icebergs may prevent their coming out for years. It would
require two summers to search the Greenland coast inside Barrow Straits and
Banks Land ; and as the ships sent into Barrow Straits could not visit all these
numerous


numerous fiords, which would require the assistance of natives and their light
boats, and as no tidings can possibly reach England from the vessels sent out in
search until it may be perhaps too late to undertake an effectual land expedi- •
tion, and as Sir J. Ross might also be closed up, I would propose for the con- |
sideration of my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the following plan as a
last resource, and which I have every reason to believe would prove successful
in discovering their fate, and rescuing them if still in existence.
My son, from his knowledge of the country and the habits of the Esquimaux,
and being acquainted with two respectable and steady young men, natives of
Greenland, but of Danish parents, speaking correctly both the Danish and
Esquimaux languages, and several confidential older men also acquainted with
both languages, one of them speaking English, would, with the aid of some or
all of these men, four Esquimaux, and some of our own people, undertake to
conduct a land and water expedition combined, to examine all the fiords in
Barrow Straits, from longitude about 80 deg. to 110 deg., and if no tidings were
discovered, would examine Banks Land and all its fiords the following summer.
They would be provided with Esquimaux dogs and sledges, the Esquimaux
would have their seal-skin boats, and there would be required a schooner and
launch fitted as a steam-boat, to burn oil, and supplied with every requisite to
accompany the land expedition along the coast and transport-them across the
creeks, &c.; they would also have portable boats for passing any water the launch
could not reach ; by this means all the coast and inlets would be examined,
making signals, &c. at the bottom of every fiord.
Judging from his enterprise, health and bodily strength, and general know-
ledge, lam confident he would accomplish what he undertook to perform. He
has frequently travelled with Esquimaux 20 miles per day along the coast in
search of minerals, many specimens of which he brought to England, and pre-
sented some to the British Museum, and by request of Mr. Gray, secretary
f.r.s., communicated with Dr. Barclay of the Hudson Bay Company. Whilst
in Greenland he made an interesting geological discovery, an account of which
he is about sending to the Royal Society.
An undertaking of the above description offers every chance of determining
the fate of our brave countrymen, and would crown the laudable endeavours of
the Admiralty with general approbation.

With regard to myself and the proposition I have made, I must observe that
it has only been done because the plan I submit comes from myself, and conse-

I am sure I have no desire to put myself prominently forward when there are so

Enclosure to No. 12.
In again turning my attention to the subject of the Franklin Expedition, and
carefully perusing the various letters and documents lately added to those pre-
viously gathered, I have been forcibly struck with one circumstance in connexion,
with the ships now employedon the search, and which, may at all events be worth
mentioning;
It is to be found in the following: in attentively reading over Captain Austin’s
official instructions to Captain. Ommaney, Lieutenant-Commanders Osborn and
Cator, I find in the sixth paragraph these words-:
“ The ‘ Assistance ’ and. her tender will, commence the search at. Cape War-
render, continuing it along the north shore to Wellington Strait, examine its
shores and neighbourhood, and proceed as far up it as is practicable and. suffi-
cient to fully satisfy, that it has; or has. not; been the course of the missing
ships.!’
Here, then, is a positive order for Captain Ommaney, before going elsewhere,
to fully satisfy himself that Wellington Strait “ has or has not been the course of
the missing ships.”
In Captain Ommaney’s own words we find that upon searching Cape Riley
he immediately determines to visit Cape Hotham and Cape Walker, instead of
proceeding “ as far up Wellington Strait as is practicable; ” therefore there
appears to me a strong inference that that gallant officer was “ fully satisfied
that Wellington Strait had not been “ the course of the missing ships.” For that
it was “ practicable ” to go further up Wellington Strait is evidenced by the fact
of the “ Rescue ” being as high up as midway between Point Innes and Cape
Bowden; yet Captain Ommaney, by his own words, and from what I last saw of
him as I gazed from the “ Crow’s-nest,” was evidently pushing hard on for Capes’
Hotham and Walker-
But it may be said, upon what grounds could Captain Ommaney be “fully
satisfied?” The mere fact of his finding certain “traces of encampments and
remains of materials ” on Cape Riley, without any positive notice or memorial
left of the missing expedition, would not be sufficient to “fully satisfy” which
way that expedition went; and yet it appears he was “ fully satisfied.”
In looking at this, I may observe that, though it appears no positive evidence
in the shape of written notice was found by Captain Ommaney, yet certain,
attendant circumstances, more confirmatory than anything the “ Prince Albert ”
found, might have clearly convinced him that the party who had visited Cape
Riley had done so at the early period of an expedition, and that, if that party
had been Sir John Franklin, as must be inferred, he had gone on in accordance
with his instructions direct to Cape Walker. The “ traces ” and “ remains ”
might have been such that no party but one newly arrived from England could
have left, and certainly not what a disabled party would have had with them.
The 7th paragraph of Captain Austin’s instructions is to the effect, that Cap-
tain Ommaney was to leave such notice for the “ Resolute ” as would enable her
to follow up the search (in the event of aught being found) in whatever direction
such traces would point out as most likely to be successful. What direction then
does.


does Captain Ommaney leave for the “ Resolute ? ” Why, instead of proceeding
up Wellington Channel as he had been directed, he tells Captain Austin he is
going at once to Capes Hotham and Walker.
The 9th paragraph implies that Wellington Strait has first to be-examined
by the “ Assistance,” and then she was to proceed on to Cape Walker to search
there.
In the following paragraph, Griffith’s Island is named as the place for depo-
siting a “ full account of proceedings ; ” and to this island I think especial
attention would be well directed; for there, I conceive, important information
might be gleaned. It will be to all parlies tip there a sort of central dep6t for
notices and information. Its position is prominently midway between Cape
Walker and Wellington Strait, and consequently well suited as a medium of
communication between the two, while it is accessible, on emergency,.by boat
from either, and could be reached from Melville Island. I imagine, therefore,
that “ the southern extremity of Griffith’s Island,” as mentioned by Captain
Austin, will be the main point whence information of all the Arctic ships can be
best gleaned. To it would Captain Ommaney proceed, and there leave “ that
full account of proceedings ” and “ change of plans” he was instructed to do by
Captain Austin; and to it also would each of the discovery ships proceed, if
possible ; all being acquainted with Captain Austin’s plans.
Before I conclude the remarks I have here ventured to make, I must again
revert to Cape Riley, and call attention to Captain Ommaney’s visit there.
I believe it is generally supposed that that visit was not of very long duration,
but such supposition, if ever formed, would be rather incorrect; I mean as to its
being anything short of hours. For, examine the words of his notice, and it will
be found, what struck me at the time I was transcribing it, and has always since,
viz., that he probably spent the greater part of a day there. Let us look at this
closely.
On Wednesday, August 21, at 6 a. m., the “Assistance” spoke the “Prince
Albert ” off Port Leopold, and then stood away for Cape Hurd with the wind
-north-easterly. The following day was calm and light airs, and I conclude,
therefore, that she was off Cape Riley on the afternoon of the 22d. At Cape
Riley the “Intrepid” was no doubt waiting for her, having been, as I should
suppose, ordered to proceed thither while Captain Ommaney run over from
Maxwell Bay on the night of the 20th to Port Leopold. The “ Intrepid ” would
thus have arrived at Cape Riley on the 21st, and while awaiting the “ Assistance,”
have been employed in searching the places mentioned in Captain Ommaney’s
after notice. And a most efficient search, no doubt, was made during that one
day, still further increased upon the arrival of Captain Ommaney. When the
“ Assistance ” rejoined the “ Intrepid ” on the 22d p. ra., I should imagine at
least a score or two of men were sent onshore, everywhere in the neighbourhood
of Cape Riley to minutely examine ; continuing, that examination through the
night of the 22d and morning of the 23d, when probably Captain Ommaney,
accompanied by his officers, finally landed upon the point to inspect and take
away all that had been found.
It is clear, by the notice, that some time must have been employed; for we
find that he landed, and then returned on board to write the notice.
I am inclined to think, therefore, that at least 24 hours, if not more,
was spent by Captain Ommaney and Lieutenant-commander Gator at Cape
Riley ; and that a most minute examination, bringing to light more facts than
we ourselves are aware of, but which will be fully detailed at Griffith's Island,
was made at Cape Riley and Beechey Island,
I would now observe, that with regard to any hopes for the ensuing summer,
and the prospect of obtaining additional, and, Heaven grant, happy information,
from the vessels now in the Arctic seas, there appears to me two very favourable
chances.
These are by sending a ship through Lancaster Sound, always, keeping her
return passage open, and by a land journey down the Mackenzie.
To see what are the chances on these two routes, I will briefly run over the
last known facts connected with the Arctic squadron, and glance at their pro-
bable position, say next June,
The last known facts were these: —The “Assistance” and “Intrepid” were
near Cape Hotham, among ice, but with apparent leads in various directions,
and with a month of the usual working season still before them.

Letter from Mr.
W. P. Snow to
Captain
E. K.


Captain Ommaney was on his way to Capes Hotham and Walker, and evi-
dently following up that part of Captain Austin’s instructions to him, referring
to this. He had the knowledge of everything that is as yet known concerning
the Franklin Expedition. He knew where Penny was, and where at least one
of the Americans (the “ Rescue ”) was; and he was aware that Captain Austin
would soon be following upon his heels. He would probably (unless something
very important was found at Cape Hotham to alter such intention) leave his
full particulars on Griffith’s Island, about the end of August.
Captain Austin was last heard of as having gone to Pond’s Bay on the 17 th
of August, where it is possible he may have gained some intelligence from those
natives whose forsaken encampment I noticed when examining there. He, in
all probability, was up at Port Leopold on the 24th, and on his way with the
“ Pioneer,” towards Cape Riley, on the night of the 25th, passing us in the
thick weather. He would at once make for Cape Hotham, and follow up the
“Assistance,” getting to Griffith’s Island very likely about the same time, or
soon after.
Mr. Penny was well in Wellington Channel, midway; he knew where the
other vessels were, had spoken the “ North Star,” and, no doubt, from his
proximity to the “ Assistance,” had communicated with and received intelligence
from Captain Ommaney ; but, while any uncertainty of Sir John Franklin’s after-
course existed, was pursuing his instructions, and making for the north-west to
examine.
The American, “ Advance,” was also acquainted with everything that is
known. The “ Rescue ” was far up Wellington Channel on its eastern side,
making (as Captain de Haven told me) northerly for. the western regions, and
he himself southerly; both rejoining, as I believe, in the neighbourhood of
Griffith’s Island, where an examination would be made. The northerly and the
southerly 1 speak of is, as I understood from him, the northern and the southern
sides of the main channel leading to Melville Island.
Thus the “ Rescue” would examine Wellington Channel as far as necessary,
and then proceed, as in Captain de Haven’s notice, to Cape Hotham; and thence,
by Griffith’s Island, Byam Martin Island, &c.; while the “ Advance ” stood along
by Cape Walker, and to the westward, uniting with her consort again in the
neighbourhood of Banks Land.
Sir John Ross was last off Admiralty Inlet, standing over to the northward,
with the intention (as I cannot help suspecting) of examining some of the more
northerly parts at the head of and around Baffin’s Bay.
The probable position of the Arctic squadron I would venture to suggest may
be as follows:
1. Captain Austin, in the “ Resolute” and “ Pioneer” say, somewhere west-
south-westerly, between Cape Walker and Banks Land, probably near the
latter.
2. Captain Ommaney, in the “Assistance” and “Intrepid,” say, Winter
Harbour, Melville Island.
3. Mr. Penny, perhaps in unknown parts, north of or about Bathurst
Island.
4. The Americans, without wintering in a harbour, about Banks Land,
either east or west.
5. Sir John Ross, either through Jones’ or Smith’s Sound.
Parties thrown out to examine in the spring, say —
From Captain Austin,
1. To communicate with or see if “ Assistance ” at Winter Harbour.
2. To go due south from winter position.
3. To go from Banks Land, probably under Lieutenant Osborn, according
to his plan.
From Captain Ommaney,
1. To communicate with “ Resolute.”
2. To examine northerly, and around Melville Island.
3. To proceed south-westerly from Melville Island.

From Mr. Penny,

2. To search northerly, and around his winter position.
The Americans, if unable to move in their ships, making a determined push,
by two parties, for the Coppermine and Mackenzie.
In June, then, I may venture to surmise there will be four parties during
spring examining, in a southerly and south-westerly direction, from the parallel
of 74 degrees, and the neighbourhood of Banks Land, or thence to Cape
Walker.
Thus much, then, for the westerly portion of the Arctic regions at present
discovered.
For the eastern, four prominent places may be said to hold information: Port
Leopold (possibly), Cape Riley (for “ Resolute’s ” proceedings), Cape Hotham,
and Griffith’s Island ; the last two more important than the others, and the latter
of the two more important than all.
With regard to the route by the Mackenzie, it is probable that the parties
thrown out from the ships in spring would either be still searching in June, or
have left marks of their progress. Any new party then arriving from England
by that month, would no doubt effect a communication or gather tidings. , The
question, however, is, could a party reach the Arctic sea by June? To this I
can give no answer from any personal experience; but upon referring to
Lieutenant Osborn’s plian, it seems probable that it might be done.
Sir John Richardson left England March 25th, and by the 13th of September
had reached Fort Confidence, after having gone down the Mackenzie and exa-
mined the coast round Cape Bathurst to the Coppermine. If a party left
England two months earlier, according to Lieutenant Osborn’s plan, would it be
possible to reach the Arctic sea in June? This question involves another: can
•a party travel in Northern America during any of the winter months ?
I find in reference to this, that Sir John Franklin, in his first land journey,
left Cumberland House on the 18th of January, and arrived at Fort Chippewyan
on the 26th of March; also, in the year 1836, Mr. Thomas Simpson left Fort
Garry in December, and in 46 days arrived at Fort Chippewyan.
This proves that a party could travel during the early part of the year; and
supposing they left England on the Ist of February, the following route and
dates might probably be accomplished: New York, February 15th; Buffalo,
February 23d; Goderich, February 24th; Soulte St. Maire, March Ist; Fort
William, March 10th ; Fort Garry, March 24th ; Fort Chippewyan, April 24th;
Slave River (last portage), May 17th; Arctic sea, June 10th.
The party would then have July, August, and September to work in.
As respects a communication via Lancaster Sound, I cannot help thinking it
might be effected.
It strikes me, therefore, with all submission to the opinion of those whose
experience and long attention to the subject better enable them to judge, that if
-a small vessel of from 40 to 50 tons, schooner rigged, and equipped for a boat
expedition, were to go out very early in the year from home, to take advantage
of every opening that occurs in the ice, she would be able to reach Lancaster
'Sound at the commencement of the summer. And supposing the worst to be
taken into consideration, and allowing the sound to be at that time impassable
for ships, at once dispatch her boats to Griffith’s Island, following up herself as
the ice permitted, in a similar manner to Commander Pullen’s party.
A few facts, permit me here, to glance at.
The size of the vessel is no smaller than some of those employed by the old
voyagers of the 16th and 17th centuries, if the tonnage then and now is the
same. Baffin’s little ship, it is well known, was only 65 tons, and he reached
open water in lat. 75 deg. 40 min. on the Ist of July.

In 1849, according to Dr. Scoresby, the “ St. Andrew” whaler got into the
west water on the 12th June, and Captain Penny, in 1838, on the 13th June.
And in his “ Franklin Expedition,” page 56, the same authority observes, that
“ the northern and north-western parts of Baffin’s Bay, with a considerable space
within Lancaster Sound, may at the same time (termination of the spring of the
year) be clear of ice.”
Again, a little craft of the kind and size I have named would be in no more
danger than one 30 or 40 tons larger, and she would have the advantage that
the “Prince Albert” possessed, of being enabled to run between any grounded
bergs and the shore when examining, and also of making more rapid way
through the ice, by taking every opportunity afforded by the smaller openings.
The expense of such a vessel would not be much. If she were lost, the loss
would be of little importance.
The object sought to be obtained could be effected by her as well as by a
larger vessel, if intelligence from the Arctic squadron or their outposts be all
that is desired.
That such intelligence may be obtained this summer is, I venture to suggest,
extremely possible, if considered necessary.
That any intelligence from or of them is important is evident; for who can
tell whether those ships themselves may not get so blocked in that they cannot
well get out? And how great, in such case, would be the value of our knowing
what they have done and where they are. Who can say that they may not now
have got fast hold of the. end of that chain, the beginning of which was found at
Cape Riley ? It is, therefore, with great respect that I venture to submit the
plan I have here mentioned. The details of that plan I shall feel much pleasure
in forwarding, if called upon; but I may observe that my calculation makes
1,200 I. sufficient for the outlay (wages excepted). The purchase of the vessel,
strengthening, stores, and provisions included.
Her crew to consist of one master, two mates, and six seamen ; the master
and four of the men forming the boat party on arrival at Lancaster Sound, or
where else the ice stops the vessel in that part of the exploring ground.
Two whale boats, one of them a gutta percha, to accompany her; a cradle for
the boat when on the ice, as a substitute for a sledge; a knapsack for each of
the party ; a staff, like a Swiss Alpine stock ; and a board six or seven feet long,
strong, but not heavy, to form part of the boat equipment. The staff is to hold
horizontally when walking over the ice, thus proving a means of safety should
any one using it fall through a narrow crack. The board is for the purpose of
acting as a bridge, when coming to any opening in the ice, or rugged pieces
that cannot be well leaped over; it should be like a knife-board, with a locker
at one end, and lined at that end with gutta percha underneath ; a moveable
spike should also be affixed at each end, so that it might remain firm when act-
ing as the bridge ; lanyards to be attached to the extremities. In travelling on
the ice, this board could be dragged along very easily and without encumbering
any one, by passing the lashing loosely round a man’s shoulders.
In conclusion, I have only to observe, that should I be considered worthy of
such honour I willingly offer my humble services in assisting to carry out either
of the plans I have named, by taking an active part therein. Were I permitted
to take charge of a little vessel, such as I have described, I can only say that
unceasing labour and perseverance, with due attention to any commands I
might receive, would be devoted by me to the furtherance of the object in which
I should be engaged. It is not for any man to say that success will crown his
exertions, but 1 would do all that it is possible for man to do to achieve that
success ; and should hope to prove that I was not undeserving of the honour and
confidence bestowed upon me.

Admiralty, February 1851.
The rumour current of a party of white people being in the interior and cut
off from the Russians by a hostile tribe, I consider to be altogether a fabrication.
The Russians have all the tribes in the north-west corner of the Continent in
subjection, and had so 15 years ago, before their posts were extended so far
north and east as they are now, when they came very near the Hudson’s Bay
Company’s posts.
