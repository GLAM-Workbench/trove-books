Drilling was carried out by a crew consisting of two Australian drillers
with three Cambodian assistants, using a Mindrill F2SA diamond drill. Drill
cores are stored in a building at the northern end of the Kratie Power Station,
Cambodia. Keys of this store are held by the Chief of Public Works, Kratie.
Geological logs and photographs of the drill core are arranged in order
of drilling, commencing with the eight holes drilled in 1960/1961 season and
followed by the remaining nine holes drilled in 1961/1962 season. The notes
below explain the procedures adopted in this work, and the various details
entered on the core log sheets are also given in this volume.
NOTES ON DRILLING PROCEDURES
(a) Equipment
Core sizes are as follows:
Symbol Nominal Diameter of Core
inches centimetres
NXC (NX casing) 2.84 7.223
NMLC (NM large core) 2.04 5.194
BMLC (BM large core) 1.39 3.520
All cores except NXC were obtained with "M" type stationary inner tube core
barrels fitted with bottom discharge bits, and in a number of cases split
inner tube core barrels 5 feet long (approximately 1.5 metres) were used to
ensure maximum core recovery. The NXC core obtained by dry drilling from
near the ground surface was often disturbed.
(b) Water Pressure Testing
The following procedure was used in water pressure tests on the drill
holes:


(i) Immediately after the drilling of the test section, commonly 20
feet (6 metres) long, the hole was cleaned out by flushing with water
pumped down through the drill rods until the returning water was clear;
(ii) A mechanically expansible rubber packer in series with NM-size drill
rods, or a hydraulically expansible packer on the end of the drill rods,
was placed down the hole at the top of the test section and expanded to
form a seal against the walls of the hole;
(iii) Water was pumped into the test section between the packer and the
bottom of the hole at a constant pressure measured by a pressure gauge.
The pressure was maintained for a period of 15 minutes and the quantity
of water pumped into the hole during this time was measured by a water
meter. Without moving the packer the test was repeated at increased
2
pressures, usually by increments of about 2 kg per cm , up to a maximum
pressure not exceeding the unit weight of a column of rock equal to the
depth of the packer below the surface.
(iv) Drilling was resumed and the hole deepened a further 20 feet (6
metres); this section was then tested as before.
(c) Storing and Marking of Core
Cores are stored in wooden boxes, the internal length of which is 5 feet
1 inch to allow for 1007<> core recovery. The roughness of the ends of the
core, and small inaccuracies in measurement when breaking it to fit the box,
make it impossible to fit the core in a compartment exactly 5 feet long.
The boxes are marked in paint with the drill hole number and consecutive
compartment number at one end and the approximate drilled depth from the
surface in metres at the other. The drilled depth shown on the boxes is,
therefore, not exact and does not correspond with the accurate length of core
shown on the log and painted in feet on the core and the core boxes.


Core was placed in boxes as soon as it was extracted from the core
barrel. The bottom of the lift was marked with paint immediately it was
placed in the box and a corresponding mark was placed on the side of the core
box. The measured depth of the hole in feet from the surface was painted on
the side of the core box and on the core. Timber blocks cut to length were
used to indicate core not recovered, core stolen or core removed for test
purposes.
NOTES ON DETAILS SHOWN ON LOG SHEET
At the head of the sheet, details of the hole are given consisting of
co-ordinates, reduced level at ground surface, angle from horizontal, and
direction of hole. The logs are plotted on a scale of 1 centimetre = 1 metre
(1:100). In the column headed "Log", places where core was obtained are
shown by stippling: places where core was lost are shown by blank spaces.
Core is lost by the material being ground or washed away during the drilling
process; it may usually be inferred that such material is relatively weak.
Near the surface this weakness may arise from the unconsolidated nature of
alluvial sediments, or from weathering. At greater depths the weakness may
arise from weathering confined to narrow seams in otherwise fresh rock, or
from shearing, crushing or close jointing. It cannot always be assumed that
the material nQt recovered is weak, since even solid rock core may be ground
away and lost during drilling operations.
The core size symbol is shown on the log sheets under the heading
"Size of Core".
The drilling lifts and the approximate percentage core recovery is
shown in the column "Lift and Core Recovery %".


In the column "Structures", angles shown on joints, bedding or other
geological structures are the angles they make with the plane at 90 to the
axis of the core.
Results of water pressure tests carried out on the drill holes to obtain
some measure of the permeability of the rock mass are shown in the column
headed "Water Pressure Test".
