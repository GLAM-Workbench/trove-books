Sydney, 21st June, 1842.


PREFACE.
This little volume is put forth, with no pretensions
to any particular excellence; and yet not wholly
without a hope that it may be found to possess
some degree of merit. Nearly all my poems (my
book, I fear, affords another instance of the per-
version of that word) have been put together in
thought, in ? moments ? literally ? stolen ? from
the time occupied by the ordinary duties of a not
over-happy life; my leisure having been generally
devoted to other, perhaps, better, purposes. > I do
not, however, seek shelter in any unfavourable
circumstance, from deserved censure; and *1 ask
not, ?would feel ashamed to the end of my days
to accept a breath of praise not deservedly
awarded.
I feel acutely how feeble must be any effort of
mine to serve the cause of Australian literature, ?
the more acutely, because it would be my greatest
happiness to do so; for, if I had indeed a motive
in publishing, beyond the gratification of my feel-
ings, by having these trifles arranged in their
present form for the perusal of my friends, it was
the hope that my success might prove a stimulative


to literary enterprise in New South Wales. The
voice of praise would be doubly sweet to me, if it
were to encourage some Australian bard to seize
in earnest the unstrung lyre of his beautiful
country.
The greater number of the pieces here collected
have appeared before, in periodical publications,
in this country or in England. Of those pub-
lished in Australia, all, with one exception,* were
sent to the Australasian Chronicle , through the me-
dium of the letter-box; (as I am still personally
a stranger to the talented and high-minded gen-
tleman who conducts that journal) though some
of them have found their way into various other
publications.
The pleasing duty remains for me to pay my
grateful acknowledgments to my Subscribers : in
the name pf Australian literature, I thank them,
each individually, and all sincerely, for their en-
couragement and support. My humble work is
now before them?'
? Would it were worthier ! ?
Sydney, 21st June, 1842.

STOLEN MOMENTS.
TO CLARINDA.
The sun-burst ?mid the heart?s sweet showers,
Which love alone may know ;
The grief-surviving, precious flowers.
Where nothing else can grow?
The fairer of misfortune?s bowers
Will still on us bestow.
I care not what the heartless say;
I spurn the busy train,
Who point to joy?s untold decay.
And talk of folly?s pain :
Ah ! wiser and more blest than they
The slave that licks his chain.


I care not who in wealth may shine,
I heed not pleasure?s call;
I pause not ev?n at wisdom?s shrine,
Nor fear what may befall;
I only feel that thou art mine
Unchangingly through all.
Even as a trampled flower, of brief
Existence in the field,
Our mingled souls remain in grief,
Our sorrows unrevealed ;
Thou art the bloom, I am the leaf,
And love the light we yield.
Birmingham, 1835.


BLIGHTED LOVE.
Like sunbeams of an angry day,
Which seem to weep their warmth away;
Like waves which winds at midnight make,
Chasing the moonbeams o?er the lake?
Waves of a breath, which tremble forth
In hidden beauty, but to die
The moment they would cling to earth?
Are young hearts doom?d to love and sigh
A flower of Hope?and hope so brief!?
Which, shaken, sheds ihe seeds of grief;
A beam of peace, which passes by
Before the mourner?s cheek is dry;
A beauteous dream of sweet distress
Is all the happiest here possess !
Then, think ye, if so fleet and vain
The most which Fortune?s favourites gain?


Oh ! think ye, what must be the fate
Of the despised and desolate,
O?er whom the blight of love is hurled,
Left, withering in a smiling world.
Birmingham, 1834.


FRAGMENT.
?Twas midnight?not a lingering lamp,
In cottage far as eye could strain,
Was seen to cheer the wandering swain;
The taper, in a gipsy?s camp,
Alone was glimmering o?er the plain.
A needy and benighted man,
Of woe-bent form, and visage wan,
Attracted by the trembling ray,
Which seem?d at times to die away,
And sad as suffering wretch who sighs
Because none share his miseries,?
Wandered across the gloomy wold,
To find a shelter from the cold:
And various were his visions then.
Of happy hearths and honest men.


Poor pathless pilgrim ! know?st thou not.
The gipsies choose a dreary spot,
Where dwell they by mankind forgot?
Why goest thou there ??it is no cot.
Birmingham, 1834.


A SUMMER EVENING.
In heaven the stars which come ere night
Stood trembling o?er the tranquil sea,
?Twining the beauties of their light
In the red wreaths of brilliancy,
Which sunset melted into, slowly
Along the western realms of air,
Like the long wings of angels holy,
Bearing from earth some penitent there.
And oh, the fair and quiet world,
How pure a place it then appeared !
To think that death was o?er it hurled,
Mortal at that bright hour had feared.
The placid waters, the green trees,
The balmy flowers, the birds and bees, >


lii summer?s general loveliness.
Assembled round, man?s lot to bless,
Sent gladness, like a glorious dream,
Through the lone soul, with sacred beam !
No ruder sound than song of bird
The ear of museful wanderer heard ;
A thing less welcome than a flower
The eye beheld not in that hour.
Birmingham, 1837.


THE CAPTIVE,
A FRAGMENT.
My lady they have torn away;
My boys are with the slain ;
My heart is cold as lifeless clay;
My tears but rust my chain.
My lady?she may still survive.
Our children all departed,?
Perchance, we both remain alive,
Alike both broken-hearted !


THE VOICE OF SIN.
Father, and wilt thou welcome back
The weary wanderers home,
Who faint on sorrow?s thorny track,
As through the world they come ?
Father, thy gracious smile impart,
Even to a wretch who feels
The world?s thick darkness round his heart,
While at thy feet he kneels.
Father, I have offended Thee,
'And done unholy things;
From thy own justice shelter me,
All under thy own wings !
Father, make peace with me, and take
A rebel to thy breast;
O, for a bleeding Saviour?s sake,
Give to the weary rest!


STANZA.
High- destined daughter of our country, thou,
Who sitt?st on England?s throne in beauty?s morning!
God pour his richest blessings round thee now :
And may the eyes that watch thy glory?s dawning,
With hearts right glad and loyal, proudly scorning
All that dare hostile to Victoria be,
Daily behold new light thy name adorning ?
So may?st thou trust thy people?s love for thee,
Queen of this mighty land, Protectress of the Free!
21st June, 1838.


SONG OF THE NIGHT.
Go, wander at midnight among the green hills,
Where the rivulet?s voice, or the nightingale s
only,
The wild leafy region with melody fills.
While the lone moon above makes it look the more
lonely!
Go, vain one, and hear the sweet bird of the night.
Singing hymns to the Giver of joy anA delight!
Or go, when the moon?s silver banner is streaming
Above the repose of the night-shadow?d sea,
And gaze on the beautiful billows all beaming
Far over its breast, like the souls of the free !
Then think of the lofty in spirit, who sleep,
With their histories sealed, in the caves of the deep.


Or turn to the stars which adorn the blue heaven,
All smiling in beauty and mystery there,
As types of the blest, by the Holy One given,
Who, passing o?er earth, made its deserts so fair!
Decypher the strange, shining characters penn?d
On the scroll of the skies, and there read of life?s end.
And then, as some picture of genius or fame,
Which memory has brought from the depths of the
past,
Relumines thy bosom with hope?s early flame,
Oh! ask thy lone heart, while its pure feelings last,
Ere the moon night to her palace is gone,
Whether thou wi'uld?st exchange that night?s joy for
a throne .
London, April, 1839.


POVERTY,
A FRAGMENT.
Though all unwept, thy victim died, 0, World !
Had he no source of joy in hours devoted
To some dear purpose ? Calumny hath hurled
Her poison on the lowly grave, where rotted
His sacred bones; and Time, in sport, has blotted
His simple name from memory ! Who shall tell,
Though such is fate, what God for him allotted,
The time he in the desert had to dwell ?
And who, presuming, say, he lived not, died not,
well?
Yes, Poverty, thy children?s eyes have beamed
With noblest feelings, ?midst their cold distress;
And tears of rapture down their cheeks have
streamed,
'While gazing on another?s happiness!


True, when they?ve turn?d from such a scene,
excess
Of sorrow hath o?erwhelm?d the weary heart.
Till the sweet thought returned, with power to
bless, ?
?The time will come when misery shall depart!?
And now they?re gone, to dwell where thou, meek
Lazarus, art!
None weep for them, and for them none should
weep?
Sorrow so cold and idle would be sin,
While others bear a bitterness as deep?
Their solitary living hearts within.
And who, ?mid Pleasure?s daily pomp and din,
Will think to sigh for Grief?s surviving child,
Whose fairest works of virtue cannot win
A smile from Fortune ? Who, in this bleak wild,
Will heed a gloomy thing, that ne?er has gladsome
smiled ?


They pass, who see the aged beggar lying,
All ill and helpless, on the icy street:
And heed not, though the houseless one be dying,
Exposed to Winter?s tearing winds and sleet!
And they, who stop unwillingly to greet
Their wealthiest friend, on such a wintry day,
Tho?, when they reach their home, they say ?tis sweet,
Bear with them no sad thought of him who lay,
Without a friend or home, to perish by the way !
Still there are moments in the night of sorrow
Of sweet, though earthly, joy which sufferers know,
When the lone heart, all mindless of to-morrow,
In its pure thoughtfulness, forgets its woe;
And turns to others? tears, which faster flow ;
And wishes then the things of earth were sweeter,
Till it believes its own sad portion so !
It looks on love?s approach, and bounds to meet her, ?
The spell breaks! but again returns the beauteous
meteor.


And when will mortals learn to love each other
With brotherly and gentle hearts? Is this
No glorious world, which truth and love might
cover
With light, and peace, and innocence, and bliss ?
Oh ! man might build o?er Misery?s dark abyss
A bridge of flowers, to glad the pilgrim?s eye,
Rising in beauty from the precipice,
Based in the heart, and arching to the sky ;
And paths of peace extend where wilds now track-
less lie.
London, March, 1839.


SOLITUDE,
A FRAGMENT.
Tis sweet, in moonlight solitudes,
To wander ?mong the waving trees,
Where nothing worldly e?er intrudes,
To chill the heart?s pure sympathies ;
The glory through the still night falling,
Fresh from the ? poetry of heaven,? *
Past scenes of joy and peace recalling,
Which only once to youth were given ;
The flow?rets in the green wood springing,
Making the air we?re breathing sweet,
Thoughts of the loved and absent bringing,
The loved we never more may meet!
Sweet, as the moon her banner lifts
High o?er our pathway ?mong the elms,
To watch each silvery cloud which shifts
Along her wake in those blue realms !
? Ye sta<s which are the poetry of heaven.? Childe Hauold.


STANZAS,
WRITTEN ON BOARD THE BARQUE ? STRATHFIELDSAYE,? ON
THE NIGHT OF THE IST MAY, 1839.
A storm in distant darkness cowers upon the stilly deep;
Within a low cloud?s parted folds three stars their
lone watch keep ;
Frequent the Tropic lightning flings its ocean-flash
o?er heaven ;
And through the gloom the shaded moon?s wan outline
still is given.
There?s mingled in the scene to-night a splendour and
a gloom,
Which life?s evanished scenes ne?er cross?d, to darken
or illume;
Yet my sad thoughts hang o?er the past ?the lovely
and the dark,
As o?er the sleeping waters floats our lorie and lazy bark.


The wet sails, flapping o?er my head, to me sweet
music make,
The lightnings seem an angel?s smiles, as through the
clouds they break;
For musings of a deep, dear kind to-night are stealing
o?er me,
Of things for ever left behind, and things all new
before me !
Even while hope?s golden future opens round me, and
I bless,
With the heart?s tears, some fairy dream of far-off
happiness,
Even while I picture a sweet home for her I love so well,
A mother?s parting tears, which flow afresh, dissolve
the spell!
Those tearful eyes are absent now, the time may come
no more,
When I shall see them weep or smile, on England?s
distant shore ;


But He who gave a mother?s love, to cheer life?s
younger day,
Will help the hapless wanderer on the world?s un-
friendly way.
O, God, let virtue elevate my solitary heart!
Whate?er of joy or grief may fall to my allotted
part?
Whate?er may lift my spirit or my sinking soul en-
thral,
In the world?s struggles, strengthen me to hold the
right thro? all!


NIGHT ON THE EQUATOR.
A CALM.
The veil of night o?erspreads the torrid sky.
Through which a?whelming gush of starlight breaks,
Oppressively resplendent to the eye,
As from his feverish sleep the sailor wakes?
Stretch?d on the deck, which now he nightly makes
His pillow, when his lonely watch is done;
And the great moon is risen again, and takes
Her way thro? heaven, still glowing from the sun;
And on the deadened deep our bark?s an only one.
A fearful calm is dwelling on the sea,
As were the waters dreaming in their sleep;
And heaven is full of a placidity.
As awful as the slumber of the deep.


The few light clouds that on the horizon keep
Have in their aspect an ethereal death ;
And vain the goodliest vessel?s power to sweep
Along the waters, ?there is not a breath
Of air to stir her sails, the blinding moon beneath.
A BREEZE.
Look up among the multitude of lights,
Which hang in heaven, so soul-like and serene;
Behold the glory of these Tropic nights
Melt through the azure depths, which lie 'be-
tween
Those far, fair worlds, where God is surely seen !
Look up in pious love?s supremacy,
As glides our bark swift through the glowing
scene;
And the Creator?s omnipresence see,
Where?er thy soul can search, some glimpse of
Deity !


O, Mortal! tear the serpent from thy brow,
Thy pride of heart should not profane thee here;
God on the waters waits thy worship now,
The God who loves the lowly heart sincere.
And who to-night could view, and not revere
The Hand that framed those shining mysteries,
Still shedding o?er each world?s alloted sphere
The shadow of his glory ? The glad seas,
Methinks, give praise to Him, who gives this blessed
breeze !


RETROSPECTIVE LINES,
WRITTEN ON THE PASSAGE FROM ENGLAND TO AUSTRALIA IN
THE YEAR 1839.
In beautiful commotion roll the waves,
As the low sun his burning forehead laves,
And calmly sinks into the cooling sea,
Waving his banners o?er the waters free :
And heaven, above the Atlantic?s skyey hue,
Displays, in rivalling light, its richer blue :
And fast our gallant vessel cleaves her way,
Home, kindred, friends, ?alas ! where now are-they ?
Oh ! ?tis delightful to the lonely breast,
To breathe new life ?mid ocean?s calm unrest,
Ride on the crested waves which gleam and tower
Round the ship?s course, as conscious of their power;
And, with far-searching and adoring eye,
Look from their summits to the sunny sky,


And, ?neath the shadow of Omnipotence,
Feel the full force of Nature?s eloquence,
Like that pure faith which strengthens life and
blesses,
Deep-gushing into all the soul's recesses.
Delightful, though all uncompanioned here,
Far separated from each friend sincere,
To muse on God?s stupendous works of light,
Till memory, waking at some semblance slight.
Which to past scenes the beauteous present bears,
In heavenly picture dimmed with earthly cares,
Turns to the loved companions left behind,
Who, though neglected, could not grow unkind ;
And, lingering long o?er some remember?d scene
Of early days, where all have happy been,
Restores youth?s absent friends, and, for their sakes,
A beauty in the depth of misery makes.
Alas, that fatal word has broke the spell!
Yet shall my muse no tale of misery tell;


I will not lift the veil from wretchedness,
Where much is unavoidable distress.*
To speak of woe to those who feel it not
May but disturb another?s happier lot;
Without the thorns which lacerate the heart
Being extracted from the wounded part.
I will not think of hardships past, for such,
Perhaps, my weakness magnified too much ;
Nor, idly murmuring o?er the present, add
More evil to the thing already bad ;
But turn back o?er the many-pictured page,
To the beginning of life?s pilgrimage,
And, for my theme, select the brightest parts, ?
The most acceptable to happy hearts.
* Alluding to the'tween-deck commotion of an Emigrant Ship; of
this, no adequate idea can be formed by those who have not seen it.
To complete the wretchedness of the crowded hole, in which three or
four hundred human beings are pent together for the space of four
months, the ear is incessantly assailed by the coarse expressions and
blasphemies of the profligate; and the eye, let,it turn where it will,
is offended by some malignity or unnecessary unpleasantness in the con-
duct of those around. You may be melancholy, you may be ill, you may
be dying,?still it is the same, and, under the best management, seems
unavoidable.


A mother?s love is treasured in the light,
Which Memory brings to make my pictures bright
A mother?s smiles, when first a mother?s name
Struck on my senses, like a kindling flame,
And, breaking open the heart?s fountains, brought
The floods to fertilize the fields of thought,?
With fresh effulgence, the heart?s depths relume,
Like morning?s sunshine melting midnight?s gloom
Well I remember all the gentle ways
A mother for her children?s sakes essays,
To lessen sorrow in the time of tears,
Or hope enkindle ?midst the bosom?s fears ;
A mother?s promised joys?a better home,
And trustier friends, in happy days to come !
Ah, Hope, sweet Hope, delusive charmer, thou
Didst promise then, and dost but promise now !
How false thy smiles, alas ! my parents found,
On Virtue?s every effort Fortune frown?d.
Still, ?mid the ruin of their youth?s own day,
Even while the spoiler swept each joy away,


A mother?s love too fondly trusted time,
For restitution in her children?s prime.
Though cold Misfortune mark?d her own estate,
Fair as it seem?d, suddenly desolate.
She could not dare to think of less than joy,
Unchanging still, for each dear girl and boy.
Years rolled away ; and, ?mid misfortunes new,
My elder brothers all to manhood grew ;
But in the fields, where we together play?d
In life?s sweet morning, now no more we stray?d;
Each had to seek at strangers? hands a home.
And far in weary search each had to roam : ?
With weeping hearts we parted,?that distress
Left an afflicted mother comfortless.
How fares she now ??the griefs of later years
Had almost dried the fountain of her tears;
But sorrow, as a burning iron?s trace,
Was deep depicted in her sunken face,
When I last saw her bosom?s anxious swell
Rise with the sad response ? Farewell, fare-
well ! ?


And now the ocean?s billowy boundlessness
Lies out all round me, as, companionless,
I pace the deck, and, weeping, think of her,
My childhood?s angel, my life?s comforter !
And the o?erpowering thought?away, away,
Borne on to-morrow as I?ve been to-day,
Till that far world receives me, and I share
The stranger?s heritage of toil and care,
Like a new sense enthroned above the rest,
Softens each sterner feeling of my breast.
Still, still, ?mid all, and all things else above.
Is kept the memory of a mother?s love !
How sweet the sunshine of our early days,
When the young bosom hath a thousand ways,
Where yet no hardships on existence press,
Ever to find its daily happiness !
All nature, as the prospect opens round,
At every step, with some fresh light is crown?d.
The streamlet?s sunny banks, the summer bower,
The lofty tree, the lowly meadow flower,


The birds and bees about our quiet home.
The something beautiful, where?er we roam ;
Oh ! these have then an influence o?er the heart,
Which all of after-life will not impart.
Then the world?s voices, coming round us, all,
With our own innocence are musical;
Howe?er the world our hearts from peace estrange,
As time grows older, or those voices change.
The eye then sees but beauty in each form,
The rainbow?s glory, mindless of the storm ;
The heart but beats with truth?s young principle,
The vital warmth of joy unspeakable ;
And then alone to human love is given
Some blessed foretaste of its future heaven.
Remembrance ever clings to that sweet time,
When joy and innocence were in their prime ;
?Mid gay or melancholy after-scenes.
Still life?s lost paradise e?er intervenes !
The early friendships undisturb?d and sweet,
Form?d ?mid the cheerful scenes where children meet;


The hand-in-hand excursions in the sun.
Seeking; wild flowers to deck some favourite one ;
The simple treasures which content the breast,
Too simple yet for envy to molest;
The constant light our first of homes above,
The living rainbow of parental love ;
Th? approval half-suppress?d, the mild reproof,
The hours of prayer beneath that sacred roof;
The thousand charms which hallow childhood?s
home,
Deep, unseen springs which joy keeps flowing from?
These come again in Memory?s train to bless
The weary wanderer of the wilderness.
Even now I see the grove, the green retreat
Of happy children from the noontide heat;
Oft sought in laughing haste by boy and girl,
A shelter from the summer shower as well.
The cowslip-gatherers from the market town,
The dames and damsels, pacing up and down


The flowery meadows, as industriously
As ever, to my mind, even now I see.
But other scenes in Memory?s wake appear,
Chequer?d by generous Friendship?s smile and tear,
When those whom first the young heart learnt to
Some grief unbosom?d we could not remove;
Or shared some transient, heart-felt happiness,
In those last days before life?s joys grew less !
I see the old lane?s windings, where we roved,
?Mid bright familiar things, less bright than loved,
Oft, when the moon was shining out so light,
We could have counted, in the depth of night,
Even the blue violets which gemmed the banks ;
While youthful piety pour?d fervent thanks
To Him, who, moving ?midst chaotic night,
In the beginning, said ? Let there be light! ?
The well-known village,?the white cottages,
And ivied church among the ancient trees,


When summer?s sunrise, like the existence given
To one who wakes from this world?s sleep in heaven,
Shone in pure gladness o?er the prospect fair ;
And Friendship led the morning ramble there !
I see again in rustic joy and pride,
As if between us rolled not Ocean?s tide.
Oh! sweet the wanderer?s retrospections now,
Though, humbled by misfortune, he must bow
To an unsmiling fate, the sweet things shown
In Memory?s mirror, still are Sorrow?s own.
William, my distant but my dearest friend !
?Midst the world?s tumult, dost thou ever send
. t
Thy heart away, on Memory?s eager wings,
To one who names thee yet with life?s best things?
Oft wandered we far in the noiseless night,
In converse deep on themes of love and light,
Dreaming of a fair future, and surrounded
By all which then our wiser wishes bounded.
Oft, as the hawthorns o?er our pathway spread,
With all their fragrant vernal snows unshed,


Keeping the very moonlight back awhile,
As if to shew how sweet its sudden smile,
It seemed so all unlike the ? haunts of men,?
We had no thought the world was near us then,
Till we the peasant boy and maiden met.
Who, too, such happy nights would ne?er forget.
Such may not be again?alas ! for me,
This is the chilling probability ;
We may not meet again,?yet, dearest friend.
Not as my last, this sad farewell I send.
Oh ! what so sweet as Friendship?s wanderings
What in our friendlessness such pleasure brings
As their benign remembrance ? I would not
Live on when hours so sacred were forgot.
And e?en our boyhood?s quarrels, when we had
No foe beside an almost friendly lad,
Were sweet, and now remember?d, sweeter are.
For they demonstrate, when so slight a jar


Of feeling shook composure, like a sin,
How pure and undissembling all within !
When the dull town?s continual din and strife
Exacted largely from maturer life,
And eyes looked through the scenes of ripening years,
Where the forced smile but shew?d the unshed tears,
Joy, gladdenning, came with the remember?d lot,
Where Peace was ever, and were Grief was not.
And now, when mine are more than boyhood?s years,
And life?s surrounding summer full appears,?
Though not such summer as hath constant bloom.
But such whose fevers fill the untimely tomb, ?
Joy, cheering, comes with memory?s visions vast
Of that, e?en that, sad portion of the past.
?Twas ?mid the restlessness of crowded streets,
Where Virtue, Vice, and Pleasure, Misery meets,
My burning soul received a purer flame,
A newer light through all ray musings came,


From Shelley?s poetry ; and there I found
The chosen bard, by Hope and Freedom crown?d,
The patriot?s favourite, Campbell! ?Tis no dream,
t To feel again the first descending gleam
Of new-born glory, from the poet?s lyre,
Melt o?er us with its touch of heavenly fire.
?Twas ?midst the city?s nightly revellings,
I first saw Genius pluming her young wings,
In sacred loneliness, for flight sublime,
Shut from the worldling, and his life of crime.
?Twas there I mingled with the blessed few
Of Nature?s children, whom I ever knew.
Who strove with Poverty, in bold pursuit
Of knowledge, and the freedom, its best fruit.
Pure is the pleasure, the mind?s rise to watch,
Though ?neath the lonely cot?s obscuring thatch,
Or ?mid the workshop?s coarse profanities,
It pass through nature?s unperceived degrees,
To that maturity which glorifies
Its growth, and fast unfolds it to our eyes !


Pure is the pleasure, though unworthy he,
Who hath that pleasure, and that honour, be.
And I have watch?d the children of the poor,
Like Hunger?s victims at the rich man?s door,
Who turn not from denial, jeer, or threat,
But knock the louder, till some bread they get?
Yes !?watch?d them oft, to wisdom?s waters come,
From toils ungenial, trial? wearisome,
Press through all obstacles, to gain the brink,
Thirsting for knowledge, and resolved to drink.
And ?mong the jewels in Joy?s diadem,
There are none brighter than my thoughts of them.
Smile not, Wealth?s favour?d ones, with all your store,
Your vain monopoly of classic lore, ?
They were mechanics, true, who ne?er had seen
Your ancient seats of learning?ne?er had been
At Oxford, nor at Cambridge, where the wise
Lure Genius onward with the dazzling prize !
They were mechanics, true, ?which you are not,
Yet they, perchance, knew more than you?ve forgot.


Still, though ?gainst them their country?s schools
were barr?d,
Not all unblest were they, with lot so hard,
They had?enough to make your boasters mute,
Their own self-rear?d Mechanics? Institute.
No more, though the heart?s interests still unite
All thoughts and feelings o?er those scenes of light,
No more of such sweet recollections now,
One gloomier picture must succeed their glow.
Hid in the city?s vile obscurities,
?Mid Folly?s pageants, Fortune?s palaces,
Dwell Misery?s unemploy?d and breadless throngs,
The wretched sufferers of a nation?s wrongs.
Go, thou who sleep?st on down, or fain would?st
sleep,
Did not the damning worm o?er conscience creep,
When evil dares to coalesce with good,
The heart seek sleep, the mind feel solitude?
Thou who hast learnt to laugh at others? woes,
Confederate of our land?s unnatural foes.


Go, enter yon dim chamber, and survey
(Laugh, if thou cans?t, the while!) thy master?d prey!
What are those living?living can they be ?
Those moving forms we round that something see ?
Is that a bed the startled eye there sees ?
Are those three children, or three images ?
Is that the face of woman?of a mother ?
And oh ! is that a dead man?s face?that other ?
Yes ! there he lies?known is the tale of woe,
His children?s cries for bread had crazed him so,
His misery tore out nature Ifom his heart,
And from his own he wrench?d himself apart,
Though they had been his bliss and bosom?s pride,
His last sad act the sin of suicide ! *
? The lamentable case of suicide, which forms the subject of the text,
occurred at Birmingham, in January 1838. The unfortunate individual
was a Pocket-book Maker, and had been unemployed at the time of
his self-destruction, notwithstanding all his efforts to obtain some kind of
labour, for more than six months, during which time he and his family
had had no certain means of subsistence, beyond the miserable pittance of
parochial relief, and the weekly earnings of the eldest of three small
children ; and their neighbours were mostly too much reduced in their
circumstances, by the general distress of the time, to render them any
assistance where they were disposed to do so. He w r as a man of good
moral character and industrious habits, and it was satisfactorily proved
before the Coroner, that the suicide was the consequence of extreme
destitution.


Yes, those dim cheeks are children?s?they are dim,
Alas! but not with this day?s grief for him !
Those helpless ones no comfort had remaining.
From former wrecks of peace, and want?s long paining,
To perish 'neath the blight of new distress ;
No warmth of infancy?s progressiveness,
Left for this horror?s chilling touch to tame;
No impulse for the dire event which came.
They had been taught to love that parent well,
Nor taught in vain, as he oft joy?d to tell!
But she, whose happy task it was to teach,
Now hath not strength to weep, nor thought for speech,
From suffering?s long exhaustion?and, if shCj
A wife, is so out-worn by poverty,
How must their young emaciated hearts
Have been despoil?d of their divinest parts,
By that calamity, the foul creation
Of speculative, tax-proud Legislation !
Call not this cold distress a casualty,
Which might have been ?neath best men?s ministry,


And the most wholesome laws?ah, dream not so.
Look through our land, and see the general woe !
What drives the poor mechanic from that shore.
His sires had sooner died than left of yore ?
What drives the weeping emigrant away,
Who leaves his home, with curses on the day ?
Say not, thou hast it, Population Prater, ?
And the discover?d curse could not be greater ;
Say not, Sublime of Fools, ?tis all because
Nature?s are not like thy restrictive laws !
Ere thy philosophy, beyond all doubt,
Shew?d the true cause, the world had found it out;
All the disastrous superfluity
Of thought and action is compress?d in thee !
Relentless misrule, grown inveterate slowly,
By man?s endurance of its acts unholy,
Turns into worst of weakness England?s power,
And fast accelerates her evil hour;
Relentless misrule tears from England?s breast,
Her sons who?ve loved, and served their country best!


AN ENGLISH SCENE.
A fountain?s face the feathery moss
In a green sheet had crept across,
And cover?d half the low wall, piled,
Like a grot?s ruins, round about it;
And ?mong the wild grass flowers grew wild,
Beside a stream which gush?d from out it.
High o?er it grew a grand old oak,
Which ne?er had felt the tempest?s stroke,
W T hose heavy arms,.though sorely wrinkled
With age, yet wore a shining robe
Of young green leaves, which softly twinkled
In the last light of day?s low orb.
Beside the fountain-stream, a child
Sat musing ?mid the flow?rets wiki;


A boy of beauty, with blue eye
Fix?d on the bubbling water, where
He, wondering, saw a pictured sky,
Himself the only angel there !
The streamlet flow?d in murmurs soft,
Adown his father?s cottage croft:
The primrose ?neath the hedge-row smiled,
On either side the daisied green ;
The woodbine up the thorn was piled,
Just as it every spring had been.
The cottage had a happy look,
A picture meet for poet?s book;
Its yellow walls rose opposite
The way-side oak; and, round it, grew
Laburnums, half-concealing it,
With yellower bloom, from stranger?s view.
And o?er its time-touch?d thatch was seen
The blossom?d fruit-trees? richer sheen :


The tops of bee-hives shone below,
Under an ivy-cover?d shed :
And all seem?d there as long ago
?Twas pi aim?d by those who now were dead.
The lilac in its splendour gleam?d.
Along the holly-hedge which hemm?d
The garden round ; a low settee
Of neat-trimm?d boughs stood near the gate,
?Neath a young breezy aspen tree,
On which the peasant parents sate.
Though the croft?s length between them lay
And travellers who pass?d that way,
They loved to sit at sunset there,
And watch the lonely passer-by ;
And think what earthly joy or care
Might light or dim the stranger?s eye.


SONG.
On! sweet to young eyes is the moonlight of summer,
While yet they?re undimm?d by a sorrowful tear ;
When love to the bosom is but a new comer,
And the world?s thousand pathways all flow?ry
appear.
And blest is the heart?s joyous springtide of feeling,
The light of sweet thoughts then encircling the brain,
As at love?s holy shrine, in the moonlight, we?re
kneeling,
Illumines so much it ne?er brightens again !
But a cloud, which we mark?d not, obscures the pale
moonbeam,
While turn we our eyes to the wild roses near;
Still bright and unclouded again she will soon beam,
And summer?s wide landscape as lovely appear.


Not so, will the heart, when the darkness of sorrow
Hath once o?er it gather?d, be light as before;
Though the cloud of to-day seem to pass ere to-
morrow,
?Tis known, hath been felt, is a stranger no more !


LINES ON NIGHT.
O Night ! how sweet a blessing thou,
So dewy, calm, and starlight now,
Thou com?st to cool the fever?d pulse,
O?erwhelm?d the seared heart must be else.
God was most merciful in making
Day for the noisy world when waking;
And night, so full of peace, ordaining
For those who suffer uncomplaining.
How many taste of Joy?s sweet cup,
As the moon?s beauty brightens up
Above the ancient hills to-night,
Who?ll sorrow through to-morrow?s light!
How many watch?d yon world unbar
Its gates of glory, for each star
To join the sisterhood of heaven,
To whom no other joy is given !


Tis now the poet wanders forth,
To gather up the rich of earth,
And bind in bright and charmed wreaths;
Which shall defy a thousand deaths,
And bloom through ages as to-day,
Though he who wreath?d them fade away.
Tis now the melancholy swain,
Who loves?but loves, alas ! in vain?
Roams musing by the river?s side,
Till Solitude?s his chosen bride.
Tis now the broken-hearted brief
Composure mingles with his grief.
And penetrates to brighter scenes,
Though the grave?s darkness intervenes ;
And feels that he shall soon possess
Unmix?d, immortal happiness.
The captive now forgets his chain ;
Pass?d that, the tyrant?s curse is vain:?
Oh, triumph ! guilty power can never?.
Though it may bind the limb, or sever


It from the quivering trunk?controul
Th? emotions of the mighty sou] !
Yes: ?tis the Mind?s?why should we heed.
Howe?er the heart by day may bleed?
Night is the Mind?s ! to watch the moon.
Though steep?d in clouds, burst through them soon,
And still pursue her wandering,
The same mysterious, lovely thing ;
To float away in floods of thought,
Though round us prison-walls are wrought;
And bask ?mid scenes of deathless bloom,
Far, far away from strife and gloom?
These are thy treasures ever bright,
Thy glorious treasures these, O, Night!


MY BIRTH-DAY.
Tis come, and almost gone, ere I had thought
The day was more than other joyless days :
And can it be that I am really brought
O?er all this waste of time, by Misery?s ways ?
A quarter of a century ! I gaze
Upon the words I've written, with a grief
Which might atone for Pleasure?s idle blaze?
Alas! with ample bitterness, ev?n if
My path had flowery been, my sorrows few and brief.
A quarter of a century is lost:
All hath been built upon the sand to fall!
I?ve dreamt away my life at mighty cost;
Nor mine the dreams of happiness withal.
Well, Time may have his laugh out! i would call
Not ev?n the sunny moments back again ;
Remembrance holds one joy at least, nor small


Its blessed influence o?er my heart and brain?
Man never knew me stoop to seek unworthy
gam.
My birth-day! and in England there are some,
Will hail to-day with blessings for my sake.
Distrusting the felicity of home,^
Because my absence ?mid its sunshine make
An evanescent shadow, which shall wake
Many emotions of the dreamy heart.
Companions of my childhood ! angels take
Charge of your being ; though we?re torn apart,
If my fond prayers be heard, ne?er will your bosoms
smart.
Time leaves the world with a destructive speed,
Breaking young hearts before they should have
w r ept;
As such rvere wisely disinherited
Of life?s realities, one grief except.


And it may be in mercy they are swept
From earth so early, with the beautiful,
The treasured sweets which cannot here be kept,
The fragile flowers of spring which rude hands
cull,
Since mortal worth and weal seem incompatible.
But whence these musings ? My heart harden?d is
By what had happier broken it, if one
It had been, so susceptible of this
World?s crushing evils; and I struggle on.
It may come mine, when future years are gone.
Yet in beloved England to possess
A home of peace, and think of all I?ve done,
Even with a keener tranquil happiness, *
Than if I could have pass?d through life with suffering
less.
I know the vanity of hope. The same
False light may lure me on from year to year,


Which led me from my childhood till I came
O?er half the world, to be an out-cast here,
Hurl?d, worm-like, on th? Antarctic hemisphere,
Perchance, to die, cut off from man?s esteem ;
Yet turn I to this hope the oftener
For consolation, when they little deem
I, with my present lot, am happier than I seem.
May 27th, 1840.


THE SHIPWRECKED INVADERS.
? The Emperor on earth,? loud cried
The vaunters of the Invader?s ships,
e ? And God in heaven, ?no Power beside !? *
But scarce the boast burst from their lips,
When tempest smote each bark, and tore
The tall masts down, with Russia?s flags;
And hurl?d their shatter?d hulks ashore,
To perish on the pitiless crags.
Crash, crash, they strike, and back are driven,
Then wilder go against the rock ;
Now that there is a Power in heaven,
They feel, ?mid the destroying shock?
The panic of escape, the rush
To gain the thunder-shaken shore
Whelm, in the sea?s entombing crush,
Thousands who thirst for freemen?s gore !
* There are but two Powers, ?the Emperor on earth, and God
heaven!? Militant Epistles of the Russians.


The few who ?scape the grasping wave,
Who dare pollute Circassia?s strand,
Their base lives shall the patriots save ?
No, ?twould be pushing back God?s hand
In vain they flee before their foes,
The arm of vengeance strikes them down;
Such ever be the fate of those
Whose swords obey a despot?s frown !
Urge on the close pursuit, nor spare
One slave of the ? Imperial Thief;'
Hearts sold to tyranny should share
Death?s sleep, away from love and grief!
And all have fall?n.?neath freemen?s wrath,
Far strewn along the gory beach !
The tide shall clear the fisher?s path,
In its next ebb, and bury each.


TO AN OLD POCKET-BOOK,
WHICH WAS GIVEN TO THE AUTHOR, ON LEAVING ENGLAND, BY
The star which brightens through the breaking storm.
In solitary beauty, hath a charm,
For him whose eye discovers its pale speck
From off the writhing vessel?s sea-wrench?d deck,
A charm which o?er reviving sense will dart,
And almost master manhood?s resolute heart,
Recalling, with the magic of its beam?
Sudden and vivid?dreams of childhood?s dream;
The home, the very same sweet home he left,
The lights and shadows which were wont to shift
Before his eyes, years, many years ago.
When oft he wander?d in the starlight?s glow,
(Ere his lone heart the wide world?s ills had proved,)
With those who lov?d him, and were his beloved !


And, like that star, my friend?s old pocket-book,
(Though gone thy outward gloss, and worthless
Thou,)
Up-turn?d unthinkingly,?thy time-worn look
Breaks through the tempest of my bosom now;
And brings bright pictures of the past to mind,
Faces all smiles, and hearts for ever kind.
Yes ! we were happy when I first saw thee,
Both?he who had thee then in keeping, he
Who now will keep thee, as his parting gift!
But that brief season of the soul flew swift;
Both had our troubles, ere we parted,?both
Bore hearts of unmatured and withered growth
Away in heaviness ; though sun and rain,
For him, may now have brought the flowers again.
Such is my prayer and hope?that Misery
Left him with Fortune, when she follow?d me !
But oh ! the sight of thee recalls the sunny
Moments which flew, uncursed by strife for money.


TO AN ENGLISH HAWTHORN,
GROWING BESIDE SIR JOHN JAMISON?S GARDEN-FENCE, AT
RE GENTVILLE.
Methought Australia had no dear-faced thing
To woo my wilding heart from weariness,
Since even the holy sun, illumining
This beautiful Siberia,* with excess
Of light and glory, seem?d compassionless;
Methought all things which were endear?d to me,
All sanctified by Friendship?s, Love?s, caress,
Were separated by that cruel sea,
Till my eyes rested here, sweet English thorn, on
thee.
* But one foul blot e?en Sydney?s nam6 defiles.
Mars her fair coasts, and clouds her brightes' smiles:
Lo! here thy woes a mournful scene present,
England?s Siberia, Land of Banishment!
? Australasian Scenes,? by the Rev. John Adeney, B-A.


Thou strik?st my soul, and glowing thoughts rush up,
Of poet?s childhood, spent beneath thy shade;
And love?s first dream, before life?s treacherous cup.
Was drain?d unto the bitter?blushing maid,
And passionate youth,heart-bindingvowshavemade,
?Neath thy white beauty, in some English vale!
But vanish, ere my greeting I have paid.
All fancy?s pictures ; and with grief I hail
Thy presence, for thou seem?st to bring a mournful
tale.
?Tis strange my breast this gladness did assume;
For when I gaze again, sweet thorn of May !
And see thee burden?d with degenerate bloom.
Thus, in November, I could curse the day,
When wanderers brought thee o?er the waves away
From England?s primrose solitudes, to make
A changeling of thee, ?neath a fierce sun?s ray?
Torn from thy sweet associates of the brake,
By the pomegranate?s side, unnatural root to take.


THE FIRST NIGHT AT SEA
Serene and sweet the moonlight rose,*
Along the sea so lonely,
While yet the blush of day?s bright close
Died o?er wide waters only.
From out their world of mystery
The stars were softly stealing ;
And the young billows playfully
O?er Ocean?s realms were reeling.
And fair and fast, with branching spars,
And snowy canvas sweeping,
In queenly beauty, ?thwart the stars,
Our ship her course was keeping.
* Calm and sweet the moonlight rose. ?Campbell,


Ah, then the weary thinking heart,
With cold prophetic heaving,
Began to feel how large a part
Of life?s sweet things ?twas leaving!
The riches pass?d as valueless,
Where long we idly wander?d,
Now shone in distant loveliness,
As o?er the past we ponder?d.
The smiles of welcome on our way,
In life?s unclouded morning ;
The tears of parting yesterday,
Grew lovelier now returning.
And Memory brought not these alone,
We look?d back on a hundred
Springs of delight, which were our own,
Till by that parting sunder?d.


And as we gazed on all which Grief
'Yet strove Love?s chain to weave o?er,
The heart renounced its cold belief?
That we had nought to grieve o'er !
So richly the lost treasures glow,
We prized not while possessing;
We see too late so much of woe,
Which might have been a blessing !
And fair and fast our bark rode on,
Bright morning open?d o?er us;
But ?midst the light of sea and sun
A darkness roll?d before us.


THE STRANGER
Fair-pictured Sydney! how the sun?s broad
beam
Lights up thy land-lock?d, ship-pavilion?d stream !
And every day some stranger, anchoring, soars
In mazy beauty ?gainst the cloudless skies,
Midway between thy cove-indented shores,
Whose presence tells of prospering enterprise.
Oh ! ?tis a goodly sight for those who seek
A resting-place on Australasia?s strand ;
The wild bush stretching far o?er ridge and creek,
The homesteads scatter?d o?er the smiling land,
The expanse of quiet waters, and the gleam
Of the fair city in the summer beam?
Opening at once upon the pilgrim?s eyes,
Beneath th? unbroken azure of the skies.


And many a scene of cottage peacefulness,?
Which meets the wanderer?s gaze, his hopes to bless,
Where?er he turns his pleased, impatient look,
As glides his proud bark o?er the glittering
wave, ?
Peers, sweetly forth from its unbosom?d nook
Among the woods of evergreen, to have
Its beauty treasured up in Memory?s store.
And groups of happy idlers, on the shore,
Pace the bright gardens skirting yonder bay ;
Men from his native city, haply, stray
Among the loiterers there ! He now recalls
Scenes of his childhood, ?flower-hung waterfalls,
Moss-mantled rocks, and hills and valleys green,
And woods with English cottages between, ?
In his own land, alas ! so far away ;
And dreams of those, the innocent and gay,
Who in his young heart?s love had earliest place,
Shut out all other beauty.
The dim trace


Of primitive seclusion shadoweth yet
The strange old rocks, half polish?d where merf sit,
To muse awhile, and weep for absent friends,
On the frequented beach. But Albion sends
Forth her adventurers, on the hills to plant
The social banner of goodwill and love !
As still retreats the dark inhabitant
To deeper solitudes, still onward move
Th? insatiable new-comers, to possess
The inmost bosom of the wilderness.
Yet shall it be a blessed work?the giving
Of a new life unto the darkly living ;
Though mingled with all sin-born misery
The white man?s boon to the poor savage be.
Land of the stranger?s hope ! ?mid the far seas
Reserved in peace for the world?s refugees.
By raging war?s commotions undefiled;
A wilderness in grandeur only wild,
Where every social sweet of every clime
Shall yet be gathered in some after-time ;


And brotherly and heaven-directed love,
And knowledge sweet, and mercy from above,
Shall harmonise society !?here, men
Shall have forgot the name of foeman then.


STANZAS,
WRITTEN ON BOARD AN AMERICAN SHIP, ANCHORED
IN SYDNEY COVE.
Up go the beautiful and world-watch?d stars.
Lifting the glory of America,
?Mong the red flags which gleam through masts
and spars
Crowded in gay magnificence, to-day,
Where three score years ago, none found their way,
Of all the ships which left old England?s shore
Up goes the starry flag, on waves which lay
In undiscover?d solitude, when o?er
America those' stars first glanc?d from fields of gore!
In friendly beauty floats that free-fix?d flag
?Gainst England?s glowing ensign ! I could dream
Of times, when the wild bush, each uncouth crag,
And precipice, beside this haven-stream,


Shall yield to one vast city ; and the gleam
Of new-born banners shall illumine it;
And these alike be foreign in the beam
Of Australasia?s morning. Heaven admit
One patriot spirit here, and Freedom?s fires are lit!
Not ever shall the exile?s toil be all
To bring the harvest of this infant land ;
The children of the buried exile shall
Behold a mother?s beauty, in the bland
Aspect of Nature, on their native strand ;
And Freedom then shall choose a dwelling fiere.
Oh ! happy epoch, when the ? great and grand,?
The memory of whose deeds mankind revere.
Number a Washington, from the world?s Austral
sphere.


LIFE'S EARLY JOYS.
Life?s early joys ! the summer clouds,
Which hang about the moon,
Are not so beautiful as they,
And perish not so soon.
We seek the flovv?ret?s resting-place,
And deem its breath and bloom
Enough to gladden man?s estate.
Ere taught our common doom.
But when we see the spoiler sport
With the sweet lives of flowers,
We feel the heart, with trembling, wake,
Within their ruin?d bowers.


We wander in the night of snow,
?Neath winter?s thronging stars ;
And wing on blessed thoughts away
From all which misery mars.
But scarce that joy?s pure influence warms
The bosom, when the world,
In cold and gloomy pictures, back
O?er the mind?s depths is hurled.
We meet some gentle one, whose eye
Speaks of a loving heart; ,
And joy seems come, with crowning light,
Now never to depart!
Alas, the earthliness of love !
A thousand ills o?erwhelm
The spirit, ?neath her guardian?s wings,
In love?s own starry realm.


Joys pure and deep may be reserved,
Yet for life?s calm decline ;
I know not, and I dare not doubt
But such may yet be mine !


SONG OF THE AUSTRALIAN SETTLER.
Our home is in the wild bush far.
Of peaceful spots the boonest;
Where the kangaroo and emu are,
Which flee the white man soonest.
Our hearts are round our rude home knit.
In love too pure to perish ;
For a tyrant ne?er polluted it,
Nor chill?d the hopes we cherish.
Our native land, remember?d yet,
By stronger ties ne?er bound us;
For the soil with exiles? tears we?ve wet,
Which now spreads plenty round us.


Our home is where the wandering black,
And all wild things come nearest;
Where the household charms which cheer life?s
track,
And human ties are dearest.
Our bev?rage the clear stream supplies,
Which down the mountain dashes ;
And the wheaten damper well we prize,
Fresh from the white warm ashes.
We sleep on beds of sweetest straw,
? Th? opossum cloak thrown o?er us ;
And a happier hearth glad eyes ne?er saw
Than nightly glows before us.


THE SEA-BOY.
Poor little orphan ! thou dost go,
Seeming with heart at ease?
Rejoicing ev?n because ?tis so, ?
To trust the treacherous seas.
And thou hast paced that high ship?s deck,
Jn foreign climes, ere now;
And forth thou go?st again, to seek
Lands ?neath th? Equator?s glow.
Ihou st seen that good ship?s prow divide
Old Ganges? sacred stream ;
By island shores hast watch?d her glide,
Where conch and coral gleam :
Calcutta?s streets of palaces
Thou?st wander?d through, alone;
And, ?neath Sumatra?s spice-fraught trees,
Dreamt of the dear hearts gone.


From summer isles afar thou?st brought.
Bright shells and fine-wrought toys,
Not deeming then such things were nought,
With none to share thy joys.
And oft with happy thoughts of home
Thy little heart would burn?
Thou hadst forgot no friend would come.
To welcome thy return.
Alas, poor boy ! a bitter fate,
In childhood?s bloom is thine ;
Though wealth and honour elevate
Thy fortunes, thou?lt repine.
For culture ne?er illumed thy mind,
Life?s sweets with thee were brief:
Thou ow?st to strangers ev?n each kind
Word whispered ?mid thy grief.


TO A LADY WEEPING.
Alas ! to hope that mortal worth
Should ?scape unscath?d were vain;
The snow-flake, when it touches earth,
Must melt with earthly stain.
Though pure the fount of feeling be,
Within thy gentle breast ?
That will not awe malignity
From poisoning thy heart?s rest.
Yet, keeping Virtue?s narrow path,
In righteousness erect,
Thou need?st not fear the fool?s blind wrath,
Nor heed the world?s neglect.


I would not ask thee not to mourn
O?er calumny and wrong;
But think how soon should Peace return,
In conscious virtue strong!


VERSES,
WRITTEN IN A SMALL VOLUME, ENTITLED ?REMEMBER ME,?
GIVEN TO C. V,
? Remember me ! ? Affection asks,
Whate?er my fate, where?er I be,
Though chain?d to drudgery?s meanest tasks,
Still asks thee to remember me.
Remember me ! ? Oh ! by love?s faith,
By sorrows shared, alas, with thee ,
By truth, by all which conscience saith
Of our own hearts, remember me.


THE CONVICT?S REFLECTIONS
AT SEA.
How hush?d this lovely night! no sound
Of mortal agency,
Save only the ship?s gentle bound,
Disquieting the sea.
Falls on the heart?a solitude,
In which all nature seems subdued.
And yet a joy, to Nature true,
Touching the heart with pain.
Wakes ?mid the lonely waters blue ;
And feelings come again,
Which made the light on childhood?s brow?
And come at Sorrow?s bidding now!


Who ever look?d in love to heaven,
So starry and so still,
And felt not then that hallowing leaven,
Above all sense of ill,
Which joy hath mingled in life?s cup,
To the surface, sparkling, gladdening, up ?
Man?s better nature must have scope,
In solitude like this;
And dreamings will have birth from hope,
Of untouch?d stores of bliss?
Despite the ruin of the past?
But all too beautiful to last.
Ah, me ! on my poor wounded heart
The softening influence falls,
T? admit still deeper Sorrow?s smart;
Each beauty but recalls
The pictures fair, which pass?d away,
Beneath my grasp, in life?s young day.


The breeze springs up, the white sails dip
Into the shadowy night;
And gallant rides the convict-ship,
Exulting in her bright
And billowy track?with her go forth
Sin?s exiles, to the ends of earth !
A year ago, fond hearts there were,
Whose breaking this had been !
1 bless thee. Death, for taking her,
Who bore me, ere she?d seen
The evil of my heart, or deem?d
My spirit darker than it seem?d.
I go unto that Southern land,
Where mourns remorseful crime.
In penal misery, ?mid the bland
Luxuriance of the clime;
?Mid scenes of Nature?s fairest bloom,
Making a deep, unnatural gloom.


I go unwept,?for Mercy?s sake,
So much of ill I?ve dared,
And aught of good, which might re-wake
Man?s love so little shared !
I go, without a wish to avert
My doom, yet would myself desert.
This solitariness of grief,
In Retribution?s hour,
To withering guilt is some relief, ?
It leaves not man the power
To mark the change, nor link remaining,
Of the chain broken, worth regaining.
Farewell! a word I might unsay,
Since human heart heeds not
Its utterance, as I pass away;
Mine is the Felon?s lot!
Yet Childhood?s home, farewell, farewell!
Though ?midst thy smiles the stranger dwell.


THE CONVICT?S GRAVE.
In that far clime which England made her prison,
Soon as she took it fresh from Nature?s hand,
Where yet the sun of Freedom ne?er hath risen.
Nor peace-crown?d Knowledge shed her influence
bland ;
There, ?mid the forests of that prison-land,
Beside a gloomy river, is a grave,
O er which shall Grief erect no statue grand,
Nor mourner?s mantle in the moonlight wave;
Yet Australasia?s tombs no nobler tenant have.
And those brave limbs the felon?s fetters wore,
Though ?twas a glorious heart which them sus
tain?d,
Ev?n by its adverse fate ennobled more
Than if in peace it had unscath?d remain?d ;


And he, with lofty character unstain?d,
Was banish?d from his home of sweet content,
Because he loved his country, and had train?d
Th' expansive growth of that high sentiment
To cling round Freedom?s feet, immovable, un-
bent !
The desert?s depth received him as the vile ;
Th? inhuman task, the brutal torture, came; ,
Still weeps he not where tyrants dare not
smile,
Invincible in soul, though crush?d in frame?
Through all his desperate calmness is the same!
He thought of home, but he could bear to think ;
He felt his doom was seal'd, but Freedom?s
flame
Glow?d in th? o?er-burden?d heart which would not
sink,
As if such breast could ev?n out-wear Oppression?s
link.


To lift the maul, to excavate the rock.
With penal irons pinching the weak limb ;
To eat the bread which seem?d as given to mock
The wants of Nature, among murderers grim;?
This was the punishment awarded him,
To tame his insubordinate soul, they said :
And, when the light within his eyes grew dim,
They coldly deem?d his pride of spirit fled ;
Nor question?d of the change, till one excjaim?d
? He?s dead ! ?
Oh ! tis most merciful the worn heart breaks,
To liberate the soul, and baffle crime:
This, surely, was ordain?d for exiles? sakes,
Who droop and wither in a foreign clime !
Nor this the first, nor the first hundredth time,
The convict in Australia so hath ended
\
A life, despite surrounding ills, sublime
In truth and fortitude, ?unwept, unfriended,
This sad tale is but one might be with many blended


But yesterday they flogg?d him at the tree,
And deem?d he suffer?d lightly ?neath the lash ;
To-day they bury him as heartlessly,
And on his corse the cold earth rudely dash.
Tis night again, and the broad lightning?s flash,
With a wild loveliness, plays o?er his grave;
And breaks the tempest, with terrific crash,
Through the dark forest; but the storm may rave,
The dead would sleep, though it tore up the dead
man?s cave !
The parrots cull the stringy bark?s young blossom,
There, on bright-painted wings, through summer?s
day;
And in the moon-lit gum-tree freaks th? opftssum.
O?er that lone sepulchre, in nightly play : .
But no true heart shall Nature?s tribute pay,
The melancholy spot to consecrate.
Long years, to swell Griefs sum, shall roll away,
Ere man?s commotion change its rugged state;
Or make it social seem, or mark it desolate !


And young blue eyes, ?mid Erin?s bloomless bowers,
With tears of mourning for his sake, grow dim ;
One heart, which feasted on the breath of flowers,
And drank the wild bird?s melody, with him,
When, if aught ruffled joy, ?twas but some whim
Of love?s first fondness?one adoring heart
Is still all his, and, ev?n were seraphim
To woo it from his memory, would not part!
O, Woman, in thy love, how wonderful thou art!


THE LOST SHIP.
A beautiful ship o?er the waters career?d,
(For a port in the East the bold mariners steer?d,)
And queen-like she stood in the sun?s dying light;
But she struck on a reef and went down in the night.
A.storm gather?d fast as the darkness set in,
And the ocean grew wroth as a thing that felt sin ;
Not a star its mild light through the stormy night
shed,
And the waves and the winds seem?d to mingle o?er
head.
Majestic the beautiful ship met the storm,
But her fate on that reef was prepared by the worm !
In the dead of the night she was riven asunder,
With a shock more terrific and wild than the thunder.


There were friends in the hulk as her timbers were
starting-.
But they felt not a pang of affection in parting;
For the grasp of the tempest o?erpower?d them in-
stead,
Like the pressing of Death to the infidel?s bed !
And those suppliant eyes, when they thought to meet
Heaven,
In the gulf of the sea by a demon were driven ;
And the horrible shriek which went up in despair,
In the howl of the wind died away on the air!
There are hearts far away that shall sorrow in vain,
Long hoping, but ah ! they will come not again ;
Nor a rover of all who return shall unfold
The tale which those fond hearts so throb to hear
told !


THE SOLITUDE OF SORROW,
A FRAGMENT.
Sorrow, is not that her name.
Who hath got so sad a fame ?
Barry Cornwall.
How lonely is the heart of sorrow, when
Glad eyes are glancing, joyous words be spoken,
And happiness is smiling round?ah ! then,
Then only doth it feel as really broken !
In misery?s wilder moments, when the token
Of truth was torn from the confiding breast,
Sudden and violate, ?the very stroke on
Life?s shrinking hopes, which left love so unble?st,
Madden?d like rapture to this dying of all rest!
The revel now is done, the mirth has ceased,
And sleep has hush?d the music of the heart;


Pale sorrow now steals forth, to an increased
Range of existence ; she has borne her part
In happy seeming, none suspecting art
Moulded those smiles?but it was much to bear!
.And tears, crush?d passion?s unseen tears, must
From their too long concealment, or they?d wear
The heart too much t? insure their after safety there !
Then comes that gentle melancholy, shaping
Some dream of hope, which is so all a dream !
Alas ! yet in such vision?s light escaping
From earth, th? enthusiast lives within its beam.
That changeful structure of wild thoughts doth
seem
To shift from scene to scene of purer sweetness;
And Sorrow?s eye grows bright, and she would
deem
The bitterness all gone with time?s cold fleetness,
Lost in th? unfoldings of the soul?s divine completeness


These dreams of heaven are beautiful, beyond
All beauty in this world ; for they re-tune
The shatter?d heart to hopes which ne?er respond
To an inferior influence; and a boon
And freshening shower they shed in life?s hot noon,
Which nothing earthlier would bestow ! Tis sweet
To sit in sorrow?s bower, and watch the moon
Raining her light through the green boughs which
meet
In midnight?s calm above, till we such visions greet!


TO MY DAUGHTER,
AGED TWO YEARS, JULY 23, 1841.
But thou, should Heaven thy life prolong,
May?st value ev?n this rugged song.
Percy Rolle.
The billows of the huge Pacific,
The mystic winds with music wild,
Thy yearning mother?s beatific
And anxious prayer, were all, my child.
To welcome thee to life?
A sunbeam ?mid the tempest?s strife!
Thy earliest infancy was cherish?d
?Mid all the woe the friendless feel
In a strange land, and almost perish?d,
Sickening, howe?er we strove to heal
Thy bosom?s wounds the while :
Yet would?st thou sweetly learn to smile.


And thy blue eyes grew bright and beaming,
And well thou ever answeredest
Our looks of love, even in thy dreaming,?
For then thou seem?dst so very blest,
That oft we could not cease
To watch such loveliness and peace !
This last sad stroke of withering sickness
Has not bedimm?d those bright blue eyes;
Still hast thou lejft th? unconscious meekness
Of sinless love; a beauty lies
Even in thy moaning sleep,
Yet for the spoiler?s power too deep.
I will not, dare not, think to lose thee !
My love, for thy dear mother?s sake,
Could scarcely bear thy God should choose thee,
And from us now our darling take ;
So dost thou seem our own,
Art to our hearts so closely grown !


Yet will I hope long years of gladness
The deep-veil?d future holds for thee,
All separate from whate?er of sadness
Or evil be reserved for me.
Thy love, if happy still,
Would be a balm for every ill.
I hail again thy natal morning,
And, though to-day I see thee not,
She who doth watch thy spirit?s dawning
Will leave no kiss of mine forgot.
Thou will not want my love.
My nestling, with thy parent dove !
If Heaven accord thy father?s blessing,?
Who, grateful for these two brief years
Thy mingled smiles and tears possessing,
Yet would some angel dry those tears?
Then listening Health has smiled,
And seeks my blue-eyed ocean-child !


UNHAPPY LOVE.
Since I beheld my Helen last,
I?ve known but misery ;
Nor day nor night since then hath pass?d,
Without a prayer for thee!
A pilgrim long, in every zone,
I?ve sought the shrine of Peace ;
And bade my heart, in reason?s tone,
Its constant murmurings cease.
I?ve ? cross?d earth?s central line,? and dwelt
In oriental lands,
Where wealth and honour have been dealt
Into my willing hands.


I?ve wander?d where the Southern Cross
Glows o?er th? Antipodes;
Far following the lone albatross
O?er isle-besprinkled seas.
But never, ?midst Antarctic storms,
When Ocean?s wrath was swelling,
Or ?mid th? Equator?s burning calms,
Have I forgot my Helen !
And time shall leave thy beauty 's trace
Still fresh in memory;
Though Scotia?s hills, or Helen?s face,
I never more may see!


FRAGMENT.
Who in a stormy night has look?d out long
On the surrounding darkness, held by thought
Of some heart-wringing grief, or horrible wrong,
Which out of agony awful calm had wrought
Within life?s tranced depths ; he knows how gladly
The blackest shades of midnight then were sought,
As most congenial. And who pines most sadly
In poverty?s cold gloom, will ever seek
Remotest haunts of sorrow, where least madly
The world rejoices at his tear-dimm?d cheek.
How beautiful that virtue in the poor,
Which meets grim misery resolutely meek ;


Not turning evil against the evil-doer,
But winning to the light of good alway
Him, whose blind wrath to his discomfiture
Is turn?d by Providence, as day by day
It pleads love?s cause before the world, by acts
Speaking more eloquently than words e?er may !
Like moonlight calm on mountain cataracts,
That makes ev?n terror lovely, human love
Irradiates this world?s wild and barren tracts,
Clothing the waste in smiles; but not above
The force of ill are all who strive ?gainst evil?
And ever they were few who strongly strove.
Still Fraud and her foul progeny shall revel
?Mong desolate hearts, defying love?s mild power,
And crushing man to misery?s hopeless level.


The dews of heaven are constant to the flower
That blossoms in the desert?s solitude,
Though tempest ravage its sequester?d bower ;
And shall not Peace abide, to cheer the good
In their misfortunes??yes, sweet triumph crowns
The true, who every trial have withstood ;
Ancf Wisdom them in Fame?s bright presence owns,
As her ethereal children ; Liberty
Smiles, with such heroes? at the oppressor?s frowns.
And I would weave a wreath?if it might be
Permitted, or such glory needed more
To embalm it than the love of?all hearts free
From guilt and superstition?l would pour
My spirit?s veneration in my verse,
.For him who stands by Truth, though scorn?d and
poor.


REMORSE.
Oh ! teach me to forget the home,
The blessed home that once was mine,
Ere thou, vain triffler ! bidd?st me come,
A slave, the worst of slaves, to thine.
Nor this as guilt?s perverseness blame,
Although my bitter choice be still
To reap the harvest of my shame,
A self-abandoned thing of ill.
To live in sin, untask?d to smile
On all its hateful misery,
Is better sure than contract vile,
To serve a heartless wretch like thee !


I would not it should seem that one,
So low, so lost as I am now,
Could rest ?mid ruin?s dark work done,
Nor feel the serpent on my brow.
Go, breathe thy words in empty air;
Believe not woman?s shuddering soul,
Still goaded on by crime?s despair,
E?er sought in vice a happy gaol!


A PLOUGHMAN?S TALE.
? So, you have robb?d the pretty birds, my child !?
He said, and half-upbraidingly he smiled.
? And I have done the same,? continued he,
? When an uncaring, thoughtless boy like thee ;
But our own house, the birth-place of my sire,
One summer evening was destroy?d by fire;
All in it perish?d, ev?n our dog and cat.
And I ne?er touch?d a bird?s nest after that.
Some little robins then I?d idly brought
Home for my younger brother, as I thought;
But ah ! I found the cottage all in flames,
v *
And burnt to death our darling little James.
A frantic father?s hand had snatch?d him out
From the wild flames, which clung his corpse about;
But all too late?l saw him lifeless lie,
So changed in seeming to my tear-dimm?d eye.


As on his fire-disfigured face I gazed,
That oft since then I?ve thought my brain was crazed!
My father seem?d to hug his desperate grief,
Shut in himself, and shrink from all relief.
I saw him the next morning, when the sun
In through our neighbour?s window early shone,
Shed bitter tears upon his borrow?d bed.
The first, the last, I ever saw him shed.
But when his friends would strive to comfort him,
His eyes, though tearless, grew so coldly dim,
A stranger would have said, nor err?d the while,
Those weary eyes again could never smile.
Methinks I see him yet beside the grave,
When back to earth the coffin?d dust they gave,
Raise his lorn eyes from off his infant?s bed,*
As if his misery then was perfected.
He lived not long, a fatal fixedness
Of sorrow wore his heart away in less
Than one short year; and I, alas ! could not
Contribute aught to lighten his sad lot.


His faithful heart so loved my little brother,
Because his life cost that of our dear mother.
And she had charged him, the last words she said,
To love her child for her when she was dead.?
I know not why that cottager so old,
To one so young as I his story told:
Perchance, the throstle?s nest, which caught his eye,
And caused his first remark, so powerfully
Struck on remembrance, that he said the rest,
Scarce knowing whom he in such words address?d.
I well remember, as he turn?d from me,
I felt no easy shame myself to see,
With the poor plunder in my half-spoil?d hat;
I, too, ne?er touch?d a bird?s nest after that.


THE BROTHER?S BLESSING,
WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF T. S.
Sister ! seas have rolled between us,
Ofttimes when I?ve thought of thee :
But where?er God?s eye hath seen us,
I a sister?s smile could see.
Fortune early fix?d thy brother?s
Pathway o?er the ocean?s wave?
Tis a lot among all others.
Haply, he would soonest have !
Still a brother?s pure affection,
Breathing peace o?er passion?s wilds,
Though it ?scape the world?s detection,
Melts my stray?d heart as a child?s.


Thou hast loved me scarcely fonder
Than my heart hath clung to thee?
Thou, whose love some fairy wonder
Of romance hath seem?d to me !
Oft the balmy thought would pillow
Peace within my troubled breast,
When I stemm?d the stormy billow?
In thy prayers my fate was blest!
Sister dear ! to-day I meet thee,
In a strange and beauteous clime ;
With a brother?s blessing greet thee,
At a holy, happy time.
Thou art given to love?s dominion,
Thou wilt be a bride to-day !
Oh ! may time?s too restless pinion
Slowly sweep thy dreams away.


Yet my heart will turn from gladness
Back to scenes of earlier hours ;
Glimpse of childhood?s joy or sadness
Comes like needed summer showers.
Childhood?s beautiful complexion,
Every tone and soul-fraught look,
Light and shade, in retrospection,
Yet I read as in a book.
Days we spent ere sorrow?s thwartings,
Sports we shared, and hopes we nurst
Come again; and sad sweet partings,?
And glad meetings, ?since our first.
Nor ill-tim?d, ev?n ?mid the real
Sunshine melting o?er my heart.
Deem these musings, and ideal
Bursts of light on memory?s chart.


When I think of all I?ve known thee
Meek, affectionate, sincere,
Well a brother?s heart may ?throne thee
In its love, divinely dear !
Peace be thine ! may children beauteous
Spring like flowers around love?s scene,
Unto thee as kind and duteous
As in filial love thou?st been.
Fortune ever smile auspicious,
Sister dear! on thine and thee ;
Life a flowing-on delicious
Toward a bright eternity !


OPOSSUM SHOOTING.
The moon was ris?n with an unclouded brightness
In the blue midnight sky ; her thrilling lightness
Kindled the heart to gladder feelings even
Than gush?d in our first out-door glance at heaven,
When leaving the lone huts: and we stood listening
?Neath an old gum-tree, till we saw a glistening
Outline of fur, upon the topmost bough
Of a still older neighbouring tree; and now
It moved in beautiful and mark?d relief
?Gainst the white moon, and that distinctness brief
Show?d full the opossum?s profile. Instantly
The ready gun was raised, and, flashing free,
Fired in the moon?s pale face: the wounded creature,
A moment, in the agonies of nature,
Held by its clasping tail, with struggling form
Impendent ?midst encircling boughs ; then, warm


With life, but lifeless, fell at the tree?s base.
And is there pleasure found in idle chase
Of a poor beast?s unhurtful, happy life,
To overcome repugnance to such strife
With animate peace and gentleness? Or hath
The love of wandering where no common path
Is track?d for man, among th? uncultured glories
And haunts of Nature, ?such as in their stories
Poets delight to paint,?so deep a power
Within men?s hearts, as to invest this hour,
And these still gorgeous wilds, with spells that bind
Humanity, to its great purpose blind ?


MY NATIVE LAND
The moonlight of a milder clime
Is round me pour?d o?er scenes sublime
But I would fly from all earth?s light
And grandeur, to behold to-night
My native land !
To-morrow?s sun will beauteous rise
In Australasia?s summer skies :
But more than beautiful to me
Would winter?s wildest morning be,
In that dear land !
And green woods wave which ne?er are sere '
In this December summer here :
But I would turn from Eden?s bloom.
To hail, in winter?s waste and gloom,
My native land !


It may be here that Britons find
Scenes brighter than they leave behind :
But oh ! the counter-charm for home
Is found not yet, where?er I roam
O?er sea or land.


PORT
BOATS ON THE WATERS OF
JACKSON.
Happy I watch the wandering boats,
That distant dot the sun-lit sea;
While on the breeze sweet music floats ?
A strain from yon light skiff you see,
With the green bough up-lifted for
A sail, in ?gainst the windward shore.
I think how many beating hearts.
So late benumb?d by worldly care,
As joy to life and freedom starts,
To-day God?s gifts of beauty share !
And Sunday sweeter is to me,
Because it sets the labourer free.


And there are those would wrench this treasure
From the mechanic?s feeble hold ;
Tis sin to-day to think of pleasure,
On week days, idleness, he?s told,
Can it be envy of the poor
Which thus would guard the cottage door ?
?Tis pity the benignant powers,
Who study poor men?s interests thus,
Can?t veil from vulgar eyes earth?s flowers,
For fear we wax idolatrous.
In loving Nature?s stainless things,
Without their wisdom?s leading-strings.
Yes ! well I love to watch those boats,
With snowy sails, careering on ;
My heart responds to thy wild notes,
Thou lifer, seated in the sun,
Beneath thy sail of bright green leaves,
Whose skiff the ripple homeward heaves.


See, gliding gracefully before
The breeze, a sylph-like vessel comes !
And shall the stirred heart not adore
The Great One there as in men?s homes ?
Behold the blessed group within
That boat, and talk no more of sin !
The father clasps his joyous child,
Unsummoned by the work-bell?s peal
From love that now hath reconciled
Him almost to the world?s unweal;
The mother, with glad heart, as well,
Is in that little fragile shell.
Oh! feelings that ne?er last too long,
And sympathies too sure to cool
In mingling with the selfish throng,
Whose creed is learnt in Fortune?s school,
Hallow that household?s hour of joy?
Won pure from world-diffused alloy.


Yon wanderer with the gleamy sail,
So full of smiling, youthful faces.
Though vanity may there prevail,
Bears, haply, nature?s sunny traces
Of good received?soul-gladdening good,
In gentlest philosophic mood.
Perchance there breathes some poor exile
Within that loitering skiff, below
Yon melancholy prison-isle,
Whose withered heart forgets its woe;
His childhood?s home, and kindred?s graves,
While basking ?mid those sunny waves.
I love all ways of innocence,
To seize on joy?s evasive form ;
And I love every excellence
Of mind and heart that braves the storm
Of evil, ?mid the clouds of ill
Appearing like the rainbow still.


To seek for happiness, in seeing
God?s wondrous works, is surely not
T? endanger moral truth?s well-being,
Or fair Religion?s lustre blot.
Say not the lowly desecrate
The Sabbath in subduing fate.


SONG.
In sadness of soul thou hast mourn?d, O, my mother!
O?er the memory of friends who remain in that land,
Where grow the sweet flowers on the grave of my
brother,
That were planted, thou say?st, by my grandfather?s
hand.
And oft have I sigh?d for their love, who will never
Know more than the name of your Mary to love;
Though fancy has failed in each childish endeavour
To picture their forms as in life they still move.
Yet mourn not in solitude now, dearest mother;
The gay-coated parrots are winging about;
All happy, ?twould seem, in the joy of each other;
And the sun-loving lizards are everywhere out.


Oh ! cheer thee to-day; let us roam by the river,
And, startling the swans from its wild, bowery
banks,.
See their shadows evolve, as its waves break and
quiver,
?Neath the cedars still standing in time-hr.nour?d
ranks.
Then tell me some story of England, sweet mother.
As we rest ?mong the flowers; or, if sorrowful still,
In this world?s fairest light we will dream of another,
Whose blossoms no tempest may scatter or kill.


STANZAS.
Oh, beautiful is life in this fair world !
But woe and weariness entwine their growth
With the heart?s fibres, and a gloom is hurled
O?er earth and heaven ; enduring nature doth
Shrink ?neath sin?s tyranny, and a vile sloth
Of mind chains man from sight of God?s best
things:
Yet o?er the Christian?s lot eternal truth
Shall shed a glory from her shielding wings,
And light the prayerful heart to love?s sweet prac-
ticings.
Oh, beautiful is life ! but who would hold
This life for ever, with its sum less sorrows ?
Who lose the mournful hope of growing old
In that meek dignity of soul, which borrows


From where all is pure day?no nights nor mor-
May bring a tear ?a beauty bright and new,
To clothe the cheek which misery?s tear-drop fur-
rows ?
Who turn his burning brow from death?s cold dew,
And feel not sin has done all it shall ever do ?


STANZAS,
ON HEARING, IN SYDNEY COVE, THE BAND OF THE
TWENTY-EIGHTH REGIMENT, PLAYING ?SWEET HOME,? ON THE
EVE OF THEIR DEPARTURE FOR BOMBAY, JUNE 18, 184' J.
? Home, home, sweet home!? I never heard
That sweet, sad truthful strain,
But Memory, with its music, stirred
Anew my heart and brain ;
And scenes, where life?s first hopes were cast,
Flowers faded long- ago, joys past,
Were pictured o?er again.
Ah ! now it hath another charm,
That strain so full of home.
On the still sea, ?of hardship, harm.
Certain and soon to come.
And years of exile doth it tell;
And, where no friend may breathe farewell,
A dreary death for some !


Brave hearts beat to that homely tune,
In yonder ships to-night,
\
Beneath Australia?s winter moon ;
Who, with the morning?s light,
Set sail for India?s scenes of strife,
T? assert, at lavish cost of life,
Old England?s sovereign might.
Yet, bravest he, the soldier?s heart
How must remembrance thrill, ?
Though not a tear to light may start,
So school?d in resolute will, ?
When hears he that familiar strain,
In foreign lands, and sighs in vain
For end to human ill! *


SONNET.
Escaped from shipwreck, on a South Sea isle,
Where grew the bread-tree, a poor Briton dwelt;
Living on pity which the savage felt,
And hope which pictured still his loved one?s smile.
A chief-boy chanc?d that pale one first to meet,
Who brought him food prepared from choicest fruits;
And led him forth to fountains cool and sweet,
And show?d him all the islesmen?s rude pursuits.
He grew half happy with his uncouth friends, ?
For many friends ?mong the dusk tribes he won :
And still some gentle boy his wants attends,
Seeking for him all treasures of the sun.
Years rolled away even so: yet would he weep
Wildly for his lost love beyond the stormy deep.


SONNET.
When you arrive at Sydney, sailing up
The harbour, a small central isle you?ll see ;
With two or three low huts, but not a tree,
Nor blade of grass,?upon?t; and, on the top,
A score of men, in coarse habiliments,
Hewing the rock away. You may remember,
Among the many evil-traced events
Of a town life, some robbery, when December
Brought on the long, dark nights?a neighbour?s boy
Tried for?t, and banished. He, perchance, is one,
Who yonder lift the pickaxe in the sun
To level Pinchgut Island ! If e?er joy
Gladden?d your heart on England?s shore, oh ! never
Forget that Englishmen are banished here for ever.


SONNET,
A MIDNIGHT SCENE.
Remote within the moonlight there was moored
A ship, whose shadow dash?d the shining deep ;
Else all serenely bright, and unobscured
By shade of wandering cloud, the waters sleep.
Adown the various bays no visible speck,
Not even a distant oar?s phosphoric dip,
Ruffled the field of lustre round that ship :
The lighthouse, pouring o?er her lofty deck
Its streamy blaze, revolving, seem?d alone
A thing of wakefulness. My view took in
No stir along the shore, to shake repose
From the hush?d heart, or press a human groan
From sensitive nature, ?neath remember?d sin,
And suffering in this wilderness of woes.


SONNET,
TO CHRISTMAS, 1841.
Hail, Christmas, with thy harvest of gold sheaves !
Yet do I miss the winter icicle,
Bristling with crystal spears the cottage eaves :
The snow?s appearances innumerable,
With strange and radiant beauty clothing each
Familiar object out of doors ; the sound
Of carol-singers, nightly coming round ;
The stock of Christmas comforts within reach
Of th? English peasant. These, and more I miss ;
But not ungrateful, whate?er fortune prove,
For the old English Christmas, with its kiss
Beneath the missletoe, its toast and ale,
And heart-reviving warmth of social love,
With joy I this Australian Christmas hail!


SONNET,
TO JOHN BATTY, ESQ.
Soon thou return?st to England ! and thy heart
Glows at the sound of that far-honour?d name;
Yet stronger ties than those of country bind
Thee to that land, all Briton though thou art:
Sweet thoughts come with the national thrill of fame
Of home and loved ones left so far behind.
And I, but thou wouldst chide, could shed sad tears
At thy departure, though I dream we yet
Shall meet again, and talk in after-years
How chanc?d it first in a strange land we met.
Thou goest, and peace attend thy steps, be thine
A quick and tranquil journey o?er the deep ;
I grieve not for thy going, but I weep,
Because thy kindly heart is torn from mine.
Sydney, 22nd April, 1842.


SONNET.
Who would not be a poet ?to seclude
Himself in a bright, starry solitude,
Away from earthly wretchedness at will;
W here no unlovely thing might present be,
To dim the light of idealty,
And Nature?s glories might surround him still ?
Who would not be a poet ?to be blest
With the rich thoughts which they in words have
drest;
To feel the fire of their undying hopes,
To see all beauty with their gifted sight,
To hang o?er Byron?s, Campbell?s, Milton?s, Pope?s,
And Spencer?s page, with their divine delight ?
Who would not even a poet?s woes possess,
To inherit that wild power which beautifies distress ?
