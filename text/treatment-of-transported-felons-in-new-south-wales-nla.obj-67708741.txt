A mortal fever prevailed on board a ship at sea, and a
negro man was appointed to throw the bodies of those
who died from time to time overboard. One day, when
the captain was on deck, he saw the negro dragging
out ofthe forecastle a sick man, who was struggling
violently to extricate himself from the negro s grasp,
and remonstrating bitterly against the cruelty of hem?
buried alive. � What are you going to do with that

Accident. ?Wedntsday evening an inquest was
held at the Crown, Montague-close, Town Hall, Bo-
rough, before 31 r. Newman, and Mr. Holmes, the
High Bailiff, on the body of Henry Wilkins, aged 20,
a coal-filler, in the employ of Messrs. Thrupp, coal-
merchants, of Montague-close. Mr. Benjamin Thrupp
deposed, that on Saturday evening last the deceased
was employed, with some ether persons, unloading a
barge of corn lying in the Thames, when a sack full,
upwards of 200 weight, was hoisted upon his shoulder ;
he was about to leave the barge, when his foot slipped,
and be fell, together with his load, into the water.
An alarm was instantly made, but the tide carried him
away, and he was seen struggling upwards of five mi-
nutes in the water, when he sunk to rise no more.
Several watermen at length came and made to his
assistance, and in an hour and a half his body was
picked up in a lifeless state, and brought t@ the above
house. The deceased was a sober and industrious man,
and has left a wife and family to lament his loss. Ver-
dict?Accidental Death.
Fatal Accident A melancholy accident took
place on Friday last, about two o?clock, in the Lion-
vard, Canterbury. It appears that a man named
Kingsford, horse-keeper to one of the Ramsgate
coaches, was engaged harnessing a horse in the above
yard, when it suddenly fell to kicking, and struck the
poor man in the stomach, knocking him some distance.
Persons immediately hastened to the spot, and he was
assisted home. A medical gentleman was soon in at-
tendance, who pronounced him to be in a dangerous
situation, a rupture haring taken place. The unfor.
tunate man lay in the greatest agony till the next
morning, when the surgeons urging the necessity of a
warm bath, he was taken to the Canterbury Hospital,
and every attention paid to his case that skill and hu.
manity could devise. However, we regret to say', he
gradually grew worse, and at ten o?clock on Saturday
evening, expired in the greatest agony. He was 39
years of age, and has left an afflicted widow and four
children, with the prospect of another being soon
added to the number. Au inquest was held on the
body when a verdict of Accidental Death was re-
turned Maidstone Journal.
Wednesday an inquisition was taken before T.Higgs,
Esq., at the Light Horseman, Orange-oourt, Leicester-
square, on the body of Geo. Gardner, aged 32.?John
West, a coal-porter, stated that the deceased had lately
come into some property. Between eleven and twelve
o?clock on Monday, witness was standing near the
arched entrance to Great-Scotland-yard, when deceased
came up, apparently in good health, and said ? John,
how are you f ? and almost in au instant fell backwards
and expired.?John Warren, of No. H, Smith?s-conrt,
Windmill-street, a relation of the deceased, stated that
he enjoved excellent health, and was not subject to fits.
He took an early breakfast on Monday morning, and
went out afterwards for a walk.?Mr. Gell, a surgeon,
was of opinion that the death of the deceased was
caused by a fit of serious apoplexy. Verdict?Died by
the visitation of God.
Tuesday evening an accident happened to the vehi-
cle lately started by Mr. Shillibeer, which was likely
to have been attended with very serious consequences.
The omnibus was driving through the Old Jewry, on
its wav from Paddington to the Bank, with about 15
passengers inside it, when it fairly broke down, and the
persons inside were thrown into each other?s arms in
the most familiar manner possible. The greatest alarm
prevailed for some time lest the concussion should have
done serious injury to the passengers, many of whom
were females, but they were all got out, ? mere fright-
ened than hurt.? A long time elapsed before the omni-
bus was set right, and the bid Jewry was completely
blocked up, owing to the great size of the vehicle. The
Paddington coachman rejoiced much when they heard
of the accident. .
On Sunday evening, between the hours of six and
eight o?clock, while Mr. Gdodger, of 33, Join).street.
Edgeware-road, and his wife, were gone to church, his
house was broken open, and robbed of every thing that
was moveable; and the thieves, thinking they were de-
tected, made of, leaving behind them a crow-bar, a
phosphorus box, and some skeleton-keys.
On the conclusion of this service, he was employed
under Lieutenant General Maitland, on the coast of
France, and in January, 1800, sailed for Quiberou Bay.
In February he returned to England to take out troops
for an attack upon Belleisle, and soon after sailed
with the 36th Foot from Cork, to take possession
of Houat, as a preparatory step ; this service, however,
was laid aside, and he returned home in July, with
desoatches.
In 1801, Lieut. Colonel Nightingall was appointed
Assistant Quarter Master General to the eastern dis-
trict, in which situation he continued till the peace,
when he accompanied the Marquis Cornwallis to
Amiens as secretary ; shortly after his return from
France, he w r as appointed Quarter-Master-General to
the King?s troops in India, and sailed by the first op-
portunity to Bengal.
On his arrival the army under Lord Lake had
taken the field against the Mahrattas ; he joined im-
mediately, and was at head-quarters previous to the
attack on Agra ; he was present at the attack of a body
of infantry posted under the walls of the latter place,
and at the sieg-� and capture of the fortress; he was
afterwards at the general and decisive action at Lase-
varrie, and continued to serve with the army in the
field, until the conclusion of the peace with Scindeah.
He was appointed in 1805 Military Secretary to the
Marquis Cornwallis; and on his lordship?s death he
remained in Bengal, in the office of Quarter
Master-General, until February, 1807, when his
health being much impaired, he returned to England,
and soon after resigned his staff situation. In July,
1802, this officer was appointed to a Lieutenant Co-
lonelcy in the 51st Foot, from which he was removed,
on the Bth of May, 1806 to the 69th regiment. He
received, on the 25th of September, 1803, the rank
of Colonel in the army.
Within four months after his arrival in England,
Colonel Nightingall was appointed to serve as Bri-
gadier General, with the forces under Major General
Spencer, with whom he proceeded to Gibraltar, and was
employed on the coast of Spain under his orders, until
his division joined the army under Sir A. Wellesley at
Mondego Bay, when Brigadier General Nightingall
was appointed to command the 3d brigade ; with which
he served during the campaign of 1808.
He was present in the actions of Rolica and Vimiera,
and was placed early in July, 1809, on the staff ot the
Kent district, as Brigadier General. He was raised
on the 25th July, 1810, to the rank of Major General,
and on the 14th of June, 1814, to that of Lieutenant
General. He was appointed on the 19th of Feb. 1820,
Colonel of the 49th Foot.
Frys and Chapman?s Bankruptcy ? Tuesday
a meeting of the creditors under this commission took
place for the proof of debts, and for the declaring of a
dividend on the several estates of the bankrupts. Debts
were proved, varying in amount from a few shillings to
20001. Mr. Roscoe, a solicitor, appeared for the cre-
ditors of Messrs. Cochran and Robertson, of America
and Liverpool, merchants and mining-agents, upon a
claim of 128,0001. He begged to prove on the separate
estates of the bankrupts before any division ot the funds
took place. Mr. Commissioner Trebeck; We are of
opinion that proof cannot be admitted on the separate
estates of the bankrupts. Mr. Roscoe gave notice that
fie should immediately file a bill in Chancery against
the parties to the amount of 25,0001. as balance of ac-
counts. After some further discussion, and an investi-
gation of the balances in hand on each separate estate,
dividends were declared on W. Fry?s estate of 3s. 6d.
in the pound ; on Joseph Fry?s estate 10s in the pound ;
and on J. Chapman?s estate 10s. in the pound. The
court then adjourned.
On Saturday and Sunday, owing to the heavy and
pontinual rains, we had one of the highest floods we
have had for some years, wbioh we fear must have
done considerable damage. Many hundreds of acres in
the Weald were entirely covered with water. We have
not heard of any particular instances in which injury
was sustained, but apprehend that agricultural and
other property cannot have escaped without loss ?>

speech for the defence. We have not room for further
particulars.
The jury returned a verdict of Guilty, under strong
provocation against all the defendants.
The Chaiiman said the bench concurred in the qua-
lified verdict; for the provocation was strong, Wm.
Cobbett was sentenced to pay 201., and his two brothers
40s. each to the King, and enter into their own re-
cognizances of 501. each, to keep the peace for one year
towards Mr. French.
POLICE.
Mansion-house.?A Spaniard of peculiarly fero-
cious appearance, who had been in military service, was
brought before the Lord Mayor, charged with having
beaten a body of watchmen in their sanctum sanctorum,
after having broken windows and knocked down those
who questioned his right to disturb the public tranquil-
lity.
A shopkeeper stated that the defendant, either under
the influence of drink or some other powerful excite-
ment, moved along the streets like the common enemy
of mankind. If any person happened to stand in his
way, the obstruction was speedily removed into the
kennel by the vigorous arm of the Spaniard, who at
length took offence at one of the waxen heads which
stood in a hair-dresser?s window, with sundry beautiful
curls about it: ?Ah ! ? said he, <� I vill kill dat
head,? and without more hesitation, he dashed his hand
through the glass, and tumbled the head on the ground,
to the woeful dilapidation of the features. This ad-
venture gathered a crowd of blackguards round the
Spaniard, who seemed bent upon distinguishing himself
still more. The police at last got hold of him, tied his
arms together, as if preparing him for execution, and
endeavoured to place him in a coach. It appeared, how-
ever, that he was as active about the legs as about the
arms, for, taking a steady aim at a watchman who held
him by one leg, he gave him such a kick with the other
as laid him flat. At length he was shoved into a dust-
man?s cart, and taken to the watch-house.
The constable of the night said, that in all his expe-
rience he never met with ? such an obstropulous man as
this here Spaniard.? ? I?m blessed,? my Lord Mayor,?
said this type of civic majesty, u if ever I seed so wio-
lent a hindividual. Why he made nothing on us, and
he thought no more of one nor if I was a common fel-
ler in the street.?
The Lord Mayor.?Describe his conduct in the
watch-house.
The constable, delighted at the opportunity of a dis-
play, gave the following account of the Spaniard, to the
great amusement of all in the justice room :?? Vy, my
lord, you see, I was sitting in my chair, and giving
borders to the men, ven there was a row and a scrum-
mage at the door, and in valks this here foreign gentle-
man. Indeed I can?t gay he valked, because he
couldn?t, for his legs and harms was tied together, and
he vas all up in a lump ; so I speaks kind to him, and
I orders him to be unloosed, but the minute he vas at
liberty, my eyes! if he didn?t turn upon the men, and
I?m blessed if he didn?t let fly in bang among
?em, till he floored them all. (Roars of laughter.) So,
my lord, says I to him, come, come, says I, this here?s
improper behaviour for a gentleman. ? Vot!? says he,
and he says no more, but just as I vas viping my spec-
tacles, he catches me with such a vopper right under
the ear, that I couldn?t keep ray body up, by no means,
and so down I falls. (Shouts of laughter.) So, my
lord, ven he had us all floored, he rims to the door,
for, I suppose, he vanted to go out, but there ve had
him, for he couldn?t find no key, and so ve gets \\p 3
and ve bundles him into the black hole \ and so ve
brought him afore your lordship foy to punish him ac-
cording to law. (Loud laughter )
The constable, while making this effusion, suited the
action to tbe word so happily, that the effect of the
narrative was indescribable.
The Lord Mayor said the case was altogether one of
the strangest he ever heard. He asked the defendant
what he had to say in his defence ?
The defendant??lt is all a lie; I no strike no
vatch, but de vatch strike me, and vant kill me.?

a mild and conciliating disposition, whereas the Grand

ANTICOSTI. vi
Neilson?s Quebec Gazette contains the following tc
melancholy details of the loss of lives on this island, w
not mentioned in the extract from the Quebec Mer- b(
cury, which we published a few days since : ai
? The Granicus was wrecked about 15 miles from , v j
Godin?s post and house; the bottom of the vessel,
which has been burned, was visited ; and the remains in
of two persons, either drowned on the vessel?s being
thrown ashore or who perished to and fro to the house, th
were found. Staves, pine-timber, &c. are still strewed B
about the shore ; the long-boat, partly filled with th
deals, was taken this spring by Indians to Mingan,
from the vicinity of the wreck. It appears that, about a r
the middle of April, nearly a month before the persons ?
from whom the information we had was received, some th
Frenchmen from the Island of Miquelon had stripped
the wreck of every valuable, and had then set fire to ha
it to obtain the iron-work, which they took off with hi
them with the rigging. It is not known whether
these Miquelons ever came to the house, or knew of \ n
the death of the crew. It is not possible to ascertain WJ
what number of persons perished in the house, but 17 i n
to 20 is probably near the truth ; the remaining h e
number (nearly as many) have been drowned or
perished, either in geing to the wreck, or in g U
searching for the neighbouring posts, which being at cn
70 miles distance, could not probably be reached with. ??
out snow-shoes and provisions, and a habit of living in a( ]
the woods of this country in the winter. There was C ei
no indication about the house that provisions of any rej
kind had been landed from the wreck. It is possible
that some were ; although the position of the wreck,
while the Mater was not frozen about it, would be un-
favourable, and when it was, the depth of snow and fiei
the distance would render it scarcely practicable. It is ill
likely that the crew, who were wrecked about the 20th m 0
of November, would feel the total want of any thing �
to sustain life ; that hunger would, as usual, produce fi o i
madness, or some dispute, as to who would suffer for the
the others, would produce disturbance; and it is in f oll
this way that the numerous stains of blood, even on the p U j
roof of the rooms, is accounted for, as the result of ant
wounds given by violent Mows. In relation to the r
letters cut on the house, S.M. T. H. LF.S. the Gazette

la- and perhaps the illustrious faculty know no more.
en What Ido know, however, is that I hold here a book
ct. which contains more medical knowledge than all the
of faculty together can boast of. It has cost me many long
en and painful researches, but at last I can say, like Ar-
-1 chimedes, l I have found it.? It was truth which gave
me the inspiration, and here it is I ? The defendant

on Booz had attended them.
f *y u That is true,? cried M. De Booz, u but humanity

�} sician.? v 7
Witnesses were then examined for the defence ;
and from their evidence it appeared that, though
they had sent for M. De Booz, his attentions were
confined to the application of leeches and ordering a
beverage of warm water, no doubt upon the Sangrado
svstem.
De Booz frequently interrupted the witnesses when
they did not seem to take sufficient advantage of ex-
tenuating circumstances, and told the court that, in pur-
suing his desire ot relieving his fellow-creatures from
difficulty and pain, he had submitted to perform the
most menial and even disgusting offices.
The King?s Advocate having been heard in support
�f the judgment, the defendant proceeded to reply.
He would rest his defence, he said, upon a reputation
of 38 years; and though he had taken care of a good
many sick, it was true, yet he always followed the pre-
scriptions of other doctors, and never wrote any him-
self. After endeavouring to show that he was no quack,
but that be had done quite as much good as the most
eminent of the faculty, he concluded as follows : ? I
hcive incontestable recommendations in my favour, and,
though I never took any money, I have done good ser-
vice to humanity, and of this I call to witness this mute
testimony of ray labours. I solemnly call upon my
worm to corroborate me?the worm which, had it not
been for me, would have caused the death of an amiable
and estimable woman?.the mother of an interesting and
virtuous family.?
The court, after some deliberation, gave the follow-
ing decision:?
? Considering the mental state of the accused, and
that the evidence did not sufficiently prove that De
Booz had practised the medical profession, we dismiss
the complaint.?
Upon hearing this decision the defendant seemed in
an ecstacy of joy, and with a loud voice cried out,
? Long live the King, the president, and the court,
the royal family, and the magistracy ! ?
M. Foudery, the counsel to whom the defendant
had made allusion, then rose to explain some part of
his conduct, but
The president said that there was no ground for any
imputation upon him ; adding, however, that if he
was not satisfied, and still wished to show his anxiety
in favour ot his client, the best thing he could do would
be to get him admitted to the madhouse at Charenton.
The Gazette des Tribunaux then says that the sin-
gular manner of the would-be Esculapius drew a great
crowd after him, and as he left the court he said,
? Long live the ministers.? ? This exclamation,?
adds the journalist, ? if any thing else were wanting,
certainly shows that the doctor is a candidate for Cha-
renton.?
DEVONPORT, Sept. 19.
The Britannia of 120 guns, Capt. Burdett, having
been completely equipped, and having a complement of
1100 men, is expected to sail for the Dardanelles to-
morrow.
The artificers of the dock-yard are working extra
hours to fit out the St. Vincent of 120 guns, to take
the flag of Earl Northesk. Several planks have been
found defective under her wales, thongh they were
put in but six years since. These are cutting out,
and the utmost exertions are making to get her afloat.
The Druid frigate is to be paid off ?all standing.?
She is to be surveyed, and if found defective will be un-
rigged by the riggers of the yard.

this system of intimidation been carried on, that in the
open day persons will go into a field and deliberately
warn workmen to desist from their labour, or else to
await the consequences. Another Catholic gentle-
man in the vicinity of this town has been threat-
ened with the destruction of his property by his own
tenantry, because, on their voting for Mr. O?Connell
at the former election, he compelled them to pay him
the rent then due. The sum was paid by the Catholic
Association. The tenantry became sauev, and were
taken part with ky the Rev. Mr. Healy, the parish
priest, which tended a little to heighten their vanity
or determination. However, another Catholic clergy-
man, the Rev. Mr. Cullinam, a very exemplary and
highly esteemed gentleman, advocated the cause of the
landlord, and thereby became unpopular in the country.
And such was the manner in which he was annoyed,
that he found it necessary to relinquish his pa-
rish, leave the diocese of Killenora altogether,
and is now only a curate in the diocese of Kil-
laloe. I cannot but believe that tbe influence of the
Catholic priesthood over their congregation has
been greatly overrated ; and, from personal ob-
f servation, I can state that numbers of them, who have
for the last two or three months exhorted their flocks to
obey tbe laws of the country and refrain from their
nocturnal meetings, have been greatly tormented and
actually insulted by the peasantry, who resort to many
stratagems to annoy them. They will sometimes give
them no offerings on collection days, and in one case I
have known the wool to be plucked off the lambs and
sheep of a priest. You must from a strange opinion of
the state of society here, when anv stranger wearing a
decent suit of clothes is very rigorously examined by
the peasantry relative to his business and stay in the
country. On Sunday last one of the law-agents' of Mr.
O'Connell would have been knocked down in the streets
of the town were it not that he had been recognised by
a person in the crowd. I know a very respectable
family who, on going to visit a glen in the country, were
hooted fat as a set of Bru-ns wickers. This shows thede-
termination of the people.
(From the Dublin Evening Mail)
A memorial, of which the following is a copy, ap-
peared in the Star of Brunswick of Saturday last ; and
has, we have reason to know, been transmitted by the
Earl of Enniskillen, as Governor and Gustos Rotulorum
of the county Fermanagh, to his Excellency the Lord
Lieutenant. In the Mail of Friday we gave an ex-
tract from a most intelligent and well-written letter,
referring to the meeting at Gola, and at which this
memorial was agreed upon. It presents a frightful
picture of the state to which the Protestants of that
remote district are reduced, the state of terror in which
they lire, and the utter insecurity for life or property
that exists. We learn from unquestionable authority that
since the burning of the Rev. Mr. King?s house at Cor-
rard, and the threatening notices that have been
served on several Protestants in that quarter, nightly
watches are maintained in most of the houses in the
neighbourhood. What a state of things in a country
pretending to civilization, and with laws, too, for the
protection of its inhabitants !
?May it please your Excellency, We, the undersigned
memorialists, beg leave respectfully to call your excel-
lency?s attention to the danger to which our lives and
properties are at present exposed, from that bane of our
country, the Rockite system of intimidation and devas-
tation, which has lately extended itself to our hitherto
comparatively peaceable neighbourhood.
?It is with regret we inform your excellency, that in
two instances threatening notices, bearing the broad
stamps of popish bigotry, persecution, and intolerance,
have been lately served upon unoffending individuals,
and speedily followed up by the burning of two dwell-
ing-houses ; and we entertain little doubt that?fiom
the circumstances under which these outrages were
perpetrated, as well as from the sanguinary spirit evinced
ia the notices to which we refer, ?the destruction, not
merely of property, but of life, was designed.
? And further, we have reason to apprehend, from
repeated rumours of an intended invasion, by the
disaffected persons residing on the opposite
shore of Lough Derg?a spot recently stained
with the blood of our Protestant brethren ?and for the
accomplishment of which, the localities of this district
present peculiar inducements?that the outrages alluded
to are but the signals for a more general aggression
upon Protestant life and property.
? The present apathy and indifference of the civil au-
thorities resident in our immediate neighbourhood, to
our danger, compel us to lay this representation of our
defenceless situation before your excellency, to pray
that you will order some of our gallant yeomanry on
permanent duty, or establish an adequate police station
in this neighbourhood, for our future protection and se-
curity.?
(Here follow the signatures of nearly a hundred
Protestants, the great majority being of the lower
order.)
DUBLIN, Sept. 22.

of the late (but never defunct) Association. p0

EAST INDIA HOUSE.? Wednesday
A quarterly general meeting of the proprietors nf
India Stock, was held in Leadenhall-street this r ?
ing, for the purpose of transacting ths businer, 7�! lI
company. The meeting was made special p ?r the * *
pose of taking into consideration the rep 0M prese P ? d
at the last court relative to an alter at i on ; P the byedaws
ei the company. s
Shortly after twelve o?dbck, the chairman of the
company, John Lock., Esq., took his seat, and the
minutes of the last court were read.
Papers were?.aid before the court relative to the civil
and military list of Ce y lon; also papers relati'eta
?as India trade; a list of superannuations granted
lately ; papers relative to Addescombe and Havlesburv
colleges, with lists of students, Ac. ? y
Mr. Maxfleld inquired if all the papers had be�a ?
pared to be laid before parliament ?
The chairman answered in the affirmative. Ti� thpn

Gen. Thornton said tha?, ?n the eve of the expiration
!h? Id hT Pany ! 7 er ? the most minute ?"formation
should be given to the Court of Proprietors. He had
frequently noticed that the House of Commons was
put in possession of information long before honourable
proprietors. He should, therefore, move for a printed
of all pensions granted by the company, to whom
granted, and for what services. The honourable pro.
prietor followed up his motion by observing that Mrs
Heber (widow of the late bishop of Calcutta) had
received a pension of 4001. per annum, whilst another
lady, equally well entitled, and not nearly so well off,
fiad been refused a pension of 2501.
The chairman said the hon. proprietor was in amis-
take. The information given to the House r ,f Cora,
mens was as regularly Submitted to the proprietors. He
therefore hoped that the gallant general would not press

Motion withdrawn.
Here several voices exclaimed that the bet was lost.
Some said that tnere must be a confederacy between the
challenger and the challenged, and others asked whe-
ther any money had been deposited ?
Ihe Fire-King called a Mr. White forward, who de-
posed that he held the stakes, which had been regularly
placed in his hands, by both parties, before twelve

The Fire-King here asked Mr. Smith if he intended

Mr. Smith replied that he could answer that question

as another precaution, I will trouble you, Doctor
(speaking to Dr. Gordon Smith), to tie m?y hands to-
gether behind me.
Here a loud cry was set up that it was unnecessary to
have the Fire-King bandaged in this manner.
The Fire-King.?Oh 1 gentlemen, I beg vour par-
don, it is necessary; for I want to show you that Ido
not juggle.
After he had been bandaged in this manner, he plant,
ed himself on one knee in the centre of the room, and
requested some gentlemen to place the phosporus on
his tongue, and pour the water down his throat. This
was accordingly done, and the water and phosohorus
were swallowed together. He then opened his mouth,
and requested the company to look whether any portion
of the phosphorus remained in his mouth. Several gen-
tlemen examined hls mouth, and declared that there
was no phosphorus perceptible either upon or under his
tongue. He was then by his own desire unbandaged.
The Fire-King then turned to Mr, Smith and offered
him the other glass of phosphorus with a ceremonious
politeness which was highly entertaining?? And now,
my good sir, 1 shall have great pleasure in seeing vou
take off your glass too.?
Mr. Smith started back in infinite alarm?? Not for
worlds, sir, not for worlds ; I beg to decline it.?
The Fire-King?Eh 1 mon Dieu ; you decline it'
Oh ! dear sir, no, no; you will drink von little glass to

Mr. Smith?The company must excuse me. I don?t

Mr. Smith. No, no; I must be excused ;I am quite
satisfied without it.


NEW POLICE INSTRUCTIONS.
The following provisional instructions for the dif-
ferent ranks of the police force are not to be under-
stood as containing certain rules of conduct, under
every variety of circumstances that may occur in the
performance of their duty ; something must necessarily
be left to the intelligence and discretion of individuals ;
and according to the degree in which they shew them,
selves possessed of these qualities, and to the zeal,
activity, and judgment they display on all occasions,
will be their claims to future promotion and reward.
It should be understood, at the outset, that the object
to be attained is ? the prevention of crime.? ?
To this great end every effort of the police is to be
directed. The security of person and property, the
preservation of the public tranquillity, and all the other
objects of a police establishment, will thus be better
effected than by the detection and punishment of the
offender, after he has succeeded in committing the
crime. This should constantly be kept in mind by
every member of the police force, as the guide for his
own conduct. Officers and police constables should
endeavour to distinguish themselves by such vigilance
and activity as may render it impossible for any one to
commit a crime within that portion of the town under
their charge.
When many offences are committed, it must appear
to the Commissioners that the police is not properly
conducted in that division; and the absence of crime
will be considered tne best proof of the complete effi-
ciency of the police. In a division, where this security
and good order have been effected, the officers and men
belonging to it may feel assured that such good conduct
will be noticed by rewards and promotion.
LOCAL DIVISIONS.
1. The metropolitan police district will be formed
into police divisions.
2. That part of the district which is taken under the
charge of the police force in the first instance, com-
prising a large proportion of the town, is formed into five
regular police divisions.
3. The number of men and officers, and the consti-
tution of the force, are the same in each division; but
in laying out the division, attention has been paid to
local and other circumstances determining the number
of men required, so that the superficial contents of the
divisions differ greath r , and consequently that portion
of each committed to the care of one man.
5. Each division is again divided into eight sections.
G. Each section into eight beats.
J, The limits of each of these is clearly defined ;
each is numbered, and the number entered in a book to
he kept for the purpose.
8. Each division has an appropriate local name, and is
also designated by a letter of the alphabet.
9. There is in every division a station or watch-
house, placed as conveniently for the whole as may be,
according to circumstances. From this point all the
duty of the division is carried on.
10. The men belonging to each section shall, as far
as may be found practicable, lodge together near to the
place of their duty, in order to render them speedily
efficient, in case the services of such as are off duty
should be required for any sudden emergency.
POLICE FORCE.
1. The police force consists of as many companies as
there are police local divisions, one company being al-
lotted to each division.
2. Each company is formed as follows
1 Superintendent,
4 Inspectors,
1C Serjeants,
144 Police Constables.
3. The company is divided into sixteen parties, each
consisting of one serjeant and nine men.
Four serjeants? parties, or one-fourth part of the
company, form an inspector?s party.
4. The whole company is under the command of
the superintendent.
5. Each man is conspicuously marked with the
letter of his division, and a number, corresponding
with his name in the books, so that he can at all times
he known to the public.
6*. The first 1C numbers in each division denote the
serjeants.
7. A smaller police company is attached to the office
of the commissioners, for the duty in the immediate
neighbourhood, and is also applicable to general pur-
poses.
CONDITIONS.
The conditions upon which each man is to be ad-
mitted into the police force are stated here, that no
complaint may be made hereafter upon their being en-
forced. The commissioners of police desire it to be
understood, at the same time, that they reserve their
power to alter or annul any el these; and also to make
such new rules as may be found expedient.
1. He shall devote' his whole time to the police ser-
vice.
2. He shall serve and reside wherever he is ap-
pointed.
3. He shall promptly obey all lawful orders which he

16. He shall not use, nor allow to be used, the baton,
marked ? police force,? except while he belongs to the
police service. ... ,
Each police constable is liable to dismissal, or such
other punishment as may by law lie inflicted, for the
breach of any of the foregoing rules. Also, the com-
missioners will, if they shall think fit. dismiss him,
without assigning I reason.
OUTLINE OF GENERAL DUTY.
1. The duty will commence each evening at an hour
Peculated by the setting of the sun 5 when any change
becomes necessary, it will be specified in orders.
2 One part of the force, for duty from the com-
mencement of the evening til! midnight, may be called
the first night relief; and from midnight till morn,
jng, the second night relief; in like manner may be a
first and second day relief.
3 One half of the entire force will be on duty at
night, consisting of two inspectors and eight serjeants,
with their respective parties, at one time ; and these
wlli be relieved liv the other half, at the hours, and in
the manner hereinafter specified.
4. Each serjeant?s party, when on wIU have
charge of its respective section of the division, each po-
lice constable having a beat appropriated to him, wnjjm
the section. ~ , , . . ,
5. In case any constable should be aosent, from sick-
ness or any other cause, his place will be supplied from
She reserve of his section-
fi. There will be nine men belonging to each ser,
.'pant?s party, and only eight beats in a section ; thus
one man of each section will remain at the division
station, forming a reserve of eight men for the whole
division, to supply occasional absences, and to be
ready for such duties as may be required there.
7. If from sickness of the men, or any other cause,
the reserve men at the division station be required for
dutv, their place roust be supplied by the men of the
relief going off duty ; when this becomes necessary,
the reserve party, formed of the men going off duty,
will be permitted to take their rest at the station, as
far as circumstances will permit.
8. The men of each section will in turn be lelt as
the reserve at the station.
9. The superintendent, or senior inspector, must
name the individuals who are to remain at the diyi-
sion station, from the off-going relief, when that is re-
quired. . .
10. The men who are off duty are to consider them-
selves liable to be called on at ail times, and will always
prepare themselves, when required, at the shortest
notice. . ,
IJ. With a view to such sudden emergencies, that
the men may be fully efficient, they will be lodged in, or
as near as possible to, their respective sections. t
12. A certain number, when so ordered by their
.officers, must sleep in their clothes, to be in perfect
readiness when called on. < ,
J3. The serjeant must live in the house with the
men of his section, or close to it, as permission is given
him; he will always go on duty with his party, and
have the general charge and superintendence of it at
all times.
14. The men of the relief for duty will individually
assemble at the division station, before or precisely at
the hour fixed for that purpose in the orders and will
form in order in their respective parties. Their names
will be called, and an inspection made by their
respective serjeants, to ascertain that they are all per-
fectly sober and correctly dressed and appointed ; each
man will be furnished with a card, with his name, and
the number of the beat he is to take charge of, written
upon it.
The name of the man, opposite to the heat he is to
take charge, will be entered in a book; the serjeant
will then read and explain, if necessary, the orders of
the day, if there be any ; and having done so, he will
make his report to the inspector, who will give to each
serjeant in writing the hours he is to make his patrols
round his section, also the time of reporting to him at
a central point, and will order them to march the men
off to their respective stations.
Of the two inspectors who will be on duty together,
one will take the general charge of the duty through-
out the division, visiting the men, and seeing as much
of it as possible; receiving the reports of the several
serjeants as before mentioned, so as frequently to hear
from them the state of all parts of the division. The
other inspector will remain in the division station, to
receive charges, complaints, and all applications for
assistance, &c. They will either relieve each other,
exchanging the duty for half the entire period of con-
tinuing on duty, or arrange it as may be mutually
agreed on.
In case of any riot or disturbance in the streets,
which might be likely to call too many of the consta-
bles from their respective beats, the inspector will send
to the division station for the reserve party, or, if re-
quisite, to the nearest residence of the party off duty
in the section ; but this should be done only in cases of
necessity. 1
At the hour for relieving the men, no one shall leave
his beat until the relief has actually arrived on the
beat; the constable relieved will then go to a particu-
lar spot appointed in each section for that purpose.
When all the party relieved of the section are assem-
bled, they are to be inspected by the serjeant, as when
going on duty, that he may ascertain whether they are
perfectly sober and correctly dressed, as when he posted
them. The serjeant will then dismiss the party, and
proceed to make his final report to the inspector at the
appointed place.
The inspectors will deliver a written report according
to the printed form at o?clock, to the superin-
tendent of their division.
The superintendent will send in at o?clock
each morning to the office a report and return, accord-
ing to the prescribed forms, detailing the occurrences of
the night within his division ; and he will also send all
persons given in charge or apprehended in the night,
under the care of , to such of the police
magistrates? offices as may he fixed on for the division.
The officer who takes charge of the persons to the
office will attend to their several cases, and make a re-
port, in writing, of the result of each to the superin-
tendent, who will send a report of the same to the office
on that day, if he shall deem it requisite, or the follow-
ing morning, with the other reports.
SUPERINTENDENT.
It is desirable that he should reside as near to the
division station as circumstances permit; his duty will
require his frequent attendance there. Applications
for assistance and instructions made at the station will
be referred to him; and a more speedy communication
of all orders may be effected through him, if he shall be
near the station, to which in the first instance they
must be transmitted from the office. He will be re-
sponsible for the general conduct and good order of the
officers and men under his charge. He should make
himself well acquainted, by frequent personal inter-
course, with the inspectors and serjeants, and through
them, with the character and conduct of every man in
the company under his orders ; and, by a firm, but kind
and conciliating behaviour towards them on all occa-
sions, make them understand, that while neglect �f
duty can in no instance be passed over, every indul-
gence, consistent with their general efficiency, will be at
all times shown to them.
He will take care that the standing orders and regu-
lations, and all others given out from time to time, are
promptly and strictly obeyed. It is expected that he
should himself actually see a great deal done; but
he must understand that he may be much more efficient
by giving instructions to the officers under him, and
making them do their duty, than he can be by attempt-
ing to do every thing himself. He must see that the
dutv is done, and will, if necessary, immediately re-
port any neglect to the commissioners.
He is responsible generally for every thing relating
to the police of his division (keeping in mind that the
grand object is the prevention of crime in every part of
it). It is not wished to lay out any precise course for
the superintendent, or to say how much of his time is
to be passed in the active performance of his duties;
but he will feel the importance of visiting some part
of his division at uncertain hours every day and night.
He will make a daily inspection of the books at the
division station, to see that they are kept correctly;
carefully examine and sign all reports and returns sent
to the office, and forward them punctually at the ap-
pointed hours.
He will, according to his discretion, grant immediate
assistance from the men on duty at his station to all
persons requiring it, where there is not time to refer to
the office for instructions.
In cases of complaints made against any of his men,
if of a trivial nature, he will award some punishment
to the man, and satisfaction to the party complain-
ing, and report the whole immediately to the com-
missioners ; or if the offence be of a more serious
nature, he should at once report the whole to the com-
missioners, taking such immediate step, by suspending
the man, or otherwise, as may appear necessary.
It will be expected that he should at all times be able
to furnish the commissioners with particular informa-
tion respecting the state of every part of his division.
In observing, with especial attention, the actions of
all suspected persons within the division, and in giving
directions to his men for this purpose, he will keep in
mind, that the prevention of crime, the great object of
all their exertions, will be best attained by making it
evident to all such, that they are known and strictly
watched, and that certain detection will follow any at-
tempt they may make to commit the crime.
Upon any alarm of fire within the division, it be-
comes the dutv of the superintendent immediately to
repair to the spot, and take the entire control of the
police force that may be assembled, sending for those
who are off duty* Immediate notice must be given to
the several fire offices. If the keys of the parish engines
are at the division station, they will be procured, and
the engines got out and brought t� the fires; rendering
such assistance as may be in his power, from knowledge
of fire plugs, procuring water, &c.
The police will, perhaps, be most useful in procuring
a free scope for the firemen?s exertions, and the
parties more immediately interested; with this
view he will clear the street or ground in
the immediate vicinity of the fire, of all per-
sons not actively and usefully employed, tak-
ing care that all the adjoining streets, as far as
may be practicable, are kept clear of obstructions, by
crowds, or carriages, waggons, carts, &g. that the en-
gines may not be delayed on their road.
Every assistance possible must be given to the re-
moval of property,' conformably with the wishes and
suggestions of the proprietors; and, if desired, such
property may be conveyed to the nearest police station
or residence, placing it under the protection of the
police.
A special attention must be directed at such times to
the thieves and pickpockets, who are usually in the
crowd.
Whenever the men may be called away from their
beats by fire or any sudden necessity, they shall be di-
rected to yeturn to their regular duty as soon as they
can be spared ; and the serjeant will be sent with them,
to see that no delay occurs in their return. He should
make it his duty to collect upon the spot all the infor-
mation h e Gan obtain relative to the cause of the fire,
which, together with the circumstances attending it #
the conduct oi tfi.e police under his orders, and the time
they were employed, he report fully, as soon as may
be, to the commissioners.
INSPECTOR.
The inspector will reside at the place appointed for
him. ' . .
He is to receive his orders and instructions irom,and
make his reports to, fjie superintendent.
He must strictly and promptly obey all lawful direc-
tions for the execution of his duty, as be will expect the
same submission from the officers and men placed under
his command.
Each inspector will have under him four serjeants
and thirty-six men, and he will be responsible for their
general conduct and good order.
Jt is exnccted, that by constant personal intercourse
with them' all, he shall make hiajaelf well acquainted
with the talents and general moral character of each
individual.
He should immediately report t6 the superintendent
any circumstances which he observes in the conduct of
the men requiring notice.
If upon complaint made, or otherwise, he shall think
any punishment ought to be inflicted on the men, he
will, as seen as possible, communicate the whole matter
to the superintendent, for his decision, taking any im-
mediate step, hy suspension of the man from duty, if
the case require that.
He will take care that the standing orders and regu-
lations, and all others given out from time to time, are
promptly and strictly obeyed by those under him.
It is expected that he shall be able and ready to give
instructions to the serjeants and men, on all points re-
lating to their duty.
Any neglect of duty must immediately be reported.
Of the four inspectors belonging to each company, two
will always be on duty at the same time?one remain-
ing in the division station for the purposes stated here-
after, the other doing the general duty in the streets ;
these two may arrange mutually the times for relieving
each other, or that shall be fixed by the superintendent.
The inspectors for duty will be at the division station
punctually at the hour appointed in orders ; each will
inspect his several parties going on duty, and make all
the necessary preparations in silence and good order,
receive the reports from the serjeants of the state of-
their respective parties, give the serjeants, in writing,
the hours for making their patrols round the section,
and the point at which he will receive reports from
them of the state of the section ; he will then give
orders to the serjeants to march off their parties to their
several stations.
The inspector on the street duty will see as much of
thedivisiou as possible at uncertain hours; and it is desi-
rable that he should see every part of it once at least
during his tour of duty. He will make a note of the
reports of the serjeants, at the appointed times and
places; and if any serjeant do not appear to make his
report, inquiry should be immediately made to ascertain
the cause.
In the event of any felony or rioting, or upon any
sudden emergency, he will send for such assistance as
may be required, either to the division station, or the
residence of the section, but to the latter only in case
of necessity; if he judges it expedient, he will also
send to the superintendent. A printed form of report
of the occurrences of the night will be filled up by
him, and forwarded to the superintendent at
o?clock each morning.
In the event of a fire taking place, the inspector, if
the superintendent be absent, will take upon himself the
entire direction of the police, and act in conformity
with the instructions for that purpose already given to
the superintendent.
The inspector on duty at the division station will
keep good order there ; he will be held responsible for
the constant readiness of the reserve party, not allow-
ing drinking either by them or other persons ; he is to
receive all charges brought to the station, entering
them in a book, according to a printed form. If any
property be brought to him, either taken from persons
apprehended or otherwise, he will immediately make an
entry of the same in the property book, and state it
shortly in his report to the superintendent; the articles
of property themselves, should be marked the instant
they are received, so that they can be afterwards cer-
tainly known to be the same ; they should be taken by
the inspector himself from the party bringing them,
and not allowed to be out of his sight until marked in
the manner directed ; they should then be locked up by
the inspector, in a place kept for that purpose, and of
which he alone has the key ; he will take care that all
persons brought under charges are securely confined;
if the offence with which they are charged be only a
petty misdemeanor, he may set them at liberty, taking
a recognizance for their appearing next day at the
sitting magistrate?s office, unless that should be a Sun-
day, Christmas Day, or Good Friday; then on the
following day, at the same hour. He will find directions
in the recognizance book as to the manner in which this
is to be done.
In case application is made to him for assistance, he
will, according to the best of his judgment, render all
in his power, either from the reserve party, or by call-
ing up those off duty; but this last is only to be done
in cases of necessity, and notice should immediately be
sent to the superintendent; he should, before be grants
any, be satisfied with the grounds upon which it is
demanded, that the party has a right to demand
it, &c.
An immediate entry is to be made by him in the
book of occurrences, and included in the following
morning?s report to the superintendent.
He will pay particular attention to all complaints
made against any individual of the police force; if
made in person, requesting the party to sign such ac-
count of it as the inspector shall enter in his book ; ex-
cept in cases where an immediate step is necessary,
such complaint shall bq merely forwarded to the super-
intendent in next morning?s report, for his decision.
Previous to his being relieved, he shall make up his
report fully, and deliver or send it to the superinten-
dent ; he must appear at the office of the sitting magis-
trates, to substantiate any charge, if necessary.
He will at all times be required, by every means in
his power, to obtain such information as the super-
intendent desires, upon all matters relating to police.
SERJEANT.
He will reside in the section, in the house appointed.
He is to obey all orders given him by the superintend-
ent or inspectors of his company. He is expected to
set the best example to the men in the alacrity and
skill with which he shall perform his own duties.
Each serjeant has under him nine men, and he will
be held responsible for their general conduct and good
order. He will live much with them, and is expected
to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the charac-
ter of every individual. He will keep in his own hand-
writing a journal, according to a prescribed form, of
any misconduct or fault they may be guilty of; this
book shall be laid before the inspectors and superintend-
ents at stated periods, and will be always consulted be-
fore any individual shall receive any reward, or be pro-
moted. The serjeants will therefore feel the import-
ance of entering in this book fully and fairly every cir-
cumstance which may enable their officers to form a
just opinion of the individual?s character; in no instance
will any neglect or mis-statement by the serjeant in
such particulars be passed over.
The serjeants for duty will arrive at the division
station before the hour fixed by his orders, form his
party into ranks, and inspect them, taking care that
every man is perfectly sober and correctly dressed.
He will read and explain to the men
the orders, if any have been given out that
day. He will enter in a book the hour the party goes
on duty, and the name of each man opposite the
number of the beat in his section that such man is to
take charge of; he will then report to the in-
spector, and receive his orders. He marches with his
men to the section, and goes round it, and sees every
man relieve the man previously on duty. Having done
so, he will repair to the spot fixed on for making his
first report to the inspector; this report should induce
any irregularity or disorderly conduct in the men re-
lieved, as well as any other particular.
He is constantly to patrol his section to insure the
performance of their duty by his men. He always at
night carries a dark lantern. If at anytime he finds a
man absent from -his duty on the beat, he will have
him replaced as quickly as possible, sending for an*
other from the reserve at the station, or from the sec-
tion residence ; but this last only in case of necessity.
He should immediately ascertain the cause of the
man?s absence, and report it to the inspector ; in case
of any felony or disturbance, he will send for such as-
sistance as may be necessary, either to the division
station or section residence?never to the latter except
in pases of urgent necessity,
He will give all assistance in his power to persons
applying to him ; he will learn from his general duties
as a constable in what way he is to interfere either in
arresting people, entering houses, or taking property
from suspected persons ; noticing hackney coaches and
other vehicles at night.
In case of fire, in the absence of the superintendent
and inspector, he will act according to the instructions
already given for their guidance, taking immediate
steps to acquaint them, and give notice to the division
station.
He will feel that it is particularly desired by his
superiors that he should be civil and obliging to every
bodv, and render every information and assistance in
his power when called on.
He is to notice and receive reports also from the
men as to the state of the gas lamps, whether any are
dirty or extinguished, and report the same to his in-
spectors,
When his men are relieved he will collect them at
the appointed place, and inspect them in the same man-
ner as when going on duty, and report their state. In
pase the serjeant be absent from illness or any other
cause, fiis place is to be supplied by one of the men in
his party, >vho be named generally for that pur-

Ramsgate, Sept. 20? Yesterday, about five in the
afternoon, two boatmen belonging to this place went
out of the harbour to tow in a schooner. One of them
got on hoard, and the other was left to tow the vessel;
the latter, however, requested the assistance of his
mate, and brought the boat alongside to take him in,
when the schooner happening to pitch capped the
boat, which instantly sunk, and the poor man was seen
no more; he has left a widow and eight children. The
boat was picked up this morning near Broadstairs.?A

THE MURDER OF HANLON.
THE INQUEST.
Dublin, Sept. 20.
When Sir George Whiteford arrived at Stephen?s
Hospital with the prisoners and the witnesses, he swore
a jury of 13. They were brought to view the body of
the unfortunate man, and every one was shocked when
they looked upon it.
The first witness examined was Patrick Hughes.
I was, he deposed, in Thomas-street, yesterday even-
ing, and walking by the side of the deceased Hanlon,
who sent me into a shop for a halfpenny-worth of to-
bacco. A fellow came up and tripped me. He held
me till I got into Farrelly?s (the tobacconist) shop. I
got under a table, and two men came in after me. I
remained under the' table till they went away. A
woman put me into a cellar to conceal myself. 1 should
not know the men who attacked rae, nor should I
know the others. Hanlon was about three yards
from me when I handed him the tobacco. I did
not see him struck. I heard the attack would be
made, but did not know any reason for it, except that
he did not belong to ? the body .? The body-raen take
an oath to work for certain prices and for certain
people. I worked with Hanlon in Mr. Fagan?s yard.
Neither he nor I were body-men. On my oath 1 can
neither identify the person who struck me nor beat
Hanlon. I and my father were assaulted last Christ-
mas for not being body-men.
Juror?Did you not insinuate to rae that you could
throw some light upon the business ?
Hughes.?l do not remember mentioning any such
thing.
Juror.?-By the virtue of my oath you did.
Hughes.?l had no conversation with the body-men
before or after this business; they would not, iu fact,
speak to me if they met me in the street. I was not
promised my freedom after this business was over. I
met two of the body this morning, who told rae they
were glad I had escaped, but they did not say any
thing of Hanlon ; they said no more to me. They did
not advise me to hold ray tongue, nor threaten me.
Hanlon had no conversation with rae respecting the
expected attacks upon him. Hanlon carded weapons
with him for his defence. He used to carry a
pike. I dissuaded him from carrying it that even-
mg, as I thought it useless. Hanlon carried a hatchet,
and latterly a scythe. He did not use them last night,
as he had not time to do so, the assailants came so un-
awares upon us. I did not see the first blow Hanlon
got. None of the body, either directly or indirectly,
promised me ray freedom, or to allow me to work with
them after this business. Mr. Farrelly?s place was so
full of chairs and tables that the man who followed me
could not get at me. The man who had a hold of me
had a grey coat on him. J could not distinguish his
dress, X was in such a burry to get away from him. I
was not in the habit of sitting with the body-men.
They made more free with with me this morning than
ever they did before. Ned Mooney is one of the two
sets of sawyers I met this morning.
Juror.?ls Ned Mooney a body-man ??He is. Xdo
not know the name of the other three sawyers. They
said they were glad 1 escaped, and that a man
was murdered the night before. I work in Mr.
Fagan?s yard. Mooney is a body-man, and works
there also. Hanlon was murdered, because he is
not a body-man. I would have been murdered also,
only that I got so soon into the shop, and hid
under the table. The man that pursued me
pushed table and chairs about looking Ibr me.
When I looked round, I saw a crowd collected. I saw
men with bludgeons. There was a great number ef
them. Some of them had cudgels. My comrade had
an old scythe under his coat. He carried it this fortnight
back. 1 refused to carry any weapon for him this half
year, because I considered it useless, and told the de-
ceased so. Hanlon carried a weapon, because bethought
he would be assailed. I did not hear that we would be
attacked that night. Hanlon's wife told me last Thurs-
day that we would he attacked , and to mind ourselves.
No other female cautioned rae. Hanlon was in the
sawpit with rae when we were first cautioned. Mrs.
Whelan never cautioned me, but she told me how her
husband had been u slated? (beaten) before, and to
take care of ourselves. Whelan was a body-man, I
never was in Whelan?s house in ?i the body-house in
Golden-lane.? I do not know where Whelan works.
I did not hear of a sawyer?s funeral yesterday even-
ing. I did not swear that I knew two of the four men
who came into Mr. FagaU?s yard this morning.
They work in that yard, but I do not know their
names ; there are only four of them working there. I
would know them by eye-sight. I was working in the
yard a year and a half, and they were working there
before me. I only know the name of Ned M�oney,
one of the four. Ido not know the time they left the
yard. I always leave them in the yard after me, to
avoid going out with them, for fear of being assaulted.
Their pit is about four perches from mine. I never
heard them conversing together. Hanlon left the road
with me yesterday evening.
It was manifest to every one who attended the in-
quest that this witness, a very young man, was not
telling the u whole truth,? He gave his evidence in a
most reluctant manner, and the Coroner was frequently
obliged to warn him of the consequences of the course
he was pursuing.
Daniel Delany,?At six o?clock yesterday evening I
was standing at Mr. M 4 Evatt?s door in Thomas-street,
when I saw the last witness running away, and pur-
sued by persons armed with bludgeons. I saw the
deceased also struck. I said to Mr. M fc Evatt,
? these are slaters, and it is useless to interfere.?
I saw several persons beating the deceased ; one
of them returned twice, and struck him in a most
savage manner. I would be able to identify that
man. There were about 25 or 30 persons present, all
armed with bludgeons, except the man who returned
twice, and he had the spoke of a car, and was the most
active and determined of the entire party. After the
deceased was knocked down, he get as much beating as
would kill twenty men. The street was very quiet at
the time the attack was made. The assailants said no-
thing when the attack was commenced by them, nor
while it lasted. The greater number of the persons
who attacked the assailant wore blue body-coats; the
most wicked of them, he who returned twice to strike
the deceased, had on a check shirt. That man I would
certainly know.
The seven prisoners were here brought into the
room. They were desired to be put in various positions
in the room, while they were examined by Messrs.
Delaney and Hughes. They bore the examination
with great nerve.
Hughes at once declared he would not know any one
of them^
After a consultation between the coroner and the
magistrates, it was determined to put no question to
Mr. Delaney as to identification.
E. MSEvatt.?l reside at No. 12, Thomas-st. I was
behind my counter yesterday evening, when I saw a
number of persons, armed with bludgeons, run across
the street. I saw a man knocked down, and they
beating him. Ido not know that I would be able to
identify any �f the men. I have no knowledge of the
seven men who were brought into the room. My bro-
ther told me that he thought he would know one of
them. My brother saw more of it than I did, I was
within four yards of the men. My cousin, Edward
Finnerty, also saw it. He ran away this morning,
when he heard that Mr. Lynch, the peace-officer, wag
looking for him. Finnerty is about 12 years old. I
do not know where he is. I told Mr. Lynch that I
suspected that he had gone to his uncle?s house at M ill-
town, in the county of Kildare. Finnerty has an aunt
at Pollardstown, near Milltown. I heard he went to
Mr. Fitzsimmons, a carpenter, on the Coembe. He
said he did not wish to come and give his evidence. I
am quite sure I could not identify any of the seven men
who are in custody.
Mr. Andrew Butler?l am a surgeon, and reside at
Duleek, in the county Meath. I saw the poor man
knocked down. I saw one man in particular striking
him. I saw hiiu return to the deceased, and he struck
the deceased more than any other of the combinators.
I think I could identify that man ; he had a sallow
complexion, wore a cap, and appeared to be about 30
years of age. Ido not know that he had a check shirt
on him. When they struck the man, that person held
up a bludgeon. The persons concerned in the attack
broke Mr. Farrelly?s window, and then ran up Crane-
lane. At that time the deceased was not dead; be was
lying or; his left side, weltering in his gore. I went
into Mr. Farrelly?s shop ; a person there told the peace
officer that he could identify four of them. I should
not know that person.
Mr. Farrelly, the tobacconist, declared that he should
not know the party, not even the. man whose life he
saved. A woman came into his shop, and said she
sheuld know gome of them. His servant girl said she
knew that woman's name.
John M?Evatt.?l saw the riot, but could not iden
tify any of the men. I know Finnerty. I saw him
this morning. I did not hear him say any thing, good
or bad, about this business. I did not hear him say
that he would not come forward to prosecute -M'(jr;:ti,.
Matthew Hayes described the man wlio inflicted the
greatest beating upon the deceased as a fine-looking
young ipan, about fiv� feet eight inches iu height. He
was himself a body-man 27 years ago.
Mr. Patrick Oullinane, a medical student, said that
be had examined the body in the neSt room. The
skull of the deceased was fractured. There were seve-
ral lacerations on his legs, as if inflicted with blunt
instruments. The face of the deceased fell from one
side to the other, when moving his head. The beatin ,r
was the cause of his death.
The'inquest was adjourned to eleven o?clock next
day, at Arran-quay Police-office.
The inquest was accordingly resumed next morning, f
The first witness called was Mary Byrne. She men-
tioned that she lived in Thomas street. She saw only
one man strike Hanlon ; that man had on him a blue
coat; the same man broke Farrelly?s windows.
Marianne Crosby, a little girl about twelve years of
age, saw the said 12 or 13 men, with white coloured
sticks; if she saw any of them she did net think she
would know them ; young Farrelly told her that she had
two of them spotted (could identify them again) ; a little
boy named Darby D ayer, also said that he had five of
them spotted; she denied that she knew any of the men
or that she would be able to know them again.
An old woman named Mary Brock, positively declared
that she would not know the men again if they were
before her.
? Mr. Nicholas M?Cunn, the only volunteer evidence
in this business, was next sworn. The following was
his evidence. I reside in Walling-street, I was at first
40 yards from the rioters when they rushed ever towards
Hanlon. 1 saw the blows made by them, first up and
then down. They left the man and were coming away,
when I hea�-d one amongst them say, ? Slop?come
back.? The combinators immediately turned, and I saw
them break Fanelly?s windows. They then attacked the
man lying on the ground ; some of them leaped down
on, and over his body. Another man struck him on
the head. J think I would identify the man who
struck the deceased. That was a young, sallow, man,
and had little black whiskers. lie had on a kersey
coat, and I think it was a dark grey. I cannot tell
whether I could identify the others until I see them.
lam sure i should know the man; he is Jess than 30
years of age. Fitzsimons, Magrath, and the others were
here brought into the room, and he said he could not
identify any of them, until Colgan was brought into the
room. Mr, M?Cann, after closely examining him, said,
? That person is very like the man. The dress is different,
but the frame is very like,?
A note was at this time received from the magistrates,
and handed to the coroner, advising him to shorten the
inquest as much as possible, as the publication would be
injurious to the ends of justice, ana from the names of
the murderers transpiring through the papers, thev
would be able to get out of the way. The coroner re-
quested the reporters for the Dublin papers not. to
mention what was stated this day. The following was
the verdict returned by the jury ??? We find that the
said Thomas Hanlon came by his death in consequence
of desperate wounds inflicted upon his person by a
number of men at present unknown, who, �n Friday, the
18th instant, at Thomas-street, in the city of Dublin,
between the hours of six and seven o?clock in the
afternoon, did, with bludgeons and weapons, felo-
niously attack, and, with most inhuman, barbarous, and
premeditated violence, raurdor the said Thomas Han-
lon.?
TREATMENT OF TRANSPORTED FELONS
IN NEW SOUTH WALES.
The following letter, addressed to Mr. Wontner, the
Governor of Newgate, and received within the last
week, has been read by most of the high official and
judicial authorities now in London, who have expressed
an unanimous opinion that the publication of the con-
tents would be calculated to serve the cause of virtue,
by deterring from the perpetration of crime those who
erroneously suppose that transportation is a bed of
roses[: ?
Respected Sir, ?I have heard with great grief that
Messrs. (his old employers) have been again
plundered, and ray name has again been brought before
the public, as having relapsed into bad courses in this
distant land. This information is totally incorrect.
Immediately upon my landing, in October, 1827, roy
shipmates and I were assigned to settlers up the coun-
try. The master I was then assigned to is still living,
and I can have his testimonials as t� the blaraelessness
of my conduct. I have also the strongest testimonials
of good conduct under the surgeon superintendent?s
own hand, during my passage out, -when I acted as his
assistant, Mr. L was very anxious to gain me
some situation suitable to me, but the letters he wrote
to the secretary were neglected by the chief mate, who
was to send them on shore ; and X was in consequence
assigned to my present employer, as his excellency had
signed his name, and it could not be reversed, like the
laws of the Medes and Persians. Thus, by the negli-
gence of one man, I have become a settler?s man. 1
do not disguise truth from you; I have been most
miserable in this most unhappy land. I have suf�
fered every degradation in life ; insults upon insults
have been heaped upon me; I have been obliged
to associate with the most depraved of human
beings, my master?s men* Separated from all hopes of
comfort and enjoyment, debarred from all religious
worship, I have been ready to murmur at the de-
crees of the Almighty. What can 1 say to you ? I
have been living 150 miles from Sydney,' up the
mountain, 40 miles from any church or settlement. I
see no one from month to month but a black native.
The voice of prayer is never heard, and ail is blas-
phemy and wickedness; and although my master
has latterly made me his house servant, and places
much confidence in me, my situation is but little, if
anything, improved. I receive no wages, no induce-
ment, unless I plunder him, and that I hope, by God?s
help, I shall never do. He is a man whom it is very
difficult to please ; but I weary you, and I shall take
ray leave of the subject, with observing, that I have
laboured in the field at all kinds of toil, under a meri.
dian sun ; that I am become alike indifferent to com-
forts of ail kinds. When lam hungry I eat?when 1
am thirsty 1 drink ; I receive my mess as another.
Hunger is our sauce. We grind in a hand-mill we
bake in the ashes, and live in miserable huts, which
admit both wind and rain. A sheet of cork and a
bundle of straw is curbed, and a blanket our covering ;
but fatigue is ours, and we sleep as well as if on beds of
down. A shirt and duck trowsers form our dress. I
have learned to reap, to, shear sheep, to fell timber, to
burn it off?in short, I can do almost all laborious
work.
? Thus, my kind, much-respected sir, I have given
you a slight sketch of my life. lam most miserable
and disappointed. I know my sentence, although
severe, is just; yet I was in hopes that my occupation
would have been more suitable to my abilities. Is it, I
ask, no punishment to be thus sent 17,000 miles from
rny native country ? Gracious God ! could the rising
youth have but a single glance of the prisoner in New
South Wales, they would surely shun the temptation to
crime. The slightest offence provokes flogging; inso-
lence is the grand bug-bear in the colony; for this I
have seen some men sent to an iron-gang, to work in
chains, and be half-famished, or tied up to receive the
ignominioustfpunishment of 50 or 75 lashes. Shame
on the name of Englishmen ! A man, who calls him-
self a settler, first imposes upon his slaves and goads
them on to speak, and then drags them before a
magistrate to be lashed and tortured for insolence!
It is useless to murmur, for complaint is a crime
in this dreadful spot. A master up the country is
a petty king, and the spirit in which he exercises his
power is truly diabolical. If his slave speaks, the
wretch?s stomach is taxed. We all feel a tenfold de-
gradation ; we feel that we are slaves to paltry tyrants,
who seem as if they were bo m to add to the stings and
tortures of the wretched criminal. It is this feeling
which leads to that apathy complained of amongst ser-
vants. If a government servant sees his master?s pro-
perty going to ruin, it is ten to one that he passes on,
and takes no notice: he argues that it is no interest of
his, and thus the settler, by not studying his men?s
interests, forgots his own. The men receive no wages,
and not sufficient clothing, True the authorities will
say, 4 Why do you not complain to us ? and it shall
be remedied ;? but do you think that many will or dare
complain, when they know the authorities will support
the settler, and that the master is sure to take his re-
venge ? Tea, sugar, and tobacco, are called indul-
gences, and rest with the discretion of the master, who
seldom forgets to use his power like a giant. With re-
spect to liberty, it is a thing that few now get possession
of; a Lifer must serve eight years with one master, ten
years with two, and one year additional for every add.L
tional master. The smile of bitterness comes nxy
face whilst I write this ; may God enable me to over-
come this sensation. Why is a man debarred all chance
of liberty whose conduct may be irreproachable ? Much
of the misery and crime committed by convicts may be
attributed to the almost total extinction of their hopes
of liberty. As to myself, I once thought of a mitiga-
tion, but all hopes are gone; I am like a piece of
mechanism ; my spirit \s so much broken by disappoint-
ments and hardships, that I feel a dreadful spirit of in-
difference creep upon me?-rny life appears a blank, and
futurity is ray only source of expectation. One step
alone appears before me; I shall consider of it twelve
months, and then make ray election,?
The unhappy writer of this letter is, as our readers
must perceive, a man not devoid of education. He is
young, and happened to fall into the snares of another
Milwood, who first prevailed upon him to commit petty
robberies upon his employers, and then threatened to
inform them if he did not continue to administer to her
necessities and prodigality by more extensive depreda-
tions. He was detected,, and the moment his good for-
tune deserted ium, his destroyer sneered at and aban-
doned

The arrival of the American frigate Constitution at

SUICIDE AT AVINGTON, HANTS.
An inquest was held at the village of Avingtou, on
Monday last, before J. IT. Todd, Esq., coroner of
Hants, on view of the body of a young woman, by the
name of Mary Bendle, cook-maid in the service ot the
liev. C. S. Bennett, rector of that parish, Who destroyed
herself by poison the preceding day. No cause whatever
could be certainly assigned for the unnatural deed, the
deceased never having confided her secret to any one ;
Jmt it was believed to have arisen from the real or sup-
posed inattention of a young man, for whom she enter-
tained an attachment. Her disposition had always been
melancholy, and her apprehension dull, but not a single
instance could be adduced of mental alienation, nor such
a change in her recent behaviour as could justify Its pre-
sumption. On the contrary, the very manner in which
the unfortunate girl efFectsd and endeavoured to conceal
her self-destruction, bespoke too plainly the presence of
perfect consciousness acd self-command. The circum-
stances of her death were briefly these. About ten days
ago, the deceased sent, by the village messenger or post-
man, to Alresford for a small quantity of arsenic, for the
purpose, as she asserted, of destroying mice, desiring
him at the same time to say nothing about it. The arse-
nic was procured accordingly, and delivered to her un-
der two covers, marked with the word ? poison,? and no
suspicion was excited. About seven o?clock on Sunday
evening, the deceased, more depressed than usual, retired
to her bed-room, where she was immediately followed
by a younger fellow servant, in whose presence she mixed
up some white powder in a tea-cup of warm water, st irred
it with her finger, and drank it off. To repeated in-
quiries from her fellow servant, she replied that it was
magnesia, or some other stuff which the doctors gave ber�
A portion of the powder having settled at the bottom of
the cup, she poured in more water, stirred it as before,
and drank it off five or six times, still leaving a sedi-
ment. She then drank a quant?ty of warm water and
got into bed. Her almost immediate iilness,
however, and the particular anxiety she evinced
about the small portion of the powder ytt re-
maining in the tea-cup. excited suspicions in the
mind of her fellow-servant, who became alarmed on
tasting the mixture, and expressed her fears that it was
not magnesia, but poison. The deceased, however,
repeated her assertion, and appeared unwilling to enter
into conversation. At length her sickness became so
violent, that the servants acquainted their mistress, who
instantly repaired to her room, and questioned he ? very
closely as to what she had taken. The deceased for a
long time persisted in denying that it was any thirg bus
magnesia, but at last, on a second visit, and bei: i re-
peatedly urged, she acknowledged that she had lakerx
poison. Surgeons were immediately sent for, but oa
their arrival she retracted her confession, and renewed
her former assertions. The symptoms however, and the
cncumstanccs already detailed, contradicted this state-
ment, and proper antidotes and remedies were admi-
nistered, but without effect. After suffering acutely,
she expired about two o?clock on Sunday morning, to
the last moment persisting in the denial of the fact, and
refusing to assign any cause for its perpetration. The
body, on post mortem examination, presented the usual
evidence of death by arsenic; and the sediment in the
tea-cup being analysed, was proved to consist of that
poison.
The jury returned an unanimous verdict of r ? Felo
de se, ? and the body was privately buried in Avington
churchyard without the rights of Christian burial, at
Ho clock the same night.
There have been five attempts at self-destruction in
three of them proving fatal, within a tori-
EXECUTION OF DAVID EVANS.
Carmarthen, Monday, Sept. 21.
At ten o?clock this morning the wretched culprit
David Evans, convicted of the wilful murder of Hannah
Davies on the night of Saturday, the 13th day of June
last, on Pencarreg mountain, in this county, was brougrt
out on the top of the county gaol, where the scaffold was
erected, to undergo the awful penalty of the law accord-
ing to his sentence. The unfrequency of crimes of this
atrocious description in the principality, may account
for the agitated interest created by this approaching ca-
tastrophe. Before the hour of seven this morning an
immense concourse of people, horsemen and pedestrians,
were seen approaching the town from all parts of tha
country to witness the execution ; and when added to
almost the whole population of the town, already waiting
in front of the gaol, the crowd presented an enormous
mass seldom witnessed at a single glance. When the
unhappy man at length appeared, pinioned and prepared
for the last scene of his earthly career, the shock evinced
among the populace was affecting in the extreme. The
prisoner himself showed unusual firmness, and without
much pausing dropped the handkejehief, the fatal signal
to launch him into eternity, when the stand beneath his
feet was withdrawn, and, horrid to relate, the iron chain
attached to the gallows, through which the rope was
reeved, gave way, and in an instant down dropped this
unhappy being, and alighted on his feet, from which b�
fell ror an instant, but without any assistance rose again,
it seems he was no stranger to that vulgar error pro-
verbial among the lower classes, that when the rope
breaks a reprieve or pardon is the convict?s due by imme-
morial custom. Accordingly, when he gained his feee
a second time, he demanded his life, saving, ** He had
been hanged once,and they had no more to do with him.*
Here it became the melancholy duty of those about him
to convince him to the contrary; but it was with much
difficulty he was brought up'a second time. When
every thing for the purpose was now carefully adjusted,
he dropped the handkerchief once more, and?the world,
closed on him forever,
Jn adverting to the accident above described, wo
cannot too severely censure the carelessness of the
county carpenter, whose neglect alone was the cause of 0
it. The great wonder is, that the gallows frame did not
sever and fall down altogether, as the carpenter had
most unaccountably omitted to put in the pins that were
to fasten the cross-beam to the perpendicular ones, so
that when the pressure came upon the chain which had
been passed round the cross-beam (to shorten it), that
beam gave a turn round, by which means the hook of the
chain that was fastened to a central hole became loosened
from its hold, and occasioned the very reprehensible dis-
order above described.
The following minutiae of attendant occurrences may
be added:?The prisoner was attended by the Rev. Mr,
Jones, the chaplain of the prison, and the Under Sheriff
L. O. Lew,s, Esq., to whom he expressed his unfeigned
thanks for his humane attentions. A thorough con-
fession of his crime, without the slightest reservation
adds highly to the weight of the atonement he has �nade,*
When divested of his irons and pinioned, he prayed with
the utmost fervency, walked steadily to the f a tal bt am
firmly underwent the ceremony of adjusting t fo e ro ?
and asked for the loan of a handkerchief * 0 gf YC t h e final

down and given to the surgeons for dissection.
Sam good for. Foxhounds?Sir Jacob Astley, of
Melton Constable, in Norfolk, gives about a table-
spoon!ul Ox salt pej; week to each of his foxhounds. It
keeps a way distempers, and preserves them in the best
health and vigour. It is administered wrapped up in
paper as a bolus.
Oa Tuesday last Sir A. Chichester?s hounds met at
Dulverton to run a stag. It was at first intended to try
Haddon?s covers, but on intelligence of a gcod stag at
Hawkbridge, this was abandoned. The pack was then
moved to Hynam, and two couple of tufters taken to
the potato garden, in which the deer was supposed to
have fed. On reaching the wood close by, they soon
acknowledged the scent, and carrying it to the Duns-
brook, hit him across, and preseatly roused him to
White-rocks. At first he took the top of the cover, but
soon turned down, crossing the Dunsbrook and th�
river Barle into Mounsey Castle: here the pack wfere
laid on, when they immediately found a fresh .staff,
which beat the covers so as completely to disturb
them. The consequence was, the division of the pack
into four parts, each having a deer ; a fine hind, with
one portion, took the moor, but was so hard pressed
after a few miles? gallop, as to be obliged to give it up!
and make for the river, which she reached just under
VV ithypoole, and was run into about a mile below that
village, oir Arthur was with this part of the pack, and
at first ordered she should be preserved on account of
her cal!; but as she proved a barrener, and not expect-
ing any other death, and deer so plenty, she was killed.
On reaching Dulverton it was discovered that a brace of
stags had also unfortunately fallen victims, one of them
the iattest killed for the last 16 years. It was impossible
to prevent the destruction, the hounds having severely
wounded them. To the true sportsman this was any
thing but a gcod day?s sport ; but the pedestrians, who
always muster strong in this part of the hunting dis-
trict, were never so highly gratified.? Western Lumi-

An inquest was yesterday taken by J. Unwin, Esq.
at the Angel publie-house,' Old Gravel-lane, on the
remains of Mr. Henry King, the son of the
proprietor, who was drowned near the Old London-
bridge, on evening of Sunday week. From
the evidence it appeared that the deceased, a
young man, aged 22, and iu the prime of life,
went, in company with Mr. Dale, a master-
waterman, and both his sisters (to one of whom
he was paying his addresses, and to whom he was
in a few days afterwards to be married) on an
excursion, on the day before-mentioned, to Rich-
mond. After passing their hours joyously there,
they returned in the evening on their way to
town?the tide being with them; but, as they ap-
proached London-bridge (the tide having fallen, and
the rapidity of the stream, of course, increased) th�
deceased and Mr. Dale (to prevent any alarm op
accident which might occur) landed their female
companions, and proceeded for the purpose of shoot*
ing the bridge. In this they succeeded, but as they
reached the conflux of waters, which is just neav
where the violence of the stream is about abatir.g,
the wherry was caught by a wave, upset, and the un-
fortunate deceased and his companion, Mr. Dale,
were plunged into the river, and drowned. The
bodies of both the unfortunate men were fonnd >
after the interval of a week, on the same dav?*
the one on the northern and the other on the southern
shores. Proof being given of the finding of the bodv,
and its identity, which from the length of time it was
in the water was somewhat difficult, the jury returned
a verdict of u Found Drowned.?

If the accounts from the east may be credited,
the Turkish empire is almost at an end. The
Sultan has thrown himself absolutely on the mercy
of the Emperor Nicholas,and will accept any terms
which his conqueror may choose to dictate. These
will he, in all probability, hard enough?the ces-
sion of all the provinces north of the Balkan, the
complete independence of Greece, the free pas-
sage of the Dardanelles, the possession of Trebi-
zonde, and other strong places on the Buxine,
and full indemnification for all the expences of
the war. Turkey then ceases to occupy any
space in the list of nations. Egypt is gone, and
Armenia going. When Wallachia, Moldavia,
Greece, and the islands are torn (rora her, her
hold upon the few European provinces left will
be frail enough; and the Asiatic provinces have
long yielded to the authority of the Sultan from
fear only. The necessity of preserving a due
balance of power in Europe, and of curbing the
already too great preponderance of Russia must
make an arrangement of Turkish affairs neces-
sary ; but the Turks will no longer be consulted.
Whatever the arrangement may be, it will be for
the sake of Europe, not of the Turks.
The truth appears to be, that even the Maho.
metan population was wearied of the bloody and
unimprovable despotism under which they la-
boured, and were happy to shake it off. The
overthrow of the Turkish empire in this point of
view is a blessing to mankind. It will open to
civilization and Christianity, blessings which are
? twinned, and from each other have no individual
being,? some of the fairest portions of the earth,
now crushed beneath the weight of cruel slavery,
and blind and senseless fanaticism. Other means
srill be found to keep Russia from disturbing the
liberties and independence of Europe ; let us not,
therefore, permit political fears to prevent us from
seeing much benefit to religion and humanity in
what has occurred.
No praise can be too high for the Russian Gene-
ral, Count Diebitsch Sabalkansk, as he is now call-
ed,? for his conduct during the campaign. He has
performed a feat never before, we believe, at-
tempted, and which was generally considered as
impossible-we mean the passage of Mount
Hannas from the north. He is a German, and
the Emperor, whose especial selection he was,
was much murmured against by the Russian
officers for appointing him over their heads.
All military men, however, and of all
countries, unite in his praise. The Duke of
Wellington is stated to have saida few days ago,
te I don?t know which is to be most admired,
the original plan of the campaign, or the combi-
lation of skill, courage, and caution, with which
t has been conducted; but this I do know, that
his single campaign places Diebitsch at the very
lead of his profession." We should be ridiculous
ideed, if, after praise from such a quarter, we .
eutured to add any opinion of our own.
