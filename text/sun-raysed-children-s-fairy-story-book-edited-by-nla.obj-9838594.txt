? SUN-RAYSED? Children?s Fairy Story Book.
What the Fairy told Dick and May.
?I'm putting out the light now,? said Dick and May?s mother, one night, as
they were tucked in their little beds ready for sleep.
? Mother,? said Dick.
? Yes, Dickie.?
May I have some more sweets, please??
No, dearie, you have had enough, and, besides, you will make yourself sick.?
? No, I won't, mother,? and then Dickie began to cry ; as this happened every
evening, his mother only switched off the light and left him.
? Don?t cry, Dickie,? said May; ? you don't want to be sick and not be able to go
to the picnic on Saturday, for we are going to have heaps of fun.?
But Dickie kept on crying.
Presently from the window way a sweet voice said, ? May I come in; 1 see
vou are in trouble?? and there tripped into the room the dearest little fairy you could
wish to see.
? Who are you?? said the children in one voice, for Dickie, in amazement, had
stopped crying.
? I am the good fairy SUN-RAYSED, and live in Australia, where I have a
grand vineyard, and grow such choice fruits, which are afterwards dried in the
rays of the sun ?hence my name. Let me sit on your beds and I will then tell you
how I make little boys and girls happy and healthy. Why were you crying just
now ??
? Mother won?t let me have any more sweets, because they make me ill,? said
Dickie, crying again.
? Don't crjq for I shall tell you how to make sweets that will not make you dJ,
and, besides, are very nourishing. First of all take SUN-RAY SED Currants, Sul-
tanas, and Lexias, and put them through a mincing machine, when you will find them
finely chopped, then roll them in desiccated cocoanut, and you will have the sweetest
sweets would love to have. In fairyland all the little Sun-Rays live on these
sweets and call them ? Good Little Normey.? ?
How lovely,? said May; ? mother must hear all about them
" Didn?t I hear you say you were going to a picnic? Well, make SUN-RAYSED
Fruit sandwiches; they are delicious. You?ll love them. In fairy land we call them
the ? Molly Sandwich,? for they are quite a novelty, and, of course, there will be
cakes also.?
?Tell mother to use my Currants, and Sultanas ;, she?ll find her cakes much
lighter and daintier than made with ordinary dried fruits.
By this time the children were asleep, and their troubles forgotten, but in the
morning were all eager to tell mother all the fairy had told them, for she had left
a packet of her fruits (on each bed), to remind them of her visit and her good
advice.

ABOUT THE BOOK.
Australian children should be taught to read Australian books.
This book is wholly and strikingly Australian.
Its contents are all about an Australian Industry. They are written by Aus-
tralian authors. The book is printed and illustrated by Australian printers and
artists.
Its purpose is to appeal to the imagination of Australian children, and to pro-
vide them with wholesome, enjoyable reading matter: at a price so low that it would
be impossible under ordinary conditions.
This book contains the 14 prize-winning Fairy Stories out of a total of 1358
entries in the SUN-RAYSED Competitions of January, 1919.
It also contains upwards of 80 prize-winning Rhynies, Limericks, etc., in the
same SUN-RAYSED Competitions.
The authors of the contents received upwards of �lOO in prizes for the excel-
lence of their efforts.
It should, therefore, be hard to find a production at the price (2/-) to approach
in value this SL X-RAT SED Children's Book, and, it is hoped, and believed, that a
tremendous sale will be achieved bv it.
Thus the ? growing Australian " will have the advantage of the ? matured
Australian " of the present day: for he or she will realise from boyhood or girlhood
what an important Australian Industry is represented by SUN-RAYSED FRUITS.
C. J. DeGaris, Adjudicator of SUN-RAYSED Competitions.

Sadie and the Sun-Ray.
Sadie sat watching her mother cooking. She looked at the lovely things on the
kitchen table. Flour, sugar, spices, butter, milk, eggs, and, best of all, the delicious
SUX-RAYSED Currants, Sultanas, and Lexias.
? Mother,? she asked, ? why do they say * SUN-RAY SED ' ??
? Because,? answered mother, ? the beautiful fruit is dried by the Sun s Rays.
? How driedf? said Sadie. ? What made it wet??
? Gracious,? said mother, ?it was not zoct. W hen first picked the grapes con-
tain too much moisture, and would not keep, so these, instead of being dried by
steam, as they are in some places, are dried by the health-giving Rays of our glorious
Southern Sun.?
? I told you not to talk. YTm may take six SUN-RAY SED Currants, six SUN-
RAYSED Sultanas, and six SUN-RAYSED Lexias. Eat them instead of asking
questions.?
Sadie counted the lovely SUN-RAY r SED fruit, and, putting a delicious SUN-
RAYSED Sultana in her mouth, sat very still in the warm kitchen.
Sadie was surprised at finding herself lying under a large mushroom in a pretty
fern gully. She stretched and looked around. Something warm touched her hand,
and she beheld the dearest, tiniest, little girl imaginable, with long curls, like a mass
of golden sunlight.
Smiling at Sadie, the little stranger explained, ? I?m a little Sun-Ray, so danced
down to talk to you.?
? Sun-Ray,? laughed Sadie, ? How nice.
? Crowds of us live in the Sun,? smiled the Sun-Ray, ? every morning we climb
down to work.?
? Work?? said Sadie.
? Y?es,? said the Sun-Ray, ? we ripen the fruit upon the vines, and
? Oh,? interrupted Sadie, ?do you make the SUN-RAYSED Sultanas and
things??
?We do,? gaily answered the Sun-Ray. ? They are Raisins Raised by the
Rays of the Southern Sun, that?s why they are called SUX T -RAYSED. If you hold
my hand tightly all the time, you may come tp Australia and see.?
Firmly Sadie grasped the Sun-Ray?s hand.
1 hey glided up a beautiful Sunbeam, that looked like a sparkling golden ladder.
Soon the tiny Sun-Ray skipped lightly across to another Sunbeam. Sadie, who was
holding her hand, did the same.
I his Beam was bigger than the first. Crowds of laughing Sun-Ravs danced
down the golden ladder.


Soon they reached the bottom. Sadie laughed with delight at the sight.
Hundreds of racks, covered with all sorts of delicious fruits were spread in long
rows, and all around were dancing, shining beautiful Sun-Rays, while down the
Sunbeam sped more dainty, golden, merry, little Sun-Rays skipping among the
fruit, turning and kissing it, making it smell sweet and enticing.
Sadie jumped joyously ; forgetting her promise to hold her Sun-Ray's hand,
she danced towards a huge rack of SUX-RAYSED Sultanas, taking a great hand-
ful to taste.
There was a dreadful clatter!!
Sadie had rolled on to the kitchen floor, a packet of SUX - RAYSED Sultanas
in her arms, spilling all over her.
Mother laughed and said Sadie had been asleep and dreaming.
Sadie knew better, for shining, in the window, was a beautiful Sunbeam, and
on it, by the window-sill, sat a tiny smiling Sun-Rav.

To good-tempered Mrs. Flynn;
Butter, eggs, treacle, and cheese,

? There," said dear old Mrs. Flvnn,
Tucking all the ? goodies ? in.'
Tommy Brown returned from town
On his little pony.
Mother searched the parcels through;
Tommy stood by looking blue.
For no traces could she find
Of ST SED Fruits of any kind
? Why, Tommy boy, come here, come

MARY?S CAKE.
Mary made a Xmas cake,

And as each friend of Mary's called
She gave a slice to them.
? What gives your cake that flavour

Her friends did ask of Mary.
"Ese SL X-RAYSED Fruits, Aus-
tralia?s line,
And you 11 soon know,? said Mary.
So when her friends the secret knew
They really were delighted.
For good advice like that, thev said,
By no one should be slighted.
Then Mary's friends, too, used the
fruits,
V\ Inch daily grew in favour.
And ST X-RA\ SED is the household
word.
Because of their fine flavour.

Ray and the Sun-Rays Fairies.
On a lovely hillside among beautiful orchards and vineyards in the charming
SUN-RAYSED fruit country, there lived a blue-eyed curly-haired little maiden
named ? Ray."
One bright spring morning as she sat admiring the pink and white blossom of
the orchards and vineyards, and the soft blue and white of the sky above, she was
carried right away to ? Fairy-Land.??
The great sun became a marvellous palace of crystal and golden light, and the
bright beams that streamed down were all golden pathways leading straight to the
great Sun Palace.
She quickly made her way along one of the Royal highways, and presently she
saw approaching, what appeared to be myriads of bright stars, which she suddenly
discovered, however, were fairies! Wonderful, glorious fairies !! ?with charming
faces, shining wings and dainty dresses. They each carried a pearl-like chalice, in-
scribed with the mystic letters, ?C. S. L.," and containing a very rare treasure,
which they guarded most carefully.
? Who are you, little girl?' ?they enquired sweetly of Ray.
? Ray of the SUN-RAYSED fruit country," she answered.
? Quite remarkable, for we are the ? Sun-Rays ' fairies, and you shall now come
with us, lor we are going to pay our respects to the ? Queen of the SUN-RAYSED
Grapes,? and to present to her the offering of the great Sun-King."
Altogether enchanted, Ray soon found herself with her bright companions at
the entrance to the Queen's Palace, right in the heart of the country where the SUN-
RAYSED fruits are grown. Fairy-bells announced the arrival of the visitors, and
the ? Queen " of the SUN-RAYSED grapes, brilliant in purple and pearls, came
forth, bowing and smiling, to meet them.
" Welcome, my Royal friends!? she said, ? once again you have brought me the
gracious gift of the Great Sun-King, and I thank you with all my heart.?
" Go forth I pray you, and enrich with the magic charm of your priceless ? C. S.
L. everv vine of my vast domains, that I mav again gather abundantlv of my un-
rivalled SUN-RAYSED Fruits.
? The great world is?
(1) ? Calling for my SUN-RAYSED Currants!
(2) ? Sighing for my SUN-RAYSED Sultanas!
(3) ? Longing for my SUN-RAYSED Lexias!
and they must not be disappointed.?
Forming into a fantastic and yet beautiful procession, they immediately began
to carry out the Queen s behests, and, behold! the most perfect clusters of luscious
grapes hung from the vines.


Now the fairies loved the SUN-RAYSED fruits country above an)q and they
remained there all the summer perfecting the fruit.
At last they plucked some of the clusters and presented them to the Queen
? Matchless!" she exclaimed proudly, ?your marvellous ?C. S. L.' has again
triumphed, and the happiness of thousands is now assured!"
? What did the Queen mean by ? C. S. L.' ?" enquired Ray of a fairy near her.
? Concentrated Sun-Light,?? whispered the fairy confidentially. ? That is the
great secret, my child. That is what makes the SUN-RAYSED Fruits so delightful,
and quite unsurpassed.?
? Oh, now I understand what made our cakes 'and pudding last Christmas
nicer than ever before ?
?We used only SUN-RAYSED Fruits?
? That was it," smiled the fairy; ? depend upon it, and see that you never forget
it, and see that vou and all vour boy and girl friends get the habit ?SL TN-
RAYSED.?
Second Prize, �3, won by Miss Ellen Foden, 28 Sydney Street, Collingzvood.
SUN-RAYSED.
Welcome, SUN-RAYSED ?here you
are ?
Waited for by near and far;
Holding forth your magic name
Like an Anzac born to fame,
Other Brands upon the field.
To your power now must yield:
They no purpose now fulfil ?
Just like poor old Kaiser Bill.
When the maid begins to bake,
Rich and sweet Sultana cake;
Peeping through it, there you are,
Like the little twinkling star.
Merry children o?er the lands
Smack their lips and stretch their
hands;
SUN-RAYSED Raisins when in sight,
Mean a time of great delight.
And the lone hand in his ? batch."
Eagerly doth at you snatch:
SUN-RAYSED smile upon his face
Tells what?s going to take place.

Did you ever hear the story
Of the Princess who lay ill.
And not all her wealth and glory
Could her life with sunshine fill ?
Though they doctored her with savors
Brought from many a distant land,
o J
Fruits of strange, unpleasant flavours
That were bottled down ?or canned.
Till a brave Australian Major,
Who upon the Princess gazed,
Quickly cried, ? I?m game to wager
She has never tried SUN-
RAYSED."
For SUN-RAYSED is finely flavoured
By the rays of light and sun;
And its fame has never wavered
From the place its worth has won.
It is grown in fair Australia,
Where the skv is alwavs bright.
- , o ?
And the fruit is ne'er a failure,
And A.D.F.A. spells ? RIGHT.?
So he sent a SUN-RAYSED cluster
As.a dainty offering ?
They?re the best the world can muster
Raisins fit to give a King.
And the SUN-RAYSED cured the
Princess,
And she promptly asked for more,
Now that surely should convince us
SUN-RAYSED'S good, both cooked

I am told they soon were married,
And she made a lovely bride,
While the bonny bridesmaids carried
Baskets full of SUN-RAYSED?

OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.
There was an old woman who lived in a
shoe,
Her children were many ?some old, and
some new.
Young Tom, with an appetite as big as
a horse.
And Sadie's which grew as she grew ?
yes, of course,
Then her poor little Tim; oh. so delicate
he.
She feared that some day he would no
longer be.
And others of ages of from ten years to
two.
For money she knew not sometimes
what to do!
In sad meditation she wandered one day
To the store in the town, with but little
to pay;
Then gazed in the window ?and
straight as a dart
A warm ray of sunshine lit up her sad
heart,
For there in bright packets and row
upon row,
M ere dried fruits ?SUN-RAYSED ?
in so tempting a show.
Yet they were not put there the moneyed
to lure.
The prices were fixed for the rich and
the poor.
Our dame is now known for her satisfied
air,
For SUX-RAYSED have lightened
her mind of much care.
She knows how Tom's appetite best to
appease,
And well ?for he?s growing a young
Hercules.
And small Tim has strengthened at such
a huge pace,
-Mas! He can flatten young Jim (next
door's) face.
The children so love them and clamour
for more.
She really by now must have bought up
the store.

The Magic Word.
1 wonder, my darling, if you have heard the story of Sun-Ray, the Three
Brownies, and the Magic Word? If not, ask mother to read it now.
A Brownie, you know, is littler than a robin redbreast; with big green eyes and
brown moth wings.
Once upon a time three little Gum-Tree Brownies, called Sunny, Honey and
Bunny, lived in a hollow log in Australia. Deep under the ground, in their little
workshop, they made lovely Currants, Sultanas, and Lexias, by using a Magic Word
no one else knew.
Sunny made them golden ripe, Honey made them juicy-sweet, and Bunny made
them plumpey-round.
The Brownies tied the fruits on good children's grape-vines, the Fathers dried
them in the sunshine; the Mothers mixed them into Christmas puddings and cur-
ranty buns for children and soldier boys to eat up and ask for ? More please!"
The mother who made the ? scrummiest " pudding-pies had a dear little girl
called Sun-Ray. Sun-Ray never trapped bunnies or broke down golden wattle-
blossom, because she had shell-pink fairy ears, and could hear the little silver speech
of the fairies. So how could she rob a nest when the birdie-mother cried:?
? Sun-Ray, love my babies ?f
But Sun-Ray could not hear the Brownies? Magic Word. They did not want
others to know it, for fear the fruits would all be eaten. They hid it in their hearts
all day, and, at bed-time, when they cuddled under their gum-leaves, they locked it in
a gum-nut, which they kept, turn about, under their pillows.
One summer dawn Sunny called ?
? Wake, little Brother Honey!
Its Christmas-pudding time!
Where is the Magic Word??
? Bunny has it!" said Honey.
? Sunny has it!" said Bunny.
But nobody had it; it was lost.
" Why were we so selfish?? the Brownies sobbed. ? Nobody knows the Fairy
Word now, except the wicked Goblins, Catchit, Snatchit, and Scratchit, who have
stolen it!"
1 he Brownies tried to make fairy fruits without the Magic Word, but the fruits
were all skin and pip ; The poor little fellows must have died, if Sun-Ray had not
chanced along with her fairy ears.
" What is wrong, little brothers?? she whispered.
" The Fairy Word is lost!? they wailed.
If I find it, said Sun-Ray, ? will you promise faithful-true to let all people
know it ? 1 hen they can all grow and eat fairy fruit, and be happy.?


?We promise!? they squeaked.
And ?wasn?t it a surprise??Sun-Ray opened her hand, and inside was the
gum-nut, with the Magic Word singing like a sea-shell. For Sun-Ray, passing
the Goblins? hidey-hole. had heard the Fairy Word sobbing, and had stamped on the
Goblins, and wicked Goblins always die, when a good child tramples on them.
Now, when the Magic Word began to sing, the raisins popped out on the vines,
and the puddings popped into the pots, and Sun-Rav ran home singing the Magic

The New Fairy.
It would never have happened if Peggy?s little friend Betty, had not given her a
kewpie for a*' good-bye present," just as the train started oft' for the Irrigation
Settlement.
No one guessed the hand the fairies would have in it all ?or that this particular
kewpie would be turned into a real live fairy.
Peggy was disappointed with the new home at first, for it was winter, and the
trees and vines looked like poor dead sticks, and it rained so that she and Tom had
to play indoors all day.
After ever so long, it stopped raining, and they went outside to look round,
and then they made mud pies till mother called them in to tea.
That was how Peggy forgot her Kewpie, and left it lying in the grass.
The fairy Queen held her Court that night, for it was full moon ?Puck, the
Queen?s messenger, delivered the invitations himself, and all the fairies came.
The winter fairies had King Frost for their leader, and Queen Sun-Ray led the
summer fairies, and each carried a Ray of Sunshine for a wand.
Puck was the last to arrive, for on his way he found Kewpie and brought him
along, too. All the fairies were very excited, and said, ? Let us make him into a
fairy, too.?
The winter fairies tried first?they waved their icicles and sang, but Kewpie
still remained a doll. Then the summer fairies waved their Sun-Ray wands, and
he sat up and smiled.
? The new fairy must be christened,??said the Queen. ? Who will prepare the
Christening Feast??
o
I," said Sun-Ray. ?It will be ready next autumn.?
Then they all flew home: for the moon was setting. Queen Sun-Ray flew over
the vineyards, and all the summer fairies followed with their sunshine wands.
In and out, in and out, they danced, till the leaves woke up and grew; then the
flowers, and then fruit.
Such lovely grapes ! Some large and some small, bunches and bunches of them.
In and out, in and out, they danced till they were all ripe. Then men cut the
bunches and put them on trays to dry.
Still the fairies, with their Sun-Rays, danced over the trays till they were turned
into the most beautiful Currants, Sultanas, and Lexias that you ever tasted.
The christening was on the first full moon in autumn.
Kewpie was called the Luckv Fairv,? and his big pink sash made lovely
wings to fly with.
He was so good-natured that every fairy loved him, and he w r as made a mes-
senger tor Queen Sun-Ray. The fairies alf said it was just the loveliest Christen-
ing beast that ever was.


Now the fairies only ate very few of the Dried Fruits ?Peggy?s father sent
them to the grocers, where we can buy them.
He called them SUN-RAYSED Fruits because the Sun-Rays made them, but
he didn?t know that the fairies danced with the Rays for wands. He thought they
were only butterflies; but soon all mothers and all fathers and all boys and girls, will
know all about the beautiful SUN-RAYSED Fruits.

The Three Fairies.
On New Year's Eve, 1887, Mildura aborigines were camped at Pinkey Bend.
About midnight they were visited by William M. Paterson and his daughter Ellen
(aged eight years), from Mildura station. The Patersons loved the aborigines;
they were ? first footing ? ?observing an old Scottish custom. Cake and sweets
were supplied by Ellen, and, after partaking of the good things, Sandv, an old bow-
legged aboriginal, said:
? Is big fellow coming make fruit grow?"
Mr. Paterson said, ? Two big white fellows from America.?
Sandy said, ? Him two fella big fairies.??
Ellen said, ** Have you any fairies?"
Sandy replied, ? Mine fellas good fairies. Make ?em nardoo grow alonga billa-
bong, make 'em planty kangaroo."
He whispered to Ellen, ? You go alonga bed, let window open. Fairies come to-
< night tall you, after ?you come tella me."
ca " -11
They returned home, Ellen left her window open, and she tried to keep awake,
* but a fairy named Irymple, kept closing her eyes, and when he got tired one named
|| Koorlong helped him.
Ellen was very sleepy, so the fairy Merbein put her to sleep. The fairies then
2 ran to Mrs. Paterson's kitchen, and found some raisins, which, after taking out the
j= seeds, they ate.
aj
Y\ hen they had done so, Merbein said, ? We will go to Ellen's room, charm
g her, and cause her to plant these cuttings. Then we will return to our dell, remain
Ifor a year, and then return to view to-night?s work.?
They danced and sang round Ellen's bed, and Ellen smiled in her sleep as each
touched her forehead and said, ? Remember."
They put three vine cuttings on her table and departed.
Ellen awakened early, and, remembering every incident of the fairies, she arose,
gathered the cuttings, and, after placing them in a place of safety, asked permission
to visit the aborigines. Permission being given, she went out and found them.
All excitedly, she said, ? Three little fairies, each as long as my thumb, came
to my bed last night, and one rude fellow sat on my forehead, with his heels on my
eyelids, and when he removed them I looked up and smiled. The second made my
eyes tired, and the third put me to sleep.
" Y\ hile I slept, each touched my forehead and said. ? Remember,? and they
danced and sang. ' Let the Fruit Grow.' They put three cuttings on my table, and
one said, I m Irymple, one is mine, it will be a Sultana.' Another said.
I m Koorlong, one is mine, and it will be a Gordo.' The third said,
"'lm Merbein, one is mine, and it will be a Currant.? ?


? Plant where the Sun-Rays will strike from morn till eve; they will grow, and
return bright gold. Men will till the soil and be happy in the years to come. A
name will be sought for the fruit thereof, and he who decides the name must not for-
get that the fruit are SUN-RAYSED."
? Then they ran away, and they won't return for a year; but I?ve got the cut-
ting, so Sandy, (Ruggy), Jerry, Archie, Mulcca and Whorlong, you all must come,
bring water from the Billabong, and we will plant the fairy cuttings. The sun will
make them grow into vines, and I am sure of this because the three fruit-loving
fairies said so.
The fairies' directions given in 1887 to the then unknown adjudicator were not
neglected, and Australian Dried Fruits will be known throughout the world as
SUN-RAYSED Fruits.

Some Fairie-Lore.
In Fairyland, where joy and gaiety abound, one day was heard a sigh.
Quickly the fairy Queen summoned all her subjects, and the ? wee folk trooping
all together," assembled under a huge grape vine loaded with rich clusters. Here,
invisible to mortal eyes (while no mortals were near, though) the Queen addressed
her tiny subjects.
Fairies, why so sad? In this sunny Australia only smiles and dances are in
order. Why, then, did I hear a sigh??
Lp spoke a sweet little rosy mite: " Your Majesty, there is sighing among the
mortals, and we but echo their sad refrain. We are the guides and guardians of
mortal children, and it grieves us when they grieve.?
? But why grieve?? asked the Queen, ? Have they not all that children need ?
sunshine, fresh air, and good food, and peace??
" Ah, your Majesty,? said another fairy, ? they have good food, plenty to spare,
but these mortals do not all know which is good food. If they would, like we fairy
sprites, live on pure dew, sunshine and ripe fruit, their lives would be so happy and
their sleep so sweet. Dear Queen, tell us how we may help the mortals, to know
what food is best??
? Mortal children, said the Queen, ? have denser bodies than fairies and must
eat to keep those bodies strong but pure. They want food grown in the sunshine,
that the sun's rays have ripened.?
Here a lovely band of fairies danced up in great excitement.
" \es, your Majesty; it is so, and here we are, fairies from Australia, where
the SL N-RAYSED Fruit is grown. We know, for we help to grow it. That's the
food for mortals. Tell us how to make them know??
" If we were mortals," said the Fairy Queen. ? we should ? advertise,? as they
call it, for that most appeals to mortals which can be seen, tasted, smelt and touched.
But we fairies need no such sense satisfying, we will trv fairv methods.
" Come to me by troops, my children, each troop to its allotted task. Go to the
places where mortals sleep, and whisper of trees, sunshine, vines, grapes and
flowers. W'hile bodies are resting in sleep, talk to the souls.?
" Show pictures of fruit ripening in the Sun's Rays, and suggest the idea
SLN-RATSED. Show to mothers happy children eating SUN-RAYSED fruit.
Whisper to fathers to buy SUN-RAYSED fruit for the children.
i ell the tired grocer-man to sell onlv SUN-RAYSED goods if he wants to
make money. Find out the commercial travellers, and sav, ? SUN-RAYSED are
best.?
Brighten the printer s colours, as he makes pictures of SUN-RAYSED
Fruits. Tell the children to ask for lunch sandwiches made with SUN-RAYSED
Raisins.


? Suggest to the cook that SUN-RAYSED Fruit make best cakes. Go on this
mission, fairy messengers, to mortals."
Well did the fairies do their work. From sleep the children woke, thinking of
Sun's Rays ripening grapes into raisins for them.
Mothers said. ?Of course, Lexias, Currants, and Sultanas are good when
SUN-RAYSED.*?
Fathers said, ? Put raisins on the tea table with the nuts
The grocer put SUN-RAY SED goods in his shop window with the printer's
lovely pictures to show it.
And with good SUN-RAYSED food came good health, and sweet tempers for
everybody.

The ? SUN-RAYSED ? Fairies
\\ hen 80-peep arrived at the fairy palace for the annual ball, to her surprise
everybody was talking at once, the palace seemed all excitement.
What it was all about was more than she could say. Policeman Kookaburra
seeing 80-peep, flew to her and told her the great news that had taken Fairyland by
surprise.
? The Old \\ oman who lived in a shoe had not come to court,? said Tacky, ? she
was seen by some of the other fairies sailing down the River Murray with all her
children on board.?
? That s nothing unusual, said 80-peep, " that old woman is always doing
something funny; perhaps she will send word whv she is not coming here.?
Just then came the fairy postman on his butterfly coach, and handed the King
a note from the old woman.
Of course, all the fairies wanted to know the news, and evervbodv was very
still.
?I have gone to live in a place where there are a new kind of fairies, called
SL N-RA\ SED. These fairies have made my children strong and good-looking.
\ou know how plain they were, and, oh, so thin!! This food is cheap and plentiful,
so I have decided to stav.?
?I am sending you a sample. Tour Majesty, I beg of you to give each fairv a
taste of this wonderful food.
I have seen where these SLN-RAT SED Fairies go; after they have given
themselves to mortals.?
The kind mortals put them in buckets, and then on a rack which is built out
in the sun.?
There they get a sun-bath, and are afterwards sent to a factory, where they
are made beautiful, and put into boxes and sent all over the world to feed mortals.
I his is the greatest honour you can give to the fairies after they have finished
with the life on the vine.?
\\ hen the letter was read, the King ordered everv fairy to have a new dress
for the feast.
1 hat meant work for the spiders, for they are the fairy dressmakers. Some
of the dresses which Madame Spider creates are beautiful.
One wee fairy sitting on a bluebell had a dress which resembled the colours of
the sunset stitched with silver threads.
1 here was plenty of work for the fairv newspaper man.
The mushroom tables were spread, and on each rose petal plate was put a taste
of SUN-RAYSED Fruit.
hairy waiters poured out dewdrop wine in tiny cowslip cups, and everybody
drank the health of the A.D.F.A. Currant. Sultana, and Lexia Fairies.


Take a lesson from the fairies, little children, eat plenty of SUN-RAYSED
Fruits. Then you will be healthy, wealthy and strong.
JJ 7 o
Look after the vine, for that is where the Currant, Sultana, and Lexia Fairies
live. What a sight when they have their summer clothes on, dressed in purple,

is to eat ?and keep on eating SUN-RAYSED Fruits.

Prince Wait and See.
Can you guess how the Prince got his name? Young and good-looking he fell
in love, and, being a Prince, it was but natural he should think that he should have
his own way. So he sought out his father, King Lexias, and told him he proposed to
marry the beautiful Princess SUN-RAYSED. To his consternation, the wise old
King shook his head.
?Was not SUN-RAYSED the most exquisite girl in the whole land?? de-
manded the Prince. ? Could the King deny her beautv??
? Tis not of SUN-RAYSED I was thinking,? observed the King; ? ?tis of your-
self, my son. You have not yet shown yourself worthy of being the" husband of any
woman. Prove yourself first.?
The Prince bit his lip. ? What do you mean, sire??
? Do something, my son, that will be of use to the kingdom,? said King Lexias.
? Show yourself a man?l have no use for idlers. After that, you may marry whom
you please.?
That evening towards sunset, with the Kookaburras? chorus resounding over-
head, the Prince confided to SUN-RAYSED all that the King had said. And, walk-
ing there under the trees, SUN-RAYSED whispered, ?Go forth, dearest, and find
something to help our country. My prayers will go with thee on thy quest.?
On this the Prince boarded a ship, and. as the sails were hoisted. King Lexias,
Queen Sultana and the people cheered, and SUN-RAYSED waved a silken scarf. ?
Some months later, a bronzed and smiling Prince returned, and, from the ship
they took great boxes, iron tied. And seeing them the people cried, ? Look at the
money he hath brought. Bravo!?
* o
But when the boxes were prized open, and the people looking in saw' nothino-
- bundles of dried sticks, they exclaimed, ? How now! What is this you have
brought to fool us??
And the Prince smilingly replied, ? Wait and see,?
I hen, by his orders, men began to clear the countryside, and plough it up, and
fence it. And presently, with his own hands, the Prince planted in measured
rows the sticks he had brought from overseas. Rain fell, the sun shone, and each
stick burst forth into leaf.
? What is it you bring us?? the people asked.
And, smiling again, the Prince answered, ? Wait and see.?
Then posts and wires were set along the rows, and the plants trained on them
until one sunny morning the Prince sought out his mother. Queen Sultana.

The little Sun-Fairies, with their gay, golden gowns, worked and played all day
among the long, long rows of vines that grew in the open, sunny fields. They
danced in and out among the pretty shady leaves, beneath which were hidden
clusters of tiny green balls.
Each fain can led a little bright wand made of Sun-Rays, with which to per-
form all manner of wonderful works that would change the wee sour balls into
delicious fruits for you and me to eat.
While the grapes were babies, the fairies waved these wonderful wands and
clothed them in beautiful little green dresses. So exactly like the leaves in colour
that the greedy birds could not spy them easily.
They SUN-RAYSED the tiny green balls day after day, till they gradually
plumper and softer and more juicy, and when the long summer davs came
hosts ot Sun-Fairies worked harder than ever to transform the hard, sour balls into
the sweetest clusters that ever made the mouths of boys and girls water on hot days.
\\ hen they ripened the balls, they often coloured them also, with brown or blue
or purple, trom their colour boxes.
As soon as the flesh softened and sweetened, the Sun-Fairies saw crowds of
boys and girls, as well as men and women, gathering the clusters from old
Mother \ me and carrying them off to others who worked on a perfectly spotless
dipping and drying green, where more Sun-Fairies danced about making every-
thing bright. s

The Mission of the Sunland Fairies.
? Have you children heard about the Man in the Sun and his fairies that help
him distribute the Sun-Rays which he manufactures up in Sunland??
?We know about the Man in the Moon,? I hear you say. ? But we never
dreamt there was a Alan in the Sun.? Indeed there is; and a kind, hard-working
old chap he is.
In the winter the fairies have lots of time for play, for there is practically no
work to do. The fact is after the summer rush there are only a few Sun-Rays left;
just enough to light up this old world. ?
All the winter, Father Sun shuts himself up and manufactures Sun-Ray Pow-
der. What the recipe is, no one knows, for no one has seen him make it.
When the winter draws to a close the fairies get to work. The Sun-Ray broom
has to be quite ready when Father Sun appears with his huge box of powder. The
Sun-Ray machine has to be thoroughly dusted, the flooring removed under the
funnel of the machine, and a fine grating put down.
Father Sun drops in some powder and turns the handle. Oh, the dazzling cas-
cade of the Sun-Rays, glittering and sparkling as they race to the grating, each
anxious to slip through to see the world.
Father Sun is always keen to help any Australian industry. At present he is
very much interested in the A.D.F.A. Fruit in Australia. He thinks fairies, and
even you, earth-children should have an object in life, so he has given the Currants,
Sultanas and Lexias, belonging to these growers, into the care of his fairies.
I expect you wonder what they do. Well, I will tell you. They each have a
gossamer bag, and a little net. \V hen extra bright Ravs come dancing along, they
endeavour to catch them in their net before they reach the grating; then ?pop?
they go into their bags. This goes on until their bags are full of the very choicest
Rays of the sunshine. I hen off they fly to Australia, and equally scatter their Golden
Rays on the Currants, Sultanas and Lexias.
To show how much the earth-people appreciate the fairies' work, thev have
chosen the name SUN-RAYSED for these fruits.
\ou can imagine the excitement in Sunland when they heard of this.
Father Sun beamed with pride, and as for the fairies they were wild with
joy, and hastily embroided SLN-RA\SED on their bags in sunbeam thread. They
vowed they will chase the harder than ever, and will not mind how manv
trips they make.
They say, ? The more Sun-Rays we take down the better the fruit will be; and
no one will ever dream of buying Currants, Sultanas, or Lexias which do not bear
OUR brand?SUN-RAYSED.?

Ruth and the ?SUN-RAYSED? Fairies.
One hot afternoon, two children sat under the trees overlooking a vineyard.
o -
? I wish the grapes were ripe,? said Peter. ?What makes them ripe, I wonder??
? Fairy magic,? said Ruth, ? have some of these SUN-RAYSED Sultanas,
they used to be grapes, so mummy says.?
Peter had some. ? Now, aren't they lovely?? asked Ruth.
? Not bad,? he said; ? but what makes them goldy if they used to be grapes??
? Fairy magic, again/' said his sister. Peter laughed.
? Only girls and babies believe in fairies,? he said.
? Mummy does, I know. She often reads me fairy stories,? said Ruth.
? When I?m big, I?ll read real stories about Nelson and Jellicoe and ships?
not girls' stuff about fairies and magic, and all that,? said Peter.
The weather had made him cross as well as hot you see. He walked off to-
wards the house.
Ruth climbed into mummy?s hammock with the SUN-RAYSED Sultanas for
company. She ate one.
? Fancy not believing in fairies,? she said to herself. She took another. ? I
wish I could see them working here in our vineyard,? she thought. It certainly was
comfy there in the cushions. She took one more SUN-RAYSED from the box and
ate it.
? Ruth!? called a tiny musical voice. There stood a beautiful fairy with a glit-
tering crown on her golden hair and a wand in her hand. ?I am the SUN-
RAYSED fairies, Ruth,? she said. ? Your wish is coming true.?
She touched Ruth?s eyes with her fairy wand, saying as she did so, ? You must
keep very, very still, Ruth.?
\\ herever she looked, Ruth saw ladders of fine gold reaching up to the sun.
Every ladder was crowded with gleaming fairies carrying baskets of something
bright. Down they came, and poured their golden loads on to the vines?then up,
up, up, to fill their baskets again and yet again.
Such a happy, laughing crowd of busy workers. One named ? Twinkle Toes ?
tumbled and upset her basket. ? There goes my Sun-Rays,? she said. ? I?ll just have'
to get extra next time,? and back she went for more.
Ruth watched till the ladders began to slope lower and lower towards the west.
The fairies were all going up now.
? Come along, ? Twinkle Toes.? We are taking the ladders up,? they called.
Plenty of I ime, laughed ? Twinkle Toes but soon the very last ladder was
disappearing.




'
.


How she ran and ran. ? She will never catch it,? thought Ruth. But she did.
Ruth was so excited that she clapped her hands, there she was, back in the ham-
mock again.
She ran to the house. ? Oh, mummy,? she called, ?I?ve had the loveliest time.?
? You?ve slept quite a long time,? said mummy.
? If you want to see the fairies working magic in your own vineyard, just get
into the hammock, eat three SUN-RAYSED Sultanas, and wish, and wish, and
wish.? She explained. Mummy said she would try the next sleepy hot day.
? Only mind you eat three,? said Ruth. Peter said he would eat a whole box
full, and he did. So would every boy if their mothers and fathers would give them
the opportunity.

Mary and her little Lamb.
Of Mary and her little lamb.
We all have heard the story;
Of how it followed her to school,
And won an endless glory.
Most ev?eryone has wondered why
The lamb so loved dear Mary;
So now the secret I'll unfold,
As told me by a fairy.
Her mother used to make her cakes,
With Dried Fruits from Australia ?
(The SUX-RAYSED kind ?so plump
and rich,)
And never had a failure.
The SUX-RAYSED Lexia Cakes she
made
In many shapes and sizes :
And with her SUX-RAYSED Currant
Buns ?
At shows won all the prizes.
Her SUX-RAYSED ? Molly Sandwich "
was
The choicest dish of any;
Oh, Mary was a lucky girl ?
Of sweets to have so many.
So Mary had some every day,
To relish with her dinner;
And that is why she?s rosy-cheeked?
At ev'ry sport a winner;
E'er joyous?Mary off to school,
M ould toddle on so gaily ;
The lamb all gladness romping
round;
And thus the pair went daily.
As through the bush they sped along
Amid the ferns, so happy;
Kind Mary gave a SUX-RAYSED cake
To her wee snow-white ? chappie.?
And when at play time, Mary called,
Her tiny pet ?obeying?
Would hasten for another feast?
Then off they went a-playing.
What happiness the pair enjoyed
In those brief times together;
At hide-and-seek, through shady gums,
In ev'ry sort of weather.
And while from school they raced along
'Xeath wattle-gold a-gleaming,
A mother fond, for Mary's tea,
Had SUX-RAYSED scones a-steam
ing.
When Mary, hungry as can be.
Responds to tea-bell cheery ?
Bier thoughts are for her faithful mate
All tired out and weary.
So Mary, with her great big heart,
Asks mother's kind permission ;
And soon the lamb with SUN-
RAYSED Cakes,
Renews its one ambition.


And then there came one glorious
month,
Her little life to vary;
A month of wonderful surprise,
For happy little Mary.
At break of day, when rosy tints
Through eastern skies were peeping;
The waggon wide was harnessed up,
While most town folk were sleeping.
Of course the lamb?all cuddled up
At Alary?s feet ?was with her,
Its wond?ring eyes, in sweet content
A-roaming here and thither.
On, on they go, till vineyards vast
Gleam bright in each direction?
Wide emerald seas of shimmering
leaves,
To shield and give protection.
The journey ended, Alary gazed
On welcoming eyes in dozens;
And with the lamb, held pride of place,
?Alid aunts and little cousins.
The crowning joy of all then came
From buxom Aunty Polly;
M hen Alary learned the nectar of
? Good Fittle Normey " Lolly.
And then thro? long Sultana lanes,
Amazed and full of pleasure;
They?d watch the vintage yield anew,
Its splendid luscious treasure.
Soon, 'neath the rays of Southern Sun,
And watchful eyes of stackers,
The trays of bronzing SUN-RAYSED
Fruits,
Were ready for the packers.
Thus Alary?s daily knowledge grew,
In that fair clime so sunny;
Of how the SUN-DRIED Fruits were
raised,
And made as sweet as honey.
And so the happy days sped on,
Amid the scented flowers;
Dear mem?ries for the after years ?
Of childhood's golden hours.
Now that the secret has been told
There's no excuse for failure,
For Mary and her little lamb,
M ere credits to Australia.
The little maid, grew strong and big,
M ith sparkling eyes a-dancing;
In action?graceful as a fawn
On verdant green a-prancing
And everyone in Alary?s home,
Is always just as healthy;
For SUN-RAYSED Fruits are
Nature?s gifts?
In strength to make us wealthy.

The Sun Fairies and their Work.
The big Father Sun was speaking.
? Mv dears,? he said to his Sun-Ray children, ? you have been very busy down
on the earth. Will you tell me something of what you have been doing??
? Oh. yes, father, dear,? spoke up the eldest Sun-Ray, ? but I am afraid we
have been doing more play than work.
? How is that?? asked the Big Sun.
His little Sun-Ray said, ? Well, you see, father, we went down as you told us,
and straight to where the beautiful vines are growing. We meant to do, oh, so
much work, but I am sorry to say that we found so much delight in dancing in and
out between the leaves and bunches of fruit, and in playing hide-and-seek with each
other, that we quite forgot about working.?
? Ha, ha,? laughed big Father Sun, ? the very best thing, my children, the
very best thing. Now, off you go to your hide-and-seek.?
So, away went the little SUN-RAYS, down, down, to their happy playground,
and again they danced in and out, often resting for a moment on the beautiful
clusters of fruit. Now, hiding behind a big juicy grape, now peeping out at a little
sister Sun-Rav; and so they spent their happy day until big Father Sun beckoned to
his children that they must come home to bed.
Many' such days passed, but one morning big father called his children and
said:
? My little ones, you must put on your little fairy dresses, for you are not
going to the earth as Sun-Rays to-day, but as invisible fairies. I want you to see
how happy you have made the little children.'
? We?? cried all the Sun-Rays together. ? How have we made children happy??
? Well, you shall see,? said Big Father, ? and you are going to travel to-day on
the backs of my trained dragon flies.
So, presently, away went the little ones, clinging tightly to their swift steeds, and
laughing together, though very softly, for no one must hear them. Down, down,
they came till they spied a smiling little boy entering a shop.
The dragon flies followed the little fellow, and the fairies watched eagerly.
He went to the counter, and said, ? Please, grocerman, my mother wants a
packet of SUN-RAYSED Currants.?
? Yes, my little man.? replied the grocer, ? do you like them??
? Like them? My ? and little Freddie opened his eyes and mouth very big
and very round. ?I do so! Say, grocerman, why are they so nice??
Why, because the Sun Fairies dance on them all the summer, that s why. But
why do you like them??

von ever tasted."
The little fairies hugged each other with delight. ?We didn't know/' they
whispered, ? that we were making nice Currants for little boys, did we?"
And big Father Sun laughed when they told him. ? You thought you were only
playing, my dears, but it was play and work in one, and filled these SUN-
RAYSED Fruits with the Concentrated Sun Light," which makes every child
simply clamour for more and more of them.

The Sun Fairies.
Have you heard the story of the Sun Fairies? There were three, Gold Ray,
Red Ray, and White Ray. They were Cheer-up Fairies, who wished to make every-
one happy.
They were born in the Cave of Light, right in the great warm heart of the Sun
?ninety million miles from the earth.
The first day they peeped out they saw the earth, for. being fairies, they could
see a long, long way. It was Gold Ray who first saw all the poor children who lived
in the big cities.
She felt very sorry for the poor children. So, for a long time, she wondered
and wondered what she could do to make them happy.
At last she turned to Red Ray and White Ray with a smile that was like'a
tiny burst of sunshine. ? I know what we can do,? said she.
? Oh, tell us quick,? exclaimed Red Ray and White Ray, in one voice.
? Listen, and I shall explain my plan,? replied Gold Ray. ? Each of us shall
gather an army of Fairy Rays together, and then we will set out for a visit to the
earth. White Ray shall take her army of Sun Fairies and keep the days fine and
bright for the poor children until the great day of the Christmas Feast of the fairies.
Then Gold Ray turned to Red Ray with a smile, and said, ? Dear Red Ray, you
will take your army of Sun Fairies and work among the tender plants of Fruit
Land, in Australia. Each day you will bid your army of fairies kiss the tender
leaves and vines until the ripe fruit comes. After the fruit is laid out to dry,
you must dance the dance of the Sun Fairies and shower the smiles of your army
upon them, until you are sure they are the best SL?N-RAYSED Fruits in the
world.?
? But what are you to do?? asked Red Ray to Gold Ray.
" Oh, answered Gold Ray, ? I shall take my army and warm the hearts of the
rich folk. After many days, I shall tell them of the poor children who have so little
money.?
? But when shall we three meet again ?? asked Red Ray in a sad voice.
?A\ e shall meet,? answered Gold Ray, ? just when all the rich folk are asking
me what they can do to help the poor children. Then the red and white and gold
armies of the Sun-Ray Fairies will stand at the salute like an army of Anzacs.?
? But what shall we answer the rich folk?? came the next question from White
Ray.
??We shall tell them of our work in the world, and each Sun Fairv will have
the name of a shop where SL N-RAT SED Fruits are sold. One by one we shall
whisper how happy the poor children would be if thev could get some of the won-
derful SUN-RAYSED Fruit.?
And so it came to pass just as Gold Ray had planned. The rich folk bought
enough SUN-RAT SED Fruit for all the poor children of the big cities. The red,


white and gold armies of the Sun Ray Fairies held a great Christmas feast, and
invited all the poor children. Together they danced for joy, for all were very
happy.
This is the end of the story of the Sun Ray Fairies who were born in the Cave
of Light in the great warm heart of the southern sun. They came ninety million
miles to earth to cheer up everyone and wrapped their golden smiles around SUN-
RAYSED Fruits.

DICKY WAS A DIGGER.
Dicky was a digger, a hero from the.
war.
Freddy was a slacker, the sort we've no
use for.
Mother made a pudding, as only
mothers can,
With many SUN-RAYSED dried
fruits ?a treat for any man.
Sultanas, Currants, Lexias, and plenty
of them, too,
No hiding from each other, the way
some raisins do.
Freddy lounging round the doorway,
thinking of himself,
Chanced to see in open window, pudding
on the shelf.
Reached and quickly took it, chuckling
as he stood,
Dreaming how he'd eat it all, as only
slackers would.
Digger Dicky, watching grimly, spoilt
that slacker's lunch.
Punched him here, there, everywhere,
as only diggers punch.
Our Christmas camp it rang with
cheers, at Freddy?s awful plight,
For him no SUN-RAYSED pudding,
as he wouldn?t go to fight.

The Sun?s Gift.
Little Lucy turned restlessly in bed and looked out of the open window.
From the street below came the sound of merry children at play, and the little
invalid longed to be out playing, too. Just then the door opened, and a gentle voice
said, ? Lucy, Auntie has sent you a little gift.? The mother placed a small parcel on
the table and went out softly.
Lucy undid the wrappings listlessly, and looked at the box beneath
It was a packet of dried fruit.
The child took a sultana and began to eat it slowly. It was certainly very nice,
so the little girl ate another.
Perhaps it was the pure, sweet flavour of the fruit, or perhaps the thought of
her Aunt?s kindness that caused the child to turn her eyes to the little patch of
country beyond the house-tops. She looked longingly at the open fields where the
blue sky seemed to come down and meet the warm, green fields, with a happier look
on her face.
How long Lucy lay watching she could not tell, but quite gradually the sky
seemed to become a wide, blue sea, on which the light of the sun sparkled and
danced. Far away in the distance the child noticed an island, the outline of which
seemed strangely familiar.
Lucy felt that she was in a very high place ?far higher than the first story of
the house where she lived. Below her stretched the sea, which seemed to cover the
whole world.
Suddenly voices broke the stillness, and, looking round, Lucy beheld a strange
and wonderful company.
? I shall hide my beans in the shells of oysters living in the sea round the
island, so that the inhabitants will have jewels to deck themselves,? said a tall
woman clad in silver, with moonbeams clustering in her hair.
? Moon Goddess, I shall hang a sign in the sky which shall guide all people to
this island,? said the Queen of the Stars.
? The sign shall be a cross of stars, and the island will be called by mortals
Australia, Land of the Southern Cross."
? Because I love the island, and all the people who shall dwell there, I shall
bestow a more precious gift,? said the Sun God. ? The people of the island shall be
given the food of the gods.?
So saying, the Sun God plucked cuttings from vines which grew close by.


? Take these cuttings, little fairy messengers, and plant them in this Southern
Isle. Thou, O Rain God, must send thy messengers to water the land, so that soon
it will be abundantly covered with fruit. I shall shine each day upon the eai th so
that the fruit may ripen. This fruit shall be of greater value to men than
jewels or Heavenly stars. It will be health-giving. Then, so that people who cannot
taste the ripe fruit may receive the blessing, too, with my rays I shall dn the
grapes until they are filled with all the energy and purity of my light. From these
three cuttings, three different vines shall spring, the fruit of which, when dried, will
be named by mortals, Currants, Sultanas, and Lexias. This is my gift to the chil-
dren of men. and the Big Island of the South."
The scene became indistinct, and Lucy felt a soft hand on her forehead.
? Well, Childie, did you enjoy your fruit?" asked the mother.
? Why, mother, I feel that I have been eating sunshine." said Lucy, ? and if
I eat more l know I shall soon be quite well,"
The child looked at the box again when the mother had left the room. ?SF N-
RAYSED ? Dried Fruit was written in large letters. Lucy looked at the bright sun-
shine outside, and whispered softly, ? Dear Sun, what a good name people have
chosen for your gift to the Big Island of tlie South, and to all the children of Aus-
tralia.'?

Mary had a little lamb.
And nearly every day,
From early morn till late at night,
You'd find them both at play.
Mary's mother's SUN-RAT SED Fruits,
Disappeared too fast;
She set a trap each night for weeks,
And caught the thief at last.
Mary had throughout these weeks
Suspected brother Sam;
But when her father forced the door,
He found inside ?the lamb.
Mary now has got a doll ?
She wheels it in a pram.
For Sunday?s dinner they will have
A leg of Mary?s lamb.
