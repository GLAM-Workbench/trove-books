PREFACE.
My “ Notes on Western Australia, 1883,” are now out of print,
and in this second edition I have added and altered them so as to
bring them up to 31st December, 1884. They are intended to
supply, in a concise form, information often inquired for, respecting
the Colony as a field for immigration and investment, and are
purposely very short, in order that they may he read in a few
minutes. I can only hope that intending immigrants and others
may be able to derive from them some of the information they
require.
The short “ Introduction,” giving a record of the Discoverers
and Explorers of the Western Coast of Australia from the earliest
times, may be of interest to some.
JOHN FORREST.
Perth, W.A., April, 1885.

INTRODUCTION.
TTHE first discovery of the Western Coast of Australia of which we have
-L a fairly authentic account was made by Dirk Hartog in the ship
“ Endracht,” and Dirk Hartog’s Island, on the Western side of Sharks Bay,
was so named in consequence. A tin plate, having the following inscrip-
tion upon it, was left at the North end of the island, afterwards named Cape
Inscription:—
“SStli October, 1616.— Arrived here the ship “Endracht,” of Amsterdam. The first
merchant Gillis Miebais of Luik; Dirk Hartog, of Amsterdam, captain. Sailed for
Bantam 27th of same month.”
This plate was seen by Vlaming in 1G97, and by Baudin in 1803,
but had disappeared in 1838, when it was searched for by Sir George Grey.
In 1619 Van Edels visited the coast near what is now known as
Champion Bay, and gave his name to it.
In 1622 the South-west corner of Australia was discovered in the ship
“Leeuwin,” and the South-west Cape still bears the name of Cape
Leeuwin.
In 1627 the South coast from Cape Leeuwin eastward towards the
Great Australian Bight was discovered in the ship “ Guide Zeepart,” and
was named Nuyts Land. The magnificent flowering tree Nuytsia Jlori-
bunda, commonly called the “ Christmas or Cabbage tree,” was named by
Robert Brown, the great naturalist, in honor of Nuyts.
In 1628 the coast between Sharks Bay and Champion Bay was
discovered by De Witt, and was named “ De Witt’s Land.”
In 1629 Pelsart, in the ship “ Batavia,” was wrecked on Houtman’s
Abrolhos. The story of this shipwreck, and of the adventures of the immi-
grants, the mutiny, the supposed treasure, the marooning of two of the
mutineers on the mainland near Champion Bay in 1629, are well known to
all readers of early voyages. Captain Wickham, R.N., in 1839, found on an
island of the Abrolhos, named by him Pelsart Island, a part of the ship
“ Batavia,” with a coin dated 1620, besides several fi’agments of corroded
iron, &c.
In 1644 Tasman examined the North-western coast from the Gulf of
Carpentaria to De Witt’s land.
In 1688 Dampier visited the North-west coast near Roebuck and Beagle
Bays, and gave an interesting account of the aborigines, whom he describes
as the “ miserablest people in the world.”


On Christmas Day, 1690, Vlaming discovered Swan Eiver (so named
by him on account of black swans being first seen on it), and Rottnest
Island. He captured and took away with him several of the black
swans, and, proceeding northward, examined the coast as far as the
North-west Cape, passing Sharks Bay, where he recorded his visit on the
tin plate left by Dirk Hartog in 1616, near what is now called Cape
Inscription.
In 1699 Dampier again visited the Western coast, examined Sharks
Bay, so named by him, though it had formerly been named Dirk Hartog
Bay by Dirk Hartog, in 1616. He also discovered and mapped Dampier
Archipelago, and added largely to the knowledge of the habits and customs
of the aborigines and the natural history of the country.
In 1726 the ship “ Zeephyk ” was wrecked on Houtman’s Abrolhos, in
lat. 28° 53' S. near Gun Island (so named by Captain Wickham, E.N., in 1839,
as he found a gun upon it besides many relics of the wrecked ship). The
crew were able to build a boat from the fragments of the wreck, and
reached Batavia in safety. In 1882 I visited Gun Island and found a large
number of common clay pipes, a large quantity of broken bottles, wine
glasses, corroded iron, &c., as well as two coins bearing date 1720 and 1722.
In 1772 it is stated that Captain St. Alouarn anchored near Cape
Leeuwin, and no doubt St. Alouarn’s Island, near the Cape, is so named in
consequence.
In 1791 Vancouver discovered King George’s Sound and Oyster Harbor,
and a tablet near a well he dug has recently been erected recording his visit.
The following year D’Entrecasteaux, in search of Count La Perouse and
his officers and crew, who had not been heard of since 1788, examined the
South coast, naming Esperance Bay, the Recherche Archipelago, &c. The
celebrated botanist, Labillardiere, accompanied this expedition, and he has
left us an account of the voyage.
In 1802 Flinders, in the ship “ Investigator,” examined and carefully
mapped King George’s Sound, Princess Royal Harbor, and the whole of the
South coast. He was accompanied on this expedition by Robert Brown, the
great naturalist, and William Westall, the famous landscape painter.
In 1803 Baudin and Hamelin, in the French ships “ Geographe ” and
“ Naturaliste,” in search of Count La Perouse expedition, examined the
West coast from Cape Leveque to Cape Leeuwin, naming the Naturaliste
Channel and many other localities in Sharks Bay, Leschenault Inlet,
Geographe Bay, Cape Naturaliste, Cape Hamelin, and many other places,
the names of which are now familiar to all West Australians. Baudin was
accompanied on this expedition by the naturalist Leschenault.
In 1818 Captain Freycinet examined the Western coast and visited
Sharks Bay, and the naturalist Gaudichaud has left an account of this
voyage in his " Botanique Voyage an tour du Monde, par Freycinet.”


After this the next record is that of Captain (afterwards Admiral)
P. P. King, R.N., between the year 1818 and 1822, who carefully surveyed
the whole Western coast from King George’s Sound to Cambridge Gulf.
King’s charts and sailing directions, with additions by Wickham and
Stokes and others, are for the most part in use at the present time. In
these surveys he was assisted by Lieutenant (afterwards Commander)
Roe, R.N., the first Surveyor-General of this Colony, as well as by Allan
Cunningham the naturalist.
In 1826 the Government of New South Wales despatched a detach-
ment of the 39th Regiment, under Major Lockyer, to King George’s Sound
to form a settlement.
In 1828 Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, R.N., in H.M-.S.
“ Success,” surveyed the coast from King George’s Sound to Swan River,
and on the Ist of June, 1829, the Colony of Western Australia was founded
by Captain Stirling, who was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.
From 1829 to 1884 the Colony has steadily progressed, though some-
times at a slow rate. To those who would wish to trace its history through
these 55 years, the following notes will not be sufficient, their object being
merely to show its position at the present time. Its explorers have
traversed nearly the whole of its immense territory, and have proved that
the portion lying between the coast and the watershed of the rivers falling
into the sea is well suited for settlement. At the present time 150 millions
of acres are leased from the Crown, and the revenue derived from land is
nearly ,£lOO,OOO a year.
The policy of building Railways on what is termed the " Land Grant
System ” has recently been approved; and a contract has been entered into
for the construction of a line from Beverley to Albany (a distance of 220
miles) during the next seven years, in consideration of a land payment of
12,000 acres a mile and the introduction of a number of immigrants.
Other similar proposals are under consideration.
No payable gold field has yet been discovered in the Colony, but
recently most encouraging reports have been received as to the auriferous
character of a large area in the Kimberley District. The future prospects
of the Colony are good, and it can be confidently stated that it offers a fair
field for capital and enterprise.

WESTERN AUSTRALIA
On 31st December, 1884.
W MITE STERN AUSTRALIA is about one third of the
1/1/ Australian Continent, and comprises all that portion
r r lying to the Westward of the 129th Meridian of East
Longitude. Its area is about a million square miles, and is there-
fore about eight times the size of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, and as large as the combined areas of Spain,
France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Holland, Portugal,
Greece, and Belgium.
CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT.
The constitution is what is called “Representative.” The
Government is administered by a Governor appointed by the
Crown and assisted by an Executive Council, appointed also by
the Crown, consisting of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney
General, the Colonial Treasurer, the Commissioner of Crown Lands
and Surveyor General, and the Director of Public Whrks and
Commissioner of Railways; under the Royal Instructions, power
is given to the Governor also to appoint two unofficial members
to the Executive Council. There is a Legislative Council con-
sisting of the members of the Executive Council, with the exception
of the Colonial Treasurer, 4 nominees of the Governor, and Id
elected members. This Council is presided over by a Speaker.
The franchise for electors is idoo freehold, or householders
of =£lo annual value, or lessees of Crown Lands to the same amount
annual rent. The qualification for members is the possession of
=£looo freehold beyond encumbrances.
There aye 13 electoral Districts,—Perth, Fremantle, and the
North District return two members each, and the remaining Dis-
tricts one member each.
POPULATION.
Tlie population is only 32,958, and is generally scattered along
the whole seaboard and within 100 miles of it. In a few cases?
however, settlement extends nearly 300 miles inland.
PRODUCTS.
The principal products are wool, timber, lead, cojiper, pearls,
peail shells, wheat and other cereals, guano, sandalwobd, wine,

PASTORAL.
To the north of latitude 28° South, the country is used almost
exclusively for pasturage, and is eminently suited for horses, cattle,
and sheep. The largest squatting properties are now to be found
in the Northern districts of the Colony; and pastoral pursuits are
successfully followed there, by enterprising colonists. At the end'of
1884 there were 1,547,061 sheep in the Colony, and the estimated
value of the export of wool was £249,255, the average price being
Is. 2d. per pound.
The Southern portion of the Colony is suited not only for
pasturage but also for the growth of cereals, and most other extra-
tropical products.

TIMBER,
The Colony is celebrated for its timber and especially for the
Eucalyptus Marginata, locally called “ Jar rah.” This timber is
almost inexhaustible, and is celebrated for piles for jetties, wharfs,
and bridges, for buildings, railway sleepers, and all purposes


requiring durability and imperviousness to the white ant and the
teredo navalis. It is an easy wood to work and is in request for all
purposes of engineei'ing and building throughout Australia, New
Zealand, and in India.
The Karri, Eucalyptus diversicolor, abounds along the south
coast, west of Albany, and grows to a magnificent size. It is very
highly spoken of and obtains a place with the Jarrah in South
Australia and elsewhere for all engineering purposes.
During 1884 the export of timber was 17,234 loads, estimated
value being <£68,936, or an average of about £4 a load.
There are a great many other woods, Eucalypts, Banksias,
and Acacias, which are very valuable for certain purposes. A
description of these timbers is given in Baron von Mueller’s excellent
work on “ Forest Resources of Western Australia, 1879.”
MINERALS.
In the neighborhood of Northampton, and in other localities,
splendid lodes of lead and copper are found, and have been for
many years worked on a limited scale. During 1884, only 696
tons of lead ore valued at £7 a ton, and 118 tons of copper ore
valued at £l5 a ton, were exported. Owing to the depressed state
of the lead market, the industry is at present not in a flourishing
condition, but if the price improves, the supply seems almost in-
exhaustible. A railway connects Northampton with its seaport,
Geraldton, a distance of 34 miles.
PEARLS AND PEARL-SHELLS.
All along the north-western coast to the north of latitude 25°
South, the pearl oyster abounds, and pearls and pearl-shells are
obtained by native divers. The industry is a very remunerative
one, and the value of the export for 1884 was £25,312, viz.,
pearl-shells £15,312, the average price being about £125 a ton, and
pearls £lO,OOO, estimated value. The coast north of King Sound
has scarcely been as yet examined for this industry, but there is no
doubt that vast treasures of pearls and pearl shells exist between
there and our Eastern boundary. Single pearls have realised
nearly £l,OOO, in some instances.
There is an export duty of £4 a ton on pearl-shells, with the
exception of Sharks Bay and dead shells, upon which £1 per ton is
charged.

WHEAT AND CEREALS.
During the last few years the small population of the Colony
has had so many outlets for its energy, in the prosecution of the
timber industry, pastoral pursuits in the new districts to the North,
pearl fisheries, &c., that there have not been sufficient people left to
conduct the cultivation of the soil. As a consequence, cultivation
and farming employments, being the least tempting and requiring
the greatest amount of manual labor, have had the least attention.
With increase of population, liberal land laws, and improved
means of communication, there is a certainty that the cultivation of
the soil will proceed, and as there is abundance of land in the
Central Districts of the Colony suited for the growth of cereals,
there is no doubt but that the industry will be followed with
advantage, and that in the future a large peasant population will
be settled upon the land.
Nearly everything that is required by the working man can be
easily grown, and by perseverance and frugality he can be certain of
securing a good living for himself and his family.
There are at present 79,669 acres of land under culti-
vation, and the yield per acre for 1884 was, wheat 13 bushels,
barley 16 bushels, oats 18 bushels, maize 17 bushels, hay 1 ton,
potatoes 3 tons. Agriculture is confined entirely to the portion of
the Colony South of Latitude 28° S. The following is a comparison
of the produce of crops per acre between Western Australia and
the other Colonies of Australasia, 1883-4 : —*

GUANO.
Licenses to remove deposits of guano existing on any island
within the territory can be obtained from the Commissioner of
Crown Lands; the ordinary royalty is 13s. per ton on the registered

tonnage of the ship. A reward of 10 per cent, of the amount
actually received by the Government as royalty will be paid to
the discoverer of any new deposits, over 2,000 tons, during five
years after the discovery and report. No royalty is charged on
Guano intended for use in the Colony. During 1884, 1163 tons
were exported, valued at =£7,560.
SANDALWOOD.
The sandalwood tree, Santalum Cygnorum, has a wide range
throughout South-Western Australia. A large export has hitherto
gone on annually, that for 1884 being about 2,620 tons, estimated
value being =£20,960, or an average of about =£B a ton. It is by no
means an inexhaustible product, but the export will continue for
several years to come. There is a duty of ss. per ton on all sandal-
wood exported.
WINE.
The vine grows luxuriantly throughout the Southern portions
of the Colony, and it is merely a question of planting, to ensure an
abundant crop of grapes. Owing to the small population and the
numerous industries requiring attention, there are but few large
vineyards; but as population increases, there will no doubt be a
large export of wine, raisins, &c. At the end of 1884 there were
687 acres of vines in the Colony.
FRUITS.
Fruit trees are easily grown, and bear abundantly. The
following are among those most commonly seen:—Apples, pears,
apricots, nectarines, peaches, grapes, figs, plums, mulberries,
quinces, almonds, guavas, currants, English and Cape gooseberries,
oranges, lemons, citrons, bananas, strawberries, loquats, pome-
gi’anates, olives, melons, &c., &c.
HORSES AND CATTLE.
The number of horses exported during 1884 was 1048, and the
estimated value was =£13,100, or an average of =£l2 10s. each.
During the last 20 years, horse-breeding has been neglected, owing
to its not being considered remunerative, but recently more atten-
tion is being given to it, especially in the Northern portion of


the Colony, and it seems pretty certain that the Indian Market will
in the future look to North-Western Australia for its principal
supply. Horses and cattle thrive well everywhere throughout the
Colony.
LAND REGULATIONS.
The head of the department of lands is the Commissioner of
Ci’own Lands, who also is Surveyor General of the Colony. The
Land Revenue, from all sources, during 1884, amounted to =£90,471.
The Colony is divided into five land districts, viz., Central,
Central-Eastern, South-Eastern, North, and Kimberley ; the limits
of these districts are shown on the accompanying map.
In the Central or Home District, land is alienated to the first
applicant at 10s. an acre, in lots of any size not less than 40 acres,
except for garden purposes, when as little as 10 acres can be bought,
or on Special Occupation, with certain improvements, by annual
instalments for 10 years of Is. an acre. When the improvements,
which consist of fencing the whole and cropping one quarter, are
completed, and 10s. an acre is paid, a Crown Grant issues; but
until the improvements are completed the annual instalment of Is.
an acre must be continued even after the full 10s. has been paid.
The minimum size of blocks under Special Occupation is 100
acres; there is no maximum. Free selection before survey is per-
mitted. Crown Lands are leased for pasture in the Central District
in blocks of not less than 10,000 acres, to the first applicant, at
=£l per thousand acres, and on annual license for areas not less
than 1,000 acres, at the same rate. The termination of all leases in
this distinct takes place at end of 1887.
In the Central-Eastern, South-Eastern, and North District
land is sold in blocks of not less than 400 acres, at ss. an acre,
and is leased for pasture at ss. per thousand acres for fhe first
half, and 10s. per thousand acres for the second half of the
lease, in blocks of not less than 20,000 acres. All such leases
terminate at the end of 1893. A lessee may at any time during
the first seven years of his lease select from his run any land,
not less than 1,000 acres, which he desires to hold under an
unconditional preemptive right, at an annual rental of =£s per
thousand acres. All such unconditional pre-emptive rights may be
redeemed in fee on the following terras : —ln the Noi’thern District,
if within the first seven years of the lease, by payment of five


shillings; and during the remainder of the term of ton shillings for
each acre redeemed. In the Central-Eastern and South-Eastern
Districts, if within the first seven years of the lease, by payment of
two shillings and sixpence; and during the remainder of the term of
five shillings for each acre redeemed.
In the Kimberley District land is sold at 10s. an acre to the first
applicant, in blocks of not less than 200 acres, and leased for pasture
at 10s. per thousand acres, in blocks of not less than 50,000 acres
on frontages, and 20,000 acres where there is no frontage. Leases
in this district terminate also at the end of 1893. A Stocking
Clause provides that one head of large stock or ten head of sheep
for every one thousand acres held by a Lessee shall be kept in the
distinct after the first four years of the lease, or double rent paid
until such time as the required number of stock are within the
district. In the event of the required number of stock not being
in the district at the end of 7 years, the lease will be forfeited.
Leases and licenses can be transferred with the approval of the
Commissioner of Crown Lands, and on payment of a fee of 10s.
New Regulations will be proclaimed before 1887 for the Central
District, and before 1893 for all other Districts.
Lessees are entitled to receive from the purchasers of laud
within their leases the actual value of any improvements they have
made on the land purchased.
Town Lands are sold by public auction, the upset price being
fixed by the Government.
Timber. —Licenses to cut timber arc issued at ss. a month for
each man employed. Special licenses, at <£2o per annum for each
640 acres, are also issued. To encourage timber companies on a
large scale, special concessions are given.
Minerals. —Leases for areas not less than 20 acres are
granted for 7 years, on certain conditions, at a rental of ss. an
acre, and the land can be purchased by. the lessee at <£3 an acre,
provided certain machinery has been erected, and that the mine has
been properly worked.
LAND TRANSFER ACT.
This Act, sometimes known as the “ Torrens Act,” has been
in force several years, and is of great importance as affording an


easy and cheap means of dealing with land. All Crown Grants are
issued under its provisions.
KIMBERLEY DISTRICT.
This new district comprises that portion of the Colony lying
to the North of 19° 30'' South Latitude. Its area is about 134,000
square miles, of which 62,084 square miles are leased from the
Crown, and the remainder (about 71,916 squai’e miles) is open to
selection, at 10s. a thousand acres per annum.
Free selection to purchase, subject to approval, is allowed, and
land in any quantity over 200 acres can be bought at 10s. per acre.
A townsite named “ Derby ” has been surveyed on the Eastern
shore of King Sound, and a Government station (with a Magistrate)
has been formed there. When the last returns were sent in, there
were 46,839 sheep, 960 cattle, and 287 horses on the Fitzroy and
Lennard Rivers near Derby, besides a large number of cattle on
the Upper Ord River that have been driven across from Queensland.
The country on the Ord River is now being surveyed and will no
doubt be .speedily settled, and Cambridge Gulf, the natural outlet
of this portion of the District, will probably become a place of some
importance. This magnificent harbor has recently been visited by
Staff-Commander Coghlan, R.N., and his interesting and valuable
report has been printed and can be obtained on application to the
Survey Office, Perth.
Running streams are numerous in the Northern portions of
this district, and splendid alluvial plains exist in the valleys of the
rivers, which it is hoped may be suitable for tropical culture.
A very great deal of attention has been drawn to it from the
Eastern Colonies, and extensive areas arc held on lease by outside
capitalists.
Horses, cattle, and sheep thrive well, and it is believed, by all
those best qualified to judge, that it will be a large wool-producing
country.
The Government have already expended <£lo,ooo in surveying
the district and examining its geology, and there appears to be a
good prospect of a payable gold field being discovered. In his
report on the geology of the district, Mr. Hardman, the Govern-
ment geologist, states : —“ lam glad to be able to report that I have
“ discovered a large area of country which I believe will prove to be


“ auriferous to a payable degree. This country is traversed by the
« Margaret, Mary, Elvire, Panton, and Ord Rivers, and comprises
“an area of at least 2000 square miles so far as observed, but it
“ doubtless continues over a much greater extent of country. The
“ formation is principally Lower Silurian slate and schist of various
“ kinds traversed by an enormous number of quartz reefs. In
“ some localities many of these occur in the space of a few hundred
“ yards, and it was quite usual to notice 25 or 30 large reefs while
“ riding over a mile of ground, without taking into account the
“ smaller reefs or veins. The quartz constituting these reefs is
“of a very promising character. It is a dull yellowish and grey
“quartz, very cellular and vuggy, containing quantities of black
“ and other oxides of iron, together with casts of, and often crystals
“of iron pyrites. From most of the surface quartz the enclosed
“ minerals have been washed away however, although their traces
“ are still apparent. Minute specks of gold have been noticed in a
“ few cases, and I have very little doubt that many of these reefs,
“ when properly examined and tested, will prove to be auriferous.
“These quartz reefs have a general bearing of N. 10 E. to N.E.
“ Many run due IST. &S. Some of them can be traced for several
“ miles. It is most probable that these quartziferous rocks are a
“ spur or continuation of the gold-bearing Metamorphic rocks of the
«Northern Territory of South Australia, now being worked with
“ some success. The river valleys and flats are in many places covered
“ with deposits, sometimes very extensive, of quartz-gravel, and drift;
“ the quartz being derived from denudation of the reefs referred to
“above. I have prospected these gravels over many miles of
“ country, and I have rarely failed to obtain good colors of gold;
“in many localities of a very encouraging character. Very often
“ good colors were obtained in every pan washed, in different trials
“in the same locality. I have thus found gold to be distributed
“ over about 140 miles along the Elvire, Panton, and Ord Rivers,
“ &c.; as well as on the Mary and Margaret Rivers, where the
“indications were very good, and the appearance of the country
“most favorable. In several instances I obtained good colors of
“gold at considerable distances from the quartz-bearing rocks
“ from which the gold could only have been derived. This to my
“ mind seems to indicate that there must be large quantities of gold
“in the quartz-bearing rocks, and in the drifts immediately over-
“ lying them. The gold yielding country is well watered by numer-


“ ous rivers, creeks, and gullies, which even in the driest part of
“ the year are never wholly without water. And although during
“ the dry season water is scarce, there would he no difficulty in
“ conserving water anywhere in sufficient quantity for all mining
“ purposes.
“On the whole, the indications I have met with point, as I
“ believe, to the great probability of payable gold being obtained in
“ this part of Kimberley, and are I consider sufficient to justify
“ the expenditure, either by the Government or private individuals,
“ of a reasonable sum of money in fitting out a party to thoroughly
“ test the country, and I should strongly recommend such an
“undertaking. I would also suggest the advisability of parties
“ going up for this purpose providing themselves with some simple
“apparatus for crushing and washing some of the reef quartz, as in
“ one very rudely conducted experiment of this kind I obtained a
“ small quantity of gold.”
RAILWAYS.
The gauge of Railways in Western Australia is 3 feet 6 inches.
There are 75 miles of Government Railway at present working, viz.,
from Fremantle to Chidlow’s Well, 41 miles, and from Geraldton to
Northampton, 34 miles—there are, however, 49 miles in course of
construction, viz., between Chidlow’s Well and York.
The Timber Companies have more than 60 miles of railways
and tramways for bringing timber from the ranges to the sea.
The revenue received for 1884, from 75 miles of Government
Railways then working, was ,£19,543.
POSTAL.
Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion
of the Colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast.
There were at the end of 1884 sixty post offices in the Colony; over
a million of letters and a million of newspapers were forwarded or
received. The postage within the Colony is one uniform rate
of 2d. for the half-ounce (letters posted in towns for delivery therein,
Id.), and newspapers are free within a week of the issue, after
which Id. is charged. The postage to the Eastern Colonies is 2d,
per | ounce and |d. for newspapers, and to the United Kingdom
6d. per ~ ounce and Id. for newspapers. The revenue from the
Post and Telegraph Office for 1884 was: Postages £8,752, Telegraph


Messages =£3,763, Fares by Mail Coach <£2,515, or a total of
£15,030; and the expenditure £26,180.
TELEGRAPHS,
Electric Telegraphs are erected throughout the settled portions
of the Colony. At the end of 1884 there were 1885 miles of wire,
and 450 more miles are now being erected between the Gascoyne
and Roebourne; the cost of sending ten words between any two
places within the Colony (excepting Perth and Fremantle, which is
6d.) is Is. The number of telegrams forwarded during 1884 was
96,184, and the revenue received £3,763. There is telegraph com-
munication with South Australia and the world.
TARIFF AND STAMP ACT.
The revenue derived from Customs during 1884 was £118,443.
The duties levied under the Act 46 Vic., No. 5, are either specific
or ad valorem of from sto 12| per cent. The Stamp Act, 46 Yic.,
No. 6, produced during 1884 the sum of £4,969. There is a duty
of 2 per cent, on bank notes.
IMMIGRATION.
A sum of £20,000 has been voted by the Legislature to en-
courage immigration. Free passages are provided from London to
the Colony by the Crown Agents to nominated persons, provided
certain formalities are complied with. There is a Board of Im-
migration appointed for the purpose of carrying out the wishes of
the Legislature, to which all communications should be addressed.
The Office of the Board is in St. George’s Terrace, Perth.
351 immigrants were introduced by the Board during 1884,
and the expenditure was £4,860.
EDUCATION.
Government Schools exist all over the Colony and are
governed by District Boards working under a Central Board.
Compulsory clauses exist in the Act and are enforced.
Assisted Schools by different denominations are also subsidised
by the State. The amount expended on Education for 1884 was
£10,096. A High School is also subsidised by the State. There is
a High School for Girls under the direction of the Anglican Bishop,
and another conducted by the Sisters of Mercy.

SHIPPING.
During 1884, the number of ships outwards and inwards
together numbered 442, and carried a tonnage of 442,886 tons. Of
this number 231 were steam vessels.
Steamers run monthly from Melbourne via Adelaide, Albany,
and the out-ports to Fremantle. P. &O, Steamers arrive at Albany
fortnightly from England via Colombo and from Sydney via Mel-
bourne and Adelaide, making almost a weekly mail service from
the Eastern Colonies.
There is a fortnightly steam service between Albany and
Champion Bay (Geraldton), touching at Busselton (the Yasse),
Bunbury, and Fremantle; also a monthly steam service between
Fremantle and Cossack, and one every two months between
Fremantle and Derby (King Sound) ; both these services touch at
Geraldton, Sharks Bay, Gascoyne (Carnarvon), and Ashburton.
In addition to these, there is a steam service every two months
from Fremantle to Singapore via Geraldton, Sharks Bay, Carnar-
von, Ashburton, Cossack, and Derby; and a direct steam service
every three months from London to Fremantle.
BANKS.
There are four banking institutions, viz., the Western Austra-
lian Bank, the National Bank of Australasia, the Union Bank of


Australia, and the Bank of New South Wales. Branches or
Agencies of these banks are established in several of the country
towns.
VOLUNTEERS.
In most of the principal towns Volunteer Companies are found,
and the total number of officers and men in the Colony is 547; the
total expenditure, during 1884, on account of the force, was =£2,657.
TOWNS.
The principal towns in the Colony, and the number of their
inhabitants are —Perth, about 6000; Fremantle, about 4500;
Albany, about 1000; Geraldton, about 1000; York, about 800;
Bunbury, about 600; Guildford, about 600. About one-third of
the entire population of the Colony is therefore located in Perth
and Fremantle. There are smaller townships scattered through-
out the Colony, viz,, Northampton, Busselton, Bridgetown, Pin-
jarra, Beverley, Northam, Newcastle, Gingin, Chidlow’s Well,
Carnarvon, Cossack, Roebourne, Derby, Kojonup, Moorumbine,
Rockingham, &c., &c., at all of which small centres of population
exist.
Perth, the capital of the Colony, is beautifully situated on the
right bank of the Swan River estuary, 12 miles from Fremantle,
where the river debouches into the sea. A railway connects Perth
with Fremantle.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
The Supreme Court is presided over by the Chief Justice and
one Puisne Judge. In the country districts there are Quarter
Sessions, presided over by a Magistrate; and, when occasion re-
quires, the Judges go on circuit. There are also Local Courts of
civil jurisdiction in most of the districts monthly, and Police
Magistrate’s courts daily. Justices of the Peace have jurisdiction
over the whole Colony, and not for particular districts.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.
The city of Perth and the town of Fremantle have corpor-
ations, presided over by a mayor ; and in most of the towns there
is a municipal council, presided over by a chairman. The manage-


ment of the areas within their jurisdiction is entirely entrusted to
these bodies, who are elected by the ratepayers. The roads of the
Colony are likewise managed by roads boards, elected by the
people; and the votes of the Legislature for roads and bridges
are entrusted to them.
PUBLIC DEBT.
Western Australia has only just begun to borrow money for
the construction of Public Works'. Up to the end of 1883, the
public debt amounted to =£611,000, or an indebtedness per head of
the population of £l9 ss. 6d. During 1884, £154,000 was added
to the debt, and therefore, on 31st December last, the amount was
£765,000, or an indebtedness of £23 4s. 3d. per head.
A further loan of £525,000 has been sanctioned for the con-
struction of harbor works, railways, jetties, and other works of
urgent necessity, and the expenditure of this money will no doubt
not only be the means of advancing the Colony by the increased
facilities for trade, but will also prove attractive to intending
immigrants. So that before the amount is expended it is to be
expected that the circumstances of the Colony will have greatly
improved.
The following table shows the indebtedness of Western
Australia as compared with the other colonies of Australasia on the
31st December, 1883, and since that time some of the colonies have
increased their indebtedness* :

hands, and settlement is very much assisted by their aid. In the
Northern Districts they are largely utilised as pearl-shell divers.
As a general rule they are not hostile, though very trouble-
some when they take to sheep-stealing.
Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not
been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them
to be useful. Attempts to make them lead civilised lives have
not been attended with much .success. They are splendid bush-
men, trackers, &c., and are excellent companions for a journey
through their country.
CLIMATE.
The climate of the South-Western portion is said to be one of
the finest in the world, and, throughout, the Colony is exceptionally
healthy. In a country extending from 13° to 35° of south latitude,
there is a great range of climate, but even in the farthest North,
there is an absence of the malarial fevers common to the tropics;
the heat is dry, though very oppressive in the Kimberley District,
but the nights are tolerably cool; and as far as the present experi-
ence extends there is no portion of the Colony that is considered
unhealthy. The South-Western corner is, however, the most salu-
brious, being seldom too hot or too cold, and having regular and
temperate seasons. Throughout Western Australia, the traveller
camps out at night, generally without any covering but a rug, and
never seems to receive any injurious effects. The following is the
mean annual death rate of Western Australia from 1865 to 1882,
compared with the other colonies of Australasia and some of the
countries of Europe—for every 1000 of the population*

CONCLUSION.
Western Australia offers special advantages to men with small
as well as to those with large capital, and taking into consideration
the varied industries in which capital can be remuneratively em-
ployed, it is very probable that, as the opportunities for investing
in station properties, in freehold and leasehold land from the
Crown or from private individuals, becomes less easy in the more
crowded Eastern colonies, more attention will be paid to the vast
Western colony, containing a million square miles and peopled by
only 32,958 persons.
