THE BUREAU OF INDUSTRY.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT.


At a meeting of the Bureau of Industry on
4th August, 1944, a Committee was appointed to
prepare recommendations on Regional Development
in Queensland. The membership of the Committee
was:
COLIN CLARK
Chairman,
Director, Bureau of Industry.
J. R. KEMP
Co-ordinator-General of Public Works.
C. E. CHUTER
Director of Local Government.
R. H. ROBINSON.
Under Secretary,
Department of Health and Home Affairs.
The report of this Committee, which is now
being considered by the Queensland Government,
is published herewith by the direction of the
Honourable the Treasurer.


REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
The Committee set up by the full Bureau has now considered the
desirability of some regional subdivision of the State, the main
purpose of which, it is suggested, would be to strengthen and increase
the efficiency of local government by amalgamation of existing local
authorities, to provide regional centres for purposes of State adminis-
tration which will be readily accessible to the population of each region,
and to bring representatives of State and local administrations as far
as possible into common centres. As these purposes are realised, the
allocation of additional functions to the strengthened local governing
bodies could then be considered.
It is hoped that the Government, after considering this report
and alternative proposals, will make a declaration of policy which will
serve as a guide to the Director of Local Government, and to the
various State Departments, including the Co-ordinator-General of
Public Works, in developing administration on the above lines.
In the selection of regional boundaries and centres it is quite
clear that the necessary elasticity should be preserved to ensure that
development is not impeded by some arbitrary demarcation of regional
boundaries, or the artificial encouragement of one administrative and
commercial centre at the expense of other well-developed centres in
the same region.
'Area, and present and future population, as well as the character
of soils and products, must be considered, together with State
departmental requirements, and the proposals for boundary limitations


suggested below must be taken as purely provisional at this stage and
subject to exhaustive examination by all interested departments, which,
should follow the Government's decision on the general principles
involved.
The following recommendations are now submitted for the
consideration of the Honourable the Treasurer and the full Bureau;—
Recommendation I:
It is recommended that a regional subdivision of the State
should be made for the purpose of further devolution of State
administration, and strengthening of local administration by
the progressive reorganisation of elected local governments on
a regional basis.
This is intended to meet the general objectives already outlined.
State Departments, if possible, should use these regions as their
administrative divisions. Where this is not possible, they may group
(if the regions are found to be too small for their purposes) or
subdivide (if too large), but they should avoid overlapping the regional
boundaries which are finally selected.
Recommendation 2:
It is recommended that consideration be given to regional
divisions, and towns to serve as the administrative centre of
the regions, as set out below, but that, before final decision, the
views of all interested Government Departments, and of all
other interested parties, be obtained.
Meanwhile, it is intended that the boundaries set out below should
he regarded only as provisional.
In the choice of centres and regional boundaries account has been
taken of—
(a) Area and present population.
(b) Existing commercial centres.
(c) Present economic and social requirements of the
neighbourhood.
(d) Possible future economic and social expansion.
(c) Communication facilities.

(</) An alternative opinion is that these two districts (12 and 13) separately are not
likely to show sufficient economic development to form two regions, ami that they should
form one region, on the understanding that there will he good road communications in
future between Gladstone and the Dawson Valley.
O) An alternative view is that the prospects for economic development in Wide Hay
are such that properly it should only constitute one region, with Maryborough as its capital,
and that to divide it into two or three regions would mean that none of the cities would he
able to grow to optimum size. Region 14 undoubtedly has a stronger claim to he
independently constituted than region 16. Parts of the latter have closer relations with
Maryborough than with Gympic. If such a region is to he constituted, Kingaroy might
prove to he the best centre.
if) An alternative proposal is that region 19 should not be separately created, ami
that these Shires and Goondiwindi Town should be joined with Warwick City, Rosenthal.
Glengallan, Allora and Stanthorpe Shires to make a region with Warwick as capital. If.
however, region 19 is created with Goondiwindi as centre, Warwick and the surrounding
Shires do not then justify the creation of a separate region and should he incorporated in
the Toowoomba region,

In such large areas as the Charters Towers, Cloncnrry, Long-reach,
and Charleville regions, the Committee considers that the provision
of one or more administrative snhcent.res would he essential.
Recommendation 3:
It is recommended that the Public Service Commissioner
investigate the possibilities of further devolution of State
administration into regions, as recommended above, or as later
may be amended.
Recommendation 4:
It is recommended that, for the Peninsula and Gulf regions,
resident State Administrators should be appointed and provided
with funds to carry out, subject to Cabinet's consent, any kind
of developmental work which appears necessary to supplement
the work of the local authorities in these regions.
The Peninsula and Gulf regions are very sparsely populated and
will not he able to provide out of their own resources, for many years
to come, the expenditure necessary for satisfactory development. The
provision of resident State Administrators appears to be the only
satisfactory solution to the problem. Their duty, of course, would
(//) An alternative proposal is that regions 23, 24, and 25 should be administered ns a
single region.
(h) If a separate region centred on (lympie he not constituted, Gynipie City and
Xoosa Shire might be transferred to this region. Xambour would then become its natural
ceptre.


lie to supplement rather than to oppose such work as the local
authorities could undertake, and the clear intention of the Government
would be that an autonomous and self-supporting government, similar
to that of the other regions, should displace the appointed
Administrators at the earliest possible date.
This proposal is subject to any Commonwealth policy which may be
developed on strategic grounds for the Torres Strait area, including
Thursday Island.
Recommendation 5:
The complete amalgamation of all local authorities within
each region should be declared as the ultimate objective.
Following the adoption of regional centres, as necessary State
administrative procedures are readjusted, and as other factors
permit, adjustments of Local Authority boundaries should be
effected by legislation.
A regional council, when formed, would exercise full and
unfettered local governing authority throughout its area. It might,
if it wished, exercise these powers as a single council. Alternative!)',
if it considered that distance or other circumstances warranted, it might
form district councils within its own area, lint these district councils
would be strictly subordinate to the regional council. Their powers
would be created, and could be removed, by the regional council.
Recommendation 6:
It is recommended that, as soon as administrative centres
are finally approved, steps be taken by the existing local
governing authority in each case for the preparation of compre-
hensive town and country plans for each of the centres selected,
the plans to be so based that they will not conflict with the
objective of the town’s population ultimately rising to a very
considerable degree.
Under the Local Government Act each Municipality is responsible
for the preparation of the town plan, and it is proposed that this
responsibility should remain,


With this arrangement, responsibility on behalf of the State for
the oversight of town planning, including advice on the development
of plans, and the approval of schemes, rests with the Department of
Local Government, subject, of course, to the Governor in Council.
It is considered that this is sound practice and should not be
varied, but it is a matter of great importance that the Department of
Local Government secure the services of town-planning experts at
the very earliest dale to supervise this section of its activities, following
which encouragement should be given to all municipal authorities to
develop their plans for consideration.
Consultation with the Department of Health and Home A flail's
on public health measures, the Co-ordinator-General of Public Works,
the State Transport Commission on transport, the Bureau of Industry
for statisticial information and economic advice, and the Common-
wealth Works and Services Department on Commonwealth public
building proposals, will ensure that all aspects are considered and
the possibility of common municipal. State and Commonwealth
administrative centres taken into account.
Recommendation 7:
It is recommended, as an essential preliminary to the
development of regional governments, that consideration should
be given immediately to ways and means whereby the financial
position of existing local authorities throughout the Slate may
be improved.
It is important that an elected authority should not administer
any function or service unless a substantial part of the cost of that
function is met by taxation which the elected council has to impose
upon its own electors. Only in this manner is a full sense of responsi-
bility in expenditure engendered. An elected council which does not
have the unpleasant task of raising the necessary funds through
taxation becomes a ceaseless claimant for greater expenditure.*
* “ Money collected by one government and then handed down to another does not get
treated with the same care as the recipient exercises in spending money raised by its own
taxes collected from its own people.’’ From the proceedings of the 1933 Convention of the
National Tax Association of America.


The recently announced subsidy scheme is based on this principle,
ami will assist local authorities in further development of their areas.
The process of amalgamation should further serve to reduce the
costs of local administration and relieve the budgetary position in
various directions. But it is also considered desirable that an examina-
tion should be made of possible steps to increase the revenues of local
authorities until they arc more commensurate with the services they
arc required to perform. As State revenues are at present only
sufficient to meet administrative and service costs and certain works
costs, it is certain that this will constitute a most difficult problem.
No recommendation is made at this stage as to functions, additional
to those at present devolving upon local authorities, which might become
the responsibility of the regional authorities when finally constituted.
Attention is called, however, to the need for local administration
of electricity, libraries, harbours, hospitals and other health functions,
and water conservation schemes.
