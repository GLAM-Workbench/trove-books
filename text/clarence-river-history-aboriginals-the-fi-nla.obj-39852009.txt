LIFE OF HENRY GILLETT
THRILLING EPISODES ON A
VOYAGE
EARLY SHIPBUILDING ON THE
CLARENCE.
• THE DAILY EXAMINER, WEDNESDAY. OCTOBER 3, 1934
Our Maclean correspondent writes: —
The articles that are appearing in the
“Daily Examiner”'from time to time
under the auspices of the Clarence River
Historical Society make very interesting
reading for the general public, particularly
for those born here, who are proud of this
great part of Australia where their fore-
fathers were amongst the early settlers.
Although the society is obtaining a
good deal of the history of this
river, particularly regarding those who
acquired the big holdings on the upper
reaches of the Clarence, it will be difficult
for them to obtain early information of
the nun and women who first came here
and selected smaller areas and those who
engaged in cedar-getting, shipbuilding
and other early ventures and industries,
more especially in the Middle and Lower
Clarence districts.
There are men aud women of advanced
years, the son 3 and daughters of these
pioneers, who have the information
handed down to them and in some cases
have records that would assist the His-
torical Society in compiling its valuable
historical data.
If these people gave such information
as they have to the Historical Society,
probably other records could be linked
with it, thus obtaining a fairly Compre-
hensive history of the early settlement of
this important part of the Commonwealth.
FIRST ON CLARENCE SOIL.
In the bridge issue, published by the
“Daily Examiner” was an article from
niv pen relating to the advent of the
Small family to the Clarence River in
the thirties and their subsequent settle-
ment.
Linked with the arrival of Thomas
Small and his family on the river in the
Susan .is that of Henry Gillett, who built
the Susan and arrived on the river in
1836, and who, it is claimed, was the first
man of that party to land on Clarence
River soil. Henry Gillett’s early life was
fraught with tragic happenings. He
pioneered shipbuilding on this river and
did much to rank him among the greatest
of our valiant band of pioneers.
hieni-y Gillett who was born in Cork,
Ireland, in 1801, was apprenticed to and
followed the calling of a ship’s carpenter,
lie married early In life and wits stil’
in the twenties decided to emigrate to
Australia, with his wife and young
children. He secured the position of
ship’s carpenter on the immigrant ship.
Hibernia, which was sailing for Australia
with over 500 immigrants aboard. With
his wife and two children, he left Eng
land in the Hibernia on a voyage that
was to prove so eventful and disastrous
that it shocked the whole world.
BOAT CATCHES FIRE.
Whin 60 days out from port, the
Hibernia caught fire in mid-ocean. All
attempts to subdue the fire proved ineffec-
tual'; with the result that orders were
given for the boats to be manned and a
timited number of the immigrants were
taken off. The panic-strick n condition
of the hundreds of men, women and
children on the decks of the vessel can be
realised when it was found that there
were but few boats and these were most
unseavvorthy, and inadequate to carry
away a tenth of the people on heard. By
the captain’s orders the different boats
were manned by officers and crews a id
each boat was speedily crowded to its
utmost capacity. Henry Gillett. being
the ship’s carpenter, was ordered aboard
ti;e captain’s boot and was compelled to
leave his wife and two children behind
The boats, for protection, were ordered
away from the vessel, which was now a
raging furnace, with people jumping
overboard from the bows, preferring death
from drowning rather than from the
fierce flames.
Soon ufter leaving the vessel the cap-
tain found that he had left behind import-
ant papers and called for volunteers to
go back to the vessel and recover them.
Gillett was the only one who responded,
and asked in return to be allowed to
bring liis wife and children back into the
boat with him, which the captain con
s' nted to do. After fighting against
the fierce flames and recovering the
papers, Gillett frantically searched for his
wife and children, but was too late to
rave them.
OVER 500 PERISH.
Over 500 souls perished in the raging
inferno and the small remnant, in leuking
and ill-found boats, drifted aimlessly
about the ocean for gome eight days,
Eventually an American ship was sighted
and hoved to, but a request for convey-
ance in his vessel was refused by the
captain, who urged them to make for the
South American toast, many miles away.
Despite the tears and entreaties of the
survivors, the, captain was adamant in his
refusal to take them aboard, notwithstand-
ing that the people were half dead with
hunger and exposure. After entreaties
from his own crew and after his own
carpenter had inspected the leaking boats,
which were found to be most nnseaworthy,
'lie holes anil cracks being stopped with
fat and other contrivances, tlie sur-
vivors were eventually taken aboard the
vessel and were landed at Rio lie Janeiro.
LANDS IN AUSTRALIA.
Soon afterwards, Gillett obtained pas-
sage on a ship sailing from Rio de
Janeiro to Tasmania. After a short
stay in Tasmania he embafked in a
vessel for Sydney, landing there in 1828.
He went to Kissing Point, 'Parramatta I
River, settling on the estate of the late
Thomas Small, where lie commenced ship-
building operations'. In the yards -P
Kissing Point, he built the cutters, Pris-
cilla and Aquila. He subsequently '*iflt
the schooner Susan, of 52 tons register,
which was called after one of Mr. Small’s
family. This small vessel was afterwards
to make history, being the first vessel to
enter the waters of the Clarence River.
The builder (Mr. Gillett) and Mr.
Thomas Small, were joint owners of the
Susan and thev decided to send her i.o
the Clarence River, or, as it was called
then, “The Big River,’’ to obtain a cargo
of cedar. Henry Thom was master of
the vessel and Bovle, well known as a
master of vessels that sn iseqwmiily traded
to oth"r ports, was mate. Twelve pairs
of sawyers accompanied the vessel, which
was to wait in the river until a cargo of
cedar was cut. Mr. Gillett was als.o on
the vessel. On reaching the entrance to
the river, they were unable to enws in
and were compelled to run to Moretofi
Ba.v to procure water. On their return
to the Clarence entrance they were again
unsuccessful in efforts to cross the bar and
eventually returned to Sydney for provi-
sions. Another attempt made afterwards
was successful.
FIR3T VESSEL IN CLARENCE RIVER.
After sounding the bar, the Susan
crossed into the river in 1836, being the
first vessel to enter it. Soon after its
arrival in the river, a boat put off from
the Susan and landed on the beach inside
the entrance. Among its occupants was
Mr. Gillett, who, being in the bow of the
boat, was the first man to jump ashore,
thus claiming to be the first white man
to land on the Clarence.
The first venture of the Susan’s joint
owners for cedar was not profitable and
Mr. Gillett decided to sell out his interest
in the vessel, and the undertaking they
were engaged in, to Mr. James Devlin, a
relative of Thomas Small. Subsequent
voyages of the Susan in its quest tor
cedar proved more successful, the round
trip being performed in 11 or 12 days.
The point at which the loading of cedar
took place on to the Susan in her voyages
to the river was at the island called then,
and now known as Helliman Island, op-
posite Woodford Island, which is at pre-
sent owned by Mr. Rupert Campbell, of
Grafton.
It is interesting to note that the first
trip of Ihe Susan to the river also con-
tained the first white woman to set foot
on the Clarence, namely Mrs. Bryan Neil.
Settlement now having taken place on
the Clarence, Mr. Gillett, who had married
again, decided to come to the Clarence and
follow his calling of shipbuilding. He
located himself at Woodford Island jn
the South Arm side, building his yard on
the foreshore of the estate where stood
the Small homestead, which is now owned
and occupied by Mr. John Hughes, of
Woodford Island. In this yard he built
the sailing vess is, Martha and Elizabeth,
as well as two other sailing vessels and
the sailing ship, Atalanta. A great deal
of the planking used in the construction
of these vessels was cut by Gillett’s own
hands, his method being to work on top
of the pit and weigh his saw with a heavy
piece of iron or timber.
After building these five vessels, he
moved to the Bellinger River and there
built the Martha Ann. Moving again,
he went to the Tweed River and put an-
other vessel on the stock, which he
launched and nam'd The Twins (com-
memorating the birth of twins by* his
wife, one being Mr. “Jack” gillett", who
is still living in South Grafton, and the
other Richard Gillett, who died lasi year).
While living on the Tweed River, Mr.
Gillett was unfortunate to lose his second
wife and shortly after her death he again
returned to the Clarence in 18,18. He
purchased an area of land near South
Grafton in the vicinity of the railway
where he lived several years and engaged
in farming.
THE OLD HOMESTEAD.
He then bought the cattle run, formerly
owned by the late James Sweeney on the
Coldstream, together with several farm-
ing properties. The run extended from
the co.usaeam to tne main river at
Clmarra. The homestead was on the hill
known as Gillett’s Ridge, and the family
lived there several years. Mr. Gillett
carried on successfully breeding cattle,
until free selection, under the Robertson
Act, resulted in most of the large runs
being selected
In the ’sixties, he went to live on his
farm s on the Coldstream, which included
the farms now occupied by Messrs. Jas
O'Hara, Frank Blanch, Cecil Jackson
an 1 Vaughan, and he resided there until
his deatli on March 17, 1880, us a result
of being thrown from a horse when re-
turning from a visit' to his daughter at
Woodford Island. The injuries he re-
ceived, combined with his great age,
caused his death,
'1 liis grand old pioneer and shipbuilder
was laid to rest in tlie Clmarra cemetery,
his remains being followed to the grave-
side by people from all parts of the. river,
who came to pay'their respects to a man
who was honest and upright in all his
dealings.
Mr. Gillett played a most important
part in the earliest history of the Clar-
ence, and the records of jliis work should
be obtained and recorded.
SAILING SHIP, THE TWINS.
Mr. Gillett was survived by two
daughters., one of whom, Mrs. James
0 Tiara, lives on the Coldstream, on one
of ttie farms held by her father in the
early ’sixtiea now owned by her son,
James E. O’Hara.
Mrs. O’Hara, who is more than 8i)
years of age, was born on Woodford
Island, and was a girl of six years,
when her mother died. She remembers
the launching of the sailing ship, Thu,
T wins, on the Tweed Krver. The snip was
afterwards lost on the Manning Bar.
Mrs O’Hara also remembers the early
days spent with her father on the cattle
run, and the q'uick selection of the pro
perty that iolrowcd. The flood retuge at
Gillett’s Ridge is now the remaining un-
selected a#ea of the huge holding held
by her late father.
The other daughter of Mr. Gillet was
Mrs. Mat Oliisler, of Mullumbimby, wh
died recently. ,
Four sous of this old pioneer ore Mr.
“Jack” Gillett, of South Grafton, and
the late Messrs. Richard and Henry
Gillett and Edward Gillett, of Middle
Cieek.
MONUMENT TO A PIONEER.
• There is a monument ovor his grave
in the Clmarra cemetery, to mark the
resting place of Henry (jillet. There ’is
another monument in the work he did,
improving the farming lands on the banks
of the Coldstream, which to-day rank
among some of the best holdings in the
Middle Clarence. Olllett’s Ridge will al-
ways perpetuate the name of this sturdy
o.d pioneer.
It is claimed that Craig was the first
man to discover the whereabouts of the
Clarence River. In view of the advent
of Thomas. Small and Henry Gillett aud
party to the river in 1836, our centenary
of Clartence River settlement is near at
hand, and something should be done at
once to get the initial work of com-
memorating such an important event
under way.


. ABORIGINALS
Of The Clarence
SOME HISTORICAL FACTS
THEIR EMPLOYMENT
SEEKING HANDS FOR THE LAND.
•(By Dunean MeFarlane.) '
While in my cany teens 1 accompanied
pater to a camp of the Swan C'.eeic triLT
in a clump of brush at the rear of the
farms in the direction of Ulmarra, with
the object of engaging hands lo assist in
clearing the land.
Oor entry was heralded by a discordant
yelping of eanines which sallied out from
some -0 camps to announce our approach.
The pack.was composed of nondescript
eross-breds, being tne pronounced type
that would defy the most expert fancier
to discriminate the pedigroes of the
obviously not overfed mongrels that ful-
filled watch duty. However, they obeyed
ihe restraining order of their owuers, en-
abiing us to eoucontnito attention on u‘
camp on the outer margin • of the habita-
tion. . •
A brazen crescent strung on the forked
support of a bark covering denoted that
it was the regal residence, though not
with any palatial pretensions to, dis-
tinguish it from the abodes of the 1 king’s
subjects. The only emblem of distinc-
tion Was that • there were two queens
sharing the protection of the humble tene :
ment, for his royal highness enjoyed tlie
privilege of having a couple of wives* as
members of ' the household. - Tlie trio
appeared to live on amicable terms us
they squatted together surrounded with
camp paraphernalia on the ground floor
of the domicile.
There were no princes or princesses
visible. They may have been amusing
themselves with the family picanninies
of the clan, although these did not ex-
tensively increase the population of the
tribe. Aboriginal families seldom ex-
ceeded two or three and birth control was
not a perplexing problem with the black
race. Possibly there were no juveniles
to partake of the joyal board and lodging
conveniences, and if kingly rights were
hereditary, it became a question as to
who would become entitled to don the
metallic emblem of brass presented by our
Australian Government to an uncrowned
king; nevertheless bearing tin inscription
indicating that he was monarch of a yeiy
much circumscribed territory. His power
•was also extremely limited, certainly not
nearly approaching the ambitions of
would-be dictators of later date.
We did not request the chief to under:
take employment on tne land we pur-
chased from his restricted realm, but in-
formed him or our mission. His response
was to solicit a plug of tobacco, a usual,
tribute demanded by the abo, correspond-
ing to the backsheesh of his ancestors in
Arabia Felix.
His attire was not becoming the dig-
nity of the position. He certainly was
elad in a black cloth suit, or what re-
mained of the-superfine costume made
to order for a wedding garment or'for a
local squire elevated to the Magisterial
Bench desiring to appear respectably
arrayed for the swearing in eeremony. It
served the wearer on numerous 1 occasions
at celebrations in “The Settlement,’’ but
it degenerated to many degrees below the
-econdhnnd stage before i” was relegated
as K.o. 1 garb for King Billy The vest
•was minus nearly all of the brass button
adornment, the pants carried evidence of
long service, The coat, of the clawhammer
type, was bereft of. one of tlie tail flaps,
and resembled, that of a Hibernian after
a fair.
He condesecndinglv loft ns to on*
mission. At its conclusion, wow"r r ‘
escorted from the-seclusion of the fiuin'i
-overt by the yelping hounds that
announced our arrival.
ENGAGING ABORIGINAL LABOR.
Hiring abos for tlie various avenues
which they are capable of performing re-
quires tact and experience. The abo is
not enamored of toil, more especially it
it is arduous or painstaking. lie did verv
little in the felling of the, dense brush and
was more expert in the use of the toma-
hawk than the heavier American imple-
ment. • In felling large timber the aoo
when his services could be enlisted, be-
came alarmed when tne veteran fig trees
commenced to crack and .made off to a
safe distance, allowing his less timorous
white companions to complete the.finish-
ing process. This type .of growth com-
menced signalling its impending prostra-
tion for a quarter of an hour ere it was
stretched on the turf, despite the telling
blows of two or -three capable axemen.
Binghi preferred to witness the arboreal
funeral from beyond a radius reach from
the base,. -
For burning off the blacks were in
their element, as they were fire wor-
shippers and enjoyed tho glow of earnp
embers as well as the furnace heat of
blazing piles of timber, producing a - tem-
perature considerably -augmented by the
semi-tropical fierceness of a'summer sun.
They divested themselves of superfluous
clothing and their' scant attire resembled
the surf costumes that have become the
fashion of tho Manly, Coogee, and other
beaches. In this respect tho watering
resorts -are closely approximating the
nudity stage of the Australian native,
creating a comparison invoking muen
adverse criticism.
PLANTING AND HARVESTING.
Planting maize by hoe, as adopted by
tlie early pioneefs, was not entrusted to
the abo who had not a proper perspec-
tive of distance between rows or -the
separation of sets; nor tho number of
grains to be placed in each set, usually
three or four. lie did his part in
chipping the prolific crop of weeds When
the' maize was growing and the black
labor was extensively utilised , in har-
vesting the crop. In the operations noted
both sexes were employed. In pulling
and husking the abos exhibited dexterity
and in threshing they rendered much
assistance to the maize grower. After
removal of the crop they took a share in
clearing, the' heavv growth of rubbish in
preparation for the next planting.
In tho potato fields the blacks took a
turn at digging the tubers, but this was
♦he -rim total oT their scr*-i-e. In this
the Hindoo entered the gathering process
and in the dark labor rivalry scored
against the Austral'an spade operator.

These were'the leadin'* crops on .toe
ninrence and the part the natives par-
took in their culture has been noted.
Engagement per week or contract was
the system adopted and it was difficult to
keep the contractors to • their bargains.
THE DAILY EXAMINER, TUESDAY, JULY 23, 1935
The weekly remuneration was payable l>y
promise at the wien-cud and it was a
very noiuiiml amount in cash, supple- .
mouted, however, by daily perks of-
tobacco 'and rations.
Hours were not statutory and’ tbo
laborers arrived from camp with the sun
several hours-over the horizon and they
suspended operations when it was con-
siderably above the western tree tops. ;
They did not belong to the snndownir
class, but after’procuring their flour, tea,
sugar and hneca allowance made a be>-
line across intervening fields to start the
camp-fires burning.
BINGHI’S OPINION.
If there was diversion in the shape of
a fight or festivity duiing mid-week, cm- -
ployment was set aside, but the employer
could rest assured that Binghi would
turn up on Saturday, the stated pay day,
to claim bi 3 wage.' It was his opinion,
despite the absences from service, that
the.laborer was worthy of his.hire.
When piecework was arranged ration-
ing was on the daily or weekly principle,
payment in full on completion. A married
couple took the- contract and did not
hurry with the job, drawing provisions
during its currency. When the contract
approached the stage that a dozen or 15
could finish it in a day a contingent
assembled and woiked like Trojans in
order lo have an orgy on the proceed*.
This meant that a spree was the out-
come, for the law of prohibition in con-
nection with • the natives ' was obsen e 1
more in its infringement than in tl-o
keeping. There was no difficulty for
the b'.or-ks to convert their bard earned
ca«h into intoxicants by intermediary or
otherwise. 'A. carousal in the . bosh
where the - camp was situated followed
the conclusion of- the contract on Farmer ;
Caprieornieus' clearing.
Binghi was not oyerscrupulons in
adhering to his engagement, and lie did
not consider violating it with much con-,
cern. lie had a liking for formulating
conditions of employment favoring com-
mencing operations at a future time. To-
morrow was often. stipfflnten, or the in :
definite by and bye gave him a bettor
excuse for evasion. The bargain was
frequently sealed by a ping of tobacco,
an old shirt, a short ration, but this
backsheesh -often covered full , deposi’
and balance, of the contract. By and
hvo indicated a future that suited the
black professedly labor* seeker and proved
a fruitful term of evnsion.
VAGUE IDEA OF CHRONOLOGY.
Tho abo’s idea of chronology was most
vague. The year was crudely calculated
or computed by the lunar months as is
the case with illiterate nationalities. So
many moons indicated by the hand digi.S
disclosed past or future events as the
mental capacity to describe them could .
be brought into requisition. The change
of seasons came found without the aid
of a prescribed calendar, the atmospheric
influence on.the thinly clad dark skin
denoted tho advent of winter and the
exit of the much appreciated summer sun,
for the native enjoyed a three-'figurc
thermometer reading much more than a
low temperature, Sun bathing as they
lay- prostrato in the open for hours was
one of tho natural luxuries of their lives,
and if engaged corn-husking in the har-
vesting season they would plead to have
the cartloads tipped in the open in order
to enjoy a sunshine warmth.
The gift, of instinet operated strongly
in the abo. He journeyed through the
trackless ibush without chart, tree*
mark or compass, and never missed his
destination. In this respect he re-
sembled tho locality instinct of tho
horse, ox, or canine. Obstacles in tho
shape of dense brush, tangled jungle, or .
rugged country, • presented no serious
impediment to the bush traveller, and it'
was noted that, even when connecting
roads were constructed, the blnckfcllovy
chose his own route, lopping off bends auD
deviations associated with the surveyed
highway.
It is true that they possessed-the a*t
of tracking to a high degree and with
keenness of eyesight this availed them
much in traversing the bush or locating
game. This wonderful gift enabled the
naked eve' Imshman to obtain employment
at police stations and by his keenno"s ■
of vision he became a valuable acquisi-
tion to the detective branch in arrestin'*
criminals -o- discovering stock that bad
been clandestinely annexed. The way-
farer on Ms jonmev seldom carried much
in his tucker bn-. Imt deoended on what
tuck placed w : *Mn his reach in the shnno
«f food. Fire was obtainable by Ihe
friction of two drv ; sticks (grass tree
twigs for preference) and soon the
nroma of ron«*-—venison permeated the
atmt)sphere of the forest.
The darky has no written meteorologi-
cal guide, but has a natural premonition
of weather changes. We found that.in
the flooded valley of the Clarence the
abos trekked off to the hills with more
celerity than the fanners ' drove their
stock to the nearest refuge.- It was
alleged that they took warning from the
small black ants which invariably re-
move the eggs of Hie low-lying, nest to
a convenient and safe Whether
this observation of insect instinct wa’s
the cause of Binghi’s retreat from im-
pending flood or whether he is similarly
endowed, wo cannot say, but the tribes-
men are never ove>taken by deluge dis-
aster. The wild animal refugees be-
come a prey for the abo and his stomach
requirements are replenished without
much effort on the nart. of the hunter.
NATIVE POLICE STATION.
A native police station was established
on tho Orara about a dozen miles smith
of Grafton, and here the members of the
black guardians of the force fulfil *«
various bush detective duties under in-
struction from . the chief constable at
the settlement, as tho , local head was
designated in those days. This was
known for many years as the native
poliee station and was situated on ' one
of the old pastoral holdings of tho Clar-
ence.

i PLACE NAMES.
Referring more particularly' Jo tho
• language of the abos, it must be ad
i mitted that names given to places in.tie
> district having native designation or
■ derivation had an attractive prommeia-
• lion, while certain vowe's worn give i
■ prominence in nomenclature. The double
t “o’’ was freely used, as for instance
Woolgoolgn, Oolmarrsi (Elmarra), Oorar.i
- fOrara), Oorunga • (Urimga), and where
> is there a more' pronounced term' than
• Woolloomooloo, loiig recognised place.of
i reformation and riird. discipline. It wi-1
- be noticed that. like several European
’ language* the Austral,';ui words ended
- with a vowel, ns Ynrjba and several of
- the names just quoted, the letter “a”
■ showing promincntlv. ns a final. The
i naming of towns’* rivers or any natural
t feature having special significance was
‘ndopted by surveyors or explorers.
The abos in respect to their individual
i appellation had their own distinctive
i address, but were described by their em-
s plovers bv Christian names, sueh ns
I fhorley, Billv, Neddy, .Tack, Kitty. Biddv,
- Marv and Nellie. Distinctive names were
; applied to some of the .ste”ner sex, ns
i Pumpkin, Bandicoot, Billy Blneahirt, and
s Boncv. In one instance three sons of

Where an employe- became a fn-o-i’c

vasts in the Emerald Isle, he • took his

of old settlers perpetuated in black and
