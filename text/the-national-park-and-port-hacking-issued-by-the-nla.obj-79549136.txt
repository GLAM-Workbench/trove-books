THE NATIONAL LARK and
EORT HACKING,
New South Wales
The National Park of New South Wales
is one of the most magnificent recreation
grounds in the whole world. In point of
size it is second only to the Great Yellow-
stone Park in the United States; for
beauty of forest and coastal scenery it is
unsurpassed; and it enjoys in addition the
all-important advantage of accessibility,
since the vast area of 36,300
acres lies only 16 miles from
the Metropolis of the State.
This immense people?s reserve'


consists mostly of high tableland, the plateaux varying in altitude from 350 to 900 feet above
sea-level, and from many of the elevations extepsive, sometimes superb, and never-wearying
views of the ocean and the surrounding country can be obtained. Summer or winter?in fact,
the whole year round ?the air of these uplands is pure and invigorating to the jaded citizens of
Sydney and her suburbs. Deep glens and gorges divide the high table-lands, and these valleys,
scooped out by natural forces during past ages, possess a wealth of picturesque and quiet beauty.
Some of the gorges are thickly studded with majestic trees, which for centuries have grown
in solemn silences unbroken by man?s footfall, like ? green-robed sentinels of mighty woods ? ;
flats of rich soil produce vegetation and foliage, semi-tropical in variety, in wondrous profusion
and loveliness; and perpetual streamlets of pure fresh water trickle down the gullies, keeping
ever-verdant the overhanging vegetation, as they flow on their courses to swell in volume the
principal water-way within the Park boundaries.
The Trustees to whose care the Park has been entrusted spare no pains to preserve
the beautiful flora and fauna. To this end the discharge of fire-arms is prohibited; so too
is interference with the birds, animals, or plants. As the result of this policy of preservation,
the National Park is now the haunt of a great variety of beautiful birds. The parrot family
is represented by numerous species, including the love-bird, the green parrot, and several kinds
of lories, the king parrot, and cockatoos. Honey-birds, unscared by ruthless pursuers, have
made the wattle groves their homes. The almost extinct lyre-bird, free from molestation, can
be daily seen, about sunrise and sunset, seeking its food amongst the brush glades and stately


tree-ferns on the banks of the Bola Creek. Aquatic representatives of the feathered tribes
abound, including cranes and ducks of all descriptions; and occasionally flocks of wild geese
light upon the cleared flats abutting on the river bank. Swans, both black and white, and wild
ducks have become so used to the fact that contact with humanity does not necessarily mean
molestation, that they will, on the fresh water, often follow a boat for miles and feed from the
hands of its occupants, On the mountain tops and in the sheltered vales, on the hill-side and
on the sea-shore, on the
grassy flats and in the
forest thickets, native
wild flowers grow in rich
profusion. The native
rose, pungent in odour and
purple in bloom, can, in
the spring, be found in
abundance; our national
flower, the waratah,
thrives in congenial soil
and situation ; but
beauteous amongst the
beautiful is the gigantic

lily which, in proper season, rears its elongated stem, surmounted with glowing blossoms, in all
parts of the Park. Bangalow and cabbage-tree palms, tree and other ferns, abound, and as
year succeeds year these exquisite trees, owing to careful preservation, are becoming more
numerous and nearer the perfection of maturity.
Means of Access.
There are several ways of approaching the Park. The South Coast Railway skirts the
western boundary, and from Loftus a branch line runs out to the National Park Terminus.
The railway fares are exceedingly reasonable, the ordinary return fare being?first-class 2 /6,
second-class 1 /6. On Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, and by the 2 p.m. train on Wednesdays
the return fare is reduced to 1/6 first and 1/- second-class. Another route is by road from
Sydney through Kogarah, across George?s River, and thence by the main Illawarra Road
to Sutherland and Loftus. A third is by sea from Port Jackson or Botany Bay to Port
Hacking, then along the river to Audley. Portions of the Park ?including the Waterfalls?
are within reasonable walking distance of Waterfall railway station; but the most convenient
means of access for the majority of visitors is via Loftus and National Park stations,
although there is more frequent train service to Sutherland, and its railway station is but a
mile further from the Park than Loftus. Audley is about three-quarters of a mile from
National Park station, 2 miles from Loftus, and 3 miles from Sutherland. Vehicles to


A National Park Landscape, showing Saltwater River.


The Rest,? Audley, Nationai Park, New South Wales


convey parties from the railway stations may be secured by sending notice through the
Secretary at the National Park Trust Office, 5 Bligh-street, Sydney. The fare by
vehicle from Sutherland to Audley is 1/6, Loftus to Audley 1 /-, and fiom National
Park station to Audley qd. each adult, and a similar rate is charged for the return from
Audley to any of the railway stations mentioned.
Accommodation and Refreshments.
At ?The Rest? (Audley) and Warumbul (Port Hacking) first-class accommodation is
provided for visitors for the day or an extended term, the tariff rate being Bs. 6d. and Bs. per
day respectively, hot lunch only, 2s. 6d. per head.
At ?The Rest? thirty visitors can be provided for, and twenty at Warumbul, and,
in addition, the lessee, Mr. Hugh D. Mclntosh, has a number of furnished cottages
at Gundimain, on the Port Hacking River, en route from Audley to Warumbul, as well as
at Warumbul, at rentals of about 30s. per week. Arrangements regarding meals will be
made to suit tenants, as may be required. Tea and light refreshments are obtainable at
all hours at either ? The Rest ? or Warumbul, and hampers are made up for picnic parties
on the shortest notice. All arrangements may be completed at the Sydney office when
booking. ?The Rest,? Audley, is situated on the freshwater river, and Warumbul is on
the salt estuary of the Hacking, 6 miles nearer L the coast. The lessee?s own motor launch

Boating Facilities.
There is ample boating accommodation, but
to prevent disappointment on Sundays in Summer
and on holidays notice should be given to the boat
proprietor, Audley, tel. 971. The charges for boats
are 3/- for half a day and 5/- for the whole day. An
increased rate of hirage is charged on holidays.


Parties desiring to engage a steam or oil launch, may do so at the boat-sheds, Audley. The
chaige for a launch is 30/' to �2 per day. A launch will leave the dam at Audley on Monday
to Fiiday at 10 a.m., and on Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, at n - i5 a.m., running to South-
west Arm, Warumbul, and Deer Park, and returning from Warumbul at 3-45 p.m.; fare, 1/-
the round trip (with a minimum of 5/-). A launch will leave for the Fish Hatchery,
Gunnamatta Bay, at the same hours, returning from the Hatchery at 1 p.m.; fare, 2/-
(minimum, 10/). Launches can be engaged to run specially to Warumbul or South-west
Arm, at 1/- per head each way (minimum charge each way, 7/6). From National Park
station a good track has been made for pedestrians to gain access to the banks of the
river below the dam, without going to Audley.
Audley.
A good road runs from the National Park platform to Audley. This is a lovely
spot, beautiful and unique in its situation. ? The Rest? House, occupying a most favoured
site in the group of buildings forming the settlement, is on a rocky platform, levelled from the
face of the hill, overlooking the confluence of the fresh waters of Port Hacking River and
Kangaroo Creek. Between the building and the stream runs a road, to the west of which is
the vegetable and fruit garden, bounded along the water?s brink by an English blackberry-


bush fence. In full view from
the verandah two valleys and two
streams meet. Port Hacking River
glides along its vale immediately
in front, while on the right
Kangaroo Creek runs down to
Robertson Knoll, the dividing spur,
which, high and wooded to its
summit, abruptly terminates here,
and the united waters move
smoothly and almost imperceptibly
along a broader reach to the dam.
The accommodation at ? The Rest ?
comprises everything required in an
up-to-date boarding establishment
with a first-class service. Fishing
lines, tobacco, cigars, &c. are all
stocked. There are a number of
other buildings in the vicinity.

Fort Hacking River.
It is undoubtedly advisable for visitors to the National Park to make their first
excursion on the salt and tidal waters of the Port Hacking River, for their somewhat wild
and rugged beauty will assist to emphasise the fairyland-like charms of other portions of
this immense domain of the nation. For parties, the best means to view the portions of
the river under notice is by launch, which can be hired at the rate of 30/- per day, on
application either by letter or telephone to the Secretary to the Trust, at the office, 5
Bligh-street, Sydney, or direct to the proprietor, Telephone 971.
Fishing in Fort Hacking.
The waters of Port Hacking abound with edible fish. The schnapper, the most
valuable of all the Australian fish tribe, is to be caught near most of the rocky points and
reefs; the red bream, in sizes from the smallest to the squire, haunts almost every deep
hole between the dam and the Heads; the black rock cod, considered to be the fish of the
most delicate flesh in Australian waters, is another denizen of the deep rocky holes; and
there is an abundance of jewfish, tarwhine, flathead, sand and sea whiting, black bream
flounder, and flying gurnard. Suitable fishing boats can be secured at Audley- Without walk-
ing to Audley, pedestrians can reach the left bank of the river by following a specially cut


?track that leads from the terminal railway station
and ?=nds near the training walls. Good fishing
with the rod and light tackle is procurable on any of
the sand flats, or in the channels deepened hv
Mgipi the training walls. Success, however, depends on
suitable bait. and experience teaches that the best
W for this part of the river is either green prawns or
salt-water worms. For deep-water fishing further
down the stream or in Port Hacking, strong tackle and suitable
bait are indispensable to good sport. Mullet, squid, and yellowtail
are tempting bait for the larger fish, and nothing better than
fresh well-grown green prawns has been yet used for the different
I kinds of bream and the smaller edible species. Although fish will
bite intermittently throughout the day, the time and tide must
| be chosen to command success. In broad daylight, with the
full glare of the sun upon the water, with the tide rising of
falling, the most likely place for sport is in the river on the sand
| flats, extending from the training walls to the shallows opposite
and below Swallow Rock, and anywhere along the sandbanks of
Mangrove Island, for these are the feeding grounds of whiting,

In similar circumstances flat-
head and flounder can be
hooked on the sand flats
and in the shallow waters
of the numerous bays in
Port Hacking. The deep-
water fish, such as schnapper,
squire, jewfish, and rock cod,
bite most ravenously [early
in the morning and at dusk,
and undoubtedly the best
tide is the young flood.
Sydney tide tables, as pub-
lished in Moore?s Almanac
and Country Directory, are
sufficient guide for fishing
purposes, but an allowance
of an hour and three-
quarters, as compared with
Fort Denison, must be made
for high and low water at
Port Hacking. Little difti

they have all been well

Warumbul.
Warumbul is the great marine and chief fishing resort of National Park, being
reached by launch daily from Audley or by road?4 miles. A number of picturesque resi-
dences on the land to the northward (the grounds on which they stand having been
purchased prior to the dedication of the park) give an air of permanent settlement to the
locality. A substantially built and charmingly situated weatherboard cottage, for the
accommodation of visitors, has been erected at this point by the Trustees. Close by, on the
right, is a charming little bight, known as Warumbul Bay. This is sheltered on all sides,
and is reached by a winding pathway from the house. It is fenced across the mouth with
steel network, and is provided with a dressing-room and diving-platform for bathers. The
bottom is of fine clear sand, and the bay is much affected by visitors to this pleasant
spot. Warumbul has already become a favourite fishing resort, situated as it is within
hail of the best fishing grounds of Port Hacking and the South-west Arm. Oysters are
obtainable in abundance.
The River above the Dam.
After a thorough inspection of the Port Hacking River, from the dam at Audley
downwards, the visitor cannot do better than obtain a pulling boat and view the very
different scenery on the freshwater stream. One notable peculiarity of the Port Hacking


River lies in the fact that throughout the whole of its fresh-
water course it runs due north, being the only river in New
South Wales which flows in that direction. A dam separates
the tidal from the fresh waters at Audley, and this structure
backs up the stream for about 5 or 6 miles. The river
for that distance was snagged and cleared of other obstructions j
during the early days of the Park Trust, and is now one of
the most placid and beautiful features of this most beautiful
reserve. Above the dam the river
is one of the most favourite resorts ; ~ :" r
of visitors. Silvery stretches, with
scarcely a perceptible flow, extend I V-j
between wooded heights and jungle- s'.!i
like vegetation growing in luxuriant
beauty to the water?s edge. Fern- -m- ? �?
trees, cabbage-tree and bangalow
palms, lend a semi-tropical appear- ,
ance to the scene. A thousand

save at holiday time, no sounds can be' heard except the musical splash of the stream
as it is gently kissed by some passing zephyr, the call of some bush bird to its mate,
or the cry of wild fowl.
Lady Carrington Drive.
For the entire distance through which the river is navigable above the dam the Lady
Carrington Drive follows the course of the stream, and occasional glimpses of the drive are
obtainable through the vegetation on the western banks. The section of the Park lying
between Audley and Waterfall railway station, which is opened by the Lady Carrington
and Waterfall roads, a distance of 10 miles, for picturesque attractions, is unequalled in
any part of the domain, and, although perhaps more imposing prospects can be obtained from
the hilltops overlooking the sea, it may safely be said that no tract in the 36,300 acres
reserve possesses in richer affluence those varied beauties of foliage, forest, and river which
have conferred upon this particular piece of country so high a reputation. For the lover of
Nature, no tour of the Park could be devised of a more pleasing character than that
from Waterfall to Audley, or from Audley to Waterfall. For cyclists there is an en-
trancing trip, although the road is rough in places, by continuing past the upper dam
instead of climbing the hill to Waterfall. The route runs through exceedingly picturesque
scenery, and brings the rider out at Otford, a little village just below Bald Hill. When the
hill bevond Otford is climbed, the Pacific Ocean and Stanwell Park are right below.

Waterfall Road.
Waterfall road starts at the 7-mile peg from Audley, trends to the left, and crosses
The Saddle ?a depression in the island ?and several smaller spurs which converge in this
locality. The road is an excellent gravel-dressed carriage drive, at times almost flush with
the brawling river, after its detour round the far side of the island. Compared with its lower
reaches, the stream runs swiftly over a stony bed, its waters being in places obscured by
overhanging boughs and scrub. Palms fringe the roadside, and trees of much larger growth,
with far-outstretching limbs intercept the sun?s rays, and render cool and pleasant the drive
below. Further on a substantial masonry crossing backs the water for about a mile towards
the river?s source, leaving close to the causeway a lake-like reach, bounded by green and
wooded slopes. Looking southward from the crossing, one of the most enchanting scenes
in the National Park meets the eye; in fact, from Lady Carrington Bower on this route, one
almost becomes satiated with beauties. From the upper causeway the river appears a placid
lake, reflecting on its exquisitely clear waters the gigantic trees on either side, whose trunks
are entwined and adorned with undergrowths spreading down right to the edge of the water.

Other Drives.
The road from Audley ascends the steep hill rising abruptly from the river for about a
mile, where it subdivides, one branch leading to Gundimain, 2 miles, where several furnished
cottages are available for visitors, another serving the Deer Park, where a number of these
animals are being bred for stocking purposes. Other roads lead to Warumbul (3 miles), with
its comfortable accommodation and beautiful aspect, baths and oysters, and Wattamolla, a
beautifully safe beach and anchorage on the Pacific frontage. Although these roads are
fairly rough and narrow, in most instances motors will have very little difficulty in traversing
them, and extensive panoramic views of sea and landscape are obtainable from many points.
Vehicles may be secured at Loftus from the coach proprietor, or the lessee of ? The Rest,?

Aboriginal Carvings.
In a cave- Gibber Gunya, or rock-house ?at the rear of the caterer?s quarters at
Audley, overlooking Kangaroo Creek, are a number of highly interesting drawings and
markings by aboriginal dwellers, probably executed before the Caucasian ever set foot upon
these shores. At the entrance to the cave in question, on an oval background of red, is a
beautifully-finished design of a free-hand character in black with white markings. What


was intended to be represented neither the writer nor any other person who has examined
the elaborate design can say; but the beauty of its curves, and its generally pleasing
outlines, display that the executant possessed a considerable amount of artistic instinct.
Inside the cave are dozens of imprints of hands in grey, black, brown, and red pigments,
which have eaten into the soft sandstone. In the darkest corner of the cave is the drawing
of a shark, which evidences a rudimentary idea of perspective. The outline is in black,
the dorsal fins are tinted red, and the contour of the body is marked in white lines.
Along the rear of the cave are a number of outline drawings, in black, of fishes, while at
the extreme corner is a remarkable imprint of a hand with seven fingers. On the flat
rocks at Jibbon are the outlines of three whales, one 12 feet 6 inches long, and another
39 feet long, while a third, 32 feet in length by 12 feet in width, is marked across the
centre by two transverse parallel straight lines. A shark (15 feet long), a turtle (10 feet), a
schnapper (4 feet), a human hand, a sting-ray (9 feet), and a wallaby (6 feet) are also here
carved on the rock. The head of the wallaby is extremely lifelike, as likewise is the
outline of a seagull?s head. There are also a number of other carvings, which are, however,
not identifiable.
