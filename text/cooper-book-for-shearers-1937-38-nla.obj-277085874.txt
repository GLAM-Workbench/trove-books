COOPER ENGINEERING COMPANY
PTY, LIMITED


To the Shearers
of Australia
Herewith we present the Second Yearly
Edition of the COOPER BOOK FOR
SHEARERS. We hope you will find it
interesting and useful. We received
some very nice letters of praise last
vear from shearers about the 193 6 Book,
and we have tried to make this one
even better. Included in it are a great
many new features suggested by shearers
since the first Book was published.
1936 saw a great many changes in
awards and allowances.' All the latest,
up-to-date tables and reckoners are in
the Book. The new rates make possible
a fine increase in your earning power.
Using Cooper Combs and Cooper Cut-
ters is another way to increase your
earnings without expending any more
effort. Cooper Combs this year are at a
higher pinnacle of perfection than ever
—we guarantee them absolutely perfect in
finish. Cooper Cutters scored, as you
know, a tremendous success last year'
this year they are even finer, if that is
possible.
Together, these wonderful present-day
Cooper Combs and Cooper Cutters make
real team-mates, pulling your tallies up
to new and higher earnings figures.
Cooper Combs and Cooper Cutters Shear More
Sheep Because They Last Longer and
Are Easier to Grind.


Widest Throw
of Any Pin Hole Cutter
E-B-7
Throws All the Way Across
Full Throw Right Up to the End
Wider spacing between teeth gives wider
throw. Has full throw even when worn down
thin. Perfect throw even when handpiece is
badly worn in eccentric race.
Gives perfect mesh with teeth of comb. Best
Cutter for the combs with the new wide tooth
spacing. When slightly worn is also excellent
for standard tooth spacing combs.
NOTE THE PATENT OVAL o HOLE
Made specially for Fork Tip Drive. Fork
tips in some handpieces are too close together:
in others too far apart. Cooper Cutters fit
them all. No other cutter does. It’s the Patent
Oval Hole does it. Adjusts itself to every
variation in fork tip spacing.
USE THIS E-B-7 CUTTER WITH COOPER
No. 7, No. 10 AND CONCAVE COMBS
Available without pinholes, to fit old style
handpieces. Ask for Cooper AA Cutter.

The
First
Efficient
Concave
Comb
COOPER CONCAVE
incorporating the Famous Cooper
Parallel Sides Principle
Vital improvements in a Concave Arc Comb.
Wide tooth spacing, 2iin. cut.
Parallel Sided Inner Teeth. Gullets just as
wide at cutting point as where wool enters
gullet. No cramming at point of cut.
Shallow Arc. Bigger radius lightens combing
by end teeth. Old style concaves have deeper
arc, making end teeth comb more than their
share.
Bottom Tooth Thinned Oat. STRENGTH
combined with SPEED.
Straight Sides. For easy entry. No curves
to drag.
‘Down” Angle on End Teeth. More speed
than curved teeth, yet same advantages for
guides and runners.
Use Cooper E-B-7 Wide Throw Cutler


Fastest in Hard Sheep
COOPER ONE LONG TOOTH
The best all-round comb. Safe and fast.
Made for right or left hand shearing. Cuts
slightly under 2Jin. Uses 2Jin. cutter.
Curved Long Top Tooth. Curved OUT to
act as guide. Curved DOWN to form a smooth,
safe runner.
Short Bottom Tooth. No extra length to
push into woo! before cutting.
Best Comb for Learners
Easiest and safest. Helps make a good, fast
shearer right from the start.
Also available with BENT Bottom Tooth.

READY RECKONER — SHEARING and CRUTCHING, per 100


No Other Comb Like It
COOPER TRIUMPH
The Only Convex Comb Having Straight
Outside Teeth that Cuts 21" with
21" Cutter
The perfect shearing combination, proved by
years of successful results. Thousands of
shearers will use no other.
Proper Thickness of End Teeth
Allows a good margin of EXTRA throw even
with a worn cutter. Cutter reaches end teeth
before slowing down for completion of stroke;
hence gives a clean sharp blow across the end
tooth gullet, instead of squeezing and pulling
wool as with some other combs. With Cooper
Triumph the cutter slows down ON FACE of
end tooth, not IN GULLET of end tooth, as
with others.
THICKER End Teeth make STRONGER
end teeth.
End Teeth Deflected DOWN and UP, making
perfect runners. (The famous Cyma Curve.)
No Outward Bends, hence faster.
Straight Sides push into wool easily; no re-
sistance.
Curved Sweep Inside End Teeth, for easier
combing.
Has the Famous Cyma Curve


"All the years I hare been
shearing I never had a Hand-
piece to cut like the E-B. I was
never near the expert with it."
Extract from one of many letters
received from shearers.
The Handpiece that Makes
the Big Tallies Possible
Lighter on Combs and Cutters
Ends All Rock Troubles
No Loosening of Tension Nut
LIGHT, COOL, EASY TO GRIP

Only Cooper Has The Famous
Cyma Curved Comb Teeth
Protected by Bristow Patent 23041
Note how it rides the skin, no fear of stab-
bing. Note, too, that entire curve is kept bt-
LOW the grinding level. Hence it lasts right
through the life of the comb, regardless of re-
peated grindings.
Read These Extracts from the Patent
“The purpose of this invention is to provide
easy penetration into the wool without risk of
slitting the skin. . . . The teeth are dipped
downwardly and forwardly of the cutting area,
so that the dipped parts will not be touched in
grinding, even when comb is worn. Ihe teeth
points are maintained in their original shape, the
bevelling on their edges not at any time suffer
ing grinding when the cutting area is ground.
Consequently a long taper on the points may be
used instead of a stub taper as heretofore.
One of Eleven Important Claims Granted
"A shearing machine comb having the comb
teeth in parallel arrangement terminating in
an arcuate curve and each downbent in a
cyma curve with blunted points tipped slightly
upward and located below the ultimate grind-
ing level.”
Cooper Triumph and Nos. 3,4, 5 and 7
Combs have the Cyma Curve


Equal Outward End-Tooth
Bends Divide Wool Equally
COOPER No. 5
Each gullet gathers its share of wool. Extra
width of cut is divided evenly between end
teeth No unequal cramming of bottom tooth.
Cuts 2jin.
CYMA CURVE at Tooth Points, giving down-
ward and upward bend to ride skin safely.
End Teeth Thinned Out for easy running,
without losing tooth strength.

hundreds of Australian fellow workers.
Made in Australia
Every stroke of work on Cooper Combs and
Cutters is done in Australia. Skilled Aus-
tralian workers here are turning out a product
no overseas maker can equal THE BEST
COMBS AND CUTTERS MADE. We are proud
of the fact that we can, here in Australia,
turn out a first-class quality product, raise
the standard of finish and sell at the same
price. There is no duty on combs and cutters
coming into Australia. Hence we do not enjoy
the protection hundreds of other Australian
industries do. Yet by efficient methods and
long manufacturing experience we are able to
compete with foreign makers and give the
shearers of Australia the best combs and cut-
ters made anywhere in the world.

PARTS OF COOPER E-B HANDPIECE


INSTRUCTIONS
for the Care and Operation of
COOPER E-B Handpiece
NOTE: The Cooper E-B Handpiece used with
PATENTED Cooper E-B Cutter is guaranteed
to give complete satisfaction. The Cooper
E B Cutter is especially designed for fork tip
drive. No other cutler has its patented fea-
tures. We cannot accept responsibility for
mishap caused by using other makes of
cutters.
The OVAL hole in the left outside tooth of
the Cooper E-B Cutter is an exclusive Cooper
patent. It is a vital feature in
the pin-hole type of cutter.
It insures proper seating of
the conical fork tips, even if
fork tips vary in their spacing.
Most fork tips do.
When the tips in the fork are too far apart,
the yokes will not swivel. And when the
tips in the fork are too close together, they
will not seat properly, and the tension is poor.
This cannot happen with the Cooper EB
Cutter. The patent oval hole takes care of
too wide or too narrow spacing. Every E-B
Cutter fits every fork.
IMPORTANT: Do not release the tension on
the E-B Handpiece before throwing out of gear.
The tension nut is so constructed that tension
can be taken off after machine has stopped.


OILING. —The Cooper E B Handpiece is
fitted with an oil well which lubricates the
main spindle. Fill this oil well at least twice
daily while the shear is being used. Oil the
joint spindle, cogs, fork cups and points of
the fork regularly. Do not overlook the cup
in the tension nut. Keep the tension nut sleeve
and tension nut filled with grease. Set the
handpiece on its side when it is idle. Surplus
oil in the body of the machine will then run
into the nut.
TO REMOVE FORK. —Remove tension nut,
tension nut cup or sleeve, tension pin and
screw at the back of tension nut. Lower the
centre post and withdraw fork. When replacing
tension pin put large head uppermost.
TO REPLACE CRANK ROLLER AND FORK.
-—Remove screw on back of handpiece and
thread crank roller on to a piece of stiff wire.
Place the end of the wire on the pin of the
crank head and allow the crank roller to slip
down to the pin. Turn joint spindle until
crank roller is at the bottom or either side of
machine, but not on top. Insert fork and pass
ball race over ball. Replace centre post and
screw and adjust centre post.
Care of fhe E-B (continued).


A User Suggests this Easy Way to Replace
Crank Roller and Fork.
Put crank roller in slot of fork, hold it there
with grease, and insert fork onto crankhead
pin, all in one movement.
Suggested by Mr. C. H. Thrupp, Mitchell,
Qld.
FORK TIPS.—-The tips on the fork which
fit into the cutter need not be replaced until
almost worn away. When this happens, turn
the old yokes on their side with pliers, with-
draw them, and replace new yokes.
JOINT SPINDLE PIN.—To replace, drive
out the old pin (P 144 I) with pin punch. This
pin is tapered. Drive it out from the rivetted
side. Tap new pin in lightly until it fits
closely. Place the short end, which projects,
on the grinder disc. In an instant it will
turn a bluish tint. This removes the temper
from the short end. Set it on end on an anvil
and rivet over. Place rivetted end on grinder
and smooth off, to enable spindle to fit freely
in bayonet joint. Insert spindle in bayonet.
End of pin should not project above outer
surface of bayonet. If it does, grind end off
until level.
E-B PATENT JOINT.—Wear in all joints
is caused by sand and diit rubbing on the
oily surface. The E-B Patent Joint has caps
covering the sides, to keep out sand and dirt,
Care of the E-B (continued).


Examine lugs from time to time and see that
they are not being worn away. Take off caps
and see how much wear has occurred in bottom
surface, which takes the thrust of trunnion
pins. Replace these caps often. Let THEM
take the wear. Wear on the sixpenny caps
means that much or more wear saved on the
costly joint halves.
See that a constant supply of lubricant is
maintained in the caps.
Wash parts of joint thoroughly before each
shearing run, to remove any small accumula-
tion of dirt, and to make sure the bearing
surfaces of the pin are running in good clean
lubricant.
CENTRE POST. —The centre post is set at
the correct height before the handpiece leaves
the factory. Do not alter its position until
necessary. The centre post has nothing to do
with the adjustment of the tension. It is the
pivot on which the fork swings, and is ad-
justable so that the fork can be set not to
strike the shell when extra thick or extra thin
cutters are used.
To obtain correct position;—
Screw in the post until the end is one thread
below the level of nut. Place a comb and
new cutter on machine. Remove large screw
from back of handpiece. Turn joint spindle
until crank roller is on top dead centre. About
one-third of crank roller should now be show-
ing above the top of the pin on crank bead,
level with top of fork. (The Cooper centre post
gauge enables you to get the exact setting
instantly. Carry one with you.) Raise or
lower centre post until correct position is
obtained, and set.
Care of the E-B (concluded).


Only a Cutter
with OVAL Pin Hole is
O.K. for Fork Tip Drive
Only Cooper Has the Oval Hole
Handpiece fork tips are usually too far apart
or too close together. No maker can get them
all alike. But the OVAL hole in Cooper Cutters
overcomes all these variations in fork tip
spacing. It GUARANTEES correct seating of
conical tips regardless. Permits an even ten-
sion on all cutter points. Prevents drag.
Don’t be misled by cutters having BIG
ROUND pin holes. Only an OVAL hole will
work. And only Cooper has the true OVAL
hole. An exclusive Cooper patent.

The Perfect Temper
Every Cooper Has It
Cooper Combs and Cutters shear more sheep
because they are tempered correctly. They
take an edge quickly, without grinding away.
Hence no metal is lost in grinding.
Cooper Combs and Cutters are neither too
soft nor too hard. They have the perfect,
scientific temper that only YEARS of heat
treating experience can give to a product.
There is a vast difference between Cooper
temper and the haphazard, now-tdo-soft, now-
loo-hard temper found in other makes.
READY FOR THE WOOL
No Doing Up Needed
Every new Cooper has the same smooth sur-
face's as a half-worn comb. Put it into the
wool straightaway.
PERFECT FINISH GUARANTEED


INTERESTING FACTS CONCERNING
GRINDING COMBS AND CUTTERS
It is generally recognised that Combs and Cutters last
longer it the heel is ground slightly more than the front
of the teeth. There are several ways of accomplishing this.
The centre of the Magnetic Pendulum should be at the
same height as the centre of the grinder spindle, the pen
dulum rod hanging in the centre of the left-hand grinding
area of the disc. It is here the fastest grinding tabes
place. The spaiks which come from the teeth of the comb
will then closely parallel the teeth themselves.
The distance between Pendulum Rod and Holder and the
Disc has a noticeable effect on grinding from the heel.
Usually a pendulum holder placed iin. away from the disc,
with the two poles of the magnetic holder of equal length
(hence applying pressure from both poles equally), will
grind a COMB faster at the points than at the heel. The
same position will grind the heel of a CUTTER 1$ times
faster than the front. Experience shows a pendulum rod
and holder placed lin. i way from the disc, with the two
poles of the magnetic holder of equal length, will grind
the heel of a COMB about li times faster than the points.
A distance of IJln. grinds the heel of a COMB approxi-
mately 2i times faster than the points, and the heel of a
CUTTER about twice as fast. A distance of 21n. grinds
the heel of a COMB approximately 31 times faster than
the front, and the heel of a CUTTER twice as fast.
Some experts bring their pendulum rod as much as 41n.
away from the disc. While this grinds the heel away much
faster than the teeth, extreme care must be used lest it
grind away TOO fast and the life of the comb be shortened.
When grinding, look to the Magnetic Holder. The bottom
pole should be at least 1/64 In. longer than the top. The'
heel of the comb or cutter then strikes the disc first. When
comb or cutter is in full contact with disc, the pressure on
the magnetic holder applies to the heel only, the top pole
being entirely away from it. With such a magnetic holder,
it is not necessary to bring the pendulum rod and holder
aivay from the disc—-it can be set as close as possible.
When grinding is done and the pressure released, the front
of the teeth will instantly leave the disc, the heel only re
maining against it.
Eor best sharpening and longest life: (a) have bottom
pole of magnetic holder l/641n. longer than top pole; (b)
place centre of magnetic pendulum at same height as centra
of grinder spindle; (c) use a light pressure against disc.

wardly curving top tooth makes a useful guide.
Extends out of wool and enables you to watch
the cutting path. Helps you to avoid ridges,
second cuts. The most popular Comb ever

A Few Excerpts From
Hundreds of Shearer Letters
“I can shear at least three more sheep per
run with Cooper Combs than with any others.
“The Cooper E-B-7 Cutter covers the teeth
of any comb you like to use.
"1 never thought shearing was so easy till
1 started to use the Cooper No. 10.”
“1 have used Cooper Combs and Gutters
ever since 1 could hold a handpiece. They
are the sweetest cutters you can ever get hold
of.”
“I have shorn 1500 sheep with four Cooper
No. 10 Combs and they still look like new
combs.”
”1 have used all makes, but the Cooper
Triumph with a long bevel at the back of the
tooth is the only comb made.”
“1 have used all tools, but there are only
Cooper Combs and Cutters for me. They will
go into the hardest sheep arid they are very
easy to grind, besides holding their edge
longer than any other.”
“The Cooper Triumph lasts just as long
again as any other comb.”
“At my last shed my Cooper Cutters got
that thin the expert had a job to grind them.
1 used to go through a run with one to three
cutters, shearing 30 to 3 5 rough sheep each
run.”
“The No. 10 Cooper is a wonderful success.
It will go into anything.”
“1 was always a great believer in cut-
ters till 1 tried the Cooper E-B Cutter.”
Each of the above is taken from a bona-fide
letter received during 1936.


METHOD OF GRINDING
COMBS AND CUTTERS
PROPERLY
Do not press heavily when grinding Cooper Cut-
ters. The light pressure of one hand puts a fine,
sharp, LASTING edge on the Cooper Cutter.
COOPER CUTTERS LAST LONGER.
First see that the grinder discs are clean.
Use clean hot water and a brush. After wash,
ing, allow disc to dry off. Do not wipe it.
See that the clamp plate surface is clean.
In the centre of the sheet of grinding
material cut a hole for the stud of the clamp
plate. Lay the sheet face downwards on the
clamp plate. Apply an even coating of glue
to the disc. Then place the disc on top of the
sheet of grinding material. Replace washer and
nut and tighten down
Let each disc remain clamped down for some
hours before using. One way is to prepare
the discs at the end of the day, and leave them
clamped down overnight.
After removing the disc from the clamp
plate place it in the sun or other warm spot
to dry out. Place the disc on the grinder
spindle. Carefully trim overhanging material.
Use fine grit grinding cloth for cutters:
coarse grit for combs. Keep glue brush in
water when not in use.
Wash combs and cutters thoroughly before
grinding. See that the pendulum rod on the
grinder is quite straight. Adjust height of
upright, so the centre of the magnet on the
pendulum holder is in line with the centre of
the grinder spindle. Place the comb or cutter
on the pins of the pendulum with teeth point-
ing up. Neither pin should be tight in the
hole. Hang the pendulum rod on the hook


of the upright and take hold of the pendulum
with the thumb and forefinger of each hand,
pressing comb or cutter squarely against disc.
Only one hand is necessary with a Cooper Cutter.
The special alloy steel in Cooper takes on a cutting
edge easier, faster, and ensures more sharpenings
in the life of a Cooper Cutter.
Move the comb or cutter slowly back and
forth, with a pendulum motion. Do not take
it closer than I inch to the spindle nut, nor
within J inch of the edge of the disc. Keep
the pendulum moving, not allowing it to >-est
in one spot, maintaining a light, even pressure.
Grind from the heel towards the teeth, with
the sparks flying upwards. Do not keep a
comb or cutter on the disc for longer than 5
seconds at a time, and do not press heavily.
Otherwise overheating will result, and the steel
lose its temper. Where difficulty is experienced
in sharpening a comb or cutter it is better
to cool the comb or cutter in a can of water
before repeating the grinding ©Deration.
When about to draw the pendulum away
from the disc, bring it to the centre and hold
it there momentarily. Then draw it straight
back towards the body.
Examine the comb or cutter often. Keep
grinding until all worn spots have disappeared.
Such spots will be seen if the comb or cutter
is held face upwards towards the light, and
rocked to and fro in the hand. Watch the
edges of the teeth. Brightness along the edge
means bluntness. Continue grinding until this
disappears. When all signs of wear have been
ground out, press the comb or cutter firmly
straight on to the disc for one second, drawing
it straight back again.
Run the tip of a finger along the edges of
the teeth. A good cutting edge will be ap-
parent to the touch.
COOPER COMBS AND CUTTERS GRIND
EASIER AND LAST LONGER.

1 ake period of employment, say 4 weeks and
2 days, and deduct allowance for Trans-
port, Mess, etc., at £1 per week for 4-2/7
weeks . .. £4/5/8
I his gives Taxable earnings of £2B/4/4. Divide
by 5 weeks (fractions of week count as full
week) = £5/12/10 Weekly Earnings, on
which Weekly Tax (see table) is 3/8. Multi-
ply by 5 weeks = 18/4 Total Tax Payable.
SHED HANDS
Take total earnings for entire period at shed,
say, 4-1/3 weeks £l6/0/8

An Easy Way to Make Up
MESS ACCOUNT
Cook should keep a record of the date on
which each man joins the mess. Make up mess
book each week, and total up at end of shear-
ing.
EXAMPLE—
Deduct from this any amounts paid by men
who leave the mess before cut out. The rates
charged these men per week to be agreed on
by vote of majority of the mess. Assuming
this amounts to £4/10/-, it leaves a total of
£2l/3/- to be shared by the members of the
mess who remain until cut out.
This might be divided as follows. Say the
shed commences on the 6th May and cuts out
on the sth June.
Divide £2 1/3/- by 282 days 1/6 per day,
or 10/6 per week, per man.

Some Facts re PACE
The usual shearing speed in Australia is
3000 RPM. That is, the main spindle in the
handpiece should revolve 3000 times per
minute. To give this number of RPM in the
main spindle, the line shaft should turn at
650 RPM.
The speed of the engine is usually known.
To arrive at the correct size of pulley for the
line shaft, multiply the speed of the engine by
the size of the pulley on the engine. Divide
this by 650 to get the proper diameter of
pulley.
EXAMPLE: Engine speed 600. Pulley
Diameter I6in. 600 X '6 9600_1. 650 =
14-10/13. 15in. pulley required.
Grinding Speed
The recommended speed of the grinder
spindle is 2400 RPM. To arrive at this speed,
first see that the RPM of the line shaft is
correct. Then to get the right grinder pulley
size, divide the speed of the line shaft by the
size of the tight pulley on the grinder. Divide
the answer into 2400 and you have the size
of the pulley for the line shaft.
EXAMPLE: Speed of line shaft 650.
Diameter of tight pulley 4in. 650 jl. 4 =
162.5. 2400 -f. 162.5 14.8. 15in. pulley
required.

One Incident Out of Dozens
A young fellow stood on the railway platform
in a town in South Australia, waiting for the
outgoing train. In his coat lapel glittered a
small bright E-B Handpiece. Another man
approached him, saying: "I notice the badge
you wear —-are you a shearer?” “Yes,” an-
swered the young chap; “I just cut out at
Station.”
“Would you like another shearing job?”
asked the other. “Too rightl” was the reply.
“Come along, then,” said the other. Result:
another 4 weeks' shearing engagement for
young G , without even having to pay rail-
way fare out from his previous job.
IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE YOU’RE A
COOPER MAN.

helping to keep Australian workers em-
ployed.


Mr. Vincent Rainbird, who won the Cooper
Gun Title for 1936, says he owes it to the
Cooper One Long Tooth No. 2 Comb and
the E-B Cutter, Why not try that record-
breaking combination?


Many shearers say the Concave Comb the
way Cooper makes it is the only way to
make a comb.


TEMPER in Cooper Combs and Cutters is
PERFECT. No soft spots, like some makes;
not too hard to grind well, like others.


Shearers tell us "The middle teeth of the
new Cooper 9 and 10 (parallel sides) are
the best made.


Cooper Combs slide through the wool like
a half-worn comb. Mirror smoothness from
the start.


Cooper Cutters are the only ones really
suitable for fork tip drive. Only Cooper

cutters of to-day? From your experience,
can you suggest any improvement?


A short bottom tooth enters the wool faster.
The Cooper No. 4 Comb gives proof of that.


Wear an E-B buttonhole badge. Neat,
good-looking. Sent free to shearers.


Now you can get the famous Cooper One
Long Tooth Comb with BENT BOTTOM
TOOTH. Gives wider cut.


Experts say Cooper Cutters take less grind-
ing than any others. That means longer
cutting life.


Carry an E-B Centre Post in your waistcoat
pocket. Keep your shear set right.


The strong broad end teeth in the Cooper
Triumph enable the cutter to complete its
throw without slowing down in the end
tooth gullet.


You can earn more money without working
