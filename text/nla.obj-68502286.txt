From inquiry amongst the Bedouins and European residents in
Palestine it was ascertained that during the early summer the
level of the sea falls at least 6 feet below the level at which it
stood on the day the levelling was taken, which would make the
depression 1298 feet, and we may conclude that the maximum
depression at no time exceeds 1300 feet. Lieut. Symonds, E.E.,
in 1841, made the depression 1312*2 feet.
The soundings in the Dead Sea by Lieut. Vignes of the
French Navy, gave a maximum depth of 1148 feet; making
the depression of the bottom of the Dead Sea 2446 feet below the
level of the Mediterranean.
The soundings in the Mediterranean midway between Malta
and Candia by Captain Spratt, E.N., gave a depth of 13,020 feet,
or a depression of the bottom five times greater than that of the
bottom of the Dead Sea.
The levelling was executed by two independent observers, and
from a comparison of the two sets of levelling it is certain that
the levels have been obtained with absolute accuracy to within
3 or 4 inches.
The establishment of a chain of levels across the country with
Bench-marks cut on so many points cannot but prove of the utmost
importance for any future investigations or for any more extended
surveys in Palestine, such as are contemplated by the Society
which has been formed, since this survey was made, ?for the
accurate and systematic investigation of the archaeology, the topo-
graphy, the geology and physical geography, &c., of the Holy
Land for Biblical illustration.?
For the survey of Jerusalem itself it was of the utmost importance,
as it enabled us to connect all the levels in and about the city with
the level of the Mediterranean, and to harmonise, so to speak,
all the levels which have been taken.
XV. ? Journal of an Expedition from the Government Camp,
Camden Harbour, to the Southward of the Glenelg River in
North-Western Australia. By E. J. Sholl, Esq.*
[Communicated by the Colonial Office.]
Monday, April 10 th, 1865. ?Immediately after leaving the
camp we ascended a hill to the south-east, very stony and rocky,
yet, as usual, clothed with grass; and for about an hour we
* See Mr. Martin?s Journal of Explorations in the same region, ? Journal Royal
Geographical Society,? vol. xxxv. p. 237. No map embodying the recent surveys
of the district has yet been received by the Society, but the map in Grey and
Lushington?s ?Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-Western
Australia? may be consulted with reference to the present memoir.?[Ed,]


travelled over country of a similar description, yet with hills
gradually decreasing in height. The country was lightly timbered
with eucalyptus, cork, and cotton trees, all of small diameter. The
hills we passed over might, I conceive, be made passable for carts
w r ith very little labour. Everywhere we passed through grass, the
country presenting the appearance of a wheat-field, the grass
being generally above the horses? bellies, and occasionally even
above the heads of the riders. From the summit of the highest
hill we had a splendid view of Camden Harbour, with its islands
and headlands to our right and rear, with Mount King in the
distance to our right and front. The baobab described by Dr.
Martin is situated in flat country; and, indeed, after leaving
the hills in rear of our camp, we travelled over tolerably level
country, occasionally undulating with ironstone gravel, having
the appearance of being waterwashed in heavy floods. The
ground was in places very soft, and must be boggy during the
winter season. Ido not consider that we have had a winter, or
rather rainy season, this year. About a mile on our course from
the marked baobab we passed over several gullies, with quartz
scattered among the gravel. After leaving this country w r e as-
cended some tolerably elevated ground, from which we saw Mount
Lookover, Port George IV., and Augustus Water, in our rear;
and Mount King to the south-west. Mount Lyell lay to the
south-east of us, and was plainly seen. Passing over the level
country we saw several kangaroos. The land was still lightly
timbered with eucalyptus, what is here named the cork-tree, cotton-
tree, box-tree, and, where the ground was particularly soft, cab-
bage-palms.
Shortly before our midday halt we commenced crossing the
Hampton Downs, which, at this particular spot, was not so well
grassed as the country we had previously passed over, but it
gradually improved. We encamped at noon, amidst abundance
of feed, on the bank of a stream which I thought to be a branch or
tributary of the Gairdner River. We had previously passed over
a larger stream, with somewhat boggy approaches, and having on
its banks, where we crossed, a small thicket of palms, an euca-
lyptus, with large broad leaves, and other shrubs and trees more
vividly green and throwing more shade than is generally found in
Western Australia. These streams evidently took their rise in
the McDonald range, and ultimately joined the Gairdner. They
were shallow, but during the rainy season these, as well as many
dry stream-beds which we crossed, must contain a large body of
water. The stream upon which we camped was running to the
southward. We bivouacked under what is here called the currant-
tree, about 9 or 10 feet high, greyish striated bark, with twisted
branches. The leaf is bright-green, smooth on the upper surface,


5 inches long, and Ito inch broad. The fruit has a pleasant
acid taste?black when ripe. It is of the size of a very small
currant, and, like most Australian fruits, has more stone than
flesh. It grows in small bunches, the fruit being in different
stages of maturity, green, red, and black. The stone or seed is of
a flat, oval shape. The branches appear to be adapted for boat-
knees, being light and tough. Close by there was another tree,
altogether unlike what I have seen elsewhere. It was a tall,
rough-barked young tree. The branches do not spread, but take
an upward direction, and the leaves spring from the smaller
branches in fours. They were pointed, about inches long and
f inch broad in their widest part, or the centre ; they are of a
light-green colour. The tree was about 10 inches diameter at the
butt, or thickest part. There was also near us the everlasting
eucalyptus, with its smooth white stem and branches. The grass
at this place was principally kangaroo-grass. More birds were
seen on our way than we have met with at the camp. They were
principally pigeons, of a brown colour, but not bronze-winged.
Started at 3 o'clock, by which time the sun was less powerful.
Our party now consisted of eight, with four packhorses, and we
made a track, going in single file, which will last for some time.
We steered an east course through Hampton Downs?a well-
watered country : creeks, running in the direction of the Gairdner,
being crossed every half or three-quarters of an hour. The land
was undulating, composed of ironstone, sand, and clay alternately,
and occasionally?especially near some of the creeks?of alluvial
soil. Whatever the soil might be, there was no lack of grass.
In crossing some of the streams, the ground was soft?almost
boggy, and at the chosen fording-place of a branch of the Gairdner
Mr. Mcï¿½ae?s horse was so far bogged as to oblige' him to dis-
mount. To the southward of us there was a prominent hill, which
the settlers have named Mount Batten, and near it was the
elevated termination of a piece of high table-land, looking, until
we came closer to it, like a detached hill. They are conspicuous
landmarks. We halted for the night on the left bank of the
Gairdner, a small stream at this season, with boggy approaches
where we crossed it. The banks were fringed with palms. Our
halting-place was about 10 miles distant from the camp. During
the day I saw more grass than I have seen in any part of Western
Australia ; most of it kangaroo-grass, and some a reedlike grass, of
a coarse nature. Some of the grasses, especially those on swampy
land, were sedgy. The day was tolerably cool throughout.
April 11th. ?Started at 20 minutes to 6, and steered an
easterly course for about an hour, and then e. by s. until 9 o?clock,
when we again resumed our easterly route to obtain a pass through
the hills. All the country passed over was well grassed, and the


soil not so stony as that travelled over yesterday. On the banks
and in the immediate neighbourhood of the streams there was
rich alluvial soil. About an hour after leaving our halting-place
crossed a stream larger than that near which we camped last
night. We went over some very soft, boggy ground, and had to
pick our way carefully; but these places could be seen and, to a
great extent, avoided. Not so with the ? dry bogs,? as they are
termed. The ground is apparently firm?clay, with ironstone
gravel?but is completely undermined. The horses plunged con-
tinually up to their knees, and no amount of care or circumspection
could prevent this. The ? dry bogs ? were in patches over some
four or five miles of country in our course. We skirted Mount
Lyell, a two-peaked hill; the distance between either peak being
being about 1 mile. Halted on the banks of a stream at 10 o?clock,
Mount Lyell bearing S.S.E., and distant about 2 miles. We passed
through a perfect thicket of reed-grass, growing high above our
heads; but generally the pasture consisted of kangaroo-grass,
very thick and very high. The horses, when camped in the high
grass, generally wandered to feed off less luxuriant growth.
Before this country becomes available to its full extent for stock,
the long grass will have to be burnt or cut down ; it will never be
eaten down. It may be trampled down, and allow room for the
young grass to spring; but in its present state the feed has no
attraction?for horse-stock, at all events. The whole of the land
was lightly timbered with broad-leaved gum-trees, cotton, cork,
and box trees, all of slight girth. At 9 o?clock we rode up a hill
to look at the country. Mount Lyell was to the south of east,
and not far off. We had a good view all round, embracing the
valleys of the Glenelg and Prince Regent rivers. Our course was
through Mr. Mcï¿½ae?s run and the Hampton Downs, the greater
portion of which are included in this run. The Hampton Downs
are all they have been described?well watered and good feed.
The stream upon which we were encamped was running through
the Glenelg. Mr. Cowle stated our position to be lat. 15ï¿½ 57',
long. 124ï¿½ 59'. Left this place at 3 p.m., and passed through a
splendidly-grassed country. The land improved very much, there
being less stone and more alluvial. As we neared the Glenelg
the trees increased in girth, but they were still scattered. There
was no undergrowth of scrub, nothing but grass. We had some
difficulty in crossing the numerous watercourses, some of them
being very boggy. If we could have seen our way the impedi-
ment would not have been heeded, but the thick and high sward
of grass concealed everything. We camped for the night on a
stream a few miles from the Glenelg, upon a plain of ironstone
gravel and quartz, but with the usual abundance of feed. We
estimate' the distance travelled to be 15 miles. Both peaks of


Mount Lyell were bare, the reddish-brown rock alone being visible.
Grass appeared on the slopes, and at the base some light timber.
During the day we saw some native plum-trees ; the fruit, exactly
resembles a small plum, larger than a sloe. I was told that the
fruit was intensely bitter. I could only secure one plum, and,
content with the account given by others, did not taste it.
April 12 th. ?Had a sleepless night, the mosquitoes being on
the qui vive until daylight. We proceeded towards the Glenelg,
steering about due south, as indeed we had done from our halting-
place at noon yesterday. Crossed several streams flowing towards
the Glenelg, which were more difficult to pass than those farther
north, the grass being higher and thicker, and the stream-beds
more soft. Mr. Mcï¿½ae, however, was a first-rate pioneer, and,
after some trouble, we arrived on the banks of the Glenelg, at a
spot where it was divided into two branches ; both united lower
down, leaving a small island between the two. This we followed
for a about half a mile, when we came to some rapids; and at
this spot the stream we struck was united to the main branch.
The united streams were about 60 yards wide ; but in the rainy
season the river must be of considerable size, as there was
abundant evidence of the flow of a large body of water. The soil
on the bank is alluvial, in the bed of the river sandy and rocky.
We crossed at the rapids without wetting our feet?the water was
not, in fact, above the horses? knees ?and then proceeded south
for about half a mile, where I determined to form my permanent
depot on the banks of a stream running into the Glenelg, with
abundance of feed, plenty of firewood, sufficient shade, and, in fact,
all that we require for the purpose. Our small tent was placed
facing the south ?our destined course?where at the distance of
about a mile rise the Wheatley Hills. We arrived at this spot at
10 A.M. The country is generally gravelly, with occasional out-
croppings of rock, and here and there patches of alluvial soil.
There was no difference either in the character or quantity of the
grass, while the trees and shrubs were of the same description as
those we had passed before, except that at the Glenelg we again
met with the baobab, though not of so large a size as those near
our camp. On the banks of the river w'ere paper-bark trees, lofty
but of no great girth, the thickest not being more than 10 or
12 inches diameter. The foliage was similar in shape to that of
the eucalypti, and possessed the same aromatic flavour. There
were also some trees of moderate height, more umbrageous than
the generality of Australian trees. They had a rough blackish
bark, the leaves were dark and large, the trees bore a fruit not
in shape unlike a large white-heart strawberry, of a yellow-white
colour. The settlers called it the mulberry-tree, and say the fruit
when ripe is not unpleasant. What I tasted were acrid. Between


our depot-camp and the Glenelg we started a kangaroo, and on
the banks of the river saw a flock of black cockatoos, apparently
similar to those farther south. At our own depot the hawks, which
swarm to such an extent at Government Camp, began to collect.
There were a few sand-flies and mosquitoes, but not swarming, as
they did at our bivouac the night before. Cool day.
April 13^.?At a little before 7 a.m. Mr. Cowle and myself,
accompanied by Messrs. Mcï¿½ae, Hindhaugh, Hick, and the native
Billy, started on our first exploratory trip in the Ranges. We
followed up the gully on which we were encamped for about an
hour and a half, our course being easterly, with a little southing.
The country was generally rough and occasionally boggy. Crossed
the stream-bed more than once, the fords being boulders of slippery
rock, over which the waters dashed. At its source we finally left
the stream and vainly attempted to make south, but the hills, for
the most part precipitous sandstone elevations, barred our progress.
We dismounted and walked up one of the hills, leaving Billy in
charge of the horses. The hill was of sandstone, with trap or
basalt at the base. From the summit the country looked very
rugged, especially in our course ?south ?the hills being tumbled
together without any regard to arrangement, while the valleys
were as rock-strewn as the hills. On this hill was a solitary pine
?-we had previously seen a few. It was not large, being from
12 to 15 inches diameter, and of moderate height. Descending,
we tried our best to round the hills, but were baffled by the fearful
country. Following on every occasion every valley which trended
anywhere near our course, we were continually driven back by
insurmountable barriers of rock. The valleys, in fact, were for the
most part ravines, or ended in ravines; the hills coming down on
either side, and allowing but a few feet of level country, if it can
be called level where masses of rock of every conceivable size, shape,
and angle, are strewn over the narrow path. The poor horses
were tumbling, jumping, and sliding every minute, their legs
and feet bleeding from the sharp rocks. After all this labour,
towards midday we found ourselves not more than 5 miles from
depot, with no prospect of getting farther south in this direction.
Before our noon-halt we tried to make the Glenelg by starting
north and east, but failing, bivouacked in a small grass-flat
surrounded by rocks, with a streamlet flowing through the centre.
We passed along several of these flats during our morning
journey. They were generally well grassed, and the soil was red
loam, but they were all of very limited extent. Grass as usual
was abundant in the most stony portions, and I only saw spinifex
among the crevices of the otherwise bare blocks of sandstone.
Starting at a quarter to 2 p.m. we pursued a generally north route,
sometimes a little to the east or west, according to the course of


the ravines. We were now gradually descending, having during
the former part of the day been going, up-hill?sometimes imper-
ceptibly, at others 30 and 40 feet in the course of a hundred yards.
We passed through masses of sandstone, assuming fantastic shapes
and forms, requiring but little effort of the imagination to give
them ? a local habitation and a name.? One plot of rock-scattered
ground bore a marked resemblance to a ruined churchyard. The
broken headstone, the dilapidated monument, the shivered pillar
and fragments of sepulchral architecture?all were there, while
some of the blocks were sharp in outline, and perfect as if they had
just left the stone-cutter?s yard. At half-past 2, although we had
since our noontide halt been travelling downwards, we were still
on very high ground, with the River Glenelg some hundred feet
below us, the descent being a perpendicular wall of rock ; on the
opposite side were hills of equal height and of equal steepness.
Here there were rapids. The course of the river was north and
south, taking, shortly from the spot where we were stationed, a
turn to the eastward, and afterwards a south-east direction. As
there was no chance of descending to the river at this spot, we
followed a course a little to the eastward of north, and travelling
down a ravine, the most steep, the most rugged, and the most
lengthy of any we had hitherto travelled, and which punished the
horses very severely, we emerged upon the level country south
of the Glenelg 1 , and struck that river about a quarter of a mile
above the rapids which we crossed yesterday, and about two miles
below the spot where its course was from south to north. At
these rapids its direction was westerly. From the rapids we
proceeded to the depot-camp, which we reached at 5 o?clock. My
companions stated that the country was more rugged than any
they had previously passed over, and they had all more or less had
some experience of rough land ; one of them, indeed, had travelled
through the elevated Gipp?s Land territory. If our journey was
fatiguing it was not otherwise unpleasant. The day was fine and
cool; we had abundance of water ; the scenery was not only novel,
but extremely picturesque and often magnificent. A good bathe
in the depot creek soon restored energy and strength, and without
being damped by our non-success, we discussed the probable pro-
ceedings of the morrow. Seeing the impossibility of penetrating
the ranges in the direction we had pursued, we resolved to take a
south-westerly course as far as practicable.
April 14 th. ?A fine morning, but the flies, as usual, very
troublesome. We went round the west end of Wheatly Range,
travelling through more rugged country than even yesterday, but
there was not so much of it. We wandered about for some little
time, striving to penetrate through the hills, and struck the river,
pursuing a course a little to the northward of east. The Glenelg
YOL. XXXVI. P


was here running south. The cliffs came down to the water?s
edge on either side, and we had not gone far along the bank
before our way was stopped. We therefore pushed up the range,
following the ravines and valleys, and steering south wherever we
had a chance. The country was in every respect similar to that
which we traversed yesterday, except that the valleys were not so
well grassed, and there was more spinifex. After clearing the
hills we passed over some tolerably level table-land, sandy, and
thinly grassed, and at half-past 11 struck a large stream, which
we took at first for the Glenelg, but, as it was flowing north, it
was evidently a tributary. This stream I named, subject to the
Governor?s approval, the Mcï¿½ae, after one of my companions, a
gentleman who had been of signal service to us throughout the
expedition. The river, where we struck it, was yards wide
from bank to bank, but the actual stream of water did not exceed
20 yards, or, at the furthest, 25 yards. On a ledge of rock
overhanging the river, we bivouacked; the horses looking at, but
not touching, the spinifex. A spring of water hurst from the rock,
and formed a small stream, from whence we got a supply for
ourselves and horses. On either side the rocks lined the river,
but the hills were of no very great height. Among the plants in
the neighbourhood I noticed the hollyhock?very similar to our
own in leaf and flower; and the honeysuckle, red and white
flowers, but scentless. The trees here, and in fact throughout
the ranges where we have been, are eucalypti, casuarina, acacia,
cotton, cork, box, and palms. Also some trees bearing a fruit
resembling in appearance, when ripe, a russet apple, and, when
unripe, a smooth green apple. It was intensely bitter, and
contained a large stone ?in fact, it was nearly all stone. There
were some splendid lilies in the river, which emitted a perfume like
the violet. They were of different colours?white, pink, and blue
?the two latter light tints, as if the original white had been
stained with colour. The river must rise in the ranges which we
see to the southward, and will most probably furnish a pass
through them. We could not, however, proceed in that direction
to-day, in consequence of Mr. Cowle?s horse having cut his leg
too severely to travel. In fact, all our horses were more or less
maimed. We started a kangaroo, but with so large a party it is
next to impossible to get near enough to have a shot. On our
return route we took a north-easterly course, following down a
brook which we crossed on our outward trip, and which was
descended by our horses with very great difficulty, owing to the
steepness and rocky nature of its bed. Before arriving at this
brook we crossed the sandy table-land of our outward track, above
a mile to the southward and eastward, and found it thinly clothed
with grass. We passed the Wheatly Range (by following the


before-named brook) to the westward of a detached hill on the
eastern point of the mountains. We left the Mcllae at 2 o?clock,
and arrived at depot camp at half-past 3. All the flat lands
over which we have passed ?and they are not many, and limited
in extent?possess a soil of either sand or ironstone gravel,
sometimes of both. The great peculiarity here, as well as in the
land to the north of the Glenelg, is the total absence of under-
growth bushes ; between the widely separated thin and short trees
there is nothing but grass and creepers. Let it be thin or thick,
good or bad, tall or short, still it is grass. The trees were gene-
rally of small girth; the largest we have yet seen did not exceed
15 inches diameter, and trees of this size were very rare. The
baobab-trees of course are exceptions, for they, on the other hand,
are of enormous circumference; but after leaving the tree named
in my first day?s journal, we did not see another until we came to
the Glenelg, and then we met with a few. There is one or two
near our depot camp. They are an unfailing sign of water ?not
necessarily surface water, but of water at a short distance from the
surface. They are more plentiful near the government camp than
I have seen elsewhere. Looking through the opening at the back
of my tent, I see two as I am now writing, of noble girth, but not
so large as others. Between the camp and the well, and along
the now dry bed of the watercourse which supplied us when we
first landed, and until lately, there were several, and this makes
me the more confident that there will be no great difficulty in
obtaining water at the driest season. The palms are generally
indicative of surface water, and grow in soft swampy land, and
upon the margins of rivers and streams. In travelling along,
whenever we saw palms in dur course, we prepared to flounder
through soft or boggy ground, and in nine cases out of ten the
ground was either the one or the other. The sandstones in the
ranges have every variety of size, form, and colour. From blocks
weighing hundreds of tons to pieces weighing a few grains; in
shape, columnar, tabular, pyramidal, in pavement blocks, like
gigantic walls, with every line separating each block, as level and
as closely cut as if placed there by human agency, like ruined
castles, with towers and battlements ?half defined and half
defaced, massive boulders, and pebbles of the size of marbles;
lying in every attitude, presenting angles in every possible position,
they seemed like the remains of cities, built by giants, and scattered
abroad in some great convulsion of nature. The hues of the rock
are varied to a degree ?dark brown, light brown, yellowish brown,
yellow, white, red of different shades; sometimes several colours
in the same rock. Again, while many rocks are clothed with
grass, others are quite bare. We have thus anything but monotony
among the ranges. ? Owing to the cause before stated, we could
p 2


not make a good day?s work, and our extreme distance south was
not more than three miles, but the horses were nevertheless much
bruised, and cut about the legs, and seemed to have had enough
of it; so I determined to halt to-morrow (Saturday), and, as a
matter of course, on the succeeding day, and then make a three
days? trip, as there appears at last to be a chance of making some
southing. We had a tolerably cool day, and in fact when we got
among the hills the change of temperature for the better was
invariably marked. Upon examining the map, it would appear
either that we are not on the rapids named by Grey (at the spot
where the river bends to the southward), or that the Wheatly
Range, or the river itself, is incorrectly laid down. Our depot
camp is about three-quarters of a mile south-west of the rapids,
and the range faces us about half a mile, or from that to a mile
distant, its position being east and west. To the eastward, half a
mile?s travelling brings us to the eastern end of the small detached
hill round which we passed on our return trip this morning, and
by going a mile to the westward, we came round the western
point of the range. From a mile and three-quarters to two miles
is the extent of the range facing us to the south, neither end of
which, east or west, is distant more than a mile from the River
Glenelg, According to the map, our present position is two miles
to the eastward of the range, or in fact on the opposite bank of the
Glenelg. We are on a peninsula, hemmed in by the river on
every side, except south, with a point or two east or west of south ;
and such a peninsula! except the flat upon which we are encamped,
which extends back to the rapids, and up and down the river for
a limited extent, the country is one mass of sandstones, of more
or less elevation. Mr. Cowle informed me that he was not yet
perfectly satisfied of our exact position, but he was inclined to
believe that we were not on the rapids described by Grey, We
saw no marked trees, nor any other sign of Grey?s party.
April Ibth, ?To-day was the hottest we have experienced since
leaving Camden Harbour, the weather having been generally cool
?much cooler than I have experienced it at Government Camp,
We have also had some heavy dews at night?a very rare occur-
rence at camp. The festering sores which afflicted so many in
camp are also fast disappearing. Saw to-day a beautiful water-
lily growing in a different part of the creek upon which we are
encamped. It was sweet scented; the flower was large, white-
edged, with a fringe of light blue ; and under the surface was
blue, of a darker tint.
April l^th. ?Remained in depot all day. Hawks swarming
about the place in hundreds. Not a thing could be left for an
instant but it was pounced upon, and, if at all eatable, carried
away. Wherever we go, one or two accompany us; and no


sooner are fires lit, and preparations made for meals, than they
come from all quarters. They are brown birds, about the size of
a small fowl. They are fearless, and stand to be shot at, not
moving, though the revolver-bullets strike the branch upon which
they are perched within an inch of their bodies. Bathed in a pool
of water a few hundred yards down our creek?a pleasant place,
surrounded by palms, the only approach to tropical vegetation
which I have seen.
April VJth. ?We all had a tolerable night?s rest, and started at
20 minutes to 7 a.m. on our journey. The party consisted, besides
myself, of Mr. Cowle, who is somewhat better this moraine 1 , Mr.
Mcï¿½ae, Mr. Hick, and Billy. We took three days? provisions.
The day was fine, but calm. Found a much better pass to the
eastward of the Wheatly Range than the one we travelled on
Friday, on our return route, by following up a creek. At half-
past 8 arrived at a spot a quarter of a mile north of our bivouac
on Friday, travelling over comparatively easy country, tolerably
well grassed. From this place we attempted to get south by
following creeks, but did not make more than half a mile in a
direct line by 10 o?clock, when we were brought up by a creek,
with rocks to the water?s edge on either side, and a barrier of
rocks in the centre, over and among which the water tumbled very
prettily, A fringe of palms skirting the stream added to its
picturesque appearance. Mr. Hick shot two white cockatoos,
somewhat different from those I had seen at Camden Harbour.
The topknot was white, and the feathers under the wings light
yellow'. At Camden Harbour the topknot is sulphur-coloured.
Got, near our halting-place, some berries, not unlike, in appearance,
black currants. They grew 'on a tree, not dissimilar in height
and appearance to the one described as being at our noontide
halting-place on the 10th instant. The fruit, however, was dif-
ferent, larger, and growing on stalks?not in bunches; the leaves
were light-green, smooth, 4 inches long, and 11 inch broad.
They call it the elder-tree, but there is not much similitude.
Around the camp I marked some smooth-barked white gum-trees,
larger than any we have before seen?about 18 inches in diameter.
Walked out with Messrs. Cowle and Mcï¿½ae to have a look at
the country to the southward and westward. We went about a
mile, and found, with the exception of some rocks near the camp,
that the course, for this country, was fair travelling. Mr. Mcï¿½ae
and myself climbed up two hills, Mr. Cowle being too unwell to
make the attempt. We found the appearance of the country to
the southward promising, but due south the ranges seemed to bar
our progress. The Wheatly Range was beneath us to the north,
and we could see over it the hills on the other side of the Glenelg.
On one of the hills which we ascended there was a cave, in which


were the remains of a native fire?apparently one native. It was
recent ?that is to say, about ten days or a fortnight old?the ashes
not having been either much disturbed by the wind or intermixed
with dust and droppings from the roof the cave. We saw the
McDonald ranges in the distance, and also Mount Lyell, far
away from and beneath us. We estimated our height above the
sea-level at, 1800 feet. On our return picked up a piece of stone
which the natives had been sharpening for their spears and knives,
&c. It is something like obsidian, but not so highly glazed. The
hills which we climbed were sandstone, with trap or basalt at the
bases and in the valleys. The trap-rock was intersected by veins
of quartz, and there was a peculiar outcropping of that stone in
small spiculse and large crystals. The ground at the base of the
hills was strewn with the debris of quartz, some of it as fine as
sand.
April ISth. ?Left camp at half-past 7. Crossed numerous
creeks and streams; this country is beautifully watered, and,
steering s.W., at half-past 8 struck the Mcï¿½ae. At this spot it
consisted of large reaches, bordered by palms and lofty paper-
bark trees. The reaches were connected by narrow channels formed
by the hills descending on either side. r i hese channels were rock-
strewn, and the water passed over between the rocks, either in the
form of cascades or rapids, according to the height. We crossed
the Mcï¿½ae at one of the rapids, and followed it up, the stream
running about n.n.e., we of course steering in an opposite direction.
The travelling became very difficult; the hills were often perpen-
dicular, like walls of masonry, for in many places even the joints
are distinctly marked, always precipitous. Our course was at the
base; and when the ledge of rocks over which we travelled sloped
off to the water s edge, we had to cross the stream the best way
we could, and make our way along the opposite side until similar
impediments compelled us again to ford the river, which we crossed
and recrossed five times. Some of these fords were difficult, owing
to the masses of rock of all shapes, over whose slippery points and
surfaces the horses stumbled, and sometimes fell, but happily no
accident happened to horse or rider. At one place we were
blocked in on both sides, and had nothing for it but ascending
the bank. We at the time on the right side of the Mcï¿½ae,
and luckily the hill was not so steep as its neighbours. It was,
however, quite steep enough?something like Mount Eliza, at the
back of my former residence, but not so high. We dismounted
and led our horses, not going straight up the ascent, but twisting
and turning among the large stones, and thus saving the animals
an additional pull. Halting on the summit of the hill to breathe
ourselves and horses for 10 minutes or so, we pursued our journey.
By the river?s side I noticed a peculiar-looking tree, the only one


of the sort that I observed during our journey. It was larger
than its companions, and looked more like an English forest-tree
than any I -have seen in Australia. It was richly clothed with
dark foliage, threw out long and spreading branches, and was a
complete shade-giver. The leaves somewhat resemble the myrtle.
The soil of the country over which we passed was sandy near the
river, in patches between the rocks, and reddish brown upon the
hills ; but rocks and stones were everywhere, and grass of course.
We have never been without grass?much of it coarse and rank,
but most of it sweet and good. Saw some yellow-crested cockatoos
near the hill which we had just climbed. The descent on the
other side was not so abrupt, and we had no occasion to dismount.
Passing over some level bare rocks, with here and there ledges
from half a foot to a foot high, we were again brought to a halt
at some rapids, which appeared difficult to cross, while our progress
was barred by a wall of rocks, with no convenient shelf wide
enough for our horses. In some still water a short distance from
the rapids there were beautiful water-lilies white, with edges
fringed with filaments like feathers or down. The flower was
five-petaled, small, and inodorous. With some splashing and
slipping, we crossed the rapids, and, ascending a stony hill of
moderate height, came along some tolerably level country for about
a quarter of a mile. Here I observed for the first time, though it
afterwards* appeared that it was?if not plentiful?pretty generally
dispersed, a fruit-bearing plant, about feet high. There are
two stems springing distinct from each other, the shorter one about
one foot long, bearing a leaf which resembles somewhat the potato-
plant ; the longer one, 2 feet, bears the fruit in three pendulous
seed-vessels, in shape like the English gooseberry, and enclosing
a large number of striated seeds, enclosed in a sweetish pulp, the
flavour being more grateful than most of the so-termed edible
fruits of the country. The colour of the ripe seed-vessel is a rich
sugar-brown. It exudes saccharine matter, and is sticky and
clammy. I picked a specimen, root, stalks, leaves, and fruit; and
also collected some fruit, which became crushed, and afterwards
fermented in my havresack, but I managed to save the seed.
When I arrived home, my son produced some specimens he had col-
lected in the immediate neighbourhood of the camp; so it was no
novelty, after all. Almost immediately after passing these plants,
we came to a patch of baobab-trees, the first I had seen since
leaving the Glenelg. Still following the course of the Glenelg?
we were now on the left bank?we crossed again at some rapids,
and, ascending a bank of moderate elevation and steepness, pro-
ceeded along some richly-grassed table-land?clayey soil, with
stones intermixed?until gradually nearing the water?s edge, the
accustomed rocky bar compelled us once more to cross the river.


Travelled over some bare rocky ground, full of ledges and fissures,
and, coming to a grassy flat, we camped at noon in its midst,
among a clump of short trees, sufficiently close together to throw
a grateful shade. Our halting-ground was about 80 yards from
the Mcï¿½ae, distant from our sleeping-camp 7 miles, and from the
depot (due south) 9 miles. Our course has been rather to the
westward of south. While at dinner a hawk, more bold than his
companions?and none of them are too modest?pounced down
among the trees, and was easily caught by one of the party, and,
after due examination, let go. Messrs. Mcï¿½ae and Hicks ascended
a hill to the westward of our camp, and reported that the country
looked clear in the direction of our course, but said there was a
range running north and south to the eastward. We left camp
at 3 P.M., and following up the river shortly afterwards, passed
through a very small patch of thicket, with climbing-plants cross-
ing from tree to tree, obliging us to cut our way. The soil was
alluvial, and very soft. Here I saw ferns for the first time?a
delicate feathery-leaved plant. After emerging from this thicket,
we travelled over undulating country, gradually ascending in our
course, which was now due south. The flat through which we now
passed was bounded east and west by hills rising like walls, with
occasional valleys between, of apparently similar flat land. The
distance between the hills on either side was at first but a few
yards, but this gradually extended, and the average width of the
plain during the 6 miles we went over it was almost, if not quite,
half a mile. It was splendidly grassed, and the herbage was
thinner and less rank than on the north side of the Glenelg, and
more fitted for the immediate use of stock. The soil was generally
gravelly, sometimes sandy, and occasionally rich loam. Judging
by the habits and tastes of our horses, I should prefer taking up
land of this description for stock to the more densely-grassed
country contained in Mr. Mcï¿½ae?s run ; but this was comparatively
a small patch, although the valleys running at right angles on
either side, as well as many of the hills, seemed equally well grassed.
The Mcï¿½ae had now dwindled into a creek, no longer broken into
wide reaches ; and after following it along the valleys, it branched
off, one stream coming from the westward and the other from the
southward. The latter we considered the main stream, and, as
it was in our course, continued to follow it up through rocky
country. After travelling about 3 miles among our old friends
the sandstones, we camped for the night in a narrow valley, through
which the Mcï¿½ae, a small but still running stream, flowed, and
which was fairly grassed. The hills on either side are not high,
and the horses relished the grass, which was short and sweet.
Noticed the banksia-tree on the banks of the Mcï¿½ae, not having
seen it north of the Glenelg. It is short and scrubby, and seems


out of its latitude. It is apparently peculiar to the Mcï¿½ae.
Several kangaroos were started during our day?s march. Mr.
Cowle informed me that we were 2500 feet above the sea-level.
I should not have thought so; but as we have been ascending,
generally gradually, and sometimes abruptly, since we left the
Glenelg, I suppose it must be so. We had now come about
19 miles south of our depot-camp; and as there is nothing to
prevent the movement of pack-horses, while there is some prospect
of our proceeding still further south, I determined to shift the
depot-camp, in furtherance of my slow and sure plan of feeling
the way in front, and being able to calculate as nearly as possible
how long it would take to remove the party back on our tracks
through a country which offered no serious impediment, now that
we had discovered passes through the hills, to tired and jaded
horses. Mr. Cowle places our present camp in about latitude
April 19 th. ?Up at 10 minutes past 5, after a cool and re-
freshing night, and started at a quarter past 7. We passed
yesterday?s shady bivouac at 9. Noticed in the country we passed
over some scrubby stunted cypress, which also grew in the neigh-
bourhood of Camden Harbour. It is not however plentiful, nor is
it useful for any purpose, being a mere bush. The box-tree and
the cotton-tree very plentiful here and throughout our line of
route, the former a very hard and the latter a very soft wood.
Got to the flat, where we slept, on Monday at 20 minutes past 12.
Left at 3 p.m. and got back to the depot at a quarter past 5,
travelling back on our tracks with good speed. Resolved to rest
our horses until Friday, and then move on.
April ?list. ?Did not start' until 8 o?clock. Proceeded to our
sleeping-camp of Monday and had to halt, my horse having twisted
off its off hind-shoe in the ranges. Noticed more particularly at
this spot the native apple-trees. They were loaded with fruit,
about the size of a small apple, and which I have formerly described.
The tree is about 30 feet high, the stem 6 inches diameter; bark
dark brown, lying in flakes; leaves in pairs, eight pairs being on
one stalk, of a light-green colour, narrow and pointed at the end,
about inches long and 1 inch wide in the broadest part; the
stalk upon which the leaves are placed 15 inches long. The shrub
called the sand-paper plant is also here, as well as at Camden
Harbour. The leaves are dark green, with a rough upper surface,
like fine sand-paper ; they are dry and crisp, but not brittle or
easily broken. The leaves grow in pairs, upon a stem rising from
the ground about 4 feet high. They are 3ï¿½ inches long and
2 inches wide, and nearly oval. There were trees in our neighbour-
hood, the stem clothed with brown stringy bark, the branches
white and smooth, Hke the ordinary white gum of the country,


and the leaves weFe also precisely similar. It presented a very
strange appearance, but my companions recognised it as the ? Gum-
top Stringy-bark ?of Victoria. A graceful-looking tree close by
attracted my attention. It was 40 feet high, the stem 4 inches
in diameter, leaves dark yellowish green, 6 inches long,
inches wide, thick, and rounded at the apex. Started from this
camp at a quarter past 2, and at 5 o?clock halted on the right
bank of the Mcï¿½ae, in splendid feed of kangaroo-grass up to the
horses? bellies. We were on a small flat containing about 100 acres
of this feed, which grew on clayey soil, and our camp is fixed in a
clump of young trees about 60 or 70 yards from the river?s bank.
The river flows from south to north, and here forms the arc of
a bow, which encloses our flat. On the opposite or west side
of the stream the sandstone-hills rise to a great height, sinking
lower towards the south.
April 22nd. ?At 9 o?clock this morning we arrived at our
destination, the junction of the two creeks. Resolved to halt here
until noonday, and then push on a flying party to the southward.
We are on a rocky piece of ground, with the Mcï¿½ae, now a mere
brook, running close by. About our camp lizards of every size
and colour sport among the rocks.
April 23rd. ?There was a cool breeze from the southward this
morning, but the sun?s rays were very powerful. We have lost
mosquitoes, sandflies, and other flies, but the ticks are very
troublesome, crawling about in every direction, and much annoying
the horses. Six or seven are cut out of our nags at one time.
The hawks still accompany us, and one was caught by hand. When
laid down he stretched his legs, shut his eyes, and was to all
appearance?what he intended us to believe?dead. Upon moving
a step or two back, he raised his head, and seeing that simulating
death would not do, commenced pecking at the finger of his captor,
who had approached again towards him. When he saw that there
was no one nearer to him than a few yards, he leisurely flew a short
distance off. Bathed in a narrow reach of the Mcï¿½ae, but without
much comfort, the bottom being composed of sharp-pointed rocks,
the water hot, and leeches in great numbers. Leeches were not
met with in the Glenelg, nor do we hear of their having been seen
in the neighbourhood of Camden Harbour. They seem to be
peculiar to the Mcï¿½ae, as far as my experience goes. Mr. Cowle
makes the latitude of our camp 15ï¿½ 59' 8".
April 24 th. ?Started at a quarter past 7 upon our exploring
trip. We took with us three days? provisions, intending, unless
compelled to return in consequence of losing shoes, to be away
from camp for that period. Arrived at our halting-place of
Tuesday last at 8 a.m., and continuing to ascend the valley for
about half a mile farther on, we reached the summit of the range


up which we had been travelling since we left the Glenelg. Here
we dismounted, and leaving the horses in Billy?s charge, climbed
up the highest hill, which had an elevation of about 100 feet above
the valley, and may be considered the highest point of this part of
the range. The view was extensive, and the following bearings
were taken by Mr. Cowle and entered in my note-book at the
time:?A hill w. by n., distant about 9 miles, apparently sandy,
was supposed at the time to be the Red Cone Hill, near Doubtful
Bay, but this cannot be, as, upon reference to the map, that hill
appears to the southward of our position. The one we saw is
a remarkable hill, and easy of identification ; Mount Lyell n. by
w. ï¿½ w.,* about 20 miles; Mount Double Cone n.w. by N., 25
miles; a table hill n. f E., about 35 miles. This we conjectured
to be Mount Waterloo. In our course there were three distinct
ranges of hills, all of which seemed to be much lower than the
one we were on. Their course averaged east and west. The
nearest and smallest range was distant about 5 miles; the second,
somewhat higher, about 10 miles; and the third, the highest,
which looked blue in the distance, not less than 25 miles. The
country between us and the nearest range appeared practicable.
Mr. Cowle considered that we were now 3000 feet above the level
of the sea. As this is the highest point of the range in this direc-
tion, and the spot is prominent, I give it a name, and propose, with
the Governor?s consent, to call the hill Mount Cowle. Descending
the hill, we remounted our horses and proceeded over the crest
of the range. Immediately after leaving the source of the Mcï¿½ae
on one side, flowing north, we struck the head of another creek on
the southern side, and flowing south. This we followed over very
rugged country (the country, by the by, which looked practicable
from the hill-top) for about 2 miles, when we were stopped by
a complete block of rocks before and on either side of us. We
had for some time been driven into the stream, there being no
passage on either side, and had made our way with difficulty
among large boulders of rock. The stream had increased rapidly
in width, depth, and volume, and though so near its source, was
larger than the Mcï¿½ae, at our second depot. Mr. Hindhaugh
went ahead a short distance on foot to see whether there was any
chance of our getting along by another route, and on his return
reported that the country was impassable for horses. He had gone
down the rivulet for about a quarter of a mile, when it was joined
by a larger stream, and the united waters flowed towards the west-
ward. It would most probably be joined by numerous creeks from
this and the next parallel range, and by the time it reached the sea
* [According to the tracing subsequently furnished by Mr. Cowle, Mount Lyell
is placed a point or two to the eastward of north from Mount Cowle. ?R. J. S.j


coast have become a river of some magnitude. I think it not
improbable that, in the valley between either of the ranges which
we saw from Mount Cowle, a stream of more or less magnitude
flows towards the sea. We retraced our steps, leading our horses
over the worst portions of the ravine in which we were confined,
and encamped higher up the creek at 10 minutes to 12. The
latitude, by observation, of our camping-ground, was 16ï¿½ 2' and
some odd seconds, our farthest south being as nearly as possible
16ï¿½ 3'. Mr, Cowle made the longitude of our halting-place
124ï¿½ 55' e. It was a pretty spot, overhung by sandstone cliffs,
between which the stream rushed over the rocks. On a ledge of
rock some 10 or 12 feet above the water we boiled the water for
tea, the horses feeding higher up the valley, where there was
a diminutive flat. Between the fissures of the rocks a sufficient
number of trees flourished to throw a grateful shade, some of which
I had not noticed before. There was one light grey-barked tree,
with dark-green leaves, pointed, 3J inches long by 2 broad, with
a fruit somewhat resembling the seed-vessels of the rose, which,
when ripe, were of a dark-red colour. They were sweet to the
taste, and grew upon a short stalk in clusters of 6or 8. Mr.
Hindhaugh brought in a sample of a narrow-leaved palm, the
leaves diminishing in breadth from half an inch to the thickness of
a thread ; they were fine and tough, and seemed well adapted for
the manufacture of hats, and when prepared, of cordage. I did
not see the palm itself, nor were any more seen by Mr. Hindhaugh,
except a few in the locality where he procured this specimen,
I blazed some saplings at this place, from which exuded a large
quantity of white viscid fluid, which turned dark on exposure to
the light, looking not unlike india-rubber. One of the trees was
marked by Mr. Hindhaugh J. H., his initials, and these marks may
serve to identify the spot at some future time. The lizards were
very plentiful on the rocks, and they seemed to be of the same
colour as the particular mass of rock on which they sported?the
various shades of brown and yellow. They were most expert fly-
catchers, Resumed our retrograde march at 3 o?clock, it being
my determination to return to depot, there appearing to be no
opening in this direction, and follow the branch of the Mcï¿½ae,
which came from the westward, hoping to find an outlet to the
southward. We had not gone more than a mile when Mr. Cowle?s
horse lost a shoe, and we halted while Mr, Hindhaugh shod the
animal. Our last nail was thus consumed, and, recollecting
the nature of the country we had to pass on our way home, and
knowing how utterly useless a shoeless horse must be in these
ranges, I determined to return back without delay. Before
travelling in this country, not only should the horses be well shod,
but each rider should be supplied with a few spare shoes and


plenty of nails. The shoes themselves are seldom lost. We
arrived at the depot-camp by sundown,- when I gave the order for
commencing our homeward march the next morning. Mr. Mcï¿½ae
returned from a pedestrian trip shortly after my arrival. He had
been with Graham up the western branch of the river, and after
getting over some rough-and-tumble country, which however
could be traversed by horses, they gained the summit of some
table-land, which was, for this place, fair travelling, and extended
in the direction we intended to have gone. He considered the
opening at the spot where he turned back, about 4 miles from
camp, of a promising nature. During our trip to-day there was
less grass than usual, spinifex being the rule.
April Toth.? Returned on our tracks. Tried occasionally to
get a better crossing-place over the Mcï¿½ae, but were not successful.
These crossings caused some little excitement, and the leading
horsemen generally waited on the opposite side to see the whole
party safely over. The scene thus viewed was not devoid of
interest. Masses of rocky hill, rising perpendicularly several
hundred feet above the water?s edge, with just sufficient ledge at
the base to permit the party in single file to travel along; the
river tumbling over immense stones at the ford; the hills, with
their accommodating ledge, on the other side. We (Mr. Mcï¿½ae
and myself) just got across the third ford, and going a little down
the right bank of the river, turn, and after a few minutes? halt,
push through a thicket, which, although we have broken through
it three times before, seems as impervious as ever. It is formed of
stiff thorny trees, or rather shrubs, which spring up from among
the stones; no vestige of earth to be seen. They are sufficiently
high to meet overhead. What with guiding the horses over the
stones, and defending head, body, and limbs from the thickets, all
are well employed. But this is not all. Showers of green ants
descend upon our heads and shoulders, and it must have been
amusing to a looker-on to see persons at the same time hastily
engaged protecting themselves from ants, thickets, and the rocks
at'their feet. Happily the thicket is a small one, and we emerge
hot enough, but with leisure, to destroy the insects which have
been persecuting us. The green-ant is about half an inch long, of
a light arsenic green, and dwells amidst the foliage of trees, r l heir
bite is very sharp, but beyond the pain at the time, no great in-
convenience is suffered. A small black ant, with a red head,
is a more troublesome insect For some time after being bitten
there is much pain, and the part swells. Their bite, in its effect, is
similar to that of the serjeant-ant. Luckily they are not so plentiful
as the green ant, nor do they reside in trees, otherwise passing among
their habitations would be a task unpleasant, to say the least. We
halted early at the camping-place of Monday week, and where


Mr. Mcï¿½ae had marked the white-gum-trees. Here we remained
for the rest of the day. Two miles south of our present halting-
place we came down a very steep hill, to avoid that which we had
hitherto ascended and descended, and which I described in a former
part of my Journal. We did not gain by the change ;it was
quite as steep as the hill we avoided, but somewhat shorter.
Discovered among the rocks of our camping-place a creeping
plant, with leaves and tendrils like those of the cucumber, only
much smaller. The fruit was the size of a small cherry, quite
round, of a bright scarlet colour. The taste is like that of the
cucumber. This is the most uninteresting, as regards situation
and aspect, of our halting-camps among the ranges, and yet there
is a greater variety of trees and vegetable productions than in
any other. Each time that we have visited it I have found some-
thing new. I collect, as well as I can, specimens of fruits and
seeds, but from not having proper receptacles, many of them get
mixed, crushed, and broken. I also collect ripe seeds of every
plant near our camps, although I do not know the nature or the
character of the blossoms?many of them are creepers. This has
been an extremely hot day. Mr. Mcï¿½ae told me that he had seen,
though not in this part of the North district, a guana having a
hood, which, when the creature is in repose, lies flat on its shoulders
and back, but, when it moves, is spread open, and when it jumps
from tree to tree, appears to act like a wing. It is of moderate
size?the guana, not the hood. Since my return my son informs
me that he has seen one of these animals. We saw very few
guanas during our journey, and I have not met with a snake in all
my rambles on foot and on horseback; but two have been seen by
our party during this journey?a small and a large one?and
three were killed at the Government Camp in our absence?
one of them upwards of 10 feet long. They cannot be considered
plentiful in this part of Australia. We have seen numbers of
butterflies of endless variety and hue. An entomologist might
spend some months very pleasantly and profitably here. In fact
there is a new field opened for students of Natural History in
every branch.
April 26th. ?Did not start until half-past 7. Arrived at depot
No. 1 at 10 minutes past 10, and crossed the rapids at the
Glenelg at 10 minutes to 11. Here we halted. Mr. Cowle
states our latitude to be 15ï¿½ 44' 28". He is convinced that these
are not the rapids of Grey, which are 2 miles further up the river.
I did intend strolling off to visit the lower rapids, but some of the
horses had swollen backs, and I thought it advisable to defer this
visit to a future time, and bring the animals home before they
got worse. By shifting saddles, padding, &c., we have hitherto
managed to save the horses, who have only suffered in the feet


and legs. In condition they are not worse?some of them I think
are better?than when they left Camden Harbour. Noticed a
herb with a grass-like stem, with seeds like those of wheat, but
reversed, lying upon the stem like the barbs of a spear. We
started at a quarter to 3, and after crossing the divided stream of
the Glenelg?we had been encamped on the island between the
two streams ?struck a direct course, instead of following back
our tracks by the bank of the Glenelg. The numerous streams
which impeded our progress before therefore passed to the
eastward or higher up, and this, together with the drying up of
the water, enabled us to push along with greater ease and rapidity.
We passed over lightly-timbered and well-grassed country, tolerably
level, with clayey, sandy, and gravelly soil, sometimes one and
sometimes the others, but the same description of herbage and
timber on each. In crossing the stream upon which we camped
on the 16th instant, ?and which we called Mosquito Creek?but
higher up, my horse got jammed between the banks, and we had
some difficulty in extricating him, the bottom being soft, the
banks steep, and the stream-bed narrow. Shortly after leaving
this place, we came upon our outward track, which was very plain,
and which we followed. Most of the streams which had contained
water when we passed a fortnight since were now dry, and we had
to push on until dusk, when we were fortunate enough to arrive at
the creek known to us as Frying-pan Creek. There was plenty
of water here. We camped on the south bank, and soon found
we were in a mosquito neighbourhood. There was plenty of grass,
but the ground was so stony, that it was a difficult matter to pick
out sleeping ground. However it was not of much consequence,
as the mosquitoes would not let us rest. Mount Lyell bears
north-west, about half a mile distant. This two-peaked hill is
connected at the bottom by rising ground. There is no apparent
difference in the height of the two peaks, looking from our camp
at daylight. Both peaks were composed of bare red rock?either
basalt or trap. After leaving the Glenelg, and not far from its
banks, the ground was covered with lake-coloured everlastings;
further south the everlastings are dark crimson, and near Camden
Harbour pink and white.
April 21th. ?We were all up before daylight, but the horses
had rambled further than usual, and we could not start until
half-past 8. We crossed the Gairdner at 5 minutes past 2, higher
up than on our outward trip, at a gravelly ford. The stream-beds
which we crossed generally contained water, but not so much as
when we passed before; the water was now for the most part in
pools. Camped on the Gairdner. Particularly noticed Mount
Lyell in passing. There are neither trees nor herbage on either
peak, and very little of either on any part of the hill. At its


base there is the usual supply of grass and scattered timber. On
a hill to the north of Mount Lyell we collected some very large
pods of a triangular shape, from a creeper with a thin stalk. The
pods were disproportioned to the size of the stalk, nearly as much
so as a melon is to a melon-vine. They were not quite ripe, but
ripened by keeping, and, bursting open, exhibited a large quantity
of a cotton-like substance, with which the seeds were enveloped.
Encamped at the Gairdner, under the so-called mulberry-tree,
the large dark leaves of which shaded us from the sun. Some of
the ripe fruit dropped, but they were full of maggots. Left the
Gairdner at 20 minutes past 3, and at 5 o?clock halted for the
night on a creek running south, near the largest currant-tree I
have seen. It was loaded with fruit, which we obtained by
cutting down large boughs. We have not seen much game since
leaving the Glenelg. Yesterday we came across two emus, and
to-day saw one kangaroo, and birds called native companions?a
species of heron apparently. They were large birds, and I took
them at first for turkeys. The creek was very bare of water,
which seemed to be drying up fast. The mosquitoes were very
troublesome, as they have been at every place north of the Glenelg
and at our first depot south of that river. Some of the people declared
they were three inches long, but this is not the case. The largest
may be half an inch long. There is no doubt but that they are
great pests, and I do not envy the first settlers of this portion of
Western Australia.
April 2 Sth. ?We proceeded homewards by 10 o?clock, and
w'ere again among those from whom we parted a short time ago,
and who came around to know all about the new country we
had seen.
If the result of our journey is not what w r e hoped, it is not
altogether unsatisfactory. Our knowledge of this portion of the
country has been enlarged, and we have no longer to rely upon
the statements, or to be guided by the opinions, of others. Our
expedition has proved to my satisfaction that the country over
which we travelled, south of the Glenelg, w'as similar in every
respect to that travelled over by Grey some 15 miles to the
eastward, and the probability is that the intervening country is
of a like nature. Whether it is as rugged and unpromising to
the westward I hope to discover by sending an expedition in that
direction. At the spot where we turned back, which was a few
miles south of Grey?s, and some 10 or 12 miles north of Lushing-
ton?s farthest, the prospect of advancing in our course, on horse-
back, w r as very poor. There was an opening to the westward
which might possibly lead to an outlet from the ranges in a
southerly direction. This will have to be tried. Should the attempt


fail, then horses must be taken as far as practicable, and from this
point parties on foot must explore the ranges.
Should level and fertile country be discovered south of the
ranges, then the hills over which we travelled will not be valueless.
Not only do they admit of stock being driven over, supplying
abundance of feed and water, but the elevation of the land will
render it well adapted for runs upon which to depasture, at certain
seasons, a portion of the stock which at other times feed on the
plains. The land does not of course yield so much grass, even in
the most fertile spots, as in the plains, much of the country from
its nature being unproductive ; yet a limited number of stock may
be kept in good health and condition in the ranges, which, I am
convinced, will become valuable when the low country on either
side is occupied.
I do not consider, nor do those whom I have consulted consider,
that sheep ought to be imported at present. Setting aside all
question of climate, the feed in its present state is not adapted for
sheep, but for large stock only. To bring sheep into this district
would, to say the least, be attended with much risk. Those that
have already been introduced have not done so well as to encourage
the importation of others. lam aware of the force of the argu-
ments employed to show that the fate of the sheep landed at
Camden Harbour ought not to influence speculators. It is said
that they were too young to withstand the effects of a sea-voyage
and a tropical climate, that they were not properly tended, that
they arrived at an exceptional season, that they were depastured
in the neighbourhood of the sea-coast, and so on. I allow all
this, but, at the same time, I do not see any reason for not dis-
couraging the importation of sheep for the present. Whether they
will ultimately succeed, when the feed is cropped down by larger
stock, I cannot tell?time will show.
For horses, it is the opinion of every one that I have spoken to
on the subject, the country is admirably adapted. The feed is
well fitted for horses, who improve in condition, and they may be
reared in large numbers for markets close at hand.
Whether the feed and climate is adapted for cattle we have had
no opportunity of judging from personal observation, as none have
been imported, but those who have been accustomed to this de-
scription of stock speak highly of the capabilities of the country for
such purpose. One fact appears tolerably clear?that there is no
poisonous plant calculated to affect ruminating animals?or in fact
others, horses doing well?for none of the sheep have died from
the effects of poison. It was supposed, shortly after we landed,
that some of the Government sheep had died from the effects of
poison. 1 did not credit it at the time, and lam now convinced
that no vegetable poison exists. I speak of course only of the

country near the sea-coasts, where the sheep have been depastured,
but I may add that I have seen nothing in my travels at all
resembling the poison plant of South-Western Australia. What
will be the value of horned stock reared here will depend upon the
progress of settlement. Without a dense population, it appears
to me that their value must be estimated by that of the tallow,
hides, and horns they yield, less the cost of production.
I do not say much respecting the agricultural capabilities of the
country over which we passed, because our course would necessarily
lead us from the low country. I must confess, however, that the
alluvial land on the banks of rivers and streams was of less extent
than I anticipated. Of its richness there can be no doubt But
were the quantity ever so great, it would not promote settlement.
In this climate no white man could till the ground, nor would any
white man be able long to endure the attacks of the insect enemies.
In most parts of Australia these nuisances disappear, or at all
events become less, as settlement extends, but here the nature of
the crop on low alluvial river-side lands would encourage, and not
disperse, the mosquitoes.
If coolie labour is to be employed it will be when pastoral occu-
pations gradually lead to others, and when wealthy speculators
grow articles of commercial value. Rice, cotton, sugar, indigo,
tea, coffee, &c., will not be cultivated by the class of men who
usually emigrate to new countries and form the bulk of the popu-
lation. Except in the event of some extraordinary or exceptional
inducement for immigration, such as gold in large quantities, or
other metals which may be easily worked and transported to the
port of shipment, I do not conceive that the country I have seen
will be the home of a large European population. It is essentially
a pastoral country, and will be permanently settled only by the
extension of pastoral occupation from the southward. It is my
conviction of this fact and my knowledge that establishments have
already been formed along the north-west coast, that make me so
anxious to penetrate the southern barrier which separates this
portion of Australia from the more level country to the southward.
We are now but a comparatively short distance from Roebuck
Bay. When once a pass is found?it is not more than two weeks?
journey from our furthest depot, and an opening once made, ex-
tension of pastoral occupation is but a question of time.
Of the natural resources of the country over which we passed,
lam not qualified to give a scientific opinion. There are many
vegetable productions, which may become, which perhaps are,
valuable in connection with arts and manufactures, medicine, &c.,
but I cannot state the fact with certainty. Of the trees, I may
safely say that for building, for furniture, or even for fencing, but
very few are available, and those in situations which would require


their being consumed on the spot. Some of the timber might be
valuable for turnery and small ornamental work, for it is very
hard and close-grained, but for all domestic and field purposes
wood will have to be imported, especially for the coast settlements
?if any.
On the sandstone ranges there are no indications of mineral
deposits, but at the base of the hills and in the lower valleys,
among the basalt and trap, there are evident signs of much
metallic accumulation. Our time did not permit us to make a
close examination; nor do I think the knowledge possessed by
any of our party was sufficient to render the time profitably
employed which was devoted to mineral researches. I have
mentioned one spot as offering a prospect of gold-discovery, and
also alluded to the specimen of copper-ore brought from the
Glenelg. 1 may likewise state that there was an abundance of
iron ores, some of them very pretty specimens, but otherwise of no
value in a new country.
The health of every member of the party, excepting Mr. Cowle,
who had an attack of incipient fever for two or three days, was
excellent. Not only did cuts and sores, brought with us from
Camden Harbour, rapidly heal, but any damage received en route
from stone or wood, also healed in the course of a few days. Men
and horses both looked as well on their return as when they started.
Even the horses? legs looked healthy, considering the battering
they had received. With fine weather, good water, the absence
of all privation, or even annoyance, except the mosquitoes, a short
trip, and good health, it is no wonder that we were all pleased
with our journey. For my part I have seldom passed a more
enjoyable time than that which 1 spent during our wanderings
among the sandstones.
XVI. Marine Survey of Hie Northern Territory of South
Australia. By Mr. F. Howakd, Master E.N., to the Governor
of South Australia.
(Communicated by F. S. Dutton, Esq., f.r.g.s.)
On the 13th of May, having embarked the Government Resident
in the surveying schooner Beatrice , we proceeded to ascend the
Adelaide River, it being the intention of Colonel Finniss to explore
the upper part. We arrived at an anchorage about 6 sea miles
above the farthest point reached by the Beatrice last year on
the 17 th.
The same evening we were visited by a party of natives, who
came again the next morning; but on this occasion they were not
