GOVERNMENT GAZETTE" ESTABLISHED IN 1832.
THE history of the “ New South Wales Government Gazette,”
and its official office have now to be reviewed, and I am
sorry that the time at my disposal will only admit of a
cursory glance at their growth and development. Being
closely associated with the development of our govern-
mental institutions, they form a most important epoch
in the history of Australian printing. The subject is so
|| || || || || full of incident and vicissitudes, that I would crave a
boon from this Society to allow me in the near future to
devote an evening for an historical address, solely devoted to the
Government printing establishment of this State.
“ The New South Wales Government Gazette ” was founded during
the regime of Governor Bourke, apparently from the trouble and expense,
and the irregularities of the different printing firms contracting for
Government printing. Besides, the Government wanted an official
gazette akin to the “ London Gazette,” which was carried on in an
independent manner. Not having press or types of their own the
authorities entered into a contract with the executors of the late Mr.
Robert Howe, who owned the “ Sydney Gazette,” to print the official
paper.
The following is a copy of the historic notification, issued prior to the
paper’s appearance.
“ GOVERNMENT NOTICE.
“ Colonial Secretary’s Office,
“ Sydney, sth March, 1832.
“ His Excellency the Governor directs it to be notified, that arrange-
ments have been made for publishing, on Wednesday next, the 7th
instant, and on every succeeding Wednesday, an official paper, intituled
‘ The New South Wales Government Gazette,’ and consisting wholly of
the following particulars, namely: —Ist. All official notifications connected
with the public service of this Colony, where the expense is defrayed by
the Government. The heads of the several Departments will be pleased
to observe, that they are not to insert these notifications in any other
68683


paper in future; and that it will be necessary to transmit to the Colonial
Secretary by three o’clock of each Monday, whatever is intended for
publication in the same week. 2nd. All such advertisements as may be
sent to the printer respecting insolvencies, poundkeepers’ notices, and
all other notices and advertisements from public departments, where the
cost fall upon the parties concerned. For each insertion of these the
printer will be allowed to charge at the rate of three shillings for eight
lines, or less, and one penny for each line additional, the type being the
same as in the London Gazette.
“ By His Excellency’s command.
“ALEXANDER MCLEAY.”
Two days later the official organ was born. At the top of the first
page was the Royal coat of arms, very much the same as appears on the
present-day gazettes. Immediately under the seal appear the words
“ New South Wales Government Gazette, Published by authority.
Wednesday, March 7th, 1832.” The paper was foolscap in size, and
comprised four pages. The imprint at the bottom of the fourth page
read “ Sydney: Printed by R. Mansfield for the executors of the late
R. Howe. Price sixpence.”
Every subsequent weekly issue cost the public three half-pence per page,
and not one fixed price. For instance—No. 1, four pages, 6d.; No. 2,
eight pages, is.; No. 3, sixteen pages, 25.; No. 4, twelve pages, is. 6d.;
and so on.
The imprint on July 4, was ‘Sydney: Printed by Horatio Wills,
for the executors of R. Howe,” Mr. Mansfield having resigned to found
the Australian Gas Company.
In August, 1832, tenders were called for printing required for the Civil
Departments between October, 1832, and December, 1833.
In November, 1832, tenders were called for printing the “ New South
Wales Government Gazette ” during the year 1833.
It will thus be seen that the Government printing was contracted for
by the private printing firms of Sydney. As there was not a single office
able to do the whole of the Government printing it was divided among
two or more of them.
The “ Gazette ” was printed for some years by the executors of Robert
Howe, and afterwards by Mr. F. M. Stokes at Lower George-street, near
to the present Fire Brigade Station. The office was where the “ Sydney
Gazette ” under Howe, and the “ Herald ” under F. M. Stokes, and
Messrs. Kemp and Fairfax, were printed. The place was called “ Red-
man’s Court.” In 1832, the “ Government Gazette ” contained 492


pages; 1111833,534; 1111834,924; 1111835,948; 1111836,990; 1111839,
976; in 1838, 1,145; in 1839, 1.485; in 1840, 1,437; and in 1841, 1,815.
In September, 1840, the usual notification appeared calling for tenders
for printing, but this was countermanded on 21st November by an
announcement that the Government intended to establish a printing
office. In numerous despatches Governor Gipps had complained to the
Home Office of the difficulties experienced in dealing with private printing
firms. Writing on 14th January, 1841, to Lord John Russell, he men-
tioned several inconveniences, one being that the Legislative Council
“ had often been kept waiting for a considerable period for the printing
of bills and other papers, and the general business of the Government
had been retarded from the want of proper forms.” At this time Mr.
James Tegg, a son of the famous London printer, Air. Thomas Tegg, had
the printing of the Legislative Council papers. With respect to the
“ Government Gazette,” the Governor said “ that notwithstanding
every precaution, frequently it does not appear until a week after the
proper day of publication.” The “ Sydney Herald,” under Kemp and
Fairfax, was at this time printing the paper, which they had bought
from the original proprietors as already described. Although the con-
tractors entered into sureties of £IOO each for the due performance of
their work, the Governor said the contractors did not “ feel themselves
obliged to fulfil their engagements,” through the absence of competitors,
and it was found impossible to compel them. Under these deplorable
circumstances, the Governor reported he had established a printing
office, which would be “ under the exclusive orders and control of the
Government.”
At this time the Governor had appointed (on 14th December, 1840)
Mr. John Kitchen as printer, at a salary 0f.£300 per annum. Mr. Kitchen
was a practical printer, and had been for years superintending one of the
largest offices in Sydney. There were also appointed two free men as
assistant printers, one at £2OO per annum, and the other at £l5O per
annum.
It was arranged that the remainder of the establishment should be
about twenty convict men and some boys, the rations for the men costing
£465 per annum, with £2OO for overtime. The cost of press, types, &c.,
was put down at the modest sum of £1,400, and £4OO was set apart for
new materials, while the amount for salaries would be about £650 per
annum.
Early in 1841 the new offices were opened in the old Immigration
Barracks, a double range of wooden structures at the corner of Bent and


Phillip Streets. One of the sheds ran along the lane between the Library
and the present Printing Office, while the second row faced Phillip-street.
Mr. Kitchen’s term of office was not long, for he was succeeded, about the
middle of 1841, by Mr. William John Row, who had for years been the
managing printer of the "Australian” newspaper. Two years later
there was great commotion at St. James’s Church, the event being the
marriage of the Government Printer to Frances Annie, eldest daughter
of Mr. Edward Alcock, proprietor of the City Printing Works, in
Jamieson-street. In February, 1845, Mr. William Weare Davies (who
had for years been Superintendent) succeeded Mr. Low as Acting Govern-
ment Printer, under a board of management, consisting of the Clerk of
the Legislative Council, the Colonial Storekeeper, the Auditor-General
and, subsequently, the Immigration Agent.
Owing to a great increase of work larger premises were required, and a
removal was made to the range of buildings on the left side of Hyde Park
Barracks at the top of King-street, now the site of the District Court.
In 1849 the offices were first lit with gas, and on 7th August, the same year,
the Parliamentary Printers Act was passed, to protect printers printing
papers on the authority of the Legislative Council. This Act confirmed
the hitherto provisional appointment of Government Printer, and defined
the power and duties of the position. Under it Mr. Davies was gazetted
Government Printer.
From 1850 to 1855 there was an exodus of population to the newly-
discovered gold-fields, and the gold-mining mania partially paralysed
the work of the office. It was only by the payment of very high wages
to compositors and pressmen that the difficulties were tided over. On
15th February, 1854, Mr. William Hanson assumed the office of Govern-
ment Printer, and very soon after the functions of the board of manage-
ment ceased. This epoch in the life of the office was brought about by
Premier Cowper deeming it incompatible with responsible government
that there should be any intervening authority between the Ministry
or the Premier and such an important and confidential department.
The great increase of work established the fact that the premises then
occupied were totally inadequate and unsuitable. The congested state
of business needed a large structure, and the whole of Hyde Park
Barracks was offered to meet present and future requirements. This
proposition was declined on the ground that the building was “ rather
too large and unsuitable.” It was then resolved to erect new and
suitable buildings on the corner of Bent and Phillip streets. On 26th


April, 1856, Government Printer Hansor entered into possession of the
first section of the new buildings, and sh.ce then there have been twelve
additions, until the place has become cue of the most extensive printing
establishments in Australia.
Since the establishment of resoonsible government there has been an
era of development and expansion in the creation of new departments, &c.
In 1857 Hr. Hanson introduced the postage-stamp branch, and in 1859
the bookbinding branch. The veteran printer, Mr. Thomas Richards,
who entered the office on Ist February, 1846, was inducted into the
office of Government Printer on Ist June, 1859, and held the position
twenty-seven years, retiring on Ist November, 1886, with a pension
under the 1884 Superannuation Act.
He was the pioneer and organiser of the following departments in
the years set opposite them: —-
iß6o.—Perforating stamps and machine numbering.
1864. —Stereotyping and electrotyping.
1865. —Printing of duty stamps and paper-ruling.
1867. —Railway tickets printing.
1868. —Photo-lithographic and lithographic.
1877. —Photo-mechanical.
1879. —“ Parliamentary Debates,” and many other branches too
numerous to mention.
His colleague since the year 1851, Mr. Charles Potter, became his
successor on Ist November, 1886. Mr. Potter had been Superintendent
from February, iB6O, and was on nth November, 1896, pensioned off
under the Public Service Act. His onerous office of Government
Printer and Inspector of Stamps was on nth November, 1896, bestowed
on Mr. William Applegate Gullick (who had for many years managed
one of the biggest printing firms in the Colonies), and he is still in the
office.
In 1848, by virtue of an Act, the first postage stamps were struck off,
and on Ist May, 1852, prepayment of postage was definitely established.
The stamps were executed under the contract system, and the contractor
received 2s. fid. per 1,000 for printing the stamps on Government paper
ungummed, under the supervision of Mr. R. P. Raymond, Inspector of
Stamps. On 21st January, 1857, the work was transferred to the
Government Printing Office and the printer made Inspector of Stamps.
At present 50,000 stamps can be printed in the same time as 150 did
under the contract system. In 1880 the stamps were divided by
perforated lines for the first time. In 1878 stamped envelopes were


introduced after many failures because of its cost. In November, iB6O,
Mr. Richards secured the first perforating machine ever brought to the
Colon}?.
In 1865, the printing of duty stamps commenced and ceased in 1874,
when the Stamp Duties Act lapsed. In July, 1880, the Stamp Duties
Act once more came into force, and it is a long story to tell of its benefits
to the revenue ever since.
In 1857 the bookbinding branch was established with a millboard
machine and a guillotine, but the up-to-date machinery since added
would fill an hour to dilate upon, and I have not the time to-night; but
this I say: the work turned out is in quality unsurpassed, even in
Europe.
In the mechanical branch the operations include type-casting, stereo-
typing, guillotine-knife grinding, lithographic-stone dressing, type and
metal furniture casting, machine fitting and repairing, printing-machine
roller-casting, die-sinking, engraving, manufacture of postage and duty
stamps, electrotyping, and other operations too numerous to mention
to-night.
The photo-mechanical branch was introduced by Mr. Richards after
he had visited Europe in 1877, and he added the Woodbury type, hclio-
tyPe > carbon printing, and other valuable processes. This subject
deserves half an hour to describe, but time flies to-night. If our Govern-
ment Printers were more often sent home to learn the up-to-date processes,
it would be a good thing for the department financially and otherwise.
The work of printing railway tickets commenced in 1857 on thin
paper, with butts like the present tram tickets, but this was abandoned
for cardboard tickets on the introduction of a set of Edmondson’s patent
railway-ticket printing machines. The work was carried on under the
control of the Commissioner of Railways until June 15th, 1867, when
the Government Printer took charge, but it was not until August, 1880,
that the apparatus was transferred to the Government Printing Office.
1 ramway tickets were first used in September, 1879, f° r the Hunter-
street and Redfern tramway, and were like railway tickets, but a cheaper
and more expeditious method of printing them was adopted.
Debenture printing, by a process known as “ logotype bars,” was
invented by Mr. Richards, and the same was afterwards adopted by the
Bank of England and all the banks of the Australian Governments.
The history of the composing branch requires a lecture to itself to do
it justice. Hundreds of pages of printed matter are turned out daily.
In 1879 tl l6 printing of “ Hansard” was commenced, and this continues.


Previous to 1855 steam was unknown as a motive power, and for many
years the whole of the work was done by hand press. In 1853 Govern-
ment Printer Hanson set up his first printing machine, which had been
exhibited by Mr. Napier in 1851 at the first International Exhibition.
It was first driven by manual labour, but in 1855 a. three-horse power
engine was introduced to work it. Some years later a twelve-horse
power vertical engine, and an eighteen-horse power vertical compound
engine was added. Electricity is the motive power at the present date.
Several fine up-to-date machines have since been added, which give
remarkable evidence of the progress of the department. To describe
these briefly is beyond my powers of condensation, and must wait until
I give my lecture solely on the Government Printing Office.
