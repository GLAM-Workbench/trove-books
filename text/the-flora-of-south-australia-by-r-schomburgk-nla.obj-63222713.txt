FLORA OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
By R. Schomburgk, Phil. Dr., Director or Botanic Garden.
South. Australia does not offer the contrasts and changes in its con-
figuration and climatical condition that are found to exist in the east,
north, and west of the vast continent. It is deficient in high wooded
mountain chains and deep moist gullies ; and, with the exception of the
River Murray, has no great rivers, and but few lakes or swamps. The
rainy season is of short duration, and its rainfall limited, the average
being only 19 to 21 inches during the year. Its climate also, with the
exception of the intra-tropical part, is. of a more equal character than
that of the other parts of Australia. All these characteristics may
account for the flora of South Australia being less numerous in genera
and species of plants, compared with those of the other parts of
Australia.
Throughout its varied zones there is not a greatly marked diversity in
the physiognomy of its vegetation, and its exhibits on the greater part of
its area are of a similar character. In character the South Australian
flora is intermediate between the south-eastern, south-western, and the
tropical floras of Australia. The absence of high mountain chains
imparts to the country and vegetation a degree of monotony from the
absence of the umbrageous forest region.
The most predominant orders of the South Australian flora, like those
of the other parts of the Continent, are ? Leguminosae, Myrtaceae , Com-
positae, Proteaceae, Cruciferae, Rubiaceae, and Gramineae; abundant in
genera, species, and individuals. Very singularly circumscribed are the
genera and species in area ; many are found in one spot alone, and a
diversity in soil and locality brings forth other genera and species. The
rapid succession of forms, and the contrast in this respect between the
northern and southern parts being remarkable.


The bark of most of the trees is usually smooth and of a greyish
color, which no doubt is accounted for by the slight atmospheric
changes?the contrast not being so sudden and great as in colder climates.
Most of the leaves of the trees and shrubs are coriaceus, rigid, and pun-
gent, and of a shining glauceous color, which is especially perceptible
in the orders Proteaceae and Epacrideae. Yellow-colored flowers are the
most predominant.
The preponderance of the two great genera of the Australian flora,
viz., Eucalyptus and Acacia, also prevails over the whole area of South.
Australia, but with a deficiency in species in comparison with those of the
west and east flora. The number of species of Eucalypts know at pre-
sent in Australia is about 134, of these only 30, and of Acacia, of
which 300 species are described, only 70 appear in South Australia.
The trees of South Australia do not reach so great a height as those
in the east, north, and west; the average that our tallest trees, the
Eucalypts, obtain, being from 100 ft. to 120 ft., with a stem of from 4ft.
to oft. in diameter; and such trees are only found in districts favored by
good soil, or on the banks of the rivers ; but these heights sink into
insignificance compared with those of trees indigenous to Victoria,
Tasmania, and Western Australia, where it is stated that Eucalyptus
globulus reaches 300 ft., and E. colloiu, F, Muell., of Western Australia,
400 ft.; but more astonishing still, that a fallen tree of E. amygdalina,
Lab., in the Dandenong Mountains, Victoria, measured 420 ft. in length.
The presence of different species of trees in South Australia is also
limited in comparison to the other parts of Australia. According to
Baron von Mueller, the list of trees above 30ft. in height in Australia
comprises 950 kinds. Of these 88 are found in South-Western Australia,
only 63 in South Australia, 146 in Victoria, 385 in New South Wales,
526 in Queensland, 212 in North Australia, and 29 in Central Australia.
Only the Eucalypts furnish South Australia with timber. They are
found in all parts over the area of the Colony, and constitute most useful
timber-producing trees.
Amongst the eighteen to twenty species of Eucalypts appearing in the
extra-tropical part of South Australia, there are only four to six kinds
which are most valued. These are distinguished by certain colonial
names, such as red, white, and blue gum, stringybark, and peppermint,
Eucalyptus rostrata, Schlecht.; viminalis, Labil.; odorata, Behr. Their
timber is highly valued for building, railway, water, and wheelwright
work, as naves, felloes, and spokes, and as posts for fencing and other
purposes. The stringybark, Eucalyptus obliqua, Lher., is much valued,
being the only kind fit for shingles, and, as a free-splitting wood, the
best for forming rails ; but it is not so durable as the other kinds.
The -wood of the Acacia tribe is only useful for cabinetwork and
turning, for which purpose the black wood, Acacia melanoxylon, B. Br.,
is very much valued. The wattle of the colonists, Acacia pycnantha,
Benth., is very valuable, on account of its freely-exuding gum, and also
for its bark, the latter containing excellent tanning qualities ; and both
these products form a very important article of export. The wood of


the so-called sheaoak, Casuarina stricta, Ait., is of an excellent character
and used for cabinetwork, turning, and handles for tools.
The tea-trees, a name applied by the colonists to the genera Melaleuca
and Leptospermum, constitute a class of hardwood usually found in low,
moist situations, and on the banks of creeks; is valuable on account of
its imperishable nature when used underground, or even in water. The
timber is remarkably close-grained, extremely hard when dry, very
heavy, and generally sound in the heartwood, which is not always the
case with other hard-wooded trees.
The pretty mottled wood of the native pines of South Australia, Frenela
robusta, A. Cun., and rhomboidea , Endl.,lack durability, and are mostly
used for fencing stuff and fuel. The native cherry, Exocarpus cupressi-
formis, Labil., the honeysuckle, Banksia marginata, Cav., furnish also
handsome woods for cabinetwork; and Myoporum acuminatum, R. Br.,
has a white soft timber, extremely tough, forming excellent knees for
boats.
A most remarkable fact in South Australian vegetation is the absence
of native eatable fruits, of which there are none deserving the name, except
a few berry-bearing shrubs belonging to the order of Epacrideae and
Santalaceae, Astroloma, and Leucopogon, the principal species of which, the
native currant of the colonists, Astroloma humifusum, R. Br., and the so-
called native peach, Eusanus acuminatus , R. Br., bearing a globular fruit
of the size of a small peach, with a succulent epicarp and a hard, bony,
much-pitted endocarp, are all South Australia can boast of. There is
also a deficiency in eatable root-bearing plants.
A great many genera of plants of other countries which possess
valuable and powerful medicinal properties, have numerous congeners in
the extra-tropical, and more especially in the intra-tropical portions of
South Australia, of which I will only mention the following orders, viz.
Euphorbiaceae, JJrticeae, Campanulaceae, Solaneae, Apocineae t
Leguminosae , Asclepiadeae, Gentianeae , Scrophularineae, &cc.; containing
numerous genera and species, probably possessing similar valuable
properties, which may be considered as so much buried riches hitherto
unheeded, and therefore not utilized. Only lately the wonderful febri-
fugal properties of the Eucalypts have been discovered in Europe. The
polygonaceous plant, Muehlenbeckia adpressa, Meisn., called by the
colonists ?Native Sarsaparilla,? produces the same effects as the true
Smilax Sarsaparilla, Lin.; and the Erythraea australis, R. Br., contains
the same bitter as its congener in Europe, Erythraea Gentaurium, Pers.
There are no doubt many trees of the orders Urticeae and Sapindaceae
containing also that valuable substance caoutchouc, especially the species
of Ficus, so abundant in the intra-tropical part of South Australia.
The same ignorance prevails also with regard to the fibrous and dye
plants. Of the first I will only mention the Linum marginale, A. Cun.;
Hibiscus tiliaceus, Lin.; the Crotalaria dissitiflora, Benth., from the
fibres of which the natives prepare their fishing nets and cordage.
Several other plants are known to possess the same properties, especially
Pimelea stricta, Meisn.; axifiora, F. Muell.; and microcephala, R. Br.


Gum and resin bearing trees are also abundant. I have already
mentioned the valuable gum of the wattle, Acacia pycnantha, but there
are several more species producing gum, as Acacia acuminata, Benth., &c.
The conspicuous plants which greatly contribute to the interesting
character of the Australian Flora, the grass trees of the colonists?
Xanthorrhoea quadrangulata, F. Muell,, and semiplana, F. Muell., ex-
clude a resin, which contains nitro-picric acid, from which a valuable dye
may be prepared.
The flora of South Australia provides copious material for the manu-
facture of the best paper. Not alone a great number of representatives
of the Gramineae and Cyperaceae, viz.: Dichelagne crinita , Hof.,
Xerotes longifolia, R. Br., Cyprus lucidus , R. Br., vaginatus, R. Br.,
Scirpus lacustris, Lin., but also the bark of Eucalypts , and the leaves
and bark of Casuarina, provide splendid material for paper.
Poisonous plants are known, though there are not many in South
Australia. One of the most dangerous to the sheep stock is the Lotus
australis, Andr., which is very generally distributed, and does great
injury; but I consider the poisonous principle lies mostly in the seed.
The River Darling Pea, Swainsona Grayana, Lindl., produces also
poisonous effects on the cattle, especially on horses. A Lobelia, L.
pratioides, Benth., fortunately is not frequently seen in South Australia,
but it appears more plentiful in Victoria, to the great injury of stock.
Although the injurious weed Solanum nigrum is common in most
tropical and temperate parts of the globe, I think it has been introduced
into Australia with cultivation. Lawrencia spicata. Hook., is also con-
sidered by the stockholders on the Peninsula injurious to cattle and
sheep. But as the plant is eaten by the cattle before seeding without
injury, I believe that the rigid, pungent, bracteate leaves with which the
flower-spike is densely covered, especially in the upper part, and which,
as the seed ripens, become more coraceous and pungent, are the dan-
gerous parts of the plants, and these parts, when eaten in quantity, will,
no doubt, injure the mucus membrane of the stomach, and produce
inflammation. As the uniform character of the order of Malvaceae is
that it abounds only in mucilage, and is totally destitute of all unwhole-
some qualities, it would be very peculiar should this species contain
poisonous properties.
A very peculiar phenomenon of the South Australian vegetation is, that
most kinds of trees and shrubs, when dying, die from the tops down-
wards. It is also a remarkable characteristic that by age the common
habit of plants is often much changed, which is proved by the fact that
during the period of development and subsequently the individual parts
of those which are not flowering and fruit-bearing are different. This
anomaly, caused by age and time, not only refers to the dimensions of
leaves and flowers, but also to their nature.
If we review the several orders of plants of South Australia, we find
that the extra-tropical part is characterized by the remarkable absence of
several orders, although it is not impossible that by further discoveries in
the central part?as this part has, as yet, been but imperfectly explored


?a few representatives of one or the other order may yet be found; but
probably the number will not be extensive. The extra-tropical part of
South Australia is destitute of the following orders, viz.:? Simarubeae,
Burseraceae, Meliaceae, iSalicineae, Celastrineae, Ampelidae, Anacardiaceae ,
Magnoliaceae , Bixineae, Araliaceae, Malpighiaceae, Guttiferae , Ericaceae ,
Plumbagineae, Myrsineae, Sapotaceae, Ebenaceae, Styriaceae, Hydrophyl-
laceae, Gesneriaceae, Bignoniaceae , Saxifrageae, Samydaceae, Elaeagneae ,
Cupvliferae, Piperaceae, Selagineae, Scitamineae.
Although the order Orchideae is represented by numerous species of
terrestrial ones, there is an entire absence of epiphital Orchids in the
extra-tropical part. So are also Cryptogamic plants extremely rare ;
even the order Filices is poorly represented.
The orders most abundantly distributed over the whole area are: ?
Leguminosae, Myrtaceae, Compositae, Chenopodiaceae, Cruciferae, Pro~
ieaceae, Goodenoviaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Scrophularineae, Ficoideae ,
Boragineae, Labiatae, Amarantaceae, Convolvulaceae , Epacrideae ,
Urticeae , Orchideae , Amaryllideae , Liliaceae, Resiiaceae, Cyperaceae ,
and Grammineae.
Having given a general description of the flora of South Australia, I
proceed now to its special peculiarities in the several localities or regions
individualized and distinguished by the predominance of one or more
families, although the boundary is in no way so sudden as to preclude
certain species from spreading over all regions, especially trees, which,
at the same time, are equally common in the scrub and grass lands; and
also herbaceous plants, a great number of which appear in the grass
land, scrub, and forest region.
Notwithstanding the little apparent difference in the formation of its
surface soil and climate, the flora of South Australia introduces itself to
the observer in its geographical extension by special and peculiar forms of
plants in regions. These are the regions of the forest land, scrub land,
grass land, and the intra-tropical region.
Forest Land Region. ?'The region of the forest land in South
Australia occupies mostly the mountainous districts, and extending along
the base of the mountain chains. The forests have not the fullness and
lofty growth of those of other countries. The underwood is of a medium
size, more open and less difficult to penetrate; the forests are of less
extent and are intercepted by tracts of grass land. The Eucalypts are
the most predominant forests trees?the stringybark forming often whole
forests in some mountainous districts, but seldom seen on the plains.
Eucalyptus paniculata, Sw.; vitninalis, Labil. 5 rostrata, Schlecht. 5
odorata, Behr,, are the most prevalent species.
The trees of the forest do not appear crowded, and seldom do the
branches of a tree reach those of a neighboring one. The declivities of
the mountain ranges are for the most part similarly timbered, the trees
sometimes extending to the summits, often only half or two-thirds of the
remaining part being grassed, here and there with copses of low growing
shrubs, and stunted and much ramified trees; often the whole declivities
are grassed without even a shrub or tree.


Another feature of the tableland in the hilly districts is the appear-
ance of occasional hills, clothed only with a scanty covering of tussocky
grasses, among fragments of ironstone, quartz, and sand, destitute of all
other vegetation, except small scattered trees of the Casuarina stricta,
Ait., and glauca, Sieb., and the peppermint, Eucalyptus odorata, Behr.
The level tableland is generally covered with grass, but deficient in
shrubs. Here, scattered, are to be seen the most stately and majestic
trees of Eucalypts ; such tablelands appearing more like a park?the
trees standing seemingly at measured distances, single or in small clumps,
as if planted by the hands of a landscape gardener. The soil of such
tableland is generally speaking very rich, and produces abundant crops
of cereals. The underwood of the forests is mostly represented by the
following genera, viz., Correa, Alyxia, Prostr anther a, Grevillea, Hakea,
Isopogon, Exocarpus, Acacia, Banksia, Cassia, Calythrix, Pommaderis,
Leucopogon, Leptospermum, Daviesia, Dillwynia, Eutaxia, Platylobium,
Pultenaea, and shrubby Eucalypts.
The beautiful genus Epacris, which is only represented in South
Australia by one species, E. impressa, Labil, frequently covers whole
mountain ridges and declivities ; when in bloom the different shades of
color of its flowers produce an effect not easily described.
The most prominent and striking effect of the mountain forest region
is produced by the grass trees, Xanthorrhoea quadrangulata, F. Muell. ;
and semiplana, F. Muell. These plants have a peculiar grotesque
appearance of a type unknown in other countries, at once arresting every
traveller?s attention by their strangeness.
They appear mostly on the ridges and declivities of rocky and stony
hills, almost devoid of any other vegetation, and are also found on some
wooded lands, but never on the plains. Xanthorrhoea quadrangulata
grows from 10 to 12 feet high, often with a trunk about one foot or
eighteen inches in diameter, and the flower stalk from 6 to 10 feet
high. Sometimes specimens are found repeatedly branched in a dicho-
tomous manner, all the branches of equal thickness, which gives them a
most grotesque appearance. This species appears only in hilly districts
on the most rocky declivities; they drive their straggling roots into the
crevices of the rocks several feet down amongst the accumulated
vegetable soil. The grass trees are of slow growth; the largest specimen
must be several hundred years old. The second species, Xanthorrhoea
semiplana, is often found at the base of the hills in sandy soil; it forms
its stem underground, which extends often two to three feet before the
few straggling roots appear, and the leaves lie close on the ground.
This species is also of an ornamental character. The valuable brownish
yellow, resinous exudation of the root and lower part of the stem, I have
already mentioned.
The deep gullies formed by the ridges and hills, in which the dew
most frequently supplies the place of rain during the dry season, are
covered with shrubs and ferns. The soil is generally formed of black or
sandy peat of a very humid nature, being watered by streamlets running
throughout the year, and forming, in some rocky situations, picturesque


cascades. In such gullies are associated the most delicate and beautiful
plants the flora of South Australia produces. Only in such places do
we find assembled the handsomest ferns in great profusion, the stately
Tqdea africana, Willd., with trunks often sft. to 6ft. in circumference,
often forming impenetrable thickets along the rocky banks of the
streamlets ; Gleichenia microphylla, R. Br., thriving luxuriantly in the
crevices of the rocks; with the elegant Adiantum aethiopicum, Lin.,
Botrychium ternatum , Swartz., Lomaria discolor, WRld., and capensis,
Willd., Aspidium molle, Sw., Grammitis leptophylla, Swartz., and
rutifolia, R. Br., interspersed with the lovely Viola betonicaefolia, Sw.,
and hederacea, Labil., which border the water edges ; and the blue
flowers of Caesia and white of Burchhardia give a great charm to such
waterfalls not easily described.
The declivities of the gullies are mostly taken possession of by the
luxuriant-growing Pteris esculenta, Forst., massed together and forming
often impenetrable thickets, while the graceful Cheilanthes tenuifolia,
Swartz., is generally found in the grass land at the base of the hills,
extending even a short distance into the plains. There also grow mag-
nificent trees of Eucalypts.
In such gullies, with their fertile soil and cool clime, the greatest part
of our culinary vegetables are grown for the market to a degree of per-
fection unknown elsewhere, and uninterruptedly supplied throughout the
year. Not vegetables alone, but fruits, viz;? Gooseberries, strawberries,
raspberries, and currants, &c., are raised in the same perfection.
At the base, and also extending further up on the slopes of the hills
generally, in spots least covered with underwood, appear the various and
beautiful terrestrial Orchids, with their delicate and quaint flowers,
together with other monocotyledonous plants, viz : Patersonia longi-
scapa. Sweet., Hypoxis glabella, R. Br., Caesia parvijlora, R. Br., Arth-
ropodium laxum, R. Br. t> n
The most conspicuous Orchids are ;? Glossodia major, R. Br., Cala-
denia Patersoni, R. Br,, latifolia, R. Br., carnea, R. Br., Cyrtostylis
reniformis, R. Br., Pterostylis cucullata, R. Br., reflexa, R. Br., barbata,
Lindl., longifolia, R. Br., Thelymitra arista(a, R. Br., carnea, R. Br.,
Diurispalustris, Lindl.,macu/ato, Sm., longifolia, R. Br. The genus Ptero-
stylis is represented by numerous species. T-his aspect of tne forest
region applies to the Barossa Range, the most prominent near the coast.
Other mountain ranges in the far north may present different features.
The Scrub Land Region.? The regions of the so-called scrub
land appear over the whole area of South Australia, extending more or
less in the different districts; but more so in the north and east,
occupying about one-eighth of the whole area of the Colony. T. hey form
long stretches of desolate arid plains?the soil being of the poorest de-
scription, and unfit for cultivation, changing from loamy clay to pure
sand ; the surface is covered with fragments of silicious rock, ferruginous
sand, and iron stone ; of water in these tracts there is no indication.
The vegetation is of a stunted character, and the scrub is nearly destitute
of grasses and other herbage; the few genera of the first are mostly


Neurachne, Stipa, Isolepsis, Spinifex, the well-known kangaroo grass,
Anthistiria cihata, and a few Juncaceae, viz., Xerotes glauca, R. Br.,
and Jilliformis, R. Br. ; and these grow only in tufts, considerably apart
from each other. The absence of other herbage is as great during the
summer; but this almost entire deficiency is compensated by an endless
variety of genera and species of shrubs. The general impression given
by the scrub is dismal, although the great variety of shrubby plants
associated there, make it �highly interesting to the botanist. These
shrubs reach generally the height of four to six feet, interspersed with
stunted and ramified trees of the genera Cas uarina , Eucalyptus, San-
talum, Melaleuca, Exocarpus, Camphoromyrtus, Dodonaea, Frenela ,
Banksia, &c. Smaller shrubs of the genera Pimelea Leucopoyon
Dillwyma, Hibbertia, Acrotriche, Calythrix, cover the ground, and are
overtopped by higher growing ones, such as Hakea, Logania, Alyxia,
Myoporum, Stenochilus , Euphrasia, Thomasia, Bursaria, Poma-
derris, Haloragis, Melaleuca, Leptospermum, Eutaxia, Acacia, Isopogon,
Correa, Rhagodia, &c., forming sometimes impenetrable thickets ;in
other localities the scrub consists only of Eucalyptus dumosa, A. Cun.;
sometimes formed by other bushy Eucalypts, viz., Eucalyptus uncinata,
Turcz.; bicovor, A. Cun.; and incrassata, Labil; growing only six to
eight feet high, and extending hundreds of miles.
The most predominant color of the leaves of the scrub is a glaucous
green, interspersed here and there with whitish leaves of the Rhagodia
and other shrubs, having reddish brown leaves. Most of the leaves are
ovate, entire, coriaceous, and pungent; shrubs with pinnated leaves are
seldom met with.
The monotonous and dismal look of an extensive scrub is depressing,
especially when viewed from an eminence. The equal height of the
vegetation, the dull glacuous color of the foliage, look in the distance like
a rolling sea reaching the horizon?-at least the first sight of the Murray
scrub, extending hundreds of miles, produced this impression on my mind.
Everyone avoids the scrub as much as possible?many have lost their way
there and perished for want of water.
All the scrubs in the different districts produce the same common
impression, but the plants comprising them are not the same genera and
species, locality and soil affecting the character of the flora.
Shrubs of one kind or another are found in flower in the scrub
throughout the year. Most kinds produce their flowers in September and
October, the rainy season therefore alters the physiognomy of the scrub
very little ; but it calls into life numerous terrestrial orchids, of which a
good many kinds inhabit the scrub, viz.:? Erochilus, Caladenia, Diuris ,
Prassophyllum, Dipodium, Microtis, Cyrtostylis, &c. These appear with
some perennial and annual plants, viz.:? Hehchrysum, Drosera, Selip-
terum, Scaevola, Brunoma, Thysonanthus, Euphrasia, Goodenia, Hypoxis t
Senecio, &c., and annual grasses; but their duration is short, as with the
setting in of the dry season they disappear as rapidly as they appeared.
A most valuable scrub plant, at least for the pastoral community, and
appearing copious in the northern districts, is the so-called salt bush.


Airiplex nummularia, R. Br., on which during the summer and in times
of drought the sheep subsist. If all other vegetation is suffering from
the drought, the salt bush alone withstands the intense heat of the
sun and maintains its freshness, and saves thousands of sheep from
starvation. . , , ~
The Grass Land Region. ?The so-called grass land forms the
principal part over the whole area of South Australia, consisting in end-
less undulating plains, stretching from the coast towards the north and
east. Along the coast and hundred of miles inland the grass plains have
mostly disappeared, and now form agricultural districts producing the
finest cereals known?the soil varying from the best to some indifferently
good. .
But the grass plains of the interior, especially towards the north, so
extensive as to be lost in the horizon, are like deserts, emphatically
monotonous and desolate. Only here and there will be found some
fertile spots of grass land, but not of large extent, alternating with bare
sandstone ridges or rolling sandhills, interspersed with gravelly and
waterless flats. Their surface is often saline, covered with sharp angular
or weatherworn fragments of various sizes of ironstone, quartz, reddish-
colored sandstone, and conglomerate, supporting only a scanty herbage
of Airiplex, KocJiia, Salicornia, and Salsola, Spinifex and other perennial
grasses, growing in tufts, tinging the sandy surface. Groups of stunted
shrubs and small ramified trees, sometimes of a limited extent, rise Horn
the plains like islands of the ocean. They mostly consist of the shea-
oak, Casuarina stricta. Ait., glauca, Sieb., and distyla, Vent., Eucalyptus
odorata, Behr., dumosa, A. Cun., virgata, Sieb., wattle. Acacia pyc-
nantha. The plains near the coast are of a different character, the sou
mostly fertile, extending often to the sea, and constituting a great part
of our arable land.
The stratum of humus or fertile soil covering these plains occasions is
also an essential alteration in their vegetation. The grasses consist of
more nourishing kinds, viz.:? Poa, Panicum, Festuca, Agrostis, Aina,
Andropogon, Cynodon, Stipa, Pennisetum, Bromus, Eriachne, Anthis-
tiria, Hordeum, &c. Here appear also a great number of low-growing
shrubs, such as Purser a, Grevillea, and small ramified trees of pepper-
mint, Myoporum, Pittosporum, Cas uarina, and Acacia, either single, or
sometimes forming groves, without underwood, like oases in the desert.
The banks of the rivers and creeks, which mostly cease running during
the summer, are lined with majestic gum trees, often of immense dimen-
sions, and shrubs extending more or less upon the plains, according to
the nature of the soil. This vegetation, on both sides of the rivers,
appears like green ribbons, following their curves; these banks have
their peculiar flora ; here appears Viminaria, Leptospermum, Melaleuca ,
Myoporum, Hardenbergia, kc. ; herbaceous plants, Sium, Mimulus,
Myriogyne, Senecio, Lobelia, Petroselinum, Eryngium, Lotus, and the
following Juncaceae and Gramineae ? Juncus, Luzula, Xerofes, Neu-
rachne, Deyeuxia, Stipa, kc.
The grass land, in fact, the whole configuration of the plains, has a
great similarity to the Savannas of British Guiana ?naturally there is a


great discrepancy with regard to the two vegetations ; hut the Savannas
have mostly the undulating ground, the scattered ramified trees, the
oases, the rivers lined with a green belt; and the appearance of the
grasses and herbage covering the area, has, during the dry season, the
same sunburnt yellow character, and is destitute of all green herbage.
After the setting in of the rainy season, there is the same magic appear-
ance of the grasses and herbage.
In the month of May the rainy season generally commences, which has
a magical effect upon the herbage of the plains; a few heavy showers
change the aspect of the dried-up grasses and herbage into a green and
beautiful carpet.
The rapidity with which especially the annual grasses spring up, is
such that in a few days the plains appear clothed with luxuriant verdure,
which only northern countries ordinarily produce. With the grass are
also recalled to new life the yellow flowers of Ranunculus aquatilis ,
Lin.; lappaceus , Sm. ; rivularis, Banks.; Oxalis cognata, Steud.; Hypoxis
glabella , R. Br,; with the white flowers of Drosera rosulata, Lehm.;
the blue of the Wahlenbergia gracilis , Dec.; Anguillaria biglandulnsa,
R. Br.; Stackhousia obtusa , Lindl., with its perfume spreading flowers.
Every week adds new colors to the beautiful carpet. The scarlet
flowers of Kennedya prostrata , the violet ones of Swainsona procumbens,
F. Muell. ; and lesser tifolia, Dec.; the delicate flowers of Thysanotus
Patersoni climbing up the dry grass stalks, or overruning small shrubs.
The flowers of the isolated trees or copses of the wattles soon glitter in
their yellow clothing. The Loranthus Exocarpi , Behr., and Miqueli
Lehm., growing parasitical of the Casuarinas and Eucalyptus odorata y
adorned with their red flowers hanging in the air. The small shrubs of
Bursera spinosa are covered with their white flowers, mingled with the
red of different shrubby Grevilleas, Compositae, are seen blooming over
the plains in all colors; and every week brings new representatives of
floral beauty.
But by the middle of November the number of flowering plants already
lessens considerably, the annual grasses and other herbaceous plants
begin to dry up, droop, and disappear, and in January the grass land re-
sembles a ripe thinly-sown cornfield, and we find only solitary shrubs
covered with a few flowers or a few plants of Convolvulus erubescent ,
Lobelia gibbosa , Labil, the latter with their leafless and fleshy stalks,
and Mesembryanthemum australe, Soland. In some localities this period
appears earlier or later.
The seeds of the annual plants have been scattered, perennial herbage
returned to its dormant state, to awake to new life at the setting in of the
following rainy seasons; and the plains have during the summer months
a dismal dried up appearance.
There is another kind of grass land, appearing here and there in large
tracts, called ? Bay of Biscay land.? Such tracts have a peculiar, un-
dulating surface, and look like a waving sea which has suddenly become
motionless. The soil is considered very good, of a chocolate color and
produces fine wheat crops, but it must be ploughed several years before
the surface becomes level.


The flora of the Bay of Biscay land too has its peculiarity. The
Eucalypts shunning such tracts, which, however, are rich in compositae
and grasses, but poor in Monocotyledons.
The sea beach is mostly bordered with a belt of arborescent shrubs
and small trees of ramified growth, viz. -.?Melaleuca Preissiana, Schau ,
decussata, R. Br ., Alyxia, shrubby Eucalypts, Myoporum, Pittosporum,
and Santalum, interrupted with a thick belt of Avicennia officinalis, Lin.,
extending along the coast. The sandy, often saline, tracts stretching
towards the plains, are covered with Atriplex, Tetragona, Aster, Apium ,
Euphrasia, Zygophyllum, Nitraria, Erigeron, Cotula, Podolepis, Erodium,
Helichrysum, Leptorhynchus, Dianella, Arthropodium, Salsola , and
Mesembrianthemum, which are often supplanted by tracts of Spinifex ,
Xerodes, Juncus, Anthistiria, Lepidosperma , Isoltpis, Chaetospora,
Cladium, and Carex.
Intra-tropical Region. ?According to G. W. Goyder, Esq., Sur-
veyor-General, the country, especially near the coast of the intra-tropical
part of South Australia, consists principally of tableland of from 60 to
150 feet above the level of the sea, falling thence gently towards the
sea, although forming here and there into cliffs, which are fringed with
dense thickets of various-sized timber, matted together with bamboo, and
a variety of climbing plants and shrubs. The low lands near the sea,
especially such as are under the influence of the tide, are covered with
dense mangroves, Avicennia officinalis, Lin., and Phizophora mucronata ,
Lam. These, as the land ascends to a higher level, give place to palms,
Pandanus, Melaleucas, Leptospermums, Grtyilleas, Eucalypts, and
Acacias, forming an open forest. Amongst the underwood are found
ferns, Avoids, as Amorphophalus campanulatus, Decas, and Taccacea,
Tacca pinnatifida, Lin.
The grass over the whole, or nearly the whole, of the surface of the
ground, grows luxuriantly, of which the most prominent genera are the
following;? Fuirena, Cpprus, Eleocharis, Cimbopogon, Fimhristylis,
Panicum, Setaria, Sporobolus, Anthistiria, Eriachne, &c. The soil is
mostly good, and of a dark brown color, with small nodules of ferruginous
sandstone upon the surface.
Near the sea, and generally upon a watercourse near its junction with
the sea, swampy flats occur, containing timber of large growth and rank
vegetation. The lakes and waterpools are covered with waterlilies,
Nymphaea gigantea and Nelumbium speciosum, Willd., showing their
beautiful flowers in various shades of blue, pink, or crimson. The flats
on either side of large rivers also contain good soil, except where they
join the higher land, where there is a belt of sandy character, poor to
look at, though covered with timber and grass. The same kind of open
forest, undulating and fiat land, exists over the area, sometimes the soil
changing suddenly from a dark brown to a very light loam, the soil
improving and the vegetation along the rivers becoming luxuriant.
Judging from the plants collected by Mr. Schultz, who was employed
for about two years there as a naturalist, during which lime he obtained
about 700 species of plants, the intra-tropical flora of South Australia


does not present the luxuriant growth and umbrageous foliage we are
used to see in other tropical floras. The number of species is also very
small, owing, no doubt, to the dryness of the climate; and from the same
cause it is deficient in Epiphytal Orchids , palms and ferns. Acacias,
Eucalypts, Ficus, Bomhax Cupania, Terminalea, Psychotria, Grevillea ,
form the prevailing timber trees, and line the rivers; but the Eucalypts
and Acacias do not reach the gigantic size of their brethren in the extra-
tropical region. The following orders are well represented, viz.:?
Euphorhiaceae, Compositae, Convolvulaceae , Rubiaceae , Goodenoviaceae,
Leguminosae, Urticeae.
The representatives of the intra-tropical flora of South Australia seem
to extend towards the east, as a great number of genera and species
reach to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and even further. A great many
species of the Indian flora appear along the coast of the intra-tropical
part, viz. Strychnos, Tamarindus, the Cajaput tree, Melaleuca leuca-
dendron, appear abundant along the banks of the rivers, and even over
the dry sandstone tableland, but of less luxuriant growth.
The Naturalized Plants op South Australia. ?lt is a historical
fact that whenever man settles in a new country he not only carries the
weeds that are most troublesome in cultivated ground along with him,
hut he also exercises a potent influence over the indigenous vegetation,
especially when he engages in agricultural and pastoral pursuits. The
plough, the axe, the flocks and herds, are enemies to existing vegetation;
and as cultivation advances one representative after another succumbs to
the foreign influence. But the plough, axe, and herds are not the sole
destroyers of the native herbage, for with cultivation are introduced
noxious weeds, and the new comers, finding a suitable soil and climate,
spread with alarming rapidity, and become possessors of the ground-
ejecting the native plants, or taking their places by them as if they were
truly indigenous.
In proof of this I will only mention the names of a few of such
intruders, not only upon cultivated ground, but also over the uncuti-1
vated districts, to the great injury of the native herbage, viz.:?The
Cockspur, Centaurea melitensis, Lin. ; the Scotch thistle, Carduus
Marianus, Lin., and Onopordon Acanthium, Lin.; the Cape Dandelion,
Cryptostemma calendulacea, R. Br.; the Bathurst burr, Xanthium
spinosum, Lin.; the French catchfly, Silene gallica, Lin.; the Stink
Aster, Anihemis Cotula, Lin.; the so-called sheepweed, Lithospermum
davuricum, Lehm.; and arvense , Lin., which already cover large tracts
of pasture land, and will extend further and further, to the destruc-
tion of the native herbage. Legislation has not succeeded, notwith-
standing large sums have been expended in extirpating the two most
injurious intruders, viz., the Scotch thistle and the Bathurst burr, and
it remains to be seen whether the altered circumstances, which seem to
be so favorable to their growth, will prove permanent, or, by an over-
stimulation, a change will be gradually effected in the constitution of the
intruders, bringing about degeneracy and subsequent extinction.


It will not be uninteresting to give here a list of the more troublesome
weeds naturalized in South Australia, in addition to those already men-
tioned :
Lepidium mderale, Lin.
Capsella Bursa pastoris, Lin.
A triplex patula, Lin.
TJrtica urens, Lin.
Polygonum aviculare, Lin.
Cnicus lanceolatus, Lin.
arvensis, Hoffm.
palustris, Willd.
Cynara Scolymus, Lin.
Anagallis arvensis, Lin.
Gnaphalium luteo album, Lin.
Cerastium vulgatum, Lin.
Fumaria officinalis, Lin.
Ehapbanus Ehaphanistrum, Lin.
Stellaria media, Lin.
Lythrum byssopifolium, Lin.
Portulaca oleracea, Lin.
Foeniculum vulgare, Lin.
Sonchus asper, Yill.
Solanum nigrum, Lin.
Cirsium lanceolatum, Scop,
arvense, Scop.
A good many grasses from other countries, especially European, have
become domiciled in South Australia, which have improved the pasture
near the coast materially.
The South Australian cereals are considered to be the finest grown in
the world; and it is a fact that, with the exception of the intra-tropical,
all fruits from other parts .of the globe thrive most luxuriantly in South
Australia, and come to a perfection, in size and flavor, in the different
localities of the Colony, hardly known in other countries; and most
fruits, vegetables, and useful plants are found to improve materially by
the change, as the climatic conditions often succeed in modifying and
improving their condition. The finest grapes are grown on the plains ;
here they ripen to great perfection, and the South Australian wine must
soon obtain a high character in the foreign markets. On the plains also
grow apricots, peaches, nectarines, oranges, citrons, lemons, and shad-
docks, plums, cherries, figs, almonds, mulberries, olives, &c., &c., &c.;
while in the hills and gullies are grown strawberries, raspberries, cur-
rants, wallnuts, chestnuts, filberts, &c.,'&c., of the best quality. In
such gullies are also raised the finest vegetables and other culinary
herbs, at all seasons, in great abundance as also on the plains, during
the rainy season; cauliflowers, often two feet in diameter, are not seldom
seen; cabbage, turnips, asparagus, artichoke,leaks, onions, beet, carrots,
potatoes, endive, lettuce, radish, celery, &c.; cucumbers, the luscious
fruits of the sweet and water melon, pumpkins, &c., growing to a flavor
and size, which at home would be considered an exaggeration when
described.
The advancement in the taste for horticulture and floriculture in
South Australia is most praiseworthy and on the increase, as proved by
the manv tasteful gardens which are now seen, not only in town, but in
the environs and country; therefore the importation and acclimatization
of the most choice foreign plants, especially florists? flowers, is mar-
vellous, and most of these newcomers improve so in size and the
perfection of their flowers as to astonish any European gardener. At
the Botanic Gardens are cultivated about 5,000 outdoor plants, mostly
from all parts of the world.
The Alpine plants will not prosper in the gardens of the plains, but
find a genial clime in the hills and gullies (from about I,oooft. to 2,000 ft.


above the level of the sea), where we find the camellias, azaleas, rhodo-
dendrons, and other Alpine plants in great profusion. In such situations
thrive also our northern forest trees, oaks, beaches, birch, abies, kc. ;
while the elms, ash, poplars, Robinias, kc., luxuriate in the plains, In
the same localities the Californian pines, cypresses, and some of the
European pines thrive, but the Himalayan and several of the European
pines succeed only in the hills.
[The observations contained in the following pages have been extracted from papers
read by me before the Chamber of Manufactures, in Adelaide, with the object of
giving greater publicity to several undeveloped resources of South Australia.]
The following vegetable productions, although not yet forming articles
of export, or of much colonial consumption, might be raised with
advantage by immigrants who may not be in possession of large capital.
The lands, especially the gullies in the hilly districts, are adapted for
many other branches of agriculture than the all-engrossing object?the
cultivation of cereals ?and from amongst those mentioned the less wealthy
cultivator can make his selection.
See.ictjetxtke. ?The importance of introducing sericulture into South
Australia is undeniable, as we have clear evidence of the adaptability of
our climate to the production of an excellent quality of silk, for which the
demand is now unlimited, in consequence of the disease amongst the silk-
worms prevailing in the silk-producing countries in Europe, which is
unknown here. Considering how silk manufacture has increased for
centuries, and still continues to do so, the demand can never fail. For
many years, with all my energy, I have advocated sericulture as a paying
industry, and advised the extensive planting of the mulberry. To
facilitate the scheme, I made inquiries in Europe as to what kind of
mulberry was now considered the best for feeding the silkworm, and
introduced the seeds, and offered for distribution the young plants of the
most approved kinds; but lam sorry to say the demand for these was
very limited, and I hailed with delight the judicious act of the Govern-
ment in providing the means for laying out the first mulberry plantation
in South Australia at the Magill Orphanage, where my surplus stock
could be used. The object aimed at in this scheme will prove in future
most advantageous to that establishment. There is no doubt that the
production of silk will become one of our most important industries,
which will at the same time be a practical and useful aid to the ordinary
occupation of our farmers. As the silk manufacturers now prefer the
cocoons to the reeled silk, this will save a good deal of the tedious work
of sericulture. Many will say lam too sanguine in regard to the result
of sericulture in South Australia, but I think I see my way clearly ; and
I am more and more convinced by the favorable letter Mr, G. Francis
received some time ago from the Silk Supply Association, London. This
gentleman had sent different cocoons of his raising to that body to test
their value, and received the gratifying news that they were worth from
3s. to 6s. 6d. per pound. If we consider that 6s. per pound is the highest


price obtainable for the best cocoons in England, is not ss. 6d. per pound
a most encouraging fact in regard to the quality of the South Australian
cocoons ? lam informed by another gentleman, an enthusiastic seri-
culturist, Mr. Wurm, that by receiving 6s. per pound cocoons would pay
well. In regard to the growth of the mulberry throughout the Colony,
I may say it grows everywhere. We find the trees growing at Glenelg
and Brighton, close to the beach in sand, as luxuriant even as in the hills
or elsewhere. In Italy, as I understand, sericulture is divided into
three different branches?namely, the growing and selling of the
mulberry leaves, the rearing of the cocoons, and the reeling of
the silk; and, in comparison with the work employed, one pays as
well as the other. But it is not my intention to give a scientific
description of the manufacture of silk, or the culture of the mulberry,
and in order not to trespass too much, I will not go into the
dry details of figures as to the enormous amount of money which is
spent in producing silk, but will only call your attention to the extra-
ordinary fact that the sum paid for silkworm eggs from China and J apan
is about �IOO,OOO yearly. Although I feel aware that in giving bonuses
great caution must be exercised, yet I feel confident that a bonus for the
first half ton of coocons, in four bales of 2501b5. each would be worth
the consideration of our Parliament. I have mentioned half a ton, feel-
ing that, limited to a smaller quantity, it might only lead people to
cultivate for the bonus, without an earnest desire to promote the industry.
I am expecting by every mail a quantity of mulberry seeds, and probably
next season will be prepared to distribute a number of plants. This, I
find, is a good plan to lay the basis of new industries. There are many
people who shrink from the trouble of procuring seed and raising the
plants, but if they can get trees they will plant them. I may also
mention here that, after many trials of different kinds of mulberries for
the food of the silkworm in the silk-producing countries have been
made, the white mulberry (Morns alba) is now considered the best; but
a variety (Morns multicaulis) is used for the young worms, it beginning
to leaf four weeks earlier than Morns alba, and this kind should not be
omitted in any mulberry plantation.
Flax and Hemp.? We may say, with gratification, that the energetic
and enterprising farmers in the South have laid the basis of a new and
probably remunerative industry?that of flax-growing. If we consider
the unfavorable season the flax-growers had to contend with, the first
result is in every way most encouraging; and I hope for the well-doing
of the Colony that other districts will follow the example, as there is no
doubt that flax will grow in most of our districts, and yield a fair
return. I would also call the attention of the farmers to the growth
of the hemp plant, another saleable article, much sought after in
the home markets, both for its fibre and seed. Ihe latter is noted in
the last price current at 44s to 48s per hundredweight; and considering
the heaviness of the seed, it yields a remunerative price. Ihe hemp
plant will grow in any kind of soil, and could probably be grown
throughout the Colony with profit; and to show what an important plant


hemp is which produces one of the best cordages, during the last three
quarters of the year 1,050 tons of cordage and rope have been imported.
This shows the great importance of the attention of our colonists being
called to the subject.
Beetroot. ?l am convinced that the soil and climate, especially in
the neighborhood of Mount Gambier, is admirably adapted for the growth
of the beetroot, for the manufacture of sugar and other purposes.
According to the latest statistical news from home, there are at present
1,184 beet sugar works on the Continent of Europe, and the total
produce of these is about four and a half million hundredweights of
sugar annually; upon an average about 4,0001b5, is obtained from
500cwt, of beet, and this quantity is the yield of about two and a-half
acres. The refuse, after the sugar is extracted, forms an excellent
article of food for cattle, and is considered even better than any specially
cultivated for the purpose ; a good quality of paper is also made from it.
The molasses is also used up for fodder, not being fit for sweetening on
account of the mineral salt it contains. As mentioned before, there is no
doubt that the beet will grow in many districts of the Colony; and if
we can produce the beet sugar for the same price as cane sugar imported,
it will become a flourishing industry; and then we must consider the
fact that with a beet sugar manufactory the fattening of cattle must be
connected, which will also produce a fair return. But this is not all?
the farmers, by beet-growing, will have the advantage of a rotation crop,
ot which is severely felt in South Australia. In Prussia, where
beet sugar manufactories are established, no cereal fields are observable
for miles around?the eye only meets beet fields, they paying the farmer
far better than cereals.
Hops.? Of this very important plant we have already proof of success-
ful growth in the samples of hops grown at Lobethal, Encounter Bay,
Mount Barker, and Mount Gambier; at the latter locality it is already
cultivated extensively, with satisfactory results. It is true we have not
many favorable districts in the Colony for the profitable growth of this
valuable plant; but there is no doubt that in other districts besides the
above-named, suitable spots will be found.
Tobacco.? There is no doubt that many districts of the Colony are
well adapted for the culture of tobacco. Much attention was given to its
cultivation in the early days of the Colony, and superior tobacco was
made; but its cultivation became entirely neglected when the high prices
of wheat which have since ruled, made that cultivation more remunera-
tive than that of tobacco. I remember in the year 1851 seeing at Lyn-
doch Valley a tobacco-field which not only attracted my attention, but
created my surprise and admiration, having scarcely seen better plants
during my travels on the Orinoco. I will not maintain that the South
Australian tobacco could, or ever will, surpass the South American or
West Indian in flavor; but we shall produce, no doubt, a fair sample,
just as good as is produced on the Continent. I was so much astonished
at seeing this Lyndoch Valley field of tobacco that I measured some of
the leaves?and on referring to my note-book I find that their average


isize was twenty-one inches long, by twelve inches wide. lam convinced
that having gained experience in its manufacture, we shall produce a fair
sample ; and should we even fail in this the first or second year, the
produce could be used for sheepwash, and remunerate the grower. If
we consider the great sum which the Government derives from the duty
on imported tobacco, I think we should endeavor as much as possible to
retain at least one part of the money in the Colony, which is yearly sent
away for tobacco. I may repeat, there is not the slightest doubt that a
great many districts in our Colony are adapted for the growth of this, I
may say, indispenable luxury?namely, the South, the neighborhood of
Adelaide, Hope Valley, Mount Barker, Gumeracha, Blumberg, Lyndoch
Valley?and many more favorable spots would be found. At the Botanic
Garden good plants may be seen growing, notwithstanding the late un-
favorable season, producing good leaves, without the slightest attention
being paid to them. Local tobacco and cigar factories have been estab-
lished, but at present mainly depend on imported leaf tobacco for their
supply.
Zante Currant, Sultana and other Raisins. ?lt is a gratifying
fact to observe that our first sample of Zante currants sent to Melbourne
are considered by our neighbors as of most excellent quality, superior,
cleaner, and of better quality than that of the imported ones. And we in
South Australia till now have thought little of them. The proverb, ? A
prophet is not thought much of in his own country,? is here applicable.
We produce an article which is considered superior to that we import,
and yet very little has been done in the culture of the Zante currant and
raisins. If we consider that the annual import of dried fruits into the
Australian Colonies is generally more than �120,000, and as we
know that our climate is in every way favorable to these productions, is it
not surprising that no more attention has been paid to these sources of
profit ? I would strongly recommend all the vignerons, especially the
smaller ones, having from one to three acres of vineyard, to graft all the
worthless kinds of grapes with Zante currant, Sultana and other raisin
grapes. It is gratifying to me to have added something to this extensive
branch of industry by the introduction of the Sultana grape, which is re-
garded by the vignerons with extreme satisfaction. I may say that from
information received probably more than two-thirds of the 1,100 grafts I
distributed last year have grown; and this valuable raisin, which com-
mands the highest prices in the European markets, may be considered as
established in the Colony, Very little attention has' been paid to the
drying of apples, apricots, plums, figs, and other fruits, from which some
profit could be derived, but which unfortunately are frequently left to rot
on the ground.
Almonds. ? Of these till now very little has been thought, and in
consequence the trees have been utterly neglected, because, as the phrase
goes, ?they won?t paybut I am of a different opinion, since I have
seen that the almonds will form a profitable export. In the last London
Prices Current, Jordan almonds are quoted at 85s. to 2405. per cwt.;
and in their shells, 60s. to 70s. Is this not an encouragement to pay


more attention to this, till now, neglected tree, which will grow in every
locality?a tree Avhich is satisfied with every soil, and will produce every
year a bountiful return? We see hundreds, I may say thousands, of
almond trees scattered over the Colony; we see trees in nearly every
garden?hut their fruits are worthless. I think two-thirds of the trees
grown here are only seedling plants. Naturally they never will produce
a marketable fruit; the grafting knife should be used, and I would
recommend the Jordan and Brandis varieties, which are much sought
after by the trade. I hope horticulturists, as well as agriculturists, will
take this into their consideration; for it must be plain to them that
almonds will pay for export for the little trouble bestowed on them.
There may be many nooks and corners on their property where almost
nothing else will grow. I can assure them the almond tree will be
satisfied with such spots?only they must not neglect trenching the
ground first.
Olives. ?l think there is scarcely any country where the olive thrives
better than in South Australia, Having been largely planted by the
early colonists in a variety of situations, and in diverse soils, there is
abundant evidence of their facility of culture in the fine growth of the
trees, yielding larger quantities of fruit, which is eagerly sought for by
manufacturers of oil, now carrying their operations on with success. The
samples produced are considered as fine as the best Italian oil, and being
pure, are of course far better than that usually imported. But little
labor is required in the cultivation of the olive after the seedlings (which
can be procured in abundance) are planted and grafted, and the picking
of the fruit is easily done by women and children. The market price of
the berries is about 6s. to ss. 6d. per cwt., and oil in quantity has been
sold at auction at from 6s. 6d. to 10s. per gallon, the retail price being
12s. for best quality. Large plantations have lately been made, and
this industry may now be considered an established fact. There is a
large home consumption and an unlimited export market.
Bicinus, or Castor-oil Plant. ?This tree, considered as worthless
as the almond, we see thrive in every locality, andiin every soil, poor or
rich. We see it grow close to the coast in almost pure sand, covered
with seed, and generally regarded as a nuisance. But the hundred-
weight of seed of this nuisance is noted, according to the last Prices
Current as worth 10s. to 12s. The ricinus, as I remarked, will grow
where scarcely any other vegetation will grow, and such spots are
generally found on farms. Why not plant them with ricinus ? After
planting, there is little or no trouble except .gathering the seeds, which
can be accomplished by children; and if a tree brings only 3s. to 4s. a
year, it is worth the little attention bestowed on it.
Mustard furnishes a very important, and, I believe, a paying article
of commerce, and I am satisfied would thrive with us in all our districts
if it were not for the aphis. The mustard plant belongs to the same
natural order as the cabbage plant?the Cruci/erce ?whose represen-
tatives are, without exception, so unmercifully attacked by this scourge
that I fear the mustard plant would not escape its ravages; but, as


Australia is the land of anomalies, my fear may be premature, and the
aphis may after all not do so much harm to the plant as I fear. Our
farmers should at least make some trials. The northern plains 'would
probably be well adapted for the growth of the mustard, as the plants in
too rich a soil would grow too luxuriant in their stalks and leaves. If we
consider the great quantity of mustard imported into this Colony, there is
no doubt the cultivation of the plant would pay.
Rape. ?lf I did not fear the ravages of the aphis, as rape belongs to
the same natural order as that of the mustard, I would strongly recom-
mend the culture of this most valuable oil-producing plant, as its oil
maintains high prices in the European markets, in consequence of the
crops on the Continent not being with certainty depended on, they are
often destroyed by frost or snow, which we have not to fear in South
Australia, .
Sunflower. ?The extensive culture of the sunflower, especially in
Russia and Germany is a fact. The chief profit from this plant is pro-
cured from the seed, which contains forty per cent, of a sweet oil only
second in value to the olive oil. It is now more than 200 years since this
valuable plant, a native of Peru and Mexico, was introduced into Europe;
and, strange to say, until now its valuable qualities were never brought to
account. The Russian husbandmen were the first who bestowed their
attention on the useful oil which the seeds contain. They commenced
the cultivation of the sunflower first on a small scale, planting the seeds
in nooks and corners, on the sides of walks, &c. The value of the oil
soon became known, and was more and more appreciated, so that at the
present time the cultivation of the sunflower in Russia is carried on to
such an extent that in the year 1866, more than 100,000cwt. of sunflower
oil was manufactured, the value of which was one and a-half million
roubles. The third part of this oil was exported to the Prussian port of
Stettin, where it was rapidly sold with rising prices. This export from
Russia, and the steady increase of the culture of the sunflower there,
opened the eyes of the German farmers, and they began the cultivation of
the sunflower with the same profitable result. The oil, as I have already
mentioned, is only second to the olive oil, and is not only used in house-
keeping like the former, but mostly as a lubricator for the delicate
machinery of textile fabrics which increase throughout Europe, and which
in consequence have increased the demand for the expensive olive oil.
From the stalks of the plant the Russians manufacture a valuable potash,
the residuum is used as oil-cake for fattening cattle, and the leaves of the
plant for manure. Should not this profitable culture of the sunflower in
Russia and Germany also be an inducement to our farmers to introduce
this payable branch of industry to our Colony? Climatic difficulties in
the way of the growth of the sunflower do not exist in South Australia.
We see the sunflower, with its smiling face, in our gardens, thrive most
luxuriantly in every kind of soil. The only fault that could be found with
it is that it exhausts the soil; yet this could be remedied by manure.
Would it not be desirable that experimental trials should be made this
season ? Let us begin like the Russians, and plant the seeds first in


nooks and corners; and should it succeed, cultivate it more extensively.
The result should be freely discussed in our Farmers? Clubs. It may
become in the future as profitable to South Australia as it is at the present
time to Russia and Germany; and it is to be hoped that the farmers will
give their earnest attention to this most important branch of industry.
The following extract from the new Land Act, lately brought into
operation, shows the importance attached to this industry, and the special
facilities granted to those who may intend planting olive, almond, and
other trees mentioned therein : �
Cultivation of Olives, &c.
46. If any selector shall be desirous of engaging in the cultivation of osiers, olives,
mulberries, vines, apples, pears, oranges, figs, almonds, or hops, or such other plants as
the Governor in Council may define by Proclamation in the Gazette, the planting and
cultivating in a husbandlike manner of one acre of land with any of the above trees or
plants shall, for all the purposes of this Act, he deemed to he equivalent to the cultivation
of six acres of such land as hereinbefore defined ; Provided that such cultivating be
bona fide continued and kept up to the satisfaction of the Commissioner until full
payment of the purchase-money, but not otherwise: Provided that if such selector shall
wish to grow artificial grass, as a rotation of crops, he may, every third year, plant and
cultivate lucem or artificial grass for such purpose, and in that case the planting
of three acres of land with lucern or artificial grass during such third year shall be
deemed to he equivalent to the cultivation of one acre of cereal or root crops.
Canary-Seed. ?This is another plant whose culture till now has been
entirely overlooked by our farmers, and which I am sure will thrive all
over the Colony. It is a fact to be wondered at, if we consider the
enormous prices often paid for this seed in the Colony, which not seldom
have risen to 2s. and 2s. 6d. per pound, I think the generally ruling
price?3d. to 4d. per pound?would leave the grower a fair margin for
the little trouble in cultivating it, and it is a plant which would be satisfied
with any soil and situation.
Gram, Vetches, Yellow Lupin, and Maize. ?With the exception of
oats and barley, very little attempt has been made by our farmers to grow
other grain for cattle. lam most sanguine of the profitable growth of
gram in this Colony. ?Gram? (says th e Inglewood Advertiser J ?bids
fair to be ranked among our profitable products before long. Its value
as horse-feed has long been acknowledged, and the possibility of growing
it is now beyond a doubt. Some time ago Mr. J. Roberts, who cultivates
one of those little patches of ground that dot the clearings made from the
scrub here and there, planted a few rows of this valuable East India pea,
and now he has a capital crop nearly ripe. The plants look strong and
healthy, the drought notwithstanding, and are covered with fitted
pods. On one plant, covering not over four inches of ground, no less
than 139 full-grown pods were counted.? The successful cultivation of
this plant would be great good, and the attention of farmers can be very
fairly directed towards it. The yellow lupin has for some years gained
on the Continent a high fame with the farmers; in fact, it has supplanted
the oats, vetches, and other horse-feed, as a plentiful and wholesome
fodder, in its green state as well as the seeds. The cultivation of maize
is also overlooked, which I am sure will thrive in the South profitably.
Lentils. ?This is a plant, I believe, very little known for food iu


England, but thought much of on the Continent, where it is cultivated to a
great extent as one of the most profitable crops, as it thrives well even on
stony and barren soils, and may be admirably adapted for certain districts in
our Colony. The lentil has a traditional history, not alone on the Conti-
nent, but also in Arabia, where it is grown still more extensively, being
considered as the plant used in the preparation of the dish for which
Esau sold his birthright to Jacob, as stated in the 25th chapter of Genesis.
I am glad to see, in the last number of the ? Journal of the Agricultural
Society of New South Wales,? a gentleman (R. Wynne) also recommends
the plant for extensive growing in Sydney. He says ?? I saw hundreds
of acres sown with the lentil in the neighborhood of Bethlehem. The
soil where I found the lentil flourishing with such abundant growth was
of the poorest description, and so stony that it was a wonder to me how
any kind of useful plant could thrive there at all. Having myself, as an
invalid, derived very great benefit from it in the form of Dr. Barry?s Re-
valenta, I can honestly recommend it as the most wholesome article of
diet of which I have any experience, the most essentially valuable pro-
perty of it being the facility with which it can be assimilated, and its
great power of nutrition. I need hardly say it would be a source of real
gratification to me if my humble efforts to introduce it to this country
should have succeeded in calling the attention of agriculturists and all
well-wishers of the Colony to its valuable properties as a health-restoring
food ; and I am not without hope of seeing it become one of the ordinary
products of this Colony.? The Continental people in this Colony know
its value, and large quantities of lentils are imported by our German mer-
chants.
Capers. ?There is no doubt we could produce this desirable luxury
equally well as in the southern part of Europe. In the neighborhood of
Toulon it is cultivated in the orchards in the intervals between figs and
olive-trees. As a pickle the flower-buds of the caper are in great esteem,
and form an important article of commerce throughout Europe. In the
Mediterranean the flower-buds of the caper are gathered just before they
begin to expand, which forms a daily occupation for children during six
months, when the plants are in a flowering state. As the buds are
gathered they are thrown into a cask, among as much salt and vinegar
as is sufficient to cover them, and, as the supply of capers is increased,
more vinegar is added. Wken the caper season closes the casks are
emptied, and the buds assorted according to their size and color?the
smallest and greenest being reckoned the best ?and put in smaller casks
of fresh vinegar for commerce; and in this state they will keep for five
or six years. Considering the little work the growing of this important
commercial article involves, it would be worth while for our horti-
culturists, especially in the gullies, where this plant will grow most
luxuriantly, to make the attempt to cultivate the true caper ( Capparis
spinosaj. _ .
Chicory. ?Since the introduction of this plant in the Colony it has
become in some places so prolific as to be considered a nuisance, and yet
of this we import yearly great quantities, as shown in our import returns,


viz.:?Total for the last three quarters, 54,960 lbs., say at 235. 4d. per
cwt., �629 15s. The manufacture of chicory is so simple and inexpensive,
that we might easily produce sufficient not only for our home consump-
tion, but also for that of the neighboring Colonies.
Liquobice. ?My attention has been called to the liquorice plant, Gly-
cyrrhiza glabra, Dec., on which, in perusing the last number of the
Journal of Applied Science, I found an interesting article in reference to
the consumption of this valuable commercial plant. It could be grown
here with little trouble and cost in almost any locality and soil. Accord-
ing to the above-mentioned journal, it arrives at maturity in from three
to four years, when the roots can be taken up, and the proprietor may
expect to derive some return for his outlay in rent and labor. The depth
to which these strike downwards, often equals the height of a man, and
the soil needs, therefore, to be free from stones, which cause the roots
to become crooked or warped, and thus diminish the value of the liquo-
rice as a saleable commodity. The same land will produce a continuous
crop; but then a good addition of manure is needed. The ground to be
properly prepared, must be spade-trenched to a depth of three to four
feet, and laid in ridges upon the top until the Spring; when the mould
has become pulverized, the ridges can be levelled and prepared for plant-
ing. The beds are three to four feet wide, and must be kept clean during
the summer, and about November (this in South Australia would be in
June) when the sap has descended and the tops appear yellow, the old
stems or stalks are cut off close to the ground with a sharp pruning knife,
the spaces between the roots being turned over and left rough. The
roots are usually dug up with a large three-pronged fork, and stacked in
trenches, and this stacking is effected in a dry and sheltered place, the
roots being placed upright with layers of sand between them, and a good
layer of several inches thick on the top. In this manner the stack is
preserved by the proprietor until required for market.
Osieb.?Not only does this very useful shrub keep the embankments
of rivers from falling in, but it would also give a profit to the grower,
having the advantage of giving employment to the basketmakers. I
need only mention the great number of baskets and various other osier
work yearly imported into this Colony from Europe and America. For
favorable places for its cultivation, I mention only the banks of the Onka-
paringa, the Murray Flats, and Inman Valley ; but many other localities
undoubtedly would be found.
Bkoom Millet supplies the material of a not unimportant article,
viz., American brooms, which are so much imported, and for which we
send a large sum of money away, that could be retained in the Colony, as
there is not the slightest doubt that the broom millet will grow just as
well with us as the Sorghum saccharatum does, and the skill for manu-
facturing the broom might soon be obtained. The millet will grow well
especially in the hills and the Southern Districts. It should be sown in
the latter end of August, but rather thin, so that the plants may grow
vigorous, and produce a greater development of inflorescence, which part
is used for the manufacture of the broom. This industry has already


been introduced into Victoria and New South Wales; and in the latter
Colony, especially Newcastle, the brooms are largely manufactured, and
already exported to South Australia. # .
The Esparto Grass (Macrochloa tenacissima) ?A native ot Spain,
Portugal, Greece, and North Africa. It has gained during the last few
years a great mercantile reputation in regard to the valuable fibre, not
alone for the manufacture of ropes and other articles, but as contributing
also an excellent material for the best writing paper, without any other
admixture. Thus, from the great use now made of it by the paper-
makers, it has become an essential article of import into England and
other places, and a source of wealth to the countries producing it. The
import in 1871 into England alone is considered about 140,000 tons, and
that of Esparto grass, ropes, and other articles manufactured from it,
about 19,000 tons. Notwithstanding this large importation of the raw
material for papermaking, and that the papermakers use of late a good
many other substances for papermaking not used before, the scarcity ot
material becomes more evident every day, and the consequence ts the
constant rise in the price of paper. The Gardeners? Chronicle , 15th
June, 1872, says : ?? It is with some concern that we learn that both in
Algeria and Spain, instead of mowing the Esparto grass at the proper
season, the natives pluck it up in the most reckless manner. Consul
Turner, of Cartagena, says: ?? It is very evident to all concerned that
these people are destroying the growth of the grass by their manner of
plucking it.? From the above-named port there was a falling-off during
the past year in quantity exported to the amount of 5,000 tons, which in
a great measure is to be accounted for by the present reckless systena of
collecting it. Here again is an instance of natural production being
wantonly destroyed by man, in spite of his deriving a benefit from it; we
may thus say the progress of civilization is the occasion of waste and
destruction. The value of dry Esparto grass is about �5 to �5 10s. per
ton; and it is said that, under favorable circumstances, as much as from
six to eight tons can be obtained from an acre. It grows on the poorest
soil, especially limestone or sand ; in fact, where the soil will produce no
other vegetation the Esparto grass will grow. It grows even in the sands
of the Sahara, on stony hills, and on the very brink of the coast. I have
not the slightest doubt that the grass will thrive with us, and that the
many thousands of acres of arid land, of a limestone or sandy nature,
which is scarcely fit for pasture, may, by sowing with Esparto grass,
become useful. Considering the similarity of our climate with that of
. Spain, and, in fact, the north of Africa, we have no fear that our droughts
would affect its growth?and how its introduction would, benefit South
Australia if our deserts could be changed into productive districts! lor a
long time past I have endeavored to introduce seed of this valuable grass as
an experiment, but without success. I communicated with the Botanic
Gardens and seedsmen in Europe on the subject; the answer was ? Not
obtainable, the seed is not in the trade ; the Spaniards won?t part with
it??and I had already given up the hope of obtaining any. The more
agreeably therefore was I surprised by receiving one ounce of seed fiom


Mr. Bull, of London. lam glad to say that this seed arrived in good
condition, though it is said the Spaniards, before parting with the seed,
destroys its power of germinating, to prevent its introduction into other
countries. ?My seed must have escaped such manipulation, as it has
nearly all grown, and I am now in possession of about 1,000 plants, all
of which I intend to plant out to procure as much seed as possible for
distribution next year. It is now most extensively planted in the south
of France; and it is said that no other crop will pay better, especially
considering that it will grow on the poorest soils. It is propagated by
seeds, and also by dividing the roots. The question will naturally be
asked?Suppose we succeed in growing the grass here, where shall we
find a market for it ??Our enterprising and go-ahead neighbors in Vic-
toria have already established a paper mill, and a second one is contem-
plated in Sydney; so that, if we succeed, the market for the grass is
close at hand, and I think it would even pay to export to England, as a
hydraulic press would reduce the bulk materially.
Opium.? South Australia, as far as climate and soil are concerned,
offers no difficulty to the cultivation of the poppy, as we see it thriving in
many parts of-the Colony, and probably we could produce a good sample of
the drug, Mr. G. Francis exhibited not long ago at the Agricultural
Show opium prepared by him, which was considered as fair a sample as
could be derived from the first experiment. If we consider the enormous
sum which is yearly expended in opium, and that the cultivation and.
manufacture can be undertaken by young people, it is highly desirable
that an attempt should be made to cultivate the poppy.
Cochineau. ?Every one of us is acquainted with the cochineal insect,
which produces, the splendid, valuable, and much-used dye called ? car-
mine,? and of which Mexico and the West India Islands export large
quantities every year. The trade is likewise supplied with the same
article from Brazil and East but Mexico furnishes the largest
quantity, and at the same time the finest quality. Till the year 1725,
the breeding of the cochineal insect was entirely confined to Mexico;
and the Government, with the strictest care, kept it secret; and till then
it was generally believed in Europe that the cochineal was not an insect,
but a kind of seed. In the year 1785, Theirre de Menonville, a French-
man, with the greatest danger to his life, brought a few living insects to
French Domingo, where they soon were acclimatized. During 1827 the
insect was, by Bertholet, introduced to the Canary Islands, and lately,
with the best results, in Corsica and Spain. If the insect thrives well in
Spain and Corsica, why should it not do the same in Australia? Both
kinds of the cochineal plant, Opunchta Tuna and Opuntia coccinellifera ,
which I introduced by raising from seed, grow luxuriantly in the borders
at the garden, without having had bestowed the slightest care upon them;
this gives the fact that the plant will thrive in South Australia. The
second and most important question is, how to introduce the insect. This
could be done only on living plants in so-called Wardian cases. It is
not the place to give a description of the treatment of the cochineal
insect, and the preparation of the carmine ; but to give you only one


instance of the greatness of the cochineal trade, I will mention that the
export of cochineal alone ot the Mexican Province Oaxaca, amounts to
three-fourths of a million dollars annually. Now assuming that one
pound of cochineal is worth $lO, and that 70,000 insects make a pound,
they must rear an immense quantity of insects. Not that lam sanguine
of its success in this Colony, but we should try it. It is true the dis-
covery of the splendid anoline colors have done the carmine trade some
harm; notwithstanding which, it is still a most flourishing trade.
Perfumes. ?An abler pen than mine has already drawn the attention
of the public to this one of the great industries. Mr. S. Davenport, in
his able pamphlet on the same subject, has referred to the great benefit
to be derived from this source ; and I have much pleasure in commend-
ing its perusal. If we consider that British India and Europe consume
about 150,000 gallons of handkerchief perfume yearly, and that the Eng-
lish revenue for Eau de Colonge alone is about �B,OOO a year, and that
the total revenue for imported perfumes is estimated at about �40,000,
and that one great perfume distillery at Cannes, in France, uses annually
about one hundred and forty thousand pounds of orange blossoms, twenty
thousand pounds of acacia flowers (Acacia Farnesiana), one hundred and
forty thousand pounds of rose flower leaves, thirty-two thousand pounds
of Jasmin blossoms, twenty thousand pounds of tuberoses, together with
a great many other sweet herbs, we may judge of the immense quantity
of material used for perfumes. Most of the flowers which provide the
material for perfumes grow luxuriantly withus,namely,minionette, verbena,
jasmin, rose, lavender, acacia fernesiana, heliotrope, rosemary, pepper-
mint, violets, wallflowers, laurel, and oranges, from which alone three
different scents are produced. These plants thrive probably in greater
perfection here than in any part of the world. No doubt South Australia
should be a perfume-producing country. We see flourishing here some
of the most valuable scent plants. We have the wattle, myall wood,
and other native plants, yielding valuable scents. But two things are
needed to encourage the enterprize. First ?Freedom of the still, so as
to licence distilling in vessels of less than twenty-five gallons capacity ;
and, secondly, the bond fide advertisement of a capitalist manufacturer,
that he will buy any quantity of specified flowers, leaves, roots, or plants,
at a marketable price. Then some farmers might be tempted to plant a
few acres of lavender or mint, another geraniums or rosemary, another
aniseed, whilst plantations in hedgerows, or such like places, of roses,
cassia, together with contributions from gardens, would lay the foundation
for an export trade. Then it must be also noted, that whatever the value
which the plants yield in flower, fruit, leaves, and stems, it is increased
threefold under manufacture, and this manufacture consumes other local
produce, called into existence by it, such as olive and other oils, fats,
alkalies, wheaten flour, coloring matter, pottery and glass ware, which
combine to make the farmers and the manufacturers contribute largely
to the maintenance of population and the wealth of the perfume countries.
To advance this highly remunerative industry, as I have already men-
tioned, a modification in the law of licensing stills should be made to

lona fide perfume distillers, as the present law restricts stills to a range
of capacity between 25 and 50 gallons. Perfume stills for the finer per-
fumes, are best at about 8 to 10 gallons. It is therefore to be hoped
that our legislators would take this into their earnest consideration. To
encourage the development of new industries, every facility, with respect
to distillation of perfumes, should be given, even at the sacrifice of a
small amount of revenue. To show you the value of perfumes to the
countries adapted for their production, the following table, compiled from
the publications of Piesse and Prande, and the Cornkill Magazine ,
October, 1864, may show why it is so:?

THE NORTHERN TERRITORY.
In addition to what is said in a previous chapter, giving a general out-
line of the Northern Territory, it is now my intention to state how far its
capabilities and resources may prove of advantage to colonists and the
Mother Country, in regard to its capabilities for tropical agriculture.
I will first say a few words on the great importance of my scheme
proposed to the late Government, for the establishment of a standard
experimental nursery for tropical commercial plants, at our young settle-
ment, Port Darwin. My idea is, to lay out about eighty acres of land
adapted to the growth of tropical commercial plants, so that at least plants
or cuttings may be available for cultivation by the settlers; and it would
be a matter of very considerable moment to new settlers who contemplate
tropical agriculture, to obtain from such an establishment suitable plants,
seeds, &c., at a low price, to commence with. If the grower had to im-
port his own, the delays would be great, as there would be, at least
during the first few years, little opportunity to import such plants from
other countries. The cost of such an establishment would not be great;
and, in a few years, if the Government charges a trifle for the plants,
probably the garden would pay its own expenses. I made the following
proposal to the late Government:?? Sir?l have the honor to lay before
you a scheme for forming at Port Darwin a standard experimental


nursery of tropical commercial plants, for the benefit of future colonists
who may settle there as tropical agriculturists. Of all the vegetable
products capable of being propagated within the tropics, a very large
proportion are objects of commercial value in Europe. The favorable
report of competent judges who have visited the country leaves no doubt
that Port Darwin is eminently suited to the cultivation of such produc-
tions. Having had now an opportunity of examining various soils from
the Northern Territory, I find they are very similar, and by no means
inferior, to the soils which I have received from Java, Hongkong, Ceylon,
Mauritius, and other tropical countries with which I am acquainted. I
am strongly of opinion that the soils of the Northern Territory would
prove appropriate for the same tropical productions as are cultivated
in the countries above named; and the climate may be also con-
sidered very favorable for the growth, leaving every prospect of
success for tropical agriculture. With respect to the mode with which
these objects might be usufully carried out, I would suggest that about
thirty acres of land should be selected as a standard nursery. In making
a choice of such land it would be very desirable that due regard should
be had to the variety of soil and undulating character of the country, as
suitable to the various physical requirements of the plants intended to be
cultivated. The following plants I have good reason to believe could be
cultivated with success, viz., sugar, cotton, coffee, tea, rice, cassava,
arrowroot, indigo, ginger, cardemon, nutmeg, cocoa, tobacco, maize, pep-
per, caster-oil plant, pimento, vanille, sarsaparilla, rhea or Chinese grass
plant, cocoanut palm, and many more. From the information I have
received I think that the tableland situated about thirty miles from the
coast would prove favorable for the cultivation of the chincona or quinine
tree ; the importance of which is so well'known that most of the Gover-
ments of tropical and subtropical countries are now turning their attention
to its cultivation, the demand for quinine now exceeding the supply
rendering it a matter of great consideration. I would beg to add in laying
out such a standard experimental nursery the success would greatly
depend on the ability and experience of the superintendant appointed.
It would prove highly important, if judiciously managed, to the future
settlers by enabling them to procure from such an establishment plants,
cuttings, seeds, &c., only to commence the cultivation of such as -are suit-
able to the country. As Director of this Garden I could materially assist
the carrying out of this project, as being in constant communication with
the Botanic Gardens of tropical countries, I could readily procure from
them such plants, seeds, &c., as might be required, and conveniently
forward them when the intended communication with the new settle-
ment is established.? We have the proof how important and necessary
such an establishment would be for the development of the resources of
our new Province. It would be useless to dwell upon the importance of
the cultivation of sugar and cotton, which has been the foundation
of the prosperity of many Colonies; and Ido not hesitate to say that all
kinds of cotton, from the best long staple down to the finest short staple,
might be cultivated, which would vie with the best in the world ; nor do


I hesitate to say that sugar and cotton will become in future the great
staples of Port Darwin.
But the fertility of the soil is adapted for numerous other branches of
tropical agriculture, and we may expect a safe return for the investment of
capital in the cultivation of other crops demanding less capital and less
manual labor than sugar and cotton, of which other crops I will enumer-
ate a few.
Of the cereal grains Indian corn deserves more attention than it has
hitherto received. Indian millet, which under the name of Guinea corn,
is so extensively cultivated in the West Indies, might be raised to a large?
extent. The cultivation of cocoa will be most suitable to the less wealthy
individual, as it demands so litttle labor and outlay. Alexander Humboldt
observes, in alluding to Spanish America, that cocoa plantations are
occupied by persons in humble condition, who prepare for themselves and
their children a slow but certain fortune. A single laborer is sufficient to
aid them in their plantations, and thirty thousand trees assure competence
for a generation and a half.
Of equal interest would prove the cultivation of cinnamon and nutmeg,
of which the average home consumption is estimated at one hundred and
twenty thousand pounds weight per annum. Pepper, pimento, could un-
doubtedly be cultivated with great success in Port Darwin, and form an
article of export. A rich soil in mountains, valleys, or along the banks of
rivers which are not subjected to inundations, is considered to be the
most eligible for the growth of ginger, cardamons, and turmeric.
These valuable commercial plants I am convinced will grow in marshy
situations. Also the valuable dye Indigo, which thrives so well in a moist
climate, would pay the cultivator most handsomely.
Numerous other articles might be recommended to be raised, viz.
senna and numerous species of cassia, to which genus that drug belongs;
sarsaparilla, and many other medical plants, for all of which the Northern
Territory would afford proper soil for cultivation.
Before closing I must say a few words in regard to the cultivation of the
chichona or quinine tree, for which every possible attempt should be made
at Port Darwin. It is a well-known fact that the consumption of quinine
has increased enormously, but in consequence of the wanton destruction
of the quinine tree forest in South America, the demand has exceeded
the supply during the last few years ; and any effort that can be made to
increase the supply, and thus reduce the high price, is well worthy the
attentive consideration of every one interested in alleviating the sufferings
of humanity. Thousands of people died' in the late fever in Mauritius
and East Indies for want of quinine ; they had not the means to give
the enormous prices asked for it. Probably the tree might thrive at Port
Darwin. Why should we not make the attempt to grow quinine there,
and thus become benefactors to ourselves and others ? It is well known
that most of the Governments of tropical and subtropical countries are
now turning their attention to its cultivation. About 1,000 quinine trees
have lately been planted in the Island of St. Helena, The quinine trees
do well in Mauritius, Queensland, Ceylon. Probably their cultivation
can also be successfully accomplished at Port Darwin.


The synopsis of the Flora of South Australia is mostly compiled from
the valuable work of G. Bentham andF. Mueller?s ? Flora Australiensis.?
By the constantly occurring new discoveries, especially in the central
part of South Australia, the synopsis cannot be considered quite complete.
The plants enumerated in the intra-tropical Flora have been mostly
collected by Mr. Schultz in that locality.
