PREFACE
This introduction to the Library’s bicentenary exhibition on Captain
James Cook has been prepared on behalf of the National Library Coun-
cil to honour the occasion of the unveiling, in the Library, by Her
Majesty The Queen, of a model of the Endeavour, the gift to Australia
from the Government and People of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland.
The National Library's Cook collection, some of which is exhibited
in association with this model, contains many unique items and others
of great rarity. It has been assembled over a long period, with the
generous support of donors, friends and scholars, as part of the
Library's comprehensive collecting policy relating to Australia and the
Pacific. Under this policy the Library has acquired not only printed
works, but also maps, microforms, prints and original paintings, moving
picture films, photographs, sound recordings, and important manu-
scripts. Outstanding amongst these are Cook's autograph Endeavour
journal, from which many extracts are here reproduced; his letter
books, including the secret instructions; James Burney's journal of the
second voyage, recently acquired as part of the Ferguson Collection;
and a specially bound reproduction of the manuscript journal of the
second voyage, the last mentioned being one of several gifts graciously
made to the Library by Her Majesty The Queen. All of these docu-
ments may be seen in the commemorative exhibition.
The text which follows gives a brief account of Cook’s early life and
an outline sketch of the Endeavour voyage. We hope that it will interest
Australian and overseas visitors both as a souvenir of the exhibition and
as an introduction to it.
Material in the exhibition has been chosen by the Library’s specialist
in Australian studies, Pauline Fanning, the compiler of this booklet.
Arthur Robinson has designed both the exhibition and the booklet,

Say first, what Pow’r inspir’d his dauntless breast
With scorn of danger, and inglorious rest,
To quit imperial London’s gorgeous plains,
Where, rob’d in thousand tints, bright Pleasure reigns;
In cups of summer-ice, her nectar pours,
And twines, 'mid wint’ry snows, her roseate bow’rs?
Where Beauty moves with undulating grace,
Calls the sweet blush to wanton o’er her face,
On each fond Youth her soft artillery tries,
Aims her light smile, and rolls her frolic eyes?
Anna Seward. Elegy on Captain Cook.
After its first publication in 1780 Anna Seward's Elegy on Captain Cook
appeared in a number of editions, sometimes in association with her Monody
on the death of Major Andre. Walter Scott, to whom Anna Seward
bequeathed the copyright in her literary work, commented that her elegiac
commemorations of Andre and Cook, being suited to the form and pressure
of the time, were received with great favour by the public.


COOK AS A YOUNG MAN
Life in eighteenth century England was, for some, diverting, elegant
and intellectually stimulating. Literature flourished and the industrial
arts underwent great changes. The Augustan age gave way to the
Georgian leaving the towns enriched with buildings proportioned with
classical perfection, gracious and simple houses, fine country seats sur-
rounded by great gardens and parks. Side by side with artistic and
intellectual achievements, however, there existed a parochial kind of
life, the environment in which many landed gentry and men and women
of lesser social standing lived. James Cook, for instance, as a boy and
young man, lived apart from the elegant world, and from the age of
18 until he returned from the Endeavour voyage was almost continually
at sea, having by his own claim, ‘gone through all the Stations belonging
to a Seaman, from a prentice boy in the Coal Trade to a Commander
in the Navy ... a man Zealously employed in the Service of his
Country’.
He had little opportunity and probably no inclination to enjoy the
elaborate amusements of either town or country life. James King, who
accompanied Cook on his third voyage, in describing his character said
that ‘its most distinguishing feature was, that unremitting perseverance
in the pursuit of his object, which was not only superior to the opposi-
tion of dangers, and the pressure of hardships, but even exempt from
the want of ordinary relaxation’. If Cook felt any sense of deprivation,
through spending so much of his life at sea, he rarely revealed it. How-
ever, on the day on which he safely brought the Endeavour through
Providential Channel in the Barrier Reef, he permitted himself a com-
ment on his dangerous situation: ‘such are the Vicissitudes attending
this kind of service and must always attend an unknown Navigation:
Was it not for the pleasure which naturly results to a Man from being
the first discoverer, even was it nothing more than sands and Shoals,
this service would be insuportable especialy in far distant parts, like
this, short of Provisions and almost every other necessary.’

The ancient Yorkshire town of Whitby was James Cook's home port for
the period of his service with John Walker, and in its shipyards the
Endeavour and the vessels of the second and third voyages were built.
8


The son of a country bred Scot, Cook was born at Marton-in-Cleve-
land, Yorkshire, in 1728. He attended school at the neighbouring
village of Great Ayton until he was thirteen and later found employ-
ment with a village storekeeper in Staithes. In 1746 he was apprenticed
to Mr John Walker of Whitby, the owner of a fleet of small vessels
employed in the coal trade. He went to sea immediately and for most
of the next nine years was in Walker’s service. During the worst of the
winter months when the ships were laid up and refitted he lived with
Walker, using any free time to study mathematics and the principles
of navigation. Thus did Cook embark on a career in which he formed
the ‘Ambition not only to go farther than any one had done before,
but as far as it was possible for man to go’. For his achievements in
this career he was judged by his contemporaries and by posterity as the
greatest navigator of his time.
Cook was a tall man and though good looking was, according to
David Samwell, surgeon in the Discovery, ‘plain both in address and
appearance. His head was small, his hair, which was a dark brown,
he wore tied behind. His face was full of expression, his nose exceed-
ingly well-shaped, his eyes, which were small and of a brown cast,
were quick and piercing: his eyebrows prominent, which gave his
countenance altogether an air of austerity. ... It may not be amiss
to observe, that the plate engraved by Sherwin, after a painting by
Dance, is a most excellent likeness of Captain Cook; and more to be
valued, as it is the only one I have seen that bears any resemblance
to him.’
Service in the Royal Navy
For nine years from 1746 Cook served either in colliers sailing
between Newcastle and London or in ships in the Baltic trade. In
Jane of 1755 he volunteered for the Royal Navy, joining the sixty-gun
ship Eagle, then engaged on a blockade of France, though at the time
there had been no formal declaration of war. In 1757 he was trans-
ferred to the Pembroke which was to become part of Boscawen’s
squadron for the attack on French Canada. Cook s service in North
American waters was devoted largely to sounding and charting the
St Lawrence and the areas around Newfoundland. His faithful surveys
of the difficult channel known as the Traverse were an important factor
in the success of the assault on Quebec.

Cook's sketch of Harbour Grace and Carbonere is probably the earliest of
his charts of Newfoundland. Made in the autumn of 1762 it is an excellent
example of the meticulous and painstaking work of which Cook was
capable. The hydrographic skill and assurance he acquired in Newfound-
land over the next five years enabled him to make the rapid running surveys
of the coasts of New Zealand and New South Wales with a remarkable degree
of accuracy.


King George 111, patron of the Royal Society, ensured financial backing for
several of its ventures, including the observations of the transit of Venus in
1761 and 1769. Cook, Banks and Solander were all received by him on their
return from the Endeavour voyage.
11


Appointed master of the Northumberland in 1759 Cook spent most
of the next three years perfecting his charts of the St Lawrence River
and in preparing others for the coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfound-
land. He later had the satisfaction of having his charts published,
separately in the first instance, and then collated in the North American
pilot of 1775. Commodore Lord Colville, commander-in-chief of the
North American station, in commending Cook’s work and ability to
the Admiralty, described him as ‘well qualified for the work he has
performed and for greater undertakings of the same kind’.
At the end of 1762 Cook was in England for a few months during
which time he married Elizabeth Batts. In the spring of the following
year he was again posted to North American waters and, apart from
occasional spells of home leave, remained there engaged on the survey
of Newfoundland for the next five years.
The Endeavour voyage
Edmund Halley, who was appointed astronomer royal in 1721, had
predicted that the planet Venus would pass between the sun and the
earth in 1761 and again in 1769. The observation of this phenomenon
was important to scientists in their attempts to measure the earth’s
distance from the sun. Because little success had been achieved in
observing the transit in 1761, elaborate plans were made for the next
occasion. The Royal Society of London hoped to make arrangements
for observations to be made in the south seas. King George 111
responded to the Society’s memorial for material assistance by directing
early in 1768 that the Admiralty provide a suitable Royal Navy vessel
for the proposed expedition to the Pacific. On 1 April the Royal
Society was informed that a vessel had been obtained. She was a
Whitby collier, the Earl of Pembroke, and was to be re-named the
Endeavour. In contemporary official correspondence the vessel was
often referred to as a bark. This term was then used to apply generally
to small ships and particularly to those carrying three masts without a
mizzen topsail. The Endeavour was a typical east coast collier, broad-
sterned, straight-stemmed and with no ornamental figurehead. She had
adequate space for stowing the provisions and stores needed for a long
voyage. As the ship was purchased before the command of the expedi-
tion was announced, it is not known whether Cook played any part in
her selection. From his early experience in North Sea colliers, he knew

‘I have no thoughts of making this voyage as a passenger nor in any other
capacity than having the total management of the Ship intended to be Sent.’


well their capabilities and after his return from the first Pacific voyage,
recommended their use in future explorations.
It was generally supposed that the Royal Society’s choice of observer
to the expedition would fall on Alexander Dalyrmple, later to become
hydrographer to the Admiralty, and also that he would command the
expedition. The Admiralty, however, declined to place a King’s ship
under the command of one who was not a serving officer in the Royal
Navy. Lieutenant James Cook’s appointment as commander was made
on 25 May 1768. As Dalrymple declined to join the expedition if he
were not to command it, Cook was appointed to act as observer for the
Royal Society, along with Charles Green, assistant to the astronomer
royal.
Cook was directed to use the utmost dispatch in preparing the
Endeavour for sea. She was refitted and provisioned at the Navy Yard
at Deptford. Officers and crew were appointed and Cook was instructed
to receive on board the Royal Society’s second observer, Charles Green,
together with Joseph Banks, Fellow of the Royal Society, and his suite.
Amongst those whom Banks had chosen to accompany him were the
Swedish naturalists, Daniel Carl Solander and Herman Diedrich Spor-
ing, and artists Sydney Parkinson and Alexander Buchan. The great
cabin of the ship became the workshop of Banks and his retinue.
The Endeavour left Plymouth on 25 August 1768. After calling at
Madeira for stores Cook sailed past Tenerife and thence towards the
coast of Brazil, reaching an anchorage at Rio de Janeiro on 13 Novem-
ber. Here Cook planned ‘to procure Water and other refreshments.’
He succeeded in taking on stores but the naturalists, who wished to
reside in the town during their stay and to botanize were not allowed
this liberty. The Viceroy regarded the expedition with disfavour, sus-
pected it of smuggling and, according to Cook, ‘did not believe a word
about our being bound to the Southward to Observe the transit of
Venus but look’d upon it only as an invented story to cover some other
design we must be upon’. Cook protested, in a series of memorials, at
the treatment given a King’s ship and the affront offered to him as a
naval officer. Banks added his protests, being greatly vexed at not being
permitted to move freely about on shore.
From Rio de Janeiro Cook sailed along the South American coast
to the Straits of Le Maire. He anchored off the coast of Tierra del
Fuego for several days during which time a shore party gathered wood

Secret additional instructions directing Cook to search for a southern
continent.


VIEW UP THE VALLEY WHICH GOES FROM MATAVAI BAY. William Ellis, 1777.
'Between the foot of the ridges and the sea is a border of low land sur-
rounding the whole Island, except in a few places where the ridges rise
directly from the Sea, this low land is of various breadths but no where
exceeds a mile and a half, the soil is rich and fertile being for the most
part well stocked with fruit trees and small plantations and well water'd by
a number of small rivulets of excellent water which come from the adjacent
hills.'

‘Their Hutts are made like a behive and open on one side where they have
their fire, they are made of small Sticks and cover’d with branches of trees,
long grass &c a in such a manner that they are neither proff against wind,
Hail, rain, or snow, a sufficient proff that these People must be a very
hardy race’.


and water, and Banks and Solander made an excursion into the hinter-
land. From Tierra del Fuego Cook proceeded to 60° south latitude.
While off the Flora he set the studding sails and by 13 February 1769
he had rounded it ‘without ever being brought once under our close
reefe’d Topsails since we left strait la Maire a circumstance that per-
haps never happen’d before to any Ship in those seas so much dreaded
for hard gales of wind insomuch that the doubling of Cape Horn is
thought by some to be a mighty thing'.
As Cook sailed towards Tahiti the weather became milder and, in
Banks’ words ‘ began to feel soft and comfortable like the spring in
England’. Islands were sighted and named and others identified from
the descriptions given by Samuel Wallis who had been in the Pacific
during the previous year. Osnaburg, one of Wallis’ discoveries, was
seen by Cook at first as ‘a high round Island and appears not to be
above a League in circuit, and . . . looks like a high crown’d Halt, but
when it bears north the Top is more like the roof of a House’.
Tahiti
On 11 April, Tahiti, the place selected by the Royal Society for
observing the transit of Venus, came into view, and two days later
Cook found an anchorage there in Matavai Bay. Tahiti had been
visited previously by Samuel Wallis and Louis-Antoine de Bougainville;
both found it a veritable paradise, an island of enchantment, of lush
green valleys, noble peaks, clear streams and gleaming beaches; its
people were amiable and its climate mild. In addition to its natural
beauty and attractions, it was, for practical reasons, of obvious import-
ance to voyages of discovery, being in a geographically advantageous
position for Pacific explorers who came into the ocean around Cape
Horn. Further it afforded good harbours and supplies of fresh food.
Thus it was established as a regular and welcome calling place for
seamen. For distant Europeans, Tahiti, given by Bougainville the name
‘nouvelle Cythere’, became a symbol of an idyllic and romantic south
seas island, and the Tahitian the embodiment of the noble savage.
New Zealand
Cook’s first concerns were the establishment of good relations with
the native people, and the selection of a suitable site for carrying out
the observation to be made on 3 June. When this, the primary purpose
of the voyage had been carried out, Cook visited other islands in the

Society group, and from thence proceeded, in accordance with his
secret additional instructions, to search for the continent that was
believed to lie in the South Pacific. Having reached 40° south latitude
without finding any large land mass, he turned the ship to the west
in order to fall in with New Zealand, whose western coast had been
discovered by Tasman more than a century before. In the course of
circumnavigating New Zealand Cook not only established that there
were two large islands whose coastlines he accurately charted, but also
wrote a most detailed and careful account of the country, its resources
and its native inhabitants. He judged the plains and valleys of the
North Island to be rich and fertile, and likely to be hospitable to
European plants. He believed that ‘was this Country settled by an
Industrus people they would very soon be supply’d not only with the
necessarys but many of the luxuries of life’. Cook returned to New
Zealand on each of his later voyages, making his base at Queen Char-
lotte Sound, the safe harbour in Cook Strait where, on the first voyage,
he formally took possession of the South Island in the name of the
British Crown.
The voyage home
By March, 1770 Cook had resolved to leave New Zealand ‘and to
bend my thoughts towards returning home by such a rout as might
conduce most to the advantage of the service I am upon’. He would
have preferred to return by way of Cape Horn as this route would
have provided further opportunity to prove the existence or otherwise
of a southern continent. However, this course would necessarily have
taken the ship into high latitudes. Cook judged that the ship’s con-
dition was not sound enough for such an undertaking and for the same
reason decided against proceeding directly by way of the Cape of
Good Hope especially as he could not expect to make any new dis-
covery on that course. It was decided to return by way of the East
Indies and then to proceed to the Cape of Good Hope. Cook resolved
‘upon leaving this coast to steer to the westward untill we fall in with
the East Coast of New-Holland and than to follow the deriction of
that Coast to the northward or what other direction it may take untill
we arrive at its northern extremity and if this should be found imprac-
tical than to endeavour to fall in with the lands or Islands discover’d
by Quires’.

Cook's journal entry recording the first sighting of the Australian coast.


The Australian coast sighted
In less than three weeks the Endeavour had crossed the Tasman and
in the early light of 20 April land was seen ‘extending from NE to West
at the distance of 5 or 6 Leagues having 80 fathom water a fine sandy
bottom’. Later in the morning Cook named the southernmost point of
land then in view after Lieutenant Zachary Hicks who had been the
first to sight the coastline. At noon the next day, when he was just
north of the present-day town of Merimbula, Cook recorded ‘the
weather being clear gave us an oppertunity to View the Country which
had a very agreeable and promising Aspect the land is of a moderate
height diversified with hills, ridges, planes and Vallies with some few
small lawns, but for the most part the whole was cover'd with wood,
the hills and ridges rise with a gentle slope they are not high neither
are there many off them’. The Endeavour continued northward, watch
being kept for a suitable landing place.
Landing at Botany Bay
The first attempt to land was made between the places now known
as Bulli and Bellambi Point on the south coast of New South Wales, but
the great surf beating upon the beach made a successful landing impos-
sible. The following morning Cook discovered 'a Bay which appeared
to be tollerably well sheltered from all winds’. In the afternoon, 29
April, a party including Cook, Banks, Solander and Tupia, a Tahitian
chief who accompanied Cook on the return voyage to England, set
foot on Australian soil for the first time, on the shores of Botany Bay.
The name first given to the bay was Sting-Rays Harbour, later altered
to Botanist Bay and then to Botany Bay so that the final version of the
text of Cook’s journal relating to the naming reads ‘the great quantity
of New Plants &c a M r Banks & D r Solander collected in this place
occasioned my giving it the name of Botany Bay’.
The aborigines
A little over a week was spent there making observations of the
nearby countryside and its flora and fauna. Cook’s hopes of establish-
ing friendly relations with the aborigines were not fulfilled as the latter
generally retreated at the approach of any of the ship’s company. At
the end of his stay there Cook recorded that ‘The Natives do not appear
26


‘The natives often reconnoitred us, but we could not prevail on them to
come near us or to be social; for, as soon as we advanced, they fled as
nimbly as deer, excepting at one time, when they seemed determined to face
us: then they came armed with spears, having their breasts painted white;
but, as soon as they saw our boat go off from the ship, they retreated.’
Sydney Parkinson.


to be numberous neither do they seem to live in large bodies but dis-
pers’d in small parties along by the water side, those I saw were about
as tall as Europeans of a very dark brown colour, but not black nor
had they wooly frizled hair, but black and lank much like ours’. He
was to see rather more of them during his stay at Endeavour River and
listed a vocabulary of the few words learnt there, in his general descrip-
tion of the aborigines, written after he had left the eastern coast. He
concluded this account by observing ‘From what I have said of the
Natives of New-Holland they may appear to some to be the most
wretched people upon Earth; but in reality they are far more happier
than we Europeans; being wholy unacquainted not only with the super-
fluous but the necessary Conveniences so much sought after in Europe,
they are happy in not knowing the use of them. They live in a Tran-
quillity which is not disturb’d by the Inequality of Condition: The Earth
and sea of their own accord furnishes them with all things necessary for
life; they covet not Magnificent Houses, Houshold-stuff &c a , they live
in a warm and fine Climate and enjoy a very wholsome Air, so that
they have very little need of Clothing and this they seem to be fully
sencible of for many to whome we gave Cloth &c a to, left it carlessly
upon the Sea beach and in the woods as a thing they had no manner
of use for. In short they seem’d to set no Value upon any thing we gave
them, nor would they ever part with any thing of their own for any
one article we could offer them, this in my opinion argues that they
think themselves provided with all the necessarys of Life and that they
have no superfluities.’
Charting the Australian coast
On 7 May Cook left Botany Bay ‘Having seen every thing this
place afforded we at day light in the Morning weigh’d with a light
breeze at NW and put to sea and the wind soon after coming to the
Southward we steer’d along shore NNE and at Noon we were by
observation in the Latitude of 33°50' S about 2 or 3 miles from the
land and abreast of a Bay or Harbour wherein there appear d to be safe
anchorage which I call’d Port Jackson’.
He proceeded northwards, charting the coast, naming prominent
physical features, sometimes in honour of well known Englishmen of
his time, leaving on the map names such as Port Stephens, Cape Hawke,
Keppel Bay and Cumberland Isles. Sometimes he chose terms to fit


appearance or conditions, such as Point Upright, Glass Houses, Sandy
Cape, Bustard Bay, Break Sea Spit, and sometimes, as in the case of
Cape Tribulation, Thirsty Sound, Weary Bay, Providential Channel,
and Cape Flattery his naming reflects mood and feeling towards the
circumstances of the day. From time to time he landed to examine
the country and replenish the ship’s supply of water.
Endeavour Reef
Cook kept close to the mainland and after passing Cape Capricorn
became entangled with the islands and shoals off the Queensland coast
so that he was constantly obliged to send a boat ahead, seeking a safe
channel. In spite of this care in taking soundings, when the ship was
in the vicinity of what is now known as Endeavour Reef, on the clear
moonlight night of 11 June, she ran aground. Cook described the near
disaster in detail;
‘. . . from 6 untill near 9 ©Clock we deepen’d our water from 14 to 21
fathom when all at once we fell into 12, 10 and 8 fathom at this time
I had every body at their stations to put about and come too and
anchor but in this I was not so fortunate for meeting again with deep
water 1 thought there could be no danger in stands on-before 10
oClock we had 20 and 21 fathom and continued in that depth untill a
few Minutes before oil when we had 17 and before the Man at the lead
could heave another cast the Ship Struck and stuck fast. Emmidiatly
upon this we took in all our sails hoisted out the boats and sounded
round the Ship and found that we had got upon the SE edge of a reef of
Coral rocks having in some places round the Ship 3 and 4 fathom water
and in other places not quite as many feet, and about a Ships length
from us on our starboard side (the ship laying with her head to the
NE) were 8, 10 and 12 fathom.'
The following night, the ship was floated free and the pumps were
able to control the leak that had appeared as soon as the ship had
grounded. It was further decreased the next day by fothering, an opera-
tion by which a sail spread with scraps of loose rope fibres, wool and
animal dung is lowered under the ship. If successful, as it was on this
occasion, this practice results in the various scraps being drawn into
any hole by suction, thereby plugging it. ‘This fortunate circumstance’,
wrote Cook, ‘gave new life to every one on board. It is much easier
to conceive then to discribe the satisfaction felt by every body on this


occation, but a few minutes before our utmost wishes were to get hold
of some place upon the Main or an Island to run the Ship ashore
where out of her Materials we might build a vessel to carry us to the
East Indies, no sooner were we made sensible that the outward applica-
tion to the Ships bottom had taken effect than the feild of every mans
hopes inlarged so that we now thought of nothing but rainging along
shore in search of a harbour where we could repair the damages we
had susstaind. In justice to the Ships Company I must say that no men
ever behaved better than they have done on this occasion animated by
the beheavour of every gentleman on board, every man seem’d to have
a just sence of the danger we were in and exerted himself to the very
utmost.’ Later, when the ship was beached at Endeavour River, it was
found that a piece of coral embedded in her timbers had helped to stem
the leak.
In order to lighten the ship the crew threw overboard the guns, iron
and stone ballast, casks, hoops, staves, oil jars and decayed stores.
Marker buoys were fixed to the guns, as it was intended, if the
Endeavour escaped from this awful predicament, to heave them up.
It proved impracticable to do this and, in spite of many searches, it
was not until January 1969 that the guns were again located and
extracted from beneath the coral.
Repairing the ship
Once the Endeavour had been refloated and the leak temporarily
stopped, Cook sought a harbour suitable for beaching the ship. Several
days later he found an appropriate place which he named Endeavour
River, the site of present-day Cooktown. The ship was repaired in a
little over two weeks and by 21 July Cook was ‘ready to put to sea the
first oppertunity’. Strong gales prevented him from sailing until more
than two weeks later. The six weeks spent at Endeavour River had
enabled the scientists to make detailed observations of the flora and
fauna as well as of the native inhabitants, whom they again found to be
exceedingly shy. It was here that the expedition saw a kangaroo for
the first time: ‘an animal something less then a grey hound, it was of
a Mouse Colour very slender made and swift of foot’. The creature
seen on this occasion was possibly a young Grey Kangaroo. Later a
kangaroo, probably an Eastern Wallaroo, was shot and Cook was able
to give a more detailed description. He noted that:


BEACHING AT ENDEAVOUR RIVER, JUNE 1770.
‘At 1 PM the Ship floated and we warped her into the harbour and moor’d
her along side of a Steep beach on the south side. Got the anchors Cables
and All the Hawsers a shore. In the AM made a stage from the Ship to the
shore - errected two tents one for the Sick and the other for the Stores and
Provisions landed all the empty casks and part of the Provisions and
sent a boat to haul the sene who return’d without success.’


‘The head neck and shoulders of this Animal was very small in pro-
portion to the other parts - the tail was nearly as long as the body, thick
next the rump and tapering towards the end - the fore legs were 8 Inch
long and the hind 22, its progression is by hoping or jumping 7 or 8
feet at each hop upon its hind legs only for in this it makes no use of
the fore, which seem to be only design’d for scratching in the ground
&c a , the Skin is cover'd with a short hairy fur of a dark Mouse or
Grey Colour. Excepting the head and ears which I thought was some-
thing like a Hare’s, it bears no sort of resemblance to any European
Animal I ever saw, it is said to bear much resemblance to the Gerbua
excepting in size the Gerbua being no larger than a common rat.’
From the time of leaving Endeavour River Cook was anxious to find
a passage through the shoals leading to the deeper water beyond. So
that he might get a wide view of the sea-coast he landed at Point
Lookout and also on Lizard Island where he climbed the highest hill.
From that point he could see several breaks in the reef and resolved to
seek a passage through one of them. This he succeeded in doing on
14 August, and ‘had no sooner got without the breakers than we had
no ground with 150 fathom of line and found a well growen Sea
rowling in from the SE certain signs that nither land nor shoals were
in our neighbourhood in that direction which made us quite easy at
being free’d from fears of Shoals &c a after having been intangled
among them more or less ever since the 26 th of May, in which time we
have saild 360 Leagues without ever having a Man out of the cheans
heaving the Lead when the Ship was under way, a circumstance that
I dare say never happen’d to any ship before and yet here it was
absolutely necessary. It was with great regret I was obliged to quit this
coast unexplored to its northern extremity which I thing we were not
far off, for I firmly believe that it doth not join to New Guinea, how-
ever this I hope yet to clear up being resolved to get in with the land
again as soon as I can do it with safety and the reasons I have before
assigned will I presume be thought sufficient for my haveing left it at
this time.’
He remained out of sight of land for only two days, for on the
morning of 16 August he ‘steer’d West in order to make the land being
fearfull of over shooting the Passage supposing there to be one be-
tween this land and New Guinea’.
In coming near to the reef again, they found themselves in a perilous


situation in which ‘All the dangers we had escaped were little in com-
parison of being thrown upon this Reef where the Ship must be dashed
to peices in a Moment, a Reef such as is here spoke of is scarcely
known in Europe, it is a wall of Coral Rock rising all most perpen-
dicular out of the unfathomable Ocean always over flown at high-water
generally 7 or 8 feet and dry in places at low-water, the large waves
of the vast Ocean meeting with so sudden a resistance make a most
terrible surf breaking mountains high especially as in our case when
the general trade wind blowes directly upon it.’
Torres Strait
Fortunately, a small opening was seen in the reef and after sending
Lieutenant Hicks to examine it Cook ‘immidiately resolved to try to
secure the Ship in it, narrow and dangerous as it was it seem’d to be
the only means we had of saving her as well as our selves, a light
breeze soon after sprung up at ENE which with the help of our boats
and a flood tide we soon enter’d the opening and was hurried through
in a short time by a rappid tide like a Mill race which kept us from
driving againest either side.’ He was soon able to anchor ‘in 19 fathom
a Corally & Shelly bottom happy once more to incounter those
shoals which but two days ago our utmost wishes were crowned by
geting clear of. He now resolved to keep close to the mainland so that
he might ‘determine whether or no New Guinea joins to or makes a
part of this land; this doubtfull point I had from my first coming upon
the Coast determined if possible to clear up.’
Four days later Cook rounded the northernmost point of the coast
and the following day landed on what he named Possession Island.
‘Having satisfied my self of the great Probability of a Passage thro’
which I intend going with the Ship and therefore may land no more
upon this Eastern Coast of New Holland and on the Western side I
can make no new discovery the honour of which belongs to the Dutch
Navigators but the Eastern Coast from the Latitude of 38° South down
to this place I am confident was never seen or visited by any European
before us and Notwithstand I had in the Name of His Majesty taken
possession of several places upon this coast I now once more hoisted
English Coulers and in the Name of His Majesty King George the Third
took possession of the whole Eastern Coast from the above Latitude
down to this place by the name of New South Wales, together with all


the Bays, Elarbours Rivers and Islands situate upon the said coast, after
which we fired three Volleys of small Arms which were Answerd by
the like number from the Ship.’
Cook made one more landing in Australian waters - at Booby Island.
From there, having no further doubt that an open sea lay to the west-
ward, and feeling that the ‘dangers and fatigues of the Voyage was
drawing near to an end’ he steered north so as to fall in with New
Guinea where he landed once at what is now Teluk Cook. Accom-
panied by Banks and Solander he had no sooner stepped on the beach
than he observed that the place was inhabited and before long some
sixty natives appeared from the thick wood which grew close to the
water’s edge. Believing that they could not search the country with
any degree of safety, the party returned to the ship and, as Banks wrote
in his journal ‘made sail and steerd away from this land to the No small
satisfaction of I beleive thre fourths of our company, the sick became
well and the melancholy lookd gay. The greatest part of them were
now pretty far gone with the longing for home which the Physicians
have gone so far as to esteem a disease under the name of Nostalgia;
indeed I can find hardly any body in the ship clear of its effects but
the Capt n D r Solander and myself, indeed we three have pretty constant
employment for our minds which I beleive to be the best if not the
only remedy for it.’
Passage to Batavia
The Endeavour sailed to the south of Timor, calling at the Island of
Savu, where after protracted negotiations Cook was able to trade so
that his stores might be replenished sufficiently to carry the ship to
Batavia. When the Endeavour reached Java she anchored near some
Dutch ships lying off Anger Point. Banks recorded that their Captains
proffered ‘some European news, as that the government in England were
in the utmost disorder, the people crying up and down the streets Down
with King George, King Wilkes for ever; that the Americans had refus'd
to pay taxes of any kind in consequence of which was a large force
being sent there both of sea and land forces; that the party of Polanders
who had been forc'd into the late election by the Russians interfereing
had askd assistance of the Grand Signior, who had granted it, in con-
sequence of which the Russians had sent 20 Sail of the line and a large
army by land to beseige Constantinople &c &c &c.’


On 11 October the Endeavour reached Batavia where she remained
nearly three months refitting for the last stage of the voyage. From
here Cook sent to the Admiralty, by a Dutch ship, a copy of his journal
and of his charts of the South Pacific, New Zealand and the eastern
coast of Australia. Once the ship’s overhaul was completed and the
necessary stores had been taken on the ship's company was anxious to
leave. According to Banks ‘there was not I beleive a man in the ship
but gave his utmost aid to getting up the Anchor, so compleatly tird
was every one of the unwholesome air of this place’. Seven men died
there and many more succumbed to dysentery on the voyage to the
Cape of Good Hope. These melancholy circumstances were in sad
contrast with the Endeavour’s remarkable record for the greater part
of the voyage. Up to the time when the ship reached Batavia, only five
members of her crew had been lost, four of whom met their death
through accident. The fifth, Forby Sutherland, had died of tuberculosis
at Botany Bay. By giving careful attention to a varied diet and insist-
ence on the use of fresh food whenever possible, Cook successfully
combated scurvy on all three of his voyages. His achievement in this
field was recognized by the award of the Royal Society’s Copley Medal.
At Cape Town
When Cook reached Cape Town he found that his losses from sick-
ness, by comparison with other ships then in port, were small. He noted
in his journal on 20 March 1771:
‘We find that Ships which have been little more than Twelve Months
from England have suffer'd as much or more by Sickness than we have
done who have been out near three times along, yet their sufferings
will hardly if atall be mentioned or known in England when on the
other hand those of the Endeavour, because the Voyage is uncommon,
will very probable be mentioned in every News paper, and what is not
unlikely, with many additional hardships we never experienced for
such are the disposission of men in general in these Voyages that they
are seldom content with the hardships and dangers which will naturaly
occur but they must add others which hardly ever had existence but
in their imaginations by magnifying the most trifling accidents and
Circumstances to the greatest hardships, and unsurmoutable dangers
without the imidiate interposion of Providence as if the whole Merit of
the Voyage consisted in the dangers and hardships they underwent, or


that real ones did not happen often enough to give the mind sufficient
anxiety; thus posteriety are taught to look upon these Voyages as
hazardous to the highest degree.’
He stayed in Cape Town four weeks, finding it a place where the
inhabitants ‘are in general well bred and extremely civile and polite
to all strangers, indeed it is their Intrest so to do for the whole Town
may be consider’d as one great Inn filed up for the reception of all
comers and goers-Upon the whole there is perhaps not a place in the
known World that can equal this in affording refreshments of all kinds
to Shipping.’
Cook reached St Helena, the last port of call, on 1 May 1771. He
left there three days later in company with His Majesty’s Ship Portland
and twelve sail of Indiamen.
Return to England
As they neared England, Cook spoke with several ships and from
one, a brig from Liverpool, learned that no accounts of the Endeavour
had been received in England and that wagers were held that she was
lost. Three days later Land’s End was sighted and on 12 July 1771 the
Endeavour anchored in the Downs. Cook landed the next day and went
immediately to London to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty ‘a full acco 1 - of the proceedings of the whole Voyage'. Some
weeks later he was presented to King George 111 to whom he gave a
copy of his journal. On the same occasion he received his commander’s
commission.
During the Endeavour’s three year voyage, Cook not only carried
out the primary purpose of the expedition - the observation of the
transit of Venus, but also advanced scientific knowledge of the treat-
ment of scurvy, charted with accuracy the coastline of New Zealand
and the eastern coast of Australia, and proved that a strait lay between
Australia and New Guinea. Further, he had sailed over a sufficient
area in the South Pacific to throw serious doubt upon the existence
of a great southern continent.
Since the appearance in 1771 of the first and anonymously published
account of the Endeavour voyage, the interest in Cook's achievements
and writings has been such that the journals of all three voyages have
been issued in a multitude of editions and translations.

DATING OF EVENTS AND JOURNAL ENTRIES
Dating in Cook's autograph journal is according to ship time by
which the twenty-four hour day begins at noon, twelve hours ahead of
civil time. In this present publication the dates have been computed
according to civil time. Similarly, dates for the period from the 6
October 1769 to 9 October 1770 have been adjusted to allow for the
Endeavour passing the 180 th meridian of longitude at the beginning of
this period. Cook himself did not make this adjustment until he
reached Batavia. In all the extracts quoted from the journal, Cook's
spelling and forms of abbreviation have been retained.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
