THE PREFACE,
Shewing the Use and Design of the RIDDLE .
R Bader, the following enigmatic song,
Does not to wisest nat’ralists belong ;
Their wisdom is but folly on this head ;
They here may ruminate, but cannot read.
For though they glance the words, the meaning chokes ;
They read the lines, but not the paradox.
The subject will, howe’er the phrase be blunt,
Their most acute intelligence surmount,
If with their natTal and acquir’d sight
They share not divine evangelic light.
Great wits may rouse their fancies, rack their brains,
And after all their labour lose their pains :
Their wisest comments were but witless chat,
Unapt to frame an explication pat.
No unregen’rate mortals best engines
Can right unriddle these few rugged lines ;
Nor any proper notions thereof reach,
Though sublimated to the highest stretch.
Masters of reason, plodding men of sense,
Who scorn to mortify their vain pretence,
In this mysterious deep might plod their fill;
It overtops the top of all their skill.
The more they vainly huff, and scorn to read,
The more it does their foolish wit exceed.
Let not the haughty phrase make you disprove,
The weighty matter which deserves your love.
High strains would spoil the riddle’s grand intent,
To teach the weakest, most illit’rate saint,
That Mahanaim, is his proper name ;
In whom two struggling hosts make bloody game.
That such may know, whose knowledge is but rude,
How good consists with ill, and ill with good.
That saints be neither at their worst nor best,
Too much exalted, or too much deprest.
This paradox is fitted to disclose
The skill of Zion’s friends above her foes :
To diff I hence, by light that Heav’n transmits,
Some happy fools from miserable wits.


And thus (if bless’d) it may in some degree
Make fools their wit, and wits their folly see.
Slight not the riddle then like jargon vile,
Because not garnish’d with a pompous stile.
Could th’ author act the lofty poets part,
Who make their sonnets soar on wings of art,
He on his theme had blush’d to use his skill,
And either clip his wings, or broke his quill.
Why this BNIG-HA climbs such divine heights
As scorn to be adorn’d with human flights.
These gaudy strains would lovely truth disgrace,
As purest paint deforms a comely face.
Heav’n’s mysteries are ’bove art’s ornament,
Immensely brighter than its brightest paint.
No tow’ring lit’rature could ere outwit
The plainest diction fetch’d from sacred writ;
By which mere blazing rhet’ric is outdone,
As twinkling stars are by the radiant sun.
The soaring orators, who can with ease
Strain the quitessence of hypbkboles,
And clothe the barest theme with purest dress,
Might here expiate much, yet say the less,
If wi’ th’ majestical simplicity
Of scripture-orat'ry they disagree.
These lines pretend not to affect the sky,
Content among inglorious shades to lie,
Provided sacred truth be fitly clad,
Or glorious shine ev’n through the dusky shade.
Mark then, though you should miss the gilded strain,
If they a store of golden truth contain ;
Nor under rate a jewel rare and prime,
Though wrapt up in rags of homely rhime.
Those sinners that are sanctified in part,
May read this riddle truly in their heart.
Tea, weakest saints may feel its truest sense,
Both in their sad and sweet experience.
Don’t overlook it with a rambling view,
And rash suppose it neither good nor true.
Keep then the sacred myst’ry still entire ;
To both the sides of truth do favour bear,
Not quitting one to hold the other branch ;
But passing judgment on an equal bench.
The riddle has two feet, and, were but one
But off, truth falling to the ground were gone.
’Tis all a contradiction, yet all true,
And happy truth, if verify’d in you ;
Go forward then to read the lines, but stay
To read the riddle also by the way.

Was then most angry when most pleas’d Rom. viii. 32

SECTION II
MY life’s a pleasure and a pain ; Psal. cxx 5.
A real loss, a real gain ; Philip, hi. 7.
A glorious paradise of joys,
A grievous prison of annoys,

Hence still my joys with sorrows meet, n Cor vi. 10.
And still my tears are bitter-sweet, Zech. xh. 10.


I’m cross’d, and yet have all my will;
I’m always empty, always full.
I hunger now, and thirst no more,
Yet do more eager than before.
With meat and drink indeed I’m blest.
Yet feed on hunger, drink on thirst.
My hunger brings a plenteous store,
My plenty makes me hunger more.
Strangs is the place of my abode,
I dwell at home, I dwell abroad.
I am not where all men may see,
But where I never yet could be.
I’m full of hell, yet full of heav’n ;
I’m still upright, yet still unev’n ;
Imperfect, yet a perfect saint;
I’m ever poor, yet never want.
No mortal eye sees God and lives,
Yet sight of him my soul revives.
I live best when I see most bright;
Yet live by faith and not by sight.
I’m liberal, yet have nought to spare ;
Most richly cloth’d, yet stript and bare
My stock is risen by my fall;
For, having nothing, I have all.
I’m sinful, yet I have no sin ;
All spotted o’er, yet wholly clean.
Blackness and beauty both I share,
A hellish black, and heav’nly fair.
They’re of the dev’l, who sin amain ;
But I’m of God, yet sin retain ;
This traitor vile the throne assumes,
Prevails, yet never overcomes.
I’m without guile an Ist’elite,
Yet like a guileful hypocrite ;
Maintaing truth in th’ inward part,
With falsehood rooted in my heart.
Luke xxii. 42.

Psal. xix. 12.

Matth. xv. 19.


Two masters, sure I cannot serve, Matth. vi. 24.
But must from one regardless swerve;
Yet self is for mv master known, Hos. x. 1.
And Jesus is my Lord alone.
I seek myself incessantly,
Yet daily do myself deny,
To me ’tis lawful evermore
Myself to love and to abhor.
In this vain world I live, yet see
I’m dead to it, and it to me.
My joy is endless, yet at best
Does hardly for a moment last.

SECTION 111.
THE work is great I’m called unto, Phil, ii, 12.

Were gain’d before they were begun, i Cor . xv. 57.


I’m still at ease and still opprest;
Have constant trouble, constant rest; n Cor. iv. 8.
Both clear and cloudy, free and bound; John viii. 36.
Both dead and living, lost and found. Matth. xviii. 11.
Sin for my good does work and win ; Rom. viii. 2-8.

For all my sins my heart is sad,
Since God’s dishonor’d; yet I’m glad, Psal. li. 4.

Yet he beholds no sin in me; Numb, xxiii. 21.
His mind that keeps them all in store,
Will yet remember them no more. Is. xliii. 25.
Because my sins are great, I feel
Great fears of heavy wrath; yet still Ezra ix. 13, 14.
For mercy seek, for pardon wait,
Because my sins are very great, Psal. xxv. 11,
I hope when plung’d into despair, Rom. iv, 18.
I tremble when I have no fear. Phil, if 12,
Pardons dispel my griefs and fears, Matth. ix. 2.
And yet dissolve my heart in tears, Ezek xxxvi. 25,

"I/TUCH like my heart both false and true, Jer. xvii. 9

No new thing is beneath the sun: Reel i. 9
Yet all is new, and old things gone. n Cor. v. 17
Though in my flesh dwells no good thing, Rom. vii. 18
Yet Christ in me I joyful sing.
Sin I confess, and I deny:

I sin against, and with ray will;
Col. i, 27
Rom. vii. 14-20
Rom. vii. 21-25
I’m innocent, yet guilty still. Psal. xix. 13.
Though fain I’d be the greatest saint, Psal. xxvii. 4.
lo be the least I’d be content. Psal, Ixxxiv 10
My lowness may my height evince, Job v. 11.
I’m both a beggar and a prince.
With meanest subjects I appear,
With kings a royal sceptre bear.
I’m both unfetter’d and involv’d;
I Sam. ii. 8.
Heb. i. 6
Rev. ii. 26, 27.
Psal. cxvi. 16
By law condemn’d, by law absolv’d. i John iii. 20

Though worthless I myself endite,
Rom. vh. 23
John viii. 36
Yet shall as worthy walk in white. Gen. xxxii. 10
SECTION VI.
IVT 0 creature ever could or will
■II For sin yield satisfaction full; Psal. xlix. 8
Yet justice from the creature’s hand
Both sought and got its full demand. Psal. xl. 6
Hence though I am, as well I know,
A debtor, yet I nothing owe.
My creditor has nought to say,
Yet never had I aught to pay.
He freely pardon’d ev’ry mite,
Rom. hi. 24, 25
Rom. viii. 33, 34
Rom. v. 6
Acts xiii. 38, 39
Yet would no single farthing quit. Rom . hi. 24, 25

Is dearly bought, yet wholly free. I Pet. i. 18, 19

Yet daily pardon need to crave. Psal chi. 3
The law’s arrest keeps me in awe, Psal. cxix. 120

Law-breakers ne’er its curse have miss’d ;
But I ne’er kept it, yet am bless’d. Gal. hi. 16
I can’t be justify’d by it,
And yet it can’t but me acquit.
Rom. hi. 20
Rom. viii, 1


Fm not obliged to keep it more,
Yet more oblig’d than e’er before.
By perfect doing life I find,
Yet do and live no more me bind.
These terms no change can undergo,
Yet sweetly chang’d they are ; for 10,
My doing caus’d my life, but now
My life's the cause that makes me do.
Though works of righteousness I store,
Yet righteousness of works abhor ;
For righteousness without a flaw
Is righteousness without the law.
In duties way I’m bound to lie,
Yet out of duties bound to fly :
Hence merit I renounce with shame,
Yet right to life by merit claim.
Merit of perfect righteousness
I never had, yet never miss ;
On this condition I have all,
Yet all is unconditional.
Though freest mercy I implore,
Yet I am safe on justice’s score,
Which never could the guilty free,
Yet fully clears most guilty me.

SECTION VII
MY Jesus needs not save, yet must; John x. 16
He is my hope, I am his trust. John xvii. 6
He paid the double debt, well known
To be all mine, yet all his own.
Hence, though I ne’er had more or less
Of justice-pleasing righteousness,
Yet here is one wrought to my hand,
As full as justice can demand.
Is. iiii. 4,5, 6
Rom. iii. 9, 19
Dan I ix. 24.


By this my Judge is more appeas’d
Than e’er my sin his honour’d les’d. Rom. v. 8-11
Yea, justice can’t be pleas’d so well
By all the torments borne in hell.
Full satisfaction here is such,
As hell can never yield so much ;
Though justice therefore might me damn,
Yet by more justice sav’d I am.
Heb. x. 5, 6
Rom. v. 11
I Pet. iii. 18
Here ev’ry divine property
Is to the highest set on high;
Hence God his glory would injure,
If my salvation were not sure.
My peace and safety lie in this,
My creditor my surety is.
The judgment-day I dread the less,
Rom. iii. 25
Is. xliv. 23
Psal. cxix. 122
My Judge is made my righteousness. i Cor . i. 30
He paid out for a bankrupt-crew
The debt that to himself was due ;
And satisfy’d himself for me,
When he did justice satisfy, Zech. xiii, 7
He to the law, though Lord of it,
Did most obediently submit. Gal. iv. 4, 5
What he ne’er broke, and yet must die,
I never kept, yet live must I.
The law, which him its keeper kill’d,
In me its breaker is fulfill’d ;
Yea, magnify’d and honour’d more
Than sin defac’d it e’er before.
i John iv. 9
Rom. viii. 3, 4
Is. xlii. 21
Hence, though the law condemn at large,
It can lay nothing to my charge ;
Nor find such ground to challenge me,
As Heav’n hath found to justify.
Rom. viii. 1
Job xxxiii. 24
But though he freely me remit,
I never can myself acquit.
My Judge condemns me not, 1 grant;
Yet justify myself I can’t.
ii Sam. xii. 13
Job ix. 20


From him I have a pardon got,
But yet myself I pardon not. n Cor. vii, 11
His rich forgiveness still I have,
Yet never can myself forgive. Is. xxxviii. 15
The more he’s toward me appeas’d,
The more I’m with myself displeas’d. Ezek. xvi. 63
The more I am absolv’d by him,
The more I do myself condemn. Luke xviii. 13
When he in heav’n dooms me to dwell,
Then I adjudge myself to hell;
Matth. xxv. 34
Yet still I to his judgment ’gree,
And clear him for absolving me.
Psal. li. 4
Thus he clears me, and I him clear,
I justify my Justifier.
Rom . iii. 26
Let him condemn or justify,
From all injustice I him free.
Job xxv. 4
SECTION VIII
MINE arms embrace my God, yet I, Song iii. 4
Had never arms to reach so high ; Psal. Ixi. 2
His arms alone me holds, yet 10,
I hold and will not let him go.
Psal. Ixiii. 8
Gen. xxxii. 26
I do according to his call,
And yet not I, but he does all;
i Cor. xv. 10
But though he works to will and do, Phil. ii. 13
I without force work freely too. Psal. cx. 3
His will and mine agree full well, Matth. vi. 10
Yet disagree like heav’n and hell. Matth. xxi. 28
His nature’s mine, and mine is his ; Heh ii. 14
Yet so was never that nor this. Is. xl, 17, 18
I know him and his name, yet own
He and his name can ne’er be known, Psal. ix. 10
His gracious coming makes me do;
I know he comes, yet know not how. Song iv. 16


I have no good but what he gave, iChron. xxix 14
Yet he commends the good I have. n Cor. x. 18
And though my good to him ascends, Psal. xxv. 1
My goodness to him ne’er extends. Psal. xvi. 2
I take hold of his cov’nant free, Is. Ivi. 4
But find it must take hold of me. Zech, i. 6
I’m bound to keep it, yet ’tis bail, Psal, chi. 17, 18
And bound to keep me without fail. Psal. Ixxxix. 33
The bond on my part cannot last, Psal. Ixxxix. 30
Yet on both sides stands firm and fast. Psal. Ixxxix. 2
I break my bands at ev’ry shock,
Yet never is the bargain broke,
Daily, alas ! I disobey,
Psal. Ixxviii. 37
Jam. hi. 2
Yet yield obedience every day.
I’m an imperfect perfect man,
That can do all, yet nothing can.
Psal. Ixi. 8
Psal. xxxvii. 37
Phil. iv. 13
I’m from beneath, and from above, John vhi. 23
A child of wrath, a child of love.
A stranger e’en where all me know ;
A pilgrim, yet I no where go.
I trade abroad yet stay at home;
My tabernacle is my tomb.
I can be prison’d, yet abroad ;
Rom. ix. 8

ir Cor. v. I, 2
Bound hand and foot, yet walk with God. Acts xvi. 24, 25
SECTION IX
TO tell the world my proper name,
Is both my glory and my shame : Hos. i. 9
For like my black but comely face.
My name is sin, my name is grace. Song i. 5
Most fitly I’m assimilate
To various things inanimate ;
A standing lake, a running flood, Is. xliv. 3
A fixed star, a passing cloud. Hos. vi. 4


A cake unturn’d, nor cold nor hot;
A vessel sound, a broken pot:
A rising sun, a drooping wing;
A flinty rock, a flowing spring.
A rotten beam, a virid stem ;
A menstr’ous cloth, a royal gem:
A garden barr’d, an open field;
A gliding stream, a fountain seal’d.
Of various vegetables see
A fair and lively map in me.
A fragrant rose, a noisome weed ;
A rotting, yet immortal seed.
I’m with’ring grass, and growing corn;
A pleasant plant, an irksome thorn ;
An empty vine, a fruitful tree;
An humble shrub, a cedar high.
A noxious brier, a harmless pine;
A sapless twig, a bleeding vine :
A stable fir, a pliant bush;
A noble oak, a naughty rush.
With sensitives I may compare,
While I their various natures share;
Their distinct names may justly suit,
A strange, a reasonable brute.
The sacred page my state describes
Erom volatile and reptile tribes ;
From ugly vipers, beauteous birds ;
From soaring hosts, and swinish herds.

With mounting eagles, creeping worms. Psal. xxii, 6
A mixture of each sort I am ;
A hurtful snake, a harmless lamb ; John xxi. 15
A tardy ass, a speedy roe; Prov. vi. 5
A lion bold, a tim’rous doe. Is. ii. 19


A slothful owl, a busy ant; Prov. vi. 6
A dove to mourn, a lark to chant; Song ii. 12
And with less equals to compare,
An ugly toad, an angel fair. Acts vi. 15
SECTION X.
fPEmptations breed me much annoy, Heh. xii. 11
-*• Yet divers such I count all joy. Jam. i. 2
On earth I see confusions reel, Psal. Ixxxii. 5
Yet wisdom ord’ring all things well. Rom. viii. 28
I sleep, yet have a waking ear; Song v. 2
I’m blind and deaf, yet see and hear: Is. xlii. 18, 19
Dumb, yet cry, Abba, Father , plain, Is. xxxv. 6
Born only once, yet born again. John hi. 3-6
My heart’s a mirror dim and bright, Lam. v. 17
A compound strange of day and night: Zech. xiv. 7
Of dung and di’monds, dross and gold ; Mai. ii. 3
Of summer heat, and winter cold. Luke xxiv, 32
Down like a stone I sink and dive, Psal. xlii. 6, 7
Yet daily upward soar and thrive. Psal. xlii. 8, 9
To heav’n I fly, to earth I tend ; Col. hi. 1, 2
Still better grow, yet never mend. Hos. xiv. 5
My heav’n and glory’s sure to me,
Though thereof seldom sure 1 be : John xiv. 2, 3
Yet what makes me the surer is
God is my glory, I am his. n Cor. viii. 23
My life’s expos’d to open view, Psal. xliv. 18
Yet closely hid, and known to few. Col. hi. 3
Some know my place, and whence I came,
Yet neither whence, nor where I am. John hi. 9, 10
1 live in earth, which is not odd;
But 10, I also live in God : Gal. ii. 20
A spirit without flesh and blood,
Yet with them both to yield me food. John iv. 24


I live what others live upon,
Yet live I not on bread alone ;
But food adapted to my mind,
Bare words, yet not on empty wind. Matth. iv. 4
I’m no Anthropopagite rude,
Though fed with human flesh and blood;
But live superlatively fine,
My food’s all spirit, all divine. John vi. 57, 58
I feast on fulness night and day, Is. xxv. 6
Yet pinch’d for want I pine away. Is. xli. 17
My leanness, leanness, ah ! I cry; Is. xxiv. 16
Yet fat and full of sap am I.
As all amphibious creatures do,
I live in land and water too ;
To good and evil equal bent,
I’m both a devil, and a saint.
Psal. xcii. 13

Rom. vii, 21

While some men who on earth are gods, Psal. Ixxxii. 6
Are with the God of heav’n at odds ; Psal. Ixxxii. 1, 2
My heart, where hellish legions are, Matth. xv. 19
Is with the hosts of hell at war, Eph, vi. 12
My will fulfils what’s hard to tell,
The counsel both of Heav’n and hell: Eph, ii. 3
Heav’n, without sin, will’d sin to be ; Jam. i. 13
Yet will to sin, is sin in me. Hos. v. 11
To duty seldom I adhere, Psal. cxix. 176
Yet to the end I persevere. Heh. x. 39
I die and rot beneath the clod, Psal. xc. 3
Yet live and reign as long as God. John v. 24

The everlasting Father styl’d.
Yet lately born, the virgin’s child. Matth. i. 23
Nor father he, nor mother had,
Yet full with both relations clad. Heb. vii. 3
His titles differ and accord,
As David's son, and David's Lord, Matth. xxii. 41
Through earth and hell how conqu’ring rode
The dying man, the rising God !
My nature is corruption doom’d ;
Yet, when my nature he assum’d,
He nor on him (to drink the brook)
My person nor corruption took.
Yet he assum’d my sin and guilt,
For which the noble blood was spilt.
Great was the guilt-o’erflowing flood,
The creature’s and Creator’s blood I
The Chief of chiefs amazing came,
To bear the glory and the shame ;
Annointed Chief with the oil of joy,
Crown’d Chief with thorns of sharp annoy,
Lo, in his white and ruddy face,
Roses and lilies strive for place ;
The morning star, the rising sun,
With equal speed and splendour run.
How glorious is the church’s head,
The Son of God, the woman’s seed !
How searchless is his noble clan,
The first, the last, the second man !
With equal brightness in his face,
Shines divine justice, divine grace.
The jarring glories kindly meet,
Stern vengeance, and compassion sweet.
God is a Spirit seems it odd,
To sing aloud the blood of God;
Yea, hence my peace and joy result,
And here my lasting hope is built.

The Altar, Priest, and sacrifice; Heb. xiii. 10
’His triple office ev’rything,

My daily hope does most depend
On him I daily most offend. Psal. xxv. 11
All things against me are combin’d,
Yet working for my good, I find.
I’m rich in midst of poverties,

Psal. Ixxiii. IS
Yea, all my pride gives up the ghost,

My chemistry is most exact,
Is. xlv. 24, 25
Heav’n out of hell I do extract:
This art to me a tribute brings
Of useful out of hurtful things.
I learn to draw well out of woe,
And thus to disappoint the foe ;
The thorns that in my flesh abide,
Do prick the tympany of pride.
By wounding foils the field I win,
And sin itself destroys my sin ;
My lusts break one anothers pate,
And each corruption kills its mate.
I smell the bait, I feel the harm
Of corrupt ways, and take the alarm.
I taste the bitterness of sin,
And then to relish grace begin.
I hear the fools profanely talk,

SECTION XIII
A Lump of woe affliction is,
Yet thence I borrow lumps of bliss ; Heh, xh. 11'
Though few can see a blessing in’t,
It is nay furnace and my mint. Is. xxxi. 9
Its sharpness does my lusts dispatch; Psal. xlv. 5
Its suddenness alarms my watch; Mark xiii. 35’
Its bitterness refines my taste,
And weans me from the creature’s breast. Jer. ii. 19
Its weightiness doth try my back;
That faith and patience be not slack : Jam. i. 2-4
It is a fanning wind, whereby
I am unchaff d of vanity.
A furnace to refine my grace,
A wing to lift my soul apace ;
Is, xxvh. 8, 9
Mai. iii. 3
Psal. cxliii. 9
Hence still the more I sob distrest,
The more I sing my endless rest. n Cor. iv. 16, 17
My enemies that seek my hurt,
Of all their bad designs come short; Psal. xxxiii. 10
They serve me duly to my mind,
With favours which they ne’er design’d. Gen. 1. 20
The fury of my foes make me,
Fast to my peaceful refuge flee : Psal. Iv. 23
And ev’ry persecuting elf
Does make me understand myself. n Sam. xvi. 11
Their slanders cannot work my shame, Psal. xxxi. 13
Their vile reproaches raise my name ; x Pet. iv. 14
In peace with Heav’n my soul can dwell,
Ev’n when they damn me down to hell. Numb, xxiii. 7
Their fury can’t the treaty harm, Prov. xxvi. 2
Their passion does my pity warm : i Pet. hi. 8, 9
Their madness only calms my blood ; Psal. Ixix. 12
By doing hurt, they do me good. Gen. 1. 20


They are my sordid slaves I wot;
My drudges, though they know it not: Jer. xxv. 8, 9
They act to me a kindly part,
With little kindness in their heart. Matth. v. 10, 12
They sweep my outer house when foul,
Yea, wash my inner filth of soul: Isa. iv. ,3-5
They help to purge away my blot,
For Moab is my washing-pot. Psal. lx. 8
SECTION XIV.
I Though from condemnation free,
Find such condemnables in me,
As make more heavy wrath my due
Than falls on all the damned crew. Rom. viii. 1
But though my crimes deserve the pit,
I’m no more liable to it;
Remission, seal’d with blood and death,
Secures me from deserved wrath. Gal. iii. 13
And having now a pardon free,
To hell obnoxious cannot be,
Nor to a threat anent
Paternal wrath and chastisement. i Thess. i. 10
My soul may oft be fill’d indeed
With slavish fear and hellish dread: Matth. xiv. 26
This from my unbelief does spring, Mark iv. 40
My faith speaks out some better things.
Faith sees no legal guilt again,
Though sin and its desert remain : Rom. vii. 6
Some hidden wonders hence result;
I’m full of sin, yet free of guilt; Rom. vii. 14
Guilt is the legal bond or knot,
That binds to wrath and vengeance hot; Dent, xxvii. 26
But sin may be where guilt’s away,
And guilt where sin could never stay.


Guilt without any sin has been,
As in my surety may be seen ;
The elect’s guilt upon him came,
Yet still he was the holy Lamb.
Sin without guilt may likewise be,
As may appear in pai’don’d me ;
For though my sin, alas ! does stay,
Yet pardon takes the guilt away.
Thus freed I am, yet still involv’d ;
A guilty sinner yet absolv’d :
Though pardon leave no guilt behind,
Yet sin’s desert remains 1 find.
Is. liii. 6
Rom. vii. 24
Rom. iii. 19
Rom. iv. 6-8
Guilt and demerit differ here,
Though oft their names confounded are,
I’m guilty in myself always,
Rom. vii. 13, 14
Since sin’s demexit ever stays.
Yet in my head I’m always free
From proper guilt affecting me;
Because my surety’s blood cancell’d
The bond of curses once me held.
The guilt that pardon did divorce,
From legal threat’nings drew its force ;
But sin’s desert, that lodges still,
Is drawn from sin’s intrinsic ill.
Were guilt nought else but sin’s desert.
Of pardon I’d renounce my part;
For, were I now in heav’n to dwell,
I’d own my sins deserved hell.
Rom. v. 1
Gal. iii. 10
Psal. 11. 4
Luke xv. 19
This does my highest wonder move
At matchless justifying love,
That thus secures from endless death
A wretch deserving double wrath.
Though well my black desert I know,
Yet 1 m not liable to woe;
While full and complete righteousness
Imputed for my freedom is.
Rom. vii. 24, 25
i Cor. i. 30


Hence my security from wrath
As firmly stands on Jesus’ death, Rom . v. 9
As does my title unto heav’n
Upon his great obedience giv’n. Rom. v. 17-19
The sentence Heav’n did full pronounce,
Has pardon’d all my sins at once;
And ev’n from future crimes acquit.
Before I could the facts commit, Psal. ciii. 3
I’m always in a pardon’d state
Before and after sin ; but yet,
That vainly I presume not hence,
I’m seldom pardon’d to my sense
Sin brings a vengeance on my head,
Rom. viii. 1
Psal. xxY. 11
Though from avenging wrath I’m freed. Psal. xcix. 8
And though my sins all pardon’d be,
Their pardon’s not apply’d to me. Psal. xxxv. 3
Thus though I need no pardon more,
Yet need new pardon’s ev’ry hour, Matth. vi. 12
In point of application free ;
Lord, wash anew, and pardon me.
SECTION XV.
QTrange contradictions me befal,
O I can’t believe unless I see ; John vi. 40
Yet never can believe at all,
Till once I shut the seeing eye. John xx. 29
When sight of sweet experience
Can give my faith no helping hand, Is. viii. 17
The sight of sound intelligence
Will give it ample ground to stand. Eph. i. 15-19
I walk by faith and not by sight; n Cor. v. 7
Yet knowledge does my faith resound, John ii. 11
Which cannot walk but in the light, Psal ix. 10
Ev’n when experience runs a-ground, Psal. xxvii. 14


By knowledge I discern and spy
In divine light the object shown ; 11 Cor. hi. 18
By faith I take and close apply
The glorious object as mine own. John i. 12
My faith thus stands on divine light,
Believing what it clearly sees ; Gal. i. 16
Yet faith is opposite to sight,
Trusting its ear, and not its eyes. Eph. i. 13
Faith list’ning to a sweet report,
Still comes by hearing, not by sight; Rom. x. 17
Yet it is not faith of saving sort,
But when it sees in divine light. Psal. xxxvi. 7
In fears I spend my vital breath,
In doubts I waste my passing years; Psal. Ixxvii. 3, 4
Yet still the life I live is faith,
The opposite of doubts and fears. Gal. ii. 20
’Tween clearing faith and clouding sense,
I walk in darkness and in light. Job. xxix. 1-3
I’m certain oft, when in suspense,
While sure by faith, and not by sight. I Pet. i. 8
SECTION XVI.
I. Of faith and works.
HE that in word offendeth not,
Is call’d a perfect man I wot; Jam. hi. 2
Yet he whose thoughts and deeds are bad,
The law-perfection never had. Jam. ii. 10
I am design’d a perfect soul,
Ev’n though I never kept the whole,
Nor any precept; for ’tis known, Rom. iv. 5, 6
He breaks them all that breaks but one. Jam. ii. 10
By faith I do perfection claim, Phil. iii. 9
By works I never grasp the name : Gal. ii. 16
Yet without works my faith is nought, Jam. iL 14
And thereby no perfection brought.


Works without faith will never speed,
Faith without works is wholly dead :
Yet I am justified by faith,
Which no law-works adjutant hath.
Yea, gospel-works no help can lend,
Though still they do my faith attend:
Yet faith by works is perfect made,
And by their presence justify’d.
But works with faith could never vie,
And only faith can justify :
Yet still my justifying faith
No justifying value hath.
Lo, justifying grace from heav’n
Is foreign ware, and freely giv’n:
And saving faith is well content
To be a mere recipient.
Faith’s active in my sanctity;
But here its act it will deny,
And frankly own it never went
Beyond a passive instrument.
I labour much like holy Paul;
And yet not I, but grace does all:
I try to spread my little sails,
And wait for powerful moving gales.
When pow’r’s convey’d, I work; but see,
’Tis still his pow’r that works in me.
I am an agent at his call,
Yet nothing am, for grace is all.

11. Of rewards of grace and debt.
IN all my works I still regard
The recompence of full reward; Heh. xi. 24-26
Yet such my working is withal,
I look for no reward at all. n Tim. i. 9


God’s my reward exceeding great,
No lesser heav’n than this I wait: Gen. xv. 1
But where’s the earning work so broad,
To set me up an heir of God ? Ezek. xxxvi. 32
Rewards of debt, rewards of grace,
Are opposites in ev’ry case; Rom. iv. 4
Yet sure I am, they’ll both agree
Most jointly in rewarding me. Psal. Iviii. 11
Though hell’s my just reward for sin, Rom. vi. 21
Heav’n as my just reward I’ll win. Gal. hi. 13, 14
Both these my just rewards I know,
Yet truly neither of them so.
Hell can’t in justice be my lot,
Since justice satisfaction got; Rom. hi. 25, 26
Nor heav’n injustice be my share,
Since mercy only brings me there. Rom. ix. 15, 16
Yet heav’n is mine by solemn oath,
In justice and in mercy both : Psal. Ixxxix. 35
And God in Christ is all my trust,
Because he’s merciful and just. Heh. h. 17
CONCLUSION.
HERE is the riddle, where’s the man,
Of judgment to expound ?
For masters fam’d that cannot scan.
In hr'el may be found.
John hi. 10
We justly those in wisdom’s list
Establish’d saints may call,
Whose bitter-sweet experience blest
Can clearly grasp it all.
Matth. xi. 25
Some babes in grace may mint and mar,
Yet aiming right succeed:
But strangers they in hr'el are,
I Cor. hi. 1, 2
Who not at all can read.
