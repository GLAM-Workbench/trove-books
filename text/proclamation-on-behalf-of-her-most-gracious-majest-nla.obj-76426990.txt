tend to injustice, strife, and bloodshed, and who, under the pretence of
legitimate trade and intercourse, might endanger the liberties, and

Protectorate should be established over a certain portion of such country

described in the Schedule hereunto annexed.

whensoever or howsoever acquired, within the limits of the Protectorate
hereby established, will be recognized by Her Majesty: And Ido hereby,

concern to take notice of this Proclamation.
