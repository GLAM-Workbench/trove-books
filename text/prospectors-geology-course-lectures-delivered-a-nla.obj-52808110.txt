Lectures Delivered at the
WESTERN AUSTRALIAN SCHOOL OF MINES
Kalgoorlie, December 17-20, 1946


PREFACE
By the MINING EDITOR of the
“KALGOORLIE MINER”
THE nine lectures on simple geology contained in this booklet were delivered
during the first Prospectors’ Course held in this State at the Kalgoorlie
School of Mines from December I 7 to December 20, 1946.
In the past the prospector has been regarded as a man who did not require
much scientific knowledge on his side to help him find gold. That view held
fairly well during the early days of the goldfields of this State. But at that time
gold, generally, was found on the surface. Veins were found outcropping, or
there were fairly strong clues to the existence of gold-bearing reefs in floaters
which were strewn about.
But to-day the situation has changed. The prospector has to be better
equipped with tools and transport, and he has to be armed with as much scientific
knowledge about his calling that he can absorb. He has to be a scientist in his
own manner.
Gold is harder to find. This does not mean that there is little of it left.
On the contrary, there is still plenty to be won, but it does not now lie on the
surface to confront the prospector.
These days the prospector must look for it. Often he has to look hard.
In so doing he needs to be able to recognise all the signs which will help him.
Here, definitely, a sound knowledge of elementary geology that can be applied
to the best advantage is a valuable acquisition to the prospector.
In addition, he may happen on minerals of economic value, of which
there is an abundance in this State, and it is well that he should be able to
recognise them.
That is the purpose of these lectures, and that is why the “Kalgoorlie
Miner” has reprinted them. They are intended to help the prospector recognise
the signs which experience has shown are favourable for the finding of gold and
of minerals.
The first Prospectors’ Course given by the School of Mines was a note-
worthy success. Credit is due to the Minister for Mines, Mr. W. M. Marshall,
and to his officers for the success of the course, which in itself was really an
experiment.
The hope is expressed that the experiment will develop into a common
practice. The School of Mines of this State rightly should exercise great
influence in the future finding of gold and minerals.

Basic Geology
Elementary Facts
Outlined
By B. W. Fletcher
B.Sc. (hons.), M. Aust,I.M.M.,
Director, School of Mines
Before we can deal with the
origin and formation of rocks and
minerals, it is necessary to learn
something about the earth, such
as its relationship to other heaven-
ly bodies and the probable nature
of its constitution.
If you think *6f the sun as being
the size of a soccer ball, you will
find that, by comparison, the earth
is no bigger than a pin’s head.
The earth 's 8000 miles in diameter
and if you travel completely around
the earth at the equator you will
cover over 25,000 miles.
The earth is hurtling through
space at the rate of 60,000 miles
an hour. Once in every 12 months
the earth makes a complete circle
around the sun. As the distance
between the two is 92,000,000 miles,
the earth travels nearly . 600,000,-
000 miles in one year—at the rate
of approximately 60,000 miles an
hour.
As the earth hurtles around the
sun it is also spinning on its own
axis, which runs from south to
north pole. In 24 hours it makes
one complete spin, so that a man
at the equator will travel 25,000
miles a day, or a little over 1000
miles an hour. A man who is
right at one pole will of course
remain stationary during the 24
hours, but he is, of course, still
travelling round the sun at 60,000
miles an hour
In space there is no such state
as “up” or “down.”
We refer to the earth’s strong
attractive force as “gravity” and
hence we get the terms “up” and
“down.” Something that is “up,"
if unsupported, will fall “down” to
the earth —that is, the earth at-
tracts it.
When we are dealing with rocks,
minerals and ores there are vari-
ous properties which these materi-
als possess whereby we can identify
them. One of the most important
properties is that of weight—or
specific gravity, as the scientist
expresses it.
Specific gravity is very simple.
It is merely a number which
tells us that the substance is so
many time s heavier than an equal
quantity of water.
For example, one gallon of water
weighs 10 lb. but one gallon of
quicksilver (which is used on copi-
per plates at the State battery)
weighs 142 lb. The quicksilver
thus weighs a shade more than 14
times heavier than water. To be
exact it is 14.2 times heavier (using
the decimal system) and this figure
is the specific gravity of mercury.
In all Cases water is taken as the
standard.
A few figures for various sub-
stances are:—
Iron 7.8
Lead 11.4
Gold 19
Platinum 21
Much Iron in Earth
Scientists have found that the
earth has a specific gravity of 5.6
that is, it weighs 5 6-10 heavier
than a sphere of water having the
same size.
Now the average specific gravity
of all the soil, rocks, minerals and
ores that we see around us or
down in mines is only 2.7. We are
therefore forced to believe that
deep down in the earth the
material must be very heavy—in
fact heavier than 5.6.
Meteorites (often wrongly called
falling stars) are fragments of
heavenly bodies which are thought
to be of similar material to the
earth. They strike the earth at
tremendous speed and when ex-
amined they are found to range
from glassy substances, similar to
volcanic glass, through stony typ>es
similar to some of our rocks, to
heavy metallic bodies consisting
largely of iron and nickel. This,
therefore, suggests that the earth
might have a heavy core of similar
iron nickel constitution with, of
course, a fair quantity of other
heavy substances as well.
You all know that the earth is
really a big magnet—for we use
compasses which tell us where to
find north and south. This suggests
that there must be some strongly
magnetic suostance deep down in
the earth and iron and nickel are
naturally the most highly magnetic
metals which occur on the earth.
So you see that from the high
specific gravity of the earth, its
magnetic properties and the fact
that most of the material which
comes to us from space in the form
of meteors is iron, there is quite
strong evidence to show that the
Interior of the earth contains a
large amount of iron.
Most scientists now believe that
the interior of the earth is solid.
They consider that despite the
high internal temperature, which
is Indicated by an average rise of
one degree on an ordinary ther-
mometer for every 60 ft. of depth,
the pressure must be extremely
great and would tend to keep the
material solid.
There is also other evidence
suggesting that the material is not
liquid. The sun and moon have a
tremendous pull on the oceans,
thus causing tides, and if the
earth’s interior were liquid then
the sun and moon would be con-
tinually pulling on it to such an
extent that the earth would soon
get out of shape.
Earth Changes
The earth 's constantly under-
going changes. The winds, the
rain, rivers, oceans, ice (glaciers),
animals, insects and man himself,
are all wearing down the land and
transporting soil and rocks from
one place to another. You have all
probably seen a river in flood and
will realise the amount of material
that is transported.
There is no need to tell you
what the wind does. You have
only to experience a good gold-
fields dust storm to appreciate how
much dust can be deposited on
the sideboard
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


The sea pounds on the coast, un-
dercutting cliffs; glaciers transport
huge amounts of rocky material
from high regions down to the sea
where the glacier is broken up into
icebergs. Even the rabbit makes
quite a mound around the warren.
The Golden Mile’s contribution,
though small geologically, is sub-
stantial locally and a fall of earth
underground can cause an appre-
ciable tremor in Kalgoorlie or
Boulder.
In travelling around the gold-
fields you have often looked at
the skyline and have noted the
flat-topped breakaways. These are
the remnants of an old plain or
plateau which has been almost
completely removed as a result of
the combined efforts of the wind,
temperature variation, rain, rivers,
and other agencies.
Temperature variation Is largely
responsible for the peeling off of
layers from the gently rounded
granite hummocks one sees around
Bulla Bulling and Woolgangie.
The rocks become very heated dur-
ing hot summer days and when
night sets In, the temperature
drops rapidly and the outer por-
tion of the rocks contracts much
quicker than the deeper portion
and there is thus a tendency for
the outer layer to peel off.
We have now seen the destruc-
tive work that is being carried out.
The next question is what hap-
pens to all the material that is
being worn away? Most of it
eventually finds its way to the
ocean and is deposited at the bot-
tom.
But the ocean also contributes
quite a large amount of material
of its own accord. When marine
animals and plants die their re-
mains drop to the bottom, even-
tually, and thus large deposits of
what we know as limestone are
formed.
Dust in the atmosphere, often
created by volcanoes, also settles
in the ocean and quite large de-
posits of this material have been
formed throughout geological time.
Icebergs carrying rock material
eventually melt as they drift to
warmer parts of the ocean or meet
warm currents, and their load is
thus deposited.
Local Conglomerates
Of the material carried into the
ocean by rivers, the coarse rock
fragments are deposited near the
shore and these eventually become
conglomerate.
If you stop at the Kurrawang
Hill on the Coolgardie road you
will find a pebbly rock formation
which formed in this way. Since
its formation, though, it has un-
dergone considerable changes
which we shall study later.
The largest gold deposit m the
world—the Rand—consists of con-
glomerate bands, and the gold is
in the cement which binds the
pebbles together.
The Nullagine conglomerate in
the north-west of our State is an-
other example of a conglomerate
containing gold. Even locally at
Mount Monger, a conglomerate
lode has recently been found.
However, the Kurrawang con-
glomerate is not considered of the
right age for it to contain gold,
although it is possible that some
of the pebbles might show a
colour.
Material of the coarseness of or-
dinary sand is deposited farther
from the coast than the coarse
pebbly material, and still farther
out, in deeper water, the very fine
silt and clay is dropped. These
deposits are eventually revealed as
sandstone and shale, common
rocks in all parts of the world.
They are well represented at Col-
lie, where they occur with coal
seams.
Sedimentary Rocks
We have now seen how a few
rock types were originally formed.
Later we shall trace their history
from the time of original deposi-
tion until we see them on land, in
many cases far from the sea.
Conglomerate, limestone, sand-
stone and shale are called sedi-
mentary rocks because they have
been formed in much the same
way as the sediment is deposited
at the bottom of a medicine bottle.
By shaking the bottle the solid
material becomes spread through-
out the liquid. After the bottle
has been left for some time the
sediment forms.
The conditions are very similar
in rock formation. Rivers run fast
at their source and gradually slow
down as they reach the sea. Con-
sequently all the boulders, sand,
silt and clay that is carried by the
river is gradually dropped as the
river slows up.
There are many other rock types
which are called “sedimentary,”
but some are formed in different
ways. For example, coal seams
were formed originally in lagoons,
where vegetation was very heavy,
probably under tropical condi-
tions.
The rock called “marl” and
many salt deposits were formed in
lakes. Deposits of this nature are
common in Western Australia, as
for example the gypsum deposits
of Yellowdine (used for plaster of
Paris) and the alunite deposits at
Campion (worked as a source of
potash.
Such deposits owe their origin
to the fact that water evaporates
quickly. The salts are carried into
the lake by running water during
the wet season. During the hot
summer the water evaporates and
consequently, while the deposit is
being built up every year, the
water does not remain, but goes
off into the atmosphere. (The
chemist uses the word “salt” for
a number of minerals, which in-
clude, of course, our common
salt.)
Earthquakes Help
With the constant removal of
material from high land to low
land or right to the sea, it would
seem obvious that trouble is brew-
ing. Remember we are hurtling
through space and maintaining
our spherical shape.
If you are assembling an engine
you must ensure that the flywheel
is balanced. There must be perfect
balance always when a round or
spherical body is in rapid motion,
and consequently the earth when it
is being constantly attacked by the
various ene m i e s—w in d , rain,
rivers, ice, the ocean, animals, and
so on. it must soon become un-
balanced (that is, “soon” in the
geological sense) as material is
transported from one place to
another.
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


The regaining of balance is per-
formed b y earthquakes and
volcanoes which may be regarded
as the earth’s safety valves.
Earth, movements may be gradual
or they may be violent and there
are, as you know, definite zones of
weakness in the earth where earth-
quakes occur
Volcanoes pour out their lava
dust and ashes in various parts of
the world, and at the bottom of
the sea, lava is continually creep-
ing out quietly and covering
enormous areas despite its contact
with water.
Quiet earth movements will
bring up, above sea level, many
thousands of feet of sedimentary
material that has been accumulat-
ing for millions of years. The
movements are usually gradual—
a few inches a year perhaps—but
sometimes they are abrupt. New
Islands appear from time to time
in the Pacific and others disappear.
Even at Peppermint Grove there
are raised sea beaches which show
at quite a height above sea level
the remains of marine animals in
the form of shells.
The Nullagine formation which
includes the Nullagine con-
glomerate has risen above sea
level without any tilting.
The Nullarbor plain consists
largely of limestone that was
formed at fairly great depth in the
sea.
Rocks Change
Volcanoes yield a rock which we
call an igneous rock —the term im-
plying formed by heat (Latin—
“ignis," heat).
We have seen how sedimentary
rocks are formed. They are of
fragmental origin, largely, whereas
the igneous rock comes from
within the earth’s crust and re-
presents what the earth actually
consists of deep below the surface.
The igneous rock crystallises
from a molten mass similar to
what you see being poured from
furnaces in a foundry or to the
slag from a pot in the assay of-
fice. Scientists call this molten
mass “magma.”
There are many types of igneous
rocks but the most common in
Western Australia are granite,
dolerite, porphyry and basalt.
These rocks sometimes undergo
considerable changes and the
scientist then changes their names,
for example, the quartz-bearing
type of dolerite in Kalgoorlie
which has been changed in a cer-
tain way is called quartz dolerite
greenstone.
The rock which was once a
basalt is now called calc schist
locally, where it occurs near the
ore-bodies, and amphibolite when
it is farther away and less altered.
This leads us to a third great
group ol rocks. We have had an
explanation for the origin of sedi-
mentary and igneous rocks, and
now we realise that there is a
group of rocks which have under-
gone changes, and we call this
group the metamorphic rocks —the
term meaning “change in form.”
Nature plays no favourite when
she is forced to perform large-
scale earth movements, and both
sedimentary and igneous rocks are
involved in the violent compres-
sion which turns ocean beds into
mountain ranges. The Alps and
Himalayas—the highest mountain
ranges on the earth —are made up
of rocks which were deposited in
the sea. Sedimentary rocks which
were once laid down in fairly flat
beds in the ocean now appear at
the top of mountain ranges, fold-
ed *nto queer and grotesque shapes
as a result of terrific compressive
movements.
Most of our goldfields rocks were
once involved in such a moun-
tain-forming movement, and lay-
ers which were once horizontal
now often appear as knife edges—
that is, they are now standing ver-
tical, or very nearly so. As a re-
sult of the earth movement, some
of the rocks have completely lost
all resemblance to their original
appearance and in many cases new
minerals have formed. These rocks
are metamorphic rocks, and we
shall discuss them more fully in
the next lecture.
The original mountains or moun-
tain chains which formed in this
State some 500,000,000 “ears ago
have all been worn away by the
various agencies mentioned earlier
in this lecture. What we now see
are the roots of these mountain
chains exposed in isolated out-
crops in a fairly flat plain, above
which rise a few remnants of hard
rock in the form of breakaways.
Rock-forming
Minerals
Getting Down to Earth
on Minerals Generally
By G. SPENCER COMPTON,
B.Sc., A.W.A.S.M., M.Aust.I.M.M.
The surface of the earth and
the crust consist of rocks of vari-
ous kinds, whether of granite,
basalt, soil, sandstone, or lime-
stone, etc., each kind more or less
to its own particular locality, and
often covering very wide areas.
Rocks are masses which consist
of a number of mineral particles
or crystals, all bonded together,
such as granite, dolerite, basalt
or of many particles of one chief
mineral bonded loosely or tightly
into a whole. Examples are sand,
and sandstone, consisting largely
of the mineral quartz; chalk and
limestone (of calcite); mud and
shale (of clay or kaolin).
Chemical Compound
What is a mineral? It is a
chemical compound formed by
natural causes on or within the
earth’s crust.
Chemical compounds of manu-
factured origin have a certain
and definite composition, and a
set of properties peculiar to each
compound. Each mineral in nature
has a composition which is fixed
within limits, and also a set of
characteristics determined for
each, by a knowledge of which we
can learn to recognise it when
found.
Minerals therefore have:
a. Fixed chemical composition.
b. Properties or characteristics
of a certain kind.

Of chemical elements known
there are 93. Of these, from an
average of the earth’s crust to 10
miles deep, it is found that nine
elements make up a total of 98.7
per cent.
Note the small amount of car-
bon, and yet consider the vast
coalfields of the world, and note
also chlorine, one of the con-
stituents of common salt, so wide-
spread on certain parts of the
earth’s surface. (Common salt or
halite is a simple compound of
sodium and chlorine).
The remaining 77 elements make
a total of only .76 per cent. A very
few occur in quantity greater than
.01 per cent, (or 1/100 per cent., or
one part in 10,000 parts).
Nickel is .02 per cent (2 in 10,000)
Copper is .01 per cent (1 in 10,000)
Favoured Localities
Tin, lead, silver, gold, zinc, anti-
mony, bismuth, arsenic, cobalt,
mercury, tungsten, and tantalum
are among the elements occurring
in such minor amounts, and each
makes a very, very insignificant
showing.
The point is that while some of
the substances regarded as impor-
tant to man occur in such small
amounts, when the crust is con-
sidered as a whole, yet there are
some favoured localities in which
notable amounts above, or well
above, the economic minimum
I'mits, occur, making very impor-
tant ore deposits.
The object of prospecting is to
find these favoured areas and the
' real ore deposits in them.
Rock-forming minerals are those
which make up the rock masses
of the crust.
For the purpose of -this course,
we may commence with those
which are found in the primary or
igneous rocks.
Five have been selected to form
a sufficient background for under-
standing the work of the course
(two others have been added for
convenience). A knowledge of these
minerals will assist the careful and
studious prospector in any area
in which he is located.
Essential Minerals
The minerals are:—
(1) Quartz and varieties. (Silica:
Sio2) Q,
(2) Felspar varieties. Silicate, P.
(3) Mica varieties, Silicate, M.
(4) Hornblende-Augite groups.
Silicate, H, or A.
(5) Olivine. Silicate, Ol
To which are added
(6) Chlorite. Chi.
(7) Talc. T.
Both these are silicates and may
commonly be alteration products
of 3,4, 5 above.
These minerals may be called
the essential constituents of some
of the rocks to be referred to later.
An understanding of the chief
features of minerals will be of
great assistance in learning about
rocks. They do not all occur to-
gether in any one rock. It might
be usual to find two, three or four
together making up the bulk of
any rock, e., granite—felspar,
quartz and mica: basalt—felspar
and augite with perhaps olivine.
A chlorite schist contains chiefly
chlorite and a talc schist contains
much talc. A quartzite contains
much quartz
Accessory Minerals
While one says that the bulk
of a rock is made up (say 90-98 per
cent.) of several essential minerals,
it should be nbted that the remain-
ing 2 to 10 per cent will consist
of some minerals in very minor
amount. These could be called
accessory minerals.
In the case of granite, quartz,
felspar and mica are the essentials.
Some iron oxides (haematite
magnetite) and others are acces-
sory.
Chlorite schist, while containing
essentially chlorite, may contain
some magnetite (as at Mt. Mon-
ger).
Quartz-dolerite of the Boulder
belt contains small but easily
visible particles of the mineral
ilmenite (titanic-iron oxide) as an
accessory.
These seven minerals (except;
quartz which is a quite simple
oxide of silicon called silica) are
rather complex in composition
(called silicates). They will be
seen in the more or less new or
fresh rock as of large outcrops, or
in cuttings, quarries, tunnels,
r .ines where the opening is deep
enough to penetrate the outer
or oxidised zone or the surface
soil.
But as soon as they are exposed
at or near the surface (down, say
100 ft.) the rocks are subjected to
processes of disintegration (the
mineral grains separate) and their
minerals to decomposition, and as
a result materials of very simple
composition such as quartz, clay,
iron oxides (of various kinds),
carbonates and soluble compounds
mav be formed.
Weathering Changes
Some of the altered material
may be transported (by wind, run-
ning water, etc.) and deposited as
soils, clays, sands, etc., to form the
secondary rocks or sediments.
Quartz (silica—Sio2) is a simple
compound—oxide of silicon, and
very stable on the surface or
near to it, and permanent.
Felspar tends to alter slowly to
clay matter some quartz and
soluble carbonate substances as
a result of “weathering.”
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


Hornblende-augite may become al-
tered at first to chlorite, then to
clay matter and various oxides
of iron as well as carbonates.
The “clay” in the oxidised zone
ovei hornblende rocks will be
coloured according to the par-
ticular kind and amount of iron
oxides —yellowish, brown, red,
etc
Clay, carbonates, oxides of iron
are also stable and more or less
Tmanent materials on the sur-
face or in the oxidised zone.
Quartz and the alteration pro-
ducts of felspars would be white,
or nearly white, in colour, and thus
the formation of clean white or
pale-coloured sands and white
clays is readily understood. But if
the rock contained much horn-
blende-augite, or chlorite, or some
black mica (biotite), the clay mat-
ter formed will contain a con-
siderable amount of iron oxide and
so appear yellowish, brown, dark
brown, or red, etc., because iron
oxides are very efficient staining
or colouring agents in soils, or
generally in the surface and oxi-
dised zones of the crust.
The most important constituents
of the oxidised rocks of the near-
surface zone are quartz clay mat-
ter, carbonates, and iron oxides.
Iron oxides are produced in con-
siderable quantity in the oxidised
zones over lodes and reefs where
such contain sulphides or iron
(such as pyrite, pyrrhotite, arseno-
pyrlte, chalcopyrite). Therefore
oxidised lode matter will be found
to vary throughout stages from
heavy black or brown “ironstone”
with coloured clay matter, to
coloured clay matter with only a
little iron oxide.
Three Rock Groups
What Makes Up Our
Earth’s Crust
By R. W. Fletcher
B.Sc (hons.), M.Aust.,I.M.M.,
Director, School of Mines
All the minerals, ores and rocks
on the earth’s surface were of
igneous origin in the first place—
that is, they came from the earth’s
interior. However, the action of
air and water has caused quite a
large amount of breaking up of the
original products and a building up
of other new products.
For example, the original igne-
ous rock may be broken up into
soil. Some material is removed
and, combined with certain sub-
stances in air and water, may be
deposited elsewhere. Salt, gypsum
and alunite deposits are formed
in this way.
In the first lecture on rocks we
discussed the formation of the
three rock groups—sedimentary,
igneous and metamorphic. We
shall now deal with each in turn
Sediments Form
If you shake up a mixture of
sand and clay in a large bottle and
allow it to settle, you will find
that the coarse sand forms at the
bottom first; finer sand is laid on
top of the coarse, and finally clay
is deposited.
A similar sorting is carried out
by running water, and rivers in
flood may carry a large amount of
material. Large boulders will be
rolled along the bottom, whilst
sand and clay will be carried in
the body of the water itself.
If there is a change in the speed
(or velocity) of the river, the
boulders may cease to be rolled.
If the speed slackens appreciably,
sand may be deposited. When move-
ment practically ceases the clay
will settle,
This can be seen ‘in the Swan
River at various places. Up in the
hills between Northam and Upper
Swan you will see many boulders
in the Swan River (called the Avon
up there); where the river flows
through Perth you will find sand
and mud.
Conditions Govern Beds
During the summer months the
river is sluggish and clay will form
on top of the sand.
When in flood the Swan carries
much material down to its wide
flood plain which extends from
Guildford to Fremantle. In flood
time there is thus much sand de-
posited.
Next winter when the rains first
set in the river is again flooded
and sand will be dropped once
more—this time on cop oi the
clay.
There will thus be various layers
formed —a layer consisting of sand
grading into clay or mud —each
layer representing one flood
season.
The same gradation occurs in
the sea, for when the river meets
the sea there is usually a slowing
up. This can be seen in river
deltas where material is deposited
in the form of sand or mud flats.
The layers formed as a result
of varying conditions are called
“beds,” and the surface of one bed
upon which another rests is called
a “bedding plane.” If the water is
still, and shows little variation over
a long period of time, a bed which
is formed from the fine clay or
mud may be quite thick. Beds
may therefore be very thin or very
thick, depending upon the condi-
tions under which they are formed.
The term “fragmental” is used
to describe sedimentary rocks that
are formed from pieces, no matter
how large or small, of other rocks.
Of the fragmental rocks, those laid
down in rivers and the sea are the
most common.
Beds which are sandy in nature
are, when consolidated, called
“sandstones.” “Shale” is the name
given to a rock which shows much
banding and is formed from fine
clay or mud If there is no band-
ing this rock is referred to as sand-
stone.
Coarse, pebbly rocks are known
as “conglomerate.”
Nature’s Cement
If you examine the mud dredged
out of the Swan River you will
notice that after it has been ex-
posed to the weather for some time
it becomes quite hard. If you are
picknicking at Peppermint Grove
you will notice the hard rocky
shell beds above the water level.
There is thus nearly always present
some type of cement whereby the
material becomes solid when it is
raised above water level.
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


There is also another important
factor—the pressure of overlying
beds. A bed that is many feet
below the top one bears a great
deal of weight and this tends to
help cementation when the whole
formation is raised above sea level
and the water is either squeezed
out or evaporates into the atmos-
phere.
Of other types of fragmental
rocks the most important are those
of volcanic origin, which consist
of coarse, angular rock fragments
embedded in finer-grained cement,
as well as some volcanic ash and
dust beds. Such rocks are the
result of accumulations of frag-
mental material blown with explo-
sive force from a volcano.
Sedimentary rocks which have
been formed by chemical and
organic processes are described
briefly in the notes and we have
not the time to deal with them
in greater detail.
Liquid Rocks
In the first lecture we gave
several reasons why we now think
that the earth is solid. However,
throughout geological history we-
find repeated evidence of the
formation of igneous rocks from
the molten material we call
“magma.”
Most scientists now believe that
the molten material does not come
from deep down in the earth’s
interior. There is quite a lot of
evidence to show that igneous
rocks are the result of local liquify-
ing of magma just below the crust
of rocks. This crust is perhaps
1000 miles in thickness. Below it
is the heavier material.
Generally, the earth’s Interior
is kept solid by intense pressure,
but when pressure is locally
relieved due to earth movements,
some of the solid material is con-
verted to liquid and may move
from one place to another, some
of it finding its way to the sur-
face, where it pours out as lava.
Two Groups
Material that does not reach the
surface may push aside huge thick-
nesses of sedimentary rocks which
may be crumpled by compression
or may be eaten into by the molten
magma.
Rocks which form from magma
at comparatively great depths are
called “plutonic” rocks. They in-
clude granite and gabbro.
Rocks that are formed at the
earth’s surface are generally known
as “volcanic” rocks but this term
is not quite correct for many of
these surface-formed igneous rocks
do not form by volcanic action.
There is in fact quite a large group
formed by magma issuing from
numerous fissures.
The term “extrusive” should
thus be applied to the rocks we
commonly call “volcanic.” Rhyo-
lite, andesite and basalt are the
most common volcanic rocks.
Intrusive Dykes
Between the two large groups—
plutonic and volcanic —there is
another group called “intrusive.”
These represent fissure-fillings
which we call “dykes.”
Typical dyke rocks are aplite,
pegmatite, porphyry, porphyrite
and dolerite. The first two—
aplite and pegmatite—are gene-
rally deep seated dyke rocks and
they are frequently found in
granite. Dolerite also occurs largely
in granite in this State, but por-
phyry and porphyrite are usually
found intruding (or cutting
through) sedimentary and volcanic
rocks.
The Golden Mile porphyry in-
trudes altered dolerite and altered
sedimentary rocks.
Intrusive rocks that push their
way between the bedding planes
of sedimentary rocks are called
“sills.”
If sedimentary rocks are arched
up so that a mushroom-like intru-
sion is formed the name “lacco-
lith” is given to the intrusion.
Some geologists think that the
Kalgoorlie younger greenstone was
a laccolith of quartz dolerite origi-
nally.
Bock Changes
The word metamorphic means
“changed in form,” and meta-
morphic rocks are those that have
formed through the agencies of
pressure, heat and the chemical
action of liquids and gases. The
original rocks may have been sedi-
mentary or igneous, but as a result
of these agencies changes have
been produced in mineral composi-
tion or in the appearance of the
rocks or in both.
Commonly, all agencies—pres-
sure, heat and chemical action —
work together, and it is sometimes
difficult to decide which particular
agency has been the strongest in
altering the original rock.
The changes produced may only
be slight or they may go to the ex-
treme —which is complete mineral
change and complete structural
change.
Schists Difficult
In some of the schists we see
about the goldfields to-day there
is at first sight hardly a clue to
indicate what the rock was origi-
nally. It is only by careful and
observant field work, combined
with work in the laboratory, that
we are able to give the history of
our rock formations.
Generally, conglomerates, sand-
stones and shales are rocks which
do preserve some of their original
characteristics when altered by one
or more of the agencies of heat,
pressure and chemical alteration.
Even after the most severe treat-
ment, a conglomerate will always
show that it was a pebbly rock
originally.
On the other hand, some of the
rocks which once consisted largely
of felspar and minerals of the
hornblende group, may be com-
pletely tranformed into new rocks.
Such rocks, when extremely
weathered, may completely defy
all attempts to unravel theii
history.
Quartz Unchangeable
Limestones are rocks which can
be changed far beyond recognition
if all agencies—heat, pressure and
chemical action —are in operation.
If heat alone is responsible for the
change, the limestone is merely
converted to marble, but once
pressure and chemical action are
brought strongly into play, many
new minerals appear and the lime-
stone also loses its structural
features.
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


Some original minerals are very
easily changed by just the slightest
amount of heat, pressure or chemi-
cal action. Minerals of the fel-
spar and hornblende groups are
amongst these.
On the other hand, quartz is a
mineral that defies any attempt
to change it, and consequently a
very sandy rock still keeps its

No Hit-or-Miss
Occupation
Prospecting Has Become
a Science
By R. W. FLETCHER,
B.Sc.(turns.), M. Aust., I.M.M.
Our goldfields have been well
covered by prospectors over the last
50 to 60 years, and the old methods
of prospecting now need to be re-
original composition and becomes
quartzite.
Heat and pressure on a pure
sandstone merely produces, a more
compact binding and the original
grains of quartz thus become
tightly interlocked
A few common changes that
occur by metamorphism are:—
vised if the present day prospector
is to be successful.
Practically every outcrop has
been knapped at some time or
other. The old prospector automa-
tically examined all high ground
for outcrops and he knapped every-
thing that looked at all favourable.
In fact, he has knapped many out-
crops which did not even look
favourable. He could never take
chances as he was continually
building up. his knowledge of
favourable and unfavourable coun-
try and doing it the hard way, too.
He knew full well that the old
quartz-school prospector from Vic-
toria missed many a schist lode
in the early days because it wa§
considered that quartz was the
only favourable rock. He also
profited by the mistakes of mining
companies, which were. In the
middle nineties, unaware that gold
could be present in a formation and
yet not show a colour in the dish.
Even in Kalgoorlle 11 oz. ore, rich
in telluride, didn’t show a speck of
gold.
Science and Experience
The game has thus become
harder. The country has been well
covered: the tricks of the trade are
now fairly well known and the
present-day prospector must now
be prepared to combine scientific
knowledge with practical experi-
ence if he is to be at all successful.
In the past nearly every prospec-
tor has had the gold “bug.” He
has probably passed over deposits
of valuable minerals which he has
ignored in his untiring search for
gold. With the present demand
for useful minerals, the prospector
to-day must have a fairly thorough
knowledge of all minerals so that
his search must be fully produc-
tive.
If he finds no gold he should at
least be able to tell whether any
other valuable minerals are
present in the outcrops he
examines, and also whether such
minerals occur in sufficient quan-
tity to warrant a closer investiga-
tion.
During the war years, when there
was a great demand for strategic
minerals, prospectors were sending
in to the School of Mines for
mineral determination every black
mineral discovered. Among these
were pieces of tourmaline, magne-
tite and ilmenite —all worthless,
and particularly so when occurring
in small quantity—and the pros-
pector is therefore advised to study
these minerals carefully so that his
time will not be wasted on value-
less investigations.
Help Available
The prospector of to-day is there-
fore advised to set aside a little
of his time during the general ex-
emption period every year for the
purpose of study. This course you
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


are attending is a systematic effort
by the Mines Department to assist
you in your search for gold and
other minerals. We hope to give
you the rudiments of geology, to
show you how rocks and minerals
are formed and to help you in
your field identification of them.
After you have examined many
rocks and minerals in our collec-
tion you should be able, with the
help of these notes, to identify a
few of them when you come across
them during your search.
Next year you should take a re-
fresher course. Come along to the
school and go over the course
again; learn a little more about
minerals so that eventually you
will build up a pretty solid back-
ground in mineralogy.
If you are in Kalgoorlle during
the year, the School of Mines
staff will be glad to assist you in
your spare time by giving more de-
tailed information concerning
minerals and rocks. If you cannot
get in, send your specimens by post
for confirmation of your field
determinations.
The next important thing to do
is to equip yourself with the tools
of trade. The pick and shovel and
hand drill must be used in the
right place but before you use
them there is a lot of other work
to be done.
Books Important
You must carry with you, for
constant reference, several books
and they should be read often. With
the notes issued to you on this
course you should also have the
following:—
“Hints to Prospectors,” price 1/.
“Mineral Resources of Western
Australia,” price 1/.
“Prospecting for Gold by the
Loaming System,” S. J. Cash.
These books are your principal
tools of trade and you must use
them Intelligently.
Prospecting is not a mere aim-
less wandering over many square
miles of country. It must be sys-
tematic. You choose a particular
goldfield and you narrow your
search down to a particular part
of it.
Before you set out you must
learn all you can about this gold-
field. Mines Department reports
and bulletins are sold at very small
cost and you are advised to obtain
all literature that is available which
deals with your particular section.
Officers of the Geological Survey
may also be able to tell you what
are regarded as favourable belts
of country. The production of the
various mines and small shows can
also be obtained from the Mines
Department.
You therefore start on your
search knowing what rocks and
minerals you expect to find; you
have the geological maps showing
the belts of different rocks and
you must learn what rock associa-
tions in the district are favourable.
Learn Characteristics
Having properly equipped your-
self for the job (see “Hints to
Prospectors”) you should visit
mines and shows in your district
that are producing, and become
acquainted with the rock types,
rock and mineral associations and
rock structures. Prospectors gene-
rally are very co-operative and will
welcome such visits from genuine
fellow-prospectors.
You might learn, for example,
that the gold is in a type of green-
stone alongside a porphyry dyke.
You will therefore examine both
rock types and note carefully their
mineral and structural features.
You will see how the gold occurs
and what it registers in the dish.
Find out, if you can, how the fire
assay compares with the dish.
Wherever you go examine the
mullock dumps and see if there are
a few pices of ore left in the pad-
dock Become fully acquainted
with the ore and the country along-
side it.
If you find an abandoned show
that you feel like having a “crack”
at, after you have pegged it out, try
to get into the mining registrar
and get the history of the show. If
you see many large mullock dumps
around the various shafts and pot
holes, and you find that the pro-
duction from the show is fairly
small, you will realise that a lot
of work has been done for little
return.
Sample Carefully
You will of course pan off a lot
of the dump material but you
must remember that some gold
lodes show little in the dish but
assay well, whereas others show
much and assay poor.
It will therefore pay you to take
a sample carefully, quarter it down,
and send one half for assay and
pan the other half. This will give
you some idea of what the dish
shows. It is always a good idea
to check every now and then the
dish with the fire assay. If you
do this you won’t mislead yourself
too much, provided of course you
can “tell” gold in the dish.
There are so many minerals that
look like gold and you must not
be fooled by lead chromate and
other heavy minerals, similar in
appearance to gold, which give a
tail where the gold should be.
Buy yourself a hand-lens so that
you can examine minerals care-
fully, and if you are in doubt,
roast your tail (the one in the
dish) to see if any change occurs.
Watch District Features
Each district has its own par-
ticular features as regards rock
type and structure.
The Boogardie ridge at Mt. Mag-
net consists of banded quartzite,
steeply inclined, and it is in the
small quartz-filled cross “breaks”
that the prospector gets his dab.
In the Nevoria-Burbidge area
similar banded quartzites (often
called “jasper bars”) are standing
practically on end and are well
folded. Gold occurs on some of
the large folds.
In the Coolgardie district, the
new finds are in folded sedimentary
and Igneous rocks which are as-
sociated with porphyry similarly
folded. Frequently the gold occurs
in the mica-actinolite schist right
on the edge of a folded porphyry
dyke, or a little distance away from
it.
The Youanmi gold lodes were in
a fairly narrow zone in greenstone
adjacent to a large granite out-
crop.
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


Quartz reefs are, of course, Im-
portant and must be well pros-
pected. The quartz reefs of the
Murchison district and Norseman
need no further comment. Some
have been highly prospected.
These then are a few of the signs
—contact of one rock with another,
particularly granite - greenstone
contacts; folds in the country with
a “make” right in the fold; at the
edge of porphyry dykes, particular-
ly where folding occurs; “breaks”
in the so called jasper bars; quartz
reefs.
Learning Important
Of course it is often impossible
to get good outcrops, but frequently
there are a few scattered boulders
which give a clue to the nature of
the underlying rock and which may
also give some indication of change
in strike of such underlying rock.
The porphyry dykes in the Cool-
gardle district are well worth trac-
ing even if you can only do so by
toiiowing a curved path marked oy
a few scattered boulders.
Once you have found what you
think to be a favourable spot, learn-
ing will do the rest.
When learning, remember that
low-lying areas may contain a
thick accumulation of material that
has been washed down from all
around the country. Learning here
is generally useless as the gold may
have come from a long way away
and from any direction.
Of course these flats may prove
worthy of dry blowing if there is
sufficient gold present, but your
chances of striking a lode may be
pretty remote unless there are
near-by hills which could have
shed the gold. In such cases It is
advisable to loam up the small
waterways towards the top of the
hills.
Loamlng is well covered in Cash’s
book “Prospecting for Oold by the
Coaming System."
Work Systematically
Once you have struck gold and
pegged your P.A. the next thing is
to work your show systematically.
Invariably you sink a pothole, note
the strike of the country, the thick-
ness of the overburden and, if it
is not too thick, you costeen across
the lode channel at intervals. V
your first strike is a good one you
sink a shaft immediately and fol-
low the values down.
Many prospectors go astray when
they get a good trial in the dish
and start to open up. They become
so fascinated with the wonderful
prospect that they frequently ignore
the fact that whilst the gold may
be in a little stringer, or several
narrow stringers, a lot of worthless
or low-grade material is going into
the paddock. Very few prospectors
sample their show systematically.
“Fines” Misleading
Cut samples across the lode are
easy to take if the lode is fairly
soft and oxidised, but if it is hard
then '-.ampling is difficult, is not
always reliable and takes up a
lot of time The best sample is
a “grab” from the kibble.
Every kibble of dirt put into
the paddock should be sampled
by scooping from the top of the
filled kibble a double handful of
coarse and fine dirt which can be
stored in a fracteur box.
“Pines” alone should be avoided
as mining practice has shown
that the “fines” invariably carry
the high values.
After every 200 kibbles, say, the
sample should be broken up on a
flat sheet to J in. maximum size
and successively quartered down
until 2 lb. samples are finally ob-
tained. One sample should be
sent for assay and the other dol-
lied down screened and panned
off.
When panning off. alwavs try to
keep your sample of uniform size
—even measuring it with an
empty Jam tin if necessary. It
should also be screened. Thus you
will be able to compare fairly ac-
curately your dish assay with the
fire assay.
Keep a tally of your kibbles for
both tonnage and values so that
when von crush vou will have a
good Idea of what vou are likely
to get.
Beware of Free Gold
Some prospectors delude them-
selves by selecting at frequent
intervals a lump of high grade
ore, showing free gold, which they
send for assay. This practice is
very foolish and likely to cause
eventual disappointment..
Ore showing much free gold
should never be assayed. In fact,
any sample showing free gold
should not be especially picked
out for assay. The grab sample,
if taken regularly and impar-
tially is the only one that can be
relied on.
Even with the grab sample there
is often a tendency for the sample
to assay higher than what the
mill will show. This is due to the
fact that there is a preponderance
of “fines" in a grab sample. Limit-
ed as it is in size, only small pieces
of solid rock can be Included in
such a sample scooped out by
hand.
However, if taken conscientious-
ly, the grab should not be too far
out when the crushing goes
through and you will then be able
to get some idea of the difference
between what the ore samples and
what it actually carries.
You shouid now have some idea
of the scientific aspect of prospect-
ing. From the old prospector you
should be able to learn some use-
ful “wrinkles” as to methods of
prospecting, and rock and mineral
associations, but you must be par-
ticularly careful in accepting
superstitions or theories founded
on pure ignorance.
You should always be observant
and endeavour to reconcile what
you see with what you have learnt
in this course and what you will
learn if you regard prospecting as
a science and not a hit or miss,
roving sort of occupation.
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


Sulphide and Ore
Minerals
They are Often Pointers
to Gold
By G. Spencer Compton,
B.Sc., A.W.A.S.M., M.Aust.I.M.M.
Knowledge of a few sulphide or
other ore minerals would satisfy
most requirements of prospectors
in this State. Those that have
been included and published in the
course booklet are those likely to
be of the most importance, or of
the most usual occurrence, and
knowledge of them should be very
helpful.
The group formed by pyrite,
pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and arseno-
pyrite is the first simple set for
study.
Pyrrhotite is Sulphide of Iron.
Chalcopyrite (copper pyrites) is
Sulphide of Copper.
Arsenopyrite is Sulphide of Iron
and Arsenic.
It will be noticed that each one
of these contains iron, and so dark
brown to light brown, yellow or
red weathered products (oxides of
iron) will be expected in the oxi-
dised zone.
A lode or reef which contained
any of these minerals as a chief
constituent would almost certainly
show the possible presence of sul-
phides at lower levels by the iron
oxide stainings seen in or near the
outcrops.
The copper mineral (chalco-
pyrite) may also produce irregular
streaks and patches, or even lumps
and masses of the green carbonate
(malachite) or the blue carbonate
(azurite).
Noting blue and green streaks,
etc., in the upper zones, a prospec-
tor may be sure that a copper
mineral exists in his lode lower
down.
Pyrite
Usually pyrite Is light brassy-
coloured, fairly hard and mode-
rately tough. It may occur in very
large masses along, or closely mix-
ed with other sulphides. With
chalcopyrite, it makes up rich cop-
per ore).
It also occurs in easily recog-
nised crystals, often cubic, with
fine markings in lines on the faces,
or in small irregular grains, fairly
evenly and regularly scattered
through the mass.
In gold ores in this State, pyrite
is the most usual mineral.
Throughout the State it is regard-
ed as being associated with gold
values, and is considered a favour-
able mineral.
Usually the pyrite is more
favourably viewed when the par-
ticles are of small size. Coarse
crystals and lumps are not thought
of so favourably. But this (some-
times valuable) indication cannot
be regarded as an unfailing rule.
Matters must be judged on merits.
Pyrrhotite
This mineral is somewhat
darker, duller and more bronzy
than pyrite, and more brittle, and
the broken pieces quite strongly
magnetic.
It is of outstanding importance
in the great nickel deposits and
copper deposits of the world.
In gold ores in this State
pyrrhotite has come to be recog-
nised as of more importance than
was thought formerly.
It is a mineral common in Cool-
gardie ores (below water level),
an<j at Menzies (Lady Shenton
and First Hit), Ora Banda and
Mt. Magnet.
In the case of some ores at
Ora Banda the sulphides pyrite
and pyrrhotite have been sepa-
rated and more gold found to be
carried in the pyrrhotite than in
the pyrite.
Chalcopyrite
This resembles pyrite, but is
often a brighter yellow colour (like
gold, and quite difficult to dis-
tinguish from gold) It can be re-
cognised readily by the fact that
it can be scratched quite easily,
leaving a dirty green softish pow-
der alongside the scratch.
It is most important as a copper
ore mineral, and occurs freely in
the great copper localities.
In this State it is found in
quantity at Ravensthorpe. In gold
lodes or veins it is found at Roth-
say, Gabanintha, Mt. Ida, Paris
Group and Widgiemooltha.
It must be regarded as a quite
favourable mineral to occur with
gold in lodes or reefs, but the
presence of copper may present
some difficulties in extraction.
The copper shows in the upper
workings by green-blue stainings
(carbonates of copper).
It seems a pity that there could
not be evolved in this State for
some few ores such as contain cop-
per (or bismuth, lead and anti-
mony) a simple process of concen-
tration and straking to recover a
proportion of the copper (or other >
sulphide in the ore.
Arsenopyrite
This is the chief mineral lor
the production of arsenic oxide
(white arsenic). Wiluna (A. Victor
Leggo and Co,) has been a major
and regular producer for some
years, but in the future it may be
necessary to plan for a change.
In this State arsenic in quan-
tity is possible from Randalls,
Evanston and Spargo’s. Arsenic
was obtained from the Transvaal,
or old Jupiter, in the Yilgarn
Goldfield, until the lode cut out.
At Randalls the mineral is found
in rather large crystals and masses
(up to three-quarters of an inch)
of a tin-white colour, with stria-
tions on the faces clearly visible.
At Spargo’s the crystals are
smaller, but the markings are quite
distinct.
At Wiluna the mineral occurs as
very bright but tiny needles.
The mineral may alter readily by
tarnishing, and by decomposition
become broken dull material, al-
most sooty in appearance, soiling
the fingers readily on handling.
Those familiar with arsenopyrite
know of these changes which are
possible in the upper zones of
lodes.
Arsenopyrite should be regarded
more generally as a mineral in
lodes favourable for gold values.
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


One thinks of it as a mineral
often connected with higher tempe-
ratures in the ore vein than
normal, or perhaps as associated
with vapours, which penetrated
into the fracture channels or lode
formation and helped to make the
lode and carry the values.
In the auriferous areas of the
State arsenical pyrites seem to be
associated so commonly with gold
values. Apart from the localities al-
ready mentioned, It occurs in the
lode formations at Meekatharra, at
Lochinvar (Paddington), at the
Yellowdine and at the Phoenix
(Bayley’s, Coolgardie).
Galena
This is a common ore of lead,
and plentiful in masses of very
great size and in some of the im-
portant lead mines" of the world.
It is a soft, grey, heavy mineral,
readily recognised by the ready
tendency to break into small cubes
or rectangular masses —the surfaces
of fresh fractures often being ex-
ceedingly bright and lustrous.
In normal occurrences lead ores
contain a certain amount of silver
—silver-lead ores, as at Broken Hill,
where ore assays above 15 oz. of
silver a ton.
The lead ores at Northampton
have produced some very high-
grade lead ore, with concentrates
up to 80 per cent, lead, but the
silver content is very low.
In view of the prices being re-
ceived for silver, returns to mine-
owners by inclusion of this metal
should be borne in mind:—
Silver
September, 1945 ... 25Jd. an ounce
September, 1946 ... 44d. an ounce
October, 1946 55id. an ounce
Galena occurs in small quantity
in some gold ores, as in the Yil-
garn Goldfield, Norseman (Mara-
roa) and Menzies. A little dark
grey mineral in the ore may be
seen easily, is liked and looked for,
and, when found and followed,
usually indicates something above
the average in values.
In the upper zone the galena
may have disappeared, and in its
place a heavy whitish mineral
(anglesite—the sulphate of lead)
may remain. Or cerussite (carbon-
ate) may be formed. These are both
heavy, and may remain in the tail
when the dish is being used and
so obscure gold values.
Crocoite (chromate of lead) is a
mineral in oxidised ores which fre-
quently appears to delude pros-
pectors. It should be red in
masses, but when powdered and
finely divided it is yellow. In the
dish it forms a definite yellow tail.
Chromate of lead can be distin-
guished from gold by the applica-
tion of diluted spirits of salts, or
muriatic acid.
Sphalerite
Sphalerite, or Black Jack (zinc
sulphide) is an ore of zinc and
commonly occurs with galena
(lead) ores.
In gold ores it is relatively un-
important, and occurs merely
sporadically.
To find sphalerite alone or as a
sole sulphide mineral would be
rare.
Sometimes the mineral is black,
almost like galena, or it may vary
to a honey-coloured or resinous-
looking mass with a very good
clean fracture, and very brittle.
Stibnite
Antimony sulphide is a soft
heavy ore of antimony, which is
so soft as to soil the fingers readily
on handling.
In this State this mineral is of
Importance in only three places—
Moonlight (Wiluna), Youanmi
(stibnite is associated with some
very nice gold values) and Blue
Spec (Nullagine). •
Antimony does increase the diffi-
culties of extraction of the gold.
The full value of the antimony
would be desirable in concentrates,
in which case the concentrate
should be shipped “gold free.”
In the oxidised zones oxides of
antimony may appear—heavy,
whitish or yellowish—and they
may tend to hang back in the
prospector’s dish. Care should be
exercised in examining the tail for
gold in such cases.
Molybdenite
Sulphide of molybdenum is a
soft, greenish-grey, greasy-looklng
mineral often in soft flakes, plates
or scales of various sizes. It is very
soft, easily cut and easily marks or
soils the fingers.
The mineral is known in some
large granite masses or in the
veins which occur in the granite
(as at Mt. Mulgine, near Warrie-
dar).
World production of the metal
molybdenum before the war (1939)
was about 10,000 tons a year, 90
per cent of which was from the
United States of America.
Comparison of the powder-colour
(streak) with that made by
graphite should be made.
Cinnabar
This mineral —s ulphide of
mercury—has a reddish or purplish
red. vermilion, or cochineal 'colour,
and thus should be recognised
easily.
It has not been reported in this
State up to the present, but if
found a deposit obviously would be
regarded as of considerable value.
Scheelite
This is a white (or pale colour-
ed) and heavy ore (tungstate of
calcium). A piece of the pure
mineral or a piece of ore contain-
ing it will be found to be heavy
above the average.
Barite (sulphate of barium),
anglesite (sulphate of lead) and
cerussite (carbonate of lead) are
also heavy and might lead to
some confusion.
Scheelite can be detected readily
with the “mineralight.” Under the
violet light of the mineralight,
scheelite exhibits a very distinctive
white glow, and is readily detected.
The mineral has been produced
with some regularity at the Edna
May, Westonia. It occurs also in
some quantity at Comet Vale, with
quartz masses or in irregular
masses of dark green actinolite
rock at Mt. Monger and at
Higginsville.
Tungsten and tungsten minerals
are in high demand both in peace
and war Pre-war annual pro-
duction of 60 per cent mineral was
about 36,000 tons.

Folds Faults
Important
New Coolgardie Finds
in Arches of Folds
By B. VV. FLETCHER.
B.Sc. (hons.), M. Aust. I.M.M.
Surface features and under-
ground workings can all be repre-
sented on paper in the form of
plans and sections drawn to a
.suitable scale.
A plan is what you see when you
look down at anything. If you are
looking vertically down at a
table all you will see is the rect-
angular top. You cannot see the
legs or the underneath construc-
tion. Similarly, a lease plan shows
the boundaries of the lease, the
line of lode and rock boundaries
(if outcrops are sufficient to enable
such to be established) and the
positions of shafts, costeens, pot-
holes, open cuts, surface plant, etc.
“The plan also Indicates the direc-
tion of true or magnetic north.
Two other types of drawing are
necessary to give a full picture of
what is below or above the surface.
A cross (or transverse) section is
at right angles to the line of lode
and shows, in a particular place,
all vertical openings, the width of
the lode from the surface down-
wards, and the nature of the sur-
face, which might be flat, hilly or
in the form of a depression.
A longitudinal section is usually
taken lengthwise through the lode
and shows all the , vertical and
horizontal workings along the line
■of lode from the surface down-
wards.
About Contour Lines
A plan can be made to incor-
porate all the features shown in
an ordinary plan, longitudinal and
■cross sections. Contour lines on a
plan show the configuration of the
surface and will give a true picture
•of all surface features such as
flats hills, ridges and valleys.
A contour line is a line drawn
through points of equal height and
a common basis to work on is that
of drawing the contour lines at
100 ft. intervals. Sea level may be
taken as zero and the contours
would thus be drawn at intervals
of 100 ft., 200 ft., 300 ft. (and so
on) above sea level, a group of
concentric rings will represent a
hill or basin depending upon
whether the height becomes greater
from the outermost to the inner-
most circle or vice versa.
If you join the ends of a piece
of string. 2 ft. in length, and
draw the string tight between the
index finger of each hand, you will
obtain the shape of a contour
which represents a ridge. Several
such contour lines shown one in-
side the other will give you the
steepness of the ridge. If the
lines are far apart the ridge has
a fairly gentle slope in cross
section; if the lines are close to-
gether there is a steep slope. Cliff
faces will show the lines almost
superimposed over each other.
In very flat country the contour
interval may be only 10 ft., but
in steep alpine country a contour
map may show the contours at 500
ft. or more apart.
Perfectly flat beds of sediment-
ary rock would show an outcrop
on a plan which would follow
exactly the contour lines. How-
ever, it is rare to And truly hori-
zontal beds of sedimentary rocks.
Most are tilted to some degree and
we use the term “dip” to indicate
that the beds are tilted.
The direction showing the maxi-
mum angle of tilting is called the
direction of true dip and the angle
is measured from the horizontal.
At right angles to the direction
of true dip we have the “strike” of
the beds—that is, the line a bed-
ding makes with the horizontal.
Strike and dip will be dealt with
more fully when we come to a con-
sideration of folding.
Two Structural Features
The.-e are two types of struc-
tural features which we can see in
rocks Tne first is called “primary”
.— meaning that the rock formed
with this particular type of struc-
ture. The second is known as
“secondary,” and this means that
the structure has developed since
the rock formed.
The most important of the
primary structures in sedimen-
tary rocks is bedding, which has,
been fully described in a previous
lecture.
Glacial Action
True bedding is in the form of
parallel layers but there is also
another type, called “cross” bed-
ding, in which the bedding planes
show marked changes of direc-
tion —as many as three or four dif-
ferent directions being seen in an
exposure of a few square feet.
Cross bedding develops as the re-
sult of changing conditions during
the formation of the deposit.
Sand dunes, formed by wind
action, show this type of bedding
quite well. An excellent example
can be seen in the steep cliff
faces of Mt. Eliza (Perth) as you
drive around Mount’s Bay road.
Structures caused by glacial
action are well-defined and easily
interpreted. As the glacier (vir-
tually a river of ice) travels over
large rocky formations, all the
boulders it has embedded in its icy
floor will scratch or score the
underlying rock. This scoring
action produces what we call
“striations.” Striated boulders of
glacial origin can be seen strewn
around the station property of
Nangetty in the Irwin River dis-
trict.
The ripple marks we see on sea
beaches are sometimes preserved
in sedimentary formations whilst
the sun-cracked sand and mud
deposits of dried-up lakes may
likewise be carefully preserved,
with, of course, a probable filling
in of the cracks with some other
material.
Unconformities Important
One of the most important struc-
tures to be seen in sedimentary
rocks is called an “unconformity.”
After a formation of rocks has
been laid down in the sea and the
formation has been raised above
sea level, sometimes with tilting,
it is attacked by all the surface
agencies such as wind, rain and
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


running water. In time the for-
mation is well worn away and the
outcrop may present a very rough
picture of hills and valleys. Hard
beds will resist weathering but
soft rocks will wear rapidly. If
earth movements then cause a
lowering of the land and the for-
mation again falls below sea level
a new formation of rocks will com-
mence to form.
The irregular contact between
the two formations is an uncon-
formity and it usually indicates a
break or lapse in time between the
formation of the first and second
formations.
An unconformity can also occur
by submarine tilting without any
interruption of deposition. Sub-
marine land-slides may also pro-
duce an unconformity.
in the Pilbara district there is
a very fine example of an uncon-
formity between the ore-bearing
rocks of a highly folded and altered
series (called the Mosquito Creek
series) and a much younger for-
mation, which is almost horizon-
tally bedded (Nullagine forma-
tion) The lapse in time here is
regarded as being of very long
duration as mountain-forming
movements occurred between the
deposition of the two rock forma-
tions.
Unconformities are undesirable
structures in coal country, for a
seam may be followed for some
distance and then cut out abruptly
when the worn surface of the
whole formation is reached.
Granite Masses
Some of the primary structures
of igneous rock masses have al-
ready been described. These in-
clude the common intrusions —
dykes, sills and laccoliths. There
are, of course many types of in-
trusion and various names are
given to them. For our purposes
they are not important.
So far we have not dealt with
the large granite masses that
occur throughout the world —
which are particularly well seen in
this State. Some scientists believe
that much of the old pressure-al-
tered granite on the earth repre-
sents part of the original crust.
They think there is no granite
magma, and that if the large
masses we see to-day are not rem-
nants of the original crust, they
at least represent material of the
original crust that has been deeply
buried, re-melted and re-injected
into the overyling rocks.
In this State we see many types
of granite, some of which may be
part of the original crust. A large
amount, however, seems to be the
re-injected type, whilst there are
other large masses, originally con-
sisting of highly folded sedi-
mentary rocks, which have been
replaced by granite material.
The name “batholith” has been
given to large granite masses.
One very important type of in-
trusion—comparatively r a r e—i s
called a ‘pipe.” The De Beers
diamond mine in South Africa is
in k pipe of igneous rock which
contained'originally much olivine.
Coolgardie Pillow Structure
Basalt—the dark, basic form of
lava flow—produces two well mark-
ed structures one of which is very
important on the goldfields.
Columnar structure —t he well
known structure of the Giant’s
C a u s e w a y—consists of long
hexagonal columns, tightly packed
together and arranged at right
angles to the thickness of the flow.
The structure is exposed in the
South-West of the State at
Bunbury and other places.
Pillow structure is one you should
all know and there is an excellent
exposure in The Gorge at Cool-
gardie (on the west side of the
Norseman road about two or three
miles from Coolgardie). Pillows, in
cross section, have an elliptical
shape and they generally range in
size from about 9 in. to 2 ft. across.
The pillows are packed fairly
closely together and the spaces be-
tween them are filled with dark
fragmental material.
The structure occurs in the calc-
schists at Kalgoorlie as well as the
country rocks of Wiluna.
Another special type of structure
is called “vesicular.” This consists
of numerous air-cavities, mostly
almond-shaped and usually smaller
than a quarter of an inch across.
on the surface layer of lava flows,
The cavities were caused through,
escaping gases. Sometimes they are-
filled, at a later stage, with material
deposited from hot solutions.
“Pumice” is the light frothy
layer which forms on some lava
flows, and "obsidian” is a volcanic
glass composed largely, if not-
almost entirely, of silica.
There are other primary
structures in igneous rocks but-
those already described are the
most important.
Folding and Faulting
Secondary structures have been,
developed since the rock formed,
and they will be briefly described
under the headings folding, fault-
ing and jointing.
Although we use the expression
“solid as a rock,” it must be real-
ised that under terrific pressure-
huge thicknesses of rock can be
made to crumple up and rupture.
Where crumpling occurs without
any rupture the term “folding” is
applied: rupture, with displacement
of one side relative to the other, is
called “faulting.”
Evidence of folding can be seen
almost everywhere on our gold-
fields. The Bell Bird mine, at Cool-
gardie, is an excellent sample of
very intense folding within the
limits of a 12-acre lease.
Folds range from microscopic size
up to huge structures covering
many hundreds of square miles.
Simple Fold
The simplest type of fold is like
one corrugation on a sheet of cor-
rugated iron. There is a ridge which
in cross section shows an arch. This
is called an “anticline.” The trough
is referred to as a ‘ syncline.”
If you lay the sheet of iron flat
on level ground, and lengthwise
north and south, the north-south
line running through the top of
the arch will be horizontal. This
line is called the "axis” of the fold.
(The term is not quite correct, but
is common usage.)
If you lift the south end of the
sheet of iron waist-high the axis is
said to “pitch” north. The angle of
pitch is measured from the hori-
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


•zontal. The curved faces of the cor-
rugations, which join the top of the
arches to the bottom of the trough,
are known as “limbs.” In our
example the limbs would be refer-
red to as the east and west limbs,
respectively.
The angle of pitch is very im-
portant, for there are many types
of lode which make enrichments
at the arch oi a fold, and by fol-
lowing the pitch down you should
keep on ore. The saddle reefs cf
Bendigo are good examples of such
ore bodies, and some of the most
recent Coolgardie “finds” are in
fold arches.
Folding can be simple, as already
described, or it may be very com-
plicated, as seen in Alpine struc-
tures. It takes place mainly in sedi-
mentary formations, which may
contain dykes, sills or lava flows. It
is probable that many of the Cool-
gardie porphyries, which follow the
“country,” were formed as sills.
Folds and Bock Change
In this State there are many
areas of folded rocks, and the
most common rock types in the
goldfields that have been folded
are sandstones, shales, lava flows,’
tuffs, sills and dykes of porphyry
and other intrusive rocks.
As folding involves movement
it is quite common to find that
many of the goldfields rocks have
been changed in structure and
mineral composition, and are now
actually metamorphic rocks.
Sandstones have become quartz-
ites; shales have changed to
schists and slates; basaltic lavas
may now be hornblende-, chlorite-
or calc-schists but quite often the
original pillow structure is main-
tained.
Local folding may lepresent only
a small section of major structure
and it is only by the systematic
field mapping of large areas,
where outcrops may be fairly
scattered, that the geologist is able
to work out the major structure
of the district. Strike and dip
readings of recognised folding
sedimentary beds, are taken in
Isolated exposures, and each read-
ing forms a link in the interpre-
tations of the whole structure.
One exposure may show the bed-
ding planes of the rock and the
angle of tilting. The strike of one
bedding plane should be normally
the same as that of another bed-
ding plane and it is accepted with
certain reservations, as being typi-
cal of the whole formation.
The strike is the direction th '
bedding plane makes with the hori-
zontal It you follow a flatly clip-
ping outcrop up a steep hill you
will get a false idea of the strike.
The true strike is what you see
only if the country is perfectly
flat. You must therefore make
due allowance for the dip of the
bed and the changing height of
the country before you can get
the true strike.
The direction of true dip is at
right angles to the true strike
direction.
Crossfolds Important
Of recent years it has been
proved that changes of strike, dip
and pitch are important features
in ore-deposition.
Cross-folding, at right angles, or
nearly so, to the longitudinal fold-
ing is regarded as a favourable
structure.
Reverting to our original model
—the sheet of corrugated iron—if
you were to corrugate this again
at right angles to the direction of
original corrugation you would
produce a series of cross folds, the
limbs of the cross folds being
roughly parallel to the repeatedly
changing pitch of the first folds.
Cross folds are usually weaker
structures than the major longi-
tudinal folds, but nevertheless
they are largely responsible for
the changes in pitch of the major
folds, and where such changes
occur ore bodies may be found.
In re-mapping the Coolgardie
district the geological survey
geologists have drawn attention
to the cross-folded zones, and
careful prospecting has been very
successful up to date.
Another excellent example of
cross-folding is in the Yllgam
goldfield. A large anticline, limbs
of which in the form of banded
quartzite, are exposed at South-
ern Cross and a little east of
Yellowdine, has been cross-folded
between Nevoria and Burbidge
From the railway south to Nevoria
the major anticline pitches south
until it reaches the synclinal cross
fold. It there meets the northerly
pitching axis of the southern part
of the major fold.
When interpreting pitching
anticlines or synclines shown in
plan it is well to remember that
in an anticline the beds dip out-
ward and the pitch is towards the
crest of the curved outcrop as
shown in plan. If the structure is
a syncline the beds dip in, and
the pitch is away from the crest.
There is one type of folded
structure that needs particular
care in its interpretation. “Iso-
clinal” folds show the same dip
on both limbs of the anticline or
syncline. The beds have been
tightly folded in such a manner
that the innermost beds have been
very compressed whilst the outer
beds have been folded parallel to
each other. The sequence of beds
in cross section will usually show
whether this structure prevails.
Whole books are written alone
on folding. We have briefly touch-
ed on some of the more important
aspects which are particularly ap-
plicable to geology in this State.
Cause of Faults
When a rock mass is subjected
to great pressure it may fracture,
and one side of the fracture will
move relative to the other This
is called faulting
Like an inclined bedding plane,
a fault has a strike and a dip
which is measured In the same
way as you measure the bedding
plane
Faults may result from compres-
sion (pressure applied inwards
from both sides, thus causing a
bed to be faulted back over itself),
or from tension, in which case
there is a pulling apart effect and
the faulted bed will slide down and
away from its other part. This is
called a “normal” fault whereas
the compressional type Is re-
ferred to as a “reverse” faulting.
In both types ‘step-faulting” or
“block-faulting” can take place,
and the total displacement is thus
shared by a number of parallel
fault planes.
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


Faults do not extend indefinitely.
They may gradually fade away to
end in a slight fold, or they may
be pivoted.
If you cut through a circular
sponge cake from the centre out-
wards and then raise the cake on
one side of the cut, you will pro-
duce an effect similar to a pivotal
fault.
If instead of raising the half of
the sponge cake you push it in-
wards towards the centre you will
produce another effect, which we
see at times in faulted rocks.
In the case of the lifting of the
sponge the faulting is vertical and
gradually dies away as the centre is
approached. In the other case the
movement is lateral, with a simi-
larly gradual decrease in displace-
ment towards the centre.
What to Look For
Faults are not always clear-cut,
plane surfaces Faults with curved
plane surfaces are quite common,
and one often sees underground a
fault plane with a corrugated sur-
face.
Sometimes when you are follow-
ing a lode underground you find
the lode cuts out suddenly. This
may be due to folding (the lode
taking a right-angled turn), fault-
ing, or to an igneous intrusion
which cuts across the lode.
The place where the lode cuts
out should be carefully examined
for signs of movement, change in
strike of bedding or shear planes
or for a new type of igneous rock.
Faults can usually be recognised
if you carefully read the signs. A
fault will always show a fracture.
Smooth polished walls or greasy
heads (known as "slickensides”) are
indications of a fault. Gouge or fine
clay may be present between the
wails. This is produced by grind-
ing action. Brecciated rock is some-
times present in a “fault zone.”
Fine striations or grooves may show
up on the smooth fault plane, the
direction of the striations indi-
cating the direction of movement.
If your lode is definitely faulted
vou will have to explore in one of
two directions to get the continua-
tion. If the lode is slightly curved
where the fault occurs you will
proceed in the direction the curva-
ture indicates. If there is no curva-
ture you should look for striations
and grooves.
By rubbing the hand backwards
and forwards along the direction
■:hown by the striations you may
notice that there is smoothness
one way and roughness the other.
The side you are rubbing has
movel in the direction of smooth-
ness, The roughness is caused by
the plucking action of stones em-
bedded in the surface of the op-
posite block that has been fault-
ed.
If a lode has been faulted alter
the gold has been deposited, low
values may occur along the fault
plane in the direction of the fault-
ed component. Such values are
due to a shattering of the lode
and a certain amount of drag
along the fault plane.
Enrichments in Joints
Joints are rents or partings in
a rock, usually with little, if any,
displacement. They may cut
across both igneous and sedimen-
tary rocks for great distances. Un-
even pressures tension or orsion
in brittle rocks under pressure,
will give rise to joints. Such
brittle rocks as eranite, quartzite
and “jasper bars” show excellent
iointing sometimes in three direc-
tions, These rocks thus weather
in a blocky form.
Care must be taken to distin-
guish between bedding and joints.
Failure to do so will lead to false
conclusions as to the position of
the beds. Joints are ordinarily
smoother than bedding planes,
and they also pass indiscrimin-
ately from one layer to another.
They may even cut through peb-
bles or boulders.
Closely spaced parting planes
are called “cleavage” planes. They
are often seen in brittle rocks at
the arch of a fold, where they
may be at right angles to the
bedding.
Joint planes in “jasper bar”
country are often responsible tor
secondary enrichment Solutions
carrying gold travel along them
and cause a certain amount of
gold deposition from place to
place. This action is more or less
confined to the zone above water
level, and explains why many
“Jasper bars” fail to live down.
Minor Economic
Minerals
High Prices Rule for
Some of them
By G. SPENCER COMPTON,
B.Sc., A.W.A.S.M., M.Aust.I.M.M..
In this group is a number of
minerals which command reason-
able prices under sets of condi-
tions which may apply quite
favourably, and make the working
of a deposit sound economically.
In exploiting them it is neces-
sary to know and appreciate well
what is required by the market in
purity and cleanliness of the par-
ticular mineral, where the market
for it lies and the considerations
of handling and freight. If the
selling price be known and all the
likely costs can be budgeted for
closely, the possible existence of a
profitable margin can be deter-
mined.
Some of the minerals have a
fairly uniform and steady demand,
with prices which remain fairly
stable, such as wolfram and schee-
lite. Others fluctuate a good deal
and may make a hazardous enter-
prise, like asbestos and mica. Still
others are of considerable rarity
with a more or less high value and
ready sale at high prices, like tan-
talite.
Felspar
Felspar occurs freely in all
classes of igneous rocks, but par-
ticularly in granites or granite
varieties, such as pegmatite. Only
in rare cases is the mineral found
in such masses or quantities of
such purity as to be of economic
value.
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


The price to be obtained is likely
to be thought low, and a consider-
able degree of purity (freedom
from quartz admixture or “inter-
growths’' and of staining material)
is insisted on l>y the market.
This State has produced 33,000
tons for approximately £ABI,OOO.
For good grade selected felspar
the producer may expect more
than £A3 a ton. It would be quar-
ried out in a fairly efficient man-
ner from a large-ize pegmatite
deposit and be sorted and selected
by the cheapest means.
Worked on a fairly large scale,
quarrying charges should be low
enough, with road and rail trans-
port, handling, etc., to leave a
profitable margin.
The best deposit worked so far in
this State is at Londonderry, south
of Coolgardie. This area supplies
the greater part of this country’s
requirements.
The mineral is used after grind-
ing to flue powder for glass, pot-
tery and porcelain manufacture,
for enamels and glazes, and in a
minor way for some forms of
scouring soaps and cleaners.
The mineral is recognised by its
excellent cleavage, or break, by
which it yields flat, smooth sur-
faces with a somewhat pearly ap-
pearance. Its weight is about that
of quartz (specific gravity 2.6),
and hardness a little less than
that of window glass. Colours are
usually pale shades of cream, grey
or green.
Beryl
This mineral is the present only
important source of the element
beryllium. The metal beryllium is,
in future years, likely to be of very
great importance because of some
most valuable and special proper-
ties developed in another metal or
imparted in its alloys.
The chief use at present is in
making alloys of copper by add-
ing 1| per cent, to 21 per cent, of
beryllium. The mineral beryl con-
tains perhaps 13 per cent of oxide
(BeO) or 5 per cent, of the metal
be-ry Ilium.
Beryl is commonly found in peg-
matites, sometimes with or near
to felspar and mica. Some large
hexagonal crystals have been ex-
posed in the United States ot
America One weighed 19 tons.
For 900 tons produced in this
State, the value was £A27,000
(£A3O a ton).
(All pegmatite dykes and veins
in granite country should be
searched closely along their length
and on both walls, across the
width as often as possible, and in
all exposures, for felspar, mica,
beryl, tantalite, wolframite or cas-
siterite. These latter three are
black and heavy minerals.)
Beryl is sometimes a by-pro-
duct” from a mica or felspar de-
posit. It occurs sometimes as hexa-
gonal crystals, often with a flat-
tened end, or in crystalline masses
of considerable size, white, pinkish
or pale greenish in colour.
It is as hard as quartz, and
sometimes rather difficult to dis-
tinguish, but commonly a charac-
teristically fluted or striated sur-
face is a good guide in sorting.
The mineral is likely in any
pegmatite vein or dyke, and has
been found over a considerable
part of the State—at Wodgina and
other places in the North-West, at
Melville (Yalgoo Goldfield), at
Londonderry and at Balingup
(South-West).
Producers in this State, despite
the difficulties in distinguishing it
from other minerals, have been
fortunate or accurately discrimi-
nating in their selection, for usual-
ly the analyses have shown that a
high-grade material has been
marketed (11 to 13 per cent. BeO).
The latest price is £A2 10/ per
unit per short ton at Fremantle —
that is, a 12 per cent. BeO sample
would be worth £A3O delivered at
Fremantle,
Mica
The mineral is well known to
all, and readily recognised. It is
also realised by all that commer-
cial mica must be in relatively
large sheets, clear and free of in-
clusions or stainings, and free
from flaws and cracks.
There are three common varie-
ties likely—biotite or black mica
(no value); lepidolite or violet
mica, and muscovite (white mica).
the common commercial variety.
An important variety, phlogopite,
is produced in Canada and else-
where.
Mica is found commonly in
masses, called “books,” in pegma-
tite dykes or veins in granitic
country. It may be found in close
contact with good felspar—or
beryl, and either one may help in
the production of the other
The books of mica when sepa-
rated from the rock mass are easily
cleaned or parted into compara-
tively thin plates, which become
of commercial grade when the size
exceeds about 2 in. by 1 in. (worth
about 2/ a pound in this size), in-
creasing in value greatly as the
size of the sheet increases. Sheets
of mica, io in. by 10 in. are worth
about £A6 a pound.
Mica deposits are somewhat un-
satisfactory for mining or quarry-
ing purposes, owing to the very
scattered or sporadic manner in
which the books occur. Even in
the most favourable dyke deposits,
the books may occur first on one
wall, then on another, or in ir-
regular zones throughout the mass,
with few helpful signs to guide the
miner. “Mica in a dyke is where
you And it.”
A large amount of stone
quarried will yield a small amount
of mica in books. The books will
then be parted and trimmed to
produce a small amount of mate-
rial suitable for grading for market.
The ultimate yield of mica may be
quite small, though the first out-
look appeared most favourable.
If the deposit be in an area at
all unfavourable for hiring, work-
ing and transport, then very care-
ful estimation and budgeting will
be necessary.
Vermiculite
This mineral is allied to black
mica—biotite—from which it ap-
parently has been altered hydro-
thermally. It possesses the pecu-
liar property ot swelling to many
times its original volume when cast
on to a hot plate. The plates or
flakes swell by expanding with a
twisting or wormlike movement
After the swelling process is com-
plete, the material possesses con-

siderable bulk for little weight (1
cub. ft. weighs 10 lb.) and has a
silvery or sometimes golden sheen.
The colours last well, and the ex-
foliated material may be found a
valuable component for decorative
wall treatments.
It is generally incorporated with
cement or plaster of Paris for in-
sulating purposes, sound deaden-
ing and in other ways for packing
and for pipe or refrigerator insula-
tion.
Some years ago the mineral was
of no commercial value, but patient
research and experiment in recent
years have developed a rather w -de
range of properties.
A very large mass of vermiculite
occurs in Montana (U.S.A.).
United States production before
the war was about 60,000 tons
In this State we have good-grade
mineral at Bulong—in large masses
of deep green colour, rather shin-
ing, flaky appearance. Another de-
posit is at Young River (west of
Esperance) near Ravensthorpe,
In this State and Australia the
market may be limited, but 1000
tons has been produced for ap-
proximately £A60,000. Probably
£A6 a ton could be expected for
clean and suitable material.
Barite
This is one of the white, or near-
ly white, rather heavy minerals
(specific gravity 4.5).
When of good colour and purity
it should be worth £A3 to £A6
a ton (Sydney).
The greatest single use is in the
preparation of certain white paints
and pigments (non-darkening) and
it is also used extensively as a filler
in the manufacture of rubber,
paper, textiles, etc. “Off-colour”
barite serves some other useful pur-
pose.
It is a common gangue mineral
in certain ore deposits, particularly
of lead and zinc, and it should be
a possible production in the North-
ampton (lead mining) area. Small
amounts have been produced at
Cardup and Cranbrook in this
State, and a recent find of very
promising type (Cooup i, on the
trans-Australian railway line) has
been reported.
Some barite, of dirty colour,
stained and inferior, has been
found near Coolgardie.
The world uses large amounts,
probably about 1,000,000 tons a
year, but in Australia the market
is likely to be limited.
Asbestos
This term is applied to varieties
of several minerals which occur in
fibrous form —that is, with short
or long silky fibres or threads.
Commercial asbestos is represent-
ed by the blue fibrous amphibole
called crocidolite, or by the white
or pale green, silky fibrous serpen-
tine. called chrysotile.
Fibrous actinolite and temolite
(amphibole varieties) are of com-
mon occurrence, but normally the
fibres are too harsh and brittle for
any industrial use (except, per-
haps, in heat insulation) and
neither of these materials has been
produced commercially.
Blue asbestos (crocidolite) of
high grade has been developed in
the Hamersley Range area (North-
West), 200 miles inland from Roe-
bourne. In 1943 180 tons, worth
£AIO,OOO, was produced.
The serpentine variety of chryso-
tile occurs in a dozen localities of
interest in the Pilbara district. The
asbestos is of a pure white to pale
lustrous green, and of very silky
appearance.
In both these two types of mine-
rals the fibres occur in veins or
veinlets from i in. to several inches
in length, and the fibres them-
selves are soft and of considerable
tensile strength, so that the mate-
rial is suitable for spinning.
Export material to date has fen
of fibre lumps, li in. to 4 in. in
lengths, but some special parcels of
greater fibre lengths have been pro-
duced.
Short-fibre material mav bring
£A2O a ton (Fremantle) and is
used for asbestos-cement boards or
other purposes, but the fibre suit-
able for spinning (above 1| in.)
may command a variety of prices
from £A4O tc £A2SO, depending on
length, grading and cleanliness
(3600 tons, worth £A136.000. have
been produced)
Tungsten Minerals
The tungsten ores are scheelite —
light-coloured, very heavy (specific
gravity 6.0) —and wolframite—dark
brown or black, often in
rectangular pieces, with a good flat
break or cleavage and a surface
often shining like a mirror.
Wolframite is one of the heavy
black minerals (specific gravity
about 7i) likely to be mistaken for
cassiterite (tin oxide, specific
gravity 7) or the various iron
oxides—haematite, magnetite and
ilmenite (specific gravity 5.5).
Careful attention to the relative
weight as well as to a few other
simple properties should enable a
prospector to decide the identity
of the mineral.
Only a few tons of concentrates
has been produced in the past in
this State, but there Is a strong
demand for high-grade material.
One locality in the Murchison
Goldfield produced 8i tons of
mixed concentrates.
The total production of con-
centrates in this State is 60 tons,
worth £A30,000, of which the
wolfram was worth £AI6BO and the
scheelite £A27,800.
Some good wolframite occurs at
Wodgina and other places in the
North-West It is likely to occur in
quartz or pegmatite seams, or in
veins in granitic rocks, and “shed”
as alluvial on to neighbouring fiats
or into creeks. Wolfram is common-
ly found closely associated with tin
oxide, and in much the same way
as in Burma, China. Bolivia,
Portugal and Cornwall.
Most of the world’s scheelite
comes from California and Nevada,
where it occurs in veins, and often
with gold, as in this State.
World production of tungsten
concentrates exceeds 36,000 tons
(60 per cent WG3 concentrates)
The material is valued on the per-
centage of tungsten oxide (WG3),
and at present prices Is worth
£AS 10/ per unit per ton of con-
centrates—that is, one ton of 65
per cent WG3 concentrates would
be worth £A357 10/ a ton.

Systematic Sampling
Necessary
Gives True Indication
of Crushing Return
By R. W. Fletcher,
B.Sc. (hons.), M.Aust.I.M.M.,
Director, School of Mines
Correct sampling procedure alms
at securing a small portion of
material which can be regarded
as typically representative of the
whole.
An ideal sample of an ore would
be one that is exactly representa-
tive of the larger section under
examination, but since metals (par.
ticularly gold) are rarely dis-
tributed by nature in an even
manner, it is impossible to obtain
mathematically exact samples.
A high grade gold ore showing
values of 1 oz. a ton will have
a very small gold content in a 2
lb. sample. It is therefore essen-
tial that every care be taken to
ensure that the sample is repre-
sentative
Samples must also be taken at
frequent points or at frequent
intervals to ensure that the aver-
age value of the ore can be calcu-
lated with some degree of ac-
curacy
Accuracy Essential
One of the greatest difficulties in
securing an accurate sample is due
to the limited amount of material
exposed to view.
In a costeen or a working face
only one surface of the ore body
is exposed. Consequently only a
small portion of this surface layer
can be included in the sample.
What lies 5 ft. or 10 ft. beyond
will depend on a number of fac-
tors.
In an ore dump we see again
only a surface layer. For our
sample to be truly representative
we would have to include the
material in the centre of the
dump.
If the ore body consists of hard
and soft materials, another diffi-
culty arises—that of ensuring that
a proportionate amount of each is
contained in the sample.
Good sampling, therefore, calls
for experience, judgment and com-
mon sense. A lazy, ignorant per-
son would never make a good
sampler. He would shirk the task
of putting hard work into the cut-
ting of the hard material in the
ore, and his sample, therefore,
would not be truly representative.
An inaccurate sample is worse
than none, since inevitably it leads
to false conclusions.
The size of a sample to be taken
is relative, and must be determined
by judgment. It may vary from 2
lb, to 3 lb. up to hundreds ot
tons.
Sampling will be described under
the following heads:—
(a) Sampling of ore bodies.
(b) Sampling of ore dumps.
(c) Sampling of sand and slime
dumps.
Face Sampling
There are three types ot samp-
ling carried out on ore bodies—
face sampling, grab sampling and
drill hole sampling.
The ideal face sample is a regu-
lar groove or channel cut across
the exposed face at right angles
to the dip of the lode.
In a drive the sample is taken
from waist to shoulder high across
the face. A “back” sample is taken
across the roof of a drive (usually
at 5 ft. intervals), and a floor
sample similarly is cut across the
lode in the floor of the drive.
Before the sample is taken, the
face should be washed or brushed
down and the part selected for
sampling should be trimmed so
well that it represents a flat,
freshly broken surface.. No more
than 3 ft. of lode (true width)
should be included in the one
sample.
The groove varies in dimensions
according to requirements.
A mine under option may be
sampled in grooves 4 in. wide by
1 in. deep. An operative mine, in
which the sample is required mere-
ly to give some indication of the
value of the ore from cut to cut,
usually is sampled with a sampling
pick, and only a “chip” sample is
taken. This chip sample should
give at least 2 lb. of sample over
a width of 3 ft. The chip sample
gives some idea of the value of the
ore in advance.
When the lode is bored out and
fired, a grab sample is taken from
the trucks and compared with the
groove sample. The operative
miner therefore knows from past
production what reliance can be
placed on the various methods of
sampling he has adopted.
Catching Samples
In hard ore-bodies it is necessary
to use a hammer and moil to cut
the sample. Soft ore-bodies usually
can be sampled with an ordinary
sampling pick. Most routine face
samples are cut with the pick, and
the sampler rolls the edges of his
bag well back, and holds it under
the part of the face he is chipping.
For floor and back samples it
is necessary to have a sampling
sheet, as the sampler must utilise
both hands in the actual cutting.
A special sampling bag wired
around the top is sometimes used
instead of rolling the edges of the
bag back, and a contrivance simi-
lar to that worn by the old-time
“peanuts and chocolate” boy in
the picture theatre is used on some
mines.
Grab Method
Grab sampling is now standard
practice on all producing mines.
The prospector is well advised to
adopt it on his small show.
Grab sampling consists of
scooping a double handful of ore
(coarse and fine) from the ton of
each truck or kibble, and putting
it in a fracteur box At the end
of the shift the sample is collect-
ed and passed to the assay office.
A separate box is kept for each
working face, and the survey cf-
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


fice keeps a record of all the grab
samples, and the number of trucks
represented in each sample. The
capacity oi the trucks is known,
and thus it can be calculated that
a certain cut underground yielded
so many tons for so many penny-
weights by grab sample.
The grab sample is very valu-
able, and great reliance is placed
on it. A producing mine, after a
number of years, can, with some
degree of accuracy, estimate a cor-
rection factor for the grab sample
which will make it approximate
the actual true value of the ore
shown by the mill.
The careless trucker who aims
his double handful of ore in a hit-
or-miss fashion at a battery of
sample boxes can be detected in
time by the continually erratic
nature of his sample.
Prospector, Too
The prospector should take his
grab sample from each kibble
pulled, and should keep a tally of
the number of kibbles. When the
box is nearly full, he should break
down the sample and quarter it,
as will be explained later.
A very rough grab sample is
sometimes taken after a cut is
fired by selecting a handful of
dirt from here and tliere. In all
grab samples the aim should be
to select coarse and fine material
in the double handful. Coarse
material should not exceed 1 in.
to 2 in. in diameter.
The sample should not be select-
ed in pieces Rather should the
sampler aim at getting his sample
from a portion of the truck or
kibble which shows coarse and
fine mixed.
Fines alone should always be
avoided, as there is always a ten-
dency for the fine material (par-
ticularly friable sulphides) to as-
say considerably higher than 'he
actual average of the ore.
Drill Hole Method
Extensions of ore beyond the
walls of a drive are not infrequent,
and it is a common practice to
put out sample holes at intervals
into both walls. The holes are
drilled with an ordinary machine
(or the hard way—with a hammer
and tap, by the prospector), and
the sludge is kept in a tin for as-
say.
Normally such holes are restrict-
ed to about 6 ft, true width, as
they are bored on an angle to
secure clearances for the
machines and drills. Extensions
beyond_ 6 ft, and parallel lodes are
prospected by diamond drill, and
the core is sent for examination
and portions selected for assay
Bulk Samples
In very erratic ore-bodies which
are difficult to sample by ordinary
means, bulk samples may be taken
by the option holder. Such, samples
will vary in size according to re-
quirements.
A drive which is being put
through may be sampled by select-
ing every fifth or tenth truck of
ore taken from each cut. A large
bulk sample is thus built up, and
this can be put through a mill (a
State battery, for example), or
successively broken and quartered
down until a smaller sample is
secured. This, together with other
similarly treated samples, may
constitute the bulk sample “crush-
ing.”
Sampling Ore Dumps-
As with underground sampling,
time and care must be taken in the
sampling of ore dumps if the re-
sults are to be satisfactory.
A dump that is being carted
away for crushing or shipment can
be sampled by taking the 10th
shovelful as the bulk sample. If
the dump represents 100 tons, the
bulk sample would be equal to 10
tons, and it is therefore advisable
to sample as you go, successively
breaking down the sample after
every few tons so that the discard
can go back on to the dump.
Bulk sampling of this nature is
hard work, but at times it is very
necessary.
However, the ordinary prospector
should aim at taking his bulk
sample when he is pulling dirt and
not after it has gone into the pad-
pock.
Trench Sampling
Large ore dumps on properties
under option should be trench
sampled. For the sample to be
truly representative, the trench or
trenches should cut right through
the dump. Here, again, the sys-
tem of taking the 10th shovelful
as the bulk sample should be
adopted
A very common practice is to
cut a narrow circular trench
around the outside of a small mul-
lock dump with a view to finding
out if the material carries any
values. Before cutting the trench,
the surface material is picked away
so that the sample will be of un-
weathered material.
This system of sampling is not
good practice, but an inspecting
mining engineer often does it be-
cause he knows that schist
material, often passed over by the
prospector (particularly the man
on quartz) as either valueless or
too low grade, may prove im-
portant from the tonnage angle as
far as the company is concerned.
His sampling in this case is mere-
ly a test which can be followed up
by more reliable sampling if neces-
sary.
Sampling of large ore dumps by
sampling trenches or sampling
shafts is important from the view-
point of a mining engineer, but is
beyond the scope of the average
prospector.
Sampling Tailings Dumps
There are many old mines in
this State with tailings dumps,
and quite often a prospector is
tempted to "give them a go.” Such
a venture as a tailings dump re-
quires very detailed information
as to quantity, value and estimated
recovery.
Quantity can be estimated by
measurement. Value must be as-
certained by careful sampling and
the estimated recovery necessi-
tates ore dressing investigations.
The Kalgoorlie metallurgical
laboratory, conducted in collabora-
tion with the School of Mines,
carries out these investigations for
prospectors, syndicates and mining
companies at very reasonable
charges
The sample sent in for investiga.
tion must be taken with every
care. It should be large enough
for the various tests to be carried
out, and a sample of the mine
water to be used in the treatment
should accompany the sample.
A tailings dump should be
sampled by boring holes at regu-
larly spaced intervals from the
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


top vertically through to the bot-
tom of the dump, The holes can
be bored by auger, or a posthole
digger (for a low dump) can be
used.
The sample is carefully removed
from the auger on to a sampling
sheet, but if dry, precautions must
be taken to ensure that none of
the material is blown away. If a
large sample is obtained it may
have to be quartered down
Breaking Sample Down
A producing mine can run large
bulk samples through its mill, and
these, in turn, can be sampled as
they pass through the various
stages of crushing and grinding.
Grab samples from underground
can be taken direct to the assay
office, where they are broken down
to the required size. ,
A prospector, however, needs to
break his large grab sample down
until lie finally has about a 2 lb.
sample, which he sends for assay.
Large pieces can be broken with
a hammer on a large flat sheet,
but there is always a tendency
for the pieces to fly everywhere.
A dolly pot with a canvas cover,
through which the iron bar of
the pestle has sufficient clearance,
will prevent the pieces from scat-
tering
All samples should be spread on
a flat sheet and. well mixed by
shovelling. After mixing, the
material should be arranged In the
form of a cone and then flattened
the remainder discharge to the
out into a circular, fairly flattish
dump. The shovel is then used
to cut this dump into halves and
to separate them. Each half is
then cut in two and the resulting
quarters are chosen for the sample
and the remainder discarded.
The process is repeated until
finally a sample of about 2 lb,
weight with the largest pieces no
more than J in in diameter is
obtained.
Sampling Theory
A large sample may thus start
off with pieces from 1 in. to 2 in
in diameter included. As sampling
proceeds these must be cracked
down to smaller sizes.
The theory governing the size oi
pieces in a sample is that the
largest piece always must be so
small in proportion to the total
volume that its retention or re-
jection will have little effect on the
result, even though such piece
contains the maximum amount of
impurity or value possible in the
circumstances.
In the case of gold-bearing ore,
the piece may be pure mullock or
it may represent high grade ore.
In quartering down a sample
care must be taken to ensure that
fines are not blown away or left
behind on the sampling sheet. The
fines belonging to each quarter
must be carefully swept to such
quarter with a banister broom.
Another method of breaking
samples down (for samples of 100
lb. or less) is to roll the sample on
a canvas sheet Each comer is
lifted in turn and the sample al-
lowed to roll over. When the ore
is well mixed a cone is formed It
is then flattened and rolled. By
lifting the sheet each side of the
halfway point and using it as a
knife, two samples will be obtained,
one of which is kept ana the other
rejected.
A similar roll of ore can be
sampled by scooping out several
sections at right angles to the
length of the roll.
Mechanical Aid
Mechanical splitters can oe
made cheaply and are very effec-
tive. The most common type con-
sists of a series of slots, alternate
slots discharging to one side while
other side. The top of this splitter
has sides sloping outwards to pro-
duce a funnel effect. The sample is
thus halved. One half is kept for
further breaking down if neces-
sary. The other half, of course, is
rejected.
Sampling is largely a question of
common sense, and the various
methods to be adopted will depend
upon requirements and the nature
Of the ore.
The prospector has, in the past,
devoted too little attention to the
sampling of his show. He uses the
panning-off dish continually, but
rarely does he take the trouble to
sample systematically.
Half an hour spent on sampling
every day is well worth while as it
gives the prospector some idea of
what the crushing will yield. Many
prospectors receive a jolt when the
crushing return is low, and they
therefore "can’t understand it.’’ or
they blame the battery.
Systematic sampling Is the only
way out.
Lodes, Reefs, Veins
and Outcrops
Geology Can Be Great
Aid to Prospector
By R. W. FLETCHER,
B.Sc. (hons.), M.Aust.I.M.M.,
Director, School of Mines
Land surfaces are continually
being modified by the work of
winds, rain, rivers, lakes and other
surface agencies. Rock masses are
being broken down, and while
much of the fragmental material
eventually finds its way to the sea,
a considerable amount is left on
the land surface in the form of
soil.
In the breaking- down process,
hard rocks tend to resist the work
of surface agencies whereas soft
rocks are easily worn away. The
term “outcrop” is used to describe
a rock mass that protrudes through
the soil capping.
As these outcrops usually consist
of hard rock, they are to be found
mostly on high ground. River
valleys and gorges will, of course,
expose hard rock layers, such as
the so-called Marble Bar
Two Zones
In some outcrops the rock is
practically unaltered —that is, it is
similar in structure, appearance
and mineral composition to the
rock some distance below the sur-
face.
However, most rock masses show
some degree of alteration from
water level upwards to the outcrop,
and this zone of alteration is re-
ferred to as the “oxidised zone,”
and the rocks themselves are said
to be “weathered.”
Below water level there is in-
variably a change—gradual or sud-
den—to the unaltered rock of the
“primary,” or, as it is sometimes
called, the “sulphide zone.”
PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


It is therefore rare to find rocks
containing sulphide minerals ex-
posed in outcrops. Some quartz
veins may show a little sulphide
mineral because quartz is very re-
sistant to weathering, and tends to
protect the sulphide.
The average prospector confines
his activity to the oxidised zone.
When he strikes water level he
usually is faced with a number of
problems. He needs machinery to
cope with increased depth, drain-
age, boring of the ground and
treatment of the hard sulphide ore.
At this stage he either sells out
to a company or a syndicate, drops
the show altogether or raises the
necessary capital to carry on under
new conditions.
Water level is thus the critical
point in mining, and in the past
many promising shows have been
strangled in infancy when water
level has been reached.
Enriched Zone
Not only is there considerable
change in conditions, but there is
always the possibility of a mar.-ced
decrease in values. Goldfields and
other mineral fields throughout the
world are pitted with shafts and
workings which have barely reach-
ed the sulphide zone because of a
falling-off in values.
The oxidised zone is notoriously
a zone of secondary enrichment
and only the highly capitalised
mining companies can afford to
spend much money in proving the
ground below the oxidised zone.
The average prospector has, there-
fore, a limited zone in which to
work.
He picks out the eyes in the oxi-
dised zone, but invariably is forced
to hand over to the company when
the sulphide zone is reached.
This State has been well pros-
pected in the past. There is hardly
an outcrop that has not been
knapped or a hillside that has not
been loamed. Future finds will be
made mainly in established gold-
fields and will represent lateral or
vertical extensions of ore-bodies
worked in the past, new parallel
ore-bodies, or spurs related to Al-
ready proved lodes, and new ore-
bodies at present concealed by soil
cappings in favourable geological
zones.
The Mararoa line at Norseman
and the Great Fingall at Day Dawn
are examples of quartz reefs that
have yielded excellent results on
further lateral or vertical explora-
tion.
Beneath Overburden
These reefs are of deep-seated
origin, and are comparable with
the famous Champion reef in My-
sore, India, which for many years
has kept pace with the, vertical
development of the Rand mines.
The new finds at Coolgardie
have proved the value of geological
information in a zone which shows
few outcrops.
The future of lodes in soil-
covered country is now fairly well
assured. The combined results of
geological and geophysical pros-
pecting should tend to localise the
promising areas, and thus give
the prospector a reasonable chance
of discovering new ore-bodies.
Ore bodies will still, of course,
be found outcropping. The Boo-
gardie ridge in the Mt. Magnet
district will always attract the
prospector who is looking for a
“data” in the quartz-filled “breaks”
cutting through the “jasper bar.”
There are plenty of such outcrops
in this State, and although all
have been well prospected, there is
always a chance of other dabs be-
ing located.
Most Gold in Greenstone
In searching for new finds it is
well to know the history of the
particular goldfield and the various
rock-mineral associations.
Primary gold deposits in reefs
or lodes invariably are always in
greenstone country,, and nearly
always are associated with some
igneous rock, whether it be granite,
porphyry or merely quartz.
Bock contacts should be exam-
ined carefully, as they usually are
zones of weakness. This applies
particularly where an igneous rock
makes contact with an older series
or rocks.
In Kalgoorlie the lodes occur
principally in quartz dolerite
greenstone, which represents a
large dyke, or laccolith. This green_
stone has been well fissured, and
while some of the fissures have
been filled with porphyry, a late
series of fissure carries the gold-
bearing lodes.
While the majority of our gold
deposits are in the greenstone
belts, it is considered that the
gold was carried into the green-
stones by solutions which represent
the end phase of acid igneous
activity.
Hence the association of gold
deposits with granite contacts, por-
phyry intrusions and quartz veins.
These acid rocks are therefore
good pointers in most goldfields.
Without them there is usually no
gold.
Deep Leads, Laterite
Surface gold-bearing deposits
have been wbll prospected. Allu-
vial gold shed from lodes and
reefs is found in river valleys or
in large alluvial flats at the foot
.of ridges. When an old river val-
ley has been covered up by later
rocks it is necessary to sink
through the latter to strike the
old gutters. Such deposits are re-
ferred to as “deep lead s” —
examples of which occurred at
Kanowna, Boogardie and Kalgoor-
lie and Boulder, then there are
the basalt-covered deep leads of
Victoria.
Some lodes are now covered by
laterite, and in various localities
such as Carbine, Burtaidge and
Nevoria, the laterite has yielded
good values,' At Carbine, below
the laterite 'there is a flat layer
of chemically formed rock con-
taining gold, which has been
mined by a method similar to that
used in coal- mines—pillar and
bord.
“Ironstone,” a capping rock
formed largely of the dark brown
to black oxide of iron called limo-
nite, is another rock which has
yielded values. Free gold can
often be detected in this material
either as a paint or in thread-like
veins.
It is probable that many of the
dark ironstone and laterite cap-
pings owe their iron content to.
the sulphides which occur below
water level.
Ore-Shoots Formed
Primary ore deposits owe their
origin to some structural feature.
At some time or other openings
must have formed in the country

PROSPECTORS’ GEOLOGY COURSE


solutions were able to travel. Such
openings may have been created
by faults, shear zones, joint planes
and other fractures, or by folds.
Lodes or reefs are very rarely
uniform in gold content. Some
portions may be worthless, or low
in value while others are rich, or
at least payable.
The rich or payable portion is
referred to as an “ore-shoot,” and
the ore-shoot invariably is the re-
sult of certain structural features.
Changes in the dip or strike of
the lode are often responsible for
the beginning or termination of an
ore-shoot. Openings made in the
arch of a fold commonly carry ore
shoots, as, for example, the well-
known saddle reefs at Bendigo.
The recent finds at Coolgardie
are related to the folding of the
rocks, and here we have the ideal
set-up—structure and favourable
rock association.
While these deposits definitely
show all the characteristics of
primary gold-bearing lodes, it must
be remembered that there is always
the possibility that some or all of
the deposits have been secondarily
enriched.
Many of the deposits will be fair-
ly small in length and width, as
they represent only small openings
in drag folds, but others, which
may be found located in larger
structures, will doubtless prove
fairly large in extent.
Cross Shears Favourable
To date very little is known of
these deposits, as the finds are of
recent origin. We do know, though,
that the area was recommended
for prospecting by. the geologists
of the Government geological sur-
vey on very sound structural
grounds.
The intersection of shears or
“heads” may also give rise to ore-
shoots. Where the two series of
shears cross each other may easily
be a shattered zone favourable for
ore deposition. By following the
intersection downwards (that is,
the pitch of the ore-shoot), one
should keep on ore unless a change
in rock type occurs.
In general, brittle rocks are more
rock, such as shale, for carrying
favourable than the plastic type of
lodes.
When Lode Cuts Out
The termination of values in a
drive may be caused by a number
of factors, such as the lode or vein
passing from one rock type to
another, change in strike or dip
of the lode, right-angled folding,
faulting, igneous intrusion, or a
cross shear that has earned the
ore-bearing solutions across to a
parallel lode channel. An ore-shoot
occupying the crest of a fold may
pinch out on one or both limbs.
One of the best examples of the
association of an ore deposit with
structure is the Broken Hill lode.
The ore is located in the arch and
trough of an overturned fold,
which has a north-east axis. A
cross fold has its anticlinal axis
cutting through the centre of the
line of lode, and thus we find the
ore related to both longitudinal
and cross folding.
The gold deposits of the Yilgarn
Goldfield, south of Southern Cross
and Yellowdine, are similarly re-
lated to longitudinal and cross-
folding. Here again, as elsewhere
in this State, we find the acid
igneous intrusion in the form of
fairly flat sheets of pegmatite or
granite.
The Boogardie deposits in “jas-
per bar” country are related to
folding and faulting. Porphyry in-
trusions are very small here, but
are present nevertheless, and
quartz is fairly abundant.
The Youanmi lode system owes
its origin to folding and faulting
at the contact of granite and
greenstone.
At Norseman, roughly parallel
fractures are occupied by quartz.
Where these fractures are linked
by fairly flat cross features, ore-
shoots occur.
At Wood’s Point (Vic.) gold is
again associated with quartz in
reverse faults, which cut through
a greenstone dyke.
Lodes or reefs often run in
parallel series, sometimes closely
spaced, and where one ore-shoot
cuts out, another may join in a
parallel shear close by.
The prospector should always be
on the look-out for cross shears or
heads which may not actually fault
the lode but may carry the values
out into the footwall or hanging-
wall. This tendency has. been
noticed in some of the recent Cool-
gardie finds.
Continual Watch Necessary
Where a lode cuts out entirely,
as against pinching out, faulting
should be suspected.
Following a lode calls for con-
tinual observation, and all changes
—whether they lie in the dip or
strike of the lode, a cross shear, an
igneous intrusion, a fault or a fold
—should be carefully examined for
clues as to where the values have
gone. Where possible, surface
features should be used as a guide
in following the lode underground.
Much dead work can be avoided
if the prospector is able to interpret
what he sees underground. When
he has located an ore-shoot, he
should endeavour to find out in
which direction it pitches.
If the ore-shoot is in the nose of
a fold, the curviture of the folded
beds will indicate the direction of
pitch. Similarly, the intersection
of two heads can be traced down-
wards from the strike and dip of
each head.
It is all a question of visualising
the ore-body in three dimensions.
The prospector should become
familiar with the use of surveying
instruments, such as the prismatic
compass and clinometer (a three-
foot rule, with a level included,
will do). He should be capable
of making approximately accurate
plans of his workings, which will
guide him in future developmental
work.
