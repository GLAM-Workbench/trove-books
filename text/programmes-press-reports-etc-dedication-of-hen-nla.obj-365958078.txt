THE TEAMS
A cloud of dust on the long, white road,
And the teams go creaking on
Inch by inch with the weary load;
And by the power of the greenhide goad
The distant goal is won.
With eyes half-shut to the blinding dust,
And necks to the yokes bent low,
The beasts are pulling as bullocks must;
And the shining tyres might almost rust,
While the spokes are turning slow.
With face half-hid by a broad-brimmed hat,
That shades from the heat’s white waves,
And shouldered whip, with its greenhide plait,
The driver plods with a gait like that
Of his weary, patient slaves.
And thus —with glimpses of home and rest —
Are the long, long journeys done;
And thus —’tis a thankless life at the best!—
Is distance fought in the mighty West,
And the lonely battle won.
—HENRY LAWSON.
