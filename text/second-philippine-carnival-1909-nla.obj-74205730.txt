THE PHILIPPINE CARNIVAL.
THE Philippine Carnival Association was organized during the
year 1907 by a body of men who realized something of the
possibilities of oriental development and who were not afraid to
take a chance. They clearly saw that the great weakness of the
Orient, and-particularly of the Philippine Islands, was, first, the
lack of friendly association among the different peoples, and,
second, the spirit of conservatism and indifference to the world s
activities, which in the Occident are yearly accomplishing such
miracles of development along all lines. It was decided to
establish and popularize an institution whose function should be
to bring the different isolated elements of the Orient together
upon some common ground agreeable to all, and there to teach
the greatest object lesson of history. In building up this institu-
tion it was found necessary to consider the field not as it should
be, but as it actually was. In its composition were included not
only the resources, advantages, and possibilities of the Client,
but also its weaknesses, shortcomings, and limitations. It was
decided that the proper field for the beginning was the Philippine
Islands, that the first scene should be laid in Manila, and that
the inauguration of the institution should take place in Febi nary.
1908. Thus was conceived, created, and opened to the Orient and
the world the first Philippine Carnival.
In the beginning the field abounded with difficulties. Ibe
apathy of the Orient, the lack of industrial, commercial, and
political development; the total absence df a community of in-
terest ; the mutual suspicion and lack of confidence between
individuals and peoples which ages of isolated existence had
produced; the fact that the new idea was new; that between it
and the oriental experience of the past there existed no analogy;
the fact that, in the beginning at least, its most active exponents
must necessarily be people from outside the Orient and who,
because of their lack of experience in things oriental, must neces-
sarily possess but a slight knowledge of the oriental temperament.
This and a variety of other features of the situation conspired to
make the task of this small body of carnival promoters an
immense and a difficult one.
The first carnival opened on February 27, and ended on March
3, 1908. The association was organized under the laws of tbe
Philippine Islands, stock was issued, and all of the regular
features of an enduring corporate organization were provided.
The start was made without money and without a definite credit.
Among the assets were included a spirit of most friendly disposi-
tion and cooperation on the part of the military and civil govern-
ments and business and commercial elements in the Philippine
Islands. The first carnival closed with a credit balance of eight
thousand pesos, with a practically unlimited credit, with a
splendid disposition on the part of every element in the com-
munity, with the knowledge that the spirit of the Orient is ideally
suited to carnival purposes, and with a definite determination to
make the carnival an annual affair.
The carnival of 1909 will open on Wallace Field on February
2, and will continue for eight days thereafter, the industrial
feature continuing for an additional week. In the 1908 carnival
were included water parade, land parade, two nights of hippo-
drome, coronation, carnival ball, a small provincial display,
tennis tournament, baseball, and a small athletic contest. The
carnival of 1909 will contain a land parade, day and night, an
automobile parade, seven nights of hippodrome and a matinee,
seven nights of highly spectacular pyrotechnic display, presenting
the attack and ultimate destruction of a city strongly fortified
and of the architecture of two hundred years in the future, by a
force of three hundred men, seven nights of spectacular shows in
the largest auditorium building ever seen in the Orient, seven days
and nights of athletic contests, forming the first Oriental Olym-
piad, in which polo, tennis, cricket, and track teams from Hong-
kong and the surrounding portions of the Orient will compete,
carnival ball, competitive provincial industrial display, in which
cash prizes aggregating PT5,000 will be awarded, native dances,
costumed groups, etc., from the provinces, including 150 members
of the different tribes from the Moro Archipelago, headed by the
Sultan of Sulu and twenty of his highest chiefs.
The Philippine Carnival has come to stay as an annual affair.
On every hand are found evidences of its peculiar value as an
agency whereby tbe development of the Orient may be accom-
plished. Here in the center of the wonderland of the world the
representatives of all nations and of all classes may come together
upon a common ground and under the guise of carnival fun and
Jollity work out the problem of the races.

of costumed figures conspire to make this float peculiarly oriental.
Car No. 5, ?Japan.?
The land of the crysanthemum, the pagoda, and happy .people. TTm ca
is typical of this country which for many years has existed in the minds of
the outside world as fairyland personified. The features appearing on this

the costumed figures, the gigantic fan, the dragon-decorated vase, the Tom,
all play their part in the history of this beautiful land.
Car No. 6, ?Egypt.?
This beautiful car is typically oriental. In the center is a magnificent
sphinx. In the rear the two splendid columns tell a story of an art almost
forgotten. Further forward appears the queen, surrounded by warriors, at-
tendants, musicians, etc. .
Car No. 7, ?China.?

nation. The dra|on, the arches, the warlike flgures thecolormg the standards,
all play their part in presenting characteristics peculiar to the Chinese race.

flowers In the rear of the car under the heavy arch draped in oriental

ground of glistening ice the Polaris flashes out in vivid colors.

appear, and each feature tells its own story.
Car No. 12, ?Germany.?

so strongly. . .
Car No. 14, ?Russia.?

designs and the immense chain surrounding the entire car, tell the story of
power and might in a manner not to be mistaken.

This car tells the story of Spain in the days of her glory. The immense
heavily draped cross at the rear of the float, the castles in the center, the
beautifully costumed figures, the mildly oriental colors, the bull, the toreadors
in the figurehead, all speak eloquently of the history of this wonderful country.

progress pointing the way which other nations should follow.

The colors are peculiarly occidental.
Car No. 18, ?Australia.?

indicate the two principal industries of this country?mining and stock raising.

a pair of birds well known in the land of the wallaby.
Car No. 19, ?The United States.?
