THE PRINTER’S PREFACE TO THE
SECOND EDITION.
The unusally short time in which this
interesting and genuine Autobiography
of fenpwden Dunhill has gone through
a numerous edition, calls for and re-
quires from the Printer a few observa-
tions. The manuscript was put into his
some time ago, by the person
vho received it from the writer in Bot-
my Bay, and it bears on the face of it
nnumerable proofs of its genuineness
md freedom from all deception. The
hunter has certainly not complied im


plicity with the request made by Snow-
den Dunhill in his address to the reader,
and he thinks this a fitting time and
opportunity to inform the public, why
he has failed to do so. He has not
added one single word to the manuscript,
and, on no account whatever would he
have done so; it would have been a
breach of faith and an act of dishonesty,
for which he could never have forgiven
himself. However, he has suppressed
many anecdotes, and the relation of
many adventures, for reasons which he
trusts will prove his justification with
the Public, as well as with the gentleman
who placed the history in his hands for
publication. ,
The manuscript contains, in the rela-
tion of many transactions, the names of
persons still living, given at full length.
The Printer neither dared nor wished
to give them in full, and rather than


suppress the names, a suppression he
did not feel justified in" making, he has
omitted the anecdotes altogether.
Several persons implicated in these
transactions, and formerly the com-
panions of Snowden Dunhill, have seen
the error of their ways, and have become
honest, industrious, and respectable
men. It would be the extreme of
cruelty, under such circumstances, to
expose their early courses to the world,
of which it is presumed and hoped they
are truly repentant.
To refer to one instance—Snowden
Dunhill was shot at in early life, after
the perpetration of a robbery in a rabbit-
warren, whilst returning from it on his
way to Spaldington. A medical man
now living in Howden, and then a part-
ner with an eminent practitioner since
deceased, attended him at Spaldington.
The Printer thought it due to the feelings


of this gentleman, to suppress the pas-
sage altogether, rather than introduce
his name in a manner that might be very
disagreeable to a feeling and sensitive
mind.
In some future edition these passages
shall appear at full length, when the
causes which now call for their sup-
pression are removed.
With these few observations the prin-
ter sends forth this second edition. The
call for the first has been so general,
having been sold in about a month from
its first appearance, that it is his inten-
tion to place for sale, copies of this, with
the principle Booksellers of the market-
towns in Yorkshire, not doubting but
all must wish to know the sentiments of
a man, in whom was combined the great-
est natural talent with the most active
moral depravity, and who has given
such a living picture of the rural popu-


lation, and of the country and villages
around Howden.

TO THE READER.
Oppressed by the remembrance of
present, I determined to put the few
the past and the sufferings of the
facts connected with my own life on
paper as a warning to others, who
may possilly be deterred from a life
of crime by a relation of my present
miseries and misfortunes. I arrived
at Botany Bay poor, broken in health,
and miserable. I felt that I had not
long to live, and that my constitution
could not possibly bear up against
the unceasing and hard labour I had


to perform, and the coarse and scanty
food I had to subsist upon. T chanced
to form an acquaintance with a con-
vict in the same gang as myself, he
was a very highlyeducatedandliterary
young man, having formerly been a
clerk in a bank in the north of
England, and he was transported for
the crime of forgery about three years
ago. He had often heard of my
name and exploits, and one day whilst
we were talking together about past
events, having heard me express my
intention of writing my life, he at
once volunteered his assistance to aid
me in arranging the facts and in cor-
recting any grammatical errors I
might commit. This we did at our
leisure hours, such as they were, and
though I told him everything con-


nected with myself, and stated to him
all the acts of spoliation in which I
had been engaged, we selected from
them the following only, being such
as we thought it the most useful to
record. This was done amidst many
sufferings and overwhelming fatigue,
circumstances which may account to
the feeling reader for that unmanly
and plaintive longing after my native
land, which pervades almost every
page of my memoirs.
My little history was soon com-
pleted, and my principal difficulty was
to find the means of getting it con-
veyed to England and printed at some
market-town near my native village.
It so happened one day whilst I was
employed in wheeling earth and stones
near the pier of the town of Sydney


in the harbour of Port Jackson, I had
rested for a moment to look upon the
beautiful Bay before me. My mind
was busily engaged in comparing it
with one of the many picturesque,
lake-like reaches of my native Hum-
ber, when I was roused from my
dreaming by a gentle tap on the
shoulder, and the salutation of “ Well,
Snowden, how are you ?” I touched
my cap in token of respect, when a
respectable sailor looking man in-
stantly seized me by the hand, shook
it in a friendly manner, and immedi-
ately told me his name. There was
at once present to my memory, the
old Hall at Spaldington, its peaked
roofs, its clustered chimnies, its rook-
ery, its jnoats, and myself and my


deposit my little history in his hands,
with the request that he would take
it with him to England, and see it
faithfully and correctly put in print.
He most willingly took this trouble
upon himself, and moreover promised
that not one letter of it should undergo
alteration. Upon his word I placed
implicit reliance feeling perfectly sa-
tisfied that my reader will learn from
it the real acts of my life, and the
genuine sentiments of my heart. I
hope my unfortunate life, with its
ceitain miserable termination, may
prove a warning to others. This is
the only atonement I can make to
the land of my birth for the many
injuries I have done it; and my last
prayer will be that centuries may
B


pass away before my native England
produce another so utterly unworthy
of her, as ever has been, and still is,
the wretched and miserable felon,

THE LIFE.
I have understood that I was born
at , a small village on the
Wolds in the East Riding of York-
shire, but I have not the slightest re-
membrance of the place or of ever
having been there. A small farmer
was moving from his farm in that
village to another in Spaldington,
about four miles to the north of the
venerable and somewhat famed mar-
ket town of Howden. I have some
indistinct remembrance of the waggon
which conveyed a part of his furni-
ture, and of my following it on foot
and liare-headed (for I had left or lost


my hat) all the way from to
Spaldington, which latter' place I have
always looked upon as my native vil-
lage, having in fact passed there the
early years of my life, without a
knowledge of any other.
It is a trite remark, upon what
trifles w r e in our blindness presume
our destinies to rest; in my own case
I verily believe that I should never
have been tempted to follow this cart
load of furniture, had it not been for
a little red-haired dog the property of
the owner, and to which I had taken
a great fancy. Of my parents I have
but a very indistinct remembrance,
for I never returned to them, but con-
tinued to reside in the village of my
adoption, and principally in the house
of the family I had accompanied to
Spaldington. Being considered in the
light of an orphan, having no father
or mother to look after me, I was
much noticed by the farmers in the


place, so much so, as finally to be
considered by them as having gained
a settlement in the township in ques-
tion.
Thus it seems probable that the
complexion of my life took its pecu-
liar colouring from my affection for
this little dog, which certainly was
the cause of my early evasion from
the cottage of my parents. What it
might have been had I continued with
them I cannot say,perhaps honourable
to myself and useful to my fellow-
men, at all events it could not have
proved more unfortunate to myself
than it turned out in the sequel.
Spaldington is, as I stated above,
about four miles to the north of How-
den, and is a secluded and purely
agricultural village. My earliest re-
collections are connected with the old
Hall there, an antique and fine build-
ing, erected as I have heard say,
about the time of Queen Elizabeth.


This house with its peaked roof, or-
namented with large round stones,
its moats, rookery, and the reputation
in the village of a fairy who haunted
it, is yet strongly impressed upon my
memory. Indeed, so much so, that
the only pleasure I now feel in my
banishment from my native land, is
the remembrance of my boyhood, and
that boyhood passed entirely within
view of this old mansion.
One of the keenest sorrows I ever
experienced was on hearing that a
portion of it had fallen down, and that
the present owner, Lord Howden, had
filled up its moats, and removed and
carried away many of its ornamental
parts. The old seat of the De La
Haye’s, the Vesci’s, and the Vava-
sour’s, totters to its fall. I well re-
member a tradition in the village that
one of the De Vesci’s was a compe-
titor for the crown of Scotland, one
of that family having married, if I


remember rightly, a daughter of Wil-
liam, King of that Country. The
burthen of an old song, generally
sung in my younger days, still clings
to my memory ; and it was understood
by us to relate to some eventful bat-
tle in which an owner of the Hall had
borne a conspicuous part. I remem-
ber well, and have often sung, and
even now with many seas —nay a
world between me and the spot, I
often catch myself humming the
chorus —
“ And the drums they did beat and the
trumpets did sound,
And the cannons did roar fit to tear up the
ground,
And its oh, brave, gallant and brave.
For the honour of England’s Crown!”
I continued to run about the village
an idle, mischievouslad,doing nothing
or worse than nothing. My greatest
pleasure was in listening to the tales
of an old man named Nathan, who
had been a servant at the Hall, and


whose sole delight in his old age, like
the family bards of the north, was to
relate the honourable deeds and tra-
ditions of his former masters and their
ancestors. Of course there was much
exaggeration and not a little fiction
to these relations, but I did not fail
to believe all, nor the less to consider
Spaldington as the finest place in the
kingdom, and its owners occupied an
equally elevated place in my estima-
tion.
This family, as I stated, had its
sprite, who yet lives in the memories
of many of the older inhabitants of
Spaldington. He was a good natured
species of familiar, with his airy flail
assisting alternately the thrashers or
the maids, and then playing upon both
those selfish tricks for which his race
has always been famed. Sometimes
remixing the winnowed wheat with
the chaff, now putting out the fire,
now kicking over the milk pail.


He was commonly known by the
name of Robin Round-cap, and tra-
dition stated that he was, by the per-
severing prayer of three clergymen,
conjured or prayed into a well, where
he stipulated to remain in quiet for a
given number of years. The well is
yet in existence and still bears his
name. The notion of family spirits
appears to have existed at one time or
other in every part of the kingdom,
a remnant no doubt, of Saxon super-*
stition.
In witnessing and partaking of the
pleasures of cock-fighting, wrestling,
foot-ball, and other sports, 1 passed
my first few years. Being now a
strong lad, and my parents unable to
assist me, I was taken into the house
of another farmer in the village, to
give my labour in exchange for meat
and clothes, which he was to provide
for me.
I appear to lose sight of my father


and mother at this period, scarcely,
indeed, remembering any thing con-
nected with them after leaving their
cottage. My master, who was but a
very small farmer, died soon after I
entered his service, but his widow
carried on the farm. They were
almost as poor in the world as my
father and mother, so that I experi-
enced no great change in my mode of
living on entering their service. They
had all their meals with their servants,
and lived with them in the kitchen,
or as the room was commonly then
called, the house. The master and
mistress sat at the upper end of the
table, and their servants below them.
On my master's death much less
strictness \tfas exercised towards me
than formerly; some one in the vil-
lage brought a pack of cards into the
house, with which we played every
night. My mistress, an easy, ignorant
person, often took a part, and it is to


his early initiation into the art of
ard-playing, that I date the com-
nencement of that unfortunate career
n my life, which has rendered my
lame so famous. .1 may say, I con-
sider it the cause of all my misfor-
;unes. I continued in the service of
aiy mistress and some other farmers
in the village for several years.
During this time I practised with-
out being generally suspected, a va-
riety of thefts. Indeed, few things
escaped me. Apples, eggs, corn,
(which ought to have been given to
the horses, found its way to the feed-
ing of my game cocks, of which I
had several,) nay, in fact, I took any
thing I could lay my hands upon.
These acts were confirmed into a
habit before I had begun to think
them wrong, and they are so gener-
ally practised by farmer’s servants
that I don’t feel surprised at it.
Their education is so universally neg


lected, and their morals so little at
tended to, that I have long bee:
satisfied that the honesty of the rura
districts of the country is very mud
inferior to that of the towns. * I hav
had conversation and experience witl
rogues of all kinds, and I have lonj
felt satisfied that such is the fact.
A farmers’ servant has no field fo
exertion; he has a small chance o
bettering his condition; and hope
that incitement to honest endeavour
is a stranger to him. This was mud
my case, the few feelings and im-
pressions of a better description whid
I had embibed when a lad, from ok
Nathan of the Hall, were now obliter-
ated by the boisterous sports anc
vicious practices of a more advancec
age.
My next step in life, the most
important one to all of us, was mar-
riage, and mine assuredly deepened
the darkest shades of my character.


was not a connection of the heart
it one almost of fear, for the woman
> whom I paid my addresses, was
ie being who ruled me from the first
loment of our acquaintance. Had
; been my good fortune to have met
rith an honest and industrious wo-
ran, my destiny might have been
liferent; but if, as the proverb says.
Marriages are made in heaven, it
ioes not become me to complain.
Well, 1 married; and commenced
hat state of life in a way much less
lommon in that day than at the
iresent, without a shilling, without a
rouse, and without a bed.
We lived a short time in the village
if Spaldington, but one farmer missed
his corn, the wife of another her
poultry, a third her apples, and of a
fourth her bees; so that we were
shortly put into a house in the lanes
of Spaldington, and in the road fiom
Howden toMarket-Weighton. When


the bees were missed, I fancy the'
thought nothing could escape us
As to myself, I never stole any thinj
that gave me half the trouble. The]
were easily moved and carried int(
our cottage, but the buzzing, th(
stinging, and the bother of the bush
ness, deterred me from ever again
entering upon such an undertaking,
Ihe proverb of running your head
into a swarm of bees, has ever since
appeared to me the most forcible in
the English language.
Behold us now settled in our cot-
tage in the lanes apart from any
other residence, and the very best
place that could have been chosen
by the farmers, had they determined
to put me into that way of life, into
which it had pleased chance and my
wife to call me. I had never been
accustomed to work, and I had very
little wish to learn now; and the
new connections I speedily formed


ion put me in a way of obtaining a
?tter»if not a less precarious sub-
stence.
I remember well a circumstance
iat occured at this period of my
fe. I had stolen several cocks for
ie purpose of fighting them, and a
lr.
erty in the village of Spaldington,
nd a young man at the time, offered
o join with me in the specculation.
They were to be fought at Hook, a
ullage where this kind of sport met
vith considerable encouragement, the
squire of the place being somewhat
notorious for the love of it. Hie
socks were entered for the main as
;he property of the gentleman above
named, and I remember the golden
dreams 1 entertained of the success
of my bets, which were to make me
independent for life.
All was eagerness for the com-
mencement of the business; every


one longing for a sight of the pooj
cocks on whose prowess he was aboul
to risk his money. Ours made a fine
show and my heart was delighted with
them. However they no sooner met
the public gaze, than one was challeng-
ed by one person as having been stolen
from him, another by another, and
so on through our whole collection.
My partner was in a mighty rage and
vowed vengeance on me, never having
troubled his head how I had picked
them up; and he was so heartily
ashamed of allowing his connection
with me to be made known, that he
was glad to make up the matter with
the different sufferers at no little
expence, while I escaped all furthei
trouble. Our partnership was, how-
ever, was at an end for ever, and he
never trusted me again, though 1
afterwards regained his favour, if nol
his confidence,
We continued to live in the cottage


bove alluded to, and our family con-
JI inued to increase, and with it the
cl iccessity of extending my species of
f varfare on the property of those
I iround me. The farmers in the
:t leighbourhood were at first the great
>' sufferers, and there was scarcely a
“ )arn or a granary within several
“ niles of me, which I had not the
'■ neans of entering when I choOse.
II father from discarded servants, or
= tom the labourers who were daily
L ibout the farm houses, I got every
■ f nformation I wanted. I had now
n lecorae the master of a good horse
e }r two ; I had a numerous connection
11 rmongst servants and labourers ; blit
what I found at this time of more
ase to me than all the rest, was my
secret understanding with two or
three millers. I had thus ample
means of getting safely lid of all
the corn I could conveniently steal,
*nd this was about as much as I
c


could carry home on horseback al-
most every night of the week.
Millers are generally reputed to be
great rogues, but in their dealings
with me 1 did not find them so;
indeed I suffered in the matter oi
dishonesty from no persons except
the few attornies I had dealings with,
and they certainly at last stripped
me of all I had toiled for, for many
years, and with an expedition and
facility that surprised me, as will be
seen in the sequel of this short bul
authentic account of my life. How
ever, I have known some good mer
of that profession, and I think th(
poet a libeller who says, —
“ I found the World one vast Attorney,”
at least if he did so I pity his case.
By this time my name had becom
famous, and I got the credit of man;
feats of dexterity in which I certain!;
had no share. Whenever I enterei


a town, I could not but be conscious
of the gaze of the people; and I
found them often pointing at me and
whispering. “ There’s Snowden Dun-
hill ” 1 was soon considered as the
head of a dangerous gang of plun-
derers and I had certainly become an
object of dread and fear with all the
surrounding farmers, I kept two
good horses, I had my greyhounds,
and a large canvas purse always well
lined with guineas, all these coupled
with my bluff manners and portly
and strong frame, added much to
the terror of my name.
I now became connected with two
or three men of broken fortunes,
who had been farmers on a small
scale, and whom misfortune had re-
duced to desperation. They were
all of them masters of a horse; and
we scoured the country far and wide,
and though guilty of but few rob-


beries of any note, our reputation did
not the less expand.
About this period a robbery took
place at Bubwith, which certainly was
planned by me, and by the perpetra-
tion of which I obtained a consi-
derable sum of money. After our
arrangements were made, a comrade
entered the house through a back
window, by taking an iron bar out of
the frame, the wood of which had
become quite rotten from age and
damp. In scrambling in he kicked from
a shelf a large earthen-ware vessel,
and immediately after he himself tum-
bled head foremost into a pantry a
depth of about six or seven feet.
The uproar occasioned by his fall,
induced us to take to our heels and
make to our horses which were at
no great distance, in a large field
behind the house. We laid us down
and listened for a considerable time.


and hearing nothing, we approached
the house again by degrees, and
eventually got up to the very win-
dow. A low whistle from me was
instantly answered by another, which
at once told us ail went well. We
found the back door open for us,
and our comrade, in no way alarmed,
busy rumaging some drawers, and
putting into a sack every thing he
took a fancy to.
As I had formerly lived in the
service of a near relation of the old
lady to whom the house belonged,
(I had forgotten to say it was a
widow lady’s house we took the
liberty with,) I found no difficulty in
laying my hands upon a tinder-box,
candles, drawers, and every thing
else. It was an exceedingly stormy
night, or I think we must have been
heard, for we carried a chest of
drawers out of the house and actually
beat them to pieces, not being able
to open them.


-1 knew that she had a considerable
sura of money, and I hoped we had
found it, however it turned out to be
a box of farthings ; and I was after-
wards exceedingly provoked to learn
that we missed three hundred guineas
in gold which the old lady had in her
lodging room. I also learned that
she had a presentiment that she
should be robbed, and made an ob-
servation to that effect the day be-
fore, one of many of those curious
anticipating feelings for which I
know not how to account, but which
have in several instances happened to
myself, when coming events have, as
it were, thrown their shadows before
them.
But to return to our adventure.
After helping ourselves to such things
as we thought of most value, and
such as could be most easily con-
veyed away on our horses, and drink-
ing the good old lady’s health in some


excellent home made wine, we mount-
ed our horses with four sacks filled
with many things of value. We took
a route so as to avoid the toll-bars
and public roads, and reached my
house just as the sun was beginning
to chase away the darkness which
had proved so propitious to us.
Having instantly buried all the
things at a short distance from my
house, my companions departed, and
all was soon ready for the reception
of those enemies of my profession,
I mean the constables, should they
pay us a visit. However, none came,
and though I was generally sup-
posed to be the person who did
the deed, no steps were taken to
make it out against me. This is one
of the very few exploits of the kind
I was ever engaged in, and as to
highway robberies, I never even
dreamed of coramiting one.
I had now accumulated a consider-


able sum of money, which I lent out
on note to several farmers in the
neighbourhood, some of whom from
fear or other considerations, were
glad to be on good terms with me at
all ventures. Something of this kind
has very often happened to me with
several of them, “ Well, Snowden,
how do you do ?” would say farmer
■ , meeting me in the street
towards dusk on a market day. “ Are
you going home to night ?” “ Aye
my lad,” was my general reply. “ 1
wanted to see you,” retorted the far-
mer, "I have just received the sum
of Fifty Pounds for some oats, 3
wish you would take care of it foi
me, and I will ask you for it agair
some day when I meet you.” I tools
charge of the money, and was evei
most punctual in returning it. How
ever, I could not help laughing al
the odd mixture of feelings that must
have dictated such a choice of e


banker. I dare say some of these
very farmers have lived to regret the
meeting with bankers not quite so
punctual in their payments as I al-
ways was in mine.
I remember seeing Mr. ,
my cock-fighting partner at York,
and I was well aware that he had
been receiving some considerable sum
of money. Meeting him towards
evening, I said, “ Well, master, if
you are going home to night, I’ll
ride with you.” We had to travel
pretty nearly the same road. He
looked alarmed, 1 thought, and re-
plied, that he would stay all night
and ride home in the morning. I
suspected this not to be true, and
sometime after I saw him mount his
horse. I instantly sent one of my
companions before me, and told him
to stop in a thicket after he had got
about two miles beyond Escrick ; at
the same time telling him he was to


spring out when he heard my whis-
tle. I followed the gentleman and
came up with him about half a mile
from the place in question. I was
riding a pretty quick pace at the
time, and called out as if in surprise,
“ Why, how now. Master, you told
me you were not to leave York to-
night.” 1 soon found he was in a
terrible taking, and he was busily
stammering out some excuse, when
we reached a woody part of the
road where my man was waiting. I
gave a shrill whistle, which was in-
stantly returned from the thicket,
and out my companion sprung. You
may readily conceive the gentleman’s
fear, he felt his money, and his life
too, were at my mercy. However,
I soon freed him from his fearful
perplexity. I simply said, “ Don’t
be so suspicious of me for the future,
you see it does you no good.” We
rode on together till we reached his


rouse, which lay in my way home.
[ there wished him good night; and
[ sincerely believe he would have
:rusted himself or his money with
ne ever afterwards, if occasion had
required it.
Things continued in this train for
a. considerable time, my family was
increasing in number and expence,
and I also was yearly becoming more
rich. The fear of me in my own
neighbourhood was on the increase
also. I knew r full well that I was
often watched, and in these cases I
took care to carry nothing to my
own house. Yet it is surprising how
practice and habit beget impunity
and fearlessness, and discovery and
conviction were becoming the last
things I thought of. I believe if I
had been transported fifty times, had
I returned to my own house, so
strong is the force of habit, I should
immediately have fallen into the same


courses. In my wife I had not a
person to check me, but on the
other hand, to spur me on, had any
incentive been wanting to my nightly
industry. She began to feel am-
bitious, wished for a better house,
was dissatisfied with the village school
at Spaldington, where our children
were educated, and even dreamed of
a governess and a Piano-Forte, which
she maintained I could as easily
afford as several of the farmers who
borrowed ray money. These things
never troubled my mind. My am-
bition lay in a contrary direction;
and grey-hounds and horses were
the things in which my fancy most
delighted.
There is scarcely any passion so
natural to man, as a love of follow-
ing wild animals ; and in my obser-
vations made in this distant land
among those who have; been expelled
from their native country, I have


enerally found their career of wick-
d lawlessness was preceded by such
ractices. The extreme severity of
he law to suppress that which is
iterwoven with the heart of man,
ias been productive of great moral
vil. The punishment was much more
han commensurate with the offence.
?he disgrace springing from it, and
he recklessness engendered by the
ociety of felons, have often utterly
irostrated and destroyed many a
vell-intentioned man. The laws of
ny country and her Squire-archy
iave no little to answer for on this
lead.
I was once busily employed in
soursing a hare when I was pounced
ipon by a Mr. . He came
mddenly upon me with so many
dolent denunciations, that I was for
i time really in a fright. However,
[ eventually recovered my recollec-
ion, and had the good sense to leave


him without giving way to any abu-
sive language in reply. I secretly
however, resolved to have my re.
venge, and that in a way at once ir
accordance with my profession anc
my own interest. I ordered two oi
three of the persons I could place
the most reliance in, to be ready tc
accompany me with their horses tc
Foggathorpe, the village in whici
I think the gentleman resided. 1
had long had a key of his granary
in which I knew he had recentlj
stored a quantity of wheat of the
finest quality, and for which the soi
of that village is much famed.
We had already been up to the
granary once with our horses, having
taken them loaded away, and se.
creted several sacks of wheat in {
wood a little from the turnpike road
and about three miles from his house
We had filled all our sacks a secone
time, and got them upon the horses


laving previously placed every thing
n the granary as we found it, or as
learly so as we could. I had just
hrown ray legs over my horse, then
tanding near the steps of the granary,
being the last of the party, when I
ieard the gentleman’s voi<;e, which
at once knew, for neither his early
abit of rising nor the tone of his
oice were unknown to me. It was
uite dark, and I proceeded with great
are on the way towards the high
oad, till I reached a gate about
eventy or eighty yards from his
louse. By some mismanagement on
ny part, I had no sooner passed
hrough the gate than it fell back into
ts place with considerable noise,
again heard his voice, but I made
;he best of my way with my load,
md I felt no little relief when I
oundmyselfin the Market-Weighton
urnpike road. Though I had no
r ery great opinion of the gentleman’s


courage, I felt quite sure he would
have used every endeavour to make
out the charge against me, had his
suspicions of what had taken place
been once roused. As to his follow-
ing me alone at that moment I had
not the most distant fear, for I knew
well the care he always took of him-
self. However, the whole affair pass-
ed over, I never heard that he missed
what we took away, and the reason
probably was, that he, at that very
time, had a large stock of wheat on
hand for the purpose of speculation,
as I afterwards learned. I remember
this wheat was of such singularly
good quality, that I sold it for the
great sum of one guinea and nine-
pence the bushel, a price I scarcely
ever*remember to have equalled.
It is somewhat singular, how few
farmers contrived to lay by money
in these dear time?, for which I
could never satisfactorily account. I


must not omit to observe, that I
thought the turn we played him,
was only what he deserved for his
treatment of me above mentioned,
I know of nothing which more readi-
y and certainly rouses the worst
passions of our nature, than an in -
ordinate fondness for the preservation
of game ; it engenders envy, hatred,
malice, and all uncharitablenesss.
should the gentleman to whom ]
dlude ever read these lines, he can-
mt fail to know to whom I refer,
md I hope sincerely, he will forgive
Qe the liberty I took with his grana-
y, for I can assure him I know of no.
ne for whom I even then entertained
more kindly feeling.
The next thing that occurs to rme
worthy of remark, and which I had
ood cause to remember, nearly ter-
minated fatally for myself. I expect-
-1 a good booty from the infor-
lation I had previously received.
D


This was an attack upon the property
of two bachelors who resided in the
same house, in a village about a mile
and a half from Howden. The house
was very near the river Ouse, and we
had prepared a boat, to carry the
gains of the night down the river as
far as Swinefleet, this being consid-
ered, for many reasons, the readiesi
mode of moving it from the premises
and I had some friends in that placi
in whom 1 placed the greatest confi
dence. Between one and two o’clod
we arrived at the house, and wer
preparing all things in readiness fo
the business in hand. I was crossin
from the bank of the river over
garden, and so on to the back of th
premises. In my way I came to
piece of dead fence, over which I we
passing, and which gave a cracklin
sound under my tread. At that im
ment I heard a dog bark, and install
ly after a shot was fired from tl


upper part of the eastern end of the
house. I had my face at the time
rather turned away from the place
whence the shot proceeded, and I
received the whole of the contents in
my back and shoulders. I instantly
fell; and I well remember that I
thought all was over with me, as I
lay for some time with my head in
the ditch, and my feet upon the dead
thorns over which I had just passed,
and to which I attributed my mis-
hap ; for the night was so dark I
:ould not be seen, and the shot must
Slave been directed to the noise 1
nade in getting over the fence. As I
ay there I could distinctly hear a
whispering from a small door in the
md of the house, and I feared greatly
est the inmates should sally forth
md take me in my present defence-
ess state. With my head laid upon
he ground, the sensation produced
ipon me by the striking of two


o’clock by the church of Howden, I
well remember. All was now calm,
quiet, and dark; and I actually felt
the earth vibrate under my ear, as
the hollow bell threw over the land
its sullen sound. I have understood,
since I came here, that the savages in
the interior always resort to this
mode of listening, for the approach
of a friend or an enemy. But to re-
turn to myself again.
I at length contrived with great
difficulty to get upon my feet; and
with still greater exertion, and much
loss of blood, I reached the boat,
where I found my men in great con-
sternation and alarm. One of then
pushed the boat adrift, and the tid<
soon carried it away with the w aters
They then supported pae at a slov
pace to Howden where I arnve<
almost in a state of insensibility, fron
the combined effects of pain and los
of blood. By my desire they took m


:o the house of a medical man of my
icquaintance, and knocked at his
loor; he soon came down, and with-
mt asking a single question, stripped
ne ; and during the night he extract-
id no fewer than thirty-eight large
hot corns from my back and should-
rs.
I cannot even now recal the agony
suffered, without a shudder : and
ay general health and strength never
ecovered from the shock I received,
remained secluded for a considera-
le time, but thanks to the attentive
are of my wife, and my own sober
abits, for I never was an habitual
runkard, I speedily was able to get
ut again. In all my night excursions
fter this adventure, I employed the
reatest circumspection.
I may here add, what few ever
uspected was the case, that I was
y nature a great coward ; but I am
ot aware that I was ever guilty of a


premeditated act of cruelty. Nor do
I remember scarcely ever to have
been out in the dark, without feeling
an undefined dread of something, and
for which I am even now unable to
give a good reason, I refer it to the
impressions imbibed in childhood,
and to the stories of ghosts and hob-
goblins I then heard from poor old
Nathan of the hall, who had told his
tales too often not to be a strenuous
believer of them himself.
But mine were not fears of dark-
ness only, for I had never that manly
courage which many men I knew
were possessed of. I gave sever al
instances of this during my life, tc
my no little discredit, and in mor«
ways than one ; for when I did not
on the instant resent an affront, frorr
a want of courage to do so, it nevei
failed to be hinted that my revengf
would be poured out in the secreci
of darkness, an imputation whicl


was entirely unworthy of me. On
the contrary, my disposition was al-
ways too forgiving, even towards
those who had without provocation
done me an injury.
Indeed, my countenance and out«
ward appearance betokened accurate-
ly my inward dispositions. I w'as tall
and large limbed, but neither clums-
il\ r nor powerfully made. I speak now
ot forty years of age; for sufferings,
mental and bodily, have entirely
changed my face and figure. My
hair was light, my eyes a blueish
grey, my countenance round and
somewhat florid. In my looks I al-
ways fancied that I resembled two
men of no little celebrity, I mean
Sir Waiter Scott and William Cob-
bett, who certainly bear a considera-
ble resemblance to each other. But
this may be my vanity, for the best of
us are not free from it.
In my manners boisterous, and in


tone familiar with all, and overbearing
with most. However, my general
appearance promised any thing but
cruelty and dishonesty ; and, thank
God, no one can charge me with the
former, whatever may be said of the
latter.
I must, however plead guilty of
one or two acts of apparent cruelty
towards my horses, but which rather
rose from the necessity of self-preser-
vation than from any other cause. It
has often happened to me, for the
purpose of reaching a given place by
a certain hour of the night, to be
compelled to strain my horse to the
full extent of his speed. I knew so
well the general opinion entertained
towards me, that I felt I must find
the greatest difficulty in clearing my-
self from any thing like a reasonable
suspicion of any crime.
I distinctly remember once having
upon me a considerable sum of money.


and I was riding at full speed upon a
narrow strip of green sward by the
road side, which was nearly covered
by the extended branches of the trees,
Jhe moon was shining beautifully
through them, and in contemplating
her I felt a soothing calmness spread
aver my soul, which I cannot well
iccount for or explain the cause of.
vly musings were suddenly cut short
)y a deep-drawn sigh from my horse,
hen a slight shudder, and the next
noment he was dead under me. I
:ned like a child, I raised his head,
mt all in vain, no trace of life re-’
nained.
By the moons rays, which at that
nstant shot through an opening in
. dark beets’ fir immediately over
ny head, I saw the film of death
apidly spread over his eyes, and
,lt his limbs stiffen under my grasp,
had to travel several miles on foot,
retty well loaded, and through a


very lonely and suspicions part of
the country. However, 1 reached
the house of one of my friends
towards morning, to his no small
astonishment, he thinking me fifty
miles distant in a different direc-
tion. .
My horse \yas soon recognized;
and had any robbery been perpe-
trated within a reasonable distance
of the place where he fell, of course
it must have been done by me. fhe
common question of the whole neigh-
bourhood was, “What had I been
doing ?” however, this never trans-
pired. I ever afterwards tied a piece
of raw beef round the bit of my
bridle, when about to make hard use
of my horse, and 1 always thought
it afforded him considerable help. I
need not observe that this was done
in imitation of poor Dick 1 urpin,
whose history is infinitely better
known than mine can ever pretend
to be.


I had now -lived in perfect security
for a long time. I could enter any
corn-chamber and granary in the
neighbourhood when I pleased ; and
from my numerous connection with
labourers and servants, 1 arlways knew
which were well stored. 1 found no
difficulty in getting rid of all 1 stole,
through the millers who shared with
me ; and who, by mixing or grinding
the corn as soon as they received it,
rendered a discovery almost impos-
sible.
On the night of the 25th of Octo-
ber, 1812, I felt a presentiment that
something sinister was about to hap-
3en to me. Few men have passed
:hrough life, particularly those of an
jxciteable temperament, who have
rot felt some boding of this kind.
. was seated in my .chair by the fire,
:aking my accustomed pipe; an in-
lulgence 1 never omitted the last
fhing at night, when this sudden


impression came over me. My wife
observed that something was the
matter, and questioned me on the
subject, However, as 1 knew she
would only laugh at me, I did not
tell her the cause.
Now long ago, I was once passing
opposite the house of a person I had
business with, he was from home,
and had to meet me that night. An
indescribable something fluttered a-
round my head, a kind of aerial
flutter which spoke not, yet made
itself understood. I felt afraid, I
knew not why, nor do I know even
now. By eight o’clock the follow-
ing morning, it then might be
ten at night, the person had shot
himself, in the presence of his family,
not twenty yards from the place
where this feeling or presentiment
came over me.
I was aware that some of my peo-
ple were going to a farm house in the


neighbourhood, the granary of which
was well stored with newly thrashed
wheat. However, as none of them
went from my house that night, and
they were not to bring their booty to
it, we all went to bed.
In the middle of the forenoon,
whilst I was listening to my daughter
Rose who was my favourite, she
suddenly looked up and said, in a
hurried tone. “Father, there are
several men coming to ’the house.”
It instantly occured to me that some-
thing had happened during the past
night, and that my forebodings would
not prove vain. However, as my
whole family knew that I had not
stirred out during the night, I had
little fear; and this circumstance even
led me to suppose that it might be
some mistake.
By this time the party had ar-
rived at the door of the cottage,
and one of them gave me to under


stand that he had a Justice s search
warrant, and that I Was their prison-
er. I submitted at once to be taken
into custody, and was immediately
secured. Some of the party then
began to rummage every drawer ant
corner of the house, amidst the very
voluble abuse of my wife. They
however, found nothing they cam<
to search for, which, as I soon learned
was some wheat stolen during tin
last night from a neighbouring far
mer.
On this information 1 felt con
siderable relief, conscious of my in
nocence ; hut my wife became per
fectly outrageous when the constabl
refused to take her word that X ha
never stirred over my threshold sine
six o’clock of the preceding evening
She, poor woman, swore she woul
take the law of them; threatene
writs, indictments, justices, and
know not what; and 1 verily believe


see would Lave inflicted summary
vengeance on the head of the con-
stable with the poker, so furious had
she become, from a consciousness that
Ihe accusation was without founda-
;ion.
However, in spite of all her threats
and rage, I was speedily conveyed
before the justice who granted the
warrant, and, on the oath of a per-
son who swore that he was going
along a road, near my house and
towards the farm-house in question,
about tw'o o’clock in the morning,
that he saw a horse and two men
returning from it, and that he was
quite sure I was one of them; my
commitment was made out for the
house of correction at Beverley.
All this took so short a time that
I scarcely attempted to defend my-
self ; and, indeed, I scarcely even
know now, how I could effectually
have done so. For I could only


bring the members of my own familj
to prove that I had not been out of m}
cottage, and of course, they woulc
not have been believed, against the
positive evidence of the witness wht
swore to my person, though he was
according to his own statement, fifty
yards distant from me, in additior
to this, at two o’clock in the morning
I now, for the first time, became
an inmate of a prison, an event ]
had always held in the greatest hor-
ror. As it was well known that ]
had plenty of money, I had verj
soon the proffered, and apparentlj
disinterested, assistance of an attor-
ney. My situation was maturelj
considered, and it was soon deter-
mined that a writ of habeas corpus
should be moved for, and that bai
should be put in for the purpose o.
taking my trial at the approaching
assizes at York, in preference tc
Beverley. ?


I was, in consequence, taken up to
London in custody, after the writ was
obtained, and my trial was appointed
to take place at York, principally on
this ground, as urged by'my counsel,
that my character was so notorious
in the East Riding of Yorkshire, that
no unprejudiced jury could tliere be
impanelled. The reader may be sure
that all this was done at no slight
Jxpence; but, perhaps, he will not
relieve me, when I assure him that
jy the time my counsel had received
lis fee for the approaching defence,
. had scarcely a shilling left in the
vorld.
During the period between my be-
ng set at liberty and my trial I roved
•bout the country, keeping up my
ourage as well as I could, and brac-
ing the business with as bold a front
s I could assume. However, under
11 this appearance of bravado, I suf-
ared much in secret; and I felt that
E


my career was cut short, perhaps 1
should say at an end, and that I must
infallibly be convicted, and in al.
probability transported for lite.
As the d&y of my trial approached
I felt more and more fearful of th<
consequences ; and my wife and fanr
ily tried in vain to rouse me to some
thing like confidence and courage,
bad recourse to ardent spirits to giv
me an artificial and momentary bold
ness, but I always sunk afterward
into a more overwhelming desponden
cy. 1 thought at one time of abscond
ing, and leaving the country fc
America, but my wife, conscious (
my innocence herself, felt satisfie
that she could bring others to a sim
lar conviction.
The March assizes of 1813 i
length arrived, when I gave myst
up to the gaoler of the castle, and
was soon placed in the dock. M
eyes were cast on the ground, and


for a time felt perfectly stupified ;
however I at last raised them to the
objects before me, and the first that
caught them was the judge himself,
then the counsel, and then the im-
mense crowd of spectators who had
assembled to hear my trial. I was
soon calm enough to discover in the
gallery the faces of many persons I
knew, and I endeavoured to put on a
forced courage by nodding familiarly
at them, and by appearing to be ut-
terly careless of what was going for-
ward.
The indictment was read over to
me, and I was called upon to hold up
my hand, and plead guilty or not
guilty; and though I uttered the
latter with a loud voice, it was with
a full conviction that my doom was
sealed. I felt, and I suppose all per-
sons similarly circumstanced feel the
same, that not only the assembled


people, but that the whole world had
combined to destroy me.
The facts above narrated were sta-
ted shortly to the jury. The witness
swore to my person, and accounted
for his being there at that hour,
naturally enough, by stating that he
had been to visit his sweetheart. The
farmer swore to having missed the
corn on the night in question. Though
my counsel tried to confound the first
witness by fierce looks and bullying
questions, and by dwelling upon the
impossibility of his being able to swear
to a person at the distance of fifty
yards, and at two in the morning;
yet he stuck to his oath immoveable.
I was asked what I wished to say,
and all that I could state was that I
was innocent; that I was in bed at
the time, and that all the family knew
this to be the fact. My wife was
anxious to speak for me, but my


counsel insisted upon her holding her
tongue, which she at last consented
to do, on his assuring her that she
would do my case more harm than
good. The jury without the slightest
hesitation found me guilty, and the
judge at once sentenced me to be
transported for the term of seven
years.
Thus after committing a thousand
crimes of a similar nature, not one of
which could be brought home to me,
I was found guilty upon a charge of
which I was as innocent as the judge
on the bench. This is a very common
occurrence with notorious offenders,
making good the proverb that if you
wish to hang a dog, you may soon
find a rope. Thus the notorious, fight-
ing Fitzgerald, after committing
many murders, was hanged for killing
a man he never saw; and so on of a
thousand others.
I was immediately conveyed back


to my cell, and a few days afterwards
I was forwarded to the hulks. 1 hough
at this time myself and family threat-
ened and thirsted for revenge, yet
now I acquit all concerned of acting
otherwise than upon evidence which
it was impossible for one moment to
doubt. Let my case be a warning to
jury-men and judges, and let me assure
them, that the innocent are often pro-
nounced guiltv with all the solemnity
of legal research and investigation.
A party of us were conveyed from
York to London by the coach, chain-
ed and pinioned together with bars of
iron. I was utterly disgusted with
the recklessness and heartless villany
of my companions in misfortune.
They had no one motive for amend-
ment, but were the very scum and
outcasts of society, whose neglect of
them they avenged by disgracing our
common nature. Surely some means
may be hit upon in a civilized country.


to diminish the frightful number of
those whose only object i& sensuality
and sloth, to be arrived at through
the medium of robbery and murder.
From the most exalted, to the last
link in the chain of animated nature,
there is not a greater disparity than
between a virtuous and a corrupt
mind.
Viewing the dishonesty, the preju-
dices, and the hatreds of mankind, 1
have always wondered how any bond
sufficiently strong could be formed to
bind men together in a state of socie-
ty ; and yet I do not think that the
agricultural population, speaking of
the neighbourhood in which I lived,
deteriorated and went back during
the thirty years in which I had an
opportunity of being acquainted with
it. The contrary was the case ; but
the progress by no means kept pace
with the large towns, and I am per-
suaded it can never do so. The uni-


versal dependence upon the poor's rate
has done much to tame the energetic
and independent principle of action
of the labourer ; but I must still hold
him to be a more civilized being than
his representative in the by-gone
generation.
Poor human nature is never in the
right, if nursed and assisted too much
she degenerates into weakness and
imbecility; if neglected too much she
sinks into the abyss of barbarism.
Thus human nature is ever in error,
or liable to be so, just like a drunken
man on horse back, if you steady him
on one side, he immediately loses his
balance and falls on the other.
In the midst of such reflections
and regrets for my past indiscretions,
with a consciousness that it was now
too late in life to retrace my steps,
and with a hope dead within me, I
reached the hulks. In this miserable
banishment I passed six years, embit-


:ered by the most dreadful account
)f my family, every member of it,
:ven in the remotest degree, having
ransgressed the laws of his country,
md was then undergoing, for his
'ffences, the punishment awarded to
dm. Could hope, under any form,
mve presented herself to me, I felt
hac I might have been a reclaimed
nan, but I could not catch the most
iistant glimpse of her. My years
lassed on in the midst of misery the
nost distressing, till they at last came
oan end. 1 obtained my discharge
>r paidon, a short time before the
ixpiration of my full term, for I had
ieen guilty of no violence, or inso-
ence, or excess, since my arrival.
I left this abode of vice and misery
vithout a friend on the face of the
;arth, and unconscious where to find
:ven a momentary place of refuge,
ft'here are many unfortunate indivi-
duals, who, had they house or em-


ployment to fly to, after having under-
gone their periods of punishment,
would be glad to betake themselves tc
habits of honesty and industry. But,
unluckily for them, they are turned
out without a refuge to resort to, and
necessity, and not inclination, drives
them to the commission of fresh
crimes.
As to myself, I returned to Spald
ington but the change which mj
worldly prospects and circumstances
had undergone, was in the extrerm
overwhelming. Some of these misfor
tunes 1 well knew, but to others
was an entire stranger, and I canno
at this day lay blame to any one bu
myself for them. My evil exampl
pointed out the way of lawless depre
dation to my children, in character
so legible, that they could not fail b
read and study them.
The farmers of the village ha<
thought it right to clear my cottag


■ f every one connected with me in
t. ame, relationship, or blood. Could
0 object to this step, absolutely ne-
t, issary towards putting an end to
diy establishment, then extended
d irough the neighbourhood in every
s ind of ramification, and in every
k lr iety of connection ? It has often
icurred to me that step ought
•) have been taken long before, and
f iey had the will to do it, but coward-
s e restrained them.
Many a nest of rural plunderers,
ten remaining for years the terror
id annoyance of a whole district,
ight thus be rooted up at once : and
know that in all cases the reason
hy they are not destroyed is a
iwnright cowardly fear, on the part
those whose duty it is to suppress
lem. This fear is groundless; fori
ive alw'ays observed, that the cou-
ige and overbearing of the villain,
e in exact proportion to the fears


he can inspire, and fortunate it is fo:
society, that few rogues are possessec
of any real determination. The trin
cause may be, that men who are h
the commission of daily crime, are ii
daily dread, and the .feeling of fea
always upon them, in time become
habitual, undermines their nature
courage, and settles into a secon
nature.
Of any thing like a protecting pc
lice, in the rural districts of Englam
there is none. Ihe constables an
generally speaking, old women,
have known in more instances tha
one, when the constables has bee
sent for in great haste, to quell son
serious riot or disturbance, the ai
swer returned has been that he cou
not come himself, but that he In
sent his staff by the bearer. T 1
probability was, that you saw tl
insulted staff thrown out of the wi
dow, instead of winning to itsi


hat reverence and respect which a
ertain nobleman, on his death bed,
icld to be due to the crown of
England, and whose last admonition
o his children was, that they should
neel down to it, though they saw
: hanging from a bramble bush,
here is no country in Europe, as
ir as I can learn, so utterly un-
rotected against sudden disturbance
nd commotion, as the greater part
f the agricultural districts of Eng-
ind.
These observations though form-
ig no part of my own history, are
rawn from me by the desire I feel
f making any atonement in my
ower to my injured country, but
ad that country possessed any thing
f the kind I recommend, the mani-
)ld injuries I inflicted upon it, during
long course of years, must neces-
irily have been stopped in their com-
encement.


On treading once more what
had so long called my own threshhol
I felt most keenly the pang of tl
outcast. The curse of Cain was ver
ly on my head and in my heart,
was with feelings I will not attem]
to describe, that 1 took a final far
well of Spaldington, never to see
more. For I had returned to xr
home, where I had reared a lar<
family, and when I asked, “ Whe
are they ?”
“ An echo answered, ‘ Where are they ?’ ”
I left the door of my cottage, f
the last time, utterly unconscious
the course I took, or whither
direct my steps. It was a fine evenii
in the month of October, after 01
of those warm days, which as
were, outlive the summer. Ihi
unknowingly wandered on the ro;
towards Market-Weighton ; and
have no remembrance of what pass
between the time of leaving t


threshold and about two o’clock in
:he morning, when I found myself
laid under a hedge at a short dis-
:ance fromjbulney Bridge. A sud-
Jen flash of lightning brought me
it the same moment to a sense of
ny misery, and to a knowledge of
;he place where I was. A kind of
:hrill of horror came over me, for
found myself lying in the inclo-
sure, and almost on the very spot
m which I had always understood
he house of the celebrated Peg
?ife to have been. All the dread-
ul tales connected with this singular
jersonage at once occurred to me;
ind her numerous acts of cruelty,
jerfidy, and dishonesty, were vividly
n view before me. I had never pass-
id, even in my proudest days, this
r ery spot, without some feeling of
tread for the many atrocities with
vhich time had blacked her memory ;
nd I leave the reader to imagine


what my sensations now in
my present helpless, destitute, and
forlorn position. I ran from the place
which tradition had rendered rife
with its many robberies and murders,
as if I had at my heels the celebrated
leader of this once lawless band, and
I did not feel entirely free from ap-
prehension, till I had entered the
town of Market-Weighton.
Peg Fife and her gang have *ett
behind them a fame, black in the
annals of cruelty and crime, and
holding a more powerful grasp on
local wonder, by the circumstance o\
a bold and bloody woman being at
its head, and the directress of all its
movements. What her fate and his-
tory really were I never knew, bu
they were only the more dreadlui t(
my imagination, in the obscuritie
through which my mind beheld them
for herself, her house, and her ex


3loits, had long since become the
heme of tradition.
• s P ell of fearful curiosity still
)mds her memory to the labourer’s
0 tage and to the winter fire-side
f the farmer; but these legendary
editions, and the croft still bearing
er name, are the only traces of her
ast existence known to the present
eneration. There is nothfng To
onder at in the multiplicity of hea-
len gods, goddesses, and monsters,
mch the perverse and superstitious
genuity of man, can coin out of
>7 act, in the least degree of a
irker or brighter shade than the
dinary acts of mortality.
1 felt at a great loss where to fix
to what object to turn myself for
ivelihood and bare subsistence. As
my children and connections, they
re scattered in every direction, and
the most part undergoing the
aishment due to their crimes.
F


My son, George Dunhill. as hand-
some a young fellow as ever stepped
upon shoe-leather, had been trans-
ported . His spirit could ill brook the
slavery inflicted upon him, and he
was executed at Hobart I own, it
Van Dieman’s Land, ihe crime foi
which he suffered I could never dis
titictly ascertain. Over his fate
now shed the unavailing tear of re
gret, rendered a hundred-fold bittere
by the upbraidings of my own con
science, for the example I had se
him. .
My daughter, my favourite daught
er, Rose, had been committed, an
sentenced to confinement in Yor
Castle. During her imprisonmen
she was delivered of a bastard-chib
what Its fate may be, heaven aloi
can tell. fehe was visited in tl
Castle by a gentleman from Howde:
for the purpose of h
some assistance in her necessity


situation. This I have understood
she indignantly refused; holding up
her new-born babe to his*gaze, she
said, “ See, he has hands to help
himself, and if ever there was a true
born rogue, here he is.” Thus, like
Hannibal towards Rome, was this
poor child devoted from its earliest
infancy, to war against all the settled
institutions of society.
After her release from York, the
reader will readily imagine, from this
anecdote of her, that she would speedi-
ly fall into another scrape. This
soon happened, she was committed
to Wakefield house of correction,
again tried and found guilty, and I
have never since heard of her. She
had cohabited with two different
men, both of .whom passed as her
husband. Thefe names were Con-
aer and M’Dowell, and they both
have been transported.
My daughter, Sarah Dunhill, after


having been confined in York Castle,
was tried at the East Riding Sessions
at Beverley, and imprisoned one year.
She was subsequently tried at the
Borough Sessions at Beverley, for
picking the pocket of a gentleman,
whose name I understood was Schol-
field, and stealing from him a con-
siderable sum of money.
During her trial she made a moving
appeal to the barristers present, sta-
ting that she had always found them
her best friends, that their ingenuity
had often assisted her in the hour of
need, and she yet reposed faith in
their kindness, and proudly left her
honesty and honour in their keeping.
The recorder startled into momentary
confusion at the energy and nature
of her appeal, speedily assumed his
wonted dignity, and inflicted on her
the doom of the law. She was at
this time residing in Hull, and had
come over to Beverley Fair that morn-


ing for the purpose of depredation.
For this offence she was transported
for the term of seven years, and is
suffering her awarded punishment.
She had three husbands, named Wil-
liam Rhodes, James Stanhope, and
James Crosslaud, all of whom were
severally transported.
My son, William Dunhill, was
transported at York Assizes for the
terra of fourteen years. He, poor
fellow, died immediately on his ar-
rival at New South Wales. He was
the most promising of my family, and
with different examples before him,
and good advice, he must have prov-
ed an ornament to society.
Robert Taylor, a son of my wife,
by a former husband, and who had
lived under the same roof with us
for several years, was also transport-
ed. I think I omitted to state, that
my wife was a widow at the time of
her marriage with me, and that her


name was Taylor. Her husband
though he escaped the law s retribu-
tion, did not the less meet that ol
his demerits. He was shot in attempt-
ing to commit a robbery a short time
before I married her, a circumstance
which was not known to me, anc
which she never mentioned.
As to my wife herself, she also was
transported, after having been the
contriver of innumerable depreda
tions, and the main cause of thosi
fatal events which happened to her
to myself, and to our family.
A robbery committed at Howden
was readily traced home to the in
mates of my house, suspicion at one
fell upon them, and the furniture
watches, ■ coins, and many othe
things stolen, were found upon m
premises. But as this, and man
other connected with then
happened during my absence, and c
I never saw several of the membei


of my family afterwards, I am the
less particular in narrating them,
from my extreme anxiety that nothing
should appear in this short history
of myself, for which I cannot vouch
with all the sacredness of truth.
As an eye or ear witness of all I
have stated, I cannot be mistaken ;
and wishing above - all things that
my reader should have a faithful and
exact account of myself, I pass over
with brevity all that occurred during
my first term of transportation. On
my return, as stated above, I found
my cottage occupied by another
family, and my own children and con-
nections dispersed in all directions,
and for the most part without any
power of holding communication
with them, had I ever so anxiously
longed for it.
Under these circumstances, I now
for some time took up my abode in
Hull, and conducted myself with


great propriety; but the feelings o
loneliness and distress never for on<
moment deserted me. Unavailing re-
gret for the past, and hopelessness
for the future, appeared to be m 3
fixed and immoveable fate, and s(
miserable did I find myself, that !
began to wish for any change, deem-
ing that none could be for the worse
By degrees I formed new connec-
tions, but these were principally ii
Hull and in Lincolnshire, on the op
posite side of the Humber.
This noble river, with its tributar
streams, the Trent and Ouse, is oftei
present to my imagination. I cai
now entirely overlook its muddy am
warpy waters, and, in memory a
least, fancy them not less pure tha;
the blue ocean on which my wear
gaze too often at present rests. Man
persons wander here and there, fc
scenes of beauty, but numbers c
those villages rising above the norther


banks of these rivers, present reaches
of wood, hill, and water, surpassed
by none, and equalled by few of those
of which we hear so much lauda-
tion.
But to return to my associates, by
whom I was soon led into the com-
mission of fresh crimes, and justice
had become so well acquainted with
my person, that crime was speedily
followed by detection, Indeed I had
now become unsettled and reckless,
and I almost felt a wish to leave my
native land for ever. I had heard
much of the easy lives led by the
convicts in New South Wales ; and,
moreover, some members of my fami-
ly were already there, and I felt im-
pelled to make an endeavour to join
them.
I had not long to wait for the
gratification of this wish, for I was
soon traced to the commission of a
paltry crime, I was apprehended,


tried, and convicted; my charactei
did the rest, and readily procured foi
me that banishment from England
on which I had set my heart. M>
trial took place at a district Quarte
Sessions in the north of Lincolnshire
in the gaol of which I was only de
tained a few days, when, with severa
others, I was transmitted, pinionei
and loaded with irons, to London
there to await a ship to convey me t
Botany Bay.
It was a cold bleak morning whe
I was put upon the coach in th
court yard of the prison, before day
light, with the rain and sleet falling
in abundance. The coach remaine
half an hour or more within the yar
of the prison, till all was in readiness
when the gates was thrown opei
and we commenced our inauspiciou
journey. I cannot at all describe th
feelings of loneliness and of heart
rending distress which came ov(


ne at this moment, in which I felt
;hat 1 was rushing from certain mis-
ery to something that might be even
still worse, and yet in my despair, I
’elt a clinging to existence. I have
never met with, —nay, I have never
heard of a bad man who could look
ieath unflinchingly and coolly in the
face.
On ascending the first rise of the
ground in our journey towards Lon»
don, a breeze from the north suddenly
sprfihg up, which scattered the loaded
clouds, and the sun burst forth in all
his glory. There appeared before me,
as if a veil had been taken off the
earth by magic power, a wide-spread
picture. The Humber, glorying in
its Scythian name, rolling to the
ocean its mass of waters ; and in the
distance, the winding Trent and
Ouse, stealing onward like two wily
serpents; and I could just discover
the broad expanse where they became
united.


. The beautiful Lincolnshire hills c
my left! and the still more beautif
hills, dales, and woods, of my ow
native Yorkshire to the north, lei
their charms to form a landscape
never saw equalled, and in castin
my last lingering gaze upon it, Ife
that the inanimate beauties of creatio
must now to me for ever be a blanl
1 strained my eyes to catch as muc
of it as I could, feeling the prospeci
as it were, a part of myself, an
necessary to my very existence ;fo
there it had commenced, and littl
at one time did I think, at how grea
a distance I was doomed to end it.
Amidst a thousand bitter refiec
tions which crowded upon me, whils
in full gaze upon the landscape unde
me, the coach suddenly descended !
hill, and my native county and iti
rivers, were blotted from my sigh'
for ever.
I neither saw nor heard any thing


ill we reached London ; and I have
ow no clear remembrance of our
nival, of the time I passed there, of
ur embarkation, or of anything that
appened, till roused to consciousness
y dangers little apprehended, and to
ie, of a nature entirely new.
Half dreaming and half sleeping,
with the home of my youth flitting
efore me and thoughtless happiness
nd innocence, once more my lot,
nd the ship moving onward in the
diddle of the wide Atlantic, —I heard
, solitary shriek, now repeated from
nany voices, and immediately after-
wards, the distinct and dreadful cry
•f fire. The horror of our situation
annot well be conceived, for we were
ill under hatches, which were locked
md bolted, and the only prospect
jefore us was certain suffocation. I
icard many hasty steps and much
loise above my head, but I could
rather nothing distinctly, in conse-


qnence of the fearful cry of horrc
from those by whom I was surround
ed.
The captain of the ship, howeve:
with a prompitude and consideratio
that proved him a humane man, ir
stantly ordered the hatches to h
opened, and we were all immediate!
upon deck. The night was dreadful!
dark, but many minutes had nc
elapsed, before we were crowde
together in one place ; order was re
stored, and by the assistance of th
male convicts, under the direction t
the sailors, the fire was soon subduee
We were kept on deck till day-ligh
and the fear of instant death, di
more towards rendering us weh
behaved and submissive, than all th
threats, bars, and bolts, of which w
were the hourly victims.
This horror past, we were ne?
assailed by a tempest, from which vt
escaped with all the fears of a speed


leath ; and during which w T e were
dosely imprisoned below, from a
lotion that we might in the confu-
sion, endeavour to make ourselves
masters of the ship.
Night went and came, and we at
length arrived safely at the place of
our destination. It is a common
remark, that we never do any thing
for the last time without some com-
-1( punctuous feelings ; those who have
e been transported, those who have been
j nearly burnt to death in a convict
o ship, and in short those who have
,] done and undergone many of the
,1 manifold miseries of this mortal state,
j ( know this to be any thing but true,
jj Arrived at Botany Bay, I was soon
jj disposed of, and commenced in good
j. earnest the life of a slave. Hard
worked, half starved, ill-fed, and worse
s clothed, such is the fate of hapless
convicts. Hope, which comes to all
j, men, comes not to him.


Let no one ever dream of anything
but wretchedness the mostdeplorable,
in the fate which awaits the object of
the laws punishment. Far, far, from
his native land, under a foreign sky,
the very stars of heaven are strangers
to him; the slaves by 'whom he is
surrounded, the lash that goads him
to his daily task, all speak to the soul
in language too forcible not to be
felt, that he has forfeited the protec-
tion of his native home, and that he
has disgraced the common dignity of
his nature.
The ever rolling cannon ball chain-
ed to the leg, the mutilated limb,
the branded fore-head, the fetter of
the galley-slave may be borne—for
there is commonly some one known
in early life to pity us, some regret
will at times bedim the eye of early
friendship, some pitying acquaintance
will occasionally cross our path; but
none whom we care to see, or who


are worthy of a thought, set their feet
upon this accursed soil.
Here I close the few reflections
which solitude has forced upon me,
and which spring naturally from the
events of my life. I take my farewell
of the reader, with a hope that my
example will not prove a useless
warning, and that all who fancy the
successful wicked man can be happy,
may no longer entertain that vain
delusion.
Unfortunate for human nature it is,
that refinement, civilization, misery,
and wretchedness, go on in one pro-
gressive movement. The only counter,
acting means are an early and moral
education; not the mere mechanical
routine taught at the ordinary class
of schools, for the poorer portion of
the community, but schools where
duties public, as well as private, may
be learned, and the reasons why such
duties are due, from all and to all.
Gr


It is beyond my conjecture to know
whether this short life will be pro-
ductive of any useful purpose; but,
at all events, in writing it, I have
eased my mind of a heavy burden
and harm can happen to none by £
perusal of it. If it does not provt
that goodness and worth are the onlj
certain road to happiness, it goes fa.
to shew that vice, successful vice, n
the certain fore-runner of misery ant
wretchedness.
With one distant, lingering wisl
for my country’s good, —I wish thee
reader, a long and last farew r ell.


THE PRINTER’S POSTSCRIPT.
It is with much pleasure that the
printer is enabled to add the following
facts and information to the life of
SnowdenDunhill. They are given to
the public on the authority of a young
gentleman who has passed the great-
er portion of his life at sea, and who
had many opportunities of seeing and
knowing the subject of these pages,
and of becoming accurately acquaint-
ed with the course of life he was then
pursuing. This gentleman, though
young in years, has one time or other
been thrown upon the shores of


almost every country in the world,
and in the month of August, 1833,
he chanced to land at Hobart Town,
in Van Dieman’s Land. He is a na-
tive of this part of the kingdom, and
sailed at the time in a Yorkshire ves-
sel, a circumstance which immedi-
ately drew around them many o:
those patriots who had left then
country for their country’s good
and especially such of them a:
had passed their early years in th<
county from which the vessel came
No lover more delightedly satis
fied, looks upon a lock of hair
the magic half of the broken six
pence which he had divided wit
his fair r one, or indeed upon an
other memento or token of lov(
with the delight which the poc
convict with gloating eyes loot
upon a sail from his native land.
The ship had made good th
harbour and was now safely moor


ed when a flight of those poor
men instantly pounced upon her,
much in the same manner as a
steam-packet is invaded by those
troublesome and pertinacious fellows
who lay siege to the traveller’s
luggage. Amongst other persons
was a tall and stout man, already
stooping and bent from suffering
and privation more than from na-
tural infirmity, but yet with the
step and assurance of one who
had seen better and prouder days.
Having accidentally heard the gen-
tleman named by one of the crew
of the vessel, Snowden Dunhill
looked him in the face, and in-
stantly said to him, “ Is’t thou
one of sons of Howden ?”
This address was made with the
usual effrontery of the man, with the
utmost assurance, and in the rich-
est tone of his native Yorkshire.
This question being responded to


in the affirmative, the feeling part
of Snowden Dunhill’s nature in-
stantly overpowered him, and with
a remembrance of the past flash-
ing over his brain, he burst into
tears.
It has been, and truly, said,
that no man differs so much
from other men, as he often diff-
ers from himself. The ruthless
and abandoned man felt at this
moment, overcome by the feelings
of the past, a love —a cherished
love for those whom he had
plundered without mercy, and for
that country whose soil he had
been pronounced unworthy to tread.
Man, and the heart of man, is
verily an inexplicable compound
of good and bad —of mean and
great —of Deity and devil. At
this moment he probably felt as
great an abhorrence of his past


deeds as the most honest person
amongst those, who had been suff-
erers by his habits of spoliation.
This state of excitement did not
last long, and with it passed away
the little that was amiable or good
in this strange character, for the
course of life he was then pur-
suing manifestly proves that the
kindly feelings to which he lays
claim in his life, either had ceas-
ed to exist, or were but the pass-
ing dreams of a moment. No one
is wicked without an object, and
the most abandoned would rather
do a good deed than a malicious
one, provided the object in view
could thereby be as readily accom-
plished.
In external appearance he was
not very much altered. The bois-
terous and overbearing manners
of former years yet remained un-


softened and unrepressed by the
sufferings he had undergone. An
habitual stoop had bent down his
person, and had somewhat taken
away from the portly and blus-
tering gait of early life, in all ap-
pearance the effects of hard and
unremitting labour rather than of
natural decay. The small, gray,
quick, and piercing eye still re-
tained its cunning and prying cha-
racter. His dress was much the
same as that worn by him
before his departure from Eng-
land.
According to the account he
gave of himself, it seems he had
received his ticket of freedom, at
Sydney, two or three years before
this time, and upon the receipt
of it he immediately embarked
for Van Dieman’s Land, His wife
and a daughter were already set-
tled there, and his most anxious


wish was to join them as soon
as possible. This he had the
good fortune to accomplish, and
himself and his wife had been
living together at Hobart Town
from that time to the period when
he was met with by the gentle-
man who has so kindly furnished this
additional account of him.
The mode in which they ob-
tained a livelihood was of a na-
ture entirely new and strange to
two such persons, and not much
in character with their past lives.
His wife had acquired the repu-
tation of religion and sanctity,
and she was daily employed in
teaching a school. Her previous
life was not the best disciplined
for such an undertaking, but there
is no knowing to what strange
purposes we may be called upon
to devote ourselves in this world
of chance and disaster. The res-


idue of her time was employed
in making small pies, which Snow-
den Dunhill hawked about Ho-
bart Town during the day, and
his penny-pies were greatly es-
teemed both by old and young.
To what unlooked-for changes may
we not come at last! Behold
Sally Snowden, as she was com-
monly called in England, the in-
culcatress of morality, religion, and
honesty, to the rising generation
of Van Dieman’s Land. And
Snowden Dunhill himself a hawker
of penny-pies about the streets
of Hobart Town: once the bug-
bear and dread of the East Rid-
ing of Yorkshire; a name at the
bare mention of which the farmer
double locked his granary, and
trembled like an aspen-leaf on his
way home, at the sight of every
suspicious-looking bush, if by chance


he had stayed till night-fall on a
market-day.
Here is human mutation enough
to stagger the strongest brain.
We have seen Napoleon, the once
arbiter of the lives and destinies
of millions, eating away his soul
on the sullen rock of St. Helena.
The old world saw Dionysius the
tyrant of Syracuse, sink into a
school-master in his banishment
at Corinth, and become the bye-
word of fallen* greatness. We now
behold a Whig administration with
its mountebank Chancellor, sink
lower than the contempt from which
an unanimous people raised and
elevated them. But are all or
any of these mutations of fortune
so strange and wonderful as that
of Sally Snowden, the instruct/ress
of youthful virtue, and Snowden
Dunhill a vender of “penny-pies,
all hot, all hot!”


His heart still yearned' after his
native Yorkshire, and he expressed
many a wish, and many a half-
formed determination to recross
the ocean, and perhaps his pover-
ty and not his will restrained
him from doing so. He had now
sunk into habitual drunkenness,
a vice which kept him steeped
up to the very lips in poverty,
and which in all likelihood will
prove the means of keeping him
in a southern hemisphere. A
wife, a married daughter and her
children, would not, under more
prosperous circumstances, have re-
sisted w r hat the French so em-
phatically call the “ maladie du
pays.”
The privations and sufferings
he had undergone must have been
of a very severe character, and
must also have greatly injured
his constitution. To these suff-


erings he feelingly alludes in some
parts of his published life, and
they are not in all probability
exaggerated.
On the arrival of a convict
ship, selections are made from the
convicts by such persons as have
need of them. They are examin-
ed as to their capabilities for fill-
ing the situations for which they
are wanted, much in the same
manner as negroes are bought
and sold by the traffickers in
human blood, and their points and
qualities are inspected limb by
limb, and joint by joint, with the
cunning coolness which a York-
shireman scrutinizes a horse. A
small pittance is usually allowed
for ther£ clothing, in the situa-
tions to which they are sent, and
where the labour and degradation
of which they are the victims,
a character the most ap-


palling. Should it happen that they
become guilty of any serious irre-
gularity or dishonesty, towards their
masters, their fate is a penal
settlement. These settlements are
in the interior of the country,
and by the account we have of
them, of their miseries, their pri-
vations, and their wretchedness,
they may be fairly deemed pro-
totypes of the bottomless gulph
of perdition. From them the mis-
erable convict often flies into the
unsettled parts of the country,
as his only escape, where he is
usually starved to death, or roast-
ed as a delicacy and eaten by
the savages of the wilderness.
There was always a spirit of
great determination in the cha-
racter of Sally Snowden, with a
tinge of wild and religious fana-
ticism, which fitted her to play
the part of romance or heroism.


When her husband was found guilty
at York, as stated by him in his
life, she addressed, by letter, a
copy of the 109th Psalm to his
prosecutor, Mr. Barnard Clarkson
of Holme, and then a partner
in the Howden Bank. The charge
against him was that of robbing
a granary belonging to this gen-
tleman, situate at a short distance
from Foulney Bridge, and at no
great distance from Snowden Dun-
hill’s house. This singular epis-
tle is by many people looked upon
as a prophecy, for, in the language
of the Psalmist, in England at
least, “ His posterity is destroyed:
and the next generation has seen
his name clean put out.” His chil-
dren are far away, and “they are
seeking their bread in desolate
places.” “Another hath taken his
office, and a stranger spoileth his
labour.” How many more of the


maledictions of the wisest of mer
he may have undergone, or is nov
undergoing, it is impossible to say
bpt there are many who look witl
an eye of wonder upon the exac
fulfilment of the predictions, anc
especially now since Snowden Dun-
hill’s life has appeared, in which
he still continues to asseverate
his innocence of the charge. Thej
feel inclined to believe that “ the
mouth of the deceitful was openec
upon him, and that he fell into the
hands of unrighteous judges.”
As to Snowden Dunhill himself
the habit of drunkenness which hat
got the better of him, will in al
likelihood prevent his ever agair
seeing his native country. The
shrewdness and sagacity, however
which marked his character here
have not deserted him. On a re-
cent occasion he was questionec
along with others on a charge o


sheep-stealing, a species of crime
common in Van Dieman’s Land,
and the suppression of which has
hitherto been found impracticable.
With a discretion superior to that
of some Lord Chancellors, he was
too cunning to commit himself by
his loquacity, and all that the in-
genuity or bluster of the learned
counsel could wring from him by
reiterated questions, was the genuine
Yorkshire answer, “ I knaws nought
at all about it.” This has become
a proverbial expression in the coun-
try, when any one wishes to check
inquisitive questions, or to evade an
answer to them.
Two or three anecdotes con-
nected with his history are in the
knowledge of the person who adds
this appendix to his auto-biography.
A party of his gang had assem-,
bled together in the neighbour-
hood of Eastrington, for the purpose
H


of plundering a granary. One ol
them had lagged behind, and sta-
ted as a reason why he was sc
late in joining them, that he had
been detained at home by the
slaughter of his pig. The affaii
in hand miscarried, but by way o)
punishing the man who had kepi
them waiting for him, Snowden
contrived to dispatch a companior
to the man’s house, whilst he anc
the remainder kept him in unsus-
pecting conversation. On his re-
turn home, his pig had flown frotr
the hook, and had disappeared froit
his wondering, gaze.
Thus was the votary of St
Julian, the patron saint of thieves
at one and the same time punish,
ed for his want of punctuality ant
for his dishonesty, and whilst em
gaged in robbing another he li
terally could not contrive to saw
his own bacon.


On another occasion, and during
his absence from home, some of
his gang entered the house of a
widow woman at Spaldington, nam-
ed Blanchard and stole from it a bed
and bed furniture. Having become
acquainted with this circumstance
on his return, he compelled' the
men who had stolen the articles
to convey them back again; and
moreover, he reproved them sharp-
ly and feelingly for distressing a
poor woman, when so many per-
sons possessing this world’s super-
fluities might be found, and whom
it was almost a charity to ease of
some of them. Snowden Dunhill
always numbered this act amongst
his good deeds, and doubtless he
conceived that it covered a multitude
of bad ones.
I cannot abstain from naming here
a highly finished and complete
rogueish trick, and though it has


nothing to do with the life of
Snowden Dunhill, yet it is too clever
and unique not to be put on re-
cord. A young eloquent, and highly
accomplished man who had been
educated at Cambridge, and who
afterwards betook himself to Lon-
don, was often reduced to great
straits, from which he generally
contrived to extricate himself with
singular felicity. He there became
a member of one of the Inns of
Court, and a probationer of the law.
Once on a time he invited a mil-
itary friend of his to accompany
him to a dinner, at which he was
entitled to be present, in conse-
quence of being a member of a
certain society. They drove up to
the inn at which they were to dine
in a hackney coach, which had
no sobner stopped at the door than
it occurred to him that he had not
a shilling in the world. He hes-


itated not one moment what course
to pursue, but boldly pretended
that he had mislaid his purse, and
borrowed as much of his dining
friend as would pay for the two
dinners. He then prevailed upon
the landlord to pay the fare ofthe coach
upon the same plea, and moreover,
to put down the two dinners to
the account of a gentleman who
had the management of the feast,
and who looked after the arrange-
ment and expence of it. Thus,
by one lucky hit, he put a cou-
ple of guineas into his own pock-
et, he treated his friend with a
ride and a dinner, and got a good
dinner himself, by the exercise of
effrontery and assurance.
The reader may be further in-
formed that wide and extensive as
London is as a field for the exer-
cise of such talents, yet he con-
trived to make it too hot to hold


him, and he migrated to America.
He insulted a Frenchman who
called him to account. He fired
his pistol in the air, and shook
hands cordially with his antago-
nist, who asking him why he re-
fused to shoot at him, received
for a reply that he was a rascally
Frenchman and not worth powder
and shot. For this fresh insult
he was called to account on the
spot. He received the hall of his
antagonist, and fell lifeless on the
ground, murmuring thanks to
the rascally Frenchman for having
freed him from a more rascally world.
He was a gentleman without either
money or honesty, the most mis-
erable of all the miserable classes
of humanity. His rogueries, his
talents, and his history are fast
gliding away from remembrance,
and his name has already died upon
the tongues of men.


To return to Snowden Dunhill,
who was ever a quick and close
observer of the manners and habits
of those around him. One of his
observations I have often heard
repeated, and it may serve to shew
that the career of rural dissipa-
tion differs not much from that
of more fashionable and elevated
stations. “ Whenever,” he would
say, “I see a young country fel-
low dressed in a new red waist-
coat, I always observe that a watch
soon follows; and when he has got
the tw'o, a bastard child is sure to
be the next.”
Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
The rural “ Rakes progress,” a red
waistcoat, a watch, and a bastard
child! Verily, the cottage and the
palace, the peasant and the king,
differ but in name. How much
alike are the follies and dissipa-
tions of the world, whether the


man pursues his weary w'ay a-
mongst the clods of Spaldington,
strong and stubborn as they as-
suredly are, or whether he dis-
ports upon the flags of the most
fashionable street in London ! Hu-
man passion, human imbecility, and
human folly, are every way the
same, whether decorated by the
courtly dress of the fop, or shroud-
ed in the smock frock of the
rustic.
Our passions and our follies are
always running away with us,
without our being able or often
even willing to curb them. In
this respect they greatly resemble
the legs of certain a gentlemen of
my acquaintance, who from being
much on horse-back, or from other
good and sufficient causes, has
not at all times the best possible
command of them. He one day
dismounted from his horse near


the river and on the sloping de-
cent towards the stream. The decli-
nation downward, coupled with the
force of gravity acting upon him,
put the mortal machine in gen-
tle motion, which gathered addi-
tional velocity at every step, his
legs fairly walked and then run
away with him into the river, with-
out his power to controul them,
and in spite of his vociferous cries
to those around, to save him
from being run away with by his own
rebellious members. This was all
in vain, for they stopped not their
course till they had deposited their
owner in the river, whence the
trunk of the man was dragged
without further detriment than a
good ducking, and a determina-
tion on his part never again to place
an overweening confidence in his
own legs.
Happy is it for those whose pass-


ions run away with them, and who
repose too confidently in their fan-
cied power to controul them, if in
their hour of need they find a kind
hearted ferry-man ready to rescue
them in their perilous course !
On parting with the gentleman
who communicated the above facts,
and to whom this opportunity is taken
of publicly returning thanks and ol
expressing obligations, Snowden Dun-
hill desired to be particularly re-
membered to all his friends around
Howden. With a tear trickling down
his felon cheek, his countenance
vividly and feelingly depicted the lines
of that poet of rural life, who says
And, as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue,
Pants to the place fiom whence at first she flew,
I still had hopes, my long vexations past,
There to return—and die at home at last.


ANECDOTE OF TURPIN.
The robberies of Turpin and his
gang had hitherto been carried on
entirely on foot, with only the occa-
sional assistance of a hackney coach,
but now they aspired to appear on
horseback, for which purpose they
hired horses at the Old Leaping Bar,
in High Holborn, from whence they
set out about two o clock in the
afternoon, and arrived at the Queen s
Head, near Stanraore, at five, where
they staid to regale themselves. It
was by these means that "W ood, the
master of the house, had so good an
apportunity of observing the horses,
as to remember the same again when


he saw them afterwards in King
Street, Bloomsbury, where they were
taken.
About five o’clock they went from
the Queen’s Head, to Stanmore, and
staid there from about six until seven
o’clock, and then all went away to-
gether to Mr. Laurence’s, which was
about a mile from thence, where they
arrived about half past seven. Mr.
Laurence had just been paying ofi
some workmen, who were discharged
and gone from the house. On their
arrival they got into the sheep yard,
and met with a lad, whom they seized
and presented a pistol to him, Fielder
saying he would shoot him if he
offered to cry out; they tied his
hands, inquired what servants Mr.
Laurence kept, and who was in the
house, which they obliged him to tell
them. They said they would not
hurt him, but he must go to the door
with them, and answer, let them in.


and they would give him some money.
They knocked and the man servant
opening the door, upon which they
all rushed in with pistols in their
hand, crying out with horrid impre-
cations,how long have you lived here ?
and seizing Mr. Laurence and his man
threw a cloth over their faces, and
then took the boy, and led him into
the next room, demanding of him
what fire-aims there was in,the house,
and being told there was none but an
old gun, they went and fetched that,
and broke it to pieces; then took
Mr. Laurence’s man, and binding his
hand, led him to the room where the
boy was, and made him sit down
there ; and also bound Mr. Laurence.
Turpin cut down his breeches, and
they fell to rifling his pockets, out of
which they took one guinea, one
Portugal piece of thirty-six shillings,
about fifteen shillings in silver, and
his keys. They said the money was


not enough, that they must havi
more, and drove Mr. Laurence uj
stairs; where coming to a closet
although they had taken the ke]
from Mr. Laurence before, and hat
it in their custody, yet they brok
open the door, and took out fron
thence two guineas, ten shillings ii
silver, a silver cup, thirteen silve
spoons, two gold rings, and wha
they could find ; and in thfeir search
meeting Math a bottle of elder wine
they obliged the servants to drinl
twice of it.
They brought Mr. Laurence dowi
stairs again, and threatened to cu
his throat; and they put a knife t
it, as if they intended to do it, t*
make him confess what money wa
in the house. One of them took
chopping bill, and threatened to cu
off his leg. They then broke hi
head with their pistols, and draggei
him about by the hair of the head


Another of them took a kettle of
water of the fire, and flung it upon
him, but did no other harm than
wetting him, by reason that the maid
had just before taken out the greatest
part of the boiling water, and filled
it again with cold. After this they
dragged him about again, swearing
they would 'do for him,’ if he did
not immediately inform them where
the rest of his money was hid.
They then proceeded to make further
search ; and found twenty pounds in
a chest, which with plate, linen &c.
they packed up, then locked all the
people in the parlour, and swore they
would shoot every one they found
loose, when they returned, which
would be in half an hour.
