CHRISTIANITY AND
IN these days, when general and deep-
seated dissatisfaction with our
social conditions prevails, when,
consequently, all kinds of panacea
abound which look to an improve-
ment of these conditions from more
or less artificial arrangements, it
must have attracted the attention of
those whose aim in life is to gain a
true conception of and to live in
accord with Christ’s teachings, that
there is one economic and political
school which steadfastly proclaims
that the evils which attend our
civilisation arise from disregard of
Christ’s teachings, and that the only
cure for our social troubles is to be
found in bringing our laws into
harmony with them. That this
school of thought should exist, that
it should claim to be the only school
of economic and social reform which
is in accord with Christian teachings,
and that its own precepts aid in
their elucidation, is a phenomenon
certainly worthy of the enquiry of
all who profess and call themselves
Christians.
All these claims are made by the
Single Taxers. If these claims can
be maintained, if the Single Tax
principles will bear analysis from
every point of the Christian faith,
then at last we have a social creed
in which all Christians can and
ought to unite. For surely no
grander or more imperative task
could devolve on the followers of
Christ than spreading a knowledge
of His teachings with regard to
our social relations, and instituting
changes in our laws to harmonise
them with the principles laid down for
our guidance by Himself. The hoary
wrongs entrenched in our civilisa-
tion, securely as they may stand
against the philosophic attacks of a

few, must speedily be swept away
when confronted with an army, fired
with religious zeal, and bent, not on
compromise, but on fearlessly carry-
ing through what it has learnt to be
God's will.
The principles of a just social
system, the adoption of which would
have prevented the existence of the
social evils with which we have to
contend, and which, therefore, can
eliminate them from our society, are
clearly and unmistakeably set out
by Christ. Addressing the multi-
tudes and His disciples, He said,
“All ye are brethren, and One is
3 7 our Father which is in heaven.”
From the Fatherhood of God He
deduced the love of God to all men,
extending to the provision of their
material needs, making His sun to
rise on the evil and on the good, and
sending rain on the just and on the
unjust. From the brotherhood of
man, Christ taught that universal
helpfulness should exist between
men ; that we should love not only
those who love us, but all men. So
great a stress did Christ put on this,
that He lays down the principle
that God is far more concerned in
the relationship that exists between
ourselves as man and man, than to
the worship we pay him. While our
brother has aught against us, He
does not desire our presence at the
altar; “first be reconciled to thy
brpther, then come and offer Thy
gifts.” He will pardon us only as
we pardon others. The makers of
long prayers who rob widows’ houses
shall receive the greater damnation.
Lip service to God is treated by
Christ with scorn, while in service
to our fellow man does He see
Divine service—“ Come, ye blessed
of My Father; inasmuch as ye have


done it unto the least of these My that of the Scribes and Pharisees,
brethren, ye have done it unto
Me.”
Nothing is clearer than Christ’s
attitude towards, and remedy for,
the social problem —what we shall
eat, what we shall drink, and where-
withal we shall be clothed. He
taught, in the first place, “ Our
Father knoweth we have need of all
these things.” He who has pro-
vided for the fowls of the air and
clothed the grass of the field, how
much more shall He feed and clothe
us, who are so much better, the
the very hairs of whose head
are numbered. Accepting Christ’s
teaching as to the abundance of
God’s gifts to man, we may rest
assured it is not from lack of His
bounty that social distress exists
among us.
But if He, knowing our frame,
has so amply provided for our needs,
how is it we have among us this
general anxiety about the morrow,
many needing even the bare neces-
saries of life ? If the natural wants
of all are provided for, why is it
that large numbers cannot. get them
satisfied ? Christ’s reply is, “ Seek
first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness, and all these things
shall be added unto you.” In other
words, were righteousness enthroned
in our midst, these evils would not
exist. If social distress is here, it is
our fault, not the Creator’s, and the
remedy for its removal is the estab-
lishment of righteousness, or right
relations, between man and man..
The cause of social trouble, Christ
taught, is unrighteousness. The way
out is to seek first righteousness,
and blessed are they, He says, who
hunger and thirst after it. Of this
kingdom of God we read, “ A
sceptre of righteousness is the
sceptre of Thy kingdom.’ It is the
state of loving righteousness and
hating iniquity. It means God’s
will being done on earth as it is
done in heaven. Straightness or
rightness is English for the Greek
word which we translate righteous-
ness. Absolute straightness or right-
ness between men is what Christ
demands; not a mere formalism.
Unless our righteousness exceed
He has only denunciation for it.
We clearly see then that Christ’s
teachings laydown these principles:
The Fatherhood of God, the brother-
hood of man, and that all our mate-
rial needs will be satisfied if we seek
first the Kingdom of God in the
establishment of right relations be-
tween men. On these identical
propositions is the Single . Tax
founded. Single Taxers, therefore,
at the commencement of their en-
quiry into our social relations, ask
the pertinent question, “Is our
society based on these principles ?
Are our laws in accordance with
righteousness, the test of the right-
eousness of laws being that they run
parallel are in accord —with the
Fatherhood of God and the brother-
hood of man ? ”
The Fatherhood of God. The
Single Taxers believe that God, who
knows our needs, has not forgotten
us. “ The earth has He given to the
children of men,” whereon all may
work to satisfy their needs. As He
provides for the ravens, so has He
done for us. Not by putting the
food into our mouths, but by pro-
viding us the natural opportunities
to produce wealth, accompanied with
the injunction, “Go, work in My
vineyard.” The earth is the Father’s
Table, whereat He intends all His
children may find their daily bread.
Now, if God has provided the earth
for the equal use of men, the equal
right of all to the use of this gift
should be secured and maintained;
otherwise the Fatherhood of God over
all is ignored, and the brotherhood of
man rendered a mockery. Alas ! that
this blasphemy and mockery should
exist among us. We see the best parts
of the earth, to which all have equal
rights—for God has no favourites —
held by a select and wealthy few.
Multitudes have no right whatever on
the earth, and only exist here by
sufferance, through payment made to
certain of their fellow-creatures forj
right of access to land. While]
the birds have nests and the foxes]
have holes, to-day in the midst ofl
our civilisation are thousands of
dispossessed human beings who have
not where to lay their heads. With no




presence of theft—the taking of goods
compulsorily without rendering an equi-
■ talent. As landowners, these black-
mailers produce nothing, they simply
for certain considerations stand aside.
Clearly a man has the right to charge
another for the use of the result of his
labour, oe it shop, factory, or machinery.
But when asked by what right he
withholds land from others unless partly
or wholly supported in idleness at their
expense ; by what right he claims to
reap a share of others’ toil; by what
right he steals, the answer is, ever and
only—a legal right!
Christianity, however, has no
respect for legal rights which con-
flict with righteousness. It asks
where are Christ’s followers in
allowing such to exist at all, and
unhesitatingly calls upon them, in
seeking first the kingdom of God
and His righteousness, to unitedly
aim at the abolition of all laws in
conflict with His teachings. Every
immoral act on our statute books is
a scandal to Christendom, all the
more scandalous because all men
share in the sin of injustice legally
done, whereas injustice done with-
out warrant of law is only an
individual sin.
What men produce by their labour
is as much theirs against the State
as against the individual. What
comes to them above this is the
property of society and is ample to
meet its needs. Therefore the State
has no right to take from men the
result of their individual labour.
Yet it is doing this day by day by
our system of taxation, and society
in its corporate capacity is therefore
guilty of theft. Society, notwiths-
tanding that its function is to see
justice observed, steals in the com-
pleted manner—passively, in en-
abling landowners to take that to
which they have no right: actively,
by taking that to which it itself has
no right. *
Christ s teaching, when questioned
on the subject of taxation, to “Render
unto Caesar the things which are
Caesar’s,” conveys that there is that
which is the distinct property of
Caesar, which Caesar—the State
has produced, and therefore has a
A. & W. Bruce, Printers, <J34 Bourke Street, Melt>om
moral right to claim. All those, §
then, appropriating to themselves
land values are robbing Caesar.
Christ does not teach men are to
render unto Caesar the things that
are their own, and the State there- "n
fore, in demanding tribute from
the result of individual labour, is j
robbing every member of the com-
munity. We thus see that our social ,
life is honeycombed through with
theft, in the guilt of which we all
share.
From this immoral, anti-Christian t
foundation spring the evils which
adhere to our civilisation. Christ
tells us that grapes do not grow on
thorns, nor figs on thistles; that
corrupt trees bring forth evil fruits.
Theie is no charm here to prevent
the operation of this natural law,
and already we see land monopoly
bearing the same fruits in Australia
as in older lands, whence it is
derived. What they are is well
summed up by Cardinal Manning,
and should certainly spur us all, as
Christians, to make the cause of
land reform our own:—“ The land
question,” he says, “means hunger,
thirst, nakedness, notice to quit,
labour spent in vain, the toil of years
seized upon, the breaking up of V
homes, the misery, the sicknesses,
deaths of parents, children, wives,
the despair and wildness which
spring up in the hearts of the poor,
when legal force, like a sharp arrow,
goes over the the most sensitive and
vital rights of mankind. All this is t
contained in the land question.” \
These are the fruits which arise
from ignoring righteousness, and
enthroning theft. Everyone not
working for the uprooting of this
tree of unrighteousness [is fighting
against Christ, for “ He that is not
with Me is against Me.” Those \
who, by advocating charity and
other palliatives, aim at the avoid-
ance of attack on the root injustice
itself, are just as surely opposing
Christ, by not “ seeking first the
Kingdom of God and His righteous- **
ness,” and those only, are the true
men of faith who teach that in
seeking this one thing, all other
things shall be added unto us.
