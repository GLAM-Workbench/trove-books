A RAMBLE THROUGH THE SUGAR PLAN-
TATIONS IN FIJI
Outside oï¿½ Fiji itself very little is confessedly known of the
country'from an agricultural and but little more from any other point
of view. The footprints of the ordinary newspaper correspondent
are seldom to be found outside of Suva or Levuka ; and, as far as ad-
vancing the vital interests of -the country is concerned, his lucubra-
tions might equally well have been written in Collins-street. The
public in general are merely enlightened thereby as to the most
recent vagaries of the Government, or the latest news to hand of
further massacres in the Solomon Islands, of which, thanks to the
policy of our home and local authorities, there seems likely to be
a promising crop. But as regards the sources from which Fiji
derives its wealth nearly all that is written is from hearsay, unless
when some scientific gentleman or enterprising missionary writes a
book on the subject, which remains a dead-head at the circulating
libraries. I am not able to encroach on the province of the
first, nor, being an essentially secular journalist, am I desirous of
interfering with the work of the latter. Without further parley,
therefore, allow me to introduce myself as a humble rambler,
intent on learning something of the mysteries of sugar-growing and
manufacture.
Leaving Suva, the present capital, about the middle of April, in
a small boat, with three friends, representing severally the legal,
the commercial, and the agricultural interests of Fiji, I set my face
towards the stronghold, or rather freehold, of the latter section of
the community. Suva, I may here state, is built on the side of a
peninsula, the harbour and coast being protected by a coral reef
which keeps well out to sea, so that our journey was tolerably
smooth throughout. We had a crew of Kai Dolos, or hill men, all
converts, and rejoicing in strongly scriptural names, and pulling
and sailing soon brought us to Laucala Bay, into which the Rewa


River discharges itself by many a devious channel. We were fated
to find them a trifle too much so, as when we got there half the
bay was not more than a foot deep, and the course was indicated by
a few forlorn-looking posts put up by a non-reflective Dutchman,
into whose head the idea of crossing by night could never have entered.
For five hours we went round that weary bay, with no light to
cheer our path, becoming stranded ever and anon, our crew being as
often in the water as in the boat. The rain descended in torrents, as
it always does to benighted passengers in Laucala Bay. At length,
as we got comfortably wet, and the profanity of the company was
exhausted, the boat found a channel for itself, and soon after we
got into the river amidst a perfectly tropical deluge from above.
The crew, spurred on by all the eloquence we could muster, plied
the willing oar, and beyond running once into the thickly-wooded
bank, thereby occasioning the total destruction of the umbrella of,
and considerable discomposure to, the representative of the law,
who sat perched in the bows, nothing unpleasant occurred till we
were landed at the Rewa Hotel, ten miles from Suva. Arrived
there we found that the licence had been withdrawn, and so we had
to repair damages from our private stores, as best we could. The
morning ensuing was magnificent, and our craft sailed up stream
with a gentle breeze. Behind us, and separated from the hotel by
the small rivulet, was the half-concealed native town of Rewa, the
largest of its sort in Fiji, with the dwarfed spire of the Roman
Catholic church glistening in the sun. Beside this the large native
building?one of the largest of its kind?was just seen behind the
foliage. That belongs to the Wesleyans, who seem to be the most
popular amongst the natives, on account, most probably, of their
hymns. My friends told me that to this day the converts mix up the
old and the new beliefs in rather an astounding manner. The R. 0.
priest at Rewa is the oldest in Fiji and the longest resident, he
having come out in ?44.
The banks on either side, which were comparatively low at the
river?s mouth, gradually rose higher as we proceeded. Now and
then a planter?s house, with its attendant out-buildings, could be
seen, or a native canoe ?generally composed of a skeleton platform
rigged on a long hollow log, with a smaller one acting as outrigger,
the motive power being a couple of long poles?would cross our
path. We had an exciting race with two dusky belles, who proved
victorious, and made our defeated crew look a trifle blacker even
than Nature had created them. Occasionally an island in mid-stream


would be passed, the river widening in such places to something
like a quarter of a mile. The Rewa, it may be stated here, is the
largest river in Fiji. Passing Messrs. Stanlake Lee and Company?s
factory, with its tall brick chimney, we were soon alongside
of the Colonial Sugar Company?s head-quarters. As we did
not stay at the Colonial Company?s place, I mentally marked
it for a future occasion as we passed on. To the left, at the
junction of the WaiManu River, stands the WaiManu Hotel, a showy-
looking building, with a small dyspeptic steamboat close by, faceti-
ously termed the Go-ahead. She belongs to the hotel, and it is
a curious thing, as illustrating the affinity that may even pervade
dull matter for its home, that the Go-ahead can never pass the
Wai Manu Hotel, especially if there are passengers aboard, without
stopping. She either has a breakage somewhere or runs into the
bank, on which occasion the passengers insist that her name should
have been the Go-ashore.
On the same side of the Rewa, but on the other side of the
Wai Manu, stands the residence of Atikuila (pronounced Antekeela),
a daughter of Cakobau (Thackambau), and the widow of Uluvava,
a chief who held office under Government. Not far away, on the
opposite side, was our destination, a single house, flanked in the
distance by hills, with the intervening and surrounding land laid
out as a township. There is not much to say about the township,
which will be called Thurston?when it is sufficiently developed to
justify the baptismal rite?as a compliment to the Colonial Secre-
tary. The ground is well above high-water mark, and the soil slip-
pery, rather deep?in fact, the place is exceedingly promising, and,
what is more, fulfils its promises in every way. The site is a good
one, and apparently a great many people have seen it, even unto
purchasing blocks; and there is no doubt that by the time the gaol,
lunatic asylum, and newspaper make their appearance, the god-
father will have either become Governor-in-Chief or Archbishop of
the Fiji Archipelago. Nous verrons.
After a stay of a couple of days, I rejoined my legal friend at
Durnululu, a couple of miles further up, whither I had been origi-
nally invited. He was in a sad state of acute dysentery, and was
occupying a building erected in police precincts, he being a Govern-
ment officer. The magistrate was away on my arrival, but turned
up the following Sunday evening, in a state of great excitement on
hearing that a ? stranger ? was on holy ground, albeit as an invited
guest. All the inherent Nupkins blazed out in him next morning,


when he further learnt that the atrocious individual was a press-
man, and I had two hours? notice to quit.
My friend followed me, and for two days we stayed at a house a
short distance off, as I heard the great man was about to summon
me for trespass. Taking a canoe, some four miles further
up brought me to Mr. Leicester Smith?s Pioneer Mill.
After resting a night, Mr. Smith took me round his mill, and en-
deavoured to enlighten me as to its operations. As well as I can
remember, the cane is taken off the punt at the river side up a
tramway, and put into an affair something like a mangling machine,
save that there are three iron rollers, or cylinders, instead of two.
The juice is thoroughly extracted, and is pumped into the first of a
series of vats, where it is heated with hot pipes. In the next vat,
the scum and dirt are carefully taken off. Thence the juice passes
into three pans heated from underneath, by which a great percen-
tage of water is boiled away; after which it is again pumped into a
large heating pan, where it undergoes another heavy boiling at high
pressure, and thence into a wetzel pan, a peculiar-looking affair
which finishes off the process of vaporisation. Over the trough
into which the juice goes is suspended a kind of water-wheel of
hot copper pipes, two-thirds being out of and one-third in the juice.
This treatment results in a mixture of molasses and sugar, which is
put into an immense cooling vat. When quite cold, it is emptied into
a centrifugal machine. The interior of this machine is of fine wire,
and in the lightning rapidity with which it revolves, the molasses is
forced through the wire netting, and then runs away to a vat. The
sugar is found adhering to the wires, and is scraped off and put into
bags. This is first quality sugar, and if made properly is of a light
yellow colour; if the aesthetic white is wanted, water is added while
in the centrifugal. This may be a hint to the lovers of the more expen-
sive, but decidedly less valuable, kind. The treacle is re-boiled, and
then passes through the centrifugal, producing successively second and
third quality sugars. Fijian sugar, I may add, realises as high a price
as any in the market, on account of the extraordinary richness of
the virgin soil, and consequent high average of saccharine matter in
the juice, the cane seldom going lower than 9deg. by Baume s sac-
charometer. Mr. Smith does everything himself, with the help of
some 20 boys, his output for the last three years averaging 110 tons.
Just opposite the mill there is a church, school, and store. After
bidding farewell to Mr. Smith, I crossed the river and engaged a
man at the store to pilot me for five miles to Belmont. He was a


native policeman, but made no objection to carrying luggage, whichr
however, he baptised at the first stream we crossed. We passed
through a plantation belonging to Mr. Turner, and our path lay
thereafter over mountains and through a thickly-wooded country.
I did not wonder at the amazing fertility of the soil when I no-
ticed that, although the sun was right overhead, it was deliciously
cool all around, and even damp underfoot. Droughts are almost
unknown in Fiji. A swim across a river, and a short stay in a
native town, ensued; after which my conductor procured a
canoe, and took me down all safe to Mr. Storck?s, at Belmont?
so called from the bank rising abruptly as high as 60 feet.
Arrived at the house, on the summit of the hill, I was greatly
delighted with the magnificent prospect all around. Nearly
all the land on the opposite side of the river for miles up
and down, was cultivated for several miles back, [where a low
chain of hills traversed the horizon, with blue hazy mountains in
the background. The winding river, with the right bank more or
less steep, made up a splendidly picturesque panorama. The natural
products on Mr. Storck?s plantation were not less provocative of
admiration. Conducted by him, I was shown specimens of coffee,
tea, and cocoa plants ; more varieties of sugar cane than on any
other estate; and last, not least, the valuable cinchona tree, from
which, as everyone knows, the Peruvian bark is obtained. Mr.
Storck, who is an experienced botanist, came out to Fiji in the John
Wesley twenty-two years ago, with an expedition headed by Dr.
Siemen. The result of that expedition was an elaborate work on
the flora and fauna of Fiji, a copy of which I saw. I regret to
add that the work did not by any means repay the time and trouble
bestowed on it. Many of the varieties given there, accompanied
with magnificent coloured plates, are named after Mr. Storck, and
exhaustive as the work then appeared to be, many other varieties
were subsequently discovered by Dr. Siemens coadjutor, who re-
mained in the country, and finally settled down. Coffee seemed to
be his main hobby, and as the oldest planter in the colony his opinion
on the subject will be of value. He declared that, with fair care,
coffee would grow almost anywhere in the colony. His plants were
of but comparatively recent growth, as about two years ago his then
promising crop was destroyed by Government. This was done on
account of the appearance of the Hermilia vastatrix, which,
it is thought, had been brought from Ceylon in plants imported
thence. The hermilia is not by any means so destructive as the


phylloxera is to the grape vine, as in the former the leaves only are
affected by spores or animalculae, the appearance much resembling
iron-rust. The berries thus suffer indirectly through being deprived
of shelter and nourishment. But its widespread prevalence in Ceylon
for the last ten years has simply resulted in a decreased export-
Prompt, though mistaken, action was taken by the Government.
Several small plantations in w r hich hermilia had made its appear-
ance were destroyed; and one 300-acre block, belonging to Mr.
Fillingham Parr, was shepherded and doctored by the Government
for a twelvemonth, the result being the entire ruin of the estate.
A lawsuit was the consequence, and Mr. Parr obtained a verdict
against the Government?the amount, however, representing only
about one-tenth of the actual loss sustained. However, the destruc-
tion of Mr. Storck?s coffee naturally set him thinking, and the result
was that, after twelve months? incessant experimenting, a cure was
discovered, the efficacy of which, Mr. Storck assured me, is beyond
question. lam not at liberty to disclose the modus operandi; but,
as far as I can judge, a great era in coffee-planting seems to have
opened out. The Government is scarcely likely to take the matter
in hand; but, if the Ceylon Agriculturalist is to be believed, a cordial
welcome and fair field will be given Mr. Storck to demonstrate the
value of his discovery in Ceylon, whither he intends to proceed at
an early date. The price of purifying an estate is stated at ï¿½2 per
acre. I might add a v ord as to the cinchona, of which I saw
several species growing on the gentle declivities of the estate. It
takes two years before the precious bark can be stripped, and with
proper care a continuous supply is obtainable ?the profit, of course,
being very large. The tea and cocoa plants, although likewise in their
infancy, were also, in Mr. Storck?s opinion, progressing satisfactorily.
To make tea a success, extensive capital and experienced hands are
absolutely necessary; but, as it is, it is one of the possibilities of
the colony.
Bidding good-bye at length to my worthy host and his family
(odd to say, the little ones spoke nothing but Fijian, although as
fair as any European), I crossed the river, and, passing through one
of the Hon. J. Smith s plantations, made for the adjacent one under
the same owner, at which Mr. Storck?s brother was overseer. A
four-mile walk brought me to a well laid out estate, subdivided
into blocks, and intersected by deep drains. A 20ft. road runs
through the estate, at the end of which, fronting the river, stood the
manager s house, and several others for the labourers. Mr. Storck


?did the honours,? and then showed me around. What I was
chiefly struck with was the air of neatness and cleanliness percep-
tible, each of the half-dozen houses being well-built, well-drained
Fijian structures, the largest being the hospital?a cool, airy build-
ing. The men all appeared well fed, and laughed and talked
incessantly as soon as work was over. They were South Sea
immigrants?the most valued of all field labour. Rations for every
man are weighed out each morning?lolb. of kumalas or sweet
potatoes, or 71b. of yams?and entered in a journal kept for the pur-
pose. If the men get ill, the doctor attends them, and in his absence
the manager has a large stock of medicines to fall back upon. I
was informed that it was no unusual thing for the patients to be
ordered beef-tea and arrowroot. The day?s work is limited to nine
hours, or, if at task work, the ? boys? can finish in six or seven
hours, as they very often do. Their pay is from ï¿½3 to ï¿½5 per
annum, clothes being provided. The coolies whom I saw afterwards
are under different regulations. The plantation, in extent about
200 acres, showed the cane in all its stages of growth?nearly all
being the yellow Honolulu, the most prolific and best-paying
variety ; the price is 10s. per ton all round. A little Bourbon was
also ready for cutting?a dark red cane, less in bulk, but yielding
a greater density. The holes in which the cane is planted are six
feet apart lengthways, the rows being four feet apart. Draining
of course, is very necessary on alluvial flats, as floods are sometimes
terribly destructive. The planting time lasts from September to
November, and in 14 months? time the crop is ready for cutting.
All this, and much more, I learned from my entertainer, who spared
no trouble in giving me every possible information.
Sunday passed during my stay, and it was made much of by the
?? boys.? A grand fantasia on the lali, or native drum, preceded
their religious performances, the hymns being given out in a style
that would gladden the heart of a Revivalist. All this time two
unfortunate patients lay in the hospital, unattended save by the
manager?in fact, the latter informed me that the ?boys? are seem-
ingly devoid of either gratitude or affection, save towards their imme-
diate relations. The service concluded about 2 p.m., having lasted
four hours, after which an adjournment was made to their habitation*,
where they ? stuffed? themselves with yams and taro till nightfall,
the Monday morning?s performance generally being a ? groggy?
one.
It was only a mile and a half to the adjoining plantation, Messrs.


Sahl and Garrick?s : these two names are conspicuous, by the way?
the former as being the largest land owner, and the latter as the
ablest barrister, in Fiji. The manager, Mr. Hilton, I found at home;
and, on explaining my errand, he put me in charge of his overseer,
Mr. Fairweather, an old planter, whose remarks on the past glories
of ? King Cotton? were not a little entertaining and instructive.
There was the same scrupulous care that I had before noticed in the
native quarters?a clean, whitewashed hospital, good enough for a
white man to lie in, besides a store to supply the requirements of
the coolies?of whom I shall have more to say anon. The cane on
this plantation, a 300-acre block, was of a most unmistakably
tropical growth, some of it being fully 22 feet in length. In
fact, a 20-foot road was reduced to a mere bush track by this
exuberant vitality ; and when Mr. Fairweather said he expected to
find a yield of 45 tons to the acre, I was not disposed to doubt his
statement. Owing to the bond entered into by most of the Eewa
planters with the Colonial Sugar Company to supply the company
with all their cane for the next ten years, some of the cane, although
beginning to ripen to seed, was yet uncut. Before this paper is in
print, however, the immense mill will be at work. Although it is
scarcely likely the company would have started but for this bond and
a guarantee given by the Government (which the latter attempted to
waive), it is thought that a practical mortgage of produce for so
long a period is not the best possible thing that could have
happened, as it tends to support a monopoly, and, of course, prevents
the acceptors from going into milling on the co-operative principle.
Bidding Mr. Hilton farewell, I wended my way, guided by a
native, to the furthest plantation. on the Rewa River, some two
miles further up, leased by Messrs. Hardy and Maclean. Resting
at their house over night, I was taken around by Mr. Maclean, a
pleasant young Scotchman, and saw the cane?like its neighbours
only awaiting cutting. The river takes a sharp bend here, and is
merged into the Wai Dina and the Wai Buka, a little further up.
There are 42 South Sea labourers on this plantation, mostly
youngish men and boys, the majority working very well, and, in
some respects, a marked contrast to the coolies. The partners con-
template introducing horse labour here, which, in the present very
unsatisfactory state of the human labour market will doubtless be
a most salutary innovation. One strong, well-built horse will plough
over as much ground as twenty men could ?hole? in a day. Of course,
horses do not make complaints, and can be corrected if they mis-


behave themselves?two very important facts, by the way. It may
seem extraordinary to record, but one of their ? boys,? on the last
visit of the Agent-General of Immigration, complained of ? having
his ear pulled ? by the overseer?and that functionary, having been
previously dealt with for a similar heinous offence, was warned that
a repetition thereof would lose him his position, as he would be
disqualified from longer acting in his capacity. On the day that I
arrived that much-enduring individual would have been struck
with a rake, wielded by one of the boys, had his assailant not been
prevented in time. The casus belli was that the ? boy? had refused
to obey orders, and upon his being again told to go on with his
work, endeavoured to retaliate. He had been in prison before, and
rather liked it than not, as there was an agreeable lack of hard
labour. Under the circumstances, it was hopeless to prosecute, and
the young scamp was sent to his quarters. He ran away the next
day most likely to lay another complaint. Mr, Maclean antici-
pated my thoughts, as the overseer told me all this : ?Itis a Crown
colony, said he: volumes could not have expressed more.
Next day I had a look at a nursery of coffee plants, over which
was erected a bamboo framework thickly covered by creepers, which
prevent the suns rays from injuring the tender shoots as they make
their first appearance above ground. They are planted at first in
beds, in rows six inches apart, and but one inch apart lengthwise.
The beds are generally 30 feet long by 3 feet broad. After eight or
nine months, those that do come up are transplanted, each being
afforded a space of 6 feet by 6 feet, and 1,210 of them going to an
acre, one ? bed? generally furnishing enough for an acre and a half.
It sometimes takes three years to bring coffee to maturity, provid-
ing the officials manifest no insane desire to ? doctor? it, although
berries are occasionally taken from a two-year-old plant. To judge
by my friends figures, coffee must be a good line. He expects
15cwt. to an acre when the trees have had five years? growth,
and so on ad infinitum. The price of berries per ton is stated as
from ï¿½IOO to ï¿½llO, so that between ï¿½7O and ï¿½BO is the yearly value
per acre of a bond fide plantation. The berries are affirmed to be
small, and of exquisite flavour. I heard much of the Hon. J. E.
Mason?s estate at Taviuni, where, I presume, the berries are roasted
and made into the marketable article. If the gentlemen from Ceylon
whom I met speak the truth, Fiji can give odds to Ceylon
in its capabilities for this industry. One ex-Ceylon man, a
manager, asked me to visit the scene of his labours, 15 miles up


the Wai Dina ; and but for the shallowness of the river rendering
passage uncertain, I should have had the pleasure of adding much
more to my present rather bare description.
Just before leaving I met Mr. Murray, the courteous and energetic
manager of the Colonial Sugar Company. Amongst other things he
informed me that there were between 1500 and 2000 acres of sugar
planted on the Rewa: taking the lower figure, and at 40 tons to the
acre, it gives a respectable total of 60,000 tons of cane ; and as it takes
15 tons of cane to make one of sugar, a result of 4000 tons of sugar is
given. Fijian sugar always obtains a high price?from ï¿½25 to ï¿½35 per
ton; assuming a medium figure, the gross value is ï¿½120,000. The price
paid for the cane is 10s. per ton, or for 60,000 tons ï¿½30,000; so that
there must result a considerable profit to the millowners, even
after allowing a large margin for expenses. Stay a moment : I
should have said that Mr. Murray expects his mechanical Tom
Tiddler?s ground to make 50 tons of sugar per day?a day of 20
hours for two relays of men. The company, I believe, are open
to buy up all the land they can get, anyway near their
mill.
Next morning I started on my return journey, going by canoe
from Mr. Storck?s to the Pioneer Mill. I spent one night there, and
reached Dreke Na Kelo?not far off* ?Thurston? and the ?big mill??
just in time to escape a fearful downpour of nearly a week?s duration.
Nupkins had been quiescent in my absence,and the dreaded summons
had not yet been served.
Leaving Dreke Na Kelo, a walk of a couple of miles along the
river?s bank, on what is facetiously termed a main trunk road,
brought me again to Thurston. The streets were there, as were
also the reserves for the school and the post-office, but the houses
are yet to come. The proprietor of the only residence in the place
being absent, I continued my journey much impressed with the
vanity of earthly things in general, and of projected townships in
particular. A little distance on, to the left, was the residence of
Frank Rondano, whose life amongst the savages in the bad old days
would doubtless be a considerable acquisition to juvenile literature.
A mile further, and in front of a small island, bridged over from the
mainland, was Mr. Ellis?s plantation, and another township contain-
ing one store. A few hundred yards still further on was the mag-
nificent mill of the Colonial Sugar Company, a description of which
I have given in a previous paper.
The mill of Messrs. Stanlake Lee and Co. is not far off. It is


much smaller in size, but in other respects it does not differ very
much from that of the Colonial Sugar Company. There is a very
large estate adjoining, ? bossed? by the mill-owners. It may be
stated, as a rough estimate, that there is ï¿½200,000 worth of machinery
in Fiji at the present time. The first locomotive ever seen in Fiji
was imported not long ago by the Taviuni mill-owners. Four years
ago the approximate value of mill power could not have exceeded
ï¿½50,000, if so much.
Retracing my steps as far as Mr. Ellis?s, I crossed over the river
to the Wai Manu Hotel, and, having satisfied the inner man, took
the path up by the Wai Manu River, being under the impression
that ten minutes? walk would bring me to my destination, Na Quere
Quere. Presently, however, I was glad to encounter a lot of Solomon
? boys,? who had come to the river for water, and a small bribe to
one of them procured me his services as a guide. Nearly an hour?s
trudging in the dark followed, and after crossing several structures
called bridges (save the mark !), formed by a single log or two, most
of them being without handrails, we at length struck the main road
of the plantation, at the end of which were several native houses
and that of the manager, Mr. Amos, by whom I was most courteously
received, and who pressed me to pass the night there. In the even-
ing I heard the history of Na Quere Quere for the past four or five
years ?a history that would probably be utterly disbelieved by
most people, who do not know, or, more properly speaking, have no
idea whatever, of the unlimited amount of mischief a Crown colony
Government can perpetrate with the utmost impunity. This plan-
tation consisted for the most part of coffee, and was attacked about
three years ago by the hermilia vastatrix. Many other plantations
were also severely infected; but as Mr. Parr was known as an
opponent of the Government, and as one, moreover, possessing some
influence at home, his estate was taken and an agreement was made
compulsorily with him, whereby his land was to be experimented upon
by the officials, the object in view being the discovery of an antidote
for the coffee-leaf disease. The record of these experiments, which
lasted a twelvemonth, was detailed to me by Mr. Amos, who was
retained as sub-manager during that time. Some of these were of the
most extraordinary character?sulphur and lime being the chief
materials employed, the quantities expended, together with the
amount of labour, being almost beyond belief. The plan-
tation was ruined in the end; and after some rather doubtful forms
of compensation had been resorted to, litigation ensued, and damages


against the Government were obtained by Mr. Parr. Amongst other
annoyances he was subjected to since the experiment began was his
being put on his trial for manslaughter by an Inspector of Police : ?a
charge so utterly unfounded that the magistrate dismissed the case.
It will not be wondered at, therefore, that Na Quere Quere has been
a constant source of loss instead of profit to its possessor, and that
unless a very different kind of administration rules Fiji, the loss
will be an increasing one.
Leaving Na Quere Quere on Sunday afternoon, escorted by a
foreign labour boy along the banks of the Wai Manu Eiver for some
distance, we crossed the stream, which at this part had become exceed-
ingly narrow, and arrived at Navutoka?the estate of Messrs. Kester
Shadier, and DyckofF. I had previously met Mr. Shadier en route
from Melbourne, and anyone who knows anything of the German
settler will not wonder that my reception was most kindly. After
resting over night I made an inspection of the plantation in the
morning, there being about 400 acres of sugar under cultivation, a
great portion of it being ripe for cutting. The house had not long
been built, from timber growing on the estate ; and the old home-
stead ?an old Fijian structure, looking very lonesome and desolate?
was situated a short distance off. The stables were close at hand, and
on the side of an opposite hill were the labour houses, from which
later in the day issued the sound of an old accordion, together with
much shouting and laughter. Mr. Kester was busy building another
storehouse, with the help of his foreign labour. He complained
that native labour, which at one time was so plentiful that a white
man never need trouble himself to build a house, had got so scarce,
owing to the enforced labour on Government plantations, that the
planter had to do almost everything for himself, as what few Poly-
nesians were obtainable were absolutely needed for carrying on
plantation operations. N avutoka is situated mainly upon hilly ground,
so that the floods do but very little damage when they do come.
The feature of this place is that the labourers take as much food as
they want, and, as a matter of course, complaints are unknown,
although an official visit was made amongst the men not long ago,
late at night, and without any one of the proprietors being present.
Messrs. Kester and Shadier are old colonists, and their narratives of
the early days of Fiji were most interesting, some of which I trust
to utilise on another occasion. The true German spirit was
in the house ?the Fatherland was tolerably conspicuous on every
hand. Mr. DyckofF had but recently arrived. It seemed rather odd


to hear him speak of his old university days, and then see him going
?out into the fields to superintend a gang of Solomon boys weeding
cane. However, he likes the country very well, and looks forward
to a prosperous time eventually.
After a three-days? stay at Navutoka, I bade good-bye to my
hosts, and pushed forward to Mr. Eastgate?s plantation, accompanied
by a guide. After passing an adjoining plantation and crossing
the river, our road lay across a tract of muddy country and I was
not sorry to rest awhile in a native town en route. Some yangona
was made for me in the chiefs house by a rather prepossessing
Fijian belle, which strengthened me for the rest of my journey. I
was unfortunate enough to find Mr. Eastgate absent on arriving at
his rather extensive plantation on the banks of the Rewa, so, cross-
ing the river and calling at the post-office for mails, I proceeded
down the opposite bank. Passing through a small plantation and
store, belonging to Mr. Chapman, I arrived soon after at the adjoin-
ing estate and sugar-mill of Mr. Waterson, whom I found busily
engaged in weighing out yams to his men for their evening meal.
The mill close by was hard at work; its capacity is about equal to
that of the Pioneer mill. A look round and an invitation to Mr.
Waterson?s house followed. The view was simply magnificent. The
?house is perched on a hill some hundred feet high, and as the sun
shone out gaily on the morning following my arrival, everything
looked to the best advantage. My host was a very old colonist, who
had passed through all the phases of the cotton failure, and had
been one of the few who had escaped destruction thereby. Many
stories he had to tell concerning the wonderful doings of the Crown
colony Government in its early days, which I reserve for another
occasion. Leaving there, I looked in at the adjoining plantation,
where I saw Mr. Scholes, the manager, in a little house on the
summit of a very steep hill, the back door looking down on an
alarmingly precipitous descent of about 70 feet. All the plantation,
or the greater part of it, is on the hills, the yield from which is not
much less than from those on the alluvial flats.
I heard a good deal here concerning the coolies employed on an
extensive estate, on the other side of the river, belonging to the
Colonial Sugar Company, which served simply to confirm what I
had already heard of them. The Fijians and the Hindoos are not
apparently on the best of terms, the former calling the latter ? rats,
and the latter retaliating by hurling the crushing epithet of ?junglee,?
or wild man of the forest, at all Polynesians, more especially the


South Sea ? boys ? and those from the favoured isles of Mallicolo,
whose aborigines more nearly approach the ape proper than any
other variety in the , Pacific Seas. As illustrating the dif-
ference between their creeds, it is related that a Fijian, with
the love of gold in his heart and a live snake in his hand, went
round to persuade some of his Indian friends to purchase the reptile
for a sum of three shillings. The unsophisticated vendor was not
aware that the snake is an object of worship to a Hindoo, and he
was extremely surprised on being bundled, neck and crop, out of
the plantation minus his snake, which he regarded as a particularly
choice morsel, only to be eaten by taragas or chiefs. After a night
with Mr. Scholes I bade him farewell, and took my way to Durnu-
lulu, and soon on to Dreke Na Kelo. A day or two after, in company
with a planter and a friend, escorted by a couple of luggage car-
riers, we shaped our course for Bau, the native capital of Fiji, the
town from which King Cacobau derives his name. Up hill and
down dale for three miles brought us on to the main trunk road, as
it has been termed by the imaginative artist who laid out Thurs-
ton. Just beyond the junction was the village of Na Gale Dam,
where some yangona was prepared for us in the chief?s house.
There was nothing particular to look at in the place, and we pushed
on across a level plain covered with natives? gardens, where taro and
yams and the yangona plant were flourishing to a considerable
extent. The bridges here were a trifle worse than those on the
Rewa, which is perhaps saying a great deal for them. More up hill
and down hill work followed, till we reached a tremendous hill over-
looking the town of Namata, on the Namata River. We scrambled
down, and found a very fine canoe in readiness to take us off to Bau.
About a couple of hours? ? poling ? and paddling along a most pic-
turesque stream, where there were full many indications of sharks,
and the small island of Bau was in sight, about half a mile from
the mainland, while away in the distance was Ovalau, on the other
side of which Levuka is situated. Right away ahead were one or two
small islets, one of which was presented to his late Excellency by
the chiefs as a token of regard and esteem. It grows nothing but
a few cocoanuts, and is almost sterile, so that the gratitude ex-
pressed was of the true Fijian stamp.
Bau is but a rock with a little low land lying around the base;
it can be circumnavigated in half-an-hour by a smart rower. On
the summit of the rock, with its galvanized-iron roof shining brightly
Yol. VI.?No. 35. 2 K


in the sun, was the Wesleyan Mission House, the only European
residence in Bau, and certainly the best in every way. Lying at
anchor was a small yacht belonging to Cacobau, christened the Lur-
line, and numerous native canoes were lying close alongside, a lot
more being high and dry on the beach. We landed at length, and
were soon in the open square at the foot of the Mission Hill, the
most prominent object being a stone church, with galvanized-iron
roof, that would possibly seat a thousand Europeans. It had a
creditable, respectable look about it; that and the Mission House,
and a small store at the further extremity of the island, belonging to
Messrs. Cane and Co;, of Suva and Levuka, were the only evidences
of the presence of white men in Bau. After doing justice to a
hearty meal, the chief ingredients of which we had been thoughtful
enough to bring with us, we strolled out to see the ? lions,? if any
were to be seen. Just beyond the church we came across a lot of
squatting Fijians, evidently preparing themselves for a heavy gorge,
as three roasted turtles (ye gods ! what a sight for an alderman of
the good city of London !) and a bullock cooked in its skin seemed
to testify.
Bau is divided into four districts ?So So, Bau, Lasakow, and
Matewelagi?each of which has its chief, besides a great number of
petty chiefs, and a very small number of kaisis. The lot put
together could not number more than five hundred, all told. A roko
O
and native magistrate keep them in order on behalf of the Govern-
ment, a task which cannot have taxed their energies very much, as
all the population seem intent on helping one another to do nothing.
The only part of a Fijian that can be said to really work is his
tongue, and he is apparently never so happy as when talking and
smoking or eating. The true begging instinct of the lazzavoni of
Naples is strongly developed in the Fijian. We were assailed from
the time we went out till we returned again by coloured gentlemen
who wanted ? tabac ???always tabac. We cheerfully referred them
to the store, or compromised our consciences by saying that we
didn?t smoke?generally speaking about three minutes? talking was
considered an equivalent for a leaf or two of tobacco. We were
glad at last to escape to the house of a chief who had a few days
previously borrowed tobacco and money, besides a coat and a
lantern; so we were so far safe. Once in the house?a rather larger
one than its neighbours, standing by the waterside?we were regaled
with yangona and talk ad libitum. After furnishing our pipes and
making sure the coat and lantern had not been lent to anyone else,


we went back to our quarters, a house almost adjoining the church.
Here the planter was evidently very well known as, although there
were many kaisis present, nobody asked him for tobacco. We
brought a pound in leaves, and gave a few away just to keep peace
while our evening meal was being despatched. Later on in the evening
we were visited by the fourth son of King Cacobau, Rabu Esau,
a smart-looking, tall, well-made fellow. Instead of asking for
tobacco he actually offered me some, or rather the loan of his pipe,
a luxury which I declined with many thanks. Next morning, how-
ever, I saw him at his house and made a sketch of him, which
rendered him more sociable than ever. The night was redolent of
hymns and lotu. Praying and psalm-singing begin the day and
end it. The singing is fair, and false notes occur every now and
then ; but on the whole the natives would make fair Revivalists if
they had ? plenty tabac ? and nothing else to do. In the morning
we saw a few of the men and all of the women leaving Bau for the
shore to fetch fresh water, taro, and yams, doing a little fishing en
route. The lords of the creation stayed behind and smoked and
talked and begged. Most of them wore but a single cloth round
oo o
the waist, some of the women, however, indulging in an extra
upper garment.
Bau is the centre of Fijian aristocracy. It is also the home of
the ex-king, and it was on this spot that the first Fijian Parlia-
ment assembled Just in front of the church are a number of
massive logs which had been used in the construction of the ? great
house,? and it was here that the King was crowned in 1867, with
a crown made from an old kerosene tin and studded with Brum-
magem jewellery. Even the rough and ready pioneer settlers con-
trived to inculcate an idea of constitutional rule on the reformed
cannibal, and at least the white men governed themselves and left
the blacks to do the same. Annexation, however, brought in King
Stork with a vengeance. While the native race has been greatly
reduced in numbers, the white population has not increased to any
extent during the past ten years ?indeed, it is affirmed that a
decrease is nearer the truth. The ?sa tha matanitu,? or bad
Government, was repeatedly spoken of, not only by the kaisis but
by the chiefs themselves, one of them actually holding office under
Government. Engaging with white men is secretly forbidden, and
what work is done is for the ?matanitu,? which gives almost nothing
in return. Then the lotv , or missions, has to be supported mainly
2 K 2


by the natives themselves, with what few shillings they can beg,
borrow, or steal, and the net result is that, although wars and
fighting are over for ever, and the country is nominally Christianised,
the people are miserably poor, dreadfully lazy, and incorrigible liars.
It is impossible for any white man to visit Bau without being
struck with the hopelessly apathetic attitude of the native race.
To use the words of both planters and chiefs alike, the natives are
greater slaves than they have ever been.
We soon exhausted the lions of Bau. In an open space still
stands the stone on which, in by-gone times, the childrens heads
were dashed before the body was consigned to the oven. There
are also the sites of three or four large buildings?raised mounds,
walled in?the king?s house, a mean little cottage of thatch ;
and the residence of the king?s daughter Atiquila. We
found her Highness at home, engaged in the rather unlady-like
occupation of smoking a clay pipe. Her maids of honour were
making themselves generally useful, one in particular being con-
spicuous, as she was diligently working at a sewing-machine?
perhaps the only one in Bau. They were evidently of Tongan
descent, as their skin was many shades lighter than that of the
ordinary kaisi and in some few instances they had a presentable
appearance.
We met Ratu Timothy, a brother of Ratu Esau, and were intro-
duced by the latter gentleman. Timothy is the second son of the
King, and, like many others of the big chiefs, he has in some way,
got foul of the ?matanitu.? He was good enough to look at divers
sketches I had made in the town, the one of his brother evidently
taking his fancy the most. He was a fine-looking man ?about the
best specimen of coloured humanity to be seen in those parts. Of
course, we had any amount of yangona offered us at the houses of
the chiefs; the meke was only just over, and a large supply had been
laid in from the surrounding district. All the banquets are got ?on
the cheap,? so to speak, the power of the chiefs over the kaisis
possessions having been strengthened by the Government, notwith-
standing all that has been asserted to the contrary.
The journey from Bau to Levuka was a tolerably quiet one, and,
once at the present capital, it was not long before a passage was
procured to Taviuni, the third island in size and importance in the
group. The Blue Bell was a smart little cutter of 30 tons, and a
24 hours? passage?calling, by the way, at Mokogi, the property of
Messrs. Hennings?brought us to Yuna Point, the landing-place at


Taviuni, where I was soon deposited at the Masonic Hotel. Close
at hand is the site of the mill now being built for Messrs. Billyard
and Company. The hotel and mill are fronted by a triangular piece
of flat land, two sides of which are bounded by the sea, and on
which are situated a couple of stores and a boat-building establish-
ment.
From Yuna Point the little island of Rabi and the large island
of Vanua Levu are seen, the former about 25 miles away, and the
latter not half that distance, being separated only by a channel,
across which small boats were incessantly plying. On the hills
forming the background of the mill?in fact right over the island,
which is some 26 miles long, by 8 in breadth?are the settlers? plan-
tations, one of the largest being held by Messrs. Billyard, and the
other by the Hon. Jas. Mason. The latter is the most extensive
coflee plantation on the group, and on it the playfulness of the
imported coolie has been experienced to a remarkable degree, the
extraordinary number of 69 charges having been preferred by the
Hindoos against an African overseer some three months ago, result-
ing in the removal of the obnoxious official. As my visit was a
flying one, I did not go to this plantation, but it has deservedly
gained the highest reputation amongst coffee men in Fiji, some of
its products having been exhibited at the Melbourne Exhibition with
considerable success.
A mountain track of ten miles brought myself and guides one
morning to Somo Somo, the residence of the native chief, Ratu Lala,
who holds office as native magistrate under the Government. I
found him in his house, a large. Fijian structure, furnished through-
out in good European style, and experienced that the reports of his
hospitality and general courtesy are not a whit exaggerated. He
is a son of the famous warrior Cacodrove, a potentate who formerly
ruled the windward group before Maafu came in and partially dis-
possessed him. Ratu Lala is probably the most intelligent Fijian in
the group; his father, notwithstanding his bloodthirsty qualities,
always manifested a great respect for the whites ?a sentiment which?
was further developed in his son through his residence in Sydney,
where he attended the university for a sufficient time to acquire a
fair education. He was most polite in his conversation, expressing
himself in fairly good English, but was, of course, much too great a
man to express himself unreservedly on any important subject to a
stranger. The native town of Somo Somo contained nothing par-
ticularly worthy of mention, but was in every respect a very marked


improvement on Ban, both in regard to the houï¿½es and their
occupants. In fact, Eatu Lala can give points to any or all of the
aristocracy at Bau. There is a gaol some three miles distant, kept
by a veteran officer, an old Irishman, who is quite an original
character in his way. It is satisfactory to add that he has very
rarely a European under his keeping.
After a day?s stay at Somo Somo, and after calling at the house
of a neighbouring settler, who also keeps the only store there, I had
a look in at the gaol, and found the old gaoler?or, to give him his
full name, Sergeant-Major Patrick Molloy?having a quiet game of
cards in the bosom of the family. The old veteran has passed some
forty years and more in the army, and his various experiences?
? fighting his battles o?er again??were pleasant and enjoyable to
listen to in such an outlandish spot. Next morning he had a grand
muster of prisoners, some eighteen in all, a dozen of whom were
cai kolos, or rebels, in old times, undergoing lengthened sentences
of imprisonment for fighting against the British Crown. It seems
rather odd, though, that these men should be so severely punished
now, as at the time they only obeyed their natural instincts in
fighting the whites as they had previously done the armies of old
Cacobau. It must be remembered, too, that they took no part in
the act of cession, and the Fijian chiefs who signed that document
gave away what never belonged to them, and what they had totally
failed to conquer for themselves. However, the cai kolos are
now enabled to form an opinion on the difference between semi-
savages and Christian philanthropists. To this day, however, it is
impossible to get all the mountaineers to work for nothing for the
Government, and a few more imprisonments will yet have to be
made ere these hardy tribes will fully appreciate the blessings of
civilisation. An attack of illness prevented me from continuing
my travels inland, and I had to take boat and proceed back to Vuna
Point along the coast. The scenery at that part was wonderfully
picturesque, as the tall cliffs rise to a considerable height from the
ocean.
The island of Taviuni is called the Garden of Fiji, and is one of
the most fertile in the group. In shape it resembles an oval, with a
chain of hills running lengthways, the highest point rising to 3000
feet. Most of the Fiji islands are similar in conformation, but the
hills are flanked on either side by sharp spurs running into the sea
and forming deep valleys between them. The aspect of Taviuni is
somewhat different?the result of volcanic action, the evidence of


one volcano still existinghn]the shape of a hot spring at the top of
a high mountain. Taviuni saw all the glories of King Cotton in
years gone by, but coffee]and copra take the lead at present.
The good folks at Yuna Point had a lot to say respecting Ratu
Lala?s father (Cacodrove, or Fui Cakau), who appears to have sold
as much of his land as he possibly could to his white neighbours,
feeling certain that annexation would rob him of everything, as it
did many others of the big chiefs. Although rather too fond of his
square bottle of gin, he was a remarkable exception to the Bau
chieftains, as he gave evidence in favour of the genuineness of the
land sales when the commission went round inquiring into the
matter. Had he been dead, or open to the intimidation which was
freely brought to bear on the rest of the native potentates by the
?matanitu,? that estimable institution wouldhavemade a grand coup
with the plantations. It sounds rather strange that white men
should be grateful to a Fijian for help afforded them against an
administration of their own race and colour ; but such an anomaly is
not by any means singular in Fiji.
Just after I reached Yuna Point, I had tidings of a grand emeute
of the coolies at the Hon. Jas, Mason?s estate, who affirmed that
they were greatly overworked. An inquiry was held, and resulted
in a number of fines, amounting in all to ï¿½l7, being imposed on the
proprietor. Had he not been a member of the Council, there can be
no doubt the amount]would have been well nigh trebled. Since the
above occurred, and~while this is being written, tidings come of
another strike on the grounds of overtasking, which will more than
likely have a similar termination.
And so, for the present, ends this ? rambling ? story. If I
have succeeded in interesting my readers in this the youngest and
most misgoverned ]of British colonies and its productions, if I
have given them some idea of its present social and political con-
dition, and of the rapid development of which the country is capable
under more favourable auspices, I shall be more than satisfied.
