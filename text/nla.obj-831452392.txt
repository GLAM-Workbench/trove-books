CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA
SURVEY OF AUSTRALIAN EX-SERVICE PERSONNEL - NOVEMBER 1 966
To be treated as strictly CONFIDENTIAL and NOT to be published, broadcast
or cabled before 6 P.M. on FRIDAY 1 DECEMBER 1967
This survey was conducted in November 1 966 in order to obtain estimates of
the number and characteristics of Australian ex-service personnel who had served in the
Australian armed forces during wartime, and of the number and characteristics of their
dependants.
2. The survey was carried out at the request of the Repatriation Department
and the Services Canteens Trust Fund, and was designed to identify three classes of
person, namely:
(a) those who had served in the Australian armed forces during wartime (see
definitions, paragraph 5) .
(b) the widows of men who had served during the 1939-45 War (see definitions),
(c) children, under 19 years of age, of ex-service personnel who had served
during the 1939-45 War (see definitions).
3. The survey was based on a multi-stage area sample of private dwellings
(houses, flats, etc.) and non-private dwellings (hotels, hospitals, etc,). It covered
the whole of Australia, and questions were asked of persons aged 18 years and over at
November 1966, with the exception of members of the permanent armed forces and national
servicemen enlisted in the Regular Army Supplement, and certain diplomatic personnel,
customarily excluded from census and estimated populations. Ex-service personnel were
first identified and then information was obtained about their children. As a result of
this procedure children with both parents deceased or living outside Australia at the
time of the survey, and children whose only surviving parent was serving in the
permanent armed forces, were excluded.
4. Persons who were patients in hospitals or sanitoria other than Repatriation
Hospitals, or who were inmates of gaols, etc., and for whom, for the purpose of the
survey, the institution was regarded as their dwelling, were not the questions on
ex-service status. The estimates ascribe to such persons characteristics (e.g. ex-
service status) according to the proportions found in the sample. Patients in
Repatriation Hospitals, however, were asked the relevant questions.
5. Definitions. For the purposes of the survey the following definitions
were used.
(1) Service in the Australian Armed Forces in Wartime (defined in (ii) below) -
service in any of the following:
(a) the permanent naval, military or air forces of the Commorwealth of
Australia;
(b) the citizen forces, by persons who enlisted for service in the 1939-45
War (including service in the R.A.N.V.R., C.M.F., etc.);
(c) the Voluntary Aid Detachment in a full-time paid capacity;
(d) the nursing or other women's services which were auxiliary to the
naval, military or air forces (i.e. Royal Australian Naval Nursing
Service; Australian Army Nursing Service; Royal Australian Air
4155
Ref. no. 15.1.


Force Fursing Service; Women’s Royal Australian Naval Service;
Australian Women’s Army Service; Australian Army Medical Women’s
Service; Women’s Auxiliaiy Australian Air Force; Australian Army
Medical Corps; Army Medical Corps Nursing Service - 1914-18 War).
(ii) Service in Wartime - service in the Australian armed forces (see (i) above)
in any of the following;
(a) the South African (Boer) War, which commenced on 11 October 1899»
(b) the 1914-18 War between 5 August 1914 and 11 November 191 8 inclusive;
(c) the 1939-45 War between 3 September 1939 and 30 June 1947 inclusive
(including service in the occupation forces in Japan);
(d) the Korean operations -in an operational area between 27 June 1950
and 19 April 195 6 inclusive;
(e) the Malayan operations - between 29 June 1950 and 30 August 1957
inclusive;
(f) the Far East Strategic Reserve - persons, except members of the naval
forces in the complement of a sea-going vessel, allotted special
duty in the Federation of Malaya and the Colony of Singapore between
1 September 1957 and 27 May 1 inclusive;
(g) the Special Overseas Zone - service personnel who were allotted
special duty in Vietnam (Southern Zone) from 1 July 19&2; Sarawak,
Sabah and Brunei from 8 December 19&2; Malaya (North) from 28 May
1963; Malayan Peninsula and Singapore from 7 July 19&5*
(iii) Service Outside Australian Territorial Waters - service in the Australian
armed forces during wartime:
(a) outside the territorial waters of the Commonwealth of Australia or the
Dominion of enlistment.
a.) in the Territories of Papua or New Guinea.
Note. Service in the Northern Territory north of 14*5° South Latitude (approximately
north of Katherine) for three months or more between Februaiy 1942 and November 1943
was defined as service in a ’’theatre of war”. Therefore persons who served in that
area during that period are included in the tables which follow as if they had served
outside Australian territorial waters.
6. Since the survey estimates are based on a sample they are subject to
sampling variability, that is, variations that might occur by chance because only a
sample of the population was enumerated. Estimates of less than 5 >OOO are not published
in the tables because they would be subject to sampling variability too high for most
practical purposes. Although figures for these small components can in some cases be
derived from the tables by deduction, undue significance should not be attached to
them. Further information on variability of survey estimates is available on request.
7. Any discrepancies between totals and sums of components in tables are due
to rounding.
