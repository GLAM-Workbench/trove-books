ANOTHER VICTORY OVER HYDATIDS.
Forsyth Street, Sand Hill, Wagga Wagga, 13th March, 1900.
I feel it my duty to testify to the wonderful cure of Hydatids that has been effected in my own case by the
use of WEBBER’S VITADATIO. I have suffered for the PAST SIX (6) YEARS from HYDATIDS OR
THE LUNG, and during that time I HAD SEVERAL SEVERE HEMORRHAGES, my life at times was des-
paired of, and twice the Sacrament was administered to me by our minister (Rev. G. A. Carver). Life m use f
was simply a burden. I was attended to by doctors in Wagga and Sydney, wim were ' rery ;kind,
in their power to alleviate my suffering. AFTER USING THE VITADAIIO THE HYDATID AND CYSTS
WERE EXPELLED FROM MY BODY, and I am thankful to say I have been restored to HEALTH and
STRENGTH SOLELY BY THE USE OF WEBBER’S VITADATIO. I am willing that you should use this
in any way you choose, hoping it may be the means of leading other poor sufferers to try Webber s
renowned Vitedatio. Yours respectfully
Witness-W. J. FIST. ( H. A. RUDD.
The facts of Mrs. Rudd’s illness are to my knowledge, exactly as she states, although I know nothing of the
nature of the disease or its symptoms, but she certainly is now well and strong. (Signed)

Dear Sir,-
Dr. WAUGH’S BAKING POWDER Beats
the Rest.
A retired schoolmaster excuses his
passion for angling by saying that, from
constant habit, he never feels quite him-
self unless he is handling the rod.
In England the average weight of men
is 155 lb.
Striking an average, English women
wear shoes two sizes larger than American
women.
WORDS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
Shakespeare, who had the richest
vocabulary used by any Englishman,
employed only 16,000 words. Milton
could pick out from 8,000, but the aver-
age man, a graduate from one of the
great universities, rarely has a vocabulary
of more than 3000 or 4000 words. The
ordinary person can get along comfortably
with 600 words, and in the rural districts
a knowledge of 200 words is sufficient to
carry a man through his life. This of
course refers to the needs of conversation.
If a man wants to read newspapers and
well-written books, he must know at
least 2000 words.
SOME ANCIENT BATTLES.

drubal, were defeated by the Romans,
under Consuls Caius Claudius Nero and
Marcus Livius.
The Battle of Philippi, b.c. 42, in which
Brutus and Cassius were defeated by
Octavius and Antony. The fate of the
Republic was decided.
The Battle of Actium, B.C. 31, in which
the combined fleets of Anthony and
Cleopatra were defeated by Octavius,
and Imperialism established in the per-
son of Octavius.
The Battle of Chalons, a.d. 451, in
which the Huns, under Attila, called the
“ Scourge of God,” were defeated by the
confederate armies of Romans and
Visigoths.
The Battle of Tours, a.d. 732, in
which the Saracens were defeated by
Martel. Christendom was rescued from

“ How long, my young friend,” inquired
the venerable judge, “ have you been try-
ing to make a living by practising law in
this town F ”
“ Six years,” said the young barrister.
“ How unfortunate.”
“ I don’t know, your honour. I have
managed to pick up a pretty good living.”
“I was thinking of the community,”
mused the judge, shaking his head.

Doctor: “No we can never do that.
You see, there is no more money to be

There is a story, which it has been im-
possible to confirm, hailing from the siege
of Kimberley, of a woman who was com-
pelled, with great reluctance, to eat her
favorite pet dog. When she had finished
she swept the bones to the side of her
plate with a pathetic gesture, and mur-
mured :
“How poor Fido would have enjoyed
them
He—“ Just think of it. They say
man descended from a monkey.” She—■
“ A come down, indeed.”

Changed His Mind.
A young man about twenty-three years of age
dressed like a farmer, had his feet on the car
■eat in front of him and was reading a novel,
when one of the boys went over to him and ob-
served :
“ I’ve just made a bet of five dollars on you.’*
“Onme ? What is it ?”
“ I’ve bet five dollars that you will suicide
within a week. I’ve been watching you very
closely for the last half hour, and all signs in-
dicate melancholy and despondtfticy. Have you
selected any particular line of killing yourself—
poison, the rope, drowning or hanging ? ”
“ Did you actually bet five dollars ? ” an
xiously asked the young man.
“I did.”
“ Pay if you lose ? ”
“ I’ll have to.”
“ That’s too bad. 1 wish I could have seen
you last week.”
“ Why last week ? ”
“ Because I then had the ager every day right
along—two cows were sick on my hands—my
had gone back on me, and I expected a
windmill man was going to beat mo out of four
hundred dollars. I did kinder think of suicide.”
“ But now ? ”

He'd Stop Over.
A new story was afloat on Prince Russell
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
night, and is credited to W. W. Dudley.
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe. On the way over he told his
fellow passengers that he should'* not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing Ills
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England ? ”
“Well,” said the Prince, “It’s this way;
If the Prince of Wales should go to
America and pass through Washington
without stopping to call on father, we’d
think it darned queer, an’ so I thought
I’d stop over here a few days and pay my
respects to the Queen.”—“New York Star.’
Story of a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wifa
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment, she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “ high
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball. Sitting in her box, resplendent
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reportprial description the following day
in the chief paper of the city,—“ New
York Press.”
The British South Africa Company has

pleted 1400 miles of telegraph line, about
1000 miles of road, and 3000 miles of
railway.
