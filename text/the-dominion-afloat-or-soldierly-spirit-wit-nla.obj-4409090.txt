NEW ZEALAND, NEW ZEALAND.
Let every loyal British heart with hopeful fervour glow,
And ponder over heroes now and those of long ago.
kitchener showed how Britons can, and will, their duty do,
And nobly fight for England's right, and die for England, too.
He saw not dangers then ahead, or cared not if there were ;
When Britain's honour was at stake all perils he would dare ;
He paused not till it was "too late," but boldly led the way,
And that's the sort of man New Zealand's sending 'way to-day,
Our soldiers, and our sailors too, have fought with might and main
To hold the rights our fathers' won, our losses to regain.
We've put our shoulders to the wheel, we've got both nerve and will,
To show the common foe abroad that Britain's Britain still.
We bravely threw the gauntlet down, we'll show this Germany
That those who freed the mighty world must needs themselves be free.
We'll prove that we on land and sea can still assert our sway.
And that's the sort of men New Zealand's sending 'way to-day.


EDITORIAL.
THE perpetrators of the present produc-
tion do humbly apologise to its readers for
any pain it may cause. The editor, being
of decided nocturnal habits, was unable to
produce any good "copy," and it is there-
fore quite unnecessary to state that the
only matter worth reading in these
columns is not from his pen. It may also
he mentioned (in parentheses) that the
said editor was unable to sign for his last
pay. This worthy epistle, on which your
eyes now rest, dear reader, was written
by a bugler, who is generally known from
one end of the ship to the other as having
a great capacity for blowing. However,
the paper is here, and it claims to be no
more than it was meant to be —a compact
little souvenir of a memorable and plea-
sant voyage. Other reinforcements have
had their "unofficial organs," and those of
the sixteenth on board Transport 61 are
not behind in this respect.
The voyage so far has been a pleasant
one, and there are very few of the men
who are not ready to do their share in the
paving of the way for the triumphal entry
into Berlin. No doubt, all miss the good
old Trentham stew, but what a consola-
tion the prospect of tinned bully beef and
biscuits affords us.
Then, let us all do our bit. Let us do
everything and everybody we can. As the
patriotic crimson tide rushes through the
editor's veins words fail him. It is not the
first time words have failed him. In fact
he is a bit of a failure himself, So, if
there are any flaws noticeable in the pre
sent production, please blame the edito'',
in the absence of an office boy. To all
generous contributors he (the editor, not
the office boy) extends his heartfelt
thanks, and to everybody on board
GOD SPEED AND GOOD LUCK.
A little reason is worth a lot of non-
sense.
Two pints make one wash.
A soldier after sea sickness is of no more
use than a dummy cartridge.
Don't spend all your money on drink at
the next port of call. That's foolish. Let
some other fellow shout.
Work and war make men.
AS WE LIVE.
SKETCH OF LIFE ON BOARD.
"Ships that pass in the night, and speak
each other in passing,
Only a signal shown, and a distant voice
in the darkness;
So on the ocean of life, we pass and speak
one another,
Only a look and a voice, then darkness
again and silence."
—Longfellow.
"March right up the gangway." And
with a heart-thump of disappointment that
realised that no leave was to be their por-
tion on this their last night in Wellington,
that portion of the Sixteenth Reinforce-
ment bound towards Europe's future by
Transport 61, ascended to the decks of
their nine weeks' prison, to gain, if not
their much-desired and half-promised leave,
at least a vantage point from which to
take farewell of mothers, sisters, brothers,
and —others perhaps as dear.
"Write a long letter." "Don't eat all
that cake at once." "Remember me to
the boys." "Give my love to Tom if you
see him over there." A waving of hand-
kerchiefs, a quivering cheer; fond features
became blurred—was it the increasing dis-
tance?—the ship with its freight pulled out
into the stream to drop anchor and wait
for the hour of departure.
Sunday, Aug. 20. —The anchor weighed,
the vessel steamed slowly down the har-
bour; when outside, her nose turned to-
ward the Strait, South Karori, the Three
Brothers, Cape Farewell —to which of us
shall it some day be Cape Returnagain?—
out into the ever-restless Tasman. And
restless it was, with a heavy sea of white-
crested waves, a head wind whistling
through the rigging, checking the pace,
causing many hearts to sink, and other
parts of the anatomy to rise. Sickness
and strangeness to new quarters caused a
delay in the settling-down of life and rou-
tine. A week out, and everything was
running as smoothly as the engines of the
boat itself.
Four bells—Reveille! A patter of feet
on deck; some folk can never be satisfied
with waiting for the bugle before getting
up. A sound as of rain, in reality the
commencement of swabbing decks; a love
of bed, reluctant rising; then begins, with
towel and soap, a procession up the com-
panion way; a scant glance at the horizon,
being now old sailors, the water-tap to
draw a pannikin of.fresh water (although
most pannikins have grown to the size of
six-pound jam-tins), a partial ablution, or
an apology for one why will sea-
water not lather?—return, to a stuffy dor-
mitory, now realised having breathed the
pure air on deck, a spruce-up. "Come to
the cookhouse door, boys." The call
rouses a few laggards still hugging their
beds; fall-in outside the mess-room door,
the line leading back in a hungry column
along the port side, awaiting the relief that
"Pickemup" affords to impatient interiors.
Coffee, porridge, and stew—has one yet
heard of the soldier with whom stew has
not been a byword?
After breakfast, shaving, an accom-
plished gymnastic feat in peril of life as
the ship rolls over at an extra angle, ad
feet slip, and the razor takes on dangerous
gyrations of its own. Tidying-up of bunks
and dormitories ends labour below, one
being glad to seek a sunny spot above to
read or play cards until the Company-
Sergt.-Major—hang him--blows the whistle
for fall-in, an act always arousing various
sentiments and expressions far removed
from those called forth by "cookhouse."
Still, it has to be done, and everyone
knows in his inner mind that were it not
for tile drill all would be in no fit condi-
tion to undergo the training, which one
hears awaits one and all at the destina-
tion. So very soon the running decks, for-
ward and aft, and, indeed, every available
space, provide a scene of great animation.
Every kind of physical drill, calculated to
develop and strengthen the muscles and
the body generally, is performed with com-
mendable vigour; and the men find out
that this drill has its effects. Perhaps a
slight stiffness results for a day or two,
but then, how much better they feel, and
where is the feeling of lassitude that pos-
sessed them before physical drill was in-
dulged in? Then we hear sounds that
bring Trentham and Featherston to mind
It is a squad drilling with rifles, to keep
them in touch and in the closest possible
intimacy with tlieir best friends of the
future. Silhouetted against the sky, or in
any suitable place, one can see the signal-
lers at work; theirs is a department which
must be kept "up to scratch." Go into the
Sergeants' Mess—everybody goes there-
and you hear the humming of their key 3
used in telegraphic work.
After drill, the men's energies often seem
to redouble, judging by the wrestling and
rolling about that is "done. Some read,
others play cards, and a few write; but all
are ready for their dinner, which is a really
good meal, at which none should grumble.
What is wrong with soup, roast mutton or
beef with vegetables, pudding ("plum-duff''
twice a week), tea or lime juice. Anyway,
a fair number seem glad to rest on deck
after dining.
All is peaceful. "The air a solemn still-
ness holds." The decks are covered with
the forms of men reclining after the mid-
day meal. There still seems to exist, how-
ever, food for thought, and all are con-
tented, little expecting the shock about to
arrive. Suddenly it comes—C.B.! and the
bugler blows that well and loudly, if he
does not treat the other calls as well.
Then we see the luckless ones make their
way to headquarters, sped on by the well-
wishes of their friends. This call goes im-
mediately after reveille, or so it seems to
those who do not pay particular heed to
the call to rise. Also the revelry at night
in the messroom is spoiled for the evildoers
at 7 o'clock by the bugler, who takes a
delight in sounding this blast, if the grin
of evil satisfaction on his face is indica-
tive of his feelings.
The men are left to themselves till quar-
ter-past one, when the voice of the orderly-
sergeant looms out, "Fall in for gargle."
Then comes a rude disturbance of the gen-
eral peace. Platoon sergeants and sergts.-
major ruthlessly rush about amongst the
men, exhorting them to gargle the liquid


brought from the dispensary. Vain arc
the platitudes and excuses advanced; vain
are the looks of injured innocence when
protestations of having gargled are un-
mercifully disregarded. After a while
peace reigns again until two o'clock. Some-
times a cry is raised, "See the whale."
"Look at the porpoise." Such a shout is
always the cause of a run to the rails, al-
though these creatures are fairly common
now; yet one cannot tire of watching the
graceful dives and motions of the latter.
The afternoon's work is, on the whole,
the same as that of the morning. It is
gratifjnng to see the amount of interest
displayed in the drill. But then, were not
the Sixteenths always famed for their ap-
plication to their work? Everybody seems
fit, if the ruddy cheeks and swelling chests
and brawny muscles are anything to go by.
Besides, all know tlmt this is a serious
business, and that there is only one way
to reach Berlin.
Tea is early—at 4.30. Appetites are,
however, well whetted for the fare pro-
vided. Again an excellent meal is set be-
fore the men—cold meat, stew, tea, bread,
sometimes scones. After tea, most indulge
in a wash before going to see the boxing
and wrestling aft, or to the messroom to
sing, read, write, or play cards or draughts.
The canteen must not be forgotten. Round
about this hallowed place the air is full of
the sound of popping corks, a spilling of
froth and invaluable hop beer, the rustling
of paper bags, the cracking of toffee.
Going into the hall at night, one sees
"Our Father" going bis rounds, seeing to
the comforts of his flock. He treats all
alike, and his cheery smile rarely leaves
his face, as he pursues his apparent occu-
pation —making people at home and happy.
Everyone has a kind thought for this hard-
working and cheerful representative of
the Y.M.C.A., which does so much for the
welfare of soldiers of the Empire.
The messroom is always a lively scene at
night. All seem to be thoroughly enjoying
the moment, and the hum tells of a few
hundred tongues going as if to make the
most of time until "First Post," when ai'
are supposed to go to their bunks. Thus
the dormitories come in for their share of
clatter, which decreases gradually till the
solemn notes of "Lights Out" sound. Even
then a few late birds are still arriving
"home" for bed, and it is not till about
half-past nine that the noise of talking
ceases, only to be followed by the nasal
language of someone well enclosed in the
arms of Morpheus, and the peal of tin-
watch bells with the answering call from
the look-out, "All's well, sir."
W.A.B.

Why is the present war like the letter
Y ? Because it is the end of Germany an 1

,C.8.: Commandant's breakfast.
A half-pint of doing is worth three gal-
lons of talk.
Dormitory regulations: No smoking
aloud. (Smoke quietly.)
The Aparima Young Men's Bible Class
lias been holding successful meetings on
Tuesday and Friday evenings at 6 o'clock
in the sergeants' mess-room. Capt. Cade
is the president; Mr. R. Blair, Y.M.C.A.
Field Secretary, is leader. Membership is
now 30 odd. A hearty invitation is ex-
tended to men of all ranks. Our object is
to meet the highest needs of men and
search into those things not made by
hand, which go to the development of the
all-round man. We are indebted to the
sergeants' mess for the courtesy they have
shown in placing their room at our dis-
posal.

THE MAGIC OF THE MAIL.
Far to silent solitudes, unheld and
tenantless;
O'er the marshes lone and drear, and belts
of wilderness;
Through the lonely watches of the dark
and brooding night,
Spurning mountain waters, and the ocean's
latent night.
To the far-flung outposts of a mighty
Empire's line,
Speeds the genii burthened with a mission
half divine;
Trusty messenger of fate! Endowed with
spirit wings,
Bearing pregnant tidings of the world's
wide happenings;
Bringing bliss immeasurable, or grief or
woe untold,
All the human passions garnered in liis
trusty hold —
From the home nests to the outlands,
pierced with many a weary trail,
Comes the strange enthralling wonder of
the magic of the mail.
Magic bringing happiness with messages
of weal,
Magic strengthening the weak, and
heartening the leal;
Flying o'er the lasting hill®, and scud-
ding o'er the foam,
That to the farthest wanderer be
brought a touch of home.
Patiently the pioneer toils at his lonely
post,
Waiting for the recompense of years un-
gladly lost;
Comes the hardy 'seaman from his cruising
o'er the seas,
Anxious for the guerdon to make glad his
hours of ease.
Wearily the prodigal is reaching towards
his goal,
Thereat to receive the longed-for unction
to his soul;
In the battered trenches, in the tortured
stricken line,
On the death-strewn waters and amid the
churning brine.
In the lonely fever ward, throughout mid-
night's witching hour,
'Mid the racked and battle-worn, where
death's shadows weirdly lour.
'Mong the worthy and unworthy, those
inside, outside the pale,
Are the slaves abandoned freely to the
magie of the mail.
Magic most enchanting, yet o'er-lording
one and all,
Magic irresistible, to make or rise or
fall,
Drawing deepest homage from the hearts
of all who roam
Till all wayward life returns with salt
tears sobbing home.
Towards a seething maelstrom of a thrice
accursed war,
Speeds the swirling rapids swept from Con-
tinents afar;
Bearing Countless thousands o'er the vast
tormented sea,
Raging at the dastards' threat 'gainst life-
long liberty.
Distant wanderers hear the blood call, and
the inborn wander lust
Brings them swelling out the number with
no shadow of distrust.
And the companies onward speeding, with
each face set as a mask,
In the sending of love tokens lose their
grim appointed task.
From the highest heights they falter, from
the lowest depths arise,
And are gathered by the genii in his tire-
less enterprise,
Each unto the place ordained, the whole a
vast unnumbered tale,
Comforting the slaves abandoned to the
magic of the mail.
Magic in the battered trench, far out
o'er the stricken field;
Swaying mightier weapons than most
ruthless armies wield;
Greater far in conquest than learned
Greece or ancient Rome,
Gathering the blessed incense that makes
fragrant ev'ry home.
Waits the mother patiently, no father may
forget;
Sighs the lone wife drearily, while restless
children fret;
Lists the sweetheart fearfully in dark sur-
rounding gloom,
Lest her life be wilted in the sudden stroke*
of doom.
Oh, the joy of certainty when every fear
is 'stilled,
Oh, the fruit of hope's reward, when ev'ry
hope's fulfilled,
Oh, the bliss expectant when the bliss is
sure,
Oh, the peace of lasting love that will for
time endure.
Oil, the numbness of the ache, when duty
sternly calls,
Oh, the blankness of despair when swift tile
grim stroke falls!
Yet though faith may languish sore, and
hope itself but rise to fail,
There is healing with the hurting of the
magie of the mail.
Magic bringing sympathy with every
stroke of woe,
Magic ever tenderly soft'ning every blow;
Striking in the morning light, and falling
in the gloam,
Forging links that bind our hearts yet
closer, nearer home.
WALTER MUNRO.


A WOMAN'S LETTER.
My Dear Navua,—
Life aboard the Aparima is still whisking
away gaily, and everybody, except the cooks,
are happy. By the way, the salt atmosphere
has had a wonderful effect on the men's
appetites, and the men's appetites have had
a disastrous effect on the -cooks' tempers.
Poor cooks ! Talking about cooks, I always
remember a cook mother employed once. A
nice young fellow he was too. He proposed
to me, and gave me a beautiful diamond
ring. I can tell you, my dear Navua, I
was the happiest girl alive, but the engage-
ment was broken off shortly afterward. Yes,
poor fellow, he did 12 months for that dia-
mond ring.
We are getting very fat on board, and I
don't wonder at it, as oysters and stout are
said to have the effect of making one fat.
Oysters and stout, that's what the men get
- for supper every night. I don't know how
they will look an oyster in the face again.
And now they are complaining of the poul-
try ! Too much of it, they say. Seems
to me that one can never satisfy a man.
We had a grand ball in the officers' mess
last night, and I had a right royal time. I
was simply besieged by officers for dances,
but I would not put one of their names on
my programme. I always prefer men from
the ranks- —what do you say, dear? Here
is an extract from the newspaper report :
"The grand ball held in the officers' mess
last night was a conspicuous success, and
augurs well for the continuance of such
functions. The room was gaily decorated
with stars and stripes, and as the music
commenced, the beautiful flavour of steak
and onions filled the atmosphere. The scene
was a most bewitching one, but there was
a noticeable absence of women. Captain
Cade, O.C. of the ship, wore a smile of
transient happiness, and Captain King wore
himself out. The other officers all looked
what they were not—happy. When the
order was given to commence, each officer
drew himself smartly to attention and asked
if there were any complaints. After the
first dance an adjournment was made to the
refreshment lounge, where, in the absence of
anything else, each officer had a long glass
of soldierly spirit. Then the mess orderlies
appeared with the dry rations, and the ex-
citement became intense. After this
another desperate attack was made on the
ball room, but as the musicians had gone to
sleep it was found necessary to look up
routine orders to see what procedure should
be followed. While this was being done,
however, the orchestra awoke, and struck up
with the National Anthem. It being then
10 o'clock, the officers -had ample time to get
into bed before midnight."
So you see, my dear Navua, what a bril-
liant affair it was, and I am very glad I
went.
By the way, I forgot to tell you that we
have decided to form a ballet corps on
board. It has nothing to do with military
matters. Mr. Blair is the initiator of the
movement, and 1 as we have quite a number
of the light fantastic devotees aboard, in-
cluding Mr. Brambly and Private Sasey,
the new idea should be a great success. I
heard one of the nurses say that the display
of calf of the ordinary ballet girl was quite
impossible alongside many of the nymphs
on board this ship. Makes one blush,
doesn't it?— Yours ever,
APARIMA.
A WAIL FROM THE F'S.
Once more we meet, the •same old crowd,
The lads who left camp with cheers long
and loud;
Over the sea they sped to lands far away,
Heady to do their bit rather than stay.
Good-byes were many as the troops moved
away
On their long, last march for many a day-
In Wellington, where they had made tlieir
name,
For the old Sixteenth had caused no shame.
Slowly the ship moved away from the quay,
Soldiers all shouting "Leave's settled for
me."
As dimmer and dimmer the faces grew,
We turned away to look for our stew.
But we met a surprise that night to be
sure,
For a better meal could not be had ashore.
That night at tea the seats were all full,
Far we had not yet tasted the blue waters
cruel.
But the next day at dinner, Oh, what a
tale!
There were men who you'd have thought
could swallow a whale,
Sprawling and reaching all over the deck,
Reduced from a hero down to a wreck.
We missed our skipper for a couple of days.
What happened we know not, but we guess
from his ways
That he was disabled, or he'd stick to his
post,
For he's .frightened of nothing, not even a
ghost.
Lieut. O'Leary has kept his meals down,
In fact, lie's been grafting since we left tiie
old town.
He's been down to our bunks to see that
"All's well,"
Never growling, where another would see
us to !
Big Baldy put up a marvellous act-
Two runs from the table, but he always
came back.
This cove since we left- lias turned an M.P.,
So keep to the rules or you'll get your C.B.
Long Reid, a good doer, and fond of his
meals,
Was just feeling fit, when he took to his
heels;
Foor Mayfield, a chap you would think by
his chest,
There was nothing on earth he could not
digest,
Rut a victim he fell to the ship's easy roll,
Say nothing more —just bless his poor soul.
Tall Kohlies was seedy, although not so
bad,
He told me himself he thought he'd go
mad;
While Williams, A.G., he stuck to liis bed,
Like a figure on some old coffin head.
Len Morris, he reckoned he cared not a
jot,
But he sneaked away to get rid of his lot.
Jack Staples, who boarded the ship before
us.
Will make a better sailor from now on,
I truss.
He has a big mate in our blacksmith, Curt
Burd,
But he also proved to be no sea bird.
And had you been there to see poor old
Clem,
'Twas cruel to watch him us he lay in his
den.
He did his best to put on a good face,
But his 'tempt was a failure —he was out
of the race.
Then there's "Denny," the sergeant of the
old 3rd Platoon,
Grafting away till the rise of the moon;
If he takes to the trench as he takes to
the sea,
To use him as cover would satisfy me.
While "Jerry," his mate, another sea bird,
Battles along with his work quite unheard.
Have you heard about Noon, one of
F Company's pugs,
When he gets on the sea he's nothing but
rugs,
For the sea proved his master where men
could not score,
And he's got to keep quiet till we get to
the shore.
Our mascot, little Bill, is still to the fore,
You can tell by liis mess he was not born
ashore.
Then there's Dick and Law on table two
eight,
With always a smile as you hand them
your plate.
But it's a change to-day, for the sea has
gone down,
And our ship now resembles a military
town;
The lads are all up enjoying the ride,
But now and again they rush for the side.
"Tis a shame to see such a great compance,
Brought down from trained soldiers by the
smell of tiie sea,
But to look at us now on the old Aparima,
You'd say we're as good as e'er rode on a
steamer.
E. ERASER.
Platoon 22, F Company.
POTTED POITRIE.
Old England alio needs all our aid,
For "an effort is now being nrade,
So for vim, zeal and zest,
We send her our best,
In the best of all skippers, John Cade.
As we marched up old Lambtoir Quay,
And all our old friends we did suay,
1 said to my beau
I'm so happy you kneau
I can hardly believe it is muay.
Said his nibs, the royal Kaiser Bill,
The Allies are fighting me still,
Though I give them the chance,
They can make no advance,
But the Sixteenth are the that will.
We say "chin chin," and "here's luck to
you,"
And other things both old and new,
I've a toast that will beat
The rest up a treat:
"Here's luck to the old Trentham stew.'
Said our wise old friend, Mr. Blair,
"Sow, boys, I liavn't a cair
When it comes to arnusin'
There aint no excusin',
The Y.M.C.A.'s always thair."
The soldier stood up in the trench,
"I've 'ad enough," he cried,
"I've shot six Germans (in my mind),"
And then laid down and died.


THE SIXTEENTH'S FAREWELL.
Air: "I'm Off to Philadelphia in the
Morning."
O, fare you well New Zealand scenes,
On you perforce my memory leans,
And of your many charms we'll ne'er he
scorning;
But we're off to countries stranger
To hardships and to danger,
For we's off upon the transport in the
morning.
O. fare you well, our Trentham home,
To you our thoughts will ofter roam
In foreign camps far from the land wc'ie
horn in;
We'll leave the goose-step curst
To the valiant Twenty-first,
For we're off upon the transport in the
morning.
0. fare you well AVairarapa, too,
Farewell you hearts so .free and true,
For we are weighing anchor in the
dawning;
Our thoughts will backward wander,
And of you we will ponder,
When we're off upon the transport in
the morning.
O, fare you well my lady friends,
For here at last my story ends,
For I have no more rhymes for your
adorning;
Girls demure, and girls more cheery,
Keep your smiles for Jack O'Leary,
He and I leave for old England in the
morning.

THE FOURTH DECREE.
For refreshment after labour, and the old-
time harmony,
AVe in a room adjoining opened in the
fourth degree,
With ns were brethren in IChaki, business-
like in their attire,
And rion-ooms. proud of stripes, new-gained,
and full of martial lire;
And others, lesser units, in the every-day
routine,
Full many a peg unduly squared, and many
a might-have-been;
But on the level all sat down around a
well-spread board,
In the spirit of old harmony, free-will and
one accord.
AA 7 hen the toasts were duly honoured, and
the visitors replied,
The Captain prosed an empire, and the
Anzae heroes vied;
The subs in like strain followed, and from
them took their cue;
Though all gave praise ungrudgingly, 'and
credit where 'twas due,
Until the Master rose and said, "Our
brother at the rear,
Might draw some nearer to the front, for
we would like to hear
A word from him, ere he goes hence, it
might be worth his while
To speak out for his brethren, who are in
the rank and file.
And answering the Master, the other simply
told
TTow, for the great adventure, he, with
others, had enrolled;
"I heard the call as many heard, and dared
not turn, aside,
Mayhap 'twas something in the blood,
mayhap 'twas native pride.
My folk had helped to haulk the foe's im-
placable desigu,
And were with those that kept intact the
lone unbroken line,
.Since then but one desire was ever present
in my heart,
That with them in this enterprise T, too,
may have a part.
Should I get through, whate'er the price
my great reward would be
To get hack to my Mother Lodge, so far
across the sea,
To sit with those who led mo from the
shades of darksome night,
And brought me forth with solemn rite
into the glorious light,
AVho taught me in the mystic death that
life would never cease,
That one passed from this warring sphere
to one of lasting peace."
ITe ceased, and on the company a solemn
stillness fell,
Till the Master, in a kindly voice, broke
on the silent snell;
Our brother, like our Kipling, keeps his
mother's memory green.
And every widow's son will do who keeps
his records clean.
None are so honoured as the first who
formed the mystic tic.
And taught the working tools to use, and
the ancient rules anplv;
And tho' he sail o'er all the seas and roam
from shore to shore.
Their admonitions reach him, as they did in
days of yore;
And he in spirit answers them, sot free
from selfish bonds.
He at each ancient landmark with willing
voice, responds,
So may we at the last landmark awaken
to the call,
And rising in our Order, greet the Master
of us all.
AVALTER MUNRO.
THE FIRST LANDING.
And it came to pass that on the fourteenth
day, when the sun was still higli in the
heavens, they came upon a land which is
called Australia, which is called Fremantle.
And the hearts of them were made glad,
for it was yet many days since they had seen
land, and the throats of them were dry.
And a terrible thirst came upon them, arid
many were the exclamations occasioned
thereby.
For as yet they had only tasted a very
nauseating beverage called tea.
And a voice was heard to cry among them
saying "Behold ye the city of Fremantle,
and behold ye also many pubs in the streets
thereof.
"Whereas, if a man thirstest, therefore
shall he quench that thirst. Let us there-
fore anoint our throats with the wine of this
sunny land."
And another voice spake unto him saying ;
"My oath !"
And the voice of the multitude was heard
crying loudly.
While they were thus stilll shouting, the
voice of the Groat High Chief was heard ex-
claiming : "Remember ye that ye are in a
sister state and that ye behave yoursel/es
accordingly."
And they answered ; " 'ear, 'ear."
Then they went about the town doing
good.
And it came to pass that on the following
day there was much sickness among the
multitude, for many of them had their heads
in slings.
There was much gnashing of teeth, and
they did bemoan their fate.
And when the multitude was gathered
together, it was found that many of them
were missing, and the Great . High Chief
was sore afraid.
But when yet another day passed, the
prodigals had returned, whereat the Great
High Chief rejoiced, and gathered them
unto him saying "Three days C.8."
And they marvelled thereat.
Then the ship set sail for a foreign land.

have the reputation of being a sporty lot
of fellows. There is Ikey with his Brown
legs. He got them by the Mills where
Bunnys roam. They are so very Little

Jackson kills them with Cains, and Rolls

is a AA'hite man. He keeps a Taylor an.l
a Messenger. The latter Coles the fire for
twopence per night, and then roams the
AA 7 oods for Joy. But AA f att about McLean,

INAUGURAL SPORTS MEETING.
A PRONOUNCED SUCCESS.
The inaugural bi-weekly sports meeting
was held aboard Transport 61 on Wednes-
day, September 13, in perfect weather con-
ditions. A sports committee was formed to
promote and control the gathering, and the
success of the meeting reflects much credit
on the commitee.
Sports' meetings will be held every Wed-
nesday and Saturday. The actual boxing
championships will be preceded by a series
of four 2-minute round no-decision bouts,
extending over a period of perhaps three
weeks. This will give the men ample oppor-
tunity to get fit. Unit commanders have
been invited to raise a prize fund by circu-
lation of voluntary subscription lists, so that
the value of championship prizes will be
commensurate with the liberality of those
interested.
The sub-committee comprises Lieut.
Quane, Sergt. E. Stewart, Sergt. Keesing,
Pte. Lockyer, and Mr. Daniell, chief officer,
secretary.
The success of the first gathering was due
in no small measure to the untiring efforts
of Mr. Daniell. Lieut. Quane's knowledge
of the individual temperament of his men
made him a valuable adjunct to the commit-
tee from a match-making point of view.
The following were the officials : Hon.
surgeons, Capts. Robertson and Simcox;
M.C., Mr. Daniel; timekeeper, Lieut.
Fraser; referees, Sergt. Stewart (boxing),
Pte. Lockyer (wrestling).
HEAVYWEIGHT.
Te Whata v. Rangiaho.—This pair were
evenly matched in size and weight, except
that the former had a trifle longer reach.
Te Whata opened hostilities with a series of
long lobby straight lefts, connecting more
or less frequently. His opponent, however,
who affected the crouch, soon got wise, and
evaded with a clever duck. Te Whata, who
was always the aggressor, had "Rangi" in
hot water on th eropes, when the latter
clinched, and let rip right and left to the
body, leaving both sparring for an opening
when corners went.
Round 2.—Te Whata again commenced to
force matters, but a right swing to the
ear steadied him. Following up his advan-
tage, "Rangi" essayed two smart lefts, one
of which was neatly blocked. Te Whata
came again, and kept up a fusilade, but the
round ended with honours even.
Round 3.—Both men jumped out smartly,
and Te Whata, intent on administering the
coup de grace, sent across an assortment of
left and right hooks, and soon had his man
ducking as though his life depended upon it.
"Rangi's" cleverness helped him to dry
land, and a clinch ensued. "Rangi" got in
a stinging right swing, but was repaid with
interest by his opponent. Both were well
tried when the gong sounded.
Round 4. —The brief respite infused ginger
into both men. Te Whata, with a left to
the head, and a right to the body, had his
man taking refuge early in a clinch.
"Rangi," however, surprised his supporters
by tearing loose, and pumping in two swift
lefts, stinging Te Whata to action' He
replied in kind with well-directed straight
and hooked blows. ""Rangi" did not like
things at this stage, and was clearly dis-
tressed when the judicious time-keeper ap-
plied a slightly premature close to an admir-
able bout.
LIGHTWEIGHT.
Sergt. Keesing (A Coy., 9st 31b.) v. Pte.
Noon (F Coy., 9st. 71b.).—Noon opened with
a straight left, which Keesing promptly
back-moved. Noon kept well up to his man,
and was soon busy with his left, followed
alternately with short rights to the head and
body. Keesing contented himself with a
few well-timed lefts. The round ended with
honours even, and both men warming up to
their work.
Round 2.—Keesing assumed the offensive,
and got home on several occasions with his
long rangy left. Noon's footwork, how-
ever, stood him in good stead, and coming
. back with a rattle, both swapped punches,
and fell into a clinch, where Noon appeared
to advantage with his short-arm work, and
scored further with a nice upper-cut in the
breakaway. Keesing had the upper hand in
an exchange that followed, plying his left
and right to some purpose, on his oponent's
tricky fast moving head. Time was sounded
after an interesting round.
Round 3.—Noon opened with some fast
lefts, some of which were countered in good
style, and in a fast exchange on the western
ropes, an unoffending officer, whosfe interest
allowed his head to wander into the danger
zone, was the recipient of a stray flip on the
nose. Hostilities were transferred to Kees-
ing's angle, where he had his man thinking,
and after some good in-fighting, Keesing got
home with the famous Milburn-Saylor rab-
bit-killer punch. A feature of this round
was the number of snappy lefts that pene-
trated Noon's effective guard.
Round 4.—Noon forced matters early, and
had Keesing back-moving a series of left
and right punches to the head and body.
Keesing .then took a hand, and used a short
right, varied with left hooks to the head.
Keesing's left, which followed, was promptly
blocked, and in the ensuing clinch Noon's
incessant half-arm work was effective. A
right upper-cut coming away was smartly
blocked by the Aucklander. The gong
found the two engaged in a brilliant ex-
change of long range work. This bout was
highly interesting, and much cleverness was
shown on both sides. A meeting in the
finals is looked forward to with much in-
terest.
WELTER WEIGHT.
Pte. "Booth (F Coy., lOst. 61b.) v. Pte.
Fiori (A Coy., lOst. 61b.). —Booth, cool and
upstanding, is a clever two-handed boxer,
and in the earlier stages met the rushes of
his smaller though sturdier opponent by
well-timed counters. Fiori very seldom used
a straight punch, and his hay-making swings
left him more or less open to Booth's short
jabs. The first round was very fast, and
both men were all out. The referee
cautioned Fiori for claiming Booth's left.
Round 2.—Booth opened with a nice left,
Fiori replying with a stiff right to the ribs.
Fiori began to press, and the fight was car-
ried to a neutral angle, where Booth got the
worst of a sortie. Nothing daunted, how-
ever, he fought back with confidence, and
soon had his opponent on the run. Fiori
here swung his left, but Booth ducked, and
shot a smart hook to the point, whereupon
Fiori came back with left and right to the
body in quick succession.
Round 3. —Good work on both sides saw
Booth tiring, and Fiori gave him no rest in
close. The younger man, however, fought
back in brilliant patches with a good double
left. He frequently crossed Fiori effectively.
At corners Fiori was hammering away with
his round arm swings.
Round 4.—Fiori rushed in with undimin-
ished vigour, and was met with a left on
the ndSe. He continued to force, but Booth
repeatedly beat his punch. At this stage
Booth stopped a heavy right to the point,
followed by a left to the body, and had to
clinch for safety. The men broke in the
centre of the ring, and Fiori tore in again,
and dropped Booth with a stiff jolt on the
point. Booth got up instantly, and was sub-
jected to another battering when the gong
sounded. Booth has a convincing style, and
should be in the business end of the coming
championships.
MIDDLE-WEIGHT.
Pte. Martin (A Coy.) list. lib. v. Corpl.
O'Loughlin (A.5.0., list.). —These were a
well-matched pair, and while Martin was the
more polished boxer, the man with the Irish
name certainly made him go some. O'Lough-
lin carried the fight to his man right
throughout, Martin being content to poke
out his left at the right moment as his man
came in. In fact, his timing was the neat-
est seen during the afternoon. O'Loughlin
was more inclined to mix it, and he did
with no mean success. O'Loughlin drew
first blood with a left hook to the mouth,
followed by a right to the ear.
Round 2. —Martin settled down to box his
man, but the furious onslaughts of O'Lough-
lin called for all the evasive tactics he could
muster. A rally of good body punches by
Martin were counter-balanced by the A.S.O.
man's punishing left. An exchange of long-
range punches saw Martin to advantage.
His rights to the jaw were particularly im-
pressive.
Round 3.—By mutual arrangement, this
bout was limited to three rounds. O'Loughlin
proceeded to wipe off the shade Martin had
on him at this stage, and his efforts were
certainly crowned with some measure of suc-
cess, for his tear-away methods had Martin
on the defensive most of the time.
BLINDFOLDED BOUTS.
McConkey (F Coy.) v. McMurtrie (Div.
Sig.).—This bout was rather a disappoint-
ment, as McMurtrie got his man early with
a right swing, which sent his countryman to
the canvas. If McMurtrie could not see ;
then he is gifted with a prescience which
should earn him good money after the war is
over.
Mangai (Rua) v. Tawhara. —This was a
scream, rivalling the efforts of Chaplin at
his best. When the popular "Rua" stepped
into the hempen square, a roar of approval
went un. The Chief Officer announced that
the contest was to be governed by Rafferty's
rules, and the ensuing tussle proved that the
natives fully understood the meaning of the
term. The lighter man was wont to go out
on a mine-sweeping expedition, scouring the
ring in search of his quarry with his arms
going like flails. Rua, on the other hand,
was more passive, and reserved his energy


till the actual contact came, when he
blossomed forth into a veritable tornado.
They hit each other anywhere from the heel
to the back of the neck. The ludicrous ex-
pression on Rua's face was alone worth the
money, the pained anticipation of impend-
ing danger sending up shrieks of laughter.
At one stage Rua lost his bandage, but Tau
hara, in blissful ignorance, continued to
carve weird figures out of the atmosphere
with such ferocity that the referee and
second were within an ace of being annihil-
ated whilst vainly endeavouring to explain
to the active one that Rua was temporarily
hors de combat. This was easily the most
popular event of the afternoon, and Rua has
the condolences of his many admirers in the
loss of his tooth.
WRESTLING.
CUMBERLAND.
Corpl. Sawyer (list. Olbl) v. Sergt. Laloli
(lOst. 61b.). —Best of three falls. The first
fall was given to Sawyer, and the next two
were gained by Laloli, after some solid
work.
CATCH-AS-CATCH-CAN
(Heavy-weight).
Corpl. Treaves (E Coy.) v. Sergt. Holton
(E Coy.). —Both men were well matched,
and after a long and interesting struggle,
Sergt. Holton pinned his man to the mat in
good style.
Corpl. Smith and Pte. Smith (Maori De-
tails) gave an exhibition bout in native
style.
Nurse McKenzie won the nail-driving com-
petition.

BOXING.
BY "MIDNIGHT."
To enlighten the fistic knowledge of
some, who arc more or less ignorant of
this grand game of "at oush," commonly
known as the "art fistic," we here abridge
a few notes. Boxing may best be de-
scribed as an art, or better still as a dis-
ease, in which two combatants satisfy their
blood-thirsty desires, by battering at each
other very hard, the one trying to damage
the other as little as possible—we don t
think. This is but a vague definition, hut
as the general knowledge of the game is
also very vague, perhaps this- will he ex-
cused.
This noble art lias been declared by past
masters of the game as a very good one,
in fac-t the very best when left alone.
The word boxing comes from a nearly
forgotten old Greek word—Bockso, to
crack. Boc, I hit; Bock, I smack; Bockso,
1 crack. It was this word the enterprising
celestial had in mind when lie invented
his sth of November fireworks, though
there have been many different sorts of
crackers since those dark ages.
It can truthfully be claimed as the best
means of self-defence (except the bayonet)
and every man on board the ship should
avail himself of the opportunity to learn.
(No doubt the writer will he willing to
give free tuition—Ed. note.) Lessons
can be had any evening between 5.30 and
6.30 o'clock. The Maories are willing to
act as sparring partners. Undertaker's
expenses will not bo guaranteed.
The number of men already taking part
is very gratifying. Some are still a bit
"green," but this is attributed to the fast
lives they have of late been leading. The
recent few days' leave did not improve
matters as much as was expected, and it
was therefore a little surprising to find
that some men even had the temerity to
blow after a few short rounds. The "green-
ness" is gradually wearing off, however,
and in some cases an excellent, "form" is
being displayed.
Keen interest is being displayed, in view
of the fact that contests are held every
Wednesday, and some fine "exhibitions"
should be given during training hours.
The most prominent exponent aboard is
"Peter," the short, thick-set (we did not
say thick-headed) F Company boy, whose
fighting tactics are very amusing to the
crowd. In passing it would be just as well
to say that Peter's fighting qualities are
not his only amusing tactics.
A very good welter weight is Ashman,
from Hawke's Bay. He biffs and jump:
into it like a jumping Jehoshophat (origi-
nal!), and woe unto the man who catches
the full weight of that right upper, for he
is a sure "gonner" (not original!) Another
welter showing very prominently is "Esse,"
of Lower Hutt. With a good defence an 1
a hard punch, he stands a good chance at
forthcoming contests. Sergt. Keesing, of
A Company, is also a good man. Prior to
joining the forces, this man was runner
up in the featherweight championship in
Auckland. There is also young- "Snowy"
with the hard wallop; and Fiori, the
whirlwind fighting man. These three lads
are a credit to their Company, Among a
host of other good boys worthy of mention
is "Stan," who hails from Wellington. Ho
has evidently not been going along to
Tim's "gym." for nought. And now ye
fight fans, look out for dark horses, there
being one in particular in the person of
'Enery, alias "Diamond," who hails from
Sunny Napier. This lad has been keeping
very quiet (oil ye dark horses), but watch,
lest ye arouse his peaceful slumbers. Mar-
tin is also another clever boy who wit!
stand up to anything his own weight.
So much for the Pakeha, but we must
not forget the Maori. We give them cre-
dit for providing many mirth provoking
exhibitions of "slather." As is often, the
case, wholehearted amusement can he had
in watching a boxing contest. The Maoris
provide plenty of it. When one looks at
a pair of these giants one is apt to re-
call the good old prize fighting days. (The
writer knows of what ho speaks, Ed.). No
matter how hot the fight, at its conclu-
sion the contestant is as friendly as ever,
and it is not an uncommon thing, when one
has received a blow, to see the other stop
and inquire if he is hurt. The best ex-
ponents among our brown brothers arc
Jackson, Taylor, Edwards, Rogan, Kemp,
and "Paddy."
Quite an innovation are the blindfolded
contests. Both Pakeha and Maori alike
enjoy this pastime, and the combatants
well earn the applause, for many are the
risks they run.
STARTLING ANNOUNCEMENT.
A record number of entries have been
received for the all British tournament to
he held shortly, every boxer of note hav-
ing signified his intention of taking pari.
Articles have definitely been signed by
short-legged Peter, the holder of the fea-
ther-weight championship, and Fred Ashy,
the big black eye champion, to eat hard
boiled eggs for a stake of sixpence a-side,
and a silk purse, made out of a sow's ear,
the trophy of the feathered world. This
white hope, whose most recent achieve-
ment was the administering of a blow out
on the thirty-first egg to the undefeated
"chick chewer" is at present in training on
the foredeck, and experts who have seen
him at work on the swallowing ball, and
observed his methods of treating home-
made doughnuts, predict an easy victory
for him, notwithstanding that his oppon-
ent has an advantage of three inches in
mouth measurement, and a very large
cubic capacity. The match is expected to
take place in the ring on Number 5
hatch, and 'Enery Diamond has consented
to act as referee. The eggs required for
the contest will not be, more than six
months old, and will be supplied gratis by
the canteen committee, a special raid hav-
ing been made on the stores for the occa-
sion.
In nine cases out of ten sickness is brought
about by oold feet.
Never do things by halves. If you can't
get any fresh water to wash yourself, don't
wash at all.
The -man who goes out on week-end
usually comes back with a weak head,


ABOARD THE APARIMA.
The Sixteenth hoys are now afloat.
Some on the Aparima,
While far behind are more of them,
Aboard another steamer.
Tho' life has changed these last few weeks.
We are a happy crew,
For aboard the Aparima,
They give us plenty stew.
With us are the Maoris,
With Rua to the fore;
And there's always lively boxing,
When Rua takes the floor.
Some of them sleep on the dock,
They might easily do worse,
But if a big sea breaks aboard,
Well then you'll hear a curse.
I must not forget 19th Platooon
1 can tell you they're some "case's."
And when they came away from Perth,
They left some battered faces.
Vet when they called for volunteers,
For a boxing bout,
Though our sergeant chased us hard and
strong,
Not a mail turned out.

To us lias been a treat,

When again I walk a street.
And when we get to land again,
I think you'll all agree,
Though we may have to rough it,
Its bettor than the sea.
SHEER DUCK,

THE CHARCE OF THE BUCKET
BRICADE.
(An apology to Tennyson has already been
forwarded).
Pitch and roll, pitch and roll, pitch and roll
onward,
Over the roaring wave,
Tossed the Nine Hundred.
Reached all those warriors there,
Reached as they heaved in air,
Reached as with torture rare,
Raced the propeller.
Forward the bucket brigade,
0. the wild charge they made
With their fruit salad.
Right to the rail they broke,
Vanished their load like smoke,
Back where the voices broke; .
So runs the ballad.
Groakings to right of them,
Croakings to left of them,
Croakings above them
Threatenend and thundered.
Theirs' not to take a spell,
Theirs' not to curse the swell.
Theirs' hut to go like hell,
When man and dinner sundered.
Honour the bucket brigade,
Honour the charge they made,
Serving the army.
Ne'er will their glory fade,
Ne'er die the name they made,
Ne'er yet while Captain Cade
Skippers the transport.

MAGISTERIAL.
(Before His Honour, the Administrator of
Injustice).
There was another heavy day at the court
yesterday. The charge sheet was heavy.
The atmosphere was heavy, and the re-
porter's head was heavy. Fines inflicted
were also heavy, but as nobody had any
money with which to pay them, the last
didn't matter very much.
A very desperate character named Fraser,
alias 0.8., was charged with refusing to
leave the ship at Fremantle when granted
six hours' leave. He was ordered to report
to the doctor immediately.
A man answering to the name of Martin
was accused of over-feeding certain com-
panies, to wit, A, E. and F, and was ordered
to go on an over-full diet himself for a few
days.
A GRAVE OFFENCE.
Six men were charged with being rogues
and vagabonds, inasmuch as they had in-
sufficient visible means of support. One man
said he had been out of work for a long
time, and being very hungry was wondering
where he would get something to eat, when
he saw a shilling on the ground. He at
once "sprang to it," but "fell in," as the
coin was a fake. He saw another man
"double up" for the same purpose, and as
he didn't want to be the only one fooled, he
"left right" there and then.
Another man said that what the other
man said was nonsense. He had nothing to
do with the matter. Being thirsty, he called
a "halt" in front of a hotel, and being in
the "right form" for a drink, at once pro-
ceeded to "charge" his glass. Before, "re-
tiring" for the night, another man came up
to him, and asked hint for a small loan.
Being a soldier, he could not refuse, so gave
him an "extended order" on his next pay.
He then got into a cab, but the "left wheel"
broke just as the cab was about to start.
He then thought of going to a theatre, but
not being the "right dress," went home.
The other men's evidence was taken con-
jointly. They said they had been in the
same hotel for a, "gargle," and when thev
thought it was time the house was "about
turning" it on, they decided to "stand
easy" for a time. They then "gave the
order" for another drink, and refused to
pay for it, whereat the barmaid said that
if she were "inclined" to shout she would,
but the bar was just being cleaned, and she
could not shout until it had received a
thorough "wash out."
The barmaid was then called, but as six
answered to the same name, the case became
slightly involved. It was then discovered
that the judge had been asleep during the
hearing of the evidence, so it was decided
to "dismiss" the case.


THE SONG OF THE SIXTEENTH.
(Tune: "John Brown's Body.)
We're a iolly lot of soldier boys,
And always out to work;
There's no one here, who feels it hard,
And no one who will shirk.
The grumbler and the malcontent,
With us lie does not lurk,
As we go sailing along.
From New Zealand's shore we're sailing,
The terrors of the deep unavailing,
To help our Empire's cause from failing,
And do our bit for her.
In Trentham Camp, where we were trained,
In all that we should do,
From forming fours and company drill,
To shooting straight and true,
We put our minds on to our work,
And carried it right through,
Without e'en a complaint.
There we did all our training,
In mock battles daily feigning.
No matter whether sunshine or raining,
We marched merrily along.
Tn France somewhere we go to fight
Old England's strongest foe.
The Huns and all their subterfuge,
And dirty tricks so low,
Will ne'er be able to frighten us,
Of this we'll let them know,
As we go charging along.
Oh, won't that be ripping,
To feel our hands the bavonet gripping.
And some foul Hun's head a-splitting,
As we go marching along.
Our loved ones we have left behind,
To them we've said good-bye:
They know and feel we'll do our bit
When called upon to try.
Our hearts 'are filled with thoughts of them.
And for them we would die,
And for the Old Countree.
Presents to us they are sending,
E'en our socks they are a-mending,
To our comfort thev are 'tending,
As we go fighting along.
As we march out to the front,
In khaki's drab array,
Our voices we'll lift un and sing
Glad songs throughout the day;
And not forget to give our friends
A real British hooray.
As we go marching along.
There you're bound to hear us singing,
Hear our merry voices ringing,
Envy to the German bringing.
Who cannot sport a song.
Our officers indulgent are,
And always patient, too:
The're never tired of helping us,
And the least that we can do
To stick to them and back them up,
Remain for ever true,
As we go marching along.
Yes, we'll hear the bnllets pinging,
Hear the shrapnel's constant dinging.
Then we'll prove that they are bringing
The old Sixteenth along.

THE LAST REVEILLE.
At Mons, on the field of battle,
'Mid the roar of the guns and shell,
Whe're the rivers are red with the life-
blood shed,
Where Briton and German fell.
There nation is fighting nation
For the sake of a plighted word;
For when honour calls, whate'er befalls
Old England will answer the call.
It was "Charge for the guns," cried the
captain.
And they eagerly sprang to obey.
Now they're in with the steel, see the
Germans reel,
Nor wait to claim "The Day."
But with legions that sadly outnumber
Back surging they threaten to crash,
Surely God's Bight Hand's with that Bri-
tish band
As they steady and check that rush.
But they have to be pushed back by
inches,
Or they die with their face to the foe,
For they die for the right—'twas a dread-
ful sight
For brave men are stricken low.
But they cheerfully suffer their death-
wound,
For there in that earthly Hell,
'Mid the cannon's roll each has rendered
his soul
To his Maker—we know 'tis well.
Though never again in this earth world
Will they hear the loud bugle sound,
Though they're laid at rest by their com-
rades blest
In the honour they sought and found.
Yet once more in the ears of their com-
rades
Shall the call of the trumpet ring,
When they hear the last great Reveille
Blast,
When they rise to salute their King.

NAMING THE PAPER.
The old time saying, "What's in a name,"
has held the editor down to such an extent
the last few days that he has nightly gone
to sleep dreaming of names, and has wakened
saying names that would not be quite the
thing within the hearing of decent people
(soldiers don't count). In fact, for a few
days he went off his stew. To relieve his
mind on that score, it was decided to write
suggestions for the naming of the paper, and
a something like 70 or 80 replies were re-
ceived within the appointed time, and many
others after. Had some of the suggestions
been given effect to there is no doubt that
the sale of the paper would have been
trebled, but as the publishers would have
also been landed in trouble, it was decided
to count them (the names) out. Among
the more respectable were "The Recruit,"
"The Victory." "The Sea-Bug," "The
Kiwi." and "The Octopus." The last was
the editor's suggestion, so the committee ap-
pointed to make the final choice immediately
scratched it out. Eventually it was decided
that the suggestion of the skipper to name
the paper "The Dominion Afloat" be given
effect to, and the next best in their respective
order are also printed on the cover, so as
to detract sufficiently from its beauty.
THE LIGHTER SIDE.
ENTERTAINING THE BOYS.
"A life on the ocean wave" sounds very
well when set to music, but the actual life
would be very dull—particularly on a troop-
ship—were not something done in the way of
promoting the social side. Thanks to Mr.
Blair, of the Y.M.C.A., the entertainment
of the boys on the Aparima has not been
left in abeyance. Shortly after, the trans-
port left Wellington, a social committee—
mainly through Mr. Blair's efforts — was set
up, and since then the committee has been
very active. Weekly concerts have been held
in the mess room, and it has been a matter
of no small surprise to many the amount of
talent on board. Moreover, the entertain-
ments have all been well attended, and it
says much for the efforts of the committee
that there has never been any undue crowd-
ing, and every man has been given a fair
chance to see what is going on.
The Maoris and the Tongans have given
much pleasure by their singing and hakas,
and judging by the enthusiasm they have al-
ways displayed, the performers have derived
as much pleasure from their performance as
have the onlookers.
A glee club and an orchestra have been
formed, and already those on board have had
a taste of their respective qualities.
The committee's work is now in full swing,
and before this pleasant voyage has come
to an end, it is hoped, several more enter-
tainments of the same merit will be sub-
mitted.
However, the efforts of the promoter have
gone further than this. A sports committee
has been set up, and sports are held every
Wednesday afternoon, so that Wednesday—
with the concert at night—is quite a gala
day aboard. A football club has also been
formed, and at time of writing draughts
and euchre tournaments were being ar-
ranged. There is also ample reading matter
on the ship, so that good and wholesome
entertainment should be denied none.
In nothing undertaken has the spirit of
the officers been found lacking. The officers
have always contributed freely at the
weekly concerts, and have played no little
part in promoting the various sports clubs.
Indeed, off parade, the officers and N.C.O.'s
are quite with the men, so that all on board
are as one big happy family.

RANDOM RECOLLECTIONS OF
SEVERAL MEN IN A BOAT.
H.M.S. "Sinbad" presented a hand-
some picture as she rose and fell on the
blue swell. On the quarter-deck stood
Aladdin, monarch of all he surveyed.
But he was in a very black mood.
Entering his stateroom, he gave the
Lamp a most ferocious rub, almost a
scratch. In flew Dal Gleish the Genie
with the reckless speed of a Trentham
troop train, and fell over his master's
"come hither" boots, which stood ready
for use among the fair at the next port,
coiled down Bristol fashion.
"Have a care, damn you," roared the
owner, "there are only two other pairs in
the world like that, one in the British
Museum and one belonging to those Spe-
cialists. Same _ men are running that
'warrior's hat' line of business. Quite
unobtainable."
"Yes, sir. I've heard of those 'wonder-
ful boys.' They need good boots—the
wicked walk in slippery places. They say
they are great guns on fatigues, work like
a machine. But signal success is seldom
attained without much buzzing and dili-
gent tongue-wagging, as St. Thomas
quaintly wrote in his 'Epistle to Erasmus-
sen.' I remember when Mar Tin and I
signed on as cook's mates with Noah it
was a fair "
"AVash out," said Aladdin, coldly; "but
no, stay," he added, as. the slave began to
convert himself into an apple dumpling,
'"talking of arks reminds me. Where is
the "Aparima" at present? Here's more
trouble from Neptune. He says they
can't possibly have things ready at the
Line in less than six months now he's
under the War Office, and he fears the
"Aparima" will be there in five. Appar-
ently he lent his trident to the Kaiser for
that Jutland affair and it got rather bent.
Now Q.M.G. Stores won't issue another
until he sends in a return in quadrupli-
cate' showing—
(a) Why it was lost.
(b) Where it was lost.
(c) Where it is now.
(d) Total cost since date of attestation.
(c) Address of next-of-kin.
Look into it at once. And send in the
Lady Mayoress of Perth!"
"Yes, sire," said Dal, cocking his ear
at the word lady and hurrying into the
outer office. Taking a small tom-tom
from his after-hatch, he played the Mo-
hammedan call to prayer; "Come all ye
faithful," banged on the foc'sle head, and
cried "Open Sesame!" Out came' Ali
Baba, alone.
"Where are the forty thieves, Ali?"
asked Dal Gleish.
"Away, sir; stealing another march on
the Navua," replied the slave.
Deprived of assistance from that quar-
ter, Dal took down his album of National
Nautical Heroes and turned the leaves
quickly. Jolly Roger, Blue Peter, Ben
Backstay, Union Jack—they were all
there. Lord Nelson, with a page to him-
self, was shown standing on an old rustic
bridge' at midnight, "streaming the logs."
Inset—a beautiful fac simile of an old-
fashioned Larboard Watch about to strike
the hour of 12.
At last he came to Davy Jones, fondly
remembered as the originator of the great
Locker system; took his number, rang
him up, and was soon on the trail.
"Seven days out of Fremantle," he
muttered, "that will be anything up to
100 miles."
After a discreet cough and a slight
pause 1m re-entered The Presence with his
information.
"Allah il Allah," said his master, and
they only left N.Z. two months ago. Bring
Oapt. McDonald at once. Also Capt. Cade.
This lady says that since he and his men
left, 471 fair maids of Perth have died of
a broken heart. Away with you!"
"Aye! aye! sir! Away it is!" Snatching
up his periscope and jamming 40 iron ra
tions into liis accumulator, Dal Gleisli
bounded into his Er.nis and Kirker, a fine
new machine with rather much polish on
it for active service.
Hastily consulting a little work by King
and Waters of Chart House called "God
knows where we are" he set a fair course
4 bells 3 fingers right and pulled the trig-
ger. A tremendous noise without any
effect was the only result —just like an
artillery action.
The Genie began to emit clinkers and
gun-cotton fumes—a sure sign of a gather-
ing storm.
"Is Marsden there?" lie bellowed.
"Here, sir!" answered a squeaky little
voice,
"How's her head?"
"Straight for the winch-handle, sir!"
"Strange!" muttered Dal, "very strange:
Is she calibrated, Marsden?"
"Aye! aye! sir! Time fuse. All ready
laid for double displacement, switch angle,
search and sweep. Clinometer steady at
4X."
"4X," said Dal to himself softly, "that
smacks of home and staple products!"
"Whit wey dae ye no praiss thon wee
thing instead of pullin' it!" said a grubby-
little man in an old Provost uniform, who
was standing in the cinder pit marshalling
the stokers.
"I believe you're right, Monty," said
the Genie, "let 'er " but just at that
moment us rushed Sim, Cox' of the cap-
tain's gig, and said lie must have a tow at
once.
Somewhat exasperated by all these de-
lays Dal gave him one', fair on the 03
Cocyx, and an interesting little affair
sprang up like a mushroom; to the intense
enjoyment of all the spectators.
In rushed Sim, Cox of the captain's gig,
with a long long swing and a strong strong
swing, but blocking cleverly with both feet,
Dal held him off. Closer and ever closer
surged the onlookers until a final heave
connected Sim's swing with the ear of the
ship's blacksmith.
"What the h- !" yelled that astonished
citizen, and immediately took over the
whole contract, hammer and tongs.
For a long time the battle laged with
desperate fury, but at last Vulcan slipped
a swing, and put one across to the point
and Sim sank quietly to rest.
He woke up at reveille to murmur,
sleepily, ''Sister Watt are the wild waves
saying?"
"All's well, dear!" replied she, with deep
emotion, wiping her nose on a triangular
bandage.
In the meantime Dal was well away.
Putting his helm hard on, he piped all
hands to port with the O.C. John Hops,
where each man set his own glass, and
saw that it never fell to water level.
Unfortunately, in the excitement, Dal
Gleish had forgotten the effect of his iron
rations on the needle, and had omitted to
aim off for wind, drift, and movement, so
even after boxing the compass, it was a
day or two before they drew a bead on a
steamer. By dint of reversing the engines,
the Genie managed to keep above it while
he conducted a reconnaissance.
A tremendous air of bustle and activity
pervaded the ship. All over the decks men
lay smoking, reading and sleeping in the
setting sun. The crow's nest was full of
warblers, playing larks on the early bunk-
ers. Under an awning amidships some 20
officers were playing poker. A tall man,
with glasses, and a Y.M.C.A. badge, had
just lifted the pool.
"Looks like old Blair," said the Genie,
"always was a sport. I wonder if he's got
his two-headed penny with him."
In one corner, a rosy little officer with
curly hair was singing lustily that tender
ditty:
"Oh! Leary is ma Dearie,
Ma Dearie! ma Dearie!
Oh! Leary is ma Dearie,
The wild Irish Bhoy!"
accompanied somewhat Worsely than
usual by a pianist, who was greatly dis-
turbed by the efforts of a dark foreign-
looking gentleman, who insisted that more
New tone was wanted in the performance.
An excited individual was rushing about
the deck followed by two buglers, eacli
carrying a stack of orders, one marked
"To be done immediately," the other "Not
at any price."
"Blow up a muster parade, bugler!" lie
said, snappishly, "and hand me that old
one about 'washing socks.' That'll do for
to-day."
No. 1 immediately produced the required
order, while No. 2 winked at one of the
Sisters, who saucily put out her tongue.
"What's this" roared the adjutant to No,
2. "Where's your order? How often have
I got to tell you that 1 must always have
both orders? How do I know which one
I'll give out? Dismiss the parade, bugler,
and call another one!"
So saying he hurried away to ask the
head serang to issue instruction for leave
in South Africa early enough to leave
plenty of time to understand them, and to
arrange about some more pleasant route
marches.
"Might be the adjutant!" muttered Dal
Gleish, "but where's the skipper? Ah,
there he is talking to the O.C. Draft.
Business, no doubt."
At that moment the ship rolled, and a
glint of vivid scarlet flashed in the sun
between the two fighting men. At the
sight the little policeman broke into
quavery song in the key of two flats:
"How happy could I be with either,
Were t'other dear charmer away."


"Silence below," roared the Genie, but,
humming softly to himself all the same:
"I know a lassie, a bonnie Ilieland lassie."
But was this the Aparima? Further in-
vestigation was necessary.
High on the fore peak above the liars'
den stood Daniel, in a little pink shirt, ant
a fresh complexion, instructing N.C.O.'s
how to navigate by Watson's Three Stars.
Further aft a very stout officer with red
hair and a loud aggressive manner was
parading the soldiers by platoons, while
he explained to them a fme now scheme
for popularising the canteen.
"Now then, men!" he was saying, with
an air of resignation to stern duty. "Next
pay day I'll stop 2s. lid. from each man
on board, and the canteen will be open til 1
midnight. To the man who buys the
501 st tin of Capstan full strength will be
given half the money collected. The other
half will he set aside to cover running ex-
penses. If that's not enough I'll make up
the deficit personally, and of course if it's
too much I'll look after the balance. I've
given the matter a lot of thought, men,
and you'll all see that I have your in-
terests at heart. If anyone can't see that
he will of course be crimed, and can state
his case at Commandant's Orderly Room
to-morrow. I want to make life as plea-
sant as possible for all hands, and above
all our motto in the canteen is a fair deal
and no favour."
"And that's all right, Brick, my lad!" lie
said to himself, as tiie men broke into a
feeble cheer, "There's only 400 tins in the
whole show."
On the hospital deck the Chinese car-
penter and the bosun were assisting a
dapper little surgeon, with the iron grey
hair of true genius, to pick the teeth of a
furious young gale caught whistling in the
rigging the night before. The Maltese
cook, armed with a large tuning fork, was
assisting the Medico to take down the
notes on the ohordagc, because lie knew
the run of the ropes. At intervals the
fork came in useful for inoculating A
company of Morton's pickles —large round
chaps—well preserved. When all was fin-
ished the cook shouted "Come to the cook-
house door, boys, and get a hot potato
pick-me-up."
Still further aft an officer in a white
puggaree was lecturing his men on "Shore
Tactics." His melodious tones ascended.
"Our arms are their protection; and their
arms are our reward. Small arms; mark
ME; soft, soft, round; hold no terrors if you
come to close quarters at once. An en-
veloping movement, culminating in com-
plete surround and final surrender, is one
of the supreme joys of the trained sol-
dier, and may even be pressed to the en
tire satisfaction of the prisoner. 1 speak
from experience. Out of 502 eases "
Right on the stern, another officer, wear-
ing an engineer's badge and an air of sad-
ness, was ceaselessly counting 2." men and
trying to convert them into 26, while a
bugler wailed the Coronach: "Where arc
my wandering boys to-night?"
All doubts were set at rest; the Aparima
lay below.
The Arabian night was falling fast as
the Ge'nie picked up Aladdin's flagship.
Coming up on a bow-line, lie soon over-
hauled and rounded-in with a figure of 8
and a fisherman's bend, and seizing the
after davits he lowered his two guys with-
out a hitch.
"So you got them both," said his mas-
ter. "Away to your dinner. You may
now draw separation allowances for all
your wives and child Er. No! let me see!
Get out of this!" lie finished hastily,
after some rapid calculation.
"Oapt. Cade, you are not required.
More New Zealanders reach Perth to-mor-
row. Imshi!"
"But where can I go to?" said the' poor
Captain, with a tear in his mild blue eye.
Aladdin hold him. explicitly, then feel-
ing better he turned to the other accused
"Now, sir, you are Oapt. McDonald?"
"Umphm." "We haco complaints about
your furious driving?" "Oh, a.ve. '
"What have you to say about it?"
"Umphm." "Well, what speed are you
on, then?"
"Aboot twa knots, I reckon," said the
seaman, proudly, "but at siccan a pace
we canna toll to a yairrd. Tarn Roger-
son's knockin' hell oot- of her, though."
he added reminiscently.
"Two knots ! There must be some
error. Neptune told me you were heat-
ing the chronometer every day."

no hae ony o' they Indian bodies furnish-
in' information aboot his sheep! I'll

"Yes, yes," said Aladdin, wearily.
"Slave."
"Sire," replied the Genie, entering with
a mouth full of Mother Carey's chicken.
"Take him away. I've come to the con-
clusion that the speed reports have been
grossly exaggerated."
"All tell ye, mon! ma sheep "

face and swetring in broad Gaelic.)

hide and seek with the enemy in the Ah
Go Hon region for the last few days. They
have not been very successful in their seek-
ing, however, as the Germans fled before
the onslaught of the warriors of Gaul,
leaving a series of empty trenches behind
them.
Von Hindenberg, the mysterious com-
mander, has proved to be so well up in the
art of mystery, that it is now impossible
to find him, but a raid is shortly to be
made in a certain place, where ye canine
friends do hungrily lurk about.
Many brilliant artillery jewels have been
seen. A huge ring has been formed round
the enemy, who, it is thought, will broach
for peace.
The Turks have again been playing fowl.
Sniping has been prevalent, but as the
Allies are well up in the art of ducking,
there have been few casualties. The Turk
has been having another pick at that quiet
old bird, Suez, but Suez, with all her little
Suezettes, is quite able to defend herself,
and lias just about clipped the Turk's
wings.
The Sultana is very anxious regarding
the welfare of her husband, but the Turks
refuse to recognise such small fruit. News
is also currant that the Sultana has been
very seedy of late.
There are disquieting rumours that the
Crown Prince is to be placed in charge of
an army not the German army.
Dame Rumour also has it that, the
Kaiser lias taken off his upper lip. This,
it is stated, is but the first instalment to-
wards tire removal of that worthy gentle-
man's head.
No mention is made of the New Zea-
landers. Doubtless they are anxiously
awaiting tiie arrival of the Sixteenth.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Literary Genius. —No, Nat Gould was not
the author of "Paradise Lost." Eveyone
with any education knows that Charles
Garbage wrote this wonderful work. Ave
you an officer that you do not know those
things?
Inquisitive.—You had better ask Lieut.
O'Leary yourself whether or not he is a
Frenchman.
Soldire. —Anything pertaining to military
matters, such as you require, may be had
in Pear's Cyclopaedea.
Pug. —Some say that it was in the year
1918 that Peter Noon beat Les Darcy.
Another Literary Genius. —No, the editor
of this publication was not at one time
editor of the "Bulletin." What has the
editor done to you that he should bear
these insults?
Nautical Man. —The speed of the Aparima
is 21J knots, but she has been known at
times to do ten.
Sergeant.—That is 'a very common mis-
take. Boots should not be cleaned on
parade. Boots should be cleaned before
parade.
Admirer. —Yes, we quite agree with you.
The Sixteenths do take a lot of beating.
Toteetler. —We cannot say for certain,
but we believe it is twopence per pint.
A.B. —That remains to be seen.
Mere Man. —If we did publish your eu-
logistic remarks the nurses would not be-
lieve them. They are used to that kind of
thing.
Excelsior.—W.P.l!.
Billy Bee. —If you are the craek shot of
your company, why brag about it? Try
and be the crack shot in the trenches.
Theatrical. —We cannot say for certain,
but we believe it was with Sir Beerbohm
Tree that Pte. Alaneo Knot last appeared.
Enquirer.—A platoon is a body of men
entirely surrounded by officers.


WHO'S WHO?
THUMB-NAIL SKETCHES OF FAMOUS
MEN.
"Every soldier has a perfect right to a
"full knowledge of the personal and private
"affairs of every commissioned officer, and
"every opportunity must be taken of af-
"fording this information."
EXTRACT FROM ARMY ACT, 1916.
Fr-s-r, Lieut. E. 16.—Born in Timaru, and
lately in legal practice in Cambridge, where
he held a commission in the 16th Waikato
Regiment. From the old Maori words wai,
"salt," and kato, "of the earth," from
which by a single association of ideas (the
corps are renowned for their "ideas"), we
have "salt of the earth." A fortunate acci-
dent in early childhood decided his line in
life. By some chance he swallowed a sover-
eign, and after much prayer and fasting
and several surgical operations all they
could recover was 13s. 4d. Forthwith de-
cided to make a" lawyer of him. The wisdom
of that early decision has been amply de-
monstrated during the present awful crisis.
To him, versed in the subtleties of the
Scribes and Pharisees, his duties as ship's
adjutant are a sinecure—hardly appear to
exist in fact. Then his "routine orders."
"Always on the safe side," as he says, with
his official wink, "they might mean any-
thing." However, they very seldom do, so
no material harm lias been done. Has been
given much credit for his heroic decision to
devote his extra pay to the sports fund.
Loves joy rides, especially round greasy
corners. Is a most determined censor, anil
his efforts with the Postal authorities in
Perth and Fremantle have rendered it fairly
certain that no more than 50,000 unauthor-
ised packets and letters leaked through to
N.Z.
M-ncr-f, 2nd Lieut. A. 16.—Comes from
Christchurch originally. Has been to the
front once already and knows the smell of
a dead Turk as well as anyone. Of course,
owing to his previous opportunities, knows
all about everything in the military line;
though you would never have guessed it from
his behaviour. That is why we tell you.
We think you might like to know. When it
was decided to appoint half the ship's com-
pany to watch the other half in the capa-
city of military policemen, there immedi-
ately arose the necessity for finding a man
sufficiently versed in ways that are dark
and in tricks that are vain to assume com-
mand of the guardians of law and order.
The choice fell quite naturally on our hero.
We don't mean what you think we do, at
all. The "old soldier" is usually a man of
many vices, tempered by a few redeeming
virtues, but a handy chap withal, and a
mighty refuge in the day of trouble.
"Monty" as General Birdwood affection-
ately called him, is all this, though he may
not tell you so. Has a neat little "quiff"
in the matter of parting his hair, and a pair
of yellow deck shoes that were given to him
by Abdul the Damned —under pressure.
You may expect great things from this little
man; it won't do any harm. A prominent
supporter of the "Order of the Safety
Match." 8,1
SPECIALIST FROM AUCKLAND.
Th-m-s, 16th Specialists.—An -architect
by profession, who went to the fair
with the original British Section. Was
only a few days on Gallipoli when
the Turks put their permanent trade
mark on him. Some of these returned men
have a very unpleasant habit of refusing
to let their less fortunate brethren share in
their experiences per medium of the spoken
word. No pettiness of this description about
Th-m-s. No, sir ! He overflows with the
fecund verbosity of a half-penny newspaper,
to quote his crony Dalgleish. He will tell
you all he knows about every mortal thing
since war was first thought of, and will
often illustrate the greater happenings in a
most interesting manner by references to
himself and other great celebrities. May
even tell you a fair amount that he doesn't
know, in his efforts to please, and, of course,
does not confine his remarks to purely mili-
tary affairs. By Jove ! No. Drawl that
"by" a little more and you've got it just
right. Thank you. Is at your disposal
day or night as the fancy seizes him. The
only flaw in his performance is a tendency
to pitch his yarn in such a low key that you
can scarcely hear him if you happen to be
wearing cotton wool in your ears, thus lead-
ing to many noisy interjections of "Speak
up" from some of the less polished among
his victims. Is very keen on "his boys,"
and works hard to raise them to a state of
efficiency in keeping with their unique hon-
our and opportunity.
N-wt-n, 2nd Lieut., E 16. First saw the
light in Seven Dials or thereabouts, and if
his general characteristics have not altered
greatly since then, must have begun to make
a noise immediately. A bouncing, breezy
Cockney, and proud of it. Of course, there
is no reason why he should not be. We
might be ourselves if we had nothing else.
Appearances do not bear out this theory of
his origin however. He has the dark-eyed
southern beauty of a Mexican bandit, and
with the addition of a palmetto sombrero
and a pair of ticklers would pass for
Sancho Pancho anywhere. Is a noted physi-
cal culture expert, and much in demand at
all the small social events of the quarter-
deck. Extraordinarily fond of high-class
music. Will hang for hours over a gramo-
phone listening to Sir Henry Lauder's artis-
tic productions with a seraphic smile of pure
content, quite heedless of rowdy people all
round who insist on reading and writing
during the performance. Assists the glee
party to tip a tuneful stave on Wednesday
evenings, with much satisfaction to all con-
cerned. Next please !
K-ng, Capt., A 16, comes from the South,
and was a good all-round sport in his
younger days. Getting on now, of course,
but still game, and may be seen gambolling
and frisking round the deck any fine morn-
ing like unto the young goat of the
psalmist.
Was a preceptor and instructor of youth
in Auckland when he decided to forsak!
the pen for the sword. Whilst at that
uplifting labour he attained to much rank
and honour in the military world, and ac-
quired a "way with children" which still
creeps out on occasion.
Is reported to have been very nearly the
athor of those stirring lines:
"None but the brave deserve the fair,"
and to hold tenaciously to the theory that
this does not include naval gentlemen or
anyone remotely connected with the per-
sonnel of a transport.
Recently addressed some severe criti-
cisms to the British Admiralty on the
subject of "Ships officers and their duties,"
taking as his text that beautiful thought
of the apostle Blair:
"Satan finds some mischief still,
For idle hands to do."
We all have our little irailties (some
worse than others, of course), hut apart
from these idiosyncrasies, the gallant cap-
tain may be relied on to do his bit when
the time comes. Till then we fear ,
but why worry, 'since we're not respon-
sible?
H-nt-r, F 16., formerly of Whangarei,
where he earned his daily crust in adorn-
ing the onerous position of draughts clerk
—"opening and shutting windows" as we
may explain for the benefit of the iinin-'
it.iated.
Believes firmly in the old military adage
"Once aboard a troopship an officer be-
comes a tourist pure and simple," and
carries this theory into practice as far as
is compatible with the interference of
senior officers who hold more modern
views on the subject of platoon control.
Has turned quietly and naturally from the
pomp and circumstance of military hustle
and preparation to the gentler arts of
peace, and may be seen any fine morning
on the bridge deck placidly learning how
to knit. Can now cast on and off with
case, and hopes to master the details of
purl and plain before reaching colder
climates.
Is strongly convinced that every soldier
should be taught to sew and crochet in
preparation for the dark days following
tlie war, when the conflict will be none the
less stern because the scene is shifted to
the fields of trade and commerce.
Offered to supply a lot more of this flap-
doodle, but we had to be firm in the in-
terests of subscribers. Pass!
Mr. 81....r, Y.M.C.A.
Not exactly a soldier in the purely mili-
tary sense, but a member of a mighty
army none the less, and a worthy man
whatefer. Of all the tremendous organisa-
tions now at work for the general well-
being of the soldier, the Y'.M.C.A. is con-
sidered by many competent judges to do
the best all-round work. And, looking on
our own representatives and his labours, we
are prepared to believe it. Reared, of
course, in Dunedin, and retains some at
least of the kindly burr of the auld Scot-
tish tongue so indispensable to all good
pillars of the temple.
In his cups has been known to flicker
his left eyelid in a thoroughly non-sec-
tarian manner, and to brag rather openly
that he was not ever thus. We doubt it
not. Neither would anyone else who had
heard him sing "I'm fu' the noo," or hart
watched his bald spot growing pink with
emotion while our local Harry Lauder re-
tailed the saucy tickling adventures of the
amorous Jock.
"Ilech! mon, yon's guid" he was heard
to breathe softly with deep feeling in every
note, wiping his eyes with his famous col


oured handkerchief depicting the cruises
of the 12 Apostles.
Breached one very uplifting and fear-
reaching sermon in the early days of the
trip, taking as his text that comforting
promise: "Cast your bread upon the waters
and after many days, etc., etc."
Usually characterised by a becoming
modesty of demeanour all too rare on a
troopship, but a fearsome laddie when he's
"takin the Buik."
May we meet many more of his like
along the stony wayside.
o'L....ry, 2nd Lieut., F. Company, 16th.
Temporarily in command of his com-
pany, but a very worthy officer notwith-
standing. Possesses in a marked degree
the faculty of keeping his mouth shut, so
characteristic of all the greater military
leaders of the British nation. As he says
himself with the inimitable wit of the true
Irishman: "If you can think of absolutely
nothing to say, bedad thin tis as well not
to say it at all, at all."
Is stated by those who ought to know
to possess a bearing and temperament
peculiarly akin to that of the late Lord
Roberts, who also hailed from "little
green isle" as all good sons of Erin are
proud to remember. In this connection wa
may say that our subject is a lineal de-
scendant of the good old Irish house of
Brian Boru, who was a king in Ireland
hundreds of years before St. Patrick first
landed.
Rather pale lately—puts it down to too
much thinking. "Sicklied o'er with the
pale cast of thought" is a phrase he com-
posed himself during a recent spell of
night duty. We are pleased to adopt it,
having previously been somewhat stuck
for something appropriate, and yet inof-
fensive.
Has a great aversion to all quacks and
pretenders, especially such as relate to the
restoration of the human hair
Gifted with plenty of worldly wisdom,
and an interest in his job, will play a gal-
lant part in the stern days ahead.
Special. —You should see him, about
three hoops up, with his green jacket ani
blackthorn shillelagh, knocking out "the
Irish washerwoman." Nothing finer on
the ship.
-yd-n, 2nd Lieut., E 16, formerly a well-
known Wellington commercial. A genial
little soul with a tremendous penchant for
an old brown balaclava and a well-worn
briar. Also addicted to the use of
"shorts," which set off his smooth swelling
calves and finely chiselled ankles to per-
fection. Rumour has it that he (whisper)
shaves and anoints his nice legs. Obvi-
ously not Colonial born. Is reputed to be
otherwise a fairly reliable officer. Appears
to be the secretary of a secret society
among "certain of the junior officers" (to
quote the words of the Very Great In-
deed) called the "Order of the Goat."
And a highly appropriate title, too, if
we may suggest such a thing, though how
the secretary got mixed up with it we can-
not conceive. We fear that he is an in-
nocent little dove in the hands of certain
of those unscrupulous hawks known to
science (and the V.G.1.) as the "junior
officers." A tendency to rush in upon his
fate is not the least of his characteristics.
Since writing the above we have made
further inquiries and find that the O.C. of
this dangerous concern is a tall handsome
man who knocks about with K..rk..r.
Their activities have given rise to an-
other Band of Hope called the "Order of
the Safety Match," about which no parti-
culars are available save that it exists
for the uplifting and strengthening of the
moral characters of its members.
H-y, 2nd Lieut., A Company, comes
from Invercargill, where Dalgety and Co.
were the fortunate proprietors of his pay-
sheet. Used to be, of course, a rabid tee
totaller —long ago in Invercargill. Dear,
dear! llow time flies. The secret of his
astonishing success in business, and of his
marvellous organising ability and general
all-round efficiency as an N.C.O. in Tren-
tham has long been a puzzle to all who
have heard him tell the story of his bril-
liant career—and who has not? Endowed
by nature with singular beauty and an
extraordinarily imposing presence, topped
by a crown of ruddy glory as rosy as the
morn, he has had' to struggle with a re-
tiring modesty of disposition as beautiful
as it is rare. Delicately encouraged and
coaxed out of his shell by gentle kindness
he can go some; but is a shy bird. When
he does start —don't let's speak of it. At
the present time his career is swayed by
two main opposing forces. One is Daniel,
6.30 a.m.; the other is Char Coal, the chef,
who has control during the rest of the
day. The quid nuncs still regard the
final issue as doubtful.
Hobbies—the canteen, and amateur
photography. Is also intensely interested
in the subject of mutton-birds preserva-
tion, which lie regards as the coming in-
dustry of the South.
Did he get a good hearing in Perth? Ask
him! He'll probably tell you before long
in any case.
Br-st-1 and R-sm-ss-n, 2nd Lieutenants,
"Specialists" 16.
The sight of these eallow innocents cast
out to grapple with the cold hard world
so early in life armed with nought but
youth and t'other thing, irresistibly reminds
the thoughtful observer of the Babes in the
Wood—"Old Ras" as his mentor calls him,
so perhaps we also may be permitted the
liberty, seems slightly the younger. He
has not yet reached the age when fanci-
ful attire appears to he the end and object
of life. When lie does-, if he has profited
by his association, we may expect him in
a red sash stuck full of daggers and pis-
tols, with a red nightcap on his fair curls.
Great disciplinarians though! 24 Terri-
torial camps don't count for nothing when
it comes to real business. Just you wear
a pair of light boots, or the wrong badge,
for five minutes and see if you don't go
where the dogs won't bite you. Whew!
Kept their end well up in Perth. Bright,
interesting chaps all round.
W-rsl-y, 2nd Lieut., A 16, hails from
Auckland, where he adorned the lower
rungs of the long ladder of legal eminence
and held a commission in some Veteran's
Corp. We don't condemn him for that—•
not only that, anyway.
A wild blade, and looks the part. A
true history of his various exploits in the
fields of romance would fill a family Bible.
though sadly out of keeping with the rari-
fied moral atmosphere of the dear old
Book. Opinions are divided as to whether
his success lies most in the compelling flash
of his bright green eyes or in the irresisl
ible dash and elan of his ferocious mous-
taehios. The ladies of New Zealand were
divided on the point; their sisters of Fre-
mantle and Perth are still too flustered to
be capable of a calm judgment—so who
are we that we should attempt a decision.
Let it go down to posterity with the other
great problems of our degenerate age
Softening his wilder Bohemian character-
istics is a wonderful capacity for melody.
Is honorary accompanist to the assembled
talent of the ship on Wednesday evenings,
and to see him sitting there so calm and
serene with the rapt expression of an
early Christian is another experience in
the extreme phases of our many-sided
human nature. Alas, alack! so young, so
fair.
"Tiie Rest of 'Em." Noted military ex-
perts and strategists of every degree. Wa
regret that space and time preclude any
attempt to deal faithfully with all the
talent in the saloon. We know that there
are several others with claims to notoriety,
and we know that you would be deeply in-
terested in their histories, hut some are
too bashful, and others are too bold for
our purpose. Some , did not think their
claims to publicity were- sufficient to jus-
tify the high fees we have demanded from
each of these characters in our gallery,
and others brought along a wealth of per-
sonal details and heroic achievement suf
ficient to make a small book; they all did,
of course, but those chosen agreed t <
leave the matter in our hands. One man
whom we will call 11-rv-y,. for instance,
for purposes of disguise, brought us 51
photographs of noted beauties who ha I
fallen to his wiles, with description notes
of each campaign. Now we put it to you,
gentle reader, was it possible? Echo an-
swers No! We wish it had been; some of
bis tales were tres bon.
Two medical gentlemen, who shall also
be nameless, came separately at different
times and offered to defray expenses of
printing an original brochure 011 the "Nut-
ritwe value of Adam's apple," but unfor-
tunately we had a copy already, and knew
the author well. Sounds bad, we admit.
Then there were Enn..s and K..rk..r.
Broil chaps; you'd love to meet them, but
we can't give it away. They had a great
notion. The rough gist of it was that on
0 certain day every British battery should
be ready—well supplied with ammunition,
and should draw a curtain of fire beyond
the German trenches for three days at
least, so that the occupants would be well
starved. Then they would suddenly cease
and certain ventriloquists previously
trained would throw a noise like the cry
of a fat German sausage midway between
the opposing lines. This would be too
much for the Germans, and when they were
all out of cover they could be picked off
by the rifles and artillery at leisure. It
sounds crude, but they had it worked out
down to a minute of are. Fine, big, con-
fident fellows they are, with cigars and
an "air" about them.
But why go on.


A SMALL STUDY IN BLACK AND
WHITE.
Evening roll call on the good ship Apa
rirna. Spasmodic showers on the wet decks
the western wind humming shrill in th<
rigging and overside the white crests leap-
ing at the ship, and roaring away into the
darkness with a vicious hiss. Oh, for a

This is the good red wine of real life to
Pte. Smith, and carried away by the exal-
tation of this unusual popularity, he throws
cold caution to the winds, and settles down
happily to make a real job of his oppor-
tunity. In ten minutes a startled ship
knows the awful facts. How a German
consul, clad in a skull cap and loin cloth,
has armed the American Indians in the
bowels of the ship, and after scalping Chips,
and heaving the lead at the Bosun, has led
a dashing assault on the fresh water tanks,
where the Padre has brained seven, and
drowned six, and was on the point of throt-
tling the Austrian Emperor with his bare
hands when the latter broke loose, and
seizing a luckless Maori boy in his teeth,
sprang into tile sea, and disappeared. And
Pte. Smith reckons, though of course he
can't be sure, that he was promptly picked
up by the German submarine U Dontsuyso,
and hints darkly that their raft drill
weren't none too soon, nohow."
Meantime, the Adjutant, the O.C. Troops,
the O.C. Ship, the O.C. Reinforcements, and
several other inquisitive and superfluous
dignitaries, who make a point of investi-
gating private 'affairs that do not concern
them, had the O.C. Maori Details "on the
mat," and gave him one hour to produce
Rangi, or another live Maori boy, of the
same beam, draught, and carrying capacity,
and sent him forth, accompanied by the
Chief Steward armed with a piece of dried
shark.
Just as they came abaft the vegetable
patch, they were unexepectedly assisted
by the melodious tones of the cook's mate,
drawing onion rations for next day's use.
"Nar then, Otheller! Show a leg, and get
ter 'ell art o' this. Can't sleep on them
onions all night."
Rangi deposed that he had descended with
the first sitting "by mistake," and had im-
mediately struck up hostilities with a
lonely sea-pie. Not caring to turn his
back on the foe, he had decided to remain
and chance the consequences. In a short
tune the pie gave up the unequal contest,
and disappeared; leaving Rangi free to flirt
with some cold beef and pickles. By this
time his own unit had come to their meal,
and Rangi decided to rectify his former
error aa far as might he by dining again
with them. Once more he had ploughed his
way through the menu, and emerged
flushed, hut triumphant. Slightly fatigued
by these exertions he had sat down to
meditate among the onions, and, soothed
by the delicate perfume of the fruit, he
had fallen asleep.
The O.C. Maori Details reserved his prin-
cipal remarks for the morning.
The Chief Steward's address was pointed
and powerful, and ended with a Benedic-
tion that consigned Rangi and all his house
to a climate several degrees warmer than
the Australian Bight. In his excitement
he laid down the piece of shark, and ulti-
mately forgot all about it.
Rangi remembered it though, and, being
a tidy boy, he took it to bed with him.
"Me aha," said he, as he donned his
cream pyjamas and turned down the
snowy coverlet:
Ka Kite puku, Ka hari te ngakau."

THE EVIL EYE: A TALE OF OUR
TIME.
Pat Mulgan wiz an Irishman, that lived
in Trimaloo,
And he cud sing an' drink and fight, hut
work he wudn't do;
And while his mother toiled and slaved, to
kape things spick an' span,
He only loafed and drank and swore like
any Irishman.
At length the poor old mother died, and
then there wiz a wake,
Pat got as drunk as any lord, for his old
mother s sake,
But when lie got too frisky, and the chil-
dren 'gan to weep,
The priest got a shilelagh, and he put pore
Pat to sleep.
When Pat woke up next morning, he wiz
lying on the floor,
The peat fire had burned out, and in pieces
wiz the door;
An' there wiz nought to eat or drink, ail'
he wiz very dry,
"Bad luck," sez lie, "'tis someone put on
me the evil eye."
Things went from had to worse, and Pit
got all he did deserve,
The pigs got lost, the cabin wrecked, an
lie wiz like to starve;
There wiz 110 money now to stale from bis
old mother's purse.
"Bad cess," says he, "I'm thinking 'ere 'tis
better 'twill be worse."
One day there came a cullceu wid great
melting eyes of blue,
And tenderly at Paddy luked, as colleens
often do.
But wlien she tried to comfort him, poor
Paddy turned to fiy.
"Oh, Mushala," he yelled, "'tis she that's
got the evil eye."
Pat ran like any divvil, an' ne'er rested at
his ease,
Till in wonder of a ship he crossed the
stormy seas;
But Pat found that old Ireland was itself
a great reward;
In furrin lands he had to work, and grafted
very hard.
One day lie wiz loading near the sea,
stripped to the pelt,
An' he had to -stir a boiler full of bubblin'
hot asphalt;
An 'often he looked ower the sea, an' often
he wud sigh
For the land of pigs, an' bogs, an' peat, and
of the evil eye.
One day there came a country wench, and
watched him thru the murk,
As lie amid the steam an' smoke wiz
graftin' a.t his work;
Tiil Paddy caught her lukin' at him, an'
wid a divvilish cry,
Roared "Whirriroo, an' my baloo, she's got
the evil eye."
He splashed the stuff around liiiu, an' it
fell into the fire;
Up lept the flames, up boiled the stuff, an'
Pat fell in the mire.
"The saints presarve us all," he yelled, and
in bis agony
He jumped up an' ran blazin' till lie fell
into the sea.
They dragged Pat out wit' pot hooks, an'
lie wiz a sorry sight,
His head the wench got on her lap, to help
an' aise his plight;
An' when at length he wiz brot to, she
heaved a gentle sigh,
"Oh, whirra, whirra," Paddy cried, "luk,
luk at her eye."
Pat sailed again across the sea, he went
to join the war;
He feared no man that stud on legs, he
cud show many a gear,
An' wit him Micky Doolan cum to see his
comrade thru,
For this same Mick had partnered Pat in
old-time Trimaloo.
Then Pat, he took a sickness, as the big
ship rolled an' rolled,
An' to put him in the sick bay, he wiz brot
out ov the hold;
An' when the doctor saw him, he said, wid
solemn air:
"That lad's got amoritis; he'll need a lot
of care."
Now, the nurse wiz a dear critter, with a
purty pair of eyes,
And the lashes hung like fringes, ower a
thousand wit cileries;
An' oft she hiked at Paddy, wid her eyes
deep as the sea,
An' Paddy jist looked back at her, for very
sick wiz he.
Now, Micky he wiz standin' by, and saw
the eyelids drop,
Half hiding a dear twinkle, an' lie gave
a mighty whoop.
"Begorra, Pat, ye spalpeen, div.il a sick-
ness have ye got,"
Her twinklin' eyes are witehiu' ye, an' she'll
tie ye in a knot.
"Och, whirriroo," sez Paddy, "can't you sec
I'm very sick,
An' this tiyiu' to make me better, and to
save me from old Nick,
An' sick or well, or gude or ill, I'd stop
here tiil I die,
Just to catch the same dear twinkle that
lights up her purty eye."
WALTER MUNRO.
