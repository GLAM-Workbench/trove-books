The Sun had Set o’er Juda’s Land.”
•a*--
The sun had set o’er Juda’s Land,
Night shadows softly fell ;
The stars shone not so brightly,- and
Some sadness seemed to tell.
Throughout bright Heaven’s glorious host
No joyous sound was made,
As He Who died to save the lost
In sorrow, anguish, prayed.
Father, if it is Thy will,
Remove this cup from me.
As Thou would’st, it shall be still ;
Thy will be done for Thee.
A little time, and then arose
The rabble’s awful cry—
Away with Him !” it louder grows,
“ To death, Him crucify !”
They led Him on to Calvary’s hill.
He died, ’midst suffering pain,
All for our sakes, through God’s own will,
And lived, and rose again.
“Why hast Thou forsaken Me ?”
With drooping head He cried ;
“ It is finished,” on the tree
Where Christ was crucified.
Now He is risen, joy resounds,
And Heaven’s legions sing,
Throughout those all eternal bounds,
To welcome back their King.
And now He sits at God’s right hand,
In triumph over death,
Amidst the bright and glorious band
Above, around, beneath.
Now He lives for evermore —
The everlasting King ;
Him we worship and adore,
And to Him praises sing.
