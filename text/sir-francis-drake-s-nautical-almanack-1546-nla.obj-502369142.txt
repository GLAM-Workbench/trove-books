FOREWORD
When I sailed round the World, out of sight
of land for weeks, sometimes months, I was
often pleasantly surprised when making
landfall “spot on” despite variable winds,
gales, calms and ocean currents. I did,
though, have the latest available charts to
enable me to identify my landfalls, together
with the complete Astro Navigational Tables
to help me to fix my position on the chart.
This is more than Francis Drake had
when he circumnavigated the Globe, and I
have never ceased to admire the skill of those
sailors of old, who navigated their rather
unweatherly ships to the far corners of the
earth, some 400 odd years ago.
This little book, which is a reproduction
of the one carried by Francis Drake, gives a
graphic description of the methods used by
him, and in an age when the majority were
illiterate, shows what a keen brain he had,
to have been able to apply the then little-
known science of navigation.
This is a book to read and study and to
treasure on one’s bookshelf for posterity.

This pocket almanac was published in or
before 1546 to give Breton seamen
information they needed for their daily
lives - principally the dates of Church
festivals and fasts, and the times of the
tides. Part printed from wood blocks on
vellum, part hand-written with the
symbols enriched by applied colour, it
was devised and produced in the little
port of le Conquet, near today’s naval
base of Brest, by Guillaume Brouscon,
whose signature can be seen, letter by
letter, in the centre of the tidal dials on
pages 1 to 8. He took all possible steps
to make it convenient for the pocket,
abbreviating extensively and using
symbols and differing colours which made
it intelligible to those who could not
read French or Breton. Only three other
printed copies are known to have survived
and there are also manuscript versions,
all slightly different.
On the flyleaf is a signature F. Drak
and there seems no reasonable doubt
that this copy was once the property of
4
the circumnavigator, Francis Drake
(1540-96). It was just the sort of book
which would have been useful to him in
his early seamanship and water stains
and scuffing give it the appearance of
having been taken to sea at some time.
This copy was later acquired by
Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) who
catalogued it as ‘Sir Francis Drake’s
Original Pocket-Tables & Charts; printed
& MSS, vellum’. Pepys bequeathed the
whole of his library to his old college
Magdalene College, Cambridge where
the almanac still remains. As the books
in the collection are arranged strictly
according to height, Brouscon’s almanac,
the smallest book in the library, is No. 1.
THE WRITING
Generally speaking, roman numerals are
used, though this is not evident at first
sight because of the form of the tens and
fives, thus-
+ 15, +l+= 19 and+t*= 27;
O = zero, noon or midnight. Each
5
quarter hour is indicated by a stroke
(generally in red) at right angles to the
main figure, thus: U“= 7.15, +*l = =
11.30,5 = 12.45.
In reading the writing, care should be
taken to read as r, not as z: the long
f is used for s in the middle of a word:
is a z not a 3: internally, a v is
written as u in lower case while in upper
case a U is written as V: upper case J
is generally written as I. A bar across the
top of a letter indicates that the next
letter (generally an n or an m) is
omitted: a colon generally indicates
the word has been shortened. The
following examples illustrate these
points:
ROVA Rouan (Rouen):
\od*es = londres (London):
= porsemu (Portsmouth)
6
GOLDEN NUMBERS AND DOMINICAL
LETTERS
Both the tides and the date of Easter are
governed by the New Moon, while for
the latter the day of the week has to be
taken into account. To find these dates,
almanacs used two quantities: (a) the
Golden Number or Prime , from I to XIX
in successive years, marking the year’s
position in the ‘Metonic’ cycle of 19
years after which the phases of the Moon
recur on the same days of each month
(though not, as we shall see, at precisely
the same hour); this was used to find the
dates of New Moon each month; (b) the
Dominical letter or Sunday letter from a
to g: if 1 January falls on a Sunday, the
Dominical is a, if it falls on a Monday, it
is b, on a Tuesday c, and so on: for leap
years, there are two Dominicals, one
before and one after 29 February: in
successive years the letters fall in reverse
order, thus . . . b, a, g/f, e, d, c, b/a, g
and so on.
7
Table 111 gives the Golden Numbers
and Dominical Letters for 1546-73 and
1980-99. In Brouscon’s day, the
quantities for the current year were
posted in churches and offices at ports
where mariners congregated. For them,
the information on the age of the Moon
and the state of the tide was essential.
The Julian calendar was in use in
Brouscon’s day, while the date of Easter
(on which most of the Church’s movable
feasts depended) was based upon the
Metonic Cycle and assumed the spring
equinox occurred on 21 March. However,
the Julian year and the Metonic Cycle
were based on approximations which
meant that by Brouscon’s time, the errors
had accumulated so that the actual
equinox occurred on 11 March (though
Easter was still based on 21 March)
while the phases of the real Moon (which
caused the tides) were four days ahead
of the ‘ecclesiastical’ Moon (on which
the dates of Easter depended). These
difficulties were only resolved when the
8
Gregorian calendar was introduced in
1582 (though it was not adopted in
Britain until 1752). By dropping ten
days, the calendar was made once more
to agree with the heavens and steps were
taken to ensure that the errors did not
accumulate again.
METHOD OF USE
(A) Dates of New Moon
The tables of immovable feasts on pp,
17-22 include in the two left-hand
columns of each month a perpetual lunar
calendar giving the dates of New Moon
each month according to the Golden
Number of the year. The right-hand
column in red refers to the ‘ecclesiastical’
New Moon (for Church festivals), the
left-hand, in black, the ‘real’ Moon (for
tidal problems), the latter being always
four days ahead of the former, the
situation as it was in the sixteenth
century, (To make this work for the
twentieth century, the black numbers
have to be advanced a further two days
and the Gregorian date has to be reduced
to the Julian date by subtracting 13 days.)
Example What were the dates of the
‘real’ and ‘ecclesiastical’ New Moons in
July 1563?
1. From Table 111, the Golden Number
for 1563 was VI.
2. On p. 20, July, the black Golden
Number VI is against the Dominical e,
equivalent to 20 July: the red VI is
against b, equivalent to 24 July.
(B) The Tides
To find the times of High and Low Water
at any particular port on any particular
day, the mariner needed two pieces of
information;
(i) The ‘establishment of the port 9 ,
defined today as the time of high water
at that port on the days of Full and New
Moon (Full and Change), in Brouscon’s
day this was generally expressed not as a
time but as the compass bearing of the
Sun (and also of the Moon on the days
of Full and Change) at that time,
10
assuming it bears E at 6 am, SE at 9 am,
S at noon, SW at 3 pm, and W at 6 pm.
The charts on pp. 10-13 give these
establishments, lines from each port
leading to the appropriate compass
point on the small wind-roses (which
are not, incidentally, correctly oriented
geographically).
(ii) The age of the Moon. The Moon
crosses the meridian (souths) about 48
minutes later each day, so adding 48
minutes to the establishment of the port
for each day of the Moon’s age gives the
time of high water on that particular
day: shifting the Sun and Moon , as that
operation was called, was made easy in
the eight tidal dials on pp. 1-8, one for
each point of the compass from SE to
WNW (titled in French at the top, in
Breton at the bottom), which also
indicated by the symbols the days of
spring and neap tides.
Example What were the times of high
and low water on 23 January 1562?
u
1. Age of the Moon. Following the
procedure in (A) above, the January
New Moon in 1562 was e = 5 January.
Therefore the age of the Moon on 23
January was 18 days.
2. St Malo tidal establishment. From
chart on p.ll, the line from s mallo leads
to the compass point WEST.
3. Times of high and low water. On the
tidal dial WEST on p. 7, for the age of
the Moon of 18 days:
outer circle - age of the Moon - 18 days
2nd circle - springs and neaps - the day
after springs
3rd circle - time of high water - 9.00
4th circle - time of low water - 3.00
(C) Dates of Immovable Feasts on
Saints 7 and Holy Days
These are given month by month on pp
17-32 where the days of the month are
indicated by Dominical letters starting
with a on 1 January. Red Letter Days
are indicated by the line joining the
symbol to the date being in red. These
are all tabluated in Table 11.
12
Example What was the date and day
of the week of the Feast of the
Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary
in 1560?
1. The date. On p. 17 for February, the
head of the Virgin has a red line leading
to e, corresponding to 2 February. The
previous day has a fish symbol so was a
fast.
2. The day. From Table HI, the Dominical
Letter for 1560, a leap year, is g/f- Our
date is before 29 February so Sundays
are represented by g. The 2 February
1560 was therefore a Friday.
(D) Hours of daylight and darknes*
each month in Brittany
These are shown in the small circles at
the head of each month on pp. 17-32,
the red figure indicating hours of daylight,
the black strokes hours of darkness. For
example, in February, there are 10 hours
of daylight and 14 hours of darkness.
1 3
(E) Dates of Movable Feasts , 1546-73
(i) Those depending upon the date of
Easter. These are given on pp. 14 and
15 where the vertical columns refer to
the year indicated by Dominical letters
in the right-hand column. Horizontal
lines give the dates of the various festivals
with month symbols as in Table I.
Example What are the dates of festivals
for 1550?
1. From Table I, the Dominical for 1550
ise.
2. The column relating to 1550 is
therefore the fifth column from the
left on p. 14.
3. The dates for 1550 are therefore as
follows:
SEPTUAGESIMA SUNDAY 2 Feb
laceptu - a circle
SHROVE TUESDAY 18 Feb
(MARDI GRAS)
MARDI - a spit
EASTER SUNDAY 6 Apr
PASCA - lamb and flag
14
LOW SUNDAY 13 Apr
(QUASIMODO)
casimo - a vat
ROGATION MONDAY 12 May
rogati - a banner
(and circle in ink)
ASCENSION DAY 15 May
(Thursday)
acensio - feet under robe
WHIT SUNDAY 25 May
(PENTECOST)
patecoti - a dove
TRINITY SUNDAY 1 June
trinite - God the Father
CORPUS CHRISTI 5 June
(Thursday)
sacra - chalice
(ii) Those not depending upon Easter,
1546-73. These are given on p. 9 where
the horizontal lines refer to the years.
The vertical column headed laduent gives
the date of Advent (always November
except where marked December). The
three columns headed A le catre terns
15
give dates of Ember Wednesdays in
Winter (December), Summer (May or
June), and Spring (February or March).
(Note: Brouscon has made several
mistakes in this table).
Example What are the dates for 1570?
1. From Table 111, the Dominical for
1570 is a.
2. On p. 9, fourth line from bottom:
Advent 3 Dec
Winter Ember Wed 20 Dec
Summer Do. 17 May
Spring Do. 15 Feb
(F) Corrections for Pole Star observations
The altitude of the celestial pole above
the horizon is precisely equal to the
latitude of the place, so an observation
of the Pole Star’s altitude taken with a
cross staff can be used to find latitude.
However, the Pole Star describes a
small circle around the pole in 24 hours
and Brouscon supplies a small correction
in the third circle from outside of the
dial on p. 16, titled Regime pour lestoelle
l6
du nort, using the relative position of the
star Kochab the ‘guard’ in the Little
Bear as the hand of a celestial clock
to tell the mariner what correction is
needed. Red figures mean add, black
figures subtract *
Example Kochab was level and to the
right of Polaris (the 3 o’clock position)
*ln Brouscon’s original the figures at
compass points North and East appear in
red.
when the altitude of the latter was
measured as 37°. What was the latitude?
1. From the third circle on p. 16, at the
3 o’clock position, the correction is li
in red o o o
2. Latitude is therefore 37 +I2 =3Bi .
(G) Converting leagues into minutes of
latitude
Latitude is measured in degrees and
minutes whereas distances were (at that
time) measured in leagues (in Brittany,
in Spanish leagues of 4 miles, each of
5000 feet, at 17ito a degree). The two
left-hand columns on p. 9 marked les
deminutios des lieux par menutes a
Joter are a table for converting leagues
(lius) into minutes (min).
(II) Raising or laying one degree of
latitude
On p. 16, under the heading LA
SGOVDRILLE the second circle of the
dial gives the distance to sail in leagues
on the various courses in the outer circle
in order to change latitude one degree
18
in sixteenth-century parlance, to raise
(make the latitude greater) or lay (make
it smaller) one degree of latitude. For
example, if sailing due north, that
distance is 171 leagues, if north-east,
25 leagues.
(7) The chart of the coasts of north-west
Europe
This is entirely hand-drawn on vellum,
folded into the back of the book, with
south upwards as was French practice at
the time. In style it is a conventional
‘portulan’ chart of the period and looks
as though it has been well used.
This was an important work in the
history of navigation, providing as it did
many of the navigational needs of seamen
in northern European waters, including
means of finding positions by dead
reckoning when out of sight of land, and
for finding latitude by observations of
the Pole Star. As to Saints’ and Holy
Days, in the sixteenth century these
19
were used for arranging future
appointments in the same way as we
would use the days of the month today,
so knowledge of these was essential for
all commercial matters.
However, many seamen were not
literate. Brouscon’s innovation was
putting this information in a sign language
which could be understood by unlettered
mariners whatever their native tongue.
That his productions were popular in
England is proved by the fact that four
of the surviving copies of his almanac
are in or came from British libraries. For
a list of surviving copies, see Dujardin-
Troadec’s Les Cartographes Bretons du
Conquet mentioned in the Bibliography.
