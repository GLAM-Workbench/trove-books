mation so very thickly covered, that it will never pay
the expenses of working out the coal which may
exist. Dr. B. knows coal-measures in his country,
covered for a distance of some miles by the lower
red sandstone, of a thickness of about 3,000 feet.
Concluding, by geological principles, of the vicinity of
this formation, where people work out the coal in
abundance, that there must be lots of coal beneath
that sandstone, there is nobody having a fancy for
dissipating their money, by intending to work out the
coal through strata of rocks about 3,000 feet thick.
In consequence of our knowing that the water did
deposit the fioetz formation on the lower parts of
the surface of the earth, we search for coal
principally on the bottom and at the foot of the older
formations, and we like to explore those places where
the surface forms the figure of a tray; we carefully
examine the banks of the rivers and creeks, and the
deep dales between the hills, because in such places
the uncovered parts of the rocks are generally visible.
In the large plains, the coal measures are mostly very
thick, covered by younger deposits.
It is not difficult to distinguish the coal measures
from other formations, particularly where the coal
joins White?s Creek, rich in water, and it meanders
up to some miles behind White?s, through a very
fertile, fine plain, in the vicinity of which there exists
abundant timber. That country is very much ac-
commodated for settlement. The principal rocks
along the Rocky River are formed by c.ay-slate;
near White?s Creek there is more granite; the
younger formations are not visible, therefore no
coal measures. Good indications of copper ore in
the hills to the west of Mr White?s.
During his presence at Mr White's place, Dr B.
had an opportunity of examining the mine. Two
small lodes of a rich grey oxide and green car-
bonate, as well as bine carbonate of copper and tile
ore, are situated near the surface in a white sandy
clay, covered by the tertiary lime. The direction
ol the lodes is near south to north, the depth
about 50?60 � . Not far off them, there exist lodes
of clay iron ore and other iron ore. The mine re-
sembles in the situation, the exterior form, and in
the predominant rocks, very much the Kapunda
mine; and it may turn out to be a good mine, sup-
posing the works are not injured by the under-
ground water, which may be abundant.
Until you arrive at the Wild Dog Creek, the
country is fertile, and the hills on both sides of the
creek are worth a careful examination for copper
ore, and there is no doubt that the country for
about ten miles round Mr White?s is abundant in
minerals.
Dt B. now went up to the Mount Remarkable
Range, continuing his researches immediately along
the hills. The ground near the range is extraor-
dinarily stony ?fragments of the primary rocks and
sandstone, mixed with quartz, rendering it almost
impassable on horseback.
Intending to make excursions on the Mount Re.
markable Mining Company?s Survey, after his return
from the farther not th. Dr. B. resolved ts proceed
directly. He was strongly dissuaded from c irrying
out such intention by several persons who pointed
out the dangers incident .1 to a journey farther up,
and the acts of violence lately perpetrated by natives.
But he started, accompanied by a well-charged gun,
following his direction to the Mount Brown range.
Behind Mount Remarkable, beyond which there are
no roads or defined tracks, the road from Adelaide
to that place is, during the summer, a good one.
There are only single tracks from Mount Remarkable
up to Mr Burnett?s sheep-station near Mount Brown,
and the stranger in that country may miss them;
therefore it is better to go by the compass, especially
if it is not his intention to follow any road or track.
The Mount Remarkable range is distinguished by
its considerable elevation above the level of the sea ;
the highest point may be considered to be 3200 feet
above the same. There is no doubt that the range
is one of the finest and most romantic in South Aus-
tralia. The eastern side, from the top to the bottom,
is adorned by the finest trees, extending in some
places several miles into the plain. The trees be-
long partly to the spotted gum, partly to the box
and pine; the former show an extraornary circumfe-
rence and altitude, and they are not hurt by the fire.
Some of "the creeks are abundant in water, and the
soil on the plain going astray, the Narien range has
many spots capable of cultivation. The eastern side
of the same range is more precipitous, bears very
little timber, and is abundant in elevated and steep
hills, piling up behind each other, and extending in
some places to Spencer?s Gulf. Clay-slate, granititic
rocks, porphyritic rocks, hornstone, greenstone,
sandstone in large accumulations, compose confessedly
that range, which begins near Stony Creek, running
northwaid to the Big-spring Creek. There it is dis-
lodged, turning westward by a lower barren range,
running straight on to the Mount Brown range. The
Big-spring Creek, abundant in fresh water, is adorned
with old gum trees. The lower barren range bears
indications of copper ore. No coal.
If the traveller cross the plain between Mount
Remarkable and Mount Brown, he often has a delay
by the great number of creeks, with more or less
steep banks. Those creeks are without any water,
but often the soil near them is grassy and .well-
wooded, and it appears that water is to be got at a
moderate depth. Walking into the valleys formed
by the branches of the range, we observe that they
are very grassy, full of timber, and often of a very
romantic exterior. Examining the creeks on the
plain, Dr. Bruhn saw in one of them a peculiar saud,
composed of fragments of a white quartz, mica, iron-
pyrites, brown iron-ore, and a brown clay. He dressed
the sand, and found a nice quantity of gold-sand in
it, as he had supposed, but larger samples were not
to be found. A careful examination of the hills in
the vicinity of that creek may meet with good suc-
cess ; then the expectation of finding gold in South
Australia is to be realized at first in the north of the
coal. The result was not better than before?no-
where the coal measures, only the grey sandstone
alternating with clay-slate. He therefore came to
the conclusion that the sandstone, including the
bit of coal, may belong to the underlay ot the coal
measures, which often contain traces of coal, but
never real beds. Very dissatisfied, the journey

and traces of copper ore, and the principal
rocks. No coal. The Mount Lofty range in
different places has indications of copper, lead,

The foot ot the hills forming the boundaries of
the Adelaide plains, in the south and east of which
a number of creeks flow into the Torrens, furnish-
ing the same with water, also shows a striking de-
velopment of the primary rocks. They contain
iron, copper, lead, anu zinc; of the last mentioned
good indications, several kinds ot very fine lime-
stone, sandstone, &c.. but none of coal.
Dr, Bruhn then directed his course to the north
of Adelaide, examining the sea-coast and the plain
between the city and the Gawler River. Ihere
nothing is to be seen but the tertiary formation,
not very thickly developed ; and a careful exami-
nation of the sand in the plain, existing here and
there pretty extensively, shows all the constitu-
ent parts of the primitive rocks ; therefore, he may
presume that the older formation is immediately
covered by the tertiary in that plain. In many places
near the river there is a fine soil for agricultural pur-
poses. Going along the river, he went to the
Lyndoch Valley mine, producing several copper
ores, principally copper pyrites, peacock ore, green
carbonate, embedded in granite rock, and he does
not doubt that there is some gold in the ores; the
copper pyrites of his country always contain some.
He afterwards roamed through the country near the
German villages, through Flaxraan?s Valley, rich
in several minerals, and Mr Angas?s possessions to the
Murray scrub, but in all that country the presence
of coal is to answer in the negative. The range of
that country is abundant in minerals, interesting to
the mineralogist as they are. Beryl, turmalin, both
in fine crystals ; kaolin, or porcelain clay ; different
kinds of opal, jaspar, chalcedony, garnet, epidote,
kyanite, talc, feldspar, mica, primitive limestone,
&c.. The predominant; rocks are granite, granulite,
gneiss, and clay-slater lu some defiles in the vi-
cinity of Bethany there exists a surprising alterna-
tion of the granite and gneiss, roica-schist, and
greenstone, iron - conglomerates, and lodes of
quartz, and he observed in the same indications of
lead. As the lodes of ore are very promising in a
country where such an alternation has taken place,
he recommends the same to the consideration of the
reader.
Dr. Bruhn now resolved to return and to go
over to the Wakefield River and its environs, and
to proceed, by-and-by, farther up to the northern
parts of the colony. Accordingly, he followed the
great road leading from Gawler Town to the north.
The soil of the country near the road is mostly
formed by the predominant red clay of South Aus-
tralia and by sand, but in some parts the soil is
black, humid, and rich in vegetable 'matter ; timber
exists in sufficient quantity; the water, however,
may be scarce, and that may be the reason of the
few settlers along the road. No visible rocks
on the surface. Eight miles behind the ? North
Star" public-house, or eighteen miles behind
Gawler Town, the wide road divides at the right
hand leading to the Burra Burra Mines, while at
the left it runs up to the Wakefield River, by cross-
ing the Light and Gilbert Rivers. Here the rocks
are again visible on the surface; granite, including
lodes of quartz, go astray into the clay-slate rocks
towards the banks on this side of the Light, while
the other steeper banks of the same river are
covered by a deep sandy scrub. Although that
river in the summer time abounds in very brackish
water, that in the deep hole close by the road is
rather fresh and recreative.
A few miles farther the Gilbert river, abundant in
very brackish, not drinkable water, is to be crossed,
then the road becomes very hilly, very little fertile
country, poor in water, showing to the right hand
the hills on the Burra road, very little wooded, to
the left the lower barren plains. Granite and clay-
slate near the surface. With the beginning of the
Wakefield river the country alters; fertile valleys,
well wooded hills, in the river holes full of fresh
water. Full room for settlements. In the hills
westward by the road there exists a beautiful iron-
ore, as well as indications of copper-ore. The
predominant rock around that country is the clay-
slate, partly producing useful plates (plinth); the
lower country and the banks of the river are abun-
dant in blue and white clay and tertiary lime. The
Wakefield mine shows samples ot a rich green and
blue carbonate of copper, in lodes of red iron ore
and barytes. The rocks of the mine belong to the
transition of an extraordinary hard clay-slate into
grey wacke with embedded flinty slate.
bear the direction near south to north, and the
depth (inclination) may be estimated at 60 ?75 � . joi
There is every expectation that that place will turn up
out to be a good mine, if the lodes by its inclina- fer
tion be not dislocated, and if the afflux of the ab
underground water, as well as the very hard rocks, co
be not very hindering to the extension of the ale
works. An adit of about four fathoms may show ne,
very soon the real state of the lodes, and decide yo
the different opinions of the public on that place, co;
The section of Mr Butler?s is rich in iron ore near tin
the surface. Some hills near the Emu Flat are
very much developed by the grey v/acke slate, and ha
some of the creeks running into the large plain bear sm
fragments of rocks leading to gold. Steering from bo
the Emu Flat to the South, on the foo< of the range on
along the great plain, there are other indications clu
of copper; returning the same way about ten miles of
northward of the Emu Flat, the copper ore is to be ah
found in the porphyritic rock of a large hill. The of
country around the scrub in the plain shows nothing sei
.worth of a notice. No coal, th'
Wandering over to the Hutt River, Dr B. was
very satisfied by the fine soil, recommendable for
settlement, near the river. Some miles to the
north of Clare Village, there have been made open-
ings in the hills for the discovery of copper ore,
but instead of copper they only worked out big
lumps of brown iron ore; that country encloses no
copper; but more to the north there are good in-
dications close by the river ; the copper is there
embedded in quartz with brown iron ore and iron
pyrites. If we go from that place in the direction
N.E., we shall observe an extensive bed of mag-
nesian limestone in a valley between some not very
elevated hills; the latter belong to the primitive
formation. Very likely there exist coal mea-
sures below the magnesian limestone, which may
be ascertained by boring. A few miles farther up
Dr B. observed, in a littie dry and rocky creek, a
kind of loose grey micaceous sandstone, including
traces of coal. He was greatly rejoiced to observe
such traces, took them out, and became satisfied
from further observation of the existence ot real
coal ; but ail his endeavours to find larger quanti-
ties of ooal, or to ascertain the presence of coal-
measures on the spot and in the environs, were
fruitless. He therefore started along the Hill River,
crossing the Camel?s Hump, and went to the Burra
Burra mines. The shores of the Hill River are
principally low, the soil close by it is fertile, the
water fresh, in some parts a little brackish ; the
next hills are stony, rich in iron ore, but ill wooded.
Intending to examine the celebrated Burra Burra,
and the mines in its vicinity, Dr B. went to that
place ; but he could not get permission to visit the
underground of the Burra, aud he was therefore
restricted to the Bon Accord and Princess Royal
mines, the Superintendents of which were corres-
ponding with his desire, and accompanied him wi h
the greatest care through all the works of the said
mines.
Dr Bruhn considers it beside the purpose of
his expedition to give reports of the places as well
known by the reader as by himself. In relation to
the notorious mines, he refers the reader to the
collections of minerals which in a short time will be
delivered to them, including as they do specimens
of all the ores and rocks produced out of the
South Australian mines. His communications will
be confined to the country which is less known by
its situation and distance, and which will offer to
the subscriber interesting facts relative to the pre-
sence of coal, ore, &c. He only mentions that, not
only the primary rock, but also the intermediate
and fioetz-rocks, exist around the Burra and its vi-
cinity. They belong to the clay-slate, granite,
sienite, grey-wacke, porphyry, sandstone, conglo-
merates, and limestone, and contain a great variety
of There are indications of copper ore
near Mount Bryant, near Dr Brown?s head station,
as well as near the Black Spring, all worthy of con-
sideration.
During Dr Bruhn?s stay near the Burra, he had
to regret the loss of a very useful horse. Though
he was hobbled and tethered, he disappeared from
near the camp, and it is to be supposed that he
was stolen during the night. That fatality forced
Dr B. to return to Adelaide. As soon as he had
bought another strong horse, by the very kind sup-
port of many of his subscribers, he returned to
the Hutt River, examining once again that place,
where he saw the above-mentioned indications ot

There was not to be found out any passage by cart
over and through the hills, therefore Dr. B. was
forced to renounce the intention of proceeding as far
as possible to the Torrens Lake. This desire was to
ascertain the interior state of that mysterious lake,
and to return between Flinders Range'and the Gulf.
But now he resolved to go over to the opposite
eastern range, and explore apart of that range. The
journey nearly cost himself and his four fellow-
travellers their lives. They had to cross a large 1
plain, like the desert, without any water, grass, or
trees ; there being no traces of animal and vegetable
life. Men, horses, and dogs were without water
during two intensely hot days and nights, and they
could proceed only very slow, because the soil was so
weak, that the horses sank in at the ancle at every
step. Nearly destroyed, Dr. Brnhn at last reached
the foot of the eastern range, where he found fine
water and grass, at the place where the Kanjakka 1
river runs in the ranges.
That large and long creek, adorned by old gum-
trees, has no water on its long way through the '
plain. He examined the foot of the eastern range
and some valleys between it, and he saw places with
fresh water, grass, and timber. Therefore he sup-
poses that the range will not be so barren and dry c
as it is presumed, and his belief is, that the range 0
forming the continuation of the Narien range has a
been examined only very little, or not at all, before 1
him. The country is as rough and confused in a
the opposite western range, and there exist all the 0
indications of basalt hills. The predominant rocks r
are the transition of porphyry in sandstone in im- b
mense blocks, the grey wacke-slate, intermediate P
limestone, occarz-rock, clay-iron ore, immense des- a
troyed blocks of conglomerates formed by those k
rocks, embedding veins of calcareous spar, and S
covered by the tertiary formation, white pipe-clay, )'
&c. There exist, also, extended lodes of iron-ore,
with indications of copper-ore; but there is no coal.
About forty miles behind that range there is standing
out another one which appears to be more elevated
and precipitous than all the others seen before bv .
Dr B. J 4
Being dissatisfied with the results of his re-
searches, he now returned to Mount Brown, cros-
sing the plain by another line?overturned the cart
twice, left the cart in the hills, exposed to the dis-
cretion of the Natives, and plagued by immense
thirst, I e went down to Mount Brown with men and
horses for want of water. Two days later, cart and
baggage were found safe. From Mount Brown the men
and horses, all in a very bad state, went down to
Mount Remarkable. As yet Dr B. had enjoyed fine
and favourable weather ; bufc once a heavy rain, ac-
companied by a vehement storm, set in and conti-
nued some days. He had sufficient time to repose
from the fatigues of the previous weeks ; besides, the
observations of the climate, made by him, gave the
result that the climate of the northern part of the
colony is not so hot as it is to be presumed, and he
observed that along the northern range it was
clearer, more serene, and not so oppressively hot as
in many other places of the settled parts of South
Australia.
Dr B. made excursions on and around the Mount
Remarkable Mining Company?s survey. That sur-
vey is in general very hilly and abundant in diffe-
rent rocks, viz., clay-slate, mica-slate, greenstone,
liornstone, porphyry, limestone, sandstone, &c. The
copper-ores are not very rich ; they are imbedded in
barytes, manganese, specular-iron?the latter exist-
ing in immense blocks ; they belong to the green car-
bonate, grey oxyde, copper pyrites, and peacock-ore,
&c. In a creek of the survey there exists the ame-
somewhere in South Australia, although he had
lost so much money through unexpected expenses
and fatal accidents during his tour of exploration.
On the contrary, he intends to undertake other ex-
cursions to places where the presence of coal may
be presumed as soon as the weather and his funds
(at present quite exhausted) may permit him to
start. The results of his future explorations he
has determined to communicate to his late sub-
scribers without charge.

Passing over the more remote periods of Irish history,
we commence at that epoch which introduced the Mile-

we will take from Buchanan?s History of Scotland ; al-
beit, though not so directly and circumstantially re-
corded as in our own annals, yet, being derived from
an extrinsic source, it will be? regarded with less dis-
trust by Englishmen.
Tho Scottish historian, in the commencement of the
fourth book of his History of Scotland, writes as fol-

many collateral proofs, that a multitude of Spaniards,
expelled from their country by a more powerful party,
or who had emigrated voluntarily, owing to a redun-

they should abstain from all attacks on their allies, and
should cordially promote the dignity of the Empire.
