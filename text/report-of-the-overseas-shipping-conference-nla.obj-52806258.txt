2. We have examined the conditions existing in the overseas transport industry of Australia,
and have surveyed a wide range of evidence submitted to us on the different aspects of the problem.
We shall not, in this Report, enter into a minute discussion of the facts under consideration,
but we desire to report the following conclusions at which we have arrived as a result of our
deliberations.
LOSSES ON TRANSPORT OE CARGO.
3. It is the unanimous opinion of this Conference that, for the development of the commerce
of Australia and the carriage of her produce, an efficient and speedy service of suitable steamers
is necessary at stable rates. The figures attached (Appendix “ A”), certified by Price, Waterhouse
and Co., chartered accountants, of London, which do not include operations of mail steamers,
but are submitted by Lines amounting to about one-third of the total berth tonnage —British
and Foreign—serving Australia, demonstrate that, during the last three years, the regular British
cargo lines have suffered heavy losses in the Australian trade. We recognize that it is impossible
for enterprise to give good service at a loss.
The steamship owners suggest that some of these losses could and should be remedied by
an increase averaging approximately 7 per cent, in the freight rate to Australia, which would
yield, they estimate, i,30U,U00 to all Lines carrying cargo from the United Kingdom and Continent
to Australia. In the case of the ships included in the figures certified by Price, Waterhouse and
Co., such increase would have reduced their losses by approximately £lOO,OOO.
ORGANIZING TO ECONOMIZE.
4. This Conference unanimously agrees that, if further increases in the rate of freight to
and from Australia are to be avoided or reductions in freight made possible, it is necessary to secure
great economies, and we must explore not only dues, charges, and other expenses at the ports
and in taxes, but the major economy possible by the most efficient use of expensive steamers.
To achieve this end, this Conference resolves that representative Committees should be forthwith
created in the several Australian States to define and bring about the economies which shipowners
find possible in the employment and expediting of steamers, as well as all the economies possible
in dues, charges, taxes, and methods of working in Australia. These Committees should consist
of representatives of the producing, importing, and exporting interests in the several States,
nominated by the interests concerned, with a Central Committee having its head-quarters in Sydney,
and consisting of one or more representatives of each State Committee. The Overseas Shipping
Lines, on their part, will create similar Committees in the various States, with a Central Committee
in Sydney, with full power to co-operate with the Committees referred to above.
CONCEALED TAXATION OF TRANSPORT.
5. The cost of transport should no longer be increased by special taxes which amount
to an export tax, and are particularly undesirable.
As shown in- the attached statement by Messrs. Yarwood, Vane and Co., chartered
accountants, Sydney (Appendix “ B ”), an amount of more than £3,500,000 has been transferred,
during the five years 1024 to 1928 inclusive, to the general revenue of New South Wales, Victoria,
South Australia, and Western Australia, as a result of the practice of making transfers from surplus
port revenue to the State Treasuries, thereby burdening transport generally.
We desire to recall the Conference of State Premiers with the Prime Minister of Australia
on 25th May, 1923, at which the principle was unanimously approved, in the words of the Prime
Minister’s Report to the Imperial Economic Conference in London in 1923, “ a profit should not
be made out of harbour charges, naturally affecting freights which are a most important matter
to Australia; if revenue has to be raised, it is very desirable that it should be derived from some
other source.” Me understand that, with the exception of an Act recently passed in New South
Wales, and not yet in operation, no action has yet been taken by the State Governments to
implement this agreement, and we, therefore, consider that such action should be taken without
further delay, in order that this concealed method of taxing trade through transport may be
discontinued.
DOUBLE TAXATION OF SHIPPING EARNINGS.
6. As shown in the attached statement by Messrs. Yarwood, Vane and Co. (Appendix “ C ”),
the Commonwealth and States charge non-resident shipowners income tax, even if the ships make
losses, and the combined rate has increased over 280 per cent, since 1913.


We desire to draw attention to the general recognition by a large number of countries of
the principle that, when shipping profits are made, they should be taxed once, and once only,
namely, in the country of residence of the shipping company, in harmony with the general principles
evolved by Governments and the League of Nations for relieving international commerce from
the friction and waste of double taxation.
We believe that it would be in the ultimate interest of Australia, as a large exporter, to
adhere to this principle, as has already been done by the United Kingdom, Canada, United States
of America, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Holland, Denmark, Finland, Italy, &c.; but,
pending the adoption of this principle and recognizing the fact that Australia has few overseas
ships, we urge that, in common with other parts of the Empire, Australia should give immediate
effect to the attached scheme for relieving overseas shipping from the incidental injustice of
double taxation, as unanimously suggested by the Imperial Economic Conference in 1923
(Appendix “ D ”).
RATIONALIZATION.
7. Inasmuch as Australia buys and sells overseas, and to reach her far-distant markets
requires a regular service of fast special steamers at stable and not excessive rates, and as the
occasional incursion of outside steamers when trade is flourishing causes waste and increases
the cost of maintaining the service during the seasonal or periodic depression, we recommend
that any legislative bar to the making of agreements for the carriage of produce should be removed,
as being injurious to the welfare and economic development of Australia.
We unanimously submit that prompt action in this matter is essential, as rationalization
of overseas transport is largely dependent on prompt action.
FIXING OF FREIGHTS.
8. The Conference unanimously accepts the principle that rates of freight should be
determined in the country of origin of the cargoes.
MATTERS FOR DETAILED EXAMINATION.
9. The following questions should be examined in detail by the Committees proposed
above, with a view to their practical solution at an early date
(a) Duty on ships’ stores consumed on the Australian coast.
(b) Unnecessary delay in loading and discharging ships at Australian ports.
(c) Excessive number of ports called at in Australia.
(d) Delays and losses occasioned by industrial disputes.
(e) Improvement of port facilities in Australia.

APPENDIX “A.”
REPORT ON OPERATIONS OF SHIPS IN AUSTRALIAN TRADE, TOGETHER WITH STATISTICS
FOR THE YEARS 1926, 1927, 1928.
British cargo and cargo passenger lines regularly trading to Australia with steamers worth in each of the last
three years more than £10,000,000 have submitted their accounts to the well known chartered accountants, Messrs.
Price, Waterhouse and Co. In order to give the most accurate information possible about the relation between Australian
freight revenue and costs of regular cargo lines those lines whose revenue is not mainly derived from freight have been
excluded from these statements as well as ships whose voyages are not wholly between Australia and Europe. Messrs.
Price, Waterhouse compiled the information as follows :
“ (1) The actual voyage trading results should be certified by each individual company’s auditor.
(2) Only complete voyages of vessels loaded out and home ‘ on the berth ’ between the United Kingdom/
Continental and Australian ports should be included. Therefore, all voyages via the States and
bulk cargo voyages either way should be excluded.
(3) Freight for this purpose was to mean net ocean freight, and, therefore, all transhipment charges and
rebates were to be deducted.
(4) The charges for depreciation were to be based on the scales of depreciation allowed by the British
Taxation Authorities for the purpose of British Income Tax, e.g., the depreciation rate for a new
steamer (without refrigerating plant), is 4 per cent, per annum on the cost for the first 24 years of
its life, the remaining 4 per cent, being considered the break-up value of the ship. Where the ship
was not engaged in the Australian trade for the whole of the year, then the charge would be appor-
tioned on a time basis. The example given below in paragraph 5 shows how this figure for depreciation
is computed.
(5) The amount to be shown for capital in steamers was to be based on the cost of the steamer, reduced
by the allowance f< r depreciation up to the beginning of the year. A proportion of the depreciated
cost was to be apportioned over the voyages concerned on the basis of time. For example, a steamer
costing £500,000 was delivered on the Ist January, 1926, and traded for the first three months in
the Australian trade and was engaged in another trade for the remainder of the year.
(6) Should a company have difficulty in apportioning its general expenses and management charges over
the voyages, it was arranged that the rate should be based on a percentage of the total earnings of
the lines applied to the voyages concerned.
(I'f No charges were to be made for Debenture Interest, or interest on borrowed money, or British Income
Tax.
(8) It was arranged to show the expenses in Australia separately and to express these as a percentage of
the total earnin of the voyages. The definition ‘ Expenses in Australia ’ was Australian Port
Dues, and Charges, Towage, Pilotage, Charges on Cargo, Brokerage Commission, Loading and
Discharging, ‘ Dumping,’ and Federal and State Income Tax, but not Fuel, Stores, Crew’s Wages,
Repairs or Insurance.’

In a signed statement Messrs. Price, Waterhouse and Co. summarize as follows the results obtained from
statements 1 to 4 : •
Cargo Ships. —
The above figures contain no charge for “ Lay-up ” expenses or interest on borrowed money. It
was found difficult to identify the “ Lay-up ” expenses of the Australian Trade of certain lines which
operated in other routes, and it was considered advisable not to make any arbitrary apportionments, but
to exclude these “ Lay-up ” expenses in their entirety.
Assuming that a return of 10 per cent, on the capital in ships be the return required to cover interest,
lay-up expenses, and profit, and accepting the expenses as recorded for the years, the ratio of increase on
earnings to offset the loss and to produce this 10 per cent, return would be as follows :
The following figures show comparisons, expressed to the base of £lOO earnings, of the detailed operating,
general expenses and depreciation for the two categories (cargo and cabin-cargo ships) for the three years 1926, 1927,
and 1928.

Dear Sir,
In regard to your inquiry as to the Income Taxes payable in 1914 and 1928 by auon-resident shipping company
on assumed freight earnings of £lOO in each of the five Australian States (Tasmania being omitted), we advise that
in the aggregate the taxes payable in 1928 show an increase of 284 per cent., as compared with those levied in 1914.
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) YARWOOD, VANE & CO.,
with Mason Allard.
APPENDIX “D.”
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SHIPPING TAXATION COMMITTEE ON THE IMPERIAL ECONOMIC
CONFERENCE ADOPTED BY THE COUNTRIES ON 6th NOVEMBER, 1923.
The Committee have considered carefully the first suggestion in the report of the Imperial Shipping Commitee
that the solution might be found by the various Governments of the Empire agreeing to the exemption from Income
Tax of the non resident British ship-owner. Such a solution of the problem has been brought recently into great
prominence by the offer of the United States of America to grant exemptions from Income Tax to the shipping of any
country granting an equivalent exemption to United States shipping, and by the corresponding action of the United
Kingdom Government in taking power, under the Finance Act of 1923, to conclude reciprocal arrangements with any
foreign State for the granting of this exemption.
Such an arrangement between the; countries cf the; Empire would, of course, be a complete and very simple
solution of the ship-owners’ difficulties. The proposal, however, besides involving considerations as to the yield of
revenue 1 , raised far-reaching questions of principle, and the Committee’s discussions disclosed no present prospect of
the various Governments reaching unanimity on this subject. The Dominion of Canada exempts from income tax
the profits of non-resident ship-owners, and it would seem right that Great Britain should take power to make reciprocal
arrangements with that Dominion (and any other Dominion or Government which might choose to adopt the like
principle) on the lines of the legislation as to reciprocity for foreign countries included in the Finance Act of 1923. To
meet other cases, the Committee have turned from the consideration of any solution based upon this principle to
proposals which do not in any way impair the right of any country of the Empire to tax income arising within the
sphere of its jurisdiction. For the reasons indicated in paragraphs stoB of this Report the Committee recommend
that henceforward the normal basis of assessment to income tax on the profits of non-resident British ship-owners in
the various countries of the Empire should be the actual trading results and not a statutory percentage of freights,
fares. &c.
For the more convenient ascertainment of the profits chargeable, combined with duo security to the exchequers
concerned, the Committee recommend that, as a working rule, the countries of the Empire should adopt the following
practical administrative measures :
(a) The ship-owner to furnish the complete accounts of his business to the taxing authority of the country
in which he resides, i.e., the country from which his business is directed and controlled.
(h) Where a ship-owner, in addition to trading in the country, where he resides, trades also with other
country or countries of the Empire where income tax is levied, the taxing authority of the country
in which the ship-owner resides to furnish him upon request with a certificate stating —
(i) The ratio of the profits of any accounting period as computed according to the Income Tax
Law of the last-named country (subject to adjustment as may bo necessary in regard to
loan interest) to the gross earnings of the ship-owner’s vessel or fleet; or
(ii) the fact that there were no such profits.
(c) The non-resident ship-owner to produce the above-mentioned certificate together with a return of the
amount of his freight, fares, &c., to the taxing authority of each country in which such income arises
and that authority to apply the certified percentage to the amount of the freight, fares, &c., in that
country in order to compute the amount of the profits assessable there.


(d) Where a country interested in the settlement of this percentage has a representative in the country
where the ship-owner resides, that representative, after being sworn to secrecy, would confer, where
he deems it necessary, with the taxing authority concerning the certificate to oe granted to the
ship-owner.
(e) While normally it may be unnecessary for a taxing authority, assessing the profits of a non-resident,
ship-owner on the basis of these proposals to raise an assessment on a percentage of freight, fares
&c., before receipt of the certificate referred to in (b) above, circumstances may exist where such
an assessment is desirable (for example, in the case of the casual call of the tramp ship where there
is no responsible resident agent) ; but where this is necessary, the ship-owner should have the right
to claim adjustment in due course on the basis of the certificate.
It seems to the Committee that these recommendations as a whole would, if adopted, substantially remove the
difficulties to which the Report of the Imperial Shipping Committee is directed, without impairing the jurisdiction
of the Governments concerned.
On behalf of the Committee,
(Sgd.) R. V. NIND HOPKINS, Chairman.
