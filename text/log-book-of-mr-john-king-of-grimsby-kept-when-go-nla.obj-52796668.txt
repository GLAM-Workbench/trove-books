INTRODUCTORY NOTES.
The immediate sale, as soon as published, of the 2,000 edition
of H. Tomlinson’s Diary a few months ago, has shewn the inter-
est taken in the treatment of emigrants on their voyage out to
New Zealand, and knowing that a widespread demand for know-
ledge on this subject still exists, the Editors have resolved on the
present issue. The writer himself says of the work, —“ In wri-
ting this Diary I have given the principal facts as they have oc-
cured, and have not gone beyond the truth. The distances and
latitudes are given as they came out of the cabin, and the ther-
mometer was hung on the mast in the ’tween-decks between two
hatchways and so in a draught. It was cooler below in the
Tropics than on deck, and much warmer below after we passed
the Cape of Good Hope, so that the two extremes were really
greater than they seem to be.’’
The careful records of distance and temperature with latitude
and longitude, give Mr. King’s Diary a high value, and the tables
published herewith, in conjunction with Chart of the Voyage
(which will be published early in the New Tear in the sixpenny
Book now in the press, see advertisement), will be of immense
value and permanent interest to all who contemplate the journey,
or who wish to trace the probable progress of friends on the way.
This Diary will help too in dispelling the unreasonable and
unreasoning fears many have with respect to life at sea. The
experience of all emigrants seems to coincide, namely; that the
home fears are mostly visionary, and that the realities are,
after all that may be said about them, “ all the paths of the Lord
are mercy and truth,” and that, as the old proverb hath it, “ the
path of duty is the path of safety.”
Believing that many another labouring man will, at duty’s call,
“ get him from his country and from his father’s house,” and
that this emigration work is all included in the counsel of Him
“ who wind and sea controls,” the Editors send this forth on
its mission confident that the time is hastening when “ the earth
shall yield her increase ,” and “ all the people shall praise the Lord,
yea all the people shall praise Him.”

LETTER FROM MR. KING.
New Plymouth, Province of Taranaki,
New Zealand, Sept. 30th, 1875.
Dear Me. White,
Sib, —I told you that I should write a Diary of our voyage to New Zealand,
in the ship “ Chile,” and I have sent it to you, hoping that it may get printed
in a small book, for this is the wish of most of the Emigrants that came out in
pur ship. Mr. John Jackson, of Hatcliffe, was to have written one, and when
he saw this, he said he would leave it with me, as he had his time took up with
the office of constable, he has heard it all read and sanctions it all true. I have
given the Latitude and Longitude as taken every day, hut you can either leave
it out or not, and the heat as registered by the Thermometer every day, how-
ever I shall leave it in your hands to do your best, for there is nothing that I
am ashamed of. I hope if it is printed, yon will send half a dozen to John Day-
hell, of Branston, near Lincoln, for I am the only one that has left home, and
they will most likely he glad to hear some account of our voyage, for I cannot give
all particulars in a letter. I hope I have written it according to printers’ rules,
if not, I hope to be excused, for I have done my best, for writing on hoard ship
is not always very convenient. We have had a rather long voyage, hut have
been very comfortable, and the ship is one of the dryest ships afloat, for it was
not pumped out all the time, and we had a very civil lot of sailors, and never
had a wrong word between them and the children. The provisions provided by
the New Zealand Government is very good in quality, and every necessary for
sick people on board, and no man could wish to be better treated than we were,
still we were glad when we got on shore, and the treatment we are receiving
here is all that we can desire. It is probable that most of us with families will
go into the bush to a new settlement called Inglewood, but we hope future
letters will supply you with all information, for we can’t be expected to know
much yet. We like the appearance of the country so far, and hope it will prove
what we expected, for we are determined to live if permitted.
September 29tb.—We were all entertained at a public tea to-day, and were
Welcomed by some of the principal inhabitants of this place, and advice given
to us. This has not happened to any fresh comers to England in the memory
of man, and the treatment we are receiving at the Barracks, is of the most lib-
eral kind, and proves to us that the New Zealand Government are sensible as
to the value of Labourers who come out here. The climate here must he mild
for the scarlet geraniums are standing in the gardens from last summer, and
look well. If this Diary is printed, I should be happy to see a few, and all the
Emigrants in the “ Chile” would like one, but this I shall leave with you, the
trouble of this to me has not been much, and if it will do any good, by afi means
let it be done, for there is plenty of room here.
. I shall now conclude with my best respects to you and family, and if you send
some to Mr. R. Millington, of Grimsby, he will sell you 600 of them amongst
our friends and fellow workmen. I should be happy to hear from you, if you
have the time, for there is a lot of Lincolnshire people here now.
Yours truly.

New Plymouth,

MR. J. KING’S DAILY RECORD.
June Bth, 1875.—Left Grimsby at 9. 35. a. m. for London.
There was an immense crowd to see ns off; amongst them many
relations, friends, and fellow-workmen, who all seemed to be
more affected at parting than many of ns who were leaving;
however, they raised a faint cheer, which was repeated at all
the stations np to Boston, where something like a reception
was given ; a hand of mnsic and refreshments, free, were pro-
vided by the Officers of the Labour League. We then went on
to Peterboro’, where we were put on the express, and ran to Fins-
bury Park without stopping, we were then taken to Bow Station
where all the baggage was turned out, through having to get a
short distance on another Company’s line. I had provided for
this by cording my boxes well, for those that was lightly done
came to grief, and I would warn all who may follow to take
the hint. We arrived at the Emigration Depot at Blackwall at
6. 30. p. m. and had a good feed, which was very acceptable
after a few hours ride. The Depot was a very different place to
what I expected to find it; it has been a large Hotel, and is a
first class place.
June 9th, —Kemained at the Depot this day, and passed the
Doctor, Had a look round some of the Docks, and went on
board the “ Chile” for the first time; she was not finished load-
ing, but was moved to the lock ready for morning, to be towed
to Gravesend.
June 10th, —Left the Depot this day at 1. 30. p. m. and was
cheered by all the company on the quay. Had a fine trip down
the river Thames to Gravesend, and got on board at 4. 30. p. m.
Mr. & Mrs. Burton, and Mr. White, bid us farewell, and we
opened out our beds, and all of us appeared satisfied with the
bedding,, and, bunks. We aU had a very comfortable night on
board.


June 11th, —Passed another examination this morning, and
was visited by a clergyman, who brought a quantity of hooks
and papers from the Religious Tract Society. What with pre-
sents from Mr. Riggall of Grimsby, and those to-day, we have
abundance of reading. We weighed anchor at 4. p. m. and fired
a salute, and were towed below Sheemess: blowing very hard,
the ship was brought up for the night.
June 12th, —Weighed anchor at 4. a. m. with a strong wind
which increased to a gale, and almost to a hurricane at noon;
were compelled to let go anchor off Ramsgate at 2 p. m., and as
may be judged, nearly all hands were sick, some very bad, who
found willing hands to help them, and just at the worst time,
the Cook jumped overboard, which upset the women, so that it
made them worse still. He floated on his belly for full quarter
of an hour. The lifeboat was launched, but the sea was so
rough, it was some time before he was picked up; however, he
floated like wood, and was brought on board alive. I never saw
such an instance as this in my fife, and I have seen several over-
board ; he had the “ horrors ” through drink (the old source of
trouble.)
June 13th (Sunday),—Still riding off Ramsgate, a strong
head wind, got under weigh during the morning, and after tack-
ing the ship a long time, brought up again off Deal with a gale
of wind from the S. W. Not much sickness to-day. A few of
the women still very ill from the previous days gale; the weather
very cold. No service of any sort to day, on account of the
work on deck with the sails, and the local preachers not being
very well. The Thames Pilot left ns to-day, taking all the letters.
Junel4th, —Still riding in Deal Roads, with wind right ahead'
Nearly all completely recovered from our sickness. Weather
very cold; the children are all full of play, and appear delighted
with the situation.
June 15th, —Still riding in Deal Roads, close to Walmer Castle,
with the wind dead ahead, and blowing' half a gale. We are
getting sea legs now, for it has been blowing hard ever since we
came on board. Only Mrs. Bancroft that is seriously ill, two or
three others poorly, but not seriously. Owing to the continued
strong head wind, and having to remain in the same place, it
begins to be rather monotonous. One of the pigs got out to-day,
and jumped into the sea, and was lost,
June 16th, —Wo are still' riding in Deal Roads, with a strong
head wind; the wind goes down towards night, and looks like


fine weather. Had a prayer meeting, which was well attended,
led by Mr. Carter.
June 17th, —Weighed anchor at 2. a. m. and got on the way;
only reached a little past the Dungeness light, was a very pleas-
ant day, wind dead ahead. '
June 18th, —Very calm, scarcely make two miles an hour, wind
dead ahead, sea smooth as glass.
June 19th, —Still a contrary wind; have to tack the ship all the
way down the Channel; we make very little progress so far; kill-
ed the first sheep to day to'save its life, it was ill.
. June 20th (Sunday,)—The wind still ahead; sighted the Isle
of Wight, beautiful scenery; had a service in the afternoon, the
sermon by Mr. Goodhand, and one in the evening by Mr. Carter
on “Human Culture,” both well attended.
June 21st, —Sighted Portland this morning, wind still ahead,
the letter bag hung up for the letters, there are over 150; the pi-
lot leaves us at the Start Point, at 11 p. m. had a better wind in
the night, and got out of sight of land.
June 22nd, —We got a tremendous rolling to-day, and several
more are sick, we begin to see the reality of being at sea; have a
better wind towards night, and make 100 miles to-day, (for dist-
ance each following day see Table at the end.)
June 23rd, —A rather rough night, several sick, and a heavy
swell all day. The school started to-day, conducted by Mr.
Phipps; just on the edge of the Bay of Biscay, the Latitude and
Longitude as taken, kindly hung out daily by the officers. Dist-
ance 110 miles from England.
, June 24th,—Had a better wind to-day, but it became nearly
calm towards night, which gave us such a fearful rolling as few
of us have had, and several of the tables were cleared of their
contents.
June 25th,—Had a fearful night’s rolling, had to secure every-
thing on the tables, and we were not very comfortable in bed, the
wind was fair behind the ship, so could not set any stay-sails to
keep her steady.
June 26th, —The wind better to-day, ship did not roll much,
which made it more pleasant for us all.
June 27th (Sunday,)—Had a very fine day, very pleasant on
deck, and had service morning and evening, the sermon by Mr.
Jackson.
June 28th, —A beautiful day, nothing to see but water; killed a
pig-to-day..


June 29th,—-Splendid weather, and 30th, —Nothing of note
occurring.
July Ist, —Sighted the Island of Madeira this morning, beauti-
ful weather, the sun is beginning to be rather hot, but very plea-
sant at evening.
July 2nd, —We are just getting into the ‘ trade winds,' and all
things go gaily, the ship takes no working now.
July 3rd, —A fine wind, we see a few waves now, everybody
enjoys the voyage so far; the children are all life and as happy
as can be.
July 4th (Sunday) All on deck to pass the roll call at 10. a.m.
the Captain and Doctor inspect between decks; service at 10'30,
the sermon by Mr. Jackson, also in the evening, there is a
prayer meeting during the week, and two have been brought into
the fold of Christ this week.
July sth, —A nice wind, and now we see the beauty and gran-
deur of the sea, no artificial fountains can display the wonderful
scenery that we now behold; our ship is like a toy on the mighty
deep, yet we can enjoy the gorgeous scenery in perfect safety.
How thankful we ought to be to Him who rules the wind and
waves.
July 6th, —The sun right above our heads, but a nice breeze
which makes it very pleasant; it is remarkable how soon it is
dark after sunset, very dark at 7-30 p.m. We see a lot of flying
fish now; sighted a steamer and signalled to her, “all well,” and
was answered, the first ship for nine days,
July 7th, —This being the last day of the month with the
sailors, they ride the dead horse around the deck, singing, and
haul him up to the yard arm, and fire him; he is cut down, and
thrown into the sea, afterwards flare lights and rockets are burn-
ed ; this affords an hour’s amusement fbr all hands, and particu-
lary the children. The night ended with a very melancholy
circumstance, the Cook who jumped overboard at the beginning
of the voyage, and has never been right since, died at 9-30 p.m.
July Bth, —We had a funeral ceremony this day at 11 a.m.,
most of us had not seen such a one as this before, and hope it
may be the last we shall have to witness. The service was read
by Mr.. Carter.
July 9th, —The Fire Brigade practises to-day, with buckets and
hose. A fair wind but very soft and warm.
July 10th, —A quantity of Locusts were caught yesterday, two-
inches long; they are four winged, and are supposed to come from
South Africa. For a description of their ravages, read the 2nd


chapter of Joel, 2nd and following verses.
July llth (Sunday,)—Calm this morning, and drifting west-
ward with the tide, a nice shower of rain, the first we have had ;
service at 11 a.m. sermon by Mr. Jackson, no service in the after-
noon, it being wet. This was a day of misfortunes, the Cook
could not get the water hot for breakfast, so we had cold water,
and no plum dough to-day,hut we had a roll in the afternoon, our
bull’s eye was open, and we got flooded with water; others had
their tables cleared of their contents, and the butter being soft, it
was a sad mess.
July 12th, —It is now very warm, and several are only mid-
ling on account of the heat; we see several large fish of the Gram-
pus species, and a shark, he takes the bait off a hook, hut leaves
the hook all right. Moire rain to-day.
July 18th, —More showers to day and a nice breeze, hut we
make little headway, we don’t require many clothes now, for the
heat is about the same, night as day.
July 14th, —Sighted a homeward bound ship, and the letters
had to he got ready in a hurry, she was the “ Borchard” from
Monte Video to Havre, 27 days out; as soon as the boat got
hack, sighted another ship, the “ Edith Bertham” from Bangoon
to Ealmouth, 83 days out. It is now very close below, and all
the ports are open, and just as tea is got ready, friendk Messrs.
Jackson and Jacklin, are treated to a hath through the ports,
and had to change their linen, —Although this is unpleasant, it
is the cause of a good laugh for those that escape such accidents.
July 16th, —Sighted the “ Mary Sheppard” from Monsoon
Cottah to London, 89 days out.
July 16th, —We are now in the hottest part of the tropics,
and it is like sleeping in an oven in our hunks :-several sleep on
deck, and any place where it is cool.
July 17th,—We are all in first rate health, hut are troubled
with an insect that St. Patrick did not destroy; they are very
voracious, and will attack the biggest man on hoard. Signalled
the French Barque “Ees’ol”, from Bordeaux to Buenos Ayres, 28
days out.
July 18 (Sunday—A very good wind blowing, but nearly ahead,
it makes it very pleasant on deck. The usual muster, to pass the
Capt. and Doctor; service at 10. 30. sermon by Mr. Goodhand,
and an address by Mr. Carter in the afternoon.
July 19th, —Orders to regulate the baking issued; the single
men and girls to take 3 days a week, and married people to take
3 days. Since we had been in the Tropics, the Baker has been
very unfortunate with the bread, it is sour, and sad, and this is


cansing dissatisfaction, for several stones bad to be thrown over-
board, not fit to eat.
July 20th, —We have had the best day’s sailing to-day since
we have been on hoard, but the ship “ City of Florence” passed
ns, bound for Melbourne.
July 21st, —This was a great day for us; we crossed the Equa-
tor last night, and Old Neptune, (The God of the sea), boarded
us; he rode in his chariot round the deck, accompanied by his
wife and all his attendants, he demanded all the sailors before
him, who had not previously crossed the line; his officers brought
them up to him, he then asked who they were, and wherefrom?
They gave various answers, and he ordered them into the hands
of his doctor, who set their broken limbs, administered salts and
senna and a pill; he then ordered them to be shaved, after shav-
ing, he ordered them a bath, they were then pitched into a sail
fnll of water, where four ‘bears'washed them, and they were free
men. His officer was then seized, and washed, and then Nep-
tune himself was pitched in, and a few of us Emigrants were
christened with salt water. In the afternoon varions sports
came off, jumping in sacks, a three legged race, standing jumps,
horizontal bar, and a sailors’ cock fight. All this was immense
amusement for all hands, and particularly the children. In the
evening we had a very creditable “ Christy Minstrel” entertain-
ment by the sailors, the usual conundrums, some very good,
were given, and I think we all enjoyed the day first rate.
July 22nd, —A subscription list handed round, as an acknow.
lodgement for the sailors providing such a treat, crossing the
line, amounting to over 2 pounds.
July 23rd, —A strong wind, had to take in the ‘ royals’ for the
first time since leaving land. A good shower of rain in the
morning, and a nice spray came over the ship, and wetted the
adult school.
July 24th, —A strong wind to day, and the ‘ foremainsail’ tom
with the wind, first mishap since leaving the land. We have
some little differences about the girls now, but the first practice
in the manly art (or the unmanly), takes place to day; one of
the men knocks his wife down, which brings him into an unen-
viable position, for he is freely taken to task by both men and
women.
July 25th, (Sunday),—The usual muster on deck at 10 o’clock,
and all hands answer to their names; service at 10. 30. the ser-
mon by Mr. Goodhand, and well attended.
July 26th, —We now begin-to see what a tropical squall means,


wo have to bold on by band and foot, and we see a few waves,-
which disturb our dinner things on the tables. Mr. Turner falls
down a ladder, and hurts his face very much.
July 27th, —Better weather to-day, not so much pitching
about, and begins to bo colder for us ; we are leaving the sun
now, and it is plainly visible that we are moving round the globe.
July 28th —We are getting through the tropics very pleasantly,
and had the last lot of lime juice served out yesterday.
J uly 29tb, —This being a remarkably fine day, the boxes were
got out of the hold for the second time.
July 80th, —With the exception of vegetables I rather like the
voyage, for the women do not ask for any money, and seem to get
used to all things here. We had an increase this evening, Mrs.
Rowson was confined of a daughter, all well.
J uly 31st, —A good shower of rain to-day, which brought down
the temperature towards night, killed sheep No 2 to-day.
August Ist (Sunday,)—Passed the roll call at 10 a.m., and
service at 10-30, sermon by Mr. Thomas. Wo are reminded of
the near approach of winter, for it has turned cold in a few hours
and is dark from six lo six.
August 2nd, —Up to now we have had a most pleasant passage,
but wo were woke up this morning by several of the tins falling
off the tables, some of the sails were torn to pieces, and most of
them had to bo stowed ; but the most fun was at our meals, for it
was not possible to keep things on the tables, and some of the
biggest men had to fall on deck like a child, and some were sick,
and we saw such a sea as few of us have seen ; at midnight they
put the ship about, she pitched such a quantity of things on the
deck. It was amusing to see nearly all hands scraping them up,
this mostly creates a loud cheer, and we say, there’s another pull
for Taranaki. •
August 3rd, —A strong wind and a very rough sea, which calm-
ed down towards evening, the nights are now' cold and the wo-
men begin to gather around the lamps in lots and discuss the busi-
ness of the world, and Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so, in the usual confid-
ential way, which none but women can do.
August 4th, —After a storm a calm, so we are not doing much
just now, had a head-wind for several days; visited by a lot of
Cape Pigeons whioli follow us for food.
August sth, —Some people might imagin' l that the time would
hang heavily on our hands, but this is not the case, for it is surpris-
ing how swiftly it passes, the more sea the merrier, for it is always
cause for a laugh, when a sea comes and damps a Jot of us dowm


August Cth, —It is remarkable wbat little there is to see in this
latitude, but the Capo Pigeons have afforded employment to some
in trying to catch them, but they are like birds on shore, not
caught with chaff, however, two were caught to-day.
August 7th, —Almost a dead calm, nothing to see but sky and
water except a few birds.
August Bth (Sunday,)—A beautiful morning, passed the roll
call at 10, service on deck, sermon by Mr. Jackson. These ser-
vices are attended by the principal part of the Emigrants, but the
Irish mostly surround the pig-stye, smoking their pipes ; it is the
same here as on shore, there are those that scoff at others trying
to worship God.
August 9th, —We got a fair wind last night, and the ship gave
ns a good rolling, we hope to have got the trade winds now to
round the Cape.
August 10th, —“The early bird for the worm.” Some of the
early risers were on deck this morning, and the first sea shipped
since we came on board comes, and they got such a drenching
they had to change their clothes, we had a dose down below for
the first time, the hatches were down most of the day, our house
was like a bedlam house with the children.
August 11th, —The wind and sea much calmer to-day, which
is very acceptable, for we have had two days’ and nights’ roll-
ing, so that we begin to long for something solid to stand upon.
August 12th, —We were again reminded of the uncertainty of
time to-day; a single man named James Hands died, after being
ill a few days; ho had the complaint before he came on board
the ship, he was an Irishman and Roman Catholic, so prayers
were read by the Doctor, and he was buried at 5. 30. p. m.
August 14th, —The schoolmaster has been ill this week, and
there has been no school, so the boys have had liberty, and we
had to put up with a good deal of annoyance that we should not
have had; we had a fair wind to-day and sailed along nioely.
Killed pig No. 2. to-day.
August 15th, —This was a very wet morning, so the usual
roll call could not bo held on deck, the Captain and Doctor came
below and had a look at us, we were in the usual state of con-
fusion that we always are in when the weather is bad. There
was no service to-day the weather was too rough. This was the
best day’s sailing since leaving England.
August 16th, —Had a very rough night, had to take in several
sails, and very cold; the school held in the hospital, too rough
on deck.
August 17th, —Several birds caught yesterday and to day,


ono measured seven feet across the tip of his wings. It is my
opinion that if the young men had known what they know now,
some of them would have got married, for they have no ono to
look after them, so things take the “ happy-go-lucky” style, for
the females can make things a little more homely even here; so
I advise all who follow to take the hint, as some here would
have done had they known.
August 18th, —We all live and learn, and any man emigrating
requires a whole face to keep up to Ids turn here; he has to
keep his eye on the provisions being served out the proper
weight, but then ho is at the mercy of the cook, for he is sure
to boil the meat well for the sake of the fat ; rice and oatmeal
are not so particular, for there is no fat in them, so we take
things as they come.
August 19th, —Although we have had a first rate voyage up
to now, we could have made things better had we known: at
first we were sick and then had hot weather, so we could not eat
quite so much as now it is cold, several had a home-fed ham,
and so humoured their appetite; now we begin to feel the want
of something such as Cheese or Onions, or some Preserves, for
the stipulated daily diet, although good, is stalling in the absence
of vegetables, and I hope any who follow, may take the hint,
August 20th, —A good wind last night, but calmed down this
morning, and the ship rolled a deal during the day.
August 21st, —The greatest trouble with the women was leav-
ing home for a foreign land; the case is reversed here, for us lords
have to wash dishes, fetch all the grub in, clean the house, and
hang the clothes out, while the ladies retire from the tables, and
have a chat. There is no husbands’ tea here, we are always at
home when wanted. We were all very glad when the stores were
served out to-day, for we have had the worst butter that ever I
ate this week, it was shared all over the ship alike, and a lot of
it was put in the cook’s grease-tub.
August 22nd (Sunday),—The usual muster did not take place
to-day, the weather being too rough, a service was held below in
the afternoon, sermon by Mr. Thomas. The single girls were
kept below all day much against their own will, the wind being
fair astern there was some danger of shipping a sea over the stem.
I had a desire to see a rough sea, and I was satisfied to-day, the
surface of the sea had the appearance of drifting snow, and the
waves presented the most splendid scenery that I ever saw; all
the sails had to be taken in, but the Foresail, Poretopsail, and
Maintopsail, our ship takes very little water on board, and is like


a duck on the water; an extra man at the wheel all day; nobody
sick now.
August 28rd, —The wind has gone down but there is a heavy
swell on, which makes the ship roll very much and us rather
uncomfortable.
August 24th, —We had more rolling last night than ever we
had before, the wind fair at the stern; it is now getting very cold
for us.
August 25th, —We have not seen a ship for 24 days, only a
few birds that follow us for food; wo saw some large Grampus
fish this morning, have not seen any fish for a long time, wo can
tell that days are getting a little longer.
August 26th, —Just sighted a ship yesterday, not near enough
to signal, the first for 24 days, had a good wind to-day, and very
cold and wet at night.
August 27th, —We had the deck limewashed yesterday, ac-
cording to order of the Emigration Commissioners, and to-day it
was wet and it made us in a very miserable plight below. It is
a pity that those Commissioners have not to be put under the
same orders, and in our position; they would then understand
what they do, and this is for the good of their health! I think
if the management of the Emigrants was left to the Captain and
Doctor we should not suffer here, for we are treated with the
greatest civility by all the officers and sailors on this ship, we
have not had a word of unpleasantness towards any of us; this
has been the greatest pull for New Zealand we have had, —252
miles!
August 28th, —We had two portable fires in our hold, termed
(Devils), yesterday to dry us up, but the skylight was lifted at
the same time and the glass fell from 48 to 46 degrees. There
are several cases of chilblains amongst us now ; killed sheep No.
3 to-day.
August 29th (Sunday,) —We had the roughest night last night
we have had, and our ship is admitted to be one of the best sea
boats afloat; we got a little water down below, which makes us'
rather uncomfortable. We had no muster again to-day, the wea-
ther too rough and cold; we require all the warm clothing that
we were instructed to bring.
August 30th, —We now begin to reckon how many weeks we
have to be on board ship, for we are getting tired of the style of
cooking and baking here, although they do the best they can,
give mo the cooking on shore, as we begin to feel the want of
vegetables, and seasoning of food, which can’t be done here.


August 31st, —We are supposing at home they are in the
middle of harvest, we had a very severe snowstorm with lightning
at 3 a.m., and several move squalls during the day, very cold on
deck, we now feel the want of fii es very much, for several are suf-
fering from frosty feet.
September Ist, —We are now in the height of winter, very
severe snow squalls, and a sea like mountains, during these squalls
at night the masts and yards appear lighted with lights, they are
called “ St. Elmo’s Fire,” and by the sailors ‘‘ Jack o’ Lanterns,”
it is formed by the electricity in the air, and only appears in this
and northerly latitudes; I stopped on deck on purpose to see them
until 11-35 p.m., last night. 1 and several others wore waiting the
dumplings coming out to-day, and we got such a ducking that I
had to change my clothes ; this always raises a cheer with those
that escape, and we have to put up with it all.
September 2nd, —Much calmer weather to-day hut squally, we
have now had two or three gales of wind, and I don’t think any
of us has seen anything’ to bo alarmed at yet, we have a good
ship which is a great consolation, for the sea was much dreaded
by many, I am happy to say that it is not so alarming as expected.
September 3rd, —We had a good change last night, a gale of
wind sprung up from the S. W. and the ship had to bo hove to
for 30 hours, under the foretopsail and maintopsail, and let her
the wind ; wo had to be hatched down, the women
were in the bunks all day, it was not possible to sit at the tables,
we were assured by the Captain that we need not be alarmed, ho
had only one fear, one of the boats hung in the davits kept dip-
ping in the sea, he was afraid of it being stove in ; a sea came on
board and went down in the single men’s place, it alarmed one
man so that he sat down to die ! however, he survived and is all
right, most of us will remember this gale the rest of our lives.
September 4th, —Much better weather this morning, all hands
all right; a few had a good bath to-day, it only takes half a min-
ute to get a bath here, and most of ns get it in our turns, so that
we can’t boast.
September sth (Sunday,)—We were getting ready for muster
this morning but were stopped by a snowstorm, the deck was
covered with snow ; had several more during the day, and very
cold on deck, this was my turn for a ducking, I got my boots
and pockets full, had to change my clothes ; no service to-day,
too much noise with the boys, hatches on all day to keep out
the water.
September 6th, —Wo have seen the sea in its calmest and in its


fury, and we all must acknowledge the wonderful works of God,
for what man can set a boundary to this expanse of water ? and
we see it in its original beauty and might, for who can change
the appearance of its surface ? The wind more ahead to-day, so
we get water on deck, and several got wet. Mr. Jackson was
leaving the galley with some cakes, and his feet were washed from
under him, he got very wet, but saved his cakes all right. The
pigs and sheep got mixed to-day, they mauled a sheep so that it
had to be killed.
September 7th, —I think we are in a position now to know
what we ought to have brought as extras : —Married people with
four or five small children need not bring any flour, I brought
none and have not wanted any, but if I had brought 71bs. of
Baking Powder, Ist. of Currants, some jars of Jam, some Onions
and Cheese, we could have made ourselves very comfortable now,
for this is the part of the voyage that wo feel the want of extras ;
I find the single men are the worst off here, for they are in messes
of 10 and all hearty men, they need extra flour more than us
married men, and other articles as well; at the first part of the
voyage they could not eat all the allowance, and did not fetch it,
now, they could do with a little more, still they do not suffer
much, the single girls have the same allowance as the men, so
they are all right in this respect. Much better weather to-day,
we are getting some fresh air below, have had several day’s
winter now. A very startling occurrence happened, the Doctor
(who is an Irishman), last night was lying in his bunk reading,
when all at once the bunk fell down with him, he jumped up,
and said there had been an earthquake, but soon recovered, and
the carpenter set up his bed next day.
September Bth, —A very fine morning and showers during the
day, the weather with us now is like March with you, very
changeable.
September 9th, —Plenty of a fair wind to-day, the sea rather
lumpy, wet towards night.
September 10th, —A wet and foggy morning, wo saw a large
whale or two this morning, few of us have seen such a fish be-
fore, for they resemble a large boiler to see them come up to blow.
September 11th, —We can now count the degrees, and begin to
calculate how many days more. “Several bets are on as to the day,
for it will be a welcome one for us after seeing no land for so long;
we are now off the coast of Australia and days are getting longer
and we hope soon they will be warmer.
September 12th (Sunday),—The first dry and fine morning


for several days, so the muster took place on deck, and prayers
were read hy Mr. Carter, and a sermon in the evening by Mr.
Jackson.
September 13th, —A fine morning but not much wind,
nothing to see but sky and water, we begin to want something
to turn up.
September 14th, —We had a very good day’s sailing to-day.
The last sheep was killed yesterday, all this increases our hope
that a few more days, and we shall bo at our destination.
September 15th, —A nasty sea came at 1 a.m., it sounded like
a clap of thunder, which made the women give a very long sigh,
it only cracked a bull’s eye, we had a very strong wind all night.
September 16th, —I have spent nearly three days in bed, very
ill of a severe cold, this is not a particularly nice place for any-
body ill, for the boys make such a row; they have got to know
most of the sailors songs, and they sing them with all the hearti-
ness that youngsters usually do. Wo are now passing Van Die-
man’s land, so the next land will be the land for us.
September 17 th, —Everyday heightens our hopes, now only
about 1,200 miles more; we shall welcome the day when wo
sight land, for we have only just sighted a ship’s sail since Au-
gust Ist, and not seen land since we passed Madeira.
September 18th, —The disinfectants used here are mixed with
Lime, and the Constable put it on; most of them are farmers,
so they put it on as though they were liming a garden. They
got some rather stronger last night, and did the single men’s
place so that it made their eyes run, (and some of them have not
shed any tears since leaving home), they had to open the ports
and clean it up before they could sleep. The hatch was off to
day and a single man fell into the hold, he hurt his head and
was much shaken, he was not confined to his bed. Killed pig
No. 4 to-day.
September 19th (Sunday),—The usual roll call at 10.a.m. and
service afterwards, sermon by Mr. Goodhand, and in the evening
by Mr. Jackson. We arc getting fine weather now, more like
spring.
September 20th,—We had a very strong wind to-day but too
much ahead, had to steer rather out of course: we hope to land
this week.
September 21st, —We require our sea logs more to-day than
ever we did since we came on board; a very strong win 1 too
much ahead, and a cross sea, which made it very bad to go about
on deck; had to take in all the sails but three top sails and one jib.


September 22nd, —Tho wind is fair to-day only not mucb of it.
September 23rd, —Tlio ship is bring cleaned ready for going
into port; a fair wind to-day but light, and wo hope to land
on the 25th.
September 24th, —We were all pleased when the anchor was
taken on board when leaving home, but wo feel quite as pleased
to-day, now they have hung it at the cat-head, ready for bring-
ing up again; wo have a fair wind again to-day so are scrubbing
all the bunks and tables, and holy stoning the deck, so that wo
leave things respectable.
September 25th, —There was some excitement this morning,
could just see Mount Egmont, the first sign of our new home, al-
though 100 miles distant, its peak appeared above the clouds, and
the tip looked like snow, we had it calm most of the day, so made
little progress ; a better wind sprung up towards the afternoon
and was fair for our destination. We began to make preparations
for going on shore to-morrow.
September 2Gth, —There were plenty of early risers this morn-
ing, and we were close to the Sugar Loaf Rocks, but the wind
was not fair for ns to run in. The appearance of Mount Egmont
was splendid when the sun rose, and as far as we could judge
most of us liked the appearance of the country from the sea.
The ship brought up about 11 a.m., and the single girls and
women were tho first to land. They fetched us off in surf boats,
and tho women with children in arms were put into carts and
took right into the Depot, which stands on a high hill. It was
formerly the Barracks in the late Maori War, and has been
fitted up for Emigrants. Tho baggage was carted to tho Depot
free, and it was no small quantity ; we had not been there long
before we had a splendid feed of fresh meat and potatoes which
most of us enjoyed. Several of tho inhabitants came to meet us
and enquire after our health, and appeared astonished when we
told them that we were all well, and had not lost a single child, wo
only lost one emigrant, and he was not in good health to start.
A paper was signed by all the emigrants thanking the Captain
Doctor, and Mate of our ship, for their courtesy and kind
attention towards us during our voyage, for we had nothing
but civility from the sailors towards the children, and when we
parted, I have no doubt that their good wishes came from their
hearts, for they were visibly affected. A great many residents
paid us a visit during the afternoon, and I have no doubt that
they were reminded of old times; but we never heard any re-
marks of a light or disrespectful character towards us ; every-
thing about them had an English appearance; and we ha.l every


encouragement that after a short time we, shall be all right.,
appearance of a tpwn is very different from a town at' home, the
houses are all built of wood, and several are only one story high '
there are some very respectable shops which would not disgrace
the principal street in any town in England. The scenery round
New Plymouth is very grand, it is very hilly, and is backed by
Mount Egmont in its pure white; and other mountains, covered
with trees, give this place a very beautiful The roads
here have not had much hard stuff put on yet, but thay fire getting
plenty of stone broken for roads ; it is sandy and was jvery duSty
when we landed, which'reminded us of Grimsby in'dry weather.
September 27th, —Wo had a look round New Plymouth to-dajt, l
and could not find any signs of poverty, and we enquired for
the workhouse, the man 1 smiled and said wd hays’ none, and Wp
saw nothing in our ramble to dishearten us. ) The fashions here
are exactly the same as in England, only infixed with a little
Yankee. We get a civil answer to any question that we ask, We
are all invited to a public tea, in tho-Odd 'Fellows Hall to-morr6w
at 6 p.m., this invitation was given out to us at dinner! to-day.| :•
September 29th, —A public tea was given to the emigrants
who came out fiythe “Chile” this evening, in the ' Odd Fellows!
Hall, most of the ; principal settlers came to Welcome us and give
advice. We really had a splendid tea, and lam of opinion that
the treatment of the people herd' is such as we could not find jin
all England. 'NoW we shall have toy start for ourselves, 'and !
have no doubt that in a short 'time' we shall be able
good account of this country. I! shall! now conclude this Diary
with a verse or two that was often sung on our ship 1 ■ '
FAR AWAY.,
Where is now the merry party, I remember long ago—
Laughing round the happy fire-side, brightened by its ruddy glow.
Or in summer’s balmy evening, in the field amongst the hay ? 1
They have all dispersed and wandered, far away, far away.
Some have gone to lands far distant;'and with strangers made their home4-'
Some upon the world of waters, all their lives are forced to roam;
Some have gone from us for ever, longer here they might not stay,
They have reached a fairer region, far away, far away.
There are still some few remaining, who remind us of thd past, .
But they change as all things change ;here, nothing in this world can last j ■'
Years roll on and pass for ever, what is coming who can say ? '’
E’re this closes, many may be, far away, far away.

CONCLUDING REMARKS,
By W. M. BURTON.
V. 1 , I *. * ' ' ■
As from various causes [England's colonies are getting more
and xnoro known] it is not tp bpwondered, that New Zealand, hav-
ing an unrivalled climate,‘f rep institutions, and a vast extent of
fertile i land in pn uncultivated state, should hold a first posi-
tion-ini the- estimjation of such,' as feel it to be the call of duty to
“possessjthe lands.”
Emigration is jtoo important a step to be undertaken hastily
and withbut consideration, therefore: — \
Ist,-j—Consider whether yoh are doing'all that is right for you
to do for the interests of yourself and family, and if you decide


that you are not, then seek to know from those able to give infor-
mation, all that yon can about this important country, and do
not depend on second hand accounts, of what somebody heard
somebody else say.
Some people, who have never had any means of knowing, will
give their advice and opinion with as much confidence as if they
had spent their lives there.
2nd, —Remember that the Colonies are not places that will help
men on, but places where men can help themselves on. Avoid form-
ing in your minds anything like an exact picture of what the
country is like, or of how people succeed, for you can only do
this after living there, for from this cause, some, not finding it
exactly the same as they expected, are disappointed for a time; but
if your enquiries satisfy you, that it is a country favourable to the
enjoyment of life, health and freedom, and where an industrious
and prudent man, without having to deprive his family of re-
ligious and educational advantages, can reap a due reward for in-
dustry in the course of a few years, by the possession of a home-
stead, then lose no time in deciding and making preparation.
Those who emigrate to New Zealand after due thought and
enquiry, are mostly the more pushing, and enterprising part of
England’s population, and very naturally a good many do not
like to see such people leaving the country.
Old prejudices, natural affections, and self interest, often give
rise to much difficulty and opposition, to which the intending
emigrant is subject, but he who carries out his purpose wisely
and because he feels it a duty to his family, will find that the
world is wider than many people think, and that the bounty
and providence of the Almighty are to be found in all parts
of the globe.

'W’-A-TSOZhT’S
ANTI-CHOLERA MIXTURE
For Cholera, Diarrhoea, or Looseness of the Bowels.
Cholera generally begins with Looseness, of the Bowels, accompanied
with some degree of pain, which, however, is generally slight—in some cases
pain being wholly absent 5 and for some hours, and even days, this bowel com-
plaint may be so slight as to appear trifling, so that without a previous know-
ledge of the importance of the warning, it .might easily escape notice altogether.
As soon as these premonitory symptoms appear, recourse ought immediately
to be made to
WATSON’S ANTI-CHOLERA MIXTURE,
which has been prepared by the proprietor for above Thirty Years, and is the
same Preparation as was found most efficacious during the prevalence of the
Cholera in 1832-3, and subsequent periods. It ought to be well understood
that it is only in the first symptoms of the complaint that this Mixture will be
of service; in the more advanced stages no time ought* to be lost in sending
for medical advice.
The above Mixture has been seldom found to fail in curing cases of English
Cholera or Bowel Complaints, when taken in the first instance. Sufficient is
contained in each bottle for eight doses for an adult. Read the following
TESTIMONIALS.
Extract from Mr. H. Tomlinson’s Diary.
Addington Barracks, New Zealand, Sept. 18th, 1874.
“ I hare found “ Watson’s Family Pills ” and “ Cholera Mixture ” yery
useful, and wish I had brought more with me. No passenger should come
without them.” ;
Extract from a letter from Mbs, George Hill,
Doylston, New Zealand, Feh. 10th, 1875.
“I have much to be thankful for, as none of us ailed anything except
slight cases of Diarrhcea, hut one dose of “Watson’s Cholera Mixture”
was sufficient at a time to cure us. Whoeycr comes, ought not to leave
home without a good supply of “Watson’s Cholera Mixture” and “ Family
Pills”, and I hope if any of you come out next year, that you will
bring me a supply with you. I gave several doses of the Cholera Mixture
to other people, and in every case, it was far better than the doctor’s medi-
cine, the doctor tried to make some like it, but conld not; there was one
child that quitted nothing but blood, and I gave it a desert spoonful, and
it was better next morning, tell Mr. Watson this, he ought to preserve the
medicine, it is such a grand remedy, but you will be tired of medicine. I
like New Zealand; where we are it is like being at home.”

TESTIMONIALS.
Extract of a letter from Mr. Edward Merritt, Commercial Traveller,
8, Meadow St., Moss Side. Manchester, April 20th, 1875.
“ My Dear Sir, —Please send per post a box of your very valuable Pills
to my wife. She writes me this morning saying that but for them she
would have been obliged to call in the doctor. I enclose her address; let
them go by next post.”
Extract from a letter received from Mes. A. Revnolds, Auborn, near Lincoln.
To Mr. Watson, Laceby. May 28tb, 1874.
“Dear Sir, —Have the goodness to send a box of your Pills, at 2s. 9d. I have
taken your most valuable Pills, for many years, I do assure you that they
are greatly valued by me, and many others to whom I have recommended
them. I have been suffering from pain in my left side and under my shoulder,
and have been to many doctors, but your Pills have done me more good,
by far, than them all.”
Extract from a letter received from Me. F. Hogg, Draper, Helper, Derbyshire.
“To Mr. Watson, Laceby.—Dear Sir, —
“ Having met with a severe case or two of Tic, and knowing from past experi-
ence the efficaciousness of your Pills in that complaint, I wrote a short time
ago to you for a small box, which I presented to "the person affected, and
from which she experienced Immediate Relief, and is now, I believe, quite
free from it. She had a neighbour come in who was suffering from Rheum-
atism ; she gave her three of your Pills, and the next day she said that she
was so much better that she felt quite a new woman, and pronounced the
Pills to be “WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD!”
