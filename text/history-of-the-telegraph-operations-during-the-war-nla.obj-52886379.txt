HISTORY OF TELEGRAPH OPERATIONS.
1. ACTION OF THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.
The Postmaster-General had, on the declaration'of war, collected infor-
mation as to the telegraph material available in his depots and from firms
in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, He was prepared to help and co-operate
with the Army Telegraph Staff, if any were sent out from England.
By the 28th October the main lines of telegraph in Cape Colony had been
much damaged by the Boers, and preparations were made by the Postmaster-
General to forward men and stores to De Aar to await opportunity for their
repair. He also provided for the opening of a certain number of new offices
for the use of the Army. He undertook to repair all damaged Colonial lines',
but could undertake nothing beyond the- frontier. Materials for the repair
of the lines within the Republics was demanded from England by the
Imperial authorities, and the Postmaster-General undertook to take over,
within certain limits, all surplus stock on' the conclusion’of the war. 1 It was
then surmised that De Aar and Stormberg would be’ the advanced bases of
the Army, and that Naauwpoort would not be subject to much pressure.
When the Telegraph Division arrived from England preliminary arrange-
ments were entered into with the Postmaster-General whereby all telegraphic
work necessary within the “fighting area” (a somewhat vague term) or
beyond the frontier was to be done by the Telegraph Division, and the civil
staff restricted to operations in. districts within the Colony which were
reported “ safe.” This meant that the Telegraph Division was to effect such
temporary repairs to the Colonial lines as were necessitated by the military
situation, while the civil staff made them permanent later on. The Post-
master-General instructed his inspectors to give all possible help to the
military authorities. As a matter of fact, the civil staff rendered assistance
in certain instances within the fighting area, both on the Kimberley Railway,
and, at General Sir William Gatacre’s request, in the neighbourhood of
Sterkstroom and Dordrecht. The Postmaster-General on several occasions
supplied' instruments and stores on payment when the Telegraph Division
ran short. ;
On the 15th November one of the Colonial wires north of De Aar was
handed over to the military for use as occasion might suggest for the military
offices. De Aar was made the handing over office between the Civil and
' Military Administrations. It was agreed that the Army Telegraphs should
be treated as one of the signatories of the South African Telegraph Con-
: vention of 1886, retaining as revenue all money received for private telegrams
at military offices which were authorised to transmit paid work, and even
at those within the Colony where there were no existing postal telegraph
offices. The Army Telegraphs were to have;the use of a portion of the
Kimberley Telegraph Office when the relief took place (which was then
thought to be imminent). It was also promised that 20 or 30 Dutch-speaking
operators should be handed over to the Army Telegraphs when the frontier
was crossed, but at this time the Postmaster-General had no idea of the
immense increase that would take place in the traffic over his lines. When
the frontier was crossed he had to be released from his engagement for fear
of a collapse in his system.
Subsequently, as the military operations developed, more Colonial wires
were lent to the Army Telegraphs. Eventually they had for their own
exclusive use four wires between De Aar and Modder River, three front
Modder to Kimberley, three thence to Mafeking, one from De Aar to
Naauwpoort, one from Naauwpoort via Stormberg to Bethulie, and two from
Naauwpoort to Norvals Pont.
1899.
2. ARRIVAL OF TELEGRAPH DIVISION.
The Telegraph Division- arrived at Cape Town at 2 p.m. on the 12th
November, under the commahd of Captain E. G. Godfrey-Eaussett. It con-
sisted of four sections and a'Headquarters, with 60 miles of air line, 32 miles
ACS ;25137, ; 500,—8/03*:, 'Wt. 10204. E.&S- 2


of cable, and 12 offices. The sections were commanded by Lieutenants J. P.
Moir, R. J. Jelf, 2nd Lieutenants E. 0. Henrici and H. L. Mackworth.
Lieutenant A. Baunerman was in charge of the clearing house. Major A. E.
Wrottesley had been appointed Director of Telegraphs, but owing to his
unfortunate death by drowning during the passage out, the Telegraph
Division arrived without a Director. Major E. C. Heath, who had made
many of the preliminary arrangements with the Postmaster-General, was on
the 3rd of November appointed Acting Director, pending the arrival of
Lieutenant-Colonel R. L. Hippisley, who was named to succeed Major
Wrottesley.
By Major Wrottesley’s foresight two complete sets of Wheatstone’s
automatic fast speed instruments, and extra clerks to work them, were
included in the equipment and personnel of the Telegraph Division. They
proved absolutely invaluable. Without them it would have been impossible
to cope with the heavy traffic which was maintained throughout the
campaign. The reserve telegraph equipment of the First Army Corps,
consisting of 195 miles of air line, 128 miles of cable, and 32 offices, arrived
soon after. Lieutenant W. 0. Macfie, then employed on general duties in
the Cape Command, was attached to the Telegraph Division for duty, and
took charge of the Wheatstone apparatus, Lieut.-Colonel Hippisley landed
on the 10th of December.
The disembarkation was effected, and all the vehicles and stores loaded on
trucks for transport by rail by 2.30 p.m. on the 13th, by dint of working
throughout the night on the 12th. An advanced party left for De Aar on
the 13th, and the main body of the Telegraph Division on the 14th.
Qn arrival at De Aar horses, mules, and ox transport were drawn from the
Remount and Transport Departments, oxen being provided for the general
service wagons. It may here be incidentally remarked that oxen are quite
unsuited for the Telegraph Division general service wagons. These wagons
are required for technical purposes, and are not in any sense baggage
wagons. They should be drawn by horses or mules. This was eventually
arranged for.
As it was likely that De Aar would remain the advanced base for some
time, it was decided to form a store there of all the reserve equipment, and to
establish the clearing house near the stores. Captain Godfrey Faussett
obtained the use of an empty cottage belonging to the Cape Government
Railways for offices, and pitched four marquees for warehousing purposes.
Lieutenant Bannerman had been instructed, to purchase a corrugated iron
building of suitable size for the clearing house, which qn its arrival from
Cape Town was erected alongside the cottage. The Cape Government
Railways laid a siding into the stores compound to facilitate the despatch of
equipment by rail.
3. ADVANCE FROM DE AAR TO MODDER RIVER.
{Diagram 1.)
The first technical work that was undertaken by the Telegraph Division
was the formation at De Aar of a telephone system to the outposts, &g. It
consisted of seven branches connected to an exchange. The switchboard was
placed in a room at the railway station adjoining the postal telegraph office.
This room afterwards developed into the military telegraph office, and.
subsequently became a large and busy centre. A telephone was also put up
for the railway between the night inspector’s office and the signal box.
The Ist Division, under Lord Methuen, at this time had its Headquarters
at Orange River, and expected daily to advance northward. Lieutenant Moir
was therefore despatched there with his section, with instructions to
accompany the division to make such temporary repairs to the wires as time
permitted during the advance, and to open offices as required. He arrived
at Orange River on the night of the IBtli November, and the following day
opened Orange River Telegraph Office on one of the permanent lines to
De Aar.
The advance northward commenced on the 21st November. The per-
manent line of telegraphs had been completely wrecked in many places.
The gaps were bridged by air line. The construction of air line across the


veldt in South Africa is difficult. There is in most places very little soil.
Hard rock is encountered a few inches below the surface, requiring the
expenditure of much energy in making suitable holes for the poles, and
considerably damaging the jumpers. Wooden stay-pegs are useless in such
ground.
An office was opened at Witteputs on the 21st, at Belmont on the 23rd, at
Graspan on the 25th, at Enslin on the 26th, at Klokfontein on the 27th,
and at Modder River on the 28th. Honeynestkloof was opened on the
10th December. All these offices remained open for some months.
The traffic along the telegraphs to De Aar was very heavy, for in addition
to the work necessitated by the needs of the Army, large batches of messages
arrived periodically by despatch riders from Kimberley. The Wheatstone
apparatus was installed at Modder on the 6th December on a through line to
De Aar.
In order to relieve Lieutenant Moir of anxiety about the lines and offices
in his rear, and to free him for work at the front, Lieutenant Henrici was
detailed, on the 21st November, to take over and maintain in working order
the offices between De Aar and the front. The Boers made a raid on the
line on the 7th December at Enslin, and communication to Modder River
was stopped for a day and a half.
Telephone exchanges were established to the outposts both at Orange
River and Modder; each of these had six branches.
On the 10th December a temporary line was run from Modder River
towards the Magersfontein position. It remained working until the 12th,
and was used during the battle. The frontal attack having failed, there was
a proposition to make a turning movement on Jacobsdal, and a spur was run
from the Magersfontein line over the Modder in preparation for an advance
in that direction, which, however, was not made.
On the Ist January a cable was laid from- Modder River to Valschfontein
miles), to serve the Cavalry Brigade, who had marched there on an
expedition westwards from Belmont.
This wire was on the 2nd extended to Doornlaagte by Lieutenant Moir, and
on the 3rd to Koodoesberg Drift. On the sth another cable was run from
Orange River Station to Marks Drift. General Babington wrote to thank
Lieutenant Moir for the help he had afforded to the conduct of the operations.
On the 31st December a column, under Colonel Pilcher, started from
Belmont to the west; Lieutenant Henrici was detailed to accompany it. This
force followed the route of the Griquatown telegraph line, and was kept in
communication by tee-ing a vibrator on the permanent wire at various places.
Cook’s Farm, Thornhill, was the first place reached, then Rooipan, St. Clair,
and finally Douglas (2nd January). Lieutenant Henrici received Colonel
Pilcher’s thanks for the great use the telegraph had been to him.
On the 13th January a line was put up from Orange River to Zoutpans
Drift, then an important outpost commanding one of the few practicable
drifts over the River Orange, by which the Boers could threaten our
communications in rear.
Colonel Alderson’s column started from De Aar to the west on the
22nd January along the Prieska line, and was provided with a mounted
telegraphist to keep him in touch with De Aar.
4. OPERATIONS AT RENSBURG.
{Diagram 1.)
On the 26th November General French wired to Cape Town, asking that"
some of the Telegraph Division should be sent to him at Naauwpoort to facilitate
the operations which he was about to make in the direction of Colesberg.
Captain Godfrey-Faussett having been directed to communicate with General
French, went to Naauwpoort, and had a consultation with him, which resulted
in Lieutenant Mackworth’s section being sent from De Aar to report to
General French.
There were four wires along the railway from Naauwpoort as far as Colesburg
Junction. Their condition was unknown, but they wore believed to be intact
to Arundel.
A 3

Two squadrons of, cavalry left Naauwpoort on t the Ist December, accompanied,
by a cable ,detachment, and halted 2 miles from Arundel, where, an office
was'opened, the wires proving to be in good order. They were to haye been
followed by further troops the following day, but the advance was counter-
ordered, so the two squadrons returned to Naauwpoort with the cable cart, and
the Bpers promptly cut the wires.
The real advance took place on the 16th December, when a vibrator circuit
was set to worjc between Naauwpoort and Arundel. This, was replaced by
single-current circuit on the 17th, and Tweedale opened as intermediate.
Eenshurg was opened on the 30th December, and remained the Headquarters
of General French’s Command until he moved to Enslin for the march to
Bloemfontein.
, A night march from Eensburg took place on the Ist January, for which a
cable was laid to a place called Waterhole. It was extended to Porter’s Hill
on the 3rd, and another run to Maeder’s Farm.
General French was now enveloping the Boer position in front of Colesburg,
and to enable him to efficiently control his forces, which were extended along
a curved front of 33 miles, a number of telegraph offices were opened by
means of; cable between the Ist and the 13th January, some of which were
replaced by air lines.
These offices were Kloof, the top of Coleskop, the bottom of Coleskop,
Porter’s Hill, Maeder’s Farm, Klinger’s Farm, Hopkirk, MacOracken’s Hill,
Potfonteini and Kleinfontein. General French conducted operations from
the top of Coleskop, from which an excellent view could be obtained of the
positions, both Boer and British. It would have been almost impossible to
havei hejd the positions without the telegraph system. General French said
as mpch.
The Cavalry Division left Eensburg for Enslin on the 10th February, and
the majority of the above were then closed, leaving open Kloof, Maeder’s Farm,
Porter’s Hill, and Slinger’s Farm, which were still to continue occupied. The
British retired on Arundel later, when the remainder and Eensburg'were
closed.
5. PERMANENT LINE PARTY.
'Captain J; S. Fowler and 2nd Lieutenant A. W. Hepper, with 50 line-
men and 50 clerks, arrived at Cape Town on the 21st December, Captain
■Fowler proceeded to organise working parties with native labour, and tools
for the'reconstructidn of the destroyed permanent lines, on both sides oL the
frontier. He took over the lines and offices between De Aar and Modder
Eiver, and between Naauwport and Eensburg, thus freeing the telegraph
sections for further work afield.
6. WITHDRAWAL OF SECTION TO NATAL.
Oh the 23rd December Lieutenant Jelf’s section left : De Aar for Natal,
having been wired for by. General Sir Eedvers Duller. Only three sections
remained within ’ the Cape Command to do all the work required for Lord
Eoberts’ force. As they were entirely inadequate, the War Office were
requested to send out three more, which arrived on the’ 23rd March.
7. LORD ROBERTS’ MARCH TO BLOEMFONTEIN.
(Diagram 2.)
On preparations being made for , the march across the Free State to
Bloemfontein, a concentration of the sections of the Telegraph Division was
effected at Enslin, Lieutenant Mackworth's section being brought there from
Eensburg., ~
‘ Captain Godfroy-Faussett was in executive charge of the telegraphic arrange-
ments for the march. It was commenced on the 11th February, with
100 miles of air line and 70 miles of cable. A convoy of 10 buck wagons
accompanied, the Telegraph Division, carrying the material which, was .to
replenish the technical vehicles.


The march of the Infantry Division was preceded :, by ; the'cavalry,'Who
reached Ramdam oh the 11th, being kept in communication * by'cable with
Enslin; The Commander-in-Chief arrived at Ramdam'on the 12th, and the
•cavalry marched to De-' Kiels Drift. As the Army Headquarters advanced
the cable was replaced by air line.
The' Cavalry Division received orders ait De Kiels Drift to proceed at Once
to the relief of Kimberley. It started ion the 13th, and was followed all the
way into Kimberley by * Lieutenant Moir with-cable, a distance of about
45 -miles. This ■ long line worked until ■it was - crossed by General Cronje’s
army in their flight from Magersfontein. They cut great pieces out of it,
some of which were found on the prisoners at Paardeberg, who had kept
them as trophies of-war.
1 [ The Army Headquarters reached Waterval Drift, on the Riet River, on the
13th, and the air line was completed to that place by 3 p.mi The : infantry
advanced to Wegdraai Drift in the night, followed by cable, and air-line was
run there on the following morning. A cable was laid from Wegdraai to
Randeval Drift,-on the Modder' River,'where it was joined to ! tlie Kimberley
cable, cutting out the portion' between there ’ and De Kiels Drift, which had
become broken. Good touch was, kept with General French until he got
into Kimberley. The cable to Randeval Drift: was replaced by air line on
the 15 th.
f On the 16th' the Headquarters moved' into Jacobsdal, and the telegraph
office Was opened and worked to Enslin. A direct air line to Modder River
office was run on the same day to cut out the one by the roundabout route to
Enslin. .
Lord Roberts remained at Jacobsdal until the 19th, during which‘time the
telegraph had been extended to Klipdrift and Paardeberg, at both of which
places offices were opened. A cable was run into the Paardeberg battlefield,
giving direct-communication between the : Commander-in-Chief and" Lord
Kitchener during the progress ’of the fight. ; A. direct 1 air line was put
up between Randeval and Jacobsdal, to cut out the 'more circuitous one via
Wegdraai, which was liable ‘at any moment to interruption by the Boers.
Lord Roberts arrived at Paardeberg oh the 19th February, and remained till
the Ist March, waiting for the inevitable surrender of General Oronje.
Up to this time the Headquarters Office had been worked with double-
current duplex apparatus.. Jacobsdal and Klipdrift, which were kept open
as linemen's-stations, ‘coining in periodically as double-current simplex. As
-the traffic on the line was very heavy, it was decided to take advantage of
the halt at Paardeberg to get a quadruplex apparatus up from Modder River.
This arrived on the 26th February. A convoy containing 30 miles additional
air line material also joined at Paardeberg. The air j line’Was extended to
Koodoesrand Drift, in preparation for a further advance.'
The move from Paardeberg took place on the Ist March, when the Head-
quarters were removed to Osfontein, and remained there till the 7th. On
this day three cable lines were laid in connection with thb indVement of three
parallel columns of troops which advanced the retiring Boers. The
cavalry, on the left, were followed for 26 miles from Koodoesrand Drift; a
balloon on the extreme left was kept in touch'from'the same point; while
.Lord Roberts,'who advanced ■ from Osfentein (then in ' connection by air- line
with Koodoesrand Drift), was enabled to receive reports by a third line from
Osfontein.
At midday on the 7th, orders were received to shift the office from
Osfontein to Poplar Grove, which was effected by means of the,cable to the
iballoon, and replaced by air line as far as Makauw’s Drift that evening and
completed early next morning. On the Bth a cable was laid for the cavalry
along the River Modder.
•' The air line to Modder River gave considerable trouble at first, partly from
lightning, but chiefly owing to the reckless driving of the provision convoys,
which moved at night, and were guided by the telegraph -line, Uo matter how
far from the usual track it had been placed. A : party had been sent back to
strengthen it and guard the poles in exposed places by heaps of stones, and
further to alter certain portions. ■ After this’it stood better, but it was still
very dependent on the incessant exertions of 'the linemen -left at Jacobsdal
and Klipdrift. To secure the line and protect the linemen small-infantry
garrisons had beenuleft. behind at these places. l ; It was, therefore;' with a
A 4


feeling of consternation that Lord Roberts’ announcement was received on
the 9th, that he intended to withdraw these garrisons, not considering it safe
to leave them, and that the linemen must be called in, the offices closed, and
the line left to take its chance. Fortune favoured this decision, however, for,
with the exception of a break which occurred on entering Bloemfontein, the
line continued to work satisfactorily. This break was near enough to be
repaired from Bloemfontein, but it stopped the line at a very critical moment.
To minimise as far as possible the risk of interruption, a party was sent
through from Jacobsdal to Kimberley to restore the permanent line between
those places, so as to cut out the Jacobsdal-Modder section of the air line.
On the 10th the line was through to Driefontein, on the 11th to Asvogel
Kop, and on the 12th to Ferreira Farm, at which places the Headquarter
Staff remained for the night. On the 13th Bloemfontein was entered, and
the Postal and Railway Telegraph Offices were seized.
8. RESTORATION OF LINES TO KIMBERLEY, NORVALSPONT,
AND BETHULIE.
{Diagram 3.)
Immediately after Kimberley bad been relieved by the action of General
French’s cavalry, steps were taken by Captain Fowler, assisted by Lieutenant
Hepper, to restore the broken line between Modder River and Kimberley.
By the 20th February three wires were completed, and Kimberley Office
permanently re-opened.
Having done what was necessary on the Kimberley side, Captain Fowler
and his party went round to the Naauwpoort side, to get the wires restored
up to Norvalspont and Bethulie Bridge. Both of these bridges had been
destroyed, and it was uncertain at first which would be repaired first, but it
was extremely urgent to get telegraphic communication with Bloemfontein
by one route or other before the air-line from Modder failed.
The Boers retired from the neighbourhood of Colesberg and Norvalspont
as General Clements advanced, and Rensburg, Plowman’s Siding, Colesberg
Junction, Colesberg Town, Joubert’s Siding, Oorlogs, Actertang, Van Zyls,
and Norvals Pont were opened up in succession, by the 15th March.
On the Bethulie side, following Generals Knox and Sir William Gatacre,
Steynsburg, Merton Siding, Stormberg, Burghersdorp, Knapdaar, and Bethulie
Bridge were restored to communication by the 13th, and Bethulie Station
and Springfontein, in the Free State, by the 16th March. On the 17th
Bloemfontein was working to Norvals Pont, thus relieving the air line to
Jacobsdal, which did not finally stop working till the 21st, having been
nine days without attention.
9. OPERATIONS IN THE PREE STATE.
{Diagram 3.)
After the occupation of Bloemfontein attention was directed in the first
instance to the establishment of a direct line to Kimberley via Boshof.
Boshof was then in the occupation of the British troops, and was in tele-
graphic communication with Kimberley, but the line to Bloemfontein had
been cut by the Boers. -
A break near Bloemfontein was repaired on the 14th March, but the
line being still unworkable Lieutenant Mackworth and Serjeant Cadwell
volunteered to ride through it to Boshof. It was a dangerous ride, as the
country through which they had to pass had not yet been touched by our
troops, and was known to contain many hostile Boers. Having received
Lord Roberts’ sanction, they started at noon on the I4th. About sunset they
came upon a party of Boers, and were fortunate in remaining hidden from
them, until dark. One of their horses had become too exhausted to go
further, but they succeeded in capturing one of the Boers’ horses under cover
of the darkness, and went on with it into Boshof, where they arrived about
10 o’clock the following morning.
Having restored communication with Boshof and Kimberley, Lieutenant
Mackworth returned with an escort to Bloemfontein, bringing with him a set
8


of Wheatstone apparatus which, had been' sent to Boshof via Kimberley from
De Aar. He arrived at Bloemfontein on the 20th.
The Boshof line remained workable until the 22nd, when it was again cut
by the Boers. The enemy were known to be laagered under the wire in the
neighbourhood of Abrahamskraal, about 30 miles from Bloemfontein. As
Lord Roberts found it impracticable to send a force to dislodge them, the
line remained useless for telegraphic purposes for some time. A circuit
was made up to Kimberley via Naauwpoort and De Aar, and this remained the
principal outlet for the work from Bloemfontein for many weeks. The
Postmaster-General was unable to deal with the traffic at either Naauwpoort
or De Aar, so Kimberley had to be made the handing over station between the
Army Telegraph and the Colonial Administration.
It now became necessary to open up communication with the southern
towns of the Free State which were. in the occupation of the British. The
telegraph lines had been hardly touched by the Boers, short gaps at Spring-
fontein and Donkerpoort being the only damage. A lineman who accompanied
General Clements in his advance from Norvals Pont via Phillippolis and
Pauresmith into the south-west of the Free State, had restored the broken
line between those places and Colesberg, and the Fauresmith-Bdenburg line
being intact, the three towns, as well as Jagersfontein, were in touch with
Bloemfontein directly Edenburg was opened. This latter was done on the
15th, March, two days after the arrival of the troops at Bloemfontein. On
the 14th Boers were still at Edenburg.
On the 16th Springfontein was opened, and Bethulie Station having been
reached by Captain Fowler from the south, direct communication was
established between Bloemfontein and the Colony. On the following day
the wires were working to Norvals Pont, thus affording another outlet.
There were three wires along the railway between Bloemfontein and
Norvals Pont, two of which were required by the Director of Railways for
working the line. Only one was available for the Army Telegraph. In
order, therefore, fully to utilise the three southern outlets (Bethulie, Norvals
Pont, and Colesberg), it became desirable to open up the road line - via
Reddersburg. Accordingly Captain Godfrey-Faussett started with an escort
from Bloemfontein on the 19th March to do this. He reached Reddersburg
the same day, partly by train and partly by march. The lines were found
intact, and the office opened. The direct line from Edenburg to Bethulie
was faulty, and it was unsafe to go through it on account of the enemy, but
shortly afterwards it was put in order by a native lineman. There were then
three circuits south from Bloemfontein, one direct along the railway to
Norvals Pont and Naauwpoort, one via Reddersburg, Edenburg, and Faure-
smith to Colesberg, and one via Reddersburg, Edenburg and Bethulie to
Burghersdorp.
By using the Edenburg-Pauresmith wire for one of these-through circuits,
Phillippolis, Fauresmith, and Jagersfontein were deprived of direct com-
munication with Bloemfontein. -It was, therefore, decided to erect an
auxiliary air line between Edenburg and Fauresmith which could be utilised
for this purpose. Lieutenant Henrici, after having recovered about 30 miles
of the now discarded air line to Jacobsdal, went on the 30th March to
Edenburg to carry this out, and by the 2nd April had opened Jagersfontein
and Fauresmith offices on the new line.
The country in the neighbourhood of Edenburg, both east and west of the
railway, remained for some time in a state of unrest, and though the railway
line at first remained untouched, Reddersburg, Jagersfontein, and Fauresmith
more than once were evacuated and reoccupied, and these offices were
periodically closed. The Boers, however, did not at that time touch the
lines, which, neglecting minor interruptions, remained useful to the Army for
many months. It was, however, not considered advisable to send important
despatches at key speed via Reddersburg for fear of the enemy tapping them ;
sending by Wheatstone automatic apparatus presented no danger in this
respect, so as the railway wire was wanted for intermediate offices, one of
the Reddersburg wires was made the through circuit, and it was prolonged
via Phillippolis to Naauwpoort, and thence to De Aar and Kimberley. The

Fauresmith-Jacobsdal line would, have afforded a more direct route, but it
had been destroyed by Boers in the neighbourhood of Koffiefontein. There
was then no opportunity for its repair.
10. LORD KITCHENER’S PRIESKA EXPEDITION.
{Diagram 15.)
On the 15th of March Lord Kitchener left De Aar with an expedition
against the Colonial rebels near Prieska. He was accompanied by Lieutenant
Bannerman and a telegraph detachment with 20 miles of air line and 12
miles of cable. The route proceeded generally along the permanent line to
Prieska.
On the 16th a cable, subsequently replaced by air line, was run from the
Post Office at Houwater into Lord Kitchener’s camp, and on the 17th ,the
column. reached Omdraaisvlei, where the wires were found much
They were, however, soon put right so far as to enable them to work a
vibrator to Britstown, which was later in the day changed to a Morse
instrument;
The column remained at Omdraaisvlei on the 18th. A r telephone receiver
was fixed on the Prieska line, and after listening all day a man was heard
calling Kenhardt. There was just enough current to work a relay, and after
some trouble they got into conversation with Prieska. He asked various
questions under the impression he was talking to Kenhardt, and finally sent
an important message in Dutch to Steenkamp, their Commandant. Some
time was spent in concocting an answer in Dutch, which was sent with
success.' , ' ~■! '■ '
On the 19th the column marched to Doornbergfontein, where again a cablb
was laid into the camp, and on the 20th Prieska was captured.
The column returned to De Aar by the same route, and used the same
offices, which had been kept open all the time. They reached De Aar on the
27th March.
11. FIRST MARCH TO THABA ’NCHU.
(,Diagram 3.)
On the 18th of March General French and the Cavalry Division left Bloem-
fontein to clear the country eastwards as far as Thaba ’Nchu. He was
accompanied by Lieutenant Moir and a cable detachment, who opened
temporary offices at Springfield Dam, Boesman’s Kop, Cameron’s Farm, and
Thaba ’Nchu. The cable was repeatedly cut, and communication was only
maintained by the efforts of many linemen sent out from both ends. t
This column returned to Bloemfontein on the'3lst, a portion of it being
surprised at Sannahs Post. Serjeant Shergold, who was in charge of the
the reeling-up party, was captured, with his detachment and cable cart, and
taken prisoner to,.Pretoria. The cart was subsequently found in pieces at
Winburg, and the instruments at Harrismith. The unrecovered portion of
the cable was used for communication to Springfield, where a military post
had been established. It was replaced by an air line on the 7th April, which
was extended to Sannahs Post on the 26th April, and which remained in use
till the; conclusion of hostilities.
12. OPERATIONS OF THIRD AND EIGHTH DIVISIONS AT
DEWETSDORP.
(Diagram 3.)
! On the 10th April it was decided to detach a section of the Telegraph
Division for duty with the 3rd Division, which was then at Reddersburg, it
being believed that important operations would take place from there.
Lieutenant Mackworth had been with this division since the 25th March
with only a lew men, with the object of opening Dewetsdorp and Wepener,
but those towns did not fall into British hands so soon as was expected. As
Lieutenant: Mackworth was required back at Bloemfontein to take charge of
the cable: section: which;was then in the process of (formation, Lieutenant Moir


Was Kent to relieve him. This officer and his section arrived 1 at Reddersburg
on the 18 th April.
ThS permanent line to Dewetsdorp still remained practically intact. The
3rd Division, reinforced later by the Bth, marched towards Dewetsdorp, but
did not at first follow the telegraph lind. Lieutenant Moir wrfs therefore
obliged to run a cable to the first halting place, Rosdndal, 8 milds from
Beddefsburg.
The next march was to Obrlogspobrt, and the third to ‘Wakkersiroom.
Here a cable was run from the permanent. line into the 3rd Division Camp,
and another to a camp a mile away.
On the 25th April the Boers evacuated their position at Dewetsdorp, and
the British troops marched in. The office was opened, and after a break in
the line was repaired, Bloemfontein was in communication.
On the 26th, Bietput, on the Thaba ’Nchu line, was reached; and a temporary
office established, and on the following day the troops arrived atTfiaba ’Nchu.
The Thaba ’Nchu-Dewetsdorp line was found to be in working order, giving
access to the Army Headquarters at Bloemfontein.
13. MARCH OF CAVALRY AND 11TH DIVISIONS TO
DEWETSDORP.
{Diagram 3.)
While the. march to Dewetsdorp alluded 1 to in the foregoing paragraph was
in progress the Cavalry Division marched from Bloemfontein in l a south-
easterly direction for the purpose of cutting off the Boers’ retreat from
Dewetsdorp. .It was followed by the 11th Division, under General Pole-
Dare w, from Springfield. Lieutenant Mackworth was instructed to follow the
latter with a cable line. This line was started on the 23rd April. It reached
Tweede Geluk that night, Grootfontein on the 24th, and the Thaba ’Nchu lino
where it crosses the Modder River on the 25th. Temporary offices were
opened at these places.
The Cavalry Division on reaching the Modder came into touch with
permanent telegraph system re-established by Lieutenant Moir, and the cable
line was no longer required. The 11th Division returned to Bloemfontein'on
the , 26th April, and the cable was reeled up behind them, keeping up
communication satisfactorily all the time.
i It was of course not known originally how long this cable might have been
required, and the, first portion of it was replaced .by a direct air line from
Bloemfontein on the 23rd. The air line was run to a place called Langdon’s
Farm. This was an outpost from Bloemfontein, and air office was opened
there which remained in use some time-after the cable was recovered,
(29.4.00).
j Lieutenant Mackworth accompanied the Cavalry Division into* Thaba ’Nchu.
He opened the telegraph office there, and returned to Bloemfontein On the
20th April.
14. THE ARRIVAL OF THREE EXTRA SECTIONS.
The three extra sections wired for on the 31st January arrived at Cape
Town on the 23rd March, and proceeded to De Aar. The officers with them
were Captain H. B. H. Wright, Lieutenant 0. T, O’K. Wobber. and Lieutenant
L, A. Sherrard. There was a delay in their mobilisation owing to t an
outbreak of glanders amongst mules sent from Stellenbosch for them.
Captain Wright, Lieutenant Sherrard, and, two sections proceeded to
Kimberley, and one to Bloemfontein under Lieutenant Webber.
15. RE-ORGANISATION OF TELEGRAPH DIVISION.
When Lieutenant Webber’s section arrived at Bloemfontein on the 24th
April, a re-organisation of the Telegraph Division into one cable section and
three air-line sectipns, which had been partially effected previous to the
march to Dewetsdorp and Thaba ’Nchu, was completed as far as it was possible
to dp so, without the two Second Army . Corps’ reserve cable, carts, which had
not then arrived from England.
B 2


Experience had shown the necessity of a cable section which should be
able to run long cable lines without borrowing from and so disorganising the
remaining sections. At the same time the personnel of the air-line sections
was increased so as to comprise two working detachments instead of one, as
the rate of erection with only one detachment was insufficient to make a
section working alone capable of keeping up with infantry during a day’s
march. This increase was effected partly by the aid of drafts from Eoyal
Engineer companies and partly by the removal of the air-line detachment
from the fourth section.
16. ADVANCE NORTHWARD FROM KIMBERLEY.
x (Diagram 4.)
On Captain Wright’s arrival he was placed in charge of the lines and
offices from De Aar to Kimberley, thus relieving Captain Fowler of
responsibility for these distant stations, which owing to the irregularity of
the railway service and the time taken in travelling it was difficult for him
to do justice to in addition to his work elsewhere. Captain Wright was also
instructed to arrange for all extensions required north of Kimberley, and
in particular to prepare for a march that the Ist Division, under Lord
Methuen, was about to make from Kimberley across the Free State to
Hoopstad. Lieutenant Macfie, who was at Boshof, was placed in command
of the second section, and Lieutenant D. S. Maclnnes was detailed to assist
Captain Wright as second in command.
Lieutenant Maclnnes had, soon after the relief of Kimberley, been put in
charge of such telegraphic arrangements as it had been possible to make with
the little material available for Lord Methuen’s Command. He had been
placed at the disposal of the Director of Telegraphs as soon as his services
could be spared by Colonel Kekewich, and had Lieutenant Macfie to assist
him. He restored communication with Dronfield, Content Siding, and
Warrenton*, and opened offices at these places on the 26th March.
Lieutenant Maclnnes was desired by Lord Methuen to open up the Belmont,
Douglas, Campbell, and Griquatown circuit, and to make a connection with
it from Schmidt’s Drift, on the Yaal Eiver, west of Kimberley, in order to
afford communication to a force which Lord Methuen was despatching in
that direction. This expedition started on the 24th March, but on the
following day Lord Methuen found it necessary to change the route,
and directed that the party under Lieutenant Maclnnes should return to
Kimberley. . ’
On the sth April Lieutenant Maclnnes proceeded to Boshof to put up an
air line for a force that was proceeding north-east. This column started on
the 6th, and reached Zwartzkcppiefontein, 10 miles from Boshof, where an
office was established. This office remained open until the 20th April, when
the line was reeled up to Boshof.
During this time Lieutenant Macfie made two attempts with escort to get
the Bloemfontein wire put in order, but was unable to penetrate further than
about 25 miles. It is doubtful whether this line would have been long spared
by. the Boers, even if the attempts made from both ends to repair it had been
successful, because it was then not practicable to clear the country of the
enemy. In order, however, that Bloemfontein should be able fully to utilise
it for through traffic to Kimberley when it did come right, a second wire from
Kimberley to Boshof was put up by Lieutenant Maclnnes (16th to 20th April)
to carry the local work from Boshof and the north-east.
Lieutenant Sherrard’s section arrived at Kimberley on the 22nd April, and
Captain Wright, having at last received his complement of mules, arrived
there on the 24th with the other section. Lieutenant Macfie returned from
Boshof on the same day to take charge of it.
After a consultation by telephone between Lord Methuen at Boshof and
Captain Wright, it was decided by the former that Lieutenant Sherrard’s
seccion should join the Ist Division at Boshof, and that Lieutenant Macfie’s
section should be attached to the 10th Division, under General Hunter.
Lieutenant Maclnnes was to remain with the Ist Division and to be in charge
of telegraphic operations on that side, while Captain Wright superintended
those of the 10th Division.


Captain "Wright, with Lieutenant Macfie and his section, proceeded to join
the 10th Division at Windsorton Road Station on the 2nd May, and opened
an office there, at Windsorton Drift, and also at Windsorton Village.
Lieutenant Macfie crossed the Yaal with General Hunter on the 4th, reaching
a point 10 miles beyond the river. There he opened an office on a cable line.
Captain Wright with the remainder proceeded to Warrenton.
On the sth May Lieutenant Macfie ran a cable line to Rooidam, and sent
several messages during the action at that place. The next day he followed
General Hunter into Warrenton Village, laying 22 miles of cable, which
worked well throughout the day. He personally received the thanks of the
General for the success of the two days’ operations.
On the 6th May the artillery bombarded the Fourteen Streams position. A.
balloon ascended to make observations, and was connected by bare wire with
Warrenton Village and the batteries, four miles in all; telephones were fixed
and worked very satisfactorily. A .similar operation was carried out the
next day.
Fourteen Streams was occupied on the 7th May, and the telegraph office
opened on an air line, which was replaced by the permanent line on the
following day.
On the 15th May Lieutenant Macfie left Fourteen Streams with the 10th
Division for Christiana, and reached Dreiweg, 15 miles from Fourteen Streams,
that day. An office was opened there on a cable line. On the 16th the
column reached a point 3 miles west of Christiana, and another office was
opened. The section then returned to Fourteen Streams. On the 19th,
Phokwani office, 23 miles north of Fourteen Streams, was opened; on the
20th, Taungs; on the 22nd, Driehartz; on the 23rd, Brussels Siding; and
on the 23rd, Vryburg.
During this period a civilian working party was sent from Fourteen Streams
to repair the Jacobsdal-Koffiefontein-Fauresmith line, which, as before
mentioned, had been considerably damaged by the Boers during the action at
Watervaldrift on the 14th and 15th February. This line was restored to
working order on the Ist June, giving Bloemfontein a fairly direct wire to
Kimberley,
On the 26th May Doornbult and Devondale Sidings, on the Mafeking
Railway, were connected to Vryburg, and on the 29th an office was opened
at Maribogo Pan.
General Hunter now intended to leave the railway and strike across the
Transvaal to Lichtenburg, and perhaps beyond. Mafeking had been relieved,
and there was no necessity for a further march north. It was arranged to
divert one of the main line wires at Maribogo to Geysdorp and Barberspan
by air line, and join on at the latter place to the Schweizer-Reinecke-
Lichtenburg permanent line. Geysdorp was reached on the 30th May and
Barberspan on the 31st.,
The permanent restoration of the railway telegraphs had been proceeded
with as quickly as circumstances would permit. When the 10th Division
struck ofl: to the east to Barberspan the line party continued northward into
Mafeking concurrently with the advance of the party repairing the permanent
way. They opened an office at Kraaipan Siding on the 31st, and reached
Mafeking on the 4th of June, when that town once more came into telegraphic
communication with the south.
Meanwhile Lieutenant Macfie, with the 1 Oth Division, came in on the
permanent line afKlipdrift on the Ist June, and at Zoorkraal on the 2nd,
and reached Lichtenburg on the 3rd.
On his arrival at Mafeking Captain Wright found the lines from there to
Zeerust and Lichtenburg were in working order, and used by General Baden-
Powell for a telephone circuit. The Mafeking-Lichtenburg circuit was
changed into a single-current circuit, and a second wire was run from
Mafeking to Zeerust. By the Bth June Lieutenant Macfie had constructed a
line from Lichtenburg to Yentersdorp, of which the last 8 miles consisted
of bare wire laid on the ground. It was through this line that all the
Pretoria work passed during one of the many interruptions caused by General
De Wet to the lines through the Free State. On the 14th June Klerksdorp
and Fredorickstad were opened.
B 3


On the 11th June a civilian party started work Oh the telegraph line from
Kimberley, through',Barkley West to Kuruman. This line had beeh much
damaged by the enemy, and was wanted by Sir Charles Warren for'admihi-
strative purposes. It was completed on the 4th July, Another party was
told off to repair the main line between Kimberley and Yereeniging as far
as opportunity offered. One with the same object was despatched from
Johannesburg by Captain Godfrey-Faussett. Two wires were put through
on the 23rd June, and worked until the 26th, when they were again cut by
the Boers. Three more were through to Fotchefstroom on 16th July.'
Systems of outpost telephones connected to exchanges were.established- ( by
Captain Wright at Mafeking, Vrybufg, and Warren ton. .
17. LORD METHUEN’S MARCH TO HOOPSTAD, BOTHAVILLE,
AND KROONSTAD.
{Diagram 4.)
On the 3rd May Lieutenant Sherrard accompanied a column which
marched from Boshof in a north-easterly direction and laid a cable line to
Beck’s Farm, 4-g miles from Boshof. The column returned on the sth May,
and the cable was reeled up. ,
On the 14th May Lord Methuen started • with the Ist Division for
Hoopstad. Lieutenant Maclnnes and, Lieutenant Sherrard with his section
followed it up with cable and air line. The column arrived that day at
Mohan’s. Fontein, on the 15th at Driefontein, on the 16th at Aaronslaagte,
and on the 17lh the cable reached Hoopstad (68 miles). The air lino was
erected to Baberslaagte on the 17th, and, on the following day it, was
completed to Hoopstad,
On arrival at Hoopstad, the line from there through Bultfontein to Brandfort
was found to be intact and working, but Bultfontein was injthe hands,of the
Boers. The Boers were then apparently unaware of the, presence of , the
British troops at Hoopstad, : and it whs considered advisable to leave the
telegraph alone, lest they should find it out., ; , ~
For the further advance towards Bothaville, Lieutenant Maclnnes received
instructions to keep the advanced column in communication with the rear
column by cable, and not to attempt to maintain communication with
Hoopstad. This was carried out by Lieutenant Sherrard, who on the 20th May
connected Hoopstad with Wegdraai, on the Yaal River; on the 21st Wegdraai
with Jacobsplat; on the 22nd Jacobsplat with Commando Drift; on the 23rd
Commando Drift with Zandfontein ; and on the 24th Zandfontein with Botba-
ville —the advanced column being always a day’s march ahead of the rear
column..
During the march from Bothaville to Kroonstad, the front and rear columns
were connected together by cable as, before, but, iu addition, the permanent
line between those two places was put in order, and was used during the night.
The advanced column entered Kroonstad on the 28th, and the rear column oh
the 29th.
~ On the 30th May the advanced column left Kroonstad, and [proceeded
along the Heilbron road. The permanent line again served them for com-
munications. Lieutenant Maclnnes again started to restore communication
with Lindley, and having used up all the available material, succeeded by,dint
of using 3 miles of barbed wire fence in getting through to that place. > .This
line was, however, continually being cut by the enemy, and was therefore of
little use.
18. LORD ROBERTS’ MARCH TO KROONSTAD.
{Diagram 5.)
On the 3rd May Lord Roberts left Bloemfontein on bis march northwards
to the Transvaal. Captain Godfrey-Faussett, Lieutenant Webber, and
Lieutenant Mackworth, with; one air-line section, one' cable .section, and the
Telegraph Division Headquarters, accompanied him. ■


Lieutenants Moir and Heprici with their air-hne sections were advancing on r
a. parallel line, northwards from Thaba .’fichu, with General , lan Hamilton’s
column.' , , .
Lord. Roberts, reabhed Brandfort on . the night; of the 3rd ’ May. The
telegraph office was opened at 6 p.m., and worked, double current to Bloem-
fontein on the. veldt line., ;The marph,,wnB resumed r bn. the sth to Yet River,
where q,battle took place; , The office was opened .in a platelayer’s hut. just
out of reach of the enemy’s fire.
The march followed the railway all the way from Brandfort to Pretoria.
The damage done by the retiring Boers to the telegraph wires was in some
places, very extensive, and taxed the energies of the Telegraph Division to get
the wires through by the time the Army Headquarters arrived at their new
camping ground. This, however, it never failed to do, although! the day’s"
march was .generally completed by 1 p.m., except in certain when
the lines behind had been again meddled with!, or cut by the enemy. A cable
cart accompanied Lord Roberts always, and he was enabled to send messages'
during the temporary halts at any time of the day.
The next march was to Smaldeel Siding, where a halt of three days was
made. Lieutenant Moir was then at Winburg, and lateral communication was
opened up with that place by vibrator .by means of the Winburg railway
wire; although it had a gap of several yards in it.' The railway bridge over
the Yet River had been destroyed. Lieutenant Webber opened an office
there,,which remained . opened while .the temporary bridge was being made.
Lieutenant Moir.. left Winburg and rejoined the main body at Smaldeel on
the, Bth. ,
. On the 9th May the Army marched to Welgelegen; on the 10th to Riet-
spniit, where it was engaged with the enemy,; and on the 11th to Geneva
Siding. • v The permanent line was very extensively damaged in this section,
30 bays in one place being completely destroyed. - Lieutenant Mackworth
ran a cable line from Rietspruit eastwards, to join to lan Hamilton’s column,
which, .was then at Twistniet, about 5, miles north of Yentersburg. This
cable:had to cross the line of march of General Tucker’s division, and suffered'
considerably in consequence. . At one time it was cut, in nine places, and
apparently not accidentally ;.but it was repaired, and worked satisfactorily
later, in the, day.
' On the ; 12th Lord Roberts marched into Kroonstad, and the telegraph
office in ; the town was opened. The Brandfort-Winburg line across the veldt
terminates at Kroonstad, and had been restored to working order by Lieutenant
Henrici, who accompanied General lan Hamilton. This line had been pro-
longed, at Brandfort into Bloemfontein, so on arrival at Kroonstad there
were twp circuits available to Bloemfontein, both of which worked well, one
of them duplex.' On the following day an office was opened-at, Jordaahs
Siding, 4 miles beyond Kroonstad, at which place the Cavalry Division were’
encamped. A halt was made at Kroonstad until the morning of the 22nd May.
, On the 15th-May (Lieutenant Mackworth ran a, cable line to Lindley, where
General lan Hamilton’s column was ‘ sent! Lindley is about 50 Miles k from
Kroonstad. This cable was swept ,by a \ succession of veldt fires, which
stripped it of its insulation and broke it in places. It worked, however.
The troops left Lindley on .theAOth, and all.that was worth anything of,
cable was reeled up into Kroonstad.
■i‘On! the 21st .General !Gordon’s Cavalry Brigade r started for Heilbron.
Opportunity, was taken of: this to send: a small party through f the Kroonstad,
Heilbron line to effect repairs and open Heilbron. General Gordon’s column
Was;:divertedi by-orders .from Headquarters, and .never reached, Heilbron.
Lieutenant Mackworth Lady however,; sent a cable detachment with General
lan Hamilton into''Heilbron ontthe 20th.
19. PARALLEL MARCH OF IAN HAMILTON FROM THABA ’NGHU
TO KROONSTAD.
{pidgrafrt ;s!)
On'the'SOthApril General Jarr Hamilton ! a;cohunn loft Thaba ’Nchu for; the
north, and moved on KroonBtad in a (dhcjction; .parallel to that .pursued by
B 4


Lord Eoberts in his march from Bloemfontein. Lieutenant Moir constructed
an air line from Thaba ’lSTchu to Winburg to keep the column in com-
munication with the Array Headquarters via Do Wetsdorp and Bloemfontein.
The telegraph reached Khorrana Spruit at 4 p.m., the party having been
under shell fire all the afternoon.
' On the Ist May they arrived at Jacobsrust. At this place Lieutenant Moir
was joined by Lieutenant Henrici and his section, who had left Bloemfontein
on the 30th April with 50 miles of air line to replenish Lieutenant Moir’s
almost exhausted stores.
On the 3rd May the two sections together put up miles of line, reaching
Yerkeerde YJei, 3 miles north of Isabella Fontein. General lan Hamilton
expressed his admiration of the work.
. In the morning of the 4th May there was fighting, but in the afternoon
the air line was pushed on as far as Welkom, on the Magair Spruit, some
delay having been experienced at the drift.
On the sth the column arrived at Winburg, and the telegraph line was
completed into that town. General lan Hamilton was good enough to
mention the detachment in his dispatch to Lord Eoberts.
Lieutenant Moir remained at Winburg till the Bth May, arranging for
the repair of the Winburgrßrandford line and also for that of the line to
Smaldeel. He then left to rejoin the Headquarters of the Telegraph Division
at Smaldeel. ‘
Lieutenant Henrici and his section continued the advance from Winburg
with General lan Hamilton, putting the permanent line to Kroonstad in order
as he went. They reached Dankbaarfontein on the 6th May and Bloemplaats
on the 9th. The 10th was the day of the Zand Eiver fight, and the column
halted for the night at Boschkop. As General Hamilton had left the
permanent line some miles on his right—too far off for it to be safely
patrolled—Lieutenant Henrici ran a cable into Boschkop from the previous
halting place. General lan Hamilton left Yentersburg on his right, not
entering the town, and proceeded to Twistniet on the 11th May. It was,
therefore, not possible to further utilise the permanent line into Kroonstad.
On this being reported to Headquarters, Lieutenant Mackworth was sent
to run a cable across from the railway to near Boschkop, so as to enable
Lieutenant Henrici to reel up his cable from Bloemplaats, which was getting
too long to be safe. Lieutenant Henrici prolonged Lieutenant Mackworth’s
line into Twistniet. Lieutenant Mackworth returned to Army Headquarters
on the following day.
On the 12th May General lan Hamilton marched to Kroonspruit (four
miles south of Kroonstad) and an office was opened for him on the railway
line. On the 13th Lieutenant Henrici rejoined the Telegraph Division at
Jordaans Siding (Kroonstad).
20. LORD ROBERTS’ MAECH FROM KROONSTAD TO PRETORIA.
{Diagram 5.)
On the 22nd Lord Eoberts resumed his march from Kroonstad. The
same telegraphic arrangements were made as for the previous march from
Bloemfontein. The first halt was made at Honingspruit, and the Head-
quarters camp being some distance from the railway, two cables had to be
run between them for the two circuits.
Lieutenant Webber and some men in a wagon were sent off td join General
Gordon’s Cavalry Brigade, which, as described in a previous paragraph, had
set out from Kroonstad for Heilbron. Lieutenant Webber was to open
Heilbron office, and do whatever was required to repair the permanent lines
from thence to Kroonstad, Yredefort Eoad, Wolverhoek, and Yiljoensdrift.
Owing to the orders diverting General Gordon’s march back to the railway,
. Lieutenant Webber never found him, and thinking he had gone on into
Heilbron, and had secured the town, proceeded there with his men, and was
immediately taken prisoner by the Boers, who had resumed possession.
This officer and his men were taken to Pretoria, and remained prisoners of
war till the arrival of the British troops.


On the 23rd May the Army halted at Ehenoster Elver, where another pair
of cable lines had to be run into the Headquarters camp, and on the 24th
Yredefort Road Station was reached. The following day the camp was at
Groot Ylei, where Lord Roberts was again at some distance from the railway.
The permanent wires were repaired as far as Wolverhoek. Lieutenant
Mackworth ran a cable from Yredefort Road to connect with General lan
Hamilton, who was now marching on the left of the railway. He remained
in communication till the 27th, when he rejoined the main body.
On the 26th there was a short march to Taaiboschspruit, and on the 27th
the Traansval was entered, the camp being at Yereeniging. The telegraph
office at Yereeniging is an important junction of the main road line to
Kimberley, to Natal, and to Johannesburg. The office connections and
switchboard had fortunately been left in good order.
On leaving Yereeniging, Lord Roberts still continued to march along the
railway to Elandsfontein, in preference to taking the shorter road straight to
Johannesburg. Klipriver Station was the halting place on the night of the
28th, and on the 29th he camped on the hill overlooking Germiston after a
battle had taken place just outside Johannesburg. The telegraph wires were
led up from the railway to the top of the hill, and worked very well until
midnight on the 30th-31st, when they were cut by the Boers in our rear.
Johannesburg was entered on the 31st May.
The Headquarter Camp was pitched at Orange Grove Farm, just outside
the town, on the road to Pretoria. As there was much to settle at Johannes-
burg, Lord Roberts remained at Orange Grove till the 3rd June. This time
was spent in re-establishing Johannesburg Telegraph Office on a military basis.
On the 3rd June Lord Roberts marched to Leeuw Kop, where 3 miles
of cable were necessary to lead the circuits into camp. The cable was much
damaged by veldt fires. On the 4th the battle of Six Miles Spruit, just
outside Pretoria, took place. In the evening the lines were led into camp,
about 4 miles from the railway.
On the sth June Pretoria surrendered. The Headquarters stopped outside
the town, and an office was opened with a cable cart. The Commander-in-
Ohief remained at this spot for some time while the capitulation was being
arranged, and then went to the railway station, where he was again put in
telegraphic communication with Bloemfontein. Meanwhile the Pretoria
Telegraph Office and administrative buildings had been taken over by the
Director of Telegraphs. The officer prisoners having effected their own
release from confinement, Lieutenant Webber presented himself at the
Telegraph Office.
21. MARCH OF OAVALRY FROM KROONSTAD TO PRETORIA.
[Diagram 5.)
On the 20th May, two days previous to the departure of the main body of
the Army from Kroonstad, the Cavalry Division left Jordaan Siding to cover
the left front of the Infantry Divisions. Lieutenant Moir was directed to
keep it> in touch with Headquarters by means of a cable line. > On that day
the division marched to Mahemsvlei; on the 21st, to Welgelegen; on the
22nd, to Engelsche Kyi; and on the 23rd, to Essenbosche.
. It had not been possible to equip the section with sufficient cable to keep
up any further communication, so Lieutenant Moir, having arranged for the
reeling up of the line from the rear, proceeded with men for the purpose of
tapping any of the existing telegraphs which he might come across during
the further advance of the cavalry.
On the 24th he encountered the Heilbron-Yredefort line, and some
telegrams passed. He then followed General French to Yiljoensdrift (8 miles
east of Parys), and on the 25th moved along the left bank of the Vaal, and
crossed it 2 miles east of Lindeque, where there was no opportunity for
telegraphy.
On the 26th the Yereeniging-Potchefstroom wires were crossed, but though
tapped, no information could be obtained. It was considered desirable to cut
this line of telegraphs. On the 2/th they marched to Houtkop, camping
5 miles south of Elandsfontein Farm. On the 28th Wyksrust was reached.
e 25137. C


Here they touched the Yereeniging-Johahuesburg telegraph line, dnd tapped
it, but got; nothing. On the- 29th they marched to Elip Rivet,' which place
Lord Roberts had left that morning, and.oni-the 30tb Lieutenant Moir x’ejoined
Headquarters at Germiston.
22. EVENTS IN PRETORIA.
On. arrival in Pretoria, Lord Roberts and, the Headquarter Staff werb all
provided with billets in Sunnyside, which was about a mile from the principal
telegraph'office. It was therefore decided to open a branch office in,an empty
house close to the British Agency,.where the. Commander-in-Ohief resided.
Lieutenant Mackworth was sent down the railway to open /Irene ; and, other
railway offices for the Director of Railways,- and Lieutenant Moir put .the road
line wires to Johannesburg in working order.
. General Pole-Oarew and tho llth Division took up a position to the,east of
of; Pretoria, and an office was opened for them. at .Silvertou. All the wires
leading out of Pretoria except those in use for the British were cut, to
prevent information leaking out;
There was an efficient telephone .systein.in .existence, and all tho-principal
staff officers and heads of departments , were connected to .it, while all'the
remaining subscribers were cut.out; /The Boers had / also left/a half-finished
telephone system to the forts which centred in the Staats-Artillery,Barracks;
This was completed-and put into working order. '.There was also a telephone
trunk wire-to Johannesburg, which connected thdExchange at that place, with
the/one in Pretoria. This proved very useful.
(From- the time of-entering/Johannesburg the line ito Bloemfontein had
been much interrupted by the Boers,-/who were still moving : in small- bodies
through the Free State, and in spite of the efforts of : the maintenance parties;
communication with the south was often /broken down., It was (impossible
to prevent this happening, since the line traversed miles and miles of desolate
veldt which it was impracticable to effectively guard, and it was at the
mercy of anyone who chose, under cover of the night or otherwise, to.cut or
tamper with the wires. ■ At first the Boers contented themselves with putting
temporary faults on the circuits*(which led to the supposition/that they were
being tapped, andjwhich:/rendered;necessary the extensive employment of
the cypher. :The Boers found out soon* as others have done before, that
there is very little satisfaction in tapping wires, and these.faults ;ceased to
come right of themselves. A breakdown which commenced on the 7th
June, and was still in existence on the 10th, notwithstanding all endeavours
to put it right, led to -Lieutenant Webber being despatched with a repairing
party down the railway to the south.. Atrthe same time a fresh disposition
of troops was made along the lino of communication to guard the railway,
which'was also suffering damages
The operations of General De Wet and others on the railway, which began
in the early part of June, need no description in this report. But it may
here be said that they necessitated the opening of a large number of telegraph
offices along the southern railway, both in the Transvaal and in the Free
State, to provide quick communication between the comparatively’ small
bodies of troops scattered-along the line. Irene, 'Olifantsfontein, Eaalfontein,
Zuurfontein,- Rietfontein,-Boksbiirg, Springs* Aatisluiting, Klipriver, and
Meyerton, were opened on the Transvaal Railway; : and Yiljoensdrift,
Taaiboschspruit, Wolverhoek, Eromellboogspruit, Yredefort Road, Leeuw-
spruit, Koppies Siding, Rhenosterspruitt, Roodeval, Serfontein, Honingspruit,
and Amerika Siding, on the railway to Eroonstad.
The opening of these offices rendered -obligatory the erection of a fourth
wire-On- the railway poles south of Yereeniging. It had been foreseen that
a 0 fourth' 1 wire would be wanted along the railway from Bloemfontein' to
the Transvaal frontier, and it had been started by Captain Fowler'before
the Army Headquarters had left’ Bloemfontein. It was mOre than ; 'half
finished before De Wet’s raids had-begun,'but when the -redistributioaof
the troOps on the line of communications was resolved upon, it became
necessary quickly to finish it. With this object a party was sent from


Pretoria to work from theyereenigingj end,.and,a,cable wasiaidby Lieutenant
Mackworth to bridge the gap untilit'was‘completed!,
It was during these interruptions to the Bloemfontein line that communi-
cation was opened, on the 13th, via Potchefstroom, and Ventersdorp by
Lieutenant Macfie’s line to Lichtenburg (alluded to in a previous paragraph),
ahd:so to Mafeking and Kimberley. . The natUre'of the Yehtersdorp-Lichten-
bhrg. line . (being, partly bare wire on the r ground) rendered communication
by i this route difficult, and it was only possible through the’splendid efforts
of the: clerk at Ventersdorp (Sapper, Woodrow), who ' had 1 to transmibevefy-
thing. To relieve the pressure a party left Pretoria on the 16th to
repair theßustenberg-Zeerust line, and to restore communication to Kimberley
route.' * This was: achieved’On the, 20th, and Remained the principal
outlet from Pretoria-till the-22nd June. Rustenburg itself was still in
communication with Pretoria till the 4th July, and again between the sth and
9th July.
The main telegraph line between Pretoria and Kimberley via Pot chefs troom
ran through country that had never been traversed by our troops, and although
two wires were put through to Kimberley ori the 23rd June, they were cut
again on the 26th between Yereeniging and Potchefstroom, and .the Boers
remained for some time watching the 1 gap. To bridge over the 1 gap the
railway wire from Johannesburg through Krugersdorp to Potchefstroom, was
put in order on the 30th June, and work was sent that way to Kimberley
until the 4th July, when the gap on the road wires was repaired. During this
time Pretoria sometimes worked double-current .-duplex to Gape Town with a
repeater at Kimberley, but the lines were not in good enough condition to make it
a success. On the 22nd July, the wires were cut again- between Yereeniging
and Potchefstroom, and as this was one of the days when the Bloemfontein
Tfires were interrupted, and the date on .which the Rustenburg circuit was:cut,
all telegraph communication with Pretoria failed ; :but by a marvellous stroke
of fortune the Natal wires, which; had been broken-down if or some;daysJ pre-
viously, came right, and so saved the, situation. Owing to; the insecurity of
theiines, and the vast number of messages to be dealt with, the management
of the Pretoria traffic was.always one anxiety. On one
occasion communication with Kimberley was effected- through Newcastle,
Pietermaritzburg, King , William’s Town, and De Aar. .-The wires were put
through at those .places, and worked Wheatstone simplex a distance of about,
seven hundred miles.
-■There were two possible routes by which communication with Yereeniging
could be effected, one the direct line from Johannesburg : and the other through
Heidelberg. The latter-had -been cut by General'French; on entering/the
Transvaal, and, not being wanted, had not been repaired/until the 22nd July;
But it was cut again on the 4th September, and this time by the Boers. • They
had also cut the direct line, and Yereeniging: became isolated. Being an
important post it was necessary to take immediate steps .to: restore it to;
communication. Accordingly Lieutenant Henrici was. sent to run.another,
wire from Blandsfontein on rail; he completed the ,40 miles :in two days,
which was an excellent piece of ; work. ‘ -The line from Heidelberg to Natal
also gave a good deal of trouble. It was several times cut by the enemy, oven
in Natal itself.
Besides the work involved in the maintenance of the permanent telegraph
system, which at times was exceptionally heavy, parties went out with detached
commands to keep them iri touch with Headquarters. One under Lieutenant
Hildebrand accompanied General Paget beyond the Magaliesberg to the
north. Another under Lieutenant’Macfie operated. in connection with
General Hart’s force from Krugersdorp. This latter party ran , out ah
extremely useful line (13th August) to meet General lan Hamilton, who ’was
moving from the north-west to cut off De Wet, who was retiring before Lord
Kitchener from the south. Some highly impoftabt tactical messages'passed.
A third party under Lieutenant Moir opened offices on ! the permanent lines at
Silverton, Struben’sFarm, Arcadia, Donkerhoek,-Mark’sFarm,and Wolmarans,
for the operations under General Pole-Carew-easf : of Pretoria-early in June
against General Botha,: near Hartebeestepoort.

23. OPERATIONS OF GENERALS HUNTER, RUNDLE, CLEMENTS,
AND PAGET IN THE ORANGE RIVER COLONY.
{Diagram 6.)
During July the Orange River Colony became the scene of the complicated
operations of Generals Lord Methuen, Hunter, Bundle, Clements, and Paget
against the Boers, who, taking advantage of the absence of Lord Roberts and
the main Army in the Transvaal, had again overrun the country. Captain
Fowler had to conduct the arrangements necessary for keeping these Generals
in communication with Army Headquarters. Captain Webber, Lieutenant
G. E. Blkington, who had recently arrived with a draft from England,
Lieutenant Maclnnes, and Lieutenant Sherrard, who were with the Ist
Division with a somewhat attenuated section, were placed under Captain
Fowler’s command for this purpose.
There was a perpetual movement of British troops in every direction,
hunting the Boers from one place to another throughout the Orange River
Colony. It was most difficult to keep these troops in telegraphic communi-
cation, as the lines erected or restored for their use were perpetually being cut
again by the Boers as fast as they could be repaired, and also because it was
impossible for working parties to keep them in order unless attended by
almost prohibitive escorts.
On the 2nd July General Paget, who was at Lindley, moved towards
Bethlehem, and became engaged with the Boers. During the action he was
placed in communication with his cavalry by a cable line. On the sth his
advanced cavalry entered Bethlehem, and was again kept in touch with him
in the same manner.
On the 6th and 7th July, General Clements, who had advanced from
Senekal, co-operated with General Paget in attacking the enemy’s position
near Bethlehem, and was greatly aided in the carrying out of his designs by
being connected by wire with General Paget. On the 9th, General Clements
retired towards Senekal, and advantage was taken of the escort so provided
to put the Bethlehem-Senekal line in order. A party was also sent along the 1
line to Lindley. The Bethlehem-Reitz line proved to be in working order.'
The Lindley line came right on the 10th and the Senekal line on the lltb, but
between the 12th and the 22nd was being perpetually cut by the Boers and
repaired.
The operations in the Orange River Colony culminated though, unfortu-
nately, did not end, in the Fouriesberg Hills, where the joint action of Generals
Hunter, Clements, and Paget was much facilitated by their being connected
together by cable, while their communication with Army Headquarters was
secured by a line to Senekal.
General Hunter’s force left Bethlehem on the 22nd July, by the Naauw-
poort Road, but swung round and camped on the Fouriesberg Road, about
7 miles north of Reliefs Nek. As the division only arrived at dark, communi-
cation was not completed till the following morning. It was effected by a
cable connection to the Bethlehem-Fouriesberg permanent line. Generals
Clements and Paget moved forwards towards Slabberts Nek, and were kept
in touch with General Hunter by means of a cable connected to the Senekal-
Bethlehem line at Bultfontein*. General Bundle’s division (occupying the
Winburg-Ficksburg position, with Headquarters at Harmonia) were in touch
with the telegraphs at Ficksburg. On the 24th July the positions at
Slabbert’s Nek and Reliefs Nek were captured, and Generals Hunter and
Clements’ forces joined hands, and the cable lines' were recovered, an office
being opened on the Bethlehem-Fouriesberg line at Retiefs Nek.
On the 25th the force marched to within 7 miles of Fouriesberg, a
cable line being run from the permanent line into the camp. On the 27th
Fouriesberg was occupied, and the permanent telegraph office was opened.
In it were found some telegraph instruments which had been captured by
the Boers from the British. On the 28th and 29th the force marched east-
wards, communication being kept up by a mixture of air line and cable. On
the 30th the Boer force capitulated, and after the business connected with


the surrender, and -with the disposal of prisoners, was completed, the Head-
quarters returned to Fouriesberg. The field line was left standing, with an
office at “ Surrender Hill.”
On August the 7th the telegraph line to Harrismith was put through by a
lineman who accompanied the Highland Brigade, which started from the
main force on the 25th July to secure the town. The office at Harrismith
was opened, and a lineman was sent along the line to Yan Reenen’s Pass. On
the Bth a civilian staff from Natal arrived at Harrismith, and took over the
working of the office, which then was through to Ladysmith.
It would be impossible to present a coherent account of the subsequent:
telegraph operations in the Orange River Colony. Several mobile columns
traversed the country in all directions in pursuit of Be Wet and of the small
commandos which remained active after the surrender of Prinsloo in the
Fouriesberg Hills. It was not possible to keep up continuous telegraphic
touch with the various columns, as they were launched en Vain, and did not
preserve their communications. They were, however, provided with operators
and linemen, which were very useful, and such of the permanent telegraphs
as they were likely to come across were kept in order as far as circumstances
would permit. Too much praise cannot be given to Captain Fowler for the
indefatigable way in which this disheartening duty was performed. Every
line in the Colony was the object of incessant attack by the Boers, and
though repaired times without number for the service of the flying columns,
was inevitably cut after a few hours. The railway wires forming the main
communication with Pretoria were cut no less than 50 times in three months,
and sometimes every night, but so excellent was the arrangement of the
linemen and restoring parties, that these breaks were usually repaired within
an hour or two after dawn. Various armoured trains were equipped with
operators, linemen, and telegraph material to assist in repairing breaks.
Considerable courage and gallantry was displayed by the linemen, both civil
and military, on many occasions. Twenty-nine new offices were opened
during this period, of which 10 remained open permanently.
On the 18th of December some Boer commandos entered Cape Colony, and
for three months or more the northern and western portions of it were the
scene of operations similar to those described in the foregoing paragraph.
Captain Wright took in hand the telegraph arrangements for the British
columns, and assisted the Cape Colony Government in the restoration of the
lines which the Boer commandos had destroyed, as-well as with clerks for
their small country offices.
Be Wet himself having entered the Colony on the 11th February, special
efforts were rendered necessary for his expulsion or capture. A strong force
assembled in the neighbourhood of De Aar, and two cable detachments were
despatched there from Pretoria and Bloemfontein.
One of these detachments, under Serjt. Salter, followed General Bnice
Hamilton to Britstown, Prieska, Houwater, and Klipdrift, to which places
communication was kept up with De Aar. The other cable detachment,
under Captain Wright, went to Hopetown on the 19th of February, and
opened up communication between that town and Gelukspoort, 25 miles west.
’ Ten miles of the Hopetown-Strydenburg permanent line was made use of for
this purpose. Gelukspoort remained open from the 21st to the 24th February,
when the troops were removed and the office closed. Both cable detachments
were subsequently sent to join Lieutenant Hildebrand at Springfontein.
Lieutenant (just then promoted captain) Hildebrand had been ordered to
De Aar to assist Captain Wright in the telegraph arrangements in that
neighbourhood, and’was on his way there with an air-line detachment.' On
reaching Norvals Pont he received orders to return to Springfontein to lay a
cable for General Plumer’s column towards the west. This was begun on the
2nd March, and paid out as far as Osfontein (17 miles) on that day, where an
office was opened. The cable was reeled up as far as Spion Kop on the 3rd,
and to Springfontein on the 4th, on which day the section entrained for
Edenburg.
On the sth the Jagersfontein office was re-opened for General Plumer, and
closed again on the 6th. The section returned to Edenburg, but being
attacked at Groot Kalverfontein, did not reach Edenburg till the 7th. J
0 3


On the 12th Col. Haig’s column: left Edenburg for the east, to co-opetate
in,a combined movement towards the Thaba ’Nchu-Ladybi;and line; Captain
Hildebrand’s section accompanied it, and on the 13th opened up .communica-
tion between Colonel Haig and Colonel Byng, by 8 miles of cable from
Vaalbank to Boezakfontein.
On the 14th the column reached Bulberg, and an office was opened on the
Bloemfontein-Reddersburg permanent line, and that line repaired.
Colonel Haig’s force proceeded to Tweede Geluk half way between Bloem-
fontein and Dewetsdorp, on the 16th, a line, partly air line and partly cable,
being run from Bulberg to that place (15 miles).
On the 17th the column marched to Portion, and on the 18th to Victoria,
where an office was opened on the Thaba ’Nchu-Dewetsdorp line.
On the 19th Colonel Haig reached Thaba ’Nchu, and halted there for a few
days.
Captain Hildebrand left Thaba ’Nchu with his section on the 21st en route
for Pretoria, whore he was wanted in connection with the advance towards
Nylstroom, opening a temporary office at Weltovreden, and on the 22nd at
Springfield, on his way to Bloemfontein. These offices were on the
Bloemfontein-Thaba ’Nchu wire.
24. RE-ORGANISATION OF ARMY TELEGRAPHS.
Captain Fowler, to whom had been allotted the task of restoring the broken
lines in the Colony which led to Norvals Pont and Bethulie Bridge, completed
this work on the 23rd March, and was then directed to proceed to Bloem-
fontein to take over the management of such of the standing lines of the
Free State as were in use for Army Telegraphs. These comprised all those
actually in the occupied territory. The object of this was to preserve intact
as far as possible the field sections for such operations in connection with the
marches of troops as needed their superior mobility.
"When the Telegraph Division accompanied Lord Roberts’ march to the
Transvaal, Captain Fowler took over and permanently restored all the road
lines to the north, some of which had been temporarily put in order by the
field sections. The permanent repairs to the railway telegraph lines, which
had also been put through by the Telegraph Division, were undertaken by
Lieutenant M. G. E. Manifold (railway'telegraph superintendent). 1 When
De Wet made his many raids on the communications in the Free State both
these officers had a share in mending the railway wires.
Captain C. de W. Crookshank joined the Army Telegraphs on the 4th May,
and was appointed to assist Captain Fowler, principally in financial matters.
He remained with him till the end of June, when he went to Pretoria.
When the Army Headquarters passed into the Transvaal, Captain Fowler’s
charge increased until it very soon embraced all the existing telegraphs in
the Free State, or Orange River Colony as it then became, and this officer
was appointed Director of the Orange River Colony Telegraphs with the
.concurrence of the High Commissioner. When Pretoria fell into the hands
of the British, and the greater portion of the Transvaal telegraphs passed'
under military control, it became necessary to appoint a similar Director of the
Transvaal Telegraphs. Captain Godfrey-Faussett, who had shown himself to
be so capable in his management of the arrangements which had fallen to
his share, received this appointment.
, The Telegraph Division, owing to the number of men which it had been
necessary to leave in charge of permanent lines, both in the Transvaal and
the Orange River Colony, had dwindled so much in numbers that only one
air-line section and the cable section remained.
When the junction with General Buller’s Natal force took place, Major
Hawkins, Captain Boys, Lieutenant Hildebrand, Lieutenant Turner,
Lieutenant Meyrick, and two additional sections came under the control of
the Director of Army Telegraphs. He placed Major Hawkins in , command
of the three air-line sections.and cable section, made available,,and thus
formed a new Telegraph Division for service in the field. At this time also
the store * of. telegraph material, belonging, to, the Natal Field Force was


transferred from Yolksrust to Pretoria; where' also the stores belonging to
Lord Roberts’ force were brought: Thb Natal Clearing House was amalga-
mated with the Bloemfontein Clearing House, and both moved-to Pretoria.
The object of this concentration of finance and stores was the more' ready
winding-up of the business of the campaign, then showing 1 signs of shortly
coming to an end.
Major R. S. Curtis joined the Army Telegraphs on the 19th July, and was
appointed assistant to the Director.
By the changes described in the previous paragraphs the administration of
the Army Telegraphs was divided into the following subheads, under the
Director of the Army Telegraphs :
(1) The Telegraph Division for field operations (Major ,Hawkins);
(2) The Western District, including part of the Transvaal (Captain
Wright);
(3) The Orange River Colony Telegraphs (Captain Fowler);
(4) The Transvaal Telegraphs (Captain Godfrey-Faussett) ;
(5) The Stores and Financial Department (Lieutenant Bannerman).
25. OPERATIONS IN NATAL UNTIL THE JUNCTION OF
THE TWO ARMIES.
Siege of Ladysmith.
(Diagram 7.)
On tlie 27th October one section and a Headquarters of the Telegraph
Battalion, commanded’by Major W. F. Hawkins, arrived from England at
Durban. The officers with it yrere Captain R. H. H., Boys and Lieutenant
A. B.R. Hildebrand. Lieutenants E. V. Turner and H. L. Meyrick joined
it after the siege. It brought out 15 miles of air line, 8 miles of cable, arid
three office equipments. Reserves to the extent of 45 iniles of air line,
16 miles of cable, and eight offices followed shortly after. The disembarka-
tion was completed, and the men and stores loaded on railway trucks, and a
start made for Ladysmith the same day. Major Hawkins was appointed
Director of Telegraphs. ,
The telegraph section lost no time in becoming involved in a battle ; for
bn the 30th of October, the day after its arrival, took place the battle of
Lombardskop, during which fight the Headquarter Office in the town, the
post* office, the' railway station, Colonel Knox’s Headquarters, the armoured
train, the balloon, and Limit Hill were allplaced in telegraphic communication
by means of spurs run but from, the permanent road line running towards
the north. Colonel Knox was in charge of the defence of the town, and
Limit Hill was the position of the main .body of infantry, and also for some
time that of the Commander-in-Chief and. his Staff. The infantry withdrew
from Limit Hill about 11 a.m., and the armoured train also retired.
On the 31st a line was run from the Headquarters Office to Ca3sar’s
Camp, a distance of about 3 miles. On the 2nd November another line was
established to King’s Post, where the commander, of “B ” Section of the
defence fixed his Headquarters, and then prolonged Cove Redoubt, an
important position in this section. On this day the lines to the south were
cut by the Boers, thus completing the investment of Ladysmith.
During the siege, which lasted from the 2nd November till the 28th
February, a number of lines were run connecting various important defence
posts and points of observation with the telephone exchange at Headquarters.
These lines were to :
■Helpmakaar (subsequently called Cemetery Hill), ah important post in
Section C, 2i miles from Headquarters.
Observation Hill, in Section B.
Helpmakaar Redoubt (subsequently, called Devonshire Post).
The Balloon.
Naval observing station (afterwards called Conning Tower).
Riflemans Post in Section B.
Commanding-Royal Engineers.
C 4


Tunnel Hill (afterwards called Railway Cutting).
Western Post (afterwards called Manchester Port).
Range Post.
Maiden Castle.
Director of Telegraphs.
Leicester Camp.
Naval Camp.
Wagon Hill.
Commandant of Volunteers.
General Brocklehurst.
General Knox.
Besides the above, the following additional telephone circuits were run,
viz.:—From the Balloon to the 4*7 gun; a direct line between Cove
Redoubt and Observation Hill; from the Conning Tow.er to the 4*7 gun;
to the Convent..
The section of the Telegraph Battalion was kept constantly employed
improving these lines and shifting offices to avoid the Boer Artillery lire,
and in repairing damage caused by thunderstorms and the enemy’s guns.
The telephone exchange was three times moved before a safe place was finally
found. On one occasion a shell burst in the Assistant-Adjutant General’s
Office, causing the fall of a wall and smothering the exchange instruments
with debris.
On January sth direct communication was temporarily established between
Devonshire Post and Manchester Fort, in order that the effect of the Artillery
at the former might be observed from the latter, which was the only
advantageous point from which the result could be determined.
The greatest vigilance had of course to be maintained throughout the
siege, and more especially during the latter half of it, when attacks from the
Boers were most to be feared. An officer slept in the Headquarters
Exchange, and more than once linemen went out in the middle of the night
to get slight defects put right, so that the system might be always in perfect
order. Sir George White directed the defence entirely by telephone, and
said that it was the telephone system that saved Ladysmith when the Boers
attacked Wagon Hill and Csesar’s Camp on the 6th January. Considerable
use was made of the phonophores found in the town, but they gave trouble,
and were often going out of order, and were generally replaced by the
vibrator.
Numerous experiments were made to establish communication with the
outside world by wireless telegraphy, and by means of the broken railway
wires, but, beyond a few slight indications, without success. A large
parabolic mirror 8 feet in diameter was also constructed with a wooden
framework, and lined with sheets of bright tin, in the hopes that flash signals
on to the clouds might succeed. Incandescent electric lamps with 360 battery
cells, and lucigen, and the lime light were tried, but without avail. On the
28th February Lord Dundonald entered the town, and the siege was at an
end. On the following day the railway wire to the south was repaired, and
at 3.30 p.m. a junction was effected with the line established by the relief
force, so restoring communication with Nelthorpe, Pieters, Colenso, and
the south.
26. THE RELIEF OF LADYSMITH.
(Diagram 8.)
As stated in a previous paragraph, Lieutenant Jelfs section left De Aar
on the 23rd .December for Natal. It arrived at Durban on January 3rd, and
proceeded at once by rail to Estcourt to join the relief force.
After an interview with Sir Charles Warren at Frere, Lieutenant Jelf
moved his section partly by road and partly by rail to Frere. At this place
preliminary negotiations were entered into with the Postmaster-General of
Natal as to the working of the circuits that might be established for the use
of the Army, and it was decided for the present to make Frere the point of
demarkation between the Army Telegraph and the Civil Department. A


military office was established at Frere, and messages were to be handed over
to the Natal Government Telegraph System at that place. Preparations were
at once made for an advance.
The move from Frere took place on the 10th January, when an air line
was put up to General Clery’s camp near Pretorius’ Farm. This line was
kept about a mile away from the road along which the transport would
march, and worked well. It was preceded by a cable line following a more
direct route, which suffered considerably from the baggage wagons. On the
following day the air line was continued to Springfield, and an office opened
at that place working to Frere, with Pretorius’ Farm intermediate. There is
no bridge Over the Little Tugela at Springfield ; the wire was carried across
by a man swimming. General Sir Kedvers Buller’s-Headquarters were then
at Springfield, but he advanced thence to Spearman’s Farm oh the 12th
January, whither the air line followed him, and an office at Spearman’s Farm
was added to the circuit. On the 13th a telephone line was erected from
Spearman’s Farm to the Signal Station near Labuschagne’s Farm. Helio-
graphic communication was established with Ladysmith, and telephone
signals were exchanged by means of the broken railway wires.
There being no further need for an office at Pretorius’ Farm, it was closed
on the 15th January. In the evening of the following day the troops advanced
towards the Tugela, and a line was run to the signal station on Schwartz
Kop. This was prolonged on the 17th to Potgieter’s Ford, as General Lyttleton
advanced, while an air line was erected from the Headquarters at Spearman’s
Farm to accompany a flanking movement that Sir Charles Warren was making
to Trichardts Drift. He crossed the river on the 18th, and the line was
continued to a farm on the left bank, and subsequently prolonged to
Yentersdrift.
These lines continued working till the 26th January, when Sir Charles
Warren fell back across the river. The office at Venters Drift was then
retired to the right bank of the river at Trichardts Drift, and then to a point
half-way between the drift and Spearman’s Farm, then diverted to a place
called Macfie, and lastly further back still to Hatten’s Farm. As Hatten’s Farm
was close to the main air line to Springfield, it was served by a spur from that
line, and the lines to Trichardts Drift were recovered.
, On the 3rd February Sir Charles Warren left Hatten’s Farm for Potgieter’s
Plateau, and fixed his Headquarters near the telegraph office opened for
General Lyttleton. Hatten’s Farm was, therefore, no longer required, and
was closed. Lines were run to the gun positions and to General Clery’s
camp. On the Bth February it was decided to abandon the Potgieter’s
position altogether, and to make another attack from the Chieveley direction.
Accordingly all the offices in and about Spearman’s Farm were closed and
the wires recovered, while the Army retired towards Springfield Bridge. Sir
Charles Warren moved bis Headquarters back to Pretorius’ Farm, where an
office was temporarily opened for his use.
On the 12th February the troops marched to Chieveley. Springfield office
was kept open for the use of the Cavalry, and the lines from Frere to
Chieveley Station and to the camp on Gun Hill were put into working order.
On the 14th a cable line, subsequently replaced by air line, was run from Gun
Hill to Hussar Hill, a point 4 miles further on; another was laid a tele-
phone to the sth Brigade at Schutter’s Hill; and on the 16th a third was
teed on to General Lyttleton’s Camp at Moord Kraal.
On the 19th February the Hussar Hill line was prolonged to Green Hill,
which had been taken without opposition, the Boers having begun to retire
after receiving the news of the relief of Kimberley ; and later on in the day
it was still further extended to Bloy’s Farm. On the following morning it
reached to fllangwana Hill, and on the 21st to the pontoon bridge over the
Tugela, where Sir Eedvers Buller fixed his Headquarters.
On the 23rd February the wire was pushed across the river at the pontoon
bridge to the left bank, where an office was established. The telegraph
detachment was exposed to a severe fire, and had to seek refuge in a donga,
where the office instruments were brought. Heavy rains fell, making the
donga suddenly into a rushing torrent which carried the instruments away,
E 25137. D


and before they could be saved they were nearly into the Tugela, On the,
night of the' 26th the pontoon bridge was removed and set up in another*
position without any warning'being given to Lieutenant Jelf,. whose cable,
across the river had been supported on the bridge. ' The,cable was,.of course,
carried down stream in the water, and, not being designed to withstand such
treatment, had to be cut and replaced by another piece, heaved .with difficulty
across the river where it,narrowed into rapids. General Lyttletpn,advanced
down the left bank of the river and close to the railway wires, which were
used to keep him in communication.
On the 27th February the news of Cronje’s surrender reached General
Buller, and ho doubt the investing army as well. The river was crossed by
the new pontoon bridge, some distance*lower down, on the 28th, and the
Headquarters came in touch with the railway wires, which were repaired, and
put Sir Redvers in direct, communication with Chieveley r and Frere. -Lord
Dundonald’s cavalry entered Ladysmith, On the Ist March* Sir; Redvers.
Buller moved on to Melthorpe Station, where an office was opened with Pieters
intermediate. A cable line was pushed on towards Ladysmith, and at about
3.30 p.m, met a party of telegraphists who had run a line out from Ladysmith,
and so restored communication with the town.
■ Lieutenant Jelf had to execute all the telegraph work connected with, the
Relief of Ladysmith single-handed. He did it in a manner which called forth
the praise of everyone, from Sir Redvers Buller downwards. . But it was done,
at the expense of. his life, for the strain was too great. When his work, was
finished his health .broke down, and he died on his way home.
27. OCCUPATION OF THE ELANDSLAAGTE POSITION.
(Diagram 9.)
Asisoon as possible after the Relief of Ladysmith, all the lines and offices
opened'for the defence were closed and recovered. Pieters and Chieveley were
removed from the Pietermaritzburg line, and Coleuso alone left on it as an
intermediate office till the'l6th March. Communication between Helthorpd
Station and Headquarters was'’still provided for by vibrators teed bn to the
main line. On the- 10th March' Eelthbrpe; was.iclosed, and Intombi Camp
opened instead. Intombi Camp was closed; on* the 30th March.
To provide for the use of the droops left in occupation- of Ladysmith
telegraph ; circuits ; were established: as follows (1) Star Hill, Ladysmith,
Arcadia ; (2) Sunday River, Elandslaagte, ModderspruiV Ladysmith ; and
(3) ; Sunday River, Supply Dep6t ; • while Tabanyama, Smith’s Crossing,
Surprise .Hill, Tin Camp, R.E. Park, and Railway Station were connected to
the. exchange at Ladysmith. , When the, Elandslaagte position was taken up
some alterations were made to the exchange; Tabanyama and Surprise Hill
were taken off it, and Clydesdale Farm and the Commandant’s house were
put on instead. Surprise Hill, Hyde’s Farm, Star Hill, Signpost Ridge,
Pounds Plateau, Farqiihar’s Farm, Modderspruit, Buy’s Farm, Elandslaagte,
Battlefield. Ridge, Woodcote Farm, and Junono’s Yale were served by tele-
graph from . Ladysmith. A • second telephone exchange was established at
Woodcote Farm, having communication, with Woodcote Ridges •• Junono’s
Plateau; JunonoVKop, S.W.,Spur, Five Inch Hill, and the ,naval guns. A
further telephone circuit was put up between the naval guns and the
12-pounder on Battlefield Ridge.
28. ADVANCE, TO HELPMAKAAR, THE BIGGARSBERG, AND
NEWCASTLE.
{Diagram- 10.)
The advance to Helpmakaar and the Biggarsberg commenced on the
7th May. Lieutenant Hildebrand’s section started from Buy’s,Barm. to, keep
the force (which was accompanied by Sir Redvefs Buller) in connection with
Ladysmith by means of air line,' Cornelius Pieter’s Farm was reached that


night,’ Sunday River Drift : on the 9th, Waschbank the 11th, Yermaak’s
Kraal on the 12th, and Stonehill Farm, hear Helpmakaar, on the 13th. At
Helpmakaar ‘ the permanent line from Pietermaritzburg ; to Grey town and
Dundee was met, and communication opened between Helpmakaar ■ and
Pietermaritzburg. The air line was, however, retained in use for messages to
Ladysmith, Cornelius Pieter’s Farm, and Waschbank offices, being kept open
for maintenance purposes. The country through which the air line had to bo
run was very rough and stony," and the roads narrow, and it was extremely
diffic.ull work to execute, especially with the, roads blocked by troops. ,
The. permanent line' through Helpmakaar was repaired to Eeith on the
I4lh.May, to Dundee on the 15th,.and to Glencoe on the 16th. While the
njarch via .Helpmakaar was in, .progress the sth Division proceeded along
the'railway from Elandslaagte, reaching Wessel’s Nek on the ,15th, Wasch-
bank on the 17th, and Glencoe on the 18th, the railway telegraphs being put
in order,.in advance, Dannhauser was opened up on the 17th. Newcastle on
the’ 18th, and Ingogo on the, 19th.
The . 4th Division marched along the road to Newcastle, arriving ,at
Quagga’s Kirk Farm on the.24th May, Kabalar.on the 25th, Ingogane on the
26th, and Newcastle on the , 27th. ‘ A party under Lieutenant. Hildebrand
repaired the permanent road line as the troops proceeded. Air lines were
erected from Newcastle Telegraph Office to the;, camp,'from Ingogo Drift to
Ingogo Hill, and from Ipgogo Drift, to Mount Prdsbe'ct.
29. THE MARCH TO UTRECHT.
{Diagram 10.)
Oh the 28th May Captain Boys began opening the line from Newcastle
towards, Utrecht for the march of the sth Division "to that, town, whilst
Lieutenant Hildebrand .commenced an air line which the move
of the 4'th Division in a parallelcolumnwa Stales Drift to the same place.
Captain Boys opened an office at Wool’s Drift that night, at Deer’s Farm
(8 miles from Utrecht) on the following day, and at Inkuba Spruit on the
30th. These places were served by spurp from the permanent line. Lieu-
tenant Hildebrand opened Offices at Cattle Drift on the' 28th, and at Stales
Drift and Inchanga Drift on, the,.291h.. The 4th and sth Divisions both
marched back to Wool’s Drift on the Ist June.
Oh the 2nd Jhne the 4th'Division proceeded to Coelze’s Farm, where, an
Office was opened for them on the main line from Newcastle to Ingogo, while
the slh Division moved to De Wet’s Farm, and were placed in telegraphic
communication,by a continuation of the previously erected air line to Ingogo
Hill. An office was opened at Firmstones, near Ingogo Hill, for the use of
the Headquarter Staff.
30. THE ADVANCE ON VOLKSRUST.
(Diagram 10.)
On the 6th Ju'ne a turning movement in the' direction 6f, Botha’s Pass round
Laihgs Nek was"begun, { A cable''line was run, which .was replaced by air
lirie. Van was reached by cablbon the morning,of the 7th, and on the
same day the air dine arrived" at Yellowbdom Farm with the sth Division.
Offices were opened at both these places. The line was prolonged to the top
of Bdthas Pass J ou thd Bth, and to Gansvlei on the lOth. - The assault of
Allemands Nek took place on the llth, add an office was opened thereafter
dark. The march was continued the. next day, and the air line run as far as
Joubert’s Farm, about 4 miles from Yolksrust. On the 13th the remainder
of the 'force occupied -positions on the railway at .Charlestown and ;Yolksrust,
•with the. Headquarters at Laings Nek; Offices were : opened at these places on
the.'permanent wires,, and the temporary line via Botha’s Pass;was recovered
under escort. An attack was, made by the Boers, on the party dismantling
the 1 line near G-ansvlei; - a portion of the line at this point had to be
abandoned.
D 2


On the 16th June a column proceeded to Wakkerstrom, halting for the night
at De Jager’s Drift, and reaching Wakkerstroom on the following day. They
returned via Houtnek. Offices were opened at these three places by means of
spurs from the permanent line.
31. THE ADVANCE TO STANDERTON.
{Diagram 11.)
*
On the 20th June the 2nd and sth Divisions advanced towards Standerton.
An office was opened on the railway line at Zandspruit on that day, and at
Markgraafspruit and Paardekop Station on the 21st, Katboschspruit,
Platrand, and Standerton were opened on the 22nd. Sir Redvers Buller
fixed his Headquarters at Standerton on the 23rd.
At Standerton the main road line of telegraphs crosses the railway, and
was again encountered. They were found to be in working order to Yolks-
rust, but cut beyond Standerton. Lines were run from Standerton to the
Headquarter Camp, and to the 2nd Division, and 3rd Mounted Brigade.
Interruptions occurred to the road and railway wires on the 25th and 27th,
which were caused by Boers. Parties were sent back to repair them.
On the 30th June General Clery left Standerton for Greylingstad, and
reached Weasel's Farm, where an office was opened. On the Ist July he
arrived at Waschout Spruit, and on the 2nd at Greylingstad. On the 4th
July Vlakfontein was opened. On the sth a repairing party proceeded
along the line towards Heidelberg, and met, at Kraal, a similar party sent
from the other side, and the lines were put through to Johannesburg.
While the Headquarters of the Natal Army remained at Standerton a
number of other offices were opened in the neighbourhood for various
purposes, viz.:—Yetpoort, Platkop, Holgatfontein, Waterval Store, Waterval
Bridge, Neuedale, Zuickerbosch, Grootspruit, Yaalgap, Yaal, Ylaklaagte
Kroomdraai, Leeuwspruit, Mooimeisjesfontein, Meerzicht, and Graskop.
Parties had many times to retrace their steps to mend breaks caused by the
Boers.
32. THE JUNCTION WITH LORD ROBERTS.
{Diagram 12.)
General Buller’s advance towards Belfast commenced on the 6th August,
when he proceeded from Paardekop on the Natal railway to Meerzicht, where
an office had already been established on an air-line. The column moved
to Amersfoort on the 7th, to which place a permanent line ran from the main
Natal road line near Zandspruit. The march was resumed on the 9th, after
a day spent in driving the Boers from their positions at Amersfoort, and
reached Klippaal Drift that day, and Beginderlyn the next, at each of which
places offices were opened. After two days further march, General Buller
arrived at Brmelo on the 12th August, at which place the column came in
contact with the permanent telegraph line between Barberton and Standerton,
which was used for communications. Three days afterward?, at Twyfelaar,
the column met a cable line run out by Lieutenant Mackworth from Wonder-
fontein on the Belfast railway for the purpose of getting in touch with
General Buller, and so came in direct communication with Lord Roberts, who
was directing the advance of troops eastwards along the railway.
33. ADVANCE EASTWARDS TILL JUNCTION WITH
GENERAL BULLER.
{Diagram 12.)
On the 23rd July Lord Roberts left Pretoria by train for Hatherley and
Wolmarans to superintend the operations canned out by Generals lan
Hamilton, Pole-Carew, and Prench, on the east, against the Boers, who had
taken up a position covering Elands River Station.
The direction of the telegraph arrangements was in the hands of Captain
Crookshank, who had Lieutenants Moir and Macfie to assist him. . Offices


were opened at Heatherley and Wolmarans, on the Middelburg road line, for
the use of the Headquarter Staff.
On the following day the road line, which was found completely destroyed,
was extended by an air line to Elands River Station. The Commander-in-
Ohief proceeded as far as Yandermerwe Station by rail. His telegrams were
dealt with at an office which was established at Donkerhoek. As the road
line eastwards from Elands River was beyond repair, it was decided to
connect it by air line to the railway, and to continue the telegraph by means
of the railway wires. Bronkhorst Spruit was opened on the 24th. The
railway wires between Bronkhorst Spruit and Balmoral were found badly
damaged, and cable had to be laid part of the way. Balmoral was reached
on the 25th, and the telegraphs worked well into Pretoria all night. The
repair of the railway wires was attended with much difficulty owing to the
ground near the railway being intersected with spruits, and necessitating the
wagons making long detours.
The force halted at Balmoral on the 26th. Here Captain Crookshank was
joined by Lieutenant Mackworth with a cable detachment which had laid a
line from Waterval, on the Pietersburg railway, for General lan Hamilton’s
march eastward, north of the railway. Lord Roberts returned to Pretoria,
and the advance was directed by General Pole-Oarew. On the 27th, the
telegraph line was opened as far as Brugspruit, an office being left at
Balmoral. Captain Crookshank was directed to proceed to .Middelburg to
get into communication with General French, who was marching from Rietvlei,
near Irene Station, on the Johannesburg railway, through the country south
of the Lorenzo Marques railway, and whose arrival at Middelburg had been
reported by an orderly. On the 28th Captain Crookshank, with two operators
and a lineman, left Brugspruit by road for Witbank, and thence proceeded
on a railway trolley to Groot Oliphant Station, where he met General French’s
aide-de-camp, who had important messages for the Commander-in-Chief. A
temporary office was established at Groot ' Oliphants Station, and these
messages were sent off to Pretoria. Captain Crookshank then continued his
journey to Uitkyk, where he opened a temporary office to report to General
Pole-Carew, and reached Middleburg the same day. An office was opened at
Middleburg Station. The remainder of the telegraph sections were escorted
into Middleburg on the evening of the 29th, and the office was removed into
the Government telegraph building.
On the 30th July a cable was run by Lieutenant Mackworth from Middelburg
to General Gordon’s Cavalry Brigade at Erfdeel, on the Klein Oliphants
River, about 6 miles south of the railway and 12 miles from Middelburg.
On the Ist August General Gordon advanced to Grootpan (30 miles) and
was served by a cable of 7 miles run from the railway at Wonderfontein.
The railway wires between Middelburg and Wonderfontein were put in order
the same day. As Wonderfontein was not then considered a safe place to
hold, the cable to Grootpan had to be relaid from a place about 3 miles
further back (west).
On the 3rd August Lieutenant Macfie left Middelburg for Pretoria, having
been wired for in connection with the operations under Lord Kitchener near
Rhenoster River, in the Orange River Colony, where he laid 25 miles of cable
westwards from Kopjes Station.
On the 4th a cable line was run from Pan Station to Bankfontein, a farm
5 miles north of Pan, which was then about the centre of the cavalry position
extending over a large front from the Oliphants River south-eastwards to
Grootpan. On the Bth August the cable to Grootpan was extended to
Grootlaagte, 2 miles west of Grootpan, for General French.
As the operations progressed further east, it became necessary to provide
more wires in rear, so that offices on the line of communication might not
interfere with the work for the front. An additional wire was completed to
Groot Oliphants River on the 9th and to Pan on the 11th. A second wire
was also run from Elands River Station, where the road line had been
abandoned for the railway wire. Both these wires were completed to
Wonderfontein on the 21st August, and were subsequently prolonged as the
Army advanced eastwards. 1
D 3


On the 10th August Lieutenant Mackworth was sent fbfward’ with 'cable
from Grootpan to Strathrae Farm, 7 miles to the "south-east; with the object
of opening up communication with General Buller, who. was..then i believed to
)be fnarchihg on Carolina. Grootlaagte was closed and the Cable recovered.
Oh . the 13th a heliograph message from General Buller was received 1 at
■Strathrae, which indicated his presence, near Twyfelaar, about 8 miles south.
"Oh the 15th Strathrae was closed, and the. cable /prolonged ; 'to. Twyfelaaf,
bringing General Buller into, direct communication with the rest of the forces
operating in this district. Twyfelaar office worked double current through
the cable and railway wires to Middelburg, and, as might be expected,
transmitted a large amount of important work. Major Hawkins, who had been
with General Buller’s force, then assumed the command of .the. telegraphs in
the eastern area.
Bankfontein and Grootpan were closed on the 18th, and ,an office opened
on the Twyfelaar cable line* at Klipfontein for General French’s use. This
office was shifted later; in the day to Goedhoop. On the 19th' a permanent
office was opened at Wonderfontein, and on the 20th the cable, to Twyfelaar
was replaced by air line as far as Grootpan.
34. MARCH TO BARBERTON, LYDENBURG, AND KOMATIEPOORT.
(Diagram 12.)
Field Marlial Lord Roberts, with his/Headquarter Staff, left Pretoria on
the 24th August/to resume the combined operations which were to be further
pushed on eastwards against Machadqdorp, Lydenburg, and Barberton.
■'Major (local JjieutV-Colbriel)' Curtis, 'who was placed in charge of the tele-
graph arrdrigemeiltM for this aid Vance; accompanied Lord Roberts with a
telegraph operator in the Cbmmander-in-Chief’s train, for the purpose of
putting him iff telegraphid'communication Vfherever the train'stopped. Hear
Pan l Station : the%ires ; werb tapped,And a message was at bncA received to say
that Belfast had been occupied during the morning. - The Headquarter train
reached Wohderfonteih-that night.
bn the 25th; the Headquarters moved to Belfast, where preparations had
been With'the'Headquarter messages. ‘(There was a through
circuit from Belfast' to Pretoria working Wheatstone, a,. local to Middelburg,
and a temporary line to Generals Buller and French atHeluk. In the
evening, orders Were issued for General French to move across from the right
to'‘the left flank; General Buller to move towards Dalra'aiiutha; ’ General
Pble-Carew to march north for ; a few miles ; from Belfast, and then eastwards.
All these forces Were to be kept in telegraphic touch with Belfast. Lieutenant
Mackworth (with General French)-was ordered ‘to come ! in with his cable
'section from Geluk to 1 Belfast, refit with - cable,;and rejoin HeneiM French.
Captain Crobkshank’with a portion’ of a sectibh was' tb keep communication
with General Pble-Carew, who moVed from Belfast: " Captain Boys was
directed to continue with his section, and keep Genethl' Buller ’ in touch.
Lieutenant Moir received instructions to continue-running-two hew wires
along the railway permanent poles.
An,air line had been erected, from Wonderfontein Southwards to a place
called Grootpan. On General Buller’s advance it had been prolonged to his
Headquarters at Yan Wyk’s Ylei, and on the 23rd of, August tb;Geluk. On
the 24th this air line , was continued westwards till, it Struck ; the Belfast-
Carolina permanent line; to which it was joined.
On the 26th a cable followed General Buller’s column -to- Wahikraal, and on
the next day to Bengendal, on the raihvay, where, after,the action which was
fought at that place, a connection was made to.the permanent railway line.
On ihe'2Sth August Captain Boys opened offices on. the railway at Bal-
'mauutha and Machadodorp through which places General Buller l marched.
On the ,25th August General French, who Was with General Buller at Geluk,
moved across the. line at. Belfast as ordered. Lieutenant -Mackworth, after
..refitting at Belfast, connected the cable to- the Dullstrbbm permanent line just
north of Belfast, and followed General French. On the 26th General French
and the cable reached Schwartzkoppies; on the 27th-L’ake'hvlei ;-oh -the 28th


El and sf ontein; on the 29th-the heights at Doornhoek overlooking Waterval
Onder. One of the first messages that passed announced.the release of .1,800 ,
British prisoners from Nooitgedacht.., General Dole-Oarew, who had left Belfast
on the,26th, followed the same direction as that taken by General French, and
made ..usepf the same,cable. He arrived at IVatqrval Onder:on,the 29th.,
The next phase in the operations comprised , the, advance of General Buller
on Lydenburg and General lan Hamilton’s turning movement from Dullstroom.
General Buller was on the 30th August at Ylakfontein, near Helvetia, where ah
office was established for him on a cable line run out from Machadodorp. At
Ylakfontein he crossed the cable line running from Belfast to Waterval Onder,
which had been laid for General Trench’s march of the 25th to the 29th, and
was, therefore, able to interchange messages with that officer.- On the 31st
General Buller moved to Shoeman’s Kloof, v and on the Ist September to
Badfontein, to which places the cable line followed him. Meeting at Bad-
fontein with considerable resistance from the Boers, who-held a very strong
and commanding position in front of him, General Duller waited until. General
lan Hamilton arrived on the, right flank of the Boer position. The, Boers
then gave way and the troops marched into Lydenburg (6th September), and
the cable was runfnto the town.
General lan Hamilton left Belfast for Lydenburg to turn the right flank-of ,
the Boers’ position near Badfontein. He reached Scbwartzkoppies on the
3rd September, and Dullstroom on the 4th, being served telegraphically by ,
spurs from the permanent line. On the sth he came within signalling distance
of General Buller, and in contact with the Boer position afßa(ifontein..
On the 9th September General Buller marched east from Lydenburg to the
Mauchberg, and on the 10th to Spitzkop. The cable was run out to the
Mauchberg, from which place heliographic communication was to
Spitzkop. Nelspruit fell into British hands on the 18th, and the permanent
line from Pilgnmsrust to the Sabi River gold mines, ngar Spitzkop, which
had been hurriedly extended for war purposes by the Boers to Nelspruit, , was-
used for communication with General Buller.
General Buller’s subsequent march from Spitzkop through Pilgrimsrust to
Krugerspost, and thence to Lydenburg, was servedffiy the permanent telegraph
line which runs through those places.
On • the 10th September Lord Roberts’ Headquarter Office was moved to
Machadodorp, whereJt remained till the capture of Nelspruit on the 18th.' If
remained at Nelspruit two days, after which Lord. Roberts! returned to
Pretoria.
The: third;phase of the .events,in the Eastern Transvaal resulted in the
capture of Barberton and Kaapsche Hoop. General Trench moved back again
to the south side of the railway from Waterval Onder via Dalmanutha, and
reached, Carolina on the, 7th September. A permanent line ran to Carolina
from, Belfast, which, after being put into working order'sufficed for his com-
munications. He then marched on Barberton, reaching Silverkqp on the 9th,
followed by. cable. .At Silverkop, am action was fought, and on-the 10th the
cable was cut by Boers. • Communication with General Trench was, therefore,
lost until he, reached Barberton on the 14th, where touch was regained by
means of the permanent line, to Kaapsche Hoop, GeneraL Hutton moved
from Dalmanutha on the Bth September, and marched on Kaapsche Hoop on
aline about halfway, between General, Trench’s track and. the railway. On
the following day he, struck the permanent line between Belfast aud Barberton,
where ap r office was opened for him. ; ;His subsequent, march to Kaapsche
Hoop.took a, north-easterly, direction, which, led him too far away from.the
telegraph line for it to be of any use to. him.
Generals Pole-Oarew .and lam were in the meanwhile advancing
through Nooitgedacht. and Godwaan on Kaapsche Hoop,-arid arrived at the
last named; place on the 14th September. An air line with two wires was
erected -between;. Godwaan and m Kaapsche Hoop,'which placed them’.in
communication with the telegraph:systein, and at 1 the same-time brought
General Trench (at Barberton),into; touch.again,
General Pole-Carew then moved from Kaapsche Hoop, and, after three days
march along the telegraph line to Barberton, arrived at Nord Kaap Station,
D 4


on the Barberton Railway (17th September), while General French came in on
the railway wires at Avoca.
During the fourth phase General Pole-Carew marched along the Delagoa
Bay Railway to Komatipoort, stopping at Kaapmuiden on the 20th September;
Malelane on the 21st; Hector Spruit on the 22nd; Tenbosch on the 23rd;
and reaching Komatipoort on the 24th. Offices at all these places were
opened by Captain Orookshank. On arrival at Komatipoort, the Lorenzo-
Marques line through the Portuguese territory was found to be in good
working order.
35. OPERATIONS NORTH OF PRETORIA.
{Diagram 14.)
On the 29th August a section of the Telegi’aph Division under Lieutenant
Hildebrand left Pretoria to join General Paget’s force, which was operating
in the district on either side of the Pietersburg Railway, north of the
Magaliesberg Hills.
General Paget was then at Warm Baths, but the section received orders at
Pienaars River Station to await there the arrival of General Pluraer’s force,
which was intended to surprise and capture a Boer cattle laager near the
head waters of the Elands River.
This column proceeded on the night of the 31st to Kameel River, about
13 miles east of Pienaars River Station, being followed by cable, and in the
afternoon of the following day moved about 4 miles further east, to Rust-der-
Winter, the line being prolonged to that point. On this occasion about
miles of heavy fencing wire, laid on the bush, was utilised to eke out the
telegraph material, which had run out.
On the 3rd September the section returned to Pienaars River Station, and
hearing that the Boers had heavily attacked General Paget at Warm Baths,
continued its march on the 4Lh to that place.
During the subsequent days, which were spent in marching southwards
with Colonel Hickman’s column, the permanent wires were put in order as
far north as Warm Baths.
On the 13th September Colonel Hickman moved to Hebron, about 14 miles
west of Waterval, in co-operation with a similar movement of General Paget’s.
A mixed line, partly air line and partly cable, was run out from Waterval to
Hebron. The cable was replaced by air line the following day, and on the
15th the line was extended to Roodekopjes, on the Crocodile River, about
20 miles from Hebron, whither the whole force proceeded the same day.
It was intended to effect a cavalry reconnaissance from Roodekopjes
northwards towards Jericho, but the Boers threatening the railway from the
east, led to the withdrawal of the troops to Waterval, and to the dismantling
of the Roodekopjes telegraph line. A forced march was made by the infantry
from Waterval, and by the cavalry from Pienaars River, to endeavour to
envelop Erasmus’ laager at Wagen Drift. Accordingly a telegraph line was
laid from Waterval to Wagen Drift (24 miles) which was completed on the
22nd September, and an office opened. Nine miles of air line was erected
that day by one detachment.
On the 24th the force moved to Sybrands Kraal (6 miles), and the tele-
graph was prolonged to Elim, and on the next day completed with barbed
and other fencing wire to Sybrands Kraal. A further supply of matex’ial
having arrived from Pretoria, the line between Waterval and Sybrands Kraal
was made good on the 3rd and 4th October.
Erasmus's commando having retired to Witnek, the column moved on the
sth to attack it. The telegraph line was prolonged 20 miles to Ylaklaagte.
An office was opened there on the 6th. A severe thunderstorm destroyed the
line, and a portion of it was recovered on the 7th, and taken with the force
to Nooitgedacht, whence on the 9th October a cable line was laid to General
Plumer, who was at Rietfontein, 13 miles south-west. This cable was picked
up on the 10th, and taken with the column to Doornkraal, where a connection
was made by running a cable line to Eerstefabrieken, on the Lourengo
Marques railway, a distance of 16 miles. On the 11th the column moved


along the Eerstefabrieken cable line to Franzpoort, and an office was opened
there during the day, but moved to the powder factory at Eerstefabrieken
at night.
On the 13th October General Paget moved to Waterval, and General
Plumer to Derdepoort. The cable was reeled up between Doornkraal and the
powder factory and laid between Derdepoort and Waterval. On the 15th
Colonel Hickman was in the neighbourhood of Sybrands Kraal. The line
to that place was therefore repaired and the office re-opened,
Doers having been 'reported to be in force at Jericho, the party at
Sybrands Kraal were recalled, and the telegraph section was concentrated
at Pienaars River, Sybrands Kraal office was, however, kept open for
Colonel Hickman’s use. A line to Jericho was begun on the 20th, and
continued on the 22nd to Makapans (16 miles) through thick busb, which
made erection very laborious. On the 23rd Jericho (25 miles) was reached.
On the 27th General Paget arrived with reinforcements, and the line was
prolonged into his camp at Synkop, 3| miles further on.
On the 28th General Paget received orders to march his whole force on
Rustenburg. As there was insufficient telegraph material to reach that
distance, the section returned and dismantled the line to Pienaars River, and
there received orders to rejoin General Paget at Rustenburg by rail and
road via Pretoria. They arrived on the 3rd November, and were then
directed to join General Broadwood at Magato Pass. A party proceeded
with General Broadwood, and joined General Paget at Bulhoek on the 6th,
repairing the Rustenburg-Zeerust permanent line as far as Woodstock, and
teeing off that line at Woodstock with a cable line to BuJhoek, and opening
an office there.
On the 7th the cable to Bulhoek was recovered, and on the Bth
another was laid to connect General Paget, who had moved to Rhenoster
Doom, with General Broadwood at Boschoek, while the party left at
Rustenburg erected an air line between Rustenburg and Boschhoek
(13 miles).
On the 21st November General Paget received orders to return to
Waterval and march against Yiljoen and Erasmus at Rhenoster Kop, A
party of the Telegraph Section which had remained in that district accord-.
ingly concentrated at Waterval, and re-erected the line to Wagen Drift, and
had the office at Sybrands Kraal again working on the 26th November, in
time for the arrival of General Paget’s force.
On the 27th November an advance was made against Rhenoster Kop in
co-operation with General Lyttleton from JVliddelburg. Loopspruit was
reached on the 27th and Haartebeestefontein on the 28th, a line being laid to
these places from Sybrands Kraal. The Boer position was attacked on the
29th, General Plumer making an enveloping movement on the enemy’s right,
accompanied by a cable cart which kept him in touch with General Paget.
The Boers evacuated the position, which was then occupied by the British
force. On the 30th a line was run froin Rhenoster Kop to Bronkhorst Spruit,
on the Lourenyo Marques railway (27 miles), to afford a more direct
communication with Pretoria.
The Boers still being found in the triangle between the Wilge and
Oliphants Rivers, another co-operative movement was arranged between
General Paget and the Middelburg force, in pursuance of which General
Paget moved on the 9th December to Englische Doom (13 miles), a cable
being run for him from Rhenoster Kop.
As General Paget decided permanently to occupy a rather extended
position at Rhenoster Kop, a telephone exchange was established at that
place, consisting of six branches to the various outposts. This was in
working order by the 16th December.
Instructions were received on the 15th December for a mounted brigade
under Colonel Hickman to move to the west of the Pietersburg railway in
co-operation with the troops in the Rustenburg district. A cable detachment
was sent with the column to keep up communication with Rhenoster Kop.
The column reached "Waterval on the 17th, having repaired the Sybrands
Kraal line, and on the 19th moved to Hebron, the old line to that place being
put in working order.
E 25137. J]


v General Plumer’s column left Rhenoster Kop on- the 28th December for
Groenfontein, with the; object of proceeding to Pienaars River and thence
north-eastwards round the Boer position at Warm Baths, but the orders were
suddenly changed, and a move was made on Jericho on-the 31st, 'as the Boers
were said to be desirous of breaking back' northwards through Boschpoort,
near Rustenburg.
; Makapans ; was reached at 9 a.m. that morning,; 14 miles of cable having
been run from the railway, and an office left for the use of the following
troops. The cavalry reached Kalkbult, 12 miles further on, at 10 p.m;, and
the cable was prolonged to that place. Jericho was reached at Kb a.m. ; on
• the Ist January, but owing to the excessive rains the ground was .covered
with water,[rendering the cable unworkable.
A start was made on the 2nd for Beeste Kraal, on the" Crocodile River, and
.16 miles more cable was laid, but the ground still being under-water, it was
found useless to prolong it further, so as much as. could be; recovered was
reeled up and taken on with the remainder to Kaffir Kraal, on the Hex River,
and a line run from there to Boschpoort, to communicate between the.infantry
and the advanced mounted troops. .The Boers had evidently changed their
intention of breaking through, northwards, for there were no signs ;of any
enemy at Boschpoort.- On the 6th they were located south of the/MagalieS-
berg, in the Hekpoort Valley.. The column : therefore marched
and. Commando Kek on Hekpoort, opening an - office on the'Rustenburg line
at Boschfontein at mid-day on. the 7th, and at Commando Kekdn .the evening,
and laying an air-line to Bultfontein and- Scheerpoort on the Bth, where
temporary offices were established. The cavalry halted.opposite Hekpoort Nek,
to which place a cable was run, and the infantry rested at Hartebeestefontein,
thus completely, blocking enemy’s.advance to the north-east, and allowing the
co-operating columns to.come in touch.;
Being penned in between. General. Plumer . oni .the. north-east. and General
Gordon on the south T west, the. enemy broke away south-east, and- after an
ineffectual attempt being made to head them off at Mooiplaats; to;which
place a cable was run,-succeeded in crossing the Johannesburg railway at
a point between Kaalfontein and Zuurfontein.
36. OPERATIONS WEST OF PRETORIA.
Early in August 1900, Lord Kitchener left' Pretoria' for : Kopjes; Station,
in the Orange River Colony, to conduct the operations' : cbnnected - vVith / the
pursuit'of De Wet, who was then being very active in destroying' the railway
in the Orange Colony.- Lieutenant Macfie was directed to accompany him
with a cable detachment;
Lord. Kitchener marched-to Wonderheuvel (16 miles)"bn the sth August,
and to a'farm called-Bloemfontein' (12 miles)' oh’ the :6th,’to both of which
places a cable was laid communicating with Kopjes Station."/ '
' De Wet retired northwards towards the Vaal, and Lieutenant Macfie, hot
having enough cable to continue following the pursuit, reeled up what had
been laid and proceeded with it by rail to Krugersdorp. Lord Kitchener
passed near Vredefort, and the town office of that place was opened on the
9th of August to dispose of his work.
' An attempt to head off De Wet -Was being made by General lan Hamilton,
who was at Kaalfontein' about 28 miles west of Krugersdorp. A cable line
was laid between these two places on the 13th'-by Lieutenant Macfie in order
: that co-operation betweenthe-Britishforces’ should be more certain. Several
important messages -passedj- but the'cable was cut by the. Boers on the
. following day, and was recovered with difficulty, as the 1 column returned to
Krugersdorp by a different route.
On‘ the ’3oth "August the telegraph section left Krugersdorp by .rail for
Welvefdiend Station to join General " Hartm and on the -following days was
occupied in Restoring the telegraph line between Bank; Station and predrik-
stad,‘which had been, and Was" still being destroyed by the JJoers. Qn the
!ii loth‘and L2th two separate attempts .were"made to, ; get\ihe wire .repaired to
Potchefstfdom, but the party was attacked on both occasions by Boers and
had to retire.


•On the'l6th• September Fredrikstad office was opened for General Hart,'
but four days later the line was out by the Boers, who were' between
Welverdiend and. Fredrikstad, and who were shelling the latter place; -Am
office was. established at Oberholzer, on the 11th October, • between Bank
and Welverdiend Stations, and communication with Fredrikstad was restored
on the 19th. This place remained in and out of communication for six days,
being hotly attacked by Boers from all sides. A column came to the relief
of Fredrikstad on the 25th, and the line was again put in woi’king order, and
on the 29th it was opened as far ; as Potchefstroom.
An office was opened at Mooi River Bridge on the railway about 2 miles
north of Potchefstroom on the 6th November.
On the 11th November communication was established, by means of the
permanent line (which had been repaired) with General Douglas at Yentors-
dorp. On the 14th the Klerksdorpwire was repaired under escort as' far as;
Machavie Station, and on the 15th as far as Koekemoer Station; Klerksdorp
was put through oh the 16th, on which day General Douglas’s column arrived
from Ventersdorp.-
On the 25th November a cable was run from Klerksdorp to Coal Drift,
which was subsequently replaced by air line. This station was the first, of a
series established to guard the drifts over the Yaal eastwards from Klerksdorp.
Another post was fixed at Yermaas Drift, and served by a line from Koekemoer,
on the 27th November. This line was carried, across to the south bank of, the
river. As the system of r telegraphs required in this neighbourhood,/was'of
some extent. Lieutenant' Mackworth' was sent from Pretoria to assist ,in ;
erecting them. The Yermaas Drift line was prolonged to Wolmarans Drift
on the Ist December.
On the 3rd December Lieutenant Mackworth,completed a cable Mine from
Welverdiend to Buffelsdoorn —a post on the Gatsrand Hills—at, which place,
a telephone was fixed.. Lieutenant Macfie, temporarily prolonged this line by,
cable on the 4th December .towards the Losberg Hills for a reconnaissance,
made by General French in. that direction, and at the same time the cable!
between Welverdiend and Buffelsdoorn was replaced by air line.
A line from Machavie to Dupreez Drift was completed on the 6th. December,
and another from Bank to Modderfontein on the,, 9th. r Modderfontein,,was
another outpost on the Gatsrand.
A telephone exchange was installed at Potchefstroom having five branches,
to the various “forts”., around ;the town. .. It! was begun on the 15th.
December and completed on the 19th December.
A third! wire was erected bn, the railway poles from Krugersdorp to
Potchefstroom, the accommodation afforded by .the existing , wires proving-
insufficient to serve the numerous offices that had been , opened in the
neighbourhood of Potchefstroom.
On the i-X9th December; a line was Maid Tygerfontein,. on iitho-
Potchefstroom-Yenterskroon' permanent Mine, to Rooi Kraal; another post,
on the observation, line, which . now: extended from Coal Drift, near
Klerksdork, in a north-easterly direction nearly to Johannesburg.
Kooksoord, a station on the railway between Krugersdorp and' Banks, was
opened as a telephone office .on the 22nd December;
On the 26th December, a column started from Potchefstrobm, reaching
Buffelsdoorn. that night 1 and ; Witpoortje on the 27th. : At the latter place
a spur was run to the Potchefstroom -Ventersdorp permanent line, and an
office opened. l On the 28th the column arrived at Yehtersdorp. On the
29th Witpoortje was re-opened for General French.
37. GENERAL FRENCH’S OPERATIONS EASTWARDS TO
PIET RETIEF.
{Diagram 16.)
At the end of January 1901 several columns, under the command of
General French, moved eastwards from various points on the Lourencq
Marques and Natal Railways, with the object of clearing the country between
E 2


the two railways, and of enveloping the Boers who had concentrated near
Ermelc. Three cable lines were started to keep them in communication, one
under Lieutenant Moir, from Wonderfontein, for General Smith-Dorrien;
one under Lieutenant Bannerman, from Balmoral, for General Paget; and
one under Lieutenant Mackworth, from Springs, for General French’s
Headquarters.
Owing to De Wet’s threatening attitude, on the Cape Colony frontier,
Paget’s column was withdrawn from the operations, and moved into the
Cape Colony. The cable detachment told off to him was moved to Middei-
burg to accompany Colonel Campbell’s march from that place.
The cable detachment under Lieutenant Moir left Wonderfontein with
Smith-Dorrien’s cblumn on the 29th January, and paid out cable as far as
Strathrae, but returned to Wonderfontein on the following day, the orders
for the movement having been altered. The advance took place on the
3rd February, when General Smith-Dorrien again left Wonderfontein and
arrived at Twyfelaar (17 miles), where an office was opened on the cable
line. On the 4th February the column reached Witrand, and on the sth
arrived at Chrissiemeer. The cable was prolonged to these places, and
communication maintained up to midday on the sth, but the Carolina
commando, which was watching Smith Dorrien’s left flank, destroyed the
cable line, and communication with Pretoria was lost.
Lieutenant Bannerman, with Colonel Campbell’s column, left Middelburg
on the Ist February, and ran 12 miles of cable to Bankfontein, prolonging it
on the 2nd to Roodepoort. This line worked till 10 a.m, on the 3rd, -when
it Was likewise cut by the enemy, who removed 4 miles of it.
Lieutenant Mackworth left Springs with General French’s headquarters on
the 28th January, and laid a cable line to Strypan (10 miles). On the 29th it
was continued another 10 miles to Oipherfontein, and was in use during the
engagement at Boschmans Kop. It was cut and repaired on that day, but
cut again on the 30tb, when the Boers removed over a mile of it, and
remained watching the gap. As it was evidently not going to be of any
further use, 10 miles of it were recovered and taken on with the column.
The various columns under General French did not keep up their communi-
nications with the rear, as supplies were to be sent to them from the Natal
Railway line. As a consequence of this their cables were inevitably cut
behind them by the enemy, and could not be repaired, and so they remained
out of telegraphic communication with Pretoria.
* Attempts were made to get into touch with General French on his arrival
at Bethel bv means of the nermanent line from Standerton. This succeeded
v x
for about an hour, but as the line was in front of our positions, and held by
Boers, it was immediately cut.
Another attempt was made when General French reached Ermelo, and
although Serjeant Oadwell and a lineman made a very gallant effort to get
through from Standerton to Ermelo via Bethel, they found Bethel had been
re-occupied by the Boers, and were taken prisoners.
The next opportunity for effecting communication with General French
occurred when he arrived at Piet Retief, To meet this Lieutenant Macfie was
sent, in anticipation, from Standerton, with both air line and cable, via New-
castle and Utrecht, to continue the permanent line between the two latter
places by a field line to Piet Retief. Heavy rain had fallen for several days,
and the country was a swamp, the roads hilly and almost impassable, and the
rivers flooded. Transport difficulties were enormous, but Lieutenant Macfie
succeeded in getting the line through to the Pongola River at Luneburg on
the 26th February, where he was met by a line run under similar difficulties
from Piet Retief under the direction of Lieutenant Mackworth.
This line gave great and continual trouble owing to convoys breaking it,
and to the sadden nature of the ground interfering with the insulation of the
cable. It was 65 miles long, and extremely busy, owing to arrangements
having to be made by it for General French’s next moves, as well as for the
working of the convoys, and because the weather and the state of the country
had prevented arrangements coming off as they had been planned. In addition
to this, it was necessary to have on it a larger number of offices than could
possibly work satisfactorily. There were so many military posts along it


requiring communication for transport purposes. Great credit is due to
Lieutenant Moir, Lieutenant Macfie, and Lieutenant Mackworth that it worked
at all. The following offices were opened on it:—
Knight’s Farm, 4\ miles from Utrecht, from 19th February to 20th
February.
One Tree Hill, 7 miles from Utrecht, from 19th February to 16th March.
Pivaanspoort, 14 miles from Utrecht, from 20th February to 21st
February.
Elands Nek, from 21st February to 16th March.
Uitkomst, from 25th February to 7th March.
Chakaspruit, from 25th February to 15th March.
Pongola River, from 26th February to 7th March.
Intombi River, from 20th February to 15th March.
Marienthal, 17 miles from Piet Retief, from 17th February to 16th
March.
The maximum number open at one time being seven. The line was
recovered on the 16th March, after one had been, opened between Dundee and
Yryheid (described below).
Although communication between General French and Pretoria was not
obtained, after the failure of the original lines, until the establishment of the
Utrecht-Piet Retief line on the 26th Februaxy, the cable detachments managed
to keep up internal communication between the various columns with some
success.
On arrival at Chrissiemeer on the sth February, Lieutenant Moir found that
the permanent lino to Ermelo was in working order, and, on General French’s
reaching that place on the 6th, communication between him and General
Smith-Dorrien was established. General French remained at Ermelo until
the 11th February. During this time Lieutenant Mackworth ran a cable line
to General Allenby’s camp at Uitspan, 20 miles south, which worked well.
General Smith-Dorrien left Chrissiemeer for Liliburn on the 9th February,
and was kept in communication with General French at Ermelo by means
of the Chrissiemeer-Steynsdorp permanent line. This column reached
Weltevreden on the 10th and Craigielea on the 11th, still using the Steynsdorp
wire as far as Isabelladale, and then connecting it to a cable line 10 miles
long.
General French left Ermelo on the 11th, and moved south-west to Uitkomst.
He was followed by cable, which was prolonged the next day to the Yaal
River, a total distance of about 14 miles. As, however, General Smith-
Dorxnen’s line was crossed by Boers on the 12th and destroyed, there was no
use prolonging General French’s line any further.
General Smith-Dorrien,arrived at Amsterdam on the 14th February.
Colonel Campbell’s column had already arrived there earlier in the day, and
Lieutenant Bannerman had been able to hold a conversation with a Boer
operator at Piet Retief, who, however, was too cautious to commit himself to
any interesting statements. It indicated at least that the line to Piet Retief
was in working order. General French reached Piet Retief on the 16th, and
communication with him was re-established.
General Smith-Dorrien remained at Amsterdam from the 14th until the 25th
Februaxy. During this time offices were opened at the various places on the
Piet Retief line as follows :
Camp near Amsterdam (Smith-Dorrien), from 17th February to 25th
February.
Compies River (Smith-Dorrien), from 25th February to 26th February.
Wolvekop (18th Hussars and Campbell), from 18th February to 26th
February.
Krom River or Derby (Alderson), from 17th February to 20th February.
Shela River (Campbell), from 25th February to 27th February.
Rustplaats (Alderson), from 20th February to 28th February.
Schwabe’s Store (Smith-Dorrien), from 27th February to 15th March.
The Amsterdam line was finally abandoned on the 15th March, all the
columns having marched into Piet Retief. It worked very well.
E 3


The day after General French arrived at Piet Relief (the 17th February);
a line was laid by Lieutenant Mackworth to General Allenby’s camp at
Zandbank, a point on the Assegai River, 15 miles south-east of' Piet Retief.
Owing to the state of the roads and rivers this line was not completed until
the 18th, It was prolonged by Lieutenant Bannerman 8 miles further, to
Mahambasherg, pn the 2nd March. Another line, 21) miles long, was run on
the 15th March to General Knox’s Headquarters at Annyspruit on the west.
An intermediate office was opened on this line at Goedtrouw for Pulteney’s
column. The line to Mahambasherg wap recovered on the 24th March, and
relaid to Potgieter’s Farm, where’an outpost under Major Laming was
watching the roads. The office at Goedtrouw was moved to Anhalt on the
20th March, to which place a cable, £ miles long, was’ run from the Anny-
spruit line. Anhalt was closed on the 21st, and a telephone office was
opened at Weebersdrift, which was held by two companies of the Suffolk
Regiment until the 12th April,
The columns began to move from Piet Retief on Yryheid on the 17th
March, but the office remained open till the 13th April. The line to Yryheid
had been considerably damaged, and was patched with cable at various
places. Qffipes were opened pn it at the following places fqp the use pf the
cojugmp, :-r-r
Swartwater, from 21st March to 22nd March.
Spionkoppie, from 24th March to 9th April.
Normandie, from 21st March to 24th March*.
Niedefland, from sth April tp 9th April-
dagddrift, from 18 th Match tQ sth April-
Paulpietershurg, frpm 13th March to 7th April-
. fiyaape Bridge, from 23rd March tp 2nd April-
Zingopns JJSfek, from 24th March to 25th March.
Lancaster Pfill, frpm 3Qth Marph tp 13th April,
Welgevonden, from 26th March to 27th M arc h-
Before the cable line between Utrecht and Piet Retjef was taken np, it
had been decided to erect another of pi? line between Dundee and Yryheid to
paeet (general French wh e C he arrived at that town, the permanent line tp it
from Utyepht haying been completely destroyed. Accordingly Lieutenant
Macfie left Utrecht on the sth March for De Jagers Drift, and established
communication between that place and Dnndep by the 7th- He completed
’tp Yryheid on the 9th, a distance pf 4Q The Boers were then arid
between Paulpietersburg pnd Yryheid, so communication hy telegraph
beyond Yryheid was not obtained until the first of General Lrenph’s columns
entered the town on the 25th March, Qn the following day General French
held a successful conversation with Lord Kitchener at his house in Pretoria,
•vid Dundee and Standerton. Intermediate offices were, opened on the Dundee
line, - at- Doornberg, a signal station 6 miles from De Jagers Drift, op the
Bth March; and at Eoodekoppie, a military post on the Bipod River, on the
Ifith, Yryheid office, was, closed on the 14th*April, when General French left
it for Lpndee. The line was recovered at the same time, Roodekoppie being
closed on the 15th April.
38. GENERAL PLUMER’S MARCH TO PIETERSBURG.
{Diagram 17,)
On the 2Qth March Plgmer’s column left Pretoria, for the purpose of
occupying Pietersbprg, and of making further subsequent, movements from
that town. Captain Hildebrand’s section was detailed to proceed with it.
There is a line of telegraphs, across the veld.t ? between Pretoria and Pieters-
•burg, in addition,to the one along the railway- The former is on wooden
poles, and had suffered considerable damage. A party set out several times
to repair it, but owing to its distance from the line'of General piumer’s
march, and to the swampy nature of the country, they found it impracticable
to do ad in the time available. The railway telegraphs were; howeyer,
restored. They been broken at various places along the line.


Warm Baths Was occupied oh the 30th March, and the telegraph office
opened; On the same day an advanced office was established at Buiskdp, 6h
a cable line run out from the railway;
On the Ist April the Column moVed to Nylstrodm, and ah office was
opened at that place. Kaboom Spruit was reached Oh the 3rd, the foad line
from ; Kylstrodm being used for the mid-day halt, but abandoned for the
railway line at fdaboom Spruit;
Oh the 4th April the column matched to Moor ddrift, and Were in Commnni-
catidn by the railway wires at onCC; Pietpotgietersrust was occupied on the
sth without opposition, and an office opened at the station; The Column
halted at Pietpotgietersrust on- the 6th, and intermediate Offices were opened
at Kyi Bridge, near Moorddrift, and at Groot Kyi Bridge, near Kylstroom.
The column advanced on the 7th to Marabastad; The road line) was used
to keep up communication during the march with Pietpotgietersrust and
with the armoured train working between the two places. The march struck
the railway again between Lunsklip and Rotterdam. A party was sent back
along the railway to restore as far as the armoured train. This was done by
9.30 p.m. that night, so that the column at Marabastad was through to
Pretoria by the railway wires.
Pietersburg was occupied on 'the Bth, the telegraph office in the town being
Opendd. On the 9th a local circuit was run to the camp, putting the General
in direct communication with Pretoria.
On the 14th April General Plumer marched southwards from Pietersburg
to co-operate with General Sir Bindon Blood in a scheme for clearing the
country between Pietersburg and Middelburg. He halted on the 14th at
He Gladde Klipkop, a farm about 6 miles south-east of Smitsdorp. About
7 miles of the Pietersburg-Smitsdorp permanent line was used, and continued
by 13 miles Of cable. This cable line was prolonged to Ghunespoort on the
15th (6 miles), and to He Beers, and Bathfont, on the Oliphants River
(25 miles), on the 16th.
General Plumer subsequently continued his march south, but as he came
within the sphere of General Sir Bindon Blood’s operations, for which other
telegraphic arrangements had been made, the line to Bathfont was not
continued any further.
39. OPERATIONS UNDER GENERAL SIR BINDON BLOOD.
{Diagrams 17, 18.)
The general scheme of Sir Bihddh Blood’s operations to the' north of the
fielagoa Bay Railway Was, in conjunction with General Blumer from
Bietersburg, to concentrate from three directions towards Boos Senekah
Lieutenarit Macfle, who had returned from the Dundee-Vryheid line, was
Sent, with tWo air-line detachmedts and soine cable, to Gydenburg to join
General W. Kitchener’s column, which was about to operate in a north-
westerly direction from Lydenburg. He proceeded to Machadodorp by rail,
hdd marched thence towards Lydedburg, repairing several breaks in the
'Machadodorp-Lydenbtirg line Caused by Boers, and principally due to the
fadt that one of the military posts established to guard the line had been
withdrawn.
On reaching Jan Gowitz Barm (7 miles from Lydedbiirg), od the 15fh April,
hd received a message from General Kitchener, who had already left Lydenburg
and arrived at Boschoek, 10 miles from Lydenburg, that he whs to Idy the
telegraph from Jan Gowitz Barm id two directions, one to Lydenburg add
the other to Boschoek. This was done that day, placing General W. Kitchener
id communication with Lydenburg and Pretoria.
This line was Continued on the 16th to BosChfontein, another 10 miles
further north-west, and prolonged to RietfonteiU (10 miles) on the 7th, to
Steelpoort (14 miles) on the 18th, add to Magnet Heights (10 miled) on
the 19th.
General W. Kitchener left this line tin the 25th April and proceeded
southwards, coming eventually in touch with the forces operating northwards
from Middelburg, and the lide Was recovered shortly afterwards.

Meanwhile arrangements had been made to follow up the columns under
Colonel Beatson and Colonel Benson, who left the railway at Middelburg on
the 14th April. The general direction of these movements was under
General Sir Bindon Blood, and Captain Boys was attached to his staff as
Assistant Director of Telegraphs.
Lieutenant Turner had immediate charge of the telegraph which accom-
panied Colonel Beatson. He opened a telegraph office for him at Rietspruit,
5 miles north-east of Middelburg, on the 15th April, on the ruins of the
Eoos Senekal permanent line. On the 16th he left Colonel Beatson’s column,
and joined that of Colonel Benson at Bankfontein, 6 miles further on the
Roos Senekal line, where he opened another office.
On the 18th this column advanced to Hoedspruit, 14 miles from Bank-
fontein, leaving a military post at Elandslaagte midway, for the purposes of
guarding the line. Offices were opened at both these places.
. On the 19th Klipsptuit (6 miles) was reached, and on the 20th they
arrived at Blinkwater (14 miles).' The office at Blinkwater remained opened
till the sth May, a portion of which time was occupied in expeditions to Eoos
Senekal and the Tantesberg. On the 25th April the lino was repaired into
Roos Senekal, which was occupied by Colonel Pultenej-’s column.
On the sth May General W. Kitchener arrived from the Magnet Heights
at Rooikop (between Klipspruit and Hoedspruit), and an office was established
for him there.
By the 7th May all the offices oa this line except Bankfontein had been
closed, and the columns marched back to Middelburg. Bankfontein was
closed on the 12th May.
A second series of operations to the south of the Delagoa Railway, under
Sir Bindon Blood, commenced on the 10th May, with the object of clearing
the Komatie Valley. The main portion of the force proceeded south from
Wonderfontein. Colonel Pulteney’s column made a wider sweep from
Middelburg, while General Spens remained in the neighbourhood of
Kaapschehoop, to act as a stop, to prevent the Boers in the Komatie
Valley from escaping north-east.
It was General Bindon Blood’s intention to have one line of telegraph from
Wonderfontein to Carolina and beyond, and that another should be started
from Machadodorp, so as to be ready for him when he had passed beyond the
limits to which the first line could be maintained.
Lieutenant Moir was placed in charge of the first line, while Lieutenant
Macfie was detailed to construct the second, and also to run a line from
Kaapschehoop to TafelsKop, where it was intended that General Spens should
lay in wait. Lieutenant Mackworth was instructed to follow Colonel
Pulteney, not to keep him in communication with the railway, but to be
available to connect him with General Blood when the former had got to
within a .certain distance of Carolina, and to be useful for internal
communications.
The lines from Wonderfontein and Machadodorp were begun on the
15th May. The latter was run to Dwaalheuvel that day, to Uitkomst on the
next, and to Driehoek on the 22nd. The former line was laid to Strathrae
on the 16th, and to Lilliefontein and Carolina on the 17th, a total of
25 miles.
On the 19th a cable detachment ran out a line from Carolina towards
Chrissiemeer, and met a party sent out by Lieutenant Mackworth, and
communication with Chrissiemeer was obtained that day. Lieutenant
Mackworth proceeded from Chrissiemeer along the Steynsdorp line ,on the
following day, and opened an office for Colonel Pulteney at Lelieburn. A
few days afterwards he established four more offices on this line, namely,
Holnek, Brandybel, Tygerkloof, and at General W. Kitchener’s camp near
Brandybel. After reaching Tygerkloof, Colonel Pulteney’s column advanced
northwards on the 27th May to the Komatie River, a cable line following
them, and offices being opened near Steynsdorp and at Komatie River.
The column returned on the 29th May and marched'back via Amsterdam
to Carolina, arriving at the latter place on the 21st June. An office was
opened for it at Bonniebreas on the 10th June, on the Steynsdorp line.


After arriving at Carolina, a cable line was laid between that place and
Groblersrecht (10 miles), in order to keep Colonel Pulteney in touch while
he proceeded to that place to meet Sir Bindon Blood, on the 23rd June.
This line was extended to Witkranz on the 26th and to Yaalbank on the
27th. Yaalbank remained open till the Ist July, when the line was recovered,
and the column marched to Middelburg.
General Blood moved from Carolina to Barneveld (14 miles) on the
22nd May, a cable line being laid, which was prolonged on the 23rd to
Silverkop, on the 24th to Boschoek, on the 25th to Doompoort, and on the
26th to Witkop or Yergelegen, a total of 45 miles.
On the 27th a heavy thunderstorm occurred which destroyed 30 yards of
cable between Witkop and Doompoort.
The column returned on the 28th, and the cable was reeled up as far as
Silverkop, which was kept open until 3rd June for a military post, under
Major Cockburn, of the 2nd Royal Berks. This post was removed on the
3rd to Nooitgedacht. Nooitgedacht was closed on the 7th. General Blood
returned to Carolina on the 31st, and camped Just outside in Groenvallei,
where a vibrator office was opened for him.
On the 2nd a line was teed on to the Silverkop line and run to
Mooifontein, about 11 miles to the south, with the intention of connecting up
with the Steynsdorp line, and of bringing Colonel Pulteney’s force into
communication with Carolina. A connection was made with the Steynsdorp
line, but the line was cut beyond, and communication with the stations
beyond was not effected.
On the 14th June General Blood moved to Smutsoog, on the Ermelo road,
and a cable line was ran from Carolina to that place, which remained
working till the 18th June, after which the columns returned to Middelburg.
The line from Wonderfontein to Carolina remained working until the
11th July, when, being no longer required, it was dismantled.
General Spens’ presence near Kaapschehoop being no longer required, he
and Colonel Benson were employed in a combined movement into the valley
of the Houtboschloop, north of the Elandsfontein Station, on the Delagoa
railway. General Spens proceeded north-west from Nelspruit, while Colonel
Benson moved along the Lydenburg road from Machadodorp. Lieutenant
Mactie accompanied the former, and a detachment under Serjeant Essam
went with Colonel Benson. Lieutenant Macfie made use of .the permanent
line from Nelspruit, and opened offices at Boschrand on the 10th June, at
Heidelberg on the 11th, and at Tweefontein on the 12th, the last being on
an air line run out as a spur from the Nelspruit-Spitzkop line, which was
prolonged to Rietvallei on the 13th, to Blandshoogte on the 15th, and to
Weltevreden on the I6th. About 15 miles of line were run. General Spens
returned from this point to the railway at Alkmaar.
Serjeant Essam paid out a line from between Badfontein and Witklip, on
the Lydenburg line, to Rietfontein, on the 11th, and to Lissabon on the 12th,
a total of 11 miles. Lissabon remained open until the 17th. During the
return of Colonel Benson’s .column to the railway a line was run out from
Zwartzkoppies to Houtboschfontein (about 12 miles) on the 22nd, and
prolonged to Somerset (4 miles) on the 24th.
40. OPERATIONS IN WEST OF ORANGE RIVER COLON Y.
{Diagrams 19, 20.)
, During the months of May and June 1901 there was a considerable amount
of activity in the western portion of the Orange River Colony on account of
the evident intention on the part of the enemy to move southwards from the
Yaal. It was decided that the most satisfactory method of dealing with
this movement was to hold a belt of country about 30 miles in width,
stretching from Bloemfontein to Modder River Station. It was felt that
the success of the steps taken to check the Boers would be to a large extent
dependent upon a good system of inter-communication between the various
posts. The line from Bloemfontein to Boshof had been broken down for
. some time, but Lieutenant Lawson, starting with Colonel Massey’s column
on the 28th April, put it in order as far as Abrahams Kraal, opening-offices
e 25137. J 1


on it at Strydomspan and Abrahams Kraal, and running a cable spur to
Surrey .Dam. Bainsvlei and Daniels Kuil had already been opened on the
permanent line, and Mentjes Farm was looped, in on the 18th May.,
On the sth May an airline was erected from Abrahams .Kraal <to Kat-
doomput, and completed oh the 7th to Petrusburg. Boskop was opened on
this line on 18th June. On arrival at Petrusburg the line from that place
to Koffyfontein was found to be partially destroyed, but it was opened as
far as Dreikant on the 3rd June, looped into Erasmus Hoop on the 10th;
and restored to Koffyfontein on the 12th.
A line was commenced on the sth June from Petrusburg to Zonderzorg,
and continued to Emmaus on the 6th June. From Emmaus a.cable was laid
to Erasmus Hoop, which proved very useful during the frequent intervals
of interruption caused by the Boers to the permanent line between Erasmus
Hoop and Petrusburg. The Petrusburg-Bmmaus line was prolonged to
Leeuwfontein on the 18th June, to Kalklaagte and Middelbosch on the 19th,
and to Jacobsdal on the 20th. The portion between Leeuwfontein and
Jacobsdal was left unpolled for some weeks, as the Boers were too numerous
in the locality to render it possible.
Local circuits were constructed between Petrusburg and , Sterkf ontein,
Belfort, and the Town Kopje Fort. A cable was run to Tafelkop, 20 miles
distant, on the 21st July, for Colonel Rochfort’s column, and an air-line
erected to Doompan—a signal station in communication with Bloemfontein
—on the 2nd August. Zwartkopjes was connected by a cable of 20 miles, to
Erasmus Hoop on the 21st July. Wegdraai Drift, Kopjes Kraal, and
Blaauwbank were teed on to the Jacobsdal-Koffyfontein permanent line, and
served for the columns coming up from, the south. These worked into
Jacobsdal, as the line was broken down south of Blaauwbank. ,
On the 23rd July General Plumer’s column, accompanied by Captain
Hildebrand and his section, left Bloemfontein for Bainsvlei, re-opening the
telegraph office at that place. On the 24th they reached Lough Dearg,
which whs already in telephonic communication with Bloemfontein, and
which was provided with a telegraph instrument. This column moved on
the 25th via Klipfontein, Poplar,,Grove, Kameelfontein, Pandamfontein, to
Magersfontein. They did not keep themselves in telegraphic communication,
but the office at Boskop delivered their messages to Poplar Grove- by signal.
On the 31st July an airline was erected to Poplar Grove. On arrival at
Magersfontein they came in circuit on the Jacobsdal-Kimberley wire by a
tee of miles in length.
On the 31st July the column reached Modder River Station, and ran a tee
of one mile of cable to the Kimberley main line.
The column left Modder River Station on the 4th August for Kraakop,
14 miles souith-east of Kimberley, and were served by a cable of 14 miles
from the Kimberley-Jacobsdal wire. This cable was prolonged another
14 miles to Beisjesbult Farm on the sth August. This office was closed on
the 7th August, when the column retraced their steps to Modder River
Station, re-opening the office at Kraalkop on their way, General Plumer
remained at Modder River Station till the 15th.' As there was a considerable
amount of delay in communicating between Jacobsdal and Modder River
Station via, Kimberley, a cable was laid directly connecting those two places
by telephone. On the 15th the column proceeded via J acobsdal, Blaauwbank,
Klipfontein, Kalkdam', td Zouipaxlsdrift, opening offices at all all these places
by tees from the Jacobsdal-Koffyfontein, and Fauresmith-Luckoff line. On
the 21st a cable was run from General Plumer at Zoutpansdrift to Colonel
Jervis at Wolvekraaldam, which was prolonged on the following day to Orange
River Station. On the 24th the column was at Luckoff, where they were in
communication by means of the permanent line, and on the 27th they were at
Grootfontein, from which place a cable was laid to Phillippolis. They reached
Priors Siding on the 29th August.
41. OPERATIONS IN O.R.C., OCTOBER 1901 TO FEBRUARY 1902.
{Diagrams 21, 22.)
At the beginning of October 1901, the following columns were occupying
the south-eastern comer of the 0.R.0. in the neighbourhood of Smithfield:—


Oopeman at Zastron; Plumer at Jurysbaken, near Rouxville, Basing and
Hamilton at SmitMeld, Dumoulin at Leeuwfontein, near Zastron, Williams at
Odendalstroom, on the Orange River, Damant at Bdenburg, Western at
Willemsfontein, near Rouxville, Heath at Wolvekop, near Oommissie Bridge,
Thorneycroft at Avalon, between Zastron and Wepener, Lean at Bethulie
Bridge, Pilcher at Aliwal North,,Taylor;at Zandrift, on Orange River, Kenna
at Rouxville, Lowry Cole" at Jammersburg, near Wepener, Bogle-Smith at
Reddersburg, and Charles Knox at Bethulie. They were engaged in a
combined movement against the Boers in that locality. They were all
provided with telegraphists;,and apparatus for the purpose of tapping in on
the.lines in the district,-,
, In addition to this, the following lines were laid from the permanent line
from Bethulie to Smithfield, Rouxville, Zastron, and Aliwal North, to
supplement the existing lines. . Communication was for the most part
maintained through Aliwal North, the Bethulie-Smithfield line being cut at
the beginning of the operations:—
(1.) A cable to Pampasfontein, about 4 miles in length, from the Bethulie-
Smithfield.line,.which remained working from the 3rd October to
the 13th December.
(2.) A cable ,26 miles in length, Smithfield to Inlioek, Lichtenstein,
• and Humansrust, in a north-easterly direction (October 10th to
December 12 th).
(3.) A short cable from near Smithfield to Pilcher’s camp for the 29th and
30th November.
(4.) A cable of 2 miles, prolonged by an air line of 8 miles, from the
Smithfield-Rouxville line to Commissie Bridge and Wolvekop, south
of the Caledon River, from October I9th to December 12th.
(5.) A cable 28 miles long from Zastron to Avalon and the Elansberg, in a
northerly direction, from October 18th to December 13th.
(6.) A mixed line of 6 miles of air line and 12 miles of cable from Aliwal
North to Willemsfontein and Zandfontein (north-east), from October
10th to November Bth.
(7.) A short length'of 2 miles of cable from Aliwal North to the Dep6t at
Beestekraal.
(8.) A cable (7, miles) from Bethulie-Smithfield line to Hansfontein.
These lines served for many columns in turn.
When the operations in. this region were completed Dumoulin, Rochfort,
Hamilton, and Western went across the railway line towards Jagers-
fontein, while Basing, Major Heath, Thorneycroft, Lean, and Kenna went
northwards to take part in another combination with Barker, Marshall,
Holmes, Colonel Heath, Bulfin, and Terman. Another supplementary series
of field lines was constructed in the Ficksburg-Senekal District for these
operations as follows
(1.) A cable, line of 35 miles in length from the Winburg-Ladybrand
permanent line to Wesselsral, Olocolan, and Spitzkop.
(2.) A cable line of 22 miles connecting Spitzkop with Ficksburg.
(3.) , A cable line of 5 miles from the above to Pekadrift, on the Caledon
River.
(4.) A cable line of 12 miles from Spitzkop to Harmonia (a station on the
Ficksburg-Senekal line).
(5.) A spur from the last mentioned line to Wesselsrust.
(6;) A cable from Ficksburg to Bloomplaats of 14 miles.
(7.) A cable of 12 miles from Ficksburg to Morning Star.
(8.) A cable ofj3s miles from Harmonia to 'Yanderventersrust, Helderfon-
tein, Groenfontein, Roodekrank, Welgevonden, Bezuidenhoutskraal,
and Liliefontein.
(9.) A cable of 7 miles to Fairview from the Ficksburg-Senekal line.
(10.) Another of 6 miles from the same line to Kaffirskraal.
(11.) A cable of 22 miles from Senekal along the Winburg line to bridge
gaps in permanent line.
(12.) Cable from Naudes Kop to Bethlehem, 17 miles, run twice (34 miles).
(13.) Cable from Wittekop to Tigerskloof, 10 miles.
(14.) Bethlehem to camp 6 miles N.W; of town.
F 2


(15.) Various cable spurs off Winburg-Yentersburg line amounting to
4 miles.
(16.) Cable Witklip to Rexford, 8 miles.
42. OPERATIONS UNDER GENERAL PLUMER NEAR WAKKER-
STROOM, OCTOBER 1901 TO FEBRUARY 1902.
{Diagram 23.)
General Plumer left the Orange River Colony, where he had been taking
part in the combined movements in the south-east, on the Sth October 1901,
and arrived at Wakkerstroom on the 12th. A cable was laid to his camp on
that day, which on the 13th was extended to Oastrol’s Nek, and bn the 14th
to Naauwgevonden, a total distance of 18 miles.
From Naauwgevonden a telephone line was laid to the signal station on
Necklace Hop, which was prolonged to Geluk (8 miles). The cable from
Wakkerstroom to Naauwgevonden was picked up, and the blockhouse
telegraph line from Wakkerstroom to Schwaabs Store, on the Swaziland
frontier, was used as a base from the cable lines subsequently laid were
started.
The next line that was run was from Zuikerhoek to Spruitfontein, in the
Slangapies Mountain. This was done on,the 22nd October. On the 23rd
one of 9 miles was run to Goedhoep, and on the 26th October a march
was made down the Pongola Valley as far as Pongolabosch, to which a cable
of 12 miles was run, and offices opened on it as occasion demanded.
The column remained in touch with the blockhouse line until the 23rd of
November, when it started on a march from St. Helena to Mooihoek and
Grootfontein, a cable of 29 miles being laid from the blockhouse line during
the march.
On the 28th the column moved to Brereton, and the Grootfontein cable
having been reeled up, another was laid to Brereton. On the 3rd December
the column was at Kraalhnek, to which a line was laid from Amsterdam.
This line was extended to Beelzebub and Yoskop on the 4th and sth. A
march to Mooipoorb was made on the Sth December, where the Headquarters
of the column remained till the 16th,
During this interval the line to Yoskop was recovered and relaid from
Wakkerstroom to Mooipoort, and subsequently prolonged through Groot-
fontein to Rotterdam, a total distance of 49 miles.
From Rotterdam General Plumer marched via Familiehoek and Palmiet-
fontein to Roodepoort, from which place a cable was laid into Yolksrust.
After this General Plumer again went to Rotterdam, and thence to Reitspruit,
and a spur was laid to his camp from the Wakkerstroom-Rotterdam cable at
Groot Valley. He remained at Reitspruit from 16th February to 23rd February.
On the 25th he was at Rolfontein, and in communication by cable to
Amersfort, and with General Bruce Hamilton at Kromhoek. Amorsfort was
working via the permanent line to Zand Spruit and Yolksrust.
43. OPERATIONS UNDER GENERAL BRUCE HAMILTON, NEAR
ERMELO AND VRYHEID, DECEMBER 1901, TO APRIL 1902.
{Diagram 24.)
The permanent line from Standerton to Bethel and Ermelo having been
repaired and put in working order at the beginning of December, was used
as a means of communication with General Bruce Hamilton’s columns during
their operations in this district.
Several minor cable lines were laid connecting the different camps with
General Hamilton’s Headquarters. On the 20th December a cable was laid
to Blaauwkop, on the Upper Yaal, prolonged to Bankop on the 21st, taken
up on the 25th, relaid on the 29th, and prolonged to Davidale, 45 miles, on
the Ist January 1902.
It remained working until the 9th January, when it was again reeled up.
On the 22nd January a cable was laid from Ermelo to Smutsoog (19 miles),
and on the 24th another was paid out from Klipstaple, a place on the
Smutsoog line, to Tweefontein, 18 miles west.


On.the sth February a third line was put down between Ermelo and
Bankop, which was maintained till the 25th February. On the 27th one was
laid from General Hamilton’s camp at Kromhoek to that of General Plumer’s
at Eolfontein, which was in communication via the Amersforfc line with Zand
Spruit and Yolksrust.
On the 6th March General Hamilton arrived at Vryheid to conduct another
series of operations towards the Zululand border, during which the following
cables were laid :
(1.) Yryheid to Yaalbank, Goudhoek, and Riddersdale, in an easterly
direction (35 miles), from 9th March to 26th March.
(2.) Yaalbank to Wintershoek (8 miles), 14th March,
(3.) Yaalbank to Muselfontein (9 miles), 23rd March to 25th March.
After this, General B. Hamilton returned to Ermelo.
44 OPERATIONS IN WESTERN TRANSVAAL UNDER GENERAL
IAN HAMILTON, MARCH 1902 TILL 31ST MAY 1902.
( Diagram 25.)
Towards the end of March 1902 several columns assembled in the
neighbourhood of Klerksdorp with a view of acting in combination against
the commandos under General De la Rey. These columns were at first
directed by the Commander-in-Chief from Pretoria, but were later on under
the immediate command of General lan Hamilton.
Three cable detachments were sent to carry out the requisite telegraph
facilities. One under Lieutenant Prickett accompanied General "W". "Kitchener’s
column to Driekuil and Katboschfontein, and afterwards through Doombult,
Shritfontein, and Kareeput to Yryburg, and back to Klerksdorp. Another
detachment under Lieutenant Gandy followed' the movements of Colonel
Kekewich’s force from Yaalbank through Middelbult to Driekuil, and to
Slypsteen and Dornbult. The third detachment, under Lieutenant R. B.
Turner, was attached to Colonel Rawlinson’s column, and connected up to the
Klerksdorp-Wolmaranstad permanent line from Rhenoster Spruit and laid a
cable from this line to Doornfontein and Witpoort, and thence to Bultfontein,
Kareekuil, and Brodricksvlei. This detachment subsequently laid a line from
Brakspruit, on the Klerksdorp-Buffelsvlei blockhouse line, to Brakpan,
Palmeitfontein, and Boschpoort, for General lan Hamilton and Colonel
Thomeycroft, and when this column marched to Devondale Siding, on the
Mafeking railway, connected Scott’s and Brigg’s camps to Devondale and ran
a line to Tarantaalkraal.
The following is the ■ detail of the cable lines laid during these
operations:—
1. Klerksdorp to Reitkuil, Haartebeestefontein, Oorbeitjesfontein, Wilde-
beestelaagte, Reitvlei, and Driekuil, 45 miles.
2. Driekuil to Klipdrift, Welverdiend, and Katboschfontein, 35 miles.
3. Rhenoster Spruit to Colonel Rawlinson’s camp, on 31st March, 3 miles.
4. Klipfontein to Zendelingsfontein, 6 miles.
5. Klipfontein to Doornfontein and Witpoort, 25 miles.
6. "Witpoort to Bultfontein, 15 miles. .
7. Driekuil to Kareekuil, Dornbult and Brodriksvlei* 34 miles.
8. Goedgevonden to Colonel Cookson’s camp, 6 miles.
9. Shritfontein to Colonel Lowe’s and Colonel Thorneycroft’s camp, on the
9th May, 12 miles.
10. Kareeput to Colonel Lowe’s and Colonel Thorneycroft’s camps, on 10th
May, 16 miles.
11. Yryburg to General Kitchener’s camp, on the 12th May, 4 miles.
12. Devondale Siding to Colonel Scott’s and Colonel Briggs camps, on the
11th May, 10 miles.
13. Devondale Siding to Tarantaalkraal, 17 miles,

.Offices were opened at all these places for various periods, and worked well.
The field lines were of great value, especially at the action of Moedwill, where
plans had suddenly to be changed, and which resulted in the recapture from
De la Bey of Lord Methuen’s guns.
' These operations were the last carried but before the signing of the terms
of surrender on the 31st May 1902!
45. BLOCKHOUSE LINES.
{Diagrams 26 to 65.)
The era of blockhouses was ushered in about the beginning of 1901.
Previous to this there had 1 been many blockhouses built to guard dangerous
points on'the railway, such, as bridges, which offered vulnerable spots to the
enemy for destruction. At this period, however, it was decided to protect
the railways more systematically, by a continuous chain of blockhouses
throughout their entire length. The safe running of trains to base ports was
of vital importance to the Army, and, the Boers, encouraged by the success
which had attended their raids on trains and on the permanent way, were
making themselves very objectionable on qur lines of communication!
Accordingly the principal railway lines were protected by blockhouses
extended at intervals of about 2,000 yards. These railways were the one
from Pretoria to Norvals Pont, the railway to Natal, and the Lourengo
Marques railway. Every second or third blockhouse was to have a telephone
enabling it to communicate with certain centres, for the dissemination of
information and fqr the obtaining of succour in the case of need. .
This naturally threw a considerable amount of extra work on the Army
Telegraphs, and necessitated the provision of a very large amount of additional
telegraph material and telephones.
So much success attended the erection of these blockhouses, and so greatly
were the Boers hampered in their movements on account of themj that it was
decided to increase their number on the lines already constructed,! so as to
reduce the interval to about 1.000 yards, and also to builds others across the
open veld to further restrict the freedom of the Boers. So colossal was the
scale on which this scheme was carried out that the whole of South Africa
became one vast network of them, as a glance at the skeleton map of block-
houses will show. Every line of blockhouses was profusely provided with
telephones, and in most cases with a certain proportion of telegraph offices,
thus enabling information or orders to be quickly communicated to any
particular blockhouse desired. The blockhouses, together with the.systematic
“ drives ” organised by the Oommander-in-Ohief, finished the war, as the
Boers themselves confess;
The following table gives a list of the blockhouse lines constructed, and
shows the telephone lines erected to serve them:—

* Lines marked thus were erected by Natal Government Telegraph Department,
t Those marked thus were run to posts not in connection with blockhouse lines.
The foregoing blockhouse lines involved the erection of 9,361 miles of wire
and the fixing of 1,945 telephones, made up as follows ;
Separate diagrams of the blockhouse telephone lines are given for the
Orange River Colony, Cape Colony, and Natal, but those constructed in the
Transvaal are shown on the general diagrams of the various Inspectors’
sections, as they were in this latter Colony so intimately connected with the
general telegraph system that separate diagrams would not convey the
required information concerning them.
The working of the blockhouse telephones had naturally to be left to the
individuals composing the garrisons, no attempt being made to specialise
men for the purpose. It was feared at first that, in the absence of a little
preliminary instruction in the working of telephones, there would be some
trouble, but, though a few stupidities did occur, they were not frequent, and
the men in the blockhouses learnt to appreciate the value of what was their
only communication with the outside world and were careful.
Advantage was taken of the construction of a line of blockhouses between
Klerksdorp and Mafeking to effect another outlet from Pretoria to the
Cape. A through wire was erected besides those required for the block-
houses, which was extended from Mafeking to Kimberley by the Postmaster-
General of the Cape. Previous to this the Transvaal had but one wire to the
Cape running via Nerval's Pont to De Aar, where a fast speed repeater was
fixed, affording direct communication with Cape Town. The line between
Klerksdorp and Kimberley, by which all the Transvaal-Cape traffic used to
circulate previous to the war, was still in the hands of the Boers at
Wolmaranstad. The possession of only one route to the Cape was hazardous
and insufficient. It was very long, and liable to many interruptions from
storms, and also used frequently to be shot down by the fire from our own
blockhouses along the railway. It necessitated the imposition of heavy
charges on private telegrams for the purpose of keeping their number within
the capacity of the line, which was generally pretty fully occupied with
military telegrams. Both for the sake of additional safety from breakdown,
and also to provide the rapidly growing commercial community of Johannes-
burg with better facilities for telegraphing, the new outlet was constructed.
It had hardly been completed a month before peace was signed. The
cessation of*hostilities enabled the reconstruction of the Fourteen Streams
line, and on the Ist August 1902 the ordinary tariff charges on private
telegrams between the Transvaal and the Cape was resumed.

The last blockhouse line, upon which work was still being done at the
conclusion of peace, was the one between Victoria Eoad and Lambert’s Bay
(Cape Colony). This was 374 miles long, and two wires were being run
along its entire length. It was still in an unfinished state when the war
ended, a gap of about 70 miles being left between Oalvinia and Williston.
The difficulties of transport and supply in this remote region, and the scarcity
of water, made the construction of this lengthy line of blockhouses a
somewhat slow process. It was begun on the 30th December 1901.
46. TELEPHONE EXCHANGES.
{Diagrams 64 to 78.)
In addition to the extensive system of blockhouse telephones described in
the foregoing section, nearly all of the principal towns and places in military
occupation were provided with telephone exchanges enabling the Commandant
to communicate with his outlying fortified posts, and also with the heads of
departments.
There is no doubt that telephone exchanges form a most important, if not
indispensable adjunct to war administration. Their use in connecting
together fortified posts with the Commandant of the place need not be
enlarged upon, but another very great sphere of utility lies in the facility
they afford for inter-communication between departmental heads. In
operations on a large scale, as in' the present campaign, not only must the
subdivision of labour and of responsibility be multiplied, but also it is
inevitable that the various offices of the heads of departments must be
scattered over a large area. "When time is of great moment, and orders and
instructions communicated verbally, a telephone exchange gives efficiency
with which the cost is wholly incommensurate. But in no case was the
pernicious system followed of employing clerks to transmit messages, except
such as were of very minor importance, and then only in exceptional cases.
The following is a list of telephone exchanges established, giving the
number of branches in each. The Pretoria and Johannesburg Exchanges were
in existence before the war, but as they were taken over and added to by the
Army Telegraphs, they have been included in the list:—

* Not all erected by Army Telegraphs.
Some of these exchanges were double-wire, exchanges iand, some single.
The Johannesburg and Pretoria Exchanges were on the three-wire system.
The total amount of wire involved in connection with these exchanges was
4,105 miles, of which 1,789 miles was erected by the Army Telegraphs.
47. THE PERMANENT TELEGRAPH SYSTEM.
Although before the Army entered the Orange Free State, in February
1900, the Army Telegraphs worked a small system of its own in Cape Colony,
as described in section 1, yet the development of the Army Telegraph system
did not really begin until Bloemfontein was reached by Lord Robert s Army
on the 13th May. , From that time it grew till eventually it embraced all the
telegraphs within the conquered States, by which time about 3,378 .miles of
poles and 9,395 miles of wire belonging to the late Republics had fallen into
our hands. The great majority of these lines had been sadly wrecked by the
Boers during their retreats, and were of course completely disorganised'and
the offices deserted. - The work of restoration was proceeded with pari passu
with advance of the Army by the field telegraph sections in a temporary
manner, and completed and improved subsequently by the lines of com-
munication telegraph sections. -The system grew gradually, and had to be
organised gradually, and the organisation was modified from time to time to
suit new conditions.


From the date of the entry into Johannesburg (29th May 1900) it became
evident that the country -would have to be divided up into two subordihate
administrations, namely, , the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal, not only
because the extent of the country warranted it, but also because the local
conditions varied, and required individual treatment by a- local responsible
head. Two officers were therefore appointed Assistant Directors of Akny
Telegraphs, Captain ;J. S.- Fowler, D;S.O.-,- for the Grange River Colony, land
Captain E. G. Godfrey-Faussett for the Transvaal. Although at one time another
Assistant Director was appointed .to control the telegraphs required for the
movable columns in the Transvaal during some of the more important com-
bined movements, yet when the war generated into ithe pursuit of small bodies
of 'Boers by individual columns, it- was found best to make : the Assistant
Directors of the two new Colonies immediately responsible for the organisation
of the temporary lines fun for this purpose; for to a‘great extent they could
be; regarded as parts of the general telegraph system, and the disposition.ol* the
circuits and the arrangement of the traffic was best controlled in this mariner.
Later on, when the blockhouse lines began to be constructed in a wholesale
manner, it became necessary to appoint two other Assistant Directors, one for
Cape Colony and one for Natal. The Natal District, under Major H. B. H.
Wright, comprised the northern portion'of that Colony the southern portion
not being the scene of activity on the part of the -enemy. The Harrismith
district of the Orange River Colony was also put under Major Wright, because
a railway from Ladysmith made it more accessible from Natal than from
Bloemfontein, and also because the wires from Bloemfontein to Harrismith
could not be maintained intact on account of the number of Boers in theißeth-
lehem and Senekal districts. Captain R. H. H. Boys, was placed in charge of
Cape Colony. The portions of this Colony which were the seats of disturbance"
was very widely extended. . This involved a corresponding large amount of
field telegraphs and extensive blockhouse lines. - The Assistant Director in Capel-
Oolony had business everywhere, and had to work in harmony with the Post
master-General, whose system interlaced with that 1 of the Army Telegraphs.
Each of the Assistant Director’s divisions were subdivided into Inspectors’
districts, and the organisation generally was made to Approach as nearly as'
the circumstances would admit to that of the postal telegraphs in England.-
The subjoined table gives the Inspectors’ districts and ’the staff comprised in
each, on the date of the cessation of hostilities. The comparatively few numbers
allotted to field columns indicates the close of the war. -The table also shows
the number and description of the instruments working-at that time :

The diagrams,(Nos. 84 to 97) show the arrangements of the circuits at the
close of the war. Diagrams Nos. 80 to 83 give various phases in the growth
of the Army Telegraph System, and must be considered to represent temporary
arrangements of circuits to suit the requirements at the time. Some of the
principal field lines erected to supplement the system are also shown in these
phase diagrams.
The Transvaal had a through wire working to Pietermaritzburg and
Durban, a wire working to Lourengo Marques via Machadodorp, and a
circuit via Norvals Pont and De Aar to Cape Town. This latter was divided
at De Aar, which was about half way to Cape_ Town, and a fast speed repeater
inserted. All three of these through wires were worked with Wheatstone
automatic apparatus, but in the case of the Lourengo Marques wire the
traffic was transmitted by hand at Machadodorp. The fast speed repeater
at De Aar was sent out specially from England, and worked remarkably well.
Just before the close of the war another route was opened via Lichtenburg
and Mafeking to Kimberley.
The Orange River Colony had'a through quadruples circuit via Norvals
Pont and De Aar to Kimberley, by which nearly all its external work
circulated, and a subsidiary outlet via Burghersdorp to Queenstown. It
had also a through wire to Pretoria worked on the quadruples system.
For financial purposes Natal was placed under the Transvaal, and Cape
Colony under the Orange River Colony. This was because the personnel in
Natal belonged to the Ist Telegraph Division, whose Headquarters was at
Pretoria, while that in Cape Colony belonged to 2nd Telegraph Division,
with Headquarters at Bloemfontein. It was also because there were only
two clearing-houses and accountant branches, namely, at Pretoria and
Bloemfontein. The establishment of these two clearing houses was intended
to facilitate the eventual transfer of the telegraphs of the two new Colonies
to their respective civil administrations, and was decided on as early as
the autumn of 1901, it being thought at that time that the war would
shortly end.
Besides the two clearing houses just alluded to there was a small financial
staff directly under the Director of Army Telegraphs dealing with payments
made to; other administrations for services rendered by them for the Army
elsewhere than in the two new Colonies, and for the transmission of tele-
grams for which, under the conventions and agreements in force, the Imperial
Government was liable.
Later on an exception was made in the case of the Army Telegraphs in
Cape Colony, and the Assistant Director of that Colony was furnished with
funds directly by the Chief Paymaster, which were accounted for on imprest.
The importance of this district from a telegraphic point of view increased
with the growth of the blockhouse system in Cape Colony. It therefore
became more convenient that separate accounts should be rendered for it.
It needed no clearing house, as that class of work was still referred to
Bloemfontein.
The pressure of traffic over the. lines was at all times very severe, and
there was always the perpetual difficulty of providing enough clerks to work
them, especially as they frequently became ill from overwork. Clerks could
nob be kept for more than a couple of months in the valley district
between Waterval Onder and Koomatipoort without endangering their health.
Frequent reliefs had therefore to be organised for that district. It will be
observed that, in spite of the frequent drafts from England enumerated in
Appendix A, there were only 691 clerks (including civilians) to work
504 instruments (vide Table 3), many of which were continuously working
night and day.
The total amount of traffic dealt with by the Army Telegraphs during the
war (see Appendix D) was: Forwarded messages, 4,040,723; received, 3,803,034;
and transmitted, 2,866,011. Counting the transmitted messages twice, these
figures represent 13,575,779 operations. Some of these messages were of
inordinate length, amounting to 6,000 words, while a very large proportion
were 300 to 400 words long. The numbers of offices opened was 1,047, of
which 174 were permanent and the remainder open for various periods. A list
of the offices is given in Appendix B.

48. FINANCIAL STATEMENT.
The following financial statement, shows the cost to the public of the
Telegraph and Telephone Services rendered to the Army by the Army
Telegraphs.
■ After debiting the account with all expenses, including; pay, engineer pay.
rations, forage, native vrages, and casualties among horses and mules; and
crediting it with the value of all stores taken possession of in the country,
which were used in the construction of the. lines handed over*, to the civil
administration on the close of the war, the cost of the services rendered to
the Army amounts to 324,2/2Z. 11s. 2d.
■ The 3,564 telephone connections would have cost His Majesty’s Government
90,882/. if provided at the usual rates for, such services by the Colonial
Governments. Deducting this amount from the 324,272/. 11s. 2d.-, the cost
of 'telegraphing the 149,441,355 words for the Army is found to be
233,390/. 11s. 2d., or about one-third of a penny per word. , The usual
Colonial rate in South Africa is Id. per word.
■ The cbst of erection of the lines put, up by the Army, as well as that of
their maintenance and working, is included in this tariff rate.
