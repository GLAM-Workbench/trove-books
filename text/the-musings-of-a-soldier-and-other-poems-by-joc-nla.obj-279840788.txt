A soldier had a little hat
He put it down one day
And when he went to pick it up
The badge had gone away.


The Musings of a Soldier.
FROM WATTLES TO WAR.
Before the war started he had a farm in
Australia where grows
“WATTLE BLOSSOM ”
Golden flower of our land,
Planted there by nature’s hand,
By soft breezes gently fanned,
In our home Australia.
As the songbirds chirp and sing,
Welcoming the coming Spring,
Wattles forth their blossoms bring,
Nature’s own regalia.
Oftimes have I climbed a tree,
Brought a sprig along with me,
Always thinking, dear, of thee,
Waiting in the gloaming.
When God, peace on earth does send,
Happy be the days we’ll spend,
Gathering blossom without end,
On our way a-roaming.
He still is on the farm when the first batch of
returned soldiers arrive. He spoke to one of
them —a pessimistic Anzac and was stopper 1
from enlisting by the Anzac’s idea of soldiering.
Oh if I had another chance
A “civie” I would be,
No more the blessed Army,
No more I’d cross the sea.
I’d walk along the public street,
The heroes I would cheer,
Then murmur “Oh you jolly fools”
And go and have a beer.
Some few weeks after he meets another
returned soldier, and from him he heard of the
landing at Gallipoli and of the death of his
former mate, a Jackeroo, who used to work
with him on an outback station.


The Musings o( a Soldier.
THE JACKEROO.
Some time ago upon the plains
A Jackeroo rode by,
He’d left a dear old Southern home
Because of someone’s lie.
Away back North where sun does shine
And plains stretch mile on mile,
He did his best as well as most,
He always wore a smile.
Through shearing and through harvest
time,
From dawn till late at night,
He did the usual stockman’s job,
He saw that all went right.
Though oft the other stockmen tried
That Jackeroo to rile
He kept his end up with the rest,
He always wore a smile.
In Hobson’s Bay the troopship stood,
Most eyes were filled with tears,
The wharf was lined with Khaki men
The sort Australia rears.
A whistle blew—the troops marched on—
The men in single file,
The Jackroo was with that lot,
And still he wore that smile.
On Anzac shore, they made their charge
The charge that’s world renowned,
Each man of them, that awful day,
His name with honour crowned.
Then nighttime came—the moon it shone
Upon a lifeless pile,
The Jackeroo was ’mongst that lot,
On his face was still that smile.
He decides to enlist and revenge the death of
his chum. As soon as he does so, he considers
all who don’t enlist are slackers.

THE SLACKER.
Have you ever thought what they’d think of
you 7
Can you answer the question “What did you do
When they asked for men for they had so few ?”
If you did—you’d take the shilling.
Have you thought when you ask a girl to tea,
A soldier’s badge she will want to see,
You’ll have none —so then why not follow me
Enlist and show you are willing.
Why wait conscription? the fact well you know
It isn’t their method to compel you to go
Join up now and then in a few days or so
I’m sure you’ll find it quite thrilling.
With thousands of men of the volunteer sort.
To help on the Anzacs who nobly have fought.
The war would be over—that’s why you ought
Join up—take a share in the killing.
Aftei training for a very short period in Aus-
tralia, he is embarked on the troopship “A 70”
LIFE ON A TROOPSHIP.
I enlisted in the Army about four months ago,
Some said that I was doing right, some
straightout they said “no,”
But still I went and did it and I earned the
country’s thanks,
By putting on the blueys as a private in the
ranks.
I learned to turn by numbers, to the left and
to the right,
It got upon my blessed nerves, I dreamed of
it at night.
The sleep I got was little for I slept upon a
board
And the man who slept beside me was a demon
when he snored;


The Musings of a Soldier.
They also taught me shooting, how to take
the double pull
But you cannot find a record where I chanced
to score a bull.
Still yet they thought me good enough to ship
aboard the boat,
A transport called A 70, the biggest tub afloat,
I thought when once I got there I could say
farewell to stew
I hadn’t been there long before I knew it
wasn’t true.
For every morn at 7 a.m. as cookhouse call
would sound,
You’d see the same old orderlies with stew
a’ getting round.
They’re gamblers most, these soldier chaps,
they’ll bet when next twill rain.
But not a man could name the odds each day
’twas stew again.
The Steward chief and Ship’s Q.M. would
look as wise as owls
Yet look annoyed and angry-like at each and
sundry growls,
But snakes alive! they made their name, the
fact is true enough,
When Sunday came and out they dished a
bonza old plum duflf.
Now plum duff, as you’re all aware, is some-
thing awful nice
But at this duff not one of us was game to
back up twice;
The reason was, I’m not too sure, but told by
one who knows
’Twas made of Para Rubber like they use to
make a hose.
At last when Easter time came round they
broke away from habit,
When Easter Sunday they gave us the wild
Australian rabbit.
Of course when saying wild I mean ’twas wild
just once I know
But all the boys were sure enough ’twas wild
some years ago.
Still, now I’m at it, let’s go on and follow up
the game


The Musings of a Soldier.
I’m fighting for my country and I hope to
make my name,
Though should I rise no higher thru a private
in the line
I trust the Army won’t for once advice from
me decline.
The advice that I would give them is “See the
men well-fed”
Then I know they’ll always follow never mind
to where they’re led.
They will prove to all the wide world what the
Anzacs first did show
That a real Australian rushes where no others
dare to go.
He gets on well with his work and is appointed
Acting Company Quartermaster Sergeant
(known as Q.M.I and before many days are
past, feels he is blamed for everything.
BLAME THE Q.M.
If the cook-house call is late
Blame the Q.M.
If there’s rabbit on the slate
Blame the Q.M.
If you’ve lost a lot of kit
If your cap has done a flit
And your “Rising Sun” with it
Blame the Q.M.
If there’s no milk in the tea
Blame the Q.M.
If the ship is still at sea
Blame the Q.M.
But if good luck be our lot
And a victory we’ve got
Then for goodness sake why not
Blame the Q.M.
He gets more and more worried with the job
and almost every day hears the same old
complaints,


The Musings of
Soldier.
COMPLAINTS.
Say, Q.M., look at these spuds
They are rotten that’s what they are,
Would you eat them yourself do you reckon?
If you got them would you say ta?
You tell him you really can’t help it,
But you’ll see there may be some more,
Then his language is good old colonial,
Livened up with proverbial gore.
The next one you pass as he’s eating
Complains that the meat’s got a taint
He dares you “to test a wee morsel
And see for yourself if it aint.”
So you simply have just got to do it,
Though your nose heavenwards takes a turn,
Oh what sins has a poor man committed,
A Q.M.’s position to earn.
Even when he goes to his own meals at the
Sergeant’s Mess he is worried over the Stew
which is put on.
THE SERGEANT’S STEW.
Like Joseph’s coat of many colors,
Stew has many a funny name,
Hash and haricot for instance
Are stew really just the same.
When in “Aussie” camps we swotted,
Lucky little did we know
Extra names our stew would carry
When a-sailing we’d to go.
Eirst time that stew made its presence
When it caught our eagle eye,
We were asked by our dear steward
“Sergeant, will you have Sea Pie?”
Next ’twas dished up in the evening
Bits of paste were placed near by,
Then our Steward gently asked us,
“Sergeant, have some Cottage Pie?”,


The Musings of a Soldier.
Thought we all, its names were ended
Couldn’t even think of one
But our minds were disillusioned
When our breakfast had begun.
Up he came, that same old steward,
Plates he carried—piled up high,
Then we nearly had hysterics,
“Sergeant, have some “Shepherd Pie?”.
Beaten then we thought the transport
No more names could they invent,
So our wise heads openly stated
After hours of thinking spent.
Judge you then our look of horror
For such form our looks did take,
When that steward up and asked us,
“Sergeant will you have “Stewed
Steak 7 ”.
The transport boat was torpedoed on Anzac
Day, 25/4/17, and there the Anzac showed
they were disciplined notwithstanding what
critics say.
■ 1 —»
THE TORPEDOED
TRANSPORT.
’Twas 2 p.m. on Anzac Day
The men were all preparing
To celebrate the glorious deeds
Of Anzacs and their daring.
When suddenly from way down aft
A loud explosion came
It seemed to lift the transport ship
Yet no one did it maim.
No sign of panic, nor of featy
No rushing to and fro,
The siren whistled long and loud,
The bugle clear did blow.
Then out the bugle rang again,
Advance this time it blew,
The men marched up like on parade,
What else could heroes do?.


The Musings of a Soldier.
’Tis good to know that still our homes
Can send along this breed
Whose only fault the critics say
Is discipline they need.
They don’t go much on dress parades,
At drill they’re only fair,
But when a time like this comes ’long,
The discipline is there.
They showed the world on Anzac Day
That still from Austral’s shore,
The fighting breed is coming still
And she will send some more.
’Tis trials like these on land and sea,
That test the heart of those
Who go to fight the nation’s wars
Against our common foes.
Picked up by destroyer boats, cold, hungry and
fed up he finally reaches port, and talking over
things to a chum his thoughts turn to home.
THOUGHTS OF HOME.
We were seated together my chum Jack and I,
We were talking of old times, of days long
gone by,
Talking of harvest and shearing time too,
And when talking of home, love, my thoughts
flew to you.
When the Kiddies are older, they’ll know what
it meant,
How sad was the parting when I soldering
went
But I sure couldn’t help it, the blood in each
vein
Would cause me to do it—to enlist once again.
I will soon be returning for God up above,
Will sustain me and guide me to those whom
I love
And when Peace comes, darling, and earth of
war rids,
I will stay home contented with you and the
Kids.

SEA SICKNESS.
Feeling like I don’t know what,
First you’re cold and then you’re hot
Well one minute, next you’re not,
Moaning, groaning, quite a lot,
Reeling like a drunken sot,
Wishing armies all to pot,
You’re not going off your dot,
Sea Sickness is what you’ve got!!!
WHAT IS A SMILE?
A smile is made,
To make “blues” fade,
And make this life worth while.
A ray of Sun,
Which comes o’er one,
And helps one o’er the style.


The Musings of a Soldier.
SERGEANT MAJOR-
PHYSICAL INSTRUCTOR.
Classes a haw!! the S.M. cries,
Each one to attention flies,
No one dares, no one even tries,
Ignore the Sergeant Major,
He is a Tommy Atkins, but,
He knows his work, he’s got a nut,
Yes, everyone that’s in our hut,
Says he’s some Sergeant Major.
Well, S.M., here’s good luck to you,
(I know you’ve had a Blighty, too)
If you my frame with strength imbue;
Then bless you Sergeant Major.
And should you, after this great war,
Come over to Australia’s shore,
We’ll greet you with “Instructor’s Haw!!”
Here comes the Sergeant Major.
MEMORIES.
Do you mind when we went a-roaming
In those days of sweet content,
When the sunset smiled on the blossoms wild
And the trees their shadows lent,
From their tiny throats came the silver notes
Of birds ’ere the day was spent.
Do you mind when we went a-roaming
Down the path where the willows grew,
When the Autumn wind, all our pathway lined,
With leaves of a copper hue,
In the dimming light of the coming night
There I told my love to you,


The Musings of a Soldier.
THE DAY (DER TAG),
The troopships steaming out in line
They form a fine array,
’Tis answer to the German’s Toast,
Hoch! Hoch! Unto the Day! I
The. men upon the transport ships
Are fighters every one,
They go to help the Motherland
To see the day is won.
From North and South —from East and
West —
From cities and from farms,
They joined the colors—volunteers,
They heard the call “To arms.”
May they come back in health and
strength
Just as they go away,
May Crown Prince, Kaiser and the Hun
Regret they see the day.

Their faces beamed, for well they knew that
for the end of day
They had two bottles of good stuff, one Carl-
ton, one A.K.
But eagle eyes from out a tent were thinking
what two “beauts”
Of soldiers they would surely make a credit
to recruits
And as he looked them over, his eyes they
chanced to rove
On the heads of those two bottles in the
pockets of one cove.
Such breach of regulations he could not over-
look
So off he sent an M.P. who the bottles smartly
took.
Within the tent the bottles stood like prisoners
in a row,
Dame Rumour says, for the A.P.M., —the M.P.
had to go.
The Captain coming in the tent, he thought he
had a trance
When such a lovely beer parade did meet his
eagle glance;
He straightway held Orderly Room, all sold-
iers should know that
When prisoners are being tried they first re-
move their hat.
Then with a patent opener, the bottles lost
their tops
And so ’tis said in whispers they were emptied
of their hops.
The A.P.M.’s decision is reserved which beer
is best
He says the case is now dismissed until
another test.

DIVIDING THE JAM RATION
Thank goodness now my job I’ve earned
Arithmetic at school I learned,
Both fractions and the rule of three,
If not alas for poor old me.
Now just for fun, you take a pound
’Mongst thirty men divide it round,
And then you’ll know just what is meant
When jam to be divided’s sent.
No more as Q-M. I will try
I’d rather let the job slip by,
But if I did, I’d clever be
And bring a thimble ’way with me.
And when the jam like this comes ’long
I’d whistle to myself a song,
And fill a thimble for each man,
Divide it better no one can.

CAPE TOWN.
Capetown, I have heard of you,
And your mount of copper hue
Sight of beauty, yes, its true,
Tablecloth a-covering.
Tons and tons of shipping there,
Women dark and women fair,
Still I wouldn’t really care
Long round you be hovering.
Give me my own native home,
Land of gum and honeycomb,
Miles across the trackless foam,
For ’tis worth hard fighting.
There it is my love I’ll meet,
Own folk too, once more I’ll greet,
How my heart will faster beat
When that dear home I’m sighting.

MENINGITIS AND THE
DOCTOR.
If ’gitis you have got
They isolate the lot
And a holiday for days they give the mob.
Then they fumigate the place,
Jab a glass thing down your face,
A.nd tickle up your throat to get a swab.
So if once you get a cold,
Walk up to the Doctor bold,
Tell him you think with ’gitis you are ill.
He will test you for a while,
Then he with a little smile,
Prescribes you for Miss Tussy and a pill.
You may laugh and you may roar,
It has oft been done before.
I expect that they will do it oft again;
If this war is to be won,
Lend our Doctor to the Hun,
Then his services will not be used in vain
For should poor old Kaiser Bill
With a cancer, feel real ill,
He’ll get Miss Tussy and a No. 9;
Then when Willie’s down and out,
Guess you’ll hear the Anzacs shout,
As they’re marching up in fours along the
Rhine.

ABSENT
YET YOU’RE PRESENT.
Feeling still that you are near,
Longing for your voice to hear,
Always thinking of you dear,
Drilling on incessant,
Still you seem quite near to me,
Though you’re miles across the sea,
Still you yet appear to be,
Absent, yet you’re present.
Nighttime, as on dusk does draw,
Still that feeling comes on more,
Oh ’twould end —this world’s cruel war,
Loneliness be lessened.
Though you’re absent, yet you guide
My errant footsteps, tempted, tried,
But I win—you’re by my side,
Absent, yet you’re present.

CHATS (BODY LICE),
In a billet in France I took off my pants
And started in search of the chats,
In corners obscure—l them did secure
Like a terrier catches a rat.
Then I off with my shirt and midst all the dirt
1 found where the vermin were hiding - ,
I got on their trails and crushed, twixt my nails
Any chats that I found there abiding.
They’re part of our life and when resting from
strife •
And barb wire tears we’re not patching,
We take off our clothes, forget all our foes.
And are soon hard at work at chat catching.
The stay-at-home boys, they miss all the joys
Of chats tickling them ’neath their nightie.
Thank goodness that we can hope to be free
Of chats when on leave in old Blighty.
WIND UP.
Have you ever had the wind up?
What! you haven’t bless my soul,
You’ve never yet been frightened,
Bv old Fritz’s box of coal ?
Oh. I’m sure you’re only joking
And of fear you’ve had some pangs
When you’ve ducked and he’s just missed vou
With his nasty old whiz-bangs.
What, you’ve never had the wind up
When a-pit a-pit a-pat,
His machine gun’s firing at you,
On the ground, you’re lying flat?
When he’s chucking over heavies
And they’re bursting all around.
Why the man who hadn’t wind up
Is a hero—(not yet found).

THE SOUVENIR.
’Twas somewhere up in Flanders that an
“Aussie” soldiered on,
Full twenty months had passed away since
khaki he did don;
He’d just then got a prisoner and luck became
his lot,
He souvenired him quickly and a watch and
chain he got.
He marched him back behind the line, thro’
shot and shell did rage,
Taking him back a mile or two, back to the
prisoners’ cage.
But getting weary as they do, he halted for a
rest,
A mate came by and asked him if he thought
our side the best.
Said he, I think we’re winning but of that I
can’t be sure,
I had enough of Flanders, of Belgium and the
war.
But should we now be beaten all my work is
not in vain
For I’m richer than I started —see I’ve got a
watch and chain.


The Musings of a Soldier.
WANTED—MAN POWER.
There’s a roar in the skies and the air’s filled
with cries
Of your mates calling out for your aid,
There are guns on the flanks—making gaps in
their ranks,
But thank God that the Huns have been stayed.
They are holding on hard-yielding up yard by
yard
They are causing great loss to the foe,
They are making things hum, they are calling
out “COME”
Yet they will not compel you to go.
They’ve no thought of races, with battle
scarred faces
They are fighting for homeland and you;
Their cause is a right one, their corner’s a
tight one,
They show what old England can do.
They haven’t much pleasure, it can’t be called
leisure,
For the row’s very hard that they hoe,
Is it you’re a mean skunk? is it that you’re a
funk?
That you answer their call with a “NO.”

THE ’BUS MAN.
Yes sir, once I drove a bus in good old London
Town
And there it was I managed just to earn an
honest brown,
But now I’m in the Army and Tommy is my
fare,
Our destination, often, well, of that we’re un-
aware.
My beat it used to take me thro’ ’Dilly and the
Strand,
Now the track I use leads onto a place called
No Man’s Land
Oh, yes, I’ve passengers many, when of shells
there aint a load,
And you’ll hear me chort-chort-chorting along
the Menin Road.
I’m out to see this finished—yes—till Fritz
has had enough,
Though the going’s rather heavy and things
feel rather rough
But when I get to Blighty, and I drive my old
old Bus,
I hope the people won’t forget just what they
owe to us.
And should I pass Lord Clarence or Lord
Algie passes by,
I’ll hold my head as high as theirs—why—
’cause I’ve had a try,
And I’ll tell the good old story in the bosom of
my fold,
Of how I went chort chorting up along the
Menin Road.

KIPPERS.
Served out very often for breakfast.
O mighty monster of the deep,
Where U boats stealthily do creep,
Where mermaids have their beauty sleep
And Neptune holds his sway.
’Tis sad—whilst in this war of wars.
Right nobly for the nation’s cause,
You’ve come within the ration laws,
Of English homes to-day.
And thus it came about that we
On many morns should look at thee
And class you in your category,
Indeed you’re not the best.
We tried you out with knife and fork,
You couldn’t run—you couldn’t walk.
And though yoU very near could talk
You failed in every test.
You with a cross we did adorn
And sent you onwards —sad—forlorn,
We, all of us; did sadly mourn
That passed out you should be.
Dear Kipper—you have done your bit,
(There really is no doubt of it)
So we, with sorrow, now admit
Your class it is C 3.

TO HIM WHO SLANDERS
THE W.A.A.C.
You—you start to slander —you who safe at
home have stayed,
You—who think you’ve done your little bit
when at ev’ning you’ve prayed
You don’t know what a hardship is—you’ve
hot bottles for your feet,
And yet you have the cheek enough to sit on
judgment seat.
Do you know the food they live on ? do you
know how hard’s their bed?
And how hard is every pillow—where they lay
their dainty head?
No, you don’t, confirmed old rotter, or else
you’d surely say
That the women of old England show what
they’re worth to-day.
I’ve seen a bit of warfare and I’ve seen the
Waacs at work
Never once have they cried “Finit”, never once
I’ve seen them shirk,
They are cool and full of courage, tho ' shells
around them fly,
If you think their job a light one, why don’t
YOU have a try?
They’re a credit to the nation, they’re as good
as any man,
They have helped and done their duty just as
only woman can,
You’re not fit to clean their little shoes, you’re
safe at home its true
But its the khaki cladded little Waacs that
make home safe for you.

WHEN POMPEY’S ON THE
GO.
Oh they’ve tidied up the cookhouse and the
packs are all tres-bon
The officers are running round with all their
glad rags on.
They’ve been up to our billet and they’ve looked
about the place
We know there’s somethin’ doin’ you can see
it in their face.
So we up and asks a Sergeant what the trouble
is about
He says he doesn’t jerry but he’ll go and find
it out
And then we strikes a ding-bat they’re always
in the know
He says they’ve got the wind up—Pompey’s on
the go.
They stand around in clusters and every now
and then
They goes and has another look and then goes
’way again.
The O.C. he is running round and setting us
at work,
At tidying up the blooming place—he won’t
let no one shirk
Then he gets his artists—the one and two-
starred bird
He whispers them instructions—he’s afraid he
may be heard
Then he goes and has a gink for half-an-hour
or so
’Struth how they get the wind up when
Pompey’s on the go.
At least an hour before the time he’s supposed
to be around
They take us out and drill us on our old bat-
talion ground.
Slope arms. Form Fours, and then a rest, we
truly are fed up


The Musings of a Soldier.
When by the C.O. and the Adj’t old Pompey is
led up.
There’s one thing that we diggers like is to see
this bit of fun
It’s the only thing to cheer us now we’ve
finished with the Hun.
We never thought it possible but now we
always know
’Struth how they get the wind up when
Pompey’s on the go.
HOMESICK.
How often at the bugle call
The sick men into line do fall
They’re marched up to the M.O.’s hall
In numbers they’re not short
There’s those with livers, those with colds
Each one his saddest tale unfolds
The Doctor helps but some he scolds
If maling’ring they’re caught.
On one case yet they can’t agree
The man seems healthy as can be
He’s told in Anger M and D
There’s nothing wrong with you
So off he to his lines goes back
And fixes on his soldier’s pack
But yet there’s something he does lack
His outlook still looks blue.
That lad or married man perhaps
Is like a lot of other chaps
Who since at home have packed their traps
Are homesick yes it’s true.
So smile and smiling help your mate
From getting to that dismal state
’Tis then you’ll find—as sure as fate
He’s better— so are you.

TRINITY COLLEGE,
CAMBRIDGE—MAY 1918.
Thou seat of learning, where undergrad
For many years, instruction had,
Where Dons and Fellows walked and drove,
In shady drive —in green alcove,
Alas, ’tis come to pass that thou,
Though once before again must now
Thy paths of calm and solitude
Have beaten up by soldiers rude;
But stay —your walls of rugged stone,
Yet shelter men from every zone,
The nation’s best from various climes
Have come to help these troublous times
Yes, in your seat of learning, they
Are training for the battle fray
And later on it will be found
The Empire, closer, tighter, bound.
The seed that’s sown in your halls,
Its growth is quickened ’neath your walls.
’Tis good—So farewell, Trinity,
The Nation should be proud of thee!

AT THE WINDOW.
I sit and I watch from my window
The boys as they go marching by
With their bounding stride, like the incoming
tide
And the fearless look in their eye.
I mind as I sit at the window,
A time many long years ago,
When I marched in the ranks, through the
crowd on our flanks,
To fight ’gainst the ruthless foe.
I feel as I sit at the window
That the boys of the Old Brigade
Would welcome with cheers—those youngsters
in years
Though old at the soldiering trade.
And I turn from my window, thinking
(For the boys have gone marching by)
That there’s nothing so sweet, as the tramp of
the feet
Of boys who will conquer or die.


The Musings of a Soldier.
THE MAIL.
The soldier’s mail has just come in,
The N.C.O. in charge
Is giving out the letters
And packets, small and large.
Though the mist and rain are falling
Yet the sunlight seems to shine,
See the looks—the eager faces
Of the boys who hold the line.
There’s many a man who fails to get
A parcel or a note,
And when the mail is given out,
A lump comes in his throat
But every day the mail arrives
He joins the waiting throng
He may be yours—so, now, to-day,
Send him a note along.
THE WOMAN WHO STAYED
AT HOME.
We’ve often thought how brave we were
We’ve never thought of you
Away back home alone with thoughts
How brave that you were, too;
We had our spells, and earned them
But you all day and night
Have sat and worried thinking still
That we were in the fight.
With fear not joy the postman’s knock
Was answered as in dread
Because you knew not when the time
Came news that he was dead.
But now its o’er may God above
Sustain us in his might
And send us safely back to you
Heroines of the fight.
