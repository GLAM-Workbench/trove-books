the Board.
12. On the assembly of the Board after the candidates
have been allotted their seats and Index Numbers, the
President, or, in his absence, the senior member of the
Board, will read to the candidates paras. 13 to 19 inclusive
and para. 22 of these Regulations.


13. Each candidate will be given a number which he
will write on his paper of questions and on every C.M.
Book 24 containing his replies. This number will be
that placed opposite to his name on the List of Candidates,
C.M. Form K 2, which will be submitted for his signature
and address. The name of a candidate must on no account
appear on hispapers. Any infraction of this Regulation will
disqualify tlie Candidate.
14. Candidates while under examination are to be placed
at least 6 feet apart in all directions, and must maintain
that distance duritfg the whole time. Candidates will not

notes, and has not given or received help of any kind
during the examination,?
17. Any candidate detected in the examination room in
the possession of a book or MS., brought with him for
assistance, or in copying from the papers of another
candidate, or in permitting his own papers to be copied,
or in attempting to give or receive assistance of any
description, will be disqualified ; his examination will be
discontinued, and the cireumstance reported.


18. The examination papers are to be distributed to

concerned (paragraph 10), and then only in the presence
of the candidates.
24. The worked papers should be arranged in the order
of the Attendance List, C.M. Form K 4, immediately on
the conclusion of each sitting, and sealed in one or more
of the special envelopes provided for that purpose.


Each packet should contain a list of the Index Numbers
[C.M. Form K 3 (without names)] of candidates at the
examination to which the papers in it refer. No other
papers should be enclosed in the packet.
The President (or senior member of the Board) will not
allow the envelopes out of his possession, bet he will,

The presence of each candidate is to be indicated by
a tick (thus ,/). The number of books, maps, or drawings
given up is to be marked by cross ticks, thus:
for one book or sheet: r two ; or three,
and so on.
If a candidate goes out without attempting the paper,
a 0 is to be marked after the tick denoting his presence,
thus : V 0.
If a candidate does not attend for the paper, the word
?Absent? (or ? Abs.?) should be entered.
It is most important that each separate book or sheet
should bear the candidate?s index number in his own hand-
writing.
Special note is to be made of any candidates who may
assign being unwell as a cause of leaving.


The initials of the President of the Board should be
placed at the foot of each column, and all doubtful
each column, and all doubtful
points cleared up before the Attendance List is attached
to the proceedings of the Board for transmission to the

Measurement
of height?
The candidate will be placed against the standard with
his feet together, and the weight thrown on the heels, and
not on the toes or outside of the feet. He will stand erect
without rigidity, and with the heels, calves, buttocks, and
shoulders touching the standard; the chin will be depressed
to bring the vertex of the head level under the horizontal
bar, and the height will be noted in parts of an inch to
eighths.
(c) Measurement of chest ?
The candidate will be made to stand erect with his feet
together, and to raise his arms over his head. The tape
will be carefully adjusted round the chest with its posterior


upper edge touching the inferior angles of the shoulder-
blades, and its anterior lower edge the upper part of the
nipples. The arms will then be lowered to hang loosely
by the side, and care will be taken that the shoulders are
not thrown upwards or backwards so as to displace the
tape. The candidate will then be directed to take a deep
inspiration several times, and the maximum expansion of
the chest will be carefully noted. It is often attempted to
conceal the true minimum measurement, but it can be
obtained by a little manipulation and by drawing of!
attention from the examination by a few questions.
The maximum expansion rarely exceeds the average
minimum by more than 2 to 2| inches.
The minimum and maximum will then be recorded thus,
33 34
35 36J &c -
In recording the measurements, fractions of less than
half-an-inch should not be noted.
( d) The candidate will also be weighed without clothes,
and his weight recorded on the proceedings of the Board.
(e) Eyesight.?The following are the regulations for
examination of eyesight:?
Squint, inability to distinguish the principal colours, or
any morbid condition of the eyes, or of the lids of either eye
liable to the risk of aggravation or recurrence, will cause
the rejection of the candidate.
The examination for determining the acuteness of vision
includes two tests : one for distant, the other for near
vision. The Army Test Types will be used for the test
for distant vision, without glasses, except where otherwise
stated below, at a distance of 20 feet ; and Snellen?s
Optotypi for the test for near vision without glasses, at
any distance selected by the candidate. Each eye will be
examined separately, and the lids must be kept wide open
during the test. The candidate must be able to read the
tests without hesitation in ordinary daylight.


Sufficient /Right eye V =
\ Left eve
v=
Defective /Right eye V =
iLeft eye
V =
A candidate possessing acuteness of vision, according to
one of the standards herein laid down, will not be rejected
on account of an error of refraction, provided that the
error of refraction, in the following cases, does not exceed
the limits mentioned, viz.:? (a) in the case of myopia, that
the error of refraction does not exceed 2.5 D ; (6) that
any correction for astigmatism does not exceed 2.5 D ;
and, in the case of myopic astigmatism, that the error of
refraction does not exceed 2.5 D.
Subject to the foregoing conditions, the standards of the
minimum acuteness of vision with which a candidate will
be accepted are as follows :
Standard I.
Right eye. Left eye.
Distant vision.?V = 6/6. V = 6/6.
Near vision.?Reads 0, 6. Reads, 0, 6.
Standard 11.

Distant vision?V = 6/6. V, without glasses, = not
below 6/60 ; and after
Near vision.?Reads, 0, 6. Reads 1.
Standard 111

NO RELAXATION OF THE STANDARD OF VISION
WILL EVER BE ALLOWED.
The following additional points will be observed
(/) That his hearing is good.
(g) That his speech is without impediment.
(h) That his teeth are in good order. Loss or decay of
ten teeth will be considered a disqualification. Decayed

erupted wisdom teeth are not to be counted as deficient.
(j) That his chest is well formed, and that his lungs and
heart are sound.
( k) That he is not ruptured.
[l] That he does not suffer from a severe degree of vari-
cocele* or varicose veins. A candidate who has been success-
fully operated on will be accepted.
(m) That his limbs are well formed and developed.
( n ) That there is free and perfect motion of all joints.
(o) That his feet and toes are well formed.
(p) That he does not suffer from any inveterate skin
disease.
