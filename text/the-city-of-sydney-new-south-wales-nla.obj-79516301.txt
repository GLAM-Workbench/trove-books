THE CITY OF SYDNEY,
NEW SOUTH WALES.
In the year 1783, the British government resolved upon forming a
settlement of convicts in the latest discovered portion of the world ; and
foi this purpose despatched Governor Philip, with necessary instructions,
to New South Wales. The Spaniards became acquainted with Australasia
so early as 1609, when Don Pedro Fernando de Quires navigated the
southern ocean; and the Dutch visited those countries in 1616, under the
conduct of fheodoric Hertoge : a galaxy of celebrated navigators followed
in their wake ; amongst whom the best known in England are Dampier,
Cook, and Flinders. Passing Port Jackson without notice, Cook directed
his attention to the inlet since named ?Botany Bay,? from the amazing
variety of new plants discovered there by Sir Joseph Banks, and it was
for this port that Philip was originally commissioned to steer. With an
excellent judgment, and full powers of action, he determined upon
abandoning the site fixed on by government, and wisely, as events have
proved, laid the foundation of the first Australian city, Sydney, on a
sheltered cove at the head of Port Jackson, in lat. 38�, 55' S., lon, 150� 10' E.
i his noble inlet is not above two miles across at its entrance between
two gigantic cliffs, on the southern of which is a lighthouse, the
lantern of which is elevated 345 feet above the level of the sea-surface,
and 67 above the land ; within, the port expands into a spacious and deep
basin, where the whole navy of Great Britain might ride securely. It
is navigable to a distance of fifteen miles from its entrance, with safe
anchorage the whole way, and its shores are indented by nearly a hundred
cxeeks, coves, inlets, and armlets, all deep, with good anchorage, and
completely sheltered. On one of the safest and most picturesque of these
retiring bays, having a surface that occupies half a mile in length by a
greater average breadth, is the city of Sydney, the metropolis of Austral-
asia, overhung and enriched by scenery at once picturesque and happy-
looking. Fort Macquarie guards the eastern point of the cove,?and the
height on the western, which separates Sydney Cove from Cockle Bay,
is crowned by Dawe's Battery. The old town stood on two banks sloping
to a livulet, the principal part of the buildings being erected on ? The
Rocks, a name which that ancient, irregular, and now unfashionable
quarter still retains. Intent upon the first laws of nature, all con-
siderations of beauty and uniformity were overlooked by the first settlers,
and liquses were pitched like tents upon the most convenient spot that
was disengaged. Governor Macquarie, who explored much of Aus-
tralia in 1817, and was a great benefactor to the colony, notwithstanding
the very obstinate resistance of the inhabitants, caused a complete
remodelling of the town, established a perfect alligtment in most
of the streets, and even reduced ? The Rocks? into a civilised form.
George-street, which commences at the King?s Wharf, bisects the city
completely ; while several other avenues, of nearly equal breadth, run

parallel to it for a great part of its length. The area of the township of
Sydney has been finally assigned by an Act of Council, dated 4 Will. IV.,
and stated to include ? 1778 acres, or 2| square miles; its length from
Dawe?s Point to Cleveland House miles; and its average width
miles. The total number of houses within these boundaries, in 1841,
was 4593; but the suburbs of Double Bay, South Head, St. Leonard?s,
Balmain, Pyrmont, Petersham, and New Town, exhibit clusters of elegant
villas and pleasure grounds. The population return of 1821 is so incor-
rect, that the rate of increase cannot be stated with accuracy until after
that period. The following authentic table, however, extends over
thirteen years:?
From the preceding return it appears that 19,152 souls have been added
to the population in thirteen years, and 13,741 in eight years. The popu-
lation of Sydney is nearly a fourth of that of the colony: in propoi-tion
to that of other parts, as 10 to 33 : and to the total population as 10 to
44. Mr. Backhouse, a modern traveller and indefatigable philanthro-
pist, thus describes his first impression on entering the capital of the
? Newest World.? ?In point of building Sydney strikes us as being-
more like a large English town than Hobart Town. Many of the houses
are in contact; the shops are quite English. In general appearance the
buildings are like those of towns within thirty miles of London. In the
court-yards and gardens of the more retired streets, peach, orange, and
loquat-trees, grape-vines, and many singular and beautiful trees are
growing luxuriantly; here and there towering Norfolk pines also mark
the difference from the climate of England. White mulberry forms a
common screen round the gardens, and a small tree, called here white
cedar, Melia Azedarach , is often planted between the houses and the
outer fence of the premises.? These rural remnants are fast disappearing,
and Sydney now presents the appearance of an active, prosperous, long-
established commercial city, where the customs and habits of England
are so deeply seated as speedily to reconcile the emigrant to his adopted
country. The shops in George-street, where Mr. James Tegg, the pub-
lisher of the Sydney Almanac, resides, are fitted up with plate glass,
chandeliers, and decorations, equal to those of the leading streets of
business in London ; and others are little inferior in neat and comfortable
appearance. The footways are paved, the carriage roads macadamised,
gas-light established, and the houses, in general two stories in height,
built of sandstone, of brick, or wood work, often coated with an adhesive
cement. It has been mentioned that ? The Rocks,? or Old Town, is
situated on the west side of the cove, from the head of which the main


streets issue due south, intersected at intervals, and at right angles, by
others that extend from Woomooloo to Darling Harbour. The space
on the east shore, not yet noticed, is wholly occupied by the? Govern-
ment House and domain, Botanical Garden, or Farm Cove, and the
public offices. The Government House is very grandly situated in the
centre and on the summit of a promontory, separating Sydney and Farm
Coves; it is rather a patchwork structure, being enlarged, but not
improved, by many governors from the date of Philip to the present time ;
but the grove of Cape pines and English oaks in front, and the grounds
around, form the favourite promenade and ride of the citizens. The num-
ber of public buildings in the city is considerable, but none characterised by
elegance or originality of design. Three churches, St. Philip?s, St. James,
and St. Lawrence, of the established religion, besides Presbyterian, Wes-
leyan, and Roman Catholic chapels, are included amongst the places of wor-
ship : while two colleges, the Australian and Sydney, a Normal institution,
Episcopalian, and other seminaries, are devoted to the intellectual improve-
ment of the rising race. The peculiar nature of the settlement originally
has multiplied the number of barracks, hospitals, and workhouses, beyond
the lotof other cities. Hyde Park and Carter?s barracks, the tread mill, new
and old jails, hulks, Goat Island prison, colonial hospital, &c. ai?e all ap-
propriated to convicts. In Hyde Park barracks especially, the lamentable
process of subordination by flagellation is practised, and about 1000
offenders are chastised in this degrading- manner every year. Carter?s
barracks served, until the recent Insolvents? Act, as a debtor?s jail, and
prison for an ironed gang; and another gang of the same class occupy the
new jail. On Goat Island, the convicts have been employed to build an
extensive powder-mill. r l he colonial hospital in Macquarie-street, ad-
joining the council rooms, has accommodation for 130 patients; and the
Benevolent Institution, which is under the direction of a committee
chosen annually from amongst its subscribers, is partially supported by
government. One of the principal modern improvements at Sydney is
the mode of supplying the city with water, now in progress of comple-
tion. A tunnel, two feet wide, four feet in height, two miles in length,
and arched with cut stone, extends from Botany Bay swamp to Sydney,
where pipes communicating with the various streets convey a constant
supply of pure water. Tiie swamps are natural reservoirs formed in the
sandstone rock. One of them covers 1000 acres, is filled with sand through
which the water filters, but overgrown with wild shrubs concealing its
great depth, and misleading conjecture as to its immense contents. The
plan of a covered aqueduct for a public supply of water was adopted by
Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians, and Spaniards, and strongly recom-
mended to the citizens of London by the late Mr. Telford : it will one
day be put in practice.
Besides the pleasure of aquatic excursions, the lounge in the gover-
nor?s domain, rides in the suburban scenery,?which is of the most agree-
able character, ? a trip to the Heads is amongst the favourite holiday
amusements. Ihe wildness of the scene, the pleasures of a boating party,


; .
and the very agreeable panorama that surrounds the waters, form never-
failing attractions to the citizens.
While pleasure Is courted commerce is cultivated with equal ardour
at Sydney: six banks of issue and discount, a savings? bank, loan and
interest company, and many insurance associations, assist in the advance-
ment of trade and speculation. By a recent return it appears, that the
number of vessels owned in Sydney is 224, of the aggregate burden of
25,000 tons : of these fifteen are steamers, whose total burden is 1685 tons.
The trade of Sydney being identical with that of the colony, it will not
be necessary to notice it any further here than in a general, yet authentic
way : wool, oil, whalebone, cedar, and flax, constitute the chief exports;
the annual value of the first reaching about 300,000/.; of the second,
150,000/.; of the third, 7000/.; of the fourth, 8000/.; of the last item,
6000/, The gross annual value of imports recently exceeds one million
sterling. Commerce does not wholly absorb the feelings of the citizens of
Sydney : they subscribe to clubs and literary assemblies?sustain scientific
associations, libraries and book rooms; a monthly magazine, of much
ability, is supported wholly by colonial talent; and the Sydney news-
papers have always been respected for the valuable topograph 1 cal, statis-
tical, and commercial information which they concentrate and convey with
strict impartiality. h 2
