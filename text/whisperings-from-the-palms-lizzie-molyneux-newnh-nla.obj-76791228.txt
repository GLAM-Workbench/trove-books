My heart s great hope and jor,
I alvravs think of thee in love,
?/ 7
My darling absent boy.
No pang Ims e'er been felt by nie,
Through any fault of tbine,
Always in truest sympathy*
Did all thy boyhood shine ;
And now thou art a man and gom
To face this world of care ;
In all thy work and hardship, too,
Thy mother takes a share.
As years roll on, may?st thou e?er prove,
Honest, and just, and. fair,
< luarded each day by Heaven?s own lore,
Thy mother?s constant prayer,
Then when all work and care is done,
And earth for ns is o?er,
May you and I, my precious son,
Meet there to part no more.
Parents and children union sweet I
And love without alloy,
Shall then each other fondly greet.
As now I yearn, with each heart?s beat,
For thee, my absent boy!


A Kiss.
? Pure breath of Heaven,
Home on angels wings,
It bringeth down a sweet perfume
Among these earthly tilings.
Sweet smiles dropping
From celestial hands,
Chaining up our hearts
With its golden hands ;
Breathing a soft zephyr,
From the land above.
Sweetest silvery token,
Emblem of our love.
The little infant sleeping
( hi its mother's arm,
(luarded ever safely.
And from all alarm ;
She prints upon its rosy lips,
As only mother's can,
And he will not forget that kiss.
F en when lie is a man.
A!id Eden?s lovely flowery bowers.
Where our first parents stroll'd.
The bliss of that first loving kiss,
No human lips unfold ;
When Adam breathed upon her brow.
The token of his love,
We see that happy bridal pair,
Straight from the Throne above.
?Charity,? alias ?Love.?
Oh ! star of heaven, shining so bright,
To dispel the blackest, darkest night;
It shines out clear in the midnight sky,
It whispers peace to the passers by,


It cheers our lot, whate?er mar befall,
?Tis a precious gift, and free to all,
In cot alike and palace found,
And e?en to earth?s remotest bound ;
It dwells in the heart of the little child.
It is ever gentle, soft and mild,
?Tis one of the rarest gems of earth.
Oh! Charitv, born of heavenly birth,
?* %/
It dwells in the heart of crowned kings,
?Tis borne along on angels' wings
To the babe that lies at its mother?s breast
To all it whispers sweetest rest,
To young hearts breathing notes of lore,
Like angels' whispers from above.
However lowly be our lot,
True love can never be forgot,
It ever shines when all is sad.
It nmketh all around us glad.
It comes from the heart of (lod alone,
For Heaven above is the heart?s true home

To E.A.R.N,
dust three and twenty years to-day,
In a far-otf Southern clime,
A tiny infant, fair and sweet,
Whs laid upon mine arm ;
"Within mv heart there struck a chord.
It came from Heaven above,
It lias never ceased its.melody,
They call it Mother's love.
I Razed upon that little 4 face.
So innocent and pure,
To my fond eyes so full of grace,
And breathed a Mother?s prayer.


This precious jewel, lent to me,
T?o set within my heart,
�/
And keep from earth?s defiling dross,
From evil?s every dart.
Saviour, within Thy Diadem,
Oh, keep for her a place ;
And from her earliest childhood?s days,
Preserve her hv Thy "race.
Since then old time has borne us on,
And inanv changes brought,
? O O '
But the blessing then I fondly craved,
Long years ago?and sought,
Has been granted by our gracious Lord,
True prayer is ne?er for nought.
To-day 1 see my darling child
v �/ o
Amongst that noble hand,
Who go forth to the dying,
Their lives within their hand
To minister to suffering ones,
O '
And thus fulfil the word.
AMien I was sick ye came to me.
Ho spake our gracious Lord.
Could mother's love ask more than this f
Ah , no, not e?er a crown.
For Thrones and Kingdoms of this earth.
Shall all ere long fall down,
But the loyal servants of the King,
Their welcome then shall know.
A\ ell done, ye blessed, enter in,
\\ here joys forever flow,
A cup of water given on earth,
In his beloved name,
Shall sparkle then in brilliant light,
Angelic hosts behold the sight,
The ransomed at His feet shall fall.
And crown our Jesus Lord of AIL


Baby Sleeps.
Written by request for a sorroicinf mother .
Sleep, darling infant, sleep.
Nought can disturb thee now,
Thou hearest the light of heaven,
Upon thy baby brow.
Sleep, darling infant sleep,
Gentle and soft is thy rest.
For thou art pillowed for evermore-
Upon thy Saviour's breast.
Sleep, darling infant sleep,
For thou cnn?st never sec,
The tears of thy weeping mother,
Nor her heart?s deep misery.
Sleep, darling infant sleep.
Thy little life is o?er,
And thou art landed in perfect peace,
On yonder blissful shore.
Sleep, darling infant sleep,
With us thou could?st not stay,
For Jesus beckoned thee to thy rest,
And home of endless day.
Sleep, darling infant sleep,
Evil, thou ne?er can'st know,
Taken so soon from this mortal stake,.
Saved from its cares and its woe.
Sleep, darling infant sleep.
Sleep on and take thy rest,
Tt is better far that thou should'st be,
At home on the Saviour?s breast.
Sleep, darling infant, sleep.
While the months and years roll on,
Soon we shall strike our golden harps,
With yonder ransomed throng.
Sleep, darling infant sleep,
On, earth we loved thee well,
1 lut Jesus loved thee better.
Than our hearts can ever tell.


Feho! List!
Methinks I hour a voice
Ho sweet from Paradise,
Borne on the golden harps along.
While baby lingers touch those chords.
In praise to Christ, the Tumi of Lords.
Tell me the key note
Whispers sweet,
Bear mother, come to Jesus feet,
And soon vonr babv von shall meet,

Mother?s Darling-.
Pithy lips all smiling,
Bearls all set in white,
IVlother?s little darling,
hull of fun so bright.
dumping pi ay i n g ??pr;
All the live-long day,
Like the bees all humming,
In the warm, sweet May ;
' f J 1
Lumping in the garden,
?prattling,
Chasing butterflies,
Hiding round the corners
For a glad surprise,
Stroking patient pussy,
And her kittens, too,


Darling, not so roughly.
Listen to her ? m-e-w ? !
Searching mother's baskets
For an empty reel,
Then with merry laughter.
What a gladsome peal !
Daily found a treasure,
Pins and needles, too,
Toys so very dangerous,
M ust not be for you ;
So the day passed softly.
Like a summer?s breeze,
And the sun?s bright rays are sinking,
Behind the old elm trees,
Baby?s eyes are closing,
And the little hands at rest,
Are now so quietly laying.
And folded on her breast,
Mother kiss her (failing.
And pray to Heaven above,
That the wing of the Guardian Angel,
May fold o'er her own sweet love !
But she knew not that
Death's poisoned arrow,
Had struck to the heart of her child,
And that before the dawn of to-morrow
Her grief would be deep and wild ;
She little dream?d of the answer,
To her fervent mother's prayer,
That the mandate had gone from Heaven
To bring home her darling one there;
Folding bis golden pinions,
Bearing upon bis breast,
The darling?mother s treasure-
Is now for ever at rest !


Good=bye.
Oh, can we ever say the word,
And free from sorrow be,
Pmt still we are happy in. the thought,.
Of one day meeting thee.
Prosperity, attend thee now,
Wherever thou shalt be,
And fortune smile upon thy brow,
This is my wish for thee.
The .pleasant hours that now are gone,
Of happiness with thee,
Shall ever to my memory come,
And make me think of thee.
May health and happiness be thine,
Wherever thou shalt go,
And love?s refreshing silvery stream,
Forever for thee flow.
May sunshine fall upon thy path,
No sorrows may?st thou know,
And mv best wishes still attend,
V '
My whole heart echoes so.
Meetings and partings here on earth,
Are happening every day,
But there?s a land where that sad word.
We nevermore shall sav-
For when we gather in that home,
Where we shall never sigh,
That bitter word no more lie said,
Which now we call good-bye.
Waiting.
Waiting, only waiting.
Waiting, day by dav.

?Mid the clouds and sunshine,
In the stormy way.

Waiting, only waiting,
In the fiercest gale,
Leaning on His bosom,
None can ever fail.
Waiting, only waiting,
In the darkest night,
Strong, so strong, while
Trusting to His might.
Waiting, only waiting,
Until we enter in.
Waiting, only waiting,
Every shadow fiee,
Waiting, only waiting,
Dear Lord, to come to Thee,.
Waiting, only waiting,
Tired, and faint and lone,
Waiting, only waiting,
To make His arm our own.
Waiting, only waiting,
When the eye of faith is dim.
Waiting, only waiting,
Until we dwell with Him.
Waiting, only waiting,
When heart and flesh do fail.
Waiting, only waiting,
Our place within the vail,
only waiting,
Upon life?s stormy sea,
Waiting, only waiting,
Saviour, for Thee.
Waiting, only waiting,
Till o?er the glassy sea,
To hear the ransom?d
In sweetest melody;
Waiting, only waiting,
We strike our harps of gold.
And'echo the songs, of Heaven,
The half has not been told.

Hope.
Young hearts cast out their anchor.
On life?s unsteady sea,
They see not the tossing billows,
For the perils that there must be;
They yearn for something?somethingv
Its name we cannot tell.
?Tis dropped on land and ocean,
Within the heart?s deep well.
They long for satisfaction.
Something within to rest.
And they try to find that something
?y o
On life?s uncertain breast.
Sometimes the anchor holdeth.
Sometimes it drags away, (V. |
lint still the young heart hopetlr^ B'"?' 8 '"?'
For joy another day ;
Sometimes our sky is cloudy.
And dark and stormy, too,-'
I Jut still if we rightly see it,
Hope 1 shines for me and you,
We meet aloying answer.
To our question often asked,
And we know that true joy for ever
And evermore shall last,
We find a kindred spirit
Within the human soul,


?Where lose, we now inherit,
It is found in every Pole.
Two hearts made one in union,
Can cross life?s stormy sea,
And find in each other's pleasure, -
Whatever change may he.
Hearts mete our happy homesteads,
And wherever love is found,
Tis always a precious jewel.
To earth?s remotest hound.
Kach other's cares and joys to know,
Wherever in this world we go,
Love he our guiding star and ray.
To that bright world of endless day
Crosses.
1 was weary, and slumber betook me.
To dream-land, the country of sleep.
And behold all around me were lying.
The crosses which makes us all weep.
Of various sizes and colors,
Some appeared to be lighter to touch,.
And others so heavy, I cried out,
Save me, oh, save me from such.
Some with beautiful flowers were covered,
And the dew lay sparkling around,
And others, wet with tears were lying,
in confusion all over the ground.
I wandered so sadly amongst them,
And seemed almost losing my way,
When a voice in my ear softly whispered,.
My child, how is it to day ?
My heart, t'was too heavy too answer,
The word of my Saviour and Guide,
And all f could do was to follow,
And keep very near to His side.


Ain] we walked through the mists and the
darkness,
Of that country of shadow and g'oom,
o
I, seemed to be losing my blindness,
And to be thinking once more of my home.
With His arm lie tenderly led me,
And the crosses they all tied away.
And quickly I found myself landed,
in the realms of endless day.
Eden.
Love is a 1 lower of Heavenly birth,
It bloomed out first on this sad earth.
Planted by God's own hand.
..
In Eden's found a happy band.
They were but two.
'Mid flowers that grew,
And trees so fair,
We find in bliss a happy pair.
One little corner?that alone,
Did God reserve ?quite as His own.
An evil eye had watched that place,
And miserv brought on all our race,
A woman fair, and lovely too,
Mid flowers that sparkled all with dew,
And strolled away from Adam's side,
Where she shall always e?er abide,
A monstrous foe, in colors bright,
o 7
In serpent form, a tempting sight,
A question asked,
An answer given?
o
T?was this one word,
Brought down the width of Heaven.
She listenef, looked, and touched that tree,
And brought to us all misery,


?One apple, yes one, only one,
And thus for sin,
The victory won.
Then Adam followed in the train,
Thus has it been again, again.
Evening drew on and God appeared,
And now the guilty pair?they feared.
To meet His glorious presence fair,
TMid hushes hide themselves with care.
They banished were,
J - - - 7
From that fair home,
?Mid thorns and briars now to roam,
God's angel guarded well the gate,
Now closed for ever??twas too late.
And now they knew what they had done,
And lost the sight of God?s own Son,
And yet ?a golden promise came,
To rescue them from sin and shame.
For God gave up His only Son,
His well-beloved only One,
To die upon the dreadful tree,
Heaven to win for you and me.
A moment standing still, for ever and for ever.
This is eternity,?
The clock of time is striking fast,
And man?s short life is flying past,
Then oh, my soul, prepare to meet.
The eternity which lieth at thy feet.
Where shall they spend it, where, oh where V
But ?thou must give down the answer here.

A Star.
Kight?s dark pinions were spreading o'er land and sea.
And the star-lit heavens above me?a sight not new
to me :
But my little prattling darling was looking with
wondering eyes,
And viewing the lamps of Heaven with child-like,
glad surprise ;
At last, with glowing wonder, she looked around
near and far,
While 1 ler baby lips uttered the simple words,
? Father, dear father, God has made a star! ?
No Sickness There
Written by Hequetl.
The sun was sinking in the far-off west.
And night was spreading her dark pinions
O?er all nature, seeking rest.
Birds, beasts, e?en flowers and wearied man,
Down to the helpless babe that slept upon its
mother?s breast,
All?all were tired, so tired, with the dav?s work
�/
and care,
Except a noble few who did not get their share;
For?they were waiting, watching, beside the-
suffering bed.
By the Spirit of our gracious Lord,
To that blessed mission led.
? When I was sick, ye came to Me, - ?
Our loving Saviour said.
And to those poor afflicted ones.
The form of that patient face.
Seemed to bring the rays of Heavenly lovt
And Hope, and Truth, and Grace,


Like gems for the brilliant diadem,
That adorn the Heavenly place.
As I walked through the dimly-lit corridors,
In the silent watch of the night,
A faint sound of melody fell on mine car,
And my eyes?they beheld a sad sight;
A sweet boy was lying-?with golden hair,
Hands clasped and crossed on his breast,
As he called for his mother and breathed that sweet
name,
More of Heaven than earth 'tis possessed,
The eyes once so bright were vacant and dull,
And the face had a cold, pallid hue ;
Still the lips were murmuring faint and low,
? Mother, dear mother, is it you ? ?
No answer <m an th to that sad cry was given,
But methinks from the angel band,
A shining one came with a message from Heaven,
? For my boy?l am waiting in Glory Land !
? J J o 1/
I listened once more, and there came from those lips
Another name, sweeter than all,
It is .Tesus?my Jesus,
And in Heavenly bliss,
He had entered for evermore !
That name died away on his dying lip.-,
And earth for that child was no more.
But Heaven had welcomed another safe home,
And another frail bark reached the shining shore.
As 1 left that sad spot, made sacred by Death,
I could not but remember the word,
"Which was spoken on earth of the dear little ones,
By the Saviour that loved them?our own gracious
Lord.
1 praised Him to know that another dear lamb.
Had been taken safe home to that fold,


"Where pastures are green and waters e?er flow,
And pleasures and joys are untold,
llow many from pain and weariness here
Are released by His mighty command.
What a glorious company is gathering there,
In that happy Beulah Land !
The dear ones who go with their lives in their hand.
To minister to sickness and pain.
Shall meet those they succoured, and nevermore part*
With Jesus for ever to reign.
No hospital wards will be needed up there,
No hearts with anguish be-riven,
All glory and bliss through the pearly gate-.
For there is no sickness in Heaven ;
The inhabitants there by the river of life,
Shall cat of the leaves of that tree,
Which healeth the nations and ever doth give,
Life everlasting for you and for me.
On the Sea of Glass shall the ransomed stand,
And waving their victory's palm,
Shall swell forth the song in that g'orious land,
Hallelujah for ever to God and the Lamb
Echo ! still echo, and echo again,
No more of suffering, no more of pain.
No more of sickness, no more of crying.
No more of death, and no more of dying.
Still echo ?but answer so soft and so sweet.
While the glorified place their crowns at His fee t..
And the echo still lingers on harps of gold.
The bliss of tire ransomed can never be told,
No?never be told ! Echo still answers,
No?never be told !
Vibrating for ever on harps of gold,
The joy of the ransomed can never he told.
And that song never ceases on harp strings of gold,.
The joy of? the ransomed can never be told.


Ami one of the chiefest to our hearts shall he given,
Health and beauty immortal, for there is no sickness
in Heaven !
And now for a little season,
We hid the Whispering Palms farewell.
Hoping again to meet them,
And hear what they have to tell ;
They will speak both of joy ami of sorrow.
Of the present and future to come,
Of the glorious, glad to morrow,
In Heaven, our happy home.
"Wave on ye palms, till we reach the river,
And whisper of love that endureth for ever.
Of Jesus, our Saviour, Redeemer and King,
While the palm trees immortal tell only of Him !
