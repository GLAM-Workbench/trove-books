AUSTRALIAN
RHYMES AND JINGLES,
A SUMMER LYRIC.
u/mF all the things that trouble me
I place the weather first;
The Summer weather, such as we
Are with just now accurst.
I?m almost to a mummy dried,
With hot wind and with sun;
And every joint?s as if the rack
Its work had lately done.
From out my eyes the bilious tears
Come trickling down my face;
I look as if a funeral
Would shortly suit my case.
I venture out in lightest suit,
?Neath an umbrella?s spread;
A hot wind swift envelopes me
In dust from foot to head.
The ground feels like the scorching sapd
Of deserts ?neath my feet;
And, dazzling as the lightning?s flash,
The glare is in the street.


Beneath verandahs people stop,
To wipe perspiring brows ;
And growl together at the heat,
?Neath which the strongest hows.
I?d like to smash thermometers,
And weather prophets slay ;
Then swear I?m not responsible
On such a broiling day.
But soft, I?ll go and take a bath,
And at the weather scoff;
0 horror ! what is this I find ?
The Yan Yean is turned off.
It is too bad. In savage mood
I take the paper up ?
Bush fires, and sun-strokes, that?s the stuff
On which I have to sup.
0 that the change would only come !
The cool wind from the sea,
The bracing breeze, that brings us back
Our strength and jollity!


SPRING IN TOWN.
r r HAT do we know of Spring in town ?
What do we feel of the vernal delights;
Treading the dull flags day by day,
Going to sleep in the suburbs o? nights?
What do we know of fields and flowers,
Of green-robed hills, and breezes, and
birds,
Toiling at ledgers, with clouded brows,
Making up profits by quarters and
thirds ?
What do we know of the odours that come
On the breath of a south-wind sweet ?
Only a perfume now and then
From a reeking gutter out in the street.
Perhaps a flower in the button-hole
Reminds us that the season is spring;
Perhaps a turn in the weather hints
That Winter at last has taken wing.
Perhaps a change from the Winter suit,
To lighter web of the well-cut tweed,
Suggests the truth, in a general way,
That Spring has come to the earth
indeed.
Well, no matter! Tis much the same
To us whatever the season be,?
So long as we weave the web of toil,
And weekly pocket the golden fee.

A SERENADE.
?W HE Magpie dozed in his airy nest,
The Mopoke?s note was hushed ;
?Twas the midnight hour ?from her fairy
bower
My lady gazed, and blushed !
I came to sing, but a horrid cold
Had got into my head ;
She saw (I must the truth unfold)
Me blow my nose ?and fled! :
TRUE, O KING!
((tTTE think it sad to want a pound,
IV}? A shilling, or a ?brown?;
But it is sadder still to be
A king without a crown. |
NED PALETTE
vAEED Palette was a painter,
In manhood?s prime and blush,
But, being down in luck, he had
With fortune many a brush.
He every friend he had,
For patrons he had none ;
And very lone some Edward grew,
As friends dropped one by one.
1-


He laboured hard with brush and paint,
And tried unending means ;
Poor Ned broke down. He couldn?t bear
To labour thus for nought ,
One struggle moi?e. The world was bound
His genius yet to see;


TEMPORA MUTANTUR.
-BOUT declining modesty
p We may well make a fuss,
When in the streets a woman now
Fears not to take a 'bus!
THE COMING WOMAN.
/TV)
Sir HE talk is of the Coming Man;
0; But surely there is room in
Our speculations for a word
About the Coming Woman.
Who will she be? Whence will she come?
And what will be her station?
The future only can return
The needful explanation.
Will she set fashions for the world,
And carve out wondrous drapings?
Design new ways to dress the hair,
And manage crimps and crapings?
Or will she find out some new way
To manage spouse and lover?
Or write a certain recipe,
Old Time?s footprints to cover?
Will she invent a scent or dye,
A magic charm for baby,
A hundred ways to cook a chop,
Or a bad husband may be?


Will she contrive unending, new,
And charming recreations ?
And answer every question asked
In woman?s speculations?
Will she reform society,
And blend opposing factious;
Shape out new laws for womankind,
And modify men?s actions?
Alas! ?tis idle to indulge
In wild and fruitless the?ries;
The future only can reply
To all our curious queries.
A DISSENT FROM DARWIN?S ?DESCENT.?
says, man from the monkey came,
But lost his tail in some curious way;
Which I beg to deny ?for I hold the same
The wickedest fib of the modern day.
If man, as he says, from the monkey grew,
Though many degrees ascending the scale,
In tracing the whole of his history through,
We?ll find that man bears a very long tale.


AN ABORIGINAL ROMANCE.
?w URRAGAROO was the chief of Boofoo;
W Not a very nice man to the civilised view,
Just dressed in a skin, like the rest of his crew,
And living on yams and fat grubs, not a few,
Or anything else he could manage to chew.
(A foe now and then made a very nice stew)
Wurragaroo loved Wangaraday,
In a blackfellow?s own peculiar way,
And resolved he would wed her without delay,
To love him, to honor him, and to obey; t
(Though this isn?t exactly what he did say).
Wangaraday ivas the flower of her tribe,
With graces I needn?t attempt to describe;
(From fancy you may p?rhaps some notion im-
bibe)
Happy and gay, in her own free way,
She never had thought, alack! and a-day!
Of a lover, all drest out in gorgeous array,
Coming round very shortly a visit to pay.
Love at first sight
Is a comical plight,
As all of us know who have felt its delight;
And Wurragaroo, I?m sure, felt it too,
A sensation delightful, and teasing, and new;
But he made up his mind a sure course to pursue.
He didn?t go moaning and groaning and sighing,
Like a duck, as they say, in a thunder-storm
dying,
Or into the regions of poesy flying;


He didn?t indite (for he couldn?t) the tale
Of the grief, that was making him wretched and
pale,
And wearing Ids body down thin as a nail;
He didn?t propose in the usual way,
And offer her wealth, and a carriage and bay,
And beautiful landscapes to see every day,
And a thousand nice things, that in women s
hearts sway.
0 no, no, no!
And by no means so;
That bird he knew wasn?t likely to crow;
Besides, he?d resolved that she shpuldn?t say no.
Now Wangaraday, understand, went to play
Alone in the forest, at break of the day,
At picking up yams, and fat grubs by the way,
To serve by and by for the family ? tay,?
Not dreaming of danger, and fright and dismay,
When who should appear, but Wurragaroo,
With never a bow, nor a ? How do you do??
And looking, though black, remarkably blue,
Saying, ? Wangaraday, I have come here for you ;?
And then with his waddy, he hit her poor noddy
A blow, that nigh drove out all life from her
body,
And made her feel dizzy, as if she'd drunk
toddy.
In a terrible fright, she was thinking of flight,
When Wurragaroo picked her up like a mite,
And carried her off with a yell of delight!


There?s a terrible row in the tribe of Gow Gow,
Each asking the other, the when, and the how;
Who saw it? who heard it? Arm! off with you
now!
We?ll make the stiff neck of this warrior bow
?Neath the might, the dread might, of the tribe
of Gow Gow.
With boomerang, waddy, with spear and with
shield,
The army of Burraboo?s taken the field ?
With whizz ! crack ! and yell! they?re at it
pell mell!
Like a few hundred lunatics loosed from a cell;
With yell! crack! and whizz! and whizz! yell!
and crack!
Their ardour?s alreafiy beginning to slack;
A yell or two more! and the battle is o?er,
Without any killing, without any gore,
And only a few heads and bones feeling sore.
They wound up the day with a full-dress cor-
roborree,
And kicked up a terrible shindy and bobbery.
The maid, it is said, was content to be wed,
Notwithstanding the pain she still felt in her
head;
But being a black, of course she would lack
That delicate sense of the proper knack,
Which our maidens have learnt, of keeping back;
And, as you have seen, she was his in a crack!


LAY OF A CRACK(ED) RIFLEMAN.
! woe is me that e?er T joined
'r[<- These hated volunteers;
My martial fire has long been spent ?
I?m loaded now with fears.
Though not a swell, I?m still re-fined;
I cannot stand at ease;
I make a point to cover all,
And do my best to please.
Sometimes we go to form a square,
And yet its square to me
I never can make out my place,
Though plain as A B C.
There?s high guards, low guards in the set ?
Not blackguards, by-the-bye;
They do some rifling though, and slope,
And sometimes port ?when dry.
I?ve oft determined to retire;
Yet, loth to shorten arms,
I still wheel into line again,
And shrink not from alarms
Though tired and sore I?ll take the fix,
Though, faix, I hope not long;
If I advance with your support
I surely can?t go wrong.
But this won?t do; I must close up;
?Tis rank enough, I see;
I?m not inclined to file it off?
To flank it I?ll agree.

Young men, take warning ere you join;
?Be happy while you can.?

SONG,
M J EYER doubt me, my own darling Lily,
While I live in the light of thy smile,
The whole world may turn topsy-turvy,
And the moon wear a black Sunday ? tile?.
Think?st thou I could forfeit for ever
The love that has made thee so dear i
No! rather I?d live on green apples,
And drink only Castlemaine beer.
When I look in thy face, my sweet charmer,
There?s a spell that still makes me
forget
The dust and the hot-windy weather,
And the streets by the Yan Yean unwet:
?Neath thy smile I am bound by enchant-
ment ;
?Neath thy frown I am burdened with
pain,
Like some wretch with a horrible toothache,
Who is racked till he?s nearly insane.
I feel on my hand the soft pressure,
When your fingers a moment met mine,
Like the warmth of a nice hot potato,
That the pieman brings round about nine;
\

Yes, I cling to tlune own darling image,
As a native bear clings to a tree:
Then let the world flout me and scorn me,
Like a bird I?ll fly swiftly to thee.
WAITING.
hi/ SANG, for my heart was heavy,
A song that was full of pain,
When the wild wind without was roaring,
And overhead pattered the rain:
I sang, for I knew that the morning
Would come with the cares of the day;
I sang in a voice melancholy,
And these were the words of my lay:
? I know that without one is waiting
Alone in the cold morning air,
Who heeds not the frown of the weather ?
Ah, yes! ray heart says one is there:
There are eyes that look up with a flashing,
And lips that still move with a sound;
There?s a brow that is clouded and heavy;
There?s a smile I?d not meet for a pound.
? Who waits in the cold rainy morning?
Who waits there and won?t go away?
Whom fear I to meet on the pavement,
Should I seek the fair face of the day?
Be strong, 0 great heart! that is bursting!
Be still, while I utter my shame! -
It?s a bailiff without there is waiting ?
Brown?s bailiff?l don?t know his name!?

( On the change of colour in her hair.)
OUR hair may change from fair to gold,
Or yet a deeper hue;
Think you ?twill make old friends grow cold,
Or prove their love less true?
Not so?what though the colour be
A jest for idle fools?
The wise, forbearing, will agree
It follows nature?s rules.
It is the change of feeling makes
A lovely form less dear;
The fickle flights that fancy takes
Are what we still most fear.
Change is lot of earthly things,
And we must learn to bear
Content the semblance that time brings
To make the body fair.
Then, let your hair be fair or gold,
Or even the fiery hue;
This comfort take; when you are old,
?T wont matter if it?s blue !

RHYMES AND JINGLES. 21
TO MY DEPARTED UMBRELLA.
BITTER grief is at my heart;
[I wonder where the thing has got,]
The sighs break out, the tear drops start;
[Confound it too! the weather?s hot!]
I loved thee, O my gentle friend;
[?Tis strange! I brought it home last
night.]
Thine arm was ready to defend;
[It?s scarcely been out of my sight.]
Thou?st followed me through storm and sun;
[I put it in the stand, I know.]
Too short, alas! thy race is run;
[Could I have lent it? Hang it, no!]
To some bereavements we submit;
[The handle bore my crest and name.]
But tearful grief for thee were fit;
[It served as stick when I was lame.]
,/
I shall notecase to think of thee;
[I should have liked the thief to ?grab;?]
But stay ?a thought occurs to me ?
[I must have left it in the cab!]

SENSATION.
NLIKE the steady times of old,
With modern education,
Has come a need, which art supplies
With limitless sensation.
?Tis not confined to class or creed,
Nor bound by rhyme nor reason;
Old tastes have changed, and so folks say,
Give us the things in season.
Take up a book, what theme you like,
Some startling revelation
Crops up before you?ve read half through,
To work a wild sensation.
You go to hear a play, my friend,
(From dramatists defend us!)
?Formosa,? p?rhaps; or, ?After Dark.?
Sensation was tremendous!
You seek some scientific crowd,
Who smile at weak sensation;
And forthwith hear that Brown or Smith
Has overturned creation!
You visit Maulstick?s studio ?
What?s this queer adumbration?
0, Daniel in the lions? den,
Got up for a sensation!
You go to hear the Reverend Mild,
A man of of wondrous learning,
And straight you hear that hell?s a myth,
With all its brimstone burning.
? |.


You take a turn some day in court;
A crowd has congregated
To hear some horrid murder out,
And be sensation-sated.
Go where you will, list where you please,
The cry at every station
Is, ?Have you heard the latest news?
? WhaLis the last sensation??
MOTLEY?S THE ONLY WEAR.
SHE kings of old were not less wise
Than monarchs now who flout them,
One proof of which is, that they had
Their wits always about them.
ONLY A MISTAKE.
SAT down to write to Matilda
�) Some sweet little something in rhyme,
To send by the post to St. Kilda,
Ere the joy of our next meeting-time:
I wrote in the soft soothing twilight,
When fanciful feelings are fed;
The stars I could see through the skylight,
Like spirits of love overhead.


I wrote that her smile was bewitching,
With her face there was none to compare;
I praised her nice woolwork and stitching;
And said some soft things of hnr hair:
I wrote in a lover-like fashion,
Of walks and talks under the moon;
And twaddled of hearts and of passion,
And made myself out ? a gone coou.?
Alas! for the ardour of feeling!
Alas! for the love that was mine!
To-day there has come a revealing ?
Over blighted affection I pine :
By mistake, I sent Lirriper?s letter,
Which requested I?d soon name a day
When some twenty pounds sterling or better,
I?d make it my business to pay!
PARONOMASIA.
OME say that punning is too base
($T> For educated folks;
I pity those who do not love
Our English arts of hoax.
?Tis true, some cannot bear a pun;
That?s why, no doubt, they sneer
At better minds, whose grains of wit
Are always in the ear.


Did Shakspeare, think you, scorn a pun?
Did even Milton grave
Disdain to quibble now and then,
Did others too, of well-known fame,
Disparage ?Attic? wit,
AN OLD FRIEND IN A NEW CHARACTER,
? A LD .IS' icky got tired of wand?ring of late,
And thought of some new occupation;
But much it puzzled him which to choose
Says he, ? I?ve the run of the various trades;
I?ve gone through a gamut of fashions;
1 want something new, that will hit people?s
tastes,
And work up their sluggish passions.?
Let moody critics snap and growl?
Their dog-mas never heed;


(
He sat down to think, but he couldn?t decide
On a trade that would suit his capacity;
And Nicky grew ? riled ? at what he con-
ceived
His want of inventive audacity.
Says he, u Curse it all ! Here?s a nice state
of things,
When a demon of my known ability
Can?t hit on some new-fangled, ?gilded
device,?
To show off his wondrous facility.?
He conned and he thought in a sort of despair,
Till at last, with a wild exultation,
He yelled out, ? Eureka! I?ve got it at last!
Here?s an end to my botheration!?
He had heard, as he sat, some wandering imp
Calling out all the weekly papers;
And a notion came into the demon?s head
Of cutting some curious capers.
? Ho, ho!? with a chuckle, ?I never thought
Of the press as a suitable station;
I?ll take the post of a weekly scribe,
And the d 1 will give them sensation!?


WATTLE SONG.
SOME sing of the scent of the rose,
While chorusing over the bottle;
But give me the man, sir, whose nose
Delights in the scent of the wattle.
Chorus ? Sing, sing, let the chorus ring,
There?s nothing delights like the wattle.
Let others sing high and sing low,
Until they grow dry in the throttle;
For me, I will sing till I glow,
In sounding the praise of the wattle.
Chorus. ?Sing, sing. &c.
It is not the fairest of trees;
To say so would be but a story;
But, fanned by the summer breeze,
?Tis then it appears in its glory.
Chorus. ?Sing, sing, &c.
Here?s a song to my favourite tree?
Sing out with a voice that is mellow;
Hurrah! through the wild forest free,
Hurrah! for its blossoms yellow.
Chorus. ?Sing, sing, &c.
Let others delight in the rose,
While chorusing over the bottle;
But give me the man, sir, whose nose
Delights in the scent of the wattle.
Chorus. ?Sing, sing, let the chorus ring,
There?s nothing delights like the wattle.


A DIFFERENCE.
gROWN and Jones had fallen out
Over some small matter;
Each of cour'se was in the right,
And mad as any hatter.
They met one day: says Brown to Jones,
(Brown was a foot the taller)
?A friend reports, you called me, sir,
A lily-livered crawler?
Jones, with a smile, thus answered him:
? I am no vulgar brawler;
I only said yon always wore
A linen-faced collar.?
A MUSICAL STRAIN.
Toggs was a clerk in the city,
$ And curst with a musical taste;
He?d a natural love for the ditty,
And with the band-ditty he paced.
His means were not very extensive,
Though blest with abundance of notes;
He?d a 'penchant for bars reprehensive,
And sometimes told bass anecdotes.
Though Tom was a musical penner,
(Trade never with music combines)
He scoffed at a counter-tenor,
And hated the ledger-lines.


He was a wild crotchety fellow;
Yet sometimes he?d seasons of glee,
When he sang, in a voice that was mellow,
Right fol de rol iddity-dee.
When his stomach was out of order?
A trouble with him that was chronic ?
Sweet music was still his rewarder;
He practised the scale diet-tonic.
He followed his musical notions
In e?en what he touched with his knife;
(I don?t know how?t was with his potions)
But he ate of the staff of life.
Tom sol-fa?d and quavered unceasing,
Till his body grew all of a shake,
And his sweet voice got husky and wheezing;
Then a rest he determined to take.
But alas! ?t was a rest for ever ?
Disappointment the poor man had floored;
He at last, in a frenzied endeavour,
Hung himself with a common chord !
UNQUESTIONABLE.
Skills truth, methinks, must be confessed:
01 (The point at once you?ll scan)
A poet, even at the best,
Is but an idyll man.


Should come down rather pat.
It puts me in a passion,
To see the modern fashion
Make ladies look such guys,
By hiding nose and eyes.
And oft it makes me smile
To see what you call style;
Such style to any lover
Is hard to be got over.
You think it, p?rhaps, a ?neat,?
? Duck of a thing,? and ? sweet;?
I am inclined to think
It?s not perfection?s pink.
Put up that horrid hair
In fashion debonair;
I Assume a decent hat,
And not a shapeless mat.
1 ' . . ? ? I-
ON A LADY?S HAT.
O praise a dress or bonnet,
Some men would write a sonnet;
I cannot quite do that
To dignify your hat.
But is it hat or bonnet?
I wouldn?t bet upon it;
It seems so very like
A pancake on a spike.
Forgive the simile;
Perhaps it?s rather free ;
One, touching on a hat,


Think that the hat was made
Head to protect and shade;
And do not fancy that
The head was made for hat.
There, I have had my rhyme;
(Enough you think this time)
To praise a hat or bonnet,
Don?t come to me for sonnet.
REASONABLE.
8011 ask me what ?tis makes me sad,
My reason?s not extensive?
I?ve lost each penny that I had,
?Tis that which makes me pence-ive.
A MISTER-Y.
7. WAS in the street of Bourke one day,
(i gJ I saw a solemn seedy man,
Up-gazing at that noble pile,
They mark ? Post Office? on the plan
Of Melbourne.
? Why do you gaze, O seedy man,
With dreamy, sad, yet wistful eyes?
Why do you look upon this-pile? ?
But to my very great surprise,
He said, ? Geelong.?


? Perhaps,? I said, ?you?d know the time;
If so, I?ll tell you straight along;
Your eyes, perchance, are rather dim;?
He only said aloud, ? Geelong.?
A curious man.
What could he mean? I said, ? Perhaps,
You are an architect, and see
Something you very much admire;?
At once he fiercely turned on me,
And said, ? Geelong.?
?You are an artist, p?rhaps,? I said,
?And look upon this chaste design
With critic eye. Perhaps you see
Some flaw.? He gave a painful whine,
Aud said, ? Geelong.?
? You must he mad or drunk,? I said,
?To stand here in the busy throng,
And gaze upon the lifeless stone,
And mutter nothing but * Geelong:? ?
He said, ?Geelong.?
I left him in the street of Bourke,
Still gazing at that noble pile,
With dreamy, sad, yet wistful eyes,
That solemn man in seedy ? tile,?
Who said, ? Geelong.?
But who he was, and whence he came,
Remains a mystery to me;
And what he meant by saying still
? Geelong,? I can?t exactly see ?
Perhaps you can.


TO A SERIOUS LADY.
c jtr OFTEN wonder liow it is
55) You always look so grave;
Perhaps you?re in a bilious state,
Or thinking how to save.
Perhaps your lover?s had a tiff,
And gone away to sea;
Perhaps piano?s not in tune,
Because you?ve smashed a key.
Perhaps ?tis headache troubles you;
Perhaps your scents all gone;
Perhaps your hair, in proper trim,
Wont rest your head upon.
Perhaps your milliner?s defunct;
Perhaps your father?s cross;
Perhaps your brother?s fond of slang;
Perhaps you?ve had a loss.
Perhaps you have a nasty corn;
Perhaps a tooth that aches;
Perhaps the cook?s dismissed, and you
Have had to bake the cakes.
Perhaps you have no book to read;
Perhaps you?ve seen a ghost;
Perhaps you?re disappointed in
Your letters by the post.
Perhaps you want another dress;
Perhaps you?ve got a cold.;
Perhaps there is some secret that
You havn?t yet been told.


34 AUSTRALIAN
Perhaps?but I can plainly see,
It?s vain to speculate;
I can?t make out whatever could
Have made you so sedate.
A QUACK.
SpHE man whom the ladies would call
Ol A ? duck? of a doctor, alack!
Is the man with no talent at all,
Whom we rightly describe as a quack.
fOME say that in homes in the forest,
Deep down in the echoing dells,
Dwell fairies and dryads, whose power is
To weave round the heart magic spells.
None know where their hidden dwellings
Are, under the shadowy trees;
For eye of none human or mortal
Their wonderful loveliness sees.
And each year they choose out a maiden,
On whom magic gifts they bestow,
To wield the dread wand of enchantment,
And bind with her spells high and low.


This secret, it seems to me, Maggie,
You?ve got from the frolicsome fays;
For you have bewitched me for ever,
M ith your loving and light-hearted ways.
THE PUNSTER?S PASSION.
SUSAN ! an unworthy wight
Sues on his knees to you;
Take pity on his wretched plight,
So pit j-fool to view.
Ah ! do not set my love at naught,
I n autocratic way;
For woe would in my soul be wrought,
If you should answer nay.
The coarse of love did ne?er run smooth,
So says my Shakspeare wise;
And very hitter is the truth,
My galled heart replies.
Ah, lady! if you could but know
The wretchedness I feel,
Isot vainly to a belle , I trow,
Would then be my appeal .
But bid me hope, I?ll offer you
All that a heart can give?
As proof of my affection true,
Here is my negative.
