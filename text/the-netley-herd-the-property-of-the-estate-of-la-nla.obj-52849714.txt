THE NETLEY HERD.
Owners —The Estate of the late John Dunne.
W HIS herd was started in the year 18(57 by the late Joseph Dunne,
and carried on by him till his death in 1874. From that year it was
continued by the late John Dunne until 1893. In 1874 the bull Deucalion
was bought from the late Robt. M*Dougall, Arundel, Victoria, and from
then on to the year 1893 nothing but pedigreed bulls were used. Mr. John
Dunne, the present manager, took charge of the herd in 1893, and, with
tho exception of the bull Deucalion, noted above, the bulls in this
pamphlet have been used, and the whole of them have been specially
selected animals either entered or eligible for entry in the “ Shorthorn
Herd Book of Australia.” At the present time the following srires are
in use : —Belinda Dukes of Derrimut 381st and 427th, bred by Sir Rupert
Clarke, Bart.; Lindenow Dukes of Derrimut 55th, 68th, 70th, 73rd, 75th,
and 82nd, bred by A. J. Webb, Rathfarnham ; Dundas Duke of Derrimut
9th, bred by A. J. Simpson, Clifton ; Milton’s Dundas and Milton's Lord
Waterloo 45th, bred by Anthony Hordern, Milton Park, N.S.W. ; Nyingay
Summerton 21st, bred by Roy Simson, Mungadal, N.S.W. ; Eli Elwah
Duke of Derrimut 27th, bred by H. L. Austin, Eli Elwah, N.S.W. ; Kuyura
Beau Gazelle, bred by F. Thoneraann, Kuyura, Q.
From 1896 to 1903 inclusive the herd was bred to Angas bulls, 14 pure-
bred bulls from that herd being introduced. From 1904 to the present
time Derrimut Stud Book bulls have been used with great success.
The females of the herd have been carefully classed all through, and,
of late years, by Alex. Lang.
Bulls from the Netley herd are well and favourably known throughout
Western New South Wales, the North of South Australia, Western Aus-
tralia, and Queensland, and wherever introduced have given great
satisfaction.
Herd bulls, cows, and heifers for sale.

NOTES.—NYINGAY SUMMERTON 21st.
Grand Duke of Clifton 4th, a roan bull of much substance, with remark-
able shorthorn character. He is proving a fine sire. He is by Lindenow
Duke of Derrimut 40th, one of the most notable of all Australian sires,
and out of Belinda Duchess of Derrimut 400th, one of the most beautiful
and the most successful breeder of all the cows in Australia at the present
time. Grand Duke of Clifton 4th is full brother to the following notable
animals, all bred by Mr. A. J. Simpson, Clifton, Hamilton, Victoria: —
Grand Duke of Clifton, Mr. Lomax’s champion bull of Queensland, one of
the most magnificent bulls of Australia ; Grand Duke of Clifton 2nd, first
and champion at the 1915 Sydney Royal Show when under two years,
probably the finest show bull seen in recent years, and sold to Mr. Anthony
Hordern for 800 guineas ; Grand Duke of Clifton 6th, a beautiful white
bull, and the leading sire in Mr. A. J. Webb’s stud, Rathfarnham, Vic-
toria ; also to Grand Duchess of Clifton 2nd, a beautiful cow, purchased
by Mr. H. L. Austin, Hay, for 1,000 guineas, and winner of the champion
prize, Melbourne, 1920, and reserve champion, Sydney, 1921.
Burgundy (123), deep red, was bred by the Mahonga Co. He was a
thick, heavy-fleshed bull, with a grand middle-piece and a good coat of
hair. He has bred well; on two occasions bulls by him topped the Sydney
sale averages, making to 400 guineas. His sire, Spicy Peer, 80,033 (im-
ported), took first prize as a two-year-old at the Sydney Show, 1903,
and proved a great sire, the most notable of his get being Spicy Peer 2nd
(471), who took first prize and reserve champion, Sydney Show, 1904,
and made 525 guineas at the sales —at that time easily a record for many
years. Burgundy's dam was the beautiful imported cow Vintage 2nd,
a roan cow with thick flesh and nice character. She also bred well, being
the dam of Lord of the Vintage, first prize yearling bull, Sydney Show,
1912.
Belinda Duke of Derrimut 208th (81) is Sir B. T. H. Clarke’s celebrated
sire, who was champion bull at the Royal Shows, Melbourne, 1903, 1904,
1905, 1906, and 1908, and got by Duke of York 2nd, 68,546: dam the
well-known Belinda Duchess of Derrimut 75th, winner of eleven firsts
and eight champion prizes. Belinda Duke of Derrimut 208tb, by reason
of his record in the show-ring and the success of those animals descended
from him, is probably the greatest bull the Summerton tribe has produced.
Belinda Duke of Derrimut 29th (58), by Charming Duke 3rd, the sire
of Belinda Duchess of Derrimut 30th, the dam of Belinda Duke of Derri-
mut 10th, twice champion at Royal Show, Melbourne, and afterwards
sold for £5OO. Belinda Duke of Derrimut 29th is out of a full sister to
Belinda Duchess of Derrimut Bth, the champion cow for years. She
took nineteen firsts, six seconds, two thirds, and eleven champions.
Belinda Duke of Derrimut 29th was very heavily fleshed, very even, and a
good handler.
