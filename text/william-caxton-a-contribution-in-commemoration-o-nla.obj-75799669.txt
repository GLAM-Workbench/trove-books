ORIGIN OF THE CENTENARY MOVEMENT.
The movement for a Caxton commemoration in Melbourne was
initiated at a public meeting held at the Criterion Hotel, on Saturday,
sth August, which was attended by a number of persons connected
in various capacities with printing and literature. Mr. H. J. Smith
was called to .the chair. It was suggested by the promoters that it
was desirable to commemorate in some way the fourth centenary
period of the first printing in the English language, and of its in-
troduction into England by Caxton ; and that whatever form the
celebration might take, it should be held with a view to the esta-
blishment of some lasting memorial of the occasion, as for example,
the formation of a fund for the aid of necessitous persons connected
with the different branches of printing and literature. The idea was
warmly taken up by the meeting, and a resolution proposed by the
Hon. G. P. Smith, and seconded by the Hon. H. Spensley, affirming
the desirability of such a celebration was unanimously agreed to. A
committee of fourteen was accordingly appointed, the number being
subsequently increased to twenty-nine, and steps were taken to secure
the co-operation of all likely to-be interested in the movement.
Another general meeting was held at the Criterion Hotel, on
Saturday, 12th August, when proposals were submitted concerning
the ultimate object of the movement. It was suggested by some
that almshouses should be established ; others were in favor of the
foundation of a scholarship at the Melbourne University; while the
project which the committee recommended was that a Benevolent
Fund should be instituted. To meet the views of all, a resolution pro-
posed by Mr. James Harrison was agreed to in the following terms:
? That tlie Proceeds of the celebration be appropriated to the establish-
ment of a Caxton I und for benevolent and educational purposes.?
The measures to be adopted for the purpose of raising funds were
left to the consideration of a sub-committee, consisting of Messrs.
H. J. Smith, the Hon. G. P. Smith, W. McKinley, H. Collier, A. Brit-
ton, E. C. Amsinck, and J. Ferres. Mr. H. J. Smith was appointed
Hon. Treasurer of the fund, and Messrs. A. Britton and E. C. Am-
sinck Hon. Secretaries. After holding frequent meetings, and ex-
pending a good deal of time in making enquiries, and arranging the


necessary preliminaries, the sub-committee were enabled to submit a
scheme to the General Committee, by whom it was approved of.
The recommendations of the sub-committee were embraced in a
report which was laid by the general committee before a public
meeting, held on the 30th September. The scheme includes a course
of lectures of a popular nature, which the undermentioned gentlemen
have kindly consented to deliver as follows: ?Nov. 14th, by the Rev.
Charles Clark, on ? Oliver Goldsmith,;? Nov, 20th, by Professor
McCoy, on ?Progressive Development;? Dec. 4th, by the Hon. C.
Gavan Duffy, Chief Secretary, on a subject to be afterwards an-
nounced ; Dec. 18th, by Mr. Anthony Trollope, the celebrated
novelist, on ? Modern Fiction, as a Rational Amusement.? Ihe
scheme also embraced a Cricket Match on the Melbourne Ground,
between Members of Parliament and Members of the Press, which
was held on Saturday, October 28th, with satisfactory results. As to
the final celebration or Festival which it is proposed to hold, the
committee reported that the shape it should assume had not yet been
finally decided upon, but that it would be of such a character that all
would be able to take part in it. It appeared from the committee?s
report, that a handsome proposal had been made by the committee
of the Yorick Club, viz., to collect from the members of the club a
number of papers for publication in book form at Christmas, and to
hand over the proceeds to the Caxton Fund. This generous offer was
of course gladly accepted, and the committee of the Yorick Club
ordered to be thanked for their kindness in the matter.
In accordance with a further suggestion, an important step was
taken by the meeting. The committee recommended, in order to
give stability to the movement, and to insure the proper application
of the funds likely to be raised, that only those persons who became
donors of at least �1 Is. on or before the 6th November, should be
entitled to a voice in the disposal of the moneys, and that subscribers
of this amount and upwards should be called the founders of the
? Caxton Fund.? The proposition, after some discussion, was agreed
to, and a resolution passed in accordance with the committee?s sug-
gestion. It is not intended that the founders shall have the entire
management of the fund for life, but it is to be left to them to deal
with the moneys in the first instance, and to make suitable provision
for the future maintenance and management of the fund.
The compiler desires to acknowledge the kindness of the Hon. C. Gavan Duffy,
Chief Secretary, in granting permission to print this pamphlet at the Government
Printing Office; and also to acknowledge the generosity of the gentlemen of the
Printing Department who gave their services towards its production.


THE RISE OF PRINTING.
At the time of the discovery of Printing we learn that
the world was recovering from a state of ignorance;
learning was being patronised in almost every country of
Europe; laudable zeal was exerted in searching libraries
for valuable books, which had lain in obscurity, and
which were scarce, great numbers being lost in times of
ignorance. Manuscripts were multiplied, but the price
was such that none but men of fortune could purchase
them, ?120 crowns being considered a moderate price for
a Livy , and 80 crowns for three volumes of Plutarch's
Lives; a few manuscripts were thought a portion worthy
a nobleman?s daughter.
Translators, in their eagerness to enrich themselves,
mutilated and corrupted the best authors, and hence arise
those frequent complaints against their negligence and
ignorance, which have cost the learned so much study
and labor to remedy. John Andreas, bishop of Aleria,
in his dedication prefixed to Pliny's Natural History ,
printed at Rome in 1470, says that ? though he had
spent nine whole years in correcting that author, yet
ninety more would not complete a correct edition.?


Great were the difficulties to be encountered at this
period, through the unsatisfactory method of multiplying
manuscripts. The necessity for a more efficient system
was no doubt urgently felt, and stimulated the inventors
of printing to those persevering efforts, which resulted in
a discovery so beneficial to the world, and of such honor
and advantage to themselves.
The art of printing from engraved blocks of wood and
metal was known to the Chinese some hundred years
before it was practised in Europe; but it is not our
purpose to inquire respecting the Chinese method, except
to note that a similar system was adopted in Germany
about the year 1436, and that about ten years after, the
invention of printing from moveable types was happily
perfected by John Gutenberg, John Faust, and Peter
Schoefeer, each being a citizen of Mentz, in Germany.
The first book printed with cast metal types was
Durandi Rationale which was not finished till 1459.
It is surprising that the invention of an art, so curious
in its nature, and so highly beneficial in its consequences,
should be shrouded in so much mystery, that we find not
only individuals, but cities and countries contending for
the honor of the discovery. We receive some light upon
this point from a*few inscriptions used by Faust, at the
end of his first printed books, to this purpose: ?? This
present work , with all its embellishments , was done , not with
pen and ink, hut by a new invented Art of Casting Letters ,
Printing , fc,, by me John Faust, and my son-in-law
Peter Schoeffer, in the famous city of Mentz, upon the
Rhine.? We have reason to rejoice in the fruit of their
labors. Never was human thought and industry crowned
with so ample a harvest!


O Mentz I proud city, long thy fame enjoy,
For with the Press thy glory ne?er shall die,
Still may thy guardian battlements withstand
The ruthless shock of War?s destructive hand,
Where Gutenberg with toil incessant wrought
The imitative lines of written thought ;
And as his art a nobler effort made,
The sweeping lever his commands obey?d ;
Elastic halls the sable stains supply,
Light o?er the forme the sheeted tympans fly ;
The beautious work returning leaves unfold,
As with alternate force the axle roll?d.
His bosom now unbounded joys expand,
A printed volume owns his forming hand !
The curious work from sculptur?d blocks imprest,
The rising glories of his art confest !
To give to distant times a name more dear,
To spread the blessings thro? a wider sphere,
Schoeffer and Faust with kindling ardour fir?d,
Lent the strong aid that thirst of fame, inspir?d ;
The stubborn block, with rude unchanging form,
One end could answer, but one task perform,
Till Faust, with all his powers of genius ripe,
Struck the fine die, and cast the moving type,
That ever, as the curious artist will?d
In some new station, some new office fill?d.
With ancient Mentz, our cent?ral point of art,
In the proud race the neighbouring cities start,
Spreading, as light diverges from its source,
The great invention through a distant course ;
Thronging around, the candidates for fame
To breath new life in countless numbers came,
Press for the meed which we alone bestcfw,
The source from which immortal honors flow.
From John Me Cr eery*s poem of the ?The Press.?


INTRODUCTION OF FEINTING
INTO ENGLAND.
-? ???
Theke is a small book of forty-one quarto leaves in the
University of Cambridge, said to have been printed in the
University of Oxford, December 17, in the year 14G8,
by Frederick Corsellis; but this book appears to have
received no notice till 1664 (nearly 200 years after),
when Richard Atkyns, a barrister, published an account
of it, and also of an old manuscript said to have been
preserved at Lambeth, corroborative of the genuineness
of the book. But it is difficult to account for the
silence of history respecting an event so memorable, and
also for the fact that there is no record in the University
itself of the establishment of the new art amongst them.
It has been supposed by some writers upon the merits
of the Oxford book that an x was omitted in the Roman
numerals, and if such were the case, the date would be
1478. The type used in the book appears to have been
the same as that used in printing the two books issued
from the Oxford press in 1479, one in 1480, one in 1481,
and one in 1485. These are all the books known to have
been printed there up to the year 1500. A lazy press
indeed, in comparison with that of Mayster Wylyam
Cax ton, which he set up at Westminster.


We would here remark, that the romance of the
discovery of the old manuscript (which no one but
Atkyns appears to have seen), very much resembles
Chatterton?s discoveries at Redcliffe, Bristol, which the
clever but misguided young man endeavored to foist upon
the London publisher.
It is William Caxton to whom England owes the
introduction of printing, and we produce the following
positive evidence in support of his claim;
Stowe, in his Survey of London , speaking of the year
1458 says, ? the noble science of printing was about this
time found at Magunce, by John Gutenberg, a knight;
and William Caxton, of London, mercer, brought it into
England about the year 1471, and practised the same in
the abbie at Westminster.? Trussel gives the same
account in the History of Henry VI, and Sir Richard
Baker in his Chronicle ; and Mr. Howell, in his Londino-
polis describes the place where the Abbot of Westminster
set up the first press for Caxton?s use, in the Almonry or
Ambry. But above all we have the testimony of John
Leland, the antiquary, library keeper to Henry YIIL,
who lived near to Caxton?s own time. He expressly calls
Caxton the First Printer op England, and speaks
honorably of his works; and as he had spent some time at
Oxford, after having first studied and taken a degree at
Cambridge, he could hardly be ignorant of the origin and
history of printing at that University, if a press had
really existed there in 1468. We think the foregoing
establishes the unquestionable right of William Caxton
to the distinguished honor of having introduced the art
of printing into England.


The first book ever printed in the English language is
entitled Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye. This was
printed by William Caxton, at Cologne, and was finished
on the 19th September, 1471,
Four Hundred Years since.
Caxton gives the following account of himself, in his
preface to the above work, which was translated by him
out of the French of Raoul le Fevre, Priest:?
? When I remember myself of my unperfitness in both
languages?ln Fraunce was I never, and was born and
lerned myne Englissh in Kente, in the Weeld, where
Englissh is spoken broad and rude.?l have continued for
the most part in the countries of Brabant, Flanders,
Holland, and Zeland. ?The Dutchesse of Bourgoyne, sis-
ter of the King of England, when she had seen v or yi
quairs, found default in myne Englissh, which she com-
maunded me to ammand, and to continue and make
an end of the residue, ?whose commaund I durst not
disobey.?
We are left to surmise the date of Caxton?s birth.
Oldys states the year 1412. In his works he expresses
his gratitude to his parents for having caused him to be
instructed in his youth, and thereby ? to get his living
truly.? It is conjectured that he was apprenticed to
Robert Large, a mercer or merchant of London, and
who was afterward Lord Mayor. Books and manuscripts
were amongst the commodities in which they dealt. It is
evident that Caxton conducted himself to his master?s
satisfaction, as on his death he bequeathed him a legacy
of twenty marks, a large sum in those days?l44l.
On the death of his master he quitted England for


the Low Countries, and in 1464 he was commissioned,
with one Richard Whitehill, to conclude a treaty of trade
and commerce between Edward the Fourth and Philip of
Burgundy. This fact proves him to have had a consider-
able knowledge of commercial aifairs, combined with a
sound judgment.
During his residence abroad Caxton was for some
time in the direct employ of the Duchess of Burgundy,
occupying an honorable position. He was well cared for,
and treated with confidence, for which he expresses his
gratitude. It was at the request of this lady that he
finished his translation of the History of Troy , on the
completion of which she rewarded him largely.
The exact date of Caxton?s return to his native
country is uncertain, as is also the date at which he in-
troduced the first types and press; but Stowe, as we have
related, says that it was about the year 1471. His first
book with a date is the Came of Chess, printed in 1474.
Caxton used a device, of which the following is a copy:?
W. G. stands for William Caxton, and the figure between
for 74, i. e. 1474 ; the 7 is plainly seen, and the 4 is as
the figure was made at that period. As this device was
used in many of his works printed at a later period, it is
supposed to be the date at which he printed the first book
in England; but this is mere conjecture. Twenty-eight
publications are known to have been printed by him
without date, but whether before or after the above


Caxton does not inform us, and it is now impossible to
determine. One writer, who had compared the above
with another edition of the Came of Chess, without date,
was of opinion that the latter is the oldest, as the type
with which it is. printed is new, while that of the dated
edition is worn.
A second edition (without date) of the one issued
in 1474 was printed and illustrated with wood-cuts, of
which the following is a specimen.
The most extensive collections of Caxton?s works are
in the British Museum, and in the library of Earl Spencer,
at Althorpe; that in the former numbers about forty-six.
The following is a copy of a kind of prospectus issued
by Caxton, still in existence, although there is no copy of
the pamphlet to which it refers. It runs thus: ?


?Jf it plm an# man spiritual or temporal, to h#e
on# p#rsi of ttoo or tfjre rommmorario?s of Mlisfiuti use,
enpr#ntilr after tfje forme of fljte preset lettre, toljid) fien
toel anlr trul# eorreet, late tjim eome to toestmonester, into
tfje almonestr#e, at reeb pale, anb shall habe
poll efjepe
supplieo stet crtmla.?
No doubt our old printer drove a good trade at the sign
of the ? reeh pale.?
William Caxton continued at work till the day of his
death, which took place in the year 1491; so that if the
date of his birth is correctly stated, his age when he
died would be seventy-nine years. In the churchwardens?
book of St. Margaret?s parish, Westminster, the death of
William Caxton is thus recorded :
? 1491. Item, atte bureyng of William Caxton for iiij
torches vj s, viij d.
Item, for the helle atte same lureyng vj d.
In the foregoing brief sketch we consider sufficient
has been shown to justify us in awarding to Caxton that
praise which he deserves, for establishing in his native
land an art so vast and important, that ? the productions
of men of genius and learning, the records of literature
and of science, of whatever is either brilliant in imagin-
ation or profound in thought, whatever may either ad-
vance or improve the human mind, ?thenceforth became
imperishable! The light of knowledge cannot again be
quenched?it is free, and open, and accessible as the air
we breathe. The future history of the world may, indeed,
disclose enough both of misery and of vice; but it cannot
again present an universal blank, or be disgraced by
another age of utter and cheerless ignorance.?


By Ebenezer Elliott.
Lord ! taught by thee, when Caxton bade
His silent words for ever speak ;
A grave for tyrants then was made?
Then crack?d the chain which yet shall break.
With study worn, the all-scorn?d man
For bread, for bread, his press prepared ;
He knew not, Lord ! thy wond?rous plan !
Nor why, nor what, he did and dared.
When first the might of deathless thought
Impress?d the far instructing page?
Unconscious giant, how he smote,
The fraud and force of many an age.
The power he grasp?d let none disdain,
It conquer?d then and conquers still!
By fraud and force assailed in vain,
It conquer?d then and ever will.
It conquers here I the fight is won I
We thank thee, Lord ! with many a tear ;
For many a not unworthy son
Of Caxton does thy bidding here.
We help ourselves?thy cause we aid ;
We build for heaven, beneath the skies ;
And bless thee, Lord, that thou hast made
Our daily bread a tyrant?s sighs.


THE PRESS IN VICTORIA.
Printing was introduced into Melbourne, Victoria, in
March, 1838, by the late J. P. Fawkner, Esq., and at
Geelong, in November, 1840, by James Harrison, Esq.
The first printing machine in Australia, capable of
being worked by steam, was erected at the Herald Office,
in 1850, by the late George Cavenagh, Esq.
The following list of Newspapers and Periodicals pub-
lished in Victoria at this date (November, 1871), shows
the rapid spread and progress of the press since the
foundation of the colony in 1836.
