A SHIP
PORT PHILLIP.
Explanation of Storm Signals.
Tee existence of Gales which are likely to endanger
F(-S43o«v
shipping, will be signalled at the Principal Telegraph
Stations, on the Coast of New South Wales, in the
following manner, viz. :
The signal masts will support two yards, which are to
cross each other at right angles, in the direction of the
cardinal points of the compass,—the yard arms denoting,
respectively, north, east, south, and west; midway
between north and east will indicate north-east, &c.
A violent squall will be represented by a conspicuous
diamond-shaped signal.
A heavy sea will be represented by a drum-shaped signal.
Gale , with clear weather , will be represented by a diamond-
shaped signal over a drum.
Gale , with thick weather ami rain , will be represented by a
diamond-shaped figure with a drum over it.
The direction from which a gale is blowing will be indicated
by the particular yard-arm between which and the mast-
head the geometrical signal is suspended.
Place where squall or gale is blowing will be shown by
hoisting the numerical flags already in use in Sydney,
Newcastle, and other Coast stations.
Gales that are general all over a large portion of the Coast
will be indicated by the geometrical figures, without the
mast-head flags.

over the other, as 3 over 4is 34—-from China. The substitute flag is used as
a duplicate, for instance, No. 3 over the substitute flag would be 33—from
Calcutta.
Explanation of General Signals.
When a vessel is first sighted, her descriptive flag is
hoisted, and the direction from which she is approaching
indicated by hoisting a ball at the north of the south yard-
arm, as the case may be.
The place from which any vessel arrives is signalled as
soon as it can be ascertained; her entrance into port is
denoted by hauling down the ball at the yard-arm ; and her
anchoring by lowering the whole of the flags.
A ball hoisted at the mast-head indicates that the vessel
last signalled is passing the port.
An immigrant ship is denoted by the numeral pendant
being hoisted over the numerical flags. When troops are
on board, the numeral pendant is hoisted under these flags.
When a vessel returns to port, the white substitute is
hoisted under the descriptive flag. When the Governor
arrives, the Union Jack is hoisted at the semaphore mast-
head.
Foreign National flags on the semaphore mast-head denote
the country of the ship signalled.
Mail Steamers.
When the P. and 0. Mail steamer arrives at Albany, the
Company’s flag alone is hoisted at semaphore mast-head ;
when she arrives at Adelaide, the Company’s flag, with a
ball over it, is hoisted at the semaphore mast-head, and kept
flying one hour ; when she arrives at Melbourne, the same
flag with a ball under it is kept flying one hour. The
arrival of the Californian Mail at Auckland is notified by
hoisting the Company’s flag.
When a ball is placed between the descriptive flag and
the numerical flags, it denotes that the vessel signalled is a
Mail Steamer.
The arrival of the P. and 0. and other Companies’
steamers is indicated by the respective Company’s flag being
hoisted on the semaphore yard-arm.
The arrival of a steamer of the A. S. N. Company’s fleet
is shown by hoisting her particular number under the
Company’s flag.
TIME BALL.
The Time Ball at the Observatory is dropped every day at
1 p.m, Sydney Standard Time, or 15 hours Greenwich Mean
Time.
Should any error occur in the time of dropping the Ball,
it will immediately be raised half-mast high, and notice
of the amount of error given in the newspapers of the
following day.
