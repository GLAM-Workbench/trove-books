INTRODUCTORY
§P<=sS) WN once more presenting our Illustrated Catalogue No. 5
d) I of Boring Machinery to the Australian Public, we
A] „ beg to announce the cancellation of all previous lists, and
A\ aT we trust that the lines upon which the Catalogue is com-
Ms piled will commend it to general approval. There are
many designs of Boring Machines upon the market, for
each of which the respective maker claims absolute pre-eminence. We
need not attempt to reconcile these conflicting claims, for, when all
has been said, the merit of any machine depends upon its adaptability
to special local requirements. , We have expert knowledge of Austra-
lian conditions', and present in this Catalogue just Such types of
machines as the local user wants. There is nothing haphazard in otfß
methods ; the various outfits described and illustrated herein are de-
signed to cover; the whole range of Australian requirements, and we,
have nothing to fear.' from an intelligent comparison of our machines
with those of any other makes. The operation of drilling artesian
wells is substantially the same everywhere, but geological formations
vary that differences in tools are often required. Our exten-
sive experience in Australia enables us to accurately determine what
class of plant, and what tools are most suitable for the different locali-
ties ; and in all our plants we supply everything that is likely to be
required, thereby minimising die chances of expensive delays for addi-
tional tools, which may often occur when they are not on hand.
Manufacturers who supply one class of plant only, often send them to
localities for which they are entirely unsuitable, thereby causing need-
less expense and unsatisfactory work.
We have done over 200,000 feet of boring'in New South Wales,
Queensland, and West Australia, with the various systems as shown
in this Catalogue, and are prepared, upon application, to give estimates
as to- cost, and to take contracts.
■ ; / ’
WATER is, of all elements, the most necessary in every de-
partment of human activity. It is also the most widely distributed
and Jibe most easily accessible, and once the laws of its oissq^crence


beneath the earth’s surface are recognised, there is no reason —except
an incredible wilfulness —why the pastoralist or agriculturalist should
let his stock starve or his crop perish.
Ignorant guesswork, and the superstition of the Divining Rod,
are no weapons with which to fight drought and disease. The man
on the land cannot afford to play with chance while his sheep and
cattle die of hunger and the ills attendant upon a dryj season. He
has need of scientific methods to secure himself against disaster.
AUSTRALIA HAS A NATURAL FORMATION FOR
ARTESIAN SUPPLIES. These supplies are continuous and inex-
haustible, and solve the whole problem of irrigation in a country of
uncertain rainfall.
It is not the purpose of our Catalogue to give a technical ex-
position of the laws governing Australia’s artesian reservoirs, but we
cordially invite further enquiry from all who are interested in tapping
these sources of supply, and shall be glad to place our expert know-
ledge at their service.
The illustrations are supposed to depict the tools, etc., as cor-
rectly as possible, but allowance must be made for improvements
effected, also for variations in the different sizes.
Articles sent us for repair must have the sender’s name and
address plainly stated on the shipping tag. Letter of advice should
be mailed promptly, stating when and how the goods are to be for-
warded, together with any other necessary instructions.
We have embodied in this Catalogue some useful tables, also
Windmill capacities, which will be of service to the man on the land,
so that our various friends can “ lay this Catalogue by ” for future
reference.

The
Cable System
CABLE PLANT—Fig. 39
Over 500,000 wells have been drilled in U.S.A. with this class of plant, averaging
in depth upwards of 1,200 feet.
This has been universally THE PLANT of past Boring operations both
on the Continent of Europe and America. It is a right out useful plant, and
its successes in America alone will not allow its construction for utility purposes
to take a second-rate position amongst the several plants allotted under special
conditions to produce special results.
Our long and varied experience in regard to conditions of country and
formations indicative of supply, has given us many opportunities of testing its
qualifications, and by adding improvements, we have proved the Cable System
admirable in its working, and it can be made applicable under our combination
system to all local requirements.
We have every confidence in recommending the cable rig to those re-
quiring plants for the purpose of obtaining Artesian supplies.

Artesian, Sub-Artesian or
Shallow Boring
By Hand, Horse or Steam Power
Pastoralists, Agriculturists, and others during the recent severe drought have
been at their wits’ end to obtain a supply of water for stock and domestic purposes,
while complete abandonment of properties after losing everything has been the
experience of many.
It has been the common practice in New South Wales to make excavations
and dams to conserve water which serve their purpose admirably when rain is
plentiful, but a drought soon exhausts their supplies.
We have done a very large portion of the Deep Well Sinking in Australia, and
we have always strongly advocated shallow boring, in favourable territory, for
pumping supplies.
A shallow Bore, lined with 6in. Casing, can be put down more expeditiously
and more economically than a deep well of ordinary dimensions, while the Bore
has several other advantages over a shaft, notably the shutting out of all deleterious
water, sand, etc., by means of the Steel Casing supplied by us; the failure of many
deep shafts put down at heavy cost being due entirely to the presence of salt or
other mineral matter in the shallower stratas.
Water can be pumped from any Bore with equal facility as from a shaft, by
using a>cylinder pump and direct acting power, either hand, horse, wind, oil engine,
or steam power.
When a Farmer or other requires only one Bore and does not care to incur
the expense of purchasing a small boring plant, he can frequently make arrange-
ments with another Farmer to do the Boring jointly, thereby reducing the cost to
both.
We are only too glad to afford interested people all the information in our
power, as we are manufacturers of all classes of Well Boring Machinery and
supplies. We have usually a number of expert drillers on our books, whose
services we can recommend should they be required.
The simpler forms of hand boring plants can usually be worked by any intelli-
gent man on the property.
While soliciting enquiries, which will receive our very best attention, we
would point out that it is important the fullest information should be furnished to
us respecting location of proposed bores, particulars of formation likely to be
encountered when boring, and probable depth of bore; all these details are neces-
sary to enable us to offer you a boring plant most suitable for the work.
We are now extending our business in the Contracting for these Shallow
Bores, and will be pleased to quote for same on application.

“Standard" Steam Boring Machines
IN THREE SIZES
Equipped for depths of 250, 500, and 1,000 ft. respectively
This plant (as per Figs. 44 and 45) IS BUILT IN AUSTRALIA and patented
by us to suit Australian conditions. In it we present the most scientific up-to-date
adaptation of Drilling Machinery to local requirements.
We have spent large sums in experimenting with different plants, and have
now, working on contracts, plants of six different designs, and from our experience
we recommend this plant as best adapted to Australian conditions. The following
are the special features: —
1. It can be worked with one man less than any other machine.
2. It is all Iron, except the Derrick, and will stand our severe climate better
than plants in the construction of which wood is used.
3. The action for raising and lowering the tools is better than any other of
which we know.
4. When the tools are run to the bottom of hole, no hitching on is required;
the plant is put into action simply by shifting the driving belt on to another
pulley.
5. When tools are to be withdrawn, the belt is shifted back to the original
pulley, bringing forward a lever. This is accomplished without any unhicthing,
and without stopping the engine.
The plant is of light weight. The 500 ft. rig weighs about 3 tons; the 1,000 ft.,
3J tons.
This plant is supplied mounted on 3 or 4 foot Iron Wheels, in such a manner
that it can be transported over rough bush roads without any trouble. Both
Winding Drums for raising tools, and Sand Pump are frictioned, no cog-gearing
being used. The Derrick is detachable.
A 4-h.p. nominal Steam Engine is sufficient to work this plant to a depth
of 1,000 feet.
WE SUPPLY COMPETENT DEILLEES TO WOEK ANY OF OUE
PLANTS WHEN REQUIRED.

HAND BORING
PLANT
THESE Plants are adapted to Shallow Bores only,
and, unless in special circumstances, we do not
recommend thorn for bores of over 250 feet in
depth. In clay, soft shale, sandrock, etc., they bore
cheaply and expeditiously; 50 feet per day being a not
unusual rate of progress. These plants are, however,
not suited to hard formations. We can supply
Sinker Bit and Sand Pump to negotiate shallow
patches of a hard nature, but do not recommend
Hand Power in any locality where more than 5% or
10% of hard formation is likely to be encountered.
Wo build these plants for any depth up to 400 feet.
They are very light and easily transported. A most
■economical feature of Hand Power is that it does
away with any necessity for providing fuel and
water, required in case of Steam Plant. In some
localities the supplying of fuel and water for
machinery is a very expensive item ; in such places
where the formation is favorable, a Hand Plant will
work just as efficiently, and wdth much greater
■economy. We recommend employing a horse to
withdraw the rods in all bores over 100 feet in depth.

Hand and Power Boring Plants
When enquiring for Prices and Particulars, clients will greatly assist us by giving as much
information as possible about the formation in which it is proposed to bore.
When these plants are used to obtain pumping supplies, we do not recommend less than a.
six-inch hole; but for prospecting purposes we build and equip them for any size hole desired.
We have sent out a great number of these Hand Power Machines, and they are giving the greatest
satisfaction wherever used, boring cheaply and expeditiously.
Unless specially ordered, we do not supply Timber for Derrick for Hand Plants. This can
usually be obtained in the locality much more cheaply than we could supply it from Sydney.
In quoting for Boring Plants, to enable us to determine what tools and plant are necessary,
we require the following information :
Location of Bore.
Depth of Bone and Size.
Number of Bores to be put down.

Steam Turbine Blower
These Blowers are strong and durable, no belts or pulleys required. It requires but a
small jet of steam or compressed air; may be placed in any position, and operated by simply
connecting to a boiler or compressor. Prices on application.
WATER WELLS.
What we have to say is condensed from our many years of wide practical experience in
the drilling, casing, and pumping of wells,' It will be found that our well drilling system
and the pumps we manufacture are adapted to do their work in the cheapest and most
economical way, and do it as it should be done.
THE ADVANTAGES OF THE DRILLED WELL.
The firifthed well never needs cleaning, because the water flows constantly through
the well.
Nothing but pure water from the choice water stratas below finds entrance into the
well. Undesirable surface waters or other seepage is cased off.
The well affords no room for stagnant waters. In dry and arid countries it is much
more reliable, because it does not depend on the wet weather seepage waters.
It can, be put down through any formation, and put down in one-tenth of the time
required to dig a well. ' '
Our steel-cased wells are permanent in their construction, and absolutely retain their
alignment, and thus greatly facilitate and insure the proper installation of our pumps.
There is no danger of man, child, or beast falling into the well. It may be put down in
indoor places where a dug well is out of the question.
The cased well excludes all rats, mice, worms or other vermin, while if is impossible to
keep them out of a dug well.
If the first water obtained is not found satisfactory, it is often found that by going
deeper in the same place a desirable quality can be reached. The same is true of quantity.
THE SIZE OF THE WELL.
The size of the permanent well should be properly determined from the results obtained
in sinking the test hole. The all-important work should be done by a competent and reliable
driller. We cannot too strongly advise a proposed customer to at once place this end of
his business in competent hands. The many poorly drilled, improperly cased and only
partially perforated wells by the old unreliable system of perforating when the casing is
deep down in the well and the generally unsatisfactory results to a customer whose well is
giving him only a limited part of the water that he should have, amply bear out our sugges-
tion in favor of a good driller.
Naturally the value of a good well is determined by the quantity of good quality water
the same will yield.

Contracting
Department
We have been in this
business in Australia for
over seventeen years, during
which period we have put
down 80 Deep Artesian
Bores, Aggregating 200,000
feet in total depth. In
addition we have put down
a large number of shallow
or Bub-Artesian Bores, as
well as test bores for mineral
purposes. In the whole
course of this work, we
have completed every hole
to contract depth, never lost
a bore, or left one in such a condition that it could not be continued to
a greater depth if desired. Several bores we have put down to 4,000 ft.,
the diamener of these, in most cases, being five or six inches. In one
instance, at Claremont (W.A.), we put down a bore of twelve inch
diameter, to 1,537 feet, and completed same with eight inch casing
to a depth of 1,943 feet.
We are prepared to give estimates for work by contract, or to
quote for machinery of any of the various plants herein illustrated,
and can supply expert labour to work same.
The method of watering large tracts of country, and the dis-
tribution of the water are problems of very great importance to the
pastoralist. We have experience and sound personal knowledge of
local conditions and requirements, and are always prepared to afford
enquirers the best possible information upon these subjects—FßEE.

Simple Method
Measuring Flow of Bore
r I 'HE weir, is made of a sheet of metal or wood, with the notch cut to an
exact right angle (90 degrees, or two sides of a square), and each side being
equally inclined to the horizon. This is set square across the water channel
so that the stream has a clean drop over the Y. The pool above the
gauge must be so wide that the approaching water is steady and has no perceptible
rush. If the water enters down a shoot from the Bore, its rush must be checked
by a pile of stones or other obstacles. The water in the tail race must be kept
well below the bottom of the V notch. The dimensions of the notch are imma-
terial, so long as it is large enough, or if one notch is insufficient, a row of them
may be used, and the several tabular volumes added together. Under the fore-
going conditions each rate of flow fills a certain width of the notch at A B on the
water level at the upper pool, which may be reliably measured to one-eighth of
an inch with a rule. The width is most easily taken with a pair of compasses
and afterwards read on the rule.
Blow in thousands of Imperial Gallons per 24 hours. Width of stream
over 90 degrees notch in inches ;

The Reasons why you should buy a
SAMSON
IT HAS
1 — More than four times the strength.
2 Perfect equalization of load on four
bearings instead of one.
3 Durability, as unequal strain being
eliminated, the life of the Mill is doubled.
4 Perfect alignment of pitman, a pump rod
with centre lift, obviating all overhanging
torsional strain.
5 Centre crank with both ends driven
instead of one, with no chance for wrist pin to
work loose.
6 Solid steel drop forged wrist pin, the only
Mill on the market thus equipped.
7 Perfect alignment of gears, which removes
FRICTION and increases the life of the gears
four fold.
8 — Detachable boxes, which can be instantly
removed and replaced with new ones, without
taking any part of the Mill off the Tower.
9 Milled surfaces, where the main castings
and gear shields are bolted together, which
makes a perfect joint without springing the
•
castings, which, would in turn create
FRICTION.
10 — Large oil boxes with automatic oilers,
which when once filled, lubricate the Mill for
from one to three months.
11 — Wheel Sails fitted with double clips, one
on either side the sail, insuring a perfect rigid
wheel and increasing the lasting qualities.
12— A machine constructed as carefully and
as scientifically as a steam engine, with planed
surfaces and perfectly fitting joints.
13 — Pitted with German machine coil short
link pull-out chain, the most durable and
easiest working chain on the market.
14— Long walking beam, connected to pit-
man in such manner as to give quick returi)
to the downward stroke of the pump rod, and
a direct straight line upward lift during the
working portion of the stroke.
THE
SAMSON MECHANISM
The principal features of the general construction of
the Samson are shown in the accompanying’
illustration.
Note the large double gear between which is securely
bolted the solid steel drop forged wrist pin which carries
the pitman ; the wrist pin holding gears so solid as to
make them practically one gear; the strong double
pinion, which is cast solid and bored out to fit the
shaft ; the extra long main shaft which penetrates deep
into the hub of the wheel and carries its long bearing
away beyond the point where the arms of the wheel
are attached, thus preventing all overhanging strain,
which creates friction.

THE
MAIN FRAME
The SAMSON, as its name implies, being a Mill of
great strength and power, requires a rigid foundation.
This we have in the main frame. (Shown above).
This frame on account of its peculiar construction,
is very rigid, it is perfectly braced and gives a solid
ground work for the working part of the Mill.
Oil Cups with Wick Feed
It is necessary to oil the majority of Wind Mills at
least twice a week. The SAMSON Wind Mill is
equipped with exception-
ally large oil boxes, which
are in turn fitted with
wire wick feed, which
automatically feeds the
nocessaft' amount of oil
to properly lubricate the
Mill. These boxes when
once filled, are capable of
furnishing the proper
amount of oil necessary
for from one to three
months. The boxes in
turn are fitted with metal caps, which exclude dust
and moisture.
THE GOVERNOR
One of the most important elements of a Wind
Mill is the Governor. It is the function of the
Governor to regulate the speed of the wheel in high
winds, to prevent injury to the pump cylinder, besides
to prevent injury to the Tower and to the Mill. It
consists of a steel coiled spring, one end of which
engages with the vane head and the other with the
Mill head.
Give the
SAMSON
a Trial
It will do the rest
DETACHABLE
BOXES
The babbitted bearings on the
gear and main shafts are In-
stantly interchangeable,
without removing the Mill from
the 3 Tower. These boxes' are
first babbitted, after which they
are held in an automatic machine
by the babbitted portion while
shaft revolves, and are
turned perfectly true. to this
surface, so as to fit in the bored
portion of the main frame.-
This insures perfect
alignment of the shafts, and
enables the owner of a
SAMSON MILL to replace
any box with a new one, with-
out disturbing the alignment
of bearings a fraction of an
inch.
“ The remembrance of
Quality remains long after
the Price is forgotten."

No. 2 Stover Wind Mill, Regulator for 12, 14, and 16 ft. Mills, weight 70 lbs.
Stover Wind Mill Regulator
AUTOMATIC RATCHET
The Stover Regulator is a simple device for use in connection with a wind mill to
automatically regulate or control the supply of water in the tank. When the tank is filled with
water it pulls the mill out of gear and stops the pump, thus preventing an overflow, a mud
hole, waste of water and unnecessary wear to both mill and pump. When a few inches of
water has been taken from the tank if throws the mill in gear, and allows it to run just long
enough to refill the tank and no more. The tank is thus kept full of water, affording abundant
supply for stock, and preserves the tank against shrinkage from becoming empty. The man
or boy may forget to put the mill in gear in time, allowing the stock to suffer and the tank to
go dry, or to throw it out when tank is full, thus wasting water, creating a mud hole,
unnecessary water, &o. The Stover Regulator never fails. No windmill is complete
without it and no other equals the Stover.

For Watering Stock
WE offer this Troughing as an improvement on that generally in use.
Strength, rigidity, and durability, combined with lightness, render this a
most desirable troughing for watering stock. It stands rigid on strong
steel legs forged to shape of trough, over which the weight of the water is
evenly distributed. The edges of the trough are braced with angle steel bars.
Sections are made of curved sheets, and measure 20in. wide by 10in. deep,
holding about 6 gallons of water per foot. The height of trough is 14 inches.
We also make a larger Trough for Watering Cattle, and will be pleased to send

TESTIMONIALS
Only a Few of the Many Received
“Methven,” Bowenfels,
Dear Sirs, — 6th January, 1908.
The 12ft. “Samson” Windmill you sent me last October is giving great satisfaction.
The depth from which it is pumping is 120 feet from the surface, and the tanks are 12 feet
above that. As the wind is never steady for any length of time, I cannot say how many
gallons of water it pumps. I have not any fault to find with it. I omitted to say that this
Mill is erected on my Tondeburine station, near Coonamble. Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) J. L. BROWN.
“Gillendoon,” Warren,
Dear Sirs, —■ 2nd January, 1908.
Replying to your letter re “Samson” Windmills, I have much pleasure in stating that
the 12ft. Windmill is doing EXCELLENT work, and giving every satisfaction. It is pump-
ing from a well 60 feet deep, and lifts the water 30 feet above the surface. I cannot recom.
mend any improvement to your Mill. Yours faithfully,

:: The following speak for themselves
“Idaville,” Merriwa,
Dear Sirs, — 20th Oct., 1909.
The “Samson” Windmill we obtained from you last year has given complete satisfac-
tion. It requires very little attention, and the main parts are all very strong. We ate
sending an order by this mail for another “Samson,” the same size and specification as the
last one. Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) SHANNON BROS.
Tyrie Station, Dandaloo,
Dears Sirs, — 10th duty, 1909.
With regard to the 16ft. “Samson” Windmill Outfit supplied by you two years ago,
I have to say that it has worked BEAUTIFULLY, and has never required any attention
beyond oiling. I hope to send for a small “Samson” shortly, as lam satisfied that they
are the BEST mills out here, as the risk of breakage is so small. Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) R STEWART.
Extract from report received on the Pilliga Government Bore: —
Reports upon the work of the 16ft. “Samson” Windmill erected over the Government
Bore at Pilliga Scrub are very satisfactory. This Mill is doing splendid work, lifting water
from a depth of 190 feet, and keeping a 8000-gallon tank continually full. No record has
sc far been made of the exact volume of water pumped per day—possibly the Mill has not
been required, so far, to work to its full capacity, but it easily keeps the supply up to
requirements.
“Band®,” Gunnedah,
Dear Sirs, — 25th Dec., 1908.
With regard to the “Samson” Windmills, we have three here. One of them (a 12ft.
mill) is erected over a well 60 feet deep, and we use a 4in. cylinder pump. Another 12ft.
Mill is on an 80ft. well; and the third, an Bft. Mill, is on a 60ft. well, working with a Sin.
cylinder. All these Mills do EXCELLENT work. I have no fault to find with them, and
consider thenwequal, if not superior, to any on the market. Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) R. M. COBB.
Killarney, Narrabri,
Dear Sirs,— 17th Feb., 1906.
There are six “Samson” Windmills here. They give every satisfaction, and are the
BEST we have working. Their double action gives them the facility of working without
straining, and does away with uneven wearing. They are really good in whirlwinds, shut-
ting up at once with barely a move, where others generally roll and cause breakages. They
work well with light winds, and give no trouble or bother. We consider them the best we
have had anything to do with. Yours truly,
(Sgd.) W. P. BUCHANAN.
Box Hill, Werris Creek,
Dear Sirs,— 30th Dec., 1907.
R© “Samson ’ Windmills. The 14ft. Mill I got from you is pumping from a well at
a depth of 188 feet with a 3in. pump, and forces the water to a height of 15 feet above the
surface. The Mill is giving, say, from 1000 to 1200 gallons per day, and never gives the
slightest trouble. The 12ft. Mill which you supplied is pumping from a 100 ft. well, with
a 4m. pump, and yields double the quantity of water. I believe the “Samson” to be the
BEST Mill on the market. Yours faithfully,

BRITANNIA
Safety Automatic
OIL ENGINE
(NICHOLSON’S PATENTS)
The simplest and most perfect Engine of the day. Suitable for any purpose for which power is required
SIMPLE, SAFE, SILENT, ECONOMICAL, POWERFUL. OCCUPIES LITTLE SPACE, CAN BE GOT READY TO
j START IN A FEW MINUTES, WILL RUN FOR HOURS WITHOUT ATTENTION, CONSUMES
j NOTHING BUT ORDINARY PETROLEUM OIL AND A LITTLE WATER.
| This Engine, which is the result of many years’ experience, has been designed to meet the
great demand that exists for a CHEAP FORM OF MOTIVE POWER, being at the same time
absolutely RELIABLE in its action. It is adapted for driving any of the innumerable machines
now employed in almost every industry, such as machine tools, pumps, threshing machines, fans,
dynamos, dairy plants, sawmills, farm and estate work, &c., &c. The great advantage of this
over any type of Engine is that it is entirely self-contained; that is to say, that you can have
power at any time within a few minutes’ notice, as long as you have a supply of petroleum in
the tank.
After once being started, it requires ho further attention, and is so automatic in action that
many engines are allowed to run throughout the day, and in some cases throughout the whole
night, without any attendant.
Our latest type engine will use any kind of CRUDE or refined oil without alteration, and
will run for weeks on crude oil without any cleaning, and we believe we are right in stating that
this is a result not achieved by any other maker.

John Deere Universal Steel Lever
Harrow
WITH SPRING TRIP
STRONG. FLEXIBLE
DURABLE
John Deere Universal Steel Lever Harrow.. Teeth Perpendicular for Pulverizing.
IN the Deere Universal Steel Lever Harrow we offer a tool which is entitled to great favor.
THE TOOTH BARS are made of U-bar steel, which insures strength without useless weight. At
the same time, the sections are heavy enough to give the teeth the proper amount of penetration in
any condition of soil.
THE TEETH are fastened to the bars by our patent tooth fastener, which holds the tooth firmly
in position, and yet, by slightly loosening the nut, permits the tooth to be removed readily for
replying with new one or to turn the tooth to present a new corner to the work when it becomes
worn.
HINGE CASTINGS are attached firmly to each end of the tooth bars, and are riveted on the
outside of the side bars. The tooth bars turn freely, and can be easily adjusted so the teeth will
work at any desired angle. Side bars are made I-bar steel, bent in shape to give the tooth bars
the proper set to secure even spacing of the teeth.
THE SIDE BARS are interchangeable, as are also the tooth bars. The side bars also form a
guard which prevents the tooth bars from catching on shrubbery and trees when using the harrow
In orchard or vineyard work.
THE SHORT LEVERS attached to each tooth bar are fastened by means of a clip, which admits
•of a perfect alignment of these levers, and avoids weakening the tooth bars by a bolt hole at the
point of greatest strain.
RATCHETS.—The ratchets are of the saw-tooth construction, enabling the operator, by a slight
•down pressure on the lever, to instantly change the angle of the teeth to any degree desired.
THE LEVER is of convenient length, placed within asy reach, and is provided with a spring trip,
which preserve the teeth when using the harrow in stony or rooty ground. When the tooth strikes
an obstruction, this trip allows the tooth bars to turn so that the tooth passes over the obstruc-
tion without being bent, whep the spring immediately brings the bars back into position.
A CIRCLE BRACE is provided on the front of the section, which adds strength to the construc-
tion, as well as acting as a guard against accident to the teeth.
RUNNER TEETH are provided for each corner of the sections, so that when the harrow is thrown
down flat for transporting from place to place, it rests upon the runners, preserving the teeth from
■wear, and largely preventing the accumulation of trash under the harrow.

The “Panama Senior” Grader.
(Patent applied for)
NOTE THE DEGREE OF TILT FOR DEER, NARROW DITCHES
The “ Panama Senior” Grader, the modern road machine, has been proved the most complete and Prac-
tical Road Builder ever offered to the road-building men of this country. Designed after entirely new ideas,
the result of long study and actual tests. Built to meet the requirements of a machine for general work, such
as opening up ditches, grading, leveling, irrigating, etc. Will do more in this respect, with the least expense
and power, than any other machine ever introduced. For irrigating work it stands in a class alone. Can be
worked with one team, but built plenty strong to stand work requiring four horses. Examine carefully the
cuts of this machine and you will readily see both the mechanical and operating advantages. The new
feature of raising, lowering and tilting the entire frame with the blade, is in itself very important, as it does
away with all weak parts between the frame and blade, allows a better clearance, keeps the weight and
strength where you need it and allows for tilting to an extreme degree. This machine is also constructed so
as to make the work easy for both man and team.
THE
“PANAMA
JUNIOR.”
(Patent Applied for)
REVERSIBLE GRADER AND LEVELER
Description of the “Panama Junior” Grader and Lcvcler
Positively the Best Machine on the Market for the Money
We call your attention particularly to this wonderful machine. Designed to meet all requirementsTof
light grading and leveling, and can quite often be used in place of the heavy graders. Notice how simply the
machine is constructed, and yet how complete in every detail. Look at the reversible feature. Operator
does not need to leave his seat, but simply by the use of the foot lever, unlocks the reverse and drives the
team around to any desired angle. The same operation also reverses the rear'wheels and the levers.
The ante shifting device attached can be so adjusted as to help keep the machine .to the ; work. .Horses
will not be abused, as the machine is made tongueless. Has a direct down draft, and can be turned around,
in its own space. 1 ' 1 : ....

John Deere
Combination
Fourteen-Tooth
Steel Cultivator
and Harrow.
ccrc Fourtccn-Tooth Steel Combination Cultivator and Harrow shown above
is adapted for close work among very small plants. It stirs the soil thoroughly, buu does not throw any
on the plants.
However it is more than a cultivator, it is an excellent smoothing harrow also. The steel teeth are
reversible, each one having a small cultivator tooth forged on one end, the other end being straight
and sharp. >
8,8 a smoothing arrow, this implement will work over very small corn or potato plants
without injuring them. It is often used to break up the baked surface of a planted field so the plants can
come up easier and grow better. For exceptionally close work every other tooth maybe removed.
The Combination Cultivator and Harrow is regularly equipped with expanding lever and can be
tourmshed with or without gauge wheel. Like the other cultivators shown, it is all steel.
Syracuse Drag Scrapers
These Scrapers, like the Barrow Trays, are shaped cold from a single sheet of steel, lapped and
riveted at the corners. They are. uniform in thickness throughout, at corners, where they are
of double thickness.
Special steel is used in the bails, which are hung so' that the Scrapers handle easily. Heavy runners, or

Syracuse Steel Wheel Scraper
CARRYING POSITION
No. 1 size is intended for township or farm work, where the teams are light and the
haul short.
No. 2 is us«d mostly in general contract and railroad work, as it can be handled
entirely with one team of horses.
No. 3 is designed for heavy work on long hauls, and requires a snatch team to fill
the tray. Handles material most economically when worked in gangs of ten to
fifteen scrapers. Draft rod for snatch team furnished with No. 3 size. Whiffle-
trees and neck yoke are extra.
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES.
GREAT LEVERAGE—The Syracuse Scraper, excels all others in the ease with
which the load is raised. The manner of construction is such that the horses
render considerable assistance, and the greatest amount of leverage is when
breaking out of the ground.
SIMPLICITY —Great care has been taken to make this Scraper do the work
required in a satisfactory manner with as little machinery as possible. It is less
complicated, and has a fewer number of parts than any other Scraper on the
market.
LARGE CARRYING CAPACITY—The tray is higher from the ground in front
than at the rear, so as to carry a full load to the dumping place. All possibility
of the Scraper dumping before required has been removed.
THE SYRACUSE WILL NOT DUMP IN TAKING LOAD.

Handy Rules for Everybody’s Use
THE NECESSARY PARTS OF A PUMP are; the Cylinder, the Plunger and its Valve, the
Check or Lower Valve, the Suction Pipe, and the Pump-rod or Piston-rod. The satisfactory
operation of the Pump depends on the perfection of its parts. As a perfect Vacuum cannot be
obtained, 25 feet is practically as high as water can be drawn vertically by Suction, and we
even recommend Well Pump Cylinders or Working Barrels to be submerged wherever practicable.
In any case the nearer the Pump’s working parts are to the water level the better.
CAPACITY. —To compute the capacity of any Single-acting Pump, apply the following
Rule :—Square the diameter (in inches) of the Cylinder, multiply this by .7854, and the
result (which is the area of the circle of Cylinder) by the length of stroke in inches. This
gives the capacity in cubic inches per stroke (or revolution). Multiply this by the number
of strokes per minute, and divide the product by 231 (the number of cubic inches in a gallon
of waterl, and the result will be the capacity or amount of water the Pump will discharge
per minute.
POWER. —To compute the Power required to raise a given amount of water per minute to a
certain height, apply the following
Rule :—Multiply the number of gallons the Pump discharges per minute by 8.338 (the
weight in pounds of one gallon of water), and the product by tue total number of feet the
water is to be elevated above the supply. The result is the Power Required, in foot-pounds;
divide this by 33,000 (the number of foot-pounds of one horse-power), and you have the
Theoretical Horse-power necessary to do the work. About 25 per cent, must be added to
this to compensate for friction, slip of valves, etc. The per cent, efficiency of a Pump is
the per cent, the actual capacity is of its theoretical capacity working under given conditions.
SPEED. —To compute the number of Strokes per minute necessary to discharge a given quantity
of water (the diameter of Cylinder and the length of stroke being known), apply the following
Rule : —Divide the amount of water to be discharged (in gallons) per minute by the
capacity (in gallons) per stroke (see table—or rule for capacity above), and you have the
number of strokes per minute necessary to do the work. It may be well to note that the
piston of a Power Pump should travel a speed not greater than 100 feet per minute.
SPEED OF PULLEYS. —In calculating either the Speed or Capacity of a Power Pump operated
by Pulleys, the diameter and speed of either the Driving or the Driven Pulley must be known;
andteither the diameter or the speed of the other Pulley must be known, when the required
diameter, or the required speed (as the case may be), can readily be determined by the follow-
ing Rules: (By speed is meant revolutions per minute.)
Required the Diameter of the Driving Pulley, the other three factors being known:
Rule :—Multiply the diameter of the Driven Pulley by its revolutions, and divide the product
by the revolutions of the Driving Pulley.
Required the Diameter of the Driven Pulley, the other three factors being known:
Rule :—Multiply the diameter of the Driving Pulley by its revolutions, and divide the product
by the revolutions of the Driven Pulley.
Required the Speed of the Driving Pulley, the other three factors being known:
Rule :—Multiply the diameter of the Driven Pulley by its revolutions, and divide by the
diameter of the Driving Pulley.
Required the Speed of the Driven Pulley, the other three factors being known:
Rule :—Multinly the diameter of the Driving Pulley by its revolutions, and divide by the
diameter of the Driven Pulley.
IN ANY CASE, the diameter of the Driving Pulley multiplied by its revolutions, equals the
diameter of the Driven Pulley multiplied by its revolutions ; and thus any three of the quantities
being known, the other may readily be determined. In other words: using Proportion, or the
“RULE OF THREE.” The speed of the Driving Pulley is to the diameter of the Driven Pulley
as the speed of the Driven Pulley is to the diameter of the Driving Pulley.
N.B.—SPEED OF GEARING is estimated in same way, substituting the number of gear
teeth for “diameter.”

Facts Figures and Formulas
The areas of circles are to each other as the squares of their respective diameters. In other
words, doubling the Diameter of a Pipe or Cylinder increases its capacity (area of circle) four
times.
Atmospheric pressure (at sea level) is exerted in every direction to the extent of 14.7 pounds
to the square inch. This pressure will maintain a column of water 33.9 feet high, i.e., when the
normal pressure in the column (the pipe or tubing) is relieved by the creation of a vacuum. The
above is therefore the theoretical vertical distance that water may be drawn by suction. The suc-
tion capacity of a Pump decreases as the altitude (distance above sea level) increases. In prac-
tice, 25 feet is about the maximum suction (vertical) distance recommended for pumping.
Every foot of height in a column of water represents .434 pounds pressure to the square inch ;
in common practice, however, it is estimated that every foot in height represents one-half pound
pressure to the square inch.
A cubic foot of water weighs 62.36 lbs.
An XJ.S.A. gallon weighs 8.33 lbs.
An Imperial gallon of water weighs 10 lbs.
A gallon of water contains 231 cubic inches.
A cubic foot of water contains 1728 cubic inches.
A cubic foot of water contains 7.48 gallons.
