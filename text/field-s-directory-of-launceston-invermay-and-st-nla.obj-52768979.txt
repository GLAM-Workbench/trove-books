MERCANTILE ASSOCIATION
FOE
PROTECTION OF TRADE,
PATTERSON-STREET, LAUNCESTON.
This Association was commenced in Launceston some time, hack, and has
met with a liberal amount of support. It is subscribed to by nearly all the
leading mercantile houses in Tasmania, and is formed upon the basis of similar
institutions which have boon working for years in London, New York, and other
cities. Similar Associations exist in Adelaide, Brisbane. Melbourne, and Syd-
ney, with all of which this Association is in correspondence.
A Weekly Circular, or Trade Report, is supplied to every subscriber, on
the understanding that its contents are to be considered strictly private and
confidential. This gives a list of all Bills of Sale registered week by week in
Tasmania, Satisfactions of Bills of Sale, Supreme Court Judgments, Satisfactions
of Judgments, Bankruptcy Notices, the Judgments in the Hobart and Laun-
ceston Courts of Bequests, Confessions (i.e-, Judgments privately entered up),
and other valuable information. To those in business and giving credit this
information is invaluable, as no business man can afford to be in ignorance of
the, acts of his customers which may at any time prevent recovery of money
due.
The collection of amounts due to subscribers receives special attention, and
subscribers who may have debts owing to them in the adjoining Colonies can,
upon application to the Manager of this Association, have the amounts applied
for by the Trade Protection Society of either colony, and, being in correspond-
ence with these Associations, every subscriber can, if desired, see the Weekly
Trade Circular issued by them.
Private and confidential information as to the credit-worthiness of any indi-
vidual or firm will be supplied to subscribers.
In bankruptcy and insolvency cases subscribers arc invited to send in their
proxies to the Manager, stating the course of action they would wish to be pur-
sued, as more can be done by united action than by single-handed effort.
The subscription to the Association is One Guinea per annum if paid in
advance, or 7s. 6d. per quarter, with an extra charge of 4s. 4d. per annum
where the Circular is sent through the post.
Terms for the Collection of Debts: —s per cent, on debts of £2 and up-
wards ;10 per cent, on debts under £2, and expenses of postage. On amounts
collected out of the colony, 10 per cent.
Communications and subscriptions may be sent to
Mr. S. FIELD, Patterson-street, Launceston ;
or to

beth-street, Hobart.

ALPHABETICAL DIRECTORY
OF
LAUNCESTON.
That the Streets of Launceston have not yet been numbered is much to
be regretted. The want may, however, he in some measure repaired by con-
sulting this Directory. First ascertain the address of the individual sought
after in this portion of the Directory ; then turn to the Street Directory, in
which the Names of Residents appear in their consecutive order in each Street;
after finding the Name required, the position in the Street may be determined
by its contiguity to some other resident.
The letters p. r. after a name mark the private residence.
The Names of all Advertisers appear in Capital Letters, for which see
Index to Advertisements.

AND
BATHING ESTABLISHMENT.
The Poetry of Science, and Music of Motion!
i. Earthquakes and Submarine Explosions, and the earth made to record her own
vibrations. Also, a working model of the earth revolving on its axis once every twenty-four
hours, showing every country, land, and sea upon its surface, as well as exadf time, and the
mystery of attraction and repulsion. Also a working model of the celestial sphere, or
artificial representation of the heavens, and the apparent diurnal motion of the sun, moon,
and stars, with a planisphere of the southern sky.
3. Conic Sections mathematically exadl without instruments. Or apparatus for
drawing straight lines and circles, ovals, and ellipses, or curves within curves, double cones,
and oblong squares. It will square the circle, a double cone or triangle, and build a solid
pyramid, round, oblong, or square, of greater beauty and symmetry of form than those of
Egypt, In doing so the apparatus travels over a space of 40,000 feet; in watching the
afction of which it will be seen moving in every possible way in one. continuous line, ks
though endowed withTife. It also unfolds some of the great and grand laws of the universe,
showing how worlds revolve in their orbits, .and how they cross each other’s paths in space
without coming into collision, leaving a permanent and beautiful tracing of their elliptical
orbits or paths, and showing the attracting agency combined with the projecting force.
These exquisitely beautiful geometrical illustrations of the motions of the heavenly bodies,
including the visible and material motion of the earth on its axis, are made on a scale of
six feet, as well as in miniature.
3. Perpetual Motion discovered at last, without the aid of machinery or any main-
taining power. It is a thing of beauty, adapted for the palace or the cottage, being far
infinitely superior to-anything ever made by human fingers.
4. Perpetual Motion by the light of the sun, commencing at the exadl time of sun-
rise, and stopping at the exaCt time of sunset, indicating true solar time, without a glimpse
of its solar motor. It has no sympathy or affedlion for any other source of light or heat.
Surrounding it with any number of candles, gas lamps, or a blazing fire will have no effedl
on it, nor will the solar spedlrum with its visible and invisible rays. Not even the eledlric
light will move it, nor 60 of them concentrated, as proved at Mr. Kerr’s establishment.
Such is the majesty and materiality of solar light, the instant it is exposed to the mysterious
influence of pure sunshine, its behaviour is marvellous; it is animated as with the breath of
Deity. The condensed light of a full moon reverses the motion, driving it backwards, show-
ing its celestial parentage. Here then is another of nature’s mysteries—a complete pidlure
of life in matter. Except to the thoughtless, who have no curiosity, who pass through the
world without knowing why they came into it, it is a charming sight, highly interesting, and
singularly beautiful,
5. Natural Photography, in beautiful and permanent colours, taken in the dark as
well as in the light, or growing artificial flowers, in a fluid state; and I anticipate the day when
the same thing m the form of animals and human beings in a gaseous state will be exhibited. It
is a modification of Darwin’s theory, showing that there is something else existing in both plants
and animals besides life, and something of greater beauty than matter ; something we can-
not grasp, some invisible controlling power which all the resources of the laboratory cannot
detedt, nor all the powers,of the microscope reveal. It appears to be a new state or con-
dition of matter manifesting intelligence. All the other processes of photographic develop-
ment depend on the adtion of light; this goes on in absolute darkness, a thing of beauty,
surpassing all the processes hitherto known in the art of photography. The life-like pro-
cess of development must be witnessed to be believed.
6. Crystalisation with polarised light, or delightful lessons and magnificent views of
contrivance , perfection , and wisdom displayed in structure s or the building powers and
properties of matter, which are exquisitely beautiful, like palaces of ivory or pearl, with
pillars of silver and capitals of gold—a charming sight—evidence of things unseen.


7. The Harmonograph, or mechanical illustration of the harmony and gradation of
motion, strikingly illustrated by the mysterious force of gravitation, and showing the mathe-
matical precision with which the mightiest power in the universe adls.
8. *An Animal with a Thousand Heads, but no eyes, ears, legs, or feet, that
is never seen to eat, rest or sleep. Anyone who can count them and capture one receives a
new hat. •
9. The Endless Railway, the Bay of Venice, and the miniature Regatta on water
teeming with gold and silver fish, are interesting sights. Looked at through the proprietor's
spectacles, a self-moving diorama or panorama of boats and ships, railways and carriages, is
seen. Anyone who can count them receives a gold watch.
10. A new form of railway in miniature, with a double cone locomotive, which starts
itself, and runs uphill, but won't run down again : laughs at the attraction of gravitation.
11. The Philosophy of a Soap Bubble. Blowing soap bubbles as big as a child's
head, in coloured sunshine, is not only a thing of beauty, but a lung tester, and chest ex-
pander, and therefore a profitable recreation. He who blows the biggest and keeps it afloat
the longest gets a new hat.
12. The Electric Locomotive, with a revolving light, carries its own fuel, and drags
a locomotive, tender, and a train of loaded carriages up an incline, or runs down the incline
and pushes them up behind.
13. The Electric Light in miniature, aerial drum and bell, and the iron man.
14. The Revolving Diorama of the overland route to Europe on 1700 feet of canvas.
15. A New Form of Steam Engine without any visible machinery, which requires
no engineer, no lubrication, and very little fuel. An explosion is an impossibility. It starts
itself, gives the alarm, calls the cook, starts the machinery, and cooks the dinner. The
motive power is derived from a new application of the force of gravitation. The like has
never been witnessed since the days when Newton discovered the law of gravitation by
means of an apple. Four steam engines driven from one boiler without any fuel. Ten new
steam boilers for sale—one 15 feet long, and 5 feet in diameter.
16. The Solar System. —Transit of Venus, ebb and flow of the tides, and the comets,
how they go round, graze, and sometimes fall into the sun.
17. A Collision of two full-grown comets, with trains one million miles long, bringing
the solar system to a standstill.
18. The Microscope, or miracle of Omnipotence, revealing miniature worlds of wonder
and beauty, which delight the eye and expand the mind.
19. The Micro-Spectroscope and solar spectrum, twenty-one feet long.
20. The Revolving Stereoscope with one hundred views of magnificent and
exquisite scenery, which is to the eye what music is to the ear; a pleasure to the mind.
' 21. Sensitive Flame, talks, dances, and sings.
22. The Waterspout, Whirlwind, Sandstorm, and Snowstorm.
23. The New Water Motor drives half a dozen sewing machines, awater wheel, meat
chopper, grindstone, and lathe, cleans the knives, grinds the coffee, churns the butter,
turns the spit, blows the fire, plays the organ, and rocks the cradle, showing how water and
air, the most useful and most abundant of the necessaries of life, may also become the
motive powers of the future.
24. Water used three times over as a motive power, and then used for domestic pur-
poses, baths, etc.
25. Transparent Summer-house or Tent, of great beauty and symmetry of form, fit
for a fairy, in the shape of a bell parasol or umbrella; of any size or colour. Can be erected
in a minute, must be seen to be appreciated.
26. Profusion and Variety of Animal Life, or worlds of unseen objedfs, beautiful in
their rriinuteness, as seen in a drop of water under the microscope.
27. Beautiful > Illustrations of the unseen vertical circulation of the water in the
ocean, and how ships and all other bodies, except metals, lost at sea, never reach the
bottom of deep water, but are for ever moving about with the currents at different depths,
according to their specific gravities.
28. A Ship in a gale of wind and heavy sea.
29. Sinking and Raising the “ City of Launceston '* and ship “ Captain.”
30. A Ship held in suspension half way up, while the diver effefts the repairs. Raising
ships by magnetism, and holding them in suspension at any depth for repairs.
31. The Glass Diving Bell, with diver inside bringing up gold.
32. The New Hydraulic Propeller drives boats on the water, or tows loaded
vessels with their sails set, by jet, screw, or paddle.
33. The New Printing Telegraph writes in ink, rings the bell, and delivers the
message.
34. Aquariums with gold and silver fish, revolving fountains, aviaries, and ferneries,
35. A Real Crocodile and Swordfish, 14 feet long.


36. Artificial Rainbows, solar and lunar, double and single; presenting one of the
most magnificent of nature’s pictures; when the moon is in full dress paying her respedts to
Jupiter, no painting is equal to the beauty of this part of the scene.
37. A Self-Acting Miniature Geyser, or intermittent fountain of boiling water,
steam, and air.
38. A Double Action One in glass, for the table.
39. The Camera, with 1000 views of photographic pidlures, buildings, and scenery, in

on the person, direct from the sky, it is both soothing and animating. See the Work,
price 40s. Hire per week, 6d. Also a portable one for letting out, adapted for the garden,
verandah, or room.
50. The Two Swimming Baths, except in size, are not surpassed in this hemisphere.
By means of a half-inch cone the water is converted into a miniature sea with waves 15 to
18 inches high, for learning to swim under difficulties, or when capsized in rough water.
The jet of water is ever changing in height and in form, producing effects never before
witnessed in hydrodynamics. Any boy who can swim against one of these jets, with a suit
of clothes on, shall receive 55., a girl 10s. Boys’ bath, 2d.; adults’, 4d, On Sunday
mornings, 6d. Hot baths, is. ; Turkish and steam, 55.; the sunbath, 2s. 6d. per half-hour.
51. The Library contains 6000 volumes and most of the exhibits, which will occupy a
day. To witness all that is to be seen will occupy a week. Charge—Per half-hour, is
each; ditto, 2s. for a single person.
52. Action at a distance without contact, through glass or opaque bodies, or through a
vacuum. As Professor Stephens and others can act on living matter by laying on of hands,
so I can act on dead inorganic matter and produce motion without touching. What the
force or power is, like them, I cannot say.
53. The Vital Force: The Greatest and the Grandest Invention of Omnipotence.
What is it ? Learned men, so-called, who are not honest enough to tell us they don’t know,
tell us “it is a mode of motion, or a force manifested in matter, having a very complicated
arrangement of invisible molecules”—a definition that conceals ignorance and displays
learning, but affords no information. Another tells us “that life originated on this earth
from moss-grown fragments from the ruins of another world,” which is like the descent of
man from monkeys, which many believe in but which the future will laugh at, and yet I
think I can show experimentally that matter is alive, and that the wet sand of my garden
buds and blossoms with life all the year round, bringing forth animals that can crawl, swim,
fly, walk, and stand erect like the human animal, or like that wonderfully-cunning animal,
the talking serpent that stood on its tail and delivered a discourse to Eve on the nature and
qualities of an apple. Here, then, is something really new—something possessing true
scientific interest, ingenious applications of different sciences—something enchanting,
instructive, curious, and beautiful in science, nature, and art —something infinitely superior
to the jingle and glitter of thousands; and although I am only an amateur in scientific
researches (a mere paper philosopher, as the critic says, who has not yet arrived at the
knowledge of his own ignorance), yet here is something that neither philosophy nor theology
can explain or refute, something that puzzles the wisest.
Learn the cause of things, the why and wherefore of Creation. How this world and her
sisters are tied by an invisible chain to the Sun, and the Sun to other Suns, or systems of
Suns. How they are suspended and guided in their orbits while rolling and revolving
eternally in what some call empty space, but which may teem with grand and ever-living
things of beauty invisible to human eyes.
