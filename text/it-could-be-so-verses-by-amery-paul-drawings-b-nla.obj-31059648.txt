HIDE AND SEEK
When little Boy Blue
Went blowing his horn
All thru’ the meadow
And all thru’ the corn
I know what they did -
Those sheep - they all hid!
But little Boy Blue,
What else could he do
But keep on blowing
And blowing his horn
All thru’ the meadow
And all thru’ the corn


, I
TEMPT A TION
That old knave of hearts who stole those tarts
Was probably fond of pastry
And probably stole in fits and starts
Some other things just as tasty!


DOUBT
I just can’t see how an egg could sit
High up on top of a wall ....
That’s why I laugh when I hear the tale
Of old Humpty Dumpty’s fall!


SYMPA THY
If Rapunzel did let down her hair
To make of it a golden stair,
I’ve never heard how afterwards,
She got the knots out that were there!


WORDS WITHOUT MUSIC
Little Tommy Tucker sang for his supper
Or, so I am told! If it’s true ....
Poor Tommy Tucker! Singing for my supper
Is something that I wouldn’t do!


NO PL UM A T ALL
When little Jack Homer
Sat in his corner,
Oh! Me!” he said
And, “Oh! My!”
And, “Why must I here?”
He said, “Tell me that!
And why must I
Eat this p


LOGIC
Don’t you think its quite right
To save getting a fright
To always look under your chair?
For you never can see
Where a spider might be
And one could be just sitting
So, to look - just in fun -
Is by far better done
Than to scream and run away
As that girl Muffet did
When that big spider hid
Till she’d started her curds and whey


PUSSY CA T! PUSSY CA T!
Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, if you have been
Off to London only to see the Queen
Then tell me now, Pussy Cat, tell me where
The feather came from that is showing there
On the side of your nose? It seems to me
On your way to London you climbed a tree
And a bird, I think, you have eaten, too!
Can you tell me, Pussy Cat, thafs not true?


R EASON ING
I’ve never thought much of that
old-fashioned rhyme,
All about a cupboard so bare
And as for the dog, had it gone on the street,
It could quite soon have found a bone
that was sweet
And that’s just what I think, so there!


TEARS FOR TWO
Pollyanna, so I’m told,
Would never cry at all.
But Pollyanna, I must say
When she was very small,
Once or twice was surely sent
To bed ■ without her tea.
Then Pollyanna cried, I’m sure
She did! As hard as me!


NATURE STUDY
I can’t tell the diffrence
In a wasp and a bee
I only hope neither
Will ever sting me!


TR UANT
Henry is my lizard’s name,
For a lizard he’s quite tame.
He goes where I go and, then,
Goes back home with me again!
Henry is my lizard’s name,
If you find him, he’s quite tame!
I say that because one day
By himself he went away
I’ve not seen him since and you
Think - I’m sure - just what I do!


SIGHT- SEEING
I saw an elephant at the zoo
“Ho! Ho!” he said “And who are you?
I told him then, “Why, Im a boy!
“Ho! Ho!” he said “Ho! Ho! Ahoy!
Then, to that elephant at the zoo
I said, “Well now, and who are you?
“I’m an elephant! Can’t you see?”
Thats what he turned and said to me!


CONVERSATION
This may sound strange but today I saw
At the zoo - some penguins - three or four
And just to myself - my word - said I
Now what would they taste like in a pie?
But, penguin pie - when I’d thought a bit -
Made me say I’d think no more of it
And those penguins said they knew they’d be
Better as penguins than pie for me!


CHANGEABLE
Tho’ “Nebuchadnezzar”, I call my horse
Neddy”, he gets-for short of course!
But well he may - soon - now, get Ned
Or “Nebuchadnezzar”, again, instead!

JUSTICE
"In that tree
I said
“There’s a bird’s nest there
I’ll find it
And throw
It high in the air!’’
“Look at you! Look at you
What you’ve done!”
Said the little birds
Falling out one by one!


I said
I’m high in the air
And I wish
Instead
I had stayed d there!”
Look at him! Look at him!
Ho! Ho! Hum!”
Said the little birds
All of them! “Down he's come!”

MENAGERIE
Look at me! Look at me!
Tell me, then,
If I look to you
Like a little fat hen!
Look at me! Look at me!
Tell me, too,
If I look at
Like a poor lamb to you?


CONFUSION
An ignoramus someone said . . .
Yes, thats what I must be!
But how can I be someone else?
Why, I can see Im me!


DISGRA CE
Ev’ry day I’m told to see
That I am very good -
Not behave as children do -
But as a grown-up should!
Ev’ry day I’d like to say
I’ve not been good at all . .
And no better I’ll be, when
I'm turned face to the wall!


REPETITION
Look at my elbow-thru again -
What will I say when, Please explain
Somebody says at home to me?
What happened this time, I cant see!


ED UCA TION
A bag I need for my books, I know
But that one won t do at all ... .
Why, looking at it I’m sure they’d say
That I was still much too small
To learn any lessons - they would think
Tho they might try not to say
That I should still be at home with you . . . .
And only allowed to play!


LAZYBONES
Clicketty! Clicketty! Click! Click! Clop!
Why can t they be quiet - broom and mop
As I pick them up and put them down -
A handy man - on the way to town?
But what 111 do when I get that far
Clean a window pane or motor car -
I can’t decide on! I think that then
111 just turn round and come home again!


V> 4^/
I MPA TIENCE
I think that I would like to go
Around the world! One thing I know
Is that I’d like to start off now ....
Not wait till I’m grown-up, somehow!


COINCIDENCE
Now, when the postman comes our way,
Hell A he says to me
Soon I’ll be quite grown-up,” I say,
A postman then, 77/ be!”
Well! Well!” he says, “I think that’s fine!
When I was small like you
I used to say when I grew up
Fd be a postman, too!”


O UTING
Good-day!’ The station-master said
Good-day!’ I told him, too!
And then, he said, “Well, now, must I
Stop this whole tram for you?
I'm small’, I said, “I know but I
Must get to town, you see ....”
Come, jump on quick! The said then
“And leave the rest to me!”
