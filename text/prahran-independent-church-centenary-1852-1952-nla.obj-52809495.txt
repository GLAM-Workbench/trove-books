A HYMN FOR OUR CENTENARY
We give Thee thanks, Eternal
God,
For all Thy wondrous ways,
For blessings sent throughout
the years
We lift our songs of praise.
Oft did our fathers meet with
Thee
Here in this hallowed place,
Receiving strength for all life’s
tasks
By Thy free gift of grace.
Their trust was placed in one
great Name,
All other names above.
Their service for the King of
Kings
' Was the response of love.
No second best was good
enough
For Him who gave His all,
They heard Him say, "Take up
thy cross,”
And answered to the call.
Here, may we still meet with
our God,
The gift of grace to seek.
Assured that trusting Him will
mean
Strength even to the weak.
If, when Thy call, oh Lord, we
hear,
We stay to count the cost.
Oh, fill us with the Saviour’s
love,
Who sought and saved the
lost.
