Centennial Garland:
AN AUSTRALIAN
GIFT-BOOK AND SOUVENIR
TO FRIENDS ACROSS THE SEAS.
JVTelbQam� centennial, infertTatinnal
Exhibition,
Advance, Australia. A nation?s deeds
Shine brighter on the page of peace than war ;
And though renown is won on fiery steeds,
Yet laurels gained without are better far
Give me a battle without wounds and smoke,
Where beauty ?neath the brush or chisel grows,
And rivals meet ?but only to provoke
That perfect talent God alone bestows. _
Hast thou a talent, brother, which doth shine .
Let no rude blemish mar the blessing given,
But offer it in faith at Wisdom?s shrine, _
That thou mayst give a good account in Heaven.
Its price is greater far than much fine gold.
And all its worth on earth can ne er be told.
Riddle,
The reader should not look for the solution of this
riddle (which will be found on another page) until he has
tried to solve it. The answer was composed in rhyme
bv the author of this work, and was awarded an addition
valuable prize for solution. _ It is an intellectual pastime
and well worthy the attention of the reader.
Pronounced as one letter, and written with three,
Two letters there are, and two only in me ;
I am double, I?m single, am black, blue, and grey,
I am read from both ends, and the same either way.
I am restless and wandering, steady and fixed.
And you know not one hour what I may be the next ,
I melt and I kindle, beseech and defy,
I am watery and moist, I am fiery and dry.


I am scornful and scowling, compassionate, meek r
I am light, I am dark, I am strong, I am weak,
I am sluggish and dead, I am lively and bright,
I am sharp, I am flat, I am left, I am right.
I am piercing and clear, I am heavy and dull,
Expressive and languid, contracted and full,
I am careless and vacant, I search and I pry,
Am judge, and decide, and examine and try.
I?m a globe and a mirror, a window, a door,
An index, an organ, and fifty tilings more ;
I belong to all animals under the sun,
And to those which were long understood to have none*
By some I am said to exist in the mind,
And am found in potatoes, and needles and wind ;
Three jackets I own, of glass, water, and horn,
And I wore them all three on the day I was born.
I am covered quite snug, have i lid and a fringe,
Yet I move any way on invisible hinge ;
A pupil I have, a most whimsical wight,
Who is little to-day and grows big in the night ?
Whom I cherish with care as pert of myself,
For in truth I depend on this delicate elf,
Who collects all my food, and, with wonderful knack,.
Throws into a net which I keej at my back.
And though heels over head it irrive, in a trice
It is sent up to table, all proper and nice.
I am spoke of sometimes as if I were glass,
But then it is false and the trie . will not pass.
A blow makes me sore though I have not a limb.
Though I neither have fins nm a bladder, I swim ;
Like many more couples, my artner and I
At times will look cross at eac other and shy ;
Yet still, though we differ in w t we?re about,
One will do all the work when the other is out.
I am least apt to cry, as they a ways remark,
When trimmed with good lasb and kept in the dark.


Should I fret and be heated they put me to bed,
And leave me to cool upon water and bread ;
But if hardened I grow they make use of the knife,
Lest an obstinate humor endanger my life.
Or you may, tho? the treatment appears to be rough,
Run a spit through my side and with safety enough.
Like boys who are fond of the fruit and their play,
I am seen with my ball and my apple all day.
My belt is a rainbow, I reel and I dance,
I am said to retire, tho? I never advance.
I am read by physicians, as one of their books,
And am used by the ladies to fasten their hooks.
My language is plain, tho? it cannot be heard,
And I speak without ever pronouncing a word ;
Some call me a diamond, some say I am jet,
Others talk of ray water and how I am set.
I?m a borough in England, in Scotland a stream,
And an isle of the sea in an Irishman?s dream.
The world without me would no longer appear,
And sun, moon, and stars at my wish disappear.
Yet so frail is my tenure, so brittle my joy,
That a speck gives me pain and a drop can destroy.
ISIgl&t Htouiirs la "Victoria.
Arise, Victoria ! lift up thy voice !
Much cause for joy doth make thee glad to day ;
Awake with jubilee and anthem?s choice,
And tell thy deeds in song and thrilling lay.
Land of the waving gum and wattle bright,
Land of the rocky bed and mountain height,
Land of the rich-veined earth and golden mine,
Break forth in melody and flowing rhyme.
Scarce fifty years have fled, yet in thy day
Much hast thou done to make for thee a name ;
And other lands with honest truth may say
Thy merit well deserves a niche in fame.
Too poor my lay to tell of all thy worth,
For much that?s great and good in thee hath birth.


A goodly list thy great achievements are,
Thy championship of liberty and right :
To-day admiring crowds may see how far
In labor?s cause thou art prepared to fight.
Their banners gleaming in the golden sun,
The sons of labor take the field to-day,
And cornets, drums, and cymbals wake the town,
Proclaiming this the people?s holiday.
At rest the ponderous hammer now is laid,
No scream is heard of swift, revolving saw,
For labor?s chime hath ceased ?the tribute?s paid,
And now hath ? Eight Hours system ? passed in
The rightful cause we plead will stronger be,
And brethren live in peace and unity.
Bound by a threefold cord that will not break,
Each noble craft will make a stand to-day,
And speak with trumpet voice for conscience sake :
? Stand firm and thou shalt win the victory.?
Thy daughters too have nobly won their name,
And woman?s rights must be respected now.
Oh ! grudge her not her well-deserved fame,
But place the chaplet on her honored brow ;
For daughters, mothers, are matured by time,
And they become the guardians of our youth.
Their guides and teachers in all work sublime,
To train our children valiant for the truth,
And many yet unborn shall bless the day
When labor fought and won the victory.
For this we toil with hopeful heart and hand,
May every land with us the blessing share,
And hoist the Eight Hours Flag on every strand ;
We long to see its banner planted there.
By truth we shall prevail and not by might,
For truth will spread and burn its way like fire.
Our cause is just and Heaven defends the right?
The laborer is worthy of his hire.
O, Thou alone, who over land and sea
Dost reign supreme, the Sovereign Lord of all,
Protect our homes and guard our liberty,
And to our standard all the nations call,
Till all mankind in brotherhood unite,
And capital and labor cease to fight.


Tto� @M las Goes* t@ f�wa.
J. G. Swinerton.
Well, wife, I?ve been to ?Frisco?, an? I called to see the
boys ;
I?m tired, an? more?n half deadened with the travel and
the noise,
So I?ll sit down by the chimbley, and rest my weary bones,
And tell how I was treated by our ?ristocrat sons.
As soon?s I reached the city I hunted up our Dan ?
Ye noo he?s now a celebrated wholesale business man.
I walked down from the depo?, but Dan keeps a country
seat,
An? I thought to go home with him an? rest my weary
feet.
All the way I kep? a thinkin? how famous it ?ud be,
To go around the town together?my grown up boy an?
me ;
An? remember the old times, when my little ? curly
head ?
Used to cry out, ? Good night, papa !? from his little
trundle bed.
I never thoVt a minit that he wouldn?t want to see
His gray an? worn old father, or would be ashamed of me;
So when I seen his office, with a sign writ out in gold,
I walked in without knockin??but the old man was too
bold.
Dan was sittin? by a table, an? a writin? in a book ;
He know?d me in a second, but he gave me such a
look ;
He never said a word o? you, but axed about the grain,
An? ef I thought the valley didn?t need a little rain.
I didn?t stay a great while, but inquired after Bob ;
Dan said he lived upon the hill?l think they call it Nob ;
An? when I left, Dan, in a tone that almost broke me
down,
Said, ? Call an? see me, wont ye, whenever you?re in
town ??


I was rather late that evenin? when I found our Robert?s
house ;
There was music, lights and dancin?, and a mighty big
carouse.
At the door a nigger met me, an? he grinned from ear to
ear,
Sayin?, ? Keerds ob inbitation, or you nebber git in here.?
I said I was Bob?s father ; an? with another grin,
The nigger lef? me standin? and disappeared within.
Bob came out on the porch, he didn?t order me away,
But said he hoped to see me at his office the next day.
Then I started for a tavern, for I know?d there, anyway,
They wouldn?t turn me out so long?s I?d money fur to pay.-
An? Bob an? Dan had left me about the streets to roam,
An? neither of them axed me if I?d money to git home.
It may be the way o? rich folks ?I don't say ?at it is not ?
But we remember some things Dan an? Bob have quite
forgot.
We didn?t quite expect this, wife, when, twenty years ago,
We mortgaged the old homestead to give Rob and Dan
a show.
I didn?t look fur Charley, but I happened just to meet
Him with a lot o? friends o? his?n, a cornin? down the
street.
I thought I?d pass on by him, for fear our youngest son
Would show he was ashamed o? me, as Rob and Dan
had done.
But as soon as Charley seen me, he, right afore ?em all,
Said, ? God bless me, there?s my father !? as loud as he
could bawl.
Then he introduced me to his fren?s, an? sent ?em all away,
Tellin? ?em he?d see ?em later, but was busy for that day.^
Then he took me in to dinner, an? he axed about the
house,
About you, an? Sally?s ?baby, an? the chickens, pigs, an?
cows ;
He axed about his brothers, addin? that ?twas rather queer,
But he hadn?t seen one uv ?em fur mighty nigh a year. _


Then he took me[to his lodgin?, in an attic four stairs high?
He said he liked it better? ?cause ?twas nearer to the sky.
An? he said, ? I?ve only one room, but my bed is pretty
wide,?
An? so we slept together, me and Charley, side by side.
Next day we went together to the great Mechanics? Fair,
An? some o? Charley?s picters was on exhibition there.
He said if he could sell ?em, which he hoped to pretty soon,
He?d make us all a visit an? ? be richer than Muldoon.?
An? so two days an? nights we passed, an? when I come
away,
Poor Charley said the time was short and begged me fur
to stay.
Then he took me in a buggy an? druv me to the train,
An? said in just a little while he?d see us all again.
You know we thought our Charley would never come to
much ;
He was always readin? novels, an? poetry, an? such.
There was nothing on the farm he ever seemed to want
to do,
An? when he took to paintin? he disgusted me clear
through.
So we gave to Rob and Dan all we had to call our own,
An 1 left poor Charley penniless to make his way alone.
He?s only a poor painter, Rob and Dan are rich as sin ;
But Charley?s worth the pair of ?em with all their gold
thrown in.
Those two grand men, dear wife, were once our prattling
babes, an? yet
It seems as if a mighty gulf ?twixt them an? us is set ;
An? they?ll never know the old folks till life?s troubled
journey?s past,
An? rich an? poor are equal underneath the sod at last.
An? maybe, when we all meet on the resurrection morn,
With our earthly glories fallen, like the husks from the
ripe corn?
When the righteous Son of Man the awful sentence shall
have said,
The brighest crown that?s shining there may be on
Charley?s head.


Sqjmet
To the Right Honorable Francis Ormond, Founder
' of the Working Men?s College.
While other poets tell in thrilling lay
Of deeds of valor wrought on hostile plains.
And to their gallant heroes homage pay
(Large meads of honor in long measured strains),
Shall I be mute and let a princely deed,
Admired alike by all the wise and good,
Escape my muse unsung ??My class and creed
Might call me ingrate justly if I should.
Ho ! ye whose blows upon the iron ring
With stroke more true than tread of marshalled host,
And all who to your country labor bring,
Without whose aid a nation would be lost,
To feel your claims and urge their sterling worth,
A nobler name than Ormond ne?er had birth.
Tfae Flooding of t&� Mia�.
Ye toilers in cities who dwell in the light,
Where the sun fills with beauty the vision of sight ;
Who never have entered the bowels of th? earth,
Give heed to my story and pause in your mirth.
Come with me a moment, I?ll take you below,
Where the grass is not seen, and flowers never grow ;
Where the forest is dead in the deep timbered mine,
And gold has laid dormant through ages of time.
The best lighted mine is a very dark place,
And oft a long journey to visit the face ;
The lights in the drive, as they glimmer and fret,
Seem but to recede as the nearer we get.
So a ship on the ocean may often be seen,
Like a speck o?er the waves which are rolling between ;
And the twinkling stars in the blue-vaulted sky,
Though far in the distance, seem almost as nigh.


But what is that light, now increasing in size ???
Like a meteor bright it is dazzling our eyes.
See, it is moving, and nearer it comes,
With a low, rumbling noise as of tragedy drums.
How lucky are we that a truckman draws near ;
All laden with *mullock he soon will appear ;
So we will entreat him to shorten the space,
And ride in the truck which returns to the face.
? Hi! truckman, good fellow, we bide you good time !
We would ride in your truck to the face of the mine ! ?
? All right, my fine masters, and welcome you are ;
You need not a ticket to cover your fare.
Just step in this drive which is vacant awhile,
It would take half-an-hour with the hardest of toil,
For a stranger to walk from the shaft to the face ?
Two thousand odd yards?at a brisk walking pace.?
Not long do we wait for our guide to appear,
For soon he returns and approaches us near.
Away we go rumbling at eight knots an hour,
And odd-looking places we pass on our tour.
Our truckman, a type of the Chesterfield school,
To be courteous to all men has made it a rule.
There are tjump-ups, and IMonkeys, and numerous
�Levels,
Described by our friend as we pass on our travels.
For a moment we halt in a dark-looking place,
Where a dull thudding echo resounds from the face ;
We are told that a miner is working for air,
Extending a drive to a ||Winze that is near.
He has thrown off his clothing more freely to strive,
And IFbared to the waist he is seen in the drive ;
While the sweat, as it rolls in huge drops from his brow,
Makes the labor more arduous assigned him to do.
* Any kind of dirt which is not wash-dirt.
f A rise to a higher level. X A blind shaft.
� Different levels of ground driven at various depths.
|| Similar to Monkey or Jump-ups.
IT Working bared to the waist is a plan sometimes adopted in close
drives, and in some lead mines when the workmen approach
near to the lode the drills also become heated, and are
alternately cooled by dipping them in cold water, a lad being
set apart for the purpose.


My muse in wild fancy, impelled by the sight,
Over forty odd summers takes backward her flight
To the haunts of my boyhood, where oft I would roam
With the friends of my youth in that dear native home,
In a stately old wood where the hazelnuts grow,
And the oak and the chestnut their broad shadows throw,
By a long winding path to a weird looking spot,
And a wide yawning cavern I?ve never forgot.
I have crept in its chambers, half trembling with fear,
To hide from my playmates and give them a scare ;
With a spirit of mischief unheeding my calls,
They would roll a large rock from its dark, slimy walls ;
From the loud hollow sound which in thunders it gave,
I would rush in affright to the mouth of the cave,
Which when I had clambered with many a fall,
I would join in a laugh with the loudest of all.
Again we are rumbling along the main drive,
And safely at length at the face we arrive ;
Two hours have been spent with inspection and thrift,
With the captain in charge of the underground shift.
The men are all busy, the trucks come and go,
The work is progressing, and blow after blow
Can be heard from the face, where the pickmen are
breaking
The rich golden dirt which the truckers are taking.
?Tis a fact now established with all thinking minds,
That the deeper, *the thicker and richer the finds ;
As if the Creator designed it should be
That a diligent hand all His treasures should see.
So, in the grand order of wisdom and skill,
All His gifts are engaged from the mind to the will ;
There are some to direct and some to control,
?Til a fabric is woven a beautiful whole.
Hut hark ! what was that ? How unusual the sound !
There surely has happened some great fall of ground !
? Hie ! back ! ? cries our guide ; ? go no further ahead,
For the timber is falling and danger will spread.
* The greater thickness of wash-dirt makes them pay better.


Make away to the shaft and give the alarm
To be ready above should the shift meet with harm !?
And away at his warning we suddenly start,
When, lo ! a sight meets us that chills every heart.
A huge wall of water, some five feet in height,
From a burst in old workings, was gathering in might,
With a roar as of thunder which gave a sure proof
That the drives were all filling close up to the roof.
In much quicker time than it takes in the telling,
We rush through the waters so rapidly swelling ;
The signal is given for hauling up men,
And exhausted we breathe on the surface again.
On the stillness of night broke the low, wailing sound
From the mourners who sat in their anguish around.
The plunge of the lift and the noise of the water
Struck cold on the heart of wife, mother, and daughter ;
Their sobs and their wailings were painful to hear,
And blanched were their cheeks from most heartrending
fear;
While whispered enquiry was eagerly made
If haply foundation for hope might be laid.
Thus, fraught with these terrors, the hours dragging by,
How slowly they moved for the friends waiting nigh.
In sadness and sorrow two days have now passed,
But the morning has dawned that brings succour at last;
For now a brave fellow descending below,
To see if the water has eased in its flow,
Reported with gladness, when hauled up alive,
The timber all showing along the main drive.
The moments are precious which now intervene,
For Hope she 4 s a ray of glad light on the scene ;
A score of bm s spirits who risked their own lives
Had formed a bold party to clear out the drives.
Their toil was incessant, each one at his post;
The work never ceased, not a moment was lost;
Relieving each other, good men underground,
A party more noble there co tld not be found.


No rest to their eyelids the poor watchers gave;
It is not for sleep but good tidings they crave.
At last from the knocker, so measured and slow,
*Three raps are received from the party below :
? A man coming up,? is the cry heard above,
And the rope o?er the pulley is now seen to move.
How eager the throng gathers near to the brace,
And the struggle within can be read in each face.
The cage reached the height where its passengers land,
And 'a pitman had scarcely the surface regained,
When a jubilant cry, ? The men are all right!?
Burst forth from his lips, and was hailed with delight.
Ah ! this was the message they wanted to hear,
And loud were the echoes that rang with their cheer.
The cry of salvation was fanned by desire,
?Till it spread like the flames of a forest on fire.
He told a brave story which filled them with hope,
How their leader had shifted some drift near the roof,
That he crawled o?er the top to the No, 9 Level,
Expecting to find them secure from the evil.
He called for them loudly, none answered him then,
And bravely he struggled to rise No. 10 ;
Not there had the rescue the missing ones found,
But hid in a cleft in the still rising ground.
? There, clinging for life in the uppermost drive,?
Said the pitman, ? our friends will be rescued alive.?
Ah ! fatal the error, the poor twenty-two
Told a sorrowful tale of this message untrue :
For when at last they had reached to the level,
Where the workmen had fled to escape from the evil,
Oh! what a sad sight for those true hearts and bold,
Twenty miners and two were found lifeless and cold.
Yet great was their joy when five mates of the shift
Were found, though exhausted, half hidden by drift.
A tin billy-can, with the name of its owner,
And where to be found, inscribed on the cover,
Lay there in the drive?a pearl of great find
To the friends in bereavement left weeping behind.
* The signal ? I want to speak to you,? and once more, viz., four
raps ?a man coming up.?


Tho? mournful and sad are such tokens of love,
Yet the heart clings around them its fondness to prove.
But wearisome days and long nights, have an end :
For Time is a victor no foe can withstand,
And engines are mighty with huge lifting power,
So the water diminished and lessened each hour ;
And the suffering ones who escaped with their lives
Were restored to their homes, or their fond, loving wives ;
But the poor twenty-two it was otherwise willed
Should leave a sad gap which can never be filled.
My task is now ended. This story of sorrow
Some one will repeat on the far-distant morrow.
I ask for the miner whose life has been spent
In building a country of wealth and extent,
That the country will give him a rest and a home
When his limbs are disabled and feeble have grown ;
And that help for his widow and children be found
When his form lies in silence beneath the cold ground.
Solution of Riddle ?Tllo
In Cole?s Grand Book Arcade there was a riddle made,
With a promise of reward for the answers one and all.
In my brain I tried to fiddle the solution of the riddle,
And the music of my dreaming my muse shall now
recall.
Like the famous Tommy Horner, I sat down in a corner ;
With the Herald in my hand, I scanned the riddle o?er ;
Said I??If there?s a medal for the solving of the riddle,
I?ll find the key, the hidden key, that shall unlock the
door.?
What is better than the eye, to beseech or to defy ?
No tongue in human language can such speaking
power proclaim ;
And the boy who learns his lesson will make you this
confession ?
Spell forward or spell backward, the eye is still the
same.


Some eyes are bright and cheery, and some are dull and
dreary ;
The soldier?s eye doth kindle when he meets with
gallant foes.
Some eyes are weak and flighty, and others strong and
mighty ;
The sick man?s eyes are heavy, as everybody knows.
Some eyes are dull and stupid, and escape the shaft of
Cupid,
And some are often used with hooks to fasten ladies?
trains ;
Some look this way, some that, and are sharper than the
cat,
And you never know when they may take advantage
of your brains.
The colors of the eyes are as varied as their size,
And the lid and fringe to beauty plays a most impor-
tant part ;
But to see some luckless wight deprived the sense of
sight
Brings a twinge of pity to the soft and sympathetic
heart.
This organ we shall find is an index of the mind,
Where is seen, as in a mirror, the motions of the soul ;
So the eye of flirting beauty has no charm for honest
duty,
But, bravely pressing forward, it is fixed on duty?s goal.
The doctor can discern when the sick man has a turn,
As he looks with skilful watching into his patient?s eye;
?Tis a wonderful construction, full of wisdom and in-
struction,
Most joyful in a pleasant laugh, and painful in a sigh.
Now should I get the medal, I may often use my fiddle
To play a tune some other time when riddling is the
rage ;
But if, upon inspection, my paper meets rejection,
I?ll never make another stroke upon the riddler?s page.
