Mr. Higgins : “ Tommy, when you get
to be the head of a family what will you
say to your sons ? ”
Tommy Higgins (thoughtfully): “I
will tell them how good I was when I
was a boy.”
“ Dear sister,” wrote the little boy, “ I
am saving up my money to buy you a
birthday present, but I am not going to tell
you what it is. It’s going to be a surprise
for yon. .. . We are all well, and send
you lots of love.
“P.S. —Are nice red parasols in fashion
now, and do the young ladies in the city
carry them when they go out walking ?
—Feed.”
“Tommy,” said Mrs. Weatherwax—
“ Tommy, will you never know which side
your breed is buttered on?”
“ Not,” returned the thankless child,
as a spasm of unutterable longing shook
his frame —“not until the butter is laid
on Wit.* mu. 6 generosity than, at -present
characterises your administration.”
Mr. M. Balrner, the undertaker, was
never at a loss lor au answer when any-
one attempted to poke fun at him or his
pro'essio! . One day a would-be wit
remarked to him:
“ Yours must be a gruesome business,
Mr. Balrner I suppose you undertakers
never look at a roan without wishing him
dead P”
“You are mistaken,” replied the
undertaker. “I know some people whom
I would be perfectly willing to bury alive.

“What’s in a name?” growled the

Colonel Francis Bacon were discussing

“Several volumes,” replied Bacon, in

“You’ll become used to the motion of

husband, soothingly. “ It’s your home,

“ I trust your husband had something

Thus an American paper . The tele-
graph companies of Australia suffer a
good deal from the fondness of the
natives for bracelets and ear and nose
rings made of telegraph wire.” All this
statement., by the way, is true, except
that there are no telegraph companies in
Australia, and that the few stray aborig-
inals to be found near telegraph lines
never dream even remotely of touching
the wires. The remainder of the state-
ment is quite correct, that is, if there is
any remainder.

ANOTHER VICTORY OVER HYDATIDS.
Forsyth Street, Sand Hill, WaggaWagga, 13th. March, 1900.
I feel it my duty to testify to the wonderful cure of Hydatids that has been effected in my own case by the
use of WEBBER’S VITADATIO. I have suffered for the PAST SIX (6) YEARS from HYDATIDS ON
THE LUNG, and during that time I HAD SEVERAL SEVERE HEMORRHAGES, my life at times was des-
paired of, and twice the Sacrament was administered to me by our minister (Rev. 6. A. Carver). Life in itself
was simply a burden. I was attended to by doctors in Wagga and Sydney, who were very kind, and did all
in their power to alleviate my suffering. AFTER USING THE VITADATIO THE HYDATID AND CYSTS
WERE EXPELLED PROM MY EuDY, and lam thankful to say I have been restored to HEALTH and
STRENGTH SOLELY BY THE USE OF WEBBER’S VITaDATIO. I am willing that you should use this
in anv way you choose, hoping it may be the means of leading other poor sufferers to try Webber’s
renowned Vitadatio. Yours respectfully.
Witness—W. J. FIST. (Mrs.) H. A. RUDD.
The facts of Mrs. Rudd’s illness are to my knowledge, exactly as she states, although I know nothing of the
nature of the disease or its symptoms, but she certainly is now well and strong. (Signed)

Dear Sir,-
Dr. WAUGH’S BAKING POWDER Beats all tfie Rest.'
“ Colonel,” said the distinguished
Kentuckian’s northern visitor, “ I have
noticed Ihat when you take your first drink
of whisky in the morning, or at noon, or in
the evening, or, in fact, at any other time,
you always take two more almost im-
mediately afterwards. Isn’t one at a
time enough to satisfy you ? ”
“ One would be plenty to satisfy me,
sah,” the colonel replied. “It isn’t my-
self, sah, that I considab, sah, when I take
the second drink. I take the second to
keep the first from getting lonesome,
sah.”
“ Oh, I see. That’s very considerate
of you. And how about the third F ”
“Well, sah, wheah two are gathered
together theah may be disputes. So I
take the thuhd in ohder, sah, that theah
shall be an ahbitratah handy in case of
trouble.”
The Amateur: “I’ve been here a couple
of hours, and I haven’t caught anything.”
The Professional: “Well, you just have
patience, an’ your hook may drift nigh
some fish that’s trying to commit suicide.”
In England the average weight of men
is 155 lb.
Striking an average, English women
wear shoes two sizes larger than American
women.
WORDS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE. ORIGIN OF GREAT INVENTIONS.
He—“ Just think of it. They say
man descended from a monkey.” She-
u A come down, indeed.”
Shakespeare, who had the richest
vocabulary used by any Englishman,
employed only 16,000 words. Milton
could pick out from 8,000, but the aver-
age man, a graduate from one of the
great universities, rarely has a vocabulary
of more than 3000 or 4000 words. The
ordinary person can get along comfortably
with 500 words, and in the rural districts
a knowledge of 200 words is sufficient to
carry a, man through his life. This of
course refers to the needs of conversation.
If a man wants to read newspapers and
well-written books, he must know at
least 2000 words.

“ How long, my young friend,” inquired
the venerable judge, “ have you been try-

“ Six years,” said the young barrister.

managed to pick up a pretty good living.”

Changed His Mind.
A young man about twenty-three years of age
dressed like a farmer, had his feet on the oar
•eat ia front of him and was reading a novel,
when one of the boys went over to him and ob-
served ;
“ I've just made a bet of five dollars on you.”
“Onme 1 What ia it ?”
“ I’ve bet five dollars that you will suicide
within a week. I’ve been watching you very
closely for the last half hour, and ail signs in-
dicate melancholy and despondency. Have you
■elected anj' particular line of killing yourself—
poison, the rope, drowning or hanging ? ”
“Did you actually bet five dollars?” an
xiously asked the young man.
“ I did.”
“ Pay if you lose ? ”
“I’ll have to.”
“ That’s too bad. 1 wish I could have seen
you last week.”
“ Why last week ? ”
“ Because I then had the ager every day right
along —two cows were sick on my hands—my
girl had gone back on me. and I expected a
Windmill man was going to beat me out of four
hundred dollars. I did kinder think of suicide.”
“ But now ? ”
“All is changed. Cows got well —ager all
gone- —gal has set the day for next Wednesday,
and the windmill man is straighter than a board

He’d Stop Over.
A new story was afloat on Prince Russell
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
night, and is credited to W. W. Dudley.
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe, On the way over he told his
fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England ? ”
“Well,” said the Prince, “It’s this way:
If the Prince of Wales should go to
America and pass through Washington
without stopping to call on father, we’d
think it darned queer, an’ so I thought
Fd stop over here a few days and pay my
respects to the Queen.” —“New York Star.’
Story of a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wife
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had' made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment, she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “high
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball. Sitting in her box, resplendent
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reportprial description the following day
in the chief paper of the city.—“ New
York Press.”

pleted 1400 miles of telegraph line, about
1000 miles of road, and 8000 miles of
railway.
