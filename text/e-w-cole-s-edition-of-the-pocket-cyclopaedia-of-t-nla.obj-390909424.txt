HISTORICAL.
History of Kan,
Contributed by Edward Clodd, author of “ The Story of Creation6rc.
Origin. —Science includes man with lemurs, monkeys, and apes in the
order Primates, but man is not in direct descent from the ape. Each is the
descendant of common mammalian ancestors, tree-dwellers in torrid zones in
Tertiary times. From these ancestors man and ape branched off in different
directions, man reaching the topmost place. This he secured through his
bigger brain, whereby he outwitted his competitors; and by his erect position,
which set free his fore-limbs. These modifications were acquired gradually.
There is no sharp dividing line between the man-like ape and the ape-like
man, so that the oft-used term “primitive man ”is a misnomer. The diffe-
rences between the various races, e.g., in their bodily features, modes of life,
language, etc., have been gradually brought about by the different conditions
under which they lived as they spread themselves over the earth.
Harliei* Traces. —But the main resemblances are greater than the
differences. Man’s earliest state was that of savagery with the germs of
social life in it. The earliest traces of him are not in his own fragile remains,
but in tools and weapons of rudely-chipped flint and other accessible materials’.
Some of these are said to occur in Tertiary deposits in France and Portugal
and to bear traces of fire. This would prove their human origin, for man is
the only fire-producer, an art perhaps learned as he saw sparks fly from struck
flints, or as he rubbed bodies together. It has given rise to many myths and
legends.
The successive stages of man’s advance from the Quaternary period, when
he had become man in the full sense of the word, have been divided into four
ages, namely:—
I. The Palaeolithic or Ancient Stone Ag-«, when roughly-
worked flints and stones, and also bone, horn, and wood, were the materials
used for tools and weapons. These are found, some in old river-gravels
called the Drift, and others, of rather higher type, in limestone caverns (as
Kent’s Hole, Torquay), with bones of the woolly-haired elephant or mammoth
and reindeer, on some of which rude pictures of the creatures themselves are
scratched. Man was then in the hunting or lowest stage, living on roots and
fruits, fish, and such beasts and birds as he could kill, and clothed in skins
flung over him or sewn together with sinews by bone needles, his dwellings
being caves and rocks or tree-shelters. The now extinct Tasmanians most
nearly represented Palaeolithic man’s general state. The Palaeolithic Age is
separated from all succeeding ages by a vast lapse of time and a vast gap of
unlike conditions, Britain being then joined to the continent.
J[l. The Neolithic or Jewer Stone Ag-e, when man ground
and polished his stone implements, hafting his axes and lances, &c., and
showing skill in their shape, as in barbed arrowheads. Rustics called these
“elf-darts,” and used them "as charms against the “little folk.” Man had
then approached a more settled state, partly as shepherd, partly as tiller of
the soil, as evidenced in bones of domestic animals (the dog, earliest of all),
and in seeds, cereals, &c. 2 found in the Swiss lake-dwellings and elsewhere.
Between this and succeeding ages there is no break.


History of Xfan — continued.
XXI. Ill* Ag'e of Bronx*, when the great start was made through
the discovery of metals, copper first, and most easily worked of all, then the
compound copper and tin, forming the harder metal bronze. Following this is
IV. Ill* JLg - * of Iron, when this most valuable of all the metals
superseded the others as man’s mighty weapon in his subdual of the earth.
These four ages are not synchronous. Certain races, as those of Southern
Europe, had advanced to the use of metals when races of Northern Europe
were in the stone-using stage. Neither is the sequence of the three later ages
universal, for some races, as in Africa and Polynesia, passed direct from the
use of stone to that of iron through its introduction by white people.
But just as the lower life-forms remain dominant, so in the course of human
history the actual number of races who have reached a civilised state is a
mere fraction of the total number of mankind. Even the civilised peoples
have had their rise and decline, although, in the main, through shifting of
centres of civilisation, the higher races subdue and extinguish the lower, as
we note in the struggles of to-day. War has been a mighty factor in develop-
ment, in uniting peoples together, and fostering manly virtues.
The advance in things, both material and moral, which man has made is
laid clear by the modern science of Anthropology.
Illustration* ol Progress.—From unhafted stone tools and
weapons to modern machinery ; from clothes of twisted grass to woven
fabrics; from tattooing and shell ornament (decoration often preceding dress)
to costly jewels; from wigwam and mud hut to mansion and palace; from
heap of burial stones to pyramid; from scratchings on bones to works of
Phidias and Raphael; from twanged bow-string to violin of Stradivarius;
from picture-writing to alphabets; from signs and imitative sounds to rich
vocabularies; from bark or “ dug-out ” canoe to stately ship ; from calabash
and coconut shell and clay-smeared vessel to fictile ware of Sevres; from
family life —of the primitive forms of which little, if anything, can be known—
to tribal and national life; from work done by one to work divided amongst
the many—ruling, trading, fighting; from coarse rites, and bloody offerings
to innumerable spirits—souls of ancestors, local gods, great gods of earth,
sea and sky—to highest worship and adoration of a Supreme Being; from
guesses to certainties, astrology to astronomy, alchemy to chemistry—these
and aught else are, with numberless gradations, the steps of advance by which
the highest races have made all things their ministers. As man’s bodily and
mental nature are alike all the world over, so have his methods of supplying
the needs of both been fundamentally the same everywhere.

Prog’reii In Steamships.
The first steam vessel to cross the Atlantic was the Savannah (100 ft. long,
300 tons burden), built at New York in 181?. The first sea-going steamer that
ever crossed the ocean propelled wholly by steam-power was the Royal
William ; length 175 feet. The first “ Cunarders ” floated were only 207 ft.
long and 35 ft. 4 in. beam.
Increase in tonnage in 50 years from 67,969 to 7,418,153. The proportion of
steamships to the total registered tonnage of British ships has increased from
1 to 28 to 1 to V]2.
Steps of Development of Marine Engines. —Screw propeller ; introduction
of iron and steel; increase of steam pressure in boiler; surface condensation ;
compound and duplicate-expansion cylinders ; use of mild steel in construc-
tion of boilers, rendering possible great increase of boiler pressure.
Result.— Reduction of 70 % in coal consumption; increase of 110 % in speed.
XGOHOMIC PROGRESS OP THE WOMB,
X. Prehistoric Xim»s.
“ Time was when clothing sumptuous or for use.
Save their own painted skins, our sires had none.”
Sir J. Lubbock distinguishes four ages in the prehistoric times :
1. The Palaeolithic, or Early Stone Age.
2. The Neolithic, or Polished Stone Age.
3. The Bronze Age.
4. The Iron Age.
In the Stone Age man was yet ignorant of pottery, had no knowledge of
agriculture, and no domestic animals, except perhaps the dog. His weapons
were the axe, the spear, and the javelin, and he was probably acquainted
with the lance. In the Bronze Age, bronze was used for arms and cutting
instruments of all kinds. In the Iron Age, iron superseded bronze for arms,
axes, knives, &c.
11. Homeric Time* (Prior to the Earliest Historic Date).
The copious descriptions of economic life in the Homeric poetry and the
remains of the Homeric age recently unearthed by Schliemann indicate a high
degree of economic development. The Greeks then had the free use of copper
for large utensils, worked leather, gold plates and elaborate head dresses
of gold. They had goblets of gold with four handles, on each handle two
doves, golden studs or buttons, painted pottery, and vases. They wrought
knives and keys of iron. The women did spinning, weaving, and fine em-
broidery. The fine arts were represented by sculpture in relief and carving in
wood and ivory.
111. Historic Times.
B.C.
2634. Mariner’s Compass claimed by
the Chinese to have been
constructed by their Emperor
Hoang-ti.
1244. Palamedes invented Dice.
570. Anaximander invented Maps.
550. Phidon invented Scales.
400. Gold first coined in Europe.
351. Silk Manufactures introduced
into Europe.
287-212. Archimedes, inventor of the
screw of Archimedes, &c.


Economic Prog-mi ot
264-221. Hero of Alexandria, flou-
rished. He resolved all
machines into the me-
chanical powers, viz., the
lever, the wheel and axle,
the wedge, the screw, and
a.d. the pulley.
605. Bells introduced in Christian
churches.
808. First Bank established in Italy
by the Lombard Jews, some
of whom settled in Lombard
Street, London.
1273. Sea-Coal prohibited in London
as “ prejudicial to health.”
1286. Clocks known in England.
1293. Spectacles invented.
1302. Flavio improved the mariners’
compass.
1320. Invention of Gunpowder by
Schwarz.

Edward Atkinson states that with labour-saving machinery one man,
working 300 days, raising wheat in Dakota, will produce wheat to make 1,000
barrels of flour. One man’s labour in Minneapolis for a year will grind
it and put it in barrels, making the barrels also. The labour of two men
only, for one year, by the aid of railways, will transport the wheat and flour
1,700 to 2,000 miles, to New York City, where it will feed 1,000 people for one
year. By the aid of machinery one workman in a cotton factory produces
cloth for 250 people, in a woollen factory for 300 people, in a boot factory
hoots for 1,000 people for a year.

drowtlt of Wenltta and Productive Power.
The following table, adapted from Mulhall, shows the value in millions of
£ of the chief industries of Europe, the United States, Argentina, Canada,
and Australia at the dates given. Assuming that the first four industries are
the direct result of human labour, and dividing their total by the population
of those countries at the several dates, we find that a man’s labour, owing to
improved machinery, represents double the value it did in 1820; but, as prices
have meanwhile fallen 33 per cent., the value of his labour in 1888, expressed
by the prices of 1820, would be £43, so that a man in any industry produces
now as much as three did in 1820, or two and a-half in 1840.

Ancient Famous Places and Thing!,
The Coliseum at Rome, built by Vespasian for 8/,000 spectators, was in
its longest diameter 612 feet, and in the shortest 513, embraced 5 acres, and
was 160 feet high.
Nine aqueducts supplied ancient Rome with water, delivering 40 millions of
cubic feet daily. That of Claudia was 46 miles long and 100 feet high. Marcia
was 6i miles, of which 7 were on arches 70 feet high.
The Temple of Diana at Ephesus was 425 feet long and 225 feet broad, with
127 columns, 60 feet high, to support the roof. It was 220 years in building.
Solomon’s Temple, built b.c. 1012-1005, was bo cubits, or 90 feet, in length, the
breadth 20 cubits, or 30 feet, and the height 30 cubits, or 45 feet. The porch
was 30 feet long and K feet wide.
_ The largest one of the Egyptian pyramids is 481 feet high, 774 feet on the
sides, and its base covers 13 acres. The layers of stones are 208 in number.
Many stones are over 30 feet long, 4 broad, and 3 thick.
The Temple of Ypsambul, in Nubia, is massive, and cut out of the solid
rock. Belzoni found in it four figures 65 feet high, 25 feet over the shoulders,
with a face of 7 feet, and the ears over 3 feet.
Sesostris erected in the temple in Memphis statues of himself and his wife
42 feet high, and of his children 28 feet.
In the Temple of the Sun at Baalbec are stones more than 60 feet long,
and 16 square, each embracing 10,000 cubic feet, cut, squared, sculp-
tured, and transported from neighbouring quarries. Six columns are each 55
feet high, composed of three stones 7 feet in diameter. Sesostris is credited
with having transported from the mountains of Arabia a rock 32 feet wide and
240 feet long.
Pompey’s Pillar is 98 feet high, and 29J round at the base.
The French removed a red granite obelisk 76 feet high, weighing 210 tons,
from Thebes, and carried it to Paris. The display of costly architectural ruins
at Thebes is one of the most astonishing to be seen anywhere in the world.


Fsmoni Places and Thin %%—continued.
Babel, now called Birs Nimroud, built at Babylon by Belus, was used as an
observatory and as a temple of the Sun. It was composed of eight square
towers, one over the other, in all 670 feet high, and the same dimensions on
each side on the ground.
The ancient battering-ram was of timber, 60 to 100 feet long, fitted with an
iron head. It was erected under shelter to protect the 60 or 100 men required
to work it. The largest was equal in force to a 36-lb. shot from a cannon.
During modern times, a block of granite weighing 1,217 tons, now used as
the pedestal of the equestrian statue of Peter the Great at St. Petersburg, was
transported four miles by land over a railway and 13 miles in a caisson by
water. The railway consisted of two lines of timber furnished with hard metal
grooves; between these grooves were placed spheres of hard brass about 6
inches in diameter. On these spheres the frame with its load was easily moved
by 60 men, working at capstans with treble-purchase blocks.
In 1716 Swedenborg contrived to transport (on rolling-machines of his own
invention) over valleys and mountains two galleys, five large boats, and one
sloop, from Stromstadt to Iderfjol (which divides Sweden from Norway on the
south), a distance of 14 miles, by which means Charles XII. was able to carry
on his plans, and under cover of the galleys and boats to transport on pontoons
his heavy artillery to the very walls of Frederickshall.

Depth of the Ocean.
The. greatest known depth of the ocean is midway between the islands of
Tristan d’Acunha and the mouth of the Rio de la Plata. The bottom was
here reached at a depth of 46,236 feet, or 8f miles, exceeding by more than
17,000 feet the height of Mt. Everest, the loftiest mountain in the world. In
the North Atlantic Ocean, south of Newfoundland, soundings have been made
to a depth of 4,580 fathoms, or 27,480 feet; while depths equalling 34,000 feet,
or 6J miles, are reported south of the Bermuda Islands. The average depth
ot the Pacific Ocean, between Japan and California, is a little over 2,000
fathoms; between Chili and the Sandwich Islands, 2,500 fathoms; and between
Chili and New Zealand, 4,500 fathoms. The average depth of all the oceans is
from 2,000 to 3,000 fathoms.
The Annual Rainfall.
It varies from nothing, as in the Sahara in Africa and the coast of Peru, to
493 inches, as in Cherrapungi in South Western Assam. The greatest rain-
fall in England is at Seathwaite, 145 inches; London has 25 ; Washington, 41;
Paris, 22; Pekin, 27; Cracow, 13; Rome, 31; Berlin, 24; San Francisco, 22;

Peculiar of Horth Pole.
At North Pole there is neither North nor East nor West, but every possible
direction therefrom is only South. The Pole being the meeting-place of all
the Msridians, it is always there any and every hour of the day and the night
you please. Your watch there always keeps perfect time, provided only it
never moves and ever points to “ all times of the day-night.”

that he was a man, and not a beast; that he was a man, and not a woman ;
and that he was a Grecian, and not a Barbarian. It was he who said “ Know
thyself.” “Few words are the sign of a prudent judgment.” “Search after
wisdom, and choose what is most worthy; so shaft thou stop the mouths of

no beginning.” “ There is nothing more beautiful than the world.” “ The
widest thing is place, for it contains all things.” “ The mind is the swiftest
thing, for it surveys all things in a moment.” “ The strongest thing, necessity,

the empire, 476 A.d. The first printed was in China, 382 A.d. From 1447
small printed sheets were issued in Germany and Venice, in which last city
the accounts of events of public interest, written and termed “ Notizie
Scritte,” were shown for the price of a “ gazetta,” a small coin, from which

Starboard and Larboard,
In Saxon bord means shield. In the Viking ships each warrior hung his
shield on the side of the ship opposite to him, and above the aperture for his
oar. The Viking held the steer oar, which was fastened to the right-hand iide
of the stem (stem is itself a contraction of steer oar). The right-hand side of
the ship thus became the steer side, and as bord came', tomean the whole side
where the shields or bords were hung, the right side came to be the steer bord
(starboard) side, and the lower or lurking side became larboard.

Curious Facts respecting* tlie JBihle.
The Bible contains 3,566,480 letters, 773,746 words, 31,102 verses (an even
number), 1,189 chapters, and 66 books; the middle chapter is Psalm c., of
which verse 3 is the central verse. Psalm Ixxviii. contains the two central
verses—32 and 33. The word and occurs 46,277 times. The word Lord occurs
over 5,000 times. The following estimate is the result of the Rev. J. S.
Black's comparative examination of the first three Gospels, as set forth in last
edition of Chambers' Encyclopcedia : —Out of a total of 1,071 verses, Matthew
has 387 in common with Mark and Luke, 130 with Mark, 184 with Luke, only
370 being peculiar to himself. Of Mark’s 662 verses, 406 are common to all
three, 145 to Mark and Matthew, 60 to Mark and Luke, and at most 51 peculiar
to himself. Luke, out of 1,151: verses, shares 390 with Matthew and Mark,
176 with Matthew, 41 with Mark, leaving 544 his own. In many instances all
three use identical language. 1 Cor. xv., verses 1-29 contain 583 words; and
verses 30-58 (also 29 verses) contain also 583 words.
Words in the English Langnag'e.
Shakespeare, who had the richest vocabulary used by any Englishman,
employed only 16,000 words. Milton could pick out from 8,000, but the average
man, a graduate from one of the great universities, rarely has a vocabulary of
more than 3,000 or 4,000 words. The ordinary person can get along very com-
fortably with 500 words, and in the rural districts a knowledge of 200 words is
sufficient to carry a man through his life. This of course refers to the needs of
conversation. If a man wants to read newspapers and well-written books,
he must know at least 2,000 words.

The" Morse” alphabet is most generally used in telegraphing on aerial lines,
and the “ needle and mirror” alphabet in sending messages by cable. Often in
messages that have become ambiguous through errors in transmission the mis-
takes can be corrected by noting the letters that are most nearly alike in signal-
ling. About 25 words of five letters each per minute can be sent by the Morse
signals, about 60 per minute by the Hughes system, and about 350 by the Wheat-
stone system. On short cables about 30 words of five letters each can be sent bv
“ N. & Mirror’ ’ per minute, and about 25 by the Siphon Recorder system.

Sever too Jf.ate to learn.
Cato, at 80 years of age, began to study the Greek language. Socrates, at
an extreme old age, learned to play on musical instruments, Plutarch, when
between 70 and 80, began to learn Latin. Dr. Johnson applied himself to the
Dutch language but a few years before his death. Ludovico Monaldesco, at
the great age of 115 years, wrote the memoirs of his own times. Ogilby, the
translator of Homer and Virgil, was unacquainted with Latin or Greek till he
was past 50. Franklin did not begin his philosophical studies till he had
reached his 50th year. Dryden in his 68th year commenced the translation of
the iEneid, his most pleasing production. Boccaccio was 30 years when he
commenced his studies in light literature; yet he became one of the three
greatest masters of the Tuscan dialect, Dante and Petrarch being the other
two. Many similar cases might be cited.
Th* term Penny, a* Applied to Wails.
The term penny as applied to nails is generally supposed to ’have been
derived from pound. It originally meant so many pounds to the thousand ;
that is, sixpenny means six pounds of nails to the thousand. The thousand
was always understood, and six pound, ten pound, etc., were gradually
shortened until the present term penny has entirely taken the place of pound.

Influence* that Mould tbe Character of the TTonng-.
An attempt is made to indicate, by the lines below, the relative importance
of the external influences that affect the character and future of the young.
Any such attempt is of necessity only approximate, but will nevertheless
afford occasion for much thought to those who will study the question.
Each reader should draw new lines to express bis own convictions.

Cannes of Crime.
Contributed by L. Gordon Rylands, M.A., author of “ Causes of Crime."
(Fisher Unwin, London.)
“The causes of crime overlap and run into one another. Thus, if a young
man frequents public-houses with bad companions, and proceeds from
drunkenness to crime, it is difficult to say whether the cause of his immorality
is drink or the influence of evil associates, and similarly in other cases.
However, in accordance with your request, I give a diagram below embodying
the conclusions at which I have arrived, so far as it is possible to form con-
clusions on so intricate a question.”
Influence of evil associates and lack of super- )
vision in youth )
Inherited disposition
Strong temptation, with favouring opportunity
Poverty
The above is essentially a cross division. A career of crime is often the
effect of more than one of the above causes, which cannot therefore be clearly
separated.
Canges of Poverty in Png-land.
Some of the causes of poverty are indicated below. The lines are drawn of
the same length in this diagram, but in a future edition their length will indicate
the comparative importance of the causes. The editor will be glad to receive
revised diagrams from any who have made a study of the subject.
Want of thrift, living up to income, waste in food and clothing :
Large families :
Over-supply of labour : tenure of land:
Drinking and betting:

Short Grammar.
Three little words you often see
Are Articles, A, AN, and THE.
A Noun’s the name or any thing,
As SCHOOL or GARDEN, HOOP, or SWING.
Adjectives te 11 the kind of noun,
As GREAT, SMALL, PRETTY, WHITE or
BROWN.
Instead of Nouns the Pronouns stand—
HIS head, HER face, YOUR arm, MY hand.
Verbs tell something to be done—
To READ, COUNT, LAUGH, SING, JUMP, or
RUN.
How things are done the Adverbs tell—
As SLOWLY, QUICKLY, ILL or WELL.
Conjunctions join the words together—
As men AND women, wind OR weather.
The preposition stands before
The noun, as IN or THROUGH the door.
The interjection shows surprise—
As Oh I how pretty, AH 1 how wise.
The whole are called nine parts of speech,
Which reading, writing, speaking teach.

LOVE, MARRIAGE! JSc
The X.ang-nag'e of flowen,
Flowers may be combined and arranged so as to express even the nicest
shades of sentiment.
If a flower is offered reversed, its direct signification is likewise reversed, so
that the flower now means its opposite.
A rosebud divested of its thorns, but retaining its leaves, conveys the senti-
ment, “ I fear no longer; I hope.” Stripped of leaves and thorns, it sig-
nifies, “ There is nothing to hope or fear.”
A full-blown rose placed over two buds, signifies “ Secrecy.”
“ Yes,” is implied by touching the flower given to the lips ; “No,” by
pinching off a petal and casting it away.
“ I am,” is expressed by a laurel leaf twined around the bouquet; “ I
have,” by an ivy leaf folded together; “I offer you,” by a leaf of Virginia
creeper.

mile Marriage Uinot.
Ihe old Norse Rune, N, was called Nyth orNyd, and meant necessity, com-
pulsion or knot. The Scandinavian bridegroom drew this Rune on the finger-
nail of the bride. This Rune standing alone meant either compulsion or
marriage.
Wedding- Anniversaries.
According to Mulhall, in each year in England 15 people out of every
thousand marry. Of each 1,000 men who marry, 861 are bachelors, and 139
widowers, while of each 1,000 women only 98 have been married before, and 902
are spinsters ; 12 marriages out of every 100 are second marriages. The average
age at which men marry is years, while the average age at which women
marry is 25J years. Out of every 1,000 persons in England, 602 are unmarried,
345 are married, and 53 widowed. In England, over one-half of ail the women
between 15 and 45 are unmarried. In all countries about 5 per cent. of marriages
prove barren. Among the English nobility 19 per cent, are childless. Mamed
women live 2 years longer than single ones, although 1 in 70 dies in child-birth.
If the mother die first, the father survives g| years ; but if the father dies first,
the survival of the mother is 11J years as an average. 2,541 births occur in
England daily, about 33 per annum for each 1,000 inhabitants. February is
the month in which the greatest number of births occur, June the month in
which occur the fewest. The average number of births for each marriage is %• 75.
Out of every 1,000 births, 11 are twins, and 415- are illegitimate. In Europe
there are 34,500 births and 25,500 deaths daily ; or 22 births and 17 deaths a
minute.


Marriases — continued.
Consanguineous marriages, that is, of uncles and nieces, aunts, nephews,
and cousins, appear to have a deteriorating tendency. Bertillon says that, while
they do not originate any new infirmity, they increase defects ;
other writers say that they are a fertile source of new ills. Bemiss states
that 27 per cent, of such marriages prove barren ; Lent, that 35 per cent, of
the children are deaf mutes; Boudin, that 28 per cent, of deaf _ mutes in
France are children of marriages within the fourth degree; Darwin, that 33
per 1,000 of blind, deaf mutes, and lunatics in England are children of
cousins-german ; and Poucet, that 20 per cent, of such marriages in Mexico
are childless. Boudin says that for one deaf mute of ordinary marriages
there will be 18 if the parents are cousins, 37 if uncle and niece, and 70 if
nephew and aunt. Marriages of cousins are commoner among Protestants
than Catholics, and still more so among Jews. At Berlin it was found that
there were:—
Three deaf mutes among 10,000 Catholics.
Six ~ ~ 10,000 Protestants, and
Twenty-seven „ ~ 10,000 Jews.
Of i,549 consanguineous marriages contracted in Prussia in 1889, 1,422
were between cousins, no between uncles and nieces, and 16 between aunts
and nephews. The ratio of consanguineous marriages to the total number of
marriages in various countries per 10,000 marriages is as follows: —

The marriages with deceased wife’s sister or husband’s brother averaged

Marriases —continued.
Darwin found that among the English nobility consanguineous marriages
were six times the average of such marriages in the whole country, being 450
per 10,000. Nineteen per cent, of the nobility are childless, more than three
times the ordinary average for England. In France, however, the ratio of
children to a marriage is highest where consanguinity is most frequent, and
that the blind, deaf mutes, and insane are decidedly increased by such
marriages. The returns of all France for five years ending 1863 show the

Hint* on Etiquette.
When Introducing a friend, consider If the introduction Is likely to be acceptable—to both
parties.
A gentleman should be Introduced to the lady, not the lady to the gentleman.
If the sexes are the same, always present the Inferior In social rank to the superior.
Permission must be obtained when a gentleman is presented to a lady.
One gentleman being introduced to another, should acknowledge it by a bow, not by ottering
the hand.
Persons meeting at a common friend’s, not Introduced, should not claim acquaintance It they
meet elsewhere.
If walking with a friend, you meet or are joined by a third, it is unneccessary to Introduce
the one to the other.
At a ball or evening party, the lady of the house may introduce any gentleman to a lady
without first asking the lady’s permission, after ascertaining if the lady is willing to dance.
An introduction given to a lady at a ball does not entitle a gentleman to bow to her on a
future occasion ; if he commits that error, the lady is not bound to acknowledge his salutation.
Letters ot Introduction should be sent by post, enclosing your own card—not personal
delivery.
If desirous to pay a high compliment to the person introduced, invite him to dine with you,
and have a few friends to meet him.
Letters of introduction should be given unsealed.
Morning calls are usually made between the hours of two and four.
When returning complimentary visits, you may leave a card without going in. It is usual to
ask after the health of the family.
Visits of condolence are paid within a week after the event that occasions them.
On making morning calls, a gentleman should never leave his hat in the hall—take it Into the
room with him—it should be held in the hand, not placed on any of the furniture. Umbrellas
must be left in the hall.
If during a visit in the drawing-room (which should not exceed half-an-hour) a lady visitor
leaves, it is polite to rise.
On other visitors being announced, wait till they are seated, then depart bowing politely to
the newly-arrived guests.
Avoid looking at your watch during a visit.
In conversation avoid political, commercial, or religious subjects; never Interrupt a person
when speaking; appear to pay attention and to be interested in the conversation. Whispering
Is bad taste, or conversing in a language that all parties may not be acquainted with. It
gifted with wit, do not make a display of it. Look, but avoid staring, in the face of the P® r s°*J
you are conversing with. To be an agreeable companion, it Is necessary to be well acquainted
with the current books of the day. Scandal is inexcusable.
In conversing with persons of rank, avoid the too frequent use of their title; address a
nobleman as you would any other gentleman ; the Prince of Wales is only addressed as blr in
conversation ; the Queen, Madam.
Notes of invitation and acceptance are always written in the third person, very simple.
Notes of invitation are now issued in the name of the lady of the house. Letters addressed to
strangers should commence with Sir or Madam ; at the close of the letter, on the left hand
corner of the page, write the name of the party to whom the letter Is addressed.
Letters should be brief, and to the purpose.
At evening parties do not remain to the close. Put your gloves on previous to entering the
room. Pay your respects to the lady of the house on entering the room. Gentlemen, as a
rule, wear morning dress for all occasions before dinner, and evening dress for dinner and all
after-dinner occasions.

Under the head of “ Game ” strictly so called, are included, throughout the
United Kingdom, grouse, black game, pheasants, partridges, and hares ; for
the practically extinct bustard may be left out of consideration for ordinary
purposes, and the ptarmigan is only to be found in Scotland. In Ireland quails
and landrails are included among “ game; ” but although not so designated
in the Acts relating to Great Britain, these birds cannot be legally shot without
a game licence ; and a similar remark may be made with regard to woodcock
and snipe. The seasons are as follows: —

Licensed. inhabitants
• The number of hunting dogs In the United Kingdom Is 21,194.
Sheep Dogs are not taxed in the United Kingdom, and the total number of
dogs in the Kingdom is at least 2,000,000~-say 55 per 1000 inhabitants.
SCIE NTIFIC.
The Atmosphere.
Air, as was first ascertained in 1774, is composed, by weight, of 77 parts of
nitrogen, and 23 parts of oxygen, in too parts. There are about 4 vols. car-
bonic-acid per 10,000 vols. The pressure of the air at the earth’s surface is
14.6 lbs. to the square inch. The height of the atmosphere is computed at 100
miles, and its density diminishes with its distance from the earth’s surface.
Candles go out when the percentage of oxygen is not more than 18J. Each
adult inhales a gallon of air a minute, and consumes 30 02s. of oxygen a-day.
600 cubic feet of air space per man is allowed in barracks in Europe, 100 c
in India; 1200 cubic feet per head is allowed for hospitals in Europe, 180 c
in India. Horses require 1600 cubic feet space in England. An ordinary
gas jet consumes as much oxygen as five people.
In 1862, at Wolverhampton, Glaisher the aeronaut ascended 12,000 yards.
Specific Heat.
The quantity of heat, termed specific heat, required to raise the
temperature of a pound of water one degree is taken as unit. Substances
requiring more or less heat than does an equal amount of water to raise
their temperature one degree, are said to be of higher or lower specific heat.
Mercury requires only one-thirtieth the quantity, and its specific heat is
expressed by the figure .033. Hydrogen requires no less than nearly three
and a-half as much as water, and its specific heat is 3.405.


Wonder* of the XEenrena.
There are 18 stars of the first magnitude. These are at least 211,000 times
farther from the earth than is the sun, and their light takes over 3 years to
reach us. There are 55 of the second magnitude, their light taking over 6
years to reach us. 170 of the third magnitude, their light reaching us in over
9 years. 500 of the fourth magnitude, their light taking 12 years to reach us.
Stars as distant as those of the sixth magnitude, their light taking 36 years to
traverse the intervening space, are visible to the naked eye. Of these there
are about 6,000. A 9-ioot telescope reveals stars of the twelfth magnitude,
about 10,000,000 in number. An 18-foot telescope reveals about 27,000,000
stars, including those of the 13th magnitude, whose light takes 2,700 years to
reach us. Each of these stars is thought to be the centre of a solar system
like our own. Our own solar system consists of the Sun, and the following
planets revolving around it: Mercury, nearest the Sun, is 35,000,000 miles
distant; Venus, 67,000,000 miles; the Earth, 52,000,000 miles; Mars, 141,000,000
miles; the Asteroids, about 266,000,000 miles; Jupiter, nearly 483,000,000
miles ; Saturn, 885,000,000 miles; Uranus, 1,780,000,000 miles ; and Neptune,
2,790,000,000 miles from the Sun

Classification of Tsrrsitrisi Objects.
Every object on the Earth falls within one of the three great Kingdoms,
Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral, though some organisms are hardly dis-
tinguishable as either animal or vegetable, but have characteristics
common to both. The following classification will be serviceable : —
("Vertebrates have a f Mammals (i.e., suckling their young). 1 Warns -

The earth, conceived by the ancients as a flat disk of land washed on all
sides by the great river, Oceanus, is now ascertained to be, in form, an oblate
spheroid, its longer or equatorial diameter being 7,926.6mi1e5, and its shelter
or polar 7,899.6 miles. Its circumference at the equator is 24,899 miles, its
total area 197 million square miles, and its volume 260,000 million cubic miles.
Its elliptic revolution round the sun is called the ecliptic, and the belt of
constellations, extending to about BJ° on each side thereof, the zodiac, which
is divided into twelve equal portions called signs. The plane of the earth’s
equator forming with the plane of the ecliptic an angle of 23J 0 , the sun is
seen to ascend, between March 21st and June 21st, from equator to 23J 8 N.,
thence descends to the equator (September 23rd), and thence to 23J 0 S.
(December 21st), whence it remounts to the equator (March 21st).
The Crust of the Earth. —[See diagrams , two following pages.).
Contributed by Edward Clodd, author of“ The Story of Creation.”
Our knowledge of the earth’s crust extends only to a relatively small
depth, the aggregate thickness of the strata or rock-layers already measured
being, as shown on the following table, about 130,000 feet, or nearly
24J miles ; saji-, one one-hundred--and-sixtieth of the earth’s semi-diameter.
Rocks are divided into two classes—unstratified (which are oldest,
and, except where superposed, nearest the centre) and stratified (which
are nearest the surface, and most recent). The unstratified, which are
also called igneous or Plutonic, embrace all rocks which, as they now
exist, have been fused together by heat, or erupted from the earth’s
interior by volcanic agency.. The stratified , which are also called
aqueous or Neptunic, embrace all rocks which have been deposited
as sediment by the action of water or of the atmosphere, or which are
due to the growth and decay of plants and animals. With this class are
grouped the metamorphic, for the most part stratified rocks which have been
metamorphosed into a crystalline state by the action of heat and pressure
resulting in effacement of their original character, and in the destruction of
traces of any organic remains in them. Throughout the entire series of rocks
the newer have been, and are being, formed out of the older, which, unless
upheaved, are always found at the bottom; but of the original crust perhaps
no trace remains.
The depth to which the unstratified rocks extend is unknown, and, as they
contain no organic remains, they tell us nothing concerning the origin and
succession of life on the earth. The stratified rocks, which alone throw light
on this question, have been divided for convenience, and not as implying any
gaps between their several formations, save where natural causes have
operated, into four, or sometimes five epochs. These, together with the
typical remains of plant and animal associated, with each, are as follows :

To find the proportional parts by weight of the elements of any substance whose chemical
jormulct is known :
RULE .—Multiply together the equivalent and the exponent of each element of the com-
pound ; the product will be the proportion by weight of that element in the substance—
Example :—find the proportional weights of the elements of Alcohol C 4 H 6 02.
Carbon C 4 = equiv. 12 X exponent 4—48
Hydrogen H 6 = ~ 1 X „ 6=6
Oxygen 02= „ 16 X „ 2= 32
Of every 86 lbs. of Alcohol, 6 lbs. will be H ; 32, O ; 48, C.
To find the proportions by volume , divide by the specific gravity.

Phrenoloff*. — Invented by Dr. Gall, b. 1757, d. 1828.
Phrenology attempts to estimate the intellectual faculties and moral
character of the individual by the magnitudes and forms of the several parts
of the skull, and the general build of the whole skull. For this purpose the
head is divided into 35 sections, and the relative size (protuberance) of each
of these is taken to indicate commensurate power. The following are the 35
powers, or faculties, into which the mind is divided, and the diagrams show
the corresponding sections on the skull: —l. — Amativeness, love of the oppo-
site sex. 2. — Philoprogenitiveness , love of children. 3. — Concentrativeness.
4. — Adhesiveness, constancy in affection. 5. — Combativeness. 6.—Destruc-
tiveness. 6a.-A limen tiveness , love of eating and drinking. 7. — Secretiveness,
strongly marked, shows cunning; moderate, prudence ; feebly, want of tact.
8. — Acquisitiveness. 9. Constructiveness. 10. — Self-esteem. \\.~Love of
Approbation. 12. — Cautiousness. 13. — Benevolence. 14. Veneration. 15. —
Conscientiousness. x 6 17. — Hope, small shows despondency.
18.— Wonder, love of the marvellous. 19. — Ideality, enthusiasm for the
beautiful and perfect. 20. — Wit. 21.— Imitation. 22. — Individuality, sense
of the peculiar or individual character of any object. 23.— Form, appreciation
of form both physically and mentally. 24. — Mensuration , perception of size
and distance. 25. — Weight, ability to judge weight. 26. — Colour, appre-
ciation of colour. 27. — Locality, topographical sense. 28. — Number, faculty
of numerical calculation. 29. — Order, method. 30. — Eventuality, memory
of events, &c.; business faculty. 31. — Time. 32. — Tune, faculty for music.
33. — Language, power of expression of thought. 34. — Comparison, faculty
of drawing comparisons, 35. — Causality, ability to infer cause from effect;
no deduce effect from cause.

Handy Rule to find Sidereal Time. —(Alfred Fryer.)
For Travellers and Navigators.
The number of Sidereal days in a year is necessarily one in excess of the
number of Solar da vs. Sidereal time at noon on anv give!
date is expi
essed by
Iffltercuoxsieter — continued .
To test the correctness of a thermometer plunge it in a pail of partly-melted
broken ice and note if it correctly registers the melting point of ice as above
given.
The following are the formulae for the conversion of degrees of one scale to
those of another: —
number of Solar days. Sidereal time at noon on any given date is expressed by
the same proportion of a day that the interval between the date and the


and each day 4 minutes. Example :
To find Sidereal time when it is noon on
August 30th. August 30th is 8 months and 30 days, substracting 3 months 22
days leaves 5 months 8 days, allow 2 hours for each of the
months and 4
minutes for each of the 8 days=
10 hours 32
min. To find Sidereal time at
noon on February 15th =2
months 15 days.
add 12 months =
= 14 months IS
days -
months 22 days = 10 months 23 days
=
21 hours

time.
If greater accuracy be needed, add to or subtract from the result the number
of minutes for the appropriate year and month given in the following table :—

H«ndy Rule to Find Sidereal Time— continued.
previous vernal equinox bears to a year. This relation between the fraction of
a day and a year is easily ascertained, as their subdivisions bear a very simple
relation to each other, there being 12 months in a year, and 24 hours in a day;
there are also 60 minutes in an hour, and (about) 30 days in a month. Thus
Sidereal time can be ascertained approximately by a short mental calculation
according to the following rule: —Substract 3 months and 22 days from the
date (increased by 12 months if needful). Call each month of difference 2 hours
and each day 4 minutes. Example : To find Sidereal time when it is noon on
August 30th. August 30th is 8 months and 30 days, substracting 3 months 22
days leaves 5 months 8 days, allow 2 hours for each of the 5 months and 4
minutes for each of the 8 days= 10 hours 32 min. To find Sidereal time at
noon on February isth=2 months 15 days, add 12 months =l4 months 15
days - 3 months 22 days =lO months 23 days== 21 hours 32 minutes Sidereal
time.

To Reduce Longlmde into Time.
Rule -Divide the number of degrees, minutes, and seconds by 15, and the
quotient will be the time. If longitude is W. of Greenwich, the result will be
the time at Greenwich when it is noon at the place. Example : Longitude
74 0 48' 15'' W. What is the time ? Divide by 15 =4h.59m. 13 s. slower than
Greenwich.
(2) To find difference in time between two places divide the difference in
Longitude by 15. Paris, Longitude 2° 20' E.; Philadelphia, Longitude 75 0 10'
W. Difference in Longitude 77 0 30' divided by 15 =5h.10 m. difference in
time.
(3) To find difference in Longitude (e.g., distance sailed) when difference in
time is known, multiply the difference in time by 15.
Weather Wisdom.
Contributed by Frederic Gaster, F.R.Met.Soc. ofthe Meteorological Office.
WEATHER Signs are of two kinds —General and Local. The former depend on observa-
tions made at many stations, covering a large area; the latter on observations made at one
spot. The former are undoubtedly the more valuable, and throw great light on the latter;
vice versd, the “ local ’ are often valuable aids to the “ general ” indications. The general indi-
cations are obtainable by studying the daily weather charts now published by the Meteoro-
logical Office, as well as in the Times, and some other papers.

“ Cyclones” “Depressions,” or definite areas of low barometer, are areas of strong winds,
rough, unsettled weather, with relatively high temperature in winter, low in summer.
“Anti-cyclones,” or definite areas of high barometer, are areas of light airs and calms, dry,
foggy, or hazy weather, warm in summer, cold in winter.
“ Ridges ” are offshoots from anti-cyclones, separating one depression from another.
“ Hollows ” are offshoots from depressions, separating anti-cyclonic systems.
All winds are either cyclonic or anti-cyclonic : if the former, they circulate spirally round the
area of lowest barometer, in a direction “against the sun ”; if the latter, they are drawn
outwards from the centre, and circulate with the sun.
The approach or departure of such systems can be watched by consulting the weather
maps and consulting the changes of barometer and wind locally. Very sudden clearances or
sky in rear of a depression, accompanied by sharp fall of temperature and rapid drying up,
usually portend speedy recurrence of rough weather.
Local indications,
Raptd movement of barometer—rising or falling—shows unreliable condition of weather, and
consequent liability to sudden changes.
Steady rise after southerly winds shows Improving tendency, with wind from W. or N.W.
Steady fall after northerly winds shows bad tendency, and wind probably shifting
southwards.
CLOUDS.—Chief types are—(i) Cirri/orm clouds (mares’ tails), the highest form of cloud
known, consisting of ice particles, producing halos, mock suns and moons. (2) Stratus , or sheet
clouds, found at various heights, sometimes in continuous sheets, sometimes in rounded, detached
portions, sometimes as ragged patches (scud), the source of coronae (coloured rings, close to
moon or sun) and simple burrs; when complex, forming the Nimbus or continuous rain-cloud.
(3) Cumulus , rising in heaps from horizontal base; usually fair-weather clouds when small,
and especially if decreasing towards night, but showery when large and piled up, especially
when breaking into cirriforra shape at summit; when very large and ragged at top they cause
local thunderstorms. NOTES
After sudden clearing of sky in rear of southerly to westerly gales, the appearance of Cirrus
in the W., moving from N.W., is almost certain indication of new storm.
In summer, with a freshening easterly breeze, the appearance of Cirrus coming from
southwards indicates thunderstorms advancing from southwards.
Dry fog shows quiet, settled weather; visibility, unsettled weather. Halos usually show
rough weather (found in Cirrus of advancing depression).
CLOUD Colours.—“ Red sky at night is the shepherd’s delight.
Red sky in morning is sailor’s forewarning.
Pale, sickly sunshine usually portends more rain.

Table ihowing 1 the Biitancei One can See
The earth being round, its convexity limits the vision even on a level like the
sea. The line of vision on the sea-shore for a man of ordinary height, say six
feet (see table), would be intercepted by the horizon at a distance of 3.24 miles.
If he were looking at an object 45 feet in height, say a flag on a mast-head, the
flag would seem to be on the horizon if it were 12.11 miles distant. In this case
add the distances due to the two heights as found in the table, viz., 3.24 (for
6 ft.) +8.87 (for 45 ft.) = 12.11 miles. A carrier-pigeon at a mile above the
earth would only command a field of 96 miles in radius.

Unman Life.
According to a French statistician, taking the mean of many accounts, a
man of 50 years of age has slept 6,000 days, worked 6,500 days, walked
800 days, amused himself 4,000 days, was eating 1,500 days, was sick 500 days,
etc. He has eaten 17,000 pounds of bread, 16,000 pounds of meat, 4,600
pounds of vegetables, eggs and fish, and drunk, in all, 7,000 gallons of liquid,
namely, water, tea, coffee, beer, wine, etc.
Hhe latiom that Hat Motit.
Among modem nations, the greatest eaters are the English, Germans,
French, and the Americans —the ruling people of our civilisation. The diet
of the Spaniards and the Italians is notably less substantial than that of the
English and Germans, just as their brains are less active and original.
The Americans are, on the average, the greatest eaters in the world. Said
Carlyle to Emerson : “ The best thing I know of that country is, that in it a
man can have meat for his labour.”
Esting, Drinking-, and Neither,
A horse will live 25 days without solid food, merely drinking water; 17 days
without either eating or drinking; and only s days when eating solid food
without drinking.

Many species ot plants live only one or two years, i.e., are annuals or
biennials.
Many species indicate their age—the spruce producing a new set of
branches every year ; several kinds of palm making rings exhibited externally
on the rind, each ring denoting one year; the oak when cut horizontally
presenting a series of concentric circles, each marking one year’s growth.
Certain Brazilian cocoa-nut palms live 600 to 700 years. The date palm is
said by the Arabs to live 200 to 300 years.
Wallan’s Oak, at Ellersiey, near Paisley, is more than 700 years old.
Eight olive trees on Mount of Olives, Jerusalem, are known to have existed
in 1099, 800 years ago.
At Ankerwyke House, near Staines, is a yew dating from before 1215, i.e.,
more than 685 years ago.
The yews at Fountain s Abbey, Yorkshire, were old trees when the Abbey was
built in 1132.
The Sequoia Gigantea, in the Mariposa Grove of California, 90 ft. in circum-
ference and more than 300 ft. high, is certainly of greater age than are the
yews at Fountains Abbey.
Adanson computes the age of certain Baobab trees in Africa at more than
5000 years.
De Candolle reckons the deciduous Cypress, at Chapultepec, to be of still
greater age.
Humboldt sets down the Draccena Draco, at Orotava, in Teneriffe, as one ot
the oldest inhabitants of the earth.
longevity ot Animals,
Insects live some only a few hours, others for weeks. The toad lives about
15 years.
Carp.— Buffon speaks ot carps in the pond of Count de Maurepas, at
Pontchartrain, proved to be more than 150 years old.
A pike caught in a lake near Heilbronn, in 1497, showed by a brass ring
attached to it that it had been placed in the lake in 1230.
River trout have lived confined in wells 30 to 50 years.
Domestic fowls and other gallinaceous animals live 12 to 15 years.
Parrots. —The Grand Duchess D’Urbino, when, in 1633, she came to
Florence to marry the Grand Duke Ferdinand, brought with her a paroquet
“ the oldest member of her family.” It lived in Florence nearly a century
longer.

Peter Czartan, a Hungarian peasant, is recorded to have been born 1539,
and to have died 1724, i.e., he lived 185 years.

Remarkable Instance of Human Fertility.
In 1818, in Mercer Co., Philadelphia, 10 children were bom of one mother
within 12 months —J at each of two births. The mother died about a year after
the second birth, but meantime gave birth to twins, thus producing rz children
in 20 months. She was 37 years old at her death.
The Period* of treitstloD.
The period of gestation is shorter in carnivorous than in herbivorous animals.
The young of the former are also less developed at birth, their eyes not
opening for several days thereafter. Herbivorous animals: —The elephant
has 24 months’ gestation; the giraffe, 14 months; dromedary, 12 months;;
buffalo, 10 months ; ass, 13 months; mare, upwards of 11 months; rhinoceros,
9 months ; cow, 9 months ; many of the larger deer, over 8 months; sheep and
goat, 5 months; pig, 4 months. Rodents:—Beaver, 4 months; dormouse,
31 days; rabbit, 30 to 31 days; squirrel and rat, 28 days ; guinea-pig, 21 days
or less. Carnivorous : —Bear, 6 months; lion, 108 days ; puma, 79 days ; fox,
wolf, and dog, 62-63 days; cats, 55 or 36 days. Pouched Animals Kan-
garoo, 39 days; opossum, 26 days. Cetaceous Animals :—Greenland whale,
about 10 months. The most common duration for the varieties of monkeys is
7 months. Oviparous Animals:—The goose sits 30 days; swan, 42 days;
hens, 2i days; ducks, 30 days; pea-hens and turkeys, 28 days; canaries,
14 days ; pigeons, 2r days ; parrots, 40 days.
The periods are subject to considerable variation, especially in domestic
animals, and various conditions modify the period, of which the above are
only the averages.
Feciindity «t Animals.
The elephant, camel, and horse very seldom produce more than one at a
time ; the lion, x, oftener 2 or 3, sometimes 5, or more. The fecundity of the
domestic rabbit is marvellous. It begins to breed at six months, and has
7 litters a-year, each of from 4to 12, or upwards. It is calculated that the
descendants of a single pair of rabbits, if allowed full scope, would, in four
years, amount to over ij millions. The rabbit, introduced into Australia, has
now overrun that continent to such excess as to demand special legislation for
its suppression. Some 2,000 men are employed in New South Wales alone in
the destruction of this rodent. Since 1870 Victoria has voted considerably
over £lOO,OOO for the destruction of the rabbit, and high prizes are offered for
a recipe for its extirpation.

Trajan’s Bridge over the Danube, 4,500 feet in length, built a.d. 115
London Bridge. One existedat the end of the 10th century. One
built of wood, 1014. A stone bridge, by Peter of Colechurch, begun 1176, was
finished 1209. The present bridge is of granite, from the designs of J. Rennie;
commenced in 1824, and completed in about seven years, at a cost of £1,458,000.
The Bridge at Burton over (he Trent, formerly the longest
bridge in England, being 1,545 feet. Now partly removed. Built in 12th century.
The Bridge of tlie Holy Trinity, at Florence, was built in 1569.
It is 322 feet long, constructed of white marble, and stands unrivalled as a
work of art.
The Bialto, at Venice, said to have been built from the designs of Michael
Angelo. It is a single marble arch, 74 feet span, and was completed in 1591.
The Bridge ol Sig Tis, at Venice, over which condemned prisoners were

Tile Bartholdi Statue of liberty.
M. Bartholdi’s figure of Liberty stands, without reckoning the diadem, 105
feet high ; but the extreme height from the feet to the upper end of the torch
held by the outstretched hand is 137 feet 9 inches. The statue is placed on a
granite pedestal 83 feet high. To those who like to be told that the letters in
the inscription, “ I'u es Petrus,” running round the interior of the drum of the
dome of St. Peter’s at Rome, are as tall as a Life Guardsman, and that the
pen held by the Apostle St. Luke in one of the spandrils of the dome is ix
feet long, it may be interesting to learn that a person six feet in height, stand-
ing on the lips of M. Bartholdi’s head of Liberty, can only just reach the
eyebrow ; that people can jump with ease in and out the tip of the nose; and
that the eyes measure six feet from corner to corner.

A bricklayer can lay about 1,500 or 1,600 bricks in a day of 10 hours, where
the joints are left rough; about 1,000 per day when both faces have to be
worked fair, and not more than 500 a day when carefully jointed, and faced
with picked bricks of a uniform colour.
A cubic yard of rubble masonry will, as a rule, require i cubic yard of
mortar, and 1$ cubic yard of stone in heap.
According to experiments made by Tredgold, the adhesive force cf fresh-
made glue, cementing together two pieces of dry ash, after being left for
twenty-four hours, was found to be 715 pounds to the square inch.
Ordinary London bricks are called 9" X 4J" X 2}", though as a rule they
only run 8J" X 4i X aj".
It requires 1 cubic yard of clay to make 469 bricks.
1.000 stock bricks stacked = 56 cubic feet.
1.000 old bricks cleaned and stacked = 70 cubic feet.
306 cubic feet, or 11 yards g feet = 1 rod of brickwork.
272 feet superficial = x rod of brickwork in walls xj brick thick.
408 feet superficial = x rod of brickwork in walls 1 brick thick, called in
London the standard thickness, to which all brickwork, of whatever thickness,
is reduced.
4,350 stock bricks to 1 rod reduced, 4 courses 1 foot high.
A rod of brickwork requires 1} cubic yard of chalk lime, and 3 single loads
or yards of road drift or sand, or 1 cubic yard of stoae lime, and 3J yards of
sand; or 36 bushels of cement, and 36 bushels of sharp sand.
A rod of brickwork containing 235 cubic feet of brick, with 71 cubic feet of
mortar, will, upon an average, weigh 15 tons.
16 bricks to 1 foot of reduced brickwork.
7 bricks to 1 foot of superficial facing.
Plain Tiles.—A square of 100 feet superficial will require, if laid to an 8-inch
gauge, 600 plain tiles, 1 bundle of laths, 1 lb. of 4d. nails, 1 peck of tile pins,
and 3 hods of lime and hair mortar.
4,300 stocks, or 4,500 place bricks, are sufficient for a rod of reduced brick-
work, which will require about 180 hods of mortar.
A load of mortar = 27 cubic feet, and requires 9 bushels of lime and 1 yard
of sand.
A bricklayer’s hod will hold 20 bricks; the ordinary load, however, is 16
walling, or 12 facing bricks, or nearly 5 a bushel of mortar.
One square yard of paving requires 32 paving bricks laid flat; each brick
9X4J X if will weigh 4 lbs each; or 84 paving bricks laid on edge.
Planks are 11 inches wide, deals 9 inches, and battens 7 inches.
100 feet superficial is 1 square.
12 —12 feet boards, 9 inches wide, laid rough = 1 square.
16 —12 feet battens, 7 inches wide, laid rough = 1 square.

Steel wire rope is at least twice as strong and a little heavier than iron rope.
The strength of chain varies as the square of the diameter of the iron in the
link.
Hempen ropes deteriorate after a few months’wear, though apparently good
on careful examination by the eye. With the best ropes not more than six
months in use, the loss was equal to 25 per cent.
EM&CTB.
Receipt* for Homekeepen.
Ants, Red. —Sprigs of winter-green or ground ivy will drive away red ants.
Branches of wormwood will serve the same purpose for black ants. The
insects may be kept out of sugar-barrels by drawing a wide chalk-mark around
the top, near the edge.
Biliousness. —For biliousness, squeeze the juice of a lime or small lemon
into half a glass of cold water, then stir in a little baking-soda and drink while
it foams. This receipt will also relieve sick headache if taken at the beginning.
Bites and Stings of Insects.— Wash with a solution of ammonia water.
Bites of Mad Dogs.—Apply caustic potash at once to the wound, and give
enough whiskey to cause sleep.
Boots. —To make leather boots waterproof, saturate them with castor-oil;
to stop squeaking, drive a peg into the middle of the sole.
Bottle-Cleaning. —Bottles are easily cleaned with hot water and fine coals.
Burns. —Make a paste of common baking soda and water, and apply it
promptly to the burn. It will quickly check the pain and inflammation.
Charcoal. —lt is well to keep large pieces of charcoal in damp comers and
in dark places.
Chimney on Fire. —Throw salt or a handful of sulphur in the grate.
Cleaning Lamp-Chimneys. —Newspapers are the best thing for cleaning
lamp-chimneys. When filling the lamp, drop the least kerosene on a piece,
then rub the cnimney till it shines.
Clinkers. —To remove clinkers from stoves or fire-brick, put in about half-
a-peck of oyster shells on top of a bright fire. Repeat if needful.
Cold on Chest. —A flannel rag wrung out in boiling water and sprinkled
with turpentine, laid on the chest, gives the greatest relief.
Colours Faded. —Hartshorn will usually restore colours that have been
taken out by acid.
Cough.— Boil one ounce of flaxseed in a pint of water, strain, and add a
little honey, one ounce of rock candy, and the juice of three lemons. Mix
and boil well. Drink as hot as possible.
Cuts.—A drop or two of creosote on a cut will stop its bleeding.
Disinfectant. —Chloride of lime should be scattered at least once a week
under sinks and wherever sewer gas is likely to penetrate.


Receipt! for Honwkeepen— continued.
Flibs.—2o drops of carbolic acid evaporated from a hot shovel will go far to
banish flies from a room, while a bit of camphor gum, the size of a walnut,
held over a lamp until consumed, will do the same for the mosquito.
Furniture, to Clean. —First rub with cotton waste, dipped in boiled
linseed oil; then rub clean and dry with a soft flannel cloth. Care should be
taken that the oil is all removed.
Gilt Frames. —To restore gilt frames, rub with a sponge moistened in
turpentine.
Grease Spots. —To remove grease spots, thoroughly saturate with turpen-
tine, place a soft blotting-paper beneath, and another on top of the spot, and
press it hard.* The fat is dissolved, then absorbed by the paper, and entirely
removed from the cloth.
Hair.—To clean hair, wash well with a mixture ot soft water, i pint; sal-
soda, i ounce; cream tartar, J ounce.
Iron Rust.—To remove from muslin or white goods, thoroughly saturate
the spots with lemon juice and salt, and expose to the sun. Usually more
than one application is required. A good way to prevent its appearance on
clothes is, when washing, to always have them enclosed in a muslin bag
while being boiled.
Moths. —Thoroughly beat furs and woollens before putting away. Put
them in a paper bag and fasten up tight. If there are no moths or eggs inside
the bag the furs will be safe.
Paint. —Chloroform will remove paint. When the colour of a fabric has
been destroyed by an acid, ammonia is applied to neutralise the same; after
which an application of chloroform will, in almost all cases, restore the
original colour.
Pile of Plush or Velvet. —To raise the pile of plush or velvet, dampen
on the wrong side with clean cold water, then hold tight across the face of a
hot iron, and rub up the compressed part with a clean stiff brush.
Polishing Flat-irons. —Black flat-irons, when rusty, with stove-polish,‘and
rub well with a dry brush.
Polishing Stoves. —For polishing heating stoves, hardware dealers use tur-
pentine and black varnish. Properly put on, it will last throughout a season.
Rats. —Chloride of lime is an infallible preventive against rats, as they flee
from its odour as from a pestilence.
Screw. —To remove an obdurate screw, apply a red-hot iron to the head for
a short time, the screw-driver being applied immediately while the screw is hot.
Silverware. —Silverware can be kept bright for months if placed with a
largish piece of camphor in an air-tight case.
To prevent articles of silverware from tarnishing, first warm them, and
then paint them over with a thin solution of collodion in alcohol, using a wide
soft brush for the purpose.
Smell of Onions. —Rub the hands on a stick of celery after peeling onions,
and the smell will be entirely removed.
Sorb Throat. —Cut slices of fat boneless bacon, pepper thickly, and tie
around the throat with a flannel cloth.
Stains. —To remove stains of ink, wash carefully with pure water, and apply
oxalic acid. If the latter changes the dye to a red tinge, restore the colour
with ammonia.


Receipt# for Monsekeepeira— continued.
Stains. —To take out ink or iron-mould stains from white goods, wet with
milk and cover with salt.
To remove egg stains from spoons, rub with common salt.
Butter milk will take out mildew stains.
To remove the stains of acid fruit from the hands, wash your hands in
clean water, dry slightly, and while they are yet moist strike a match and hold
your hands around the flame.
For stains on the hands nothing is better than salL with enough lemon
juice to moisten it, rubbed on the spots and then rinse off with clean water.
Starch.—To prevent starch from souring when boiled, add a little sulphate
of copper.
Washing.—Three teaspoonfuls of kerosene put in the wash boiler will
greatly assist in the last rubbing.
Mew to Remove Vig'ht Mnger Ring-*,
Pass the end of a piece of fine twine underneath the ring, and wind it evenly
around the finger upward as far as the middle joint. Then take hold of the
lower end of the string beneath the ring, and begin to slowly unwind upward,
when the ring will gradually move along the twine toward the tip of the finger
and come off)
The Umbrella.
For many centuries the umbrella had been in common use in China and
Japan before it was introduced into European countries. About 150 years
ago it was introduced into London by Jonas Hanway, a benevolent and
eccentric old gentleman. When he first raised his umbrella, on a rainy day,
he found it of unexpected use in keeping off a shower of sticks and stones, with
which the street-boys pelted him. For a long while it was considered effemi-
nate and ridiculous to use an umbrella.
Chemiitry of Cookery.
Matthieu Williams, in his admirable book with the above title, gives the
reason, based on scientific experiments, for a number of rules to be followed
by all cooks. In boiling meat or fish, place them in boiling water for sor 10
minutes to coagulate the albumen on the surface and imprison the juices; the
remainder of the cooking should be in water at 180° to 199° Fahr. —just below
simmering (boiling) point. Eggs should be cooked 8 or 10 minutes in hot
water, not hot enough to boil (or placed in boiling water that is then allowed
to cool). In frying fish or meat, use enough fat or oil to nearly cover them
and allow it to simmer. Boil all milk before using. In grilling, better burn
the chop with too brisk a fire than dry it up with too slow a one, la roasting
meat in an oven, use a dish with double bottom, or one dish within another,
the bottom one to contain water: the evaporation of the water prevents the
drying up of the roast; frequent basting accomplishes the same end. Water
that boils violently is no hotter than that boiling very quietly. 3 pounds of
potatoes are about equal to lof bread in food value. Bread should be baked
at from 280° Fahr. to 230° Fahr.; beef and mutton, at from 240° Fahr. to 220°
Fahr.; pork and veal, from 250® Fahr. to 230® Fahr.; and puff pastry at 300°
Fahr.

Alow to Read

exclusively by meter, and its index, or

few householders yet know how to read
30 years, at least, gas has been burnt
: dial, is as easy to read as is the dial of
The figures on the index at the right hand denote even hundreds. When
the hand completes the entire circle it denotes ten hundred, and is registered
by the hand in the centre circle pointing to one —the interval between any
one figure and the next, in centre circle, measuring one thousand. The entire
round of centre circle measures ten thousand, and is registered on the index of
the left-hand circle, in which the interval between any two successive figures
counts ten thousand. It must be understood that the hands of all three circles
are always in simultaneous movement, and that the hand of the left-hand circle,


ll«sw te R«a«l ths 43 a« JHotGT-—continued.
at any point between two figures, indicates the consumption also of so much
fraction of ten thousand — i.e., so mu y thousands and so many hundreds as
are indicated by the mid and right-hand circles respectively.
The quantity of gas which has passed through the meter since last date is
ascertained by reading from the indexes the total amount registered, and
deducting therefrom the quantity shown by the indexes at a previous observa-
tion.
The total registered by the hands on the three circles above, is ... 49,900
Amount at previous observation, as shown by the dotted lines ... 42,500
It will be noticed that the hand on the left-hand circle is just at the margin,
but not yet at the centre, of the “ 5.” When another “ 100” of the gas meter
is consumed, the hand of the left-hand circle will point exactly at “ of
mid-circle exactly at “o,” and of right-hand circle exactly at “o,” —indicating
50,000 cubic feet.
The register at all times shows the quantity that has passed through since
the meter was first set, and deducting therefrom the amount that has been
paid for (without any regard to the time when), we obtain the amount remain-
ing unpaid.

are alike, and the sum of the units is ten, e.g., 46 X 44 or 97 X 93 —multiply the
units together—add one to one of the tens, and multiply, e.g. :—
9,021


Arithmetical Klulec, etc.—^ continue*.
3. When the multiplier is 3 figures, 2 of which can be evenly divided by the
3rd, then only two partial multiplications need be used, greatly simplifying
the process—thus to multiply 47,123 by 328, and by 832 :
47.123 47,123
328 832
376,984 376,984
*,5°7,936 i,5°7,936
i 5,45 6 .344 39,206,336
we first multiply by 8 in each case, and tben multiply that product by 4 (which
is equivalent to multiplying the original number by 32). In multiplying by 8
in each case, we put the first figure of the product under the 8, and in multiply-
ing by 4 (32) place the first figure of the product under the 2 of the 32.
4. Any number is divisible by 2 or 5, if the last figure is divisible by 2 or 5 ;
it is divisible by 4 or 25, if the last 2 figures are divisible by 4 or 25; it is
divisible by 8 or 125, if the last 3 figures are divisible by 8 or 125.
5. Any number is divisible by 3 or by 9, if the sum of its figures is divisible
by 3 or by 9.
6. The decimals equivalent to one seventh, two sevenths, three sevenths, four
sevenths, five sevenths, and six sevenths, each contain the same series of
figures, and are respectively, .142857, .285714, .428571, .571428, .714285, and
.857142.
7. To multiply by 5, add one o, and divide by 2; to multiply by 15 do the
same, and then add quotient to dividend. To multiply by 25 add 2 o’s, and
divide, by 4. To multiply by 75, do the same, and then subtract the quotient
from the dividend.
8. To find the price of oz. avoirdupois when the price per pound in shillings
is known. Deduct one fourth from the price in shillings, and it gives the price
in pence per ounce.
9. To find approximately the price per pound when price per cwt. is given in
shillings. Divide the price per cwt. in shillings by 9, and it will give the price
in pence per lb.
10. To find price in pence per lb. when price per ton in £ is given. Divide
the price in £ by 0, and it gives the price per lb. in pence nearly exact.
11. To find the price of a number of articles as 120, when the price of one is
given, it is easier when the price is an aliquot part of a pound, a shilling, or a
penny, to divide and obtain the result in pounds, shillings, and pence—thus 120
articles at ios.= (J £) ; 6s. Brf.=(J £); M.=(i £); 4*-=(f £) ; 3*- 4<*-‘= (i £) ;
is. Brf.— £) is found by dividing 120 by 2,3, 4,5, 6, and 12 respectively.

1. If you have only a 5 -gallon measure, a 3-gallon measure, and an 8-gallon
measure, the last being full of wine, how can you measure out with these
exactly 4 gallons of the wine ?
2. A Bedouin dies, leaving by will 17 horses to his 3 sons. To the eldest he
leaves one-half his horses, to the next one-third, and to the youngest one-ninth.
A dispute arising as to how the will can be carried out, without sacrificing one
of the horses, the matter is referred to a Dervish, who puts his own horse with
the 17, then gives the half of 18 to one son, one-third to another, and one-ninth
to the last, and tben takes his own horse again.

5. Ten travellers come to an inn, and demand each a single room. The
host says, “I have only 9 rooms, but I think I can manage it in this way. Will
you,” addressing one of the travellers, “wait here until I have placed your
friends, and then I will come back for you ? ” He then puts the 2nd traveller
in the Ist room, the 3rd in the 2nd room, the 4th in the 3rd, the sth in the 4th,
the 6th in the sth, the 7th in the 6th, the Bth in the 7th, the oth in the Bth, and
then returns for the last man, and puts him in the 9th room.
6. Arrange 5 numbers, none of which are greater than xo, so that when read
from left to right, the one on the right will always be nearer to 10 than the
preceding one, and the Ist number will be nearer to xo than the sth
7. A lady sent a diamond cross to a jeweller to be repaired. She noted
that the number of diamonds, counting from the bottom of the cross to the
top or from the bottom to the end of each cross piece, was 9. The jeweller
retained 2 diamonds, but the number counted in the same manner was still 9.
8. A board one inch in thickness is 15 inches long and 9 inches wide. Saw

it. Can a moving body reverse the direction ot its motion without first
coming to a rest ? Example: If a rifle ball moving due east is met by a
cannon ball moving due west, and is carried back with the cannon ball, the
direction of its motion is reversed, and it has not first come to rest.
12. A visitor passing through a jail said to one of the prisoners, “Brothers

14. A man has a fox, a goose, and some com, and wishes to take them across
the river in a boat. He can only take one of them at a time in the boat, and
he cannot, for obvious reasons, leave the fox and the goose together, or the
goose and the corn together. How does he manage it ?
15. A boy on entering a room is told, “My son, bring me my boots.” The
boy replies, “ It is true I am your son, but you are not my father, and, until
you tell me how this can be so, I won’t bring you the boots.”
16. Take any number less than 10 —double it and add 4 to the doubling;
then multiply this sum by 5 : to the product add 12 and multiply by 10. From
this total deduct 320. If from this remainder you cut off the last two figures
the number that remains will be the one first chosen.


Peculiar PropcrtlM of the Humber 3?
The number 37 is one which, being multiplied by each of the figures of
arithmetical progression, 3,6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, all the products which
result from it are composed of three repetitions of the same figure; and the
sum of these figures is equal to that by which you multiplied the 37,

Magic Square.
Arrange the numbers from 1 to 16 in a square, so that the sum of the figures
in any row, vertical, horizontal, or oblique, will be equal to 34. According to
M. Frenicle, whose work on magic squares was published in 1698, there are
20,922,789,888,000 possible arrangements of the figures 1 to 16 in a square, and
880 arrangements that will form a magic square. Below is one out of the 880:
In this arrangement not only does each row, each
column, and each diagonal give a total of 34, but any
four adjacent numbers in the form of a square, and
any four numbers forming the corners of a square of
nine, have the same sum. Moreover, these propeities
are not disturbed by taking a column from one side
and adding it on the other side of the square, or by
placing the top row at the bottom.
The Fifteen Puzzle.
Apparently simple, this game is really difficult of solution. Fifteen cubes of
wood, severally marked from 1 to 15, are placed indifferently in a box made to
hold sixteen; thus—
Curiosities in Figßrsi,
The puzzle consists in sliding the cubes from square to square, without lifting
them or removing them from the box, until they are placed in their natural
order. It is easy enough to move the squares up to 12; but to get the last
three into order is often a puzzle indeed.
A very curious number is 142,857, which, multiplied by 2,3, 4, 5 or 6, gives
the same figures in the same order, beginning at a different point; but if
multiplied by 7 gives all nines: Multiplied by 2it equals 285,714, multiplied


Curiosities in Figures— continued.
by 3 equals 428,571, multiplied by 4 equals 571,428, multiplied by 5 equals
714,285, multiplied by 6 equals 857,142, multiplied by 7 equals 999,9(59.
Multiply 142,857 by 8 and you have 1,142,856. Then add the first figure to the
last and you have 142,857, the original number, the figures exactly the same
as at the start.
When any number is a multiple of 3 or 9 the figures of which it is
composed will also be a multiple of 3 or 9: thus 142,857 = 15,873 X 9, and
the sum of 1,4, 2,8, 5, and 7 is 27, = 3 X 9.
Again, when any numjer is a multiple of xx, the alternate figures of which
it is composed, when added together, will either give the same total or will
differ by a multiple of 11; thus 142,857 = 12,987 x ix, and the sum of x, 2,
and 5 is 8, the sum of 4,8, and 7 is xg difference 11.
A number which is equal to the sum of all its aliquot parts is called a
Perfect Number; as 28 =l+2+ 4 + 7 + 14. The first four Perfect
Numbers are 6, 28, 456, and 8,128.
When two numbers are so related that each of them is equal to the sum of
the aliquot parts of the other, they
instance, 284 is equal toi + 2 + 4 + 5
and 220 is equal to 1 + 2 + 4 +7l+ 1
are called Amicable Numbers; for
+ 10 + xx +20+22 + 44 + 55 + xxo,

COMMERCIAL.
Safe Business Rules.
Business men, in business hours, attend only to business matters. Social
calls are best adapted to the social circle. Make your business known in few
words, without loss of time. Let your dealings with a stranger be most
carefully considered, and tried friendship duly appreciated. A mean act will
soon recoil, and a man of honour will be esteemed. Leave “ tricks of trade ”
to those whose education was never completed. Treat all with respect,
confide in few, wrong no man. Be never afraid to say no, and always prompt
to acknowledge and rectify a wrong. Leave nothing for to-morrow that
should be done to-day. Because a friend is polite, do not think that his time
is valueless. Have a place for everything, and everything in its place. To
preserve long friendship, keep a short credit; the way to get credit is to be
punctual; the way to preserve it is not to use it much. Settle often ; have
short accounts. Trust no man’s appearances; they are often deceptive, and
assumed for the purpose of obtaining credit. Rogues generally dress well.
The rich are generally plain men. Be well satisfied before you give a credit
that those to whom you give it are men to be trusted. Attend to your own
business and not your neighbour’s.
Roney.
Money is the article or articles agreed upon as a common denomination oi
value, in terms of which all commodities may be expressed, with a commen-
surate amount of which any commodity may be purchased, for a commensurate
amount of which any commodity may be sold. Before money was invented
barter was the only mode of commerce, find down to the present day the
aboriginal Australians will carry stone for making hatchets hundreds of
miles in order to exchange it for red-ochre. Amongst more primitive forms
of money are skins, haigua shells (among the Indians of British Columbia),
cowries (in India), whales’ teeth (among the Fijians), red feathers (among
some South Sea Islanders), salt (in Abyssinia and Mexico), etc., etc.
Mortgagei
In England, according to Lord Reay, the landed properties are mortgaged
for 58 per cent, of their value; in 1866 the estimate was only 33 per cent.
Farm mortgages in the United States of America, are favourite forms of
investment with Insurance Companies and Savings Banks, and are intro-
duced in England by large mortgage trust companies ; the loans effected are
usually for one-third or four-tenths the value of the land. In France the
mortgages rose from 505 millions in 1840 to 771 millions in 1877. In Prussia
the land mortgages in 1869 were 51 per cent, of the value of the lands, and
the house property of Berlin was mortgaged for 68 per cent. The mortgages
held by the Imperial Bank of Russia reach 148 millions sterling. In Austria
new mortgages average £11,000.000 per annum. In Italy the mortgages rose
from 353 millions sterling in 1862 to 553 millions in 1870. In Holland the latest
return of mortgages (1869) showed 251,000 estates mortgaged for millions
sterling. In Spain the registry of mortgages averages 8J millions sterling,
and £172 per estate mortgaged. In New Zealand new mortgages average
9 millior s sterling per annum, and £BlO per estate mortgaged; releases average
3 millions sterling. In Egypt the new mortgages registered from 1878 to 1883
amounted to 6| millions.


J3TOTEB,
A PROMISSORY NOTE Is a written
piomise to pay a definite sum at a definite
time for value received. It should be d \ted,
and is usually made payable at definite place,
as a bank. (See Form 1.) In Scotch and Irish
notes, add the word sterling after the sum.
If a Promissory Note is made by two or
more makers they are liable thereon jointly,
or jointly and severally, according to its
tenor. But if the note is worded: “I
promise to pay,” and is signed by two or
more persons, “it is deemed to be their joint
and several note.”
A Bill of Exchange Is a written order
by one person (the drawer) upon another
person or firm (the drawees) to pay at a
definite time a definite sum of money. If
this order is accepted by the drawee, the
bill then becomes valuable, and must be
paid first by the drawee (acceptor), and
second (if the Bill has been protested for
non-payment by the acceptor) by the en
dorsers or drawer. (See Form 2). Foreign
Bills of Exchange are usually drawn in
duplicate or triplicate, to avoid loss in
transmission by post, but the one first pre-
sented is alone accepted. {See Form 3.)
Notes and Bills, unless payable “ at sight ”
or “on demand,” have (in England) *3 days
of grace added to the time they are due;
thus,if due 60 days afterdate, will h& payable
63 days after date. Bills drawn on foreign
cities are often drawn “at usance,” i.e. tor
the length of time after sight allowed by the
law of the place. The days of grace also
vary in foreign countries. (See Usance and
Days of Grace.)
A bill payable “at sight” or a draft or
cheque must either be drawn on paper bear-
ing an impressed stamp, or must be signed
across an adhesive stamp, for one penny. A
bill payable at any interval “after date ” or
“after sight ” must be drawn on paper im-
pressed with a stamp varying according to
the amount of the bill. A foreign bill must
bear a suitable adhesive stamp cancelled by
signature and date.
“ When a bill contains words prohibiting
transfer, or indicating an intention that it
should not be transferable, it is valid as
between the parties thereto, but is not nego-
tiable.” If a bill is not paid on presentation
at maturity it is advisable—in the case of a
foreign bill it is requisite—to have it “ noted ”
the same day, as the holder will delay it at his
own risk. If there is no notary available a
householder is allowed to protest the bill under
certain regulations, which will be found in the
Bills of Exchange Act, Sec. 94 and Schedule.
A bill drawn in one of the Colonies is
treated as a foreign bill.
A CHEQUE is a written order on a bank to
pay on demand a sum of money. If pay-
able to “ or bearer fand not
BJCIiJLS, SS'tC;
crossed) It can be collected by anyone; if to
“ or order ” (and not crossed) it can
be collected at the bank only when endorsed
by , to whom it is payable. A
cheque which has been crossed can not be
collected except by another bank. If the
name of any particular bank be written
between the cross lines Instead of “
& Co.” (as in Form 4), then It can only be
collected by that particular bank, and must
be paid into that bank for collection.
If a cheque has nor been crossed by the
drawer the holder is at liberty to cross it
either “ & C 0.,” or with the name of his
own banker. He may also add “not nego-
tiable.” “Where a person takes a cross
cheque which bears on it the words * not
negotiable,’ he shall not have and shall not
be capable of giving a better title to the
cheque than that which the person from
whom he took it had.”
Endorsements.—The person to whom
a promissory note, bill, or cheque Is payable,
can assign it to anyone by simply signing his
name on the back. If he writes above such
endorsement, “ Pay to the order of John
Jones, Esq.,” It becomes payable to John
Jones only, John Jones In such case can
make it payable to a third party by himself
endorsing it.
Usance and Days of Grace.
USANCE Is the usual term of Bills of
Exchange drawn from one country upon
another, and varies in different places. A
bill drawn “ at usance ” is for the customary
time at the place where it is payable. ( at
two usances” twice that time, Ac. In
France, Belgium, and Holland it is fixed by
law at 30 days; in Spain it is 60 days for
bills drawn in England and the principal
European Countries, 90 days in other cases.
The rate of exchange is quoted for
Amsterdam and Paris at sight, and at the
usance of 3 months in the case of Amsterdam,
Antwerp, Barcelona, Basle, Berlin, Bilbao,
Brussels, Cadiz, Christiania, Copenhagen,
Frankfort, Genoa, Granada, Hamburg,
Leghorn, Leipsic, Madrid, Malaga, Mar-
seilles, Messina, Milan, Naples, Palermo,
Paris, Rotterdam, Santander, St. Petersburg,
Seville, Stockholm, Trieste, Venice, Vienna,
Zaragoza, and Zurich. Bills on Lisbon are
at 90 days ; Calcutta and Bombay, 30 days ;
Adelaide, Melbourne, New York, and
Sydney, 60 days’ sight; Buenos Ayres,
Montevideo, and Rio de Janeiro at 90 days’
sight; and Hong Kong at 4 months’ sight.
The Days OF grace are three in the
United Kingdom, Canada, and the United
States; one in Geneva ; and ten in Russia
(only three on “sight” bills). There are
no Days of Grace allowed in Austria, Belgium,
France, Germany, Holland, Scandinavia,
Spain, and some other countries.

Rule. —The day of the week opposite any year las Tuesday opposite 1898)
corresponds in the table of months to the days of each month on which that day
of the week falls in that year; e.g., Tuesday in 1898 falls on 3, 10, 17, 24, and
31 of May, and 7,14, 21, and 28 of June; knowing the days of the month on
which Tuesday falls, the other days of the week arrange themselves naturally.
N.B. —Note that Leap Years are indicated by a * and any dates in January
or February of Leap Years are to be found under January* and February*.
The Calendar will also be found convenient for determining the day of the
week on which holidays will fall, E.g., to find upon what day of the week
Christmas 1900 will fall: Thursday is the day opposite 1900, and under
December we find that Thursday is the 27th, so that Christmas, the 25th,
will fall on Tuesday in 1900.

Rdle. —To find moon’s age on any given day in the years 1897 to 1910, add
to the day of the month the number of the Epact of the year (see Calendar)
and the tabular number of the month, and the sum will be the moon’s age. If
this sum exceeds 30, reject 30, and the remainder will be the moon’s age— e.g.,
to find the age of the moon Christmas 1898, number of days added to Epact
number for 1898, 7, added to tabular number for December, 10, = 25 -f 7-f 10
= 42. Reject 30, and the remainder, 12, is the moon’s age on that date.

Useful Interest
Table.*
At 5 per cent, per annum the amount of
month is one penny; having ascertained
may be reckoned proportionately:—
for every
her rates
interest upon one pound for
what this amounts to, other
2J per cent, is one-half. I 3J per cent, is seven-tenths.
3 per cent, is six-tenths. | 4 per cent, is four-fifths.
Thus, 5 per cent, upon £6O for ten months would be £2 10 s. ; zj per cent.
£1 s s.; 3 per cent. £1 ios.; 3J per cent. £1 154.; 4 per cent. £2. If
the rate of interest be more than 5 per cent., then the fraction over 5 per cent,
must be added. Thus, to reckon 6J per cent., add one-fourth; for 7J per
cent., one-half. Bankers and money-dealers calculate the interest exactly for
every day.

Zone Unit way Ticket* lor Great Cities.
If good for, say, 20 miles out on any railway, and sold only tn packages of 20
at moderate price, such tickets would have the following advantages for the
railways:—
1. Many more people would be induced to live farther from centre of city,
outside the radius of bus and tram competition. For all such the railway has a
perpetual mortgage on their transport. Cost of suburban carriage little
more to railway for 20 than 10 miles.
2. Increase of travel —tickets in possession would be used when new tickets
would not be purchased. Zone tickets would be used by whole families ;
season tickets good only for one person. Many more tickets used on other
lines.
3. Profit on tickets lost or never presented, and profit on tickets used for
shorter distances than represented by their cost. Many tickets given as
presents.
Advantages to the Public.
1. Cheaper homes, more ground and air, at same cost of carriage to and
from business.
2. Reduced rates on all railways leading from the city, as well as that on
which the person lives. Reduced rates for family and friends, not obtained
by season ticket at present.

Money of the World.
Mulhall gives the money of the world at £2,137,000,000, of which 400,0000
is paper, 871,000,000 silver, and 866,000,000 gold. From 1830 to 1880, therld
consumed by melting down plate, etc., 4,230 tons of silver more than it ned.
From 1800 to 1870, value of gold was about 15J times that of silver, om
1870 to 1880 it was x 6 the value of silver. It is now about 30 times thelue
of silver. In 1700 the world had 301 million pounds of money, in 18x568
million pounds, in 1850 2,400 million pounds sterling.
OrlgTn. of the Dollar.
Previous to July 6,1785, the English pound was in use in U.S. On thaate
the Continental Congress established the dollar, although the exact weigVas
not fixed until August 8, 1786, when it was made to equal about that of told
Spanish dollar. The dollar did not originate with the Spanish, buvas
first coined at Joachimsthal, a mining district in Bohemia, and hence ded
“ Joachims-thaler,” or simply thaler or dollar.

Handy Rule for Inland Poatag-e.— (Alfred Fryer
The rate for books is one farthing per ounce, but as there are no fang
postage stamps it is payable in halfpenny stamps. Thus ; for nine ouncbe
rate is nine farthings = zjd., but a halfpenny stamp is used instead a
farthing, making it zfd. in stamps.
The rate for a letter is one penny if it does not exceed four ounces in w>t.
If it does exceed four ounces, add \d. for every additional two ounces ort
of two ounces. Thus, if a letter weigh nine ounces, one penny covene
first four ounces, and the remaining five ounces will require x|rf., or |or
each two ounces, or part of two ounces, and you have 2%d. for the nine 01s.
If a latter weighs fourteen ounces, 3 \d. will cover the postage.
Parcel Post rates are id. the first pound, and id. for each additional ip
to 9 lb.; under 11 lb. if. Newspapers, \d. each. Postcards, \d. h.
Extreme size of letters, 24 in. X 12 in. X 12 in., but no limit to weight, ks

Advantage! of an International Postage Stamp.
At present you cannot enclose a stamp for reply to a foreign correspondent.
You cannot send payment for small amounts (is. or less) to foreign countries.
It is difficult to send to United States, France, or Germany to purchase a book,
pamphlet, or sample article. If there was a stamp equivalent to zjd. good in
all countries of Class A Postal Union, or if Class A Countries of Postal Union
agreed each to recognise the stamps of the others, correspondence would
increase, international trade be encouraged, and trade advertisements obtain
a world-wide value.
Titles.
The fees in Great Britain for letters-patent are : —Duke, £350; Marquis,
£300; Earl, £250; Viscount, £200; Baron, £150; Baronet, £roo.
Submarine Cables and Cable States.
Mr. Henniker Heaton, M ,P., gives the Capital of the 26 Submarine Telegraph
Companies at forty million pounds; the miles of cable as 120,000; their
Revenue, including subsidies, £3,204,060; their Reserves and Sinking Funds,
£3,610,000; and their Dividends as from 1 to 14} per cent. The whole of this
vast system of Cables, with the exception of about 8,600 miles is in British
hands, and the greater majority, by far, of these stations are in British
Territory.

Brerltiei.
A bill obtained by fraud, or from one intoxicated, is void. If a bill be lost
or stolen, it does not release the maker; he must pay it. An endorser is
exempt from liability, if not served with notice of its dishonour within twenty-
four hours of its non-payment. Bills and promissory notes bear interest.
Principals are responsible for their agents. Each individual in partnership
is responsible for the whole amount of the debts of the firm. A verbal con-
tract which cannot be performed within one year is voidable. Ignorance of the
law excuses no one. It is a fraud to conceal a fraud. It is illegal to compound
felony. The law compels no one to do impossibilities. An agreement without
consideration is void. Signatures in lead pencil are good in law. A receipt
for money is not legally conclusive. The acts of one partner bind all the
others. A contract made with a minor, except for necessaries, is void. A
contract made with a lunatic is voidable. Contracts concerning land should
he in wrting.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.
Orig in of WeighM and Measure*.
The earliest units of lineal measure were the finger, the thumb, the digit, the
palm, the hand, the forearm (cubit), the fathom (space from end of one arm to
end of other, both arms being extended), the girdle, the foot, the span, the
stride, the mile of 1000 paces, &c. Seeds were used as units both of weight
and of length. About 1266 it was enacted in England that “an English penny,
called a sterling, round and without any clipping, shall weigh 32 wheatcorns, in
the midst of the ear, and 20 pence do make an ounce, and 12 oz. 1 pound, and
8 pounds do make a gallon of wine, and 8 gallons of wine do make a London
bushel, which is the eighth part of a quarter ; ” and about 1324, that “ 3 grains
of barley, dry and round, do make an inch ” (meaning originally twelfth part),
“12 in. make a foot.” Other primitive standards of weight were the weight of
a man, the load of a man, of an ass, mule, bullock or camel.
Troy weight, supposed to be derived from the fair ot Troyes, was used in
England when, about the beginning of the 14th century, its foreign commerce
began to enlarge.
Avoirdupois weight, now used for all merchandise sold by weight, except
the precious metals and precious stones, has been in use in England for many
centuries. The word “avoirdupois” (to have weight) occurs first in the
English Statutes in 1335.
W'eig'h* ot Copper Coin*.
An avoirdupois lb. of copper was formerly coined into 24d., or 48 Jd., or 96
Jd. In iB6O these were replaced by a bronze coinage, of less weight, com-
posed of 9S parts of copper, 4 of tin, and 1 of zinc. A lb. of bronze (7000
grains) is coined into 48d., or 80 Jd., or 160 Jd.
A Jd. piece measures exactly an inch in diameter, so that, at a pinch, 12 of
them placed in a line might be used for a foot-rule.
Bronze coins are also available as letter-weights, seeing that 3 pence or 5
halfpence, or 10 farthings, go to one ounce.
1 sixpence ... ... =-■ 43.6364
ilb. troy is coined into 46H gold sovereigns, or into 66 shillings, or 26J half-
crowns.

We sell pickled cod by the barrel, trawled cod at so much each, hooked
cod by the score, crimped cod by the pound, shrimps by the stone, soles by the
pair, Dutch smelts by the basket, and English smelts by the hundred. Butter
in Ireland is sold by the cask and the firkin, in England by the pound of x6oz.,
by the roll of 2402., the stone, and the hundredweight, which is not xoolb. as
in Canada and the United States, but xxalb. A load of straw is 1,2961 b., of
old hay 2,0x61b., and of new hay 2,x601b., though it is not specified when hay
becomes old. A firkin of butter is S6lb., a firkin of soap 641 b., and a firkin of
raisins xxalb. A hogshead of beer is 54 gallons, but a hogshead of wine is 63
gallons. A pipe of Marsala is 93 gallons, of Madeira 92 gallons, of Bucellas
117 gallons, of port 103, r,nd of Teneriffe 100 gallons. A stone weight of a
living man is 141 b., but a stone weight of a dead ox is 81b., a stone of cheese is
xolb., of glass 51b., of iron 141 b., of hemp 321 b., of flax at Belfast x6|lb., and at
Downpatrick 241 b., of wool sold by growers 141 b., sold by woolstaplers 141 b.,
sold to each other 151 b., while a hundredweight of pork is 81b. heavier at
Belfast than it is at Cork —another injustice to Ireland. A barrel of beef is

The Halfpenny and Earthing-.
In the early coinages the silver penny was minted with a deep cross. When
it was broken into two parts, each was a halfpenny, and when into four, each
was a fourtbing, or farthing.

Th» Metric Hystem.
The metric system is so called as being based on the measurement of the
earth. The metre, its fundamental measure, is the ten-millionth part of a
meridian line drawn from the pole to the equator, and is 39.370113 English
inches. The xooth of a metre is the Centimetre. The Gramme is a cubic
centimetre of distilled water at the temperature of maximum density, being
iS'432 English grains, or "0022046 lb. avoirdupois. All the multiples and sub-
divisions of the current coins, as well as of every measure and weight, are
decimal. This system was first adopted by France in 1799. It is now the
legally-established sjstain in Austria, Belgium,Brazil, British India, France,
Greece, Hollsnd, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Norway,
Switzerland, Turkey, etc., etc.

The sections are all divided in quarters, which are named by the cardinal
points, as in section 1. The quarters are divided in the same way. The
description of a forty-acre lot would read; The south half of the west half of
the south-west quarter of section x, township 24, north of range 7 west, or as
the case might be; and sometimes will fall short, and sometimes overrun the
number of acres it is supposed to contain.
Homestead Privilege. —The laws give to every citizen, and to those who
have declared their intention to become citizens, the right to a homestead on
surveyed lands, to the extent of one-quarter section, or 160 acres, or a half-
quarter section, or 80 acres ; the former in cases of lower priced lands held
by law at $1.25 per acre, the latter of higher priced lands held at $2.50 per
acre, when disposed of to cash buyers. The pre-emption privilege isrestricted
to heads of families, widows, or single persons over the age of twenty-one.
* The Canadian sections are similar.
Every soldier and officer in the army, and every seaman, marine, and officer
of the navy, during the recent rebellion, may enter 160 acres from either class,
and length of time he served in the army or navy is deducted from the time
required to perfect title.


PHYSIOLOGICAL £s MEDICAL.
Facts about the Human Body.
The average height of a newly-born infant is 18 inches; average weight,
6' 77 lbs. In Britain the average weight of the newly-bom male child is 7J lbs.,
of the female child 6|lbs. It takes 3 years for the child to grow the second 18
inches, so as to be 3 feet high.
Average weight of adult male, 145 lbs.; height, 5 ft. 7 inches; chest measure-
ment of Male (England), 36 inches ; drawing strength between hands, 75 lbs.
The skeleton is one inch shorter than the measurement of the living person
—skeleton weighs about 14 lbs. —there are 214 bones. The body contains
about 12 lbs. of blood; about 6J ozs. pass through the heart in each beat,
and in adults from 65 to 73 beats occur per minute. All this passes
through the lungs and is revivified by the oxygen of the air—as bright red
blood goes by the subdivisions of the arteries to every minutest portion of
the body, and returns laden with impurities as dark venous blood through the
veins to the heart again.
The heart is a little larger than the fist, and weighs about 9 to n ozs.
The adult male brain weighs 49 to 50 ozs., female 44 to 45 ozs.; the nerves
of motion and sensation from every portion of the body end in the brain and
spinal cord.
The lungs consist of about 174 million sacs or cells at the end of minute
tubes that unite to form larger tubes, and these form the two bronchial tubes,
and these unite in the windpipe, opening into the mouth and nose. At each
breath the lungs are filled with air, the purpose of which is to oxygenate the
blood. The blood absorbs about 30 ozs. of oxygen per day, sufficient to
consume in the tissues of the body the carbon from about 3 lbs. of bread.
The utmost amount of air expirable at one breath is calculated at 200 to 250
cubic inches.
The stomach lies beneath the lungs, near the centre of the body, and is a
sac of a capacity of about a pint (without distension), in which the food is
changed by the digestive juices and ferments.
The liver, to the right, and beneath the stomach, weighs 50 to 60 ozs.;
it changes the starch of foods to sugar, secretes bile, and otherwise aids in
digestion.
Spleen, to left of stomach, about the size of fist, weighs sto 7 ozs.; functions
undetermined.
The intestines, about 34 feet in length; the digestion of the food and the
absorption of its nutrient qualities into the lacteals and the blood is completed
in the intestines.
The two kidneys weigh each about 4J ozs.; about 1,000 ozs. of blood passes
through them in an hour, and by them the waste fluid portions of the food not
useful to the blood are strained out. The waste fluids of the body are also
exuded through me pores of the skin. The area of the surface of the body is
about 2,500 square inches, it contains about 7,000,000 pores, each about i of an
inch long, or a total length of nearly 28 miles of pores.
The secretions of the body, saliva, gastric juice, chyle, bile, &c., which are
absorbed from the blood and reabsorbed by it in twenty-four hours, amount to
25 lbs. Adults require seven to nine hoars’ sleep.

Why in Food Beqnired?
The question seems almost absurd, so familiar is the fact; and yet the
answer to it involves one of the grandest chapters in the history of science.
In its simplest form it may be given in three words : it is fuel. We require
food frequently, for just the same reason that a fire requires coal frequently,
and a lamp oil—because we are burning away. The air that we breathe into
our lungs contains oxygen, and this oxygen combines with, or burns, the
muscles or other organs of our bodies just as it does the coals in a fire.
About 30 oz. of oxygen a day are thus consumed, requiring about 12 oz. of
carbon to replace the waste, or say 3 lbs. of bread. The heat produced in a
man’s body in the course of a day is considerable in quantity, though not very
intense in quality. Taking the average, it is enough to raise five and a half
gallons of water from freezing point to boiling point, and this is about the heat
that would be given off during the burning of a pound of coal. All this heat
comes from slow wasting or burning of the substance of the body, so that it is
evident that if we did not make up for this constant loss by eating food, om
organs would soon be wasted away and consumed.

ComjiDkory l&eg-istraticm of Births and Deaths.
In the case of Births, parents must effect registration within 42 days after
the birth, under a penalty in default; and when the 42 days have expired, the
Registrar is empowered to compel their attendance at his offices for the pur-
pose of such registration. The period during which births may be lawfully
registered (subject to payment of fees after three months) is twelve months.
In case of Death the nearest relatives of the deceased present at death, or
in attendance, are liable to a penalty if the registration be not effected within
five days, except when notice is sent to the Registrar with a medical certifi-
cate ; other relatives, the occupier of the house, and the person in charge of
the funeral, are secondary informants. After fourteen days any informant may
be required to meet the Registrar at his office, under a penalty for default.
Coroners are required to send their informations to the Registrar not later than
five days after the inquest.
To Cfive a Foot-bath in Bed.
Physicians agree that a hot foot-bath is one of the most efficacious means of
restoring warmth and circulation to the extremities in certain conditions of
disease, but probably not one doctor in a thousand knows that a hot foot-bath
can be easily and conveniently given in bed. Patients who are so weak they
can scarcely sit are consequently assisted out of bed in order to have a foot-
bath administered, and,the greatest care must be taken to avoid draughts and
the taking of cold. To give a foot-bath in bed, first lay a large bath-towel
smoothly in the bed at about the place where the knees of the patient come;
then, having prepared the bath of the right temperature, slide the foot-tub
in beneath the covers, letting it rest upon the towel you have already arranged.
At the same time, the patient, lying on his back, draws up his feet, bending his
knees so that the feet will rest in the tub placed about where the knees were.
Another towel can now be placed over the top of the tub, to prevent the steam
dampening the sheets. When the nurse removes the tub, the patient’s feet
rest upon the towiel. The feet are wiped dry, the towel removed, and not a
drop of water need be spilled upon the sheets. The whole thing is so simple
that you only wonder that you had never thought of it before.
Information tor the Mnrte,
To change the under sheet, roll it lengthwise—that is, begin at the side.
Push soiled sheet and all coverings towards the patient, leaving the mattress
bare. On this lay the clean roll, tucking one side under the mattress, unroll
it towards the patient and move him over the roll on the smooth space, keep-
ing him covered with the top blanket. Go to the other side of the bed, pull
out under blanket and soiled sheet, finish unrolling clean sheet and tuck it in.
Lay the clean upper sheet over the top blanket and cover it with another
blanket and thin white spread. When these are in place remove the blankets
that are next the patient, and he will be left lying between clean sheets, in a
clean night dress and thoroughly bathed, without having been exposed for an
instant to the chance of taking cold.
Open the window at the top, and if there seems too much air near the bed
place a screen between that and the window. If none is at hand, improvise
one by throwing a shawl over a clothes horse or fastening a cord between two
convenient points and hanging a blanket over it. If the (window will open
only at the bottom, tack the flannel there. The pillow-case should be changed
frequently and the pillow turned as often as can be done without disturbing
the patient. A cool, fresh surface next the face is very refreshing.

Inform*tiaa for tbe Ufurie— continued.
Keep the pillow well under the shoulders; nothing is more tiring to a weak
person than to have the edge come just in the hollow of the neck, throwing
the chin forward on the breast. Gently comb and brush the hair, and if there
is a beard keep it washed and free from tangles. If the patient is a woman,
part the back hair and braid each portion. It can be coiled high on the head or
allowed to hang in two tails. Carefully attend to nails on both hands and feet.
If the carpet cannot be removed, sweep it daily with a carpet sweeper or a
broom with a cloth wrapped round it, and burn the dust. Wipe the woodwork
and furniture daily with a damp cloth. Never leave milk standing in a sickroom;
it quickly absorbs impurities. If obliged to wait a few moments until the
invalid is ready to take it, cover the glass containing it. Make it a rule to
leave nothing in the sick room that is not positively needed there. Remove
every cup, glass and spoon as soon as used, and wash all bottles when empty.
Keep the little table beside the bed covered with a white cloth, and see that it
is always spotless. Be as cheeerful as possible, and leave worries on the other
side of the door. Never despair while life remains.
To Save Doctors’ JBills.
Never go to bed with cold or damp feet.
Never lean with the back upon anything that is cold.
Never begin a journey until the breakfast has been eaten.
Never take warm drinks and then immediately go out into the cold.
Never omit regular bathing, for unless the skin is in regular condition the
cold will close the pores and favour congestion or other diseases.
After exercise of any kind, never ride in an open carriage, or near the window
of a car for a moment; it is dangerous to health and even life.
When hoarse, speak as little as possible until the hoarseness is recovered
from, else the voice may be permanently lost or difficulties of the throat be
produced.
Merely warm the back by the fire, and never continue keeping the back
exposed to the heat after it has become comfortably warm. To do otherwise
is debilitating.
When going from a warm atmosphere into a cooler one, keep the mouth
almost closed, so that the air may be warmed by its passage through the nose
ere it reaches the lungs.
Never stand still in cold weather, especially after having taken a slight
degree of exercise, and always avoid standing on ice or snow, where the person
is exposed to the cold wind.

Drowning: and IMntfocatlon— continued.
Every boy and girl should be taught Swimming, and a knowledge of the
means of Restoration from Drowning.
The treatment for drowning aid suffocation from gas, &c., is the same.
First, restore breathing ; second, promote warmth and circulation.
At once, place the patient on his back in a lying position, with a pillow or
coat rolled up underneath the shoulder-blades, and with the head hanging
back slightly; remove any sand, or mud, or salt water, &c., from the mouth,
by turning the face over to one side so that it runs out; undo all tight cloth-
ing from the neck and chest; then try and induce the action of breathing in the
following manner: —Take hold of the arms by elbows (standing behind the
head of the patient), and draw the arms gently and steadily upwards until
they meet above the head (see figure i). Keep the arms up in that position
for two seconds, then draw down the patient’s arms and press them firmly
against the sides of the chest (see figure 2); repeat these movements steadily
and slowly, about 15 times in a minute, until the patient begins to breathe,
or until the doctor arrives and pronounces life to be extinct.
If there is a second person present, he can assist by placing one hand below
the chest and pressing gently while the arms are coming down, also he should
raise and rub the legs. As soon as the patient begins to breathe, leave off the
movement to induce breathing, and go on to the
Treatment to Promote Warmth and Circulation.
If possible, give a warm bath for five minutes; wrap the patient in warm,
dry blankets, rub the limbs, under the blankets, firmly upwards. Put hot
bottles or bricks to feet, to pit of stomach, under armpits. When able to
swallow, give small quantities of warm wine and water, or spirit and water or
coffee. Keep the patient in bed, and let him sleep if possible. If there is
distress in breathing, put a mustard plaster on chest and on back below
shoulders.
Antidote* for Poisons.
In cases where other articles available as antidotes are not in the house,
give two tablespoonfuls of mustard mixed in a pint of warm water. Also
give large draughts of warm milk or water mixed with oil, butter or lard. If
possible, while awaiting the arrival of the doctor, give as follows :
Bed-bug Poison,
Blue Vitriol,
Corrosive Sublimate,

XTKRTBOUTI MEDICAL WUIBHE.
This Guide is intended to afford hints and suggestions as to the treatment
of diseases, rather than hard-and-fast rules. It is not intended to tdke the
place of the physician, whose advice, as to diagnosis and treatment, is always
to be preferred. No book of directions, hozvever large, can compare with
the skill and knowledge acquired by the physician in the actual Practice ofhts
Profession. For more extendea information, see Saxon Co.’s “Every-
body’s Medical Guide.”
Al»sce»*. —An abscess is a collection of matter attended with pain, heat,
and swelling of the part. It may be acute, rapidly coming to a head, or cold,
or chronic —that is to say, running a slow course. An abscess may occur in
any part of the body, and may be either internal or external. It sometimes
arises from a local injury, but more commonly it occurs without any known
cause. It depends on the general condition of the patient, which should be
maintained by every means in his power. Sometimes an abscess has to be
opened by a surgeon by means of a lancet, and the pus vacuated, but frequently
it is possible to dispense with surgical assistance, and to treat the disease
simply by medical means. In the acute stage the best medicine is the Tabloid*
Triturate of Sulphide of Calcium, one-tenth grain—one to be taken every three
hours. As a local application nothing is better than a mixture of equal parts
of Extract of Belladonna and Glycerine, smeared over the part, which is then
covered with a large hot linseed meal poultice. This method of treatment will
often check the progress of the disease in a few days. During convalescence,
the health may be maintained by the administration of Elixoid of Calisaya
Bark, given in doses of a tablespoonful three times a day before meals.
Acidity.—Acidity is due to the presence of an excess of gastric juice In
the stomach, and is one of the many forms of indigestion. Its symptoms are
pain and burning at the pit of the stomach, flatulence, and an acid taste in the
mouth, which usually sets the teeth on edge. It is not by any means a serious
complaint, and can readily be cured by a little judicious management. In the
first place much attention must be paid to diet. The food which is taken should
be light and readily digestible; the bowels should not be confined; and the
patient should take plenty of exercise. The best remedies for this complaint
are Soda Mint Tabloids (one or two to be taken after meals, or during an
attack), with occasionally a Tabloid of Bicarbonate of Potassium. Sal Volatile
is often recommended for this purpose, but though it may give temporary
relief, it often ultimately increases the flow of gastric juice, and prolongs the
suffering.
Ag'ae.—Ague, or intermittent fever, is a common disease. „ It results from
the decomposition of vegetable matter. It is what is called a periodical com-
plaint, the attacks coming on at stated intervals, the patient in the interim
being, to all appearances, perfectly well. An attack of ague is usually
divided into three stages;—the “ cold ” stage, during which the sufferer
shivers violently; the “ hot ” stage, in which he complains of feeling burning
heat; and the “ sweating ” stage, in which he perspires profusely. This
complaint, untreated, shows no tendency to terminate. Its medicinal treatment
is perfectly simple, and in acute cases there is no difficulty in obtaining relief.
* Thfoughout the Guide, where possible, the medicines recommended are
the Tabloids of compressed Drugs, as in this form there is greater accuracy of
dose and less liability of mistake. They are easily administered, and uniform
in purify.


The best remedy is Quinine, and this should bo given in the form of Tabloids
of Bi-sulphate of Quinine, each containing five grains. It is customary to
administer three of these Tabloids between two successive attacks of the
disease. Really no other treatment is necessary, but in chrenic cases it may
be advisable to give Elixoid of Calisaya Bark, in tablespoonful doses three
times a day, to ward off fresh access of the disease. In France and other
countries, Tabloid Triturates of Arsenic Acid, containing one-sixtieth grain,
are preferred to Quinine, but in England and the Colonies, Quinine is uni-
versally employed.
Alcoholism. —By this is meant the symptoms which result from over-
indulgence in alcohol. They may assume either a chronic or an acute form.
Acute alcoholism is generally known by the technical name of “ delirium
tremens.” Chronic alcoholism, although not so speedily fatal, is an equally
serious complaint. It matters very little in what form the drink is taken. If
swallowed in sufficient quantities, the ultimate effects are practically the same.
The liver is soon affected, and passes into a condition which is known by the
term of “ cirrhosis.” The legs and abdomen become distended with fluid, and
it may be necessary for the patient to be tapped. These are always serious
cases, necessitating the attendance of a doctor. The earlier stages are vomit-
ing, especially in the morning, tremulousness of the hands, noises in the head,
bad dreams, giddiness, tenderness of the feet, and piles. The general
appearance of a person suffering from this condition is perfectly characteristic,
and no difficulty is ever experienced by the physician in recognising the
nature of the complaint. In the treatment of alcoholism, Tabloids of Quinine
two grains, three times a day, will be found useful. For sleeplessness at night,
Elixoid of Bromide of Potassium, two teaspoonfuls, the last thing on retiring
to rest, will usually effect the desired object. For the dyspepsia or indigestion
which often accompanies this condition, Tabloids of Soda Mint, taken
frequently, may afford temporary relief. It must be remembered that in this
disease no benefit will be experienced unless the sufferer will consent to
abandon his evil habits, and become practically a total abstainer.
Anseissla. —This is the medical term for poorness of the blood, a con-
dition which occurs most frequently in young and badly-nourished women.
There is always more or less pallor of the face and lips. The appetite is
poor; the patient has great difficulty in doing her work; has puffiness ab-sut
the face, legs, and ankles; the circulation is weak; and not unfrequently
palpitation of the heart is a common symptom. This condition goes on pro-
gressively increasing, unless remedial treatment is resorted to. A most
useful preparation of Iron, which is the best remedy in these cases, is the
Wyeth Dialysed Iron, which should be administered ten drops on a lump of
sugar five times a day. It has a great advantage over most other prepara-
tions of Iron —that it does not tend to constipate. A course of this treatment
extending over three or four weeks will usually effect a cure. To prevent a
return of the disease, the Elixoid of Calisaya Bark will be found useful, a
tablespoonful or more being taken three times a day. The patient should take
plenty of exercise in the fresh air, and should be well fed, a little stimulant, in
the form of stout, being taken at meal times only.
Aiag'ina s®ectorls. —Angina Pectoris, or suffocative breast-pang, is
a very serious disease, which calls for immediate medical treatment. The
chief symptoms are intense pains in the chest, accompanied by a sensation of
impending death, coming on immediately after any exertion. In the absence


of skilled medical advice, a Tabloid of Trinitrine Comp, should be adminis-
tered every ten minutes or quarter-of-an-hour, for an hour, or until relief is
obtained. This method of treatment is to be resorted to only in cases of
emergency, and no delay is admissible in obtaining the services of a medical
man.
Apoplexy . —This is another serious disease, which urgently necessitates
the advice of a doctor. The patient usually falls down insensible, and may
exhibit symptoms of paralysis. His clothes should be loosened; he should be
placed in a recumbent position, the windows opened, and ice or cold water
should be applied to his head. An apoplectic seizure often results in prolonged
convalescence, during which it is necessary to maintain the patient’s powers in
every way, and the best remedies for this purpose are Dialysed Iron (Wyeth),
ten drops three times a day, or Beef and Iron Wine, a tablespoonful at
eleven o’clock in the morning and at four o’clock in the afternoon. Attention
should be paid to the condition of the bowels.
.iNthma, or .\ervous Aattima, —Asthma is a paroxysmal disease
to which many people are subject. The attacks usually come on suddenly,
vary greatly in intensity, and may last from ten minutes to three or four hours.
When the paroxysm is at its height the patient is usually incapacitated from
exertion, and has great difficulty even in speaking. It is sometimes no easy
matter to cut short an attack, but benefit will often be experienced from the
use of Nitre papers, Himrod’s powder. Stramonium cigarettes and cigars,
and the use of the Chloride of Ammonium Inhaler (Yereker’s patent). In the
intervals, the administation of ten drops of pure Terebene every three hours,
with its occasional inhalation, will be found beneficial. Another excellent
remedy is the EHxoid of lodide of Potassium, two or three teasponfuls three
times a day, with an extra dose at the onset of an attack. Pinol has also been,
and is now, largely employed for this purpose. As an external applica-
tion to the chest, Lanoline is recommended. It is very important that the
bowels should be carefully regulated, and for this purpose Laxative Tabloids
may be used, one or more being taken every morning according to the require-
ments of the patient.
SSaidnesK. or liOM of Hair. —This generally results from worry
and overwork, or impairment ot the genera! health. Many preparations of
Cantharides are recommended for promoting the growth of the hair, and many
of these undoubtedly prove beneficial. At the same time it must be remem-
bered that it is not purely a local complaint, and much may be done by im-
proving the general condition of the health. One of the best remedies is
Elixoid of Phosphorus, two teaspoonfuls three times a day, which serves to
supply the ingredient in which the hair-follicules are deficient. A bland,
unirritating application for the scalp is Lanoline, an animal fat which is readily
absorbed by the skin. It should be rubbed in freely night and morning, pre-
ferably in front of a fire. Inflammation or irritation of the scalp may be
speedily relieved by freely applying Hazeline.
XSilioasness.—Biliousness arises from deficient secretion of bile’by
the liver. It is a common accompaniment of constipation and indigestion.
Derangement of the liver frequently results from slight indiscretions in dietary.
Excessive indulgence in alcohol is one of the most frequent causes. Another
potent cause is a too sedentary life and want of sufficient exercise. Many
complaints, such, for example, as giddiness, dimness of sight, double vision,
coldness and creeping in the arms and legs, are attributable to these simple
causes. The first necessity in the way of treatment is to regulate the diet


carefully, and to take plenty of out-door exercise every day. A blue pill is
usually considered one of the best remedies, but it should be taken cautiously,
for it is a preparation of mercury, and if its administration be continued for
too long a time, it may produce disagreeable symptoms. Vegetable Laxative
Tabloids are very useful indeed, as they contain no mercury. A good pre-
paration for the relief of the more immediate symptoms is Bishop’s Granular
Effervescing Ext. Nux Vomica, the dose of which is a teaspoonful once or
twice a day For the acidity and flatulence, which so frequently accompanies
this condition, the Soda Mint Tabloids will be found excellent. Should vomit-
ing be troublesome, Tabloids of Subnitrate of Bismuth, each containing five
grains, may be administered.
jßMacfe Eye, —One of the best applications for a black eye, resulting
from a blow or contusion, is Hazeline, applied freely on lint or absorbent
cotton. Very hot water, applied frequently, is one of the best remedies. As
a rule, the condition runs its course, and it is difficult for the sufferer to prevent
an unsightly appearance for some days.
Bleeding, —Bleeding may be arterial or venous. Blood which comes
from the arteries is usually bright red, while that which is derived from the
veins is dark in colour. The blood may pass from the bowels, it may come
from the lungs, or from the stomach, fiom the throat, from the gums, or from
other regions. The amount may vary from a teaspoonful up to a pint, or even
more. In cases where large quantities of blood are passed, the patient usually
becomes faint, and presents symptoms of what is called syncope, and the pre-
sence of a physician is most necessary. The first step to be taken is to check
the flow of blood, and after that to prevent, by the judicious use of stimulants,
the sufferer dying from the shock which he has experienced. The patient
should be kept cool, and pieces of ice should be administered from time to
time, exertion of any kind being forbidden. During the convalescence, from
the weakness following loss of blood, Extract of Malt (Kepler) and Dialysed
Iron (Wyeth) may be administered. The Ext. Malt should be taken twice
a day, in tablespoonful doses, after meals; the Dialysed Iron, three times
a day, in ten-drop doses between meals. A valuable agent, in slight
cases, is the Hazeline, fifteen drops or more of which should be adminis-
tered every two or three hours, until the bleeding ceases. In bleeding from
the surface of the body, or from the gums. Hazeline may be applied locally on
cotton wool.
Spoils.—A boil may bo described as a small abscess, although, as a rule,
it contains little or no matter. They are Usually intensely painful, and rapidly
depress the vital powers of the sufferer. The treatment of this troublesome
complaint is almost identical with that already mentioned in the treatment of
abscess. {See Abscess.) Carbuncles should be treated the same.
Brigplit’s —This is a condition, known also as Albuminuria,
which urgently necessitates medical attendance. It may occur either in an
acute or in a chronic form. Acute Bright’s disease is a very serious complaint,
and not unfrequently ends fatally. Chronic Bright’s disease is more amenable
to treatment, and much may be done to afford relief. The patient must, as a
rule, remain indoors; he must avoid alcoholic stimulants of every kind; he
must wear warm clothing, and should avoid by every means in his power
fetting cold. Tabloids of Nitrate of Potassium, five grains, one every three
ours, will often give relief to some of the most prominent symptoms.
Broncbitit. —Bronchitis may be either acute or chronic. Acute bron-
chitis is attended with fever, quickness of the pulse, heat of the skin, cough,


expectoration, pain in the side, and shortness of breath. Chronic bronchitis,
which may last for many months, especially in the winter time, is characterised
chiefly by cough ; abundant expectoration (often streaked with blood); per-
sistent shortness of breath, especially after exertion ; and some loss of flesh.
This condition is very common indeed in people who are exposed to the incle-
mency of the weather, and it is one of the most fatal diseases in this country.
It is difficult to effect a cure, but, as a rule, temporary relief may be obtained.
Chloride of Ammonium Tabloids are very useful, and these may be taken
freely without fear of bad consequences. Another good remedy is Pure
Terebene, which should be taken in ten-drop doses every three hours, and
inhaled freely either from hot water or from a pocket-handkerchief. Pinol
may be used in the same manner, and for the same purpose. When the
patient is confined entirely to the house, he cannot do better than use the
Vereker Chloride of Ammonium Inhaler, taking the fumes well into the chest
so as to allay the cough and facilitate the discharge of phlegm. In all diseases
of this nature nursing is as important as remedies. Even temperature, pure
air, hot foot-baths, and hot poultices on the chest will prove beneficial.
Brnlioi. —In the treatment of bruises, Tincture of Arnica is often
recommended. It is undoubtedly of much value when applied to the injured
part, but it has the great disadvantage of giving rise, in some people, to attacks
which closely resemble those of erysipelas. A safer and better agent is
Hazeline lotion. This should be applied freely on a piece of lint, or on a soft
pocket-handkerchief.
ESunion, —This is due to inflammation of the sac or bursa which
protects the outer side of the joint of the big toe, and is usually the result
of wealing tight and ill-fitting boots. The sufferer should if possible take
a prolonged rest, and then have boots specially made to take all pressure
off the joint. The strength should be supported by judicious use of tonic
remedies, such as quinine, cinchona, or chiretta.
SStims and Scalds. — One of the best remedies for a burn is Carron
Oil —a mixture of equal parts of Linseed or Olive Oil with Lime-water.
Another admirable remedy is Bicarbonate of Soda (cooking soda), a small box
of which should always be kept at hand for immediate use. Cover the burn
with it, and bind up with a dry and soft pocket-handkerchief. Hazeline_ may
be applied to the part to allay pain, and it promotes the healing of the injured
Chilblains and Chapped Hands.— Chilblains usually result
from bad circulation. They occur most frequently in young and growing girls.
They may be avoided to some extent by maintaining the general condition of
the health. This is best effected by attention to diet and exercise,, and by
giving Kepler Extract of Malt or the Kepler Solution of Cod Liver Oil in
Extract of Malt. Dialysed Iron (Wyeth) is also administered, and may
have to be continued during the greater part of the winter. To allay
the tingling and itching of the part, Tincture of lodine, painted on freely, is
sometimes found to be useful. Hazeline may also be used in the same way,
and it is more cleanly and convenient to be used. For a broken chilblain
apply dry starch, finely powdered.
Colds. —A cold may attack the head, or it may attack the chest. In the
former case, the chief complaint is a watery discharge from the eyes and nose,
accompanied by a sense of fullness and sneezing. When the chest is
affected, cough, expectoration, pain, and tightness of the chest are more com-
mon. The cold may be a feverish cold, or it may be unaccompanied by fever.


The sufferer usually feels somewhat disinclined for work, the throat is often
congested, so that the patient is unable to speak with any ease or comfort.
The best remedy for cold in the head is lodide of Potassium Tabloids, one
three times a day, with an inhalation from ten drops of Tincture of lodine in a
jug of hot water. When the throat is congested, Voice Tabloids will be found
useful, or Tabloids of Chloride of Ammonium with Borax, one of the latter to
be taken frequently. For cold in the chest, the treatment should be similar to
that adopted for bronchitis. A cold accompanied by fever is often broken up
by the administration of Quinine Tabloids, in doses of from five to ten grains.
Dover’s Powder is also a favourite remedy.
Colic. —Colic usually arises from indigestion, but may be the result of
exposure. Some people suffer from Colic on getting wee feet. It is often
associated with flatulence and constipation. Colic is always attended with
pain, the pain being often of great severity, so that the sufferer is unable to
rest, or oven to remain quiet. The mode of onset is variable, but usually it
comes on suddenly, and may last for hours, or even days. Sometimes it termi-
nates in a critical attack of diarrhoea, or vomiting, which gives speedy relief.
Many people suffering from this condition take a glass of hot spirits and water,
a teaspoonful of sal volatile in a wine-glassful of water, or a dose of ginger or
peppermint water. A very good remedy is the Tabloid of Soda Mint, two or
three being taken for a dose, and repeated as often as maybe necessary. Pure
Terebene is another good remedy, and should be taken in ten-drop doses.
When speedy action of the bowels is required, Compressed Las alive Tabloids
may be taken, one or more according to the peculiarity of the patient. For
restlessness at night, resulting from Colic, Elixoid of Bromide of Potassium,
in teaspoonful-doses, may be found useful. Always, if possible, apply hot
compresses over the abdomen.
Constipation. —Constipation, or confinement of the bowels, is usually
the result of want of tone in the intestines. It may arise from many causes.
One of the most common causes of constipation is want of exercise, another is
mental anxiety. Over-work, travelling, the abuse of purgatives, poorness of
the blood, irregularities of other functions, and feebleness of the heart’s action,
are often accessory causes. In the treatment of this complaint regularity of
habit should be encouraged. Great attention should be paid to dietary, and
such things as baked apples, stewed prunes, honey, and fresh fruits should be
taken in abundance. Purgatives are, as a rule, to be avoided, but the occa-
sional use of a Vegetable Laxative Tabloid is to be commended. Tabloids of
Extract Cascara Sagrada are now much employed, and are free from un-
pleasant effects. The condition of the health generally should be maintained
by tonics, such as the Elixoid of Phosphates of Iron, Quinine, and Strychnia.
Iron is, as a rule, to be avoided, but Fellows’ Syrup of Hypophosphites will be
found beneficial, by stimulating the intestines to action.
Consumption.. —Consumption, or Phthisis, is one of the most prevalent
diseases in this country. It usually attacks people between twenty and thirty,
but it is not uncommon at a more advanced age. It occurs frequently in
stonemasons, grinders of steel instruments, miners, tailors, sempstresses, and
others whose occupation is of a sedentary nature, or exposes them to the in-
halation of dust. Impure air, constant bad food, dissipation, and deficiency of
exercise, are all common exciting causes. It is said that it may arise in some
cases from deficiency in mastication, due to the loss of teeth. The mortality
in England from this disease alone is very great, and it has been pointed out that
the death-rate from consumption is in inverse proportion to the dryness of tbs


situation. Judicious sub-soil drainage would do much to decrease the preva-
lence of what may be considered a national malady. The chief symptoms of con-
sumption are cough, expectoration, spitting of blood, night-sweats, shortness of
breath, and general wasting. Some or all of these symptoms may be present.
The spitting of blood may amount to only a few teaspoonfuls, or the amount
brought up may be very great indeed, so as to endanger the life of the patient.
The cough is usually distressing, and frequently keeps the patient awake at
night. The expectoration varies in character and in quantity; sometimes there
is very little, sometimes it is thick and yellow, and brought up with difficulty.
The shortness of breath is not a very prominent symptom, and often gives no
trouble until near the end. Night-sweating rapidly exhausts the patient, and
may be so severe as not only to wet the night-shirt, but also all the bed-clothes,
and sometimes even soaking the mattress. The loss of flesh is generally pro-
gressive, the patient in a few months being reduced almost to a shadow. The
temperature, as shewn by the thermometer, is always elevated, the amount of
fever often being as much as four or five degrees at bed-time. Diarrhoea is
not an uncommon accompaniment, and other symptoms, such as loss of hair,
vomiting, pains in the side, and sleeplessness, are occasionally noticed. It may
be said, speaking generally, that consumption is not curable, but under judi-
cious medical supervision a great deal may be done to ameliorate the symp-
toms and prolong the life of the sufferer. Some years ago it was considered
that the duration of consumption in this country, in each individual, rarely ex-
ceeded two years, but since the introduction of Cod Liver Oil, Extract of Malt,
and other remedies, patients frequently live many' years, their term of life being
but little shortened. 1 lie remedies which have to be taken in this condition
are various. First, and most important is Cod Liver Oil. It is essential that
the Cod Liver Oil should be absolutely pure and free from taste. The best
preparation is the Kepler Cod Liver Oil, which should be given in teaspoonful
doses to begin with, three times a day, after meals. It matters little how it is
taken. Some people prefer it by itself; others take it in milk; some in a little
brandy and water; while many suck an acid drop immediately after it. When
a difficulty is experienced in taking Cod Liver Oil, Extract of Malt will be
found to be an admirable substitute; and, speaking generally, it may be said
that the Kepler Extract of Malt is better assimilated, and found to be more
useful, than Cod Liver Oil during the summer months. When Cod Liver Oil
is not easily digested, it can be taken without the slightest difficulty in the form
of Kepler Solution of Cod Liver Oil in Malt Extract. Both the Extract of Malt
and the Oil and Malt should be taken after meals. It is best to begin with a
small dose, which should be gradually and progressively increased as the
patient becomes used to it. Another remedy which is often given in conjunc-
tion with the Cod Liver Oil and the Kepler Extract of Malt, Is Fellows’ Syrup
of Hypophosphites, the dose of which is a teaspoonful in a wine-glass of water
three times a day. The progress of the disease, too, is often arrested by the
Elixoid of Phosphorus,—dose, one or two teaspoonfuls three or four times a day.
The Tabloid Triturates of Arsenious Acid, one-sixtieth grain, are given by
many doctors with advantage. To check the cough, small doses of laudanum
or paregoric are frequently prescribed, but it must be remembered that opium,
if taken in large quantities, has a tendency to spoil the appetite, and in this
way may do harm instead of good. Expectoration may be facilitated by the
administration of Tabloids of Chloride of Ammonium—one or two doses three
or four times a day. For spitting of blood. Tannic Acid Tabloids, given freely
and frequently, will bo found of much value. When the throat is painful from
excessive coughing, a Voice Tabloid (containing Chlorate of Potash, Borax


and Cocaine) may be taken. For sleeplessness, Tabloids of Dover’s Powder,
two at bed time, will be found tbe best remedy; and they will also be found
useful in checking the night-sweating, which so rapidly exhausts the strength.
For pain or stitch in the side, the best application is Lanoline, which should
be rubbed into the affected part freely. A change of air is in many cases
necessary for the patient, and the principal seaside resorts in this country
suitable for invalids are Ventnor, Bournemouth, Hastings, and Torquay. In
advanced cases, it is sometimes necessary for the patient to take a sea voyage,
either to Australia or the Cape of Good Hope.
C®nTHl»i®ns.— Convulsions may occur either in adults or in children.
They are always serious, and in most cases may be regarded as necessitating
the attendance of a doctor. Put the patient at once in a hot bath, and,
pending the doctor’s arrival, Bromide of Ammonia can be given in the form of
a Tabloid, one to be taken every quarter-of-an-hour, until sleep is induced.
(For small children the dose should be one-half of a five-grain Tabloid.)
When the bowels are confined, it is best to give one of the Laxative Tabloids.
CoMg-Is.—Cough is, in itself, not a disease,but a symptom common to various
diseases or complaints. For example, cough is a common accompaniment of
consumption, bronchitis, inflammation of the lungs, pleurisy, and many throat
affections. The treatment of cough depends essentially on the disease of which
it is a symptom. When the cough is simply a throat-cough, the best remedy
is the Voice Tabloids, sucked frequently. When it is due to congestion of the
throat, the Chloride of Ammonium and Borax Tabloids will be found better.
When it is a stomach-cough, the Peptonic Tablets, taken three or four times
a day, before meals, will be most efficacious. In all cases the patient should
be well clothed, and flannel, or its equivalent, should be worn next to the skin.
In obstinate cases the application of a large linseed poultice to the chest and
throat will be found most beneficial.
Cram|i, —Cramp is usually due to an involuntary contraction of the
muscles, either of the limbs or the walls of the stomach. It may be induced
by cold, or by over-exertion. The best and most immediate remedy is friction
with the warm hand, either alone, or wet with Pinol, or with Eucalyptine. The
pain may be sometimes relieved by giving two Tabloids of Dover’s Powder.
Care should be taken to see that the bowels are well open, and the patient
should be kept warm and in a recumbent position. Sometimes the administra-
tion of a little stimulant, such as a glass of hot brandy and water, will be
found beneficial.
Croap.—Croup is a disease which most frequently affects children. It
is a highly dangerous affection of the larynx, and necessitates medical
assistance. The best remedy to give in cases of emergency is a teaspoonful of
Ipecac. Wine. This usually results in producing copious expectoration, and
perhaps vomiting.
Damtrilf. —This is not very difficult to cure, and a few applications
of Lanoline cream night and morning will usually effect the desired object.
Hazeline, mixed with an equal quantity of Eau de Cologne, may also be
used with advantage. The head and hair may be washed once a week
with Lanoline soap and water, but it is not advisable to use cosmetics.
The general condition of the health may be improved by a course of
extract, or some other similar remedy.
Meafness.—Deafness may be due to a variety of causes. Sometimes
the tubes passing from the throat into the ear become blocked up by


accumulation of wax ; sometimes the drum of the ear is injured, or perforated;
whilst in other cases the internal mechanism of the ear itself is at fault. In
cases of throat-deafness, benefit may sometimes be derived from the continued
use of the Chloride of Ammonium Inhaler (Vereker’s). As an external
application, Hazeline may be found useful. When the disease is due to
deficient nerve-force, Fellows’ Syrup of the Hypophosphites, in teaspoonful
doses, three times a day, is the best remedy. At the same time it must be
admitted that many cases of deafness, especially those which occur in people
advanced in life, resist all treatment.
Debility or Weakness. —This is a common complaint in over-
crowded cities, especially amongst those who have to labour for their daily
bread. The symptoms are various, but, as a rule, the sufferer complains that
his work is a trouble to him. He feels that it is a difficulty to get about; he
sleeps badly; his appetite is poor ; and he is disinclined for amusement of any
kind. There is no one remedy which will effect a cure in these cases. Debility
very often necessitates a change of air, a change of scene, and a change of
work. There are, however, some remedies which prove useful in warding off
the more prominent symptoms, and they may even effect a cure, when the
condition has not gone too far. One of the best of these is Elixoid of Iron,
Quinine, and Strychnia, given in doses of a teaspoonful three times a day.
This treatment should be continued for at least three weeks, and may then be
followed by a course of the Fellows’ Syrup of Hypophosphites. When the
sufferer is unable to sleep at night, the Bromide of Potassium Tabloids (two to
three) should be taken at bedrtime. Good clothing, plenty of exercise,
cheerful occupation, and pleasant companionship are essential for recovery.
Delirium Tremem. —Delirium tremens, or acute alcoholism, is the
result of excessive indulgence in alcoholic drinks. It is essentially a
dangerous condition, and one which necessitates the immediate attendance of
a doctor. Pending the arrival of medical aid, there would be no harm in
giving a mild purgative, such as one or two of the Laxative Tabloids, and
sleep might be induced by the administration of Tabloids of Bromide of
Potassium, three or four being taken at a dose. It is probable, if sickness is a
frominent symptom, that the food will have to be predigested by means of
'eptonising Powders (Fairchild’s). It is desirable that the patient should be
kept in bed, in a cool room, and the attendance of a nurse will be found
necessary.
Diaket®*. —There are two kinds of diabetes—one in which there is
sugar in the urine, and another in which urine is passed in very large quanti-
ties, but is free from the presence of sugar or any other abnormal constituent.
In cases of sugary diabetes, the patient rapidly emaciates, the skin becomes
dry and harsh, urine is passed in very large quantities, whilst the bowels are
obstinately confined. The disease usually takes a chronic course, and it not
unfrequently happens that, as the symptoms progress, it develops into con-
sumption. It is on this point, above all others, that strict attention to diet is
of importance. It is necessary to prohibit the use of all articles containing
either sugar or starch. The patient must be placed on what is called a diabetic
dietary. He may take animal food in almost unlimited quantities, but must
avoid sugar or starch in any form. For many years a great difficulty was
experienced in inducing patients to restrict themselves to this limited dietary,
the food being unpalatable from the absence of sugar. Recently a substance
called Saccharin has been discovered, which, although not a sugar, has all


the sweetening properties of sugar, and may be used by diabetic patients as a
substitute for that article. It is purchased in the form of Saccharin Tabloids,
one of which will be found sufficient to sweeten a large cup of tea or coffee.
Amongst medicinal remedies for the sugary form of diabetes. Tabloids of
Codeine will be found most useful, but they should not be resorted to except
under medical supervision. In the other form of diabetes, in which there is no
sugar in the urine, it is not necessary to restrict the diet in the way above
mentioned.
Sitjtrrßioest.—Diarrhoea, or looseness of the bowels, is a common com-
plaint, and is especially prevalent during the summer and autumn, when it
sometimes assumes an almost epidemic form. The evacuations from the
bowels are generally copious, frequent, and may be attended by pain and colic.
Unless the disease is checked, it sometimes gives rise to symptoms of collapse,
the patient in a few hours passing into a very critical condition. It must be
remembered that diarrhoea is often a symptom of some other complaint, such
as dysentery, or typhoid fever. Simple cases may be treated by domestic
remedies; but, as a rule, it may be found that in obstinate cases the advice of
a medical man is essential. A very good remedy, and one which can by no
possibility do harm, is the Tabloids of Sub-nitrate of Bismuth. Two or three
of these Tabloids should be taken every three hours, until the excessive dis-
charge is arrested. When diarrhoea is dependent upon the presence of acidity
in the stomach, the Neutralising Tabloids (Soda Mint) will be found most
beneficial. Care should be taken to ascertain that the drainage of the house
is good, and that the complaint is not due to drinking impure water.
IMet. —In many diseases the kind of diet taken is quite as important as
the kind of medicine. Space does not admit of giving more than hints as to
dietary; but the instructions of the physician in this regard should be carefully
followed. Within the last few years several preparations have been discovered
to aid in the digestion and assimilation of food in those diseases in which the
digestive functions are impaired. Zymine and the Zymine Peptonising
Powders (Fairchild’s) are the best of these. Full directions for the preparation
of food for invalids accompany the Powders.
® iplxtlseria.—Diphtheria is a dangerous and contagious disease, which
requires prompt and skilled treatment. It attacks the throat, forms a mem-
brane, and often gives rise, even in a few hours, to considerable difficulty in
breathing. The voice becomes husky; there is a good deal of cough, with
expectoration ; and diarrhoea is not uncommon. No time must be lost in
sending for skilled assistance, and care should be taken to isolate the patient,
or the disease will rapidly spread.
Mropsy. —Dropsy means the accumulation of fluid in the limbs, under
the skin, or in one of the large cavities of the body, such as the abdomen, or
thorax. It usually results from heart disease, liver disease, or disease of the
kidneys. It is impossible to give any indication for its treatment, but it may
be considered generally that the endeavour of the medical adviser is to get
rid of the fluid as speedily as possible. It may be carried off by means of the
administration of purgatives, or sometimes the kidneys maybe stimulated to
act so as to get rid of the excessive secretion. The purgative usually employed
for this purpose is the Vegetable Laxative Tabloid, which contains, in addition
to Colocynth, Jalap, and Hyoscyamus.
Dyientery . —Dysentery is the form of diarrhoea which attacks people
in tropical climates. It is not contagious, but the mortality from it is very


great indeed. The discharges from the bowels are most offensive, and the
patient usually suffers from excess of griping and straining. The best remedy
is the Tabloid of Powdered Ipecac., and in severe cases five or six of these may
be given to an adult at a dose. As a rule. Ipecac acts as an emetic ; but in
cases of dysentery, it is taken without the slightest difficulty or inconvenience.
The strength of the patient must be maintained in every way, and full doses
of Beef and Iron Wine will be found useful,
Dytpepiia, —Dyspepsia, or indigestion, is one of the most prevalent
maladies of modern life. It attacks people of all ages, of both sexes, and of
all occupations. The symptoms are so well known that they hardly need
enumeration. There is pain at the pit of the stomach following food, flatulence,
feeling of distention, heart-burn, acidity, constipation, alternating with
diarrhoea, despondency, disinclination for work, and other troubles too nume-
rous to mention. Sometimes dyspepsia results from deficient secretion of the
gastric juice, at other times the secretion of acid is excessive. When pain in
the chest after meals is a prominent symptom, benefit will be experienced from
taking the Peptonic Tablets —one or two immediately the pain occurs. For
flatulence, the best remedy is Pure Terebene, ten drops on a small piece of
sugar, every ten minutes or quarter-of-an-hour, until the symptom abates. For
vomiting consequent on taking food, Sub-nitrate of Bismuth Tabloids will be
found useful. They should, if possible, be taken before meals. In very severe
cases it is necessary for'the patient to have his food entirely peptonised, or
predigested, in some artificial manner, such, for example, as by the use of
Compound Zymine Tabloids (Fairchild), or Pepsin (Fairchild). As an acces-
sory measure, change of air, with moderate daily exercise, will be found
useful. Strict attention should be paid to diet, and the bowels should be kept
well open by means of the Laxative Tabloids. Extract of Malt (Kepler) is
useful in maintaining the general strength and health.
Ear-ache. —Ear-ache may arise from a variety of causes, and is often
associated with neuralgia. A useful remedy is a few drops of. Hazeline, on
cotton wool, put into the ear. The more acute pain may frequently be allayed
by giving Tabloids of Quinine —one every two or three hours. Should the pain
be such as to keep the patient awake at night, Tabloids of Dover’s Powder
may be found useful. Local application in the ear of warm olive oil will be
found useful.
Ejiilepsy, —Epilepsy is the scientific name for “Fits.” Seizures of this
kind attack people of all ages. The patient, in ordinary cases, suddenly, and
without warning, loses his senses, falls on the ground, and is violently convulsed.
The duration of the fit varies in different cases. It may last from a few seconds
to twenty or thirty minutes. Sometimes the patient is injured by his fall, and
sometimes the tongue and cheeks are bitten in his convulsive efforts. The
first thing to be done is to prevent the patient from hurting himself. Care
should be taken that the arms and legs are not thrown about and bruised
against the floor or furniture. The patient usually passes into a heavy and
deep sleep as soon as the fit is over. He should be put to bed, kept warm,
and be given a light dietary. The best remedy for this condition is the
Tabloid of Bromide of Sodium, two or three of which should be given three
times a day. This treatment should be continued for three weeks, when the
Elixoid of Bromide of Potassium may be substituted, one teaspoonful being
given three times a day after meals.
Ery«ipels«. —This is known in some parts of England as St. Anthony’s


Fire. It usually comes on suddenly, most frequently attacking the face and
head. The part affected feels hot and burning, and on touching it, it is found
to be sore, stinging, and smarting. The pulse is full and quick; the tempera-
ture is raised; there is considerable headache, and there may be delirium at
night. The condition is undoubtedly a serious one, necessitating skilled
attendance. Probably there would be no harm in administering a good
purgative, such as the Vegetable Laxative Tabloids. Iron is generally con-
sidered to be the best remedy, and it may be given in the form of the Wyeth
Dialysed Iron, in doses of thirty drops every four hours. For restlessness at
night, which frequently accompanies this condition, Bromide of Ammonium
Tabloids will be found most useful.
ffixj»e«4orati©n. —This, like cough, is not a disease, but the symptom
of a disease. It is common to many complaints, such as consumption
and bronchitis. There are many drags which are given for their expectorant
properties—that is to say, to aid in the expectoration of phlegm. Amongst the
best expectorants are Tabloids of Chloride of Ammonium and pure Tere-
bene. The former should be given, one every three hours, whilst the
pureTerebene should be administered in ten-drop doses four or five times a day.
3Ey© - lSs«©ei*®». —There are many affections of the eyes, but most
of them require surgical treatment. For injuries resulting from blows or falls.
Hazeline diluted with three parts of warm water will be found most useful.
It should be applied freely on absorbent cotton (Lawton’s), and will do much
to allay inflammation and remove pain. For foreign bodies in the eye, the
best treatment is to use a syringe with warm water, or, if the speck can be
perceived, it may be removed with a camel’s hair brush or lead-pencil point.
fainting I . —A fainting fit is due to failure of the heart’s action. It
occurs most naturally in young adults, especially in young females. It may
be brought about by any sudden excitement, or any unexpected pleasure or
pain. The patient usually falls down insensible, the face being pale, the hands
cold, and the pulse weak. It is easily distinguished from an attack of
epilepsy, as there are no convulsions. The patient should be kept in a recum-
bent position, the dress and clothes about the neck should be loosened, and
water should be sprinkled over the face. A little Ammonia, or Sal Volatile,
applied to the nose will act as a stimulant, or a bottle of smelling-salts will
serve the same purpose. To prevent the recurrence of attacks, attention must
be paid to the general health ; the condition of the blood should be improved ;
the bowels should be regulated, and plenty of food and stimulant should be
given. One of the most appropriate remedies for this condition is Dialysed
Iron (Wyeth), given in doses of xo drops three times a day. Another
admirable remedy is the Beef and Iron Wine, of which a tablespoonfal
should be given twice a day, preferably at eleven in the morning and four
in the afternoon The Elixoid of Calisaya Bark, in tablespoonful doses, three
times a day before meals, would do much to improve the appetite. Fer
Bravais is also useful.
—Fever is not a disease, but a symptom common to many diseases.
By fever is meant abnormal elevation of temperature. Abnormal elevation of
temperature is registered by the clinical thermometer. The bulb of the ther-
mometer is placed under the tongue for three or four minutes, and if the temper-
ature rises above 100 degrees the patient is said to be feverish. At the same time
the pulse will be quickened, the skin will be hot and dry, the patient will suffer
from headache, the bowels will be confined, and there will be a general condition


of illness. These are the symptoms common to all acute diseases; but, in addition
to these, there will be the symptoms characteristic of the special fever from
which the patient may be suffering. Thus, in measles, there will be cold in
the bead; in scarlet fever there will be a characteristic rash, with sore throat;
in small-pox there will be a pain in the back, with a special rash; in typhoid
fever there will be diarrhoea, with pains in the abdomen. In all these cases
the services of a qualified medical man will be required. During the
initial stage of fever the best remedy is Aconite. A drop or two of the Tinc-
ture of Aconite may be placed in half a tumblerful of cold water, and of this
a teasfoonful may be taken every ten minutes or quarter-of-an-hour for an
hour, and subsequently hourly for five or six hours. The diet should be care-
fully regulated, and should consist entirely of slops. Milk, beef-tea, gruel,
arrowroot, lemonade, soda water, are all useful articles of diet for the sick-
chamber. Sometimes, in cases of defective digestion, it is a good plan to
peptonise the milk and other food before being administered It is hardly
necessary to say that the patient should be kept in bed, that the room should
be scrupulously clean, and that fresh air should be admitted freely.
—See Fainting, Apoplexy, and Epilepsy.
JPSatcleiice.—Flatulence (wind or spasms) is a symptom of dyspepsia.
It occurs most frequently in women, and especially in women who take large
quantities of tea. It corresponds to a condition of general relaxation of the
whole system. Frequently the gas accumulates in the intestine in large
Quantities, so as to cause the patient very considerable distress. There are
many remedies which do good in this condition. One of the best is pure
Terebene (Burroughs’), of which 10 drops should be taken on a piece of sugar
every quarter-of-an-hour, until relief is obtained . Another good remedy is
Pinol, the dose of which is five drops every quarter-of-an- hour. Both these
drugs act as antiseptics, and prevent the further formation of flatus. Care
should be taken to avoid starchy foods, and, as a rule, sugar will be found
injurious. A good substitute for sugar is Saccharine, Tabloids of which may
be used to sweeten the food. In obstinate cases it is a good plan to peptonise
the food before it is taken. When the want of tone in the system is very
marked, Dialysed Iron (Wyeth) may be taken three or four times a day,
until the condition of the patient is improved. Care must be taken that
the bowels are not confined, and the Compressed Vegetable Laxative Tabloids
may be taken from time to time.
Oall-Stone*. —The passage of a gall-stone from the liver into the
intestine is generally attended with acute pain, the sufferer often writhing on
the ground in his agony. The attack usually comes on suddenly, and may
persist for several hours. There are generally symptoms of a collapse The
treatment of this condition is by no means easy. Hot poultices over the liver
and a hot foot-bath will often ease the pain. Morphia will probably have to
be injected under the skin to allay the pain, and the services of a medical man
should be obtained without delay. To prevent a recurrence of the attack, the
bowels should be kept open by the administration of a mild purgative, and
great attention should be paid to the dietary.,
4S-ids3iia©ss. —Giddiness, or vertigo, may arise from overwork, irregu-
larity in living, or deficient action of the liver. The attacks may be slight, or
they may be severe. Sometimes the sufferer feels as if be were going round, at
other times he feels as if things were going round him. There may be deafness,
and, in exceptional cases, there is double vision. When the attack is due to
overwork, rest is essential, but, as accessory treatment, the Elixoid of Bromide


of Potassium may be given, in doses of a tablespoonful three times a day.
When indigestion is the cause of the giddiness, benefit may be experienced
from taking a little Extract of Malt (Kepler) three times a day after meals.
When constipation and disordered liver are the exciting cause, the Vegetable
Laxative Tabloids will be found most beneficial.
Ctont.—Gout occurs in two forms. Thera may he an acute attack, or it
may assume a chronic form. In an acute attack, the pain usually involves the
bone of the great toe, which, on examination, is found to be red, hot, swollen,
and exquisitely tender. The patient is unable to move, and has perforce to
abandon his occupation. The attack may last for a few hours, to ten days, or
even longer. The disease speedily returns, and it often happens that a suf-
ferer from gout experiences three or four short attacks every year. As the fits
increase in frequency, their duration is prolonged, so that in advanced cases the
patient is hardly ever free from his enemy. During an acute attack the patient
is confined to his bed, and the usual treatment is to administer Colchicum. In
the intervals of the attacks, and to prevent the recurrence, much attention must
be paid to dietary, which should be plain and light, with litTe meat food.
Beer, wine, or spirits may, as a rule, be said to be inadmissible. As regards
medicinal treatment, the best remedy will be found in the Carbonate of Lithia
Tabloids, one of which should be taken very frequently, say every two or three
hours. They may be swallowed with a little water, or may be dissolved in
soda water or any other fluid. The Carbonate of Lithia helps to eliminate the
uric acid, upon the presence of which in the blood depends the occurrence of
an attack of gout.
©irssvel.—Gravel may be passed through the kidneys in large quantities,
either in the form of powder, grit, sand, or small stones. When the deposit is
fine, it causes very little pain, but when the fragments are large, it may give
rise to a great amount of suffering. Sometimes thestone remains in the bladder,
where it gradually increases in size, and has to be removed by an operation.
In cases of gravel, the great object is to decrease the secretion of the,kidneys,
and this may be effected by the administration of large quantities of natural
mineral waters, or preferably by taking Tabloids of Nitrate of Potassium, one
or two every three hours. Tabloids of Citrate of Caffeine are also useful for
this purpose, one or two being taken frequently. The liver must be stimulated
to action, and benefit will be obtained by taking from time to time Cascara
Sagrada Tabloids.
Hay JPevor, or Hay Aithma. —This is a spasmodic disease which
usually occurs in the summer, and is due to the inhalation of the pollen of grasses.
The symptoms consist of pain in the head, and running from the eyes and nose,
itching of the lips and nostrils, and persistent sneezing. Sometimes, in addition,
the patient suffers from attacks very like those of Asthma, shortness of
breath persisting for some hours. This condition recurs year after year,
especially about the time that grasses are in flower. It is more common in the
country than in London, but it not unfrequently attacks town-dwellers, the
pollen being wafted in the air across the city. The best remedy for this con-
dition is a sea voyage, but as this is not always obtainable, certain drugs may be
used with advantage. Quinine has been found useful, and may be administered
in the form of Tabloids three or four times a day. The Voice Tabloids may
also be employed. The inhalation of Pure Terebene from a piece of lint
or old pocket-handkerchief, has also been found useful. The Chloride of
Ammonium Inhaler (Vereker’s), charged with pure Terebene, will often cut
short an acute attack.


Headache. —Many kinds of headache are recognised; for example,
nervous headache, bilious headache, congestive headache, sick headache,
and headache which arises from excessive brain-work. Congestive headache
i» usually relieved by a good purge, such as Comp. Cathartic U.S.P. Tabloids.
A. nervous headache must be treated by attention to genera! health. The
Elixoid of Phosphate of Iron, Quinine, and Strychnia may be given three times a
day, and may be followed by a course of Beef and Iron Wine. During the
acute attack benefit is often experienced from giving the Elixoid of Bromide
of Potassium, in tablespoonful doses, three times a day. Bilious headache may
frequently be relieved by giving the Elixoid of Bromide of Potassium, in table-
spoonful doses, three times a day. Sick headache, which is sometimes known
as Megrim, is a very difficult complaint to treat, but Tabloids of Bromide of
Sodium, two or three every three or four hours, will be found useful. Great
attention should be paid to the general health. The underclothing should be
sufficient, and the patient should be well fed, so as to prevent a recurrence of
the attacks.
Hear* Bitease. —Heart disease is a very serious complaint, and many
people who are dyspeptic, or who are suffering from flatulence, think they have
this disease, when the affection is simply a functional one. In those cases of
irregularity of the heart’s action arising from dyspepsia and flatulence, relief
may be often obtained by the administration of Pure Terebene (Burroughs’)
or Pinol. The application of Belladonna Plaster is also beneficial, and
abstention from smoking is especially obligatory. Consult your medical man.
Hiccoug’h. —Violent cases may be relieved by inhalation of Eucalyp-
tus and Pure Terebene, etc.
Hooping: Congh, —Hooping cough is a spasmodic disease very
contagious. It often attacks children in largenumbers. It usually commences
by a common cold, or catarrh, but gradually the characteristic “ whoop ” is
developed, and no doubt is then entertained as to the nature of the complaint.
The patient should be kept in bed, and should be given Bromide of Potassium,
in the form of the Elixoid, the dose ranging from five drops to two teaspoonfuls,
according to the age of the patient. It must be remembered that this condition
will often persist for many months, and great care must be taken, or bron-
chitis may be developed in addition.
Honaemaid’i Knee, —This arises from cold, induced by kneeling on
hard floors and stairs. Rest is essential, but benefit may be experienced by
rubbing into the part affected Lanoline, or other absorptive oils, freely night and
morning. It is an indication not only of local weakness, but also that the
general health is affected. The strength should be maintained by the adminis-
tration of Elixoid of Phosphorus, one or two teaspoonfuls three times a day.
Hydrophobia.—This is a very fatal disease, which arises from the
bite of a rabid cat, dog, or other animal. The limb should be immediately
bound tightly by means of a cord or handkerchief, and the wound should be
sucked vigorously. The services of a medical man should be obtained without
delay, and no temporary treatment is likely to be of the slightest benefit.
Hysteria, or Hysterics. —This complaint occurs most frequently
in young women who have been overworked, or whose general health is very
poor. The attack comes on quite suddenly. The countenance is distorted,
there is quivering of the eyelids or of the eyeballs, there is pallor of the face,
and often a difficulty in taking a deep breath. Hysteria may assume many


forms, but these are the most common symptoms. The remedy which will be
found most useful for this condition is the Bromide of Sodium Tabloids, two
of which should be given three or four times a day. This treatment may have
to be continued for some months.
Endig-estlosi.— See Dyspepsia.
Influenza.—' This is an epidemic disorder, the characteristic features of
which are depression, chilliness, running from the eyes and nose, headache,
cough, restlessness, and fever. It occurs only at long intervals, but the
epidemic is sometimes fatal, especially in the case of old people. Curiously
enough, the disease attacks not only human beings, but horses, dogs, cats,
and other animals. The symptoms are like those of a very bad cold, to which
are added a very unusual depression of strength, and loss of vital energy.
Prostration is always a prominent symptom, and unless the strength of the
patient be supported, a fatal termination may be anticipated. Quinine should
be given freely in five-grain doses, three times a day. The Beef and Iron
Wine should be given in full doses, two or three times a day, whilst Pure
Terebene or Pinol should be used as inhalations.
Intomnia.— See Sleeplessness.
Itch. —This is a troublesome disease, which attacks the hands and
fingers, both of adults and children. The itching is most intense at night, and
unless the nature of the disease be recognised, may continue to increase month
by month, until the life of the patient is rendered almost unbearable. This is
a complaint which admits of a very ready cure. Lanoline (Liebreich) is mixed
with an equal quantity of Sulphur, and this is rubbed into the affected parts,
and after a week’s energetic treatment, the patient usually completely recovers.
Jaundice. —This is a symptom of liver disease. The whites of the
eyes become yellow, the face wears an orange tint, the bowels are confined,
the urine is dark in colour, there is persistent sickness, with great headache
and depression of the spirits. The patient, as a rule, Pas to rest in bed,
the only dietary admissible being peptonised milk, whilst the medicinal
remedy most frequently resorted to is a purgative, such as the Compound
Cathartic U.S.P. Tabloids. In these cases the services of a doctor are
essential.
King*’* Evil, or Scrofula. —This is a disease of a constitutional
nature, characterised by enlargement of the glands of the neck. Sometimes
the enlargement may proceed to the formation of matter, and the general
health may be affected in a very marked manner. The best remedy for this
complaint is the Tabloid Triturate of Sulphide of Calcium, one of which may
be given three or four times a day for several weeks in succession. The
condition of the general health must be maintained by the administration of
Dialysed Iron (Wyeth).
lon of Appetite. —This may be due to general debility, irregularity
in meals, overwork, want of exercise, constipation, and many other similar
causes. Sometimes it is found the patient has no appetite because he smokes
persistently, and especially before meals. Benefit will be often experienced
from taking Tabloids of Quinine, each containing two grains, one three times
a day, before meals. Another good remedy is the Elixoid of Calisaya Bark,
which should be taken in tablespoonful doses three times a day before meals.


liiver, Di»»asei of the. —The liver is subject to diseases of various
kinds. Some of these have been dealt with under other titles. Congestion of
the liver is usually due to want of exercise, and possibly excessive indulgence
in stimulating food. The best treatment is to take more exercise, to ensure a
regular action of the bowels by means of the Vegetable Laxative Tabloids,
and to regulate the dietary carefully.
Lumbago. —Lumbago is a form of rheumatism which affects the
muscles of the back and loins. It is usually due to cold, and often persists for
many weeks or even months, unless steps are taken to effect a cure. The pain
is usually very severe, especially when the patient attempts to stoop down.
Benefit may be experienced by covering the whole of the painful part with a
large Menthol Plaster. Another good remedy is to rub in Lanoline frequently.
Tabloids of lodide of Potassium should be taken three or four times a day.
The bowels should be kept freely open, and flannel should be worn next the skin.
I.r.ng'a, Diseases of the. —The chief diseases of the lungs are
consumption, bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy. These are all accompanied
by cough, expectoration, loss of flesh, and pain in the side. Sometimes there
is a spitting of blood, and sometimes night-sweating is a prominent symptom.
The cough may, in the more chronic cases, be allayed by the administration of
Tabloids of Chloride of Ammonium, or Chloride of Ammonium with Borax.
The pain in the side may be relieved by the application of a Menthol Plaster.
The night-sweating may be checked by taking a Tabloid of Dover’s Powder
the last thing at night before retiring to rest. The progress of the disease, if
not acute, imay sometimes be arrested by the use of the Chloride of Ammonium
Inhaler (Vereker’s), or by constantly inhaling pure Terebene or Pinol.
MCea*le». —This is an acute infectious disease which chiefly attacks
children. The symptoms are too well known to need enumeration. The
disease is not serious in itself, but is apt to be complicated by bronchitis,
pneumonia, and other diseases of the lungs. It is hardly necessary to say
that the complaint is highly contagious, and unless special care be taken, it
will spread to other members of the household. The patient should be kept
in bed, the dietary should be of the lightest possible nature, and the treatment
should be conducted on common-sense principles. During convalescence the
health may be maintained by the administration of a few drops of the Elixoid
of Calisaya Bark several times a day before meals.
melaacbolia. —Melancholia can hardly be said to be a disease, but
when the condition is carried to excess, it assumes a morbid character, which
is known as Hypochondriasis. The people who suffer from this complaint are
excessively anxious about their health, and frequently think they are suffering
from one or more fatal disorders. If any trifling illness should occur, its
importance is magnified until the patient is really in a critical condition, not so
much from the original complaint, as from the peculiarity of his mental state.
This peculiar affection of the nervous system can be relieved by the administra-
tion of Bromide of Sodium, one or two Tabloids being taken three or four
times a day, until the condition is improved. Change of scene, good feeding,
and pleasant companionship are essential for recovery.
M eniitnmtieii. — This function is frequently deranged, especially in
young females. If temporarily absent, a good remedy to give is a Tabloid of
Di-oxide of Manganese. Sometimes the administration of one or two of these
will serve to re-establish the function, but in obstinate cases the treatment
may be continued for some days. They are best given immediately before the


expected period, and it is as well to discontinue them in the intervals,
substituting instead, full doses of Dialysed Iron (Wyeth), so as to maintain
the condition of the general health. Should the function last too long, or
prove excessive, benefit will be experienced from taking the Elixoid of Bromide
of Potassium. Another good remedy for this condition is the Elixoid of
Valerianate of Ammonia, the dose tf which is a tablespoonful three times a
day. Should there be much pa>n at the period, the patient should rest in bed,
be kept warm, have hot-water bottles applied to the abdomen, and should
take a full dose of the Elixoid of Bromide of Potassium.
Megrim, or Sick Headache. —There are several varieties of
megrim, the best known forms being hemicrania, blind headache, and bilious
headache. This complaint occurs more commonly in women than in men, the
first attack often making its appearance about the age of ten. The seizures
usually come on once or twice a month, and may last three or four days,
totally incapacitating the patient from exertion of any kind. Sometimes they
are accompanied by attacks of double vision, and sometimes they terminate
with a sharp bout of sickness. Not unfrequently they are associated with
neuralgia, and many remedies which are recommended for megrim are applic-
able to the treatment of nerve pain. Susceptibility to attacks depends very
much on the condition of the general health. The complaint occurs much
more frequently when the patient is underfed, takes too little exertion, or suffers
from constipation. One of the best remedies for this complaint is Guarana or
Brazilian Cocoa, which should bo given in five-grain doses, three times a day.
Another good remedy is lodide of Potassium, one or two of the Tabloids
of this drug being taken three times a day. Bromide of Potassium Tabloids
two, three times a day, are frequently useful. Chloride of Ammonium does
food, especially when the neuralgic symptoms predominate. Antipyrin
abloids, two, three times a day, often afford speedy relief. Some people
obtain benefit by taking a powerful stimulant, such as a stiff glass of brandy
and water, but this mode of treatment is not to be commended. A cup of
strong tea or coffee in many instances proves much more beneficial. When
the pain is limited to one side of the head, keeping a firm pressure of the hand
or pocket-handkerchief will often prevent the symptoms from extending.
Wenraig’ia.—-Neuralgia, or nerve-pain, may occur in any part of the
body, but the commonest variety is that which attacks the face, and is known
as tic or tic-doloureux. The pain is usually very intense, and may keep the
patient awake many nights in succession. When the pain attacks the arm, it
is generally known as ulnar neuralgia, whilst the same pain attacking the
sciatic nerve of the leg is known as sciatica. Attacks from neuralgia may
persist for many years, the intervals in some cases being long, and in others
short. Much may be done by timely care and attention to ward off attacks of
neuralgia. Diet, regular and homely, exercise, and sufficient amount of sleep,
and the avoidance of badly ventilated rooms, are all points to be attended to.
One of the best remedies to be referred to in cases of neuralgia is Quinine,
this drug being especially indicated when the complaint depends directly or
indirectly on the presence of ague. One of the Quinine Tabloids should be
taken every three hours, until relief from the pain is obtained. When the
patient is pale, and the condition of the blood is below par, Dialysed Iron
(Wyeth) or Fer Bravais, may be given for a few days to begin with. Another
good remedy is Chloride of Ammonium, but it is essential that it should be
taken in fairly large doses, two or three of the ten-grain tabloids every four


hours. Arsenic, sometimes, is highly beneficial, and should be given in the
form of the Tabloid Triturates, one-sixtieth grain, one three times a day.
When the pain occurs in the limbs, benefit may be derived from the application
of a Menthol Plaster. Blisters often do much good, and other counter-
irritants, as they are called, such as Mustard and lodine, are useful. Treat-
ment by means of electricity may have to be resorted to, under medical advice.
MlgHt-ilweaf lag - .— -Night-sweating is generally the accompaniment of
phthisis or consumption. The sweating is often very profuse, so as entirely to
wet the bed-clothes of the patient. The treatment of this condition is not dif-
ficult, and relief may as a rule be speedily obtained. One of the best remedies
is Oxide of Zinc, which should be given in ten-grain doses every night at bed-
time. Another good preparation is the Dover’s Powder Tabloid, two or three
being taken the last thing on retiring to rest. Hypodermic injections of
Atropine are also useful, speedily drying the secretion. When debility is the
cause of the excessive sweating, the administration of a stimulant, the last
thing at night, may be found beneficial, especially if combined with Tabloids
of Bi-sulphate of Quinine. Some people sponge the body all over with Toilet
Vinegar, but this practice is objectionable, as the patient is apt to catch cold
from the exposure.
Obesity. —By obesity, or corpulence, is meant the excessive accumulation
of fat under the skin and throughout the body. This condition is met with in
both sexes, but occurs more commonly in women, especially about the age of
forty, or from that to sixty. The patient, as a rule, has a good appetite, and
takes a great quantity of fluid, although not of necessity in the form of alcoholic
stimulant. Exercise is taken with difficulty, and this tends to increase the
formation of fat. No medicinal treatment is likely to be of much avail in this
condition, but by careful attention to dietary, and by means of a modified
system of Bantingism, the weight may be materially reduced. It is probable
that sugar has a greater tendency than anything else to form fat, and by dis-
continuing the use of sugar, and substituting Tabloids of Saccharin as a
sweetening agent, speedy relief may be obtained.
Offensive Breath. —This is sometimes due to bad teeth, and some-
times to dyspepsia. When the teeth are decayed, a visit must be paid to the
dentist. When dyspepsia is the cause, the Soda Mint Tabloids will be found
useful, or the inhalation of a few drops of pure Terebene from time to time. It
is a condition which can be readily cured by a little attention to the general
health, and especially by avoiding constipation.
Palpitation of the Heart. —Palpitation of the heart may arise
from heart disease or from excessive smoking. It is also a common symptom
of dyspepsia or indigestion. In cases of heart disease the attendance of
a medical man is absolutely necessary. When the complaint arises from
excessive smoking, a milder kind of tobacco should be resorted to, and should
be taken in small quantities. When flatulence, or dyspepsia, is the cause of
the palpitation, relief may be obtained by the administration of Neutralising
(Soda Mint) Tabloids, one being taken every three or four hours. The bowels
should be kept in good condition by the Vegetable Laxative Tabloids. Bishop’s
Granular Effervescing Extract of Nux Vomica is also useful in this condition
by giving tone to the stomach and intestines.
Piles, «r HemorrMd». —Piles occur both in men and women,
not, however, usually until middle age. Their occurrence is favoured by


pregnancy, constipation, and sedentary life, and, above all, by the use or abuse
of irritating purgatives. Sometimes the piles bleed freely, especially at every
motion, the blood lost during the day being sufficient materially to weaken the
patient. In some cases an operation is essential, but in others a great deal
may be done by judicious medicinal treatment. The best remedy for this
condition is Hazeline, applied in the form of a mixture of Hazeline and
Laaoline ; the continuous use of this very agreeable preparation for some days
often effects an entire cure. The Hazeline itself may also be given internally,
in twenty-drop doses, three or four times a day. It is essential that the bowels
should be kept in good order, by means of some simple laxative or electuary.
The diet should be carefully regulated, and the sufferer should abstain, as far
as possible, from taking coffee, pepper, spices, and all stimulating and highly-
seasoned fruit. Stimulants should be resorted to very sparingly. Beer should,
as a rule, be avoided, and only one or two glasses of light claret taken at meal
times. During a sharp attack of piles, the patient should sit for a few minutes
over a pail of hot water, and bathe the parts thoroughly with Hazeline.

•S4.mirß.ay.— By quinsy, or tonsilitis, is meant inflammation of the tonsils.
It is a condition which occurs very frequently in young people, especially from
exposure to cold and wet. The patient usually complains of sore throat, and
experiences a difficulty in swallowing food. At the same time it is noticed
that the skin is hot, the pulse is quick, the face is flushed, there is headache,
loss of appetite, and constipation. On examining the throat, it will be seen
that the two tonsils are greatly enlarged, and sometimes the enlargement is
so marked that they almost touch. After a time matter forms inside the
tonsils, and unless relief is obtained this matter may give rise to very con-
siderable inconvenience. If the treatment of quinsy undertaken early, a
great deal may be done for the patient. A Tabloid Triturate of Tincture
of Aconite, containing one drop, should be given every quarter of an hour for
an hour, and subsequently hourly for five or six hours, until the skin becomes
moist and the pulse is less rapid. Then the Tabloids of Chlorate ot Potash
should be sucked so as to give relief to the throat. The Quinine Tabloids will
be found useful in reducing the temperature. The patient will probably
experience great difficulty in swallowing, and it is useful to give as a food
Peptonised Milk. When the acute symptoms have subsided, and con-
valescence is established, the health will have to be restored by means of
Dialysed Iron (Wyeth).
Relaxed Sore Xhroat. —This is a condition which is very easily
treated. The best remedies are Tabloids of Chlorate of Potassium, or Chlorate
of Sodium with Borax. Chlorate of Potash may be used for three or four
days, and then the Chlorate of Soda with Borax may be substituted. It is
essential that these Tabloids should be allowed to dissolve slowly in the
mouth, so as to act as a continuous gargle. The presence of relaxed sore-
throat is an indication of general debility, and care should be taken to see
that the general health is restored by the administration of a good tonic, such
as Elixoid of Ferro-phosphated Calisaya Bark.
IlheiimatU' Fever, or Acnte Rlienmatism. —This is a disease
which often attacks young people who have been exposed to wet and cold, and


it is a complaint which is very liable to recur. The symptoms consist of pain
in the joints, attended with fever, profuse sweating, and much general weak-
ness. The sufferer is unable to move, and is Vobably confined to his bed for
three or four weeks before being able to get a,.out again. There are several
complications which are liable to arise, especially various forms of disease of
the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other structures. The attendance of a medical
man is imperative. Pending his arr.val, the patient should be put to bed, in a
warm bed between blankets. The remedy most frequently resorted to is
Salicylate of Soda. The Salicylate of Sodium Tabloids, five grains in each,
should be given frequently, say two or three every four hours, until advice can
be obtained. When the pain is very acute, the limbs may be wrapped up in
Lawton’s Cotton.
llheiimaiic d-ont. —Rheumatic gout, or rheumatoid arthritis, is a
chronic complaint, which is often mistaken for gout. It frequently attacks
the hands, so as to incapacitate the sufferer from exertion of any kind. There
are two remedies which are useful in this condition ; lodide of Sodium, two of
the Tabloids being taken three times a day; and Carbonate of Lithia, two or
three Tabloids being administered in water or soda-water at meal times. It
must be remembered that the progress of this complaint is slow, and speedy
relief from the symptoms can hardly be hoped for.
BheomatiMn, CSironic. —This condition is of such common occur-
rence, that any detailed description of the symptoms is almost uncalled for.
The joints are most frequently attacked, the knees, ankles, hips, and shoulders
usually suffering severely. The complaint is aggravated by changes in the
weather, and especially by temperature. The methods of treating this obstinate
condition are many, an indication that there is no specific means of curing the
disease. Turkish baths are useful, and benefit will be obtained from baths
containing Extract of Pumilio Pine. When the pains are much worse at
night, Tabloids of lodide Potassium may be given, two or more, twice during
the day, and two at bed-time. The Tabloids of Salicylate of Soda are also
useful, two or three being taken twice or three times a day. Local rubbing
with Lanoline is recommended, whilst others prefer friction with Hazeline,
In many cases the patient will have to go to Ventnor, Hastings, or some other
warm place for the winter.
Ming’ Worm is due to the presence of a vegetable fungus, known
as Trichophyton. One of the most useful applications is Lanoline Oint-
ment. The patches may be painted from time to time with Tincture of
lodine.— See Saxon’s Everybody’s Medical Guide.
Sin pill rc (Hernia) appears as a swelling, most frequently in the
froin, becoming smaller on pressure, or disappearing altogether on lying
own. A well-fitting and suitable truss should be applied as soon as possible.
It is very common in children and should be attended to at once, as frequent
descent of the rupture makes it more difficult to cure.
Sciatica. —Sciatica is neuralgia of the sciatic nerve, running down the
back of the leg, and is a very painful and troublesome affliction, and without
treatment may persist for years, totally incapacitating the patient. Not un-
commonly it is associated with lumbago, or muscular pains in the loins.
There are many remedies for this condition, one of the most efficacious being
Antipyrin Tabloids, taken three times a day. Sometimes Tabloids of lodide
of Potassium do more good than anything else, and many authorities recom-


mend the administration of pure Terebene orPinol, in doses of ten drops every
four hours. Turkish baths may be resorted to, oj benefit may be obtained
from the Extract of Pumilio Pine Baths.
Sleeplessness.—Sleeplessness may arise from a variety of causes. It
may be due to pain, to restlessness, or to excessive activity of the brain. It is
customary in many cases of sleeplessness to take Morphia, but theadministra-
tion of Morphia, unless under the advice of a medical man, is to be regarded
with suspicion. A better remedy, and one not so likely to be injurious, will be
found in the Bromide of Potassium Elixoid, given in doses of a tablespoonful
or more, the last thing on retiring to rest. Tabloids of Sulphonal have been
found almost a specific for most forms of sleeplessness, and have the advantage
of producing no injurious after effects. Care should lie taken to see that the
room is properly warmed, and that the patient has plenty of bed-clothes.
Sonmambaiisiii. —Somnambulism, or sleep-walking, is a condition
which frequently occurs in young people. It is sometimes associated with
dyspepsia, and sometimes with overwork and anxiety about studies. It will
be best, perhaps, for the patient not to sleep alone, for fear of accident, and to
take at bed-time a full dose of the Elixoid of Bromide of Potassium, say two
teaspoonfuls, or more, according to age.
S®re». —Sores on the skin are generally due to defective circulation of
the part, and are excited by a blow or friction. They have a tendency to
spread so as to form large ulcers. They are by no means easy to cure, unless
the patient will consent to rest entirely in bed. The application of bandages
will often do much good, but more benefit will be obtained by the use of
Hazeline locally, than by any other remedy. The bowels should be kept well
open, and the general health and strength should be maintained by the ad-
ministration of Dialysed Iron (Wyeth).
Sunstroke. —Sunstroke is a condition which is fortunately rare in this
country. In the tropics, however, it is of constant occurrence. The patient
should be allowed to rest in a cool place, away from the sun, and he should be
given water freely. The best remedies, if the patient is able to swallow, are
Quinine and Salicylate of Soda.
Xoothoche. —Toothache may be associated with neuralgia, or may be
due entirely to decay of the tooth itself. Sometimes the pain is inter-
mittent, at others more or less continuous. A few drops of Chloroform on
cotton-wool may do good, or benefit may be obtained from the application of
Creosote to the exposed nerve. Of internal remedies, the most useful are
Quinine, given in the form of the Tabloids, or Elixoid of Phosphorus, one or two
teaspoonfuls three times a day. Hazeline, being antiseptic in its properties,
may be used as a mouth wash.
Ulcer ®t 41»e Stomach. —Ulcer of the stomach is a complaint which
frequently attacks young and delicate women, between the ages of twenty
and thirty. The symptoms are usually well marked and consist of pain at
the pit of the stomach, coming on in sharp paroxysms immediately after
meals, accompanied by vomiting, flatulence, and bleeding from the stomach.
The best remedy in this complaint is Bismuth; the Sub-nitrate of Bismuth
Tabloids, being taken every three hours in a little water or milk. In many
cases of ulcer of the stomach, the food will have to be peptonised by means of
Zymine (Fairchild).


Varicose Veins 1 . —Varicose or enlarged veins are common in middle-
aged people, and are practically confined to the legs. In women they are the
result of frequent pregnancies or of much standing. It is a recognised fact
that women are capable of much less “standing about” than are men. It
would be almost impossible for a woman to do the work of an omnibus con-
ductor, simply because she could not keep on her feet for the requisite number
of hours. A great hardship is inflicted on shop-girls, who are obliged to stand
behind the counter, and are not allowed to rest on a stool, even when not
serving. They soon suffer from a varicose condition or the veins of the legs,
which in a few months incapacitates them from following their occupation.
A great deal may be done in the way of treatment, especially in the early
stages. The bowels should be carefully regulated, so as to avoid the risks of
constipation. An elastic stocking should be worn, which can be procured at
Bailey & Son’s, 38, Oxford Street; their goods can be relied upon. The
patient should sit down when possible, to avoid the strain of standing about,
and should take a teaspoonful of hazeline in a wineglassful of water three
times a day. By the adoption of these measures a cure may be effected, but
progress will be slow, and it will probably take weeks or even months before
any great improvement is noticed.
Vomiting I . —This is a common symptom of Dyspepsia, and occurs fre-
quently in cases of ulcer and cancer of the stomach. It is also a concomitant
of many diseases of the brain. When due to gastric disturbance, the treatment
is by no means difficult. The best thing to do is to give one or two Vegetable
Laxative Tabloids, so as to get a full and free action of the bowels, and then
to follow up with Sub-nitrate of Bismuth Tabloids, every two or three hours,
until the i -ritabie condition of the stomach is allayed.
Warts.—Warts are due to an enlargement and overgrowth of the
papillae of the skin. They are met with very commonly on the hands and
fingers of boys at school, and form unsightly objects. There is a suspicion
that in some cases they are contagious ; but the evidence on that point is
inconclusive. They are apt to increase both in size and in number, and the
Sooner they are got rid of the better. The best plan is to touch them lightly
from time to time with strong nitric acid. They may possibly sometimes
depend on a constitutional condition; but, as a rule, they are strictly local.
There should be no difficulty in getting rid of them entirely in the course of
a fortnight.
