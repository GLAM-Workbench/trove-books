Messrs. Williamson & Musgrovk desire on the occasion of the first
representation in Australia of this great drama, to call the attention of the
public to the significant importance oTHhe production. While the noble
and elevating character of the subjecUmust, of its innate strength, appeal
to all those who think deeply, the mama itself, replete wfith human
interest, forceful in situation, and gloving at every point with vigorously-
drawn character studies, will absorb the attention of all classes, irrespective
of Creed, Doctrine, or Dogma.
Magnificent Stage Pictures by out Foremost Scenic Artists, Gorgeous
and Costly Costumes expressly manufactured for the production, and an
able Company of Artists, will combine in giving a realistic Picture of the
early Christian days. Neither time, rouble nor expense has been spared
on this great production, which, up to the present time has involved an
outlay of TWO THOUSAND POUNDS.

A man in Parramatta was present at the
funeral of a neighbour, of whom no good could
honestly be said. But everybody was saying
something, and this man, not wishing to appear
singular, tut being incapable of lying, remarked
that it was “ a nice, quiet corpse.” He then
turred to a friend and confided in him that the
only medicine he ever kept in the house was
Watson’s Worm Nuts, which never failed yet.

Fortunate Cure of a General’s Daughter.
( From the “ Hampshire Independent. ”)
“ The Hampshire Independent” sent a special commissioner to ascertain the facts in
the following case. His report was as follows . —“ I received instructions to interview
Lieutenant-General Clement E. Shaw, who has won his spurs in India, and is how living with
his family in honorable retirement at St. Paul’s Vicarage, Shanklin, Isle of Wight. “I explained
to the General that I was anxious to obtain some personal explanation as to the narrow
escape I had heard one of his daughters had recently experienced.
“At that he brightened visibly, ‘You must know,’ he said, T’m just a bit of an enthusiast
on this point; but the tale is very short. Nearly two years ago my daughter—the one you
referred to-—came home from India, and when I joined her in London 1 found her ill in
1

bed. She had rheumatic and neuralgic pains ; she was perfectly bloodless, listless, and in a
generally weak and prostrate condition We'called in a doctor, and lam bound to say that
he succeeded in getting her out of bed ; but she was still absolutely colorless, and was in great
wretchedness, and suffering from what I call anemia, or bloodlessness. She had a kind of fever
nervous headache, and other pains. We wentEernbridge, in the Isle of Wight, and there
rst I heard of Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills for Pale People. Indeed, I was recommended to try
khem, and I did so. My daughter took the first box, and they had a marvellous effect upon her.
She regained her color ; she lost her pains, and became altogether different; and after she had
been taking them some time she came in one day after her walk and said to me, “ Why,
father, 1 feel quite a glow through me ” She went on taking the Pills, and lam glad to tell you
at she recovered completely. My daughter’s recovery was due to Dr Williams’s Pink Pills for
B

H
Pale People, without a doubt. Their effects were marvellous, and I did not speak without first
ascertaining the facts. I have had a great deal to do with medical men in this country and in
India, and they laugh at the idea that patent medicines cure any disease. But I have
given you this ease, and that I know; I won’t deal with any beyond my own personal ex-
perience and knowledge, further than to say that I believe the results to have been satisfactory”
Dr Williams’s Pink Pills strike at the root of disease, driving it from the system and
resto;iug the patient to health and strength, They constitute a perfect blood builder and nerve
restorer, curing such diseases as rheumatism, lumbago, sciatica, neuralgia, partial paralysis, St
Vitus’dance, indigestion, etc, They are also specific for the troubles which makes the lives
of so many women a burden, and speedily restore the rich glow of health to pale and sallow
cheeks.
There was a nice girl at Balmain,
Who had a cold on her chest, which can ed her

Gave her a box of Trescott’s Squill Candy.

Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper

It is a whole day’s task for two men to

fifteen feet high.

Culture is dangerous when it reaches

A Count purchased for five francs a

the purchaser has refused an offer of
600,000 francs for the painting.
The reason why birds do not fall off
their perch is that they cannot open their
foot when the leg is bent. If you watch
a hen walking you will notice that it closes
its toes as it raises its foot, and opens
them as it touches the ground.
Full of Ability : Father: “ I would like

Father (enthusiastically) : “ Yes, in-

Mirages.
There are few phenomena in nature so
striking as mirages, whether they take
the form of the palm groves seen across
a desert, as, lor instance, in going through
the Suez Canal, or of portents in the sky
like that wonderful storm-blow figuring
in the three crosses of Calvary, which
forms the frontispiece of Mr. Whymper’s
“Scrambles in the Alps.” A species of
mirage commonly seen across lakes in
fine weather is the Fata Morgana, whereby
diminutive cottages are magnified into
gorgeous fairy palaces, rocks become pin-
nacles, and so on. M. Delebecque has
recently been making an examination into
the causes of this phenomenon, and has
communicated his researches to the
Academie des Sciences. He finds that if
the magnified object ‘be scrutinised
through a telescope it resolves itself into
a number of separate superposed images
which cannot be distinguished by the eye,
Moieover, it may happen that only one
]■ or lion of the object is magnified at a
time; thus he has seen a boat with doub’e
hull and normal sails suddenly transform
itself into a single hull with gigantic
spread of canvas. As many as five
images may be reflected at the same time.
The mirage also occasionally takes the
reverse form, of diminishing objects
looked at. It occurs most frequently
when the temperature of the air is higher
than that of the lake.

There was a masher at Ashfield, who every
one knows,
Bather tall, and inclined to be bandy;
He had a code id’is dose, chilblains on his toes,
And he fixed himself up with Trescott’s
Squill Candy.
A cyclist was in a Scotch village inn
bragging about his abilities as a rider to
such an extent that the publican ventured
to make a bet with him. “ I say, mister,”
said the man, “I’ll bet you half-a-crown
that you can’t ride up and down this road
fill the church clock strikes four.”
“ Done,” shouted the cyclist, and the next
moment he was speeding! up and down
the road, After about three-quarters ©f
an hour’s hard riding up and down, the
cyclist asked one of the bystanders if the
church clock had yet struck four.
“Struck four? No fear,” was the blunt
reply ; “ our church clock never strikes '

The morning drum-call on my eager ear
Thrills unforgotten yet; the morning dew
Lies yet undried along my field of noon.
But now I pause at whiles in what I do,
And count the bell, and tremble lest I hear
(My work untrimmed) the sunset gun too
soon. — R. L. Stevenson.

Why is the Negro Black ?
The pigmentation of the negro is a
question that has long vexed ethnologists.
One of the most curious theories yet
ventilated to account for it, however, is put
forward by Mr. A. H. Keane in “ Ethno-
logy ” (Cambridge Geographical Series),
that “it seems due to the stimulating
action of solar heat, combined with mois-
ture and an excess of vegetable food, yield-
ing more carbon than can be assimilated,
the character being then fixed by heredity.’*
GOLDEN OPINIONS.
i mark thro’ Sunny New South Wales,
As thick as bees in Clover,
Encomiums pass on Golden Meal,
And splendid Meal moreover.
And here upon my fence, I swear,
A further search discloses ;
Pembll’s Wheatena neatly stamped.
Half hidden now by roses.
My little wife’s first venture, made
In mortal trepidation,
burned out a big success, and earned
All round congratulation.
The sterling worth of Pemrll’s MEAL
Shall still assert its power ;
And maximum of excellence,
Their Snow-white Roller Flour.
The Lord Chancellor of England is

The “ gentleman farmer,” so called, has
to put up with many jokes at his expense
in print. In real life he is not often
treated to speeches as amusing as one
which recently came to onr ears. Before
h aving his place for a winter visit to gayer
sen ck, the “farmer” of the anecdote
c.l <. his Hibernian head man and said —
“ Fi\ sin, I have to be away for a fortnight.
1 hupo everything will run smoothly on
the farm.” “ Oh,” said Elynn, heartily,
ye don’t do a bit o’ harm, sir, when
you’re here ! ”

Eor the first time in the history of the
world, the population of the United King-

next year.
The Sinai Copper Mines
M. Berthelot, in a communication to
the Academic des Sciences, describes the
results of an analysis of some ores from
the famous copper mines of Sinai. These
mines were worked by the early Egyp-
tians, and were a frequent cause of wars
at a time when copper was the only sub-
stitute for wood and stones. M. Ber-
thelot finds the ore to be remarkably poor
and difficult to work, probably the reason
why the mines were abandoned two thou-
sand years ago ; but an interesting point
which has been brought to light is that
the ancients practised precisely the same
method of extraction as we do at the
present day—namely, reduction with
charcoal combined with silicious and cal-
careous fluxes.
The sale of Gilbey’s Dry Gin in New South
Wales five times exceeds that of any other
brand, and it is daily increasing in popularity.
It enjoys the same popular call in the other col-
onies, other competing brands being nowhere.

Beer, it is a most refreshing and wholesome
stimulant.

Electric Lighting 1 in Bolton.
The demand for electricity in Bolton
has grown rapidly since its introduction
by the Corporation ; and the recent
adoption of what is known as the Brighton
scale of charges promises to give such a
stimulus to the public demaud that it has
been decided to spend an additional
£BO,OOO on the extension of the works
and plant, The revised scale places the
electric light within the means of the in-
dustrial classes, and before long it is
expected that many working men’s homes
in the town will be lighted by electricity
in place of gas.
