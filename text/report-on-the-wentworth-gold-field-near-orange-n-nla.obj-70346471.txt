EEPOET
ON THE
WENTWORTH GOLD FIELD.
Gentlemen, ?
I beg to present to you my Report on the ? Wentworth
Gold Field/? I have thoroughly inspected the property
which you have acquired the right to examine under an agi ee-
ment entered into with Mr. D?Arcy Wentworth. This
property is situated on the main road leading from Cathuist
to Orange in the colony of New South Wales, distant from
the main line of railway one mile and a half, and contains
the blocks of land shown on the plan attached. As regards
the bulk of the land, it may all be said to be more or less
auriferous, as gold can be obtained from many places by
dish-washing in greater or less quantities. There are, how-
ever, certain places where, from the formation of the ground
and indications on the surface, gold may be looked for with
confidence; and if found, is sure to prove highly remunera-
tive. The first block to which I will call attention is that
marked No. 1 on the plan ; this is before all others so far as
known ?a most important portion of the laud on account
of its position in relation to ground already proven; it has
been named ? Rocky Point ? from the basaltic outcrop ap-
pearing there. It is under this land on the flat between the
creek on the west and the hill on the east, that the first
mining operations will probably be commenced. There
are other portions of the field to which you may also look
a 2


for rich returns of gold, both in quartz and alluvial. In
brief this property appears to contain the following classes
of gold-beaiaug material, viz. : ?-
1. Quartz reefs, containing free gold.
2. Tertiary gravels, holding alluvial free gold.
3. Ancient deposits of gold-bearing gravels, now covered
with basaltic �?��, yielding free gold.
4. Pyriteous mineral, containing gold and silver combined
with arsenical pyrites.
With respect to the third class of deposits. These par-
ticular spots are for the most part what are termed ? runs of
basalt ? and which at one time were doubtless depressions
in the New Country, or, in most instances, water-courses.
These having received the gold washed down from the
degradation of reefs in the vicinity became at that time what
are now in other localities termed ? alluvial deposits.?
But at a period from which no definite date can be assigned,
these water-courses were by the eruptions of volcanoes com-
pletely filled with basaltic lava. These volcanoes are with-
out doubt two mountains called the Couoblas, lying west of
Lucknow a few miles, and rising to a height of some
5000 feet above sea level, and which have all the ap-
pearance of extinct volcanoes, and have by eminent
authorities been so declared. These in eruption have sent
down streams of lava which found its way into the lowest
levels of the country, i.e. the river beds ; thus filling them
up and covering all beneath with a layer of hard cement
from sixty to two hundred feet in thickness. That this was
in a molten state there can be no doubt, and that this lava
ran into what were at that time courses of rivers and creeks,
there can also be no doubt, in proof of this a stone taken
from the bottom of these basalt runs, I mean the stone
immediately overlying the wash dirt, is often pure pumice,
and in every instance shows by its peculiar formation that
steam must have acted on it, and have given it the porous
appearance it presents; the upper covering, being un-
affected by a like cause, settled down and formed into a hard
rock. The existence of a water-course is proved by the


finding of nuts and broken petrified pieces of wood, the
latter similar in character to those now found in the existing
creeks. Owing to their weight and hardness some of the
varieties of wood growing in Australia do not float away
with the stream, but sink and become almost as heavy as
stones. The nuts found, however, have little resemblance
to any now known in New South Wales, though in Queens-
land nuts are now growing not unlike those found under the
basalt; this either shows that these river sides were
furnished with trees bearing these nuts, or that they have
been brought down from other countries by running water.
The specimens of wood came out of the famous Chapel
Hill ? lead and from the outcrop at Rocky Point, and also
some of the small nuts, the other nuts are from the ? Great
Extended ? lead at the Forest, which is an alluvial claim unc er
basalt, continuous with the ? Chapel Hill ? about nine miles
distant. The basalt runs now form the high-lands, and this
is accounted for by the fact that the natural water ways
having been filled up with this hard rock, the water acting
on the softer portions of the land, washed it away, leaving
these hard basalt runs standing higher than any of the other
land in the vicinity. The surface of these runs, when ex-
posed to the atmosphere, became disintegrated, and now forms
beautiful pasture and agricultural lands, though the sides
are generally very rough and covered with loose stones.
The impression is, that in most instances these runs of
basalt overlie what were once the tributary streams of some
large waterway; but in all instances, on these hitherto
worked runs, the dip has led to the conclusion that they
are making for some main water-course not yet discovered.
For instance, the Chapel Hill running from north to south,
the dip in the wash and the breadth increase as it goes to
the south. The Forest ? Great Extended ? dips from south
to north, thus seemingly making for some central water-course
where the greatest development of gold-bearing wash may be
expected to be found. This is so much the case that several
gentlemen have gone in for extensive leases on this same
line of country, i.e. between the Chapel Hill and Forest,


in the hope that as the certainty becomes more clear from
the works now in progress, they may be put in a position
to realize large sums of money out of the leases they now
hold, either by working or sub-letting them. From certain
indications on the face of some of the runs, a pro-
bability of gold being found, or rather ? wash dirt ? being
discovered, is presented ; these indications consist of one or
more signs, such as a spew of gravel, i. e. a lot of small
water-worn pebbles on the surface coming down for some
points on the end of the basalt run. Sometimes pieces of
petrified wood and clinkers lying about show where the
basalt either forced out the contents of the water-course at
the termination of its flow, or that the basalt has, in part,
been worn away, and so laid bare the contents of the bed
into which it originally flowed. The fact of the u wash ?
being gold-bearing is easily ascertained by driving under
the basalt, and cutting across the wash. This may be
barren of gold at first, or contain but a minute quantity
but from the angle at which the wash appears to be dipping,
it can be decided how to go to work. A shaft is put down
on the side of the hill as deep as thought necessary, and a
level driven in, always taking care to rise as you enter, so
as to allow the water to flow behind to the bottom of the
shaft, and so be pumped out after cutting the wash. Should
this be found to present good prospects, but still continue
to dip, you sink your shaft lower, drive in again, and this
time find the level of the bed and gold-bearing wash of
varying depth and quality; this may extend for miles,
though occasionally the basalt comes quite down, forming
a junction with the bed-rock. These beds vary in width
and thickness, and in quality, the best wash always
being found in the centre ?or gutter ? of the old course.
Besides these basalt runs there are other places where it
would be advantageous to explore further. I allude to the
two quartz reefs, No. 11, on the plan, and the lode of iron
ore, No. 15. The former of these appear to contain a
quantity of mineral, and present all the appearance of gold-
boaring quartz, as found in conjunction with sulphides in


Victoria, and in many respects similar to that which con-
stituted the veins in the ? Lucknow lode/' Gold has been
found in the creek at the base of these reefs. With regard
to the iron ore lode discovered during my visit, Mr.
Wilkinson thinks that it is well worth looking into, as, if
any quartz veins were found coming in contact with this
lode, it might resolve itself into another ? Lucknow lode/ 5
and turn to pyrites below, or, as before found, copper
might exist under the iron surface formation. On a sub-
sequent visit, looking into this land closer, and making
further explorations, we discovered a series of quartz veins
on the top of the hill running west right into this lode, of
the right description of quartz. This appeared to us veiy
reassuring, in view of future operations. Before proceeding
with the report proper, I will ask your attention a few
minutes, whilst I explain the prospects and position of the
present mine now in operation.
(( THE NEW KEPOKM MINE,?? LUCKNOW.
The above mine, which is the only one now in work on
the Lucknow Gold Field, is the property of a Company
formed in Melbourne. The Manager, Mr. Henry Newman;
the Underground Captain, Mr. Kelaher. The mine stands on
about twelve acres of ground, leased by the present Company
from the proprietors of the Wentworth Gold Field, for the
period of ten years. On this land is erected at No. 1 shaft
a 25-horse-power engine, with Cornish boiler, twelve stamp
battery, with quicksilver tables, and 24-feet Mundy's
Patent Buddie, improved by Mr. Newman, blanket boxes,
&c. These are all under the one building, excepting the
last named. No. 2 shaft is erected a 15-horse-power
engine, with 25-horse-power boiler and winding and pump-
ing gear. This engine is employed to pump out the mine,
the water in which is required to supplement the dam
which supplies the battery. This engine also does all the
winding for No. 2 shaft. This machinery is also under


cover, and in both cases the houses are constructed of
weather-board and galvanized iron. The No. 2 shaft is
sunk and timbered 300 feet, and from that level a monkey
shaft follows down the Uncle Tom vein to a depth of 450
feet. From the 300 feet level a drive north-west, 234 feet
in length, has been put in, at which distance Mr. Newman
cut the Perseverance Vein, and in driving onwards Mr.
Newman has succeeded in cutting each vein in succession
as they occurred on the surface, namely, ?The Perse-
verance,? ? Hard to find/" and ? Industry? The ? Uncle
Tom ? vein, which has been worked from No. 2 shaft to a
depth of 450 feet, is the vein which originally gave a name
to this property, and from which, up to the pi?esent, the
greatest amount of gold ore has been obtained, though from
the appearance of the ? Perseverance,? just opened up by
Mr. Newman, there is every reason to believe that the
? Uncle Tom ? will no longer hold the premier position.
I personally, under the direction of Mr. Kelaher, had
the opportunity of inspecting the whole of the under-
ground workings in connection with No. 2 shaft, and can
only express my admiration for the accurate manner
in which the ? Uncle Tom ? vein has been traced and
worked from its commencement, under the able manage-
ment of Mr. Newman. The average width of this vein
is from six feet to eight feet, and runs to a length of
forty-two feet in the lode, though subject to variations,
which have hitherto led to the conclusion that where most
confined the ore is richer than in the more enlarged
portions. I also had the pleasure of being the first outsider *
who saw the results of Mr. Newman's accurate foresight
in the drive put in by him with the intention of cutting the
?Perseverance? vein, and which by the firing of one shot
revealed itself by the exposure of a rich vein of ore some
fourteen feet wide and thirty-six feet long on the face, and
from which I obtained pieces of ore. This vein has since
revealed itself to be for its size one likely to prove
extremely rich. From the windlass of the monkey shaft
I obtained a piece of ore from the ? Uncle Tom ? vein at


300 feet level, which I conclude to have been a portion
of a Bonanza. I will here explain this term as used in
connection with this mine. At intervals in the vein the
dyke-stone seems to contract and concentrate itself, leaving
the other portions of the lode immediately in connection
therewith comparatively valueless, whilst its own value in-
creases immensely. When this happens, only so much as
constitutes the Bonanza needs to be removed from the
vein, which will then open out again and become generally
gold bearing as before. This stone from the Bonanzas is
sent home in casks intact, and the results have always
proved it very rich in gold. Mr. Newman, from careful
study, is able to determine, from various indications, the
proximity of a Bonanza, and the indications being pointed
out to me in the ? Perseverance " vein, resulted two
mornings after in the presentation at breakfast of a plate-
ful of sample ore just blown out, and brought up by Mr.
Kelaher for Mr. Newman's inspection, a sample of which
was given me, and will, I believe, prove enormously rich in
gold. On descending the monkey shaft to the 450 feet level,
the Uncle Tom " appeared to maintain its character in
every respect save one, and this the very important point
of all, namely, its gold-bearing property, which seems to
increase in proportion to its depth. This vein is the one
which, if continuous, may be expected to be struck at
from 800 feet to 1000 feet depth on Mr. Wentworth's
land, and which, if so struck, would guarantee the existence
of all the veins operated upon by the Reform and others,
and which would similarly be operated upon in Mr. Went-
worth's land, namely, by driving levels to cut the veins as
cut in the ? Reform ? and working up the backs. The
? Reform mine" in its lowest levels is wonderfully dry,
and the only water to contend with is that met with in the
shallow levels, and which with care could have been in a
great measure avoided, but which is all required for work,
and easily under control with engine-power.
I would here like to put you in possession of some
facts connected with this ? New Reform Mine," which


I heard of when out in New South Wales, which will tend
to prove to you its value, and the value of property adjacent
thereto. Eleven years ago, after all the surface alluvial
had been worked to varying depths, and the lode had be-
come too hard to work with pick and shovel, a company
calling itself the fc Old Reform,? acquired a right to seven
veins, ? The Perseverance,? ? Hard to hud,? ? Industry,?
and three others, besides the ? Uncle Tom.? This company
resolved itself into the ? Great Britain/? which was then
floated with a capital of 60,000/., and called the ? Uncle
Tom Mine.? This last company added to their estate by
sinking the present main shaft 300 feet. Owing to
mismanagement this company was wound up. Mr. Newman
then bought the property for 1800/., formed a company with
2000/. shares; started with a 200/. capital, and in three years
he had paid his shareholders 35,000/. in dividends. The
mine and machinery were then sold for 40,000/., and the
" New Reform ? floated with a capital of 60,000/., most of
the original shareholders taking their value in scrip, Mr.
Newman being appointed manager. All improvements have
been paid for; new ground opened up; new veins cut in the
lower levels, with a large amount of ? backs ? to work upon.
Other veins remain to be cut to the same level, and those
veins which outcrop beyond the boundary of the ? Reform ?
?north-westwards?may eventually run into the Reform
ground, and both they and the Reform veins into Mr.
Wentworth?s land. The tramway, 264 feet in length, has
also been constructed and paid for, as well as the new
buddle, four heads of stampers, and sheds, and only 12s,
called up on the 1/. shares. This last company started in
December, 1881. I herewith append a schedule of returns
for the ?New Reform,? dating from December, 1881, to
December, 1883 :

Taking the number of tons and their ascertained values, we
get, with the free gold, a return on the average of something
over 4227. per ton. This average is based on the returns of
the first year?s work. There remains some 34 tons of ore
since shipped, the returns of which, except in one instance,
had not come to hand. Taking the same average per ton as
above, we get a value for 34 tons of ore = to 14,348 Z., to-
gether with two Bonanzas, 850 1, which makes a total for the
two years of 47 tons, 18 cwt. ore, of a value of 20,212 1. + Bo-
nanzas, BbOL ; free gold, 492 1.; total value, 21,554 Z. Some
500 tons of stone at grass which, taking only 5 per cent,
of ore per ton of stone = 25 tons of a value of 10,5007,
total yield of ore =72 tons, 18 cwt. of a nett value of 32,1047.
The value of the other products from the ore being sufficient
to pay all transit and agency charges. There are now 31 1
hands employed on the mine, including the manager and
underground captain; and the expenses for the above,
together with incidentals, amount to 4007. per month. Be-
sides these, there is a local committee, a board of directors,
and a legal manager.
The system pursued in the Reform Mine leaves little room
for improvement. A great deal more could be done by
opening up lower levels, having a larger staff of men at
work, with adequate battery and buddle machinery. As
regards the means employed in working the monkey shafts
and drilling the holes for blasting, and crushing the stone,
a considerable improvement could be effected by employing
machinery suitable for those purposes. The ore is con-
veyed from the vein to the bottom of the shaft in small
wagons (running on a tramway) capable of carrying from
6 cwt. to 7 cwt. a piece. These are run into the cage, and
on reaching the mouth of No. 2 shaft, they are again run
out on to a small tramway which connects the No. 2 shaft
with the battery at No. 1. The trucks are run along this
tramway to No. 1, where they are tilted, and any ore par-
ticularly rich is picked out by Mr. Newman himself and
1 Twenty miners, blacksmith, engineer, carpenter, engine-drivers, battery-
feeder, blanket-washer, buddleman, oremau, manager, incidentals.


placed on one side, to be shipped intact with the bonanzas;
the rest of the stone is broken with a hammer by the feeder
which supplies the battery. The refuse stone from the
headings is tipped over and forms a heap at the base of
No. 2 shaft. The stone, when crushed, runs from the
battery over quicksilver tables, and thence into the receiver
of the huddle. The refuse tailings are taken from the
huddle through a shoot, and run over blanket-boxes, but
so slight is the loss of ore by this huddle process, that Mr.
Newman believes there will not be sufficient results from
the washing of the blankets to pay the 30.5. a week to the
man in charge of the boxes. Since writing the above I
learn that from 30 tons collected and reduced to two casks,
about 10 cwt., from assays made it was shown to contain
only 1 oz. 19 dwts. 8 grs. gold, and 9 oz. 8 grs. silver, per
ton of concentrated ore. This huddle was one of Mundy?s
patent, improved according to Mr. Newman?s own direction,
and put into position by that gentleman, and works with
great evenness and regularity. After the material is
taken from the floor of the huddle, it is put into a shallow
box, built over the boiler, in which it is dried; it is
then sifted into a receiver chest, and from this chest is
run out into the casks, and as it comes away the man occa-
sionally puts a pinch into a box at the side of the cask, from
which are made the assays requisite for insuring the ore.
Since writing the above, and whilst waiting for a settlement
of the matter re ? Golden Point,? Mr. Newman, following out
the system he has hitherto pursued, has further proved the
permanency of those veins cut in the upper levels. After
cutting the ? Perseverance,? as before mentioned, he came
across the ? Hard to find,? in its expected position ; he
continued driving on the line of junction, and thought to cut
the ? Industry ? within a few feet; this he has done, and that
within 9 inches of the expected distance. He was anxious,
knowing that I was desirous of getting the land adjoining
under offer, not to have to publish these facts until I was
secure, and he went on with the drive ; he tells me the ? In-
dustry ? in this lower level is simply magnificent; that he


never saw equalled stone such as appeared on the face of
the vein when opened, and he was good enough to allow me
a few of the less valuable pieces to bring home to show
you,?some of which were taken from the bottom of the
upper level, and others from the lower, just opened. These
are useful for comparison, and show the persistent richness
of the veins, and he has agreed to allow of these being
assayed for your guidance, provided I return the results in
bullion.
" Golden Point.?
The " Golden Point ? base occupies an area of something
over 15 acres, and embraces ten of the original claims,
i.e. from 1 to 10 in Mr. Newman?s report to the Under-
secretary for Mines, 1881.
On this property the greatest depth has been attained on
the whole of the gold field, they having followed the
" Homeward-bound ? vein to a depth of 500 feet. On this
property is erected a 25-horse-power beam engine, with
pumps of 5-inch diameter, and 50-horse-power boiler. The
main shaft is timbered 200 feet; from this level the mine
was worked with two monkey-shafts; their operations have
been confined to working out the " Homeward-bound ? vein,
which underlay in this property from the claim adjoining.
Stone from its lowest level has proved equal to any ore
found on the estate, and was left in rich gold at their
boundary ; owing to a want of knowledge on the part of
those in charge at the time, over 60 feet of the " Home-
ward-bound ? vein has been left unworked?so I have been
told, ?which could be taken out immediately operations were
started. This ground being taken up with a view to
secure as much as possible of the lode, they could only follow
the " Homeward-bound ? vein to their boundary. From
the bottom of the 200-feet shaft, a level, driven similar to
that in the Reform, would work "Spicer?s,? "Golden Point,?
a portion of the " Homeward-bound,? and u Morning Star;?


then with the monkey-shaft off this level (to be worked,
if thought fit, with a monkey-engine in an excavation, or
continuous wire rope from shaft, instead of windlass) these
veins would all be able to be worked to any depth. The
(t Shamrock,? another claim on this same ground, was
worked to a depth of something over 120 feet; the shaft is
in good condition and ready to start work upon, imme-
diately the water is taken out, which has accumulated from
surface-soakage. From this shaft, with a 12-horse-power
engine, could be worked ? Snobs,? ci Melville's Crinoline,?
and ? Golden Gate.? None of these claims, included in the
? Golden Point,? have been worked down as much as 150
feet, save and except the ? Golden Point? shaft working on
the underlay of the ? Homeward-bound ? vein. So that
this shaft being 200 feet deep, and none of the claims being
worked to 150 feet, would leave from a level driven in over
50 feet of backs to work up; but as the underlay is at least
as three to one, this would leave the backs from 150 feet to
200 feet to be worked out. At the mouth of this ? Golden
Point ? shaft is an immense heap of mullock or refuse stone;
but so careless were they when working, that they have
thrown out stuff that would go many ounces to the ton,
and I myself, having overhauled this heap, found in a few
minutes, whilst it rained, beautiful samples of ore-stone and
one specimen showing gold freely,?some of which I have
with me; this heap would well repay, I believe, to pick over in
slack time for crushing, or sending home in bulk. Also at
the mouth of the ? Shami?ock ? is a heap of refuse wash,
some 1000 loads or more, which, when gold was plentiful,
was very indifferently treated - so Mr. Newman assures me,
from trials he has made by dish-washing,?and which would
well pay to crush, if a battery was erected in connection
with any part of the Company?s property. As I hope
shortly to have to refer to this lease in connection with the
? Wentworth? property, I will proceed with my report of
the Syndicate's land.


Kooky Point.
We come now to the first portion of the Wentworth
property under offer to the Syndicate, and this has been
named ? Rocky Point/? and is that part referred to in Messrs.
Wilkinson and Newman?s reports. From my plan of the
estate, you will be able to notice its position with reference
to the ?New Reform ? and other claims. It is the block
marked No. 1, and it is at the base of this basalt lead that
Mr. Newman would recommend sinking a shaft, in such
a position as would insure us striking the ?Uncle Tom?
vein, at from GOO feet to 800 feet or thereabouts, and which
if found would at once guarantee the existence of all other
veins cut in the ? New Reform ? and other claims beyond.
A basalt lead here outcrops, which lies N.N.E. of the famous
?Chapel Hill? lead, distant about 200 yards, and runs
N.N.E, and S.S.W. At the base of this lead, on the
western side of the hill, north, ten chains from the ? Reform ?
is a strong quartz outcrop running, so far as could be
determined from a surface examination, north-east and
south-west, the dip not known. This reef is similar in many
respects to the reefs on the opposite side, and may possibly
form one of a number running down the face of this hill,
as did the reefs on the opposite side, until they struck
the serpentine, where they at once became gold-bearing
in a wonderful degree (vide formation of reef as per
plan).
The massive quartz outcrop spoken of by the Rev.
W. B. Clarke cuts this at right angles, and this inclines one
to the belief that this reef really is the head-centre of an
immense deposit of gold, seeing that all veins yet discovered
and operated upon make direct for this reef, and all veins
showing on the surface on the other side also bear down on
to this main outcrop, so that not only might we expect to
cut those veins already worked on the ? Reform? side, but we
might also hope to discover new veins gold-bearing, and


even another lode of the same red ore which proved so rich
at the junction of the quartz with the serpentine.
This has to a great extent been borne out by a vein
struck on ? Jackass Flat,? which was very rich in gold.
This being the only quartz vein tried on the eastern side of
the serpentine. On the point of this basalt lead, facing the
? New Reform ? and ? Chapel Hill,? Mr. Newman, shortly
before our visit, drove a short tunnel of from 15 feet to 20 feet,
and found wash-dirt of a nature sufficiently payable if it
could be treated by the same machinery employed in other-
wise developing the estate. The breadth of this wash was the
breadth of the lead, some 300 feet, and a thickness of from
C inches to 3 feet. He believes it would much improve in
opening up, as has always been the case in like undertakings,
I was anxious personally to prove the value of the wash, and
went with bucket and dish to prospect the dirt lying at the
mouth of the fallen-in tunnel. Mr. Newman first washed three
dishes, which I have kept just, as he left them in the bottom
of the dish. I then washed four dishes myself, and, though
this was my first attempt, I managed to save the gold, which
I will show you among my collection of specimens. Mr,
Newman cautioned me strongly from persuading you or
allowing you to think that all the wash was of an equally
auriferous nature, as he said this was some of the best he
had found, it had been exposed, since taken out, to the
weather, and most likely sand and mud had in a degree
been washed away. The dishes washed from the surface
did not show such good results as my bucketful taken from
the lower layer. Mr. Newman's plan in embryo is this : to
erect on the site marked on the plan a 25-horse-power
engine and good 30 to 56-horse-power boiler, battery with
ten head of stampers, quicksilver tables, &c., to commence
sinking the main shaft, working it with the engine, in the
meantime putting through all wash obtained from the hill,
which he believes will prove a material help in paying
expenses; then, directly any stone was obtained showing
ore or free gold, so soon would returns come to hand and
the appliances be altered to suit the circumstances. Mr,


Newman expects to cut other gold-bearing stone before be
reaches the ? Uncle Tom ? vein; in fact, he says there is no
knowing what this might lead to, with gold all round and
splendid gold close at hand; and in the alluvial it might
prove a repetition of the ? Homeward-bound.? I saw myself
that no effort had been made to test this ground beyond
driving this one tunnel, and I can assure you the prospect
derived from a view of the ground, and known quality of
exactly similar ground on the other side of the road, leads
to the conclusion that the geologists, Messrs. Clarke,
Wilkinson, and others, are right in their surmises, as
expressed at various times, with reference to this land; and,
beyond all these theoretical opinions, comes Mr. Newman?s
practical experience. Indeed, his whole work has been
a continual verification of the theories propounded by
the Eev. W. B. Clarke, and supported by others coming
after him; indeed, I feel sure, from conversations I have
had with Mr. Wilkinson, that he thoroughly inclines to a
belief in this turning out as has been predicted. The appear-
ance of this basaltic outcrop I found similar in every respect
to the ? Chapel Hill ? lead, rough masses of basalt, together
with fossil-wood and clinkers, being plentiful, in fact, just
what has always hitherto indicated gold-bearing leads, these
clinkers being a particularly good sign, as they are the same
formation as those which, where found in combination with
the ferruginous ore in the ? Lucknow ? lode, proved so rich
in gold. The fossil-wood and quantities of fine, water-worn
gravel, similar to that in my specimens, shows what they
term a ? spew ? from under the basalt, and which ? spew ?
induced Mr. Newman to try, as he before has, for wash-dirt,
and as he has previously tried and been successful, as I
shall have occasion to point out in another place.
The position where we propose to put the shaft would, I
consider, be a favourable place to operate on with the
diamond drill, not with the idea of actually striking the
veins, or otherwise finding gold, but simply to discover
whether at from 600 feet to 800 feet the serpentine and diorite
could bo met with in conjunction similar to that in the ? New


Reform/* which I would take to be conclusive evidence of
the existence of the same formation of veins as in the higher
levels of the ? Reform** and ? Golden Point.** Our calcu-
lations are as follows : main shaft to 1000 feet deep, 10 feet
by 3 feet, divided into three compartments, one for pumps
and ladder-way, two for cages, well timbered throughout; if
through the same ground as ? New Reform ** shaft (but
which from indications may be easier), we to do the lifting
with engine-power, not more than 3000 Z. 25-horse-power
engine, 30 to 40-horse-power boiler, battery and ten head
of stampers, quicksilver tables, 24-feet Mundy?s patent
buddle?prices of these items can best be arrived at at
home. Shed for engine, boiler, battery, &c., 150 Z. to 200 Z.
Shaft appliances, wire ropes, cages, poppet-heads, pump,
6-inch diameter?these also can be priced by home firms.
All brick and wood-work done by the best men at lowest
prices for Mr. Newman, who approves of day labour rather
than contract work, so that any amendments he may con-
sider requisite can be effected without invalidating the
contract or causing any dispute, and the whole work receives
his personal supervision.
Golden Point in Conjunction.
So far we have treated of the mining proper as contemplated
in the Syndicate?s land; there now remains the rest of the
land, which is mostly deep alluvial in its character, although
there are one or two places, to which I will call your atten-
tion as we follow through the Report, which are not likely to
prove alluvial. But first I would put before you, gentlemen,
a most important matter which has given me a consider-
able amount of trouble and anxiety to arrange. I have made
mention in a previous part of this Report of a property in the
hands of a company which adjoins the Reform Estate, called
the ? Golden Point.** This is a lease of 15 acres, or there-
about, for twenty-one years, beginning in July, 1872, free
from rent, royalty, or working conditions of any kind what-
ever, taken up, as I have said, along the line of lode?there


remains nearly nine years to rnn. From this property
immense quantities of gold have been taken when they
worked out the ferruginous brown lode down to the level of
the pyrites, but here they stopped for various reasons ?want
of capital, want of tenure, quality of the ore being too diffi-
cult of treatment for ordinary miners to make it pay, besides
the enormous expense of taking it to any market, there being
no railway in those days ; the influx of water also being
greater than they could contend with by manual or horse-
power and rude appliances. So the various claims were
abandoned, and the land taken up by a company which erected
engines, &c., and sunk a shaft with the intention of cutting
the ? Golden Point ? vein, which on the surface had proved
enormously rich. They put down a shaft 200 feet, but in al-
together the wrong position. As luck would have it, they
came on to the ? Homeward-bound? vein on the underlay
from Chapel Hill. On this they worked, and followed it
down with the monkey-shaft to a depth of 500 feet, when,
by reason of having come to their boundary, they were com-
pelled to abandon any farther work on that vein. The stone
last taken out was of surprising richness Mr. Newman tells
me. This mine must have been mismanaged by those in
charge, as a quantity of splendid ore-stone has been care-
lessly thrown on the mullock heap, as I have before said.
They also lost great sums at various times, besides leaving
CO feet of the vein unworked; and, not having sufficient
capital, and their work and money having been expended
on what was now, as they supposed, a profitless shaft, they
seemed to have come to a conclusion their only course w r as
to retain the lease till it was sufficiently valuable to sell to
some advantage, never thinking, it appears, of trying any
of the other veins, presumably because they were filled in,
or thought to be useless. That was owing to the fact that
those in charge were new to the country, and had not seen
it developed as had Mr. Newman. He has often in days
gone by, both in this and other cases, tried to give those in
charge the benefit of his advice and experience, derived from
being long on the ground, knowing each peculiarity, and


having had the very valuable assistance of his friend, the late
Rev. W. B. Clarke, who was a frequent visitor at his house,
and who took such an extreme interest in the pjculiar for-
mation of the ? Lucknow ? lode.
But all he could say was of no avail. Those coming from
California and Ballarat thought a young man ill suited to give
advice to their more matured experience ; but that experience
did not serve them in a formation which varied so much from
all known gold reefs. Thus many thousands were spent on
this ground uselessly, and no results obtained; and the place
got an ill name as being worked out. It was then that
Mr. Newman bought the ?Reform/? on which considerable
sums had been expended, and with what results ? He paid
each shareholder of ten shares, in three years, dividends
amounting to 3500 Z.; and for a property he purchased for
ISOOI, and made into a company of 20001, he realized at
the end of the three years, after paying the above dividends,
25,000 Z.; and so sure was he and the other shareholders of
the value of this mine, that they converted the whole of
their payment into scrip of the new company. I have given
you the returns for the two years? work, and stated the
disadvantages they work under.
But, to return to the ? Golden Point ? property. When at
? Lucknow ? I of course heard all particulars of this property,
when it occurred to me to try if I could not get this under
offer for the Syndicate. I got from Mr. Newman all the
information I required, and found he had often wished to
get the matter into his own hands, but that so soon as they
knew he was after it the price went up, and until lately,
through unfortunate speculations in trade, Mr. Newman has
not been in a position to lay out a large sum privately; but
he told me of the wonderful veins lying hid, and now, for
the most part, forgotten in the ground. He told me that
in the ? Shamrock ? he has seen stone which, if hammered
on an anvil, adhered together, so thickly was the gold dis-
tributed throughout it. He said if there was that one claim
to go to work upon, he could begin, as soon as the water
was pumped out, to get good gold ore, and, judging from


the stuff taken from the top of tlie vein, and the comparison
afforded by other veins ?? Uncle Tom,? ? Perseverance,?
? Hard to find,? and ? Industry,? all of which have been
explored, as I have before stated?he felt confident that
magnificent ore would be obtained from the ? Shamrock.?
The men who worked the ? Shamrock? claim have since told
Mr. Newman that they left with splendid gold on the bottom,
being driven out by the water. Of the other veins he has
spoken in the reports we received before I left England y
and he tells me he is prepared to maintain the same now.
There is, besides, a heap of wash-dirt previously mentioned
by me, which he says would pay splendidly to crush again,
judging from trials he has given it. There also remains
some 120 feet of the line of original lode still untouched.
There may be another quartz vein in this, only waiting to be
found, where we should get free gold down to the pyrites.
From all I could leaim from others, and examinations made
of the ground, seeing the machinery was good and in fair
order, it seemed to me that if we could get this into our
hands, our property on the other side of the road would be
vastly enhanced in value, and we should have our machinery
ready on the spot to take across bricks to build with, and
sufficient for the chimney-stack as well. So I mooted the
matter to Mr. Newman, and he said, ? I was only wondering
if you would grasp this splendid prospect without my saying
anything.? I then went to work at once, with the result
that 1 have now got it under offer from the man who, I
believe, has purchased it as a speculation from the original
company. I assisted the settlement by saying that if he
sold to me, he should have the option, by purchase of three
shares of 300 Z. apiece, to be allowed to join any syndicate
taking the matter in hand; and in the event of the original
Syndicate accepting the offer, that he should share in the
benefit of the other land.
After much trouble I succeeded in getting a great re-
duction in his price, and better terms than I had hoped.
He knows the ?Reform? mine, being a shareholder, and he
has watched its development, having great faith in it, but


when the matter was being settled he was ignorant of the
fact of the ? Industry ? and ? Hard to find ? having been
cut in the low levels, nor could he guess what stone it
would produce, which as Mr. Newman wrote me to say, was
far richer than any submitted to me, so much so that in
the interest of his company he could not allow it to go to
England other than by the authorized manner, and fully
insured by the legal manager, though he has taken upon
himself to send home the samples I show you, it being of
use to the present company, by having an independent
assay made, if so you wish. When I told him what I had
done, he was delighted, and said, ? in the event of a refusal
being telegraphed, he would be prepared to buy the property
himself? (having lately inherited a considerable fortune by
the death of his father). We sketched out a plan of
operations in view of your accepting the offer. To take the
engine and all belonging to it across to ? Rocky Point,
use the machinery in sinking the new shaft, set up a battery
with ten head of stamps, and begin on the alluvial above;
in the meantime erect a 13-horse-power engine at the
<< Shamrock,? using the pump now on the ? Golden Point,?
and work from the top down on the vein, run the stone on
a 'tramway, or wire rope, from the ? Shamrock ? to the
battery at ? Rocky Point,? and so begin getting gold at
once. I think with this land at our back we should have a
magnificent property to place on the market. If in sinking
the main shaft on ? Rocky Point ? we came on gold sooner
than anticipated, as we might in the matter of quartz reef,
we should at once pay largely; but, even if the shaft has to
go from 700 feet to 1000 feet, I think there can be no
doubt, from the way in which all other veins are proved to
be going in a true direction, and increasing in richness, that
we shall cut them in our land, and, as the Rev. W. B.
Clarke says, in value far exceeding anything hitherto found.
If this proved correct we should have to work it, not as cue
gold vein, but as the lodes in a copper mine. Mr. Newman
tells me he has advocated most strongly, in his half-yearly
reports, that he be allowed to sink another shaft in the


? Reform ? ground, or continue in the present one to a
lower level, and so have a succession of levels working day
and night on the various veins, so as to make use to the
full of the remainder of their lease ; he was only waiting for
the proof of a continuous run of one or two veins to make
a certainty with regard to the formation, and the ? Per-
severance,? ? Hard to find,? and ?Industry? have now
put all doubt beyond question, establishing the fact most
clearly in combination with the ? Homeward-bound ? and
? Uncle Tom.? To show the value of this lease under
offer, I may tell you I have tried to make terms with those
who own the property on which are these two leases, and
one or two other veins, and though there are these two
important blocks alienated for ten years to come, they refuse
to put the land under offer now at any price, even for three
months, and they, through their manager, talk of nothing
less than 100,00GZ. as a possible price. They paid a large
sum originally for the property; they get no rent from the
two leases mentioned; they have made nothing out of the
place up to the present; they have to lose the interest on
their purchase money, yet they value it so highly they will
not give an opportunity to any one to work it on any reason-
able terms, and yet, should the veins prove continuous,
they must all run clean out from this land into the Syndicate
property. This tends to show the value of the lease I
have put before you, and which will, in combination with
Mr. Wentworth's land, make a magnificent property if
thoroughly developed. I would not put this matter before
you, did I not fully believe in it myself, had I not got all
the information possible to support my statements; and I
shall be willing to explain all matters to any requiring in-
formation, and show the specimens I have, and their rela-
tions to one another, and I hope be prepared to answer any
questions asked with reference to this matter. I have only
mentioned the ? Shamrock ? as being ready at once to
commence operations upon, all the other claims on the plan
are also proven {vide Mr. Newman's report to Under-
secretary for Mines), and it will entirely depend upon how


the matter is looked at by you as to how much work should
be done in developing each and all of them on the lower
levels. Mr. Newman would wish to follow down the
? Shamrock ? to prove the course of the vein, so as to allow
him to judge the position and dip of others on both sides.
You will see that the machinery alone is worth a considerable
sum, as well as the two shafts, both in good order. It will
be possible, in the event .of good ore being found, to stack
all that could not be worked off on to our own ground, and
so enable us to take out a large quantity, and so retain the
value in the land after the expiration of the lease. I feel I
can do but scant justice to this matter, the formation being
one of unusual value, and, so to speak, unique in every
way; but I have tried to put all fairly before you, so far as
strict observation and careful inquiry could assist thereto,
and though from having seen the place I may have stated
that which you think hardly justifiable from the tenor ol
this report, if you will point out to me any statement which
appears overdrawn I will do my best to explain it.
This ? Golden Point,? if worked in conjunction with Mr.
Wentworth?s land, would give to the shareholders a cer-
tainty to begin work upon, and with capital could be opened
up to pay at once. The work could still go on in the new
ground, and the crushing from the ? Golden Point? ore
would repay the cost of excavation and the opening up of a
magnificent property which would last for ages. One of
the great securities about this speculation is that the actual
results would be under the control of the home people, as
all the ore must be sent home to be treated before it can bo
of use ; and, except the small quantity of free gold caught
on the tables (which are immediately under the manager?s
eye), there is nothing of value to any one in the colony,
whereby it differs so materially from ordinary quartz
mining.
No. 2.
This basalt lead is to all appearance the continuation of
No. 1, and runs at the base of this hill. I found clinkers


and petrified wood, together with a spew of wash 2 similar to
that found on ? Chapel Hill,? and to that taken out of the
claims, the same also as found on No. 1. Mr. Newman
considers this would be worth prospecting, provided No. 1
was operated upon in the way proposed, and he considers
that 150 Z. to 2001. would be sufficient to spend in proving
this lead by sinking a shaft on the side of the hill and
driving to cut the wash, and he considers that a shaft 80
feet deep would accomplish this.
No. 3.
Basalt lead lying east of the ? Reform? mine, supposed by
Mr. Wilkinson to be a continuation of the ancient river-bed
which forms a junction with the ? Chapel Hill? lead {vide
Mr. Wilkinson's report, p. 7). Mr. Newman, however, is of
opinion that no connection exists between these two points
for these reasons: that on the south-west point of this
lead, on about a level with the basalt formation opposite,
there is a strong outcrop of diorite, and the basalt over-
lies this, but at a considerable elevation compared with the
basalt lead of which Mr. Wilkinson considers it a continua-
tion, but I was unable to prove, from levels taken, the
accuracy of either statement. Also on the western side of
this hill, facing No. 1, we found a spew of water-worn quartz
and clinkers, and from the appearance of the basaltic out-
crop on this side of No, 3 and the east side of No. 1, to-
wards which the spew from No. 3 was trending, we
were inclined to think that at one time a connection existed
between these two lines of alluvial.
No. 4.
This basalt lead which lies due east from the ? Reform ?
about three quarters of a mile, and adjoining Redman's boun-
dary, distant about 150 yards, presents very favourable in-
dications for further prospecting. There has been a trial of
about two days' work put in here, in the shape of a trench
2 Mr. Newman, wishing to try the ground, had five holes put down, and
got good colours at a depth of from 5 feet to 8 feet.


driven into the hill on tlie surface in a S.S.W. direction,
which discovered asbestos and lime with serpentine, which
forms the main outcrop on the ground, and the only out-
crop of serpentine, as far as I could find, on the Wentworth
estate. The formation is similar to that in the ?Reform? lode.
Veins of carbonate of lime are also cut in this prospect,
which are the same as indicate rich stone in the Reform.
Mr. Newman considers it has been driven in a wrong direc-
tion, and would advise the cutting of a trench 5 feet wide
and 4 feet to 5 feet deep, so as to cross-cut to the water,
which he believes to exist either on the one side or the
other, and in doing which would discover any quartz veins,
as there are none outcropping on the surface, such as were
followed in other instances on the ? Reform ? property, and
such as were the chief indication of gold in every instance.
Mr. Newman is disinclined to look with much favour on this
prospect, though he admits that veins have been found to
exist under the soil and never outcropped, and have been
discovered only by sinking, therefore they might be cut in
the proposed trench or indications found to lead thereto;
he thinks, however, that 100 Z. spent here would not be
wasted, and if the indications were favourable a further
outlay might be incurred. The strong indications of
asbestos lead to the belief that a vein of this substance
might be discovered. Colours were obtained from the trial on
the surface, and on making a strict survey on the hill we
came across broken quartz of the right description, which
must undoubtedly be derived from some reef in this lead.
No. 5. ?Marooxey's Hill.
A line of basalt formation, commencing about 200 yards
from the boundary of the ? Lucknow ? estate, in a S.S.E.
direction, running almost north and south, here begins
the ?Frederick's Valley? estate. This lead is one of
Mr. Newman's pet spots, and it was on this that he sunk
a shaft, with the intention of undercutting the basalt, but
was prevented from going on. He believes that unless


gold in alluvial is to be found here, he knows no other part
of the country more likely to contain the precious metal.
The same line of basaltic outcrop follows down the eastern
face of this hill south-east, and indications are all favourable
to a similar formation as that in the ? C. H.,? as by
trial shafts; and gold can be washed on the end of this lead,
where the break occurs at the Lucknow estate boundary,
when comes a narrow division formed by the commence-
ment of ? Frederick?s Valley ? proper, through which runs
a small creek; the land then rises again up to the lead of
which I have made mention, and the same formation con-
tinues unbroken through our property. In one part this
lead narrows and the basalt contracts; and it is here
Mr. Newman would propose to try for gold, as though the
wash found here might be narrow, still it would be so much
easier to find, and save much expense, and, once found, could
be followed at will. He considers that from 400 Lto 500�,
spent here would not be wasted. The conclusion we came to
with reference to this lead was that, from its great depth and
general vastness, it gave tokens of being the bed of some
large waterway running into or being the reservoir for the
? C. H.? lead, and induced the belief that this originally
was the main watercourse rather than No. 3, as mentioned
by Mr. Wilkinson; certainly, from the general appearance
as presented by the surface and trial shafts, there seemed
good grounds for such conclusions.
No. 6.?Dead Tree Hill.
Basalt formation, lying about a mile S.S.W. of the
Lucknow boundary just referred to, and south-west of
? Marooney?s Hill? less than half a mile, running in the
same direction as the ? Chapel Hill ? lead, distant about a
mile and a half. This lead gives very favourable indications,
but it is not one which it would be advisable to spend
money on at first, for the reason that the basalt formation
terminates, so far as our property is concerned, about


200 yards from the commencement of the formation, though
the formation continues to run for miles through other pro-
perty in the direction of ? Brown?s Creek ? gold mine,
distant some fourteen miles.
No. 7.
Between Dead Tree Hill and the boundary of the
Lucknow estate is another basalt lead, trending from east
to west in the direction of the ?Forest'? alluvial, distant
nine miles This lead is on the direct line with the
? Lumpy Swamp/? worked for one mile and a half, and
on which they are now sinking a shaft at the eastern end,
and have at 200 feet obtained good gold, this ?Lumpy
Swamp ? having proved immensely rich. This No. 7 lead
is also parallel to the ? Great Extended? claim at the
Forest, where a large company has been lately formed, and
where a splendid deposit of wash has been cut.
No. 8. ?Frederick?s Valley Hill.
Basalt formation rising on the boundary of the old
Bathurst Eoad. This is one of Mr. Newman?s favourite
spots, and runs almost parallel to the ?Homeward-bound?
No. 2 (see No. 10 on plan), which it passes at a distance
of from fifteen to twenty chains, going straight for the
? Forest.? A most remarkable circumstance in connection
with this lead is that on the end facing the north-east are
found clinkers in every respect similar to those in the
Lucknow lode, and the general surface appearance is that
of the basalt formations adjoining this lode.
No. 9. ?Thomas? Paddock.
Basalt formation running north-west and south-east, on
which Mr. Newman sank three shafts?one to the east, one
to the west, and a centre one?about a chain apart (refer


to plan). These shafts are situated about five chains north-
west of our boundary, the lead running direct into our
land; finding the west shaft bottomed at 25 feet, they
moved to the east, and sank a shaft 80 feet deep, drove
in a level, and cut the basalt, sunk a monkey-shaft
2o feet, bottomed on sludge and gravel, and obtained
twenty specks or so of gold to the dish. They then
started on the centre shaft, got down 60 feet, but the
water proved too strong, and they relinquished it, having
no security of tenure. This they concluded to be the true
gutter, as both the other formations dipped towards this
centre, and the direction of this gutter makes it almost a
certainty that, at five chains? distance, a shaft sunk in our
ground would strike the wash. A small engine, 8 or
10-horse power, would be required to overcome the water
and work the wash.
No. 11.
W.S.W. of the "Reform? two miles is Joe Brown?s
Paddock, upon an eminence in which is a strong quartz
outcrop, running due east and west; this reef is from 3
feet to 4 feet wide. About a chain to the north of this reef
is another equally strong quartz outcrop running in the
same direction as the last. The stone in each is very full of
mineral and black jack, and of a very favourable description.
This Mr. Newman considers the second best spot; the ground
in connection with No. 9 coming first.
No. 12.
Basalt formation, in the same paddock as the last men-
tioned, running north-west and south-east. At the base of
this point, 10 chains to the north-east, on a flat was
found a run of wash, making into the basalt; on this flat


shallow prospecting shafts wore put down from 10 feet to
15 feet deep, and gold obtained by Mr. Kelaher, which
washed | oz. to the ton. We found on the surface of the
ground, on the brow of the point, clinkers similar to those
found on ? Chapel Hill,?
A reef on the hill opposite (marked No. 13 on the plan)
was worked, and good stone found ] the underlay running
towards the east from the Conoblas.
No. 14.
Basalt lead some 200 yards wide, with every appearance of
being very deep ground, the same formation as c Chapel
Hill,? lies north-east and south-west j the bearings taken
about 20 chains from our boundary on the line of lead. On
the extreme northern point of this lead, in Mr. Carrol?s land,
gold was obtained by Mr. Newman in sinking three shafts,
from 15 feet to 20 feet deep, as well as by driving several
short tunnels from the grass. The wash obtained would
pay very well with a battery at hand to crush on the spot.
All these last (from No. 11) are well situated as regards
water ; Gosling?s Creek running right through the paddock,
with sufficient water-power to do any work that might be
required, if a proper position was chosen.
No. 15.
One mile from the ? Reform ? due north we discovered a
lode of iron ore, running north and south, dipping west, and
showing, for over 100 yards on the surface, much of the
decomposed iron ore, giving this lode somewhat the same
appearance as the old Lucknow lode presented when first
operated upon ; it is also very similar to a discovery made
at Blaney, which, on being prosecuted, led on to a copper


lode, now working, and known as the far-famed ? Marsden?s
Copper Mine.? The ground requires prospecting in various
places along the lode, as on getting deeper pyrites might be
found, or signs indicative of greater value below. Mr.
Wilkinson, to whom I showed the ore, estimated it to
contain at least 50 per cent, of iron, and remarked that it
would be well worth testing the lode, as there was no saying
what it might contain.
No. 16.
An alluvial flat running north-west and south-west,
bounded on the west by the creek, and on the east by a
range of low hills, about one mile and a quarter long, and
an average width of 200 yards. This flat has been pros-
pected by Mr. Kelaher, with about twenty trials, and all
wash he has obtained at a few feet from the surface has got at
the rate of from 10 dwt. to 15 dwt. to the load. This would
be a magnificent piece of alluvial, and could bo washed
with great ease, were it not that, extending as it does to
the boundary of the estate, we have to get away for the
sludge, and unless mechanical means could be employed to
bring the wash from the lowest point down stream, and
allow it to be washed so that it would replace itself in the
old ground, there would be no means of making it available.
There remains only one more subject to be touched upon,
namely, the management. Mr. Newman has undertaken,
in the event of your going on in this matter, to accept the
management, on the terms stated in a letter from himself.
As regards his capabilities, I should say he was the one
most competent to undertake the same, of any that could be
found, judging from all I could learn, and my own observa-
tion of the manner in which the work was done in the
?New Reform.? As regards Mr. Newman personally, I
need only state that in him I met a gentleman, and one in
whose hands I feel sure your interests would be studied in


every way ; a tnati of intelligence and probity, of whom
all who knew him spoke in terms of strong recommenda-
tion. I cannot say too muck to show you how very
materially he has assisted in the work I was called upon to
do on your behalf, by allowing me free access to the mine
and matter connected therewith, by accompanying me to
the various places pointed out by himself and Mr. M ilkin-
son, as being likely to prove of value, giving me the benefit
of his experience in determining questions which occurred
to me to ask, and generally showing such willingness and
earnest desire to forward the interests of the Syndicate,
and that without any knowledge, on his part, of any reward
to follow. Previous to leaving, I told him, after thanking
him for all he had done, that I should make it my first
duty to represent to you, gentlemen, his claim to be
remembered, and should urge you to substantiate my
promise, and make him a free gilt of a full share in the
Syndicate, which I felt sure was no more than you would
be fully disposed to do.
It may be useful to point out various forms of gold-
mining, and you will notice that our land possesses the
most favourable descriptions of gold-bearing material.
First comes the ?clear quartz ? with visible and often
large pieces of gold in a free state ; secondly, that
quartz in which the gold is most finely distributed and
invisible to the naked eye ; thirdly, small quartz veins with
rubble where the whole mass contains gold ; fourthly,
deep alluvial ; fifthly, shallow alluvial; sixthly, gold and
pyi?ites. In the first instance, the mine is open to pecu-
lation in a great degree, so much of the value, as a rule,
concentrating itself in individual pieces of quartz, which
when seen are easily secreted ; in the second case, pieces of
quartz are rarely rich enough to induce any stealing, and it
only remains to have a trustworthy manager; in the third
and fourth instances, the stuff has to be put through a
battery, so that that also is in the hands of the manager,
and the fifth case often admits of great quantities being lost
in the washing, as nuggets, &c., are easily seen and hidden


by dishonest miners, except where the treatment is carried
on through locked boxes; but the safest of all is the
pyriteous ore, which cannot be interfered with till it reaches
England, and is under your own observation.
I remain,
Yours faithfully.
Clement Tancred.
