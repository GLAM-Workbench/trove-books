THE MESSAGE.
jj MESSAGE came, borne on the breeze,
That wafted o?er the Southern Seas ;
To Greater Britain?s sons it came,
And was received with loud acclaim?
It said that two of Royal race
(Whom love doth hold in its embrace),
Would come themselves, to look, and see
Their mother?s children, brave and free,
The offspring of true Britons? sires,
Whose hearts undaunted, knew desires
Of noble aim, to bid them do
Life?s battles?and to conquer too.


RETROSPECTION.
Argument :
Part ist, 1788. ? One of the first settlers at
Botany Bay, after wandering a long distance, is
resting under some native trees, and, thinking of
the rich beauties of Nature?s gifts surrounding
him, he falls asleep, and dreams :
Of the bright future yet shall be,
In Southern Isles, so richly blessed,
As are Australia?s !
Part 2nd, 1851. ?Discovery of gold. Assisted
Immigration Act passed.
Part 3RD, 1887-8. ? The Progress of Australasia,
and our Exhibitions in Commemoration of the
Centennial.
Part ist, 1788. THE DREAMER AND
HIS DREAMS.
JAR away from home and kindred,
; In distant land, as yet unknown,
I? By the eucalyptus umbered,
Lies a wanderer all alone ;
He dreams, not of his absent friends,
Nor yet of happy days gone by ;
His vision to the future tends?
The future ?neath Australia?s sky.


With Nature?s gifts of beauty blessed?
Luxuriant blossoms, fertile soil,
His thoughts are deeply now impressed
With what might be, by years of toil ?
He sleeps. He dreams, in distant time,
This land of beauty will be one,
Where England?s sons, ?neath Austral?s clime
May make and claim a home their own.
He sees from many distant lands,
The future years will strangers bring,
Who, with brave hearts and willing hands,
Shall make ? The wilderness to sing !?
He sees, that in the coming days
Her wealth and power will both be known ;
And, far and wide, will reach the lays
Of praise?shall be Australia?s own.
Part 2nd, 1851. ? THE MESSENGERS.
To Southern Isles, most richly blessed
With wealth and beauty we belong ;
We bring to thee a kind request
From loving hearts?then hear our song
Song. ?? A Welcome for Thee.?
O, come to our land
Far over the sea ;
Where brotherly hand
Has greeting for thee ;


Where Nature?s best gifts
Are scattered around ;
And labour uplifts
Bright gold from the ground.
The message we bring,
From over the sea,
Is, song that we sing?
? A Welcome for Thee !?
Part 3RD, 1887-8. ?THE PROGRESS OF
AUSTRALASIA.
Within the last Century things have taken place
in connection with these Colonies (now called
States), which far surpass the most sanguine
expectations that were ever indulged in, by either
romantic dreamer or political philosopher, one
hundred years ago.
0 YOUTHFUL land ! We marvel, as we thy
progress view,
To see the wondrous strength and power is
now displayed by you ;
To see your vast resources, and your cities great
and grand,
And the industries around you, that are a credit to
your land.


The large extent of ground, well tilled ; the flocks
and herds you show,
Are pleasing sights, that meet our eyes, whichever
way we go.
Your mines, and all their workings too, are matters
of surprise,
And, plainly tell, Australians know, no lack of
enterprise.
The Australian Exhibitions.
O, land of wealth and liberty, what wonders do
we see !
All nations send their offerings and greetings unto
thee?
Thou youthful stem of growing strength, from off
the parent tree;
Thy mother hath true cause this day, to show her
pride in thee?
One of her latest offspring thou, and yet, thou
can?st combine
Much greatness, with thy youthful years, and
say?that it is thine.
Behold ! The rich array, from far and near,
Behold ! The wondrous sights, that now appear;
See, eveiywhere, around us, trophies stand.
Which show the master mind and cultured hand,.
The finished workman?s craft, the artist?s skill?
Achievments gained by industry and will.


Amid the gems, from lands far distant, see
How rich the products of Australia be ;
Our gold and silver shine, wi f h brightest ray,
And precious are the stones we can display.
Exhibits too, we show?of copper, tin, _ .
Of wood, and fleece and wool?all found within
Our own fair Southern land. We think, to-day,
Australia holds her own, and leads the way
In many things. We find by her
Are works of industry our sons have made-
Which show colonial workmanship can claim
To be as good as that comes o?er the main.
With these, are works of Art and Science too,
That tell what Austral?s children think and do.
For, with their brothers, see, our daughters? fair,
Say?? Australasian laurels we can wear !?
Thus, while with admiration we can view
The wonders from afar, both strange and new.
Let Austral?s sons and daughters gladly say?
We show the progress, we can boast to-day.

igoi. ?Re FEDERATION ?? A NEW
YEAR?S SONG,? 1901.
HE New Year?s chimes now blithely ring
With loud acclaim, to welcome in
A New Year?s morn?one that will he
Remembered long in history.
A Century new, now they proclaim,
And with it comes a Federal name?
Under the Southern Cross to be
Australia?s bond of unity.
For all United, now we stand
With Twentieth Century, hand in hand?
From Leeuwin to Brisbane to-day,
And from Cape York to Cape Otway,
With Tasma?s Isle included too ?
Combined, we are a Nation new.
So, with the bells, that gaily chime
To welcome in this New Year?s time?
Let all our voices join the song
Of Federation, loud and long.
Express our joy?that we can say
The colonies Federate to-day.
United, henceforth, all will be
Under the Southern Cross, and free
Are those who dwell beneath the light
That Cross sends forth with radiance bright.


It seems, as we, with upward gaze,
Behold the shining of its rays ;
To say to us, in accents strong,
? I shine for right to conquer wrong
And to make clear and plain the way
For Austral?s sons this day to say?
A loyal race, both brave and free,
We stand in National Unity.
Our Commonwealth links one and all
To share the triumph of its call.
And, as I shine, with changeless power,
So let the glory of this hour
Remain unchanging?let it be
A lasting good for all to see.
From England?s Queen, across the seas,
A message wings on Southern breeze,
Sent to her ?well-beloved ones?
Her loyal subjects, Austral?s sons
To say, her heartfelt prayers are given,
That the}, through blessings sent from Heaven
By Providence Divine, may be
Blessed with increased prosperity.
And from both near and far away,
Congratulations come to-day ;
Goodwill re-echoes, long and wide
To greet and cheer on every side
Australian?s sons?and thus they prove,
Great Britain holds them in her love.


The younger sons of Britain?s race,
Now fitly take their proper place;
And stand in power, firm and strong,
A gem, the Empire?s gems among.
We join the joyous lay, and tell
How glad we are its strain to swell ;
And, from the warmth of loving hearts
We send a message, which imparts
To all those who have interest shown
In this, the day of days , our own,
That we send back, with hearts aglow,
Reciprocating thoughts to show
Love doth unite us, and that we
One Brotherhood, for aye, will be.

Zb e IRation?s (Brief
X NOTHER message comes ! Not joy it brings.
But sorrow deep upon its hurrying wings
3% It bears to us. And tells us, she, we love?
The Queen is prized, all earthly ones above ?
Our own Victoria, lies in danger great;
How sad the news to subject and to State.
The universal sorrow then was keen,
And heartfelt were our prayers?? God Save the
Queen.?
But He, the King of Kings, knew what was best.
And gave to His beloved endless rest.
Then all our joy was turned to sorrow deep?
We mourn our loss ?Victoria is asleep !

HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY?OUR BELOVED
QUEE.V VICTORIA.
HE Nations mourn ! And far and wide
to-day,
On every hand is heard grief?s solemn
lay,
For loyal hearts are filled with sorrow keen
Through death of one who was Great
Britain?s Queen.
See was a Queen beloved, revered by all,
And honored too, by Nations great and small;
A noble Queen ! One who was kind and true ;
Whose sympathies her subjects ever knew ;
Whose thoughts and actions, for those in
distress,
Were freely given to comfort and to bless.
Not length of reigning years, alone, did tell


The power she held in hearts that loved her
well;
It was her virtues and her graces kind,
That did endear her most to all mankind.
Great Britain weeps to-day, her tears are
shed?
Because from earth her best-beloved is fled ;
But whilst her sons and daughters grieve
their loss?
Behold ! What gain is hers. No more a cross
To bear ; a Crown, the fadeless crown of love
The ? King of Kings ? hath given her, now
above
To wear, for ever, in His Palace bright,
Where Crowns are fadeless, and where is no
night ;
Where is no sorrow, pain, or sad farewell,
But rest and peace, and perfect love to tell
The glories mortals cannot think or know,
Which God upon her there doth now bestow.
There, re-united to her Consort dear ,
She is for ever blessed in Heaven?s sphere?
Has ? Crossed the Bar? unto the Home above,
To share the fulness of her Saviour?s love.


PROCLAIMING KING EDWARD THE VII.
KING OF GREAT BRITAIN.
? God Save the King !?
OUR King is named ! Victoria?s first-born son
Will fill the throne, where she her laurels
won;
And, though our well-beloved, we long shall weep?
She is not lost ! She has but fallen asleep
Within the ? Arms of Everlasting Love ; ?
Has gone to Rest in perfect Home above.
Both for his own, and for his mother?s sake,
We cry, ? Long Live the King !? And may he take
The road his mother trod?that at its end
His subjects him will mourn, as King and friend ;
May he, too, like his mother, ever see
The love of loyal subjects, his to be.
41 God Save the King !? We pray, from hearts
sincere,
Giod save his Consort, whom we hold so dear ;
?God save all members of that Royal race,
Rill them with wisdom and with heavenly grace;
And keep and guide them, wheresoe?er they be?
At home, abroad, on land, or on the sea ;
? God Save the King !? God save his loved ones
We pray with faithful hearts ?and God can do.


Our IKlelcomc
To Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and the Duchess of
Cornwall and York.
GOD BLESS YOU !
WE, sons and daughters of this Austral land,
Now welcome thee, with outstretched
Federal hand ;
Our garlands bring, entwine I, to strew the way
That thou shalt take, on this auspicious day.
And, lovingly, our voices join the song,
Expressing thoughts to loyal hearts belong?
The song of greeting, and the wish so true
Is found in sentence small, our ? God Bless You !?
Yes ! Loyal hearts are breathing
One wish for thee, to-day?
Three little words, ? God bless thee !?
Are those that we would say,


? God bless thee !?? yes, ? God bless thee !?
God bless both thine and thee;
God bless old England?s nation,
That is for ever free.
And we, who were the subjects of that Queen we
loved so well,
Whose worth and greatness, and whose grace, our
lips delight to tell?
Will faithful people be to him who claims the
sceptre now,
And will wear the Crown of England upon his-
manly brow.
And in the future (though we pray, long distant be
that day),
We know our children, to his son, will loyal be
for aye.
In years to come they will recall, one day, when
they were young,
They to ? Prince George ? and ? Princess May,?
their joyous greetings sung.
And, may the memory of this time, a Jink for
ever be
To aid our children love and prize our bond of
unity ;
And, may our Federation bring to Austral?s gol leru
shore
Increased prosperity and power, both now and
evermore.


God bless our grand old Britain ! God bless our
noble King!
God bless his good Queen Consort (for her the
people sing
A song of love, that telleth, her goodness and her
grace,
For she both Queen and woman is, in great or
humble place);
God bless all their descendants, and may they
everyone,
When fading crowns are ended, the fadeless
Crowns have won.
And may the God whom they adore, bid each one
? enter in ?
To dwell for aye in a changeless Home ?in the
Palace of the King.
