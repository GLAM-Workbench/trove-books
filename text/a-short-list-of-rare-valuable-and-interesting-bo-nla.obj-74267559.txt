1. THE WORLD?S HISTORY.
A Survey of Man?s Record.
Edited by Dr. H. F. Helmolt.

James Bryce (now Viscount Bryce), with many
maps and plates, some beautifully coloured, 8
vols., 4to, cloth, as new, �8 for �4/15/-
Heinemann, 1901-7
.;.Dr. Helmolt?s is a monumental work; the pub-
jsher contemplated an undertaking on similar lines,
of this work forestalled him, and
was such as to cause him to reject his
Hr and to arrange an English adaptation of Dr.
Hmicdt?s book.
The Works of the following famous French Authors:
Eugene Sue
Gautier
De Musset
De Maupassant
translated into English, finely bound, and with
large clear type.
2 Eugene Sue?s Works, comprising The Wander-
ing Jew, 3 vols., Luxury, Gluttony, Avarice,
Anger, Pride, Mysteries of Paris, 3 vols., Indo-
lence, Arthur, The Knight of Malta and Envy,
in all 10 vols., Bvo, half mor., gilt backs and tops,
with numerous plates, large clear print, as new,
�l2 for �7/10/-
.:.Sue has been placed by some critics on an
equality with Dumas; he has, however, a command
of terror which that writer seldom or never attained.
He won for the novel a new audience and a new
interest; he wrote with an enthusiasm that fired his
genius to the creation of types of character that
still have power to horrify or charm.


S, W � rk f, �5 Theophiie Gautier, comprising
Mademoiselle de Maupm, Travels in Russia, A
Nfoil/ 11 Tr d r� n ? Fortunio - � ne of Cleopatra?s
Nights, The Grotesques, Travels in Spain, The

... A crowd of tales displaying the highest literary
qualities and ranking with Merimee?s at the head
ot all contemporary works. The ?Encyclopaedia
Butanmca says (see under Gautier)?Of indes-
cribable charm and of very definite value to men of
aters. Gems of the most perfect workmanship.
Charming mixtures of humour and tenderness.??

with numerous plates half morocco, gilt backs

... De Musset was one of the first, most original
and m the end, most successful of the great writers
included m the phrase ?the 1830 period.? He had
genius he inspired a strong personal affection?
his poems are charged with passion, fire, fancy and
fine satiric power. His "Nouvelles? are extra
ordinarily brilliant and in his plays he hit upon a
method of his own, in which no one has dared to
follow him.
5 The Works of Guy de Maupassant. 17 vols.,
Svo, with many fine plates, buckram, gilt tops,
arg'e clear print, as new, a very handsome set,
�l5/15/- for �lO/10/-
... An unmatched observer and the most perfect


Master of the Short Story. Inheriting from his
Master?Flaubert?an instrument already forged.
Maupassant wielded it with a surer skill; his method
so ?French? succeeds in giving an indescribable
?tang? to his tales.
The above works of Sue, Gautier, de Musset, and
de Maupassant are in English.
6 MACAULAY?S HISTORY OF ENGLAND.
A Splendid Edition
On the same lines as Green?s English People.
Illustrated.
In 6 vols., imp. Bvo, magnificently illustrated with
coloured and other plates, cloth, gilt tops, large
clear print, as new; a worthy edition of
Macaulay, �4/4/- for 55/-
THE HUMOUR OF IRELAND.
Will Carleton?s Great Work.
7 Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry. By
William Carleton. A very handsome edition
with full-page etchings by ?Phiz,? and other
plates (many finely coloured), 4 vols., Bvo, full
morocco, gilt tops, large clear print, as new,
�6/6/- for 84/-
These ?Traits and Stories? were drawn from
life and. in part indeed; embalmed the actual ex-
periences of the writer. For minute observation,
and for the insight into the character of the Irish
Peasantry which they display, Carleton?s stories
have never been surpassed. Of the many writers
who in the second quarter of the nineteenth century
sought to illustrate the manners and character of the
Irish peasant, none used so realistic a brush and
none produced so vivid an impression.


EDGAR ALLAN POE.
America?s Greatest Imaginative Genius.
8 The Works of Edgar Allan Poe. 10 vols., 8 vo,
with numerous plates, half morocco, gilt tops
and backs, large clear print, as new, �l2 for
�7/10/-
.:. There is nothing in English literature with
which the stories of Poe can be compared; his
works, both verse and prose, are increasingly in
demand. He has at last taken his rightful place as
the greatest imaginative genius America has pro-
duced.
SMOLLETT.
?His racy if reckless genius.??Thackeray.
9 The Works of Tobias Smollett. 6 vols., Bvo,.
with fine plates, buckram, gilt tops, finely
printed, as new, �4/4/- for 50/-
.;. Smollett?s Novels abound in incident and
character, however grotesque. In ?Humphrey
Clinker? he contrived to write a novel in letters
which is amusing from beginning to end. He had
the keenest perceptive faculty, and described what
he saw with wonderful relish and broad humour.
FIELDING.
10 The Works of Henry Fielding. 6 vols., Bvo,
with numerous plates, half morocco, gilt backs
and tops, finely printed, as new, �5/5/- for 75/-
.:. With Fielding?s ?Joseph Andrews? literature
quitted the confined atmosphere for the open air
and the cheery bustle of the Georgian high-road.
His characters are extraordinarily real and vivid.

morocco, gilt tops, as new, �2/10/- for 30/-

including the PROSE as well as the VERSE.
12 The Works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

�l2 for �6/6/-
The Prose Works of Longfellow include some
of the most charming books in the language; they

man wffio is familiar with his Poems only.

splendid set for a country house, providing years
of pleasant reading. The 34 vols, 4to, with
hundreds of plates and illus., cloth as issued,

?Macaulay.
18 The Novels of Jane Austen. The Winchester
Edition, with portrait, beautifully printed from
large clear type, 12 vols, Bvo, cloth, gilt backs
and tops, very handsome, �6/6/- for 70/-
.:. The writings of Jane Austen possess qualities
that place them far above those of her con-
temporaries, except Scott. She is one of the
supreme literary artists of the world, for she made
no compromises, and never wrote a line to please
anyone but herself. That is precisely why she
pleases all readers? taste and intelligence. In the
delineation of character she approaches nearest to
Shakespeare.

(in 1860), who travelled over the Islands.
Most of the portraits are inscribed, and were

course with the white man, which gives to this
unique collection an added interest. The album

portraits are neatly let in, not pasted down, and
each one may easily be withdrawn for examina-
tion. Price, �lO/10/-

by Chiquet, in handsome carved oak frame,
with oak mount, actual size of engraving 30| x
24 in., or with the frame 47 x 40 in., rare, �l5/15/-
.:. Meissonier had bitter critics who said he could
not paint this, and could not paint that, whom he
defeated gloriously as each charge was made. ?He
could paint history, he might even paint light, but he
could not paint movement.? His reply to this last
was ?La Rixe,? depicting two picturesquely-attired
ruffians, who have drawn on each other, and are
straining in the hands of cooler-headed friends to fly
together for a deadly embrace. This picture, painted
in 1855, finished Meissonier?s series of triumphant
demonstrations.

??? A remarkably fine copy of this exceedingly rare
and valuable volume. It is one of the earliest to
give coloured views of the Settlements, etc., in Aus-
tralia. _ The execution of the drawings as well as the
colourings is very fair, and chiefly depicts the early
settlements in their pastoral state.
The views may be regarded, with implicit confi-
dence, as absolutely facsimiles of scenes and places,
having been taken from nature, on the spot, by Mr.
Lycett, who resided more than ten years in the
country.

,:.When this monumental work was projected,
Israel Zangwill said of it;??lt is curious that a
century greedy of all knowledge, anxious to explore
every 'nook and cranny of history, should have
neglected the story of Jewish life and thought,
especially as that story is essentially of the centre,
however' it may have got crushed into the back-
ground of the world?s thought. But the century, re-
pentent in its dying hour, is making splendid amends
by the inception of the Jewish Encyclopaedia. . . .
The publication of the Jewish Encyclopaedia is an
historical event, which is bound to have far-reaching
effects both on Judaism and Christianity.?

Carlyle (Thos.) The French Revolution, 3 vols.,
Bvo, Extra-illustrated by the insertion of over
Two Hundred Portraits and Engravings, many
of which are scarce, many in proof _ state and
some printed in colours; the binding in crimson
morocco, gilt edges, by Hardy, �75 1870


The expense entailed in the production of this
book must have been enormous. Apart from the
fine binding and the cost of mounting and
strengthening the plates, numerous valuable books
of the 18th and early 19th Centuries have been
sacrificed. To take a few instances out of many
from the first volume: facing p. 51 is the frontis-
piece of the very costly 70-volume edition of Vol-
tare; following p. 182 are two plates from Bonne-
ville?s Portrait des Personnages Celebres de la
Revolution which sells from �8 to �l3, and a plate
from Tableaux Historiques de la Revolution worth
about �3; facing p. 236 is a view of the Bastille from
Vues Pittoresques des principaux edifices de Paris
which sells from �4B to �6O and individual plates up
to �6 each.

These books are usually sold separately, but
these are remarkably fine copies, and in their beauti-
ful Lloyd binding make a set of which there can be
few equals.
