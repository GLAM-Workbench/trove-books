I The Animal Pack
Jim McCarter
ILLUSTRATIONS BY
R. L. NEVIN


f\NCE upon a time an old man lived with
his son on a turkey farm. His name was
Grandfather Penny, and he had a long, grey
beard. He was very kind and liked nothing better
than to sit in the sun, minding his son’s turkeys,
id dreaming of the days when he
tinted wild animals in Australia,
) Africa and India. This was natural,
because he had been very brave
\ when he was young, and had cap-
tured all kinds of untamed
creatures. What is more he had
learned to make up rhymes about them, and
these he would tell to the boys and girls who
came with their parents to buy turkeys from his
son. It was quite usual, on such occasions, to see
a group of children gathered about his chair, or
walking with him through the house paddock,
where the turkeys ran loose, picking at the fat
worms which they scratched from the ground.
“Tell us about the wild animals,” the children
would ask.


“I will, when I find the time, children,” he
would reply. When he found time to describe the
different animals which he knew so well, he
would always tell his story in rhyme, and the
children laughed at the funny things he told
them.
One Spring day his young grandson came to
the farm for a holiday. He lived in the city, and
did not know much about the animals which
Grandfather Penny had captured in the jungles
and elsewhere. To make matters worse the little
boy, whose name was Tom, was rather shy, and it
took him days to pluck up courage to question the
old gentleman.
“Please, Grandfather,” said Tom one morn-
ing, “will you tell me about the wild animals you
used to catch when you were a young man?”
Grandfather Penny pulled out a very old,
smelly pipe, and scraped it clean with a knife
before answering. Then, to the lad’s surprise, he
placed an arm about his waist and drew him
close. His poor hand had once been bitten by a
tiger and was slightly withered.


“Well, Tom, my lad,” he said in a husky voice,
“I’m busy now, looking after your uncle’s turkeys.
I can’t neglect my job, you know, to tell you
rhymes about animals.”
“But, grandfather,” said Tom, looking about
him, “the turkeys are not running away. Won’t
you tell me about your elephant... the one you
called Traveller?”
“You mean the one that carried the wild
animals back to the zoos?” asked his grandfather,
with a twinkle in his eye.
“Yes,” replied Tom. “And they often tried to
get out of the pack on Traveller’s back, didn’t
they?”
“They did that,” replied Grandfather Penny.
“But he was a clever elephant. Sometimes he
would push them back with his trunk when they
tried to get out of the pack. He never failed to
carry them safely for me.”
“Ah! Do tell me some rhymes, Grandfather,”
pleaded Tom.
Grandfather Penny stroked his grey beard
for a few seconds before replying.


“I’ll tell you what I will do, Tom,” he said.
“Your uncle is selling all his turkeys next month,
in February. So, I will have very little work to do.
You come to me at eleven o’clock every morning,
and I will tell you a rhyme. As there are twenty-
eight days in February, that means that I will tell
you twenty-eight different rhymes about the
animals I knew and caught when I was young.
Will that suit you?”
Tom was delighted, and he hugged his
grandfather.
“Oh, thank you very, very much,” he ex-
claimed. “Because you have been so kind, I will
help you to look after the turkeys.”
And Tom helped his Grandfather through-
out the following days. When February came, he
watched the clock until the hands showed five
minutes to eleven. Then he ran as fast as he could
to his Grandfather, to hear the funny rhymes
about The Animal Pack.
And in the pages of this book are the rhymes
that Grandfather Penny told.


THE JEALOUS RAT
♦ ♦
moonlight night a jealous rat
Espied a ’possum up a tree,
And as there was no household cat,
He thought he’d venture out to see.
He watched the ’possum use his tail
To cling to branches high and low;
But as the moon began to pale,
He saw the ’possum stop, and go.
So Master Rat scaled up the tree,
And wrapped his tail around a limb,
But he fell down so heavily,
That two fat bunnies laughed at him!

THE LEOPARD
♦ ♦
A leopard saw a soldier’s tent
And wondered what on earth it meant.
He’d never seen a tent before,
So he let out an awful roar.
He then stood still as though he were
A statue carved from spotted fur,
And both his eyes appeared to glaze,
As though his thoughts were in a maze.
But he was ready just the same,
To use his claws to tear and maim.
So that is why the soldier shot
That vicious leopard, on the spot.

THE KANGAROO
♦ ♦
SAID Mother Roo, to Baby Roo:
“Now, stay inside, you have the ’flu.
If you hop out and get much worse,
I’ll have to call a Red Cross nurse.”
The Baby Roo put out his head,
And to his loving mother said:
“I s’pose you’d spank me if I did,
And make me do as I were bid.”
“Well, I declare!” gasped Mother Roo.
“I’ve never heard such cheek from you.”
“It’s cos I’m sick,” the Joey cried.
“Then,” warned his Ma, “you stay inside.

THE ELEPHANT
♦ ♦
AN elephant once met a mouse
A-playing near his mother’s house.
“Ho, ho,” he said, “you little trick.
How would you like a great big kick?”
“You can’t bluff me,” the mouse replied,
“Although you’re like a mountain side.
Why, I could sneak inside your trunk
And bite you till you fairly shrunk!”
“Oh dear,” cried Jumbo, in dismay.
“I’m only joking... just in play.”
“Well,” said the mouse, “you must admit,
A kick from you would not be wit!”

THE TIGER
♦ ♦
IN his cage sat Tiger Tim,
Where the children looked at him.
“You may stare,” he said, “at me,
But you’d run if I were free.
“India was once my home,
And it’s there my brothers roam,
Keeping clear of tiger traps
That are laid by cunning chaps.
“In the jungle I could fight,
And put enemies to flight.
But in here, as well you know,
I’m just Tiger Tim, on show.”

THE WOMBAT
♦ ♦
THIS old wombat, blackish brown,
Never comes to visit Town,
For he likes the country side
Where in peace he can abide.
He goes burrowing at night,
Scooping earth with all his might,
And like rabbits in the ground,
Lives within a tunnel round.
He’s not pretty, as you see,
As most people will agree.
But he’s happy, just the same,
’Cos he likes his nightly game.

THE ZEBRA
♦ ♦
A Zebra is a type of horse,
A fact that experts will endorse.
He is, indeed, a pretty sight,
When standing in a setting right.
In Africa he roams the veldt,
(Pronounced the way the word is spelt)
And gallops off if he should see
The first sign of an enemy.
Although his skin of many streaks,
Has made him one of Nature’s freaks,
He’s not so great a freakish horse,
To win a Melbourne Cup, of course.

THE CAMEL
♦ ♦
IF camels did not have the lumps
Upon their backs which we call humps,
They might, perchance, have had a smile
For boys and girls, once in a while.
But oh, they are so glum of face,
No matter if they walk or race.
And nothing that a man can do,
Will make a camel smile at you.
Of course they were not made to smile,
But carry burdens mile on mile,
Across the arid desert trails,
Especially when the water fails.

THE MOOSE
♦ ♦
ONE day a moose came on a goose,
And asked her to pronounce her name.
“Well,” said the goose, “it isn’t moose,
And yet it sounds about the same.
“It rhymes with loose,” went on the goose,
“So surely that should give a clue.
Come, Mister Moose, what rhymes with loose?
Don’t tell me that it baffles you?”
“You’re not a mouse,” cried Mr. Moose,
“Though mouse and moose sound close, ’tis true.
What are you then?” Up spoke the goose:
“I am a goose... and so are you!”

THE SQUIRREL
♦ ♦
SQUIRRELS are so very fleet,
On their tiny, nimble feet,
And they climb the trees and jump
Easily from stumn to stump.
They like eating nuts and fruit,
Or perhaps, a tasty root,
And go scaling with delight
When the moon is shining bright.
Surplus food they learn to store,
Just in case the season’s poor.
So, like squirrels, we should try
Saving for the bye-and-bye.

THE GIRAFFE
♦ ♦
TWO birds were perched upon a limb
When a giraffe, with long neck slim,
Commenced to eat the green leaves there,
While both the birds could only stare.
“Hello, my friends,” he said at last,
“Fve had a very nice repast.
It’s strange to think that you and I
Can dine up here, towards the sky.”
“It’s strange indeed, how we are built,”
One birdie said, with tail atilt.
“You have the neck ... we have the wings
To reach the very tops of things,”

THE JACKAL
♦ ♦
JACKALS often stand and howl
When they’re on a nightly prowl,
And like dingoes in a pack,
Will go sneaking to attack.
When the moon comes out they creep
Over plains and hillsides steep,
And their mournful cry is heard
each animal and bird.
But when people have a gun,
Jackals soon get on the run,
For they seem to sense defeat,
When a hunter they do meet.

THE CHIMPANZEE
♦ ♦
\\ THO owns that funny face I see?”
* ’ Once asked a clever chimpanzee,
As he peered in a looking glass:
“To me, he looks a silly ass.”
But someone said the face he saw
Was all his own, and nothing more,
And that the mirror told the truth
About himself from toe to tooth.
“Since that’s my face I see in there,”
He said with such a cunning air,
“It’s nothing like an ass to me,
But like myself... a chimpanzee!”

THE PORCUPINE
♦ ♦
U 1 wonder who lives down that hole?”
Said Willie Porcupine one day.
“I hardly think that old Jack Mole,
Would build himself a house that way.”
“You go away,” a rabbit squealed,
From deep within his burrow dark.
“Why don’t you try another field,
Or go a-walking in the park?”
“I shall,” cried Willie Porcupine,
And raised the spikes along his back.
“You never were a friend of mine,
And I prefer another track.”

THE LLAMA
upon a time a llama
Thought he’d go to Alabama,
Just to have his voice recorded
And by broadcast stars applauded.
But one day, when he was walking,
And with other llamas talking,
He was told he’d soon be fretting,
When away from mother’s petting.
So the llama thought he’d rather
Stay at home with mum and father.
“Anyway,” he said, “I’d sooner,
Stay right here than be a crooner.”

ii T think I’ll sit and rest a bit,”
■*" Said Reynard, looking round the tree.
“For well I know, my head might go,
If skilful hunters spotted me.
“If I were seen in paddocks green,
I’d have to run just like the breeze,
And as I ran, Fd plot and plan
How I could hide among the trees.
“My fur, well matched, with tail attached,
Is Fashion’s prize, I’ve heard folk say,
So if I sit and rest a bit,
No one will get my skin to-day.”

THE MONGOOSE
♦ ♦
A mongoose in the jungle deep,
Came on a cobra fast asleep,
So he began to tease the snake,
Until the reptile was awake.
“I woke you up,” the mongoose said,
‘‘To tell you that you’ll soon be dead.
No matter how you light or strive,
You’ll never leave this place alive!”
Right then and there, the fight occurred,
And Mr. Mongoose kept his word;
He killed the snake the mongoose way,
Which never fails, some people say.

THE RHINOCEROS
♦ ♦
A rhinoceros can smell
Better than some children spell,
Though his sight is not the best,
When he wakens after rest.
He is big and very tough,
With a skin that’s thick and rough,
And he carries as he goes
Horn-like things upon his nose.
He is active for his size,
And is sometimes very wise,
But the hunters catch him too,
For the people at the Zoo.

THE WILD BOAR
♦ ♦
A wild boar can be dangerous,
When cornered after chase and fuss.
He’ll charge a foe when in a rage,
Or with a man a fight engage.
Of course, he has no lovely curls
To make him beautiful, like girls.
He really is an ugly thing,
And what is more, he cannot sing.
But where the wild boars live and roam,
They have no need to use a comb.
They were not made to sing and jig,
But be themselves, each one a pig!

THE YAK
♦ ♦
ON Tibet tracks, the long-haired yaks
Bear heavy burdens on their backs,
And give the milk for butter, too,
Which is so kind of them to do.
The Mongols ride them when they go
Up mountain trails across the snow.
And they are used for other work
Which many animals might shirk.
And from the Yak, the long hair slack,
Is cut and hung upon a rack,
And clothes are made for young and old
To keep them warm in regions cold.

THE LION
♦ ♦
ONE day a lion sat ’neath a tree,
And lazily prepared for bed,
When suddenly, in seconds three,
He felt some whacks upon his head.
At once he gave a mighty roar.
“I am the King of Beasts,” he cried.
He shook his head and waved a paw:
“So why should I be thus defied?”
A monkey in a palm-top threw
More cocoanuts straight at the King.
“You’re boss,” he called, “down there, it’s true,
But way up here, I have my fling.”

THE HIPPOPOTAMUS
♦ ♦
AFRICA, where Zulus dwell,
Has strange animals as well,
One, the hippopotamus,
Is a funny one to us.
Hippopotamuses play
In the water ev’ry day,
Floating here and floating there,
Just as though they didn’t care.
But when hunger makes them feel
Ready for another meal,
They just waddle to the shore,
Looking for the grass once more.

THE PUMA
♦ ♦
UPON a rock a puma sat,
And looked around, just like a cat,
As though he did not care a bit,
How long he’d have to wait and sit.
But while he seemed so meek and kind,
He had a notion in his mind,
To spring on some poor animal
And eat him up, quite natural.
For pumas prey on smaller fry
As quickly as you’d blink your eye.
But sometimes they are forced to fight
An enemy of greater might.

THE MOUNTAIN GOAT
♦ 4
HERE’S a bearded mountain goat
In his heavy winter coat,
Climbing down a craggy slope,
Like a sailor on a rope.
He is happy when he stands,
High above the grazing lands,
Watching animals below,
As they wander to and fro.
If he only had a name,
And in time, were really tame,
What a mighty goat he’d be
In a billy cart. Whoopee!

THE PANDA
♦ ♦
ONCE, a goosey gander
Met a panda in the dark,
And the panda thought the gander
Was all ready for a lark.
So he tried to chase the gander,
But to his complete surprise,
Why, that naughty goosey gander
Pecked him twice about the eyes!
Now the pandas and the ganders
Are no longer friends, alack!
And the eyes of all the pandas
Are to-day encircled black!

THE REINDEER
♦ ♦
WHEN Father Christmas packs his
For little girls and little boys,
His reindeers know that soon they’ll be
Careering far across the sea.
They stand and wait for Santa’s call,
And do not run from him at all,
For they know children love to play
With toys that Santa gives away.
And as their Master starts his round
Across the world, without a sound,
The reindeers from the land of snow
Will take him where he wants to go.

THE BROWN BEAR
♦ ♦
i{T FI only had the time,”
•1- Said the brown bear at the zoo,
“Here’s a pole that I could climb,
And without much trouble, too.
“But if I scaled up to see,
How the world looked from the top,
Someone then would tell on me,
And of course, I’d have to stop.
“P’raps they think I’d run away
If I jumped into the street.
Well, to that I only say,
In this zoo, I live and eat!”
