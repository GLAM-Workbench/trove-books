SOME COMMENTS ON THIS BOOK.
Judge Heydon: ?The subject is of the utmost import-
ance and should he studied by all thinkers.? (26/4/?16.)
?Sunday Times? (20/2/16): ?As this book is studied
one fails to deduct any error in the information contained,
or in the scheme propounded. viz,, to amalgamate our
banks into a one-bank system, which would give us power
to carry on this war without taxation, and which would
enable us to solve the industrial problem after the war.?
?Freeman's Journal? (10/2/16): ?A remarkable book
has been issued. . . . With such an institution operating
in many channels which would be natural for it, financial
safety would be found, and the prospect of coming victori-
ous out of the 'war would be rendered certain.?
?Sunday Sun? (27/2/16): ?The writer cleverly pre-
sents his view of a transaction like the Grlffith-Norton
transaction, which he calls "The Griffith-Norton Thing.'?
(See page 57 of the book.)
?Goulburn Penny Post? (24/3/16); ?The writer attacks
the question fearlessly unhampered by tradition. That is
as it should be.? (This paper quoted pages 10 and 11.)
?Telegraph? (15/2/16) calls special attention to page
T of the hook for the public to discuss.
?Mirror? (18/3/16): ?Let the people judge for them-
selves by obtaining the book, and by going to- hear ad-
dresses on the matter.?
The London Cable News of the ?S.M. Herald? (12/1/16)
contained the following: ?Sir Alfred Mond, in the British
Parliament, said. ?England?s Banking System, was the great-
est bar to industrial development.? ?
NOTE.?You could assist this movement by buying as
many hooks as you can, and sending them to your friends.

DEMOCRACY.
Great la your heart, oh! democracy!
A-nd strong are your thews and sinews.
Clever is your brain to plan for human wants.
And cunning the skill of your handicraft to build.
One power you have neglected,
Weiided in hands not yours;
It is the vampire
That consigns you and your offspring to slavery*
Despoils you of the fruits of your industry.
And fattens on your hearts' best blood.
Its name is Finance.
Grasp it in your strong right hand
Aad you are free.
Beyond the barrier of our present-day banking system*,
there is successful War, a higher civilisation, a wonder*
�ul destiny*
Were you born under the Union Jack?
Th* work �f breaking through that barrier is your��


SOME COMMENTS ON ?THE CIRCULATING
SOVEREIGN? PUBLISHED IN 190 S.
?Australasian Typographical Journal?: ?The little book
is causing much interest in Labor circles. A cop/ of it
should be secured by every worker in the land.? (19/6/04.)
?Manly and North Sydney News?: ?The author is to be
congratulated on the excellence of the little book. Mr.
W. O. Archibald, M.P., of Adelaide, has lectured on the
solution of the unemployed problem from it. It is grati-
fying to know that many papers have eulogised the
author's efforts, but we regret to hear that the ?Bulletin?
noticed it not. It might not be out of place to remind
Sir James Edmond, that it is selfish for anyone to imagine
that he is the only ?pebble on the beach.? (22-10/04.)
?Freeman's Journal?: ?We predict for this work a cir-
culation such as no economic work has reached in this
State since Henry George's ?Progress and Poverty/ ?
(July.7, 1304).
Stephen Barker, Secretary P.L.C., of Victoria: ?Send
me a dozen-copies. I think my executive will endorse my
�pinion that it is worth pushing in the interest of our
movement. (8/2/04),
W. O. Archibald, Adelaide: ?1 was always of opinion,
both in England and Australia there was a great leakage
in finance. I could never understand until I studied ?Tbe
?Circulating Sovereign.? ? The writer is the first man, that
as far as I know, understands the question and can make
IMs difficult subject clear. (3/4/04).
ML Ross, Coodooga: ?I trust your little work will get
TOto the hands of every working man.?
J. D. Fitzgerald: ?I can thank you and acknowledge
my indebtedness, because though I was on the track, I
Md not quite got into the right paddock.? (13/6/04).
?'Clarence and Richmond Examiner?: ?One of the oldest
established and most reputable papers in the State says
the booklet?s circulation is likely to exceed that of
?Progress and Poverty/? (31/7/04).
?'Sunday Time�?; Mr. Scott?s arguments are of special
interest. (6/6/1904).

OUR DISABLED SOLDIERS.
?*
LETTER TO THE ?SUN,? MAY 28, 1915.
J.M.S. is emphatic?
?Your leader carries the suggestion that we might find
work for bur soldiers who may have lost limbs, by allow-
ing them to work lifts, elevators, etc. Is this the year
ISIS? Just think. There go from this country men who,
compared with those who won?t go, are gods. These men
ar� going through hell-fire for us. Some will never com�
hack, some will come back disabled, and we are suggesting
that we allow 'them to spend the balance of their lives
flunkeying for us working elevators. Isn?t it awful? Do
we mean It? If we, the non-combatants, took it in turn to
foe the servants of our returned soldiers all their lives
we would be honoring ourselves.?
If the banking business Ss in the way of our being able
to keep faith with our eoldters, will you assist to make It
evolve s� that we can keep faith?


LECTURES, Eto.
A French officer remarked: ?W� can win this
war if the citizens do not give in? ?meaning,
would the non-combatants be able to stand th�
foverty strain.
Could we Australians stand for four years or
longer the poverty being brought about by IN-
CREASED TAXATION CAUSING HIGHER and
HIGHER PRICES?
This is every man and woman?s problem.
In 1903 the little book, ?The Circulating Sover-
eign,? was produced, and 10,000 copies sold. The
work done quietly in certain quarters brought into
txistence the Federal Bank. This little book has-
��en re-written on
45 BANKING AND THIS WAR/*
A SERIES of ADDRESSES is to be given on the
subject of bringing about a FURTHER EVOLU-
TION in BANKING in order to carry out this war
WITHOUT TAXATION, and we can win.
The first address was delivered at the School of
Arts Debating Club, Chatswood, last Tuesday-
evening.
250,000 Copies of the New Book can be dis-
tributed at 1/6 each.
A PUBLISHER IS WANTED. Secretaries of
Debating Clubs, Political Leagues (Liberal and
Labor), Unions, etc., and Readers who know ?The
Circulating Sovereign,? write to
BOX 2269, G.P.0., SYDNEY.
The above appeared in Sunday ?Times,? November
14th, 1915, as an advertisement. Similar notices appeared
in the Sunday ?Sun? and' ?Herald." It brought the-
writer in touch with men and women who knew the little
book, and who had heard addresses on the subject. An.
organisation was soon formed, the publication of this book,
and this crusade is the result. Will you join in?


OUE BRITISH FLEET,
One thing stands out in our Empire above all the world,
*nd that is our Fleet.
Our Navy reckons to win by its own strength, not
through the weakness of the enemy.
?Never despise, underrate or think silly things about an
enemyis a lesson burned into the minds of our sailor-
snen. Consider him to be perfect, and become more per-
fect yourselves is the correct attitude. Our fleet does not
pour broadsides of words at an enemy.
The civil department of our nation might take a lesson
from our fleet. For instance, the ?Economist,? an English
financial paper that deals with ?tangled masses of
figures,? according to the ?Sun,? said: ?The German and
Austrian war finance cannot last much longer.? A paper
that talks that way, has some sort of an idea that its own
finance is bad, that it could not stand a strain, and is
reasoning that the other side is Just as rotten and must
mecessarily break. If it knew absolutely that its own side
were strong, it would continue to reason that the other
�ide might be just as strong. If it thinks its own side is
weak, and that nothing can be done to improve things, It
-eases its mind by saying silly things about the other side.
The Navy does not act that way: Knowing itself to b�
strong, it knows there is the possibility of the enemy being
strong, and so it is always improving itself.
I want to state here there are only two nations on the
earth under their present banking system that are in a
position to carry on a war without financially breaking
down-?one is Germany, the other is Japan. Both have
evolved beyond us in banking.
On this finance or banking question we have to take the
attitude of our fleet.
Altering our finance to become stronger than the enemy
Is very simple.
Will you assist in the movement? We have to take over
Alt the banka.


NON-COMBATANTS? DUTY.
From the first word war it can be said that every man,,
woman and child has thought more about the tragedy,,
than they hare of ordinary day life.
While our soldiers and sailors are fighting: for supre-
macy, paying the price with their !It@s for us, it is the
duty of non-combatants to bring about an arrangement:?-
(1) To supply our armies with, full man power and
munitions of war.
(2) To treat our returned soldiers and sailors as wm
hare pledged ourselves to do.
(3) To prevent poverty coming on non-combatants-
through unemployment, high prices, and taxation.
(4) To prevent the United States from wresting from
us our financial position la the- world.
These are our duties, and the problems are such that
We Australians are best able to deal with them because of
our small population, which enables us to have ideas dis-
cussed by all, and quickly put into practice.
If we fail in No. 4 we have failed in this supremacy
problem, as it is more than likely our Empire would split
up.
It might be suggested that the matter dealt with in this
book should be left to some one else, but perhaps that
gome one else does not know enough. In any case in our
Australian democracy, it is the business of the individual-
mot to wait for some one else, but to stand out, and if
possible, point the way, the rest will happen automatically.
FINANCE AND BANKING.
Finance governs everything in our civilisation, and con-
sequently the minds of men and . particularly of women
have to be brought on to this question.. Women will b�
surprised when they know, what: men have been doing in
this department.
There is nothing mysterious about finance and banking.
It is a very simple subject. Our little lives are roundei
by a coin. The coin in its circulation controls us. and w�
ought therefor� to trace the history of that which control�


vs. and which will control our success or failure in this
war.
The greatest mystery regarding banking and finance is
the fact that the men who have had the banking business
in their hands so long, have not grasped, the awful power
that has been theirs. They might ere this have owned the
whole earth. They have not realised their power. It is
democracy?s business to point it out to them, and use that
power as it should be used, for good.
The word ?finance" comes from the .Batin "financia??
payment of money; money. Robbed of its name, tt does
;not seem so mysterious, does it? It is the system of
handling money. Finance as it has been worked could
rightly be described as a ?tangled mass of figures, little
understood by those that work it, of little benefit to those
that profit by it, and it has been responsible for 90 per
cent, of human crime and misery.? It has also been
responsible' for our success, and if we lose this war it will
merely be because the British Empire is out of date in
finance, or the system of handling money.
. is not necessary to puzzzle anyone with any tangled
mass of figures, such figures are the creations of the
system. This little book is to try and describe the system
as used by the nations now at war, and to trace their
development of the past 50 years as being entirely owing
to the evolution of finance or the handling of money, and
to suggest that we, the British Empire, commencing with
Australia first, must take the final step in its evolution,
beyond which no other nation can go, to bring about suc-
cessful war and eventually a perfect civilisation.
Finance as it is worked, and has been worked, is a
mathematical impossibility. Attempt to do something
mathematically impossible, and there must be failure. The
mathematical impossibility of the system of handling
money has produced our slums, our bankruptcies, our
restricted marriage rate, our restricted birth rate, and tue
string of other things that follow on poveity.
It is an axiom that the whole of anything is greater than
Its part. A yard stick is greater than a part of it, say
one inch,. Try and put the yard stick into the o�


one inch, and that stick will become very much buckled
up and out of shape. Our affairs are very similar.
Take another example: A suit of clothes is greater taan
one of its pockets. Try to put a suit inside the pocket,
and we have the garment crumpled. Straighten out one
of the crumpled places, and we do so by intensifying the
trouble somewhere else. To straighten the whole garment
inside the pocket is a mathematical impossibility, and sc-
are our affairs. Our finance is identical with these two-
examples.
A nation is greater than any part of it. Attempt to
put the nation financially into any part of it, and we have
the yard stick and the suit of clothes. Yet this is what,
all nations have been trying to do. Germany recently
has evolved beyond it.
A nation consists of the people within certain boun-
daries, and aY that is within those boundaries, human
beings, governments, money, buildings, land, banks, etc.
The bank or banks are the nation?s pockets.. We have been
trying to carry on our national money affairs not even so-
great as a pocket, but as a ledger account in a bank?s
books, which makes it mathematically impossible to carry
on without our crumples, our slums, our restricted enter-
prise. The figures built up in this ledger account, w@
have treated as if they were money that had gone out of.
existence to be replaced by taxation, hence we are taxed
to-day for interest on all the food and material we have
used in the past, for all the work .done, and this interest
passed first on to our employers, is put on to the price-
of commodities and has placed an impossible burden on
everybody. It is causing slumdom and business bank-
ruptcy. It always has. This impossible finance has;
created 90 per cent, of human misery.
Our papers tell us that the Government is the public
purse, because it collects our taxes. Think it out. The
Government puts the taxes where? In a bank, does it
not? Then the banking business is the public purse, and
not the government. Everybody pays taxes, so the day
the government deposited the taxes in a bank made uf
ail bank depositors. There are the other direct depositors.


In drawing attention to the banking business, we are
merely attracting attention to that in which, we are all
interested, everyone of us without exception we aie all
depositors.
A bank invites people to place money with it for good
use and safe keeping. This book is weighing the Austra-
lasian banks in the balance, so that we, the depositors
(direct or indirect), may form an opinion as to whether
they are safe places of deposit, and whether our money
has been put to good use.
The solution of the problem is to amalgamate the whole
�f the banks into one large bank, call it what you like.
The Bank the Nation, and the Nation the Bank. Look
from the bank across the affairs of the nation, and- keep
the coin in circulation up to the requirements of th�
people, and where the work is of a national nature, such
as this war, have no taxation, or interest. Why should
we have any of this nonsense? Any reader will see that
at a glance, and there is hardly need lor more to b�
written These last few lines are the solution of every
problem in front of us. The following is a description
of the method we work to-day to obtain the use of
money for national affairs. _
We, the citizens, put the coin in a bank. Collectively
we need the us� of money or coins to pay men, while
they construct some public work, or carry on this wan
We go through a process of pawning, either to a an
or to some individual citizen. This allows our agent#
called governments to draw some money or coin out of a
bank. This is paid to the men, who pay it away to some-
one else. It reaches stored etc. In a few days it is a
in the banks again. The same coin or money goes through
the same process building up figures in a book ma.
building called bank. We are then told we have spent
so many millions of money, and we begin to tax ourselves
to' try and wipe out the figures already described. We
go through a process of taking from ourselves purchasing
power to the extent of millions, and what have we raised.
Nothing except figures.
We. the nation, have to take over or take con


trol of this banking business and let those coins
circulate without pawning or taxation. We hare to do
this not because it' is an Improvement on our present
method, hut because if we do not we will go out of
existence as a nation in this war. The German Federal.
Council control their banks to such an extent that they
are able to do it, when they want to. They are allowing,
their banks to remain as they are, but they control them.
We have got to know what we are doing, and take them
ail over, amalgamate them into one bank and that is the
ultimate of banking, and the base from which we shall
win this war. Swing the whole of our energy on to one-
objective and when that is obtained, evolve into a higher
civilisation. It is right that the Briton do it. Our supre-
macy would for ever remain unchallenged, unless some-
day there be a war for racial supremacy on the color-
question. What will it require to take over all the bank-
ing business? Well, the whole of the Australian banking
business is at the mercy of the Savings Banks depositors-
to-day, should they ask for their money. So all that is
required is a knowledge of the truth.
SOME BANKING PROPOSITIONS.
Sf, say, 1000 men had �.2 each in coin, and one of them
opened a bank, and the people put their coin in it, the
man with the bank could put the lot on to work for him
at the rats of �2 per week. On pay day he could pay them
with their own money, and all their work would be his.
Say he-offered the goods produced for �4OOO. The people-
might hand him their wages �2OOO for half of the goods,,
he -would have their money and half of the production.
? A proposition similar to the above appeared in the
?Circulating Sovereign.? Investigation afterward showed
that a Japanese nobleman some 18 years ago, had just
closed up all the small money lenders in his district, be-
came the banker himself, and instead of just letting money
out at interest, applied the above system and became a
millionaire (in yen value) in 5 yeats..
Say a number of people went to some new country; and


had some coin� with them, but did not know how to use
them satisfactorily, and they staggered on siowiy for 25
years in trouble all the time, till one day a gentleman
arrived amongst them who said, ?Why don?t you open a
bank??" Some people produced the bank, other people pus
?ihelr money in it, and then carried on in the usual way,
and this simple suggestion was the solution to their prob-
lem.
That would be Australia from 1788-1813, when Gover-
nor Macquarie suggested a bank, and the Bank of New
South Wales came into existence.
Say, there was a nation that had a history from 55 B.C.
to 1694 A.D., and progress had been very slow, not only
there, but in other countries, and say that country went
to war with France, and the trouble was that the govern.'
ment could not get enough money by the method of send-
ing out direct tax gatherers, for war purposes. At that
time a gentleman said, the goldsmith, money lenders that
ws have are no good. Let us have a larger money lender.
On that thought some gentleman opened a larger bank
to which people brought their coins, and the bank handed
those coins to the government, and the government paid
them to men to equip for war, and the coins circulated
round and cams to the bank again, to go through the same
process of payment to the government, etc., and through
that simple thing a good army and navy was equipped,
and the war won.
That is just what happened in England in 1694 when
Mr. Paterson suggested the Bank of England.
Suppose in a new country where things were going on
Just as we know them, a number of business men getting
tired of the restrictions of ordinary banking methods, de-
cided to cause runs on a number of small banks and take
them over, so that they would have a continuous flow of
depositors? coin to them for nothing. Having dons this,
they used the unasked for coins to pay men to build fac-
tories for them. Those business men-would be on a better
footing for money than the ordinary business, and they


?would grow very large, In fact, It tney were not stopped
they would *oon own everything.
This Is what the Morgan Combination did in the United
States 25 years ago. This was the birth of large things
la that country, called Trusts and Combines. To-day about
a dozen men there own two-thirds of the railway system
-of the States, and other big things, all worked on the
depositors? money.
Look back to proposition No. 2, Say In that country
wonderful gold discoveries were made, and other bank*
opened and in time the banks became controlled from the
?country In No. 3 proposition. The gold as soon as it
reached the banks would be shipped to the outside coun-
try, and the increasing amount of money getting into cir-
would cause a great development wherever it
went to. Sf the gold then left the outside country and
reached the Continent of Europe and remained there, it
would cause wonderful permanent development in Europe.
The country It came from would not increase its popula-
tion very much. The country It first went to would develop
and get a reputation, while the country it remained in
would become mighty.
This is Australia, London and Europe, and we see to-day
the result of the gold robbery from the colonies.
Say there was a small country called Prussia, and in
SOO years, Its rulers, by repeated deliberate efforts,
bad extended its Influence till one of the Prussians called
himself Emperor of all the German nation. Say that the
rulers noticed the difference it made as gold came to it
from outside, and eventually their attention was attracted
to the banking business, and they controlled that banking
business In such a way that an industry could always get
the use of money to pay wages with, that would be con-
trolling supply and demand in the use of money, and later
on they handled that money for war purposes without
Interest and taxation. That nation would solve Its un-
employed problem, and if It went to war against people
that taxed themselves for using money, It is more than


likely it would win the war unless tt
money in a manner equal to it or better.
the other handled
The above is Germany and ourselves.
As this simplicity of the mystery has been set forth in*
Australia, the question is whether the reader will struggle
and surge and assist this movement with their coin and
their brains, so that we can go further than Germany from
a moral point of view. Germany has allowed the small
private banking companies to remain, tout is controlling
them as above described. If we amalgamate our small
banks into one large bank, not one for the whole Common-
wealth, but one large bank for each State, and swing the
whole of our energy into war, our allies can follow suit.
This to be done without interest or taxation. The German:
Federal Council' would then know that we are ahead of
them. The German Government rely on us crippling our-
selves by taxation. Will we do it?
THE CIECULATING SOVEREIGN.
The little book with the above title was copyrighted
16th October, 1903. The first address on the subject mat-
ter was given at St. Clement?s Debating Club, Mosman
Bay, the same month, and the work done with this book
afterwards in the Labour ranks forced into existence the-
present Federal Bank. There are too many official records,
of addresses given in New South Wales and Victoria in
leagues and unions for anybody to dispute this fact. Plat-
forms are open should anyone like a debate. The book
was sent to several papers for review. Some refused;
some refused but began to plagiarise from the book. Some
did the honourable thing. ?Freeman?s Journal? reviewed
it twice and predicted a great circulation (June and July,
1904), equal to ?Progress and Poverty.? The ?Banking
Review? gave it two pages of adverse criticism. They
acted honourably, they did not try to suppress. The
?Bulletin? refused a review, but tided to ridicule it in reply


to some correspondent. The writer called on the ?Bulle-
tin? and was toM by the editor they had never seen the
book. I said, ?How do you come to say this about it
(showing him his paper) if you have never seen it?
There has been quite a lot sent to you for a review.?
He said, ?Have, you a copy with you?? I handed him one,
which he immediately opened at page 10, and read:
?You will hear people repeat in their ignorance, and
newspapers state also, that we receive manufactured ar-
ticles in the place of money. It is absolutely untrue.
Dealing with our country as one huge account, as we
deal with countries when we speak of them, we have ex-
ported mor� In value in raw material and gold to the
United Kingdom and foreign countries, than we have re-
ceived Sn manufactured goods as under?:
(The little book then pointed out that we merely got
into debt, to use our own money).
I said, ?You knew where to find it.? He seemed to get
annoyed, hesitated a moment, and said, ?I?ll prove you
are wrong. The years the New South Wales Government
have sold Bonds in London, those years the imports have
been large.? He then quoted some New South Wales
figures, and he said, ?Isn?t that right?? I replied ?Fancy
you asking me! However, thanks for your argument. I
have been waiting for some ?expert? to make a fool of
himself over this book, and I can now explain to people
why it is I have quoted the figures for Australasia and
not figures for a State. lam often asked why, but would
not give a reason. Now that you have been so silly over
?this book. I?ll explain to enquirers why.
The reason is this: In dealing with banking the 'whole
territory over which the banks operate must be taken.
Banks do not know anything about political boundaries.
For instance, the Bank of New South Wales and others
have branches in all Australia and New Zealand. All the
business of a county is worked, through the banks, and
if they went short anywhere, through say, Australian
transactions, they would use a New Zealand surplus to
square the account, or vice versa. This is why in our
colonies the schemes Freetrade and Protection have


fallen so far short of certain theories. Not that either
is any good for the man on wages. The ?Bulletin? did
not know this.
May tell you more about the ?Bulletin? from the plat
form.
The little book dealt with that awful financial mon-
strosity called borrowing money in London, where the
Governments pawn our country in London and then begin
to use our own coin. It is a certainty no money comes
here, so the ?Bulletin? and ?Sydney Morning Herald?
commenced to say that goods came here.. The ?Sydney
Morning Herald? (May 9, 1904), said; ?One of the planks
of the Reform Platform is economy. When loan moneys
are rolling in, or their equivalent, imported goods and
material, it is practically impossible to keep the break
down, etc.? The ?Bulletin? said: ?A country imports
more than it exports and then borrows to pay the
difference? (November 24, 1904, ?Answers to Correspond-
�nts,? and other editions up to date.)
Anyone knows that a Government goes through the
pawning process when it wants the use of money. It is
not worrying about imports and exports, and it does not
worry how the trick is worked so long as it gets the usa
of money.
The present book, in the chapter ?The British Empire,?
explains how the goods-by-way-of-loan idea came into
existence. One of the Bega District papers (27/8/1908),
wrote: ?J. M. Scott is up on the North Coast writing oa
the export .of gold, and borrowing in London. In the
Ballina ?Beacon? he tackles the ?Bulletin,? the ?Tele-
graph,? and the ?Herald? on the subject, and he appears
to have got the ?Bulletin? tripping.?
Of course this does not matter, but it is right that thf
public should know. ?
There was a lot of work done in New South Wales anj
Victoria. - The Victorian Labour paper, ?The Toesin?
(26/6/1905)fi said; ?The Executive of the Melbourne
Trades Hall further reported on the banking business as
propounded by ?The Circulating Sovereign/ and recom-
mended that same be referred to the Central Executive of


the P.L.C., with a view to having It brought before the
Inter-State Conference. ?Adopted.?
One day in Melbourne (1906) a stranger accosted the
writer with the remark, ?How are you?? The- reply was,
?Still on the earth!? He said, ?It would not matter if you
were not. You could not take back the work you have
done. We are debating it in our union, and banking will
soon be a matter of every-day discussion, I can see the
solution ot our problem is in the banking question.?
With the advent of the Federal Bank, the idea of bank-
ing seemed to be growing, and the writer stopped his
crusade to try and pay off Ms debts. This was done, but
during that time (1908-1912) articles would be published
<n different papers. The tension between ourselves and
Germany caused an address to be given in Gulcairn, Sep-
tember, 1912. In 1914 war broke out, and unfortunately,
the prediction in 1912 seemed to be developing. On the
suggestion of citizens who were acquainted with ?The
Circulating Sovereign,? and the previous addresses, the
present book has been written and an effort made to draw
attention to the banking business and its bearing on this
war.
The Sydney ?Telegraph? (30/12/1907) kindly opened its
Financial Columns to a discussion of the little book, and
their financial editor sets forth the following reasons for
the gold shipment from Australia:?
(1) England works with a smaller amount of gold than
foreign countries.
(2) Australia?s gold has been sent away to get rid of
a superfluity.
(3) Australia sends its gold to pay its debts
(4) Australia sends its gold to countries short of
money. ....
(5) Half the gold In the banks is the property of Eng-
lish gold-mine owners.
Readers can debate the pros and cons of the above. It
Is true that there is less money in Britain than tjSsre is in
France, Germany, or the States, but we want to point out
that it has taken all this gold to keep Britain in exist-
ence in her transactions with foreign nations.


From Australia .................. �568,000,000
New Zealand ............... 82,000,000
Canada . . 57,000,000
South Africa ................ 464,000,000
�1,171,000,000
Gold production per certificates for Federal Statist
dated 30/9/T5 and
Australia's population would have been 100,000,000 to-
day, only for this sort of thing.
Here is the secret of Great Britain?s financial reputa-
tion, sovereigns robbed from the Colonies per the medium
of banking system controlled from London.
In reply to No. 5, we might ask, how much money
to the credit of our Savings Bank depositors do English,
mine-owners own? Does the reader know that the whole of
the sovereigns to the credit of the ordinary bank depositors
have been shipped, and in addition half of the sovereigns
to the credit of our Savings Bank depositors. That is to
say, if we got together all the money in the banks, and
all the money out in circulation, there would not be 10s
in money for every �1 the Savings Bank alone owe their
depositors.
The ?Telegraph? at the same time stated we do not
need money, we need capital.
The only capital Australia needs is a little light among
the public on the inside working of the banking business.
It might be mentioned that the ?Circulating Sovereign*
was a purely original production. After the book was
written, it occurred to the writer to have a look at other
nations to see what they were doing in banking to discover
what Lloyd George has . since stated. We were only a
second-rate power. The writer with his pen and from the
platform has pointed out that the so-called Australian,
public debt is a banking debt due from London to Aus-
tralia. Bonds were sold in London, Australia as a country
has not been paid for them. The gold shipment is pur�
treachery. If the ?Bulletin? did not discover this, as it
should have, it should not be annoyed because somebody
else did. The ?Bulletin? method of keeping our money


here is per a Customs Tariff. We would point out that a
tax on goods imported, or a tax that would, keep goods out
altogether, would not prevent a bank controlled from out-
side shipping gold. So long as a bank keeps enough to
meet the current demand of its depositors, the balance
over that can be shipped just as the bank likes. For
instance, the Australasian banks owe their depositors
�200,000,000. The whole Australasian public only use
�3,000,000. There is �40,000,000 in reserve in case of a
panic, and the balance is gone. The ?Bulletin? is like the
people who always said the earth is fiat,, and then wanted
to hurt the man who pointed out it was round. They had
the brains to see the truth, but were wild they had not
seen it first.
Are the banks London controlled? The Bank of Aus-
tralasia is purely a London affair, and one bank like that
could bleed a country white. If there is any doubt about
the Bank of New South Wales, just get a Royal Commis-
sion to audit their affairs with London. There are the
other twenty banking companies.
Not that this thing matters much now; but it is good to
know about it.
THE BRITISH EMPIRE.
Our Empire has a history of 2,000 years from 55 8.C.,
the landing of the Romans, to date. In spite of our age,
we are always young, through the new thoughts con-
tinually evolving in the brains of the men in the colonies,
and there is no chance of us decaying. If left to the
brains of the men in Britain, we probably would fall to
pieces. The hope is in the colonies. With Britain,
Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, we have
a territory three times as large as all Europe. We have
only a population of 65,000,000 white men. Germany on
her small area (two-thirds the size of New South Wales),
has about the same population. We are weak on this
point. There is India, of course, but India is a nation by
Itself held in trust by the ?Union Jack.?


Since the days of barter, men have used a medium of
exchange. In time it became made of metal?gold, silver,
and copper.
In the reign of Henry VIII., things were very bad. There
was little money, and what there was moved very slowly.
Some Lombard money-lenders landed in England at the
time, and their small knowledge of handling coins made
all the difference. So great was the effect they had, that
Lombard-street, London, is called after them to this day.
The something that altered things was the use of money,
?coins. Things staggered on till 1694. The money business
up to this was small, just small pawnbrokers practically,
called goldsmiths. Britain had just been through the
Stuart trouble. France declared war on England over the
accession of William 111. The problem was a continuous
flow of money to the Government to equip for war. Direct
taxing was useless. A Mr, Paterson thought the idea of
a larger money-lending business, and the Bank of England
came into existence. Coin which before was hid away by
its owners, was brought to the bank. The bank passed it
to the Government, the Government paid it to the soldiers,
.sailors, and for their equipment. The coins moved round
liberating enterprise, and came back to the bank per the
medium of storekeepers and others. The same coins did
the same circulation over and over again.
The, Bank of England came into existence to provide
Parliament wtih �1,200,000. This was the first Public
Debt.
Previous to William Til. and Constitutional Government.
"Kings used to obtain money by tax " gatherers, borrow
from their nobles one way and another; practically do
what they liked with the money, and that was the end
of it. ? Under the new order, people placed money with
the Bank of England, the bank loaned to the Parliament
?or Government (not to the King), the Government taxed
the people for interest due to the bank. It would be diffi-
cult to trace the existence of half a million money in all
England at that time.
The Bank of England was the foundation of modern


commerce. It is out of date to-day. It was founded in
1694, the Bank of Scotland following next year.
There is a chapter in this book given to the greatest
financial brain of the world, to William Paterson, founder
of the scheme, the Bank of England.
Britain and the rest of Europe staggered along as they
did till 1851, when the gold discovery in Australia sup-
plied Great Britain first, and from her to Europe, with
that common tool of trade, the absence of which prevent-
ed development, namely, money?gold?the legal tender.
Men?s energies were liberated in Europe by it, and Aus-
tralia is responsible for that. The money first and the
slow development of the banking business afterwards.
Since 1694 the evolution of British banking has been
very slow. It has hardly moved at all. Three nations have
evolved beyond us?Germany, and the United States, and
Japan. Had we continued stationary we would have been
left behind by these three.
[a the early stages of the evolution of trade and com-
merce, when a trader in one country wanted to pay
in another country, for goods purchased, he sent goods
across the border, sold them, and with the money obtained
paid the debt. If a government or an individual wanted to
borrow money from someone in another country, some-
times money was sent, but naturally the borrower
wanted the money current in his own country, so goods
were brought or sent over. These goods were sold, in
the borrower?s own country, and the coin obtained handed
over.
It was this practice that gave the ?Bulletin? and ?Syd-
ney Morning Herald? the idea of goods coming to Aus-
tralia by way of a loan. The/ have not evolved beyond
this primitive knowledge.
This practice became too cumbersome, and traders in
different countries arranged with bankers to handle money
between countries. That is, if a person wanted to pay
in another country, he arranged first with his own bank,
and let the bank do it the best way it could, and so the
bankers? knowledge grew, and things called remittances
came into existence, and the banks became the centre of


all commerce, and the banker through cross-entries dis-
covered that a wonderful lot of business could be done
on very little money-?just enough to square up a balance.
People in their simplicity called this credit.
Again, owing to shortage of money, and because a bank?s
only strength is its gold, a Continental bank did not care
to part with its gold to another bank in a foreign country.
At the same time the creditor bank pushed for gold, and
In their difficulty the Continental banks looked to London.
Every ship after 1851 was bringing gold to London,
and the Continental banks obtained their gold from Lon-
don. In time it was suggested that all Continental banks
do their foreign business through London, London under-
taking to square their balance of-accounts with gold, and
this is how London became the clearing centre of the
world. London got a reputation, the foreign nation got
the substance, and the bubble is bursting. It has only
been a flash for 60 years. It is ending.
London, through the colonial gold mines, became the
centre of the world?s commerce.
Some experts have been wondering will New York
take the place of London in this matter. The American
bankers are not silly, not on the terms London has' been
doing it at. London has existed by the gold robbery from
the colonies and was not aware of it, London allowed
?Germany and others to grow on this gold, and did not see
it. More than that, ?The Companies? Consolidated Act
of 1908? allowed German banks to open in England, to
work on England, what England had been working on us,
and when one reads the ?Telegraph? quoted herein in a
previous chapter, one can easily see left to the protection
of the ?Telegraph,? anything could be worked against us.
English critics have the same simple minds as the
??Herald,? ?Telegraph,? and ?Bulletin.?
When war broke out, papers of this class put out sensa-
tional head-lines, Hit foeiow the belt. They told how the
#erman bankers had robbed England of some twenty
million sovereigns.
The Colonies have been hit below the belt by England


for eleven hundred million sovereigns, and these papers
either never noticed it or have been guilty of worse.
The British banks have not evolved one bit hardly since
16-95, hence the British Empire?s small white population.
They have hampered the development of their . own
nation?s industries, but could always supply foreigners
with gold. The Australian banks are the same. Money is
always tight inside the British Empire, while millions and
millions of sovereigns have always poured into foreigners
from us.
The British banks have never evolved beyond asking
its own nation?s citizens could they show a security o!
�lOO for an advance of �6O or less, and they never got
their brains beyond making a profit by interest. The
American and German banks are far ahead of this, hene�
their development.
Whatever may be the physical and mental qualities of
the Briton, on this money question he has not been shrewd.
Perhaps destiny controlled it all, just to give Germany the
opportunity of becoming the Greatest World Power. We
think Germany has had the chance and missed it by
this war.
it does not matter about the past, oisr business is th@
future. Join us.
AUSTRALASIA.
The first settlement in Australasia was on the 26th
January, 1788, when Captain Phillip landed with 1,030
people, all told.
In 1851 the population was 430,000; in 1856, 900,000; in.
1901,4,500,-000; in 1914 (estimated), 6,000,000. (The figures
are Australia and New Zealand.)
The information we get from the above is this:??
It took 63 years for our population to grow from 1,000
to 430,000. Then in five years the population doubled.
It has now taken us 58 years to increase by 5,000,000. Why
did not the population .keep ? increasing as it did between


1851-1856? Why are we not now a hundred million people?'
What was it that caused the half-a-million people to risk
the ocean journey so far back and come here as they did?
We must look over the events in our history for aa
answer.
In 1851 gold was discovered; money was discovered, and
this brought people from unemployed, stagnating Europe
here. Why did they not keep coming? In ten years from
the date of the gold discovery, that is, between 1851-1861,
�100,000,000 worth of gold had been shipped to London.
There was no need for men. to come to money when money
is flowing to where they are. This flow of gold set Europe
working, and the continuous stream since, as per page 19,
has kept men from coming here.
An increasing population can only happen where the
money is an increasing quantity. Australia's money inside
our country has been very slow on the increase, hence
our slowly increasing population. How much money do
you think our country has been getting the use of?
Previous to the advent of the Federal note, the amount
of money in circulation in the seven colonies was:??
Hold, �2,332,000; silver, �524,000.
That is 12s. 6d. per head. This is in accordance with
the Victorian Mint?s Certificate, dated 3rd May, 1910. This
Mint set out to see how many light gold coins were tn
circulation, and it had every bank and branch bank in
the Seven Colonies working to a system for the purpose.
Incidentally, of course, they got to a nearness the actual
money in circulation, and the above is a certified copy of
their report. Of course, there was the ordinary bank note
as well.
The money is the sovereign, silver is to split up the
sovereign, copper to split up the silver; a bank note is an
order for gold, a cheque is the same, and a bill of ex-
change is the same as a cheque between countries. The
base of all commerce must necessarily be that from which
the legal tender is made, and this is gold and gold only.
If a country does not increase its medium of exchange, it
cannot possibly increase its population, except to the ex-


lent that a- substitute for the legal tender is supplied, as.
bank note.
Before the Government note came along, there were
about six million bank notes in circulation. The Govern-
ment printed �41,121,179 10s (per Treasury certi-
ficated dated 13/12/T5). The banks took these, gave the
Government gold for about a quarter of them, and placed
the balance to its credit. There are now about
6,000,000 of these notes in circulation amongst the
public. The balance are idle in the banks. If you look
at any bank balance-sheet you will see the amounts idle..
Those circulating have merely taken the place of the old
notes and our gold circulating medium. , They have don�'
nothing else, except perhaps carry along some disease
germs. So much for the Government note just now.
Money, gold, may or may not be wealth. It is not worth,
while debating this point' Money is greater than wealth.
Money is that common tool of . trade. whereby human
energy is liberated in the production and exchange of
wealth. If it be not in circulation, there comes the human
stagnation, and if it be not an increasing quantity there
must necessarily be a fixed population.
Whatever controls the circulation of the money controls
the destiny of the individual, and the destiny of the nation.
If Australia flies a foreign flag as the result of this war,
the blame is at the door of the banking business. Which-
ever way one looks at it, whether done innocently, igno-
rantly or deliberately, there has been treachery to Aus-
tralia.
What has been the gold production? Australia,
�568,000,000; New Zealand, �82,000,000.
What amount of gold do the banks owe us? They owe
us �200,000,000; the Savings Banks alone, �80,000,000.
How much money do we get the- use of? The amount in
the Victorian Mint?s report is less than �3,000,000. It gets
you thinking, does it not?
It has always been difficult to get a newspaper to open
up a ventilation _of this matter. Continual pressure had
Its effect. One of our leading' dailies' stated, ?that had Aus-
tralia?s gold been retained here, Australia would have


been a howling -wilderness.? When the paper was asked
what it meant by ?retained/? did it mean ?used,? the reply
was no, it meant retained, and not ?used.?
The ?Sydney Morning Herald? (17/12/1906) wrote:?
?The people of Australia had entrusted them (the banks)
with their hard earned 'sayings, and would require them
back again with interest. No excuse would he accepted,
lor non-payment when the due date arrived, so the surplus
capital of the banks' had been shipped to London and
invested there. It is not with malevolent design that this
Australian gold is being utilised abroad instead of within
the Commonwealth, but rather with a feeling of sorrow,
etc., etc.?
The balance of the article went on to say in its own
language that Australia was not a safe place in which to
use the money belonging to the people living here. This
article alone'should have produced an upheaval.
Are we a fool people or what?' What protest could
we produce if the Creator decided to hand Australia to
someone else? Not only has the whole of the gold to the
credit of depositors in the ordinary banks been shipped,
but half of our Savings Banks gold. The ?Herald? should
be sent to Berlin to get it ?when the due date arrives,?
lor it is not in England. All the money in England is
less than �250,000,000.
The worries of the early settlers were interesting, and
all owing to this money question. There were a few coins
brought out with the settlers, but the circulation being
had, there was bankruptcy and stagnation. There were
no banks until 1813, when the Bank of New South Wales
?opened. Previous to this, ? people tried to exchange on
their promissory notes. This was alright until someone
with a number of them wanted to travel to another colony
and asked for money. Trouble came then. Then an at-
tempt was made to pay in orders for rum, called the ?rum
currency period.? This was a failure. These were at-
tempts to work on credit.
The coins in the colony at the time were mainly Span-
ish?the Spanish dollar. English sovereigns, naturally
?enough, hardly existed and any coin was used as the


medium. The Bank of New South Wales was suggested
by Governor Macquarie, and this got over the difficulty..
A few shareholders opened the bank, and people brought
along any old coin they has The records in the early
Bank of New South Wales are in dollars. Gov-
ernor Macquarie had 10,000 silver dollars made in
England for the colonies, and this is the only
British capital that ever came here. Shortly after the
opening of the Bank of New South Wales, it was noticed
that the Spanish dollar became scarce; it began to dis-
appear, money became tight. Suggestions were asked for..
It was pointed out that the quantity of silver in that dollar
made it desirable to ship away. Governor Macquarie by
proclamation directed that, a piece of silver be struck out
of the centre to reduce its weight, and so two coins were
obtained. The holey dollar, afterwards called ?Holy Dol-
lar,? and its centre, called the dump.
One can see the money was not safe, even away back
in the early days. Just let one's mind picture what has
happened after the gold discovery.
The history of the progress of man is first money, and.
then the bank.
Other banks opened here, London controlled, and the
gold robbery started. In Australia the banks are com-
panies, with branches spread throughout the land. Several
of them have branches in every State in Australia, and.
New Zealand as well, and under this system any one part
of the Seven Colonies would be . robbed to back up the
banks? affairs in any other part, and the whole country
bled to keep London.
No branch bank can finance a citisen without first can-
suiting the colonial head office. As the only money for
use here is after London has been satisfied, naturally
enough, head office finances the centres, -Melbourne, Syd-
ney, etc. The country towns have very little chance; hence
our centralisation. The solution to this decentralisation
problem is in banking. Where the money is there the
people will be.
Wool and other produce have left us exactly the same
as the gold, someone may say. The ? cases are different.


imports to date are: ?-
....... �145,682,006
�10,736,000
Total ........
...... �156,418,000
Money came into the world as a means whereby human
beings could exchange services and products. If it re-
quired,'say, �6O in mixed money to enable 10.0 people
to exchange with, then it stands to reason if the popula-
tion tried to increase to 150 while the common tool of
trade, the money, remained stationary, there would be
stagnation or unemployment, partial or permanent, with
50 people; and they would leave if they could, or commit
any crime to get them out of their difficulty. That was
the case in unemployed and crime-infested Europe pre-
vious to 1851. As the money flowed to Europe, it eased
things, kept the people there, liberated their energies,
and they became the market for our other produce, simply
because. we remained small through the money shipment
and more wool was produced than the local market way
able to buy.
Had our banking business been colonial controlled, our
population would have been over 100,000,000. London
would have been a small place. There would hare been
very few people in Europe. They would have been in
Australia. South Africa, New Zealand, and Canada, and
other gold-producing countries.
Perhaps our gold had to go to pay for imports! The
'?Circulating Sovereign,? page 10, set out the imports and
exports- yearly since the earliest records, Ihere it was
shown that one year, we imported more than we exported;
next year it was the other way about, our total exports
beating our imports all the time till 1901, when year after
year after that date, our excess of exports were millions
in excess until 1914, when we fell behind. In spite or this
temporary relapse, a certificate from the Co > uuionv ealtb
Statist, dated 30/9/1915, shows that the total exports over
(These figures include gold and other produce.)
Perhaps it went to pay for interest on the money we
borrowed? Be level-headedj do you think- Australia, that


supplies tlie world with, money ever borrowed any money
from anyone? Then what is the meaning of borrowing?
It is this: Our governments wanted to get the use of
money. Some figures, figures only, came from London,
They appeared then in the boohs of the local banks, and
the local banks passed to our Governments our own,
money, and it is nothing else. Then why send gold as
interest on figures? Perhaps it was for dividends on Brit-
ish investments here? Those investments are worked in
the same way. Figures only.
It is war times, and as the truth of the treachery to our
country dawns'on us, some of us may become sore. It is
necessary to show what has been done, in order that we
alter this state of things. Pride of race will keep us loyal
to the Empire we belong to. It may all have been done
ignorantly, and no doubt we Australians can easily realise
the robbery without any ill feeling; but we have to alter
the banking system that allows it. Britain perhaps can
have our gold er anything else as a free gift, but we must
not be robbed secretly.
We might here quote from an address given by Mr,
Russell French, of the Bank of New South Wales, before
the Institute of Bankers (May 1, 1914). The ?Telegraph"
headed the column with the report of the address as
Sound Finance. Mr. French said: ?
?It is no part of my mission to-night to claim for the
banks in this country any undue share in its colonisation.
Their first business no doubt has been to make a profit
for their shareholders. But I do claim that concurrent
with their duty, has been a sense of their obligation to
the public from whom they derive their business, and
they (the banks) have been proved to be worthy of the
enormous responsibility entrusted to their care."
Let us look at this from the point of view as an Aus-
tralian Nation, and as depositors.
Mr. French?s duty to his shareholders was to pay divi-
dends, and no one will find fault with that. How much
dividend, however? Well, just enough not to attract
attention to the business, so that it should not be taken
over. The Australian banking business tries to run things
so that a modest 10 per cent, or thereabouts dividend be


the usual thing, and this is not too much. To do this they
are at their wits? end of how to make excuses for refus-
ing first-class business that is ail the time offering. If
they did all the business they could, those dividends would
be 20, 30, 40, or 50 per cent, on their share capital, and
Australia?s population would be increasing all the time.
In spite of their suppression of enterprise, they are .forced
against their will to show more than the usual
and then to cover up matters they ?water? their
Capital. This does ? not give them any more
strength. It just keeps public attention from the-
business. While the banking business here has been
protecting its shareholders in that way, it has left them
in danger in another direction. It has caused our smaii
population, and if a foreign flag flies over Australia,
blame this sort of thing.
'With regard to the banks being true to the obligations
to the depositors and public on whose money the business-
is worked, it may be interesting to know that the banks
are 160,000,000 sovereigns short of the money entrusted
to them. It is not in Australia. Again, through this gold
shipment, the Savings Bank depositors own all the money
in Australia, and the ordinary bank shareholders and all
their .assets are at the mercy of the Savings Banks the
day they push matters.
This is a matter Mr. Russell French has not been watch-
ing.
Take it another way. Say that Australian money had
left here legitimately, actually for imports, etc. What
sort of men are these banking people who could
only finance in such a way that our wonderful country
could only get the use of less than �3,000,000 of its own
money, while the gold flowed like v/ater to outsiders.
A child could do better.
Again, half the wage-earners? savings banks money has
been shipped. Now how many times have the wage class
to pay? When the wage class purchase goods, in the
stores they pay for them. Out of the little that is left they
make deposits in the Savings Banks. Now suppose al!
this gold has gone for imports/by what right is the Sav-


lugs Banks money sent out to pay for the imports made
by the merchant? Let the wage class look at this. Their
sayings banks, do not ship gold; we know that, but the
money placed in these banks has been passed to the other
banks for use, and it is they who ship it. In 1911, if the
Barrack Street Bank?s balance-sheet' is turned ujj one
will see that this bank alone had loaned the other banks
�4,000,000. At that time the total money in all New
South Wales was �8,000,000. This was pointed out from
the platform, and quickly after that, the trading hanks
squared that debt off, and the money was loaned to differ-
ent municipal councils. Well, that does not alter the
position. These Councils would take the Savings Banks'
cheques, and deposit them in the other banks, and the
money reach the other banks in that way.
Perhaps the writer does not understand these things.
The writer knows what he is writing about. There is a
platform for anyone.
After the address to the Melbourne Trades Hall Council
(March 24, 1905), one of the delegates who was present,
Mr. Roberts, invited the writer to speak at Richmond. His
remarks the night of the address were these: ?I have at-
tended this Council for several years and have heard
different speakers from that platform, but I never heard
an address that gave so much food for thought as the
one to-night. Previous to to-night I might say I was of
the opinion that the ultimate of democracy was to be-
come a republic. That thought to-night left me. I can see a
greater future than republicanism. It is a perfect democ-
racy, brought about by the evolution of the banking busi-
ness.?
During our conversation after the meeting he said,'
'?What on earth have our members of Parliament been,
doing, with this thing worked right under their eyes. You
will have no friends amongst them,? he said. ?If they
push you forward they will be admitting what brainless
people they have been, and if you drop by the way, when
they think it is safe and you are forgotten, they will then
begin to discover it themselves.
Let us again look back to that very important event la


.Australian history, the advent of the Bank of New South
Wales, 1813, just to reason out what had happened.
The stores were not able to deal on credit or on orders
for rum, for the reasons pointed out. Governor Mac-
quarie, remembering that there were banks in England
(and no doubt other people in Australia at the time were
aware that such things existed, but did not think that the
whole problem hinged on the coin circulation), made the
suggestion to open the bank. Some shareholders were
got together and they acquired a building, and the people
who owned any coins of any sort, brought them along.
Now the storekeeper, when he made purchase, was able to
pay the seller with a cheque on the bank, that is an order
for money. Upon presentation of the cheque, if it' were
alright, the bank would hand him coin. If this coin was
used for purchasing locally, it would all be in the bank
again in a few days. This simple thing worked a miracle
almost, prosperity came, because human energy can do
anything when it is liberated. If someone with a number
of cheques or with a credit at the bank wanted to travel
to another State, now he could do so, as branches were
opened in other States. The bank would simply give an
order or a draft for money to that branch, and the person
would get the use of money where he went to. It was all
very simple, was it not?
The ?Herald,? commenting on this event, said that Gov-
ernor Macquarie, by bringing this bank into existence,
established in Australia the system of credit.
Readers, did not the people before this bank try to
work on credit and fail, and did not this event introduce
the system of working on money, the freer circulation
allowing a greater amount of business to be done? Isn?t
it wonderful how ?experts? say that the exchange is work-
ed on credit? Not that it matters.
Within a few months after October, 1903, through ?The
Circulating Sovereign,? banking became a question in New
South Wales Labor circles. Mr. Clem Johnson, Secretary
of Moree P.L.L., writing to the Melbourne ?Tocsin? (26/1/
?OS), said his P.L.L. and others were bringing the matter
of banking, as the result of this little book, before next


conference. There were Cobar League, Moree P.L.L., St.
Leonards, and others. The scheme of nationalising them,
all, while it carried a majority, did not have the necessary
two-thirds majority of the whole of the delegates who had
registered. Some were not in the hall at the time. The-
matter was brought along again in 1906 by Moree P.L.L. r
and, according to the ?Tocsin?s? report (February 15?
1906), Mr. Clem Johnson, of Moree P.L.L., ?submitted �?
motion of what is practically Mr. J. M. Scott?s scheme of
the taking over of all the banks.? This motion was again,
carried by a majority of 43- to 15. but the, scheme, being
a large one, the debate on the matter resulted in amalga-
mation of ?two Savings Banks? becoming a fighting plank
as a stepping stone.?
There are so many records in New South Wales and
Victoria, that there is no room for doubt the Federal Bank
to-day is the first fruits of the little book, ?The Circulating
Sovereign."
There was a little difficulty with the ?Worker? paper at
first. Cobar League and Moree P.L.L., so their letters
stated, said they had some difficulty in getting this paper
to mention the book, ?The Circulating Sovereign/' and
there was a bunch of interesting small items returned to
the writer by that paper in 1904. However, it was diffi-
cult to shut the matter entirely out In 1908, the writer
tried the ?Worker? with a couple of columns of an article
which they kindly published, marked it with a blue pencil,,
and sent a copy along. Mr. Lamond, I think, controlled
that paper then. Of course there is the platform for Mr.
Lamond.
The Victorian ?Tocsin? was very good. They took the?
books for sale and had a standing six-inch advertisement:
free of charge, in which they stated these facts: ?
The book was copyrighted October 16, 1903.
? endorsed by More� P.L.L. April 25, 1904.
Scheme passed as fighting plank by New South Labor
Conference, January 31, 1905.
It may seem egotistical in writing of ones own, produc-
tion in this way, bat it is simply a matter of Australian
history. It deals with the evolution of the most -important


part of any- country?s history. When Mr. Chamberlain
talked Preferential Trade, the writer sent him a note
(reply came to hand), stating that ?while he talked his
idea backed tip with money, from the highest rung on the
ladder of our Empire, and would be a failure, an Austra-
lian from the lowest rung on the ladder of our democracy
would propound banking as the solution to our supremacy
problem and the wage problem together, and while the
person?s name might never be known,' the scheme would
grow and be a success.?
The scheme grew, and the writer probably would never
Pave been known; would have dropped out only for this
war. After 1807 he did very little except an occasional
?newspaper article. The Federal Bank came, and in time
would have absorbed the other banks. It would have
taken a long time, however, without some dynamic force
behind the movement. War came, with it has come taxa-
tion, interest, high prices, and restricted circulation of
money. In banking we are a long way behind Germany,
and this is a handicap. There was the desire to draw at-
tention to this matter. Other citizens who knew, were
thinking in the same way, and hence the writer is as he
is to-day, for good or evil.
Had it not been for the wonderful organisation known
as the Labor movement, the book might have had very
little effect. Such an organisation made it possible to do
.something. The production, however, is not the re-
sult if any particular section. It is very much every-
body?s. It was not till after the book was printed
that the writer became aware that the place it was print-
ed in was a non-union shop. Again, the writer did not
belong -to any organisation. Just an Australian citizen.
In spite, of this fact, the New South Wales Typographi-
cal Association held a special meeting, and circularised
every union to hear an address on Bank Nationalisation,
as delivered by the writer of ?The Circulating Sovereign.?
The meeting was held 9th September, 1904. Again. ?The
Australasian Typographical Journal,? in its review, said;
??A copy of this little book should be secured by every
?worker in the land.?


After an open-air address one day, Mr. T, J. Kohaa
asked; ?Do yon belong to any organisation?? The reply
was ?No.? He said, ?You have a big fight; if you joined
our movement and got the idea going there it would not
matter what happened to you, the scheme would live and
become a fact.? This remark took the writer into the-
Labor ranks. Should anyone think that this organisation:
is a mutual admiration society they ought to Join it. It
is a fierce, free democracy of free discussion, such a de-
mocracy as is well calculated to produce the strongest
minded men in the world.
Here I would like to say a word to the members of
the Labor Organisation. You are where you are 'ire
banking purely through the little book ?The Circulating-,
Sovereign.? Swing now the whole weight of your mighty
army a crash on to the banking business. It is the open
door of destiny in this crisis, and it is the solution of
your Wage Problem. Debate this matter amongst your-
selves.
Do it in your own way, �r?Come follow the little book.
The writer was invited to speak at Paddington P.L.L,
one night by Mr. Kohan. When this was announced, on&
of the members said, ?I object on principle to hear this-
address. It is on merely a matter of principle and nothing-
else. I have heard these addresses elsewhere. Mr. Scott
is right, we are wrong, and I do not want to have it on,
record that our organisation took the solution of its prob-
lems from an outsider.? Of course he received no sup-
port. ,
The writer used to think at times that the action of the-
? Bulletin,? and of the ?Worker? up to 1908 was governed
by some idea like this. However the point is this: Here-
was the democracy-?the ready acceptance of the truth on.
one hand, irrespective of where it came from; the solid
opposition on the other, because they would not have it.
No one can keep back the truth, can they? Some mem-
bers of P.L.L.?s and unions got the book and pushed the
idea, so- everybody can claim it as being an all-round
Australian.
The history of the Australian Bank Note is interesting.


To begin with it is the most perfect bank note ever pro-
duced. It could only be improved by improving the bank-
ing business, that is, the Nation taking over ail the bank-
ing business. Some little time ago a bank manager asked
the writer which note I would sooner have, the Australian,
note or the Bank of England note? I replied the Austra-
lian note; and we argued it out. Briefly put, it is this:
In a gold-producing country like Australia, that note would
always be exchangeable for gold, if one wanted to go else-
where. While.it is hardly likely to happen, if all the-
gold could be cornered in England, the Bank of England,
note would have no value outside Britain. That was the-r
only difference. Not much, it is true; but it?s just the-
difference in the values if the very worst happened.
The origin of our note started in 1893, at the time of the-
bank panic. Queenslanders were born with a hatred of
these ordinary banks. It is in the blood. At the time of
the panic, they wanted to take the lot over. The banking
people got the Government to issue a note to take the-
place of their own. This was done. For years the banks
were always afraid of a run through their notes. They
were their danger-point. Not that they could not meet
their notes, but 1,000 people coming along with only a �l.
note each wall cause a panic amongst people, they would
corns with their cheque books asking for sovereigns in-,
the hundreds or thousands.
The Queensland Government note came into existence,.
It merely helped to prevent a run on the banks,
by people whose only direct claim on a bank
was the notes they held. It lengthened the exist-
ence -of these out-of-date banks. When banking be-
came a Federal matter, they again suggested the Com-
monwealth Note, for the same reason that they did to
the Quensland Government. They were afraid of their
own notes, and lived in fear without being able to think
of a way out of the difficulty. Had they withdrawn every
�1 note, it would not have required a million of gold ,t<>
have taken their place. No one expects any original
thought from a banker. After the panic of 1893 they got
together to do something clever. They decided to make a.


-charge of 10s. a year for Keeping current accounts, and
were satisfied they had really done something well. Mak-
ing a charge for using other people?s money was the first
thing a banker did in his ignorance 2,000 years ago. These
people went backwards by making that charge. Nature
all the time says, ?Move forward.?
. Some idea of their anxiety may be gathered from the
.fact that they offered to take the notes from the Govern-
ment, and give them an overdraft to the extent of the
notes without any interest. Her� was the Government?s
-chance, had they known what they were doing, and it does
mot say much for a Member of Parliament from, the United
.States that he did not know this. The Government could
have carried out some work without interest'on that over-
draft, and have explained to the people what had been,
done, and have received the people?s sanction to take over
all the silly business. Instead of that, they consulted some
as to what they should do, and as a result they
.had bonds printed, which they sold to themselves at S-|
.and 4 per cent, interest, and put this taxation on the
people, and the hankers laughed.
You see all the evidence is that those Members of Par-
liament would never have touched banking had they not
been pushed on to it by some outsider who knew what he
was doing, and they would never evolve beyond the Fede-
ral Bank, which is only an ordinary bank in its nature,
that has not to declare dividends, unless the public, again
with knowledge, push the matter further.
Speaking at times during the last crusade, when asked
how could the banks be taken over, the reply has been,
there is one simple way. Push the idea of getting all the
wage earners to ask for notes on pay-day, come along in
.a body and ask for gold at a bank. The merchants would
in fear join the crowd with their cheque-books. The next
bank panic that happens, the nation must take them over.
By the time that could be worked, however, the public
would be wise as to their -rottenness, and they would be
forced into what they should be. The bank note, of
course, now prevents to some extent a deliberate panic.
?They will not be able to stand against a great educational


crusade. We have got to do it to prevent taxation bearing:
us down daring the war* and depopulating the Empire
after the war.
There have been various Government issues of paper-
money in other countries without success. The reason ia
every case has been, whether the American green-bach, of
Law?s French issue, from the simple fact, that the Gov*
eminent printed notes and handed them direct to its em�
ployees, who handed them to stores, who took them to tha
small banks, or money-lenders, that existed at that time,
Some of these accepted them as deposits, some did not..
By this time there were a lot more coming from the Gov-
ernment. time after time. The same notes were not cir-
culating time after time, fresh notes again came from
Government; there was a dead end, and the trouble.
In Law?s case the notes were issued from a bank ha-
started, one bank amongst others. The fact that loss-
notes were coming back to him than he was issuing,
should have told him that they were accumulating at a
dead-end somewhere, and that there would be trouble.
Law?s failure was mainly due to some underground en-
gineering by some opposition banks. The trouble was the-
question of circulation like other paper issues that have-
failed.
This Australian note, handed first to all the banks, cir-
culates back to the banks from which they come there is
no dead end.
The notes you see are neither good or bad as far as
benefiting the nation is concerned. The trouble is not on.
the question of what the material is out of which the
money is made. The problem is in banking, or control o�
the circulation of the money.
There is a lot of talk about the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, and the State Government borrowing in London dur-
ing the war.
Will they have any difficulty in getting rid of Australian,
Bonds there? No, they will not. Whatever tale the Bank
of England may tell our agents, they will be only too glad,
to get these securities. The reason is simply this. These
people in England want securities to send to the United


States bankers. Nothing will be more acceptable than
securities over this wonderful country. So the Bank of
England, and the London and Westminster Bank, 'will just
put figures to the credit of our governments, in their
books. They will send the Australian Bonds to America,
they will send out the figures to the Bank of New South
Wales, and we will begin to get the use of our own
notes.
Any work dealing with Australian banking would be
incomplete if it did not mention Mr. - F. Anstey, Federal
member. The ?Sun? (25/7/?l5) stated that Mr. Anstey
had proposed to carry on this war without interest, the'
scheme to be worked from the Federal Bank. Mr. Fisher,
Prime Minister, led- the' attack against the idea which was
defeated by 41 to 3. The suggestion is history making,
and makes the idea an ordinary everyday matter for dis*
cuss ion.
I am going to state, if we cannot carry on this war
without interest, we cannot win. If we were to win on
the battlefields, the taxation after the war would just lift
millions of our population into America, where the taxa-
tion burden would not be.
- Mr. Anstey, then a Victorian State member, reviewed
?The Circulating Sovereign? in the ?Toesin? (Nov. 10th,
1904).
We do not know whether Mr. Anstey ever advocated
public works without interest before he read ?The Cir-
culating Sovereign,? but we would like to point out, that
financing this war without interest from a single small
bank like the Federal Bank could not be done unless the
Other banks- co-operated -to assist. Just for this reason,
the Federal Bank?s cheques would get into the other banks
to such an extent, that they would become creditors of
the Bank. The bank not being able' to pay them, would
be charged interest, and to meet this interest would have
to charge the government, which would tax the people.
Mr. Anstey, may pei?haps meet the writer on the plat-
form to debate this in a friendly way. Mr. Anstey ha.s
made history by his suggestion.
Does money or gold ever come into Australia? Yes, it


does. There is no mint in New Zealand, and light gold
coins are sent from there to-be re-minted, and others seat
back to take their place. Again, raw 'gold from countries
round about comes here to be minted, and the next ship-
takes it away to any country that London owes' gold to.
There is the platform for anyone. All that thing called
borrowing in London, all the wonderful amount of gold,
and produce produced here and sent away, and every
other transaction ever made, in Australia, including the
�160,000,000 of mortgages the banks held over Australia,
all this has been worked on the circulation of the*
�3,000,000 in money already mentioned.
The total foreign trade is:??
Imports, Exports.
Australia and Tasmania .. �1,902,433,000 �2,048,115,000
New Zealand ............ 509,055,000 519,791,000
�2, 411,488,000 �2,567,906,000
Giving - that wonderful ex-
. cess of Exports over
Imports ............ � 155,418,00$
(Federal Statist?s Certificate dated 30/9/T5.)
In addition to these goods,
there is another export
that does not go through
the Customs. It is Gov-
ernment Bonds. The va-
lue of these sold abroad
(out of the total floated)
can be put in safe round
figures at ...........
�200,000,000*
If we add to these other British Remittances for in-
vestment here one can begin to estimate how much Lon-
don owes the Colonies.
London is a gold debtor to Australia and New Zealand
Not that it matters. Will you Join us to take over the*
Banks?


THE UNITED STATES.
The States got their independence in 1781. The popula-
tion then was about 2,060,000. Australia started in 1788
.about the same date. The United States have grown to
100,000,000 people, Australasia to 6,000,000 in the same
time.
Men poured into the States on the discovery of gold
Just the same as into Australia. Hardship was nothing.
The Banks of The States were not controlled from London,
so the gold built up the banks. They in turn financed
people in the States, as the money was all the Time on
the increase. To the extent that our colonial gold mines
did not meet the requirements of the population in
Europe, to that extent people left Europe and went
where? To the place where the money was, viz., to the
United States. This is the population question in a
nutshell.
The first banks in the States were Just anybody opening
a place and putting up the sign bank. This was necessarily
so. Just picture the early days and rush and people won-
dering where to put their money. . These small banks
naturally only loaned to people close handy to them and
hence there are so many inland towns in America, fa
time companies like our own came into existence, an 1
-there are in the States to-day the. two kinds of institutions
operating together.
This last 25 years there has been a development dif-
ferent to anything under the "'?Union Jack.? The little
banks were too timid for the operations of the growing
.ordinary business, so a bunch of men, headed by Morgan,
caused a run on 68 of them, took them over and began
-.to operate as ordinary business, manufacturing and sell-
ing, backed up by their banks. A bank is the only busi-
ness in the world that has money brought to it for noth-
ing, that is, just for a receipt, and any ordinary trader
.receiving coin like that all day would soon out-compete
.a business that is like our British businesses, merely
accounts in some other bank. Let any merchant think
-this out; and let him picture what he could do with a
bank at the back of him..


The Dank after making provision to meet tne demand�-
of its depositors has the unasked, for coin to use as it
likes. Our Australian banks do advance a little to non-
depositors. All the business done in Australia is done
on �3,000,000 gold and silver, and on this the Australian,
banks make payments every year in figures of
�1,000,000,000. Now a merchant can see what the Mor-
gan crowd were after when they went in for taking over
banks. It was they who caused the run in 1907.
The panic brought down a line of- banks which they were
after. Morgan offered to see the banks through with gold
for a high interest. This gave him control. Twenty
million sovereigns went from London and Paris to these*
banks. Just think what this meant to this combination,
See what the Australian banks do year after year on the.
same old �3,000,000 of money. The same banks that
closed their doors in 1907, have since bought out two-
thirds of the whole United States Railway System for
�141,000,000, by merely putting the figures to the efedit
of the sellers in their banks? books, or by giving them
some Gold Bonds.
Our little book in 1903, and this one are pushing tor a.
greater scheme than any United States brain ever though*,
of. These books are pushing for the solution of our Em-
pire Supremacy Problem, and the solution of oUr Indus-
trial Problem, and they will do it.
The United States Government is a weak thing, just
like our Australian or British Governments. They are-
all merely accounts in a Bank. They are bank accounts,.
A merchant is a bank account, our governments are the-
same. All government works are private enterprises.
The position between the British Empire and the United-
States to-day is this: The British Government to get
munitions have placed with the American banks soty
�100,000,000 worth of securities. On the strength of
these those banks paid American manufacturers with
their own American money. Nest year there may be*
another �100,000,000, and so on. If we do not move for-
ward in Australia; the following could happen after the-
war. The American and English bankers could put their


Heads together. They could instruct our Australian banks
?to squeeze up everybody here. It could be suggested that
?our railways go in exchange for these bonds. ' Anything
could happen to us while our banks are controlled from
Uondon.
When we take over the Australian banking business, we
will have brought about the large banking combination
?on earth. Being purely under local control, it will not
be used to tighten things by outsiders. The coin directed
?over Australia, up will go our production. If we liked
we could run our railways free. Anything at all could
-fee done, the American would be checkmated, and if a
United States banker got hold of this book he wall know
Ibis game is up.
If we could run raw production to our factories free of
?freights and distribute again free of freight charges, no
??outsider would have a chance to sell his manufactured
r .goods here.
Let half a dozen business men just think this thing
?out. Whatever should be done could be done.
If you are a merchant, how wiil you stagger under ;
?bank squeeze. We want you. It is an Empire problem.
GERMANY.
The British Empire and the United States have just
happened along to what they are. The Creator gave them
.?great territory with wonderful resources. We, the British,
?did not seem to understand what we had.
The ruling aristocratic class of Prussia decided or
willed to be great, Prussia in time took control of all the
Uerman kingdoms, and thought out a constitution which
?gave the population practically no power to govern them-
ssbives. Their Reichstag, the people?s house, has to en*
dorse the decision of the Federal House or be dissolved.
'This left the governing class free to put into execution
their plans, without exposing them.
' The first thing essential to a nation was money, hence
we find a demand for 200,000,000 sovereigns from France


in 1870. They did not ?want goods to be sold in Germany
�nd German money handed to the Government. They 'want-
ed origins! gold. They got it. There was not �100,000,000
money in France. The French people brought along their
jewellery, the French banks supplied what they could, and
the balance came from where do you think? It came
.from London, and London robbed it from the colonies.
If there is any doubt on this point, just let the reader
recall to mind paragraphs in our newspapers with ship-
ments of sovereigns reaching Sweden from Germany re-
cently with dates 1870-71-72, and so on. There is only one
nation that mints sovereigns, and that is ourselves; and
naturally the Germans, when paying Sweden, would be
asked for sovereigns, as they are current anywhere.
A nation that deliberately asked for gold in 1870, knew
why, and since that time would keep adding to it?s store,
seeing how easily it could be obtained. All British ex-
perts like the ?Times,? ?Economist,? ?Herald,? ?Tele-
graph.? ?Bulletin,? say that gold' is no good; bo the Ger-
man could easily get it. If you. turn up the British Trade
returns with Germany, you will find that there has been
a continuous flow of gold to Germany since 1870. There
is more gold in Germany ? than in France and England
put together, not that this' matters now. The question
to-day is the method of handling this money or gold. If
it were merely a question of quantity, our gold reserve is
the unmined gold in our Empire?s gold mines. Critics
have wondered why it was the French did not stagger
under that 200,000,000' gold indemnity. Little wonder they
?did not. It was we who staggered.
What did Great Britain get for all this gold? Australia
sgot nothing, and the British Empire now is being paid
anything it ever did get. The British banks in the past
got book-keeping entries only against Foreign Banks and
-?a reputation.
The German nation evolved through the process of
tariffs and subsidies. Gradually the brains of that country
?came straight on to Banking Itself, and arranged things
so that the industry had to employ the workman, and
the bank had to allow the industry the use of coin to pay


the workman. This solved the unemployed problem, an�'
kept their population at work under directions, building
up the wonderful commercial and military power we know
of. The Federal Council went further still, and for war
purposes to-day the money is moving round without any
taxation as it should be.
We are being hamstrung first by our banks restricting:
the movement of money, secondly by our Governmeats
tasing us for the work, we are doing, thereby causing,
poverty. Who has the advantage as far as arrangement
is concerned, do you think?
Germany applied taxes before the war we know, but.
that was more to keep their wage class from having too
jauch to their credit, and to mislead other nations, rather
than from any necessity to apply them. A Government
that controls all the banks of a country does not need
taxes to obtain money. It may apply taxes for other
reasons.
The mere fact that Britain, Franc�, and Russia asked
the Germans to stop the armament development because
it was too large a burden for their people, while the Ger-
mans did it all without impoverishing their people is quite
sufficient evidence that the Germans knew more about
handling money than these other people did. As the Ger-
mans did not intend to stop, Britain, France, and Russia-
banded together. Why? Because of the might of Ger-
many, and when people tell us that Germany is going to
collapse because of her weakness, they do not know what
they are saying. We have got to beat the Germans
through our strength, and our strength alone.
In March. 1905, the writer gave an address before the
Victorian Trades Hall Council on this banking question.
Shortly after that, one day in Collins Street, one of the
German Government Intelligence officers sought an inter-
view. He said: ?I am a member of the German Govern-
ment Secret Service. Of course your Government know
all about us, and we present our credentials here. My
business is to report to my Government on the woiking
of your very democratic industrial legislation in this very
democratic country; and also to report on the birth of


any new thought "that we may come in contact with. You
-have been speaking a new and original thought. Will
you discuss it with me? I do not say that I approve of
it or otherwise, but I .would like a discussion.? He, stated
that he had attended open-air addresses in Sydney, 1803-4.
I said, ?Yes; I saw you there. You were there often. A
speaker will soon pick out brainy faces in his audience.?
He had reported to his government at the time, and
wanted more information. We discussed for a couple oi
hours these problems (1) How to govern a country with-
out a tax; (2) How to apply a tax so that it would not
?be felt; (3) The gold reserves of different European na-
tions and their values in times of peace and war; (4)
How the gold robbery of a country is carried on per the
Banking business without the victim, knowing, and simi-
lar questions in banking. He had reported to his govern-
ment at the time, and wanted more information. We
?discussed for a couple of hours these problems.
After the discussion he said, ?If war broke out, what
then?*? ?Bring it round in, 10 years,? I replied, ?or
you will be too late. Some of these Trades Hall people
have grasped what I have been trying to tell them. If
they bring it round before you, Australia will depopulate
Europe, and your people will come here as Australian
?citizens.? He said, ?I could wish w� settle this supremacy
problem without war, but We parted. At times the
memory of the interview has come to mind, and on three
-different occasions I have repeated it from the platform.
(It may only be a coincidence, but legislation allowing
foreign banks in England was passed since that date).
?Mr. Chamberlain in 1902 realised what Germany was
becoming, but did not grasp how. Lloyd George saw how
much better off the German workman was than other
workmen he knew, and copied off them their National
Insurance scheme. This scheme was out of date in Ger-
many years ago. The actions of these two men should
shift out of anyone's mind the idea that interna! Germany
is anything but something very strong.
Through control of the oanks the German Council bad
brought round a perfect private enterprise. A censor over


the press, however, prevented public opinion getting free
play. Just as our Australian newspapers shut down on
the attempts to try and ventilate the rottenness of the
Australian banking. It is the same principle.
The number of coins paid to German workmen were
not i'o many as paid to our workmen, hut they purchased
more goods, and it is the goods we live on, not the coins.
The coins are the tools of exchange.
The German merchant paying less coins for work dons
than the British, could easily undersell the British goods
when he tried, and being backed up by the banks as they
were, the German metal buyers could easily give higher
prices for base metals than our own metal merchants.
It is not necessary to go into matters like municipalism
and its enterprises in Germany. It is sufficient to point
out that Berlin is the model city of the world, and this:
sort of thing is not brought about by ignorance.
Speaking at Culcairn, Sept., 1912, the writer tried to
describe the weakness of Australian banking, and what
had been done elsewhere, and stated that if the German,
Government would just take another step forward along:
the line of right, and explain to the people how things
were done, their standing in the world would last for all
time. One little step forward for good. Put all these
banks into one National Banking Combination and bring
round better than Bellamy?s ?Looking Backward,? or one
step the wrong road, the step for war.
If we could have taken the banking move in 1912 it
would have prevented war. To beat Germany we are-
forced to take it, and our British supremacy for all time-
will be admitted by other people. We will have solved
the civilisation problem.
The German Chancellor of the Exechequer quite- re-
cently came before the Reichstag, and asked for un-
limited credit. This was granted, .of course. ?He said
our estimates cover �600,000,000, and I might state that
certain patriotic citizens have given us their cheques-
without any interest. The amount obtained this way, of
course, is necessarily small. Our war banks will do


Ihe balance, and there will- b� no war taxes for interest.
With regard to the amount of figures building up In the
books of the war banks they will be attended to when
-the war is over.?
These war banks are merely offices apart from the
other banks in which the clerks are doing the book-
keeping. This loan thing and money spending, you see,
is only handling the same coins on paper over and over
again.
This war is forcing the evolution of banking, is open-
ing the door of a new civilisation. Will you assist in
?the movement In Australia? Everybody is wanted.
JAPAN.
Japan has been a miracle this last 40 years, for the
same reason that Germany has. At a time when it was
a capital offence for a Japanese to leave his country,
some young men, who afterwards played a prominent
part in Japan?s development, left Japan to find out why
it was the white man could come all the way from
Europe and do things, that the Jap had never thought
of.
Amongst other things these young wanderers noticed,
that white men had banks much larger than the money-
lenders of their own country, and that these banks be-
yond doubt were the secret, whereby big things were
done. When these seekers after information received
permission to return, the banking business was one of the
.first things Japan improved. The proposition mentioned
previously happened. Banks such as we have came into
?existence, and enterprise grew apace. Later the Japanese
?Government opened a bank just like our Federal Bank,
but controlled that bank, instead of being controlled by
it. That bank has been a thing of life, now for some
years, and on its operations grew the army, the navy,
and the industries which would be considered of first
national importance. For instance, take the ironworks
at Lithgow. Such an industry as that, either in Japan


�r Germany, would have the banking business at its.
back, making a certainty it would become all it should,..
We all know the struggle our industries lave.
Nothing amused the Japanese Government so much a�
to hear white ?financial ex perts? like the ?Bulletin/'
?Economist,? and others express the opinion that the war
with Russia had them financially crippled. How could a.
government become short of the use of money when fi-
lms control of the Imperial Bank?
The growth of Japan?s army, navy, and commerce since-
the war all proves the nonsense of our experts? opinions^
When the German appeared in China, the Jap. was
faced with a different proposition as far as white com-
petition was concerned. There the German had the sup-
port of the German banks, a support which was enabling:
these people to push our influence out of China. German
influence and German control of China was a fact, if
destiny did not stop it, and nothing suited Japan better
than to assist white nations to push the only white nation,
that worked to a system backed up by the whole national
money power.
Just let us see what this German competition would,
mean to us in dealing with China. We can gauge it by
their competition in Australia, Take one thing we -are-
all acquainted with, as it has been made public, the base
metal trade. The Germans ousted our own metal traders,.
?Why? Simply because they were able to pay a higher
price for it than our own people. There was no other
reason, and why could they do this? Because their mer-
chants were on a better financial footing than our own,
and that is because of their banks being so close to-
their commercial enterprise. Just exactly similar things,
would happen in any country where German competition
met ours; in China it would be the same. All these
things are governed by the money power, irrespective
of the qualifications (spiritual or mental) of the individual.
The German extension in China was a menace to Japan.
We were like a water-logged ship in the race, and wo
are very foolish if we close our eyes to it.
As we Australians stand to-day we are at the mercy


of the good faith of our Japanese Allies. If they play
the game, as we expect them, they are more than men.
How many white nations are there that could resist the
temptation?
You can blame the banking business for this. It has
left us with so small a white population. It is very in-
teresting to look and see destiny working.
At the time the alliance was made with Japan, the
writer was at Ballina, and put an article through the
Ballina ?Beacon.? Condensed, it was thus: ??
?Is this alliance the beginning of the end of the
white race? White nations' in the past, have con-
trolled the colored, by dividing them, and using one
portion against the other. That peculiarity in our
race came down from our Roman ancestors. To-day,
one section of the white race has been divided from
another section by this alliance. ?lf in a little time
there occurs a war, in which the white people are
killing the white, and the Japanese come in to assist
in the slaughter, it will only be a repetition of his-
tory working the other way about, perhaps only
adjusting things.?
I am going to state that if we hang on to the old out-of-
<fate way of handling money, it is the end of the British
?Empire whatever might happen to the rest of the white
race. We must move forward or go out. Have we time
to do what we should, or is nature tired of us, and will
nature prevent us seeing the simple truth?
Can you see this simple truth? Then step Into the
-movement.
FRANCE, ITALY, RUSSIA.
These people are out of date like ourselves. They have
a number of banks who do business with the small agri-
culturist, which we have not, hence their comparatively
large rural population. The term "Credit Foncier? came
from France. Put into English it means ?advancing mo-
ney against land security.? From this, our Savings Banks,


particularly in Victoria, instead of handing their deposit!
over to the other banks direct, began to use it financing
the small land man in that State. Westralia does it, ana
other States hare followed more or less. Members in
Parliament sometimes still use the expression, it sounds
clever. Naturally, benefits followed the practice in Aus-
tralia, and the term in itself, conveys the information
that these European countries see the benefit of, and
make a practice of doing business with a class that our
ordinary banks, British and Colonial, would hardly touch.
For months after the outbreak of war, the writer
watched French news, hoping that, the Government there
would have taken a leaf out of Germany's book, and have>
taken control of the whole of the banks and carried on
without interest. Just recently there has come the news-
of the French Government Loan, and the silly interest
and taxation is going to happen.
This is what has happened up to this time. The Bank.
of France has been giving the Government an overdraft,
to carry on with. Government cheques on that bank have
been getting into other banks, putting the Bank
of Francs in their debt. .In the opinion of its*
management, this is no good to it, so it has advised the
Government to sell Bonds to everybody. The' Govern-
ment will deposit the money and cheques on other banks-
with it, and this process will enable it to square its ac-
count with opposition banks; and allow the Government
to get the use of the same money over again.
? If our Government tried to carry on this war without
interest from our present Federal Bank, this is just what
would happen. Take over all the banks into one and the-
thing is settled.
Some reader may take exception to criticisms passed
on banks. He might say, ?Surely th�s@ people ought to
know what ?to do.? We might also ask, ?Why did not
some one think of the Bank of England before 1694?
Why did men not think of backing up their business with
banks before the American business men did? Why did
people wait for Governor Macquarie to suggest the Bank
of New South Wales? Why did the Australian public


themselves not pry into this Loan and gold shipment
before?
The questions must remain unanswered.
The Bank of France is only a Joint Stock Company*
like any bank in Australia, except the French Government
guarantees its solvency. It was founded in 1800.
The Bank of England is Just the same. Only a private
shareholder Banking: Company, guaranteed by the British
Government to give a sense of security.-
One perhaps looked for a lot to be written about the
Bank of England. Its invention was a wonderful thing in
1694. It has not kept pace with ths times, and is out of
date. The British Government guaranteed it, in ordef to
give the public confidence, and in return it undertook
to meet any demand the Government might have for
money, charging interest.
It got an increased temporary reputation with foreign-
ers after 1851, because they could get gold from it. The
gold came from Australia. Since then the German, Ameri-
can and Japanese method of handling money have left
it behind.
Talking of the Bank of England to-day against the Ger-
man Imperial Bank, for War or Commerce, or against the
Japanese Imperial Bank for War or Commerce, or
against the United States Banking Combines for Com-
merce, would be on a par with writing on the virtues of
our Nelson's ?Victory? against an opposing ?Dread-
nought.?
AUSTRIA, TURKEY,
Austria has about 50,000,000 of a population. Turkey
has about 13,000,000. The size of the population depends
on the necessary amount of medium of exchange being
available to enable the population to produce and ex-
change. Australia and New Zealand carry about
6,000,000 people, and take about �3,000,000 in circulation.
The amount per head is governed by the amount
of coin handled out as wages. Countries where
a lesser number of coins Is paid as wages would


?carry in proportion a larger population than our
-country, hence we find the larger populations in Europe
than we find here on the same total quantity of money
In use. Either of these countries are ahead of us in
population, with all our wonderful continent and its
money mines, etc. The development of the whole of this
part, of Europe, including the Balkan States this past 10
years has been very marked, and the goods that came to
Australia from Austria show a very high manufacturing
?development.
British influence at one time was strong in the Balkans,
tout it has been superseded by German influence, and
why? Only for one reason, the money reason, the only
power which controls all men and all things in our civili-
sation. When Britain had the gold in quantities to
handle, and other people had not, then British influence
?was something round these parts. As only about 10 per
?cent, of our gold production remains under our flag, it
?stands to reason other nations had the gold, and German
?evolution in hanking did the rest. At the beginning of
the war, we read of a little trouble in handling money as
far as these Governments were concerned.
We see since Germany took over Austria?s affairs, that
?three Austrian Ministers have been ejected, one the Minis-
ter of Finance. The Germans would shift him. If we
overhauled the Austrian and Turkish banks to-day you
would find German officials, and the banks beginning to
co-operate as in Germany. There will not be any diffi-
culty about the circulation of money in these countries,
now, and the inhabitants will say, ?Oh, wonderful Ger-
mans ! ?
The influence the Germans have over the Balkan King-
doms in all a money influence. There, of course, may
also be the inclination one way or another by the.rulers
or the Crown Heads, but as to the ordinary nobleman
who might have his own opinion?well, there are very
few who have not got a price, and the German skill in
handling money would soon produce the price.
When we think of our way of going to war ,and compare
it with other peoples' methods, it is somewhat astounding.


The writer was shown a letter dated Constanti-
nople, September 29th, 1914 (a month after war
was declared), in which It stated that about half
the industrial population of that town had been,
mobilised and put on to the production of neces-
saries of war. The writer of the letter was an English-
man, and he was wondering what we were doing. When
one thinks of this and thinks of ourselves, one begins to*
view these people in a different light to our orthodox
contempt we have for every outsider. German b anker a
controlling the Turkish banks would make a certainty of
the Turkish Government getting the use of money.
We have to win this war anyhow, but we can't win it
the way we handle money.
PAPER.
We hear remarks about the enemy carrying on this
war on paper. Just let us look at ourselves:??
The Australasian Banks owe their depositors �200,000,000
The total money in Australasia is .......... 40.000,000
On paper only �160,000,000'
The Banks in Britain owe their depositors �1,100,000,00(1
The total money in Britain is less than .. 250,000,000
On paper only �850,000,000
The debts of the banks to their depositors to tnes�
multi-millions is represented by paper, and paper only.
If the small amount of actual money could be cornered,
the whole of the rest of the banks? assets would be worth
nothing, simply because they could not be sold.
If the figures- were taken for German banks, American
banks, or any banks, they would show about the same
proportion of shortage. It merely proves what an awful
power a small amount of actual money is when kept in
circulation.
In times of war, the gold circulating medium is with-
drawn,and paper money substituted. This is the case in


Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and elsewhere,
The reason is to prevent people burying their money, and
as far as possible to prevent an enemy subject taking
gold away to his own. country. There is no more paper
in Germany than there is in England.
BORROWING IN LONDON.
'"Freeman?s Journal? (4/6/1904), in a review, said:?
-"In a most ingenious, learned, and able little book, en-
titled "The Circulating Sovereign,? the process of raising
a loan in London is graphically described.?
It quoted the whole chapter, whicn, condensed, stated
that our agents in London pass over our bonds. Tne
buyers pass over their cheques. The cheques are taken
to the bank in London. The Bank of England, and Lon-
don and Westminster Banks wire out figures to tne
Colonial banks, and we then use the same money over
amd over again till the figures are built up. The money
is our own Savings Bank coins.
In reviewing The Circulating Sovereign,? ??Freeman?s
Journal? mentioned that a publication exposing the
treachery to Australia called ?Peel?s Papers,? had? been
suppressed by the British Government in 1893. The writer
when he saw this remark, tried to get a copy of those
papers without success. However, this item of news
should arouse some curiosity in the present state of our
minds over this war.
MAKING HISTORY.
There is one Sydney newspaper the writer wants to
thank. It is the "Evening News.? When other papers
had no space for the ventilation of this banking or finance
superstition, the ?Evening News? opened its columns from
.December 29, 1903 to January 18, 1804.
The result was a debate in the ?Moree News,? between
ih writer and a Sydney gentleman, who tried to support
the ?Bulletin? theory, of goods-by-the-way-of-a-loan, backed
up by all the writers on International Trade that could


be raked up. The writer simply laid bare the inside?
machinery of the banking business in this sort of transac-
tion. If the ?Bulletin? knew a little more it might be of
gome value.
Members of the Moree P.L.L. watched closely the de-
bate and passed this resolution�
"That this P.L.L. endorse the little book, ?The Circu-
lating Sovereign' as being the solution of our financial
and industrial problems.?
This was making history. The book had gone beyond
reaalS. WSIS you push it further?
THE GRIFPITH-NORTON THING.
There appeared letters in the "Sun/' 29/6/15, and the-
"Navvy," 14/6/15, by J.M.S. Condensed they are
under:?
In 1815 news reached London that Napoleon had worn
The banks closed their doors, and some people offered
securities at any price. A man called Rothschild, who*
owned next to nothing, wrote cheques for �5 and there-
abouts, and bought these securities. Next day news ar-
rived that Wellington had won. The banks opened their
doors. Rothschild handed the banks the securities, and
on the strength of these the banka made good his cheques.
This laid the strong foundation of the present Rothschild
House.
One hundred years have passed since then.
In 1915, a Premier called Mr. Holman, said there is no-
money to be had, as we live on imported capital. A
Limited Liability Company, with next to nothing, had Just
come into existence, and said to the Premier, "You mort-
gage every man, woman and child, in New South Wales
to us for �10,000,000, and we will get you some imported
capital.? This mortgaging was done, and this company
got the securities over New South Wales. Per arrange-
ment with the local banks, these securities have been


Landed to these banks, and these banks are handing
the Premier some of the bank notes that another Premier
?called Mr. Fisher, had printed.
These notes will be handed to the men for their labor,
they will hand them to tradesmen for goods, the stores
will deposit them in the banks, the same notes will com�
round again and again, until the figures �10,000,000 will
fee built up.
Certain work will be done in New South Wales by our
.own men, paid with our own notes, and the people for
mil time will be taxed �500,000 a year, which will go to
this Limited Liability Company. .
This is finance. It is not one bit worse than any other
?swindle called borrowing money in London as far as our
?country is concerned. This awful thing, however, nas
wiped, out any doubts that the reader may ha ve about
it.
If the bonds or securities are purchased by some Ger-
man bank from Griffith-Norton, Holman will have allowed
-?an .invasion while our boys, are away In Europe losing
their lives.
Any man wh� realises this and does not tighten hit belt
?for a punch at something, isn't any better than the people,
?who worked It. - What about you? it is the present little
tin-pot banking system that makes such a thing as this
possible.
WILLIAM FATEESON.
FOUNDED THE BANK OF ENGLAND,, 1�94.
BORN 1658-?DIED 1719.
This gentleman came from Scotland. At 17 years of
*.ge he left home, travelled through selling
in other words, a commercial traveller of that
.period, and went afterwards to the West Indies. He re-
turned to England with certain schemes in his mind.
France and England had been at war since 1689, the
taxation burden was growing too great for the English.


A loan was suggested, people pm their names down tor
�1,000,000. The question was how to get the cash. Peo-
ple might hare property to any value but, it is the cash,
that things are worked with. There was not half a mil-
lion of money in-all England at the time.
Paterson stood out and practically said, ?111 fix that-
Bring along whatever you have to some place; we will
call the place the Bank of England, and 111 undertake to
supply the Government with all the money it needs, and.
will never ask them to repay it. They can pay interest
while they owe it, and can repay the debt as they like.?
The original thought here was: A Loan that need never
be re-paid unless the borrower choose. Just a continu-
ous debt.
Fancy -propounding a scheme like that to the financial
experts we know of, had they lived in those days! la-
spite of themselves, Paterson made opponents do what
he wanted. Money was brought along to what was really
the first bank. Before this it was merely a matter of
tinpot little pawn-shops, goldsmiths.
Paterson passed the money to the Government, as it
circulated back to him he passed -it to the Government
again, and instead of �1,200,000 as first thought of the
Government owed �21,500,000 at the end of the war,
Britain could not have carried on except for the brain
of Paterson. This bank was the foundation of modem
commerce, and kept England first in banking until the-,
further evolution of banking in the United States, Japan,
and Germany. It Is out of date to-day owing to the-
brains of men who run it and who write on these mat-
ters. Paterson was one of the Directors for twelve-
months and resigned. His colleagues were too thick,
in the head to go further.
It is quite possible ' that a brain like this man had
could have seen how to let the nation have the use of
its own money without interest, and so prevent the crea-
tion of slums and bankrtipcies. The bank never evolved
one step since the day he left it. Colonial gold gave it
a little more power.
The ?Circulating Sovereign? of 1903 merely complete�


Paterson?s work of 1694, and showed how. by a One Bank
.system the people could have the eternal loan free of
taxation, and we have to do this today to win the war.
The little book opened the eyes of a number of the brainy
members of the rank and file in' the Labor Organisation.
They forced members of Parliament to talk banking
against their will. The banker trying to evade the
pressure made a loan to them, in exchange for our notes,
free of interest.
Let the reader here stop and think what the book of
1903 has done. Just a little book of 39 pages, with the
?simple truth, not backed up by any authority, but in
?opposition to all authorities, the scheme purely original,
plagiarised from no other man?s brains, nor from any
-other man?s writings, purely Australian from start to
finish; that little book working day and night in about
ten years had rounded up the Australian banking busi-
ness until it forced Loans to the Government without
interest, and that was the paddock the little book set out
to drive the banks into
The writer? is claiming this for Australia, the country
he belongs to. No other nation in any part of the world
conceived such a thought before the publication of the
book. It has forced a wonderful thing in money, and the
book will force every bank in the world, and will stop
the United States combinations.
This is being written as if Paterson were looking on.
The writer did not know what Paterson had done until
the preceding chapter was written (except the fact that
he founded the bank), when the idea occurred to try and
discover what had been in Paterson?s mind. The infor-
mation could easily have been missed. Do you know there
are some writers on the Bank of England who never men-
tion his name, or merely cut it short by stating ?the bank
was founded by Paterson in 1694,? and yet it was his
brain that created the weapon which made Britain's
might. Will the Commercial Travellers take a note of
-this?
William Paterson left writings in which he advocated


that the banking business sliould support industries Just
??as the Germans have recently evolved to.
William Paterson, the founder of the Bank of England,
must have turned in his grave, ?
(1) when Mr. Fisher, Federal Premier, taxed the
people 3 J and 4 per cent, for what he had secured as
their agent free of interest,
(2) when Mr. Holman entered into that unholy con-
tract with Griffith Norton, pawning all New South
Wales to a company to use the notes that Fisher
printed, and taxing the people half a million a year.
Note how the little book placed in the hands of Fisher
and his party, a weapon the power of wmich they did
not realise. It had forced ?Loans without Interest." By
*c doing it had placed the destiny of all mankind , in their
hands. The solution of the industrial problem after that
was merely a side-line. They knew all about the book,
and now stand as they do.
Look back at page 14, proposition 6. Fisher had been
placed three years ago equal to where the German Chan-
cellor is to-day. Both these men have had the fate of
the human race- for good or evil in their hands. Both
have missed. It will-be interesting, after the war, to dig
up out of Germany, where the Germans got their ideas
?ol banking from. Was it Paterson?s writing, or iroin else-
where? Or did they evolve of their own account.
Fisher?s party got theirs from where they did, and
?decided to tax Australia.
The German Chancellor had the power from where he
did, and used it for war. Am Inclined to think both these
are not original thinkers. Had it been original thought
with them, they erald only have used the power one way
?for good.
This, again, is being written as if Paterson were here,
Paterson met with the parasite brain in his time, to wit
Law and others. He never mentioned them, but it is a
.pleasure to hit some of them to leg. This should Interest
merchants, manufacturers,and other employers. Paterson
was a trader, ' and previous to 1&94 probably had never
?done more in banking than you have. That is doing-your


business through one of them. The goldsmith of his tim�
would have the kind of brain one would meet in a pawnshop
of to-day, or in a Mont� d� Piete. However, having tl�
constructive brain that the trader has to have to exist,
when Britain was faced with the money problem of 1894
Paterson would soon solve the problem. Every step for*
ward in banking since that time has come from the
trader ?not the banker; the former is the creative brain,
the latter negative brain. The men in America who forced
the evolution of banking were traders. They got tired
of the restrictions of the negative brain. You, the mer-
chants, here and elsewhere, have on the on� hand an im-
possible barrier, an impossible finance or banking system-
round you. On the other hand, you have demands being-
made for more money from your employees. You' know
better than they do, that whatever coins you pay out,
you have to get back on the price of your goods. The
wage class are no better off, perhaps a bit worse, and you
are hampered. The whole of the staff of the banking
system are wage-earners. You are being jambed between
the two. You have got to force the banking business,,
and then assist in the evolution to a higher civilisation..
You will do well during the evolutionary process. There
will be no bankruptcies.
Look back to page 26. There you will see �41,121,17$
worth of Government notes printed. Our newspapers say
these are in circulation. They are not. There is over
�30,000,000 idle in the banks. These financial paper�
really think they are in circulation. Why are they idle?
Simply because of this. The banks do not want to show-
more than about 'the usual 10 per cent, dividends. You
men are being turned down every day on good risks under
the excuse that money is tight. Here we have unemploy-
ed, men willing to take on enterprise, and there is this
hamstringing. Some intellect has to get into this bank-
ing business, and when, you push in on this matter you
are only following the example of Paterson, and those-
United States merchants.
The writer of this book is a trader, and it Is out of
the trader?s brain that enterprise flows. This book i�


written for two tilings, to thaw attenion to banking
and its relation to war and commerce, and to sell the book
-of course. Its your business, then buy it in quantities. 4 '

;after being hit with our Customs-war-tax, and the Income-
wai?-tax, had to be sold for �125. You who are importing
igoods from Britain know the increase. The war? tax there
is about one-third of people?s incomes. Well, the goods
have to carry that, add to this the Australian war taxes,
and w� get the reason that caused Judge Heydon's re-
marks. 'You would have no chance of competing with
German, Japanese, or American goods after the war. The
German Chancellor knows how we are burdening our-
?selves, and time on this matter fights for Germany. How
long could we carry on under this impossible banking or
system of handling money? Not long.
What could be done? Take control of the banking busi-
ness (Fisher you see for the . past three years has had
money passed to him free of interest, the total is many
many millions, foolishly he taxed the public for it), keep
those notes or money in circulation for war purposes free
of interest, hence no taxation. Down would come the
price of goods, freight trains free if you like?
the civilization problem solved.
It seems wonderful that our nation has been first in
liberty always. Is it destiny?
This book of course, will reach bankers, merchants,
newspaper writers, and others. We are faced with an
Empire Problem and we must win whatever has to alter
to enable us to do it. Will you to-day get together to
complete the work Paterson started with the Bank of
England? Some one had to point it out.
A SHOETEE CATECHISM.
Ii there a fight betv/een the employer and employe�
class? Yes. The fight is very similar to the fight


between tie cate wbose tails were tied together anU pnt
across a clothes-line. Instead of breaking the cord that
held then,, they tore each other to pieces. The co,d
that has both employer and employee in a Knot M the
impossible finance we are working to. This book and-
the book of 1903 will put that right. ?
' is there any other reason why the finance system should,
be kicked into perfection? Yes. As the system is to-day,
our soldiers who are fighting for us, are being taxed for
interest on what they are doing. That thing called the-
war debt is being made up by the money value of them
wages and the munitions they are using to protect .us,
and they and their families will be taxed interest on it,
and we must alter that.
What is the gold production of Australia alone? Five
hundred and sixty-eight million sovereigns.
Give an idea of what that means:?Picture- a line o
1000 men drilling, then picture 1000 of such
is one million; then picture if possible that mass five
Hundred and sixty-eight times as great Instead of men
think in sovereigns. That is what a banking system
controlled from London has robbed Australia of, and after
allowing for gold used for Jewellery, etc., it is just the
money requirement of 100,000.000 people, and these people
?would have been here had these banks been Australian
controlled.
Make perfect our Banking System/and the affairs of
men will adjust themselves by a natural law- Will yo�
help?
