The Chancellor and Council,
The University of Melbourne.
Gentlemen,
In accordance with the terms of my appointment as Director of
Obstetrical Research under the Edward Wilson {The Argus ) Benefaction I
have the honour to forward herewith my report on the subject of Maternal
Mortality and Morbidity in the State of Victoria.
The information gleaned in the course of my investigations emphasized
that a survey along the lines indicated by the Obstetrical Research Committee
was essential.
An Interim Report was submitted in November, 1926, and this further
statement, while it does not materially vary the earlier findings, is an extension
based on fuller investigation.
I desire to record an expression of my appreciation of the manner in
which Government Departments and Hospital Executives and Proprietors
made available all information and particulars necessary for my work.
The value of this report would have been materially diminished had it
not been for the whole-hearted support of the individual medical practitioners
of the State.
I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
Yours faithfully,
R. Marshall Allan,

REPORT ON MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY
IN THE STATE OF VICTORIA.
BY ROBERT MARSHALL ALLAN, M.C., M.D., F.R.C.S.E.,
F.C.S.A.
The subject of better protection of the lives and health
of mothers during childbirth has aroused considerable
public interest within recent years, especially in English-
speaking countries. There has been a gradual realization
that much of the mortality and subsequent sickness is
preventible and that the health of the mother exercises
a far-reaching influence on infantile mortality.
It is to the credit of the medical profession in Victoria
that persistent efforts have been made by them during the
last ten years to raise the standards of obstetric practice
in the State. When the Melbourne Permanent Post-
Graduate Committee was formed in 1-920, obstetrics was
given a prominent place in its activities. Post-graduate
classes and lectures were arranged not only in Melbourne,
but also at country centres, while the Women’s Hospital
was the first Australian obstetric hospital to hold an
annual residential post-graduate course. In 1924 the Vic-
torian Branch of the British Medical Association appointed
an Obstetric Inquiry Committee which later published an
important report. This was followed by an essay com-
petition. In 1925, by reason of the generosity of the
Edward Wilson (The Argus) Trust, a Director of Obstetri-
cal Research was appointed to inquire into the causes of
maternal mortality and morbidity in Victoria with instruc-
tions to suggest means to prevent or lessen the same. In-
-1926 the Federal Royal Commission on Health made the
following recommendations regarding maternity hygiene:
1. The establishment of a division of maternity
hygiene in the Federal Department of Health.
2. Conditional subsidies to States to provide facilities
for attention to women before, during and after
childbirth.
3. Amendment of the Maternity Allowance Act —
(a) To provide that application for the allow-
ance should be made at least five months
before child-birth. No payment to be made
unless a medical certificate be produced
showing that the mother has had antenatal
supervision;
(b) No child to be deemed viable which measures
less than 14 inches in length.
4. Conditional subsidies to assist in the education
of medical students and nurses in obstetrics.
5. The encouragement and development of research.
From this survey of the work already done in the State
it will be seen that the medical profession, fully alive to
the importance of the subject, has therefore been in the
forefront of the endeavours being made to meet the
situation.
Scope of the Investigation.
The first step taken in this investigation has been an
attempt to secure accurate and complete statistical informa-
tion regarding the extent of the problem in Victoria. It
was also considered essential to obtain first hand know-
ledge of the manner in which the maternity services of
the State were working. This involved personal inter-
views with a large proportion of those medical practitioners
engaged in the work, as well as an inspection of all hos-
pitals licensed to admit obstetric patients. In addition,
attempts were made to investigate various problems con-
cerned with puerperal sepsis and the toxsemias of preg-
nancy. This was done by the collaboration of specialists
attached to the Women’s and Queen Victoria Hospitals
and expert research workers from the Walter and Eliza
Hall Research Institute and the Bio-chemical Department
of the University.
The final results of this threefold investigation into
statistics, the practice of obstetrics together with clinical
and laboratory work are now presented. Although many
questions have remained unanswered owing to lack of
time as well as necessary data, the evidence available is
sufficient to warrant conclusions of practical importance.
Part I. — Statistical Investigations.
For the purposes of this report the statistics dealing
with Victorian results have been compiled from the State
returns. In some cases the official figures have been sub-
jected to close scrutiny and alterations made where it was
clear that causes of death had been entered under incorrect
headings. The Commonwealth figures have been used for
all inter-State and international comparisons.
Fallacies and Possible Omissions in Statistics of
Puerperal Mortality.
In no State of the Commonwealth is it obligatory to
note on the death certificate whether pregnancy or labour
had occurred within a reasonable period of the death
or was definitely associated with the cause of death.
In addition, varying interpretations have been placed on
certificates showing more than one cause of death. There
has been a tendency to classify deaths as non-puerperal
wherever possible or to under-estimate the number of
deaths due to puerperal sepsis and thus give an erroneous
value to the puerperal death rate. However, close co-
operation between Federal and State statisticians during
recent years has resulted in records as accurate as it is
possible to make them.
Faulty Certification.
The number of deaths due to puerperal causes is
probably under-estimated owing to faulty certification. A
detailed inspection of the death certificates for the past
ten years shows that in some cases no real cause is given
or else the cause is stated in vague terms which preclude
correct classification, for example: severe parturition,
paralysis, collapse, chronic peritonitis, general chill of
pregnancy, pregnancy jaundice, pio-hydro marasmus.
Some certificates give the impression that either the
medical practitioner has not diagnosed the cause of death
correctly or more likely that he is unwilling to certify to
the true cause, for example: myocarditis, encephalitis,
pneumonia, influenza. This applies particularly to cases
of puerperal septicaemia and is due mainly to the unreason-
able attitude of the general public, who invariably blame
the medical attendant for all such deaths.
It is clearly evident that the Victorian Statistician is
hampered first by the use of a careless nomenclature by
some doctors and secondly to a greater extent by his
inability to refer any dubious certificates to the medical
practitioner for fuller details. In Great Britain, for
example, in 1925 the Registrar-General issued 8,800 queries
and received 7,900 replies regarding doubtful certificates.
This enabled the records to be clarified to a marked
degree.
Estimates of Omissions due to Faulty Certification.
The Statistician makes use of the register of births to
note whether childbirth might be regarded as a complica-
tion of death in all females between fifteen and fifty. Many
cases are added to the puerperal list which might have
been otherwise omitted. This method is inapplicable, how-
ever, to cases where death occurs during pregnancy without
the birth of a child.
A small number of deaths in women during the child-
bearing period are classified as due to ill-defined or un-
known causes. If these had been properly certified, there
is no doubt that the puerperal group would have received
its share. Between 1920 and 1926 the deaths of women
between fifteen and fifty from these causes was 90. On
a conservative estimate that the proportion due to puer-
peral deaths was equal to the percentage of puerperal to
total deaths from known causes, ten would have to be
added to the puerperal mortality. This represents an
increase of 9% c of the puerperal deaths for this period.
The possible omission of puerperal deaths may also be
inferred from the sex distribution of deaths from causes
to which such transfers may be made. If any considerable
number of puerperal deaths were certified as due to con-
ditions such as peritonitis, nephritis, appendicitis or pneu-
monia, such a transfer would result in an undue preponder-
ance of female deaths during the child-bearing period.

TABLE I.—RELATIVE MORTALITY, MALES AND FEMALES, BY AGE GROUPS, 1922-1926.
Comparison of the number of deaths from such diseases
of males and females at different ages would show whether
this transference could have occurred.
This comparison of the relative number of male and
female deaths in age groups shows a marked excess of
female deaths during the child-bearing period. At ages
15 to 49 the number of female deaths from peritonitis
was more than twice that among males, under fifteen
the numbers were equal and over fifty the male deaths
predominated. For acute and chronic nephritis the ratio
of female to male deaths was practically identical for
ages under fifteen and over fifty, but showed a marked
increase for the child-bearing age. No such changes were
noted with appendicitis and pneumonia which are some-
times considered to be terms used to conceal cases of
puerperal septicaemia. Although there are grounds for
assuming that transfers have been made, it is difficult
to estimate this factor. The increase in female deaths
from peritonitis, for example, may be due to gynaecological
operations. In any case the calculation is inapplicable to
those diseases peculiar to the female sex to which transfers
from puerperal causes might well have been made. Puer-
peral deaths may be incorrectly reported and classified as
due to salpingitis. During the period under review 66
such deaths were noted, but no definite conclusions can
be drawn from this figure.
Summary.
Improvement in statistical returns cannot be expected
until (i) the association of pregnancy or child-birth with
a maternal death is stated on the death certificate (this
should apply to all deaths within three months of abortion,
miscarriage or child-birth); (ii) power is granted to the
Statistician to refer dubious certificates to the medical
practitioner for fuller details (it would be of material
assistance if more definite instructions and information
regarding the correct classification of the causes of death
were printed on the cover of the official book of death
certificates): (iii) the present system of open certification
is supplemented by confidential notification of the cause
of death; (iv) all puerperal deaths are investigated by
a special board of inquiry. This should consist of a repre-
sentative of the Health Department, the professor or
lecturer in obstetrics and a senior obstetrician. In addi-
tion to statistical information, much valuable clinical
data would be obtained for the information and guidance
of those engaged in obstetrical practice.
The Primary Causes of Puerperal Mortality.
The International List of Causes of Death classifies
puerperal deaths under the following groups:
1. Accidents of pregnancy. This includes abortion (if
not criminal), miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy and hyper-
emesis gravidarum. Criminal abortion is entered in a
separate non-puerperal group.
2. Puerperal haemorrhage including both ante and post
partum haemorrhage.
3. Other accidents of labour which comprise difficult
labour, malpresentations, Caesarean section and other
operative procedures.
4. Puerperal septicasmia. Septic abortions are included
under this group.
5. Puerperal phlegmasia alba dolens, embolism, sudden
death.
6. Puerperal albuminuria and convulsions.
7. Deaths following child-birth not otherwise defined.
Puerperal insanity is included here.
8. Puerperal diseases of the breast.
The relative order of these primary causes of mortality
is illustrated in Table II.
Table II. —Primary Causes of Maternal Mortality : Victoria, 1918-1927,
Puerperal sepsis is, therefore, the most important single
cause of death and is responsible for over two-fifths of
the total deaths. In most discussions on statistics sepsis is
referred to separately and the remainder of the groups
are combined under the heading “other causes.” Although
albuminuria, haemorrhage and accidents of labour indi-
vidually do not cause the loss of so many lives as sepsis,
collectively they form an important factor in maternal
mortality.
Contributory Causes of Puerperal Mortality.
Statistics showing the contributory causes of maternal
mortality are not easily obtainable. The majority of death
certificates give very scanty information on this subject.

Factors in Puerperal Mortality.
The risk of death from the specific causes mentioned in
the preceding paragraphs varies with such circumstances
as the period of pregnancy, whether it terminated with a
live or still-born child, whether the labour was normal
or complicated, whether any operative interference was
necessary and also with such factors as the age of the
mother or the interval between birth of the child and
death of the mother. The quality of the medical and
nursing services also plays an important part and will be
dealt with later.
Abortion.
It is impossible to estimate accurately the prevalence
of abortion and miscarriage. There are reasonable grounds
for suspecting that many cases have been self-induced and
that the incidence of abortion is on the increase, especially
in the larger cities. Reference to Table II shows that
abortion was the cause of death in 4-2% of the puerperal
mortality during the past ten years. In addition one-third
of the cases of puerperal sepsis were septic abortions.
Many of these were undoubtedly the result of intentional
interference. Deaths following such interference can hardly
be classified as part of the risk to which all mothers are
exposed, but in statistical returns they are included with
abortions from natural causes and cannot be separated.
Under the separate entry “homicide by other means” are
noted forty cases of death following criminal abortion;
all these cases were classified after investigation by a
coroner. For every woman who dies, many others recover,
although damaged in health. A later pregnancy exposes
this large section to increased risks from septic infection.
The prevalence of induced abortion, especially among
single women, is a social factor beyond the control of the
medical profession. The risks both immediate and more
remote following interruption of pregnancy at an early
stage have not been appreciated by the general public.
This mortality which is not decreasing, will prevent any
marked reduction in the total puerperal death rate.
Ectopic Pregnancy.
The incidence of ectopic pregnancy remains constant
both in urban and rural areas. Exception has been taken
to the inclusion of such cases in estimating the maternal
mortality rate. They cannot be prevented in the light
of our present knowledge and constitute grave surgical
emergencies. But inspection of the death certificates
show that many women die, not from the effects of loss
of blood, but from peritonitis following operation, an
indication that the surgical technique was not faultless
in some instances. There is room for improvement in
this respect, even if it be granted that an emergency
operation must often be performed in unsuitable
surroundings.
Still-Births.
Western Australia is the only State in the Common-
wealth in which the notification of still-births is required.
At present it is impossible to obtain data, such as the
mode of delivery, age of mother et cetera, to make com-
parisons with countries where such registration is enforced.
However, as the maternity allowance is paid only on the
certificate of a registrar of births and deaths, who must
also issue a certificate for burial, it is probable that the
majority are already notified, although without any details
of causation.
The still-birth rate based on these returns has remained
constant for some time and averages 30 per thousand live
births.
It is regrettable that the maternity allowance returns
do not give detailed information along these lines. As
both the Federal Royal Commission on Health and the
Conference of Australasian Statisticians in 1926 recom-
mended the compulsory notification of still-births, it is
to be hoped that this will be accepted by the various
States in the immediate future.
The Age of the Mother.
The relation between the age of the mother and the
mortality rate is given in Table IV.
Table IV. —Detailed Causes of Death by Age Groups :
Victoria, 1920-1926.
TABLE IVA.
It will be observed that the rate for ages under twenty
is higher than those for the next two groups. This is prob-
ably due to the larger proportion of illegitimate births
and also to the number of primiparce among whom opera-
tive interference is likely to be more frequent. The mor-
tality, after a fall for the second age group, gradually
rises with each successive period and at ages beyond thirty
is well above the average for the whole period. This
result probably reflects the maternal state of health,
the high rates below twenty and above thirty-five being
due to physical immaturity in the former group and to
lessened physical vitality in the latter. As most women
over thirty have already borne children, this increased
mortality emphasizes the need for better ante-natal super-

vision of all multiparw. This is a task which medical
practitioners find very difficult to carry out owing to the
indifference of such patients.
The variation in the component parts of the mortality
by age groups shows that sepsis is highest in ages under
twenty, whereas other causes of death, while high in the
first group, rapidly increase at later ages. There is the
same general trend of both causes of death by age groups,
but sepsis rises less steeply.
Table V. —Incidence of Sepsis and Other Causes of Mortality
by Age Groups, per Thousand Births.
Nationality of the Mother.
In countries like the United States of America, where
there is a mixed population, the nationality of the mother
plays a considerable part in the risks attached to child-
birth. As the population of Victoria is 98% British in
origin this factor is largely eliminated. Recent returns
show that 88% of the mothers were born in Australia, 11%
in Great Britain and other British possessions and only
1% in foreign countries.
Interval Betiveen Delivery and Death of the Mother.
Table VI shows that one-third of the total deaths
occurred during the first day and approximately two-thirds
within one week. The interval was longer for deaths
from puerperal sepsis than for those due to other causes.
Over one-third of the sepsis deaths occurred after the
end of the second week, as compared with other causes
of death, where three-fourths of the mothers died within
the first week after delivery.
TABLE VI. —TIME FROM CHILD-BIRTH TO DEATH OF MOTHER.
Seasonal Variation.
While there is no definite period during the year when
puerperal mortality is most marked, on the whole the
late autumn, winter and early spring months (April to
October) show an increased incidence of deaths. The
number of births during this period is also above the
average.
Order of Birth.
During the period 1906-1915 the number of deaths per
thousand married women of all ages in first confinements
was 5-57 as compared with an average of 4-04 for other
confinements. Later statistics are not available. Accord-
ing to Sir T. A. Coghlan, ex-Statistician of New South
Wales, the risk attending the first birth is greater than
at any subsequent one up to but not including the ninth.
The smallest risk was found in the second confinement,
although that in the third was not much greater. After
the third the risk increased rapidly.
Effects of Illegitimacy.
The illegitimate birth rate in Victoria averages 4-46%
of the total births. The increased risks experienced by
the unmarried mother are well illustrated in Table X.
Besides the unmarried woman there are many others
whose children have been born within nine months of
marriage. In both groups ante-natal supervision is largely
inadequate and complications are more likely to occur.

The present position in Australia has been well sum-
marized by the Commonwealth Statistician in the 1927
Year Book:
A comparison of the combined total of ex-nuptial
first births and nuptial first births occurring less
than nine months after marriage with the total of
nuptial children born nine months or more was about
two to three. At all ages up to and including twenty-
one, however, there was a great preponderance of
ex-nuptial births and of births following ante-nuptial
conception.
Complications of Pregnancy and Labour.
The effect of complications of pregnancy and labour
are dealt with in Part II in connexion with the conditions
of private practice. It may be stated, however, that there
is great need for much more detailed information on
death certificates regarding the incidence of Caesarean
section, forceps application and other operative procedures.
The Onus of Responsibility.
In the past much time has been wasted in attempts to
apportion between the doctor and the nurse the blame for
the excessive mortality in child-birth. Since the opera-
tion of the maternity allowance the returns show that in
Victoria the percentage of cases attended by a doctor has
steadily risen.
Table VII.— Medical Attention at Confinements.
The year 1911 has been chosen to represent the pro-
portion of cases attended by a doctor prior to the com-
mencement of the maternity bonus in 1912. It will be
noted that in recent years the rest of the State has a higher
percentage of women attended by a doctor than the
metropolitan area.
An investigation of the birth certificates for 1926 of
the metropolitan municipalities shows that in the resi-
dential suburbs the proportion receiving medical atten-
tion is over 90%, whereas in the industrial suburbs lower
percentages (58% to 88%) prevail, especially in Richmond,
Collingwood, Fitzroy and Port Melbourne. This matter is
further discussed when dealing with the conditions of
private practice.
No statistics are available to enable a comparison to
be made between the results of cases attended by doctors
and nurses separately.
Very few women in the State have had neither a doctor
nor a nurse present at their confinements.
The Present Incidence of Puerperal Mortality in
Victoria.
During 1927 there were 35,074 births and 196 maternal
deaths from puerperal causes. The maternal mortality
rate per thousand live births was 5-58. Looked at from
another angle every 175 confinements accounted for the
death of one mother. These figures are slightly better
than the average for the whole Commonwealth.
The relative importance of the puerperal group of
diseases in causing mortality among women between the
ages of fifteen and forty-five is seen in Table VIII.
Maternal Mortality and the General Death Rate.
The relative position of maternal mortality to the
general death rate and infant mortality in Victoria during
the present century is summarized in Table IX.
TABLE VIII.—DEATHS OF ALL FEMALES FROM FIFTEEN TO FORTY-FIVE:
VICTORIA, 1920-1926—TOTAL DEATHS, 9,843.
Dame Janet Campbell stated that in Great Britain,
while the general death rate had been reduced by one-third
and the infant mortality halved since the beginning of
the century, the maternal mortality had been but little
affected.
The position in Victoria is as follows:
This represents a decrease of 21% in the general death
rate and 40% in infantile mortality as compared with one
of 19% for all puerperal causes. Of the latter, sepsis
decreased by 16%, while the rate for other causes was
reduced by 20%.
Table IX.
Table IXa.
The Trend of Maternal Mortality in Victoria.
Inspection of the graph shows a general improvement
despite numerous peak periods. Three definite waves can
be noted, namely, 1870-1889, 1890-1908, 1909-1927. The
average annual rates for these periods were 62-22, 55-30
and 44-14 per 10,000 live births and show a decrease of
29% in the last period as compared with the first.

If the average be taken over consecutive decennial
periods, the decrease is shown to be progressive except
during the past eight years:
1870-1879: 63-81 per 10,000 live births.
1880-1889: 59-27 per 10,000 live births.
1890-1899: 54-53 per 10,000 live births.
1900-1909: 54-54 per 10,000 live births.
1910-1919: 42-04 per 10,000 live births.
1920-1927: 47-11 per 10,000 live births.
The wide variations of the annual figures are probably
due in part to the relatively small number of deaths and
a truer appreciation of the general tendency towards
increase or decrease can be obtained by the use of a
moving average rate for five yearly periods as is employed
in the graph.
Analysis of the Period 1908-1927
The highest rates during the period 1908-1927 occurred
in 1910, 1913, 1920, 1924, 1926 and 1927. The rate for
the latter year was the highest recorded since 1905.
In 1910 and 1913 there was no associated increase in
the general death rate nor were there any significant
epidemics. On the contrary the rates for most diseases
were well below the average.
The abnormal rise in 1920 may possibly be related to the
influenza epidemic of 1919. This coincided with an increase
in the sepsis rate and in mortality from other causes
in the latter year. It might be argued that pregnant
women who were affected in the later waves of the epi-
demic, more readily became victims to septic infections
and other complications during the following year.
In 1923 a milder outbreak of influenza occurred, but
this had probably little to do with the high rate for the
next year. No marked increase in other diseases occurred
during this period.
Likewise in 1926 and 1927 no extraneous cause of the
increased rate could be noted. In the opinion of the
Victorian Statistician the high rate was partly due to
better certification of puerperal causes of death following
on the present investigation.
Similar peak periods have been noted in all the other
States. They have not been coincident and are due in
part to the relatively small number of deaths in individual
States.
The Incidence of Mortality Within the State.
An attempt has been made to discover whether all
parts of the State are equally responsible for the mor-
tality rate. Experience in other countries varies con-
siderably. Before making any comparisons a short
description of the physical features and distribution of the
population of Victoria will be useful.
Victoria is approximately the size of England and
Scotland and is the second smallest State in the Common-
wealth, although it is exceeded only by New South Wales
as regards population. The population in 1927 was
1,727,325, equivalent to 19-65 persons to the square mile.
Although this is the most densely populated State, it
compares in a striking fashion with the figure for Great
Britain, namely 478. The nearest European equivalent is
Norway. The capital, Melbourne, contains 55% of the
total population. The principal country towns are twelve
in number; three have populations around 40,000; the
others vary from 5,000 to 8,000 and account for 11% of
the inhabitants of the State. The remainder of the State
with 34% of the population is mainly rural. The means
of communication are better and the distance of any
isolated area from a medical practitioner and hospital
accommodation is far less than in the larger States.
In England and Wales the rates are high in very sparsely
populated rural areas and in industrial and mining dis-
tricts. Wales, in which such a distribution of the popula-
tion is well marked, has always shown a higher rate than
England. London has a lower rate, especially for sepsis,
than the average for the whole country.
Rural areas in Scotland show a slightly higher rate than
urban.
The same applies to New Zealand and is particularly
noticeable with regard to haemorrhage, albuminuria and
accidents of labour and to a less degree with sepsis.
The New York figures record a higher rate for all
cases for the State as compared with New York City.
The sepsis rate is stationary in both areas, but other
causes of maternal mortality have increased in the State.
If the total figures for the United States be examined the
mortality is found to be higher in the cities than the
rural areas. The highest mortality was obtained not in
the largest centres, but in cities with populations of 25,000
to 50,000.
E. S. Morris has shown that in New South Wales the
rates for Sydney are uniformly higher than those for
country towns as well as rural and industrial areas.
Comparison of Melbourne, Rest of State and Victoria.
Table X shows that among married women in Melbourne
and suburbs the rates for septicaemia for both periods are
greater than those of the rest of the State and Victoria.
During 1923-1927 an increase was noted in all areas as
compared with the first period. The mortality from other
causes shows a greater increase in the second period than
is noted in the other areas. The rate for all causes has
increased by 6% and is in marked excess of the figures
for both Victoria and the rest of the State.
In the rest of the State the sepsis rate for married
women is lower than both the other groups, while other
causes of mortality are well above the figures of these
areas.
The combined figures for the State show an increase
from sepsis and other causes.
The table also shows the lamentable position of the
single girl, especially in Melbourne where the combined
rate is twice as great as that for married women. The
mortality in the rest of the State shows a reduction in

TABLE XI.—COMPARISON OP VARIOUS AREAS IN VICTORIA:
MORTALITY RATE PER THOUSAND LIVE BIRTHS.
the second period due to a diminution in the sepsis rate.
This high rate for unmarried mothers is largely due to
an increase in the number of septic abortions.
Comparison of Melbourne, Country Towns, Rural Areas,
Victoria.
The principal country towns included are those
mentioned in the Victorian Year Book, namely: Ballarat,
Bendigo, Geelong, Carrum, Castlemaine, Hamilton, Mary-
borough, Mildura, Mordialloc, Stawell, Warrnambool,
Wonthaggi.
The comparative trend of these figures is more clearly
illustrated in the following table.
Table XII. —Comparative Trend op Puerperal Mortality
prom 1918 to 1927.
It will be noted that the incidence of sepsis is highest
for Melbourne for all periods under review. The rural
rate is approximately half that of Melbourne, while the
country towns show a rate equal to three-fifths of the
metropolitan average.
The highest rate for other causes of mortality over the
whole period is obtained in the principal country towns.
Except for 1918-1922 the figures for Melbourne are the
lowest in the State. The rural areas occupy a position
midway between those already mentioned. Table X showed
that the high rate in the rest of the State was largely
due to the mortality from other causes among unmarried
women.
Conclusions.
1. Melbourne and suburbs show the highest rate for
sepsis and, except in 1918-1922, the lowest rate for other
causes of mortality in the State. Owing to the excessive
sepsis rate the total mortality greatly exceeds the figures
for the other divisions of the State. The industrial area,
comprising Melbourne and six of the larger country towns,
has a rate equal to that of Melbourne.
2. The principal country towns show a fairly low rate
for sepsis, but are handicapped by the highest rate for
other causes. The total figure is above the State average.
3. The rate for the rural areas is the lowest in the State.
As is the case with the other divisions, there is a tendency
for all causes of mortality progressively to increase.
International Comparison of Mortality Rates.
An international comparison of mortality rates is
difficult because of variation in the methods employed in
the compilation of statistics. In some countries the rate is
calculated as a percentage of live births, while in others
still-births are included. In a third group not only still-
births in the ordinary sense of the word, but also all
infants who do not survive beyond a certain number of
days and whose births were not registered before death,
are excluded. The completeness of registration of births
and deaths also varies. In this respect the Australian
standards have been maintained at a high level for many
years. Finally all countries have not adopted the Inter-
national List of Causes of Death. Statistics may be
calculated on a basis which excludes deaths not classed
as due to pregnancy and child-bearing, but returned as
associated therewith. If these cases be added, as is done
in the Commonwealth, the rate is appreciably increased.
Table XIII. —International Mortality Rates per Thousand Births.
It has already been mentioned that reliance on statistics
alone tends to give an erroneous conception of the true
incidence of maternal mortality in the individual Aus-
tralian States because of the relatively small number of
deaths in each case. For this reason New South Wales,
Victoria and Queensland alone can be reasonably com-
pared with other countries. A comparatively trivial
decrease in so small a total number of deaths would
place these States in a much more favourable position.
This emphasizes the fact that the slightest lowering of
the standards necessary for safe delivery of mother and
child is more heavily penalized in the statistical results
of Australia than in those of other more densely populated
areas.
Such international comparisons are, therefore, rather
misleading and in any case have little practical bearing
on the problems facing Victoria. The State cannot afford
the economic and domestic loss caused by the annual
deaths of nearly two hundred mothers from causes asso-
ciated with child-birth. The population is augmented by
the natural increase due to the excess of births over deaths
and also by immigration. During the past twenty-five
years natural increase represents 88% and immigration
12% of the population. Owing to the low birth rates
of most countries we cannot look forward indefinitely
to a sufficient quota from Great Britain to fill our vacant
spaces. Therefore, it is essential that the rearing of
children be made safer not only for the mothers, but also
for the infants themselves. Our attitude must be one
of profound dissatisfaction with the present losses and
with the standards which have been deemed sufficient
heretofore.
Morbidity.
The actual number of maternal deaths forms only a
small though important part of the problem of the total
amount of damage and disability associated with parturi-
tion. In the strictest sense this term is used to describe

those who experience an abnormal convalescence after
delivery. It is a valuable indication of the standards of
work of a medical practitioner or a hospital. If the per-
centage of morbidity ranges from five to eight, it may be
considered satisfactory, but rates, say, of twenty would
mean that the methods employed needed rigid inspection
and improvement. Further comments on this important
subject are made in Part II in which puerperal sepsis is
discussed.
In the wider sense the term covers all those women who
have survived child-birth, but who have been more or less
damaged in health. No exact estimate can be made of the
number so affected. Many women accept illness after child-
birth as a matter of course. Some attend their doctor
for treatment and a large proportion of the work of the
gynaecological department of all general hospitals is con-
cerned with the treatment of disabilities directly attribut-
able to child-birth. The records of the Women’s Hospital
show that 36% of all the admissions to the gynaecological
department were due to the effects of a previous con-
finement. Such estimates necessarily omit the larger
group who for various reasons do not or cannot seek
surgical relief for their troubles. Therefore it would not
be understating the facts to say that 50% of all mothers
suffer from some weakening of bodily function following
on child-birth. This general statement emphasizes the
need not only for the better conduct of labour, but also
for a wider realization of the value of post-natal examina-
tion of all cases. The importance of this after-care in the
prevention of chronic invalidism has not so far been
sufficiently appreciated by the general public.
The Association of Maternal and Infant Mortality.
It has been obvious to infant welfare workers for some
time that all attempts to obtain a marked reduction in
the mortality 'under one year have been largely frustrated
by the persistent refusal of the age group under one month
to react to the measures found successful at later periods.
Table XIV. —Infantile Moktality Under One Year
per Thousand Births.
Both the table and the graph show that the mortality
under one month has remained practically stationary over
a considerable period. Since 1915-1919 the rate between
one and twelve months has become less than that of the
group under one month.
Infantile Mortality under One Month.
Inspection of Table XV shows clearly that the greatest
number of deaths under one month occurs during the
first week. The relationship between these figures and
the maternal mortality rate is also shown.
Infant Mortality under One Week.
Table XVI shows that 54% of the total mortality under
one year occurs before the end of the first month. Three-
quarters of this mortality is caused by deaths within
the first week of life.
The detailed causes of death under one week for the
past three years in Victoria are as follows:
TABLE XV.-INFANTILE MORTALITY BY AGE GROUPS PER THOUSAND BIRTHS.
TABEL XVI. —INFANTILE MORTALITY UNDER ONE WEEK :
VICTORIA, 1922-1926.
TABLE XVII. —CAUSES OF DEATH UNDER ONE WEEK :
VICTORIA, 1925-1927.
It will be noted that practically all the causes of early
infant mortality are directly related to conditions associ-
ated with pregnancy and labour. Autopsy results tend
to alter the position of some of these factors. Prematurity
is displaced from first place, while the toxaemias rise in
the scale. The importance of syphilis was not noted in
the post mortem records of the Women’s Hospital as fre-
quently as was expected. The one factor occupying a high
place was that of the complications of labour and birth
trauma. Intracranial injuries were observed in 80% of the
infantile deaths following breech delivery, in 68% of
forceps applications and also in 36% of the normal
deliveries (premature and macerated infants were excluded
from the series).
Still-births and neo-natal deaths are, therefore, influenced
more by the complications of labour and the methods of
delivery than by the results of ill-health of the mother
during pregnancy. While in our present state of know-
ledge we cannot prevent every case of eclampsia or of the
other toxaemias, nor do we know much about the causation
of congenital debility and malformations, yet efficient
ante-natal care will reduce the number of premature
infants and so improve the still-birth and neo-natal rates.
The paramount importance of birth injuries makes it
imperative to learn how to limit the occasions for inter-
ference with natural birth. As has been already noted
the compulsory notification of still-births will afford useful
information which is largely lacking at present in the
State records.
An investigation was also made to ascertain whether
any particular part of the State showed a higher mortality

than other areas. The results prove that Melbourne has a
higher rate than either the rest of the State or Victoria
as a whole. This was most noticeable in regard to pre-
maturity, birth injuries and congenital malformations.
Deaths from prematurity were more prevalent in the
industrial suburbs than in the residential areas, while
the reverse was observed as regards birth injuries.
TABLE XVIII— INFANT MORTALITY UNDER ONE MONTH:
VARIOUS AREAS, VICTORIA, 1922-1926, PER THOUSAND BIRTHS.
Summary of Statistical Investigation.
1. Under existing conditions there is a sacrifice of one
mother in every 175 confinements. Although slight im-
provement has been noted during the past twenty-five years,
the rate has recently begun to rise and the figure for 1927
is the highest recorded since 1905. In addition to the
actual number of deaths, there is a very large amount of
chronic invalidism which cannot be exactly estimated.
2. The mortality is greatest in the metropolitan area,
followed in order by the principal country towns and the
rural part of the State. Sepsis is excessive in Melbourne,
whilst other causes of mortality are most marked in the
country towns. The total rate shows a tendericy to increase
in all divisions of the State.
3. Puerperal infection is the most important single cause
of death and is responsible for over two-fifths of the
total mortality. The prevalence of abortion and the high
death rate of unmarried mothers represent factors of
considerable importance.
4. Nine-tenths of deliveries had medical supervision and
the proportion was higher in the country than in Mel-
bourne. It does not follow from this that all pregnant
women have been under adequate supervision throughout
pregnancy and labour. Many women have only sent for
medical aid because of complications or owing to distances
have only seen a doctor at the commencement of labour.
5. The problem of maternal mortality is closely associ-
ated with that of still-births and early infantile deaths.
The neo-natal mortality is mainly due to complications
of labour and intra-cranial birth injuries as well as to
diseases caused by maternal ill-health during pregnancy.
As is the case with maternal mortality, the highest neo-
natal death rate is found in Melbourne rather than in
the rest of the State.
Part 11.
Administrative Control of Health in Victoria.
There is no central authority controlling the health
affairs of the State. Two departments are responsible,
namely the Minister of Health and the Treasurer.
As far* as obstetrics is concerned the Minister of Health,
through the Health Department, administers the Health
Act, Midwives Act, and the Nurses’ Registration Act.
The Treasurer, by means of the Charities Board, controls
all public hospitals and allied organizations such as nursing
societies, refuges and benevolent homes. A commission of
public health comprising the Chief Health Officer as Chair-
man and six representatives of the medical profession and
municipal councils administers the Health Act. Resolu-
tions of the Commission are carried out as far as possible
by the Health Department, although the former has no
control over the officers of the Department and cannot
expend any funds.
The Midwives Act is administered by the Health Depart-
ment and not by the Commission. Inspection and
registration of private hospitals are controlled by the
Commission and not as formerly by the local municipalities.
Public Hospitals.
The proper distribution of public hospitals throughout
the State is undertaken by the Charities Board. This
is an elective and honorary board dealing with the whole
field of public hospital administration as well as asso-
ciated philanthropic organizations. The Secretary of the
Board is also Inspector of Charities and forms the connect-
ing link between the Board and the Treasurer. He deals
with details of maintenance, equipment and general service
and in effect determines whether a proposed hospital is
an efficient working unit for the convenience of patients,
medical officers and nurses. Hospitals are approved at
selected points in order to prevent overlapping and duplica-
tion of services. Maternity wards have been added *to
public hospitals at Ballarat, Hamilton, Horsham, Mary-
borough, Dunolly, Daylesford and M-ldon, while in Geelong
the ward is not yet opened, intensions are projected
in the future at many other existing centres.
Private Hospitals.
Private hospitals are controlled by the Minister of
Health through the Health Department. If the hospital


desires to be registered as an obstetric training school
it is supervised by the Midwives Board as regards the
training regulations. This Board, although under the
Minister of Health, is separate from the Commission of
Health.
Other Organizations.
Refuges and district nursing associations are solely
under the control of the Charities Board.
The Bush Nursing Association, being a private organi-
zation, is under Government supervision only for the
approval of building plans of the bush hospitals.
Infant welfare associations are conducted by two
societies. A Director of Infant Welfare, responsible to the
Minister of Health, controls the work throughout the State.
It will be readily seen that this unsatisfactory division
of authority between two departments does not conduce to
efficiency. There are too many loopholes for evasion of
responsibility or the shelving of important matters. All
health activities in the State should be under one Minister
with a central advisory authority to control the adequate
distribution of hospitals and allied nursing and philan-
thropic organizations throughout the State.
Hospital Accommodation in Victoria.
As approximately two-thirds of all confinements occur
either in public or private hospitals, the standards
attained by both classes are of the highest importance.
Public Hospitals in Melbourne and Suburbs.
The Women’s Hospital contains 132 beds and in 1927
the number of deliveries was 2,915, a greater number
than any other Australian maternity hospital. Attached
to the hospital is a large ante-natal department from
which patients requiring hospital treatment are admitted
to the pre-maternity wards. During the past two years
the efficiency of the hospital as the premier training-
school of Victoria has been increased by the addition
of a theatre for clinical instruction and the performance
of major obstetrical operations. An after-care department
insures early correction of any troubles arising from
parturition. In order to cope with increasing demands
for laboratory investigation, an assistant to the pathologist
and a bio-chemist have been added to the staff. Adequate
laboratory accommodation is, however, lacking and until
this is remedied there will be no room for the bacteriologist
necessary to complete the team of scientific workers.
The Queen Victoria Hospital is staffed by women doctors
and admits only women and children. There is no instruc-
tion of students, but nurses receive an excellent obstetric
training. The present obstetric block contains nineteen
beds and is too small. A new wing to accommodate ninety
patients is near completion and will afford better scope
for the staff. It will then be necessary to consider the
question of training students. Regular ante-natal attend-
ance is required of all patients and the value of this is
seen in the hospital records. Attached to the hospital
is a venereal diseases department which is doing very
valuable work.
The Alfred Hospital has no indoor accommodation at
present, but there is a rapidly growing ante-natal clinic.
A complete maternity service should be possible in the
near future.
Private Hospitals in Melbourne and Suburbs.
In the metropolitan area 173 private hospitals have been
inspected and graded as follows:
■ Taking obstetric cases only 113
General hospitals with separate accommoda-
tion for obstetric cases 4
General hospitals with no separate accom-
modation 56
Conducted by trained nurses 120
Conducted by practice nurses 53
Satisfactory according to present standards
only 11l
Poor or bad 62
There was no provision for a labour ward in 56 hos-
pitals, the operating theatre was used in 32, while a labour
ward of varying quality was noted in 85.
It is a matter for regret to note that the regulations
apply almost exclusively to matters of building and sani-
tation. There is no authority under the Health Act to
compel proprietors of private hospitals to conform to a
reasonable standard of equipment or efficiency.
The following outstanding defects have been noted:
1. Many hospitals are poorly furnished and lack proper
means of sterilizing dressings et cetera. Only 40% could
be considered to possess a fairly satisfactory system of
sterilization.
2. Patients with surgical and medical affections are
frequently mixed with obstetric patients and the pre-
cautions taken to avoid infection are not adequate.
Separate accommodation for obstetric patients was noted
in only four out of 60 mixed hospitals. This type of
hospital should be abolished as soon as possible.
3. Isolation accommodation for suspicious or definitely
septic cases was absent in practically every hospital. This
should be provided in all hospitals with more than one
bed in a room.
4. In many instances the hospitals were under-staffed
and no provision was made for a nurse on night duty.
The worst type of hospital was kept by nurses who
visited outside patients as well. Patients were left for
considerable periods without any skilled attention. These
nurses should be compelled in the event of temporary
absence from the hospital to leave a trained substitute
in charge.
5. Few hospitals had a good nursery, about 5%. Infants
frequently slept with their mothers or were kept in the
staff dining-room or kitchen. Artificial feeding was pre-
valent and apparently resorted to in order to save trouble
or keep the infants quiet.
6. Many of the smaller hospitals did not keep good
records and some of the practice nurses were unable to
record temperatures. The use of a standard book qf charts
should be insisted upon. Such books might be made
available at cost price by the Midwives Board. Their
use by private nurses should also be made compulsory.
The contrast between the intermediate type of hos-
pital, St. George’s and Bethesda, and the average nursing
home strongly emphasizes the need for modern maternity
units in selected areas to replace the present unsatis-
factory private hospitals.

In the larger country centres conditions were found
similar to those in the metropolitan area. Some of the
best private hospitals in the State were established in
the smaller towns. The gradual extension of maternity
wards attached to the public hospitals as well as the
increasing number of bush nursing hospitals is having
a marked influence on country standards.
The inspection of private hospitals by the Health
Department has aroused much hostile criticism. There is
an apparent discrimination between the hospitals con-
ducted by trained and untrained nurses. Whilst the former
are frequently inspected and made to conform with the
regulations, undoubtedly many smaller homes are allowed
to continue without obvious defects being remedied. The
concentration of some inspectors on trivial details has also
been the source of much irritation. These criticisms apply
mainly to Melbourne. In the country the district health
officers have recognized that some latitude is occasionally
necessary and by such cooperation and commonsense in the
interpretation of regulations have managed to retain the

confidence of both doctors and nurses. Inspection of hos-
pitals should be frequent and strict and all should be
made to conform to a high standard.
A summary of the conditions found after an inspection
of 435 obstetric hospitals throughout the State is given
in Table XIX. It should be recorded that every facility
has been afforded for this survey both by the Health
Department and by those in charge of hospitals. Questions
were freely answered and in return constructive criticism
invited.
Table XIX. —Classification : Obstetric Hospitals, Victoria.
Nursing Associations, Welfare Societies and Allied
Organizations.
Melbourne District Nursing Association.
The district nurses are doing valuable work in the
industrial suburbs. They work in conjunction with the
local doctors or, if no doctor be engaged, with students
from the Women’s Hospital and trainees from the Queen
Victoria Hospital. All complications are immediately
reported to the Women’s Hospital or seen by a local
doctor. During the past three years the nurses have
delivered approximately 1,500 women without a maternal
death. All medical practitioners who have worked with
them, are well satisfied with their assistance.
An after-care home has been opened to accommodate
semi-convalescent patients from the public hospitals and
also invalids requiring more attention than they can
receive at home. As maternity patients have frequently
to be discharged sooner from hospital than is desirable
because of lack of beds, this home has proved of great
value to the Women’s Hospital. The extra rest so afforded
makes all the difference, not only to the health of the
mothers, but also to the prospects of successfully feeding
their infants. Extension of this scheme to other industrial
suburbs would be most beneficial.
Refuges.
The majority of the refuges do not act as obstetric
hospitals, but care for the inmates before and after
confinement. In the case of Ballarat, where highly efficient
obstetric service can be obtained at the public hospital, it
is most undesirable that the refuge should continue so
to act. The Salvation Army Home at Fitzroy is a credit
to the efforts of the matron and her staff.
Bush Nursing Association.
The work of the Bush Nursing Association has a very
definite bearing on maternal mortality in country dis-
tricts. The nurses must possess a general and an obstetric
certificate and in addition every encouragement is given
to qualify for the mothercraft diploma.
Three stages exist in the organization. First, the centre
where the nurse boards with a family and attends to
patients wherever wanted. In addition, medical inspection
of school children and instruction in hygiene are given
at the schools. The next stage is the erection of a small
cottage for the nurse. There may be a ward attached
to this to accommodate one or two patients. Finally with
the construction of a properly equipped hospital, the centre
becomes capable of attending to most patients without
necessitating their removal from the precincts of their
homes. With this class of centre the nurse does not
attend outdoor patients. There are at present sixty centres
and seventy-two nurses engaged in the work. At seventeen
centres there is no special accommodation for the nurse,
in twenty-eight a cottage is provided and fifteen bush hos-
pitals have been established at more important localities.
All practitioners in the district are entitled to look after
their patients in the hospitals. The nurses are selected
women with special qualifications and in every area visited
the medical men were enthusiastic in their appreciation
of the help afforded by them. Ante-natal supervision is
carried out in a thorough manner and all abnormal cases
referred to the nearest doctor. From 1922 to 1927 there
were 2,273 confinements without a single maternal death.
This fine record has since been maintained. The still-birth
and neo-natal deaths were also considerably below the
State averages. These splendid results are due to the
mutual cooperation of doctors and well trained nurses, the
insistence on continuous ante-natal care and the removal
of all complicated cases at the earliest possible moment
to properly equipped hospitals, if necessary, in larger
towns where more skilled help is available.
Ambulance Services.
It has been estimated that the requirements for transport
in the country would be met by the establishment of
thirty-one ambulance centres. This work has been steadily
progressing until only ten of the towns selected for this
purpose remain without an ambulance service. It is
worthy of note that the ambulance services in Victoria
are almost exclusively confined to transport activities
with as far as possible trained attendants.
The Training of the Medical Student.
A sound knowledge of obstetrics is of fundamental
importance to the general practitioner. He must know
how to conduct a labour safely, especially if complications
be present. In other diseases or illnesses there is usually
ample time available to seek additional help. This is not
the case with many obstetrical complications. Decisions
have often to be made and acted upon single handed and
any misjudgement affects two lives. Finally the toll of
death and suffering associated with parturition is formid-
able, comprising a high maternal mortality, a large
number of still-births and neo-natal deaths and much
chronic ill-health among those who survive. Because
trouble arises principally in the abnormal case, the chief
requirement is medical skill and this can only be accom-
plished by adequate training.
The Present Course.
The subjects of obstetrics and gynaecology are taught
at Melbourne University by a part-time lecturer receiving
£2OO per annum. Associated with him are three demon-
strators and a clinical tutor. During the fourth year the
student attends a course of sixty theoretical lectures in
obstetrics, infant welfare and gynsecology. The demon-
strators give lectures and conduct a course of operative
obstetrics for each batch of students. In the following
year the student enters the Women’s Hospital for his
practical course. Each student remains in residence for
five to six weeks, four of which are spent in work in
the hospital and two in the externe department. During
this time he receives ante-natal instruction from the honor-
ary obstetric staff of the hospital and attends patients
in the labour ward. The medical superintendent who acts
as clinical tutor, undertakes clinical instruction in the
wards and additional practical exercises. A refresher
course consisting of ten to twelve clinical demonstrations
is held during the sixth year. The lecturer is endeavouring
to arrange in addition residence in hospital for a period
of seven to ten days.
The main defects in this course are as follows: (i) The
length of the interval is too long between theoretical and
practical instruction. It is not easy to overcome this owing


to the demands of other subjects. (ii) The period of
residence in hospital is too short and compares poorly
with the time devoted to other clinical subjects. The
present term of six weeks should be increased to three
months in order that the student may live in an obstetric
atmosphere long enough to enable him to be thoroughly
taught, (iii) Contrary to the custom in other countries,
the amount of work done in the externe department is
rather limited. At present patients are attended under the
supervision of the district nurses. The Women’s Hospital
should have complete control of a properly constituted
externe department with adequate medical and nursing
supervision. Externe work is of service in making the
future practitioner observant and self reliant. It promotes
a feeling of personal responsibility and is a valuable method
of instruction in the art of handling patients, (iv) Con-
tinuous supervision of the student by responsible senior
teachers is impossible under the present system. Much
has been accomplished, but there are definite limits to the
value of part-time work.
Much adverse criticism has been expressed by medical
practitioners regarding the inadequacy of the course in
their day. It is recognized that improvements have
occurred, but as long as the subject is regarded as worthy
of a part-time appointment only, no real advance can be
made. The crux of the situation lies in the teacher. He
must be an experienced man who can devote the whole
of his life to the work. A limited amount of consultant
practice is essential for successful teaching, but his
primary interest must be the thorough and intensive train-
ing of the student.
The need for a Chair of Obstetrics was recognized by
the Obstetric Inquiry Committee in 1924 prior to this
investigation. A resolution on the subject was submitted
to the Council of the Victorian Branch of the British
Medical Association and subsequently passed by that body.
It would tend to improve the teaching and help to
standardize the methods employed if there were an inter-
change of examiners between the Universities of Melbourne,
Sydney and Adelaide.
Post-graduate Instruction.
The best opportunity to gain further experience is
provided by a house surgeoncy at either the Women’s or
Queen Victoria Hospitals. Unfortunately there is a limit
to the number of these appointments and it would not be
wise to increase them and so lessen the value of the
instruction. Further opportunities will be afforded when
the Alfred Hospital opens an obstetric department and
when more country base hospitals provide maternity wards.
At the same time, a scheme for establishing resident
clinical appointments should be considered.
A winter residential course is conducted at the Women’s
Hospital and is largely attended. The Post-Graduate Com-
mittee also arranges for speakers on obstetrical subjects
to address country meetings. With the formation of a
proper obstetrical department in the University. it would
be possible to conduct short demonstrations at various
centres. Attendance at such meetings would not entail
the loss of time and financial outlay which is associated
with the longer Melbourne course. Similar meetings could
be arranged at suitable hours for metropolitan practi-
tioners. This would stimulate interest and encourage
men to practise what had been demonstrated to them.
The establishment of a higher degree in obstetrics should
be considered by the combined universities. Its attain-
ment might be made an essential qualification for hold-
ing senior staff appointments in obstetric hospitals. Such
a nucleus of well trained men would gradually exercise a
powerful influence throughout Australia.
As the result of many conversations with practitioners
it is considered that the time is ripe for the recognition
of obstetrics as a subject of more than equal importance
than any other branch of clinical medicine to the general
practitioner. Instruction of students is only one side of
the work. The head of the department must be in touch
with the practising members of the profession, stimulating
interest and making them realize that obstetrics is a
subject well worth life-long devotion.
The Training, Registration and Practice of the
Obstetric Nurse.
The Midwives Board is concerned with the training and
practice of all obstetric nurses in the State. It is com-
posed of public service doctors and has in association a
board of examiners who are all in private practice. The
Director was appointed a liaison member of the board in
order to keep them well informed of the views of the
examiners and of the obstetrical members of the pro-
fession generally. For some time the board has recog-
nized the necessity for the appointment of an inspectress
of midwives. Owing to the limited funds at its disposal
this has hitherto not been attainable. In 1927 the appoint-
ment was made and the results to date have fully
warranted this action. The inspectress has devoted her
first year to a thorough inspection of all training schools,
to the investigation of complaints against nurses and
hospitals and as far as possible to the inspection of
visiting nurses. As the result of her tactful methods the
regulations have been complied with, particularly by the
untrained type of nurse, more generally than in the past.
There is, however, too much for one person to do and
it is recommended that one inspectress be attached to
each district health officer, with at least two in the metro-
politan area. The salary and travelling expenses of the
inspectress have been paid from the funds of the board
obtained from registration and examination fees of nurses
and are not a charge on the Treasury. Further extension
will entail such expenditure.
Training Schools.
Victoria is the only State in which private hospitals
have been registered as training schools. In 1925 there
were thirty-four hospitals on the list, twenty-eight in Mel-
bourne, four in the country and two in New South Wales.
Since then six have ceased to train and it is proposed
to limit the numbers further to fourteen in Melbourne
and four in the country. Additions will be made when
base hospitals in the country establish maternity wards.
Requirements of a Training School.
Training schools should comply with the following
requirements:
(i) The nurse in charge should possess both general
and obstetric certificates. One at least of the staff must
in addition possess a certificate of mothercraft training.
Two double certificate nurses must be actively engaged in
the instruction of the trainees.
(ii) The minimum number of women delivered in the
hospital should be one hundred per annum and each trainee
must actually deliver twenty women during her course.
(iii) If the training school be a mixed hospital, the
obstetrical unit should be completely separated from the
other departments.
(iv) Ante-natal work and mothercraft training must
form an essential part of the course. A proportion of the
women must also be attended in the externe department
of the hospital.
The main defects of the majority of the private training
schools are as follows:
(i) Many of the hospitals have too low an average of
occupied beds and cases per annum.
(ii) The number of women actually delivered is too few
in many schools. Ante-natal experience is non-existent
and a knowledge of mothercraft seldom imparted to the
trainees.
(iii) It is obvious to the board of examiners that
thorough instruction of trainees is often wanting and
that no attempt is made to insure a reasonable standard
before a nurse sits for examination.
Metropolitan Training Schools.
At the Women’s Hospital two classes of trainees are
accepted; a six months’ post-graduate course is given to
nurses with a general certificate and a twelve months’
course to others. The value of the course would be in-
creased by the development of an externe department.


The provision of tutor sisters would insure that the
trainees were supervised throughout their course in a
manner which is impossible under present conditions.
The Queen Victoria Hospital admits only six month
trainees. In addition to the hospital practice, they attend
externe patients with the district nurses.
St. George’s and Bethesda Intermediate Hospitals are
the next most important training schools and possess
excellent records. The lack of ante-natal instruction and
externe practice, however, constitutes an omission from
the ideal.
The remaining private hospitals vary considerably. In
only the minority does the nurse receive a fairly adequate
training.
Country Training Schools.
The public hospitals at Ballarat and Hamilton provide
a course well above average standard. The other centres
at Colac and Castlemaine suffer from many of the defects
already noted, although this is minimized by the personal
interest taken in the trainees by the local practitioners.
Whenever maternity wards are established at more of the
larger hospitals, they should prove of equal value to the
present centre at Ballarat.
Number of Nurses on Register of Midwives.
When the Midwives Act became law in 1915 all women
practising obstetrics were required to register. Three
classes were formed:
(i) Those nurses holding a certificate from the Women’s
Hospital or such other equivalent from other States as
approved by the board. Registration under this section
was permitted until the end of 1916.
(ii) All women who could produce evidence of having
been in bona fide practice for two years prior to the Act.
No further registrations under this clause were permitted
after 1917. This class was termed “practice midwives.”
(iii) After 1916 it was compulsory for all applicants to
pass an examination after the prescribed course, six months
for a nurse with previous general training, twelve months
for other trainees.
From the time the Act came into force until December,
1927, 4,122 midwives have been registered and 1,222 de-
registered, mainly on account of death, old age, marriage
and cessation from nursing. At present there are 2,900
midwives registered; 42% are practice nurses and the
remainder trained. Some are in other States and many
are not actively engaged in obstetric work. No exact
estimate can be given of the proportion in practice.
Obstetric Nurses in Private Practice.
As elsewhere the greatest difficulty is experienced in
attracting the right type of nurse to undertake obstetric
work. Many are repelled by the conditions of the average
training centre and later by the inferior status of the
work, due to the influence of partly trained and untrained
women who are prepared to do domestic work in addition.
To encourage the genuine nurse an endeavour must be
made to make the best training available for her. At pre-
sent the main training centres are largely staffed with
nurses who have no intention of undertaking obstetric
work after registration. The following is suggested as a
means of overcoming this difficulty.
A short course of three months should be part of the
training of every general nurse, so that she can deal with
possible emergencies in the future. It would not entitle
her to practise as an obstetric nurse. For those desirous
of doing such work a further post-graduate course of
nine months would be essential. In order to afford the
best instruction all such trainees should be concentrated
at the Women’s and Queen Victoria Hospitals. Any
vacancies at these hospitals as well as at other training
schools would be available for those taking the short
course. The excellent scheme of the Bush Nursing Asso-
ciation, whereby nurses are paid a bonus after obstetric
training and sign a contract to serve for two years, is
worthy of State consideration in this connexion.
The problem of the visiting or morning nurse is of
considerable importance, especially in industrial suburbs.
Apart from the district nurses the majority engaged in
the work are practice nurses. Despite the regulations
many do not visit their patients twice daily. There is,
therefore, no record of the evening temperature and
consequently incipient cases of sepsis may be missed. The
majority work alone and send for medical aid only in
emergency. In some suburbs such aid is obtained from
practitioners of doubtful obstetric repute. The number of
women attended daily should be more limited and the
keeping of accurate records insisted upon, otherwise a
potential source of infection will remain untouched.
The interest of the State at present ceases with the
registration of the nurse, provided that she does not
infringe the regulations. No attempt is made to keep her
abreast of modern developments. Post-graduate refresher
courses should be given at the main training centres
throughout the State. All nurses on the active list should
be compelled to attend a course of one full week every
three years. Special courses could be employed for dis-
ciplinary purposes for any careless or ignorant women in
lieu of suspension or even removal from the register.
The nurse should receive compensation for a locum tenens
during her absence unless undergoing a disciplinary
course. Revision of theoretical and practical work with
information regarding the latest developments would form
the basis of the work. In addition any alterations in
the regulations could be explained and this would remove
much misunderstanding and hostility.
It* is also reasonable to expect that after passing an
act to insure the provision of registered midwives, the
State should see that it is strictly enforced. Legal evasions
are all too common. An amendment is required of the
clause forbidding an unregistered woman to attend a
patient “for gain.” This would be better expressed
“whether for gain or not.” In addition the emergency
clause allows of wide evasion of the regulations. It should
be insisted upon that in all such cases the unregistered
woman must immediately send for a medical practitioner
or a registered midwife to carry on with the case. The
Act is being further defeated by unregistered women
making no charge for obstetric attention, but receiving
money for acting as domestic helps. Unfortunately, these
evasions of the Act have occurred with the apparent
connivance and approval of certain practitioners. The
practice savours of “covering an unregistered person”
which in Great Britain would render the doctor liable
to severe professional penalties. The remedy rests largely
in the hands of the medical profession. Registered nurses
are discouraged from starting in such areas or, as
happened recently, may even have to cease work because
of this unfair competition.
Nursing, especially obstetric nursing, is an arduous
profession and the monetary rewards are not commen-
surate with the hard life. It is impossible for the average
nurse to earn enough so that after her comparatively brief
professional career she can look forward to comfort in
later years. For this reason it is highly satisfactory to
note that under the stimulus of the Charities Board a
scheme of pensions for nurses is now being evolved.
The Present Status of Obstetric Practice in
Victoria.
Personal interviews with a large proportion of those
actively engaged in obstetrical work have formed the most
important section of this investigation. In all 633 prac-
titioners were interviewed, 304 in Melbourne and 329
throughout the State. Information obtained from this
source forms the basis of the following comments.
I desire to take this opportunity of thanking my
colleagues throughout the State for the invariable courtesy
shown to me personally and the very evident desire to
assist the investigations.
Ante-natal Supervision.
The aim of modern obstetrical practice is the mainten-
ance of normal health during pregnancy with the elimina-
tion of any complications, so that healthy infants will
be born with the least amount of damage to the mothers.
For too long has it been the custom of the public to

consider that the performance of child-birth demands no
special preparations. Therefore it is not surprising that
only 50% of the doctors seen in Melbourne and not more
than 35% in the country were satisfied with the amount
of ante-natal care they gave their patients.
The Federal Royal Commission on Health urged that
the maternity bonus should be paid only after submission
of a certificate of adequate ante-natal supervision.
Political expediency has ignored this wise decision. Despite
the provision of large ante-natal clinics at the public
maternity hospitals as well as a certain amount of instruc-
tion at baby health centres, doctors practising in industrial
areas find it very difficult to get many women to attend.
Primiparce are realizing the advantages of such care, but
multiparce, especially if previous confinements have been
normal, are largely indifferent. The added risks which
such mothers run have been referred to in Table IV and
emphasize the need for supervision of all pregnant women.
With such attention at least 90% of women can approach
confinement with confidence. In the remaining group
many abnormalities can be remedied or an appropriate
line of treatment determined before labour commences.
In both instances there will be a lessened risk of sepsis.
In many industrial suburbs practitioners do not or cannot
persuade their patients to attend during pregnancy and
depend upon the nurse who is often untrained, to inform
them if progress be not made. It is then too late to
rectify mistakes and this procedure ends in difficult
deliveries with a high infant death rate and much mor-
tality and morbidity among the mothers. The public and
some of the profession have yet to learn that operative
dexterity during delivery cannot compensate for lack of
care during pregnancy. In the country, where for various
reasons ante-natal supervision is more difficult, the doctor
generally insists on seeing patients whenever they come
to hospital and even at this stage much preventive work
can be accomplished. The bush nursing records as well
as those of many country practitioners amply bear this
out.
There is need for the establishment throughout the
State of ante-natal clinics. Apart from attaching them to
all public hospitals with maternity accommodation, the
ideal situation is at the numerous infant welfare centres.
They should be staffed with nurses trained to take his-
tories, able to perform palpation and to test urines. No
further treatment should be allowed. All patients with
abnormal conditions should be referred to their doctors
or in suitable circumstances to public hospitals. Such
clinics would relieve the busy practitioner of the necessity
of instruction in general hygienic principles and details of
infant welfare besides assuring him that it had been
properly done. It would be advisable to alter the booklet
issued by the Maternity Allowance Department and sub-
stitute shorter leaflets on different subjects. These could
be given at intervals to mothers by the clinic nurses and
would probably be read and acted upon in a more satis-
factory fashion than is the present pamphlet.
The Complications of Pregnancy.
Eclampsia.
The advantage of ante-natal care of all pregnant women
is best illustrated by the effects of treatment in cases of
albuminuria and eclampsia. Although the incidence of
eclampsia is not more than two per thousand deliveries
in the records of private practice in Melbourne, there are
many emergency cases, especially in industrial suburbs.
As Dr. Green shows in Part 111 of this report, these were
responsible for 35% of the maternal deaths in the Women’s
Hospital. The increased liability shown by such patients
to septic infection following any operative procedure adds
to the importance of this complication of pregnancy. It
is an even greater cause of maternal mortality in the rural
parts of the State, except in centres where careful ante-
natal supervision is possible.
Ante Par turn Hemorrhage.
Ante partum hsemorrhage is likewise more serious in
the country than in Melbourne. The frequent association
of one type of haemorrhage with pre-existing renal disease
emphasizes the importance of ante-natal care. It has not
been sufficiently recognized that hospital treatment is
essential for all such patients. In some instances the
results indicate the need for more conservative methods
of treatment.
Contracted Pelvis.
Although mild degrees of contraction are fairly common
in Melbourne, contracted pelvis is a rare disability in
the rest of the State. It is difficult to obtain exact details
of pelvic measurements and in too many cases sufficient
time is not allowed for the natural forces to attempt
delivery. This complication emphasizes the need for
efficient instruction of students. Too many men are prone
to ascribe delay in labour to contracted pelvis when some
other easily recognized and preventible condition is the
real cause of obstruction. There is a temptation to perform
Caesarean section regardless of the consequences noted
in the next paragraph.
Cwsarean Section.
The abuse of Caesarean section has assumed serious
proportions all over the world. On the whole, the incidence
in the State has decreased considerably, but far too many
are still being performed. The operation has been done
without any regard for other methods of delivery, without
a preliminary trial of labour and without consultation
with a reputable obstetrician. Owing to defective know-
ledge many men find it easier to say that a woman cannot
be delivered in any other way than to try if it be possible.
Comments. —Trial labour was carried out only thirty-
three times. There was a history of previous difficult
labours in sixteen instances. Repeat Caesarean section
was performed nine times. A central insertion of the
placenta was encountered in thirty-one women, with five
deaths. A marginal insertion occurred twenty-five times.
In the majority the eclampsia was mild and no attempts
at effective eliminative treatment were made before opera-
tion. Many patients with severe toxaemia were treated,
especially in country districts. There were eight fibro-
myomata and four ovarian tumours. The concealed type
of accidental haemorrhage took place four times, with two
deaths. External haemorrhage occurred twice. The mis-
cellaneous group includes rigid cervix, dystocia follow-

ing previous abdominal and vaginal operations, locked

diabetes and cardiac disease.
A maternal mortality from all causes of nearly 13% does
not reflect credit on the operators either as regards diag-
nostic skill or surgical technique. These results have
been improved upon in many cases by more conservative
methods of delivery.
Labour.
The proportion of patients treated in hospital varies
from 20% to 90%, depending mainly on the locality and
the standards of the hospitals. The preparations for
labour as regards sterile dressings and so forth leave
much to be desired. It would be of considerable help
if the Health Department formulated minimum standards
not only for the preparation of patients, but also for the
delivery room and its accessories. For the instruction
of mothers model maternity outfits could be exhibited at
ante-natal clinics when the sisters would give detailed
advice. Arrangements could be made to sterilize these
kits at the local general hospitals and, as has been shown
in New Zealand, the cost of outfit and sterilization need
not be excessive. By this means the public would realize
the importance of preparing for labour as for any surgical
operation.
The main difference between city and rural practice is
seen in the actual conduct of labour. Undoubtedly the
mental attitude of the public to the subject of labour,
particularly in regard to their demands on the profession,
has altered in recent years. Want of confidence in their
own powers and a knowledge that relief is possible by
artificial means all tend to prevent child-birth being a
normal function. These facts operate more in Melbourne
than in the country and the percentage of artificially
ended labours is much higher in the metropolis than in
the rest of the State and so also are the deaths from
sepsis. The practice of obstetrics is arduous and under-
paid and often causes much interruption to the routine
of a busy general practitioner. He is tempted to terminate
a case as soon as possible with forceps and generally
such interference is welcomed by the importunate relatives
demanding immediate relief. The vicious circle is com-
pleted and the conscientious doctor often suffers defeat
in the unequal struggle between his obstetrical ideals
and the conditions of actual practice. Allowing for this
strong pressure of patients and their relatives to terminate
labour quickly, the profession is not absolved from blame.
In far too many instances no correct diagnosis of the
presentation is made, the rules for the application of
forceps are ruthlessly broken and if at first unsuccessful
strength is substituted for an investigation of the cause
of obstruction. The records of the Women’s Hospital
amply illustrate the tragedy of the “failed forceps” in the
causation of maternal and infantile mortality. Those who
are proud of their manual dexterity, do not realize the
influence they exercise over the younger men who are
tempted to cast aside their ideals because the senior breaks
all the rules with apparent immunity. Much of this
criticism applies to the industrial suburbs and some of
the residential areas of Melbourne. The work is mainly
done in the smaller type of hospital or with poor grades
of nurses, when the results are not open to professional
inspection and criticism. The influence of the larger hos-
pitals in preventing unnecessary interference and bad
work is a strong argument for the establishment of larger
units to replace these small alleged hospitals.
Adequate ante-natal supervision associated with a good
hospital or a well trained nurse plus the judicious use of
sedatives will decrease the incidence of artificial delivery.
This is proved in the records of St. George’s and Bethesda
Hospitals in Melbourne, by the work of the Bush Nursing
Association and in the records of many practitioners
throughout the State.
No definite figure can be laid down as to what con-
stitutes a fair percentage of forceps deliveries. The con-
ditions of hospital and private practice are not comparable.
In New Zealand, where records must be kept for hospitals,
the average rate for 1926 was 13-7%. No such estimate
can be given for Victoria. In private practice under
present conditions any rate under 30% must be regarded
as not unreasonable. The incidence varies directly with
the size of the locality. It is low in the smaller country
centres, increases rapidly in the larger towns and reaches
its zenith in Melbourne.
Table XXI. —Incidence of Forceps Applications according to Size of
Town.
If this be expressed as a percentage of the total number
of doctors interviewed it will be seen that the proportion
under 30% for Melbourne is approximately only half that
of the rest of the State.
Table XXII. —Incidence of Forceps Application expressed as
Percentage of Doctors Interviewed.
In Melbourne this increased proportion is noted more
in the industrial than the residential suburbs.
Table XXIII. —Incidence of Forceps Application, Melbourne.
Those who use forceps as a routine, defend their attitude
mainly on three grounds: (a) That the perineum is pre-
served and not damaged, (b) that no increased morbidity
results and (c) that the foetal death rate is unaffected.
Others are not so sanguine and admit that any inter-
ference, including low forceps, must carry an added risk.
This is confirmed by the records of the two intermediate
hospitals in Melbourne as well as by the autopsy results
previously quoted.
Excessive artificial delivery is therefore a most
important factor in the problem of maternal morbidity,
especially in the metropolitan area.
Pituitary extract is not employed as much as formerly
and 60% of the doctors interviewed reserved its use
for complications during and after the third stage of
labour.
The conduct of the third stage of labour is a valuable
criterion of the obstetric standards of any practitioner.
On the whole it is fairly well managed by most men,
although those who favour rapid delivery, are not inclined
to adopt different measures during this important stage.

TABLE XXIV. — COMPARISON NORMAL AND FORCEPS CASES REGARDING
PERINEAL LACERATION AND MORBIDITY.
Puerperal Sepsis.
Approximately one woman in five hundred dies from
puerperal sepsis. It has already been shown to be the
most important cause of death following child-birth and
also that the rate is increasing, especially in Melbourne.
Exception has been taken to the inclusion of septic
abortions in estimating the rate, but, even if they be
excluded, this progressive increase is still noted.
The utter failure of notification of puerperal fever
in Victoria, either as an index of its prevalence or as
a means of insuring early treatment, is illustrated by
the returns of the last five years; 205 cases were notified
and 266 deaths were registered. This result is due to
several factors. * In the first place there is no accurate
definition of the term. Any febrile condition in a puerperal
woman associated with inflammatory conditions of the
pelvic organs should be considered to be due to sepsis,
whether there be other foci in the body or not. Pyrexia
during the puerperium is not insignificant and it is often
forgotten that a mild degree of infection, if transmitted to
other women, is liable to cause a virulent outbreak.
This was illustrated in recent outbreaks in Melbourne.
Although the midwives’ regulations require the notification
of all elevated temperatures, it was not until the inspectress
began duty, that this regulation was carried out to any
extent. It is recommended that this regulation be amended
to include abortions as well as full term labours and also
that all such temperatures be reported both in hospital
and private practice. It must be clearly understood that
this is not the same thing as notifying puerperal sepsis.
Probably 50% of the pyrexia would be extra-genital in
origin and the true cases of sepsis will still require further
notification. But it would insure that all cases were
investigated at the earliest moment with a consequent
saving of many extra lives.
To overcome another difficulty, such notification should
be made direct to the Health Department in Melbourne
or to the district health officer in the country and not
to the local authorities. With the latter procedure discus-
sions have been known to occur at council meetings and
be reported in the press. Such publicity and often erroneous
criticism invariably reacts against the doctor and only
results in non-notification. The public must adopt a more
reasonable attitude, for in the present state of our know-
ledge the medical attendant is not necessarily always to
blanxe.
Notification Is useless unless the authorities are prepared
to assist the - doctor to arrive at a correct diagnosis.
In the country districts bacteriological examination of
blood and secretions can be carried out at the Federal
laboratories or at those attached to base hospitals. In
Melbourne this could be best accomplished by the pro-
vision of adequate laboratory facilities at the Women’s
and Queen Victoria Hospitals. Consultants could be
appointed at various centres and would be available fox-
advice at a fixed fee paid by the State for those unable
to afford full private rates; in most cases such expenditure
could be recoverable from the patient. Since septic patients
should be nursed in hospital and not at home, suitable
isolation accommodation must be rendered available at
the main centres.
The district health officer should personally interview
the doctor in every case of sepsis, but inspection of the
hospital or nurse could be left to the inspectress.
The present regulations regarding disinfection of the
room and isolation of the nurse until certified fit to resume
duty are sufficient. There is, however, no clause which
forbids the admission of new patients while a patient with
sepsis is still under treatment in hospital. There is no
necessity to close a hospital completely unless the outbreak
of sepsis is serious.
From personal investigation of a number of deaths it
was found that the majority was traceable to some
obstetric procedure or failure of aseptic technique during
labour on the part of the doctor. In a few cases the
nurse was to blame; one such case was due to an infected
antrum and others to septic fingers. The patient herself
was responsible only in a few instances.
Both the public and the profession must realize that
the solution of the problem involves three main factors:
(i) More thorough ante-natal supervision and elimination
of septic foci; (ii) more intensive instruction of students
so that they will be able to recognize abnormalities in
time and determine the correct treatment and (iii) more
time spent over delivery in proper surroundings with
good nurses. Of these requirements a sound knowledge
of the fundamentals of obstetrics is of more importance
even than improved hospital accommodation.
The Maternity Allowance.
Whether or not the object of the Maternity Allowance
Act was to lessen maternal and infant mortality, it is
certain that it has failed to achieve this result. Stress
has been laid in this report on the importance of maternal
care during the pre-natal period, the need for improved
professional knowledge and better hospital facilities. The
use of even a portion of the large sums spent annually
on the baby bonus would materially assist these objectives.
The recommendation of the Royal Commission on Health,
namely, that proof of adequate ante-natal supervision
should be furnished before payment of the allowance, has
been completely ignored. Maternity benefits form part
of the proposed scheme of national insurance and will
be paid in addition to the present allowance. This will
afford the Government another opportunity of insisting on
proper medical and nursing attention in a suitable environ-
ment. There are many problems requiring further re-
search which cannot be undertaken until funds are avail-
able. Therefore it is time that both the politician and
the general public realized that continuance of the present
scheme does not lead towards any material benefit to the
nation.
Summary.
In Victoria during the past five years 869 mothers have
died during child-birth and approximately 11,000 still-births
and deaths of infants under one month have also occurred.
The maternal mortality is not decreasing and the rate for
1927 is the highest for the past twenty-two years. The
still-birth rate remains constant and the infant mortality
under one month shows no signs of diminution. All
these losses are excessive in Melbourne as compared with
the rest of the State.
Puerperal sepsis is the most important factor in this
mortality and is largely caused by much unnecessary inter-
ference with normal delivery.
Owing to their indifference to the value of ante-natal
supervision and a proper environment for labour, as well
as by their insistence on rapid delivery regardless of the
consequences, the public must bear a share of the
responsibility.
The few members of the medical profession who are
inefficient, are mainly responsible. But the figures quoted
in this report make it evident that an improvement in
results can be achieved only when the whole body of the
profession apply in their obstetric practice the lessons to be
learnt from the present state of affairs. A contributory
cause is afforded by the inadequate preliminary training
of medical students.
Finally, this investigation is a sign to the public that
the medical profession is concerned with the situation and


is anxious for improvement. Therefore it expects support
from an aroused public conscience in the initiation of
future reforms.
The reason for dwelling upon the tragedy of an
unnecessarily high maternal mortality rate is not
for the sake of criticism or censure, but because,
until it is realized that much of the poignant sorrow
and suffering caused by misadventure at the time
of child-birth is not inevitable and can be lessened,
we shall be slow to find the time, money, effort and
good will needed to persuade all concerned to combine
and overcome the practical difficulties of this problem.

Recommendations.
1. The establishment of a Chair of Obstetrics at the
University of Melbourne. More prolonged and intensive
training of the student.
2. The formation of ante-natal clinics at every centre
where facilities exist.
3. The erection of modern maternity units, especially in
the metropolitan area, to replace the present system of
nursing homes.
4. Encouragement of trained nurses to undertake
obstetric service. Necessary factors in this are the elimin-
ation of partially trained and untrained women and the
institution of refresher courses and pensions.
5. Minimum standards governing the preparations for
delivery to be published and enforced both in hospital
and private practice.
6. Compulsory notification of all cases of puerperal
pyrexia.
7. Provision of ample facilities for laboratory diagnosis,
advice by consultants and hospital accommodation.
8. Death certificates to show the association of pregnancy
or child-birth with the cause of death; investigation of all
maternal deaths; notification of still-births; legal power
for the Statistician to obtain additional information from
medical practitioners concerning doubtful certificates.
9. That immediate steps be taken to give effect to the
recommendations of the Federal Royal Commission on
Health (1926) regarding maternity hygiene.
Part 111.
Clinical and Laboratory Investigations.
The clinical and laboratory investigations have been
directed along two main lines: (i) A study of the prob-
lems associated with the bacteriology and treatment of
puerperal sepsis. This was undertaken by Dr. E. R.
White at the Women’s Hospital in association first with
Miss F. B. Williams who had to resign owing to ill-health,
and later with Dr. Lucy Bryce at the Walter and Eliza Hall
Research Institute. Since 1927 the staff of the Queen
Victoria Hospital have rendered valuable assistance by
supplying additional clinical material.
The value of “Mercurochrome” in the treatment of
puerperal sepsis was thoroughly investigated by Dr. E. R.
White. Unfortunately it did not fulfil the expectations
aroused by some initial successes.
Dr. Lucy Bryce in addition to the examination of cultures
from febrile puerperal patients, has made a detailed study
of the bacteria found in the genital passages during preg-
nancy in order to note whether the standards accepted
in other countries are applicable to local conditions. Valu-
able work was also performed by her in the bacteriological
investigation of several outbreaks of sepsis in private
hospitals.
(ii) A study of the toxaemias of pregnancy was under-
taken. An attempt was made to correlate the results of
bio-chemical examination of blood and urine with clinical
observations. This was carried out by Dr. John S. Green
and Miss Vera Kreiger, M.Sc., in collaboration with
Associate Professor J. W. Young, of the Bio-chemical
Department of the University of Melbourne. They have
shown that such tests possess a practical value in the
estimation of permanent damage to the liver and kidneys,
in the control of treatment and in prognosis. The extent
of the work which has been accomplished is proof of the
industry and enthusiasm shown by all concerned. It
is therefore pleasing to note that the Committee of the
Women’s Hospital have appointed Miss Krieger to the staff
of the hospital, thus insuring continuance of the present
work.
Brief summaries of the conclusions arrived at in both
investigations are contained in this section of the report.
The complete work will be published in The Medical
Journal oe Australia at an early date.
It must be recorded that the investigations have been
conducted under great disabilities owing to the absence of
sufficient laboratory accommodation at the Women’s Hos-
pital. Considerable delay and extra work was incurred
in transporting specimens to two laboratories in different
parts of the city. The lack of foreign literature for neces-
sary references has also been a serious drawback.
Research has not played a prominent part in obstetrical
work in Australia, mainly owing to lack of funds and
opportunities. Much good material is being wasted at
present and will continue to be wasted until provision is
made for adequate laboratory facilities at the main clinical
centres.
I desire to express my appreciation of the efforts of
those coworkers in this research to whom reference has
already been made and to the manner in which the com-
mittees and honorary medical staffs of the Women’s and
Queen Victoria Hospitals have granted every request for
assistance. For much helpful criticism and advice I wish
especially to thank Dr. C. H. Kellaway, Director of the
Walter and Eliza Hall Research Institute.
Summary of Bacteriological Investigations in
Connection with Puerperal Infection.
By Lucy M. Bryce, M. 8., 8.5., B.Sc.,
(Walter and Eliza Hall Research Institute,
Melbourne).
These investigations are grouped under five headings.
1. A study of the organisms found in the vagina and
uterus in fifty cases of fever following abortion or child-
birth, in patients admitted to, or delivered in, the Women’s
Hospital. The bacteriological examinations of numbers
1 to 34 of this series were made by Miss F. E. Williams,
who unfortunately was subsequently compelled to relin-
quish the work through ill-health. The swabs were taken
by Dr. E. R. White. The findings from these patients
were compared with those from the cervix and uterus in
twenty-nine afebrile puerperal patients from the second
series.
2. An investigation of the bacterial content of the genital
passages during normal pregnancy, in order to compare
it with that of the puerperium and to correlate it with
the clinical course of the puerperium and thus assess
the importance of the preexisting vaginal flora in relation
to puerperal sepsis.
Researches on these lines have been carried out many
times in other countries, with varying, sometimes conflict-
ing results, but so far none has been published in Aus-
tralia. It was felt that differences due to local hygienic
conditions or variations in immunity might be revealed by
such an investigation here.
One hundred and nineteen patients were examined.
Eighty-six were attending the ante-natal clinic at the
Women’s Hospital and from these the swabs were taken
by Dr. E. R. White. Later, thirty-three patients at the
Queen Victoria Hospital were examined by the author in
cooperation with the Medical Superintendent, Dr. Isabel
Ireland, and her successor, Dr. Margaret Ashton. The
subsequent history of one hundred and three of these
patients was available and has been considered in relation
to the bacteriological findings.


Thirty patients (fourteen at the Women’s and sixteen at
the Queen Victoria Hospital) from whom swabs had been
taken before delivery, were further examined during
labour and the puerperium. The organisms found at
these different times were noted and, as mentioned above,
comparison made between the findings in febrile and
afebrile cases.
As the examination of patients in this way is a slow
process, the numbers in these two series are small and so
do not permit many definite conclusions to be drawn.
The first series indicates, however, that a variety of
organisms, of which streptococci are the most important,
may be concerned in the production of puerperal fever
and that therefore the cooperation of the bacteriologist
with the clinician is essential, especially if specific treat-
ment is contemplated. The modern trend is to control
any form of treatment by estimation of changes occurring
in the patient’s blood which indicate increase or decrease
of bactericidal power and other forms of resistance to the
infection. The virulence of potentially pathogenic organ-
isms is being minutely studied in other countries by
bacteriological methods such as the Ruge-Phillip and
similar tests.
The second Investigation shows that examination of
the vaginal secretion during pregnancy may be of practical
value from the following aspects: (1) It gives an indication
of the personal hygiene of the patient and the influence of
this on puerperal morbidity may be studied; (ii)
potentially virulent organisms are occasionally found.
Further observations may be made on these and know-
ledge gained of their mode of entry, their subsequent
behaviour and the clinical course of the puerperium; (iii)
unsuspected diseases, such as chronic gonorrhoea, may be
occasionally detected and their consequences averted.
3. Dr. C. H. Mollison kindly presented a number of
cultures from blood and other sources obtained from
patients at the Women’s Hospital. These cultures gave
further opportunity to study the organisms met with in
puerperal sepsis.
Enumeration of the types of organisms found in these
series and discussion of the bacteriological problems
encountered will be published later.
4. Investigations, involving extensive bacteriological
work, were made into two outbreaks of puerperal sepsis
occurring in private hospitals. The detection of a carrier
in one of these is described in The Medical Journal of
Australia of March 31, 1928.
5. The production of soluble toxins, analogous to those
produced by scarlatinal strains, was demonstrated in the
case of streptococci isolated from patients with puerperal
sepsis. Filtrates were made with six strains and it was
found possible to obtain intradermal reactions similar to
those obtained in the Dick test in a certain proportion of
all individuals tested, including pregnant and puerperal
women. Dr. Helen Kelsey kindly made filtrates of two
of these strains and tested them on patients at the
Infectious Diseases Hospital. They gave reactions of
similar type to those which she had previously obtained
with her scarlatinal strains. Evidence is accumulating
which demonstrates the high curative value of anti-
scarlatinal serum containing an antitoxic element. It is
possible that a similar method of treatment might be of
value in a streptococcal puerperal infection.
Difficulties Encountered in These Investigations.
There is splendid clinical material at the Women’s and
Queen Victoria Hospitals, but unfortunately both at present
lack laboratory equipment. All bacteriological work has
therefore been done at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute.
Although excellent facilities were thus made available, this
procedure caused much waste of time and made close cor-
relation of clinical and laboratory observations very
difficult.
Owing to the dearth of German and Austrian journals
available in Melbourne, it has been impossible to refer to
much of the previous work on the vaginal flora which
has been done in these countries. The publications most
frequently required were Archiv fiir Gynakologie, Monats-
scrift fiir Geburtshiilfe und Gynakologie, Wiener Medi-
zinische W ochenschrift and the Zentralblatt fiir
Gynakologie.

Observations on the Chemistry of Blood and Urine in
the Toxaemias of Pregnancy.
By John S. Green, M.D. (Melbourne), D.G.O. (Dublin),
Honorary Obstetric Surgeon, Women's Hospital;
and
Vera I. Krieger, M.Sc.,

For a period of nineteen months the chemistry of blood
and urine in the toxaemias of pregnancy has been investi-
gated. The importance of this subject is illustrated by
the statistics of the Women’s Hospital. Of all the deaths
(214) occurring in the obstetric department of the Hos-
pital for the period 1920-1925, 74 or 35% were caused by
the toxaemias of pregnancy.
This investigation involved the performance of 3,290
tests, 2,000 of which were quantitative estimations.
The results have been presented and discussed under
various headings: tabulation of findings, discussion of
individual tests, clinical types and their findings, value of
individual tests, clinical application to treatment and
prognosis.
The following conclusions have emerged from the work:
1. Chemical investigation of the toxaemias of pregnancy
has a very definite interest for the obstetrician.
2. From the aetiological point of view every case
independently of grouping has potentially three factors:
(i) purely toxic (? hepatic), (ii) renal, (iii) preexisting
nephritis.
3. The most satisfactory grouping of cases is a clinical
one. An elaboration of types is unnecessary and confusing.
A fairly complete chemical picture has been worked out
for each type.
4. Individual cases should be viewed broadly according
to the grouping, using the chemical findings as a fine
adjustment. This applies practically as well as
academically.
5. For practical purposes renal impairment is more
significant than hepatic. The most valuable tests are the
urea concentration, the blood urea, the Fouchet test.
6. In the treatment of a “new case” chemical findings
may be overweighed) by clinical judgement, but not lightly
if the chemical findings are unsatisfactory. When the
past history of a patient is bad, great deference must be
paid to the chemical findings.
7. From the point of view of the subsequent history
and possible pregnancy, defective responses to renal tests
are very sinister. This is a consideration in immediate
treatment.
