INFORMATION.
I‘OI‘UIjAR S'i’EliAMS AND WCHSIIO RESORTS QUEANBEYAN
AND DISTR ICT.
Queanbeyan and the, IPederal Capital Territory ppasess many
spots of’ charming- beauty that make a very strong- appeal to the
lover of: the outdoors, particularly the keen Angler. A brief de-
scription of’ the beautiful rivers within easy reach of Queanbeyan
is here given, together with a word regarding' camping facilities,
etc. The moat important rivers arc Murrumbidgee, Molonglo,
Queanbeyan, Cotter, G-oodradig-boe.
The nearest point of the Murrumbidgee River is reached within
twelve miles of Queanbeyan, at a point known as Point Hut Cross-
ing. The road to the crossing is one of the best in the district.
The banks of the Murrumbidgee at this point are very level and a
moat comfortable camp can be made.
Generally speaking-, good fishing grounds are to be found at
almost any point that cair be reached on the Murrumbidgee.
Queanbeyan River junctions with the Molonglo at a point about
1 mile below Queanbeyan. Prom the junction to the first falls
about 3 miles above Queanbeyan, Trout, Perch and Cod are to be
caught. After passing the first falls, Trout predominate, and large
fish are the rule rather than the exception. In the upper reaches
of the river, particularly In the Norongo district, splendid fishing
is available. The country is rough and is suitable for anglers,
but is not recommended for parties including' women and children.
