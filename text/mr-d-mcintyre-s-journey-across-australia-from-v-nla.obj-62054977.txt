gold used in Japan is imported from the Korea through the Prince of Tsu-
sima. He has considerable influence over the King of Korea, and could no
doubt obtain his permission to receive an embassy. It would be necessary,
however, to have a hold on the Prince of Tsu-sima, in order to induce him to
use his influence. At present it would be impossible to open the country
otherwise without a collision with the natives, who are strongly opposed to any
intercourse with foreigners.
Mr. Dallas said he could confirm all that had been said respecting the
ignorance which prevailed generally as to the country of Korea, and this
ignorance was shared by the Chinese as much as by the English, there being
little or no intercourse between the two countries beyond that of the annual
tribute-bearers to Pekin. Nor did he see how, unless we embroiled ourselves
with the natives, we were to open the country. The French Roman Catholic
missionaries had for a length of time been established in the country, and,
though subject to persecution and massacre, he believed that they still had
agents there. They were well acquainted with the country, and through
them much information might be obtained. He believed that with the experi-
ence of our intercourse,with China and Japan, Her Majesty?s ministers would
not readily undertake new enterprises in Korea. In time, no doubt, circum-
stances would arise to bring about the object in view, but in the mean time he
looked rather to missionary enterprise than to any direct action on the part of
the British Government.
The President said he was sure Captain Allen Young did not contemplate
any violent proceedings.
Captain Allen Young said his opinion was that the means to be taken to
open relations with the Korean Government must be left to our Government.
He had no idea of any buccaneering expedition; his wish was that Government
should send an embassy to the capital, not on a large scale ; and on arriving at
Basil Bay, if it were made known to the king, either through the Prince of
Tsu-sima or by sending up to the capital, he believed that permission would
come down for the embassy to proceed.

1. Mr. D. Mclntyre's Journey across Australia , from Victoria to the
Gulf of Carpentaria , and discovery of supposed traces of Leichhardt.
(Communicated by Dr. F. Mueller of Melbourne.)
Dr. F. Mueller has forwarded to us various documents relating to the
journey of Mr. Duncan Mclntyre across Australia, the result of which has
been the revival of projects for the search of Leichhardt and his party, in
which Dr. Mueller is taking a very active part. The movement set on foot
by Dr. Mueller has been already mentioned in the President?s Anniversary
Address (? Proceedings,? vol. ix. p. 231).
A writer in the ? Riverine Herald,? who has had access to the journals of Mr.


Mclntyre, gives the following outline of his proceedings Mr. D. Mclntyre
and his brother left Victoria about two years since, with sheep, cattle, and
horses, and a splendid outfit, intending to proceed to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
On their arrival on the banks of the Darling, they found the river flooded, and
were unable to cross with their sheep. Mr. Duncan Mclntyre then proceeded
northwards with a small party, in the endeavour to find a good route to Cooper s
Creek. In his first journey thither he reached the waters, discovering several
new creeks and lakes on the road, and ascertained that no difficulty existed in
taking stock to that point. But on his return he learned, to his great disap-
pointment, that the Queensland Government had forbidden the entrance of
stock to their colony, either by land or sea, from any of the other Australian
colonies. Finding, therefore, that they could not proceed towards the north,
the party commenced explorations of the country lying between the Darling
and the boundary of Queensland, Excellent country was found to the west-
ward of the Paroo, but no permanent water; and so greatly was the party
inconvenienced by the want of water, that they were obliged to advance to the
Queensland Rivers before they could commence their return. On this journey
better country was found, some distance within the Queensland frontier, than
had been seen on the former trip. Fine rivers and lakes were discovered, and
an application was made to the Queensland Government for permission to pass
their boundary.
In the hope that this request would be eventually granted, Mr. Duncan
Mclntyre, accompanied by Mr. Barnett, and taking with him three natives and
25 horses, again proceeded towards the north, with the view of ascertaining
whether the Gulf country was superior to what he had already seen. r lhe
party started with only a small quantity of flour, rice, tea, and sugar, as pro-
visions, and did not take with them an ounce of meat. They had a good
supply of ammunition, expecting to find large numbers of ducks and eggs on
the route, as the season had been very favourable for this description of game
to the eastward. None of them, however, were met with, as there had been
no rain at all north of Cooper?s Creek; but the country was found to abound
with opossums, kangaroos, and emus. The last mentioned were in flocks of
hundreds in the neighbourhood of Cooper?s Creek. A good many bandicoots
were also met with, and were found to be excellent eating. Wild turkeys
were seen everywhere, but were especially numerous in the neighbourhood of
the Gulf. Pigeons, too, were found in thousands ; altogether the party fared
well on the game shot by them, and had no reason to regret not having
brought a supply of meat. Fish, also, were caught in large numbers in all
the creeks, the party frequently taking more than could be eaten. The tracks
of a large animal of the kangaroo tribe, called by the natives Wongaroo, were
frequently seen, and a few of the animals themselves ; but they did not come
within shooting-distance. They are much larger than the kangaroo, and it
was calculated they would sometimes weigh 4 or 5 cwts.; some of them
were jet black, others brown with dark spots; they are less swift than the
kangaroo, but jump perpendicularly from one rock to another, often to the
height of Bor i.O feet. They ascend a mountain at a rate at which neither
man nor dog can follow them. A variety of new birds were seen, and Mr.
Barnett collected a large number of seeds. Mr. Mclntyre speaks in high terms
of praise of his companion, who, although quite a young man, and previously
inexperienced in the bush, showed a surprising aptitude tor the work of explor-
ing. It is known from Wills? diary that Burke once killed a snake on his
journey across the continent, but no others were mentioned by him; and
Landsborough said he believed there were very few reptiles in the Gulf
country. Mr. Mclntyre, however, states that he killed from five to ten daily,
in the tropical portion of his journey, and sometimes two or three were found
together. Many of them were declared to be venomous by Mr. Barnett, who


made a large collection of skins. The natives of the party used the snakes
that were killed as food, and it was quite common to see them ride into camp
in the evening with a roll of some six or eight tied to their saddles.
The party left Dargonelly, River Paroo, on this expedition, on the 21st of
June, 1864, and reached Cooper?s Creek twenty-two days afterwards. They
crossed the creek about 50 miles below the junction of the Thompson. The
course then taken was in the direction of the new settlement in Northern
Australia, with a view of discovering how far a route for stock would be prac-
ticable in that direction. This course was continued until Burke?s track was
crossed, and so far no difficulty in conveying stock was met with. The
course was then changed for the head-waters of the Albert River. In crossing
the Northern Coast Range, described by Burke as giving such terrible work to
the camels that they groaned and bled, the horses? feet got so much worn down
by the rocks and stones, that it became necessary to follow a fall of water to
the north, and afterwards to the north-east, in order to get down to the low
country. The Flinders was struck on the 18th of August, a little south of
Donor?s Hills, and the river followed from that point to the sea; the journey from
Cooper?s Creek to the sea having occupied thirty-four days, being a little more
than half the time taken by either Burke or McKinlay. Mr. Mclntyre states
that he was within a mile of the coast, but having got in between two deep
salt mangrove creeks, he was hemmed in by a large number of blacks whom he
was obliged to charge at, in order to get out. He happily succeeded in scaring
them so much, that he had no occasion to fire on them ; but he was deprived
by the circumstance of getting sight of the ocean, which he could have done
only by showing fight, and shooting a number of them. He considered, how-
ever, that this gratification would have been too dearly bought with such a
sacrifice of human life. On several occasions during the journey across,
numbers of natives were met with, and once an exchange was made with them
for fish, some hawks shot by the party being given in exchange. Neither in
the coast-range, nor on the journey out and back, was a single native shot.
Once or twice an encounter seemed inevitable, but, by showing a firm front,
and seeming to disregard their presence, the necessity was avoided.
The country to the north-west of the point where Cooper?s Creek was crossed
was very indifferent for a day or two, and waterless. It gradually got better
on reaching a water-system in which four new rivers were found, the first of
which was named by Mr. Mclntyre the Docker. It then improved daily, and
splendid sheep-country was crossed in that part where the Stony Desert of
Sturt is laid down. The ground in places was, however, covered with frag-
ments of stones, and in some places ? paved,? as described by Sturt, for a few
miles. On the whole it was found to be a good grazing country, and Mr.
Mclntyre considers that it is particularly well adapted for sheep. A hundred
miles or so to the south of the tropic, the country assumes a high, undulating
character. The stones had for some distance previously entirely disappeared,
and the party now found themselves on beautiful smooth downs." The country
was magnificent the whole way from this to the coast-range. Bald hills were
met with at intervals, and at short distances five gum-lined creeks were
crossed, in some of which there was an abundance of excellent water; but,
owing to the dryness of the season, none of them were found running, as they
were by Burke. In crossing the coast-range, great difficulty was experienced
both on the south and north side in obtaining water, which was only to be met
with in the gorges in rocky basins. Nearly a week was occupied in getting
over this formidable barrier, and the horses suffered dreadfully from want 0?
feed, having sometimes to stand on perfectly bare rocks for the whole night.
In returning, the dividing range was crossed without much difficulty,"the
heights between the two falls of water, north and south, consisting only of high
undulating downs without any stones. No mountains or hills were visible to


the west, but some lofty peaks were seen at a great distance to the east. In
fact, from the Gulf to the banks of the Darling at Mount Murchison, a splendid
road could be made, along which a buggy might be driven without a single
impediment. A railway might be run across at a very light expense, there
being no engineering difficulties in the way, with the exception of crossing the
rivers. The route also is the most direct from Mount Murchison to the Gulf.
The Flinders is now peopled by squatters from its head to within 280 miles of
the sea. One station, however, is even 130 miles lower down. From what
could be learned of the squatters they had lost about 30 per cent, of their sheep
from the poison-bush, in coming over the ranges from Queensland. The sheep
generally looked healthy but poor, although there was plenty of grass. Great
losses had occurred also among the cattle from the poison-bush of the moun-
tains, and at least 50 per cent, had been lost from pleuro-pneumonia. A very
large percentage of horses had died from snake-bites. The average lambing on
the Flinders was not expected to be more than 15 per cent. From the descrip-
tion of the Flinders given by Mr. Landsborough, it would be inferred that it
was a finely-watered river. He states that, when he left it, it was 120 yards
wide, with a stream flowing along its bed. Twenty miles from the sea, Mr.
Mclntyre crossed it dry ; higher up, it was often dry for 10 miles at a stretch,
and the general width was found to be from 30 to 40 yards. The party called
at the Bowen Downs Station, at the head of the Thompson. The cattle there
were all clean and in splendid condition, notwithstanding the dryness of the
season. From that point to Cooper?s Creek the country was well watered, but
unstocked. The whole of the country between the Darling and Cooper?s Creek
has been minutely examined by Mr. Mclntyre, who states that, even in the
driest season, the route is perfectly practicable for stock, there being three per-
manent rivers between the Paroo and Cooper?s Creek. A journal? and field-,
book, on an excellent system, were kept throughout the journey; and the
position of all the rivers and important points ascertained by astronomical
observations, and the magnetic variations carefully notched. Not a single
shower of rain fell during the trip across to the Gulf and back.
With regard to the supposed traces of Leichhardt discovered by Mr. Mcln-
tyre, these consist of certain marked trees in the neighbourhood of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, and two old strayed horses, which the traveller brought back
with him. The trees were each marked with a single L, cut evidently by a
skilled hand. One of the letters was cut in the bark, and was 32 inches lon�-
by about 12 inches in width. The other was marked deeply in the wood, the
bark having been removed for the purpose. This latter was 5] inches lon�-
and cut evidently with an inch-and-a-half tomahawk. These marked trees
were close together, showing that a camp had been established between them,
and unquestionably during a dry season, as they stand on flooded ground. As
to the horses found by Mr. Mclntyre, it is remarked that no horses have ever
been lost, in the neighbourhood of the locality in which they were found, by any
known explorer, _ Both of them were old horses. Mr. Mclntyre says that he
had horses in his troop fifteen or sixteen years of age, which performed the
whole journey well, while those picked up by him were knocked up in a very
shoit time. Ihis is advanced as a proof of their being of great age, for when
found, they were ? rolling fat.? There were illegible brands on both of?them
and there was a blotched brand on the same part of the back of each. One of
them was a bay, and the other a black.
Further details of these discoveries of Mr, Mclntyre were given in a letter
to the Editor of the ?Age? by Dri D. Wilkie and Dr, F. Mueller: the most
important were as follow :
On a new principal tributary of the Flinders River, Mr. Mclntyre passed
to the main stream of the Flinders, observing in about 20� 40's., and about
one degree westward of Burke and Wills? track, two old horses, an event to.


which too much importance cannot be attached, when it is remembered that
neither the Victorian explorers, nor Landsborough, nor A. Gregory, nor Leich-
hardt, in his first glorious expedition, abandoned any horses in any adjacent
locality, Mr. Walker?s horses being left about 300 miles to the east. A still
more important discovery rewarded Mr, Mclntyre?s exertions after having
reached, on the Flinders line, the Gulf of Carpentaria; for, on his return
journey, whilst following up the main east branch of the Flinders River, he
noticed on its western bank, in approximate latitude 20� s., two trees, each
hearing a large L, no number attached, marking, as we with Mclntyre feel
convinced, a Leichhardtian camp. These L?s are clearly distinct from any
marks of Landsborough?s camps, who in that latitude kept to the eastern bank
of the Flinders, and who, moreover, attached a consecutive number to his
marked camp-trees. If further proofs of distinction were wanting, we might
add that the bark had encroached to the extent of four or five inches on the
incision of the letters, whereby a much greater age is established than that of
Landsborough?s camps; and still further, we have the evidence of one of the
natives who served in both Landsborough?s and Mclntyre?s expeditions, who
declares that the camp did not belong to the expedition of Landsborough. The
position of these momentous trees being in flooded ground, it would have been
vain to search for further camp traces.?
An account of the agitation, set on foot at Melbourne, for a new expedition
in search of Leichhardt, or further traces of him, is given in the following
extracts of letters from Dr. Mueller to Sir Roderick Murchison. The first letter
is dated 24th January, 1865. ?By the enclosed documents you will perceive
that the account of Leichhardt?s massacre on the Baroo is entirely disproved by
Mr. Mclntyre?s expedition. As a fellow-labourer with Leichhardt in the field
of the Natural Sciences in this country, I feel I owe it to him not to cease in
my exertions for the revelation of his fate, especially now that our knowledge
of his movements has passed into a new phasis. Within a few days I con-
template lecturing publicly on the subject, to endeavour to arouse sympathy
for the forsaken travellers, and to call upon the ladies of all Australia to
gather the means of sending forth a new searching party. What a triumph if
the Ladies? Expedition should disclose Leichhardt?s fate! If you would extend
your sympathy to the poor forsaken men, your weight of authority would
exercise a most favourable influence on the new enterprise, which, even if it
fail to solve the Leichhardt mystery, would not fail to reveal many an interest-
ing feature of the Australian interior.? On the 24th of February Dr. Mueller
again writes:?? It was a bold step on my part to call forth a Ladies? Com-
mittee, as we have no precedent for such an organization; but it has proved
successful, and I believe that in future we may rely upon the ladies for
assisting in many other philanthropic objects in a similar manner. Should a
spirited leader be found for the expedition, and a sufficient fund, I have no
doubt that the enterprise will be afterwards carried on by successive private
contributions and occasional Government subsidies, until Leichhardt?s fate is
fully known, and therewith the greater part of the yet unknown western
interior explored.?
The last communication from Dr. Mueller, dated the 22nd of April last,
announces the successful progress of his scheme. He says, ? The Leichhardt
movement is fully secure; it is merely a question whether the Ladies? Search
Expedition takes the field six months earlier or later. The ? Brisbane Courier ?
says, ? Never can we allow the Victorian ladies to do this work of charity and
humanity alone; Leichhardt dead or Leichhardt alive, we have no business to
remain for seventeen years in uncertainty about it! The ladies have written
to Her Majesty, the Princess of Wales, and the Empress of France, and I have
advised them to address also the Princess Royal of Prussia. Although the
3000?. for the first two years? search will be unquestionably gathered?if not


here alone, at least by the aid of the generous and wealthy of the globe?it
may be found necessary to have the search continued for several years more.
Under any circumstances the Ladies? Expedition is likely to accomplish what
Leichhardt intended, namely, to open up the great western half of the con-
tinent, an object, next to the exploration of Central Africa, the most important
in the whole domain of Geography. If once the Ladies? Expedition is fairly
started, and despatches of interest and hope are received, it will then need only
about 300 Z. annually from each of the Governments of South-Eastern Australia
to maintain it in the field.?
The following letter from Mr. Edward Wilson, of the ? Melbourne Argus,
to Sir Roderick Murchison, relates to the same subject:?
? Dear Sir,
? You showed such an intelligent interest in our friend Mueller?s new
movement in search of the unfortunate Leichhardt, that I think it right to
forward you a passage from his last letter, and also an article from the recent
Melbourne papers.
? Although I am well aware of the difficulty you point out of arousing
effective assistance in such a case, this seems a very peculiar one, and presents
features which really deserve the attention of your great Society.
? Although these poor men have been lost for seventeen years, the annals of
Australian discovery present remarkable instances, which should prevent us
from looking upon any enterprise in searching for them as hopeless. You
will remember the astonishing case of Buckley, who was found by the first
settlers at Melbourne, after thirty-three years? residence among the blacks,
and that case of the sailor Morrill, discovered in Moreton Bay after a residence
amongst the blacks of twenty years. A very possible condition of affairs is
that which would ensue from the death of Leichhardt, ?himself dead, no one
else of the party capable of conducting the expedition, and the survivors or
some of them being still amongst the blacks. In any event the contingency
pointed out by Dr, Mueller seems very probable that this research, if properly
supported, will open out the western portion of the interior of the continent.
? Permit me to say, Sir, that the functions of your valuable Society seem
scarcely to exhaust themselves in the reception of great discoveries and the
publication and recording of them, and that a very large amount of sympathy
must always be felt for those who fail indeed in these gigantic enterprises, but
more still for those of whose fate we are left in doubt.
? The vast prestige attaching to your Society, and to the formation of which
you have yourself so greatly contributed, would render any amount of recogni-
tion upon its part of immense value to an enterprise of this kind, even if no pecu-
niary assistance could be rendered; and as it seems likely that this scheme may
grow into a sustained and prolonged effort, it is very important that we should
give it all the influence that we can secure for it, from whatever source.
? I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully,
?Edw. Wilson.
