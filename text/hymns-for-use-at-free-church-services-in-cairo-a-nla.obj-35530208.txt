Master, speak ! Thy servant heareth,
Waiting for Thy gracious word,
Longing for Thy voice that cheereth;
Master! let it now be heard.
I am listening, Lord, for Thee;
What hast Thou to say to me ?
Speak to me by name, O Master,
Let me know it is to me ;
Speak, that I may follow faster,
With a step more firm and free,
Where the Shepherd leads the flock,
In the shadow of the Rock.
Master, speak! though least and lowest
Let me not unheard depart;
Master, speak ! for O Thou knowest
All the yearning of my heart,
Knowest all its truest need ;
Speak ! and make me blest indeed.
Master, speak ! and make me ready,
When Thy voice is truly heard,
With obedience glad and steady,
Still to follow every word.
I am listening, Lord, for Thee ;
Master, speak ! O speak to me!
Come, my soul, thy suit prepare ;
Jesus loves to answer prayer ;
He Himself has bid thee pray,
Therefore will not say thee nay.
Thou art coming to a King;
Large petitions with thee bring ;
For His grace and power are such,
Name can ever ask too much.
With my burden I begin:
Lord, remove this load of sin ;
Let Thy blood, for sinners spilt,
Set my conscience free from guilt.
Lord, I come to Thee for rest;
Take possession of my breast;
There Thy blood-bought right maintain,
And without a rival reign.
! As the image in the glass
\ Answers the beholder’s face,
Thus unto my heart appear,
Print Thine own resemblance there.
While I am pilgrim here,
Let Thy love my spirit cheer ;
As my Guide, my Guard, my Friend,
Lead me to my journey’s end.
LEAD, kindly Light, amid the encircling
Lead Thou me on ; [gloom.
The night is dark, and I am far from home,
Lead Thou me on.
Keep Thou my feet; Ido not ask to see
The distant scene; one step enough for me.
I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou
Shouldst lead me on ;
1 loved to choose and see my path ; but
Lead Thou me on. [now
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
! Pride ruled my will: remember not past
years.
So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it
Will lead me on, [still
O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent,
The night is gone ; [till
And with the morn-those Angel faces
smile,
Which I have loved long since, and lost
awhile.
From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat; •
’Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.
There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads—
A place than all beside more sweet;
It is the blood-stained mercy-seat.
There is a spot where spirits blend,
And friend holds fellowship with friend ;
Though sundered far, by faith the meet
Around one common mercy-seat.


There, there on eagle wing we soar,
And time and sense seem all no more;
And heaven comes down our souls to greet
And glory crowns the mercy-seat.
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world
of sin ?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties
pressed ?
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.
Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surg-
ing round ?
On Jesus’ bosom nought but calm is found.
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far
away ?
In Jesus’ keeping we are safe and they.
Peace, perfect peace, our future all
unknown ?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
Peace, perfect peace,- death shadowing us
and ours ?
Jesus has vanquished death and all its
powers.
It is enough: earth’s struggles soon shall
cease,
And Jesus call us to heaven’s perfect peace.
I could not do without Thee,
O Saviour of the lost,
Whose precious blood redeemed me
At such tremendous cost;
Thy righteousness, Thy pardon,
Thy precious blood must be
My only hope and comfort,
My glory and my plea.
I could not do without Thee,
I cannot stand alone,
I have no strength or goodness,
No wisdom of my own;
But thou, beloved Saviour,
Art all in all to me,
And weakness will be power
If leaning hard on Thee.
I could not do without Thee ;
No other friend can read
The spirit’s strange deep longings,-.
Interpreting its need;
No human heart could enter
Each dim recess of mine,
And soothe, and hush, and calm it,
O blessed Lord, but Thine.
I could not do without Thee ;
For years are fleeting fast,
And soon in solemn loneness
The river must be passed ;
But Thou wilt never leave me ;
And though the waves roll high,
I know Thou wilt be near me
And whisper, It is I.
OUR Blest Redeemer, ere He breathed
His tender last farewell,
A Guide, a Comforter, bequeath’d
With us to dwell.
He came in tongues of living flame,
To teach, convince, subdue ;
All-powerful as the wind He came,
As viewless too.
He comes sweet influence to impart,
A gracious willing Guest,
While He can find one humble heart
Wherein to rest.
And His that gentle voice we hear,
Soft as the breath of even,
That checks each fault, that calms each fear
And speaks of Heav’n.
And every virtue we possess,
And every conquest won,
And every thought of holiness,
Are His alone.


O praise the Father; praise the Son ;
Blest Spirit, praise to Thee :
All praise to God, the Three in One,
The One in Three !
Jesu, the very thought of Thee
With sweetness fills my breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.
Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest name,
O Saviour of mankind !
O Hope of every contrite heart,
O joy of all the meek,
To those who fall how kind Thou art!
How good to those who seek !
But what to those who find ? Ah ! this
Nor tongue nor pen can show :
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know.
Jesu, our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our prize wilt be ;
Jesu, be Thou our glory now,
And through eternity.
Soldiers of Christ, arise,
And put your armour on,
Strong in the strength which God supplies
Through His eternal Son ;
Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
And in His mighty power,
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
Is more than conqueror.
Stand then in His great might,
With all His stx-ength endued ;
But take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God ;
That, having all things done,
And all your conflicts passed,
Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone,
And stand entire at last.
Stand then against your foes,
In close and firm array;
Legions of wily fiends oppose
Throughout the evil day ;
But meet the sons of night,
But mock their vain design,
Armed in the arms of heavenly light,
Of righteousness divine.
Leave no unguarded place.
No weakness of the soul
Take every virtue, every grace,
And fortify the whole :
Indissolubly joined,
To battle all proceed ;
But arm yourselves with all the mind
That was in Christ, your Head.
Jesu, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy Bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high;
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
O receive my soul at last.
Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stay’d,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.
Thou, O Christ, art all I want,
More than all in Thee I find !
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind :
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness ;
False and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace.
Plenteous grace witli Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound;
Make and keep me pure within;
Thou of Life the Fountain art;
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity.


God bless our native land!
May His protecting hand
Still guard our shore :
May peace her power extend,
Foe be transformed to friend,
And Britain’s right depend
On war no more.
O Lord, our monarch bless
With strength and righteousness ;
Long may he reign :
His heart inspire and move
With wisdom from above ;
And in a nation’s Idve
His throne maintain.
May just and righteous laws
Uphold the public cause,
And bless our isle ?
Home of the brave and free,
Thou land of liberty,
We pray that still on thee
Kind Heaven may smile,
Nor on this land alone,
But be God’s mercies shown
From shore to shore :
And may the nations see
That men should brothers be
And form one family,
The wide world o’er.
Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,
Who bidd’st the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
O Saviour ! whose almighty word
The winds and waves submissive heard,
Who walkcdst on the foaming deep,
And calm amid its rage didst sleep;
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril pn the sea.
O Sacred Spirit, Who didst brood
Upon the chaos dark and rude,
Who bad’st its angry tumult cease,
And gavest light, and life, and peace :
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
O Trinity of love and power,
Our brethren shield in danger’s hour ;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe’er they go ;
And ever let there rise to Thee
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea
Every morning mercies new
Fall as fresh as early dew ;
Every morning let us pay
Tribute with the early day :
For thy mercies, Lord, are sure ;
Thy compassion doth endure.
Still the greatness of Thy love
Daily doth our sins remove ;
Daily, far as east from west,
Lifts the burden from the breast;
Gives unbought to those who pray
Strength to stand in evil day.
Let our prayers each morn prevail,
That these gifts may never fail ;
And as we confess the sin,
And the tempter’s power within,
Every morning, for the strife,
Feed us with the Bread of life.
As the morning light returns,
As the sun with splendour burns,
Teach us still to turn to Thee,
Ever blessed Trinity,
With our hands our hearts to raise
In unfailing prayer and praise.
Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God ;
He, whose word cannot be broken,
Formed thee for His own abode.
On the Rock of ages founded,
' What can shake thy sure repose ?
With salvation’s walls surrounded,
i Thou may’st smile at all thy foes.


See, the streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove :
Who can faint while such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage ?
Grace which, like the Lord, the Giver,
Never fails from age to age.
Saviour, if in Zion’s city
Thou enrol my humble name,
Let the world deride or pity,
I will glory in the shame :
Fading is the sinner’s pleasure,
All his boasted pomp and show ;
Solid joys and lasting treasure
None but Zion’s children know.
Brief life is here our portion,
Brief sorrow, short-lived care ;
The life that knows no ending,
The tearless life is there.
O happy retribution!
Short toil, eternal rest ;
For mortals and for sinners,
A mansion with the blest!
That we should look, poor wanderers,
To have our home on high !
That worms should seek for dwellings
Beyond tire starry sky !
And now we fight the battle,
But then shall wear the crown
Of full and everlasting
And passionless renow.
And now we watch and struggle,
And now we live in hope,
And Zion in her anguish
With Babylon must cope ;
But He whom now we trust in
Shall then be seen and known
And they that know and see Him
Shall have Him for their own.
O sweet and blessed country,
The home of God’s elect!
O sweet and blessed country,
That eager hearts expect!
Jesu, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest,
Who art, with God the Father
And spirit, ever blest.
Forward ! be our watchword,
Steps and voices joined;
Seek the things before us,
Not a look behind ;
Burns the fiery pillar
At our army’s head ;
Who shall dream of shrinking,
By our Captain led ?
Forward through the desert,
Through the toil and fight;
Canaan lies before us,
Zion beams with light.
Forward, flock of Jesus,
Salt of all the earth,
Till each yearning purpose
Spring to glorious birth :
Sick, they ask for healing,
Blind, they grope for day;
Pour upon the nations
Wisdom’s loving ray.
Forward, out of error,
Leave behind the night;
Forward, through the darkness,
Forward into light.
Glories upon glories
Hath our God prepared,
By the souls that love Him
One day to be shared ;
Eye hath not beheld them,
Ear hath never heard,
Nor of these hath uttered
Thought or speech a word.
Forward, ever forward,
Clad in armour bright,
Till the veil be lifted,
Till our faith be sight.
Far o’er you horizon
Rise the city towers,
Where our God abideth ;
That fair home is ours.
Flash the gates with jasper,
Shine the streets with gold,
Flows the gladdening’ river,
Shedding joys untold.
Thither, onward thither,
In the Spirit’s might;
Pilgrims to your country,
Forward into light,
