couragement to any one engaged in the arduous task of opening a route to the
western coast. It is not in a spirit of rivalry or opposition, then, that the
second expedition is proposed, but as an extension of the undertaking projected
hy the Government. They want an exploration of unknown territory within
South Australia, and Mr. Ball is desirous of connecting that territory with the
western coast. Both these enterprises are important, and the one may be made
to assist the other.
The honour of performing the only great feat of Australian exploration which
which yet remains to be achieved ought to belong to this colony. The unknown
country which it is proposed to examine lies adjacent to our own territory, and
may he entered hy a route which Stuart opened in the course of his first re-
markable expedition?a route which he believed would have led him into a
well-grassed and well-watered region, but which he and his one companion had
to abandon from their being utterly destitute of supplies. Thus, the door which
leads into this unknown region has already been opened, and it is probable that
the first explorer who enters will find a very favourable country before him.
But it is not only from what Mr. Stuart saw that we are justified in forming a
favourable opinion of the country to the westward. We published some in-
formation a short time ago from Mr. Larnach, a gentleman from Western
Australia, relative to a scheme for connecting the country near the Great Bight
on the south coast with the very point on the western coast which Mr. Ball
now proposes to reach. Mr. Larnach, who had been inland a considerable
distance from the Great Bight, had judged from information received from
natives and from other sources that an exploration from coast to coast would be
of easy accomplishment. So fully was he convinced of this that he made an
offer to the Western Australian Government on behalf of himself and others for
taking up a large area of land on condition that when the party had succeeded
in driving sheep from the one coast to the other they should be allowed certain
pre-emptive rights over a portion of the land included in their leases. This
offer is at the present moment under consideration, the Local Government
having been obliged to refer it to the Imperial authorities on account of such
matters not being provided for by the land regulations of the colony. Sup-
posing, then, that Mr. Larnach?s scheme should be approved of, his party will,
at a very early date, start for the western coast. They believe, from what the
natives have told them and from what they have seen of the country round
the Bight, that there is a good pastoral region inland. All this is favourable to
the supposition that Mr. Ball?s expedition would be successful. If there is good
country to the westward, he would inevitably meet with it by crossing from
Mount Margaret; and even if the Western Australian pioneers were to be
striking out at the same time for their proposed settlement on the opposite
coast, the two expeditions would in no respect nullify each other?s useful-
ness.
4. Notes on the New Settlement of Somerset , near Cape York. By-
Sir George Bowen, Governor of Queensland.
Communicated through the Colonial Office.
Sir George Bowen, in a despatch to Mr. Cardwell, dated October 4th, 1864,
gives the following particulars relating to the founding of the settlement on
Albany Island, the preparatory surveys for which have been recorded in previous
communications published in the Society?s ? Proceedings ?:? *
H.M.S. Salamander, Commander the Hon. J. Carnegie, returned to Moreton
Bay on the 19th September, bringing the news of the successful foundation of

the new settlement of Somerset. Sir G. Bowen presumed the necessary measures
would be taken to notify to mariners in general the establishment, by the
Government of Queensland, of the two new ports and settlements on the north-
eastern coast of Australia, ?namely, at Cardwell, in Eockingham Bay, and at
Somerset, near Cape York. The crews of vessels wrecked in Torres Straits,
and the neighbouring seas, will now find safe harbours of refuge, while the
captains of passing ships can procure at the new ports fresh provisions and
water and other supplies. He had in previous despatches drawn attention
to the facilities now given for the establishment of a line of mail-steamers
from Singapore to Sydney, via Torres Straits, affording (in addition to many
other advantages) means of direct communication between Australia, India,
and China. Arrangements could, he believed, be made by' which this pro-
posed new line of steamers might be combined with the lines already established.
Periodical steam-communication now exists between Singapore, Batavia, and
Timor at one end, and between Sydney, Brisbane, and Cape York at the other,
and it remains only to supply the link wanting between Cape York and Timor,
a distance of about 1000 miles.
Commander the Hon, J. Carnegie reported, on his return to Moreton Bay,
that the Salamander arrived at Port Albany on the 29th July. The process
of settlement commenced by the felling of trees, a few yards above the bend in
Somerset Bay; a labour which was performed by a party of marines, assisted
by the ship?s carpenters. The barque Golden Eagle, with the passengers and
stores for the colony, arrived on the Ist of August, and the following morning
the live stock was landed ; the sheep, 252 in number, were placed on Albany
Island, and the horses, seven in number, on the mainland. The site for the
town of Somerset had been admirably chosen?on an elevation of from 60 to
70 feet above the level of the sea, exposed to the sea-breezes during either
monsoon, bordered on the west by a constant running stream of fresh water,
and commanding on the north an extensive and most picturesque view of
Torres Straits with the adjoining islands. All vessels passing through the
Straits will be within signal-distance. The situation appeared to be remark-
ably healthy, judging from the manner in which the crew of the Salamander
were necessarily exposed to the sun and water, from sunrise to sunset, for 30
days without an 3? ill-effects. Commander Carnegie relates that he made a short
journey across the peninsula, going up the Kennedy Eiver as far as it was
navigable. From the head of the river to the Gulf of Carpentaria the land
was indifferent sandy soil, ironstone ridges, and swamps with sandy bottom.
His party came out on the Gulf a short distance south of Bed Island ; travelled
thence along the beach to the north-east for 7 miles, and then struck across for
the settlement. The soil here appeared to be of better quality; but throughout
the land he traversed no cattle-stations could be formed, on account of the
density of the scrub.
Dr. Haran, e.n., the Medical Officer, thus reports upon the climate and
natural features of the new settlement:?
? Although this settlement was only founded about a month ago, and the
meteorological observations recorded during the brief interval which has since
elapsed, must of necessity be somewhat defective, 1 consider it my duty to
report, for your Excellency?s information, that they have been very favourable
so far. Between the 4th of August and this date (September 6), the thermo-
meter has registered, in the shade, a mean temperature of 78�, greatest mini-
mum 61�; mean ditto, 70�; maximum, 84�; mean ditto, 82�; greatest
difference between wet and dry bulbs, 12�; mean ditto, 6�; thus avoiding
either extremes of dryness or supersaturatiou?both equally injurious. Greatest
range, 20�; mean ditto, 9�. In the sun?maximum, 93�; mean ditto, 90� ;
while the barometer has invariably stood highest about 9 o?clock a m., and

lowest about 3 o?clock a feet according with nearly all tropical experience
in atmospheric tension and pressure. The nights have been delightfully cool
and mild, with heavy dews occasionally ; a slight sprinkling of rain occurred
on three occasions, and the wind, which, with the exception of three nights of
westerly, during which the temperature was reduced to 61�, blew with variable
force from a south-east direction, tended to modify the mid-day heat (greatest
between 11 o?clock a.m. and 2 o?clock p.m.), so much that large working-
parties from H.M.S. Salamander, and the marines and civilians of the esta-
blishment, were constantly exposed to its direct influence, excepting at meal
times, without suffering any ill-effects; so much so, indeed, and so far from
being injurious to them was this direct solar heat, that the Salamander had no
sick-list for several days, and the few cases of illness which have occurred on
shore were not even indirectly the result of climatical influences. This is a
circumstance of much significance, and augurs favourably for the future pros-
pects of the new settlement, while it moreover solves, in some measure, the
important question as to whether European labour can be made available in
Inter-tropical Australia. It has been proved that Europeans can work in the
sun with safety at Cape York, within 11� of the Equator, in August and Sep-
tember, ?a fact which I believe to be unprecedented, if not an impossibility, in
any other part of the world except Australia, in the same or even a much
higher latitude; and it is to be presumed that they can do so with equal
impunity during that period of the year in which the south-east wind prevails
?viz., between March and November. It is even possible that outdoor work
may be performed by Europeans during certain portions of the remaining
months, when this wind alternates with the north-west, and dissipates the
oppressive atmospheric condition which must necessarily result from it. The
winds here evidently partake more of the south-east trade than the monsoon
character, though not strictly belonging to either system from their regularity ;
and it would seem as if this spur of the great Australian continent occupied a
sort of neutral ground between the two, but in closer proximity to the region
of the south-east trade-wind, which is said to prevail here for at least nine
months of the year. The situation of the township is not only well selected,
and admirably adapted for receiving the full benefit of the prevailing winds,
but it also possesses the additional attraction of beautiful scenery, and a mag-
nificent view of the inner passage through Torres Straits. It contains some
highly picturesque ridges of from 60 to 140 feet elevation above the mean sea-
level, for the most part covered with dense scrub, while the lower grounds?
which present a gradual ascent towards a central plateau, from which nearly
all the ridges extend ?are equally well favoured, and over the entire site some
magnificent forest-trees, Eucalypti, Melaleuca, Erithryna?, &c., and the graceful
Caryota-palm further enhance the beauty of the whole; at the same time that
the absence of the trees and rank vegetation, which prevail in other tropical
countries, would almost divest one of the idea of being only a few degrees
removed from the equator. The heights are covered with ironstone, partly
disintegrated, overlying a dense stratum of quartzose sandstone, which in
some places, as at Cape York and Albany Island, is observed overlying, and
in some places replaced by conglomerate and porphyritic granite. Ihe surface soil
(ironstone, clay, and decomposed vegetation) is at present very scanty, but
will no doubt rapidly increase in quantity, and be made available for various
purposes. The lower grounds and slopes possess a soil composed of ironstone,
clay, decayed vegetation, and in some places sand, in varying proportions.
The water-supply is inexhaustible, and within easy distance of all parts of the
township, while the surrounding country, as far as it has been explored, has
been found to possess equal advantages, and already four fresh-water lagoons,
several peat-swamps, and a few rivulets, in addition to the Polo, have been
discovered in a direction to the southward and westward of the settlement. It


is to be presumed that the geological formation of the peninsula, from the Ken-
nedy River to Cape York, does not differ materially from that which obtains in
and about Somerset. There is no rank vegetation, and with the exception of
creepers very little underwood to be met anywhere, while the physical aspect
of what has been seen consists of belts of forest and scrub, an undulating out-
line, a series of ridges, and between the lines of scrub open patches, sparsely
wooded, and partaking of the appearance of English park-scenery. These cha-
racteristics, taken in connexion with the absence of mud or mangrove swamps
of sufficient extent to be so designated (for the narrow fringes of the former on
either side of Somerset Bay, and the mixture of both on an equally insignifi-
cant scale in a few of the bays towards Cape York, are not worthy of so
ominous a title) afford most satisfactory guarantees of the continuance of the
unexceptionable sanitary status which obtains at present throughout the entire
year.?
5. Journey of M. Gerhard Rohlfs through Marocco and Tuat, 1863-64.
By Dr. Augustus Petermann, Hon. Corr. Mem. r.g.s.
M. Gerhard Rohlfs has arrived in safety at Tripoli, after his journey from
Marocco, towards the expenses of which the Council contributed 501.* The
following is a sketch of the route followed, communicated in a letter to
Sir Roderick I. Murchison, by Dr. Petermann, to whom M, Rohlfs has sent
his journals for publication in the ? Geographische Mittheilungen.?
? Gotha, 23 February, 1865.
?You will have received from M. Gerhard Rohlfs of Bremen a com-
munication relative to his journey from Marocco to Tripoli, for which the
Royal Geographical Society kindly assisted him with the grant of 50 1. As
I have received all his original journals and papers, I consider it to be my
duty to acquaint you, in a few words, of the value of this journey in a
geographical point of view. First, then, in performing the journey from a
point between Mekines and Fes in Marocco to Tafilet, he crossed the principal
portion of the Atlas, the only snow-covered mountain-mass in Africa; for
Kilima-njaro and Kenia are only isolated peaks. Gerhard Rohlfs is the first
educated and intelligent European who succeeded in crossing that highly
interesting mountainous region, and penetrating beyond it: when he explored
the extensive chain of the fertile valleys and oases of Tafilet, Tied Saura,
Tsabit, Timmi, Tuat and Tidikelt, the most important regions between
Algeria and Timbuktu, which French travellers and armies have for
thirty-five years in vain endeavoured to reach, none of them having ever
been able to penetrate as far as Gerhard Rohlfs. At Tuat, his small means
being well nigh exhausted, he returned to the coast at Tripoli by way of
Ghadames, in order to prepare himself afresh for another journey to the
interior. At the request of his relatives and myself he came to Germany for
a short time, but is now on his way back to Africa. On the opportunity
of conversing with him about his journeys and his plans, I recom-
mended to him for his present journey the exploration of the Wady
Irharhar?by recent research shown to be the Niger of the ancients (Fluvius
Nigris of Pliny, Gher of Ptolemy),?of the highlands of the Tuarego, con-
taining the sources of the Irharhar, and of the headstreams of the Joliba, by
which proposed line of journey he might probably not touch Timbuktu, a
place popularly rather over-valued, and which has been sufficiently described
