Preface
MY previous work dealing with the early pioneer families of
Victoria and Riverina met with such a measure of success that I
decided to undertake a further work embracing early families of the
whole of Australia to be completed in a series of volumes with one or
more volumes devoted to the records of each State.
The present volume deals mainly with Victorian and Riverina
families, but, as it has been found impossible to include the records of all
the old families from this part of Australia in one volume, I hope to
include the family records of many more Victorian and Riverina families
in my next volume.
A work of this kind cannot be brought to a successful conclusion
without the active assistance of members of the families concerned, and
to those members who have taken an interest in the compilation of their
family genealogies my sincere thanks are due. "It is inevitable that people
with any reflective capacity should occasionally ponder over the countless
factors that have gone to make up their collective personalities.” We have
some measure of responsibility to make our own record worthy of all
that is best in that which has been bequeathed to us. It is ungracious to
forget how great is the amount standing to the credit account of the
pioneers of this country in respect of human uplift and high example in
treading new paths.
This series of volumes is dedicated by special permission to Their
Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Kent, who have graciously
made available their photographs for reproduction. Unfortunately, be-
cause of the War and its consequent demands upon his services at home,
His Royal Highness’s assumption of the office of Governor-General and
Commander-in-Chief of the Commonwealth of Australia has been
indefinitely postponed.
My grateful thanks are due, in the first instance, to the Right
Honourable R. G. Menzies, P.C., K.C., M.P., LL.M., Prime Minister of


the Commonwealth of Australia, for the interest which he has shown in
this work by contributing a Foreword, and also to Mr. I. Trentham-
Edgar, a Fellow of the Society of Australian Genealogists, who has given
me the same helpful assistance as he afforded me in my first work on the
early families of Victoria. The comprehensive indices to this volume arc
largely due to his efforts. Valuable information has been also made avail-
able by Mr. A. S. Kenyon and I have to pay a special tribute to the
courteous assistance given to me by the officers of the Public Library of
Victoria.

Foreword
I AM glad to write a foreword to the first portion of Mr. Alexander
Henderson’s work on the early pioneer families of Australia. This
volume is the product of years of careful and comprehensive research in
the field of Australian genealogy. It was appropriate that Mr. Henderson
as a Victorian, inspired by the Centenary of his State, should have
recorded in his earlier work, which appeared in 1936, the history of the
early pioneer families of Victoria and Riverina, but in now extending his
work to the early families of all the States, he has placed the whole of
Australia in his debt.
The records of pioneer families, while not perhaps formal history,
have much more than a purely genealogical value, especially when treated
in such a comprehensive and national way. They are the stuff of which
history is made. Nor is this volume merely a dictionary of births,
marriages and deaths of the Landed Gentry of Australia; it contains
the story of people who, by courage, vision, hard work and dogged
endurance, succeeded in settling a distant and strange continent and
handed on to us our goodly heritage.
We are still, historically, a young country. We are not rich in
national memorials. But I am sure that no more suitable or permanently
valuable tribute could be paid to the early pioneers than this record of
their lives, their labours and achievements.

Preservation of Family Records
IT IS my earnest hope that the genealogies published in this volume
will be extended and expanded by private research. Officers of the
recently founded and influentially supported Genealogical Society of
Victoria, which has its headquarters in Melbourne, or of the longer
established Society of Australian Genealogists, Sydney, can offer expert
guidance to those willing to engage in a little interesting research work,
the results of which cannot fail to be of special family importance.
I should like to make a strong appeal to those who have the custody
of family papers, such as diaries, memoranda, newspaper cuttings, letters,
and account books, to deposit them, no matter how few they may be in
individual cases, with the Public Library in the capital city of the State
to which they chiefly relate. The preservation of these manuscripts will
ensure that Australia’s early history will not fade into oblivion. It may
be that many families fear that confidential material might be abused,
but overseas experience affords no instance where information has been
wrongly applied.
Family descents can be readily traced in Australia because of its
comparatively recent settlement, and the writing of its history can there-
fore be assured if a real tradition of preserving and depositing papers can
be maintained, but delay is dangerous. The roll-top desk and spacious
houses of the past are disappearing, and, amid the growing appeals for
waste paper, many treasures are in jeopardy.
The Historical Department of the University of Melbourne is keenly
interested in safeguarding such collections of family papers, and those
willing to make donations or loans of manuscript material to the
repositories mentioned, could not do better than communicate with Mr.
G. F. James, M.A., an officer of the Department, who has wide experience
in such matters.

Robertson of Colac
WILLIAM ROBERTSON of Colac, Victoria,
was born at Alvie, Inverness-shire, Scotland, 7th
October, 1798, and received his education at
Baldow School, the Dominie of which, Mr. Anderson, later
became Chaplain to Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle. Son
of a sheep farmer, William Robertson received a thorough
training in sheep breeding on his father’s farm, where he
William Robertson (Pioneer).
remained until he was about twenty-three years of age.
Attracted by the generous terms of land settlement in Van
Diemen's Land offered by the Colonial Office to settlers
with experience and capital, he and his brother John decided
to emigrate, and arrived at Hobart Town in the ship
"Regalia” in 1822.
The brothers had excellent credentials from the Secretary
of State for the Colonies to Colonel Sorell, then Adminis-
trator of Van Diemen’s Land, also a generous supply of
capital, and therefore, shortly after their arrival, they were
authorised to select 2,560 acres of land near Campbell Town,
with almost unlimited pasturing rights on Crown Lands.
Here the brothers remained until 1832, when they sold the
property and became importers and warehousemen in
Hobart Town, at the same time farming a small estate at
Green Ponds, near Melton Mowbray. Their business in
Hobart Town grew rapidly and they became one of the
most prominent mercantile firms in that settlement.
William Robertson was first associated with Port Phillip
as early as 1835. The colonists in Van Diemen’s Land at
this time had their curiosity aroused by the glowing reports
of this new country, supplied by Hovell and Hume in 1824.
Batman, anxious to inspect the country, decided to fit out
Margaret Robertson (nee Whyte).
an expedition to New Holland, as it was then known. He
interested William Robertson in the project and the latter
agreed to defray half the cost of the venture. The story of
Batman’s first and second expeditions to Port Phillip is well
known, and the formation of the Port Phillip Association,
of which William Robertson was a member, and the treaty
entered into with the natives for the purchase of land, which
was later declared illegal by the Home Government, is all
part of the history of Victoria.
In 1836 William Robertson decided to inspect the new
country for himself, and crossed over to Port Phillip in the
"Nerval.” He was accompanied by Mr. Gellibrand, and
owing to encountering adverse winds, they were compelled
to land at Westernport instead of Port Phillip. The actual
date of landing was 25th January, 1836. They then over-
landed to Melbourne, which they thought was much nearer


to Westernport than it proved to be. Their journey was a
perilous one, and several times they were in danger of
dying of thirst.
Accompanied by the well known historical figure,
William Buckley, as guide, William Robertson, along with
Mr. Gellibrand, made an expedition into the back country
west of Corio Bay. The country appealed to him, but he
returned to Hobart Town in the same year to decide his
future movements. In June, 1837, he made another crossing
to Port Phillip and attended the first Government land
sale, afterwards visiting his relations, the Whytes, who had
taken up Koonongwootong run near what is now Coleraine
township, and when returning to Melbourne he saw for the
first time the Warrion country, and the richly grassed plains
to the west of Colac, where he was destined to play such a
prominent part in the settlement of Victoria.
He was anxious to take up a Special Survey in this
district, but finding this impossible, in 1837 he purchased
at auction 5,000 acres of land at Colac in fee simple, and
about the same time he also purchased 7,000 acres at
Belinda on the Deep Creek, which afterwards became part
of the well known Sunbury Estate.
In connection with his purchase of 5,000 acres at Colac,
it is interesting to quote from a book written by the Rev.
John Dunmore Lang, D.D., which contains an account of
his journey of inspection of Port Phillip in 1846. He
writes:—
"A few years ago Mr. Robertson, a Scotch colonist of
Hobart Town, Van Diemen’s Land, who has accumulated
a handsome fortune in that Colony . . . purchased 5,000
acres of land ... on this beautiful lake. Our route lay
across this purchase which is still lying waste. It will be
a splendid estate by and by, and almost any part of it, in
its natural state, will form as magnificent a park for its
size around the future Manor House as any nobleman's
in England, with all the aid of centuries of cultivation
and adornment."
This was almost prophetic, as some years later William
Robertson erected a very fine mansion on this property.
In 1843 he purchased Captain Foster Fyans' run at Colac,
together with all the stock, and six years later acquired
Ondit run, also known as Domadalock, from William
Sprott Boyd; this property was 40,000 acres in extent, ten
miles north of Colac. William Robertson’s land at Colac
comprised 34,000 acres of freehold, in addition to large
areas of Crown land under Licence. He never unfairly
availed himself of any of the facilities afforded by the
various Land Acts, but always bought at open auction.
William Robertson became one of Port Phillip’s most
prominent pastoralists. He had purchased a fine herd from
Captain Fyans (the well known FF brand), which he
improved by selecting the best blood to be obtained in the
Colonies, and also by importing a number of pure bred
Herefords and Shorthorns, which he himself selected from
the best herds in the United Kingdom. This herd grew
until at one time he was running 10,000 head on his
property, and he still retained the FF brand.
In addition to his pastoral interests in Port Phillip, he
still retained his important business connections in Hobart,
where he usually resided, appointing a manager for his
Port Phillip properties. He retired from the Hobart busi-
ness in 1852, and together with his family, visited the Old
Country (sailing in the S.S. 'European" on 16th March,
1857), remaining there upwards of two years. It was not
until 1865 that he made Victoria his permanent home.
Too busy with his pioneering work to enter the political
arena, either in Van Diemen's Land or Victoria, William
Robertson nevertheless was always ready with financial or
other help for any movement for the benefit of the Colonies
in which he was interested, and he was among the leaders
of the anti-transportation movement in Van Diemen’s Land,
which culminated in the discontinuance of transportation
to that Colony in 1853.
William Robertson married, 10th September, 1834,
Margaret (born 19th April, 1811), only daughter of George
Whyte of Elwartlaw, Berwickshire, Scotland. She died at
Colac, 10th February, 1866.
He died at Colac, 18th January, 1874, having had issue
four sons and three daughters, of whom we treat.
After the death of William Robertson, his sons, John,
William, George Pringle and James, worked the properties
inherited by them, in conjunction, under the name of
Robertson Brothers, James holding the position equivalent
to that of Managing Director. They continued to specialize
in the breeding of Shorthorn cattle from the stud founded
by their father, and the famous FF brand was well known
at all the annual cattle sales throughout the country, stock
breeders from all over Australia and New Zealand attending
the annual sales of Robertson Brothers' cattle at Colac.
As an example of the magnitude of the Robertson
Brothers' stock transactions, at one sale at Colac the prices
aggregated upwards of £30,000, and in 1876 the stud
heifer "Roan Duchess" brought 2,200 guineas, and in 1878
the young bull "24th Duke of Derimut" sold at auction for
2,450 guineas. No expense was spared in the building up
of their herd, one purchase of thirty-seven head of the
Mount Derimut herd of Shorthorns amounting to £27,000,
including the bull "Oxford Cherry Duke” at £2,500.
Messrs. Robertson Brothers were successful breeders of
Clydesdales, and their stud stock included many fine speci

mens of this breed, imported from the United Kingdom and
New Zealand. When the stud was dispersed, mares sold at
170 guineas, and stallions up to 300 guineas. They were
also successful breeders of light horses suitable for the
Indian market.
The partnership of the Robertson Brothers was dissolved
in 1885.
We shall now treat individually the sons of William
and Margaret Robertson: —
Col. William St.L. Robertson,
C.B.E.
The eldest son:—-
[OHN ROBERTSON, was born at Hobart Town, Van
Diemen’s Land, 17th July, 1837, and educated at Rugby
and then went to the Agricultural College of Cirencester,
Gloucestershire, England, where he studied practical agri-
culture and chemistry. On his return to Australia he settled
on the family property at Colac, and on the death of
his father inherited that portion of the estate known as
Cororooke; he was in partnership with his brothers in the
firm of Robertson Brothers. He was a Justice of the Peace
for many years.

University at the Annual Oxford v. Cambridge Boat Race
in 1861, being a member of the winning crew. He was the
first of several young Australians who have taken part in
the famous inter-university boat race; the oar used by him
is still in possession of the family. He studied law and
was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1863, and
on his return to Australia in the following year, was
admitted to the Victorian Bar and practised in Melbourne
for several years.
William Robertson first entered the political arena in
1866, when he stood for the Polwarth and South Grenville
Electorate in the Legislative Assembly. He was defeated by
a small margin, but five years later won the seat for three
sessions (1871-74). He did not contest the next election,
but in 1880 he again successfully appealed to this electorate;
however, the House was dissolved the same year, and he was
defeated by a narrow margin by Mr, O’Hea. The latter died
shortly afterwards and William Robertson was returned
unopposed. He was again successful at the following general
election in 1883, but retired from the Legislative Assembly
in 1886, being elected to the Legislative Council in the


same year for the Western Province, a seat which he held
until 1888, when he finally retired from political life.
He was also for many years a member of the Colac Shire
Council, which he entered in 1877, and was President for
a term. On the death of his father in 1874, William Robert-
son inherited the Korangamoorah portion of the Colac
Estate, better known as The Hill, together with the family
mansion.

Armstrong
T OHN ARMSTRONG of Bush Station, Victoria, was
I a member of an old Scottish Border family, settled at
J Gilnochy, Dumfries-shire, and sailed from Greenock on
20th July, 1839, in the ship "Palmyra,” 446 tons register
(Captain Peter Brown), arriving in Port Phillip on 24th
November, 1839. He was accompanied by his wife and
four sons, William, Robert Grieve, Thomas and John; also
one daughter, Jemina Scott. Another son was born during
the voyage out and appropriately received the Christian
names, Peter Brown Palmyra, after the Captain and the
ship.
On arrival at Port Phillip, John Armstrong, who had
brought some stock out with him, took up Bush Station,
also known as the River Station, which included the site of
the present city of Geelong, and it is said that the homestead
was situated where Geelong College now stands. T he
original station extended as far as Barwon Heads and
Torquay.
John Armstrong had come from a family that had been
engaged in sheep farming in Scotland for generations, and
was therefore well fitted for the pioneering work which lay
ahead of him. He was for many years recognised as the
best informed sheep master in Victoria and was the first to
adopt the well known remedy of dipping sheep to cure
scab and all insect pests.
When the town of Geelong took shape, portion of the
rights of the Bush run were cancelled, but John Armstrong,
in 1850, obtained further grazing rights at Black Forest,
formerly Werribee Plains. He also held Allanvale or
Sinclair’s Station, 80,000 acres, near Great Western,
1854-57, and when gold was discovered in the latter year,
had about 30,000 sheep being shepherded in the vicinity of
the diggings. Several Highland families which John Arm-
strong had brought out from Scotland were working for him
on Allanvale, and despite the lure of the goldfields, re-
mained loyal to their employer and did their utmost to
prevent the dispersal of his flocks by the diggers, but it was
a hopeless task, the flocks having finally to be moved further
out. John Armstrong was also in partnership with Silas
Harding in Linlithgow Plains Station, near Dunkeld, about
1853. This station was 44,256 acres in extent, and part of
it was afterwards known as Devon Park.
John Armstrong was a man of outstanding personality
and high principle, his work was crowned with success, and
he became one of the most outstanding pioneer sheep
breeders and wool growers in Victoria. He took a keen
interest in Church matters, and was one of the small band
of men who founded the first Presbyterian Church in
Geelong, and also one of the original trustees of Scotch
College, Melbourne.
He married, in Scotland, 27th February, 1829, Vair Scott,
a connection of Sir Walter Scott, the great Scottish novelist.
She died at Geelong, 13th June, 1877, aet. 68. John
Armstrong died in 1857, having had issue ten sons and
three daughters, of whom we now treat.
The eldest son:
WILLIAM ARMSTRONG, was born at Moffat, Rox-
burghshire, Scotland, 4th December, 1829. He arrived in
Port Phillip with his parents in 1839, and gained pastoral
experience on the various stations held by his father, and in
1851 purchased Hexham Park Station, portion of which is
still held by William Armstrong’s son, Walter James
Thomas Armstrong.
He also leased North Station, owned Bushy Park and
Pirron Yalloak, and had considerable pastoral interests in
Queensland. He was one of the most prominent wool
growers in the Western District of Victoria and for many
years headed the prize list at the shows for long wools.
He was President of the Australian Sheepbreeders'
Association in 1885, President for some time of the Hexham
Sheep Show, which flourished in the early days; one of the

appointed manager of a large cattle station near Burketown,
Peter Brown Palmyra Armstrong.
Queensland. He was a wonderful bushman and, as
bushman guide, joined the John G. Mac Donald explora-
tion party to the Gulf of Carpentaria. We hnd in Mr.
MacDonald’s Journal, written in 1865, the following
references: —
"Sept. 17, 1864. —Camp 17, situate on right bank of
Flinders River. . . . Proceeded and at 10 a.m.
made seven miles over fine rich plains. At 10.10 crossed
a water-course, which I called Armstrong s Creek, after
Mr. P. Armstrong, late of Geelong, and now of Queens-
land.''
"Oct. 23 to Nov. 13. —Mr. P. Armstrong, who, accom-
panied by Charlie and Bobby (black boys), had been sent
out to improve upon the track for drays over McKinlay’s
Range, distant from here thirty miles, has returned."
In 1870 flood destroyed all the cattle on the station near
Burketown, and Peter Brown Palmyra Armstrong went to
Cloncurry, when gold was discovered; his son, Peter Brown,
was claimed to be the first white child born there. He then
took up overlanding of cattle to the Gulf country, but
finally settled down and took up a property called The
Reefs, near Normanton, Queensland, and there spent the
remainder of his life.
Peter Brown Palmyra Armstrong married Christina
Harvey Hutton (deed.), whose parents came from Scot-
land.

malaria contracted while opening up new country in the

The fifth son:—
MONCKTON SYNNOT, of Terrick Terrick Station,
Victoria, was born at Ballintate, co. Armagh, Ireland, 30th
November, 1826, and arrived in Van Diemen’s Land with
his parents in 1836. Against his father’s wishes, at an
early age he evinced a desire to go to sea. His father,
however, allowed him to take a voyage to London "before
the mast,” which effectually damped his ardour for a sea-
faring career, and on his return to Van Diemen’s Land, he
accompanied his brother, Albert, to Port Phillip, arriving in
Monckton Synnot, of Terrick Terrick.
August, 1838. They brought sheep with them and pastured
their flocks on the Little River. When gold was discovered
in California he and his brother, Albert, sold out their
interests and went to the Californian goldfields, their com-
panions being James Bell, Captain Holt and W. Lock.
There is no record of how they succeeded, but they
returned to Port Phillip, and after a brief visit to the
Victorian diggings, resumed pastoral pursuits. In 1852,
Monckton Synnot acquired Station Peak run from his
brother, Albert, sold it in the same year to Mr. ). Von
Stieglitz, and purchased Mowyong, afterwards known as
Bareacres, in December, 1852, a run on Little River, of
26,225 acres; this he held until 1859, when it was sub-
divided and sold to Andrew Chirnside and E. McWhirter.
In 1863 he took over South Brighton Station, near Hor-
sham, from the Darlots, and held it until 1867, and in the
following year purchased Terrick Terrick No. 2 Station,
51,200 acres, between Pyramid and Mount Hope Creeks,


\
and Tcrrick Terrick Plains, 65,000 acres adjoining, from
Mr. ]ohn Pearson Rowe, which he held until the early
seventies, when he sold it to C. B. fisher. He was also a
member of the partnership of Synnot Brothers in (.owl
Cowl and Gunbar Stations in Riverina, carrying 200,000
sheep.
In the early seventies, after selling Terrick derrick
Station, he moved to Melbourne and purchased William de
Graves' Flour Mills and stores, which at that time occupied
an acre of ground between Flinders Lane and flinders
Street, on portion of which The Mutual Store now stands.
He leased the flour mills to Robert Harper and Company
and converted one of the buildings into a wool store,
establishing a wool broking business, which he carried on
until his death. He was a pioneer of the Australian wool
trade in the East, being one of, if not the first, in the wool
trade, to recognise the great market for Australian wool in
that part of the world. In a letter to the press in 1878 he
stated: "The great mass of the world’s population dwell
in Asia and it is my firm belief that among the Asiatics
we must seek for a new market for our great staple." This
letter was written at the time of the visit of the Japanese
Trade Commissioners to Australia. Previous to this he had
visited China and spent both time and money in trying to
educate the Chinese in the use of wool.
He married Annie Emily Wedge, only child of Robert
Lawrence, of Formosa, Tasmania, granddaughter of E.
Davey Wedge, and niece of the Wedge brothers, John
Helder, Charles Richard, and Henry, Tasmanian and Vic-
torian pioneers. Both her parents died shortly after she
was born and she was brought up by her grandfather,

lineage
The Synnot family is a very old one, descended from
Hugh, Marquis de Lusignan, a Norman Baron of Brittanny,
from whom they have inherited their coat-of-arms, he.,
the three swans. The most famous member of the de
Lusignan family was Guy, who, during the Wars of the
Crusades, became King of Jerusalem.
The first member of the family came to England with
the Normans. One of the earliest records is of Sir Richard
de Synagh (circa 1172), who settled in Pembrokeshire on
the North West coast of Wales, from where he joined the
first expedition to Ireland in 1169 with Robert FitzStephen,
and became possessed of lands in co. Wexford. The
Synnots were amongst the most eminent of the gentry of
the baronies of Forth and Bargy in that country, and they
had considerable property of importance in other baronies.
It is said that the baronies of Forth and Bargy were peopled
exclusively from England.
Like other ancient names, that of this family has been
variously spelled and in the most ancient records it is
Synagh and Synaght. In modern times it has been chiefly
confined to Sinnot, Synot, Synnott and Synnot.
In A.D. 1390, David Synagh appears as a tenant in
chief of the Crown, and his son, John, was father of
William and Nicholas Synagh, which last was appointed
Chief Sergeant of the co. of Wexford by letters Patent
dated 25th June, 1375 (49th Edward III). Philip Synagh
possessed considerable property in the co. of Wexford in
1350 (30th Edward III), as appears by the Great Roll of
the Pipe of that year.
John Synot was possessed of the lands Clayheed in that
county in 1 375.
John Synath Eitz Michael was summoned among the
King’s chief tenants of Wexford to attend the Lord
Justiciary of Ireland in 1345 with horse and arms. The
different branches of the Synnot family were settled at
Bailybrennan, Ballyfernick, Lingstown, Dyrry, Ballytram-
mon, Ballygarry, Rahins (now the estate of Solomon
Richards, Esq.), Ballynamona, Ballytrant, Farrelstown and
Ballyhoran, and many other estates.
Colonel David Sinnot was a brave officer, and Governor
of Wexford when that town was beseiged by Cromwell,
14th October, 1649, and defended it gallantly, but Captain
James Stafford, who commanded in the castle, surrendered
it to the usurper. It is supposed that the Colonel lost his
life, as he was never afterwards heard of. His son, Timothy
( lobias) was living in Londonderry and was there during
the celebrated seige of that city. He was rescued and
brought up by a Protestant friend and his descendants have
remained Protestants to this day. (The Roman Catholic
branches of the family still spell their name Sinnott).

||£.: J i„ A
Pearson of Kilmany Park
WILLIAM PEARSON was born at Hilton,
parish of Kilmany, Fifeshtre, Scotland, 20th
September, 1818, and educated at Edinburgh High
School. Inheriting the family love for the sea, he wished
to take up seafaring as a profession, but his father, himself
an ex-Royal Navy Officer, was opposed to this, and with the
idea of creating a feeling of distaste for the sea, sent his son
on a voyage in an American timber ship. The experiment
The following extract from a narrative supplied by
William Pearson describes his early days in Port Phillip:
" Started for Gippsland in June, 1841. Went up to
the Murray where Albury now is. Followed up the
Mitta-Mitta, crossing and re-crossing. Got up to the top
of Mt. Gibbo. Saw Omeo and made for it. Stayed some
time and started with cattle, accompanied by the late
James Rintoul, of Rosedale, Malcolm Macfarlane, of
William Pearson, of Kilmany Park.
was not successful, as young Pearson ran away from the
ship and took service on an East Indiaman, ultimately be-
coming third officer. After his father’s death, he gave up
the sea and decided to take up pastoral pursuits in Fort
Phillip, of which good accounts had arrived in the old
country.
He sailed from Greenock for Australia in the ship
'John Cooper,” in September, 1840. The voyage was full
of incident, the ship being dismasted between Greenock and
Cork. She was thrown on her beam ends and dismasted off
Lisbon, where she put in for repairs, which took six weeks
to complete. She was again dismasted off the Line, and again
off the Cape of Good Hope. The "John Cooper'" arrived
at Adelaide early in 1841, the voyage having taken seven
months, and William Pearson overlanded to Port Phillip.
Glenmaggie, Mclnnes, McKellar and another—l forget
his name. First thought of taking up Lindenow, but
having no provisions and living on slink, alias young
calves, moved on. Malcolm Macfarlane took up Hey-
ffeld and I took up Kilmany Park. This was in Sep-
tember, 1841.
" Angus McMillan and his party were then the only-
others in North Gippsland. The late John Campbell, of
Glencoe, was then at Port Albert, keeping a store, and
a few others had come down in a vessel, the "Singapore,"
I think, from Melbourne.
" Macfarlane and I had our cattle at Lindenow. We
started on an exploratory expedition to look out for new
country. Got on to Mewburn Park; went up to Glen-
maggic. In swimming our horses across the Thomson at


the bottom of the ranges, my horse capsized with me in
the river. Lost my gun, which remained in the river
upwards of twelve months. Came on down to Heyfield,
which Macfarlane made up his mind to occupy; came
on to Kilmany Park, which I made up my mind to
occupy. Returned to Lindenow and brought our stock
down.
"If it had not been for the kindness Macfarlane and I
received from Angus McMillan, in the shape of supply-
ing us with provisions, etc., I do not know what we
would have done.
"The blacks were very troublesome and dangerous,
having killed several white people."
William Pearson was best known as one of the original
pioneers of Gippsland, and Kilmany Park became one of
the best known pastoral estates in Victoria. When William
Pearson took up Kilmany Park, adjoining Sale, in 1841, it
was a property of 12,800 acres, and this he stocked with
cattle. He had previously taken up a run in the northern
part of Gippsland, but soon abandoned it. Kilmany Park
was first taken out in the name of William Pearson's
mother, Helen Pearson, of Edinburgh, but it was trans-
ferred to him in 1848.
Other stations held by him were Maryville, 22,900 acres,
1872-76; Hill End, 23,040 acres, which he held for a brief
period in partnership with Hugh Reoch; Tangel Hills,
15,360 acres, in partnership with Hugh Reoch and F.
Brodribb, 1848-51; and Grass Hill, 15,360 acres, with the
same partners, for a similar period. All these stations were
situated in Gippsland, and devoted to cattle raising.
William Pearson did not, however, confine his atten-
tion exclusively to pastoral pursuits, but was interested in
gold mining, being one of the largest shareholders in the
Long Tunnel mine at Walhalla.
On the turf, he was a well known figure for nearly
fifty years, and up to the time of his death, probably won
a greater number of races than any other man in Aus-
tralia. The best horse he owned was "Commotion," who
was recognised as the "Carbine” of his day. Among the
classic races won by Mr. Pearson's horses were the New-
market Handicap, the St. Leger, and the Grand National
Steeplechase. He was a member of the V.R.C. Committee
for many years.
While still a comparatively young man, William Pearson
entered the political arena in 1864, and was elected for the
North Gippsland constituency in the Legislative Assembly,
holding the seat until he retired prior to the adoption of
the system of payment of members. He later, in 1881,
entered the Legislative Council as one of the members for
Gippsland, and retained the seat until his death.
He married, 4th August, 1859, Eliza Laura, daughter ot
H. J. Travers, formerly of the East India Company s Service.
She died at "Craigellachie,” St. Kilda, Melbourne, in 1896.
The Hon. William Pearson died at his residence, "Craig-
ellachie,” St. Kilda, 10th August, 1893, having had issue,
five sons and two daughters, of whom we now treat.
The eldest son: —
HUGH PEARSON, was born at Kilmany Park Estate,
22nd June, 1860, and died 27th November, 1874.

WILLIAM PEARSON, was born at "Craigellachie,” St.
Kilda, 25th June, 1864, and educated at Geelong C. of E.
Grammar School, after which he travelled abroad for two
years with the late Bishop Green. He took up pastoral
pursuits under his father on Kilmany Park, and later was
the owner of Bonegilla Station, near Wodonga; this property
he held until his succession to the Kilmany Park Estate,
where he resided until his death.
He took an active part in the public life of Gippsland
and was for some years a member of the Sale Borough
Council and the Rosedale Shire Council. He took a keen
interest in the North Gippsland Agricultural Society, of
which he was at one time President. Like his father, he
was a well known patron of the turf, and was President
of the Sale Turf Club. He entered politics in 1896, being
elected to the Legislative Council for the same Province
which his father had represented, and remained a member
of the Council until 1916. He was a prominent Anglican
and was for many years chairman of committees of the
Synod.
Mr. Pearson had the honour of entertaining the Duke of
Cornwall and York (later King George V) at Kilmany
Park during his visit to Victoria in 1901.
He married, 2nd July, 1887, Sophie Emily (died 1923),

Hmeage
The old Scottish family of Person of Lochlands, Pierson
of the barony of Balmadies, Forfarshire, and Pearson of
the barony of Kippenross, Dunblane, Perthshire, of which
the Hon. William Pearson was head, appears under various
spellings in some of the earliest official records of Scotland.
This family is described as then "ancient," in 1684, by
John Ochterlony, of The Guynd, in his Account of the
Shire of Forfar."
In the Ragman Roll—the sealed instrument of fealty
subscribed by the representatives of Scotland to Edward 1,
of England, in his office as arbitrator between Bruce and
Balliol —Wautier Pieressone (del Counte de Berewyk) signs
as landowner in Berwickshire, 28th August, 1296. In a
safe conduct granted by Edward 111, of England, signed by
the king at Westminster, 11th June, 1369, David Perisone,
"mercator de Scotia,” is permitted to pass through England,
"cum quatuor sociis equitibus.” Six others, named in the
same document, have passes for two mounted companions
each. The safe conduct provides against the export of bows
and arrows to the prejudice of England. From 1372 to
1390, David Perisone, and his brothers, Alexander and
John, were comptrollers of the customs of North Berwick,
Dumfries, and Haddington,
In the Close Rolls, 20 Ric. 11, 27th June, 1396, "The
King (Richard II) commands his cousin, Henry Percy,
Earl of Northumberland, to order the release of the Scots
merchants and their goods, lately wrecked in a ship of
Henry Pierson’s, on the coast of Werkworth, last Lent, and
said to be in his (the earl's) custody, that the truce be not
broken.”
In 1425, the head of the family, John de Perisson, was
burgess of Linlithgow, and servitor (generosus) to the king,
James I, of Scotland. A payment out of the customs of
Linlithgow is ordered to him "by the king's ring, to the
auditors.” In 1450, his eldest son, Thomas, held lands at
Blackness, Eister Liff, Forfarshire, at whose death, in 1466,
sasine of these lands (which now form part of the west end
of Dundee) was granted to his two daughters, Mariota
and Sybilla Persoun.
Henry, brother of John de Perisson, was bailie of Lin-
lithgow, 1434. His son, Thomas Peresone, was one of the
clerks of the Chapel Royal, Edinburgh, 1467. John Person
was procurator for the Abbot of Culross in 1489 in all
places pertaining to that Abbey, in the burgh of Dunferm-
line, and Sir Andro Pierson was one of the monks of the
Abbey of Dunfermline at that date (see Ross s Old Dun-
fermline”) .
In 1506, the nephew of Thomas Peirson, of Blackness,
servitor (armiger) to George (Hepburn), "Abbas de
Arbroath," had a charter of "ly Rude with pertinents in ly
Almory de Arbroath. The chartulary of the abbey contains
several charters, granting lands to Thomas Peirson and his
successors. A grant was made, Ist June, 1506, to Thomas
Pierson, "et Mariote, Sponse sue Moderne” (present or
second wife), "dimidiam tercie partis ville nostre de
Southterre.” Thomas Peirson married, as his second wife,
his cousin, Mariota, daughter and co-heiress (with her
sister, Sybilla) of Thomas of Blackness. Thomas and
Mariota Persoun, on the 13th October, 1508, obtained a
grant of lands at Kepty (now part of Arbroath, on which
the railway station is placed), Arbroath, which, with the
other grants, formed the nucleus of the future property of
Lochlands. Thomas Peirsone, m. thirdly, Margareta Schort
(who survived her husband, and afterwards m. Andrew
Christeson, who also held land from the Abbey of Arb-
roath), and, dying before 1524, left issue five sons. The

v < \
Hay of Boomanoomana
WILLIAM HAY of Boomanoomana Station, was
one of the most remarkable figures in the early
history of the Colony. He was born in Banff,
Scotland, in 1816, and was in early life attracted to the
Ministry. He commenced his studies at the University of
Aberdeen, where he took Degrees with Honours in (.lassies
in 1834, and in Chemistry and Natural Sciences in 1836.
private academy for boys in 1 asmania, which he conducted
with success for some years.
Within a year or two, Mr. Hay became convinced that
there were vast possibilities in the raising of sheep and
cattle, and the insight and enterprise which characterised
the whole of his life were strikingly displayed when he
decided to give up academic life and embark on what was
William Hay, of Boomanoomana.
Having heard glowing accounts of the prospects in Aus-
tralia, he decided to abandon his plans for a clerical career
and embarked on a sailing ship, which arrived in Sydney
in 1838. Some months later he left Sydney and proceeded
to Tasmania.
Men of the scholastic attainments of Mr. Hay were very
rare in the Colony at that time, and seeing the need that
existed for the higher education of the sons of the leading
residents there, he founded what is reputed to be the first
to him the entirely new life of a pastoralist. In 1846 he
and his wife and baby crossed over to Melbourne in "The
Shamrock,” and proceeded to Dropmore Station, where he
applied himself to acquiring a knowledge of station manage-
ment.
In 1851, his pastoral life may be said to have begun
when he became the owner of Glenlyon Station, situated to
the east of Seymour, Victoria. It was rough, hilly country,
and not very promising from a squatter’s point of view. At


that time hi red labour was almost unprocurable, as nearly
every able-bodied man was "off to the diggings.” Nothing
daunted, however, and ably assisted by his wife, he faced
the situation, shepherded his own sheep by day and taught
his sons the Latin grammar and Euclid by night. The
following story belongs to this period of his life, and serves
as an illustration of his adaptability to circumstances. He
disliked the old cumbrous lever press for packing wool, and
resolved to have a screw press. Money was scarce, and he
could not buy one, so he started out with one assistant, cut
down a very large red gum tree, hewed therefrom a sound
piece of timber about twelve feet long, improvised a turning
lathe, and produced a screw of about six inches diameter, by
means of which he pressed his wool for some three years.
Having in three years cleared all the purchase money off
Glenlyon, he sold out to the late Gideon Stewart, of Habbies
Howe, and after a short residence in St. Kilda, about the
year 1838 took his family home to Scotland for educational
purposes. Mainly owing to the rigour of the climate
proving too severe for a member of his family, but also
partly from "the call of the wild,” he returned to Aus-
tralia in 1860, and acquired Pine Lodge Station on the
Broken River. Here his pioneering work had practically to
be repeated, as the place was unfenced and unimproved.
His first work was to get rid as far as he could of the
shepherds and let his sheep run at large. (It should be
mentioned that he also did this when he first went to the
Glenlyon property). He was too impatient to wait for the
completion of his fences and kept men walking the boun-
daries and following up and returning stragglers to their
own property.
William Hay sold out from Pine Lodge about 1862,
and after residing for a year or two in Kew, near Melbourne,
to educate his sons, he bought the Boomanoomana Station,
on the New South Wales side of the Murray, nearly mid-
way between Albury and Echuca. It was, at the time, a
cattle station, over 100,000 acres in extent, including Mount
Gwynne and extending right up to the Mulwala boundary,
while it stretched west from Barooga to Mulwala Station
and nearly to Nangunia. The extent of this great property
may be gathered from the fact that 70,000 sheep were
shorn on it in one year alone. He hastened to get rid of
the cattle and replace them with sheep, which he purchased
from the late Harry O’Brien, of Douro Station, Yass, New
South Wales, the Osbornes of Momalong, and from Illil-
lawa, near Hay. The drought period of 1865-68 followed,
and sheep fell in price to such an extent that they could
hardly be given away. He, in common with others, felt the
depressed time acutely, but wasting nothing in extravagances,
was able to weather the storm.
Boomanoomana was in those days a box forest run, and
Mr, Hay was amongst the first to conceive the idea of ring-
barking. This action on Boomanoomana was practically the
saving of the situation, and enabled him later on to buy the
freehold of the greater portion. The station was little im-
proved when Mr. Hay took it, being unfenced, except for a
cattle fence on the boundaries.
It was about this period that he began to work hard for
the local Agricultural and Pastoral Society. A show was
held at Corowa in 1868 and 1869, but seeing that the
position was nor sufficiently central, Mr. Hay, with the help
of Robert Lowes, of Corowa, as Secretary, moved the whole
affair to Jerilderie, where the first show under the new
regime was held in 1870. At that time, Jerilderie was but a
small hamlet, and lacking in accommodation for a large
influx of visitors. To make sure of some sort of house-
room, he provided tents, etc.; he also dispensed abundant
hospitality during the two or three days of the show week.
Amongst others who were to the front on this occasion may
be mentioned George Peppin, John James, J. M. Sanger,
Alexander Sloane, P. McFarland, A. N. Gilbert, Irving
Winter, and his nephew, W. Thompson, his two sons, and
others whose names cannot be recalled.
In 1873, he bought Collendina Station, some thirty miles
further up the Murray.
In the middle seventies, Mr. Hay was elected member for
the Murray in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly
and was instrumental in getting the Bill for the construction
of the Deniliquin and Moama railway carried. He refused a
nomination for the Upper House, as the vacating of his seat
in the Lower House at that time would, he thought, have
been detrimental to the interests of his Constituency.
Mr. Hay’s active pastoral life ended in 1886. His two
sons, Alfred and Henry, had been carrying on the manage-
ment of the stations in partnership with their father, and in
that year the partnership was - dissolved. Boomanoomana
was given to Alfred, and Collendina to Henry.
Mr. Hay (who was then seventy years of age) and his
wife settled at "Wyuna,” their house in Brighton, Mel-
bourne, where he continued for nearly twenty-three years to
live an active life, both physically and intellectually. His
wife predeceased him in 1894, just fifty years after their
marriage.
His judgment and integrity were so well esteemed that
several times during his life he was called upon to act as
Arbitrator in disputes between pastoralists, who preferred to
abide by his decision instead of having recourse to the Law
Courts. One of these cases lasted over a fortnight.


Prominent in many spheres of life, he was one of the
first members of the Australian Club (Melbourne), and was
several times President.
He was a man of deep reading, free from display and
pretension, and his friends were of all classes and con-
ditions. His marvellous faculties were maintained to the
end. Indeed, the years of his retirement enabled him to
devote undivided attention to the wide range of his intellec-
tual interests, and his brilliance as a conversationalist was a
great attraction to all.
He always maintained a great attachment to his native
town of Banff, and several times paid visits to his relatives
who lived there. On one of these occasions he built a parish
hall there, which is called the Hay Memorial Hall. He was
very proud of his early association with the Aberdeen
University, which was the recipient of many gifts from him
during his long lifetime.
He married at St. Luke’s Church, Campbell Town, Tas-
mania, 4th November, 1844, Jane, daughter of William
Joseph Ruffy (who had been a publisher in England before
settling in Tasmania), and his wife, Matilda Ann (nee
Kingham).
William Hay died in Melbourne, 14th September, 1908,
ret. 92, and was buried in the Brighton Cemetery, having
had issue, two sons, of whom we now treat.
The elder son: —
ALFRED HAY, was born at Campbell Town, Tasmania,
10th January, 1846, shortly before his parents moved to
Dropmore Station, near Seymour, Victoria, where he spent
his early years. As there were no schools near the property,
both he and his younger brother, Henry, received their
early education under the able tuition of their father. In
1858, he accompanied his parents to Scotland and was
enrolled as a pupil of rhe Edinburgh Academy, and upon
his return to Australia in 1860 he completed his studies at
the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School. After
leaving school, he became associated in partnership with his
father and brother in the management of their station
properties. Upon the retirement of his father in 1886, he
became sole owner of Boomanoomana Station, situated on
the River Murray, in Southern Riverina, and having at that
time an area of about 33,000 acres of freehold and about
5,000 acres of Crown leasehold.
Alfred Hay was remarkably successful in the conduct of
Boomanoomana, being noted as a breeder of sheep and
cattle. His shorthorn cattle took many prizes at the district
show. Sheep, of course, held pride of place on the station,
and its wool clips were always of a very high standard. He
was one of the first pastoralists in the Riverina to instal
shearing machines, and to enclose his property with wire
netting. A man of powerful physique, he was proud of his
own ability with the shearing blades, his best tally when in
his prime being an average of one hundred and eighty sheep
a day.
One example of his enterprise, which was widely noted
at the time, was the installation in 1902 (when signs of
drought became ominous) of an irrigation plant, by which
at first about one hundred acres of land were irrigated from
the River Murray. This area, which was subsequently in-
creased to seven hundred acres, was promptly sown with
Alfred Hay, of Boomanoomana.
maize, sorghum and lucerne, and enabled him to withstand
the disastrous period of drought which ensued, by ensuring
ample supplies of feed and water for his stock. He also was
able to supply water from this plant to adjacent farmers. In
the drought of 1914 the plant was considerably extended.
Alfred Hay was one of the foundation members of the
Royal Melbourne Golf Club, and in the early nineties laid
out a course of eighteen holes on Boomanoomana, which
was one of the first of its kind in the Riverina. He was a
member of the Australian and Athenaeum Clubs, Mel-
bourne.
He married firstly in 1877, Mrs. Annie Dufrayer, the
eldest daughter of Ewen McPherson, of Benduck Station,
Hay; she died in 1893. He married secondly in 1900, Cecil
Frances, daughter of Casimir Francis Rowe, whose father,
Dr. John Pearson Rowe, was one of the best known early
station owners in Victoria, while her mother was a daughter
of Richard Davis Ireland, Q.C., one of the leaders of the
Victorian Bar in the latter part of the last century.
Alfred Hay died at Armadale, Melbourne, 30th January,

of 10,000 acres, which had yielded up to 200,000 bushels
in the year succeeding the 1914 drought. Conservation of
fodder in the form of ensilage was an integral part of the
station economy, and adverse seasons could be met with a
feeling of confidence from the knowledge that a supply of
between 3,000 and 4,000 tons of this fodder was always
in reserve.

Guthrie of Rich Abon
THOMAS GUTEJRIE of Rich Avon Station, Vic-
toria, was born at Duns, Berwickshire, Scotland, 25th
April, 1833. One of his brothers, who had been
managing his father s Hobart Town business, paid a visit
to Scotland about 1846 and on his return was accompanied
by his young brother, Thomas. They sailed from London
on 29th August, 1847, in the barque Windermere” (Cap-
tain Ross), 601 tons, the largest vessel then trading to
with similar cargoes, so they decided to dispose of their
cargo in Honolulu.
d homas Guthrie and his brother, David, returned to
Australia, sailing for Newcastle, where they purchased a
cargo of coal, which was despatched to Honolulu in the
Eudora. The brothers, however, remained behind and
took passage in a small brig called the "William Hill,”
bound for Geelong, Victoria, where they remained for a
Thomas Guthrie, of Rich Avon.
Van Diemen's Land, and reached Hobart Town on 16th
December, 1847.
In 1848, Thomas Guthrie commenced his pastoral career
as jackeroo on Glenelg Station, Van Diemen's Land, owned
by William Downie, a well known pastoralist.
In 1849 gold had been discovered in California, and
Thomas Guthrie and his brothers John and David decided
to go there. At this time they owned the barque "Eudora,”
which had been purchased from Messrs. McMicking and
Blackwood, of Melbourne, and loading a cargo of wooden
frame houses, which they considered would find a ready
market in California, they commenced their voyage to San
Trancisco. When they reached Honolulu, they were in-
formed that the harbour at San Francisco was full of ships

week, staying at Mack s Hotel, and then proceeded to
Melbourne. On the return of the "Eudora” from Honolulu
in 1851, the brothers sailed in her for Lyttleton, New Zea-
land, with a cargo of their own Merino sheep, and horses.
When only a few hours from their destination, a gale
sprang up, and the ship was driven up the coast, and with
hatches battened down, they had a trying time attending to
the animals, many of which were lost.
They reached Lyttleton when both that town and Christ-
church were beginning to take shape, and land on the rich
Canterbury Plains, now worth anything up to £2O or £4O
per acre, could have been bought for 5/- per acre. However,
they did not choose to settle there and sold all the stock
they were able to land, and made for Wellington, but


"
struck a terrific gale, and the Eudora was driven ashore
at Poverty Bay. Thomas Guthrie, having no life belt, had
a small keg fastened around his shoulders, and by this
means was saved; he resided for a short period with a Mr.
Grace, a missionary, then stationed among a very fierce
Maori tribe. This tribe later massacred all the whites in the
district, and was afterwards transported to the Chatham
Islands,
From Poverty Bay, New Zealand, the two Guthries pro-
ceeded to Hobart and thence to Melbourne, and 1 homas,
who was still in his teens, established himself as a gold
station business of Synnot and Guthrie. They erected big
stock saleyards on the estate, Drumcondra, on the western
shore of Corio Bay, and held weekly sales. The firm of
Synnot and Guthrie was identified with the commencement
of the Geelong wool sales at the same time as C. J. Dennys,
and with the latter, shared the distinction of being the
founders of the Geelong wool market.
In 1863 Thomas Guthrie acquired Quambatook East and
West Stations, on the Avoca River (these stations were sub-
divisions of Reedy Lake or Bad Bael Station, originally
370,000 acres) and retired from the wool broking business

buyer at Forest Creek and later at the Ballarat gold diggings.
At this time the price of gold was £2/7/6 per ounce, and
despite transport troubles, he carried on the business with
success. At both places he paid £lOO per ton for carriage
on flour from Melbourne, and he had the same experience
of high transport costs in 1882, when he established Avon
Downs Station in the Northern Territory.
After a visit to the old country in 1854, Thomas Guthrie
returned to Australia in the "British Trident in 1855,
landing at Liardet’s Beach, now Port Melbourne, and pro-
ceeded to Geelong, which at that time was booming, as
considerable areas of land which he then bought he sold
fifty years later for less than the price he paid. He built
a substantial stone warehouse in Clare Street, the largest
building at that time in Geelong, and in 1857 assisted
George Synnot to establish the wool broking and stock and
in order to devote his whole attention to his pastoral in-
terests. Later, his brother-in-law, Gideon Rutherford, joined
him in partnership, and improvements were effected until
the properties carried upwards of 64,000 sheep. He also
purchased Rich Avon East Station in 1864, and Rich Avon
West and Avon Plains Stations, near Marnoo, in 1877.
Other properties acquired included Brim Station, twelve
miles north of Warracknabeal; Mount Graham, near Milli-
cent, South Australia; Woakwyne and Avenue Range
Stations, also in the south east of South Australia.
One of the outstanding achievements of this pioneer was
the formation and development of Avon Downs sheep and
cattle station on the Barkly Tableland in the Northern
Territory, consisting of nearly 2,000,000 acres. In 1881
the South Australian Government offered forty-two years'
leases by public auction of blocks of three hundred square


miles each, and 1 homas Guthrie first purchased four blocks,
and later on added further blocks to the purchase, until he
held 2,300 square miles of country, which he named "Avon
Downs, and stocked it with sheep. Development costs
were very heavy, and many doubted whether sheep would
do well in that country, but Thomas Guthrie's judgment
proved right; his foundation stock of 14,500 eventually
increasing to 70,000, and the wool scoured on the station
topped the London market on one occasion.
Two years after acquiring Avon Downs Station he also
introduced cattle; this move proved highly satisfactory in
the end, although the markets were against him in the
beginning. In 1920 he sold 4,443 bullocks and 1,000 cows
to a meat export company in Townsville, probably the
largest single sale of fats ever made from one property
up to that time.
The first telephone line in the Northern Territory, of a
length of forty-seven miles, was erected by Thomas Guthrie,
and he was also largely responsible for the building of the
Camooweal Hospital. It is claimed that he was the first
man in the territory to bore for subterranean water. It is
men of the calibre of Thomas Guthrie who are required
to develop the great Northern Territory of Australia.
In 1874, with his wife and family of three sons and two
daughters, he left Rich Avon Station and took up residence
at The Hermitage, Geelong, and in 1904 purchased "Red-
holme,” South Yarra, where he resided until his death.
Thomas Guthrie married Mary Oliver (nee Rutherford),
who was born at Hunderlea, near Jedburgh, Roxburghshire,
Scotland, widow of John Oliver, of Broadmeadows Station
(afterwards known as Hynam Station), South Australia
(see Oliver family records in this volume). Mrs. Guthrie
was one of the great pioneer women of Australia, and was
well known for her knowledge of pastoral affairs as well as
for her philanthropy. After the death of her first husband,
John Oliver, she, still a comparatively young woman, pur-
chased Morambro Station, in 1857, and later the adjoining
property, Fairview, and for some years successfully managed
these stations, on both of which she improved the country
and the stock.
Thomas Guthrie died at "Redholme,” South Yarra, 18th
October, 1928, and his wife died, also at "Redholme,” 4th
September, 1918. They had issue, three sons and three
daughters, of whom we now neat.
The eldest son; —
THOMAS OLIVER GUTHRIE, was born at Drum-
condra, Geelong, and educated at Geelong College, where
he was in the School Cricket XI for three seasons. He took
up pastoral pursuits under the guidance of his father, and
as a young man was appointed manager and inspector of
the Guthrie stations, his headquarters being at Rich Avon,
the old family home, on the Richardson River, near Donald,
where he still resides on the 6,000 acres which remain after
the subdivision by his father of 23,000 odd acres, and in
1927 he purchased Thermopylae Estate, Willaura. He is a
well known pastoralist and an experienced judge of land
and stock. He is a member of the Council of the Graziers’
Association of Victoria, and the Australian Sheepbreeders’
Association; also a Trustee for many estates. He was a
director of Thomas Guthrie and Sons in the Avon Downs
Pastoral Company.
Thomas Oliver Guthrie married firstly Jessie Blackwood,
second daughter of the late Robert Campbell Hannah, of
Lilydale, Victoria. She died at Rich Avon Station in April,
1902, having had issue:—-

ties. He was rejected for military service, but went to
England and gave several years service to the Australian
Red Cross.
He died at "Redholme,” South Yarra, 25th February,
1932, unmarried.
The third son;—
JAMES PRANCIS GUTHRIE, was born at Rich Avon
Station, in September, 1872, and educated at Geelong Col-
lege. He joined the staff of Messrs. Dalgety and Company
Limited m 1891, and after studying wool in Europe, was
appointed wool expert for the firm in Geelong and New
Zealand, and later became head wool expert for the firm in


Australia. He was afterwards appointed general manager for
the Geelong and sub-branches, which position he held until
Federal Parliament moved to Canberra, when he became
pastoral advisor to the London Board of the Company.
Mr. Guthrie, who has an international reputation as a sheep
and wool expert, for many years compiled Dalgety’s Annual
Wool Review and other publications connected with the
sheep and wool industry, and in 1937 was appointed as the

to rake an active part owing to having lost a leg while in
New Zealand in 1903, he acted for several years as one of
the Expert Advisory Committee to the Government in con-
nection with the purchase of the Australian wool clips by
the British Government, and was a member of the Vic-
torian State Wool Committee. He was one of Victoria s
representatives in the Federal Senate from 1919 until 1937.
Ex-Senator Guthrie always stressed the importance of avia-
tion in Australia, and, from its inception, has supported its
development. He was one of the first passengers in an
aeroplane in Victoria. In 1924, he was selected as one of the
Australian representatives at the Empire Parliamentary As-
sociation Conference, in South Africa, and in 1937 to the
conferences in London and to attend the Coronation, and
in the same year represented Australia at the International
Textile Conference in Paris. He is a member of the Central

Robertson of Mount Mitchell
THOMAS ROBERTSON of Mount Mitchell
Station, Victoria, was born at Mill o’Sterin, Glen-
muick, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in 1785. He received
a sound education, and was engaged in sheep farming at
Glenmuick until 1839, when, in September of that year, he
decided to emigrate to Port Phillip. Accompanied by his
three sons, James, John and Thomas, and his daughter, Jean
pursuits, and, soon after his arrival, he purchased sheep in
Melbourne, and accompanied by his two sons, James and
John, and Dr. Cheyne (a fellow passenger in the "John
Bull”), proceeded to the Benalla district, and there acquired
some land on the Broken River, This venture was the first
and only unsuccessful one in his career in Australia. The
sheep had cost him 32/- a head, and three years later were
Thomas Robertson, of Mount Mitchell.
(his wife had died previously, and his daughter, Margaret,
then married to Captain John Philip, later of Miga Lake
Station, Victoria, remained in Scotland for a few years,
before emigrating to Port Phillip in 1847), he sailed from
London in the "John Bull.” His nephew, James Gordon,
and nieces, Isabella, Annie, Margaret and Mary Gordon,
were passengers on the same vessel, which arrived in Port
Phillip on 21st January, 1840.
Thomas Robertson and his sons having had valuable
experience in sheep breeding on their farm at Glenmuick, it
was natural that he should decide to take up pastoral
worth no more than 2/6 per head, and to aggravate matters,
he found that the country around Benalla was not at that
time suitable for sheep, so he brought his flocks over to the
Western District and settled on Mount Mitchell Station, in
June, 1843, in partnership with his son-in-law, William
Skene, afterwards of Skene, Hamilton, (It is interesting to
note that Thomas Robertson’s great-grandson, James Row-
land Robertson, is now owner of Skene Estate, Hamilton).
Mount Mitchell Station was named after Major Mitchell,
the explorer, who passed through the property in 1836.
This station, also known as Burnbank, had an area of

20,800 acres, with a grazing capacity for 12,000 sheep, and
was situated on McCallum’s and Doctor's Creeks, adjoining
Lexton. The run had first been taken up by Bowerman in
1838 and later acquired by the Livingstone Learmonth
Brothers in 1841, who, in 1843, disposed of it to Thomas
Robertson and William Skene.
Shortly after taking up Mount Mitchell Station, Thomas
Robertson was joined by his son Thomas, who, up to that
time, had remained in Melbourne on the staff of the
"Argus" newspaper. Later his son James, who had been
overseer at Ercildoune, also came to Mount Mitchell Station.
William Skene retired from the partnership in March, 1851,

his interest being acquired by Thomas Robertson, who took
his three sons into partnership and carried on the property
under the name of Thomas Robertson and Sons.
As time went on the partnership acquired the following
additional runs: —Victoria Valley, Miga Lake, Springbank
and East Loddon, adjoining Serpentine.
The partners had their full share of pioneering, in
making Mount Mitchell the splendid pastoral property
which it later became. During the early days of Mount
Mitchell Station, the blacks were very troublesome, and it
was recorded by James Robertson that for three years he
never ventured out without his gun. The first homestead
was situated dose to a creek, and was built of wattle and
daub with a thatched roof. It served its purpose until 1861,
when a new residence built of bluestone quarried on the
station, was erected near the site of the old one.
Thomas Robertson’s main interest outside his pastoral
affairs was the establishment of the Presbyterian Church
at Burnbank, now known as Lexton, and he was a member
of the first Church Committee, formed in 1853 (the other
members being Robert Simpson, Somerville Learmonth and
Thomas Clapperton), when the Geelong Presbytery ap-
pointed the Rev. Alex. Adam to the charges of Burnbank
and Ballarat.
Like most Scotsmen, he was keenly interested in educa-
tion, and laid the foundation stone of the first Common
School at "The Springs,” now Waubra, on 25th September,
1868. He was also a Justice of the Peace.
Margaret Robertson (nee Gordon).
Thomas Robertson married, in Scotland, Annie Lachlan,
and had issue, three sons and two daughters, of whom
presently.
He died at Mount Mitchell Station, Victoria, sth |une,
1872, act. 87.
Of the sons of Thomas and Annie Robertson:
The eldest son: —
JAMES ROBERTSON, was born at Glenmuick, Aber-
deenshire, Scotland, 18th May, 1818. He accompanied his
father to the Broken River, but when that project failed
and the family decided to settle at Mount Mitchell Station,
he took a position as overseer on the Livingstone Lear-
month’s Station, Ercildoune. He was only twenty-five years
of age at this time, but the experience of sheep farming
gained with his father, both in Scotland and on the Broken
River property, fitted him for this responsible position,


which he held for three years before joining his father and
brothers on Mount Mitchell Station. He eventually became
a partner in the pastoral firm of Thomas Robertson and
Sons, owners of Mount Mitchell Station and other proper-
ties already referred to in this record. He was also in
partnership with his brothers, John and Thomas, in the
following pastoral properties: —Moora Moora, Yarram
Yarram, Gazette, Lockhart and Pleasant Banks.
Following the death of his father, both partnerships were
dissolved and the properties divided (this was in 1873),
James Robertson’s share being Mount Mitchell, Lockhart
and Pleasant Banks, the latter property adjoining Rose
Banks Estate, which was purchased by him in 1884; the
two properties combined were then known as Mortat
Station. He also had Kongbool Station, near Balmoral, for
some time.
In public life, James Robertson was a member of the
first Lexton Roads Board (I860), and Chairman of that
body, 1861-64; when the Roads Board was dissolved and
the Shire Council of Lexton took its place, he was elected a
member, holding the seat until his retirement in 1883.
During this period he was President of the Shire of Lexton,
1864-71, and 1876-81. His extensive knowledge of
engineering made him a most valuable member of the
Council.
A staunch Presbyterian, he supported the Church both at
Lexton and Waubra by his interest in its ordinances and his
generosity.
Both James Robertson and his wife experienced many of
the privations and dangers which were the lot of the early
pioneers of Victoria. It is recorded that during the period
when the bushrangers terrorised the district at the time of
the Ballarat gold rush, two of these outlaws held up a
neighbouring station and demanded money and horses, then
proceeded to Ercildoune district and took refuge in the hills.
Mr. Livingstone Learmonth, of Ercildoune, rode over to
Mount Mitchell Station to arrange for assistance in case of
attack, and at the same time advised Mrs. Robertson if she
had any money in the house, to hide it. She had, as a
matter of fact, nearly £ISOO in cash, the proceeds of a
recent sheep sale, and was at a loss to know where to put
the money for safety, but hit upon the idea of secreting it
in a barrel of white sugar. The bushrangers did not pay
their expected call at Mount Mitchell, but one was captured
by Mr. Livingstone Learmonth, Mr. Robertson and the local
constable.
James Robertson was married at Geelong, by the Rev.
Andrew Love, 15th March, 1852, to his cousin, Margaret,
daughter of James and Mary Gordon, of "Altchallich,”
Glenmuick, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. She died at Mount
Mitchell Station, Victoria, 6th April, 1890. He died at
Mount Mitchell Station, 28th May, 1893, having had
issue:—
i. Thomas, b. Mount Mitchell Station, Vic., 25th
Oct., 1857. Ed. Scotch Coll., Melb. Received
pastoral experience on his father’s properties and
on the death of the latter was in partnership with
his brothers in Mount Mitchell, Kongbool and
Mortat stations in Vic., Gundabook Station,
Bourke, and Tooma Station, in N.S.W. The
partnership between the brothers was dissolved in
1911, and Thomas took over the homestead por-
tion of the Mount Mitchell Estate. In addition to
his pastoral interests, Thomas Robertson also gave
his attention to mining, and took a keen interest
in the scientific, as well as the practical side, of
water finding. Many men have reason to thank
him for finding water on their properties in Vic.,
N.S.W. and W.A. He was a Justice of the Peace,
Thomas Robertson
and a member of the Lexton Shire Council, 1895-
1900, and 1909-13, being President two terms.
His many benefactions included the Lexton Pres-
byterian Church and the Ballarat College, to both
of which he subscribed generously. He m. Minnie

then began his pastoral career at Mount Mitchell
Station and assisted in the management of that
station until 1895. He later went to Kongbool,
near Balmoral, another station belonging to the
Robertson Brothers, and when the partnership
was dissolved in 1911, he retained this property
until about 1922, when it was sold for Closer
Settlement purposes. He then purchased Skene
Estate, near Hamilton, now held by his son, James
Rowland. After his lengthy residence at Kong-
bool, the people of Balmoral acknowledged the
esteem in which he was held among them; this
was summed up in the words of the Rev. J. L.
King at the time, who said that, "He (James
Robertson) was the same wise, patient, tolerant,
cheerful guide and counsellor, doing the best for
everybody and believing the best of everybody."
He took an interest in municipal matters, and
while at Mount Mitchell Station, was Councillor


ft
/«•»
of the Shire of Lexton for a period of eight years,
and held office of President for two terms. When
at Kongbool, he took a keen interest in the
Balmoral P. and A. Society and was President of
that body for twenty-five years. Following the
family tradition, he was a loyal supporter of the
Presbyterian Church. He was a well known
patron of the turf, being a leading spirit in the

with his brothers, joined in partnership in Mount
Mitchell, Kongbool and Mortat Stations in Vic.,
and Gundabook and Tooma Stations in N.S.W.
On the dissolution of partnership in 1911, he
took over about 14,000 acres of the Mount
Mitchell Estate, which he named East Mount
Mitchell. After the Great War he disposed of
about 4,800 acres of this estate for Soldier Settle-
ment. He was a member of the Lexton Shire
Council for twenty-live years, 1900-1909, and
1913-29, and held the office of President for
three terms. (Members of the Robertson family
had been on the Lexton Roads Board and Shire
Council for seventy years). He was a Justice of
the Peace. A prominent patron of racing, he was
a member of the Committee of the Ballarat durf
Club, and member of the V.R.C. and V.A. I C.

the Presbyterian Ministers at Lexton, Waubra
and Evansford, and the Church of England
Clergymen at Lexton and Waubra. A good friend
of the returned soldier, lie presented each of those
who enlisted from the Lexton Shire district with

The second son: —
JOHN ROBERTSON, was born at Ballater, Aberdeen-
shire, Scotland, in 1823. He commenced his pastoral career
in Victoria, on the Broken River with his father and brother
James and Dr. Cheyne. Lie then accompanied his father to
Mount Mitchell Station, and later became a partner in the
pastoral firm of Thomas Robertson and Sons, in the stations
already referred to in these records. During this period he
resided on the Victoria Valley Estate. He was also in
partnership with his brothers James and Thomas in Moora
Moora and Yarram Yarram Stations, and after the dissolu-
tion of the partnership in 1873, he took over Victoria
Valley and Gazette properties as his share, later purchasing
Yarram Yarram from his brother Thomas. In 1877, he
purchased Skene Station, near Hamilton, and also acquired
other pastoral properties in the Hamilton district, including
Moyne Falls and Murroa.
He was a keen patron of horse racing in the Western
District, and the owner of a number of thoroughbred
horses, which won many events in the Western District and
also at interstate racing fixtures. In the days when Hamilton
was the centre of coursing, he took a great interest in this
sport.
Of a quiet and unobtrusive nature, John Robertson, out-
side his pastoral activities and the branches of sport already


*»
mentioned, did not take any prominent part in public
affairs. He was one of that enterprising type of Scotsmen
who did so much towards laying the foundations of the
Colony, but who were not demoralized by success or dis-
heartened by failure.
John Robertson married Mary Jane, daughter of Charles
Carter, of Rosebrook, Horsham, Victoria, a pioneer of the
Wimmera District. She died at Skene, Hamilton, 9th July,
1900.
He died at Skene, Hamilton, 17th January, 1905, tet. 82,

Thomas Robertson, of Murroa.
conducted both properties for many years. In
1927 Thomas Robertson handed the main portion
of Moyne Falls over to his son, James Wando
Robertson, and the Murroa property was divided
between his two daughters. He then retired to a
property, "Rockbank," Kirkstall, where he in-
terested himself in a small stud of thoroughbred
horses. He was one of the keenest patrons of
racing in the Western District and was noted for
his love of clean sport. As an amateur rider he
rode many winners for his father over the flat
and cross country events. As an owner, he raced
many good horses, amongst which were "Re-
member,” winner of the Mount Gambier Cup, and
"Ocean Bound,” which won the Warrnambool
Cup in 1930 and the Doutta Galla Hurdle, Melb.
During the Great War, Thomas Robertson was
identified with all local patriotic movements and
presented a bombing plane to the British Air
Force; this machine was named "Murroa.” A
staunch supporter of the Presbyterian Church, he
was particularly generous to the Inland Mission
and the Flying Doctor. He was a member of the
Hamilton P. and A. Society, the Hamilton Racing
Club and one of the founders of the Hamilton
Golf Club. He m. Annie, daughter of the late

New South Wales, converting the former into freehold;
this property eventually comprised 200,000 acres, and here
he resided until his death.
Thomas Robertson was a man of retiring disposition and
took no prominent part in public affairs. He was held in
high esteem by all those with whom he came in contact,
either in business or in private life. It was said of him that
his word was his bond in all business dealings. One of his
many benefactions was the presentation to Geelong Hospital
of the site on which the nurses’ quarters are erected.

Reid of Woodbourne
WILLIAM JAMES REID of Woodbourne,
Meredith, Victoria, was born at his father’s farm.
Illistron, near Letterkenny, North Ireland, 9th
November, 1821, being the eldest of a family of seven sons
and two daughters. When he reached the age of nineteen
years, he decided to settle in Australia, and, accompanied by
his cousin, William Reid, sailed from Ireland on 23rd
March, 1841, by the sailing ship "England" (Captain
Bert Station, which they held for four years. During the
time Mr. Reid was at Woodbourne he had considerable
trouble with scab, which had been introduced into the
Colony with Tasmanian sheep, and caused heavy losses to
sheep breeders for some years. Mr. Reid grew his own
tobacco and found that tobacco dip was an effective cure.
Later, in 1870, he had further trouble at Woodbourne with
"fluke,” for which at that time there was no known cure.
William James Reid, of Woodbourne
Thompson), and landed in Port Phillip on 18th July, 1841.
Having had pastoral experience on his father’s farm in
Ireland, he naturally took up pastoral pursuits in the new
country.
His first Australian station experience was under Mr.
John Armstrong, and he was later employed by the
Livingstone Learmonths at their Boninyong and Ercildoune
properties. When the Learmonths purchased Wycheproof
Station, in 1848, they appointed Mr. Reid manager, and he
carried on the property until 1852, in which year he pur-
chased from Mr. Alex. Wilson, Woodbourne Station, near
Meredith, together with 6,000 sheep.
While at Woodbourne Station, he entered into partner-
ship with his father-in-law, Mr. James Armstrong, in Lal-
This caused heavy losses of sheep at Woodbourne in the
years 1870 and 1871, and was responsible for his selling
the property in 1872 and taking up squatting interests in
New South Wales. He purchased from Edward Henty, of
Portland, the Torowotto Station, a property of 2,000 square
miles of Crown land in New South Wales, one hundred
and twenty miles north of Wilcannia, and renamed the
property Yancannia. This property was unfenced, and the
sheep had to be shepherded. It is interesting to note that
"it was from the Torowotto swamp on this station that
Burke and Wills sent back their first despatches to Menindie,
and left a marked tree, BW ”
1861
Five years after the purchase of Yancannia, Mr. Reid
took in as partner Mr. Thomas Shaw, and the property was


then fenced and improved with artesian bores, eventually
carrying 200,000 sheep, but in the late eighties, rabbits
appeared on the station and reduced its carrying capacity.
The partnership between Mr. Reid and Mr. Shaw was dis-
solved in 1895, the latter purchasing Mr. Reid’s interest.
In 1881, Mr. Reid, with two of his sons, John Illistron
and James Armstrong, purchased Clonagh Station, forty
miles north of Cloncurry, Queensland, together with 4,000
cattle. This property, consisting of unimproved Crown
lands, was 720 square miles in extent, and Mr. Reid and
his sons fenced and improved the property, stocking it
with sheep from New South Wales. Other properties held
by William James Reid during his lifetime were Loddon
Park Station, Victoria; Tilcha Station in South Australia
(in partnership with his son, William Hatrick) ; and Echo
Hills and Miller's Creek, in New South Wales. In 1905
he sold Millers Creek, Echo Hills and Clonagh to Reid
Brothers Limited, a family company, of which he was
chairman of directors prior to his retirement.
Mr. Reid was a prominent member of the Free Presby-
terian Church of Victoria, and an Elder for many years.
He married at Little River, Victoria, in 1853, Elizabeth
Elliott, daughter of James Armstrong, of The Lakes Station,
Mortlake, one of the pioneer pastoralists of Victoria, who
arrived in Melbourne in 1848. Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Reid’s
diamond wedding was celebrated in May, 1913, when
twenty-eight of their children and grandchildren were
present. Elizabeth Elliott Reid (nee Armstrong) died at

tralia, overlanding to Port Phillip, where, in
partnership with )ohn Atkins, he took up land on the
Broken River, near Benalla, in 1840. This property, com-
prising 44,330 acres, was named Kilfera, after the family

Ritchie of Aringa and Boodcarra
JOHN RITCHIE, of Aringa, Port Fairy, Victoria, was
a "son of the manse” and one of a family closely
connected with the Scottish Church, but chose Law as
his vocation and studied in Edinburgh to become a Writer
to the Signet.
His father, the Reverend John Ritchie, for many years
minister of Tarbolton, Ayrshire, married Christina Tweedie
Stoddart, daughter of Mary Tweedie, of Quarter, and David
citizens generally, objected to the terrible innovation
and the little 'chamber’ organ (reputed to have been
built by James Watt) was cast out of the Church.
Treatises were written on the subject, in which it was
pointed out that musical instruments were not employed
by the Christian Church under the Dispensation. To
use them would be contrary to the Directory for the
Public Worship of God which prohibits all devising,
using or anywise approving any religious worship not
instituted by God Himself.
John Ritchie
of Aringa and Boodcarra
Stoddart, of Easton Dunsyre. One of his uncles, Professor
David Ritchie, held the Chair of Logic at Edinburgh Uni-
versity for twenty-eight years, while another uncle, Dr.
William Ritchie, was Professor of Divinity at the same
University, and Minister of St. Giles Cathedral, and it was
he who, against fierce opposition, introduced music into
the Scottish Church. The following is an extract from "The
Scotland of Our Fathers," by E. S. Haldane: —
"One of the first organs to be met with in a Scottish
Presbyterian Church was placed in St. Andrew’s, Glas-
gow, by Dr. William Ritchie in 1807. A small instru-
ment was played for a Sunday or two in the Church
and then such a tumult arose that the whole city of
Glasgow was in a ferment. The Presbytery, and the
Sarah Elizabeth Ritchie
(nee Davis)
"(A Statement of the Proceedings of the Presbytery of
Glasgow, 1808).
' The Lord Provost intimated that Dr. Ritchie would
be responsible for the consequences of a breach of the
peace,’ in case he used his organ. The Presbytery took
the matter up with heat, and a committee appointed by
them reported that to divert so direful a calamity from
our church, to crush in the bud so scandalous a prostitu-
tion of sacred things the Magistrates and City Council
and the Presbytery of Glasgow have in this instance done
their duty with integrity and honour.’
"The unfortunate Dr, Ritchie had travelled in Ger-
many and Holland as tutor to Lord Kintore’s son, and
had evidently imbibed advanced ideas, for there is a
rumour of an eagle as a reading desk, as well as the


hated organ which roused such commotion, and which
(it still exists) is such a little one. He was glad to be
translated to Edinburgh High Church, and shortly after-
wards became a Professor of Theology there.”
With his bachelor uncle, John lived as a law student,
as did also his younger brother, George, who was for forty
years minister of Jedburgh, and in 1870 became Moderator
of the General Assembly.
Owing to a breakdown in health, John Ritchie decided
to abandon law and take up an open air life. Under his
uncle, Mr. John Dudgeon, Factor to Lord Hopetoun, he
studied farming at Almond Hill. On the advice of Lord
Dundas he decided to come to Australia. The following are
extracts from a letter written to him by Lord Dundas on
the eve of departure:—
"As I understand you are about to leave this country
for Van Dieman's Land, it will afford me much satis-
faction if any testimonial that I can give you will be
of the least service to you in that country, but I must at
the same time express my regret that you have resolved
upon quitting my farm of Newbigging, where I am sure
under so good a farmer and tenant as Mr. John Dudgeon,
you must have acquired so general a knowledge of
agriculture, that must with your other acquirements have
made you a very useful member of society in this country,
and cannot fail to be highly beneficial to you in what-
ever country your lot may be cast. The vast number of
cattle that have passed through Mr. Dudgeon’s hands as
a feeder, since your connection with him, must have
given you an insight and knowledge that few have an
opportunity of acquiring. 1 may also add that from your
having been in the Legal Profession your consequent
knowledge of Law must render your services in many
ways useful in a New Colony, when establishment of
laws is so essential to its prosperity. I hope you will not
fail to let me hear from you, as it will give me great
pleasure to hear from yourself of your success and also to
get a faithful account of the state of the Colony, as
perhaps a favourable one may induce me to send thither
one of my sons under your protection.”
In March, 1833, John Ritchie embarked, and subsequently
wrote of
"having enjoyed excellent health during the whole
voyage” and being "as much disposed as ever to enjoy
a laugh, though we experienced some very heavy gales
of wind. A small part of our bulwarks were destroyed.
Excepting shipping occasionally some seas which some-
times drenched us with water in the cabin, we were upon
the whole very comfortable.”
In December, 1833, after a nine months’ voyage, he
arrived in Hobart Town and took up land near South Esk.
During his six years residence there, though in the centre
of a district infested by bushrangers, he was never molested
in any way. At length, on the advice of his friends, the
Henty brothers, he decided to follow them to Port Phillip
and, after a preliminary inspection in October, 1839,
chartered the brig "William,” and with all his possessions,
including 2,000 sheep and two assigned servants, landed in
Portland Bay in January, 1840. He had taken out a squatting
licence (No. 230) on his first visit, and was the second
settler in the Port Fairy district. While making his way
eastwards along the coast, many of his sheep were de-
stroyed by the blacks, who broke their legs and took the
kidney fat. A severe drought had caused the Goose Lagoon
to dry up at Urangaranga (afterwards Aringa). From here
a further movement northwards was made to the Upper
Hopkins, through delightful country, near the present site
of Narrapumelap. However, lack of any but brackish river
water and exceptional drought conditions forced a return
to Aringa. Later, Wyselaskie took up this land and dis-
covered and named a spring which to this day is known as
Ritchie’s spring.
Having returned to Aringa, John Ritchie took up squat-
ting rights over 26,000 acres between the Shaw and the
Moyne Rivers (640 acres at £1 an acre became freehold
with the right to take up leasehold at a low rate according
to the number of stock). At Aringa he designed and built
his first home, which stands today. In 1852, at Werrong-
gurt, Mr. John Cox’s station, he married Sarah Elizabeth
Davis, who died sth May, 1920. The Aringa run, then
heavily timbered, was found to be unsuitable for sheep
owing to the wet conditions. A change was made to cattle,
and after the first gold rush, John Ritchie concluded a deal
with Castella of 1,000 cattle for £lO a head. Later, while
on a journey to Sydney, he broke his knee-cap while dis-
embarking at Twofold Bay; as this precluded riding and
active station management, he leased Aringa, first to Mr.
Robertson, of Struan, for five years at 3 6 per acre per
annum, and later to John and Robert Edols. It was during
their tenancy that Aringa once more became a sheep station.
On February 2nd, 1857, with his wife and small son,
John Ritchie sailed from Australia on the "Anglesea,”
meaning to settle in Scotland, but the climate proved un-
congenial and he returned. A daughter had been born at
Tarbolton, Scotland, and another was born at sea, off the
Cape of Good Hope, on the return voyage. As Aringa was
still leased, Boodcarra, an adjoining property of fifty acres
with a fine stone house on it, was purchased from Mr.
James Knight. Here John Ritchie made his home until
his death in Melbourne on January 6th, 1887.
The following account, taken from an Australian paper,
was published in the "Ayr Advertiser” of February, 1887:
"We regret having to announce the lamented decease
of one of the earliest pioneers of the colony and Western
district in the person of John Ritchie, Snr., J.P., of


Boodcarra, at the ripe old age of 86 years. By a long
course of great industry, strict integrity, prudence and
perseverance, he succeeded in amassing a large amount of
valuable property and has always been regarded as one
of our most successful colonists. In public affairs he
always took a warm interest and for several years held a
seat as Member and President of the Shire of Belfast, the
duties of which he performed with much satisfaction to
his constituents. In private life he was much esteemed, of
a genial disposition, a warm and sincere friend, an
obliging neighbour, a considerate employer of labour,
and an exemplary father and husband. He leaves a
widow and grown-up family and a large circle of friends
throughout the district to lament his loss.”
Ten of John Ritchie's grand-children served in the Great
War, 1914-18, three of whom paid the supreme sacrifice.
John Ritchie had issue four sons and three daughters, of
whom we now treat.
Aringa Homestead.
The eldest son: —
JOHN COX RITCHIE, of Mount Gow Station, Victoria,
was born at Aringa Station, Port Fairy, Victoria, 6th June,
1854, and educated at Melbourne C. of E. Grammar School,
where he was a member of the School four-oared crews of
1871-72. He passed the Civil Service Examination in 1872,
then took up pastoral pursuits at Aringa and Boodcarra
Stations, Port Fairy. Other properties in which he was
interested were a portion of Warrambine, Shelford, which
he renamed Mount Gow; Delatite, Mansfield, in Victoria,
and Cullingral and Old Berrigan Stations in New South
Wales. He was one of the group of pastoralists who, dur-
ing the great shearers’ strike towards the end of the last
century, were active in the formation of the Pastoralists'
Association of Victoria and Southern Riverina. When that
body dissolved in 1906, and separate associations were
formed for Southern Riverina and Victoria, he was elected
President of the Pastoralists’ (later Graziers') Association,
and held this position until 1921. He was appointed a
Trustee of the Association in 1906, and was one of the
growers’ representatives on the Victorian Wool Committee,
being Chairman during the Imperial Wool Purchase project.
for some years before his death he lived in retirement at
Bass Lodge, Flinders, Victoria.
He married Mary Theresa, daughter of Murdoch
MacLeod, of Portree, Skye, second son ot Alexander
MacLeod, surgeon, of Kilpheadar, North Hist. Murdoch
MacLeod came to Tasmania in the early days and married
Malvina, daughter of James Robertson, of Struan House,
Launceston. Murdoch MacLeod was a direct descendant ol
Alexander VII of Raasay and was, by his grandmother, a
descendant of Roderick Mor VIII of Dunvegan. His
ancestors settled in Rigg, Isle of Skye, and were known as
the MacLeods of Rigg. John Cox Ritchie died at Mel-
bourne, 18th June, 1934, having had issue;—

Murray of Borongarook and Wool Wool
THF founders of this branch of the Murray family
were Hugh Murray, of Borongarook, and Andrew
Murray, of Wool Wool, only sons of Hugh Murray,
merchant, of Hobart Town, Van Diemen s Land (see
Lineage).
HUGH MURRAY of Borongarook, Colac, Victoria,
was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in September, 1814, came
out to Van Diemen's Land with his parents in 1823, and
was educated at Dr. Thomson s school in Hobart 1 own.
Hugh Mur ray, of Borongarook.
In 1836 he decided to settle in Port Phillip and the
account of his settlement at Lake Colac and also conditions
prevailing at that time, are best described in the following
extract from a letter written by him to Governor Latrobe,
18th August, 1853: —
"The Colac country was first occupied in September,
1837, by myself accompanied or immediately followed by
Messrs. G. F. and A. Lloyd and William Carter; my
flock consisted of 100 ewes, and theirs jointly of 500,
which we joined together for mutual protection. These
sheep were brought from Van Diemen’s Land, at a cost
of about £3 per head, the price there at that time being
£2.
"We were the only occupants of the country for about
six months, our nearest neighbour being Mr. Thomas
Ricketts, who occupied a station on the River Barwon—
about ten miles distant —at the point where Gellibrand
and Hesse were last seen
"I first heard of the Colac country from a party who
were in search of Gellibrand and Hesse in August, 1837,
under the guidance of Rev. Mr. Naylor, and believe they
were the discoverers of it
"The Colac tribe of natives was not numerous when
we came here —men, women and children not numbering
Elizabeth Murray (nee Young).
more than 35 or 40. From their own account, they
were once numerous and powerful, but from their
possessing a rich hunting country, the Barrabool, Leigh,
Wardy Yalloak and Jancourt tribes surrounding, made
constant war upon them, and the tribe, from having been
the strongest, became the weakest. The extent of their
country was a radius of about 10 miles from Lake Colac
except on the south, where in the extensive Cape Otway
Ranges there was no other tribe.
"We had very little intercourse with them for the first
eighteen months, their demeanour towards us being
always treacherous and dishonest. They never lost an
opportunity of stealing our sheep —at first by night
carrying off a few from the fold, but afterwards became
more daring, and drove off a score or two in the day time


from the shepherd. These they would take to some secure
corner and feast upon them, breaking the legs of those
they did not at once kill, to detain them. In such cases
the settlers assembled and pursued them, and when their
encampment was discovered they generally fled, leaving
behind them their weapons, rugs, etc., which, together
with their huts, were destroyed
After about two years our acquaintance became more
friendly, and they began to be employed upon our
stations.”
Hugh Murray, in 1837, took up Illiminyte or Borongarook
run, and about the same time the Warrion run, on Lake
Corangamite. His brother, Andrew, joined him in partner-
ship, and Wool Wool Station was also acquired by them in
1845 ; the partnership was eventually dissolved, and Andrew
settled on Wool Wool, Hugh retaining Borongarook and
the Warrion. In 1854 Hugh also acquired Gnoora Reet
Forest run, near Colac.
When Hugh Murray first arrived at Colac in 1837, his
residence was a small building where the old Royal Hotel
later stood in Murray Street East, and, in 1851, he built a
residence known as Borongarook House, from timber grown,
and bricks made, on the estate. (Borongarook House was
owned by a member of the family, Hugh Murray's grand-
son, Russell Mervyn Murray, General Manager of Mount
Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited, Tasmania,
until 1938).
He was prominent in public affairs in Colac for many
years, became first president of the Shire in May, 1864, and
laid the foundation stone of the first Shire Hall. He was
first Justice of the Peace for the Colac district, and Murray
Street, Colac, was named after him. He was also one of the
founders of the Presbyterian Church at Colac.
He married, in 1841, Elizabeth (b. Edinburgh, Scotland,
23rd March, 1823; d. Borongarook House, 11th (unc,
1892), daughter of Thomas Young, solicitor, of Hobart,
who came to Van Diemen’s Land from Scotland with his
parents in the ship ’’Portland’’ in September, 1824.
Hugh Murray died at Borongarook House, Colac, 28th
July, 1869, having had issue seven sons and two daughters,
of whom we now treat, and five children who died in
infancy, viz., Russell, Jessie Carfrae, Alice Stodart, Lizzie
and Lillian.
The eldest son,
THOMAS CARMICHAEL MURRAY, was born at
Geelong, Victoria, 7th July, 1842 (the claim was made
that he was the first child to be born "in a house” in
Geelong). He was educated at Beehan's School, Geelong,
and Scotch College, Melbourne, after which he took up
pastoral pursuits at Borongarook.
He joined the expedition to Camden Harbour, north
west Australia, taking with him 500 sheep, and received a
Government grant of land. The venture did not succeed,
and he went to the Roebourne district, where he took up a
large tract of country and commenced sheep breeding; he
also did a lot of exploration work with Mr. Hooley as his
lieutenant. Mount Murray was named after him.
He returned to Victoria a year later and took up Calimi
Station, Deniliquin, New South Wales, which he sold some
years later, and returned to Borongarook. After his father’s
death he leased, and later purchased, Warrion Estate, which
he afterwards sold.
He was a member and president of the Colac Shire
Council. Thomas Carmichael Murray married Miriam
Eleanor, daughter of Jabez and Elizabeth Parker, early
residents of Van Diemen's Land, Jabez Parker being a
British Army officer and father of Langloh Parker and
Frederick Parker, early pastoral pioneers of Riverina.

remained all his life. He was interested in all branches of
sport, being one of the founders of the original Amateur

Youngman
HENRY YOUNGMAN was born at Finchley,
Middlesex, England. Accompanied by his brother,
Edward, he arrived in Sydney by the barque "Port-
land” from Plymouth, England, 11th March, 1841, and the
latter’s signature appears on a petition to the Governor and
Council against the Municipal Bill in May, 1842. The
Youngman brothers established a wholesale druggist busi-
ness in Sydney shortly after their arrival, and the Sydney
services of Frederick Sheppard Grimwade, who arrived in
Victoria in 1863 and took up the position of manager of
the firm.
Two years after the death of his brother, Henry Young-
man, who was greatly affected by the loss of his brother,
decided to dispose of the business, and Frederick Sheppard
Grimwade and Alfred Felton (so well known to Victorians
by his bequest to the Victorian Art Gallery) acquired the
Henry Youngman.
"Morning Herald” of 18th March, 1843, contains an ad-
vertisement announcing that E. Youngman and Company,
Wholesale Druggists, had removed from Regent Terrace,
Hunter Street, to George Street. The business was sold to
Elliott Brothers about 1860. Henry Youngman established
a business in Melbourne as an importer of drugs and
Eastern produce, in partnership with his brother, Edward
(who was lost in the wreck of the "London” on 11th
January, 1865), and a Mr. McCann, the firm being known
as Youngman, McCann and Company. Some time later
Mr. McCann’s interest in the business was acquired by
Henry Youngman and his brother, Edward, and they carried
on under the name of H. and E. Youngman. The firm’s
warehouse was situated at 125 Russell Street.
In 1862 Edward Youngman paid a visit to England in
order to engage a manager for the business, and secured the
business, trading under the name of Felton Grimwade, the
business being carried on down to the present day.
The Youngman brothers also established a wholesale
druggists business in New Zealand about 1863, which was
later purchased by French and Kempthorne, now the well-
known firm of Kempthorne, Prosser and Company.
During the time he was in business in Melbourne, Henry
Youngman was held in high esteem by the mercantile
section of the city. The "Argus,” in an obituary notice at
the time of his death, wrote "The nice sense of honour
which he exhibited in his transactions was very highly
appreciated and won for him the esteem of his friends.”
He married Eliza, daughter of Francis and Eliza Doggett,
of Staten Island, New York, and died at Hobart Town,
Tasmania, 3rd April, 1868, having had issue four sons, of
whom we now treat.


The eldest son:—
HENRY YOUNGMAN, was educated at Melbourne
C. of L. Grammar School, and joined the office staff of
Couche, Calder and Company, Importers, of Melbourne.
Later, as an investor, he speculated largely in land. He
died in June, 1905, aet. 46, unmarried.
The second son:—
EDWARD YOUNGMAN, was born in Melbourne, 7th
June, 1861, and educated at Melbourne C. of E. Grammar
School. He commenced a mercantile career, but as the
result of a serious accident, was compelled to relinquish
commercial life. Recovering after two years, he entered into
partnership with his brother, Charles, in Ardgarten Station,
Casterton, and later Retreat Station, near Casterton. He
died in September, 1928, unmarried.
The third son:—
ARTHUR YOUNGMAN, was born in Melbourne, 26th
December, 1862, and educated at Melbourne C. of E.
Grammar School and Melbourne University. He commenced
the study of medicine, but later decided on a pastoral career,
gaining experience on Rawbelle Station, Upper Burnett,
Queensland, and in 1887 purchased the Taabinga Station,
Kingaroy, Queensland, then a property with an area of 154
square miles, and practically unimproved. Originally a
sheep run, it had been converted into a cattle run, and Mr.
Youngman improved the property and completed the con-
version by the introduction of stud stock and Devon Short-
horn cattle. The annual turnover for a long period averaged
4000/5000 head of cattle. In 1889 he purchased an
additional property of 5305 acres, known as Kingaroy
Paddock, on which the town of Kingaroy is now situated,
and when the township took shape, he donated land for
public buildings and churches.
In public affairs, Mr. Youngman worked quietly and
efficiently for the good of the district. Taabinga Station
is now carried on by the late Mr. Youngman’s widow and
daughters. The establishment of the Kingaroy District
Hospital (a voluntarily controlled institution) was largely
due to his efforts, and he devoted much time to this
institution as a life governor, trustee, committeeman and
several years president. He also presented the Memorial
Park at Kingaroy to the people of the town in memory of
the soldiers who fell in the Great War.
He married Daphne Florence, second daughter of
Kenneth Griffiths Buchannan, of Fairview, Ipswich, Queens-
land.
Arthur Youngman died at Taabinga Homestead, Kinga-
roy, Queensland, 14th October, 1935, having had issue:-
i. Marjorie Florence.
ii. Elizabeth Vyner, ed. Sydney University. She m.
at AH Saints Church of England, 9th Sept., 19.36,
Roderick Gordon Graham, of Brisbane, Qld.
iii. Gwenyth Ethel.
iv. Dorothy Foster, m. at All Saints Church of
England, Brisbane, 28th July, 1938, Peter Ogilvie
Graham, of Toorak, Melb.
v. Margaret Vyner.
The fourth son:—-
CHARLES FREDERICK YOUNGMAN, was born at

Sloane of Sabernake, Mulwala and Moorilla
WILLIAM SLOANE was born at Glasgow,
Scotland, 7th May, 1827, and educated at the
Glasgow High School and Glasgow University. At
School he was dux in all his classes and distinguished him-
self at the University, gaining high honours, especially in
classics. He later decided to settle in Australia with his
brother, Alexander, and came out in the ship "Victory,”
arriving in Melbourne on 19th July, 1849.
Alexander Sloane,
of Savernake, Mulwala and Moorilla.
William Sloane was engaged in mercantile and mining
pursuits until 1860, when he established what was then
known as a squatting agency (which would now be termed
a woolbroking and stock and station agency) under the name
of William Sloane and Company. The firm engaged in
financing wool clips for England and station properties; it
also owned and formed stations, and sugar plantations in
Queensland. Included in their list of managers was Cuth-
bert Fetherstonhaugh, who wrote the well-known book on
outback life, "After Many Days.”
William Sloane was senior partner of the firm for about
twenty years, and several of the commercial leaders in Lon-
don were partners in the concern. In 1877, owing to an
accident which resulted in partial paralysis, he had to
retire from the firm, which later became known as the
Union Mortgage and Agency Company of Australia
Limited. This name was later changed to the Australian
Estates and Mortgage Company, and the firm is now known
as the Australian Estates Company Limited.
After his retirement, he resided with his brother at
Mulwala Station, New South Wales, where he lived for
twenty-two years. He was unmarried, and died at Mulwala
Station, Mulwala, New South Wales, 30th October, 1899.
Annahella Helen Sloane
(nee Gibson).
A LEXANDER SLOANE was born in Glasgow,
Scotland, 29th May, 1829, and educated at Glasgow
High School. When he reached the age of twenty,
he accompanied his brother, William, to Victoria in the
ship "Victory,” which reached Melbourne on 19th July,
1849.
He joined the staff of Dalgety and Company, then, as
now, one of the leading firms in Australia. Two years
after his joining the firm, the gold rush took place, and
practically everyone deserted Melbourne for the diggings.
As this affected business to a great extent, Alexander Sloane,
together with Mr. Dalgety, Junior, went to Forest Creek
goldfield, Castlemaine, and later to Ballarat fields, but after
a short stay there, returned to their positions in Melbourne.
Mr. Dalgety, Senior, the manager of the business, was


absent in England, but Mr. Dalgety, Junior, who was acting
as principal during his father’s absence, decided to go in for
gold buy mg, and appointed Alexander Sloane as the buyer.
1 hey were the first gold buyers in Melbourne, but no one
knew the value of gold as far as buying was concerned, as
there was no way of ascertaining with certainty its true
quality and value. The only set of scales in Melbourne for
gold at that time was at the Bank of Australasia, and Mr.
Sloane took the diggers there to take delivery. He purchased
about 60,000 oz. for the firm. Wdien Mr. Dalgety, Senior,
returned and found what had been done, he was rather
alarmed, but it proved one of the most successful ventures
in which the firm had engaged up till then, and is said to
have yielded a profit of one pound per ounce.
He remained with Dalgety’s until about 1853, when he
paid a visit to the homeland, where he became engaged to
his future wife, Annabella Helen Gibson, whose brothers
he already knew in Australia. On his return to Victoria in
1854, he established a mercantile business in Melbourne,
and a year or two later entered into partnership with his
brother-in-law, Hugh Hamilton Gibson, in Myrnong pas-
toral estate, near Mortlake, after which he had Mount
Shadwell run, also near Mortlake, until 1862. Whilst at
Mortlake, he was for some time a member of the Roads
Board.
In 1862, Alexander Sloane purchased Savernake Station
in Riverina, from John Graham, of "Netherby,” Ruther-
glen, making the journey from Melbourne, with his family,
in an American buggy, the body of which is described as
resembling a tourer motor-car. It took nine days to do the
journey of two hundred and twenty-eight miles; the party
was made up of Alexander Sloane, his wife, three sons, a
daughter, and a nurse for the children.
The Savernake country, when taken up by him, was un-
fenced and scrubby, so sheep had to be shepherded, and
until improvements had been made, trouble was experienced
through the shepherds losing the sheep; the dingoes were
also a source of trouble at this time. The number of sheep
on this station at the beginning was in the vicinity of 5,000,
which was gradually increased as improvements took place.
On the 10th May, 1864, Alexander Sloane purchased
Mulwala Station, New South Wales, together with 7,065
sheep, from the original owner, Mr. Hillas. This station
was also unfenced, and from 1864 until 1870, he passed
through most of the difficulties experienced by pioneers at
this time. Droughts, floods and the depredations of wild
dogs all added to his troubles, and in 1867 a considerable
portion of the Mulwala homestead was washed away by a
great flood in the River Murray, compelling him to move to
the site of the homestead of today. This was built of
Murray pine, grown on the station, and is as sound today
as when it was erected. By fencing and clearing the holding
and giving his attention to the conservation of water,
Mulwala became a valuable and up-to-date pastoral property,
on which was laid the foundation of the Mulwala Stud
flock of Merino sheep, noted throughout Australia. Alexan-
der Sloane purchased Moorilla Station, a property of 10,000
acres, at Young, New South Wales, from the Baker family,
New South Wales pioneers, and in 1905, foreseeing the
coming of Closer Settlement in the Murray Valley, he
subdivided his properties and sold the subdivisions to his
children. The firm of Alexander Sloane and Sons was then
formed, and leased the subdivisions, James, the eldest son,
being appointed General Manager. On the firm ceasing
operations in 1910, the leases were determined, the proper-
ties reverting to the owners.
Alexander Sloane was a Justice of the Peace for Victoria,
Commissioner for taking Affidavits for the Colony of New
South Wales, a life member of the Royal Colonial Institute,
and an early member of the Australian Club. He married,
20th March, 1856, Annabella Helen, daughter of Thomas
Gibson, Banker, of Ayr, Scotland, granddaughter of Peter
Gibson, of Ayr, and sister of Hugh Hamilton Gibson, who
arrived in Victoria in 1847, and James Gibson, who arrived
in 1853.
Alexander Sloane died in Melbourne, 12th October, 1907,
having had issue six sons and five daughters, of whom we
now treat.
The eldest son:—
JAMES SLOANE, of Mulwala Station, Mulwala, New
South Wales, was born at St. Kilda, Melbourne, 14th Jan-
uary, 1857, and received his education at Scotch College,
Melbourne. As a small boy, he made the overland journey
from Melbourne to Savernake. After completing his edu-
cation at Scotch College, he settled with his father at
Mulwala Station, and in 1878 took charge of the Mulwala
Merino Stud, which became his life-work.
When the partnership of Alexander Sloane and Sons
was dissolved in 1910, he took over Mulwala and his share
of the stud flock, admitting his son, Alexander James, into
partnership under the firm name of James Sloane and Son.
He was a recognised authority on Merino sheep, officiating
as a judge at most of the principal shows in the Eastern
States, and had the distinction of being the first single judge
ever appointed. He attended the first Melbourne Sheep
Show, and the firm has had a representative at every show
since.
At the time of his death, he owned Mulwala Station, and
Furnbank Station, near Jerilderie, New South Wales.' He
took an active interest in public matters, being present at
the first Federal Convention presided over by Sir ]ohn
Quick, at Corowa, was an original member of the Corowa
Pastures Protection Board, and a Justice of the Peace,

An expert on pastoral matters, he was also an authority
on aboriginal lore; his collection of aboriginal stone im-
plements, which is one of the finest known in Australia, is
to be presented to the Canberra Museum. He also con-
tributed many valuable articles to the press in this connec-
tion. He was a member of the Australian Club.
He married, 30th October, 1884, Amy Elizabeth, daughter
of the Right Rev. John Dickson Robertson, pioneer Pres-
byterian minister at Yarrawonga, Victoria, and at one time
Moderator of the Victorian Presbyterian Church. She died
at Mulwala, 16th September, 1931.

The second son;—■
THOMAS GIBSON SLOANE, of Moorilla Station,
Young, New South Wales, was born in Melbourne, 20th
April, 1858, and educated at Scotch College, Melbourne.
On completing his studies, he returned to Mulwala Station,
but later went to Sydney, where he formed the firm of Gair,
Sloane and Company, with which he was associated for
some years, until he was appointed manager of Emu Plains,
Urana, and Clear Hills, Junee, two pastoral properties held
by his father under lease. When his father purchased
Moorilla Station, Thomas Gibson Sloane was appointed
manager, and in 1905 acquired the property. He then
became a partner in the pastoral firm of Alexander Sloane
and Company, which leased Moorilla. When that firm was
dissolved, he took over the property, continuing the breed-
ing of Merino Stud sheep, and also engaged in wheat grow-
ing, holding the property up to the time of his death.
He took an active part in public affairs, especially pastoral
matters, and was president of the Grenfell P. and A.
Association and also of the Young P. and A. Association.
As a youth, he became interested in entomology, and
during his stay in Sydney was associated with many well
known naturalists, including Sir William Madeay. Before
he was thirty years of age, he had contributed articles to
the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He became one
of Australia’s outstanding naturalists, and his name was
Thomas Gibson Sloane,
of Moorilla.
familiar to entomologists the world over. A world authority
on beetles, his "Sloane’s Tables of Tribes” was adopted by
the Entomological Society of London as being the most
satisfactory classification in existence. He was one of the
founders of the Field Naturalists' Club of Victoria, and his
paper on "The Faunal Subdivisions of Australia” is recog-
nized as a classic. He studied Australian exploration closely.
After his death, his widow presented his unrivalled col-
lection of beetles to the Council of Scientific and Industrial
Research, and it is now to be found in the Canberra Museum
in the division of Economic Entomology.
He married Eliza Scholastica, daughter of Alfred Wool-
frey, of Dorset, England.

bourne, 19th September, 1865, and educated at West Mel-
bourne. He entered his father's engineering and machinery
business, which,under his guidance,became one of the largest
and soundest of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, and
of which he became Governing Director.
He commenced his public career as a member of the
Hawthorn Municipal Council, and was a Melbourne Har-
bour Trust Commissioner for twelve years; he also served a
term as President of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce.
William Murray McPherson entered the State Parliament
as a member for Hawthorn on sth September, 1913, and
held the seat continuously until his retirement from politics
in 1930. As an illustration of the trust reposed in him by
the electors, he was re-elected on two occasions when absent
from the State and thereby unable to take part in his cam-
paign. William Murray McPherson's business training was
responsible for his rapid rise to Cabinet rank, and he be-
came Treasurer on 29th November, 1917, holding this
Sir William Murray McPherson.
portfolio until 1923; he had the unique experience of pre-
senting six Budgets during his term of office, each disclosing
a surplus.
He also visited London while Treasurer, and was success-
ful in several important transactions on behalf of the State.
He accepted the leadership of the Nationalist State Party in
1927, and in the following year became Premier and
Treasurer; his Ministry was defeated in 1929. The strain of
office had impaired his health, and he resigned his seat in
the Legislative Assembly in August, 1930.
In recognition of his services, William Murray McPherson
was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the
British Empire in 1923. He was one of Victoria's outstand-
ing philanthropists, and among his many charitable actions,
two are particularly outstanding, the Emily McPherson Col-
lege of Domestic Economy, towards which he contributed
£25,000 (the name given to the College was a tribute to
the work of Lady McPherson in connection with domestic
science), and the Community Wing of the Queen Victoria
Hospital for Women and Children, which was made pos-
sible by his gift of £25,000. This wing is now known as


the Jessie McPherson Community Hospital for Women and
Children, in memory of Sir William Murray McPherson's
mother, Jessie Fulton.
Sir William Murray McPherson was a man who earned
a reputation both in business and politics for honesty, in-
tegrity and sanity, and the following extract from a tribute
by one of his political opponents will serve to show the
esteem in which he was held:— His (Sir William McPher-
son’s) private and public life was hall-marked by a high
standard of unostentatious achievements. ... In him,honesty
of purpose was marked in an extraordinary degree, and he
was an outstanding example of a splendid citizen and ser-
vant of the State.”
He was married in St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney, on
19th April, 1892, to Emily (born Sydney, 25th February,
1862,), daughter of William Marshall Jackson, merchant,

Austin of Barwon Park
THOMAS AUSTIN of Barwon Park, Winchelsea,
Victoria, was born at Baltonsborough, Somersetshire,
England, Ist March, 1815. His brothers, Solomon
and Josiah, who, some years before, had emigrated to Tas-
mania to join their uncle, prospered there, and Josiah, in
1830, returned to England to bring out his father, mother,
brothers, James, William and Thomas, and his sister, Anna
(later Mrs. Joseph Gardner Mack, of Berrybank Victoria).
Thomas Austin
of Barwon Park
The family arrived in Tasmania in 1831, and Thomas, then
aged fifteen, joined his brothers, who conducted a stock-
broking business there; he remained with them until 1837,
when, with his brothers, Solomon and Josiah, he came over
to Port Phillip, bringing sheep, and took up land in the
Winchelsea district, part of which land was known as
Barwon Park. Solomon and Josiah shortly afterwards
dropped out of the partnership. Other runs acquired by
Thomas Austin in the Winchelsea and Birregurra districts
were Tooloon and St, Leonards.
Thomas Austin had experience of the first slow but steady
progress of the Colony. His flocks increased and he became
one of the outstanding pioneer pastoralists of the Western
District. He was the first to introduce Lincoln sheep into
Australia, and subsequently carried off valuable prizes at
the well-known Skipton Sheep Shows and at Geelong. He
introduced English game into Victoria, notably partridge,
pheasants, rabbits and hares, and Barwon Park, Winchelsea,
became famous throughout the length and breadth of Aus-
tralia for its game preserves. When His Royal Highness
the Duke of Edinburgh first visited Australia, he was the
guest of Mr. Austin at Barwon Park, and was so impressed
Elizabeth Phillips Austin
(nee Harding)
with the hospitality and sport which he enjoyed there that
he paid a special visit on his return to Australia.
Thomas Austin was one of the first and most notable
breeders of racehorses in Victoria, and imported many
valuable horses from England. The first horse raced by him
was "Latitat,” and he bred and raced such well known
racers as "Bessy Bedlam,” recognised as the best mare of
her day, "Petrel,” another horse of great renown in the
early days, and "Brownlock,” with which he won the fourth
Derby run in Victoria in 1858.
Keenly interested in local matters, he was a member of
the Winchelsea Shire Council for many years, and President
for several terms.


He was married by the Rev. Adam Compton Thompson,
at St. James Church, Melbourne, 14th August, 1845, to
Elizabeth Phillips, daughter of Robert Harding, of Middle
Chinnock, Somersetshire, England, by his wife, Mary Highett.
Mrs. Austin came to Australia with her brother, William
Harding, one of Victoria’s early pioneers, who, with John
Highett, his cousin, took up Mount Hesse Station in 1837.
Mrs. Austin s name is well known throughout Victoria for
her public benefactions, chief among which were the found-
ing of the Austin Hospital for Incurables (now Cancer and
Chronic Diseases) at Heidelberg, Melbourne, and the
Austin Homes at Geelong, Victoria. Elizabeth Phillips
Austin (nee Harding) died at Barwon Park in 1910, and
is buried in Geelong Cemetery.

naming his portion Larundel. He was also in partnership

HENRY JOSEPH LANGDON of Rosecraddock,
Caulfield, Melbourne, was born in London, 14th
October, 1822. He was educated in London and
received his commercial training there, first in the mer-
cantile house of August Faber and Company, of Mark Lane,
and later in a large East India house.
In his thirtieth year, he decided to settle in Australia,
and accompanied by his wife and eldest son, Montague
His business activities were not confined to his own
firm; he was connected with the Queen Insurance Company
(afterwards amalgamated with the Royal Insurance Com-
pany, of which he became a director) for over thirty-one
years as a member of the board of directors, and for some
years chairman. He was also a director of the Southern
Insurance Company and of the Storage Contracting Com-
pany for many years.
Henry Joseph Langdon,
of Rosecraddock.
William, arrived in Melbourne by the ship "Marlborough"
(Captain, afterwards Sir, Alan Young), on sth November,
1852.
Two years after his arrival, in conjunction with Mr.
Josephs, he established the firm of Josephs, Langdon and
Company, China Merchants. A few years later, Mr. Josephs
returned to China, and Mr. H. J. Langdon carried on the
business as Merchants and Importers under the name of
H. J. Langdon and Company, by which it has been since
known.
Mr. Langdon held an honourable and important position
in the mercantile life of Melbourne, and conducted his
business on the high level of that of the English business
houses in which he had gained his early experience.
Elizabeth Laetitia Lane Langdon.
On 14th June, 1870, Mr. Langdon purchased a property
of twenty acres, situated in Caulfield, and known as Ring-
wood; he renamed it Rosecraddock (taken from the sur-
name of a family with whom the Cornish branch of the
Langdons had intermarried in the very early days). This
property, which was originally a Crown grant by purchase
by one, Edward Warne, dated 20th October, 1854, and
conveyed by him on 24th January, 1855 to I. S. Dismoir,
passed through several hands before passing to Mr. Lang-
don. The greater portion of the property was subdivided
and sold by auction between 1918 and 1921.
Mr. Langdon was a prominent resident of Caulfield, one
of his public offices being that of a member of the Roads
Board of that district, before it was formed into a shire,

Hineage
This family is descended from the Langdons of North

as the early 13th century, when one, Hugh de Langdon
(according to Sir William Pole’s "County of Devonshire"),

of William Timms, which had been established in 1842.
In 1857 the name of the firm was changed to Wilson,
Buchanan and Company, and in 1868 became John Wilson
and Company. In 1872, this business was acquired by
John Sanderson and Company, and Mr. Shannon was ad-
mitted a partner, the business still retaining the name of
John Wilson and Company. Three years later the business
of James Ford Strachan, merchants, which was established
in 1837, amalgamated with John Wilson and Company,

the public life of Geelong, being a member of the Geelong
Hospital Committee, 1877-1919, and President, 1899-1919.

Raleigh of Mona Vale
JOSEPH RALEIGH of "Mona Vale,” Moonee Ponds,
near Melbourne, was a son of John Raleigh, of Catrick
House, near Manchester, England, and his wife, Ann.
He was born at Catrick House in 1803, and became a cotton
merchant in Manchester, carrying on business in that city
until 1843, when he decided to take his family to Australia
and settle there. With his wife and three sons, he sailed
from London on Ist July, 1843, in the "Imaum of Muscat,”
Joseph Raleigh
of Mona Vale
456 tons register (Captain Riches), which arrived in Port
Phillip via Adelaide on 2nd December, 1843. The Raleighs
stayed at the Port Phillip Club Hotel until a suitable resi-
dence was found.
Joseph Raleigh became a colonist of considerable standing
in Port Phillip. His first venture appears to have been in
pastoral pursuits on a property acquired by him in the
Moonee Ponds district, on the Saltwater River, later known
as Maribyrnong; here he built a residence, naming it "Mona
Vale.” This was in 1844, and two years later he entered
into partnership with William Stuart Fyfe and James Has-
sell as merchants and shipowners, their headquarters being
at what was then known as Raleigh’s Wharf, near what is
now Queen's Bridge, on the Yarra. The firm also conducted
boiling down works on the Saltwater River, during the
slump period in beef and mutton, when carcases had to be
treated for far and tallow. The partnership was dissolved
in 1850 and became Raleigh, Fyfe and Company, and later
the well-known firm of Raleigh, Lock, Thorp and Com-
pany.
Other sheep and cattle runs which Mr. Raleigh owned
were Noorilim Station, 44,320 acres, on the Goulburn, near
Murchison, purchased from a Mr. Coen in 1844 and held
until March, 1851, when it was sold to James Rae; Sutton
Priscilla Raleigh
(nee Thorp)
Grange Station, near Harcourt, consisting of 46,200 acres,
purchased in the same year as Noorilim from Cobb Brothers
and sold in 1850 to H. N. Simson. In 1846, in conjunction
with William Lockhart Morton, he took up Morton Plains
run, in the Wimmera, 142,720 acres in extent; Mr. Morton
dropped out of the partnership in the following year, and
Mr. Raleigh carried on alone until April, 1850, when he
disposed of the run to Thomas H. Pyke. He held the
"Mona Vale” property up to the time of his death, and
only recently the last of the original buildings on the
property, long known as "Raleigh's Castle,” was demol-
ished; it was not the family residence, but was built on a
hill to accommodate the shepherds and other employees.
From the foregoing it will be seen what an active life
this Victorian pioneer must have led, becoming a leading
merchant, shipowner and pastoralist, all in the short period


of nine years, some of which were the worst ever faced by
the man on the land.
Joseph Raleigh married, in 1833, Priscilla, daughter of
William Thorp, of Eallowfield Lodge, Manchester, England,
merchant, and his wife, Suzanna. Mrs. Raleigh was born
in 1814 and died at "Mona Vale,’’ Moonee Ponds, 7th
March, 1846.
Joseph Raleigh died at "Mona Vale,” 26th November,
1852, having had issue, a daughter, Priscilla, who died
in infancy, and three sons, of whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
JOHN RALEIGH, was born at Catrick House, Man-
chester, England, in 1834. Some years after his father's
death, he and his brother, Joseph, returned to England and
became partners in the firm of Dauglish, White and Han-
key, Merchants and Shippers, of London and Melbourne.
The branch was carried on under the name of Raleigh,
Dauglish, White and Company. In 1860 they decided to
return to Australia, and in the following year John Raleigh
acquired, in conjunction with his brother, Joseph, Tandara
Station, near Bendigo (then a property of approximately
40,000 acres), which he bought from Mr. Govett; here
he lived for fifty years. A large portion was thrown open
for selection and later he sold the western end of the
property to Mr. W. B. Shaw. He then went in extensively
for breeding stud Merino sheep, and was very successful,
taking many prizes each year at the Deniliquin Show, and
his stock was always in great request amongst other breed-
ers. He also had an interest in Caiwarra Station in Queens-
land. When Tandara Station was sub-divided for Closer
Settlement about 1909, he retired and took up residence
at Sandringham, Melbourne, in 1911.
He married, in 1856, Maria, daughter of Thomas Urmson
Ryder, of Sydney, New South Wales. She died at Mosman,
New South Wales, 20th September, 1920.

1914, having had issue;—

N.S.W., under Cuthbert Fetherstonhaugh, and re-
mained there for three years. In 1886 he took
over the management of Hartwood Station, in
Riverina, where he remained for twenty years,

Lockhart Morton of Morton Plains
WILLIAM LOCKHART MORTON was
born at Green Cambusnethan, Scotland, 19th
December, 1820, and educated at Glasgow Uni-
versity. In 1840 he decided to settle in Australia, and
arrived in Port Phillip in February, 1841.
Shortly after his arrival he became associated with Joseph
Raleigh, who established the first boiling-down works on
the Saltwater River, and in partnership with Mr. Raleigh
William Lockhart Morton
of Morton Plains
took up, in June, 1846, the pastoral property known as
Morton Plains, near Birchip, comprising 142,720 acres.
In September, 1847, he relinquished his interest in
Morton Plains and took up Plains of Thalia, near Jeffcott,
on the Loddon River, a property of 50,000 acres, and in
1853 acquired the adjoining run, Salisbury Plains, 77,000
acres, but through drought and disease amongst the stock
he had to abandon both properties in 1855, and later pur-
chased Salisbury Downs Station, near Deniliquin, New
South Wales.
Mr. Morton was one of the outstanding pioneers of
Australia; having had the benefit of a university education,
he put it to good use in the land of his adoption. Keenly
interested in acclimatisation, he took an active part in the
establishment in the early sixties of a weekly journal known
as "The Yeoman and Weekly Acclimatiser,” which, in
1864, together with the "Weekly Argus" and "The Ex-
aminer” was incorporated in the present weekly, "The
Australasian.”
He was also an explorer of note, and led many explora-
tory parties in Victoria, New South Wales and Northern
Queensland, and was the author of a report of his North
Queensland journey in 1860 to the Philosophical Institute.
Mary Anne Lockhart Morton
(nee Stone)
Amongst his many activities, his work in connection with
the Port Phillip Farmers’ Society, the forerunner of the
present Royal Agricultural Society, was outstanding, and
this extraordinary man deserves commendation in the pas-
toral annals of Australia.
After he retired from active pastoral work he resided at
South Yarra, Melbourne, until a few years before his death,
when he took up his residence at Belair, South Australia.
William Lockhart Morton, pioneer, pastoralist, explorer,
inventor, and writer, occupies a high place amongst the men
who so well and truly laid the foundations of the Aus-
tralia we know today.
He married, at Geelong, Victoria, 20th March, 1849,
Mary Anne, daughter of George Stone, of Tamworth,
Mitcham, Surrey, England. She came to Australia with the


Dendy family and was a cousin of Henry Dendy, one of
the early settlers of Melbourne, and owner of the historic
Dendy Survey at Brighton. Mrs. Morton was a typical
pioneer’s wife, and during her husband’s absence on his
exploration trips, remained at the homestead with her
family, with only a married couple for companionship. She
was a great horsewoman, and as natives were numerous and
in some cases dangerous, it required much courage and re-
sourcefulness to deal with them during her husband’s ab-
sence; she had many interesting experiences with the blacks,
but was never molested. Mary Anne Morton (nee Stone)
died at Angas Missionary Training College, North Adelaide,
South Australia, in July, 1914, get. 94.
William Lockhart Morton died at Hope Lodge, Belair,
South Australia, 10th March, 1898, having had issue, four

clerical staff of the well known firm of Grice, Sumner and
Company, Melbourne, where he remained for many years,
and was manager of that firm’s bonded stores; subsequently
he purchased a seat on the Melbourne Stock Exchange,
v/hich he held until his death.
He married, 21st September, 1878, Charlotte Alicia
Asolita Hammond, of Oatlands, Tasmania; she died at Mel-
bourne, 11th September, 1922.

The second son,
REV. WILLIAM LOCKHART MORTON, was born
at Salisbury Plains Station, Loddon, 4th September, 1851,
and educated at Melbourne C. of E. Grammar School. He
entered a lawyer’s office in Melbourne, then joined the staff
of Howard Smith, shipowner, Melbourne, but, after reach-
ing manhood, decided to study for the Ministry of the
Presbyterian Church, and entered the Theological Hall,
Melbourne. He was ordained in 1875, and his charges in-
cluded Dandenong, 1876, Camperdown, 1878, Ebenezer
Church, Ballarat, 1883, where he founded the Rescue work
known as Hope Lodge, and Malvern, Melbourne, 1889;
also Goodwood, South Australia. He then founded the first

affiliation with the Melbourne Bible Institute, Windsor,

1841.
He remained in Melbourune until 1844, when, with his
family, he overlanded to Belfast (now Port Fairy) and
acquired heavily timbered land at Koroit. The first house
on the property was built of slabs and roofed with shingles
from timber on the estate; the stone used was bluestone
from excavations made in sinking a well one hundred feet
deep on the property. He also owned the Western Hotel,
Caramut, one of the earliest Western District hostelries.
James Stribling married Jane Hancock, of Barnstaple,
Devonshire, England (born [c. 1813] baptized 13th October,

Yuille
WILLIAM CROSS YUILLE was born at
Cardross, Dumbartonshire, Scotland, 28th March,
1819. He joined the staff of Messrs. Ewing and
Company, Glasgow, West India Merchants, but at the age
of seventeen, came out to Australia, and landed at Hobart
Town in December, 1836.
At this time glowing accounts of the new settlement of
Port Phillip were engaging the attention of the pastoralists
and business men of Van Diemen s Land, and young
William Cross Yuille, of Ballarat
William Yuille, fired by die pioneer spirit, decided to cross
over to the "land of promise,” where he joined his
cousin, Archibald Buchanan Yuille, who had preceded
him from Scotland. They purchased a flock of 2,200 well-
bred Merino sheep from Peter Murdoch, shipped them to
Port Henry in the "John Dunscombe” in February, 1837,
and took up land at Murgheboluc, on the Barwon. The
blacks, however, proved very troublesome, and in March of
the following year they took up Ballarat run, 10,000 acres,
on which the City of Ballarat was afterwards built, and
Lake Wendouree was in its original condition, being
known as Yuille’s swamp. Ballarat run was held by the
partnership until 1840, when William Cross Yuille disposed
of his interest to his cousin, Archibald Buchanan Yuille,
who held it until the early fifties, when he left the Colony.
In 1934 the Ballarat Historical Society erected an obelisk on
the bank of Lake Wendouree, formerly known as ''Yuille’s
Swamp,” to the memory of William Cross Yuille, the first
white settler at Ballarat. Sixty-seven of William Cross
Yuilie’s descendants were present at the unveiling ceremony.
After the dissolution of partnership in Ballarat Station,
William \uille visited New Zealand, and was present at
the formal taking over of these islands in the name of the
Mary 3 uille (nee Denny)
British Government by Governor Hobson. Mr. Yuille ac-
quired large tracts of land from the Maoris, but the Govern-
ment refused to recognise his title, so he left New Zealand,
visited his native land, and returned to Port Phillip in
1841. He went into partnership in the following year with
his future father-in-law, James Oliphant Denny, in the
mercantile firm of Denny and Yuille. This partnership took
up Rockbank run, on the Werribee Plains, extending from
Williamstown to Mount Cotterill; the run remained in the
name of Denny and Yuille until 1846, when it became the
sole property of W. C. Yuille, who held it until 1833. It
was then sold to W. J. T. Clarke. In 1851 Mr. W. C.
Yuille acquired Ballanrong Station, 8,000 acres, near
Hastings, from James Davey, and Barwidgee Station,


28,000 acres, from William Eorlonge; the former run was
taken over by his cousin, Archibald Buchanan Yuille, in
1852, and Barwidgee was sold in the same year.
William Cross Yuille left for the old country in 1854,
returning to Victoria in 1858, when he turned his attention
wholly to the turf. For many years previously he had been
prominently identified with racing, and rode his own horse,
"Nobby,” matched against a Tasmanian mare owned by
William Wood, in the second race meeting held in Mel-
bourne in 1839 (the stakes were twenty-five sovereigns a
side and breakfast for a dozen guests) and won easily.
Later on he raced on the new course at St. Kilda, where
his horse "Field Marshall” beat Mr. Kilburn’s "Liberty” in
a match for £SO a side. According to early chronicles, the
racecourse in 1839 was situated at the foot of Batman s
Hill, now part of Spencer Street Railway Station, and was
marked out with a few stakes, saplings and broad palings,
whilst the "grandstand" appears to have been formed by
lashing together a couple of bullock drays.
He also owned such well known racers as "Jim Crow,"
"Dinah,” who won the V.A.T.C. St. Leger in 1850, "Maid
of the Mist,” who won the same race the next year,
"Balloon” and "General Tom Thumb.” When in England
in 1855, he purchased "Gaslight” and "Warhawk for
Hector Norman Simson. Mr. Yuille took up his racing
quarters at Williamstown in 1858, and his success caused
a sensation amongst the sportsmen of the day. In 1859
he won the Oaks with Birdswing, and his horse, The
Orphan,” beat the crack steeplechaser of the time, "Pop
Goes the Weasel. His horse, Flying Buck, won the first
Champion Race in 1859 at Flemington and the St. Leger
in the following year; he also at one time owned "Tory-
boy,” the winner of the Melbourne Cup in 1865.
In 1866 he closed his racing establishment and for seven
years was a valued contributor to the sporting columns of
the "Australasian” under the nom-de-plumes of "Peeping
'pom and Playboy, and was widely recognised as one of
the most competent turf writers of his day.
When he severed his connection with the "Australasian’
in 1873, he founded the blood stock auctioneering firm of
W. C. Yuille and Company, which was the acknowledged
"Tattersalls” of Australia. The firm held many notable
sales of blood stock at Kirk s Bazaar in Bourke Street, and
at their yards at Newmarket. Among the outstanding sales
conducted by W. C. Yuille and Company were C. B.
Fisher’s Maribyrnong Stud in 1878, which realised £84,000,
and St. Albans Estate Stud, sold to Mr. W. R. Wilson, of
Broken Hill fame, for £74,000. He originated the Aus-
tralian Stud Book, which was completed by his son, Archi-
bald, and his grandson, Albert Loddon Yuille, is now the
official keeper of the Stud Book.
William Cross Yuille was one of the most notable figures
on the Australian turf, and enjoyed the reputation among
the racing community of being an honourable, straight-
forward and popular man.
He married in Melbourne, 7th July, 1842, Mary, daughter
of James Oliphant Denny (a member of the family of
Denny of Dumbarton, the well known shipbuilders), who
arrived in Port Phillip in 1839 and established the mercan-
tile firm of Denny and Yuille in Melbourne in 1841. James
Oliphant Denny was a Trustee of Scots Church, Melbourne,
and a Director of the Melbourne Fire and Marine Insurance
Company in the early days. Mary Yuille (nee Denny), a
relative of Charles Kingsley, the noted author, was born at
Glasgow, Scotland, 20th April, 1824, and died at Melbourne
in July, 1889-
William Cross Yuille died at East Melbourne, 19th July,
1894, having had issue seven sons and four daughters, of
whom we now treat.
George Yuille
The eldest son:—
GEORGE YUILLE, was born at Rockbank Station,
Victoria, 12th November, 1844, and studied at Oxford
University. On his return to Australia, he took up land at
Lake Bolac, and here he engaged in pastoral pursuits for
twenty years. He then joined the teaching staff of the
Victorian Education Department, and was stationed at
various schools throughout the State until his retirement in
1905. Interested in all branches of sport, he was a splendid
shot and good cricketer; he was also a prominent member
and worker for the Presbyterian Church at Lake Bolac,


He married Anne McMillan, who came out to Port
Phillip from Fort William, Scotland, with her widowed
mother, Isabella McMillan (who took up land at Hexham,
Victoria, in 1850), and her brothers, John and Donald,
and sister, Isabella. Mrs. Isabella McMillan was one of that
band of pioneers who came out from the West Highlands
and played a great part in the settlement of the Colony.
She brought out her furniture, china and spinning wheel
from her home at Fort William, and lived on her land at
Hexham until her death on 12th January, 1895, at the age
of 95. Anne Yuille (nee McMillan) died at Heathcote,
Victoria, 31st August, 1918.

He married Adela, daughter of Douglas Thomas Kilburn,
of Melbourne and Hobart.
On 14th March, 1878, William Yuille went from Sand-

The fourth son;—
ARCHIBALD YUILLE, was born at Rockbank Station,
Victoria, 11th July, 1851, and educated at Scotch College,
Melbourne. He joined his father’s firm, W. C. Yuille and
Company, blood stock salesmen, and later on was admitted
to partnership. His father had commenced the compilation
of the Australian Stud Book, but as he died before the
first volume was completed, Archibald Yuille took on this
colossal task. After compiling nine volumes of the work,
he sold the rights to the Victoria Racing Club and Aus-
tralian Jockey Club, since then the Australian Stud Book
has been kept in Sydney.
Archibald Yuille, like his father, took a great interest in
horse racing, and was for some years a member of the
Committees of the Wilhamstown and Victorian Turf Clubs,
from which he resigned in 1892, to join the Committee of
the Victoria Racing Club. Twelve years later Mr. Yuille
was elected Honorary Treasurer of the Victoria Racing
Club, and in the following fourteen years the finances of
the Club were built up to a very strong position and the
stakes were increased nearly tenfold. During his period as
Treasurer, the Flemington racecourse was also considerably
improved. He was noted, not only in Australia, but in New
Zealand and England, for his knowledge of horse breeding,
and during his several visits to England, he made important
purchases of mares on behalf of Australian studmasters. He
also purchased in New Zealand a number of mares which
became the nucleus of the famous Shipley Stud. He raced
several good horses, including "Spencer” and "Fairy Tale,’
and amongst racers bred by him was "Preston," a winner
of the St. Leger.
In his capacity of auctioneer of W. C. Yuille and Com-
pany, Archibald Yuille sold many famous horses, and he
recorded the highest price for any thoroughbred in Aus-
tralia up to the time of his retirement in 1924, when he
knocked down "Heroic" to C. B. Kellow for 16,000
guineas.
He married Annie, daughter of David Denny, of Cowl
Cowl, New South Wales, and his wife, Emily Hudson.
Archibald Yuille died at St. Kilda, Melbourne, 24th

This family was originally seated in Argyllshire, and later
in Dumbartonshire, where they held the property of Dar-
leith for nearly two centuries. The first member of the
family of whom there is any authentic record is,
THOMAS ZUILL, who was a witness to the Convention
between General Monk, Commander of the Cromwellian
Forces in Scotland, and the Earl of Lothian, when the latter
capitulated in May, 1655. This Thomas Zuill had a son,
JOHN ZUILL, who acquired by purchase the lands of
Darleith, Dumbartonshire. He was a Commissioner of
Estates for Dumbartonshire to the Scottish Parliament in
1678. He suffered by fine and confinement in the Castle
of Dumbarton during the religious persecutions of the time.

Patterson of Moorabbee
THE HON. JOHN HUNTER PATTERSON of
Moorabbee Station, near Heathcote, Victoria, was born
in Fifeshire, Scotland, in 1810, and came out to
Australia with his parents, three sisters, and two brothers, in
the ship "Castle Forbes” (Captain Ord), which, after a
six months voyage, arrived in Hobart Town via the Cape
of Good Hope on Ist March, 1822.
He held land at Grangeburn (now Hamilton) from
June, 1842, to July, 1843, and in the latter year settled
with his family on Tourbouric, or Toraborac, Station, near
Heathcote, a run of 50,000 acres, purchased from Dutton,
Simson and Darlot. He held this property until 1853, when
it was sold to John Holmes. In 1853 he purchased from
C. H. Ebden the Campaspe Plains or Moorabbee run, con-
Hon. John Hunter Patterson
of Moorabbee
He gained pastoral experience under his father on the
latter’s property, Hunterston, on the Shannon River, and
later held a pastoral property, Calton Hill, near Hamilton,
Tasmania. In 1836 he purchased Lauriston, a property of
640 acres, from George Russell (later of Golf Hill, Vic-
toria), but sold it to Philip Russell before settling in
Port Phillip.
John Hunter Patterson arrived in Port Phillip in Decem-
ber, 1836, and in January, 1837, acquired Green Hill Station,
extending from Wallan to the present suburbs of Mel-
bourne, which he held for about three years; during this
period he appears to have had a residence in Melbourne, as
it is recorded in "The Narrative of George Russell of Golf
Hill” that Mr. Russell "visited Mr. J. H. Patterson’s house
in Brunswick Street, Collingwood.”
Martha Moodie Patterson
(nee Harvey)
sisting of 144,900 acres, adjoining Heathcote, and shortly
afterwards subdivided the property into Deerinal, Moorab-
bee, Langworner and Kimboltan; Deerinal he sold to
William Speed in 1853, and retained the other subdivisions.
John Hunter Patterson had to pass through the troublous
period of the early settlement of Port Phillip. In 1841, the
time of the commercial crisis in the Colony, he, with
eleven other gentlemen (at that time dubbed "The Twelve
Apostles”), became security for a merchant, who, owing to
the slump, was unable to meet the demands of the Bank,
and this almost ruined Mr. Patterson, coming as it did at a
time when stock values had collapsed and sheep were worth
only from 4/- to 6/- per head, and cattle 30/- to 40/-. He
managed to carry on, however, until the time of the gold
rush, when those squatters who were near the goldfields


1
benefited by the high prices paid by the diggers for meat.
It was customary at this time to accept gold nuggets in
payment, and on many occasions, after selling a number of
sheep on the goldfields and returning home with the cor-
responding amount of gold in his possession, he was
attacked by bushrangers, but managed to outwit them and
make his escape.
John Hunter Patterson was a member of the Legislative
Council of Victoria for the North Western Province from
1856 to 1859, the year of his death, and was also a Trustee
of Scots Church, Melbourne, for many years.
He married Martha Moodie Whittle (nee Harvey), who
died at St. Kilda, Melbourne, in 1885.
The Hon. John Hunter Patterson died at St. Kilda, 24th
April, 1859, having had issue, three sons and two daughters,
of whom we now treat.
Myles Patterson
The eldest son,
MYLES PATTERSON, was born in Tasmania, 6th
November, 1836. He was in partnership with his brother,
John, in Boonoke Station, New South Wales, and retired
about 1888, when, together with his family, he took up his
residence in England.
He married Fanny Carter, and died in England in 1890,
having had issue;—
i. Myles, d. unm.
i. Alice, d. unm.
ii. Florence, d. unm.
iii. Jeanie, (deed.), m. Major Boxer (deed.), of the
Lincolnshire Regt., who served in the Great War
and was posted missing. Issue, two sons, (i)
Myles, of Lincolnshire Regt. (Captain) ; (ii)
Charles, of Lincolnshire Regt. (Captain) ; and a
daughter, Beryl, who m. Col. Peddie.
The second son,
JOHN HUNTER PATTERSON, was born at Colling-
wood, Melbourne, 6th April, 1841, and educated at schools
in Melbourne, and Edinburgh, Scotland. He studied medi-
cine for a short time, but owing to ill-health, had to give
it up. He then took up pastoral pursuits at Boonoke Station,
in Riverina, and later, in partnership with his brother.
Myles, purchased the property; it was running cattle when
purchased, but the partners shortly afterwards changed over
John Hunter Patterson
to sheep. When the partnership terminated, John Hunter
Patterson purchased Byna Station, near Narrandera, New
South Wales, which he held for two years; the last year
was an exceptionally good one—the grass grew at such a
rate (it reached the top of the saddle on a horse), that Mr.
Patterson became alarmed, and sold out, purchasing Golgol
Station, 380,000 acres, from the Peppin Brothers. Other
stations held by him were Topar, near Broken Hill, 350,000
acres; Yandama, approximately a million acres, in New
South Wales and South Australia (the South Australian
portion was unfenced) near Milparinka, on the Queensland
border. Towards the end of his pastoral career, he pur-
chased a half interest in East Loddon Station, 45,000 acres,
at Bridgewater, on the Loddon, from his brother-in-law,
John Ettershank. Mr. Patterson was one of the pioneers of
the back country of New South Wales.
He married Charlotte, daughter of William Rodier, of
Ballarat, Victoria.
John Hunter Patterson died in Melbourne, 7th July,
1930, having had issue:—
i. John Hunter, b. East Melb., 31st Oct., 1882. Ed.
Camberwell G.S., Melb. Gained pastoral ex-
perience on his father's properties, and had three
years commercial training on the staff of Dalgety


and Co. Ltd. Owing to a serious accident which
occurred to his father, he took charge of the
family properties, which he supervised for some
years, during which Topar was sold to W. Dawes,
Yandama to William Norton, and East Loddon
was cut up and sold. John Hunter Patterson Jr.
purchased 2,200 acres of this property, which he
still holds, and also acquired from his father
Golgol Station, which was resumed by the New
South Wales Government in 1918. He purchased,
in 1913, Hartwood Station, Deniliquin, N.S.W.,
which he still holds. His flock of Merinos are of
Wanganella blood. Mr. Hunter Patterson has
been a member of the Southern Riverina Graziers’
Association since Dec., 1911, and has held the
office of President since 1925. He is a member of
the Conargo Shire Council, which he entered in
1914, and has been four times President. He has
also been a Trustee of the Yanco Billabong Water
Trust since its inception. He m. MatildaWolseley,
daughter of Dr. Finch Noyes, of Deniliquin.
i. Ethel Martha.
Harvey Patterson
The third son,
HARVEY PATTERSON, was born in Melbourne, 14th
November, 1848. He took up pastoral pursuits and became
owner of Corona and Mena Murteo Stations, in the Western
Darling. He was also interested in mining, and accompanied
his brother, John Hunter Patterson, through Western Aus-
tralia during the gold rush in the early nineties. The journey
was made on camels.
When Mr. Patterson was at Corona Station, which at
that time covered 3,200,000 acres, and carried 80,000 sheep,
he became interested in Broken Hill, which was situated
near his property, and in 1885 he was impressed with the
rich possibilities of this mine, when there was little con-
fidence among people generally, the mine being then owned
by a syndicate of seven. When visiting Mr. George McCul-
loch, manager of Mount Gipps Station, and a member of
the syndicate, he saw a large silver slug, and asked Mr.
McCulloch what he would take for his share in the "Hill.'’
Mr. McCulloch replied that he would not take £20,000; he
agreed, however, to try and get a half share in the syndicate
for Mr. Patterson from another member of the syndicate,
Mr. David James, who sold to Mr. Patterson half of his
share, representing one-twenty-eighth share of the whole
syndicate, for £l,BOO. Mr. Patterson was one of the original
directors of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited,
and continued to be a member of the Board until he re-
tired to reside in England in May, 1917.
He was well known in pastoral and mining circles, both
in Australia and New Zealand, and was also keenly inter-
ested in the turf, being both owner and breeder in Australia
and New Zealand. Probably the best horses he ever owned
were "Menschikoff,” bred in New Zealand; "Delaware,”
also bred in New Zealand, who came third in the Mel-
bourne Cup in 1908, and "Thackeray,” who won the
Williamstown Cup in 1907. He also owned a racing stud
at Melton Park, near Melton, Victoria. In early life he was
interested in coursing, and in 1885 won the Victorian
Coursing Club’s West Bourke Plate with "Painstaker.”
He married, firstly, Kate Irvine (died 13th December,
1902), and secondly, Mrs. Athel Eleanor Sharpe.
Harvey Patterson died at Wimbledon Common, London,
England, 13th May, 1931, having had issue by his first
wife:—

Rutledge of Farnham Park
WILLIAM RUTLEDGE of Farnham Park,
J.P., was one of the most outstanding pioneers in
the Western District of Victoria. He was born at
Ballymagirl, near Bawnboy, co. Cavan, Ireland, in January,
1806, and at the age of twenty-six years, decided to settle
in Australia. He landed in Sydney in 1832 and took up
pastoral property in the vicinity of Bungendore, New South
Wales. In 1838, having heard of the new settlement of
Port Phillip, he sold his New South Wales property and,
overlanding to Victoria, proceeded to Kilmore, in the
Westernport district. There he purchased land, which he
held until 1841, when he acquired a Special Survey of
5,000 acres, near Warrnambool, naming it Farnham Park.
Besides his pastoral interests, in 1844 William Rutledge
founded the mercantile business of William Rutledge and
Company, with headquarters at Port Fairy. He built up this
business to such good account that it was soon recognised as
the most extensive business of its kind in the Western
District, and its ramifications extended as far as Queensland
and Western Australia; the firm also developed the early
inter-colonial trade in cattle between Victoria and New
South Wales. William Rutledge was primarily responsible
for the development of Port Fairy and also the surrounding
district, and the present rich Tower Hill land nearWarrnam-
bool was pioneered by him, and later sold and cultivated.
It was said of William Rutledge that in Port Fairy he
was Merchant, Mayor and Magistrate all in one, and he also
created the Harbour Trust of that day. He was, up to the
time of his retirement, one of the most vigorous business
men in the Western District, and although he had many
setbacks, his indomitable spirit triumphed over all reverses.
Owing to a financial slump, the firm of William Rutledge
and Company ceased trading, with liabilities (owing to the
inability of the company’s debtors to meet their com-
mitments) amounting to well over £lOO,OOO, but with
characteristic energy, he started again and paid back every
penny of this huge amount.
In connection with his pastoral activities, he was par-
ticularly noted for the establishment from imported stock of
a fine Lincoln stud at Farnham Park, and from this stud
the foundations of a number of important studs were laid,
both in Australia and New Zealand. He also for a short
time held the pastoral run known as Mount Napier Road,
near Port Fairy. Recognising the potentialities of the Port
Fairy district, at his own expense he made arrangements for
several families to come from Ireland to work on his land;
later, most of these employees became tenants at will, and
prospered, their descendants holding the land down to the
present time.
William Rutledge entered politics in 1851, and was one
of the first of those elected after the separation of Victoria
from New South Wales, being elected for his district as a
member of the Legislative Council of Victoria. He remained
a member of the Legislative Council until 1854, and in
1856 was elected to represent his district in the Legislative
Assembly, holding the seat until 1861. During his Parlia-
mentary career he contributed in no small measure to the
building up of this great State of Victoria.
A great lover of horses, William Rutledge was primarily
responsible for the formation of the local Jockey Club, and
at various times was Steward, Judge and Starter.
He was noted throughout the State for the hospitality
which he dispensed at Farnham Park, which was one of the
social centres of the Western District in the early days. One
of the finest type of virile pioneers which Victoria has had,
whatever his hand found to do, he did with all his might.
His brusque manner hid a kindly heart, and he was a
supporter and subsidiser of every local charity. In an
article written about William Rutledge after his death, he
was described as "one of the kindest, cleverest, honestest
men who ever trod the earth."
He married Eliza, daughter of Richard Kirk, of Sydney,
for some time an Army Surgeon. Eliza Rutledge (nee Kirk)
died at Farnham Park, near Warrnambool, 31st August,
1888.
William Rutledge died at Farnham Park, near Warrnam-
bool, Victoria, Ist June, 1876, having had issue, two sons
and five daughters, of whom we now treat.
The elder son,
THOMAS FORSTER RUTLEDGE, of "Werronggurt,"
Warrnambool, J.P., was born at Port Fairy, co. Villiers,
19th April, 1846, and educated in England. On his return
to Australia, he joined the staff of a bank in Hamilton for
business training, and later took up pastoral pursuits on his
father’s property, and, on the death of the latter, became
joint owner with his brother, William Rupert, of Farnham
Park Estate. His brother resided at the homestead, and
Thomas Forster Rutledge resided at Werronggurt, near
Warrnambool, which had been built by his father; there
he resided for forty-five years. He took a keen interest in
the pure Lincoln stud established by his father, and became
one of the best judges of this breed in Victoria, being also
well known as a successful exhibitor at the Royal Mel-
bourne Show and various district shows. He also bred and
imported Shorthorn cattle, and for a time imported a large
number of Clydesdale mares from Scotland.


One of the pioneers of the co-operative system of dairy-
ing in the Port Fairy district, he was a member of the first
Board of Directors of the old Farnham Dairy Factory, and
was for some time Chairman; also a member of the Board
of Directors of the Rosebrook Butter Factory.
As a member of the Warrnambool Shire Council for
many years, he gave valuable service to his district. He
gradually disposed of Werronggurt, the last of it being sold
about 1899, and in 1903 he purchased a property on the
Mangatu River, Poverty Bay, New Zealand. He did not
stay there long, but returned to Victoria in 1906, when he
purchased Wairere Estate, Mansfield, now held by his son.
He eventually retired and resided in Melbourne until his
death.
He married, 3rd August, 1876, Edith Annie Lydia (d.
Melb., 9th Jan., 1939) eldest daughter of John Ritchie, of
Aringa Estate, Victoria (see Ritchie of Aringa family records

Melbourne banks, but on the death of his father, he took
over his share of Farnham Park Estate and entered on a
pastoral career, also bought "Airlie,” near Warrnambool,

naming it "Dunwell.”
About 1905, William Rupert Rutledge decided to settle
in New Zealand, and took up his residence at Poverty
Bay; here he was joined by his brother, Thomas Forster, the
two brothers being the first to take up land in the Mangatu
Block. This property they named Wairere, and held it for
some years. Later, with his second son, he acquired the
Orete property in the Cape Runaway district, which was
held until 1926, when William Rupert Rutledge retired
from active pastoral work.

Howard
CHARLES HOWARD, the founder of this branch
of the Howard family in Australia, was born in
England on 10th March, 1796. He joined the
British Army as a junior officer in 1814, and served under
Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington) in
the Peninsular War, being present at the historic lines of
Torres Vedras. After the evacuation of the British Troops
from Spain, he accompanied his regiment to Sierra Leone,
West Africa, but the climate played havoc with his de-
tachment, and he himself was invalided home about 1816.
He was appointed Deputy Assistant Commissary General in
1821, and on 4th September, 1823, sailed in the ship "Sir
Godfrey Webster” to New South Wales. The ship, which
was in command of Captain Rennoldson, carried 180 male
convicts and the detachment of Mr. Howard’s regiment
(40th). He was accompanied by his wife. The "Sir
Godfrey Webster” arrived at Hobart Town on 21st Decem-
ber, 1823, and sailed again on 6th January, 1824, for
Sydney, arriving at its destination on 17th of the same
month.
After his arrival in Sydney, Charles Howard was in
charge of several military stations in New South Wales,
among which were Windsor and Bathurst, where the con-
victs were engaged in constructing the road over the Blue
Mountains.
In 1837 Charles Howard was transferred to Port Phillip,
arriving by the steamer "James Watt” in August, 1837,
when he relieved Mr. Skene Craig, who had been tem-
porarily in charge of the Commissariat Department. Charles
Howard remained in charge of the Commissariat Depart-
ment until the end of 1841, when he retired from the Army
with the rank of Assistant Commissary General, and took
up his residence on his property, Howardville, which com-
prised 160 acres on the Darebin Creek, near Preston. In
1849 he moved to Melbourne, where he lived for some years
in a house in Little Flinders Street.
Charles Howard married firstly, at Dieppe, France,
Elizabeth Bennett, who was a Ward in Chancery, and by
whom he had issue four sons and three daughters. He
married secondly, on 4th July, 1838, Sarah Pierce, daughter
of Dr. Griffin, of Limerick, Ireland; she came out to Port
Phillip with her step-father, Patrick E. Cussen, M.D., in
1837, and died at Hawthorn, Melbourne, 15th September,
1877, set. 57, having had issue one son and two daughters.

ick William Howard. He commenced his education under

school kept by Dr. David Boyd, of Trinity College, Dublin.

Docker of Bontharambo
THE REV. JOSEPH DOCKER was born at
Newby Head, Westmorland, England, 19th Decem-
ber, 1793. His father dying five years later, the family
came to reside at Appleby, and here he commenced his
education at the Appleby Grammar School, later going to
Oxford University, where he studied for the Anglican
Ministry.
He was ordained deacon on 29th August, 1817, became
assistant curate to his brother, the Rev. William Docker,
Rev. Joseph Docker, of Bontharambo
at Martindale, Westmorland, and on 19th July of the
following year was ordained priest by the Bishop of Carlisle.
In 1821 he was licensed to the curacy of North Meols,
Lancashire, where he remained until 1823, when he again
became assistant to his brother, who had been appointed
Vicar of Southport.
In the beginning of 1828, through the friendship and
good offices of Lord Stanley, afterwards Earl of Derby, the
Rev. Joseph Docker was appointed to a Colonial Chaplaincy,
and on 16th June of that year sailed for Australia in the
ship "Adam,” arriving in Sydney Harbour on 11th Novem-
ber, 1828, and taking up his duties at St. Mathews Church,
Windsor, on Ist January, 1829.
Mr. Docker had inherited the love of husbandry from a
long line of ancestors who were yeoman farmers in England,
and in 1833 he resigned his living at Windsor and pur-
chased a grazing and agricultural estate there, known as
Clifton, but four years later reports by Major Mitchell re-
garding the fine grazing land available for squatting in the
new settlement of Port Phillip claimed his attention, and
recognizing the splendid opportunities open to those who
had the courage and the means to take up a pioneering life,
he sold Clifton and decided to look for a squatting run in
the new territory.
Sarah Docker (nee Bristow)
After visiting the Monaro district and purchasing between
two and three thousand sheep at prices from 30/- to 40/-
per head to add to the stock from Clifton, he set out for
Port Phillip early in 1838, accompanied by his wife,
daughters, Mary Jane and Sarah Josephine, sons, William,
Stanley Horrocks, Frederick George and Mathew (the eldest
child being ten years old), shepherds, teamsters and maid-
servants. The stock consisted of three thousand sheep, two
hundred head of cattle, brood mares, a stallion, and bullocks,
also bullock waggons, covered carts for Mrs. Docker and
the women servants, a boat for crossing rivers, and all
goods, chattels and stores necessary for the journey and the
farming of a station.
After leaving Yass, New South Wales, the overlanders
followed Major Mitchell's track, which was a single bullock


dray track and a few blazed trees here and there. The
journey was no mean undertaking, especially with young
children, servants who were mostly assigned, and a goodly
number of stock to look after, through what was practically
unknown territory, peopled in most cases by unfriendly
blacks.
In the beginning of winter the sheep commenced lamb-
ing, and it was found necessary to go off Major Mitchell's
track in order to find better grass. When the lambing was
completed, Major Mitchell's track was again struck and the
journey recommenced. In the early part of June flour
became scarce, and a bullock team had to be despatched
to Port Phillip for fresh supplies. Owing to many difficul-
ties, the trip to Melbourne and back took ten weeks, and
the overlanders were then reduced to their last bag of
flour.
Towards the end of September, 1838, the party crossed
the Ovens River near what is now Wangaratta, and made
their camp, where they were visited by Mr. George Faithful,
who informed them that he had taken up Bontharambo
Plains run, but had decided to abandon it, owing to being
molested by the blacks, who had murdered six of his men
in a few months. Mr. Docker, who had already viewed the
country from the ranges and had been impressed with it
even at that distance, examined it at close quarters, and
after doing so, decided to take over the run and risk trouble
with the natives.
The original size of the run when taken over was
100.000 acres of practically virgin country, the only im-
provement being the little slab hut built by the Faithfuls,
capable of accommodating only a few of the party, whilst
the others lived temporarily in tents. Extensive improve-
ments were made during the next few years, and in ad-
dition to sheep and cattle raising, cultivation was carried
on, with the result that by 1851 the station was running
3.000 head of cattle and 30,000 sheep, and between 1857
and 1865, 1,500 acres were cropped.
Mr. Docker was always ready to experiment in any new
industry likely to benefit the colony, and planted ten acres
of olives of different varieties, from which a small quantity
of excellent olive oil was made; also a few acres of white
mulberries, as he thought that the rearing of silkworms
might prove successful. An extensive vineyard was also
planted, a wine cellar erected, and wine making proved
payable for some years.
In spite of bushfires, droughts, floods and many other
of the difficulties facing the pioneer in the early days of
the colony, Joseph Docker, by his knowledge of stock
raising, coupled with energy and business enterprise, over-
came all obstacles until Bontharambo became one of the
most notable pastoral properties in the North Eastern dis-
trict of Victoria.
Mr. Docker took the risk of trouble with the blacks when
he took over Bontharambo, and his tact and sympathetic
treatment of them had such good results that, although
allowed to visit the homestead at will, they were never
guilty of molesting anyone, being eager to make themselves
generally useful, and when, during the gold rush, the
Bontharambo shepherds left the station for the goldfields,
7,800 sheep were placed in charge of the blacks, who
tended them faithfully for nearly eighteen months, prob-
ably the most remarkable example of trust between the
squatter and the blacks on record in Australia.
About 1827, before leaving England, the Rev. Joseph
Docker married Sarah, daughter of Edward Bristow, mer-
chant, of Liverpool. She proved an able helpmate to her
husband in his work, both as a Churchman and pioneer
pastoralist, and died at Bontharambo, 17th May, 1864.
Joseph Docker died at Bontharambo, 10th April, 1865
(he and his wife are both buried in the private cemetery
there), having had issue, five sons and five daughters, of
whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
WILLIAM DOCKER, b. Windsor, N.S.W., 29th May,
1830. Pastoralist. He d., unm., at Bontharambo, 14th July
1863.
The second son,
STANLEY HORROCKS DOCKER, b. Windsor,
N.S.W., 1832. Pastoralist. He was drowned when attempt-
ing to rescue others from a flooded creek on the Ovens
River, near Wangaratta, in 1851. Unm.
The third son,
FREDERICK GEORGE DOCKER, was born at Clifton,
Windsor, New South Wales, 9th May, 1835, and educated
at the King’s School, Parramatta, New South Wales. He
then came to Bontharambo Station to assist his father in
running the property, and on the latter’s death, assumed
control of the station, in which he was later joined by his
brother, John. 1 he two brothers were associated in the
management of Bontharambo until 1883, when John took
over Myrrhee Station, Wangaratta, and Frederick George
Docker took sole charge of Bontharambo.
He was associated with his father in pastoral pursuits on
Bontharambo during most of the pioneering period, and to
him must be given due credit for many of the great im-
provements carried out. His reminiscences of the early
days of settlement in the North East as set down by him
and preserved by the family, make interesting reading. He
records that with the finding of gold at Beechworth, the
price of cattle rose from £1 to £l2 per head, and that the

supplying of cattle to the local butchers was the hardest
twelve months' work he ever experienced, as he had to
start mustering at 5 a.m., take the cattle to Beechworth, and
get back to the station about 1 o'clock the next morning.
All sales were on a cash basis and as there were no banks
at Beechworth, he often had £SOO in cash to take home.
The goldfield at this time was teeming with bad characters,
many of them ex-convicts, and as a great number of rob-
beries and murders were being committed, Mr. Docker used
to take the precaution of leaving the road after departing
from the mining camp, and riding through the bush, some-
times guided by the stars and sometimes trusting to his
horse.
Hubert Spencer Docker
of Bontharamho
He gave special attention to land improvement and farm-
ing operations, the latter being principally confined to the
additional 4,000 acres purchased by his father in 1858,
which was developed to a high state of production. To-
gether with his brother, John, he engaged in horse-breeding
on an extensive scale, and imported the first American
trotting stallion, Daniel Boone, into Australia.
He took much interest in local matters during his long
association with the Wangaratta district, particularly in
pastoral and agricultural matters, being for nineteen years
president of the Ovens and Murray Agricultural Society.
He made many trips abroad, visiting Great Britain, Europe,
the United States and Asia, and during his travels he always
studied the pastoral and agricultural methods of the coun-
tries he visited; he also travelled extensively in Northern
Queensland, inspecting stations, especially in the Gulf
country.
Frederick George Docker married at Beechworth, in
1878, Alice, daughter of Robert and Margaret Gregory, of
Frederick George Docker

Station, Wangaratta, Victoria, 17th June, 1846, and edu-
cated at Geelong and Melbourne C. of E. Grammar Schools,
being captain of the football team and the first cricket
Eleven at the latter school. After gaining experience on
the family property, he entered into partnership with his
brother, Frederick George, on Bontharambo Station (which
lasted until 1883), and was closely associated with him in
the many improvements on the estate. When the partner-
ship was dissolved, John Bristow Docker took over Myrrhee
Station, on the King River, which had originally been pur-
chased from Mr. Chisholm, and remained there until his
death. He also had Thule Station, Cobar, New South
Wales, which was managed by his two sons, Frederick
George and John Bristow.
He took an active interest in sport, and was associated
with his brother, Frederick George, as one of the founders
of the Wangaratta Cricket Club, of which he was captain
for some years, and played against one of the old-time
English Elevens. Keenly interested in racing, he took part
in the earliest race meetings in the district—the first was
held on Bontharambo—and was a promoter of the Wanga-
ratta Turf Club; also one of the original trustees of the
Wangaratta Race Course, and for some time sole trustee.
He took an active interest in the Ovens and Murray Agricul-
tural Society from the time of its inception, and was for
many years a member of its official committee. A keen sup-
porter of the Wangaratta District Hospital, he was its first
president, and was for some years councillor and president
of the North Ovens Shire.
He married, Ist June, 1869, Elizabeth Keeton Gregory
(twin sister of his brother, Frederick George Docker’s,
wife), who was born 16th August, 1846, and died at
Myrrhee Station, Wangaratta, 3rd July, 1928.

Mary Jane Docker married secondly James Charles Read,
pastoralist, and had issue by him, three sons and three

SARAH JOSEPHINE DOCKER was born at Clifton,
Windsor, New South Wales, in 1834. She married James
Lindsay Brown, of Gooramadda Station, near Wahgunyah,
Victoria, who was born in Yorkshire, England, 24th Decem-
ber, 1812, and came out to Australia, arriving in Sydney
in March, 1839, and overlanding to Port Phillip in the
same year, accompanied by his friend, Thomas Clarke
(later ot Brimin Station), with whom he made the voyage
from England. They crossed the Murray where Albury is
now situated, and proceeding about thirty miles further
down the river, took up Gooramadda Station, 36,000 acres,
near Wahgunyah, Victoria, which they held in partnership
until 1851, when the whole station was taken over by
Mr. Brown.
When Gooramadda was taken up, the blacks were numer-
ous, but there is no record of any trouble with them; no
doubt Mr. Brown followed the example of his father-in-law,
Rev. Joseph Docker, and treated the aborigines fairly. Even
the bushrangers held Mr. Brown in respect, as will be shown
by the following anecdote.
Mr. Brown’s three nephews (sons of his wife’s sister,
Mrs. Whitehead), while searching for their uncle’s missing
cattle, were held up by the bushranger, Morgan, who re-
lieved them of what money and other valuables they carried,
but on Morgan finding out that they were nephews of Mr.
Lindsay Brown, he returned the money, etc., at the same
time informing the lads where the missing cattle were to be
found, and remarking that Lindsay Brown never refused a
swaggie a meal.
James Lindsay Brown became one of the most prominent
men in the district, for which he worked unceasingly. He
was the first to plant a vineyard in what has become the
well-known wine producing district of Rutherglen, was a
member of the first district Agricultural Society, Roads
Board, and Masonic Lodge, and subscribed towards the
building of the first Church of England. His name is
perpetuated in Browns Plains, near Rutherglen, which was

Read of Cargarie and Springhurst
George Frederick read of Cargarie
and Borhoneyghurk Stations, Victoria, was born in
Hobart Town, Van Diemen’s Land, 17th March,
1817, and when nineteen years of age, was sent by his
father to Port Phillip, to take up a squatting run in what is
now the Geelong district. He crossed the straits in the
" John Dunscombe,” taking with him 675 sheep, and
arrived at Point Henry on sth May, 1837. After resting
George Frederick Read, of C argarie
the sheep at Dr. Thomson’s station, Kardinia, he proceeded
to the run at Modewarre, which he reached on 21st May,
having lost one hundred of his sheep on the voyage from
Launceston and the journey to the station.
In an excellent diary kept by Mr. Read from the time he
arrived until 1851, there are many interesting sidelights on
the early settlement of Port Phillip. Hardly a week passed
during the first two or three years without some entry being
made about lost sheep, bullocks or horses, and descriptions
of long and arduous searches in all weathers for the stray-
ing stock.
The chief difficulty confronting Mr. Read seems to have
been the scarcity of reliable men offering for the position
of shepherds, as constant watch had to be kept over the
stock, owing to the absence of fences and the prevalence of
wild dogs and marauding blacks. In his diary Mr. Read
states that it was due to the carelessness of the men em-
ployed by him that much stock was lost. On 2-tth July,
]839, he writes: —
"Smith the bullock driver got so intoxicated as to lose
the bullocks. ... I gave him to the constables, who took
him to the watch house for the night.
Helen Read (nee Patterson)
The following day he states; —
"Smith was taken before Captain Fyans today and
put in the stocks for four hours."
Another entry on 28th August, 1839, reads:—
"... the shepherd left his sheep in the yard until
8 o’clock, and when I told him to take them our, he
replied if I was in a hurry, I might wait until it was
over, and used the most abusive language, in consequence
of which I ordered him out of the hut. ... He refused
to appear before the magistrates and also to quit the
place.”
Two or three days later he records that a warrant was
obtained for this man’s arrest, but it appears that he inter-


viewed Mr. Read and expressed his regret for what had
happened. He appeared before the magistrates and was
sentenced to the forfeiture of a month’s wages and four
months’ imprisonment, but on Mr. Read’s intercession, the
latter part of the sentence was remitted.
Wages for station hands at this period certainly did not
err on the high side, as Mr. Read records in July, 1839,
that he engaged a man of the name Binns at the rate of
£36 per annum, adding: "a most enormous sum, but men
cannot be had for less.” From Mr. Read’s records we find
that included among the neighbouring squatters were such
well-known pioneers as George Armytage, Junior, George
Russell, Thomas Ricketts, John Norman MacLeod, Junior,
Atkinson, von Stieglitz, Captain Hepburn, Joseph Suther-
land, the Yuille Brothers, the Manifolds and Dr. John
Thomson. The last mentioned pioneer appears to have been
one of his closest friends.
In 1839, Mr. Read’s wool clip, which was sold to Strachan
and Company, realised £523, the average for clean wool
being 17-|d. Another interesting entry in his diary shows
that he, with George Armytage, Junior, Mr. Ricketts and
others, took part in the search for the explorers, Gellibrand
and Hesse, and he describes how, during the search, they
dispersed a mob of blacks and found the remains of a
pocket book, a night cap, breeches and other things answer-
ing the description of those worn by Mr. Gellibrand. He
also mentions that they were told by a native whom they
captured that two white men had been killed, but they
were unable to elicit any information as to where the bodies
had been concealed.
In 1837 he intended to erect a homestead at the Mode-
warre run, but in November of that year, having heard of
a good extensive run some miles north of Modewarre, on
the Yarrowee and Cargarie Creeks, near Meredith, he de-
cided to purchase, naming the run Cargarie, and erected a
temporary homestead of wood thatched with bark. The
property comprised 23,710 acres, and was held by the Read
family until 1859, when it was sold to Alexander McGil-
livary. In 18-49 Mr. Read acquired Borhoneyghurk West
Station, on the Moorabool River, near Meredith, and this
he held until the latter end of 1853, when it was purchased
by his brother-in-law, Captain Alexander John Smith, R.N.
In January, 1851, he entered into partnership with John
Norman MacLeod, Junior, in Koroit Station, 8,000 acres,
near Coleraine, but sold his share in the following year to
Alexander Patterson, father-in-law of both Mr. Read and
Mr. McLeod. His father also, in 1845, purchased a property
of 787 acres at what is now Belmont, Geelong, naming it
Terona, and putting it under entail for his son, Alexander
Read, subject to certain conditions.
Mr. Read was a Justice of the Peace, and in his records
we find that on several occasions he adjudicated on land
matters in conjunction with Captain Fyans; also he was one
of the earliest members in the Geelong City Council. Mr.
Read took part in many of the historical episodes of the
early life of the Port Phillip settlement; in 1840 was a
member of the committee which presented a petition to
Sir George Gipps regarding the best means of suppressing
the aboriginal outrages, and on 6th June, 1843, he attended
a meeting which was addressed by the Rev. J. D. Lang,
D.D., the first representative of the Port Phillip district in
the Legislative Council of Sydney, and who afterwards took
a prominent part in the movement for separation. He also
mentions having attended services by many early Pres-
byterian ministers, notably Rev. Forbes and Rev. Hastie.
He married Helen, daughter of Alexander Patterson,
solicitor, of Van Diemen’s Land, Sydney and Geelong, and
his wife, Agnes Wallace.
George Frederick Read died at Cargarie, Victoria, 26th
February, 1854, having had issue, two sons and one daugh-
ter, of whom we now treat.
The elder son,
GEORGE FREDERICK READ, b. "Cargarie,” Vic., 23rd
May, 1850; d. 20th Oct., 1850.
The younger son,
ALEXANDER READ, of Lawaluk, Victoria, was born
28th December, 1853, and educated at Geelong C. of E.
Grammar School and Melbourne C. of E. Grammar School.
He chose a pastoral career and gained experience on a
Queensland station owned by Mr. Donald S. Wallace, of
Balark, Morrisons, Victoria. Returning to Victoria about
1878, he settled on a property, Terona, Geelong, about 800
acres, which he had inherited under entail from his father;
this property was sold to a syndicate for subdivision pur-
poses in 1888, and is now the Belmont suburb of Geelong.
Mr. Read then purchased "Fernleigh,” a property on the
Barwon, where his daughters now reside. He also owned
Lawaluk pastoral estate at Mount Mercer, which he held
until his death.
He married firstly Georgianna Anne (born 26th July,
1852), third daughter of Dr. John Anthony Moore, of
New Norfolk, Tasmania, who arrived in Hobart Town in
1843. She died in England, 23rd December, 1889, having
had issue;—

The only daughter of George Frederick and Helen Read:

August, 1851, and married Captain Frederick Bowdler
Gipps, of the 35th (Royal Sussex) Regiment. She died in
1932, having had issue, four sons, (i) Henry Brook Law-
rence, Lieut.-Col.; (ii) George Plumtre; (iii) Gilbert
Frederick; (iv) Horace Bridges; and four daughters, (i)
Elaine Constance, (ii) Violet Auberyella, (iii) Isabel Helen
Winifred, (iv) Estelle Josephine Beatrice.
JAMES CHARLES READ of Springhurst Station,
Victoria, was born at Newtown, Hobart I own, Van
Diemen’s Land, 19th January, 1834. He commenced his
education at a school in Hobart and at the age of fourteen
was sent to England to finish his education at Dr. Butler s
School in Brighton, Sussex. On his return to Tasmania,
he was for a short period in a lawyer s office; the law as a
career did not appeal to him, and he came over to Victoria
in 1852 and joined his brother-in-law, Mr. W. R. Looker,
who was manager for Mr. J. R. Murphy, of Colbinabbm
Station, near Rochester, to gain pastoral experience.
After being with his brother-in-law for about four years,
Mr. Read purchased Boorumboot Station, near Rochester,
Mary Jane Read (nee Docker)
from Messrs. Daly and McWhirter, and sold it two years
later to Denham Brothers. He then acquired Wahgunyah
Station, 30,000 acres, on the Murray River, from Power
and Rutherford, and admitted to partnership Mr. H. J.
Younger, a member of the well-known brewing family of
that name in Edinburgh, but in 1866 Mr. Younger returned
to Scotland and purchased the Abbey Brewery in Edinburgh.
Mr. Read then carried on alone at Wahgunyah, but this
station being later cut up for free selection, he acquired a
portion of Bontharambo Station in 1867, on which he
built a homestead, renaming the portion occupied by him
"Springhurst. ' This property ran from 20,000 to 30,000
sheep, but was also subsequently cut up for selection, Mr.


Read retaining only the homestead portion, about 2,000
acres.
In 1879, in partnership with David Evans, Mr. Read
leased Bedooba Station, Cobar, New South Wales, from the
Government. This was not a very successful venture, as it
was in a drought-stricken area, and much money had to
be spent in improvements, such as reservoirs for water.
Owing to the rabbit pest, it was necessary to wire-net the
whole station, and after this had been done the Government
resumed half of the estate. He gave over the management
of Bedooba to his son, John Docker Read, in 1893, and
lived at Springhurst until 1904, when he leased it to his
son, John Docker Read, and retired to live in Wangaratta.
James Charles Read was a Justice of the Peace for New
South Wales and Victoria. The following occurs in an
obituary notice in the Wangaratta "Chronicle”;—"He was
one of the best class of pioneer and was held in the highest
respect throughout his long residence in the State.”
He married, 30th May, 1860, Mrs. Mary Jane Clarke,
eldest daughter of the Rev. Joseph Docker, of Bontharambo
Station, Wangaratta (see Docker family records in this
volume). Mrs. Read (nee Docker) was born 27th June,
1828, at sea, on board the ship "Adam,” in which the
Docker family was voyaging to Australia, and when the
Rev. Joseph Docker overlanded from New South Wales to
Victoria in 1838, she, then a child of ten, was one of the
party, and it is claimed that she was the first white child to
cross the Murray. Brought up in a pioneering atmosphere,
Mrs. Read was one of that band of pioneer women who
played such a notable part in the settlement of Port Phillip.
She was a typical squatter’s wife, always willing to help
others, upholding the fine traditions of the home life of her
own people. She died at Wangaratta, 10th February, 1923.
James Charles Read died at his residence, "Narrakree,”
Wangaratta, sth June, 1905, having had issue, three sons
and three daughters, of whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
GEORGE FREDERICK READ, b. 1863; d. 1868.
The second son,
JOHN DOCKER READ, was born at Wahgunyah, Vic-
toria, 12th August, 1865, and educated at Geelong C. of E.
Grammar School. He took up a pastoral career, and gained
his first station experience with his uncle, Frederick George
Docker, at Bontharambo Station. Here he remained for
about a year, and in January, 1886, he joined his father on
Bedooba Station, Cobar, and took over the management in
1893, remaining there until 1904, in which year he took
over the family property, Springhurst, where he resided
until his death, working it as a sheep property, and estab-
lishing a stud of pure Jersey cattle. Springhurst Jerseys have
made good records under the Government Herd Tests for
stud cattle.
He was a director of the Springhurst District Dairy Com-
pany, and a Justice of the Peace for New South Wales and
Victoria.
John Docker Read married, 12th June, 1893, Mabel
Sophia, fourth daughter of William Robinson, late Comp-
troller of the State Savings Bank of Victoria, and died at
Melbourne, 13th November, 1939, having had issue;—

CAPTAIN GEORGE FREDERICK READ was born in
London, 29th September, 1788, and was for some years in
the service of the Hon. East India Company. He left this
service in 1808 and became master and part owner of a
small brig called the "Lynx,’’ which he sailed from Bom-
bay to Sydney, New South Wales, and later to Hobart
Town, Van Diemen’s Land. It is of interest to note that
he sailed his ship through the Torres Straits on the voyage
from India and was one of the first to navigate those
dangerous waters. He obtained a grant of land in New
South Wales, right in the heart of where the city of
Sydney now stands, and also a grant in Hobart Town,
Van Diemen’s Land. He became a merchant, and also
traded with his own ships between those two ports. It is on
record that he was living in Hobart Town in 1812 and
received rations from the Government Depot—this in com-
mon with all the rest of the inhabitants of the Colony (then
a part of New South Wales), numbering less than one
thousand people.
George Frederick Read never liked the Sydney climate,
and quite early took up his permanent residence in Hobart
Town and established the mercantile firm of Read and
McLachlan, which later became Read and Bethune, on the
retirement of McLachlan. Mr. Read owned several ships

and carried on trade with India, China and the East Indies
for many years; one of his sons, Henry E. B. Read, sailed
on r number of these voyages.
Mr. Read was a prime mover in the establishment of the
Van Diemen s Land Bank, and became one of the first
directors. He also acquired quite a number of properties in
Van Diemen's Land, viz., "Redlands,” on the River Plenty,
Tvanhoe” and "Kinvarra,” further inland, near the Der-
went River, Seton,” at Richmond, and "Thornhill,” at
Sorell. Redlands is of special interest, as it was probably
the first Government grant in Van Diemen’s Land. It was
on this property that the Read family established the famous
Salmon Ponds.

March, 1816, at St. Phillip’s, Sydney, Elizabeth Driver

1825, Margaret (born 1800), daughter of John Terry, of
Askrigg, Yorkshire, England, and later of Van Diemen’s
Land, factor to the Duke of Leeds and a cotton and flour
mill owner in England. He arrived in Sydney by troop
ship in 1819, bringing with him two men servants, a milling
plant and provisions. He received a grant of land at
Parramatta, but later had this grant transferred to Van
Diemen’s Land, where he took up his residence. Besides
the grant of 1,200 acres in Van Diemen’s Land, on which
he built a fine house, which he named "Askrigg,” he was
also granted 100 acres for the erection of a flour mill and
also water rights on the Lachlan River, New Norfolk.

k./
Currie of Larra
TORN LANG CURRIE, of Larra, was born at
I Howford, Ettrick, Selkirkshire, Scotland, 17th Novem-
J ber, 1818, educated at Selkirkshire Grammar School,
and before leaving Scotland, gained valuable experience in
sheep breeding. His decision to settle in Victoria was no
doubt influenced by hearing accounts of his cousins, Thomas
and William Lang, who had come out to Port Phillip in
1839, and were grazing sheep on a run on the Saltwater
River, near Melbourne.
not named until after purchase, when, as it became com-
pulsory to give each run a name, they first of all chose
Geelengla, but shortly afterwards changed this to Larra, the
native word meaning a spring. Ihe following is the story
of the purchase of Larra; —One day in 1844, John Lang
Currie arrived at the station (then owned by James Kin-
ross) with a view to purchasing the property. He had
ridden from the Lang’s property at Bunninyong, and found
that Kinross had given the offer to a buyer, Duncan Hoyle,
John Lang Currie,
of Larra.
On arrival in Port Phillip in 1841, John Lang Currie
joined his cousins and was in partnership with them at
Saltwater River and later at Bunninyong (see Lang family
records in this volume), until shortly before he acquired
the right of run of Larra Station.
In 1844 he entered into partnership with Thomas Ander-
son in the purchase of what was later known as Larra run,
32,000 acres, near Lismore, from James Kinross. It had
been portion of runs taken up by John and Thomas Brown
in 1840, known as Mount Elephant No. 1 and Mount
Elephant No. 2. These included what is now known as
Larra, Gala, Titanga, Ettrick and Poligolet. The station was
Louise Currie
(nee Johnston).
who was coming from Geelong to inspect. This offer held
good until noon the next day, but Mr. Hoyle, through some
mishap, did not arrive at the appointed hour, so Kinross
extended the time to 4 p.m.; there was no appearance of
Hoyle at the end of the extension, and Mr. Currie’s offer
was accordingly accepted. Just as the deal was completed,
Mr. Hoyle arrived on the scene.
The stock and plant on the run consisted of 1500 sheep
and lambs, four working bullocks, a dray, one hundred
hurdles, and a shepherd’s watch box. The improvements
were three huts, one of which served as a homestead, one
for station hands’ accommodation, while the third was used


as a wool shed. After purchase, it was found that owing
to lack of water, five hundred of the sheep had to be sent
to Lang Brothers' run at Bunninyong for agistment.
Many people at the time doubted the wisdom of the
purchase of Larra, as there was no water on the surface of
the station, although it could be had by shallow sinking.
Lake Tooliarruc was a dry bed, and on Lake Colac trees
were growing far below the high water mark of today, but
within a year after the purchase, the springs burst to the
surface, and the water difficulty was at an end. It appears
that the purchase was made in the midst of a protracted
drought, as the first shearing only yielded 11 bales of wool,
which had to be washed at a water hole at the junction of
Munday s Gully and the main creek, the only water near
enough for the purpose.
The partnership in Larra terminated about 1848, Thomas
Anderson dropped out, and John Lang Currie became the
sole owner of the run.
He surmounted many difficulties, not the least being the
loss of the station hands when gold was discovered; even
the station waggon, which was returning from Geelong with
supplies after taking the wool to market, was abandoned
near Shelford, and the bullocks let loose. They were
eventually found and the waggon taken to Larra, the con-
tents being untouched. He was left with only the manager
to look after the sheep; this meant a night and day job,
as packs of dingoes were scouring the country. It was at
this time that he heard of the projected arrival at Port
Phillip of the immigrant ship "Marco Polo,” and he pro-
ceeded to Melbourne, went straight to the ship, and engaged
six Scottish emigrants, who did not desert him for the
diggings. Had this assistance not been obtained, the run
would probably have been abandoned.
Not being satisfied with the class of sheep taken over
with the run, he set to work to improve the breed, pur-
chasing a number of pure bred rams of the Macarthur
blood from Mr. Campbell, of Mount Hope; this was the
foundation of the Larra merinoes. At the Skipton Sheep
Show, the most important show in Victoria in the early
days, the Larra Stud rams were regarded as being on a par
with those of Ercildoune, than which no higher praise could
be at that time bestowed. In later years, Larra rams were
purchased by leading stud masters throughout Australia, and
many were shipped to New Zealand, South Africa and the
United States. In the seventies, the wool clip from this
property reached such a standard that it is doubtful whether
any other fine wool flock in Victoria could match it.
John Lang Currie ultimately acquired the freehold of
Larra station, and in 1850 took over Western Mount Ele-
phant run, 14,300 acres, near Darlington, and three years
later subdivided the property, retaining the portion known
as Mount Elephant No. 1. In 1886, Titanga Estate was
purchased and later on Gala Estate, all properties adjoining
Larra. He also had pastoral interests in New South Wales
and Queensland, including Telemon Station, at Hughenden,
in the latter State.
He gave particular attention to aboriculture, and upon
what was almost a treeless country, he established approxi-
mately 2,000 acres of eucalyptus plantations, which are now
a feature of the Western Plains.
John Lang Currie was one of the most outstanding
pastoral pioneers of Victoria, and his energy and sound
judgment can be best gauged by the fact that under his
supervision the sheep shorn at Larra increased from 616 l
in 1846, to 34,277 in 1879, on the same area of land. At
the time of his death, he was the proprietor of 80,000
acres, some of the best sheep country in Victoria, and was
running 100,000 sheep. He was also one of the pioneers
of the frozen meat trade, and a member of the Board of the
first Company formed for the purpose of exporting meat
to England.
He took a keen interest in local affairs; was the first
chairman of the Hampden and Heytesbury Roads Board,
formed in 1857, and a member of the Hampden Shire
Council, when it replaced the Roads Board; a Justice of the
Peace; a prominent member and Elder of the Presbyterian
Church, representing both Lismore and St. Kilda Parishes
in the General Assemblies; a Fellow of the Royal Geo-
graphical Society, and a Director of various companies,
including the Australasian Mortgage and Agency Company.
To quote from an obituary notice at the time of his
death, "He was one of the foremost and most notable of
that band of pioneers who have contributed to make this
Colony what it is. . . . His high, conscientious respect for
the rights of others, his liberality, his keen sense of honour,
and above all, his deep religious sentiment, were even more
prominent traits than a force of character, energy, and
sound judgment, which made him the successful man he
became.”
He married, at St. Kilda, Melbourne, 14th May, 1852,
Louise, daughter of James Stewart Johnston, one time mem-
ber of the Victorian Parliament. She died at "Repton,”
Toorak, Melbourne, 14th November, 1900.
John Lang Currie died at his town residence, "Eildon,”
St. Kilda, Melbourne, 11th March, 1898, having had issue
seven sons and four daughters, of whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
WILLIAM JOHN CURRIE, was born at Geelong, Vic-
toria, Ist May, 1855; educated at Geelong College and
Cirencester College, England; took up a pastoral career,

He was a member of the first exploratory expedition to
New Guinea. William John Currie died on 13th July,
1887, while on a visit to Japan. Unmarried.
The second son,
JOHN LANG CURRIE, was born at Geelong, Victoria,
21st May, 1856, and educated at Geelong College. He
gained experience under his father, and later entered into
partnership with his brother-in-law, Patrick Sellar Lang, in
the lease of Larra Estate from his father; the partnership was
The third son,
JAMES CEDRIC CURRIE, was born at Geelong, Vic-
toria, 10th July, 1860, and educated at Wesley College and
Melbourne C. of E. Grammar School. He studied the wool
industry at Bradford, England. Warmly regarded by a wide
circle of friends, he was keenly interested in Art, and was
considered a keen judge of antique furniture and china, of
which he was a notable collector.
James Cedric Currie married Mary Robertson (deed.),
daughter of John Mathieson, Banker, of "St. Leonards,”
St. Kilda, Melbourne, and died in London in 1907, without

carried on until the latter’s death in 1898. In 1901 Larra
was subdivided into two portions, Larra and Ettrick, the
latter portion going to Charles Sibbald Currie, while John
Lang Currie retained Larra, the homestead portion.
He carried on the family tradition in the breeding of stud
sheep, and became a noted Merino sheep breeder. His
knowledge in this direction led him to be in demand as a
judge at many shows throughout Victoria.
A prominent sportsman, he owned several well known
racehorses, including "Even Time,” winner of the Victoria
St. Leger in 1909, and "Captain White." Coursing was his
favourite sport, and for many years Larra Estate occupied
an important position in the coursing calendar, and here
the Commonwealth Stakes were run. He was a Councillor
of the Hampden Shire, which he first entered in 1898, and
on which he served for twenty-four years, being President,
1903-4, 1909-10, and 1916-17. A member of the Old
Geelong Collegians’ Association from its inception, he was
President in 1908.
He married Lorna Mary, daughter of Henry Box, of
Melbourne, and died at Larra Estate, Victoria, 27th July,
1935, having had issue;—■

The fourth son,
EDWIN CURRIE, was born at Larra Station, Victoria,
Bth July, 1862, and educated at Melbourne C. of E. Gram-
mar School, where he was a member of the school cricket,
football and athletic teams. Previous to entering on his
long pastoral career, he had two years commercial ex-
perience in a Melbourne office. His early pastoral experience
was gained on Queensland stations. When his father pur-
chased Titanga and Gala, Edwin Currie returned to Vic-
toria and became general manager of both properties; later
on, in partnership with his brother, Charles Sibbald Currie,
he leased Gala from his father. On the death of his father,
he inherited portion of the Gala and Titanga estates, and
with his brother, Sir Alan Currie, who also inherited a share
of these estates, he purchased Mount Elephant, the proper-
ties being run in conjunction for some time and then
divided, Edwin Currie taking the portion known as Gala,
where he was engaged in wool growing and the breeding of
stud sheep up to the time of his death.
Mr. Currie was one of the best known breeders of Merino
and Polworth sheep in Victoria, and was a well known and
successful exhibitor at the various sheep shows. Keenly
interested in sport, he played cricket for St. Kilda in senior
competitions, was president of the Victorian Country Cricket
League, and a member of the Melbourne Cricket Club Com-
mittee, also president of the Western Plains Cricket Associa-

Victoria, Ist August, 1866, and educated at Melbourne
C. of E. Grammar School, Trinity College, Melbourne Uni-
versity, and Brasenose College, Oxford University, where
he was awarded the John Watson Scholarship and gradu-
ated 8.A., with Honours in Classics. He studied Law and
was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple, London, and on
his return to Australia admitted as a Barrister of the Vic-
torian Supreme Court. He did not practise his profession,
but took up pastoral pursuits on the family property in
1894; when his father’s estate was divided in 1901, he
took a portion of Larra, naming it Ettrick, and built the
present homestead.
Charles Sibbald Currie married Estelle Murray, daughter
of Robert Murray Smith, of Toorak, Melbourne, and died
at Ettrick Estate, Victoria, 4th August, 1924, having had

The sixth son,
HENRY ALAN CURRIE (Sir Alan Currie), was born
at Osborne House, Geelong, Victoria, 6th June, 1868, and
educated at Melbourne C. of E. Grammar School and Mel-
bourne University, graduating B.C.E. He was contractor's
engineer under the Metropolitan Board of Works and later
took up surveying and engineering duties on Perth and
Kalgoorlie Water Supply, which was one of the greatest
undertakings of its kind in the world. On the death of his
father, he inherited portion of Gala and Titanga Estates,
and was in partnership with his brother, Edwin, in the
Mount Elephant property, which was purchased in 1900
from A. S. Chirnside. On the termination of the partner-
ship, all the properties were divided, Sir Alan Currie’s


portion, comprising 17,000 acres, was known as Mount Ele-
phant, and here he specialized in the breeding of Stud
Merino sheep and Shorthorn cattle. Portions of the estate
were sold at various times for Closer Settlement, and finally,
in 1920, the remaining 3,000 acres were purchased by the
Go\ eminent for Soldier Settlement purposes.
He then purchased his present estate, Ercildoune, 8,000
acres, one of the most beautiful and historic homes in Vic-
toria, built by the Livingstone Learmonth family, who took
up fhe run (it was then known as Burrumbeet) in 1838;
m 1872 the property was acquired by Sir Samuel Wilson!
Sir Alan Currie, of Ercildoune.
and sold by his trustees to the present owner. The building
of the present Ercildoune homestead was commenced in
1840 and not finally completed until 1858; it is built of
granite taken from a neighbouring hill, and the bricks used
were made from clay close to the site. It embraces the
features of Scottish architecture of the Earlston (Ercildoune)
district of Scotland. A stone from Thomas the Rhymer’s
Tower (Thomas the Rhymer, well known in Scottish his-
tory, was an ancestor of the Livingstone Learmonths), is
built into the wall of the house and fittingly inscribed.
Sir Alan Currie still carries on the Merino stud estab-
lished by the Livingstone Learmonths, founded on the
famous Forlonge blood (these Merinoes were really intro-
duced by Mrs. Janet Templeton, nee Forlonge), and in
addition a small flock of absolutely pure fine Merinoes
descended from the stock owned by King George 111, to
whom it was a gift from the King of Spain, and imported
into Australia by Captain Macarthur in 1797 from the
Royal Stud at Hampden Court. H.R.H. the Duke of
Gloucester, the Royal visitor at the Centenary of Victoria in
1935, was the guest of Sir Alan Currie at Ercildoune, and
during his visit was given the opportunity of shearing sheep
descended from the flock owned by his Royal ancestor, and
also assisted in the weaving of the fleeces into a rug at the
Returned Soldiers’ Woollen Mills at Geelong.
Sir Alan Currie, who was a gunner in the old Ruperts-
wood Battery of Victoria when at the University, proceeded
to England in 1915, and in October of that year was granted
a Commission in the R.F.A.; served in Belgium and France,
B. Battery, 91st Brigade; promoted Lieutenant, July, 1916;
transferred A. Battery; mentioned in Despatches, and
awarded Military Cross after the battle of Ypres; promoted
Captain, November, 1917; Acting Major, April, 1918;
served until the Armistice; demobilized, January, 1920,
with rank of Major.
He entered the Legislative Council of Victoria in 1928
for the Nelson Province, which he still represents, and was
Hon. Minister in the McPherson Government in 1929. He
was a member of the Hampden Shire Council for nine years
and President for one term.
A well known patron of the turf, and breeder of
thoroughbred horses at his racing stud at Ercildoune, he
has won a number of races during his turf career, including
the Grand National Steeplechase in 1915 with "Flash Jack, "
the Grand National Hurdle Race with ’’Berrinbo’’ in 1923,
the Onkaparinga Steeplechase in 1916 with "Flash Jack,"
and the Cup Hurdle Race in 1937 with "Bridge of Mar!"
He was chairman of the V.A.T.C. from 1910 until 1913,
and became a member of the V.R.C. in 1899; was elected
to the Committee in 1914, Vice-Chairman in 1920, and is
now Chairman, having succeeded the late L. K. S. Mackin-
non in 1935. Sir Alan Currie was created Knight Bachelor
in 1937.
He married Muriel, daughter of Albert Miller, of
"Whernside," Toorak, Melbourne.

Lang
THE pioneer members of the Lang family were Dr.
Thomas, WTlliam, and Gideon Scott Lang. Thomas
and William arrived in Port Phillip in 1839 and took
up land on Saltwater River, near Melbourne (William Lang
records that their first camp was made on the site of the
present ITemington Racecourse), and here they were joined
in 1841 by their brother, Gideon Scott, and their cousin,
John Lang Currie. This property was sold; the parties
mentioned in the Agreement of Sale were Gideon Scott
Lang and John Lang Currie, as Vendors, and Walter David-
son, William Risk and Andrew and WTlham Ewm, as pur-
chasers. This document is dated 20th March, 1843. The
purchasers agreed to hand over a small sum of money, the
price of a team of bullocks to be sold as soon as a fair
market offered, two puncheons of whisky containing ap-
proximately 266 gallons, which Gideon Scott Lang should
sell to best advantage, the balance to be left at interest;
also a Bill of Sale over 1700 sheep which belonged to the
firm of Davidson and Company. The boundaries of the
holding were very loosely described, and this afterwards
led to a dispute, which was eventually settled by arbitration.
The next station held by them was Heatherlea, near Bun-
ninyong, which they took up in 1842 in partnership with
their cousin, John Lang Currie, who, after he purchased
Larra Station, dropped out of the partnership.
The Lang brothers held Heatherlea until 1845, when they
took up the adjoining station, Narmbool, 22,842 acres, near
Bunninyong. Here they remained until 1846, when they
disposed of Narmbool to Hector Norman Simson. Thomas
Lang then proceeded to the Western District to look out for
a run. It appears from diaries in possession of the family
that the brothers intended to take up Argyle run, near
Casterton, but on arrival they found that the licence had
already been taken out for this station by John Mclntyre.
Hearing of two runs which adjoined, Moniboeng and Kent-
brush, with a combined area of 151,000 acres, situated at
Moleside Creek and Freshwater Lake, north of Cape Bridge-
water, for which licences had not been granted, they obtained
the licences for these properties and on them put the sheep
they had overlanded from Melbourne.
In 1849 the brothers disposed of the runs to John McLean
and went to Riverina, where they became the principal
landholders in that district, having among other properties
Eli Elwah, Wargam, Wanganella, Mungadal and Pevensey,
which they first stocked with cattle. The original name of
Hay was Lang’s Crossing. In 1850, Gideon Scott Lang
explored Southern Queensland in search of more property
for the partnership, and acquired a large area in the Darling
Downs. In the following year, however, the gold rush in
New South Wales broke out and it was found impossible
to get the necessary labour to carry on squatting properties
in Queensland, so that in 1853 the Lang brothers had to
overland all their cattle from Queensland to their Riverina
runs, a distance of over seven hundred miles. In the middle
fifties William Lang took a trip to the old country, but on
his return to Australia he found the pastoral industry in a
precarious position, and eventually the partnership was ter-
minated, William Lang taking Eh Elwah and VTargam as
his share, and Dr. Thomas and Gideon Scott Lang retaining
Mungadal and Pevensey.
We shall now treat of the three brothers individually,
in order of their arrival in Australia.
THOMAS LANG was born at Selkirkshire, Scot-
land, Bth April, 1816, and educated at Edinburgh University,
where he graduated in Medicine. He came out to Port
Phillip with his brother, William, in 1839 and formed the
pastoral partnership, details of which appear earlier in this
record.
After the dissolution of partnership, Dr. Thomas Lang
practised his profession for some time in New South Wales.
He married Anne Hall, and died Bth April, 1816, having
had issue:—
i. Andrew.
ii. Thomas, who was killed in action in the Great War.
i. Lilian, d. unm.
WILLIAM LANG was born at Selkirkshire, Scot-
land, 6th January, 1823, and educated at Edinburgh
Academy and Edinburgh University, where he gained a
Diploma in Agriculture. He decided to take up pastoral
pursuits in Port Phillip, which at that time was attracting
the interest of many Scottish families. His brother, Thomas,
who had graduated in Medicine, decided to accompany him
to Australia, and both these young men received the Free-
dom of the Burgh of Selkirk, their native town, prior to
their departure.
The brothers sailed from Greenock early in 1839, but
the ship was dismasted in a storm and had to return to
Glasgow for repairs. They finally sailed from Greenock


I y ;■
on 19th July, 1839 in the sailing ship "Palmyra,” 466 tons
register (Captain Peter Brown). In a diary kept by William
Lang during the voyage, he mentions that saloon passen-
gers’ breakfast consisted of hard fish and ham, colfee, tea,
half a little roll, and sea biscuit.
The "Palmyra” reached Port Phillip after three weeks in
port at Adelaide, on 24th November, 1839, and the Lang
brothers entered upon the pastoral activities already
described.
William Lang,
of Wargam.
When the partnership between the brothers was dis-
solved, William Lang retained Eli Elwah and Wargam
Stations, Riverina; the former station he sold to George
Fairbairn, but retained Wargam, which he held up to the
time of his death. He was one of the best known pastoralists
of his time, and it is on record that the first wool transaction
of Frederick Gonnerman Dalgety, the founder of the wool
firm of Dalgety and Company, was the sale of a few bales
of wool grown by William Lang.
He was married, 18th November, 1858, at St. James
Church, Sydney, to Theresa Jessie, daughter of William
Timothy Cape, who was born in London in 1807 and came
to Sydney with his father, a free settler, in 1822. William
Timothy Cape became one of the most distinguished school-
masters of the early days of the Colony, being appointed
Headmaster of Sydney College (afterwards Sydney Gram-
mar School) in 1834 at the age of twenty-eight, holding
the appointment until his retirement in 1858; he was also
appointed Territorial Magistrate in 1850, and was a member
of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for
Woolombi.
William Lang died in London, England, Ist January,
1877; his wife died in London, 1920.
They had issue, three sons and three daughters, of whom
we now treat.
The eldest son,
WILLIAM ANDREW LANG, was born at St. Kilda,
Melbourne, 23rd November, 1863, and educated at Clifton
College, Gloucestershire, England, and Oriel College, Ox-
ford University. He graduated M.A. and was called to the
Bar there, but the "call of the wild" proving too strong, he
returned to Australia in 1888 to take up pastoral pursuits.
His first experience was gained on an outback station on
the Murchison in Western Australia, and a year later he
went over to New Zealand, where he had another year s
experience on the land. He then returned to Australia, and
was on a far western station beyond the Darling for two
years. After visiting India and the old country, he intended
to purchase a property in the Hawkes Bay district of New
Zealand, but owing to the Australian Bank crisis in 1893, he
could not go on with the project, and went to the Western
Australian goldfields, where he remained for two and a half
years, and after another trip to the old country, returned to
Australia and purchased, in 1898, "Carlaminda,” Cooma,
New South Wales.
He married Alice Scarvell, daughter of kredenck Cape,
of Sydney, and died 13th May, 1940. Issue:

GIDEON SCOTT LANG was born in Selkirk-
shire, Scotland, 25th January, 1819. After leaving school,
he devoted a few years to commercial and banking life,
and later gained experience in sheep farming. Two years
after his brothers, Thomas and William, had settled in
Victoria, he decided to join them, and arrived in the Colony
in 1841. His cousin, John Lang Currie (later of Larra
Station), also arrived in the Colony in that year. The pas-
toral activities of the Lang brothers are set out elsewhere
in this record.
Shortly after his arrival, Gideon Scott Lang conceived the
idea of establishing a deep sea fishing company for the
purpose of trading dried or salted fish in exchange for tea
and sugar, but the project had to be abandoned.
Gideon Scott Lang was a man possessed of tremendous
energy, and during the time he was managing the stations,
he also prospected for gold and was associated with the
exporting of horses to India. He took an active interest in
politics of his day, and in 1856 was returned as a member
of the first Elective Assembly of New South Wales. One
of the most outstanding episodes of his life was his cham-
pionship of Garibaldi, whom, in 1859, he visited in Italy,
where he was guest of the Liberator. On his return to
London he sponsored the cause of Garibaldi and many of
his letters on this subject were published in the "London
Times” in I860; through this medium he succeeded in
arousing the sympathy of the people of Great Britain
towards the cause of Italian liberty.
He was one of the founders of the Commercial Bank of
Victoria and was associated with that institution for many
years.
In 1854 he married Elizabeth Jane, daughter of William
Cape, formerly Master of Sydney College. She died in
1871.
Gideon Scott Lang died in Sydney, 13th July, 1880,
having had issue, three sons and a daughter, of whom we
now treat.

Melbourne, sth December, 1855, and educated at Mel-
bourne C. of E. Grammar School. He joined the staff of

position of Branch Manager and Chief Accountant, but
later accepted the Assistant Managership of the Trustees,
Executors and Agency Company Limited, of which he
afterwards became Manager, a position he held until the
time of his death.
He married, 14th May, 1879, Alice Catterall, who died
at Brighton, Melbourne, sth June, 1919.

College, England. He studied medicine and took his degree
as Physician and Surgeon in Edinburgh, and in 1884 came

where he practised his profession until 1915, when he
retired and came to reside in Melbourne, where he acted

appointed Handicapper to the V.R.C.
Always keenly interested in racing, he bred many good
horses, among which were Key, Security, Tockimmili, Cross
Keys, Eotheringay, Westward Ho, and Maiden Erleigh.
He was known throughout Australia by his brilliant
articles on Stud and racing topics, which appeared for many
years in the "Australasian” under the pen name of "Teviot-
dale," and for the "Pastoral Review" under the pen name
"Fife and Drum." These articles were widely read through


out Australasia and England, and at the time of his death
the "London Times’’ in its issue of 13th January, 1924,
wrote: "His contributions to the 'Australasian’ under the
nom-de-plume of Teviotdale’ did much to maintain the
reputation of the paper as a standard guide of the Australian
racing man. With Dr. Stewart McKay and Mr. Ken Austin,
he, in 1923, edited Race Horses in Australia,’ a work
which for its excellence of production and thoroughness of
detail, has already become a classic in the sporting literature
of the Commonwealth.”

of the Hoofs,” and the other one of the Romance of the

"Sydney Mail,” under the pen name of "Napier
Lion.” The following appeared in an obituary
notice in the "Sydney Mail” of 28th May, 1924:
"In the history of aviation, his name will appear

Elder of Mindi and Kuruc-a-ruc
JOHN ELDER of Mindi Station, near Pitfield, Vic-
toria, son of William Elder, of Edinburgh, Scotland,
and his wife, Elizabeth Nairne (c. 1780), was the
founder of the Australian branch of the family. His eldest
son, William, came out to Australia as a youth with one of
his uncles, the Aitchesons, some years before his father
settled in Victoria. The Elder family were for generations
well known booksellers and publishers in Princes Street,
Edinburgh, and John Elder managed the business until the
latter end of the forties, when he sold out his interest and
his family (with the exception of his son, William, who
had already come to Port Phillip with one of his uncles).
In 1850 he took over Mindi run from Peter Hardie; it was
a property of 10,024 acres, on the Woady Yallock Creek,
adjoining Pitfield, and he held it until March, 1857, when
he sold the rights to Messrs. George Currie and Leonard
Lowe. Four years later he entered into partnership with
J. W. Wilson on Yairam Station; it was also known as
Frenchman’s, owing to having been first taken up by bred
Duvernay in 1837 (Duvernay also owned an hotel at
John Elder, of Mindi
came to settle in Victoria, where his brothers-in-law, George,
Nairne, and David Aitcheson, had settled at Kuruc-a-ruc
Station, near Cressy, in 1839- The name Kuruc-a-ruc is
aboriginal, meaning "the place of the frog. They came
out to Port Phillip about 1838, and together with the
Gardiner brothers and Robert Adams, acquired the run
from the Derwent Company; it was 34,140 acres in extent.
Mr. Adams dropped out of the partnership in 1844, and
two years later the Aitchesons acquired the Gardiners'
interest, and conducted the run until 1863, when their
nephews, the Elder brothers, took over the station. The
Aitcheson brothers died unmarried.
John Elder, of Mindi Station, was born in Edinburgh,
Scotland, and came out to Australia in the late forties with
Cressy, known as The Frenchman’s). The name was
changed to Yarima in later years. The property was one of
18,779 acres, situated near Cressy, and the partnership be-
tween Mr. Elder and Mr. Wilson lasted until 1867, when
the property was acquired by the former's son, John Elder.
After disposing of Yarima, Mr. Elder resided with his sons
until his death at Kuruc-a-ruc Station on 29th January,
1870.
He married at Edinburgh, Scotland, Mary Nairne
Aitcheson, a sister of the Aitcheson brothers, of Kuruc-a-
ruc; she died in August, 1875.
John and Mary Elder had issue, three sons and three
daughters, of whom we now treat.


The eldest son,

Victoria, was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1832, and
when a youth of about fourteen, accompanied one of his
mother's brothers (who had settled in Victoria, and was
paying a visit to Scotland) to Port Phillip, and took up
pastoral pursuits at his uncles’ station, Kuruc-a-ruc. In
1863, together with his brothers, he took over the station;
one brother, John, dropped out of the partnership in 1867,
and William and Nairne carried on until 1887, when the
property, which had been reduced in area by selection to
22,000 acres, was divided, Nairne taking one half, which
he named The Meadows, and William the other half,
which retained the name Kuruc-a-ruc.
He married Agnes Elizabeth Aitcheson, who died at
Ellerton Grange, Edinburgh, Scotland, 30th January, 1922.

pastoral pursuits on Kuruc-a-ruc Station, under his uncles,
the Aitcheson brothers, and later entered into partnership

THE founders of the Australian branches of this
family were John Hugh, Hugh, Allan, John and
Peter Macvean, of whom we now treat.
JOHN HUGH MACVEAN was born at Arihoulan,
Ardgour, Argyllshire, Scotland, 17th January, 1817, and
received his training as a pastoralist on his father’s estate,
Salachan and Inversanda, Ardgour. Deciding to settle in
Australia, he arrived in Port Phillip on 3rd August, 1841,
and took up country in the Wimmera, but the natives
proved so troublesome that after several encounters with
them, in one of which a shepherd was murdered, he
abandoned the run. His next station was Wardy Yalloak
or Frenchman’s, 17,882 acres, near Cressy, which he pur-
chased from J. Williamson in January, 1858. The following
year this station was subdivided into Frenchman’s and
Cressy, and included part of what was later known as
Strathvean Station. He took his brothers, Hugh and John,
into partnership in Wardy Yalloak and later sold his in-
terest to them and purchased, in 1862, Dunach Forest or
Mount Greenock Station, 63,360 acres, near Amherst, from
A. McCallum. In 1869 he sold Mount Greenock and pur-
chased Stony Rises Station, near Colac, and while there also
acquired Nypo or Brimin and Wonga Lake Stations, beyond
Horsham.
In 1870 John Hugh Macvean sold out all his pastoral
interests in Victoria and crossed to New South Wales, where
he purchased Thelangerin Station; Bootra (originally
Kootooloomondoo), 64,000 acres, on the Darling; and
Howlong Station, 100,000 acres, on the Murray. (Thelan-
gerin he sold to Mr. McFarlane, and Howlong to his eldest
son, Alexander.) He then purchased Ki Station, on the
Lower Murray, near Euston, which comprised Balinrung,
58,560 acres, and Rainding, 16,000 acres, and sold it about
1879 to his brother, Rev. Allan Macvean.
The next station acquired by John Hugh Macvean was
Tonga Lake, on the Paroo, in conjunction with Mark J.
Tully, and his last venture in station property was Ban-
chory, Queensland, in which he lost heavily.
He married at Geelong, Victoria, in 1842, Hannah (died
26th May, 1901), daughter of William and Anne Hill, of
Shropshire, England.
John Hugh Macvean died at his residence, "Hauteville,”
near Albury, New South Wales, 9th July, 1894, having had
issue, five sons and three daughters, of whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
ALEXANDER MACVEAN, was born at Geelong, Vic-
toria, Bth October, 1846, and took up pastoral pursuits,
gaining experience on his father’s property, Stony Rises,
and Mount Greenock. He then managed Thelangerin
Station until 1872, when he purchased from his father
Howlong Station, on the Murray. This station was greatly
improved during his ownership, and the quality of the flock
reached a high level. During Mr. Macvean’s residence at
Howlong, he was highly esteemed in the district for his
many kind actions. In 1911 he retired to live in the Wagga
Wagga district, where he had pastoral interests.
He married Jessie Davina, daughter of the Rev. David
Hunter Ballantyne, who was the first Presbyterian Minister
at Albury, and later of Brighton, Melbourne. Jessie Macvean

REV. ALLAN MACVEAN was born at Arihoulan,
Ardgour, Argyllshire, Scotland, 16th August, 1824, and
educated at Glasgow University. He studied for the ministry
of the Free Church of Scotland, and was licensed to preach
at Fort Augustus. At the age of twenty-eight he was
Catherine Macvean
(nee MacPherson)
ordained before the Presbytery of Paisley on 7th July,
1852, and on 4th August of the same year was advised by
the secretary of the Colonial Land and Emigration Office,
Westminster, that he had been appointed to the office of
religious instructor on board the ship "Marmion," to sail
from Birkenhead to Portland Bay, Victoria, his remunera-
tion for this service to be 'a free cabin passage with diet
at the captain’s table, but without wines or spirits, in lieu
of any other gratuity.”
The "Marmion,” 903 tons, Joseph Hadley, master (officers
and crew numbered 46, and 313 passengers, surgeon and
matron), sailed from Birkenhead on 28th August, 1852,
and made a direct trip to Portland, arriving there on 4th
December 1852; twenty-four people died during the
voyage.


After landing at Portland, the Rev. Mr. Macvean, then a
vigorous young Highlander, walked to Melbourne, breaking
the journey at Geelong, where he visited his brothers, who
held pastoral properties in that district.
For several months after his arrival in Melbourne, Rev.
Allan Macvean ministered to the spiritual needs of the
people of Williamstown, at that period a busy maritime
centre. Being a minister of the Free Church of Scotland, he
attached himself to that body in 1853, and organised what
later became one of the leading congregations of the Pres-
byterian Church of Victoria. In 1854 Mr. Macvean received
a call from the Presbyterians residing at Brunswick and
Coburg, and was inducted into that charge by the Rev.
Adam Cairns, D.D., and the Rev. Nish, D.D. Brunswick
at this time was a small bush township, and the Rev. Allan
Macvean’s first "church” was a blacksmith’s shop, the anvil
serving as a pulpit. He ministered at Brunswick for over
forty years, retiring in 1895 owing to ill health.
A great worker for the union of all the Presbyterian
churches in Victoria, his efforts were eventually crowned
with success, the negotiations being completed in 1867,
and in the General Assembly of that year he had the
gratification, as Clerk of the Free Church Synod, of reading
their last Minute, recording their resolution as a Synod to
enter the Union.
The Rev. Macvean was Moderator of the Presbyterian
Church of Victoria, 1880-81, and it was during his
Moderatorship that the first conference of all the Presby-
terian Churches of Australasia was held, with a view to
Federation, and he was a member of the first Council held
in Sydney, having the same object in view.
A theological scholar of high repute, he helped many
young divinity students with their studies before the
Church’s Theological Hall was formed.
Rev. Allan Macvean was also interested in station prop-
erty, having purchased Ki Station, on the Lower Murray,
near Euston, from his brother, John Hugh Macvean.
He married Catherine, eldest daughter of John MacPher-
son, of Nerrin Nerrin Station (see MacPherson of Nerrin
Nerrin in this volume) ; she died at Middle Brighton,
Melbourne, 30th December, 1898, ret. 70.

June, 1896, having had issue, three sons and seven daugh-

The second son,

Brunswick, Melbourne, 4th September, 1866, and educated

lineage
The Macvean Clan (also known as Macbean and
Macbain) originally formed a branch of the powerful Clan
Chattan. The Gaelic name of the Clan is Macßheathain (or
Son of Life). The Australian branches are descended from
a Macvean who crossed over from Skye to Argyllshire on
the Mainland about 1650 to take up the position of tutor
to the children of Cameron of Lochiel, and married Lochiel’s
daughter. A male descendant of this marriage married a
daughter of Maclean of Ardgour and became a tenant of
his father-in-law at Salachan House and Inversanda, Ard-
gour. Their descendant,
ALEXANDER MACVEAN, bom 25th June, 1785, at
Craikveachen, inherited the property of Salachan and Inver-
sanda, on which he depastured 8,000 sheep. He was con-
sidered a wealthy man at that period, leaving at his death
an estate worth £20,000. This Alexander Macvean of
Salachan House and Inversanda, Ardgour, m., 10th Feb.,
1812, at Achanellan, Margaret Cameron (d. 2nd June, 1858,

MacPherson of Springbank and Nerrin Nerrin
TOHN MacPHERSON of Springbank and Nerrin
I Nerrin, Victoria, was born in the Isle of Skye, Inverness-
J shire, Scotland, in August, 1798. Shortly before his
family decided to settle in Australia, he married, on 22nd
May, 1825, Helen Watson, the ceremony being performed
by the Rev. Dr. Hugh Meiklejohn, Minister of the Parish
of Abercorn, at Tron Church, Edinburgh. He accompanied
the family to Australia, arriving in Sydney by the sailing
John MacPherson,
of Nerrin Nerrin
ship "Triton,” 399 tons reg. (Captain Crear), on 28th
October, 1825.
John MacPherson remained with the family in the
Bathurst district for some time after arrival, but, previous to
January, 1830, he made application for a grant of land at
Limestone Plains, where the Federal Capital is now situated.
The only record we have of the consideration of this grant
is contained in a letter from the Colonial Secretary's office,
dated 10th September, 1831, to the Surveyor General, re-
questing that he furnish Mr. John MacPherson, or, in his
absence, the Rev. John McGarvie (Mr. MacPherson’s bonds-
man), with the necessary authority to select, prior to Ist
October, 640 acres of land, to be held as a primary grant,
but it is likely that John MacPherson had "squatted" on
this land some time before the grant was finalised by the
authorities, which in those days took some considerable time.
This is borne out by the fact that one of his daughters was
born at Limestone Plains on 27th January, 1830. He was
the first resident landholder at Canberra, and his wife was
one of the first, if not the first, white women to reside in
what is now the Federal Capital Territory, his children
being the first white children born there.
Helen MacPherson
(nee Watson)
Tradition has it that the grant was a reward for the part
John MacPherson took in the capture of a bushranger. The
property was named Springbank and is described in the
official documents as being situated at Canbury (Canberra),
Limestone Plains on the north side of the Molonglo River.
He also appears to have obtained a further grant of land
at Ginnin-ginnin-derra, near Canbury (Canberra) about
1838, but the Crown grant for this property was not finally
issued until 13th January, 1844, despite the fact that the
quit rent of £5-6-8 commenced on Ist January, 1839. The
Government Gazette of 13th July, 1836, published a notice
dated two days earlier concerning the sale by auction of
1,000 acres at Black Mountain, Molonglo River, in the
county of Murray. This was applied for by John MacPher-


son, and 990 acres was purchased at 5/- per acre. After
John MacPherson had settled in Victoria, he retained his
property at Canberra, which he leased, and in 1840 had a
license to pasture stock beyond the boundaries of location
in the Maneroo (Monaco) district, and also in the adjacent
Murrumbidgee district.
John MacPherson first came over to Port Phillip with
stock in 1839, and obtained a grazing licence. His name
appears in the Government Gazette of 9th September, 1840,
as having a licence to depasture stock beyond the limits
of location of Melbourne and Geelong districts, for the
year commencing Ist July, 1840. In the same year he held
what is described, in the Government Gazette of 11th May,
1841, as two roods of land in the town of Portland.
In December, 1841, John MacPherson took up what he
named "Springbank" Station, near Casterton, 25,000 acres,
and he held it for ten years, when it was sold to Samuel
Proudfoot Hawkins. During the period 1839 to 1842, John
MacPherson was going backwards and forwards between his
Port Phillip and Canberra (Limestone Plains) properties,
but, in 1842, he overlanded with his family to Port Phillip
and settled at Moonee Ponds, now a suburb of Melbourne.
The property by which this family was most widely
known was Nerrin Nerrin, near Streatham, in the Portland
Bay district. It was taken up by John MacPherson in August,
1846, and consisted of 52,027 acres of splendid land, which,
after improvements had been effected was capable of running
40,000 sheep. It extended from Streatham along Fiery
Creek for a distance of thirteen miles to Lake Bolac; the
name Nerrin Nerrin is aboriginal, and means "many
waters, referring to the Jakes within its boundaries, viz.,
Lakes "Oonah,” "Challicum,’’ "Nerrin,”and "MacPherson,”
which were the haunts of many species of waterfowl. It is
said that Henry Kingsley wrote part of his "Geoffrey
Hamlyn while on Nerrin Nerrin. This property eventually
became freehold and with additional purchase, its area was
increased to 62,000 acres, said to be the largest freehold
station in Victoria.
The next property acquired by John MacPherson was
Croxton, near Penshurst, which he purchased from Don
Kennedy; it had an area of 14,727 acres. It was subdivided
after his death, and in 1903 the first part of it was sold,
but the family retained an interest in the property until
1910.
John MacPherson had still another station in Victoria,
The Wilderness,” a subdivision of Koonong Wootong run,
which he acquired from Samuel Proudfoot Hawkins in
February, 1864, and sold to Charles Rowe in March, 1868.
John MacPherson was one of the early pioneers who came
to Australia with something more valuable than money—
farming experience, gained in a part of Scotland where the
rigours of climate and the barrenness of the country equipped
men to face the hardships which were the lot of the pioneer
pastoralist of Australia.
Amongst the successful pioneers of Port Phillip John
MacPherson occupied a prominent position. The Rev. John
Dunmore Lang, D.D., who toured the Port Phillip district
about 1845, writes in his book Phillipsland,” published in
1847: Mr. John MacPherson ... a successful colonist and
a highly experienced practical farmer.”
Nerrin Nerrin Homestead


John MacPherson resided during the latter years of his
life at Helena House, Nicholson Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne;

Wales, 2nd July, 1826, and educated at Dr. Dunmore Lang’s

tralia, his first charge being at Meredith and Lethbridge,

Hmeage
PETER MacPHERSON was born in 1769; farmer in
Skye, Inverness-shire, Scotland; married Catherine Mcßcan
(d. 1843). He decided to emigrate with his family to
Australia, and sailed from Leith, Scotland, in the sailing
ship "Triton,” 399 tons reg. (Captain Crear) ; the family
party consisted of Peter MacPherson, his wile, sons, John
(who was accompanied by his wife), Peter, Duncan and
Hugh, and daughters, Annabella, Lome Jane, Catherine, and
Margaret. The "Triton’’ reached Sydney via Hobart Town
on Friday, 28th October, 1825 (vide Sydney Gazette, 31st
October, 1825).
Peter MacPherson, with his family, first settled in the
Bathurst district, and later obtained a Crown grant of 640
acres in the county of Cook, adjoining Thomas Walker’s


grant, in the Wallerawang district. The application for the
grant was made on 26th May, 1828, and granted as from
10th October, 1828. This property, which was on the site
of the present town of Portland, New South Wales, subse-
quently came into the possession of the explorer, Lieut.
William Lawson, of Prospect.
Peter MacPherson, Senior, died at Solitary Creek, near
Rydal, New South Wales, 19th August, 1844, having had
issue:—
i. John, later of Nerrin Nerrin, of whom we treat in
the Australian section of this record.
ii. Peter, b. (c.) 1807, who, in 1851, being possessed
of cattle, obtained a grant of 100 acres on Honey-
suckle Flat, near Wallerawang, which he named
Spring Farm.
iii. Duncan, first settled at Portland, N.S.W., and in
1831 was promised a grant of 100 acres named
Honeysuckle Flat, at Solitary Creek, between
Rydal and Wallerawang, N.S.W., and Governor
Darling authorised him to take possession forth-
with, but the actual grant was not conferred until
eight years afterwards by Governor Gipps. This
grant is still in possession of the family. Duncan
MacPherson also had grazing licences in the
Lachlan district, and in 1848, the Government
Gazette gives Duncan MacPherson as holding
16,000 acres at Bogandillon.
iv. Hugh, b. (c.) 1818, settled at Portland, N.S.W., and
later took up grazing properties in partnership
with his brother-in-law, Henry Rotton, in the
Wolgan River district, north-east of Wallerawang,
and in the Rydal district. He also had pastoral
properties in Queensland, one being Gingan, near
Stanthorpe.

Templeton of Seben Creeks
JANET TEMPLETON, widow of Andrew Temple-
ton, a prominent Glasgow banker, decided, about 1829,
to settle in Australia, with her young family. At this
time the production of fine Merino wool was engaging the
attention of prominent business people in the old country
as a most promising field for capital investment. America,
as well as other nations, was among the competitors in the
race to replace Spain as the premier fine Merino wool
producing country. The British Government was concerned
at the prospect of having to be dependent on foreign sup-
party. The servants who accompanied her were George
Hays, Robert Muir, James Brown, Thomas Young, Catherine
Terrie, John Murray and Catherine McCormick. Besides
the sheep, all plant and utensils necessary for settlers in
this new colony were included in the ship’s cargo. The fore-
going definitely establishes the fact that the main credit
for introducing one of the most prized breeds of Merinos,
known as the Forlonge Merinos, into Australia must be
given to Mrs. Janet Templeton, who was entirely responsible
for initiating and financing the project.
Janet Templeton
of Seven Creeks
plies for this class of wool, and encouraged those about to
emigrate to Australia to specialize in the growing of it.
Mrs. Templeton, who was a lady of great vision and
business ability, became interested in the project, and before
emigrating to Australia, sent her brother, John Forlonge,
over to Saxony in search of pure bred Merinos. His wife
accompanied him, and after a rather adventurous trip, they
arrived at Liverpool with a shipment of Merino sheep.
She then chartered the brig "Czar,” seven hundred tons,
to make the voyage to Van Diemen's Land, and sailed from
the old country late in 1830. She was accompanied by her
children, William, Andrew, James, John, Agnes, Janet,
Marion, Caroline and Margaret; she also pursuaded her
brother, John Forlonge, and his wife and son, to join the
The vessel arrived at Launceston on Monday, 24th Janu-
ary, 1831, and Janet Templeton took up land near Campbell
Town, which she named "Kenilworth,” but shortly after-
wards decided to go over to New South Wales and settle
there. She took most of the sheep with her, but what were
left were the foundation of flocks for which the district is
renowned. It appears that she still retained Kenilworth, as
it is recorded that her daughter, Marion, who married
William Forlonge, resided there for some time after her
marriage.
Janet Templeton then settled at Parramatta, New South
Wales, but later took up a property near Goulburn, which
she afterwards sold to the Faith full family, and took up
another station, which was managed for some years by
William Forlonge, her son-in-law.


In 1838 she decided to overland to Port Phillip, and in
October of that year took up Seven Creeks Station, a
property of 70,000 acres, near Euroa, in the name of her
sons, James and Andrew.
Janet Templeton died at St. Kilda, Melbourne, in 1857.
Andrew and Janet Templeton had issue, four sons and
five daughters, all of whom were born in Glasgow, Scotland,
and came out to Australia with their mother in the brig
"Czar” in 1831, and of whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
JOHN TEMPLETON, became a surveyor; he died, un-
married, at Beaufort, Victoria, 12th April, 1870.
The second son,
ANDREW TEMPLETON, received his early pastoral
experience at Seven Creeks Station; he was engaged in
squatting pursuits all his life. He died, unmarried, at
Wangaratta, Victoria, in December, 1889.
The third son,
JAMES TEMPLETON, engaged in squatting pursuits
all his life; he, with his brother, Andrew, was his mother’s
nominee at Seven Creeks Station, from 1838 to 1851, when
it was taken over by William Forlonge. James Templeton
also held Hurdle Creek Station, 25,000 acres, near Myrtle-
ford, 1846-50, when it was purchased by William Forlonge.
James Templeton died, unmarried.
The fourth son,
WILLIAM TEMPLETON, was born 3rd December,
1828, and educated at The King’s School, Parramatta, New
South Wales. He first engaged in pastoral pursuits on his
mother’s station, Seven Creeks, but when the gold diggings
were discovered, he joined the gold escort corps and com-
manded some of the first, if not the very first, escorts which
brought gold to Melbourne in 1851. Two years later he
was appointed a Goldfields Commissioner by Governor
Latrobe, in which capacity he officiated at Maryborough and
Ballarat, and later became Warden of the Maryborough
mining district. In 1862 he was promoted Police Magis-
trate, and acted in that capacity in the suburban districts of
Melbourne until 1878, when his appointment was arbit-
rarily terminated after twenty-six years honourable service,
by the Berry Government, on 9th June, 1878, known as
"Black Wednesday,” when one hundred and thirty-seven of
the higher salaried civil servants, including Judges, Magis-
trates and Wardens, were arbitrarily dismissed. This action
by the Government of the day was in the nature of a
political move against the Legislative Council, and although
nearly all the officers concerned were soon after re-instated,
or compensated, this disgraceful act of the Ministry caused
much unnecessary hardship.
Instead of waiting for re-appointment, as many did,"
William Templeton decided to establish a business as
executor and agent, a novel business at that time, and soon
after conceived the idea of establishing a trustees and execu-
tors company on the lines of one at that time in existence
in South Africa. This was the first business of its kind to
be formed in Australia, and he had to surmount many
difficulties in the formation of the company. A special
Act of Parliament had to be passed to enable the company
to function, and it was eventually formed on 1 4th June,
1878, under the name of The Trustees Executors and
Agency Company Limited, the first directors being Sir
Charles Sladen, D. C. McArthur (Manager of the Bank of
William Templeton
Australasia), John Benn, James Balfour, and F. R. God-
frey, with Mr. Templeton as Managing Director. The com-
pany attained extensive dimensions under Mr. Templeton’s
guidance, and he retained the Managing Directorship until
his death.
He was also one of the foundation members and the first
Chairman of Directors of the Mutual Store.
Mr. Templeton took a keen interest in the municipal
affairs of Prahran, being a member of the Council, 1881-83
and 1884, and Mayor, 1883-84. He was also associated with
Doctor Strong in forming the Australian Church, and was
a member of the Board of Management.
He married Mary Anne, daughter of Frederick Barnes
Godfrey, of the Van Diemen’s Land Company, Stanley,
Tasmania, which was established in 1825. Her father died
when she was a child, and she was brought up by her
uncle, Colin Mackinnon, of Dalness, Evandale, Tasmania.
Mary Anne Templeton (nee Godfrey) died at Windsor,
Melbourne, 10th April, 1925.
William Templeton died at Windsor, Melbourne, 18th
September, 1890, having had issue:—
i. Colin, b. Avoca, Vic., 10th March, 1862. Ed.
Wesley Coll., Melb. Joined staff of Bank of Aus-
tralasia, 17th Feb., 1879, Williamstown Branch;
transferred to Head Office, 1881; later appointed
Sub-Accountant, then Acting Manager, Williams-
town Branch; Manager, Prahran Branch, and in


Feb., 1887, Manager at Broken Hill, the only
bank in the district. In June, 1888, he resigned
from the Bank's service and became confidential
secretary to Messrs. W. R. Wilson, W. P.
McGregor and William Jamieson, prominent
Melbourne investors, directors of Broken Hill
Proprietary Co., and other companies operating
on the Barrier, and station owners. During the
years he was connected with these gentlemen, he
qualified as a Chartered Accountant. The last of
his employers, Mr. Jamieson, died in 1926, and
Mr. Templeton carried on business as Chartered
Accountant and Auditor. In 1916 the Victorian
Government requested him to undertake the
Chairmanship of the Tramways Board, which was
formed to take over the Melbourne Tramway and
Omnibus Co.; he accepted, and occupied the
position for three and a half years. Under his
Chairmanship the Board made a profit of
£850,000, and a claim by the Board against the
old Tramway Co. resulted in a legal action in
which the Board was awarded £115,000 as against
£25,000 offered by the Company in settlement of
all obligations. At the end of his term, Mr.
Templeton was offered the permanent Chairman-
ship of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tram-
ways Board, but as it was a full time occupation,
he declined, remaining, however, a member of the
Board until 1935. Mr. Templeton is still promi-
nent in Melbourne business circles. Although he
has recently retired from the Chairmanship of the
Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd., he
is still a Director of that Company, and of

"Banking in Glasgow during the Olden Time,” Mr. Andrew

Scotland) in 1802, and held this position for twenty-seven
years. The following appears in the above publication: —
"He was a shrewd, sagacious man of business and had
been trained under Mr. Duguid of the Old King Street
Sugar-house, one of the original partners of the bank.
Mr. Templeton was also agent for the Edinburgh Friendly
Insurance Company formed in 1720 and the first of these
concerns in Scotland. In conjunction with Mr. Robert
Thompson, of Camphill, Mr. Templeton purchased the
outstanding debts of the Merchants’ Bank, which failed
some years previously. This turned out a good specula-
tion for the purchasers.”
Andrew Templeton died 15th August, 1829.

0liver of Broadmeadows
JOHN OLIVER of Broadmeadows Station, South
Australia, was a native of Roxburghshire, Scotland, and
arrived in Port Phillip in 1839- For about three years
after his arrival he was engaged in sheep grazing, first on
land on the Yarra Yarra, near Melbourne, and later at Deep
Creek, north of Melbourne. As the population of Port Phillip
grew, Closer Settlement was being rapidly developed, and
he was forced to look further afield for a larger area of
grazing property.
Accompanied by one man, John Oliver overlanded to
Adelaide, South Australia, and returning by a more southerly
route, found country which pleased him near the Victorian
border; here he took up an area of about 40,000 acres,
which he named Broadmeadows (this name was later
changed to Hynam). In this venture he took into partner-
ship William Brown, who was murdered by the blacks on
Ist July, 1845. Mr. Oliver then admitted to partnership
Adam Smith, and they carried on the property until 1856,
when Mr. Oliver sold his interest to Mr. Smith.
During the period when John Oliver was at Broad-
meadows, bushranging was rife, and on one occasion, when
he returned to the homestead late in the evening from work
on the run, he found that a favourite horse, saddle and
bridle had been stolen by one of the outlaws. Incensed at
being robbed, he went in pursuit of the thief, but was
thrown and severely injured when his horse, in the dark-
ness, fell over a tree which had fallen across the bush
track. The effects of his injuries compelled him to give
up active station management, and he retired to live in
Geelong.
He married Mary, daughter of Thomas Rutherford, of
Roxburghshire, Scotland. After his death, Mrs. Oliver
married, in September, 1864, Thomas Guthrie, of Rich
Avon (see Guthrie family records in this volume). She
died at "Redholm,” South Yarra, Melbourne, on 4th Sep-
tember, 1918.
John Oliver died at Geelong, Victoria, July, 1857, having
had issue three sons, of whom we now treat.
The eldest son: —
WILLIAM OLIVER, was born at Broadmeadows Station,
South Australia, 25th February, 1853, and received his
education first at Geelong College and then at Scotch Col-
lege, Melbourne. While at Scotch College he was a member
of the College Crew which rowed in the second race against
Melbourne C. of E. Grammar School in 1869. On leaving
school he went to Morambro Station, which was being
carried on by his father’s trustees, and received his early
experience under the manager, Mr. Donald Hay, later, at
the age of nineteen, becoming manager of the station, on
which he was afterwards joined by his brothers. They
William Oliver
became partners and carried on the station until 1875,
having improved it to such good account that it was then
running about 36,000 sheep and about 2,000 head of
cattle.
After leaving Morambro, William Oliver crossed over to
New Zealand to look out for suitable pastoral land. He
visited both the North and the South Islands, but decided
against settling in New Zealand, as he considered the sheep
inferior to the Australian breed, and also because he had
struck the land boom which occurred during the premier-
ship of Sir Julius Vogel.

About 1878, William Oliver, with his two brothers and
cousin, James Affleck (son of )ames Affleck, of Kybybolite
Station) acquired Melrose Station, about forty miles north
of Condobolin, New South Wales, a property of about 800
square miles, of which William Oliver became manager.
This property was partly unimproved when purchased, and
much work was done by the partners in fencing and putting
down water tanks and building dams. They held the
property until 1882, and at the peak period it was running
about 150,000 sheep.
Shortly after Melrose was sold, the three Oliver brothers,
David Affleck (son of David Affleck, of Mortat), and the
Smiths of Hynam, purchased Isis Downs and Avington
Stations, on the Barcoo, Queensland. These properties com-
prised 1019 square miles of partly improved land, and
shortly after the purchase came the great drought of 1884-
86, causing severe losses to the partners by depletion of
stock; however they held on, and when the drought broke,
overlanded 25,000 ewes from the Southern Riverina dis-
trict, New South Wales, only 900 head being lost on the
trip.
They carried on and improved the stations to such good
purpose that at one period the properties were carrying
somewhat over 300,000 sheep and lambs. After the sale
of Isis Downs and Avington, William Oliver had some
interests in Queensland pastoral properties, including Port-
land Downs Station. He was for many years inspector of
pastoral properties in Australia for the New Zealand Loan
and Mercantile Agency Company Limited, a position he
held until his retirement in 1910.
Mr. Oliver has been prominent in Victorian yachting
circles for about thirty-eight years, being a member of the
Royal Yacht Club of Victoria, of which he has been Vice-
Commodore for over fifteen years, and the Royal St. Kilda
Yacht Club. He owned and sailed the well known racing
cutter, "Hurrica” (the aboriginal name given to wind by a
Alexander Oliver
tribe of Barcoo blacks), which won several races in the
early days, and he has since owned four yachts of the same
name, one motor boat and three auxiliary ketches. His
present yacht, Hurrica V” is an auxiliary ketch of thirty-six
tons reg.
He married Margaret Robina, daughter of David Affleck,
of Mortat Station, Victoria (see Affleck family records in
this volume). She died at Queenscliff, Victoria, on 9th
February, 1902, having had issue;—
i. William Donald, b. Toorak, Melb. Ed. Geelong
Coll. Pastoralist.
i. Olive Margret, b. South Yarra, Melb.
ii. A daughter, d. in infancy.
The second son;—■
ROBERT RUTHERFORD OLIVER, was born at Broad-
meadows Station, South Australia, 26th October, 1854, and
educated at Geelong College and Scotch College, Melbourne.
He took up pastoral pursuits with his brother at Morambro
Station, in which he was a partner. He was also a partner
in Melrose Station, New South Wales, and Isis Downs and
Avington Stations in Queensland, and, with William Smith,
managed Isis Downs and Avington for some years until
they were sold.
When he retired from active pastoral work, he resided at
Mornington, Victoria, where he died on 11th November,
1921. He was unmarried.
The third son;—
ALEXANDER OLIVER, was born at Geelong, Victoria,
29th January, 1857, and received his education at Geelong
College and Scotch College, Melbourne. In his early life
he was a prominent athlete, being well known in boxing,
hunting, football and cricket circles, and was a playing
member of the Melbourne Football Club. He played in the
Annie Oliver (nee Robertson)


first polo match against an Indian team at the old Geelong
Showgrounds, his team including his brother, Robert Oliver,
George Synnot, and Colonel Appleton. Before the days of
motor cars he handled the ribbons behind a four-in-hand
with great skill, and when residing in London, drove his
four-in-hand to the Derby. Mr. Oliver was an enthusiastic
yachtsman, and owned the motor yacht "Rowena,” in which
he indulged in his favourite sport, deep-sea fishing.
After completing his education he took up pastoral pur-
suits, gaining experience on Morambro Station with his
brothers, William and Robert, with whom he later held
interests in Melrose Station, Condobolin, New South Wales,
and Isis Downs, Avington and Portland Downs Stations,
Queensland. He returned to Melbourne in 1895 and was
elected a member of the Stock Exchange on 16th September
of that year. He served on the committee of the Exchange
from 1896-99, and was re-elected in 1918, remaining a
member of the committee until his death.
He married Annie, daughter of James Robertson, of
Aberfeldie, Upper Keilor, and Campaspe River Stations,
Victoria. She died 12th July, 1906.
Alexander Oliver died at South Yarra, 21st February,
1925, having had issue;—

McKellar of and Knebsworth
THOMAS McKELLAR of Strathkellar Station,
Victoria, was born in Argyllshire, Scotland, 15th June,
1819- He came out to Victoria in 1848 and joined
his cousin, Dugald Macpherson (afterwards of Bungeeltap),
at his station, Ashens, in the Wimmera. The following year
he purchased Hyde Park Station, near Cavendish, in partner-
ship with James Cochrane, and, in 1850, acquired Mr.
Cochrane’s interest and continued to carry on the station
until 1858, when he sold out to Alexander McGill. While
subsequently handed over to his sons, John, Thomas and
James. Mr. McKellar made many visits to his native coun-
try, and purchased Lerags Estate, in Argyllshire, from his
wife’s cousin, J. B. Campbell, a member of the Campbell
family of Lochnell (see Lineage).
Thomas McKellar was one of the outstanding pioneers
of Victoria. He was a far-seeing man, and being possessed
of a natural Scottish shrewdness, calculated on every adverse
contingency before entering into any pastoral or other
Thomas McKellar, of Strathkellar
still holding Hyde Park, Thomas McKellar purchased, in
1855. Kenilworth North Station, also near Cavendish, which
he held until 1858. Having sold Hyde Park and Kenil-
worth Stations, he bought, in 1858, Kanawalla Station, near
Hamilton, from William Skene, and later purchased The
Grange and Croxton Stations, near Hamilton, re-naming the
former Strathkellar. Other stations owned by Thomas
McKellar were Reedy Creek Station, in South Australia, and
Raglan Station, in Queensland.
He paid a visit to Scotland about 1863, and on his return
acquired Tarrone Estate, near Warrnambool, which he
speculation, and his word, once passed, was his bond. He
was prominent in all charitable and patriotic movements,
and a zealous member of the Presbyterian Church. When
Scots Church sought a successor to the Rev. Dr. Strong,
Mr. McKellar, being in Scotland at the time, was appointed
by the Scottish Commission to select a minister to fill the
vacancy. Accompanying the Commission to hear the Rev.
Mr. Marshall (afterwards Dr. Marshall) preach at the
Parish Church at Inveresk, it is related that after the sermon,
he whispered to a member of the Commission, "I am weel
pleased wi’ Mr. Marshall.” His judgment was vindicated
by Dr. Marshall's outstanding ministry at Scots Church.


Thomas McKellar was a generous supporter of the
Hamilton Hospital, of which he was the first Vice-President,
and after his death, his four daughters presented the
Maternity Wing to the Hospital. He was a member of the
Victorian Legislative Council for the WYstern Province,
1870-75, a Justice of the Peace for Victoria, and a Justice
of the Peace for Argyllshire, Scotland.
He married at Geelong, in 1849, Catharine, daughter of

Ronald of Nap Nap and Nebea
ROBERT BRUCE RONALD of Nap Nap, was
born at Liverpool, England, 2nd August, 1831, and
educated at the Liverpool Institute. When he reached
manhood, he decided to settle in Australia, and arrived in
Melbourne in 1852. He found employment with the firm of
Dalgety, Gore and Company, and a few months later joined
the mercantile and squatting agency firm of Richard Gibbs
and Company, of which he became a partner in 1853, the
firm being known as Gibbs, Ronald and Company. The
purchased Pembury Grange, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in
1878, where he took up residence, and in the same year
was appointed to a seat on the London Board of the
Australian Mortgage Land and Finance Company, which he
held until his retirement in 1906, having been an active
member of the management of the company for forty
years.
In addition to his mercantile interests, Robert Bruce
Ronald was also owner of pastoral stations, being in part-
Robert Bruce Ronald, of Nap Nap
other partners in the firm were Mr. (afterwards Sir James)
Mcßain and Mr. R. B. Ronald's brother, Byron Lord
Ronald. In 1865 this business was sold to the Australian
Mortgage Land and finance Company Limited (now the
Australian Mercantile Land and Finance Company Limited),
£70,000 being paid for the goodwill. After the amalgama-
tion, Robert Bruce Ronald became the Geelong manager,
and in 1868 he and James Mcßain were appointed joint
managers for Victoria. In 1872, Mr. Ronald was appointed
manager at Melbourne; in the following year lie became
a member of the Melbourne Board, and in 1876 was ap-
pointed to the Australian Board.
In 1874, accompanied by his family, he returned to Eng-
land, and, after residing in London and Hartford, Kent,
nership with his brother, Byron Lord Ronald, and Richard
Gibbs in Mount Emu Station, a property of 40,000 acres,
near Skipton, 1864-68; he also owned Elderslie, 64,000
acres, near Apsley, 1870-79- Lie entered into partnership
with Peter McPherson in Paika Station, near Balranald,
New South Wales, and in 1887 purchased his partner's
interest, but in the following year sold the station to his
late partner, Peter McPherson. In 1890 he became a part-
ner in Nap Nap Station, Hay, New South Wales, with his
two sons, Robert Wilson and Angus Cameron, and in 1905
purchased Trinkey Station, Quirindi, New South Wales,
now held by his son, Angus Cameron.
He was largely interested in the Sugar River Estate, near
Mackay, Queensland, which included a sugar mill as well


as the plantation. He also owned a large cattle station,
"Wigagomric,” near Birdsville, Queensland, in the late
nineties.
Robert Bruce Ronald married, 29th August, 1854, Fanny
(died Pembury Grange, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England,

St. Kilda, Melbourne, and died at Pembury Grange, Tun-

In 1879 he joined in partnership with Alexander
Macqueen and Donald McPherson in Nap Nap Station,
Hay, which at that time comprised 266,000 acres freehold
and leasehold. In 1880, Mr. McPherson died, and Messrs.
Ronald and Macqueen acquired his interest. In 1890, Mr.
Macqueen died, and his half share of Nap Nap Station was
purchased by Robert Wilson Ronald’s father, and brother,
Angus, the firm then becoming known as R. B. Ronald and
Sons, Robert Wilson Ronald being managing partner. After
the death of his father, Robert Wilson Ronald and his
brother, Angus Cameron Ronald, purchased Trinkey Station,
Quirindi, in 1908, from their father’s trustees, and were
in partnership until 1931, when Robert Wilson Ronald sold
his interest to his partner’s son, Angus Bruce Ronald.
In 1913, when the Nap Nap pastoral leases expired, the
freehold portion was offered at auction to wind up the
estate of Robert Bruce Ronald. It was purchased by Robert
Wilson Ronald, Angus Cameron Ronald, and Robert Wilson
Ronald's eldest son, Robert Bruce Ronald, in partnership,
under the name of R. W. Ronald and Company.
Five years later, Angus Cameron Ronald sold out his
interest to the other partners. In 1922, Robert Wilson
Ronald’s son, lan Alister Bruce Ronald, joined the firm,
and in 1927 his daughter, Veronica Wilson Ronald (Mrs.

Calvert of Irrewarra
JOHN CALVERT of Irrewarra, Colac, Victoria, was
born at Ecclefechan, Scotland, in 1807, and at the age
of twenty-four, decided to settle in Australia. He sailed
in the ship Lord Lyndoch, and landed at Hobart Town,
Van Diemen s Land, in 1831, shortly afterwards taking over
the management of Captain Bell's farm at Blackman’s river,
where he remained until 1840.
Hearing good reports of the Port Phillip district, John
Calvert decided to take up land there, and on arrival in
He was one of the first magistrates appointed in the
Colac district, and it is on record that, in 1865, as Police
Magistrate, he presided over the first Court of Petty Sessions
held in Colac; his colleagues on the bench were Messrs.
H. Murray, D. E. Stodart and A. Dennis, Justices of the
Peace.
When John Calvert retired from active pastoral work, he
took up his residence in Geelong, where he erected a blue-
stone house known as Morongo, now the Presbyterian
John Calvert, of Irrewarra
Melbourne, proceeded to Lake Colac, where he entered into
partnership with John Bell in Irrewarra Station, purchased
from Captain Pollock, 68,280 acres, on the east shore of
Lake Colac. The partnership was dissolved in 1850, and
the property was subdivided into Irrewarra, Corangamite
and Watch Hill; John Calvert retained Irrewarra and
Corangamite, while John Bell took over Watch Hill. The
latter, however, only held Watch Hill for four years, before
selling it to John Calvert.
A prominent pioneer of the Colac district, John Calvert
established the well-known flock of Cotswold sheep known
as the Dreeite Cotswolds. The foundation of this flock was
formed in 1862 by the purchase of nine ewes, two lambs
and a ram, pure imported Cotswold sheep, from William
Lyall, of Harewood Station, Mr. Lyall’s foundation flock
being purchased in Carlisle in 1855. The Dreeite flock was
eventually sold in 1880, and was bought by Lewis Gordon
Calvert, son of John Calvert. He also established the
well-known Shetland pony stud at Irrewarra and a stud of
Shorthorns.
Ladies’ College in the Western District of Victoria. During
his residence in Geelong he took an active interest in Gee-
long College, of which he was one of the founders, and
was also a prominent member and an Elder of St. George's
Presbyterian Church. In 1866 he decided to take his family
to England for educational purposes, and took up his resi-
dence in London.

Affleck
WILLIAM AFFLECK of Pleasant Banks Station,
Victoria, was born in Fifeshire, Scotland, 15th
September, 1771. He was engaged in sheep farm-
ing previous to settling in Australia, and his ancestors, who
came originally from Auchinlech, Ayrshire, Scotland, had
been sheep farmers for generations.
In 1839, accompanied by his wife and family of live sons
and three daughters, he sailed for Australia in the ship
"William Mitchell,” arriving in Port Phillip in July of
the same year.
William Affleck and his sons came out to manage some
of the Marquis of Ailsa's stations in Port Phillip, and on
the termination of this engagement in 1842, William Affleck
took up land on the Saltwater River, near what is now the
Flemington racecourse. The family remained there only for
a short time and then proceeded to the Western District,
where William Affleck took up Englefield run, near Bal-
moral, a property of 28,000 acres, which he held for about
a year (1842-43), when he took up Nigretta, on the
Wannon, near Hamilton, 8,000 acres, and held it until
1845; in April, 1846, he took up Pleasant Banks Station, a
property of 42,000 acres, near Goroke.
William Affleck, during his twenty-five years’ pioneering
work in the VCestern District of Victoria, underwent the
tremendous hardships common to that band of men, prin-
cipally Scots, who must hold pride of place in the develop-
ment of the Western District, and he was ably assisted by
his sons, who, after his death, carried on the pioneering
work so well begun by their father.
He married, in Scotland, Anne Honeyman, and died at
Kybybohte Station, 9th August, 1863, having had issue,
five sons and four daughters.

i i St' ■
McEachern of Heathfield and Strathdownie
THIS family came from Morven, Argyllshire, Scotland,
and sailed for Australia in the ship "British King"
(Captain William Paton) from Tobermory, 28th
October, 1838, arriving in Sydney on Ist March, 1839. The
family consisted of Hugh McEachern, his second wife, Ann,
seven sons, William, Angus, Malcolm, Archibald, John
obtained employment elsewhere, all the family settled there,
the sons being employed as shepherds. In the early days of
the Colony, the task of watching sheep was an onerous one,
as, owing to the depredations of the blacks and the pre-
valence of wild dogs, the utmost vigilance was necessary
day and night. Captain Macarthur gave Hugh McEachern
Hugh McEachern
of Heathfield and Strathdownie
(known as Long John), Duncan, and John (known as
Little John), and four daughters, Johanna, Margaret, Cath-
erine, and Jane. (Little) John and Jane were the children
of Hugh McEachern’s second marriage. The other children
were of the first marriage of Hugh McEachern and Mary
Stewart.
Shortly after the family's arrival in Sydney, Hugh
McEachern secured employment from Captain Macarthur
(later owner of the famous Camden Park Stud), as manager
of Limestone Ridge-Station, near Yass, New South Wales.
With the exception of William and Archibald, who had
permission to cultivate portion of the run for his own
benefit, and the family took advantage of this opportunity
to improve their financial position by cultivating the land in
their spare time and on moonlight nights. By spade work
alone, seven acres were dug and sown the first year, and this
area was later considerably increased The result of their
industry in this direction during the seven years they were
at Limestone Ridge was the accumulation of over £7,000.
During the first two years they were on the station they
were visited by bushrangers, who commandeered food,
clothing, horses and firearms, and it was recorded that


nineteen of these desperadoes were accounted for in the
locality.
In 1846, Hugh McEachern and his family decided to
settle in Victoria, and overlanded in May of that year. They
took with them one hundred head of horses, an Arab stal-
lion, three hundred cattle, two bullock teams and two drays,
in which to transport their goods and chattels. For the
purpose of fording rivers and creeks they carried a large
number of empty casks on which to float the drays, and
a boat for transporting members of the family across the
rivers.
In August, 1846, the overlanders crossed the Glenelg in
the vicinity of the present Casterton racecourse. When they
set out from Limestone Ridge, it was their intention to
secure the licence of Rifle Downs run, as William McEach-
ern, who was then with Mr. MacPherson, of Springbank
Station, had advised them that it was available, but when
they reached what is now Casterton, it was found that
Richard Lewis had taken it over, so, in the following year,
Heathfield, 55,040 acres, near the South Australian border,
was taken up by Hugh McEachern and his sons. Archibald
McEachern rode all the way from Heathfield to Melbourne
in order to interview Captain Fyans, the Crown Lands
Commissioner, in connection with the licence. In 1853,
West Strathdownie, 28,000 acres, on the Glenelg, was ac-
quired, and William and Angus McEachern then joined
the partnership. Five years later, East Strathdownie, 39,324
acres, was taken over.
When the McEacherns took up the two Strathdownies
they were financed in part by Mr. Donald Mackinnon, of
Kaladbro, and, to illustrate the trust existing between the
pioneers from the Highlands of Scotland in those early
days, it is interesting to find in the McEachern family
records that "there was not a scratch of the pen to show
that the transaction had taken place, but every penny was
repaid.”
The partnership also acquired Kangaroo Station, a sub-
division of the old Crawford Station, near Hotspur. The
McEacherns prospered on their estates, and the cattle and
horses, which multiplied from the foundation stock taken
over from New South Wales, were well known by the "ME”
brand. In the fifties it became a problem what to do with
the surplus stock, so the firm opened two butchers' shops in
Portland, Angus and Archibald McEachern looking after
that part of the business.
Kangaroos increased alarmingly and at Morven Station
large yards were built eight feet high, and all the neigh-
bouring squatters and their men were invited to take part
in a kangaroo drive, which resulted in the capture of
thirteen hundred, but through an error of judgment, about
three thousand escaped to neighbouring stations.
During good seasons the stock on the McEacherns’
stations did well, and bullocks frequently weighed up to
nine hundred pounds and Merino wethers up to sixty
pounds. The average cut of wool was six pounds. This
was sent to Portland for sale, and realised from 6d, to IQd.
per pound. Horse breeding was also profitably conducted,
and in the early fifties one lot of a hundred from the
McEacherns’ stations averaged £25 per head.
In 1864, two years after the death of Hugh McEachern,
the partnership was terminated, and the properties divided.
William McEachern took over East Strathdownie; Archi-
bald, who took his share in cash, selected on West Strath-
downie; "Long” John also took his share in cash, and,
together with his brother, Malcolm, who had previously
retired from the partnership, purchased Knebsworth;
Duncan and Angus were allotted Kangaroo Station; and
"Little” John retained Eleathfield.
On the hundredth anniversary of the arrival of the
McEachern family in Australia, a reunion of the descen-
dants to celebrate the centenary was organised by Mr. Hugh
McEachern, of Nundi Estate, Tarcutta, New South Wales,
great-grandson of Hugh McEachern, of Heathfield. The
celebrations were held in the Casterton district, and over a
hundred direct descendants were present from Victoria,
Tasmania, New South Wales, South Australia, and Fiji. A
service was held at the family cemetery on Heathfield.
We shall now treat of Hugh McEachern and his pioneer
sons individually:—-
HUGH McEACHERN of Heathfield Station, Vic-
toria, was born at Morven, Argyllshire, Scotland, and was
one of the outstanding pioneer pastoralists of the Western
District of Victoria. As will be seen by the foregoing
general record of the family, he experienced all the vicis-
situdes of the early pastoral pioneers in Australia. Like
many of the early pioneers, he was a man imbued with
strong religious characteristics, his family having been
staunch members of the Church of Scotland for generations.
In addition to his pioneering work in Victoria, he was
responsible for the emigration of no less than thirty-nine
relatives from Scotland.
He married firstly, Mary Stewart, who died at Morven,
Argyllshire, Scotland, and by whom he had issue, six sons
and three daughters. After her death, he married Ann
Campbell, who died at Heathfield Station, Victoria, and had
issue by her, one son and one daughter.
Hugh McEachern died at Heathfield Station, 22nd March,
1862, ret. 86.


WILLIAM McEACHERN of East Strathdownie
Station, Victoria, was born at Morven, Argyllshire, Scotland,
10th January, 1814. On arrival in Sydney he was engaged
by Mr. John MacPherson, of Monaro Station, New South
Wales, and in 1840, overlanded stock for Mr. MacPherson
to Port Phillip, and settled on the Loddon River, near its
source, being the first settler in that locality. Here he re-
mained for a short period, and in 1842 again joined Mr.
MacPherson and was appointed manager of the latter’s
Springbank Station, where he remained for three years. In
1845 he returned to Sydney, but, the following year, again
overlanded stock for Mr. MacPherson to Port Phillip for
Springbank Station. About this time Mr. MacPherson had
taken up Nerrin Nerrin run, and William McEachern was
William McEachern
appointed manager, a position he held until 1852, when he
entered into partnership with his father and brothers in the
firm of Hugh McEachern and Sons; on the dissolution of
partnership in 1864, William McEachern took over East
Strathdownie Station, remaining there until 1877, when he
went to New South Wales and settled at Rosewood, Tum-
barumba district, in the following year, where he estab-
lished a new home and resided until his death.
Regarding the origin of Casterton, the following is an
extract from memoirs by William McEachern: "I think
that it was in the spring of 1846 Mr. McKinley came to me
at Springbank and said that Mr. Henty had given him a
fortnight to clear away, after he had the frame of a building
up on the Muntham side of the river. ... I then told him
to take his building across the river and put it up on the
Dunrobin boundary line, which was at that time up to the
old crossing place, so that this was the first of Casterton,
and also the first of the present Glenelg Inn.”
In the early days William McEachern had many exciting
encounters with the blacks, who were stealing and spearing
the station sheep. The most serious of these incidents oc-
curred in May, 1844. According to William McEachern’s
memoirs, the blacks killed a shepherd on the Dunrobin run
and drove away seven hundred and fifty sheep from the
flock. The manager, Mr. W. MacPherson, enlisted the aid
of William McEachern to try to trace the sheep, and they
were successful in locating the blacks’ camp, and found all
but a few of the sheep. The blacks, however, escaped.
Shortly after this they began to molest Mr. McEachern at
Springbank, and in November, 1844, when on a visit to
their camp, they attacked him in force. He received twenty-
three spear wounds, one of which caused the loss of the
sight of his left eye. The attack was no doubt in revenge
for the assistance he gave in tracing the Dunrobin sheep.
A generous supporter of the Presbyterian Church, William
McEachern was one of those responsible for having the
first Presbyterian Minister (Rev. Don) settled in the dis-
trict, with headquarters at Naracoorte, and for the erection
of the old church at Kaladbro, known as The Wilderness
Church.
He married firstly, at Sydney, New South Wales, in 1852,
Euphemia Kyle (died 21st January, 1853, without issue).
His second wife, Mary Elizabeth Holden, to whom he was
married at Portland, 29th April, 1856, was born at Hobart
Town, Van Diemen's Land, 24th March, 1832, and died at
Rosewood, New South Wales, 21st October, 1899.
William McEachern died at Rosewood, 2nd September,
1895, having had issue by his second wife, six sons and six
daughters, of whom we now' treat.
The eldest son,
HUGH McEACHERN, was born at East Strathdownie
Station, Victoria, Ist March, 1857, and educated at Hamil-
ton and Western District College, and Melbourne Uni-
versity, where he graduated 8.C.E., being the first graduate
from the Hamilton and Western District College. He joined
the Victorian Railways on the engineering staff, and for
eight years held the position of Assistant Engineer of
Construction.
He died, unmarried, at "Huntingdon,” South Yarra,
Melbourne, 31st March, 1886. A memorial window in the
Hamilton and Western District College perpetuates his
association with that institution.
The second son,
JOHN HOLDEN McEACHERN, was born at East
Strathdownie Station, Victoria, Bth March, 1864. When


fourteen years of age, he accompanied his father to Rose-
wood, New South Wales, and later gained pastoral ex-
perience under his father on the Rosewood property. As
the property was unimproved, he was engaged in arduous
pioneering work in clearing and fencing, and it is recorded
that he was driving a team of bullocks at an age when he
was not tall enough to yoke his team without the aid of a
box to stand on. At this time, Albury, ninety miles, and
Wagga, seventy miles, were the nearest railway stations, and
all supplies had to be transported by bullock teams from
either of these two places.
John Holden McEachern
John Holden McEachern was also with his uncle, William
Holden, on Strathdownie, and about 1889 rented a small
property at Love’s Creek, Glenroy, near Tumbarumba, New
South Wales, naming it Springbank, which property he
ultimately purchased. In 1905 he acquired additional land,
naming this portion Craobhan, a Gaelic word meaning
"many trees.” Here he engaged in wool growing and
grazing.
He was a prominent member of the Pastoral and Agricul-
tural Society of Tumbarumba, New South Wales, and also
of most of the public bodies in the district. He was in-
terested in pasture improvement, and in collaboration with
the Department of Agriculture of New South Wales, con-
ducted experiments on his farm; he received an illuminated
letter of thanks from the Minister of Agriculture, Hon.
J. L. Trefle, for his services in this respect. He was a man
of sterling character, and was held in high esteem by all
with whom he came in contact.
He married Elizabeth, daughter of George Wilde Evans,
C.E., of "The Meadows,” Glenroy, near Tumbarumba, and
sister of Catherine Anne Evans, who married Thomas Kyle
McEachern (q.v.).

MALCOLM STUART McEACHERN of West
Strathdownie Station, Victoria, was born at Morven, Argyll-
shire, Scotland, 14th March, 1819. Following the dis-
solution of the family partnership, he took over West
Strathdownie Station in partnership with his brother-in-law,
James Cameron, but later disposed of his interest and


became associated with his brother, "Long” John, in the
purchase of Knebsworth Station, details of which are given
in "Long” John McEachern’s record.
After leaving Knebsworth, he was appointed sheep in-
spector for the Beechworth district, and in the following
year was transferred to Benalla, where he remained until
1876, when he was transferred to Castlemaine. The follow-
ing year the scab-infested districts of Victoria were declared
dean, and the services of many inspectors were dispensed
with. In consideration of the valuable services rendered by
Malcolm McEachern (he was instrumental in clearing three
districts, Beechworth, Benalla and Castlemaine, from the
terrible scourge), he was appointed stock inspector of
Wahgunyah, a position he held until his death.
Malcolm McEachern married firstly, Ann Cameron
(deed.), and secondly, in 1875, Elizabeth Sedgwick Ross.

the Wollondilly River, where he remained for five years.
In December, 1844, he took a position as overseer with
Mr. Thomas Chirnside, of Werribee Park, at the latter’s

Flower of Port Fairy
Horace flower, of Port Fairy, was born in
London, 14th December, 1818, and educated at
Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge Uni-
versity. He came to Sydney in 1837, where he occupied
the position of clerk in the office of his brother, Philip.
In 1840, with a Mr. Nail, he went to Calcutta to buy wheat
for shipment to Australia, and on his return to Sydney six
months later, again joined his brother, Philip, who was
Horace Flower
then a partner with Mr. Severin Kanute Salting, in the
wool broking firm of Flower, Salting and Company. While
on the staff of Flower, Salting and Company, he was sent
to England in 1845 to study the wool business at Bradford,
returning to Australia as its first wool expert, and entered
into partnership with Mr. Old in Sydney. In 1846, he
came over to Port Phillip and joined in partnership with
Thomas Must in a mercantile business at Portland, known
as Flower, Must and Company, and traded as wool buyers
and exporters up till 1850.
In 1850, Horace Flower left Portland to enter into part-
nership with William Rutledge, at Port Fairy (at that time
known as Belfast), in the well-known mercantile business
of William Rutledge and Company (see Rutledge family
records in this volume).
When the firm of William Rutledge and Company ceased
trading, Horace Flower was appointed local representative in
Port Fairy and district for Goldsbrough, Mort and Com-
pany, and this business he managed until the firm closed its
Port hairy branch in 1865. Mr. Flower was then appointed
secretary for the Shire of Belfast, a position he held for
three years, when he resigned and took up his residence in
Melbourne.
Amelia Flower (nee Kirk)
While at Port Fairy, Mr. Flower was the local represen-
tative for Lloyds of London, and owing to the great activity
in shipping in those days, when ships arrived from, and left,
the Bay almost daily for every part of the globe, the position
held by Mr. Flower was a most important one.
Mr. Flower took a prominent part in all the public affairs
of the Port Fairy district. He was a member of the old
district Roads Board, which had headquarters at Belfast
(now Port Fairy) and controlled a large portion of the
Western District. He was one of those mainly responsible
for the erection of the local hospital, and organised the fire
brigade in the early days; the small fire engine used at that
time is now to be seen at Port Fairy.
Apart from his business activities, Mr. Flower was well
known for his scholarly and classical attainments. To quote


from an obituary notice in the Port Fairy Gazette at the
time of his death: "Of all the great personalities associated
with the early history of the town, he was . . . the greatest,
and was a favourite with every class of the community.
During the time he was in the Western District, Horace
Flower was interested in several pastoral properties, namely,
Argyle Station, 32,000 acres, near Casterton, with his part-
ner, Thomas Must, for some years; Burrie Burrie, a sub-
division of Nareeb Nareeb, near Dunkeld, in partnership
with George Hutton, 1858-63; The Gums, 16,000 acres,
near Penshurst, taken up in partnership with William Lilly
Hawkins, in 1862. He was appointed a joint trustee in the
Nareeb Nareeb Estate in April, 1857, and an executor of
John McKellar's Knebsworth Estate, 1860-70. He also had
pastoral interests in Queensland, being a partner with J. P.
Lloyd in Kolonga Station, near Bundaberg.
He married, in 1850, Amelia, youngest daughter of
Captain Rupert Kirk, R.N., and Jane Kirk, of Woodford,
Lane Cove, Sydney. She died at "Englefield," Toorak,
Melbourne, in 1907, xt. 76.
Horace Flower died at his residence, "Englefield, Toorak,
12th December, 1899, having had issue, in addition to
three sons who died in infancy, five sons and four daugh-
ters, of whom we now treat.
John Henry Flower
The eldest son,
JOHN HENRY FLOWER, was born at Port Fairy, Vic-
toria, 20th February, 1852, and educated at King Edward
Grammar School, Bury St. Edmunds, Norfolk, England.
He studied law and qualified as a solicitor, and on his
return to Australia in 1876, commenced practice in Brisbane,
Queensland, in partnership with Mr. Graham L. Hart, as
Flower and Hart, which firm is still in existence, being
one of the best-known legal firms in Queensland. He was
for fourteen years Church Warden of St. Andrew s,
Lutwytche, Brisbane.
He married Dora (his cousin), daughter of Lieutenant
Arthur Kirk (of New South Wales Military Corps and later
Superintendent of Victorian Police), and granddaughter of
Captain Rupert Kirk, of Woodford, Lane Cove, Sydney.
She died at Kirkston, Windsor, Brisbane, 10th August,
1932.

This family came originally from France, landing in
England prior to the twelfth century, the name then being
le Flo. Two members of the family, John and Richard
Je Flo, are recorded in one of the earliest rolls in the
British Museum as having accompanied Prince Edward
(afterwards Edward I) on the last of the Crusades,
1269/70. The name le Flo was afterwards changed to
Flower and Floyer. The first direct ancestor of whom we
have record,
JOHN FLOWER (c. 1580), who had a son,
JOHN FLOWER (c. 1620), who had a son,
JOHN FLOWER, b. 1652; d. 1708; m., 1684, Ann
Watts (d. 1739). Their youngest son,
JONATHAN FLOWER, of Feltwell, b. 1701 ; d. 1749.

Norfolk. He m., in 1805, Martha Deane Wickham, of


the ancient Somerset family of which William of Wykeham
was a member. William of Wykeham founded the historic
Winchester College and also New College, Oxford. John
Flower had, with other issue, a son,
HORACE FLOWER, of whom we treat in the Aus-
tralian section of this record, and another son,
PHILIP WILLIAM FLOWER, who came out to Aus-
tralia first on a health trip, in the late twenties, when he
realized, with free settlement then being introduced, the
possibilities of establishing a prosperous business, and on
his return to England persuaded his father to advance the
necessary capital. He returned to Sydney in 1827 and was
in partnership with a Mr. Marsden in a mercantile business
there. In 1834, he joined in partnership with Mr. Severin
Kanute Salting, which became Flower, Salting and Com-
pany, Wool Brokers and Pastoral Agents. Mr. Flower
became one of the best known business men in Sydney. He
was one of the largest shareholders in the original Bank
of New South Wales, but on the foundation of the Union
Bank of Australia in 1837, he transferred his interest to
that institution, of which he became chairman of directors
in London, and one of the trustees, when he settled in
England. It is interesting to note that Philip W. Flower
purchased land at the first Melbourne land sale. He married,
and died in England, 22nd February, 1872, having had

Learmonth of Ettrick
WILLIAM LEARMONTH of Ettrick, Victoria,
was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, 31st January,
1815. He arrived in Van Diemen’s Land by the
ship "Tamar” in 1834, and purchased a property near Evan-
dale, named "Williamswood.” He succeeded so well that in
1839 he shore 14,000 head of sheep. In the great financial
crash of 1841-42, William Learmonth, along with most of
the land-holders, was practically ruined, and he crossed over
to Victoria in 1842 in order to examine the country, the
settlement of which was at that time the main topic among
pastoralists in Van Diemen’s Land.
Fairy), where I was kept awake the whole night by the
carousals of about a dozen squatters who seldom meet and
consequently are loth to part. . . . Having purchased a large
herd of cattle, I made up my mind to secure a run for them,
and fortunately, heard of one at Darlot’s Creek. The only
reason why this fine run had not been occupied before was
on account of the natives who harbour in the country close
by . . . and are here in great force.
"On September 4th I left Cox’s Mt. Napier Station with
two hundred head of cattle, men, bullock teams, provisions,
and a good supply of firearms, to take possession of Darlot’s
William Learmonth, of Ettrick
He was greatly impressed with the potentialities of the
country and on his return to Van Diemen’s Land decided to
invest what small funds he had in the Portland Bay district.
In 1844 he arrived at Darlot’s Creek, twenty miles from
Portland, and there established a home. He experienced all
the setbacks which were the lot of the early pioneers in
Victoria, and in a diary kept by him many interesting refer-
ences to the early days are made.
After describing the voyage from Launceston to Port
Fairy in the schooner "Lowestoft,” which took eleven days,
he goes on to say: "1 put up at the Merrijig Hotel (Port
Mary Learmonth (nee Ralston)
Creek Cattle Station. Arrived on September 6th. On 7th
built a sod hut for the men, and on the Bth rode over a
large portion of the run and tracked the creek for a crossing
place. Was astonished and overjoyed when I found one and
crossed the hitherto uncrossable Darlot's Creek. ...”
It may be mentioned that Darlot's Creek run was occupied
in 1838 by Messrs. J. M. Darlot and W. H. Dutton, who
ran cattle on it, but they did not hold a licence. William
Learmonth was the first holder of a licence, being No.
168 Portland Bay, a property of 39,000 acres. When he took
the property over, Mr. Learmonth renamed it "Ettrick.” He
then goes on to describe his journey to Ettrick:


I now set about getting delivery of my cattle station,
being temporarily occupied with a small herd of heifers lent
by Mr. Cox to take possession. I hired a team of bullocks
in Port Fairy and with two splitters set out for the station
on an entirely new track. The weather set in wet and
rained incessantly; it was with the greatest difficulty we
could proceed at all and seldom made more than six miles
a day. . . . With the exception of a capsize in the creek, we
eventually got safe to the station.”
Mr. Learmonth commenced the building of the home,
which went on until September, 1845, when Mrs. Lear-
month, with her two sons, John and Robert, and daughter,
Elizabeth, came over to Ettrick from Van Diemen's Land,
to join her husband.
He had a great deal of trouble with the natives around
Darlot s Creek and applied for and received police protec-
tion. Governor Latrobe, in writing to James Blair, P.M.,
at Portland on 4th June, 1845, relative to Mr. Learmonth,
wrote:
I acknowledge yours enclosing a letter from Mr.
Learmonth detailing certain outrages committed by the
aboriginals. I have referred same to the Crown Lands
Commissioner of Portland Bay district, requesting him to
give what protection he could to that district.”
The Crowns Lands Commissioner, Foster Fyans, had, in
a letter a few weeks previous to this, stated that he had
particularly warned Mr. Learmonth of the number of natives
about the place, and had expressed the opinion that he had
acted extremely wrongly in taking sheep into that country
without the Commissioner’s knowledge. However, on March
7th, 1846, Governor Latrobe again wrote to Blair, requesting
Commissioner Eyans to place a party of Border Police at
Darlot’s Creek, and in reply the Commissioner stated that
Mr. Learmonth’s station had been a constant expense to
the Government, by keeping there a police force without
any good result, and expressed the opinion that it would be
wise for Mr. Learmonth to withdraw from his property.
Mr. Learmonth, however, decided to carry on, and in time
the natives became tractable, and Ettrick, which became one
of the best stations in the district, was held by him until
1880, when it was taken over by Mr. W. (. T. Clarke.
Previous to this, in 1867, the south-east portion of the
Ettrick property was added to the "Ellangowan” property.
Other runs held by William Learmonth were Knebsworth,
near Macarthur, 12,000 acres, 1846-48; Fitzroy I’Estrange,
near Heywood, 8,000 acres, 1850-80; Ellangowan, on
Darlot’s Creek, adjoining Ettrick, 8,000 acres, 1852-67;
from 1867-71, Mr. Anketell Jones, William Learmonth’s
son-in-law, was taken into partnership on this run, and this
partnership lasted until 1881, when the property was pur-
chased by the latter's son, John Ralston Learmonth. Tahara,
on the Wannon River, 24,000 acres, was held by William
Learmonth from 1860-66; also St. Helen's, near Narra-
wong, 1861-64. This station, of 25,000 acres, was later
subdivided into St. Helen's No. 1 and No. 2; the former
William Learmonth held from 1867-69, and the latter from
1869 until it was taken over by Mr. W. J. T. Clarke in
1880. For some years William Learmonth leased Eumeralla
West Station, 10,000 acres, adjoining Eumeralla East. While
in partnership with Stephen George Henty, the firm held
Bongmire run, 15,000 acres, near Hamilton, from 1857-63.
In 1854 he took up his residence at Portland, and en-
tered into partnership with Mr. Stephen George Henty, the
firm being known as Messrs. Henty, Learmonth and Com-
pany, merchants, and this partnership continued until 1863.
During his residence in Portland he entered fully into
public life, and was for many years a member of the
Borough Council, and first Mayor of Portland Borough in
1863. He was also President of the Shire Council. He took
a great interest in the Volunteer Movement, and before his
death held the rank of Colonel.
He married Mary Ralston (born Galloway, Scotland, 13th
April, 1813; died Ettrick, Heywood, Victoria, 16th May,
1895).
William Learmonth died at Ettrick, Heywood, 7th July,
1889, and was buried in the Learmonth Private Cemetery
on the banks of Darlot’s Creek, not far from the site of his
first camp. He had issue, six sons and two daughters, of
whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
JOHN RALSTON LEARMONTH, was born at Logan,
Evandale, Tasmania, 2nd June, 1838. At the age of seven
years he came over with his mother to Portland to join his
father at Ettrick in September, 1845. He was educated on
the station by his parents in their spare time, as it was
difficult at this period to get any capable tutors, and later,
in 1855, joined the staff of the Bank of Australasia at
Portland, where he remained for about a year.
His father having by this time acquired an interest in
several pastoral runs already referred to in this record, in
1857 appointed his son, John Ralston, as manager. The
Fitzroy EEstrange run was soon forfeited, and in 1866
Archibald Johnson purchased Tahara. In 1880, Ettrick, St.
Helen’s and Eumeralla were acquired by Sir William Clarke,
Bt., and John Ralston Learmonth was appointed manager of
the two last named properties, residing at the Eumeralla
West run.
He later leased Eumeralla run from 1851-99, and then
took up his residence on his own estate at Ellangowan, near
Tyrendarra, where he remained up to the time of his death.
He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1861, and
occupied a prominent position in the public life of the


f
n~ F
Portland Bay district, was a member of the Minhamite Shire
for eighteen years, being three times President, and was for
several terms a councillor of the Shire of Portland.
John Ralston Learmonth took a great interest in racing
and was well known as a breeder and horse owner through-
out the Western District. He was a judge for many years
at the Hamilton Race Club, and judged thoroughbreds and
Herefords at the Melbourne Show. A crack shot, he was
ranked as one of the best in Victoria. He was also a mem-
ber and President for twenty-five years of the Hamilton
Club.
John Ralston Learmonth
of Ellangowan
He married Mary Jane Marshall, daughter of Rev. John
Fulford, Canon of St. Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide, who came
out to Australia as private secretary to Bishop Short, first
Bishop of Adelaide. She died at Warrnambool, Victoria,
13th May, 1929.

Learmonth of Prestonholme
PETER LEARMONTH of Prestonholme, Hamil-
ton, was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, 9th February,
1821. In his nineteenth year, he decided to join his
brother, William, who had emigrated to Van Diemen's
Land in 1834 and taken up a property near Evandale. Here
Peter Learmonth gained pastoral experience for two years
under his brother, after which he formed a sheep station
at Tasman’s Peninsula. Two years later gold was discovered
in California, and, accompanied by his brother, James Allan,
and a party of young men, he left for the goldfields. On
arrival in San Francisco they found the place almost deserted,
and one ship there, which, as its crew had deserted, could
not obtain labour to discharge the cargo. Peter Learmonth
saw an opportunity of adding to their slender funds, and
with his companions, contracted to discharge the cargo at
a very remunerative figure. They then went to the diggings,
but had no luck; the whole party then returned to Tas-
mania.
In 1851, when gold was discovered in Victoria, Peter
Learmonth crossed over to the mainland, accompanied by
his brother, James Allan. They entered into partnership
with Robert Ralston and proceeded to Forest Creek, near
Castlemaine, and took up a claim which proved to be very
rich. Peter Learmonth did not stay long at the diggings,
but decided to go in for stock raising. At that time, how-
ever, he could not find a suitable property, so accepted an
offer from Mr. Francis Henty, of Portland, to manage
Merino Downs Station, where he remained until about
1859. He then turned his attention to flour milling, and
erected his first mill at The Grange, as Hamilton was then
known, and took up residence at Prestonholme. This ven-
ture was successful, and Peter Learmonth built or purchased
flour mills at Sandford, Byaduk and Penshurst, becoming
one of the biggest millers in Victoria.
As he prospered he added to his estate, Prestonholme,
until it reached about 1,000 acres, and later was allotted a
section of land in the Parish of Corea; this he increased by
purchase until the Corea Estate at Dunkeld was formed. He
took a great interest in the breeding of sheep, and suc-
ceeded in raising the quality of the land to a very high
standard, so that he was able to produce some of the finest
wool exported from Australia.
About this time Mr. David McKcllar, son of Mr. John
McKellar, of Knebsworth Station, was the owner of
Nacimiento Ranche (246,000 acres), in the State of
Coahuila, Mexico, and Peter Learmonth purchased a one-
third interest in this property. For some time this was
worked as a partnership, but later he surrendered his share
of 82,000 acres to his sons, James Allan and Stanley.
He was a prominent citizen of Hamilton, being one of
the first members of the Dundas Shire Council, and Presi-
dent for some time. When Hamilton was proclaimed a
Borough, he was one of the first Councillors. A generous
patron of the Hospital, he was elected President of the
Hospital Committee, an office held by him for many years.
The two colleges in Hamilton now known as the Hamilton
College and Alexandra Ladies’ College, in a great measure
owe their existence to his enthusiasm and work in the great
task of raising the necessary capital. He was an active
member of the Hamilton Pastoral and Agricultural Society,
for many years Returning Officer for Dundas, and held
a commission as a Justice of the Peace for many years.
He married Mary Jarvey (died Oakdene, Hamilton, 24th
November, 1913), daughter of John Pearson, of Retreat
Station, near Casterton, Victoria, and his wife, Mary Simp-
son, sister of Sir James Young Simpson, M.D., D.C.L.,
who first applied chloroform as an anaesthetic.
Peter Learmonth died at Prestonholme, Hamilton, 19th
July, 1893, having had issue, seven sons and three daughters,
of whom we now treat.

The eldest son,
JAMES ALLAN LEARMONTH, was born at Merino
Downs, Henty, Victoria, Bth April, 1856, and educated at
the Hamilton and Western District College, and Wesley
College, Melbourne. He joined the firm of Andrew Rowan,
merchant, in Melbourne, but was later appointed by his
father as manager of the latter’s Penshurst flour mill, In


T
1880, accompanied by his brother, Stanley, he went over to
Mexico to manage their father's ranch business, remaining
there for ten years, before returning to Australia to take
over the management of Corea Station, Dunkeld. When
this property was sold he purchased Prestonholme Estate,
and achieved great success as a breeder of Lincoln sheep,
owning one of the best flocks in the State.
James Allan Learmonth was a prominent footballer and
cricketer, and a foundation member of the Hamilton Golf
Club, of which he was Champion in 1901 and 1903; was
also President of the Hamilton Bowling Club in 1911-12.

cultural Society and was on the Council of that body for
some years.

of this ranch was given to James and Stanley Learmonth
by their father. This property ran 6,000 sheep. With the
exception of a short visit to Australia when he was married,
he remained in Mexico until 1903. When in Mexico he
experimented in the breeding of Merino sheep, but owing
to the depredations of wild animals and scab, it was not a
success, and he had to carry on with cattle.

Hunter
FIVE sons of Alexander Hunter, Writer to the Signet,
Edinburgh, came out to Australia between 1839 and
1851, Alexander Mac Lean in 1839, John about the
same time, James Arthur Carr in 1840, Andrew Francis in
1850, and William Fergusson in 1851. Their father had
formed a company in Edinburgh to acquire land in the Port
Phillip settlement. Several Scottish noblemen, including the
Marquis of Ailsa,were shareholders, and Alexander Mac Lean
Hunter was sent to Australia to represent the company in
conjunction with James Watson; the company operated
under the name of Watson and Hunter. John and James
Hunter also joined the firm shortly after its inception.
The firm commenced operations in New South Wales,
buying cattle and horses there and overlanding them to Port
Phillip; the overlanding was carried out by Alexander and
John Hunter and the Hon. Gilbert Kennedy (son of the
Marquis of Ailsa), who were joined by Edward Bell (later
of Englefield Station in the Western District of Victoria,
and subsequently Crown Lands Commissioner for the
Wimmera), who was also overlanding cattle. At this period
labour was almost unobtainable, but, if land were taken up
a certain number of assigned servants could be obtained, so
Watson and Hunter took up land at Lake George, thereby
securing twenty men; the overlanders shortly afterwards
resumed their journey, purchasing further stock as they went
along. The party got as far as Tumut, where they pur-
chased 600 cattle and a run at Gilmore Creek, where Mr.
Bell was left in charge, and Alexander Hunter and the Hon.
Gilbert Kennedy continued the journey to Melbourne.
Watson and Hunter established their headquarters at
Keilor, where they occupied a large tract of land, and
shortly afterwards formed stations in the Mansfield district,
the first to be formed being Ballowra, which was abandoned
within a few months. Alexander Hunter and a Mr. Camp-
bell Hunter (a cousin) then set out to find more suitable
land, and discovered the Devil's River country (the river
was so named by the explorers from hearing a corroboree
upon its banks, the first night they camped there) ; here
they formed the following stations for the company:
Wappan, 30,000 acres; Loyola, 38,000 acres; Mount Bat-
tery, 35,000 acres; Maindample, 27,000 acres; Mimamaluke,
25,000 acres; and Dueran, 40,000 acres. Matters did not
go well with the company; disputes arose between the
shareholders in Scotland and their representatives in Aus-
tralia, and heavy losses of sheep on Devil's River stations
from an outbreak of catarrh, made matters worse, so the
company was wound up about 1846.
In 1846, the three Hunter brothers went into Gipps-
land, where they applied for Tarwin Meadows Station, at
Anderson s Inlet, but did not occupy it, selling their interest
later for £SO. They were then joined by their brothers,
Frank and William, and proceeded first to the Western
District, where they had pastoral property near Warrnam-
bool, and shortly afterwards, hearing good reports of the
country in the South East, from Captain Sturt’s brother,
they crossed over to South Australia. Frank Hunter took
up country, part of which later became known as Moorak
Station, the site of the town of Mount Gambier, and
James and Alexander took up Kalangadoo Station (origin-
ally 200,000 acres), where they built a homestead and
remained for some years. When Kalangadoo was sold,
James held Merne, a leasehold property, for some time, and
in January, 1875, he left South Australia to settle at Minnie-
burn, South Gippsland.
The brothers were intrepid explorers as well as pioneers,
while their feats of horsemanship were spoken of in every
part of Australia. They were known "to ride anything, at
anything, or over anything, that a horse could reasonably
(or indeed unreasonably) be expected to clear.” On one
occasion, four of the brothers rode in the same race at
Flemington, when the grandstand was situated on the river
bank. They were pioneers of the turf as well as of the
pastoral industry, and individual references to the various
phases of their careers will be made later in this record.
Rolf Boldrewood, the Australian author, writing of the
Hunter brothers, states, "They belonged to a class of
colonists of whom Australia Felix may well be proud. Well
born, cultured, fearless, adventurous, they came to this far
land, one of Britain's choicest possessions, at the exact
time when the strong hand and the dauntless heart were
needed to occupy, to develop, to hold it against all comers
for all time, and when in other days men begin to reckon
up the worthies of a storied past, the names of the Hunter
brothers will always be remembered with pride by their
comrades and their countrymen.”
We shall now treat of the Hunter brothers individually
in order of their arrival in Australia.
ALEXANDER MacLEAN HUNTER was born
in Edinburgh, Scotland, 25th November, 1821, and arrived
in Port Phillip in April, 1839. In 1841, accompanied by
Messrs. Bell, Jamieson, an overseer, and a blackfellow
named Pigeon, he started out to find a stock route into
Gippsland. In connection with this trip he writes: ”1 made
my way through the Snowy Mountains (Barkly Ranges) the


other day to the head of some of the Gippsland rivers, and
found a road in for cattle, but quite impossible for drays. 1
intended starting through with cattle immediately on our
return from exploring, but it came on such dreadful weather
that we were obliged to put it off until the spring." In
1843, the Government sent out a party in charge of Crown
Lands Commissioner Tyers, to follow Mr. Hunter’s track,
but they failed, returning a fortnight later, having lost
nearly all their horses, and with the party in a deplor-
able condition. This started a rumour that Alexander
Hunter had not penetrated to Gippsland in 1841, and so
he again set out, on 20th October, 1844, accompanied by
his brother, James, Campbell Hunter, and a Mr. Jourdon.
In his log dated 31st October, 1844, he states that he "saw
Tyer’s track where he had gone wrong." On accomplishing
his trip, he made straight for the station of the Crown
Lands Commissioner, "much to his (the Crown Lands
Commissioner’s) disgust.” In a letter written in 1890, he
describes this trip as a very rough experience, in which
they got down among some awful gullies, and after some
six or eight days, had to work their way back, and make a
fresh start from the head of the river Howqua, until they
finally hit on a dividing range, by following which they
found the head of the Thompson.
Alexander Hunter was appointed officer of mounts for
the Victorian Police, a position he held until he left for
South Africa. He was Honorary Secretary for twenty years
of the leading Melbourne Turf Club of his day (the pre-
decessor of the Victoria Racing Club) and the first com-
mander of the Prince of Wales’ Light Horse. He was also
fond of four-in-hand driving, and on one occasion, owing
to his team bolting and colliding in Collins Street with the
carriage of a well-known banker, a verdict of £SOO damages
was given against him. He was so popular amongst the
"sports” of the day, that when he called on his agents the
day after the case was finished to arrange payment, he was
informed that the sportsmen of Melbourne, headed by Mr.
William Stawell (afterwards Sir William Stawell, Chief
Justice) the opposing Counsel, had subscribed the required
amount. Alexander Hunter owned several well-known
racers in the early days; "Romeo,” winner of "The Town
Plate” in 1841, "Flying Shingler,” a successful steeple-
chaser, and "Benedict,” who won the first Hunt Club
steeplechase on Bth November, 1853, run at the Prahran
Racecourse, which, according to an entry made in 1867 in
the diary of the late Mr. C. L. Cummins, a very old
colonist, was situated between Gardiner's Creek Road (now
Toorak Road) and the Junction Hotel, St. Kilda, what is
now Fawkner Park, and near the present Pasley Street. The
trophy for the first Hunt Club Steeplechase was a large
silver loving cup, which had been brought from India by
Mr. George Watson (the first starter appointed by the
Flemington Race Club), who had purchased it at a sale.
This cup is still in possession of a member of the Alexander
Hunter branch of the family in Melbourne.
About 1864, Alexander Hunter went to South Africa,
sugar planting, and after a successful six years, returned to
Victoria and settled at Balia Balia, a pastoral property of
3,840 acres, near Cranbourne, on the shores of Westernport
Bay, in 1872.
He married, in 1850, Eliza Anna Bostock (born at
Hobart, Tasmania, 28th April, 1830; died 6th January,
1902), and died at sea, 16th November, 1892, on board
the "Tongariro," when returning from a visit to Scotland.
He had issue, three sons and two daughters, of whom we
now treat.
The eldest son,
EVAN ARTHUR HUNTER, was born at Beleura,
Mornington, Victoria, Bth April, 1854. When three years
of age, he was taken home to Ayrshire, Scotland, by his
aunt, where he remained with his grandfather, Alexander
Hunter, for twelve years, and received his education at
Dollar College, Ayr. After the return of his parents to
Scotland from Natal, he accompanied them to Victoria, and
resided with them at Balia Balia Station, Westernport. He
took up pastoral pursuits on his father’s property, and later
went to Terrick Station, Queensland, which was owned by
his relatives, Charles and Thomas Rome, where he remained
for fifteen years. He engaged in overlanding stock, and on
three occasions took stock from Queensland to the South
Australian border. He resided at Metung, Gippsland Lakes,
for ten years, and on his return from a visit to Scotland,
settled at Mornington, where he resided for ten years,
finally settling at Caulfield, Melbourne. Like his forebears,
he was an excellent horseman, and in later life was a keen
yachtsman.
He married Mary Alice, eldest daughter of William
Doherty, of co. Cork, Ireland, and Alice Patten, of Roch-
ester, Kent, England, who came out to Australia in the early
fifties. In 1856, Mr. Doherty was appointed manager of
the Port Albert Steam Navigation Company, South Gipps-
land, and was later merchant and importer at Bairnsdale,
where he died, 18th April, 1876.
Evan Arthur Hunter died at "Doonholm,” Caulfield, 11th
June, 1917, having had issue:—

JOHN HUNTER was born in Edinburgh, 21st April,
1820, and in his twenty-first year came out to Port Phillip
to join his brother, Alexander, arriving by the ship''Culdee”
in January, 1840. He was associated with his brothers in
pioneering and exploratory work for about ten years, and
was probably the most fearless horseman of the brothers,
being known among his contemporaries as "Jack the Devil."
He eventually settled in the Argentine, and there married
a Spanish lady, Martena Ariola. He died at Buenos Aires,
17th February, 1868, having had issue, two sons, (i) John
Henry (deed.), (ii) Evan Gohbad (deed.), and two
daughters.
JAMES ARTHUR CARR HUNTER was born
in Edinburgh, 30th June, 1824, and landed in Sydney inlß4o,
where he joined his brothers, Alexander and John, and in
the following year accompanied them overland to Port
Phillip with one thousand head of cattle for Watson and
Hunter’s stations at Devil's River, Mansfield. He was
associated with his brothers for many years, both on Watson
and Hunter’s stations and also in the Western District of
Victoria and South Australia. When the Hunters decided
to take up Kalangadoo Station, James Hunter rode overland
from Mount Gambier to Adelaide over unexplored country
in order to lodge the necessary application for the run.
A splendid horseman, he could never resist riding in a
steeplechase at any of the meetings held in whatever part
of the country he happened to be, Once, while in Adelaide,


he got a mount in a steeplechase on a very wild horse. At
one of the fences a dog rushed out and frightened the horse,
and Mr. Hunter tried to run off, but at the wing of the
fence a man and his wife were sitting in a buggy. He did
not notice them until he was close up, so in order to prevent
a crash, he jumped his horse over them. An artist who was
present later painted a picture of the incident, which is still
in possession of the Hunter family. On another occasion,
when riding at Elemington, he was dragged from under a
beaten horse in the Sandridge Steeplechase and put up on
the mare "Una,” in the next race, and won.
James Hunter was also with his brothers at Merne, South
Australia, but when this property was sold he settled at
Penola, becoming a partner with a Mr. Edwards in a stock
and station agency business. When his brother, William,
went to Fiji, James Hunter accompanied him, and arranged
to take up some land there. He had, however, to return to
Australia to make the necessary arrangements, and was
nearly starved to death on the return voyage. The skipper
of the vessel, being a drunkard, had almost completely
neglected the commissariat department, so James Hunter
took the law into his own hands, put the skipper in irons
and placed the mate in charge of the vessel, directing him
to make for the nearest land. They landed at Eden, Two-
fold Bay, in the last stages of starvation. James Hunter did
not return to Fiji, but settled at Minnieburn. About 1883,
he visited his brother, Evan, in Scotland, where he remained
for two or three years, and on his return resided near
Bairnsdale.
He married, 3rd October, 1850, Louisa Harriet, daughter
of Rev. Alfred Utterson, Rector of Layor Marney, Essex,
England. She was born 7th June, 1829, and died at Bairns-
dale, July, 1890. The Utterson family gave distinguished
soldiers to the British Army. Archibald Utterson, brother
of Mrs. J. A. C. Hunter, rose to the rank of Major-General,
and commanded the 3rd Brigade at Aldershot. Another
brother, Alfred, was a Lieutenant-General in the Indian
Army.
James Arthur Carr Hunter died at St. Kilda, Melbourne,
19th December, 1889, having had issue, four sons and two
daughters, of whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
ARTHUR MORDUANT HUNTER, was born at
Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, 3rd April, 1862, and educated at
Dalgliesh’s School, Penola, South Australia, and Mount
Gambier Grammar School. He began his pastoral career on
Merrigal Station, on the Lachlan, New South Wales, later
becoming overseer at the back station, "The Gap.” About
1883, he returned to Gippsland to manage his father’s
property, Minnieburn. He later rented a property in North
Gippsland, until he left for New South Wales in 1889,
where he later went into partnership with Charles Brewer
on a leasehold of 12,000 acres on Erimeran Station, running
8,500 sheep. Drought, however, drove them off the place,
after having lost half their sheep. On returning from a visit
to the Argentine and Scotland, he took up land near
Warragul.
He joined the Victorian Mounted Rifles, but was pre-
vented from serving in the Boer War through a riding
accident in which his leg was smashed. He is now living in
retirement at Metung, on the Gippsland Lakes. Like his
father and uncles, he was well known as a patron of the
turf, being a member of the V.A.T.C. for some years, and
also a member of the Melbourne Hunt Club.
He married Inez Eulalie Bates,of Batesford, near Geelong,

This family is directly descended from the Hunters of
Abbotshill (which originally formed part of the possession
of Crossraguel Abbey in Ayrshire) and of Barjarg Tower
in Dumfries-shire, formerly owned by the Earl of Morton.
JAMES HUNTER acquired the lands of Abbotshill, in

Hope of Darriwill
JAMES HOPE was born at Temple Hall, Morebattle,
Roxburghshire, Scotland, 10th November, 1810. He
decided to settle in Australia, and sailed from Greenwich
by the ship "Christina” on 7th November, 1838, arriving
in Sydney on 18th April, 1839; he overlanded to Port
Phillip in the same year, and occupied a run near Geelong
for a few years. He then entered into partnership with his
brother, George, in grazing properties on the Moorabool,
1845-49, and, in 1845, the partners also took over Lake
Dr. Robert Culbertson Hope, of Lynnburn
Wallace run, which they held until 1849, when James
dropped out of the partnership, his place being taken by
his brother, Robert. We next find James Hope on Acheron
Station, 24,000 acres, on the Acheron River, which he took
over from John C. Aitken in April, 1866, and held until
1872, when he sold out to Dr. Robert Martin.
James Hope died at Williamstown, Melbourne, 31st
January, 1877, unmarried.
ROBERT CULBERTSON HOPE, M.D., of
"Lynnburn,” Batesford, Victoria, was born at Temple Hall,
Morebattle, Roxburghshire, Scotland, 12th May, 1812. He
studied medicine at London University, and graduated M.D.
He came out to Australia as ship's surgeon in the "Lady
Kennaway” (his colleague being Dr. Waugh, later of
Goulburn, New South Wales), which sailed from Leith,
Scotland, 19th April, 1838, and arrived in Sydney, 12th
August of the same year; his sister accompanied him, and
her husband, David L. Waugh, was also of the party.
On arrival in Sydney, Dr. Hope commenced practise in
New South Wales, and continued until 1846, when he over-
landed to Port Phillip and practised at Geelong and later
at Inverleigh, finally settling at Batesford, where he formed
a station, "Lynnburn.” The Hope brothers also built two
Catherine Elizabeth Hope (nee Hassall)
flour mills, one at Batesford, on the Moorabool River, and
another on the Barwon River, near Inverleigh. These mills
were run by water power, necessitating the construction of
large concrete dams and water races a mile in length;
bridges were also built over the river where the mills were
situated.
Dr. Hope was one of the first viticulturists in the Geelong
district, and established an orchard on his property.
The pastoral properties in which Dr. Hope was interested
were Sutherlands Creek (later known as Darriwill) which
he took up with his brothers in 1840; Native Creek, ac-
quired in 1851, and Bolangum, near Navarre, which he held
from 1848 until 1860. He was also in partnership with
his brother, George, in Barwonleigh, adjoining Native


/' "V
1 Jb?
Creek; these properties were afterwards divided, George
taking over Darriwill, and Dr. Hope, Barwonleigh. The
brothers were also in partnership in Lake Wallace Station,
near Edenhope, 1845-64.
In 1856, he entered the Legislative Council as one of
the representatives for the South Western Province, and
retained the seat until 1864. He was again elected in 1867,
and represented the province until his retirement owing to
failing health in 1874. He was Chairman of Committees
in 1864, and was again elected to that position in 1870,
holding it until his retirement.
He took a keen interest in local affairs, was a Justice of
the Peace, and President of the Geelong and Western
District Agricultural and Horticultural Society.
He married, in 1846, Catherine Elizabeth (born Port
Macquarie, New South Wales, 1825; died Melbourne,
1922), eldest daughter of Rev. Thomas Hassall, of "Den-
bigh,” Cobbity, New South Wales, and granddaughter of
Rev. Samuel Marsden, Senior Chaplain of the Colony of
New South Wales (c. 1794), Father of the Church in Aus-
tralia, and founder of the Christian Church in New Zea-
land.

Melbourne, 24th June, 1878, having had issue, nine sons
and two daughters, of whom we now treat.

1865-66. He took up pastoral pursuits, gaining experience
on Queensland stations, and later managing a cattle station
in Northern Queensland for his father. He then returned
to New South Wales and was appointed manager of
Beemery Station, near Bourke, for his uncle. About 1879,
he and his brothers, Thomas and Arthur, purchased Moon-
bie Station, on the Lachlan, where he resided for a few
years. Later, about 1884, they bought Bogandillon Station,
and, about the same time, Manna Station, and Robert Hope
resided at Bogandillon until 1897, when this property and
Moonbie were sold, and Robert Hope also disposed of his
interest in Manna to his cousin, Dr. E. Culbertson Hope,
and purchased Birrark Station, near Condobolin, where he
resided during his lifetime. He was President of the Con-
dobolin Pastoralists’ Protection Board, and took a keen in-
terest in all local affairs.

GEORGE FIOPE, J.P., of Darriwill, was born at
Temple Hall, Morcbattle, Roxburghshire, Scotland, 20th
September, 1814. He was a student at the Edinburgh
University for a short period, and left it to go to Canada.
He did not remain there long, returning to Scotland about
1838. He decided to settle in Australia with his brothers,
and sailed from Leith, Scotland, in the ship "North Britain"
on 26th August, 1838, arriving in Sydney on 6th January,
1839.
Shortly after his arrival, he overlanded to Port Phillip,
and, in partnership with his brothers, settled at Sutherlands
Creek, afterwards known as Darriwill, on the Moorabool
River, in 1840; this property has been in the hands of the
family ever since.
With his brother, Dr. Robert Culbertson Hope, he was
in partnership in Barwonleigh Estate for some years, and
Lake Wallace Station, near Edenhope. He was also in
partnership with Mr. Robert Scott in Toogimbie Station,
on the Murrumbidgee, from 1862 to 1873; the partnership
then acquired Beemery and Belalie Stations, near Bourke,
New South Wales. This partnership was dissolved in 1877,
Mr. George Hope retaining Beemery, which he sold in
1882. He also, at one time, held an occupation licence at
Guichan Bay (now Robe), South Australia, of 64 square
miles. His last purchase of land was that of Gnotuk Estate,
near Camperdown, Victoria, for his sons, James and George.
A man of quiet and unostentatious disposition, he never-
theless was recognised as a fine type of pioneer and public-
spirited citizen. A staunch member of the Presbyterian
Church, he practically founded the Presbyterian Church at
Moorabool, of which he was an Elder.
He married, in 1852, Marianne Hassall (born Parramatta,
New South Wales, Bth April, 1827, and died at Darriwill,
19th August, 19H), third daughter of the Rev. Thomas
Hassall, of Cobbity, New South Wales, a sister of the wife

Victoria, was born at Darriwill, Moorabool, Victoria, 3rd
August, 1856, and educated at Geelong College and Mel-
bourne University. He rook up pastoral pursuits and
managed Beemery Station, near Bourke, New South Wales,
until 1882, when he entered into partnership with his
brother, George Rowland Hope, in Gnotuk Estate, near
Camperdown. Fie was prominently associated with the
development of the dairying industry in the Camperdown
district.
He married, in 1882, Emily, second daughter of Rev.

THOMAS EDDIE TULLOH, of Bongmine and
Mount Piper Stations, and Colac, was born at Earnhill.
Forres, Scotland, 6th June, 1814. In his youth he suffered
from asthma, and being recommended to a warm climate,
joined his brother in Jamaica, when sixteen years of age.
After three years, he was able to take charge of a sugar
plantation, on which were eight hundred slaVcs. During


the time he was in Jamaica, a rebellion broke out amongst
the slaves all over the island, and Thomas Eddie Tulloh
played a prominent part in suppressing the outbreak and
pacifying the rebels. He returned to Scotland in 1836, and
in the following year emigrated to Van Diemen s Land, but
in 1838, he decided to settle in the Port Phillip district,
which at that time was attracting much attention from those
interested in sheep breeding. He landed at Portland, and in
March, 1840, took up Bongmine Station, a run of 15,000
acres, on the Wannon, eleven miles from Hamilton. He
stocked the run with sheep from Tasmania and carried on
the pioneering work necessary in developing virgin country
into a first-class sheep station, a task which was not made
any easier by years of depression and the exodus of station
workers to the goldfields in the early fifties.
He sold Bongmine Station in 1857 to Stephen George
Henty and William Learmonth, and entered into business
with his brother, Colin Robertson Tulloh, at Harrow, but
retired from the partnership in 1865, when he took over
Mount Piper Station, near Broadford. After several years
of drought and the drop in prices of wool and stock, he
sold out in 1872, and established a storekeeping business
in Colac. He took a keen interest in local matters, and was
an active worker for the Church and hospital.
He married, in 1854, Emma Cornelia Kearton (died
27th July, 1921), and died at Colac, 3rd March, 1888,
having had issue, seven sons and four daughters, of whom

country town in Victoria; he took up a large area of land
in the Beech Forest, on which he spent thousands of pounds
on developmental work, and also held land at Bahntorc.

Victoria, was born at Earnhill, Forres, Scotland, 24th July,
1827, and educated at Forres Academy. It was intended
that he should study law, but, when nineteen years of age,
he decided to emigrate to Australia, and, accompanied by
his mother, Helen Eddie Tulloh, and his sisters, he landed

He remained at Bongmine with his brother until the

interest and carried on the business until his death.

Hmeage
The Tullohs (the early members of the family spelled
the name Tulloch) are descendants of a French family,
Le Moyne of Verdun (c. 896), a branch of which emigrated
to England about 1200, finally settling in Forfarshire, Scot-
land, where they owned the lands of Tulloch, and took the
name Le Moyne de Tulloch, which was later changed to
Tulloch of Moyneville. In 1420, the family owned the
estates of Bonnington, near Montrose, and Tanachie, near
Forres, the latter property remaining in possession of the
family until 1772, when it was sold. Branches of this
family owned the estates of Bogton, West Grange, and
Earnhill, near Forres.
DAVID TULLOCH, of Bonnington (c. 1400), had, with
other issue, a son,
TULLOCH, of Tanachie, whose son,
ALEXANDER 1 ULLOCH, Laird of Tanachie,had a son,

Anderson of Tower Hill
JOHN WILSON ANDERSON, of Tower Hill Park
Estate, near Warrnambool, Victoria, was born at Girvan,
Ayrshire, Scotland, 26th March, 1840, and educated at
Girvan High School, and until he left for Australia, was
engaged in farming. While in Scotland he joined the
Ayrshire Yeomanry Cavalry. He arrived in Victoria in
1863 and took charge of Edward Wilson's experimental
farm at Arundel, Keilor, where he remained for five years.
He then joined the firm of Ryan and Hammond, stock and
station agents, Melbourne, as auctioneer, later taking up a
similar position with McGregor and Company, stock and
station agents, Warrnambool. He subsequently went into
land subdivision, and purchased several large estates, in
both Victoria and New South Wales, and it has been said
of him that more land passed through his hands than of
any other man in the Southern Hemisphere.
The principal properties handled by him, either alone or
with partners, were Mewburn Park; Yallack; part of the
Belfast Special Survey, which surrounded the town of Port
Fairy; part of Farnham Park Special Survey (which he
named Tower Hill Park Estate) ; this had been taken up
by William Rutledge in 1841 (see Rutledge family records
in this volume) ; Woodlands and Heyfield Estates, in Gipps-
land; Warrnambool Downs, in Queensland; and Kyogle
Estate, New South Wales, which included the site of the
present town of Kyogle.
Perhaps the most important subdivision in which Mr.
Anderson took part as a member of a syndicate, which
included Mr. Curtois, Mr. Morphett, and others, was that
of the Kyogle Estate, in the Northern Rivers District of
New South Wales. This was a property of 41,000 acres,
and is now part of one of the most important dairying
districts in New South Wales.
Mr. Anderson eventually subdivided all his Victorian and
New South Wales properties into small dairy farms, which
he let to tenants under the share farming system, of which
he may be said to be one of the originators. These holdings
were afterwards sold, in most cases to the share farmers who
had been working in conjunction with Mr. Anderson. He
was considered one of the best judges of land values in Aus-
tralia, and under his guidance, the properties acquired for
subdivision increased greatly in value; for example, the Tower
Hill Park Estate, which was part of the Farnham Survey,
increased in value from £3O per acre, which he paid for it,
to £7O and £BO per acre. There is no doubt that the sound
position of the dairying industry in Australia today owes
a lot to Mr. Anderson's foresight and driving force. He
watched jealously over the interests of the dairy farmer, and,
when in the old country, missed no opportunities of study-
ing the markets and of bringing back any ideas which he
thought would be of value to the industry. He was one ot
the founders and first chairman of directors of the lower
Hill Park Cheese and Butter Factory, opened in 1893,
which has been of such great benefit to the Western District
of Victoria. Mr. Anderson was also president of the Dairy-
men's Association of Victoria for some time.
Owing to Mr. Anderson's training as a farmer and his
experience as a stock and station agent, he was looked upon
as one of the best judges of cattle in Australia, and for
forty years was one of the judges in this connection at the
Royal Melbourne Show, and was also one of the five mem-
bers appointed to the Executive Council of the Society for
the purpose of formulating a scheme to provide for the
export of butter.
He took a keen interest in all local activities wherever he
was stationed, and was a well-known contributor to the
press on matters of local interest and more especially on
anything which tended to the good of the industry in which
he was so keenly interested. An appreciative article ap-
peared in the "British Australasian" at the time of Mr.
Anderson’s death, in which it described him as "that genuine,
genial, soft hearted, hard headed Scotsman." It has been
said of him that although he was reputed to be a shrewd
business man, with excellent judgment as to land values,
he never made money at another man's expense.
He married Emma, daughter of Charles Flaxman (see
Flaxman family records in this volume). She died at
Warrnambool, 13th June, 1902.
John Wilson Anderson died at East St. Kilda, Mel-
bourne, 22nd October, 1917, having had issue:—
i. John Reginald, b. Warrnambool, Vic., 31st Oct.,
1876. Ed. Warrnambool Coll., and Geelong
C.E.G.S. He m. Jean, daughter of S. Griffin-

2. Thomas.
1. Elizabeth.


ii. Leslie Wilson, b. Port Fairy, Vic., 24th March,
1885. Ed. Warrnambool Coll, and Melb. C.E.G.S.
He took up pastoral pursuits under his father,
with whom he was later associated in the sub-
division of the large estates which were cut up
and formed into dairying and pastoral farms,
many of which he controlled and managed. Pas-
toral properties held by Mr. Anderson have in-
cluded Kyogle Homestead Estate, N.S.W.; por-
tion of lower Hill Park, Springvale, near Shep-
parton; Wurrong and Woodlands properties, near
Camperdown; Mount Surprise, and portion of
I.Y.U. Estates, Pakenham. He was also engaged
in the stock and land agency business, having been
one of the principals, and auctioneer of the firm of
Gamble, Anderson, Lamb Pty. Ltd., of Berwick,
Vic. Mr. Anderson is known as a keen judge of
stock, and is considered an authority on pastoral
and dairying subjects, regarding which he has
made valuable contributions through the press.
He is a member of the Dandenong Agricultural
Society, and holds various public positions in the
district. He m. Isa, daughter of Rev. John Gray,
D.D., who was one of the best known ministers
of the Presbyterian Church, which he served for
forty-six years. A native of Perth, Scotland, Rev.
John Gray graduated at Glasgow University and
was minister at Irvine and St. George’s Road
parishes, Glasgow, before coming to Australia.
His first charge in Australia was St. Andrew’s,
Perth. For eight years he was in charge of Cairns
Memorial Church, East Melbourne, then seven
years in Warrnambool, and his last charge was
Gardiner Presbyterian Church, where he remained
for eleven and a half years, when he retired. He

Stewart of Inverary
JOHN STEWART, of Inverary and Louth Stations,
was born near Dundee, Scotland, 12th May, 1812, and
gained experience in pastoral pursuits before emigrating
to Australia. He landed in Adelaide in 1851 and, as the
gold rush had commenced in Victoria, overlanded to Ben-
digo, where he arrived in 1852, and tried his luck on the
fields with fair success. The journey from Adelaide to
Bendigo was no small undertaking at that time, and was
made by horse and bullock waggons. John Stewart remained
on the Bendigo fields for over a year, and then returned to
Scotland, where he married before returning to settle in
Australia in 1854, landing at Portland in that year. From
Portland he and his wife travelled by bullock dray to
Naracoorte, South Australia, where his brother, Alexander,
owned Moy Hall Station. John Stewart purchased the ad-
joining station, Messmurry, which he held until the end of
1864, when he sold out and came to the Hamilton (Vic-
toria) district and purchased, in 1865, Bochara Station,
10,880 acres, from Mr. Younger. This station he held for
one year only, selling out to Donald McKellar in 1867,
and returned to South Australia, where he purchased
Ardoon Station from his brother, William (later of Lyne
Station, near Hamilton, Victoria) ; Ardoon is now known
as Stewarts Ranges. John Stewart only held Ardoon for a
short time, and after selling it, came back to the Western
District of Victoria and purchased Inverary Station, 4,500
acres (where he resided until his death), from Mr.
Mclntyre; later on he also bought from Alexander David-
son, Louth Station, a property of 3,000 acres, near Mac-
arthur.
He married, in Scotland, Catherine Forbes Roberts,
daughter of a building contractor; she died at Hamilton,
29th September, 1901.
John Stewart died at Inverary Station, 15th May, 1881,
having had issue, four sons and four daughters, of whom we
now treat.
The eldest son,
JAMES STEWART, was born at Messmurry Station,
South Australia, 24th September, 1856, and educated at
Whinhams College, Adelaide, South Australia, and Hamil-
ton Academy, Victoria. He gained pastoral experience under
his father on Inverary and Louth Stations, of which he
became manager, and after his father’s death managed the
jsroperties for the executors until the estate was wound up.
He then purchased Berachah pastoral estate, near Hamilton,
which he carried on for twelve years, and then sold to
Mr. B. Reed. During the time he held Berachah, James
Stewart also managed Morgiana Station, near Hamilton,
for William Armstrong and Donald Munro.
After selling Berachah, he joined his brother, John G.
Stewart, in the purchase of Kanawalla Station, 14,900
acres, on the Wannon, near Hamilton (Kanawalla, when
first taken up by George Duncan Lockhart in 1843, had an
area of 55,615 acres, and carried 20,000 sheep; it was sub-
divided in 1850) and carried on this property for twelve

McCracken
THE founders of the McCracken family in Australia
were the brothers Robert and Peter McCracken, of
whom presently, and their brother, Alexander
McCracken, who, after some years residence in Australia,
returned to Scotland, and of whom we treat in the lineage
of the family.
ROBERT McCRACKEN was born at Ardwell,
Parish of Girvan, Ayrshire, Scotland, 24th March, 1813-
On the death of his father, he assisted his mother in
carrying on Ardwell, a farm in the Parish of Girvan, but
later on, when he received a business appointment in Man-
chester, England, his place on the farm was taken by his
younger brother, Peter. Some years later, when he found
that Peter had decided to go to Australia, he did not like
the idea of his young brother embarking on such a long
voyage alone, and decided to accompany him; so he took a
passage in the "Nimrod” and arrived in Port Phillip with
his brother in 1841. He established a business as an
importer and was also in partnership with his brother,
Peter, in a small pastoral property on the Merri Creek, near
Melbourne.
In 1851 Robert McCracken, his brother, Peter, and James
Robertson (Peter McCracken’s brother-in-law) established
a brewery in Collins Street West, trading as McCracken
and Robertson. Ten years later Mr. Robertson dropped out
of the partnership, his interest being acquired by the
McCracken brothers, and the firm name changed to that of
R. McCracken and Company. This business, which was
commenced with a staff of two and an output of four
hogsheads per day, became one of the largest businesses in
Melbourne, the brewery occupying four acres of ground.
Robert McCracken managed the business from its incep-
tion until his death, and its great success was due in a large
measure to his capable management. After Mr. McCracken’s
death the family still carried on the business, which, in
1888, became a public Company and was eventually amal-
gamated with the Carlton and United Breweries Limited.
He was well known in business circles.
He married Margaret (born Parish of Whiltorn, co.
Wigton, Scotland, 10th November, 1830, and died in
Melbourne, 19th September, 1905), daughter of John
Hannay and his wife, Margaret McMonnies, of Broughton
Mains, Wigtonshire, Scotland. (The Hannays, one of the
oldest families in Wigtonshire, Scotland, trace their an-
cestry back to 1306, and the branch married into the
McCracken family is of the Mochrim branch, and owned
the lands of Shermanton, Clayston and Tuso.)
Robert McCracken died in Melbourne, 17th February,
1883, having had issue, eight sons and two daughters, of
whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
JOHN McCRACKEN, was born at Essendon, Melbourne,
2nd October, 1853, and educated at Scotch College, Mel-
bourne. He joined the staff of R. McCracken and Com-
pany, Brewers, and died, unmarried, 11th December, 1879.
The second son,
ALEXANDER McCRACKEN, was born in Melbourne,
7th May, 1856, and educated at Scotch College, Melbourne.
After completing his education, he joined the firm of R.
McCracken and Company, Brewers, of which he became
Managing Director, and later Chairman of the Com-
pany. When McCracken’s City Brewery amalgamated
with Carlton and United Breweries Limited, Alexander
McCracken became a director in the latter firm. He was
well known in business circles in Melbourne, being a
director of many public companies, including the Trustees,
Executors and Agency Company Limited. He took a great
interest in the public affairs of Essendon, and was an Elder
of St. John’s Presbyterian Church for many years.
He was keenly interested in all branches of sport, and
was a founder of the Oaklands Hunt Club, in which he
took a life-long interest, and was also prominent in racing
circles, being a member, and on several occasions, chairman,
of the V.R.C. He owned well-known race horses, amongst
which may be mentioned "Knight of the Garter,” who won
the Australian Steeplechase in 1893, "Feud,” winner of the
Bagot Handicap in 1902, and "Mira,” who won the same
event in 1908; also "Sylvan Prince,” "Loch Fad,” and
"Scotch Malt.” Mr. McCracken was well known in athletic
circles, having been president of the Victorian Football
League from its inception for eighteen years, and the
founder of the Essendon Football Club. Other branches of
sport in which he was interested were cricket, bowls and
rowing. He was also many years president of the Royal
Agricultural Society of Victoria. Mr. McCracken was time-
keeper of the first aeroplane flight in Australia, when Harry
Houdini, in his Voisin biplane, performed the record Aus-
tralian flight at Diggers Rest, near Melbourne, on 21st
March, 1910, six miles in seven minutes, thirty-seven
seconds. The following is from a description of the flight:
"Mr. A. McCracken, well known in sporting circles, stop-
watch in hand, was timekeeper, and he called out the
minutes to the excited onlookers as the biplane circled
above them.”


He married, 19th September, 1884, Mary Elizabeth,
daughter ol John Murray Peck, of Lebanon, Pascoe Vale,
Melbourne. She was closely associated with the work of the
Women’s Hospital and the Carlton Refuge. She died at
Green Gables, Pascoe Vale, 28th July, 1938.

PETER McCRACKEN, of Thornbank, Northcote,
Melbourne, was born at Ardwell, Parish of Girvan,
Ayrshire, Scotland, 13th February, 1818, and educated at a
school in Girvan and at Ayr Academy, where he remained
until he was seventeen years of age. After his father’s
death, Ardwell had been carried on by his mother and
elder brother, Robert, but when the latter left for Man-
chester, England, to take up a position there, Peter
McCracken took his place on Ardwell. He later endeavoured
to procure a farm for himself, but was unsuccessful, and
In 1851, Peter McCracken, with his brother, Robert, and
James Robertson, formed a partnership and founded the
brewing firm of McCracken and Robertson; on Mr. Robert-
son’s retirement from the partnership in 1861, the firm
became known as R. McCracken and Company, Robert and
Peter McCracken being the partners. (The full details
regarding the McCracken Brewery will be found in the
records of the Robert McCracken branch of this family).
He was also one of the founders of the Port Phillip Farmers’
Society [later the Royal Agricultural Society] of Victoria),
in 1848, and a member of the first committee.
Peter McCracken, of Thornbank
Grace McCracken (nee Robertson)
about 1839 began to think of settling in Australia; his
mother, however, being opposed to his leaving Scotland,
he gave up the idea for the time being.
Some months after the death of his mother in 1840, he
decided to come out to Australia, and was joined at the
last minute by his brother, Robert. They sailed in the ship
"Nimrod” on 15th October, 1840, arriving in Port Phillip
on 4th January, 1841, where Peter McCracken obtained
employment for about twelve months, and in March, 1842,
purchased some land on the Merri Creek, in partnership
with his brother, Robert. Peter McCracken managed this
property for two years, but at the end of that period values
of land and produce had fallen so low that the brothers
lost practically everything. Peter McCracken, however,
persevered, and in 1846 leased for nine years a portion of
land in the Moonee Ponds district, from Mr. Niel Black,
which he named "Stewarton.”
Peter McCracken remained at "Stewarton” until March,
1855, after which he resided at Kensington for two years,
and then purchased a property at Essendon, naming it
"Ardmillan,” the name of the estate in Scotland on which
the McCracken family’s farm was situated. Here he
resided until 1871, when he moved to East Melbourne, and
in 1887 leased, and later purchased, "Thornbank,” North-
cote. He was one of the promoters of the old Essendon
railway, in which venture he lost a large sum of money. He
also owned Mount Poole and Calvert Downs Stations in
New South Wales.
He married, 20th March, 1846, Grace, daughter of
Coiler Robertson, a landholder on the Merri Creek, near
Melbourne. She died at Thornbank, Northcote, 10th
January, 1889.

October, 1892, having had issue, live sons and three daugh-
ters, of whom we now treat.

December, 1888.

lineage
The McCrackens were for many generations farmers in
the Parish of New Luce, Wigton, Scotland, and the first
mention we have of the family is found in extracts from
the Kirk Session records of that Parish, as under;—
"1696 Sabbath April 9th.
There were two Elders added to the Session, viz., John
Wallace, younger, and James McCracken, in Dongrie.”
In 1698 the said James McCracken is mentioned in the
following extract; —
"The Quarter seems originally to have consisted of two
farms, the two Dongries, which accounts for two
tennants being found in said farm further on.
Gilbert McMicking, Meltonies, is to oversee (as an
Elder) three towns (the word town is used in some


of the counties of Scotland for a farm or group of
houses) namely Meltonies, Glenkitten and Sigengam.
Adam McGill to oversee Graigoch and Dalingape.
Gilbert McMicking in Marklach, etc. James McCracken
and George McMicking to oversee the two Dongries,
the Close, etc.”
An extract from the Parish records of 31st July, 1726:
A number of Elders were ordained. Also William
McMicking in Darnemow and John McCracken in
Dongrie, being absent through indisposition, their
ordination was deferred till another date.”
John McCracken was ordained on 9th November, 1727.
A further extract of 31st October, 1729; —
This day the session convened prayer and private cen-
sure. John McCracken and Gilbert McMicking prayed
and then proceeded to censure, Patrick McWilliam
being removed and interrogated concerning his be-
haviour.”
JAMES McCRACKEN (c. 1696), farmer, of New Luce,
had a son,

Alsop
JOHN ALSOP. founder of this family in Australia,
was born in Derbyshire, England, 2nd November, 1809.
He owned large smelting works in Bonsall and Matlock
in Derbyshire, and also had an interest in one of the richest
lead mines in that country, situated at Lathkiln Dale. This
mine became flooded and ruined by a subterranean stream,
and caused severe financial loss to Mr. Alsop, so he decided,
on the advice of his friend, Col. Gawler (who had been
Governor of South Australia), to settle in Australia. He
was a keen geologist and a friend of Sir Charles Darwin.
Accompanied by his wife, four sons, and four daughters,
he sailed on 7th November, 1848, from England in the
ship "Sir Charles Forbes” (346 tons, Captain Prynne), and
arrived in Adelaide in April, 1849- On his arrival, Mr.
Alsop, in partnership with George Penny, immediately in-
terested himself in the smelting industry, and erected a
works at Glen Osmond. The smelters began operations in
1850, but in the following year gold was discovered in
Victoria, and all available labour went to the goldfields,
with the result that the works had to be closed down.
About this time the South Australian Government opened
an Assay Office, and Mr. Alsop, in conjunction with Dr.
E. Davey and Dr. Octavius Hammond, managed it until
1853, when the Victorian Government opened an Assay
Office, and John Alsop was appointed Assistant Manager.
The Victorian office, however, was closed shortly after-
wards, but John Alsop was appointed to an important
position in the Victorian Post Office, which he held until
his death.
John Alsop has recorded that on his arrival in Port
Phillip from Adelaide by the ship "Australia” (48 tons),
he was accompanied by his eldest son, John. They were
taken off the "Australia” in a small puffer steamer and
landed at a ti-tree jetty, then proceeded by omnibus to the
city.
On arrival of the other members of the family in May,
1854, in the schooner "Dazzler” (48 tons),the whole family
took up their residence in Henry Street, Windsor, where
they lived in what was then known as an imported Singa-
pore cottage of four rooms and a small kitchen, the rent
being £250 per annum.
John Alsop married, Ist October, 1836, at Duffield
Church, Derbyshire, Mary, second daughter of David Evans,
M.D., of Belper, Derbyshire. (She was one of a family of
sixteen, of whom four died young. All her brothers had
professions; John Harrison Evans, M.A., was Headmaster
of Sedbergh Grammar School, Yorkshire; George Fabian
Evans, M.D., of Edgbaston, Birmingham; Samuel H. Evans,
M.D., of Derby; Thomas Saunders Evans, D.D., Professor
at Durham University and Canon of Durham Cathedral;
David Peter Evans, M.D., of Belper, Derbyshire, and
Charles James Evans, M.D., of Belper. Three of the
brothers were Cambridge Wranglers). Mary Alsop (nee
Evans) died at Hawthorn, Melbourne, 25th August, 1886.
John Alsop died in Adelaide, South Australia, whilst on
holiday, 26th November, 1860, having had issue, five sons
and four daughters, of whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
JOHN ALSOP, was born at Hackney House, Darley
Dale, Derbyshire, England, 15th September, 1839, and
came out to Australia with his family in 1849. When
thirteen years of age, he joined the South Australian Assay
Office as a junior clerk, but on his father taking up an
appointment with the Victorian Government, he accom-
panied him to Melbourne in 1853, and the following
year received an appointment as junior clerk in the Mel-
bourne Savings Bank, now known as the State Savings Bank
of Victoria. Here he had a distinguished career, rising to
the position of Actuary, and later Actuary and Trustee
Manager. Under his management the Bank business ex-
panded greatly; he opened many branches in the suburbs,
and also wrote many pamphlets on the advantage of the
Savings Bank, advising the practise of thrift. In the course
of an article commenting upon Mr. Alsop’s activities in this
direction, the "Argus” of 6th November, 1883, stated;
"Mr. Alsop goes out, as it were, into the highways and
hedges, and compels the thoughtless and the extravagant to
come in to the feast of reason and independence which he
has prepared for them. We wish him every success in his
beneficent work.” He retired from the management of the
Bank in March, 1904, having served the institution for
fifty years.
He married, 6th April, 1865, Anne, daughter of Assistant
Commissary General Charles Howard, of the 40th Regiment
(see Howard family records in this volume). She died in
Melbourne, 27th July, 1920.
John Alsop died at Malvern, Melbourne, 20th October,
1925, having had issue:—

hold by homage and service. The descendants of Gweno

it was sold by Anthony Allsop in 1688. The following is
an extract from "The King's England, Derbyshire,” by
Hineage


Arthur Mee; John Alsop s Welcome—Alsop-en-le-Dale
—Set in lovely country, a mile from the river Dove and the
Staffordshire border, is this cluster of homes, an ancient
chapel and a great house with gables and windows, telling
us it is from the sixteenth century. To this secluded spot a
wanderer found his way four hundred years ago. He was
Thomas Becon, Chaplain to Cranmer and Protector Somer-
set, a preacher who preached himself from Canterbury
Cathedral into the Tower. Free once more, he sought ob-
scurity in travel, and found shelter here for a year with
John Alsop. Writing of his welcome: 'Coming into a
little village called Alsop-en-le-Dale, I chanced upon a
certain gentleman named Alsop, lord of the village, a man
not only ancient in years, but also ripe in the knowledge of
Christ s doctrine. After we had saluted one another and
taken a sufficient repast, he showed me certain books which
he called his jewels. I found there good wits and apt unto
learning.' The Alsops were lords of the manor for five
hundred years, till 1688, and two hundred years later their
descendants were again in the old home. The tiny chapel,
with a nineteenth century tower, has a Norman doorway
with unusual moulding like two rows of zig-zag. There is
a little Norman window in the south wall. The sides of the
pointed chancel arch, and the crudely shaped piscina niche
are perhaps Norman too."
One, Hugh de Alsopp, went with King Richard I to the
Holy Land and distinguished himself in the conquest of
Acre in 1191, for which he had bestowed upon him the
Order of Knighthood and coat-of-arms (Three plovers,
rising).
The name occurs at various periods as Elleshope, Alsopp,
Allsop, Alsop, etc.
SAMUEL ALLSOPP, of Burton-on-Trent, b. 1780, was
the great-great-grandson of Samuel Alsopp, of Derby
(c. 1680), and father of Sir Henry Allsopp, first Lord
Hindlip, whose descendant later re-purchased the village of
Alsop-en-le-Dale.
The immediate ancestor of the Australian branch of the
family was,
JOHN ALSOP, who owned lead mines and smelting
works in Derbyshire. He had a family of four daughters
and three sons. His eldest son,
JOHN ALSOP, who came to Australia in 1849, and of
whom we treat in the Australian section of this record.


Armytage
GEORGE ARMYTAGE, of Bagdad, Van Die-
men's Land, was born at Ticknall (now Tickenhall),
Derbyshire, in 1795. His early youth was spent in
Brussels, and he was later sent to the care of a relative in
Yorkshire, where he was educated. After studying engineer-
ing in London, he decided to settle in Australia, leaving
England on 28th February, 1815, in the sailing vessel
Hebe,” and arriving in Sydney on 10th August, 1815. In
"In the first week of May, 1836, I left George Town,
Van Diemen’s Land, with a small flock of sheep, in the
brig ’Henry.’ Five days after embarkation they were landed
at Williamstown, Port Phillip, where I found several, if
not all, of the first settlers, with their flocks, all of which
had been brought from Van Diemen’s Land within the five
or six previous months, and which were left in charge of
shepherds near the beach until suitable runs could be pro-
George Armytage,
of Bagdad, V.D.L., 1815; Inglehy, Victoria, 183(i
the following year he proceeded to Van Diemen’s Land
and received a grant of land.
George Armytage continued to improve his lands, and
was rewarded by the Government with a further grant of
1,000 acres, in 1826. His knowledge of engineering helped
him greatly in his pioneering work, and he constructed the
first water mill for grinding wheat, which proved of such
immense value to the surrounding settlers. He took a
prominent part in the early settlement of Van Diemen’s
Land, and was appointed an Honorary Magistrate.
The following is an extract from George Armytage’s
letter to Governor Latrobe in 1853: —
cured. I have no recollection of any serious depredations
having been committed by the aborigines at this time. The
wild dogs were very numerous and troublesome, and de-
stroyed several sheep. Their howling at night was terrific.
While at Williamstown, a Mr. Franks and I agreed to take
up a run together; Mr. Franks was to select it. After mak-
ing these arrangements I left my sheep and shepherd and
returned to Van Diemen's Land. About six weeks after I
received the melancholy intelligence of the murder of poor
Mr. Franks and my shepherd, both of whom had been
struck on the head by the blacks with a tomahawk while
making a bush fence for yarding the sheep on the new run


they had selected on Mount Cotterill, near the River Exe.
Shortly after, during the day, my son, Thomas, on riding up
to assist in making the yards, found the unfortunate Mr.
1 ranks and the shepherd lying on their faces, with the back
of their heads split open. About this time there were other
murders one at Indented Head. Captain Elat, a manager
lor Dr. Thomson, after being dreadfully beaten and left for
dead, recovered. Several other murders and robberies were
committed by the blacks, but I cannot particularise them.
After this my sheep were put into a flock of Judge Pedder’s,
in charge of Mr. Darke, where they remained until the
unfortunate circumstance of the loss of Messrs. Gellibrand
and Hesse. These gentlemen had been missing some time,
and doubts being entertained of their safety, my son, who
was an articled clerk to Mr. Gellibrand, went with four or
five others in search of the missing explorers in the direc-
tion where, from the information they had received, they
hoped to fall in with their tracks. After searching and
following the Barwon River in a westerly direction, about
thirty miles from Geelong they found the tracks of the lost
party, and followed them until they reached the place where
Mr. Gellibrand and Mr. Hesse had camped. On this spot
the searching party stayed during the night. Next morning
they continued following the tracks up the river until the
country became so stony and rough that they could not trace
the party further; consequently they struck off from the river
towards Lake Colac; and therefore, it was at this time, and
by this party, Lake Colac was first discovered, and also
Buninyong, Stony Rises, and other places.
"After the party returned, my son took the sheep to the
spot where he first found the track of Gellibrand’s party,
and where we have been ever since. This part of the country
has since been surveyed and marked off into counties and
parishes. Our station, named Ingleby, is in the parish of
Yan Yan Gurt, county Polwarth. The eastern side of my
Ingleby Station was taken up by Mr. Henry Hopkins, of
Hobart Town, and is now the property of his son, John
Hopkins, and called Wormbete. This property is con-
siderably improved. The station on the north side of
Wormbete was first taken possession of by Mr. W. Road-
knight, whose son is now in possession.”
The Mr. Franks who came over from Van Diemen’s
Land in the same boat as Mr. Armytage also had sheep
aboard the brig "Henry,” and apparently they joined forces,
this arrangement unfortunately being terminated by the
untimely death of Mr. Franks. It is of interest to note that
the record of the deaths of Mr. Franks and the shepherd
are the first and second entries on St. James’ Church register.
They were buried at Burial Hill, now called Flagstaff Hill.
Pastoral runs in Victoria held by George Armytage were:
Ingleby, on the Barwon River, near Winchelsea; Murran-
dara, near Apsley; Fulham, on the Glenelg River, near
Balmoral; Ganoo Ganoo, near Apsley; and Buntingdale.
He also held land at Mount Cotterill and Geelong, where
he later built the Hermitage (now the Church of England
Girls Grammar School) in 1852, the entrance gates of
which were among the earliest hand-wrought iron gates
brought into Victoria. They were made in Scotland, ex-
hibited at the first Victorian Exhibition, and still stand.
On his mother's death in Brussels on 24th March, 1850,
at the age of 80, his father, then 87 years of age, decided to
come out to Australia, accompanied by his widowed daugh-
ter, Mrs. Clarke, and her family, to spend his remaining
years with his son, George. On the arrival of George
Armytage, senior, by the ship "Constance,” four generations
of the family met at the Hermitage, Geelong, in 1853, and
in each generation present there was a George Armytage.
George Armytage, senior, died in December, 1853.
George Armytage married, in 1818, Elizabeth Peters
(died at the Hermitage in 1874, set. 72), whose father was
a Lieutenant in the Duke of York’s Regiment, and was later
transferred on service to a regiment in Van Diemen’s Land.
He died at the Hermitage, Geelong, 12th July, 1862,
aet. 67, and a contemporary in an obituary article which
appeared in the local newspaper described him as "an
upright, God-fearing man; clear-headed; firm of purpose;
vigorous in action; scrupulously just; a man looked up to
by all his acquaintances.”
Of the seven sons of George and Elizabeth Armytage:—
The eldest son,
THOMAS ARMYTAGE, was born at Bagdad, Van Die-
men's Land, 17th February, 1820. He was articled to Mr,
Gellibrand, solicitor, but in 1836 came over to Port Phillip
with his father, whom he represented in Port Phillip until
his death on 12th September, 1842. He was unmarried.
The second son,
GEORGE ARMYTAGE, was born at Bagdad, Van Die-
mens Land, 29th July, 1821. On his brother, Thomas’
death, he became his father’s representative in Port Phillip,
and for some years resided at Ingleby, which he later in-
herited. Family records show that he sold at public auction
on 31st March, 1877, the first wool stores in Geelong, on
the western beach. He was a Justice of the Peace for" Van
Diemen’s Land, and a member of the Melbourne Club. In
1872 he took his family to England and resided at Queen's
Gate, South Kensington.
George Armytage married Louisa Eulalie, daughter of
Francis FTexmore, of Green Ponds, Van Diemen’s Land,
and died at 59 Queen’s Gate, South Kensington, London"

Charles Henry Armytage, of Como
Como, South Yarra
The fourth son,
CHARLES HENRY ARMYTAGE, was born at Bagdad,
Van Diemen’s Land, 24th August, 1824. In 1857 his
father gave him Mostyn and Fulham Stations, and in 1863
he purchased Como, a property of 54 acres, at South Yarra.
This block had been purchased by A. Langhorne for £72
at the first sale of land held at Prahran on 10th June, 1840,
and the plan was the fifteenth made by the Melbourne and
Metropolitan Board of Works.
In 1865, in partnership with George Fairbairn, he pur-
chased Mount Sturgeon Station, 28,000 acres, carrying
about 30,000 sheep and 300 cattle, and later acquired Mr.
Fairbairn’s interest. He afterwards acquired North West
Bend Station, in South Australia.
His observations of the habits of the Australian native
showed him how rapidly these people cured scratches on
their arms and legs by chewing certain gum leaves, mixed
with a particular kind of earth, which they applied to their
wounds. He conferred with Dr. Day, of Geelong, on the
subject, and shortly afterwards a start was made in the
manufacture of eucalyptus oil, which has since become a
flourishing industry.
Charles Henry Armytage married, in 1856, at Wormbete,
Winchelsea, Victoria, Caroline Morrell, daughter of John
and Elizabeth (nee Councer) Tuckwell, of Eastleach,

Gloucestershire, England. The Tuckwell family arrived in
Melbourne about 1852 in the ship "Atalanta.” Mrs. C. H.
Armytage died at Como, 11th November, 1909. The fol-
lowing is an extract from the "Argus” at the time of her
death:—
"There is hardly a charitable institution in Melbourne
that will not miss the yearly gift of Mrs. Armytage, and her
private benefactions were also numerous. For seven years
Mrs. Armytage lived there (Fulham Station) without seeing
a town, and shopping first by a yearly and later by a
monthly mail, or at a hawker’s cart. She found time, not
only to teach all the children on the station, including those
of the Australian aborigines, to read, write, and sew; not
only to doctor all who needed her kind care, but also to
share in all the joys, and sorrows, of all in the neighbour-
hood. Often she referred to those early days as amongst
the happiest of her life, as she benefited by seeing so much
goodness arise from her teachings.”

26th April, 1876, having had issue:—

lowed pastoral pursuits and owned Wooloomanata Station,
near Lara, Victoria, on which he built a homestead from
stone taken from the property, the timber being brought
from Van Diemen’s Land. He also owned Mossgiel and
Nocoleche Stations in New South Wales, and Norley,
Bimbra, Thargomindah and Eulbertie Stations in Queens-
land.
He was a great lover of horses, and his coach, drawn bv
four magnificent specimens, used to attract much attention
in the early days. During his world travels he collected
many valuable pictures, some of which were exhibited in
the National Gallery in Melbourne and later acquired by the
Trustees. Many of the Victorian and visiting Governors
were entertained by Mr. Armytage at Wooloomanata, which
was renowned for its good pheasant shooting. The picture
gallery at Wooloomanata was also an attraction to visitors.
Both Mr. Armytage and his wife took a great interest in the
welfare of the aborigines around Wooloomanata, one of
whom, Billy Leigh, "king” of the tribe, was baptised and
confirmed at the Church of England at Lara. King Billy
used to boast that he had "shaken hands with more Govern-
ors than any other aborigine,” and Lord Hopetoun had a
special medal engraved for him. When he died in 1912,
the family erected an upright cross on his grave in the
Eastern Cemetery, Geelong, inscribed: ”ln memory of Billv
Leigh, last of the Leigh tribe, died August, 1912. Friend
for over sixty years of the Armytage family.”

Willis of Koolomurt
EDWARD WILLIS, of Koolomurt Station, Vic-
toria, was born at Hornsby, England, 12th September,
1816, and came out to Tasmania with his father in
the ship "Courier,” arriving at Hobart Town, 21st Decem-
ber, 1823. He remained at his father's estate, "Wanstead,”
near Campbell Town, where he gained pastoral experience,
well-known pastoral properties in the Geelong district—
Murgheboluc, Paywit, Ocean Grove, Point Lonsdale, Gnar-
warre and Native Creek No. 3. In 1846 the partnership
also acquired Kout Narin Station, near Harrow, a run of
112,000 acres, and two years later subdivided it into Kout
Narin and Kadnook, the latter portion being sold to
Edward Willis
until he was twenty-one, and then decided to follow those
pioneers who were opening up the new country of Port
Phillip. His brother, William, joined him, and his father,
Richard Willis, presented them with five hundred young
ewes and several rams from his pure-bred Merino stud, the
foundation of which was fifty ewes and three rams pur-
chased by Richard Willis from the Royal Stud of King
George 111 and imported into Van Diemen's Land in 1824.
The brothers arrived in Port Phillip in the month of
April, 1837, and first took up a run at the junction of the
Plenty and Yarra Rivers. In 1844 Edward Willis entered
into partnership with Captain Charles Swanston (his father-
in-law) as merchants in Geelong, trading under the name
of Swanston and Willis. Captain Swanston died in 1850,
his interest being taken over by his son, Charles Lambert
Swanston, and the firm became one of importance in the
Colony. The partnership, which lasted until 1854, held
William M. Bell. Kout Narin was finally subdivided into
Chetwynd, Moree, or Pigeon Ponds, and Koolomurt, and
Edward Willis retained Koolomurt portion, which he held
until his death.
Edward Willis established a line stud and bred a flock of
Merino sheep from the foundation of pure Merinos pre-
sented to him by his father; he became one of the best
known studmasters in Victoria, and Koolomurt Merinos
were known all over Australia.
In 1844 what was known as the Forlonge pure Merino
flocks (see Templeton family records in this volume) came
into his keeping, by arrangement with Sir William Mitchell,
into whose hands they had fallen, and selected rams were
used in his stud. He also used rams from the Hon. William
Campbell’s pure "Camden” flock. Always keen on improv-
ing the Koolomurt flock, he travelled through Germany in
1860, and brought back specially picked rams, which he


used in some of the Koolomurt stud families. In 1880 he
had 10,000 breeding ewes on Koolomurt.
Mr. Willis made many trips between Australia and
England, having a residence, "Courteen Hall,” in Hants,
England, and in 1894 he retired from pastoral activities to
reside at his property, "Seven Oaks,” in Kent, England.
He died at Goring-on-Thames, 9th August, 1895.
He married at Hobart, Tasmania, 12th September, 1840,
Catherine (born 21st January, 1822, and died in England,
1892/93), daughter of Captain Charles Swanston, by his
wife, Georgiana Sherson. (Captain Charles Swanston was
born in Berwickshire, Scotland, in 1790. He was an officer
in the Madras Native Infantry, and arrived at Hobart Town
from India in H.M.S. "Success" on 4th June, 1829. He
brought £IO,OOO with him, and purchased much land. He
was manager of the Derwent Bank in the early thirties,
holding office until 1849. In 1832 Governor Arthur ap-
pointed him a member of the Legislative Council, in which
capacity he gave able service to the Colony until his resig-
nation in 1848. He took an active interest in the mercantile
affairs of Tasmania and also in the squatting and mercantile
affairs of Port Phillip. Swanston Street, Melbourne, bears
his name. In 1849 he followed the gold rush to San Fran-
cisco, but died on the return voyage, in September, 1850.)
Edward Willis and his wife, Catherine Swanston, had
issue, three sons and three daughters, of whom we now
treat.
The eldest son,
NOWELL D’ORVILLE WILLIS, was born at Koolo-
murt Station, Victoria, 30th May, 1846, and educated at

turned to Victoria in the early seventies, and took up pas-
toral pursuits on Koolomurt Station, which he managed for
his father until 1888. After three years residence at Hamil-
ton, he went to Nareen Station, and two years later to
Kolor Station, near Penshurst. He also held an interest in
Bulgroo Station, Adavale, Queensland with his brother,
Herbert Sherson Willis (q.v.), from 1878 to 1911.

took up pastoral pursuits on Koolomurt Station. Five years
later he went to New Zealand and spent a year on his
uncle's (Charles Swanston’s) property in the Otago dis-
trict. After his return to Victoria, he managed Shadwell
Park property, near Mortlake, and later leased Glenmore
pastoral property, near Bacchus Marsh. In 1888 he was
appointed manager of Yanko Station, near Jerilderie, New
South Wales, for Sir Samuel Wilson, a position he held for
six years, when he had to resign owing to failing health.
He also leased Kilnoorat pastoral property, near Camper-
down, Victoria, but retired from pastoral activities in 1913,

quence of his spirited conduct in the capture of Priest,’ a
noted bushranger, in which he and his horse were both

Swan
WILLIAM SWAN, Victorian pioneer, was born
at larbet, Loch Fyne, in the West of Scotland,
in 1815. He was engaged in sheep farming on
his father s farm at Loch Awe until he decided to settle in
Australia. He sailed from Greenoch on 20th July, 1839,
in the ship "Palmyra,’’ 446 tons register (Captain Peter
Brown), arriving at Port Phillip on 24th November, 1839.
A number of Victorian pioneer families came out on the
same voyage, including the Armstrong family.
On arrival he was engaged by Mr. Neil Black to manage
Glenormiston Station, and remained there for eight years,
then for a brief period managed Kaladbro Station. In 1849
he purchased Ardgarten Station, 9,000 acres, near Branx-
holme, which he sold to Duncan McCallum in 1853, and
acquired Nangeela Station, 16,000 acres, near Casterton.
He sold Nangeela to William McPherson in 1857, and
purchased Koonongwootong Estate, 30,000 acres, in the
same year, and held it until his death. William Swan had
other pastoral interests in Victoria, including Warrianga,
later known as Sandy Water Holes, and Koroite Station,
near Coleraine; also Cove Station, 32,000 acres, near Ser-

his brother, Donald.
He was a well-known breeder of sheep and Hereford
cattle, and was much in demand as judge at the local shows.
He was a Councillor of Wannon Shire for several years, and
a strong supporter and benefactor of the Presbyterian
Church, and presented the land on which the church and
manse are built at Coleraine.

of this family, which has had a most distinguished legal
and political record in Victoria, was born in co. Cork,
Ireland, 17th September, 1817. He studied law, being the
first member of this family to enter the legal profession,
and practised in the City of Cork until 1850, when he
removed to London and established a practice there. Six
years later he decided to settle in Australia, and arrived in
Melbourne on 10th January, 1857, accompanied by his
wife, seven sons and a daughter. He established a practice
in Melbourne, which he carried on successfully for many
years.

and received his early education in London and France; on
the family’s arrival in Melbourne, he attended St. Patrick’s
College. He studied law, was articled to his father, and
eventually became a member of the legal firm of Hardy and
Madden, of Ballarat, and later of Pearson and Madden,
solicitors, of Ballarat. He was interested in military mat-
ters, and was an officer in the Ballarat Militia for many
years. He was also a keen rifle shot, and a well-known
oarsman.
He married Harriette, eldest daughter of Thomas Le Gay
Holthouse, M.D., who came out from England in the early
days of the gold diggings and practised his profession in

seat in Parliament until 1876, when he was elected a mem-
ber for Sandridge (afterwards Port Melbourne). He was
also Minister for Justice in the short-lived Service Ministry.
In 1883 he retired from political life in order to devote
himself exclusively to his profession.
Twice during his career he was offered an appointment as

FRANK MADDEN (afterwards Sir Frank Madden),

1847, and received his early education in London and
France, and at St. Peter’s College, Melbourne.
He commenced a career on the land as jackeroo on St.
Enochs Station, near Skipton, under Captain Gardiner, but
later became articled to his father, studied law at Mel-
bourne University, and graduated, after which he founded
the legal firm of Madden and Butler, Melbourne, and
became a recognised authority on Constitutional Law.
He first entered politics as a member for the Eastern
Suburbs in 1894, and retained that seat until 1904, when a
redistribution of seats took place. Standing for Boroondara,
he was successful, and was elected to the Speakership, a
position he held until 1918. He was knighted in June,
1911.
Always interested in the land, he owned a farming
property, "Narrarwhurrut,” near Scotts Creek, on the Curdie
River, for twenty-five years, and experimented in the grow-
ing of English grasses to ascertain those most suitable for
sowing in Victoria. His interest in both agricultural and
irrigation matters was such that he was regarded as an
authority.
Hunting and racing were his chief recreations. As a
member of the Melbourne Hunt Club, he followed the
Melbourne hounds for many years, and in his younger days
was an amateur rider, riding in several steeplechases. He
was for some years a member of the committee of the

Bryant
EDMUND BRYANT, of Van Diemen’s Land and
Cairn Curran Station, Victoria, was born in England
(c. 1794), being a member of an old Somersetshire
family, and heir of his grandfather, Edmund Bryant, who
died at the age of 112.
Edmund Bryant held a commission in the British Army,
but sold out previous to coming out to Australia. He took
this step on the recommendation of his brother-in-law, who
was then Surveyor-General of the Colony of New South
Wales, which at that time controlled Van Diemen’s Land
and Port Phillip (Victoria), and landed in Van Diemens
Land about 1826, where he, like many other ex-army
officers, received a grant of land, and engaged in sheep
breeding from pure stock imported by him.
In 1846 he came over to Port Phillip, and was for some
time at Charlotte Plains Station with Mr. H. N. Simson.
He was also one of the founders of the Immigration Society
in 1846. In 1848 he acquired Cairn Curran, a property at
that time of 100,090 acres (on the Loddon River and
Muckleford Creek, including Mount Tarringower, where
the town of Maldon is now situated), from John McLaren
and John Cunningham, but died later and was buried on
the property.
He married, before his departure from England, Jane,
daughter of Matthew Baley Mogg, of Somersetshire. She
was born in 1798, and died in Melbourne in 1894. They
had issue, three sons and two daughters, of whom we now
treat.
The eldest son,
MATTHEW BRYANT, of Cairn Curran, was born in
Van Diemen’s Land, 15th February, 1828. He gained his
pastoral experience on the family property, and, in 1854,
in partnership with his brother, William, took over the
property, later purchasing the freehold. When the brothers
married they took up separate residences, and Matthew
Bryant continued to reside at Cairn Curran. About 1883
he left Cairn Curran and took up his residence at a small
property which he purchased at Winters ITat, Castlemame,
leaving Cairn Curran in the hands of his sons, William
Cross Yuille and Matthew, who conducted it for many
years. He was considered an expert judge of stock and a
successful breeder of blood horses, Shorthorn and Alderney
cattle.
He married Betsy, daughter of William Cross Yuille,
Australian pioneer (see Yuille family records in this
volume).
Matthew Bryant died at Winters Plat, Victoria, 3rd July,
1886, having had issue:—

Philip of Miga Lake
CAPTAIN JOHN PHILIP was born in Aber-
deen, Scotland, 28th September, 1811. He entered
the Mercantile Marine, in which he attained the
position of master, and commanded the sailing ship, "Bon
Accord,” which traded between Aberdeen and Baltic ports.
His father-in-law, Thomas Robertson, of Ballater, Aber-
deenshire, had emigrated to Port Phillip in 1839, and wrote
home glowing accounts of the new country, as will be seen
Captain John Philip,
of Miga Lake
in the following extract from a letter which he sent to his
daughter and son-in-law, dated at Melbourne, 24th February,
1840; "This is a beautiful country as far as I can see; it is
but thinly wooded and scarcely any land cultivated yet. I
have been up the country about ten miles, and it is the best
pasture I have ever seen.” It was no doubt letters such as
this which induced Captain Philip to decide to settle in
Port Phillip.
In August, 1846, he sailed from Aberdeen in the barque
"Morayshire,” 316 tons, Barclay master, accompanied by his
wife, son Thomas, and daughter Elizabeth, arriving at their
destination on 20th January, 1847. After residing for some
time at Mount Mitchell Station with his father-in-law,
Captain Philip purchased Victoria Lagoon Station from
Peter Purton, in 1848, a property of 28,000 acres, near
Cavendish. When the gold rush took place, he was left
without servants of any kind, and the position was made
more serious by the fact that the blacks in that part of the
country were untrustworthy. When the wool from Victoria
Lagoon had to be taken to Portland there was only one
white man left on the station with Mrs. Philip, who always
carried a gun when she ventured outside the bounds of the
homestead. So scarce was labour that the children had to
assist with the shepherding of the sheep. One day, Thomas,
then about eight, was out watching the flocks, and had taken
Margaret Philip
(nee Robertson)
his younger brother, James, with him. Fog came down, the
boys lost their way, and failed to reach the homestead at
night, and two days and two nights elapsed before a search
party found them. Their rescue was mainly due to an old
blackfellow known as Jackie, who took up the tracks of the
sheep, which the boys were still looking after. Jackie lay
down on their tracks all night, and started to follow them
before dawn the next morning by the aid of a blazing fire-
stick. Shortly after daybreak, he was heard to call out:
"Me soon find ’em now,” and sure enough, a little further
on the two boys were found, suffering from exposure. It is
interesting to note as an instance of the fidelity of the
blackfellow, that Jackie, although given bread and meat by
Mrs. Philip before setting out on his search, never touched
food until the children were found. Needless to say, Jackie
was looked after by the Philip family for the rest of his
days.

Captain Philip hcdd Victoria Lagoon Station until 1856,
when it was sold to Thomas and Andrew Chirnside. In the
following year he purchased Miga Lake and St. Mary’s Lake
Stations, between Harrow and Horsham; these properties
together comprised over 100,000 acres, but as the area was
too large for him at the time, he sold St. Mary’s Lake por-
tion to his brother-in-law, Thomas Robertson, but re-pur-
chased it in 1872 from Alex. Wilson.
Captain Philip, although missing the depression of the
early forties, had still to put up with the hardships which
fell to the lot of the early pioneer. He had great trouble
with the rabbit pest, which brought his percentage of lambs
from 80 to 30 during the period 1879 to 1886, but he won
the fight against the pest, as in 1889 the percentage was
back to 80.
He took a great interest in local matters in the different
districts where he resided. He was a member of the first
North Harrow Roads Board, to which he was elected on
10th August. 1865, remaining a member until 1867, and
was again elected in 1870. He was appointed Chairman of
the Board in 1871, holding the position until the Board
ceased to function in IS~2. The Board was succeeded by
the Kowree Shire Council, of which Mr. Philip was first
president, and he remained a member of the Council until
his death.
He married, in 1839, Margaret, daughter of Thomas and
Annie (nee Lauchlin) Robertson, of Ballater. Aberdeen-
shire, Scotland, and later of Mount Mitchell Station. Port
Phillip (see Robertson of Mount Mitchell family records
in this volume). She died at Miga Lake Station, 9th
January, 1909.
Captain John Philip died at Miga Lake Station. 10th
May, 1881, having had issue, five sons and two daughters,
of whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
THOMAS PHILIP, was born at Ballater, Aberdeenshire,
Scotland, 26th December, 1844, and arrived in Port Phillip
with his parents in 1847. He received his education at Mr.
James Elliott s school at Cavendish. He followed pastoral
pursuits on Miga Lake, his father s station, until the death
of the latter, when the properties were carried on by the
Philip brothers. The partnership added to its holdings
Ascot Heath and Cape Wrath, and leased Wanwin, Hatton
Hills and Rifle Downs. Thomas Philip managed Miga Lake
Station until 1883, when he took over the management of
St. Mary s Lake Station. The partnership between the
brothers was dissolved in 1896, and on the division of the
properties, Thomas Philip retained St. Mary’s Lake Station,
which was renamed St. Mary’s, and there built a homestead.
In 190 7 he purchased Koornong Station. 6.600 acres, from
Alex. Armstrong, and held it until 1919, when it was
acquired by the Ellis Brothers.
As an expert Merino sheep breeder, Thomas Philip’s
services were much sought after at the various country
shows, including Balmoral Show, at which he judged for
twenty-five years. He also judged at the Sheepbreeders’
Shows in Melbourne and Tasmania. He was a member of
the Kowree Shire Council from 10th August, 1882, to 19th
July, 1886. In 1913 he retired from active pastoral work,
and resided at "Kenmure,” Hamilton.
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Philip,
of St. Mary’s Lake Station
He married, 25th August, 1883, Margaret, daughter of
James and Mary Laidlaw, of Roxburghshire, Scotland, who

The third son,

near Cavendish, Victoria, 6th December, 1854, and re-
ceived his education at Hamilton Academy and Geelong
College. He commenced his pastoral career at Miga Lake
Station, where he remained until 1879. On the death of
his father, he became a partner in the Philip Brothers’
estates, and managed Ascot Heath and Wanwin. When the
properties were divided in 1896, John Philip was allotted
Ascot Heath, and also held a lease of Wanwin. In 1901
he purchased Moralla Estate, near Cavendish, but only held
it for a year, when he purchased Englefield Estate, near

tension, he was a member of the Toolondo-Cavendish Rail-
way League, and was also one of the body of men who took
a prominent part in the movement for the construction of
the railway from Heywood to Mount Gambier. At the time
of his death, an obituary notice described him as "a man of
sterling character, whose word was always accepted as his
bond."

Swan, of Koonong-wootong Station, Coleraine (see Swan
family records in this volume). She died at Glencairn,

The fourth son,
WILLIAM PHILIP, was born at Victoria Lagoon
Station, 30th May, 1858, and received his education at
Hamilton Academy and Geelong College. Fie took up pas-
toral pursuits under his father at Miga Lake Station, and
later joined the family partnership. When this partnership
purchased Cape Wrath Station (now known as Murroa) in
1884, he became manager, conducting it for seven years,
when he took over the management of Harton Hills Estate
William Philip,
of Kenilworth
(now Riponhurst), near Macarthur. When the partnership
of the Philip Brothers was dissolved in 1896, he acquired a
small pastoral property, Violet Creek, near Hamilton. Four
years later he entered into partnership with John Fenton
in Kenilworth Estate, near Cavendish, and later Tahara
South, on the Wannon. On the dissolution of partnership,
William Philip took over Kenilworth Station, and John
Fenton retained Tahara South. In 1910 William Philip
disposed of Kenilworth Estate and purchased Mount Wil-
liam, a property of 20,000 acres, which he held until 1920.
During the time he was at Mount William he leased, in
1917, Skene Station for his son, William, who was then
abroad with the A.1.F., and managed it until the latter’s
return in 1918. After selling Mount William Station he
purchased portion of Barton Estate, which he renamed
Merymbuela.
He was a Merino flockmaster of note, and also an expert
in pastoral stock in general. He took a keen interest in local
affairs, was twenty-one years a member of the South Riding
of the Dundas Shire Council, of which he was president
for six terms, and in recognition of his great work in the
Council, was presented with an illuminated address in 1910.
He was also a member of the Hamilton P. and A. Society
and the Hamilton Racing Club. Through his generosity,
Hamilton Swimming Pool was formed, Mr. Philip defray-
ing the cost of the weir in the Grange Creek. During the
War he was a prominent worker for all patriotic move-
ments, and a leading member of the Soldiers’ Fathers'
Association. The Soldiers’ Memorial at Melville Oval,
Hamilton, was largely the result of his generosity. A
prominent Presbyterian, he was an Elder of that Church
for many years.
He married Amelia Frances Jane, daughter of J. C
Hamilton, of Bringalbert Station, a well-known Victorian
pioneer pastoralist, who came to Port Phillip in 1841.
William Philip died at Braeside, Hamilton, 25th April,
1933, having had issue:—

resumed pastoral pursuits at Skene Station, which
had been leased for him by his father. At expira-
tion of lease the property was sold, and W. H.
Philip acquired the homestead portion, together
with 3,000 acres, which he later sold to James G.
Robertson, and purchased Narmbool Estate, Bal-
larat district, selling it nine months later to the
Closer Settlement Board. In 1924 purchased
Brung Brungle, Wannon, and seven years later
Bangwarren, adjoining Brung Brungle; Brung
Brungle was sold in 1936, and Mr. Philip then
acquired Strathvean Estate, near Cressy. A year
later he sold this property to Frank Armytage, of
Basset, Branxholme (now of Spray Farm, Bella-
rine), and purchased the latter's estate, Cherritta,
Branxholme, which he still holds. In Jan., 19-40,

Hamilton of Polkemmet
Robert Hamilton was bom in Scotland, 19th
December, 1819, and at the age of nineteen accom-
panied his brother and sister to Australia, where they
had decided to settle. The family party, which consisted
ol the two Hamdton brothers, their sister, Katharine (Mrs.
Kenneth Kirkland), and her husband and infant daughter,
Agnes, sailed from Greenock, Scotland, in the barque
"Renown" (Captain McLean) on Bth June, 1838, and
building in course of construction, the well-known "Mack’s
Hotel." I'he Hamilton brothers first visited Mr. Fisher’s
station, and, while there, met their old friend, Mr. Yuille,
who had taken up Ballarat Station, near Mount Boninyong;
on Mr. Yuille’s invitation, Robert Hamilton remained at
Ballarat Station until his brother and brother-in-law had
settled on their new run, "Trawalla,” when he joined them.
A few months later he returned to Mr. Yuille’s station
Robert Hamilton
arrived in Hobart Town, Van Diemen’s Land, about the
middle of October of the same year. They crossed over to
Launceston and remained in Tasmania for a few weeks,
when James and Robert Hamilton, accompanied by their
brother-in-law, Kenneth Kirkland, crossed over to Port
Phillip in the forty-ton cutter "Aquilla.” They made a
quick trip of two days, and after landing in Melbourne,
stayed at Fawkner’s Hotel, which at that time was the only
brick building in Melbourne; James McGregor Hamilton
and his brother-in-law decided to take up a pastoral run,
and the latter returned to Van Diemen's Land to arrange
for bullock drays, horses, etc., for the station which they
hoped to form.
A week later, the two Hamilton brothers journeyed to
Geelong. Robert Hamilton, in his diary, recorded that the
only building in Geelong at that time was a weatherboard
store belonging to James Ford Strachan. There was another
Margaret Hamilton (nee Ballingall)
where he remained for six months and was then appointed
by the Livingstone Learmonths as overseer on Burrumbeet
run, in October, 1839, his salary being £SO a year and
found. Later, the Learmonths made an exchange with
Lauchlan Mackinnon, who had settled on the Loddon River,
giving Mackinnon two flocks of about 2,000 sheep, and
receiving from Mackinnon a mixed herd of cattle (five
ewes for one beast). It was arranged that Robert Hamilton
should take the sheep to Mount Fyans, Mackinnon’s station,
and be employed by Mackinnon, being given leave to pas-
ture 350 ewes for three years and their increase.
After remaining for a year at Mount Fyans, Robert
Hamilton made arrangements with Messrs. Lang and Elms
to pasture his sheep on Terrinallum Station, and to pay his
share of expenses. Two years later, about 1845, his Hock
had increased to 900. About this time the Baillies, who had
been at Carngham, gave up the property and suggested that


Robert Hamilton should join them in a partnership, and
take up a run, on the understanding that the Baillies pur-
chased an equal number of sheep. The partners went down
to the Glenelg and struck north to the Wimmera country,
where they found a large area of unoccupied land, and in
April, 1846, took up Polkemmet Station, a property of
96.000 acres, fifteen miles north-west of Horsham, which
had been previously held for about a year by the Wilson
brothers. The licence of the run was first taken out in the
name of Lady Mary Baillie and Robert Hamilton, but in
the following year Lady Baillie transferred her interest to
her son, Thomas Baillie. This partnership lasted until 1848,
when the property was divided into Polkemmet and Wyn
Wyn, the former being taken over by Thomas Baillie and
the latter by Robert Hamilton.
In 1853 Robert Hamilton acquired York Plains run,
38.000 acres, near St. Arnaud, from John Matheson, and
two years later disposed of Wyn Wyn to the Eirebraces.
He remained at York Plains until 1859, when it was sold
to Colin W. Simson, and in 1863 purchased "Mooralla”
pastoral estate, on the Wannon, near Hamilton, from Wil-
liam Fraser. This was a subdivision of Kanawalla Station.
He married Margaret, daughter of James Ballingall, of
Kirkcaldy, Scotland. She died at Melbourne, Ist October,
1902.
Robert Hamilton died at Smeaton, Victoria, 23rd October,
1905, having had issue;—

Molesworth
SIR ROBERT MOLESWORTH, Knt, of "Ed-
lington, Melbourne, Victoria, was born in Dublin,
Ireland, 3rd November, 1806, and received his education
at Trinity College, Dublin University, where he graduated
B.A. in 1826. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1828 as a
member of King's Inn, and took his M.A. degree in 1833.
After practising in Dublin for some years, he decided to
settle in Australia, and landed in Adelaide in 1852, with
Bench for thirty years, during which period he presided in
the Equity Court as Chief Judge of the Court of Mines.
Mr. Justice Molesworth was recognised as one of the
greatest equity lawyers of his time. There was no appeal
against decisions of the Court of Mines except to the Privy
Council, and he administered the mining law at a time
when there was much litigation in connection with disputes
over mining leases, and with little precedent to guide him.
Sir Robert Molesworth
the intention of taking up land, but abandoned the idea,
and came over to Melbourne in 1853 and commenced prac-
tice, being admitted to the Lower Bar in 1854. He entered
the Victorian Legislative Assembly and was Solicitor-General
in the Haines Ministry of 1855. While holding the position
of Solicitor-General, he appeared for the prosecution with
the then Attorney-General, Mr. William Foster Stawell
(later Chief Justice Stawell) at the trial in February, 1855,
of the Eureka rioters.

A unique incident occurred on his taking leave of the
Bar when retiring in 1886. The Court was crowded with
barristers in wig and gown, who, at the close of the leave-
taking, cheered the grand old man till the corridors of the
new Law Courts gave back the acclaim.
On his retirement, Mr. Justice Molesworth received the
honour of Knighthood.
He married, on 6th January, 1840, Elizabeth Henrietta
(died in 1879), daughter of the Rev. Joseph England
Johnson, of Dublin.

of twenty years he gained a considerable reputation as a
pleader in criminal cases. In January, 1884, he was raised

McLaurin
JAMES McLAURIN, one of the most prominent
pastoral pioneers of the Riverina district, arrived at Port
Jackson, New South Wales, with his family, on 20th
January, 1838. The family party included his wife, twelve
children (two of the family of fourteen having died in
infancy in Scotland), sons-in-law, and grandchildren,
twenty-eight in all. Shortly after James McLaurin’s arrival
in Sydney, he was appointed manager of Dr. Bowman’s
run, Segenhoe, on the Hunter River, which at that time ran
8,000 sheep and 600 cattle; the station workers were
assigned servants and anything but reliable. The family
made the journey, which occupied a fortnight, by bullock
dray, and after remaining at Segenhoe for about a year,
moved to Bongurabee Estate, which Mr. McLaurin managed
for Charles Smith for a few months, and then took charge
of Nill End Station for Robert Crawford.
In 1841 James McLaurin decided to overland to Port
Phillip, and was accompanied by his family, with the ex-
ception of his son, Archibald, who had in the previous year
overlanded sheep to the new Colony, and his son, James,
who had been for some time engaged with Ephraim Howe
in overlanding stock from New South Wales to Adelaide.
After arriving at Port Phillip with their stock, which they
grazed on land where Brighton is now situated, they re-
corded that at this time the only building of any kind at
what is now St. Kilda was Baxter’s stockyard. They later
rented Mordialloc Station until about 1845, when they
removed all their stock to Riverina. The McLaurin family
were best known as owners of the following stations in
Riverina: Cornalla and Jaropua, on the Murray and Ed-
wards Rivers; Yabba Yabba, on the Mitta Mitta River;
Moroco, Derulaman and Yarra Yarra. The last mentioned
station was 100,000 acres in extent.
While the McLaurins held Yarra Yarra, pleuro-pneu-
monia first appeared amongst cattle in New South Wales,
and the Yarra Yarra herd, of many thousands, being sus-
pect, authority ordered it to be slaughtered. Yards were
erected on the banks of a chasm, and into these yards the
cattle were driven and slaughtered, and the carcasses burned.
Although a certain amount of compensation was paid, the
Joss to the McLaurins amounted to more than £40,000. In
1833 the McLaurins erected a flour mill at Albury at a cost
of about £B,OOO. This venture proved a great success, and
after it was established, Moroco Station was purchased for
£25,000, with 3,000 head of cattle thrown in.
During the family’s ownership of Yarra Yarra, Morgan,
the bushranger, held up one of the station supply waggons
and sent his thanks and best wishes to Mr. McLaurin, who,
on learning where Morgan was camped, called his hands
together, armed them as best he could, and himself armed
with an old sword, sallied forth like a Highland chieftain
of old, to do battle with the bushranger, and if possible,
capture him, but when the camp was reached "the bird had
flown”- -back to Yarra Yarra homestead, where he helped
himself to valuables and provisions, while his pursuers were
at his deserted camp, miles away.
During the disastrous bushflre in 1851 known as Black
Thursday, the McLaurins were engaged in droving cattle,
and James McLaurin, Junior, in his "'Memories of Early
Australia,” gives the following graphic description of the
great fire. After recording that they camped on Mangalore
Plain on sth February, 1851, the night before Black Thurs-
day, he states: ""The sun rose like a ball of fire and when we
got past Mangalore Station, could not get the fat cattle and
bullocks to travel with heat, so we turned the fat cattle and
bullocks into a bend of the Goulburn, where there was
plenty of green grass and water. About 10 or 11 o'clock a
great wind storm arose and with the thick smoke from the
bush fires it became almost dark as night. We could scarcely
see. Being in that fine green bend, we escaped all the fire
which was raging around us some distance away. Drew
cattle up to Seymour in the evening and started for Mel-
bourne next morning, crossing the Goulburn early in the
morning. Up the running creek past Ferguson’s pub at
Broadford, the country was all on fire from Ferguson's to
the Bridge Arms on the Plenty. In going down the Plenty


nearly all the farm houses were burned down. Cattle, horses
and people had also been burned to death. You would sec
cattle, pigs and horses dead or dying all along the road. On
the Diamond Creek a woman and six or seven children, the
family of a shepherd, were burned to death. When the
shepherd, who was out with his sheep, saw the fire coming,
he tried to get home, but the fire overtook him, and he had
to jump into a water hole to save his own life.”
The McLaurin family had their full share of the hard-
ships which were the lot of the early pioneers who laid the
foundations of today’s prosperity, but by hard work and
perseverance, they won through and became one of the most
important families in Riverina, where their descendants still
hold portion of the land taken up by their ancestors nearly
a century ago.
We will now treat of the pioneers individually.
JAMES McLAURIN, the founder, was born at
Dunoon, Scotland, in 1781, and was engaged in farming
until he came out to Australia. He married, in 1806, Mary
McGibbon, and arrived with his family at Port Jackson
in 1838. His wife died at Cornalla Station, Deniliquin,
New South Wales, 26th July, 1856, at the age of 73, and
James McLaurin died at Cornalla Station, 26th December,
1864, having had issue, five sons (one of whom, John, died
in infancy), and nine daughters (one of whom died in in-
fancy), (i) Mary, m. Henderson, and had issue; (ii)
Ruth, m. A. Paton, and had issue; (iii) Jean, m. -
Clydesdale, and had issue; (iv) Davida, m. Taylor, and
had issue; (v) Catharine, m. McMeekin, and had issue;
(vi) Helen, m. Kearney; no issue; (vii) Janet, m.
Munn, and had issue; (viii) Margaret, m. firstly, -
Mackinnon, and had issue, and secondly, McDonell, and
had issue. We will now treat of James and Mary McLaurin's
pioneer sons:—
iHclaunn of Jfrogmore
ARCHIBALD McLAURIN, of Frogmore,Caulfield,
was born in Scotland, 27th September, 1815. After being
at Segenhoe with his father, in 1840 he overlanded sheep
to Port Phillip for Dr. Reid, and later became a partner
with his father and brothers in the Riverina properties
owned by the family. In the early sixties he sold out from
his brothers and purchased Frogmore, a small estate at
Caulfield, where he lived in retirement until his death.
He married Elizabeth Shearer (deed.), and died at
Frogmore Estate, 18th December, 1891, having had issue,
a son, who died in infancy, and two daughters, (i) Jean
Ariadne (deed.), m. Dr. Barclay Thomson, d.s.p.; (ii)
Mary McGibbon, d. unm.
Jflcllaurm of Barra Barra
JAMES McLAURIN, of Yarra Yarra Station, Hol-
brook, New South Wales, was born at Dunoon, Scotland,
23rd July, 1821, and arrived in New South Wales with the
family party in January, 1838. He accompanied his father
to Segenhoe Station, and here received his early pastoral
experience, but in the early forties he worked on the Howe
family’s stations and later joined Ephraim Howe on the
latter’s many overland journeys with stock from New South
Wales to Adelaide. These Jong journeys with stock in the
early days required men of indomitable courage; they had
only bush tracks to follow, had to ford swollen rivers, and
were always molested with hostile blacks. In his very in-
teresting memoirs, James McLaurin states that often after
a day’s travelling he was so weak from exhaustion that he
could scarcely stand up, but still had to keep riding round
the cattle all night. Describing one of the overland journeys
to Adelaide, he states: "Howe and I returned to Gundagai,
Tarcutta, Germanton,” (Holbrook) "and on to Gumberoona,
where we drafted the cattle and made a start with them
down the Murray for Adelaide. There were twelve men in
the party, twelve horses, and eight hundred cattle. The
party went to Thargoona, then to John Dights, Bungowna,
then to Thornbury, from where no settlement was seen till
Adelaide was reached. The rate of progress was about ten
miles a day. Then across the Edward River, about two
miles below Jarapora; then across the Edward River, and
seeing the water running north, thought it formed a lake,
as is usual in the lower Murray. Then went to Moira and
struck the Murray about ten miles below Moira, passing
where Moama now is, and down below Echuca we saw
what is now called the Campaspe River coming into the
Murray. We were interfered with several times by blacks,
and it was necessary to keep watch on the cattle day and
night. The blacks managed to kill a bullock which had
strayed from the mob, and also spear a horse, which had
to be destroyed. It was necessary in some cases to fire
among the blacks to keep them off.” James McLaurin also
states that "the next party (Chisholm's) in charge of Cap-
tain Hindman and Field, with about 13,000 sheep, was
attacked. All the sheep, drays and bullocks were taken by
the blacks, and one man was speared in seven places. The
party had to walk for six or eight days to Adelaide, with
nothing to eat but what they could dig up along the river.”
James McLaurin, in his memoirs, claims to have named
the Edward River during an overland journey from New
South Wales to Adelaide, as shown by the following ex-
tract; "That night Webster and I were on watch, and as
Webster kept an account of everything that happened, he
asked me what we would call the river I had been the first
to see that day, so I said ’We’ll call it the Edward River,
for Edward Howe’.”

According to Mr. McLaurin, blacks at this time—lB39-
‘lo—were troublesome in what is now the suburbs of Mel-
bourne. He writes "as Peter Snodgrass (who had a property
at what is now Heidelberg) was going into Melbourne one
Saturday evening, there was a large tribe of blacks on the
Collingwood Flats, some of whom attempted to spear him.”
He later states that Mr. Snodgrass reported the matter to
Captain Lonsdale, who had the camp surrounded the next
morning and found some blacks for whom rewards had
been offered for killing white men.
James McLaurin, of Yarra Yana
Mr. McLaurin's memoirs also contain some humorous
passages; his description of the first Edward River Races
held at Warbreccain, the property of Phillips and Graves,
is typical of the early Australian days. The squatters and
their men for miles around came to see the races; there was
a booth kept by one Paddy Hennessy, which was so well
patronised by the men that they declared they would run
all the squatters off the course; the latter were warned in
time and rode off into the forest, where they armed them-
selvs with saplings and returned to the course ready to
join issue with the crowd, who, on seeing them prepared
for battle, quietened down, and, Mr. McLaurin adds, "got
as drunk as owls.” The squatters’ party, who were enter-
tained royally at Warbreccain in the evening, also, according
to Mr. McLaurin’s memoirs, put in a rather hectic night
and morning, with a few fights thrown in.
After cattle dealing on the Melbourne market for a short
time, with his brother, Alexander, and John Webster, James
and Alexander McLaurin went to the Westernport district,
and there formed the Allanvale Station for David Charteris
McArthur, Superintendent of the Bank of Australasia. We
then find James McLaurin back at the Howe family stations,
Broken River, Yeilima, on the Murray, Emu Plains and
Yabba Yabba; this was in the early forties, and he records
that he made two trips to Melbourne during the winter of
1843 with cattle and horses, and that brood mares were sold
Isabella McLaurin (nee Rankin)
at from £3 to £5, and fat cattle at £1 to £2 per head. About
this time Howe gave up Emu plains, and James McLaurin,
with his brothers, formed Moroco Station, and became
associated with the other members of the family in the
properties referred to earlier in this record. In the early
days on Cornalla Station, he records that he and his brother,
Archibald, "had to milk twenty cows before breakfast, split
posts all day and thresh wheat by candle light . . . and it
was not uncommon to see the milk cows coming home with
spears sticking into them.” The gold diggings attracted his
attention in 1852, but as he "only got twenty ounces in
three weeks” he gave up in disgust and returned to his
squatting pursuits, finally settling on Yarra Yarra Station,
where he spent the remainder of his life.
He entered politics in 1876 as representative for the
Hume Electorate in the New South Wales Legislative As-
sembly, but resigned his seat after eighteen months.

A true Scot, he carried with him the characteristics of the
Scottish race to the shores of Australia. He was a staunch
Presbyterian, for many years a senior elder of the Church at
Germanton (now Holbrook), and a liberal supporter of all
the Presbyterian churches in the Albury district. Mr.
McLaurin was typical of those early Scottish pioneers who,
in spite of peril and hardship, played such a prominent
part in laying the foundations of Australia’s prosperity.
He married firstly, Ann Sparrow, who died without issue,
21st September, 1853. He married secondly, 31st July,
1857, Isabella Rankin, who died at Yarra Yarra Station,
Holbrook, Bth July, 1887.
James McLaurin died at Yarra Yarra Station, 10th
November, 1891, having had issue by his second wife, five
sons and four daughters, of whom we now treat.

when his father’s estate was divided, he and three of his
brothers entered into partnership as McLaurin Brothers,
pastoralists, James Alexander holding the position of Gen-
eral Manager. His portion of Yarra Yarra Station he named
"Tiverton.” James Alexander McLaurin’s grandson, Alan
Robert Gray, will eventually inherit Tiverton, and will
represent the fourth generation of the family to hold the

pastoral training on his father’s station, Yarra Yarra. When
the family property was divided he named his portion
Billabong, and became one of the best known pastoralists
in Riverina. He was one of the leading exhibitors at the
district shows, and was a member of the committee of the
Holbrook Agricultural Society for over forty years. A keen
patron of the turf, he established the well-known Billabong
Racing Stud, which produced many fine racers, amongst
which may be mentioned Tulkeroo, who has gone down in


racing history as one of the greatest, and yet the most
unlucky, horses that ever graced the Australian turf, having
run second in both the Melbourne and Caulfield Cups.
Other well-known products of the Billabong Stud were
Me Alpine and Van Homreigh (two of the best-known
cross country horses Australia has bred). Mr. McLaurin
was on the executive of many racing clubs, and also held
office as president. He was a staunch member of the Pres-
byterian Church at Holbrook, and a prominent member of
the Masonic Fraternity.

iHcHaurm of Jfloroco
ALEXANDER McLAURIN. of Moroco Station,
Deniliquin, New South Wales, was born at Dunoon, Scot-
land, 27th October, 1823, and accompanied the family to
Australia in 1838. At the age of sixteen he was overlanding
stock from New South Wales to Adelaide with his brother,
James, for Ephraim Howe, and in 1840, at the age of
seventeen, was sent in charge of a mob of horses from
Widgegullon for the Sydney market. Until the family were


re-united on their Riverina properties, Alexander and
James seem to have stuck together, as we find from James’s
memoirs that Alexander, or, as he refers to him, Sandy,
was with him overlanding stock, cattle dealing for the
Melbourne market, and in forming Allanvale Station in the
Westernport district. When the McLaurin brothers dis-
solved partnership, Alexander took over Moroco Station,
and held it until his death.
He married, 31st July, 1847, Elizabeth Sparrow (died
Bth May, 1886, ast. 64), and died at Moroco Station, 2nd
January, 1872, having had issue, five sons and four daugh-

The fourth son,
ALEXANDER JOHN McLAURIN, was born at Moroco
Station, Deniliquin, New South Wales, 11th April, 1860,
and educated at Brighton College and Wesley College,
Melbourne. He gained his early pastoral experience on
Moroco Station, and after the death of his father, he and
his brother, Robert, in 1880, purchased Moroco from the
executors, and entered into partnership. In 1892 the part-
nership was dissolved, and the station divided, the portion
taken by Alexander retaining the name Moroco; here he
remained until 1916, when he sold out and took up an
appointment with Goldsbrough Mort and Company, of
Melbourne. He was well known in pastoral circles, and

Robertson and Patterson of Warrock
George robertson was born in Stirling-
shire, Scotland, in 1808, and when he reached the
age of thirty-one years, decided to settle in Aus-
tralia. He took passage in the sailing ship "Lord Goderich"
and landed at Port Phillip in the early part of 1840. He
paid a short visit to Van Diemen’s Land, and brought over
some sheep to Portland for his cousin, John G. Robertson,
of Wando Vale, with whom he worked for a few years,
stead, which is situated on about two acres of land. A
station owner once enquired of George Robertson when he
expected to cease to build, and the reply, given in broad
Scots, was "Gane ye come tae see me the day efter I dee.”
He was known affectionately throughout the Western
District as "Geordie.” An unassuming Scot, he did not
seek the limelight, but there were many recipients of his
private benefactions. He presented the town of Casterton
George Robertson, of Warrock
and who, in 1843, purchased Warrock for him. Details of
the purchase will be found in a short account of John G.
Robertson’s career which appears at the end of this record.
When Warrock was purchased by the Robertsons, the
acreage was 11,696, and, unlike most pastoral properties, it
has not decreased in acreage throughout the ensuing years.
George Robertson greatly improved the property, and his
good work has been continued by his successors.
The property, which at the outset had (in 1844) a
carrying capacity of 2,500 sheep and 50 cattle, now runs
over 12,000 sheep and 500 cattle. When he took over
Warrock, George Robertson commenced building the home-
stead, and the excellence of the buildings erected under his
supervision is proved by the fact that they stand still solid
today. About forty different buildings comprise the home-
with the Mechanics Institute and the land on which it was
built, and also equipped the original Casterton Band with a
complete set of instruments.
He married his cousin, Mary Robertson, the sister of
John G. Robertson, of Wando Vale, already referred to in
this record. She died 17th August, 1886, at the age of 82.
George Robertson died at Warrock Station, 15th January,
1890, without issue, bequeathing the property to his
nephew:—
GEORGE ROBERTSON PATTERSON, who was born
at "Leckie House,” Glasgow, Scotland, in 1841, and arrived
at Port Phillip with his parents in 1848. In his youth
he gained pastoral experience on his uncle's, George
Robertson's, station, Warrock, and eventually became
manager. In 1875 he purchased Caupaul, a property near
Casterton, and during the time he had this property, he
took over the management of Roseneath Station, on the


death of his father-in-law, Rev. Charles Simson, and also
resumed the management of Warrock Station. He man-
aged Warrock until the year of his uncle’s death, when he
inherited the property, and relinquished the management of
Roseneath Station, but still held Caupaul.
George Robertson Patterson was a Councillor of the
Shire of Glenelg from 1882 to 1889, and a member of the
local Agricultural Society. He was a generous supporter of
the Church of England and other religious bodies and also
many charitable institutions in the Casterton district. In

JOHN G. ROBERTSON, of Wando Vale Station,
who purchased Warrock property for his cousin, George
Robertson, was one of the outstanding pioneers of Vic-
toria. He arrived in Van Diemen’s Land in the year 1831,
and when he landed at Hobart Town, all he possessed was
one half-crown and a sixpence. After joining some of his
fellow passengers in a meal, only the sixpence was left, and
immediately he proceeded to find employment, which was
not very hard to obtain, especially for men of his ex-
perience. He remained in Van Diemen’s Land for about
nine years, during which time he was occupied in pastoral
pursuits and was overseer of two different properties. By
the end of 1840 he had about £3,000. At this time all eyes
were turned to the new Colony of Port Phillip, so in
January, 1840, John G. Robertson purchased 1,000 ewes
for £l,BOO, a team of working bullocks, two cows, and a
horse, and after engaging four men, he crossed over to
Port Phillip, landing in Portland early in the same year.
He took up Wando Vale Station, then a property of
11,333 acres, near Casterton, which he held until his death.
Governor Latrobe, who intended to compile a record of
the early settlement of Port Phillip, in 1853 circularised the
owners of runs, requesting them to furnish him with de-
tails of their individual experiences on the land. The
Governor left Victoria before he was able to collate the
information received from the squatters, but the letters
were handed over to the Melbourne Public Library. Many
years later, in 1898, they were published in book form,
under the name "Letters of Early Pioneers” (a work that
all descendants of pioneer families should have on their
bookshelves, as, being written personally by the men who
settled the country, the information is intensely interesting,
and better still, authentic).
John G. Robertson wrote one of the most interesting
of the letters published; the following extract describes his
purchase of Warrock and gives an interesting account of the
slump in stock and land values in the early forties: "With
the wool of that year (1843) I bought for my cousin
(George Robertson) Warrock Station on the Glenelg, with
2,500 sheep and team of bullocks and all improvements,
for £3OO. This station had been formed by Messrs. Wrent-
more and Butcher for a Mr. Wilmore in V.D. Land, and
cost that gentleman £5,700, forming and keeping it for
three years. The price paid for such a fine station as
Warrock seems ridiculous in the light of present land
values, but at this time the value of both sheep and cattle
had fallen to such an extent that they were only worth the
boiling down value. In this connection, in Mr. Robertson’s
letter, tHe following occurs; Nangeela (a property of
16,000 acres on the Glenelg) was offered to me a few days
after (the purchase of Warrock) with the same number of
sheep, for £400.” Mr. J. G. Robertson also stated in his
letter that his own run, Wando Vale, depreciated in value
from £3,000 to £3OO.

Simson of Roseneath and Dergholm
Reverend Charles Simson Branch
THE REVEREND CHARLES SIMSON was
born Bth June, 1811, being the youngest son of
John and Elizabeth Simson, of Blainslie Farm,
Lauderdale, Berwick, Scotland. He had a brilliant career
at Edinburgh University as a divinity student, and after-
wards entered the ministry of the Church of Scotland, but
although his prospects of advancement in the Church in
Capt. Morrison, Ist mate Mr. Nicol, 2nd mate Mr.
McQueen, Surgeon Duncan. Cabin passengers, five ladies

Miss Robertson; eight men —Messrs. Crabb, Westgarth,

Burntisland, was with us as an apprentice. Steerage pas-
Rev. Charles Simson
Mary Ann Simson (nee Wilson)
Scotland were bright, he volunteered to proceed to Van
Diemen s Land and minister to the Scottish community
there.
Shortly after arrival at Port Phillip in 1840, the Rev.
Mr. Simson crossed over to Van Diemen s Land to take
charge of the Presbyterian Church at O Brien s Bridge (now
known as Glenorchy), near Hobart, where he ministered
for over thirty years. The centenary of this church was
celebrated in 1940.
The following is an extract from the Reverend gentle-
mans diary, in which he refers to the voyage to Aus-
tralia: "We sailed from Leith by the 'Midlothian' on the
23rd July, 1840, with a crew of [number not filled in],
sengers all men. We had also on board two horses, two
bulls, one cow giving milk, all the property of Mr. Lyon
Campbell, of Port Phillip."
Coming from a family which had been engaged in pas-
toral pursuits in Scotland for generations, it was natural
that Mr. Simson should be interested in the Port Phillip
settlement, which was sponsored from Van Diemen's Land.
His cousin, James Simson (details of whose family appear
later in this record), had also settled in Van Diemen’s
Land, but was attracted by the prospects ot the Port Phillip
settlement, and decided to take up land there. A partner-
ship was arranged between the Rev. Charles Simson, his
cousin, James Simson, and a Mr. Ralston. James Simson

proceeded to Port Phillip and took up Roseneath run,
48,000 acres, on the Glenelg River, seventeen miles out of
Casterton, on behalf of the partnership, and also a property
known as Dergholm. Later on, however, James Simson
received a Government appointment as Official Assignee
of Insolvent Estates, at Geelong, and sold out his interest
to his cousin. The partnership, which later acquired Penola
Station in South Australia, then consisted of the Rev.
Simson and Robert Ralston, the latter managing the proper-
ties until the Rev. Simson arrived in Port Phillip.
In 1871 the Rev. Simson retired from the ministry of
Glenorchy Church, and, with his family, came over to
Port Phillip to settle at Roseneath. Mr. Simson records in
his diary that they came over to Melbourne and then pro-
ceeded to Portland by the steamer "Julia Percy.” On
arrival at Portland a land sale was in progress, and as no
accommodation could be obtained, the party had to proceed
to Heywood and there spend the night before proceeding
to Roseneath.
Shortly after Mr. Simson arrived at Roseneath, the part-
nership was dissolved, Mr. Simson taking over Roseneath
and Dergholm, and Mr. Ralston, Penola.
The Rev. Charles Simson married, 28th August, 1851,
Mary Ann, daughter of William Borrodaile Wilson, of
Clarendon, Macquarie Plains, Van Diemen's Land, who
Charles Simson
arrived there in 1818, and his wife, Grace Terry, whose
sister, Margaret Terry, married Captain George Frederick
Read (see Read family records in this volume), and grand-
daughter of John Terry, a well-known early settler in Van
Diemen’s Land. John Terry, of "Askrigg,” Rathmine,
Yorkshire, was a mill owner at Bolton, Yorkshire, before
he emigrated to Australia in 1819- He was accompanied
by his wife and family, and also his future son-in-law,
William Borrodaile Wilson. His money he packed in nail
kegs and stowed in the after part of the ship, and he
records in his diary that the sailors found out where the
valuable cargo was placed, so to keep them honest, he
drew a chalk line across the deck forward of where the
bullion was, and threatened to shoot the first man who
ventured aft of the line; needless to say, he landed his
wealth safely. Mr. Terry’s daughter, Mrs. Wilson, also had
her own way of getting over difficulties, and when her
assigned servants became troublesome, instead of sending
for the flagellator, she bled them into a milder frame of
mind.
Mary Ann Simson (nee Wilson) died at Glenorchy
Tasmania, 14th October, 1866, and the Rev. Charles
Simson, pioneer clergyman and pastoralist, died at Rose-
neath Station, 11th March, 1872, having had issue, two
sons and five daughters, of whom we now treat.
The elder son,
JOHN SIMSON, was born at Glenorchy, Tasmania, 23rd
October, 1856, and educated at Scotch College, Melbourne.
He followed pastoral pursuits at Roseneath Station for
some years. He married Mary Morley (deed.), and died
at Wangaratta, Victoria, 2nd July, 1919, without issue.
Catherine Simson (nee Owens)
The younger son,
CHARLES SIMSON, was born at Glenorchy, Tasmania,
6th December, 1862, and received his education at Scotch
College, and Ormond College, Melbourne University. His
father having died, leaving both his sons minors, Rosc-
neath Station was administered by the trustees, James


Jj
' y
I * * w
Simson (his cousin), Joseph Clarke and Robert Cartwright
Read, for some years. After leaving the University, Charles
Simson went to Roseneath, where he gained his early pas-
toral experience under the guidance of the trustees.
In 1906 the trustees wound up the estate for division,
and Roseneath was cut up and sold. Charles Simson pur-
chased the homestead block, together with 6,400 acres, to
which he added within a year another 1,500 acres, besides
renting 800 acres of Poolaijelo Station. He specialised in
Merino sheep and Shorthorn cattle. He also had an in-
terest with his cousin, Harry Bernard Simson, in Limestone
Ridge Station, Glenroy, South Australia.
A lover of Australian fauna, Mr. Simson had Roseneath
declared a bird sanctuary, and it still remains so. Unassum-
ing and shy of the limelight, he was nevertheless looked
upon as a pastoralist of outstanding ability, and his know-
ledge, gained by experience, was always available to the
younger generation. He was one of the band of Western
District squatters who popularised the Glenelg as a fisher-
man’s and campers’ paradise. Known affectionately amongst
his friends as "The Skipper,” he was held in high respect
by all with whom he came in contact, and his advice on
matters pastoral, and otherwise, was much sought after and
keenly appreciated.
He married, 27th April, 1887, at Wando Dale Station,
near Coleraine, Victoria, Catherine, daughter of Owen
Owens, manager of Pleasant Hills Station, Digby, Vic-
toria. She died at Melbourne, sth May, 1940.

tralia, 9th March, 1937, having had issue:—

James Simson J>raudj
JAMES SIMSON was born in Edinburgh about
1821, and came out to Australia in 1842. He had secured
an appointment in H.M. Customs, and was transferred to
Hobart, Tasmania, where he remained until about 1848,
when, hearing glowing accounts of the Port Phillip settle-
ment, he decided to resign his position in the Customs
and look out for a pastoral property in the young Colony.
In partnership with his cousin, the Rev. Charles Simson,
Presbyterian Minister, of Glenorchy, Tasmania, details of
whose family appear earlier in this record, and a Mr. John
Ralston (later succeeded by Robert Ralston), he took up
the Roseneath run, 48,000 acres, seventeen miles out of
Casterton. The partnership also acquired another run,
Dergholm, not far from Roseneath, and Mr. James Simson
resided on the latter station for some time.
In the late fifties, James Simson sold his interest in the
runs to his cousin, the Rev. Charles Simson, and accepted a
Government appointment as Official Assignee of Insolvent
Estates, at Geelong. He had the right of private practice,
and was trustee for several large estates in the Western
District, including that of his cousin, the Rev. Charles
Simson, of Roseneath, In his administration of estates, he
was identified with such well-known men as Sir William
Clarke and John Lang Currie, of Larra (see Currie family
records in this volume).
At the commencement of the Ballarat gold mining boom
he realized a small fortune, which was lost in subsequent
mining ventures. He retired from active business in 1888,
and took up his residence in Melbourne.
James Simson was prominently identified with the foun-
dation ol Geelong College in 1861, and was a member of
the committee set up to advise on the proposed establish-
ment of a Grammar School at Geelong. Other members of
this committee included John Calvert, James Balfour,


SESfe . . jWw
James Cowie, A. S. Robertson, and William Blair. The
committee’s report urged the establishment of the school
to be known as Geelong College, and Mr. Simson was one
of the sub-committee who arranged with George Morrison,
M.A. (then headmaster of Flinders National School) to
take over the headmastership of the School. On the estab-
lishment of the College at Knowle House, Skene Street,
two months after the first meeting, Mr. Simson was ap-
pointed a member of the first Committee of Management.
He married at Geelong, on 26th April, 1851, Agnes
Hunter, daughter of Hugh Murray, of Hobart Town (see
James Simson
Murray family records in this volume). She died at South
Yarra, Melbourne, 6th January, 1916.
James Simson died at South Yarra, Melbourne, 23rd
July, 1895, having had issue, nine sons and two daughters,
of whom we now treat.
The eldest son,
JAMES MURRAY SIMSON, was born at Hobart Town,
Van Diemen’s Land, 29th April, 1852, and educated at
Geelong College. He joined the staff of the National
Bank of Australasia, Geelong Branch, but later took up
pastoral pursuits and was in partnership with his brother,
Dundas, and J. L. Currie, Junior, on Cassilis Station,
Western Queensland. He was a well-known oarsman,
stroked the Bank’s crew at Geelong for some years, and was
a member of George (now Sir George) Fairbairn’s crew
in the first inter-colonial boat race.
He died, unmarried, at Melbourne, 20th August, 1889.
The second son,
DOUGLAS HUNTER SIMSON, died 7th August, 1855.
The third son,
DUNDAS SIMSON, was born at Geelong, 29th May,
1855, and educated at Geelong College. He joined the staff
of the Union Bank, Geelong branch, but later decided to
take up a pastoral career, and joined his brother, James
Murray, and J. L. Currie (see Currie family records in this
volume), on Cassilis Station, Western Queensland, in 1878,
a property of 500 square miles. A great amount of pioneer-
ing work had to be done on this property, which was un-
fenced when taken up. Cassilis was eventually sold, and
Agnes Hunter Simson (nee Murray)
Dundas Simson then managed Telemon Station, Western
Queensland, for John Lang Currie, senior, of Larra, until
1899- The following year, Dundas Simson returned to Vic-
toria and took up farming and orcharding at Ardmona, in
the Goulburn Valley, where he established a large orchard,
which is still held by the family. He retired in 1915, and
took up his residence in Melbourne.
He married firstly, 18th August, 1888, Mary Ann Arm-
strong, of Townsville, Queensland, who died at Ardmona,
11th June, 1911 ; and secondly, Catherine Sybilla Campbell.

at Ardmona, Victoria.
He died, unmarried, at Ardmona, 18th October, 1900.
The fifth son,
PERCY CLAUDE SIMSON, was born at Geelong, 10th

his pastoral experience on Roseneath Station, and later took
up wool-classing. In 1891 he entered into partnership with
his brother, Harry, and Charles Simson (son of Rev.
Charles Simson) in Limestone Ridge Station, Penola,
South Australia, but eight years later sold out his interest
to the other partners. He then purchased a farm at Narra-
coorte, South Australia, which he held for some years
before taking up fruit growing at Tyabb, Victoria. Now
retired, and resides at Brighton, Melbourne.
He married Matilda Daisy Newman, who died in March,
1938, without issue.
The sixth son,
HARRY BERNARD SIMSON, was born at Geelong,
17th September, 1863, and educated at Geelong College.
He gained his early pastoral experience as jackeroo on
Cassilis Station, Western Queensland, under his brothers,
Murray and Dundas, and J. L. Currie. After five years on
Cassilis, he returned to Victoria, in 1886, at the time of the
Kimberley (W.A.) gold rush, and decided to try his luck
on the fields. Accompanied by a Mr. Raphael, he travelled
by boat to Wyndham, taking pack horses and eight months’
rations, and after an adventurous few months among wild
blacks, their total gold amounted to about eighty ounces.
Mr. Simson decided to return to Queensland, and was
appointed overseer of A. W. and J. Robinson’s station,
Marathon, where he remained for four years, and then took
a position as overseer on Telemon Station, which at that
time was managed by his brother, Dundas.
In 1891 Harry Simson returned to Victoria, and with
his brother, Percy Claude, and his cousin, Charles Simson,
of Roseneath, purchased Limestone Ridge Station, at Glen-
roy, in the south-east of South Australia, a property of
about 13,000 acres, carrying 10,000 sheep. This partner-
ship continued until 1899, when Percy Simson sold his
interest to his brother and Charles Simson, who continued
at Limestone Ridge until it was sold in January, 1922,
when Mr. Harry Simson retired to live in Geelong.
He married, in 1912, Constance Marguerite, daughter of
the Rev. John Clark, Minister of the Presbyterian Church at
Williamstown, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John
Thomson, of Ayrshire, Scotland, and sister of William

was captain of the school football team, 1883, and captain
of the school cricket team in the same year. He was also a
member of the Geelong Football XVIII. He joined the
staff of Dennys Lascelles, Geelong, but shortly afterwards
visited Scotland with his parents. On his return he became
a member of the staff of John Sanderson and Company,

1840. He spent three years at the Aboriginal Protectorate
on the Goulburn, then in charge of his father, and it was
here that he began to take an interest in the aborigines.
He was engaged in pastoral pursuits and overlanding of
cattle from New South Wales to Victoria until 1863. He
was later appointed Usher of the Black Rod in the Victorian
Legislative Council and held this position for thirty years,
but as the duties of that office in those days only occupied
about half the year, he took up the honorary secretaryship
of the Acclimatisation Society in 1870. In the following
year, the name of the Society was changed to the Zoological
and Acclimatisation Society; this was the genesis of the
present Melbourne Zoological Gardens. On taking up this
honorary secretaryship, he resided at the Gardens, Royal
Park, and for over thirty years was in charge of the adminis-
tration of the Zoological Gardens. In 1880, he was ap-
pointed Director of the Zoological Gardens, and was sent
on an extensive tour of Europe, where he visited the more
important zoological collections in the principal cities and
gathered specimens and ideas for the advancement of the
Melbourne Zoological Gardens. During his lifetime he re-
tained his interest in the aborigines, and was for thirty years
an active member of the Board for the Protection of
Aborigines.
He married, in 1853, Caroline, fourth daughter of John
Cotton, of Doogalook Station, Victoria; she was born at
Caroline Le Souef (nee Cotton)
Barnstaple, England, 15th July, 1834, and died at Royal
Park, Melbourne, Bth March, 1913.

authorities on Australian fauna. He travelled ex-
tensively throughout Australia, observing the
habits of birds and animals. He also visited other
countries as representative of the Victorian Royal
Zoological and Acclimatisation Society at various
scientific Congresses, and became prominent in
William Henry Dudley Le Souef
zoological circles throughout the world. He was

Macknight of Dunmore
CHARLES HAMILTON MACKNIGHT, of
Dunmore, was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in
1819, and educated at the Edinburgh High School,
the oldest Public School in Scotland, and at Edinburgh
University. He then entered the Scottish Naval and
Military Academy to study for a military career, but a year
Charles Hamilton Macknight
later, on learning of the potentialities of the new settle-
ment of Port Phillip, decided to come out to Australia and
take up land.
Before leaving Scotland a partnership was arranged
between Charles Macknight and two of his old school-
fellows, James Hamilton Irvine, the son of the Laird of
Castle Drum, Aberdeenshire, and William Campbell, of
Argyllshire, for the purpose of acquiring pastoral properties
in Port Phillip.
The three partners sailed from Gravesend, England, in
the sailing ship ''Argyle,” 597 tons, Gatenby, Master, on
25th October, 1840, and took out with them several young
Scottish farmers to assist them on the runs they hoped to
acquire.
Among the other passengers on the "Argyle” was Mrs.
McCrae, accompanied by her young family, coming out to
join her husband, Andrew Murison McCrae, pioneer pas-
toralist, who held Arthur’s Seat Station, near Dromana,
from 1844 to 1853, and was later appointed Magistrate
and Warden at Kilmore. Mrs. McCrae was a prolific diarist,
and her Journal, containing a most interesting account of
the voyage to Australia and life in early Melbourne, was
Everina Isabella Macknight
(nee Heatley)
published under the title "Georgiana's Journal” a few
years ago, and attracted much attention.
The "Argyle” arrived at Port Phillip on Ist March, 1841,
and the partners proceeded to look for a suitable station.
They took up, in May, 1841, Strathloddon run, licence
number 70, 25,000 acres, which included the present site
of Castlemaine, and Bough Yards run, licence number 115,
22,400 acres, adjoining Guildford. Gold was afterwards
discovered on both runs, and Mr. Macknight recorded that
on revisiting his first Australian homestead in 1851, he
saw diggers demolishing one of the outbuildings, which
had been built of pise taken off the property. (This
building material consists of rammed loam, without clay
or stone, and proved so suitable to the climate that Mr.
Macknight’s son, Campbell, now an architect, has designed
many of the largest station homes in Riverina, built of


this material. The homes constructed with pise possess
the great advantage of being cool in summer and warm in
winter.) After the building material had been put through
a washer, a good yield of gold resulted. This recalled to
Mr. Macknight an incident which had occurred while he
was living there. One of the workmen brought what
he thought was a peculiarly coloured stone under the
notice of the old Scottish overseer (William Laidlaw), but
The stations adjoining Dunmore when taken up, were
Eumeralla, occupied by Messrs. Hunter, Hoskins and David-
son, and later held by the celebrated Benjamin Boyd;
Harton Hills (now Ripponhurst), held by the Boldens;
Cox’s Heifer Station, later known as Kangatong, taken up
and shortly afterwards abandoned, by John Cox, of Mount
Rouse, and afterwards held by James Dawson and Patrick
Mitchell; Tarrone Station, taken up by Dr. Kilgour and
Dunmore Homestead
was told to "get on wi’ yer wark, laddie, and dinna waste
yer time pickin’ up stanes and peebles." It was on this
station property that the famous "Jim Crow" mine was
discovered, one of the richest alluvial fields known in
Australia.
Strathloddon and Bough Yards were held by the part-
ners for only about a year, when they disposed of the runs
to Messrs. Cay and Kaye (see Cay family records in this
volume), and took up a run, licence number 78, 47,228
acres, between Macarthur (then called Eumeralla) and Port
Fairy. The native name of the locality, which meant "native
dogs’ camping ground,’’ did not appeal to them, and the
station was renamed Dunmore, after the Scottish home of
one of the partners, William Campbell.
Dr. W. D. Besnard; Urang Aranga, now Aringa, taken up
by John Ritchie, whom Mr. Macknight had known in
Edinburgh; and Squattlesea Mere, taken up by William
Walker, of Sydney, and managed, and later held, by
T. A. Browne, the well-known Australian author, who
wrote under the pen name of Rolfe Boldrewood, and whose
famous book, "Robbery Under Arms,’’ has enjoyed popu-
larity down to the present day. In his writings Mr, Browne
refers to the help he received through access to the splendid
library Mr. Macknight had brought out from Scotland.
The partners did not sell the stock on Strathloddon and
Bough Yards, and overlanded 600 head of cattle, horses,
etc., to the new run, Dunmore. For a time after Dunmore
was taken up the blacks proved very troublesome, and the


usual stealing and maiming of stock took place, as the
blacks knew all the hideouts in the stony rises around
Mount Eeles, erroneously called Mount Eccles (Major
Mitchell, the explorer, named the mount after a friend,
Major Eeles, an officer in the Indian Army). By humane
treatment of the natives, Mr. Macknight gained their con-
fidence ; the raids on stock ceased, and they became valuable
servants on the station.
In 1863 Dunmore was subdivided into Dunmore and
Dunmore West. The Dunmore portion was retained by
Messrs. Macknight and Irvine, while Dunmore West was
acquired by the Trust and Agency Company, which later
sold out to David Moore and Beilby Hawthorn.
Mr. Macknight specialised in the breeding of stud cattle
and sheep, and was considered one of the foremost flock
masters in Australia. The Dunmore Shorthorns were bred
from stock imported by the Bolden Brothers, who first
brought out pure bred Shorthorns to this Colony, and the
Merino stud was purchased from Messrs. Griffiths and
Greene in 1857. This famous stud was known as the
Camden flock, from Macarthur of Camden, and was brought
from New South Wales by William Campbell (not Mr.
Macknight’s partner), and played a great part in the de-
velopment of some of the most valuable stud flocks of
Port Phillip, including Larra, Chalicum, Skene, Mount
Fyans and Wooriwyrite. The Camden flock, throughout
all its changes, has been kept absolutely free from admix-
ture of other blood, and is now owned by Sir Alan Currie,
of Ercildoune Station (see Currie family records in this
volume).
Mr. Macknight bred many fine racehorses, and Traveller
and The Premier, celebrated sires of their day, were owned by
him. Of the progeny of The Premier, Despatch and Mormon
were amongst the best known; the former was the first
favourite for the first Melbourne Cup, but fell and broke
her leg, while Mormon came second to Archer in the same
race and repeated the performance in the Melbourne Cup
of the following year, but defeated Archer in the Three
Miles Champion Stakes. Briseis, another descendant of
The Premier, was the only horse to win The Derby, The
Cup and The Oaks in the same year.
One of the partners in Dunmore, William Campbell,
did not take kindly to pioneering work, sold out his share
to the other two partners in 1847, and returned to Scotland.
Mr. Macknight kept a daily journal from 1841 until his
death; this is considered to be one of the most reliable
diaries in connection with the pastoral settlement of Port
Phillip, and has been of great value to many writers on the
early history of Port Phillip.
In public affairs, Mr. Macknight gave faithful and
valuable service to the country of his adoption. He was for
many years a member of the Belfast Shire Council and the
Minhamite Shire Council, and president of the latter body,
his services were recognised by a presentation from the
electors of an engraved gold watch, which was unfortunately
lost when he was a passenger on board the steamer Cham-
pion,” which was sunk in a collision with the steamer
"Ladybird” off Cape Otway in 1857; thirty-two lives were
lost, and Mr. Macknight, who was the last taken off the
doomed ship, sustained a broken arm and other injuries.
A man of keen intellect, and a classical scholar, he took
an absorbing interest in the furtherance of educational
facilities in the new Colony, and lectured on literary and
scientific subjects before various Educational Societies
throughout the Western District of Victoria. He was a
contributor to leading Victorian newspapers on pastoral
matters, and wrote a book on inbreeding, which is recog-
nised as an authority on this subject.
Mr. T. A. Browne, better known as "Rolf Boldrewood,
was a life-long friend of Mr. Macknight, and shortly after
the latter's death, the following letter from the author's
pen appeared in "The Australasian :
"Sir,
"I was in another Colony far away from green Port Fairy,
when this fatal, unmistakable announcement in your jour-
nal met my gaze. For some moments I was unable to read
the account of the accident, and of the calm characteristic
ending of my oldest, my most valued friend. Perhaps, Sir,
I may be permitted here to refer to a portion of the services
rendered to the Colony of Victoria, and to society at large,
during Mr. Macknight's honourable, useful and laborious
career.
"In the winter of 1844, I visited Dunmore’ for the first
time. It was then but newly occupied. On that line estate,
now so highly improved, so profitably stocked, grazed but
a few hundred cattle, and a small but choice stud of horses.
Two or three slab huts, a pise-work dairy, a stockyard, a
small paddock, and a horse-box, were all the improvements
then visible. But the enterprising, resolute, cultured young
Scottish settlers—for there were three partners —had at
that early period arranged their plans of life, and settled
those principles of stock breeding, from which Mr. Mac-
knight never afterwards departed. The improvement of the
herd, and the foundation of a stud of valuable horses were
among their first considerations. 'The Dean,’ a shorthorn
bull of high pedigree and unmistakable quality, grazed in
the vicinity of the milking-yard, while in the horse-box
resided 'Traveller’ (daily dressed and tended by Mr.
Macknight himself) an unconquered son of 'Bay Camerton,'


who combined the blood of the English thoroughbred with
the compact form and iron sinews of the Arab.
' The ordinary life of my friend and of his partners
would have gladdened the heart of him who declared that
colonisation was heroic work. From before dawn till sun-
set, they toiled at the hardest parts of the various never-
ending station work. They did not direct alone, but worked
in the van of the industrial battle, with all the pluck and
bottom of true gentlemen. They milked the cows which
composed the large dairy herd—rarely less than fifty—for
year after year, in the cold, wet, muddy western winters, as
in the pleasant, cool, green summer time. They split tim-
ber ; they ploughed, and reaped, and mowed, and sowed;
they broke their own colts; they did the chief part of the
necessary stock-riding, and in the construction of the Dun-
more Dam (a huge embankment, twice washed away before
its present permanence was secured) Mr. Macknight was
said to have been more than a match for the best of the
hired navvies in the daily use of spade, pick and barrow.
Such was their life by day, scarce distinguishable from their
labourers.
"At night, the needful ablutions over and dinner an-
nounced, the scene changed. Solid reading, intellectual
discussions, and cheerful converse made a pleasant ending
to the well-spent day. They were not without many friends
of their own rank and similar taste, among the adjacent
squatters. There were many excuses for meetings at one
another’s houses in those pre-auriferous cattle-mustering
days. And after a long day in the saddle, or a heavy
branding match, followed by one of good old' Mrs. Teviot’s’
wonderful dinners, we were fully entitled to say, as Dr.
Johnson did, 'Sir, we had some good talk.’
"With regard to the management of the station in other
respects, Mr. Macknight exacted the most punctilious
correctness. No quarter was given to the peccadilloes of
over-careless squatter life. Offence was sometimes taken at
his fearless exposure of minor delinquencies which were
wont to occur on the waste lands of the Crown.’ But in
this, as in all other respects, the practice at ’Dunmore’
’squared’ with the preaching, and the whole of that some-
what heterogeneous society was leavened for good by his
lofty and sustained enthusiasm.
"Years rolled on. The golden days dawned, trebling
prices, causing first panic, then prosperity before un-
dreamed of. The droves of 'double-distilled Deans' at ten
pounds and twelve pounds per head that left Paradise
Camp’ for Melbourne, and the hackneys, hunters, and race-
horses which the Dunmore stud now produced, made our
friend comparatively rich. He had attained to some of the
objects of his early dreams. The 'A.T brand was competed
for by drovers and agents, and though 'Traveller’ slept
beneath the turf, The Premier’ reigned in his stead, while
'Mormon’ and 'Lord of Clyde’ (with a host of other
celebrities) were known as horses of which any land might
be proud.
"Had our lamented friend then sold out, as did many
men, he might have retired with an ample provision for the
rest of his life, but for such a capitulation with effort and
adventure, he, in the prime of life, vigorous in thought and
action, was not the man. He loved the life; he was strongly
interested in his adopted land; he took pleasure in the
development of the pastoral capabilities of his property.
He was very fond of muscular and manly exertion. So he
bought out his partner, William Campbell (long since
dead) and with his remaining partner, commenced to make
costly improvements, and to acquire the fee simple of the
land they had previously leased from the Crown. It will
be well known to many of my readers that, though ulti-
mately profitable, in many instances, this was a process
involving a large outlay, and much anxiety of mind before
the promised results were obtained. Years of bad seasons,
of low prices, of mortgages, of forced purchases of land,
succeeded to the years of unalloyed prosperity that followed
the discovery of gold.
"Through these troublous times Mr. Macknight fought
his way with the unflinching moral and physical courage
which were his leading characteristics. He married, and
an exemplary husband and fond father added other titles to
the respect which had always been freely accorded to him.
He led, for many years, a home-keeping, domestic life, still
engaged as enthusiastically as ever in performing his
allotted tasks, and in aiding the moral and religious wel-
fare of those around him. He had changed his stock, in
accordance with later ideas, to sheep, and the Dunmore’
wash-pen, the price of the wool, the completeness of
arrangements, were all successes and celebrities, as in the
good old cattle days, had been the cheeses, the dairy, the
colts, and the fat stock.
"In the country town (Port Fairy) near which he lived,
he was the President of the Young Men’s Improvement
Society, and the earnest advocate of total abstinence. A
temperate man always, he was in later years struck with
the terrible life-wrecks, the crimes, and griefs which the
misuse of strong drink daily added to the sad calendar of
human woe. To be convinced of the fact, and to be assured
of his duty as a Christian, was with Charles Macknight to
act, and to act earnestly. He became at once a water
drinker, and an eloquent advocate and supporter of the
movement to the day of his death.
As a reasoner he was logical, clear, combative and can-
did. With him it was impossible to be in possession of


opinions or facts valuable to mankind, without a sincere
desire for their dissemination. As a writer he was forcible,
yet elegant and polished, and many of his political subjects
have been read with interest, not only in Victoria, but in
far-off colonies where his death was regretted by many
who had never seen his face.
"Being such as he was 'A gentleman of high degree,' a
Christian man, honourably, sincerely, usefully doing his
duty in the state to which it had pleased God to call him, I,
who write these hasty reminiscences of nearly thirty years of
unbroken friendship, mourn from my inmost heart, as do
his many friends over his solemnly sudden removal.
"He was permitted, let us be thankful, a period of mental
recovery, during which he expressed his natural anguish at
the inevitable severance from his family. Then he assured
them of his perfect resignation to the will of that God whom
they had daily together worshipped, and went with the calm
courage which had never failed him in life, to meet the
dread change. Humble, yet composed, deeply repentant, yet
steadfast in the faith by which his life was regulated, he
died as he had lived, 'a man at all points,’ who had long
tempered the stern virtues of the hero with the milder graces
of the Christian.”

lineage
The Macknight family is a sept of Clan Macnaughtan,
which gave most of the kings to the ancient Piets, against
whom the Romans built the walls across Scotland. The
Clan’s recorded history goes back to the tenth century. In
the twelfth century they were proprietors of Strathtay and
were described as Toiseachs or Thanes of Lochtay.
Sir Alexander Macnaughtane followed James IV to
Elodden in 1513, and was killed on the field.
In 1689 John Macnaughtan fought with Dundee at
Killicrankie. In 1691, after the defeat of the Clans at the
Battle of Dunkeld, his lands and the Castle of Dunderave
were forfeited.
THE REV. WILLIAM MACKNIGHT (c. 1680), a
direct descendant of the Chief of Clan Macnauchtan, was
Parish Minister of Irvine, Scotland. He married Elizabeth
Gemmil, of Dalreith Estate, near Kilmarnock (later in-
herited by her son, Dr. James Macknight), and had issue,
four sons and two daughters. One of the sons,
DR. THOMAS MACKNIGHT, of Ratho Estate, dis-
tinguished himself in the American War of Independence.
Another of the sons,
DR. JAMES MACKNIGHT, the eminent Scottish
Divine, was born 17th September, 1721. He studied for
the ministry at Glasgow University, where he had a dis-
tinguished career, and the notes he took from lectures on
logic and moral philosophy before he reached his sixteenth
year afforded remarkable indications of that soundness of

judgment which afterwards characterised his theological
writings. After leaving Glasgow University, he continued
his studies at Leyden University in Holland. On returning
to Scotland, he was appointed Minister at the Gorbals,
Glasgow, and later took over the Parish of Kilwinning.
In 1753 he was ordained Minister of the Parish of May-
bole, and sixteen years later was translated to the parochial
charge of Jedburgh. In 1872 he was elected one of the
Ministers of Edinburgh, being firstly in charge of Lady
Tester Church, where he remained for six years, when he
was appointed to the Old Church, Edinburgh, where he
ministered until his death.
Dr. Macknight was a celebrated Greek scholar, and was
the author of many standard works on theology; among
his best-known works were "The Harmony of the Gos-
pels,” published in 1756, and what is considered his
greatest work, "The New Translation of the Apostolical
Epistles with a Commentary and Notes,” in four volumes,
published in 1795. Dr. Macknight was engaged in the
latter work for nearly thirty years, and during that period
averaged about eleven hours each day in study.
The Degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him
by Edinburgh University, and he was one of the first to
obtain this distinction in Scotland.
One of the foremost Scottish Churchmen, Dr. Macknight
occupied the highest position which can be held in the
Church of Scotland, being Moderator of the General
Assembly in 1769.
He married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Samuel McCor-
mick, General Examiner of the Excise in Scotland, and died
in 1800, having had, with other issue, two sons. One son,
DR. THOMAS MACKNIGHT, was one of the Ministers
of St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, and, like his father,
received the Degree of Doctor of Divinity from Edinburgh
University. Dr. Thomas Macknight was offered the Chief-
tainship of the Clan Macnauchtan, but his ecclesiastical
duties prevented him from accepting the honour. He
married his cousin, Christian Crawfurd Macknight, and
died in 1800, having had, with other issue;—
i. James Macknight, Writer to the Signet.
ii. Thomas Macknight, Medical Practitioner at Ayr,
Scotland.
iii. William Macknight, Captain in the 21st husiliers,
who accompanied his regiment to Sydney, N.S.W.,
in 1838, and d. in India in 1841.
iv. Alexander Macknight, Barrister, of Edinburgh.
v. Charles Hamilton Macknight, Victorian pioneer
pastoralist, of whom we treat in the Australian
section of this record.
Another son of Dr. James Macknight,
JAMES MACKNIGHT, married Miss Crawfurd, heiress
to Cartsburn Estate, the family seat, near Glasgow. By law
of entail the heirs to this estate had to retain the name of
Crawfurd, and the family is now known as Macknight-
Crawfurd, of Lauriston Castle.
A daughter of Dr. James Macknight married a member
of the Hunter family of Hunterston, an historic estate in
Ayrshire. It was on this land that the battle of Largs
was fought, in which Alexander 111 of Scotland defeated
the Norwegians under King Haco, and here also was found
the famous Hunterston brooch, a family heirloom, now in
the British Museum. A descendant of the Hunter family,
Lieut.-General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston, M.P., K.C.8.,
D.5.0., had a distinguished record in the Boer War and the
Great War of 1914-18, and for many years represented
West Kilbride, Scotland, in the House of Commons. He
died in 1940.

Cotton of Doogallook
T OHN COTTON was born at Ivybridge, Devonshire,
I England, in 1802, educated at Crediton Grammar
J School and later went to Oxford University. In 1843
he decided to settle in Australia and, accompanied by his
wife, four sons, daughters, and servants, he sailed from
England by the ship "Parkfield" (Captain Whiteside) on
19th January, 1843, arriving in Hobson's Bay on 14th May,
1843. Amongst other equipment brought from the old
1846, in a letter to his brother in England, John Cotton
stated that he held "sixty square miles of country and
would have 10,000 sheep to shear.’’
John Cotton’s pioneering work only occupied six years,
but nevertheless few colonists could show so much done
in such a short period, or hold a more honoured place in
the pioneering annals of Port Phillip. He was a highly
cultured man and no mean artist, and his drawings of birds
John Cotton
country was a house in sections, which he erected in Mel-
bourne, as it was impossible to transport it to Doogallook,
the station he acquired shortly after his arrival.
He spent the first few months at Balham Hill with his
brother, Edward (who had come out to Port Phillip in the
previous year), and in September, 1843, took over Doogal-
look Station, near his brother’s property, from J. H. Camp-
bell. Doogallook, at the time it was acquired by John
Cotton was 26,800 acres in extent, and was running 1,800
sheep and 400 cattle. In 1844 he acquired from J. M.
Matson, Maintoongoon run, a station of 28,000 acres on
the Delatite River, which he stocked with ewes at a cost
of 6/6 per head. The splendid pioneering work carried
out on these properties may be gauged by the fact that in
attracted much notice both in the Colony and in England.
He intended publishing a book on the birds of Port Phillip,
to include coloured plates of the hundreds of drawings he
had made, but unfortunately his early death intervened.
A great letter writer, his letters to his relatives in England
are a joy to read; they have been preserved and will no
doubt be published some day, for nothing which could
convey the life of the pioneer of those early days has been
better written. His letters dealing with Australian flora and
fauna and the aborigines (whose heads he compares to those
in Raphael's portraits) are masterpieces. In one of his
letters written shortly after his arrival, he states that the
condition of the early settlers was deplorable, owing to the
stagnation of trade and the depreciation in the price of


every species of produce, stock, merchandise, etc., and refers
in scathing terms to "the shameful system of fraud and
speculation which has ruined the credit of the Colony and
hundreds of individuals.’’ He did not appear to entertain
a very high opinion of Governor Latrobe, as he described
him in one of his letters as a "person without the energy
to make himself useful or to benefit the Colony.’’
H is description of a native corroboree must have been
entertaining to his English relatives: "The lubras, women
and children are seated in a dense circle and beat second
time with their right hands on their folded opossum skins,
which sounds something like a muffled drum, for they all
strike together with great precision. A singer, one of the
men, stands by the musicians beating time with two sticks,
which if well selected, give out a sound something approach-
ing to that of the triangle. A large fire is lighted before
the performers, who presently issue from behind a tree or
other shelter one or two at a time, assume a position like a
spread eagle, and shake their knees with rapid action, beat-
ing time with two sticks. Their bodies are painted with
pipe clay and their ankles and feet enveloped in bands of
leafy twigs. A girdle is round the waist. They shuffle from
place to place, exhibit their spread eagle performance, and
after a time all collect together behind the singer, increasing
the time of the beat until they finish with one loud simul-
taneous beat and retire precipitately. Their movements are
varied occasionally; sometimes they finish the act, as it
were, with a loud scream and retire with quick motion;
others the beats are varied and they retire with slow move-
ment.”
John Cotton had unlimited faith in the future of Port
Phillip, and strongly advocated immigration from the old
country. In one of his letters to his brother, William, in
England, he writes: "If you have any wealthy philan-
thropists among your acquaintance, who would feel inclined
to promote a plan which would tend greatly to the advan-
tage of many a poor person or family in Great Britain and
much to the benefit of these Colonies. . . .You are over-
burdened with population, and we are in want of labour.
I think that an association might be formed for the en-
couragement of immigration to Port Phillip which would
bring happiness and comfort to hundreds of poor people, as
well as to those individuals who would then dispose of
some portion of their wealth.”
Lie was made a Fellow of the Zoological Society of
England in recognition of the literary contributions dealing
with the fauna of Victoria. His grandchildren inherited his
love of the flora and fauna of Australia. Of his daughter
Caroline’s children, William Henry Dudley Le Souef became
Director of the Melbourne Zoo and made valuable literary
contributions on the flora and fauna of Australia; Ernest
Albert Le Souef established the Zoological Gardens at South
Perth, Western Australia; and Albert Sherbourne Le Souef
is the Director of Taronga Zoological Park, Sydney, New
South Wales, which is admitted to be one of the finest
Zoological Parks in the world.

1852), and died at Doogallook Station, 15th December,
1849, having had issue, four sons and six daughters, of

lineage
COTTON OF CONINGTON
The Cottons are a family of well ascertained antiquity,
originally settled in Cheshire. In the fourteenth century
William, son of Edmund Cotton or de Cotun, acquired by
marriage the extensive Ridware estates in Staffordshire,
which descended to the eldest branch. In the fifteenth
century a younger son of this branch, William, was slain
at the second battle of St. Albans in 1461, and lies buried
in St. Margaret’s Church, Westminster. He married a
wealthy heiress, Mary, daughter of Robert de Wesenham
(granddaughter and ultimate heiress of Sir John de Bruce,
who claimed descent from the Scottish Kings and owned
the manors of Conington, Hunts, and Exton, Rutlandshire).
The eldest son,
THOMAS COTTON, of Conington-Knightley. Their
great-grandson,
THOMAS COTTON, of Conington, M.P., married
firstly, Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Shirley, of Staunton-
Harold, Leics. Their eldest son,
ROBERT BRUCE COTTON (Sir) (1571-1631), M.P.,
Antiquary, created baronet 29th July, 1611, married Eliza-
beth, daughter and co-heiress of William Brocas, of
Thedingworth, Leics. His only surviving child,
SIR THOMAS COTTON, 2nd Bt. (1594-1662), married
firstly, Margaret, daughter of William, Lord Howard, of
Naworth Castle, Cumberland, and had issue, a son,
SIR JOHN COTTON, 3rd Bt. (1672-1701), made
known his intention of giving the Cottonian Library to the
Nation, but died before any final arrangements for the
public use of the Library were made. However, in 1700,
in accordance with his wishes, an Act of Parliament (12
and 13 William 111, cap. 7) was passed, declaring that
"Sir John Cotton, in pursuance of the desire and intention
of his father and grandfather, is content and willing that
his mansion house and library should continue in his family
and name, and that it be kept and preserved by the name
of the Cottonian Library for public use and advantage.”
The Cottonian Library, together with the collections of Sir
Hans Sloane, formed the nucleus of the present great
British Museum Library. Sir John Cotton married firstly
Dorothy, daughter and heiress of Edmund Anderson, of
Stratton and Eyworth, Bedfordshire, and had issue by her
an only son,
JOHN COTTON, died 1681, before his father. His son,
SIR JOHN COTTON, 4th Bt., M.P. (1679-1731),
married in 1708, Elizabeth, daughter of James Herbert, of
Kingsey, Oxfordshire, granddaughter of the Ist Duke of


Leeds. He carried out his grandfather’s wishes respecting
the Library, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his
uncle,
SIR ROBERT COTTON, sth Bt. (1669-1749). He was
twice married, firstly to Elizabeth Wigston (d. 1745), by
whom he left a son,
SIR JOHN COTTON, 6th Bt., who died without issue,
27th March, 1752, when the title became extinct.
The Cotton family of Doogallook, Victoria, claims de-
scent from the Cottons of Conington.
WILLIAM COT! ON, F.S.A.,of St. Lawrence Pountney,
London, was born in 1769, and died in 1803. He was an
officer of H.M. Customs, and nephew and heir of Charles
Rogers, E.R.S., F.S.A. He married Catherine Savery, of an
old Devonshire family. They had issue;—
i. William, ed. Exeter Coll., Oxford University; mat-
riculated 30th April, 1811, when aged 17 years;
8.A., 1814; M.A., 1818. Rector of Adderley,
Salop, and P.C., Binleydam, Salop. Fellow,
Society of Antiquaries. William Cotton and his
brother John, Victorian pioneer, presented to the
City of Plymouth a library and collection of
manuscripts, together with several fine examples
of Sir Joshua Reynolds’ paintings, formerly
housed at the family seat, The Priory, Leather-
head, Surrey. This gift is now fittingly accom-
modated in the Plymouth Municipal Library,
which was endowed by the Carnegie Corporation.
He m. Mary Ann, daughter of the Rev. James
Collins, LL.D.
ii. Charles Rogers.
iii. John, Victorian pioneer, of whom we treat in the
Australian section of this record.
