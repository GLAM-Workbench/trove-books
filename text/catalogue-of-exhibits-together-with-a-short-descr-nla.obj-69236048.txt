THE COLONY OF FIJI.
The young Colony of Fiji is situate in the South
Pacific Ocean, between the latitudes of i 6� and 21 0
South, and between the longitudes of 176� East and
178� West. It is composed of about 225 islands
(80 of which are inhabited), and occupies over 40,000
square miles of the ocean. The principal islands
are Viti Levu, or Great Fiji, Vanua Levu, or Great
Land, Taviuni and Kadavu, the first of these being
about 90 miles long by 50 miles wide, the second
about ico miles by 20. The scenery in general is
very fine, the rich, soft, green'herbage being backed
by lofty peaks, rising, in some instances, to over
4000 feet in height. The distance from Melbourne
is about 2400 miles, in a north-easterly direction.
These islands were, on two occasions, offered to
the British Crown, and refused, and it was not till
the 10th October, 1874, that Sir Hercules Robinson,
then governor of New South Wales, proclaimed
them a British colony. The first Governor, Sir
Arthur Gordon, G.C.M.G., arrived at Levuka on
the 24th June, 1875, and assumed the reins of
Government on the -ist September of that year.
The progress of the colony from that time to the
present is shown by the statistics given at the end
of this paper.


It is estimated that there are about 5,000,000
acres in Fiji, less than one-seventh of which is
claimed by Europeans. The larger islands are well
watered by numerous rivers, many of them navigable
for a considerable distance inland. Along the banks
of these rivers there are thousands of acres of the
richest alluvial flats, on which the sugar-cane grows
to perfection. The Government sell the land at
the following upset prices, viz.: First-class, twenty
shillings; second-class, fifteen shillings; and third-
class, ten shillings per acre.
1 he climate is salubrious and healthy, the heat of
the sun being moderated by the prevailing S.E.
trade winds, which blow for nine months in the year.
The mean temperature is Bo�, the extremes being
6o� and 122 0 . Children thrive well there, and even
in the hottest part of the year the sun seems to have
no effect upon them.
The native population has been variously esti-
mated ; at one time it is believed there were as
many as 200,000, but a fair estimate at the present
day would be 100,000 souls. The white population
is now estimated at 3000 souls.
The islands are believed to be rich in minerals.
Iron ore is exhibited in the Fiji Court, and is
obtainable in quantities on the largest island?
Viti Levu?from Serua to Nadroga. Copper has
also been obtained on this island, but no mining has


been carried on, nor even prospecting, for any
metals.
The forests contain some very useful timber,
amongst which may be mentioned : Dakua, Vivi,
Vesi, Damanu, Assi, Bau, Moefi, Kau Solu, Kau
Naki, Dogo, and Kamoi, specimens of which are
in the Exhibition. Parcels of some of these timbers
have already been placed on the Melbourne market.
Products.
The chief products of the islands are : Sugar,
cotton, coffee, cocoanuts, maize, tobacco, arrowroot,
peanuts, and the various tropical fruits.
A few words on each of these may be here inter-
esting.
Sugar. ?The sugar-cane is indigenous to Fiji,
and grows luxuriantly on the flats along the river
banks; specimens of which are shown in the Exhi-
bition. On the banks of the River Rewa, in Viti
Levu, the present centre of the sugar industry, cane
is ripe for cutting in fifteen months from planting,
and ratoons in eleven months. As yet the cultiva-
tion has been but imperfect, and the mills at work are
only small; but still from 30 to 45 tons of cane to
the acre has been obtained, yielding from 2 to 2\
tons of sugar. The mills work all the year round,
but yet are inadequate to crush all the cane grown,
some of which has often to remain on the ground
months over ripe, yet the density averages io�
Baume, some yielding as high 12� Baume.


Value of sugar exported: 1875, ,�34 1 7 ; 1876,
IS77, �16,170; 1878, �18,640; 1879,
�26,687. Mill power is all that is wanted to increase
the export of this article to any extent.
Cotton .- ?The samples of cotton exhibited show
the adaptability of the islands for the growth of this
article. The great fall in price in the London
market about the year 1872 somewhat checked the
production, but lately prices have rallied, and a
number of the settlers are again turning their atten-
tion to it. Two crops may be picked within twelve
months from the planting of seeds. The export in
1879 amounted to .�44,020.
Coffee. ?The growing of coffee is only in its infancy,
yet the result shows that its future will be something
great. From trees barely two years old from 380
to 450 lbs. per acre have been picked. The hills in
the interior of the large islands have been pronounced
by competent authorities to be excellent coffee land,
and will soon rival Ceylon in the production of this
article.
Cocoanuts. ?A large extent of ground is covered
with the cocoanut palm, and copra ?the dried kernel
of the nut ?has been very largely exported, the value
in 1878 amounting to �'122,194. The other pro-
ducts from the cocoanut are fibre and oil, both of
which form articles of export from the colony.
Maize grows luxuriantly on the flats, yielding two


crops in the year; the export value in 1879 amount-
ing to � 10,651.
Tobacco . ?The climate of Fiji is also well suited
for the growth of tobacco, but the want of knowledge
of the proper mode of curing has prevented its
cultivation to any great extent; some has been
placed on the London market successfully. Last
year the value of this article exported was � 1122,
and this after supplying local wants.
Arrowroot and Tapioca are grown to a small
extent, but the quality produced shows that they are
quite at home in these islands, the former in fact
growing wild.
Peanuts, ?The value of the export of these last
year amounted to 3477*
Besides the foregoing, small quantities of the
following tropical products have been grown with
such success as to show the climate is suitable for
their production?namely, cocoa, cinchona, tea,
pepper, rice, and vanilla. There are also indigenous
oil-producing nuts, such as the candle-nut and the
dilo-nut (the oil of the latter is said to be a specific
for rheumatism). Beche-de-mer, vegetable-ivory,
lime-juice, pearl-shell, tortoise-shell, turtle, and
colonial distilled spirits .are also articles of export.
Live Stock. ?For the first time these appear
amongst the exports in 1879, t^ie value being


Cattle thrive remarkably well, the local demand
being now supplied with those reared in the colony.
Sheep are now being tried, but the effect of the
climate on the wool has not been ascertained.
Angora goats are doing well on the islands, where
they have been tried; and pigs and poultry are in
great numbers. There are no animals indigenous
to the islands. Reptiles are numerous, but none
venomous; snakes are from one to six feet long.
Lizards are in great variety, many of them beauti-
fully marked. The rivers and coasts abound with
fish of various kinds.
Government.
Fiji is a Crown colony, and governed as such by
an Executive Council and a Legislative Council.
The seat of government and the capital of the colony
has up to the present time been Levuka, situate on
the small island of Ovalau; but the prescribed
limits of the town?being, in fact, a mere beach with
mountains rising abruptly therefrom, and thus pre-
cluding any extension, and without any land avail-
able for agricultural settlement ?soon demonstrated
its unsuitability for occupying the position of capital
of what will soon become an important colony.
After inspection of sites on several of the islands,
and numerous consultations with the naval officers
and others on the station, and mature consideration,
the Governor recommended to the home authorities
that Suva, on the island of Viti Levu, be pro-
claimed the capital. This has been done, and the


first land sale in the new capital takes place on the
22nd November, 1880. Suva is situate on the south-
east of the island, and a good road has already been
formed from the site of the new capital to the Rewa
River. Suva harbour is acknowledged by compe-
tent authorities to be the finest in the colony. The
largest of our war vessels call there at the present
time to coal.
The Wesleyan and the Roman Catholic Churches
have long occupied these islands as a mission
station, and the natives now are nearly all nominal,
if not real, Christians. There is also an Episco-
palian church at Levuka, and one at Suva. The
Wesleyan body has the greatest hold on the native
population, and are very wealthy, being the owners
of a large part of the town of Levuka.
There is steam communication monthly from Mel-
bourne to Suva and Levuka; from Sydney to
Levuka, and from Auckland (N.Z.) to Levuka.
There are also several small steamers for the inter-
island trade, besides a large number of sailing
vessels; and the Government have arranged for
steam communication with the islands in the Tongan
Group.
The manufactured productions of the Fijians are
numerous, and by no * means contemptible. They
have several useful and ornamental manufactures in
pottery, and mould many tasteful and serviceable
articles, some of which they glaze and vary in


colour. They take their models from flowers,
leaves, and birds; and the women are the chief
manufacturers.
The masi, or native garment, is made from the
bark of the malo, which, after being softened by
immersion in water in the manner of flax, is beaten
out, and several strips joined together. After being
stretched to the desired size, these are carefully
dyed, or, more correctly speaking, painted. The
?masi? formerly constituted the principal clothing
and covering of the islanders, and is in the form of a
band around the waist, reaching nearly to the knee.
Mat-making is a source of wealth and occupation,
mats being used for many purposes, such as cover-
ing walls and floors, and as sails, and they are largely
exported to other islands. There are also ? nurs-
ing? and sleeping mats; and those used as floor
coverings are frequently from 25 to 30 feet square,
and painted in grotesque patterns. Hand-screens,
fans, and ornaments for the neck, arms, and ears are
also manufactured. A great trade is done with the
Tahitians and Sandwich Islanders in scarlet
feathers, which, in those islands, are a requisite por-
tion of the female toilet, and in Fiji are abundantly
furnished by the native parrots. Baskets and nets
form also items of industrial produce.
Mr. Horne, F.L.S., Director of the Botanical
Gardens, Woods, and Forests, Mauritius, spent
twelve months on the islands, and his testimony as
to the adaptability of the soil and climate for the


growth of sugar, coffee, &c,, is worth being quoted
here. He says: ?? Every visitor to Fiji (even from
countries in which the sugar-cane is the only plant
cultivated to any extent) cannot fail being struck
with the size, the healthy appearance, and the
rapidity of growth of the sugar-cane in Fiji. These
remarks do not only extend to the ? pet canes? of the
Fijians, which are to be found growing near the
houses in every native town; but they are general
and applicable to the canes on the settlers? planta-
tions, as well as to those planted by the Fijians for
thatch, the neglected state of the latter plantations
duly considered. The wild canes (vicos) of these
islands are to the cane-grower subjects of admir-
ation. They suggest to him interesting ideas about
the parentage of the sugar-cane, which undoubtedly
originated in the islands of the South Seas, where
from time immemorial it has been cultivated by the
inhabitants for various purposes, and carried to the
islands and countries in the eastern parts of tropical
Asia by their inhabitants when on migrating or pirat-
ical expeditions. An experienced cane-grower
would at once pronounce the so-called ? China cane?
an improved vico were he equally acquainted with
both. From the foreging it will be noted that the
climate of Fiji is by its nature well adapted for
growing the sugar-cane, and so is the soil. This in
most places is rich alluvium ?on the banks of rivers
loam, on gentle slopes and hillocks volcanic soils of
the richest descriptions, and at the bases of low hills
dibris brought down by innumerable agencies from
the sides of the mountains. The cane lands do not


exist in any one part of Fiji in particular; they are
to be found in all parts of the group. The extent
and richness of these lands, in conjunction with a
climate extremely favourable for growing and matur-
ing the sugar-cane, ought to make all well-wishers of
Fiji long for the time when sugar will be made in it
and exported by the hundred-thousand tons, and to
the value of a million pounds sterling. Before, how-
ever, such results can be brought about, planters
will have to cultivate the cane properly, and, in so
doing, use modern mechanical contrivances for
ploughing, grubbing, drilling, hoeing, &c. The
canes will have to be cut at the proper season of the
year, instead of cutting all the year through as at
present.? This practice he describes to be?a waste of
products which even expediency can scarcely excuse,
as about one-half of the canes are crushed when the
density of their juice is at the lowest, and, therefore,
yield a minimum amount of sugar.
?In Fiji there is a large extent of land which,
from a variety of causes, is better adapted for grow-
ing coffee than any other tropical product. The
greater portion of this land lies in the interior of
Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taviuni, and some portions
of Rabi, Ovalau, &c. These islands contain large
areas of almost incomparably fine coffee land, and
enjoy a climate which is at once healthy and well
adapted for the growth of the coffee tree, plant, or
bush. Next to sugar-cane growing that of coffee
will in future years claim a large share of attention.
Coffee-growing is now in its infancy in Fiji. It will
yearly extend, and become an important product of


these islands. Coffee will be second to none except
sugar in value; its export value will ultimately attain
to about a million and a-half or to two millions
sterling per annum. The plants of coffee seen in
the interior of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Taviuni
were remarkably healthy looking; indeed, the
healthy appearance of the plants proves that coffee
will succeed in Fiji beyond a doubt.?
The great want of Fiji is capital, suitable plant,
machinery, and experienced planters. With these
wants supplied nothing can prevent Fiji from push-
ing to the front. When we consider the high
price of land in Mauritius, the sugar-producing
island, and in Ceylon, the coffee-growing island,
and learn from the opinion of such experienced and
reliable men as Mr. Horne that Fiji can hold her own
even with these favoured places, we must come to
the conclusion that the capabilities of our young
colony have but to be known to cause it to become
what Mr. Horne has stated it ought to be?viz.,
the exporter of sugar by the hundred-thousand tons,
and to the value of a million pounds sterling.
