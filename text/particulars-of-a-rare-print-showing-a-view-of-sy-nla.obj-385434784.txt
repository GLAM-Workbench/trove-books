PARTICULARS OF A
RARE PRINT
showing a View of
Sydney Cove,
NEW SOUTH WALES,
DATED
April 10th, 1804.
PURCHASE, PRINTER. 2 KENSINGTON VIEW, BATH.


Particulars of a rare Print showing
a View of Sydney Cove, New South
Wales, dated April 1 Oth, 1804.
This Print came into my possession in
the year 1890. In that year a Mrs. Lye (now
deceased) resided in Beauford Square, Bath,
and carried on business as a Wardrobe Dealer,
she informed me she was asked to call at No.
19 Bennett Street, Bath, to take away a lot of
stuff from a room at the top of the house, and,
was told the room had not been touched for
nearly 40 years. Among the various articles
she brought away was this Print, and dozens
of old books. At this time no one knew that
Admiral Phillip had resided there; his last
resting place had never been discovered.
About the year 1905; Alderman T, Sturge
Cotterell of Bath, discovered his Tomb in
Bathampton Church, which is about 2 miles
from Bath. On making further enquiries it
was found that he had resided at No. 19 Ben-
nett Street, Bath, and died there August 31st,
1814. It then dawned upon me that the Print
undoubtedly belonged to Admiral Phillip.


Having spent some years in Sydney, New
South Wales, and returning to Bath in the
year 1887, the Print naturally interested me,
so I bought it from Mrs. Lye, and it has been
in my possession ever since. Unfortunately
I took no interest in the books ; these were
put in the ash-bin and taken away to the
destructor, no doubt these books also belong-
ed to Admiral Phillip and probably bore his
signature. There is not the least doubt the
Print I possess belonged to Admiral Phillip,
and the string is still attached to the Print
which is in a remarkably good condition.
The Print is 24 inches by 17 inches and
mounted on Canvas.
At the bottom of Print is the following ;
“A View of Sydney Cove, New South Wales.
From an Original Picture in the possession
of Isaac Clementson Esqr.
Fondon, published April 10th, 1804, by F.
Jukes, No. 10 Howland Street.”
