INTRODUCTION
The advances made in the last few years in the practice of metal Arc
Welding is chiefly due to a better knowledge and appliances for dealing
with same. This has not been obtained without a considerable amount of
thought and tests to obtain the best result. With our Victory D.C. Welding
Generators, after a number of years of practical test in actual work, we
have established an Australian-wide reputation confirmed by constantly
receiving repeat orders. Such confidence has now been obtained that
Battleships in their construction have been electrically welded in place of
riveting. Machinery subject to sudden vibration in working, such as large
Excavators, Crushing Plants, Bridges, Motor Car frames and wheels, Agri-
cultural Implements, Cranes, Gasometers, and every description of light
and heavy machinery are electrically welded together in their construction
at a far reduced cost both in labour and materials.
In the repairing department, unless seen one can hardly imagine how
simple the work is now compared with the old method, worn shafts are
built up and returned in the lathe. A thousand and one uses could be
described in the repair and restoration of broken and old machinery parts,
that were originally thrown away, are repaired and strengthened equal to
new.
GENERAL
We claim for our Victory Direct Current Generators absolute pene-
tration of the weld. The positive side of the welding leads attached to the
generator has 400 degrees centigrade more heat than the negative side
thereby ensuring absolute penetration in the welding. doubt
whether the metal has to be deposited with heat or electrolytically, direct
current has to be used for depositing successfully.
Further, with our Victory Generators, either a long or short arc can
be maintained, which extends the choice of electrodes to meet the require-
ments of the work.
Brazing with bronze rods can be done with penetration so effectively
that the iron can be seen melted with the bronze.
For special metal a flux electrode is necessary to overcome the high
oxidation inherent to the metal itself and special grades of steel.
Our Plants are arranged to suit various requirements. Some are belt
driven off the workshop shafting. Electric motor direct coupled to the
generator. In some instances a number of generators are direct coupled
to one electric motor so as to economise space and costs. Crude oil and
petrol engines are brought into use direct coupled or belted on to the
generator. Various methods are illustrated and described in this booklet.
We are at all times willing to advise our Client as to the best system to
adopt to suit their requirements.
Our Plants are made in various sizes to suit the work: —
No. I.—The smallest, is large enough for any small Engineering Shop for
light general work and repairing, welding up to I plate, has a
capacity from 50 to 150 amperes drooping voltage from initial
70 to 32 with Arc, using up to No. 8 Electrode.
No. 2.—Will do general work in an Engineering Shop, working up to 200
amperes, using up to No. 6 electrode.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


No. 3.—Will do heavy Engineering and Boiler work, having a welding
amperage from 60 to 300 amperes.
No. 4. —Has a capacity up to 400 amperes for hand welding, using large
electrodes, enabling heavy deposit of metal to be done quickly.
Also for cutting and burning out rivets.
No. 5. —Suitable for all classes of heavy work, has a general capacity
from 70 to 500 amperes.
No. 6,7, 8, 10. —Have respectively an amperage of 600, 700, 800 to 1,000
amperes for automatic machine welding enabling very fast welding
to be done.
There is no limit as to size we can manufacture these generators.
As the demand for greater amperages increases we will meet same with
larger generators.
All plants of their respective type are sent out complete with Switch-
board and Accessories.
CONSTRUCTION
In reference to the construction of these D.C. Arc Welders. We have
constantly striven to and have improved our Welders to meet the varying
requirements and improvements made by the various Electrode Manufac-
turers in the use of different metals. In fact we have succeeded in pro-
ducing a generator giving such results that one large Manufacturer of
Electrodes in their booklet states that without special gadgets the drooping
voltage generators could not do, for this reason we have named our
Generator the "Victory” Generator.
We have built these generators having an output up to 1,000 amperes
driven with a single motor for automatic machine welding.
On account of the severe work they often have to do, are of rugged
construction, made of the best materials. Designed to the latest British
standard. Self excited and thoroughly tested for overload. Every care is
taken in the process of manufacture. Each part tested before assembling.
All bearings are of the Ball and Roller type of British manufacture.
With our new Victory designed generators, the separate stabilizing
coils are not required. The principal of this coil has been more effectively
embodied in the generator itself to such an extent that the Arc can be
drawn out in some instances to nearly -|-inch without breaking. This has
greatly simplified holding the Arc which has also tendered to better and
smoother welding.
Should very small amperage be required for very fine work an extra
stage can be supplied attached to the switchboard as per figure 3 under the
switchboard description, the degree of amperes being controlled by the
main ampere regulator.
OPERATION
They start with an initial voltage of 65. This voltage being necessary
for the striking of the Arc. After the Operator strikes the Arc the
voltage immediately droops to 30 volts, which is sufficient to maintain the
Arc at all amperages and weld the metal in perfect penetration.
This drooping voltage is obtained in the design of the Generator (not
by inserting wasteful resistance), thereby reducing the power to drive the
Generator, resulting in a very efficient plant. Perfect welds can be obtained
in any position overhead, etc.

For Remote Control
Portable Ampere Regulator
(weight 7 lbs.)
ADDENDUM
Special, to our plant, we can supply a portable Remote Control ampere
regulator, with which the Wielding Operator can do any adjustment of his
welding amperage without going to the set. In some instances he may be
working a hundred feet or more from the plant, with this portable ampere
regulator (weighing 7 lbs.), he can do any adjustment he requires, which
means a great saving of time and better work.
The Portable Remote Control Regulators are separately quoted.
ELECTRODES
To give a full range of Electrodes, bare and various classes of material
and degrees of flux on them, their best condition for use, the different am-
perages required for various classes of work, the electrical units consumed,
and the total cost per foot run, would require a booklet far larger than
the present one. For instance, take a 3-16 in. electrode. Hand welding
could be satisfactorily done with 175 to 250 amperes. Yet for automatic
machine welding as much as 600 amperes can be used for the same size con-
tinuous electrode with this difference. The number of inches run per
minute would be anything from 45 inches for the automatic welding,
against 3 inches for hand welding. Practically 15 times more length of
welding by the automatic using only 2i times the number of electrical units.
The operator doing 15 times more length of welding in the same time.
The present call is for more amperage, occupying less time to deposit a
certain quantity given, pointing to the fact that Arc Welding, to meet
present day progress, has to be done quickly (consistent with good work),
using Electrodes requiring more amperes in half the time consuming only
the same units of energy as the slower process with far less labor costs.
With our Generators bare wire Electrodes can be used which cost far less
than covered electrodes.
We shall be only too pleased to advise our Client in a straight-forward
manner as to the best proposition to suit their requirements.
So varied are the conditions and requirements, we have two lists
printed at the end of this booklet, reprint of Design Data to conform with
the S.A.A. code of 1933. We shall be pleased to supply copies of these
lists on application.

SWITCHBOARDS
Fig. 3.
Fig. 1.
Fig. 2.
Three Switchboards are illustrated:—
Figure I.—ls the usual type supplied, consisting of Automatic cutout,
Ampere regulator with dial indicating the approximate amperes
above the scale with the size of the electrodes marked below the
scale, Remote control plug switch for use of a portable regulator
as previously described, Two main terminals. All mounted on
Ebony sindanyo panel with iron brackets for convenience of
attaching the switchboard on to a frame or wall.
Figure 2.—lllustration is similar to the other switchboard excepting that
a volt meter is mounted on same for when the welding generator
is driven with a petrol engine or any power subject to variation
to enable the R.P.M. to be checked.
Figure 3.- —This panel illustrated above the other two switchboards depicts
an additional panel below the usual panel, for use when very
small special work has to be done requiring very small electrodes.
The amperage required of this panel is governed by the same
ampere regulator on the main panel having a separate dial in-
dicating approximately the amperes required.
It should be pointed out that amperes marked on the dial are
approximate in as much that different operators have their own ideas of
the length of the Arc to maintain resulting in the variation of the amperes
also the voltage. The dials being calibrated at a standard voltage. The
operator soon gauges the dial most suitable for his own Welding.
The Electrode gauge indicator also is affected with the different make
of the electrode as well as the different flux and material used in the
Electrode.

Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


TWO VICTORY GENERATORS DRIVEN WITH ONE BELT
Two D.C. Victory Generators and Switchboard,
mounted on channel iron base.
The illustration shows two direct current generators coupled together
with a flexible coupling which also forms the pulley for driving the two
generators, both mounted on one strong channel iron base to which is
also attached the two switchboards. This is a two operator set, each
generator having the drooping voltage which considerably reduces the
power required to drive the generators.
This plant was designed for convenience in driving off a crude oil
or other class of Engine with one belt. In this instance a crude oil
Engine was used and two such sets were used. One set driven off of
the fly wheel of the engine and the other set off a pulley on the engine.
This arrangement added to the convenience of moving the sets without
disarranging the connections, etc.
Two such sets consisting of four generators driven off one crude oil
engine were used and did all the welding in the construction of the largest
dredge ever built in the Southern Hemisphere. (See illustration of
dredge.)
Any combination of sets for the convenience of our clients we shall
only be too pleased to arrange.
Eye bolts are placed on each generator for convenience of lifting.
They form a very compact arrangement with switchboard, all mounted
on the strong channel iron base.
The usual accessories are supplied with each generator.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


SPECIAL FIVE OPERATOR SET
Five operator set driven by one electric motor.
Driven by one Electric Motor. Suitable for Railways and large Workshops.
The advantage of the above Multi-operator set our Generators having
a drooping voltage characteristic from 70 for the initial volts to 32 volts
maintaining the arc. A very economical set is produced, less floor space
required and the cost of the plant less.
The above Generators have a welding amperage of 300 amperes each.
Yet a 40 horse power 3 phase motor drives the five generators with ease.
The print shows them all direct coupled together with the motor in the
centre. All mounted on a strong channel iron base. The switchboards are
mounted in the Operators’ cubicle, convenient for their work.
We shall be pleased to quote for this or any other arrangement
suggested.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PORTABLE DIRECT COUPLED SET
Drooping Voltage Victory Generator, Direct coupled
to A.C. Motor.
The illustration shows an alternating current motor, direct coupled
to one of our Direct Current Welding Generators, mounted on wheels for
portability.
The direct current motor generator set can be mounted similarly for
convenience in moving to different parts of a large works where work has
to be done.
The usual switchboard is supplied.
Below the channel iron base we place an iron tray in which welding
cable, electrodes, etc., can be carried.
The portable set has a galvanised canopy with canvas side curtains to
keep the weather and dust from the set. Also an eye bolt projecting
through the iron canopy for lifting the set with a crane, etc.
We can also supply all iron enclosures with locked doors as a greater
protection, where sets are liable to be interfered with.
Clayton-]oel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PORTABLE VICTORY ARC WELDING SET
The above print illustrates the method of mounting of the smaller
size welder driven by either a D.C. or A.C. motor. The particulars of the
plant are as previously described. The difference is only in the mounting
of the set for portability having only three wheels. The front wheel has
a tug bar attached to same, which makes the set more convenient to
manipulate in confined spaces.
The generator and motor are so well balanced that no vibrations are
set up. The outside dimensions are restricted compatible as possible without
impairing the general design of the motor and generator to comply with
the British Standards.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PROTECTIVE PORTABLE VICTORY ARC WELDING SET
The above is the enclosed view of the previous welding set encased
in sheet steel, having sliding doors and locks to enable the plant to be
securely protected against being interfered with and protection against
the weather when being operated in the open air. All parts are convenient
for inspection. The whole of this outside framing can be easily removed
by undoing four bolts without disturbing any part of the interior.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PETROL DRIVEN SET
D.C. Victory Drooping Voltage Generator direct coupled
to petrol engine.
This illustration depicts one of our Victory D.C. Welding Generators
direct coupled to a petrol engine. In this instance a Ford A engine.
Forming a very compact plant which can be conveyed and used where other
methods of driving the generator are not available.
The engine is complete with a sensitive governor and high tension
magneto, having a positive drive off the timing wheel gear. An extra
heavy fly wheel is fitted which is used to obtain regular speed also to over-
come the sudden load placed on the engine which is inevitable in all Arc
Welding Plants.
We also attach an Idling valve which enables the engine to idle when
not required for any length of time. This attachment is the means of
increasing the life of the engine also considerably cutting the running
costs.
With these plants we strongly recommend our small portable ampere
regulator which the Operator can carry on his arm, allowing him to make
any variation of his amperage without going to the set which possibly may
be some distance from where he is working.
WE BUILD OUR SETS FOR ANY TYPE OF DRIVE OR
REQUIREMENTS
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PETROL ENGINE DRIVEN WELDING OUTFIT ENCLOSED IN
SHEET STEEL PROTECTIVE HOUSING
Petrol driven Set enclosed.
The above print illustrates the method of enclosing the petrol set. The
total enclosing consists of angle iron framing supporting a sheet iron
canopy top with sheet iron sliding doors with bolts and padlocks to lock
up the Plant when not in use.
The petrol tank and radiator are both filled through opening above
the iron canopy. The caps of which can also be locked to prevent petrol
being taken out of the tank.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PORTABLE PETROL ENGINE DRIVEN ARC WELD PLANT
This set is of the same description as the previous petrol Arc Welding
Set. Illustrating the method of mounting on wheels. In this instance
the wheels are cast steel to enable the set to be pulled over rough roads.
The wheel hubs are bushed with gun metal and have grease lubricators.
This Plant has steel springs with a special turn table, altogether making
a very substantial job.
When only required to be moved about large works, the whole of this
under-carriage can be simplified with reduced costs.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PORTABLE PETROL ENGINE DRIVEN ARC WELDING PLANT
PROTECTIVELY ENCLOSED IN SHEET STEEL
FRAMING AND DOORS
This illustration shows the previous petrol Plant with wheels and.
springs, totally enclosed in a sheet steel enclosure with sliding doors and
locks.
These plants can also be supplied with wheels having solid or pneumatic
tyres with or without the steel springs. Or they can be mounted on a
strong two-wheeled trailer with pneumatic tyres and tug bar for attaching
behind a motor lorry. When disconnecting from the lorry supports are
let down to act as props. With this system it saves a lot of trouble when
the welding sets have to be removed to different parts of the country,
without having to be lifted on to the motor lorry.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PETROL ENGINE DRIVING TWO GENERATORS
FOR TWO OPERATORS
The above illustration represents two generators direct coupled to
petrol engine for two welding operators to work at the same time. There
are two distinct welding generators each being complete on its own, driven
off the one engine. The engine has a special governor so that there is no
interference in either one or both operators in carrying on their work.
At the back end of the frame is shown a compartment, which contains
various shelves to carry the electrodes, remote control, etc., also a winding
drum on which both the welding and earth cables are wound, which keeps
them in good order, and all can be securely locked up at night. This extra
locker while increasing the length of the plant has great advantages.
This plant has fairly large wheels, flat leaf springs, turntable and dust-
proof timken roller bearings which reduce the friction and saves a lot of
traction power in moving the plant about on the job.
Pneumatic tyres can also be fitted if the plant has to travel at full
motor lorry speeds.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


ENCLOSED PETROL ENGINE TWO-OPERATOR
ARC WELDING SET
Illustrating the previous double generator set but with the hinged
doors closed making it weatherproof and securely locked.
The petrol engine we usually supply is the Ford "A” type which has
ample power and is economical. Spare parts for same can always be readily
obtained.
We can also use any suitable petrol engine that our Client may have.
A suitable special governor can be fitted and an extra heavy flywheel
should also be attached, as the usual flywheel fitted to motor car engines is
usually not suitable to withstand the shock of striking the welding arc.
Clayton-Jocl & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


TRACTOR DRIVEN WELDER PLANT
This illustration shows two D.C. Victory Arc Welding Generators
mounted on a Fordson Tractor for two Operators to work at the same time.
The print shows clearly the method of mounting the generators on a channel
and angle iron frame. Also the two switchboards which are arranged in
back of the framing protected with doors.
The generators are driven off the engine by means of three Vee belts
on each generator. These belts, when necessary, can be adjusted, the
generators are free to move along slide rails arranged in the structure with
screw attachments. The hand wheels attached to the screws are shown
on the print. The grooved pulley on the engine has a separate clutch
which enables the pulley to be disconnected from the engine when the
generators are not required. Thus there is no interference with the
travelling gear of the Tractor.
These Tractors are started with petrol. The carburetter arranged so
that after starting kerosene is used.
These plants form a very compact and economical two Operator
Welding Set.
The Tractor can also be supplied with one Welding Plant, etc., for
single operator.
Clayton-]oel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


TRACTOR ENCLOSED WITH CANVAS CURTAINS
An iron canopy top is attached to the angle iron framing and canvas
side curtains are arranged for protection against the weather, being cleated
on to a wood frame attached to the angle iron framing.
Sheet steel protection can be arranged with locked doors if necessary.
So strong and rigid is the framing attached to the Engine that when
both generators are working not a sign of a tremor occurs on the whole
plant.
Solid rubber tyred wheels illustrated in the print. Pneumatic tyres can
be supplied which are an improvement for driving through soft roads.
Higher speeds can be attained while travelling and less vibration on rough
roads.
In attaching the framing to carry the Welders no part of the Tractor
is altered. By taking out a few bolts the whole of the framing can be
removed en bloc leaving the Tractor as originally.
We would also be pleased to mount our generators, etc., on Tractors
supplied by our Clients.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PORTABLE PETROL DRIVEN PLANT MOUNTED ON
PNEUMATIC TYRE WHEELS
The above illustration represents petrol engine direct coupled to D.C.
Arc Welding Generator mounted on four wheels, pneumatic tyres 20in. x
4.00, flat leaf steel springs, turntable and towing bar. The wheel centres
and hubs are cast steel with the outside rim welded on. The bearings are
Timken roller adjustable type with dust-proof caps.
These plants can be obtained in all sizes. Single operative drooping
voltage generator direct coupled to Ford "A” engine or any other suitable
petrol engine.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PORTABLE ENCLOSED PETROL DRIVEN PLANT
MOUNTED ON PNEUMATIC TYRE WHEELS
The above illustration is the same as the previous plant completely
enclosed in sheet steel housing, completely weatherproof with padlocked
doors The whole is substantially mounted on a strong channel iron base
with angle iron framing for the enclosed portion, and can be towed over
roads at a fair pace.
Clayton-]ocl & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


STATIONARY PETROL SET DRIVEN WITH FORD "C”
To meet the demands for a compact light portable plant we have
specially designed at slightly higher speed a generator direct coupled to a
10 h.p. petrol Ford "C” engine, or similar engine.
This engine at about half its full normal speed will develop 18 b.h.p.;
sufficient to drive one of our No. 2 size generators with a full spare margin
of safety and economical running.
These plants for the last three years have been very successful in
operation for which we have received repeat orders and can confidently
recommend them.
The print above illustrates the set for stationary work or for carrying
about on a motor lorry allowing the lorry to carry the best part of its usual
load.
The generator has a fabricated body and, what with the extra speed,
results in an appreciable reduction of weight. Bearings are of the ball and
roller type.
When these engines are attached to our No. 1 drooping characteristic
generators they are capable of giving 150 amperes using up to No. 8 elec-
trode. Our No. 2 generator 200 amperes using up to No. 6 electrode.
They can be mounted as portable plants, being very convenient for
handling.
The engines are very economical to run. Three gallons of petrol will
last on ordinary welding eight hours.
Clayton-]oel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PORTABLE PETROL ARC WELDING PLANT
MOUNTED ON TRAILER
The above illustration represents one of our D.C. Arc Welding
Generators direct coupled to a petrol engine mounted on a two wheel
trailer. Road travelling at ordinary motor lorry speeds can be obtained.
The design, as far as details, has been carefully thought out. It is
well sprung on flat leaf springs, has steel wheels with pneumatic tyres, bear-
ings of the ball or roller dust-proof type, extra special chrome steel axle, etc.
Suitable strong adjustable rests for use when trailer is stationary. There
is no wood work. The steel springs being bolted direct on to the channel
iron base of the engine and generator which allows the whole of the
undercarriage to be removed if required for stationary work.
Trailers have been very successful for ordinary merchandise and with
the refined special design should be more so for welding plants, being more
convenient to handle.
The whole can be made weatherproof with lock-up doors.
Box for electrodes, cables, etc., can be arranged if desired.
Clayton-Jocl & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PORTABLE WELDING GENERATOR DRIVEN
WITH FORD "C” PETROL ENGINE
This illustration represents the special light plant mounted on steel
wheels and springs. The wheels have dust-proof timken roller bearings and
tug-bar complete making a light ideal portable set.
The plant can also be supplied with sheet steel canopy top and enclosed
in sheet steel enclosure with doors and padlocks for locking-up purposes.
Or, alternatively, with the steel canopy top and canvas side curtains.
These plants are usually supplied complete with all necessary
accessories.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


PORTABLE PETROL ENGINE DRIVEN ARC WELDING PLANT
PROTECTIVELY ENCLOSED IN SHEET STEEL
FRAMING AND DOORS
The above illustration depicts the previous plant, totally enclosed in
sheet steel housing, weatherproof. Either hinged or sliding doors can be
fitted with padlocks for locking up the plant when not in use.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


EMERY GRINDER
A COMBINATION POWER UNIT FOR GRINDING AND DRILLING
The above illustration represents the Electric Grinder Equipment.
-The electric motor driving same has been specially designed for this.
The electric supply is taken off our welding generators. It is of ample
power and is not liable to burn out with rough usage. The speed is 3,000
r.p.m., at which speed the motor will develop up to 3 h.p. before stalling,
while its nominal h.p. required is 1.
The flexible shaft is 6ft. 6in. long and has also a flexible head on which
the emery wheel is mounted. This obviates all jarring when the wheel comes
into contact with the work.
There is practically no limit of the length of the electric cable con-
necting this motor to the welding generator.
The weight of the motor is 65 lb. plus the flexible shaft makes it very
convenient for handling and carrying about. This is a very substantial
plant which we can recommend.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


ELECTRIC DRILL
A COMBINATION POWER UNIT FOR GRINDING AND DRILLING
This illustration represents an Electric Drill Equipment.
Drills from ?in. to gin. can be used, or special sizes can be arranged
for. To use the drill the emery wheel is removed and the drill attached,
which in itself contains the necessary reduction gear for reduced speed to
suit the drills.
Attached to the drilling frame is a convenient de-clutching movement
which enables the drill to be immediately stopped, thereby preventing
breaking of drills. The drilling is fed similar to that of the ordinary
ratchet hand drill, powerful enough for quick work. An ordinary back
stop suitable for the work to be done is used.
For unusual drilling apart from the standard drill it has no
competitors.
Clayton-Joel & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


SMALL PORTABLE WELDING SET
The above illustration is of our smallest size D.C. Victory Arc Welding
Sets. Mounted on wheels. Enclosed in sheet steel housing with doors and
locks. The open doors show the switchboard and the three phase star delta
motor Starter. The wheels are cast iron, the hubs bushed with gun metal,
grease lubricators for greasing the bearings.
The size can be gauged in comparison with the lad standing holding
the tug bar handle.
Clayton-Jocl & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


CHARACTERISTIC CURVE OF OUR VICTORY DROOPING
VOLTAGE GENERATORS
The print above shows the voltage curve, practically a straight line
after the Arc has been struck for all amperages. This particular curve
is of our No. 2 size having an amperage from 50 to 200 amperes. The
initial voltage being 70 drooping automatically to 32 with the Arc. This
is achieved purely in the design of the generator without any wasteful
resistance in the Arc circuit.
All sizes have similar curve according to their size and amperages.
Clayton-Jocl & Co., Electrical Engineers, Melbourne


VARIOUS PORTABLE PLANT MOUNTINGS
To save repetition in the various methods of mounting these welding
plants, practically all the various methods can be applied to the different
plants irrespective of the size or number of generators. We here give a
brief description of each mounting and application or use:
For moving the plant about an ordinary large factory: Cast iron wheels
are quite suitable with plain sleeve G.M. bushes, with lubricators either in
plain ordinary bearings, dust-proof bearings or roller bearings. Up to
No. 3 size generators three wheels are used with special turntable and
tug-bar.
For ordinary road travelling at moderate speeds: Four steel wheels of
fair size with flat leaf springs, G.M. dust-proof bearings with lubricators,
turntable and tug-bar.
For travelling at motor lorry speeds: Four wheels fitted with pneuma-
tic tyres, steel leaf springs, turntable, timken roller bearings, dust-proof,
will travel a long distance without regreasing.
Trailers: Specially designed with pneumatic tyres, ball or timken
roller bearings; with proper span wheel base and rigid adjustable rests for
support. uncoupled from lorry, form a very convenient method
without the trouble of lifting the plant on and off the motor lorry.
So far as tractors are concerned, to obtain a reasonable speed and
better grip of swampy roads they should have pneumatic tyres. With this
method the whole is self contained and quite independent of auxiliaries for
travelling purposes.

PIPE LINE WELDING
(Photo, by courtesy of "The Argus,” Melbourne.)
The above illustration represents one of the many uses for which our
portable welding plants have been employed.
This large and long pipe line has all the joints welded inside and out-
side The size of the pipe can be judged by the welding Operator inside.
Beside the Operator the print shows our Portable Ampere Remote
Control with which he can vary his welding current to suit his requirements.
Overhead, Vertical and Horizontal welding have a variable adjustment
also, for the different size electrodes. All the variations can be made to
meet his requirements without shifting his position.
The convenience and saving of time is well established against the
Operator having to signal or go to the set to make necessary adjustments.

All Welded Dredge built at Greymouth, New Zealand.
While we do not propose to illustrate the very many uses our Plants
have been used for, yet the above illustration will convey some idea as to
the immense strides that welding has made. The builders of the dredge
claim that this particular dredge is the largest ever built in the Southern
Hemisphere and only one in the world all electrically welded.
The whole welding was done with four of our generators driven by one
Crude Oil Engine, arranged as per illustration page 9.

Bell Weighing 17 Cwt, Cracked. Welded with one of cur Direct
Current Welding Generators.
This is also a very special job done which we can claim as unique in
which one of our D.C. Welding Generators was used. This Church Bell
developed a crack 12 inches long at the point of contact with the clapper.
The work was carried out by Messrs. S. Lacey Sc Sons at their Sale works.
The bell was cast in France in 1889, is 42 inches in diameter, 39 inches
high and weighs 17 cwt. The thickness of the section where the crack
occurred was 3 inches maximum tapering to 11 inches. The crack was
properly prepared for welding. Altogether some 150 feet of No. 8 gauge
special electrode light flux coated was used, using 200 amperes. This is
one of the difficult jobs requiring a D.C. Plant to ensure success.

ELECTROLYTIC GENERATOR
While the above at present hardly comes within the category of Arc
Welding they are akin in some respects. We specialise in the manufacture
of both.
The illustration shows a low voltage generator designed to give 3,000
amperes. The generator is driven by a three phase electric motor direct
coupled through a flexible coupling. The generator shaft is extended on
which we build the exciter that supplies the amperes in the field system
of the generator. Whereby a greater range for controlling the output of
the generator without inserting a wasteful resistance.
The Motor, Generator and Exciter are all mounted on a strong channel
iron base.
Ball and Roller bearings used throughout.
We shall be pleased to give quotations for these plants to any capacity.

NOTES. 1. The strengths shown are for welds without eccentricity of loading. When
designing lap*welds, the eccentricity must bp allowed for.
2. The working stress figures given are based on test results using 28-32 ton
structural grade mild steel. If different quality steel is used, the working
stresses must be adjusted accordingly.
3. All butt welds shown result in reinforcement to the extent of 10 % of the
area, of section. If ground flush, deduct 10 9c from the working stress.
4. If single vee butt welds in plate over I-inch trick are not finished with a
run on the back, deduct 50% from the working stress.
5. The welds marked *•* are not permissible under the S.A.A. code.
6. For costing, see columns marked *, electrode, power and labour. The figures
for labour are only intended as a guide, the actual time being entirely
dependent on the nature of the work. For vertical -welding add 10% and
for overhead add 15 % to the amount of electrode used, and the cost per
lineal foot.
