Praise—Psalm 46, i.-v.
(Tune 128).
God is our refuge and our strength, in straits a present aid;
Therefore, although the earth remove, we will not be
afraid:
Though hills amidst the seas be cast;
Though waters roaring make,
And troubled be; yea, though the hills by swelling seas do
shake.
A river is, whose streams do glad the city of our God;
The holy place wherein the Lord most high hath his abode,
God in the midst of her doth dwell; nothing shall her
remove:
The Lord to her an helper will, and that right early, prove.

Praise—
(Hymn 272).
Onward! Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ, the Royal Master.
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See! His banners go.
Onward! Christian soldiers.
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.


At the sign of triumph
Satans legions flee;
On then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell’s foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.
Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
’Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise,
And that cannot fail.
Onward, then, ye people!
Join our happy throng;
Blend with .ours your voices
In the triumph song,
“Glory, laud, and honour.
Unto Christ the King!”
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing.
Intimations and Offertory.
Anthem-—“ Crossing tlie Bar”

Praise—“ God Save the King.” (Hymn 511)
God save our gracious King
Long live our noble King,
God save the King!
Send him victorious.
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the King!
Far o’er the rolling main,
Echoes the loyal strain,
God save the King!
One great united band,
Pray we through every land,
God guard our Empire grand,
God save the King!
Thy choicest gifts in store,
On him be pleased to pour,
Long may he reign;
May he defend our laws,
And ever give us cause,
To sing with heart and voice
God save the King!


Benediction.
