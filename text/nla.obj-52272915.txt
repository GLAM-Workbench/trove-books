The World and the Empire: A Comparison of their Mineral
Outputs.
In seeking to make comparisons with reference to the world’s
mineral production, it is well, at the outset, to get some idea,
however rough, of the relative importance of the different minerals
or mineral groups that enter into the comparisons.
In the first place, the annual value of the world’s coal output
is about equal to that of all other minerals put together. Petro-
leum and iron ore come next in order of importance.
Coal, petroleum and iron ore together account for about 80 per
cent, of the annual value of the world’s output of minerals, and
the addition of raw materials of the precious and base metals,
together with those of the ordinary iron-alloy metals, will probably
bring the proportion to not less than about 95 per cent, of the
total, the remainder being accounted for chiefly by diamonds,
sulphur, salt, potash, phosphates, asbestos and a few other
minerals. Building stones, etc., are not included in this estimate,
as statistical data are lacking.
The following table shows the world’s total output of the more
important minerals and metals for 1913 and 1928, the Empire
contributions being shown side by side for comparison :
World and British Empire Outputs of the more important Minerals
and Metals, 1913 and 1928, in order of value.
* Metal content of ore produced. t Troy oz. + Metric carats.
1 2
90-13


A consideration of this table shows that, during the period
of 15 years between 1913 and 1928, the mineral production of
the world has on the whole increased largely, in spite of the
comparative stagnation shown by the outputs of coal and iron ore.
Petroleum shows a very remarkable increase, the 180 million
tons output of 1928 being more than three times the output of 1913.
This is by far the most important increase in the mineral output
during the period referred to.
Iron ore shows a decrease, more especially as regards the Empire
output.
Gold shows a substantial decrease on the world’s total, but the
Empire total remains about the same.
The base metals and silver show on the whole a substantial
increase, especially copper, but except for lead and zinc the
Empire percentage of the total has fallen.
: The world totals for manganese and nickel have both increased
largely.
Chrome ore is a notable instance of a large increase, showing
as it does a nearly threefold increase for the world as a whole, with
a large increase in the Empire percentage.
Asbestos shows a large increase with ail improved Empire
percentage.
Bauxite production has gone up nearly fourfold, and the Empire
is no longer a negligible contributor to the output, as it was in
1913.
Diamonds show an increase, but the Empire percentage has
fallen largely. The output of diamonds outside the Empire was
negligible in 1913, whereas foreign countries were responsible for
a quarter of the total output in 1928.
Graphite shows an increased output for the world as a whole,
whereas the Empire output is about halved.
Potash and sulphur show remarkable increases in the world
total, but the Empire outputs of these minerals, as also those of
phosphates and pyrites, continue to be comparatively unimportant.
Thus the mineral production of 1928, as compared with that of
1913, shows that the Empire has fallen back, in comparison with
the world as a whole. It should be pointed out, however, that
the chief cause of this is the large increase of the world’s petroleum
production, to which the Empire contributes only a very small
percentage.


Although no particular part of the British Empire can claim
to be well placed as regards its independence in the matter of
mineral supplies, it is worthy of note that the supplies available
in the different parts of the Empire are so complementary to one
another that the Empire as a whole is distinctly well placed in
this respect, and compares favourably as regards independence with
other parts of the world. From this point of view we may divide
minerals into four groups as follows : —•
1. Minerals which the rest of the world imports largely
from the Empire, namely, asbestos, china clay, chromite,
diamonds, gold, mica, nickel and tin.
2. Minerals of which the Empire has ample supplies, and
an exportable surplus, namely, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, coal,
fluorspar, fuller’s earth, graphite, gypsum, lead, manganese,
monazite, salt, silver, strontium and zinc.
3. Minerals for supplies of which the Empire depends in
some measure on foreign countries, but of which it has great
resources, namely, bauxite, barium minerals, copper, felspar,
iron ore, magnesite, molybdenum, phosphates, platinum, talc,
tungsten and vanadium.
4. Minerals for supplies of which the Empire almost entirely
depends on foreign countries, and of which its resources are
comparatively small or negligible, namely, antimony, bismuth,
borates, petroleum, potash, pyrites, quicksilver, sulphur, and
radium.
The position thus disclosed as regards degree of independence
in the matter of mineral supplies is one with reference to which
the Empire need not fear comparison with the rest of the world.
Large as is the significance of the direct petroleum supplies of
the earth at present, the time is probably not far distant when
industrial needs as regards fuel will have to be met more and
more from the large stores of coal and oil shale in the earth. Coal
and iron ore are the two chief mineral needs of industrial civiliza-
tions, and in these two very important mineral items the British
Empire has enormous reserves, the enterprising utilization of which
should secure for it for some centuries to come a high place in
the world’s industries; while from a comparative point of view,
the future outlook as regards supplies of copper and the other
base metals, as well as the iron-alloy metals, must be regarded
as promising for the Empire as a whole.
The table on page 6 shows the Empire countries arranged in
order of importance as regards the declared annual values of their
mineral outputs for 1928.

Annual Values of the Mineral Outputs for Countries of the British Empire and Mandated Territories, 1928.


From the table it will be seen that the value of the mineral output
of the United Kingdom for 1928 amounted to 45.6 per cent, of the
total for the Empire.
The values of the outputs for the Dominions and India amounted
altogether to 45.4 per cent, of the total for the Empire.
The values for British Malaya, Southern Ehodesia, South-West
Africa, Nigeria, Gold Coast, Trinidad and British Borneo together
amounted to 7.8 per cent, of the total.
The values for the rest of the Empire amounted to only 1.2 per
cent, of the total, the chief items in this being those of Northern
Ehodesia, British Guiana, Nauru and Ocean Islands, Ceylon,
Cyprus and the Irish Free State, which together account for one
per cent.
United Kingdom.
The mining industry of Great Britain is of extreme antiquity,
for the mining of gold, lead and copper ores was carried on during
Eoman occupation, and the mining of tin ore and iron ore is more
ancient still.
Coal, the production of which is the principal mining industry
of Great Britain, was first worked in England in the 13th century.
During the 19th century, however, there was a phenomenal in-
crease in the output and consumption of coal, due largely to the
invention and development of the steam engine, the conversion
of coal into coke, and to improvements in the metallurgy of iron.
In the year 1800, about 10 million tons of coal were raised, whereas
in 1913 the record output of upwards of 287 million tons was
attained.
Haematite was probably the first iron ore worked in Great
Britain, wrought iron being obtained from primitive furnaces.
Smelting furnaces and refining forges were introduced about 1711,
and have continued until the present day. Cast iron was first
made in the 14th century, and steel by the Bessemer process in
1856. The first blast furnace was erected about 1735, rolling
mills for rolling sheet in 1728, crucibles for melting steel in 1740,
grooved rolls for rolling bars and rods in 1782, reverberatory
puddling furnaces for converting cast into wrought iron in 1784,
and the hot blast was first used by Neilson in 1829.
British steel is considered the finest in the world, and more steel
is being manufactured to-day than in 1913.
The important china clay industry of the west of England has
been in existence for upwards of 160 years, and is by far the most
important in the world. In 1853, the production of china clay
from Cornwall and Devon amounted to 26,000 tons; in 1856 it

rose to 68,616 tons, and in recent years the annual output has
been about 800,000 tons.
England was formerly the chief producer of fuller’s earth, but
in recent years the United States has produced more than three
times the output of the United Kingdom. Fuller’s earth is raised
chiefly from Eeigate, Surrey. The output in the United Kingdom
in 1921 amounted to 20,242 tons, but the amount of the output
has not been recorded since that date.
The United Kingdom also produces large quantities of limestone,
clay and shale (not including china clay), igneous rocks, chalk,
gravel and sand, sandstone and fireclay, moulding sand, ganister,

Goal. —ln Great Britain, coal-bearing Carboniferous strata occur
in forty detached areas, each of which ranks as a coalfield, but they
are usually grouped as the Southern, Midland or Central and
Northern Eegions.
During the last 65 years the coal industry in Great Britain has
made great strides. The output of coal rose from about 98 million
tons in 1865 to the record figure of 287 million tons for 1913. Since
then the output has varied from about 126 J million tons in 1926
(the year of the great strike) to 276 million tons in 1923. In 1928,
the production amounted to 237 J million tons, but rose to
258 million tons in 1929. In the latter year, the consumption in
Great Britain (including mine consumption and miners’ coal)
amounted to 173-2- million tons, and the shipments to 82 million
tons (including coke, etc.), while the average selling price at the
pithead was 13s. sd. per ton as compared with 12s. lOd. per ton in
1928.
No bituminous coal is being raised at present in Northern
Ireland. In 1928, there was a production of 640 tons of lignite
from Co. Antrim.
Petroleum and Oil Shale. —Natural petroleum has been obtained
from a well at Hardstoft, Derbyshire. The oil is of good quality,
resembling Pennsylvanian crude. In 1928 the production amounted
to 78 tons.
Oil shale beds are worked in Scotland in the upper part of the
Calciferous Sandstone strata. The shale is distilled in retorts of
special design, and the valuable by-product ammonium sulphate is
obtained from the nitrogen (approximately 0.7 per cent.) contained
in the oil shale —the yield averaging about 32 lbs. per ton of shale.
The crude shale oil, the yield of which is about 25 gallons per ton
of shale, is similar in composition to natural petroleum. It is
refined and produces naphthas, burning oils, gas oils and lubricating
oils.
In 1928, the output of oil shale amounted to 2,038,114 tons from
15 mines in Midlothian and East Lothian. The shale oil output is
estimated at about 170,000 tons, and the ammonium sulphate by-
product at 36,000 tons.
Extensive deposits of oil shale occur in England, interstratified
with Kimmeridge clay (Jurassic), especially in Dorsetshire and
Norfolk. Various attempts have been made to work the shale
deposits of these counties. Unfortunately, the crude oil obtained
therefrom by distillation is high in sulphur, and no economic
method of eliminating this has yet been devised.
Iron ore. —The iron ores of Great Britain include non-phosphoric
haematite, averaging about 53 per cent, of metal, and phosphoric
iron ore, averaging less than 30 per cent, of metal. The latter
ore is usually subdivided into Jufassic ironstones obtained from the
Lower and Middle Lias and Inferior Oolite, averaging 27 per cent.


of metal and Carboniferous or Coal Measures ironstone (blackband
and clay ironstone), averaging about 30 per cent, of metal.
About nine-tenths of the total output of iron ores in Great Britain
is phosphoric ore, mainly Jurassic. These ores are, as a rule,
easily extracted by quarrying, but at Cleveland, Yorkshire, the
ironstone (carbonate), which is the most important industrially, is
worked by underground mining. Jurassic ores are also worked in
Northamptonshire and in Lincolnshire.
The Carboniferous ores are worked exclusively for iron in North
Staffordshire, but in South Staffordshire, Worcestershire, Shrop-
shire, Warwickshire and in a few counties in Scotland they are
raised with the coal.
Haematite occurs in Cumberland and Lancashire and constitutes
the only true Bessemer ore in Great Britain, as it is very low in
phosphorus.
The production of iron ore in Great Britain has increased with
that of coal. The production in 1913 amounted to about 16 million
tons. Since then it has varied from rather less than 3J million tons
in 1921 (a year of strikes) to 15 million tons in 1917 and 1918.
In 1928, the production amounted to 11,262,323 tons and in 1929
to 13,214,943 tons, the highest output for the last ten years.
It will be seen from these figures that the output of iron ore in
1929 was about two million tons more than in 1928, but it was
2J millions less than in 1913. About 30 per cent, of the iron ore
consumed in Great Britain is imported from Spain, North Africa
and Scandinavia, and consists chiefly of haematite, low in
phosphorus. The imports retained for consumption amounted to
4.440.000 tons in 1928, and 5,689,000 tons in 1929 (compared with
7.441.000 tons in 1913).
Tin ore. —The United Kingdom at present occupies the seventh
place in the list of the world’s producers of tin ore, and the third
place among the British Empire producers.
The production of dressed tin ore, which is almost entirely
Cornish, has decreased considerably in recent years from 8,355 tons
of concentrates in 1913 to 4,844 tons in 1928. In 1929, the output
of concentrates amounted to 5,649 tons, owing to the re-opening of
several of the old mines, which have since Had to close down again
as a result of the fall in the price of the metal.
Dolcoath mine has been the principal producer of tin ore for the
last 65 years, and other important mines have been in operation for
over 50 years, all of which are in the Camborne-Eedruth area, these
accounting altogether for about 95 per cent, of the Cornish pro-
duction.
Copper ore occurred in the Dolcoath and other mines down to a
depth of from 600 to 1,000 feet, but this ore has long since been
worked out.


Lead ore. —The total output of dressed lead ore in the United
Kingdom, from 1856 to 1916 inclusive, amounted to 3,514,549 tons,
the metal content being 2,590,845 tons. Since 1871, there has
been a steady decline in production. In 1856 it amounted to about
102,000 tons, while in 1927 and 1928 it only reached 20,428 and
18,771 tons respectively. In 1929 it rose to 23,260 tons, largely
due to a considerable increase in production in Derbyshire and
Dumfriesshire. The output at the present time is obtained chiefly
from the North of England.
Zinc ore. —From 1856 to 1928 inclusive, the United Kingdom
produced 1,235,129 tons of dressed zinc ore. The average annual
output up to 1913 amounted to about 20,000 tons, but since then
there has been a large drop in production. The average yearly
output from 1913 to 1920 amounted to 10,000 tons, and from 1921
to 1926 to about 2,000 tons. In 1928 and 1929, 1,553 and 1,811
tons respectively of dressed zinc ore were produced.
Manganese ore. Manganese ores, chiefly pyrolusite and
rhodonite, were formerly worked in the west of England.
Beds of carbonate of manganese (rhodochrosite), with some
silicate (rhodonite), occur near Barmouth, Merionethshire, and in
the Lleyn Peninsula, Carnarvonshire. The Merionethshire deposits
yielded an annual output of about 10,000 tons for some years. The
ore carries about 30 per cent, of metal, and is sold to glass works at
St. Helens, Lancashire.
In 1928, 235 tons of manganese ore were raised, chiefly from
Merioneth; in 1929, none.
The reserves are large, but the ore is low in grade and high in
phosphorus, and therefore cannot compete with the richer and
purer ores from overseas.
Copper ore. —There was formerly a large production of copper
ore in the United Kingdom, principally from Cornwall and Devon,
Mottram St. Andrews and Alderley Edge, Cheshire, the Ecton
mine, Staffordshire, the Drws-y-Coed mine, Carnarvonshire, and
the Parys Mountain and Mona mines, Anglesey.
At one time the United Kingdom supplied three-quarters of the
copper output of the world. In 1854, Cornwall alone produced
184,858 tons of copper ore, since when there has been a more or
less continuous decline. The whole copper ore output of the
United Kingdom amounted to only 18,205 tons in 1886, while
in recent years there has been no recorded production of copper
ore as such.
Some copper precipitate has for years been obtained by placing-
scrap iron in the water issuing from certain mines and open works.
In 1929, 104 tons of copper precipitate (metal content 68 tons) were
so obtained.


Gold. —The Ogofau or Gogofau mine at Pumpsant, Carmarthen-
shire, was worked by the Romans for gold.
The Clogau mine, in the Dolgelly district, Merionethshire, North
Wales, was worked at intervals for two centuries, and is estimated
to have yielded gold to the value of over one million sterling. The
Mawddach mines, in the same district, worked in the last cen-
tury, have yielded £300,000 worth of gold.
In 1920, 35 ounces of fine gold were produced in Merioneth-
shire. There was no production of gold from 1921 to 1927, but
in 1928, 119 ounces (fine) were produced from 160 tons of concen-
trate in Merioneth, and in 1929, 12 oz. from 70 tons.
China Clay and China Stone. —The United Kingdom is by far
the most important source in the world of china clay or kaolin,
the annual average production of which for a number of years
has been 800,000 tons, 90 per cent, of this being derived from,
Cornwall, and the remainder from the western part of Devon-
shire.
Of the average annual production of 800,000 tons, it has been
computed that 450,000 tons are used in the paper industry, 250,000
tons in pottery, 50,000 tons in textiles, and the remaining 50,000
tons in other industries. The apparent domestic consumption is
about 200,000 tons, the remaining 600,000 tons being exported
principally to the United States, but also to British India (the
chief Empire consumer), and many other countries.
The “ mica ” or mica-clay by-product is used in the manu-
facture of coarse pottery, brown paper, alum cake, etc. The
output of this product in 1929 amounted to 35,124 tons.
China stone, which is a variety of granite rich in fluorine
minerals and low in iron content, is raised entirely in Cornwall,
and is largely used as a raw material in pottery manufacture. The
output in 1929 amounted to 64,558 tons.
Salt. —Salt in the United Kingdom occurs as beds of rock-salt
in rocks of Triassic age. The principal production, however, is
from brine obtained by sinking wells (brine wells) to the various
beds of rock-salt, the amount obtained by mining the solid rock
being comparatively very small.
The chief producing county is Cheshire, other counties con-
tributing to the output being Durham, Yorkshire, Lancashire,
Staffordshire, Worcestershire, and the Isle of Man.
There are ample reserves in this country to supply the demand
for an indefinite period.
Barytes and Witherite. —The annual average production of
barytes and witherite in the United Kingdom amounts to 50,000
tons and upwards. The principal producer of barytes at present
is the Gasswater mine, in Ayrshire, Scotland, the output of which

in 1929 amounted to 19,618 tons. Other large mines are worked
in Shropshire, Northumberland (witherite), Devonshire, and
Derbyshire.
Fluorspar. —England is an important producer of fluorspar,
which is often associated with lead and zinc minerals in vein
deposits, and occurs abundantly in Durham, Derbyshire and York-
shire, from which counties the output is at present obtained. In
the form of “ lump spar ” and “ gravel spar ” it is used exten-
sively as a flux in the iron and steel industry, and in smaller
amounts it has various other uses. A considerable proportion of
the English production is exported.
Bauxite. —'Bauxite occurs in the inter-basaltic rocks of north-
eastern Ireland, chiefly in Co. Antrim.
The output in Co. Antrim from 1915 to 1928, inclusive,
was about 100,000 tons, and from 1915 to 1920, the average annual
output was upwards of 11,000 tons, but from 1921 to 1928 it fell
to a little over 4,000 tons. In 1926, the production was not re-
corded, as it came only from one mine. In 1927 and 1928 the
output amounted to 5.309 and 2,285 tons, respectively; in 1929,
2,322 tons. No bauxite mines were worked continuously during
1928, and the Tuftarney mine, which had been the chief producer,
was abandoned at the end of that year.
The Irish bauxite is high in silica, and has been used for the
manufacture of alum, in making refractory bricks, and, mixed
with chalk, for making rapid-hardening cement.
Australia.
As has been the case with other new countries of the world,
the development of Australia was given a great impetus by im-
portant discoveries of gold, which were made in the middle of the
last century. A constant stream of immigration followed, and
the population has increased from less than one-quarter of a million
at that time to about 6J million at the present time. Even at
present the population only averages 2J to the square mile.
The values of mineral outputs in the various States of the
Commonwealth during 1928 were as follows :

, In recent years there has been a steady reduction in mineral
output. Formerly, gold was the chief mineral produced, but the
decline in its production has to some extent been balanced by an
increase in coal production, which corresponds to a growth of in-
dustrialism in the Commonwealth.
Recently, a serious attempt has been made to discover fresh
sources of mineral supplies, and both ordinary and geophysical
methods of prospecting have been encouraged, the former by State
grants and the latter by joint contributions from the Empire
Marketing Board and the Commonwealth Government.
The Commonwealth Government has also given assistance in
oil prospecting in New South Wales, Western Australia and
Queensland, and different States have offered bonuses for the com-
mercial production of petroleum.
In the marketing of her mineral output, Australia is handi-
capped by her distance from the chief centres of world consump-
tion, with the resulting high cost of freight, so that with the
exception of coal and iron ore, a limited amount of each of which
is exported, mineral products must be sent away in a dressed or
concentrated form, or as smelted products.
The chief minerals and metals, etc., produced in the Common-
wealth arc as shown in the following table. They are arranged

Goal. —Coal is produced in all the Australian States except North,
Central and South Australia. In Victoria immense bodies of
brown coal are being worked, about £200,000 per annum being
the value of the present output. For the year 1928 the value of
the coal output was £10,695,530, which is about times the
value of the gold output for the same year. The value of the
output for 1929 dropped to £8,676,324.
The brown coal deposits of Victoria, referred to above, are
estimated to contain 10,373 million tons of coal, of which the
Morwell deposits contain 5,000 million tons. In the Latrobe
Valley, the Beds are over 800 feet thick.
In 1918, the Electricity Commissioners began, on a large scale,
the development of an open-cut mine at Morwell, and in 1924 the
first unit of a power station at Yallourn, to use the brown coal,
was put into commission, and has since been delivering electric
power to a large area in Victoria and to places in the south of
New South Wales. Already nearly 4,000 miles of cable have been
laid down.
Coal production in Australia has been restricted recently by
severe industrial trouble in New South Wales, which has resulted
in increased costs and interfered with an important export trade,
the value of the output in New South Wales during 1929 being
only £5.952,720 as compared with £8,263,729 in 1928. As a result
of this Tasmania has turned her attention to her own coal deposits,
while South Australia has found it cheaper to import coal from
Newcastle, England, than to buy from New South Wales.


According to recent estimates, the Commonwealth reserves of
coal amount altogether to 16,451 million tons of black coal and
42,624 million tons of sub-bituminous and brown coal.
Lead and Silver ores. —Almost the whole of the lead and silver
produced in Australia comes from the Broken Hill mines in New
South Wales and the Eead-Hercules mines in Tasmania. Else-
where silver is mainly associated wdth lead ores, or is produced as
a by-product of gold refining in Victoria. Small outputs of silver-
lead or© are being obtained from Queensland, (South Australia and
Western Australia.
Gold. —All the States of the Commonwealth are producers of
gold, the chief of them being Western Australia, Victoria and
Queensland. Output was at a maximum in 1903 when Australia
was the world’s chief producer of gold, Western Australia being
considerably ahead of the other States. Since then there has been
a steady decline of output chiefly on account of the high cost of
production.
Among recent gold-mining developments that have become
prominent in Australia, mention may be made of (1) the Wiluna
mine in Western Australia, the largest in the Commonwealth,
where there are already million tons of 7J to 10 dwt. ore
developed; and (2) a large auriferous area at Tanami in North
Australia, 350 miles N.W. from the rail-head at Alice Springs in
Central Australia, which is about to be developed.
Of the total output of 457,683 oz. of fine gold in Australia
during 1928, 393,408 oz., or about 86 per cent, of the total,
was from Western Australia. The remainder was mostly from
Victoria (7 per cent.), Queensland (3 per cent.), and New 7 South
Wales (3 per cent.).
The 1929 output of gold in Australia amounted to 427,074 oz.
valued at £1,816,303.
Zinc ore. —The total ore-reserves at Broken Hill, New South
Wales, now consist of 12J' million tons containing 11 to 17 per cent,
lead, 10 to 16 per cent, zinc, and about 7 ounces of silver per
ton. Until about 1906 only lead-silver concentrates were treated,
lead-zinc tailings being put aside until a suitable process could
be devised for treating them. In the period 1902-1909, various
flotation processes, the forerunners of those in use at the present
time, were devised at Broken Hill, and since then zinc concentrate,
more or less free from lead, has been regularly produced there.
Treatment of the silver-lead concentrates is effected at the Port
Pirie smelter in South Australia, and most of the zinc concentrate
is treated electrolytically for the production of metallic zinc at
Eisdon, Tasmania. The cadmium content of these concentrates is
also recovered there, the value of the output of cadmium for 1929
being £89,182.


Almost the whole Australian output of zinc comes from the
Broken Hill mines, but a small amount is recovered from the Mt.
Read and Rosebery mines in Tasmania, the zinc being produced
at the Risdon plant, about .£'Boo,ooo worth of zinc having been
recovered to the end of 1928. The ores also yield lead and silver
with a little gold.
In New South Wales, the Old Lake George mines, containing
nearly 1J million tons of proved, probable and prospective ore
containing 13 per cent, zinc and 7.5 per cent, lead, with silver,
copper and gold, have been re-opened.
A number of zinc-lead occurrences are known in Western
Australia, South Australia and Queensland, and small productions
have been made in the past; in Queensland, however, the
Mount Isa mines in the Cloncurry district, discovered in 1923,
have been found by diamond drilling to contain, in four ore-bodies,
over 24 million tons of ore, about half of w T hich contains on the
average about 6 per cent, lead, 8 per cent, zinc and 37 oz. of
silver per ton. A plant to treat 2,000 tons of lead ore a day
is being completed, and treatment of zinc concentrate will follow
later.
Iron ore. —Deposits of iron ore have long been known and are
widely distributed over Australia, but, owing to their situation,
few of them have been developed. The chief producing States are
New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia. Iron
and steel are only produced in New South Wales by two companies.
The Iron Knob and Iron Monarch deposits of South Australia
contain 133 million tons of 63 per cent. ore. Other deposits along
the Middlebank Range are reported to contain 32 million tons of
slightly higher grade ore. South Australian ore has recently been
shipped to Europe.
The immense deposits of ore of about 60 per cent, grade on
Koolan Island in Yampi Sound, N.W. Australia, are out of reach
of Western markets, but recently a 12-| year contract was arranged
with Japanese interests for deliveries of ore over that period at
9s. per ton, f.0.b., beginning with half a million tons and increas-
ing up to a million tons per annum.
The production of iron and steel products from home materials
in Australia is encouraged by bounties, and up to £250.000 per
annum is allocated for this purpose. Iron and steel productions are
confined to New South Wales, where at Lithgow there is an annual
output of 100,000 tons of pig iron, while at Newcastle there is an
output of 400,000 tons each of pig iron and ingot steel from ore
derived from the Iron Knob deposit in South Australia.
The output of iron ore in Australia during 1929 amounted to
852,960 tons.
Tin ore. —With the exception of South Australia, tin ore is pro-
duced in all the States of the Commonwealth, on the mainland

mainly by dredging, hydraulicking and dry-blowing, and in Tas-
mania mainly by lode-mining. The tin ore outputs (metal con-
tent) of the various producing States during 1928 were as follows :
The metal content of the tin ore produced in 1929 amounted to
2,239 tons valued at £457,022.
Copper ore. —Ores of copper have been mined in every part of
Australia, but at present, as with other metal mines, owing to low
market prices and high working costs, the majority of copper mines
have had to close down. Except in Queensland and Tasmania,
the industry of copper mining has almost ceased.
Of the total value of the output for 1928 of £639,428, Queens-
land supplied £177,043 and Tasmania, £444,802. In Queensland,
the producing mines are in the Cloncurry district which hitherto
has proved the most prolific area in Australia, while in Tasmania
the Mount Lyell mine is the chief producer.
In 1929, the output of copper ore, in terms of metal content,
increased to 12,812 tons.
Platinum metals. —The osmiridium output in Tasmania during
1929 amounted to 1,360' oz. valued at £30,624, compared with a
value of £42,458 in 1928. The output of platinum in New South
Wales during 1929 amounted to 128 oz. valued at £1,352, compared
with a value of £4,544 in 1928. •
Other metallic minerals. —The value of the metallic minerals,
other than those already mentioned, produced in Australia in 1928,
amounted to £26,143. They included ores of antimony, bismuth,
arsenic, cobalt, copper-nickel and manganese; molybdenite;
tantalite and wolframite. The chief of these were : —wolframite,
mainly from Tasmania, valued at £13,043; antimony ore, at
£3,717; mainly from New South Wales; and tantalite, at £2,943,
from Western Australia and North Australia. Australia is the
chief producer of the last-mentioned ore, which is exported to the
United States for the production of tantalum metal.
Non-metallic minerals. —Non-metallic minerals other than coal,
clays and building materials to the aggregate recorded value of
£467,054 were produced in the Commonwealth in 1928, and
included asbestos, barytes, diatomaceous earth, fluorspar, gem-
stones, gypsum, kaolin, magnesite, mica, oil shale, salt, soapstone
and talc. Other than salt and gypsum, the values of which have

already been given, the more important values included gem-
stones (£31,039), magnesite (£14,368), mica (£10,548), barytes
(£7,138) and fluorspar (£4,562).,
Gypsum is produced in New South Wales, Victoria, Western
Australia, and South Australia, and is used for the production of
building material and in agriculture. The South Australian
industry is well-equipped for gypsum production on a large scale.
The magnesite was almost all produced in New South Wales, but
there are unworked deposits in other States.
The production of gemstones consisted chiefly of precious opal,
valued at £23,140 from New South Wales, South Australia and
Queensland, the remainder being made up mainly of sapphires from
Queensland and New South Wales, and emeralds from Western
Australia.
Deposits of radium minerals occur in South Australia at Radium
Hill, Olary, and at Mount Painter in the Northern Flinders Ranges.
Canada.
The mining industry of Canada has made rapid progress since
the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the fact that
the value of the mineral output in 1928 was nearly six times that
for 1899.
The following table gives the values of the outputs of the different
provinces for 1928 ;
Rapid and extensive as its mining development has been for
many years past, however, Canada has still large areas that await
examination by the prospector. Until recently, prospecting of the
northern regions has been carried out only slowly and to a very
limited extent by individual prospectors travelling on foot or in
canoes, and then only in the summer. In the last few years the
use of aeroplanes for this work has proved of great value; already
about six exploration companies are using them extensively all the
year round to take men and stores rapidly from base to base and
to keep up communications with headquarters. The Department

of Civil Aviation estimated that in 1928, 630,000 miles were covered
in this way without casualties or loss of supplies, so far as was
known.
The various geophysical methods for prospecting have lately been
increasingly used, especially in the Eouyn district of Quebec.
Mineral development is also being greatly assisted by railway con-
struction. Two recent extensions, the Hudson Bay Eailway,
designed primarily for the transport of wheat, and the extension
of t(he Temiskaming and Northern Ontario' Eailway from Cochrane
to James Bay, have tapped valuable mineral country.
Canada is fortunate in possessing abundant water-power resources,
which are employed extensively in the mining and other industries.
In fact, with few exceptions, the mines could not be worked with-
out the cheap hydro-electric power available. Already turbines
generating 5,700,000 H.P., representing 28 per cent, of the mini-
mum steady flow throughout the year, have been installed, of which
Quebec possesses 2,570,000, Ontario 1,960,000 and British
Columbia 560,000 H.P.
The chief minerals produced in the Dominion are as shown in
the following table. They are arranged in the order of value as
regards output during the year 1928, and represent about 98 per
cent, of the value of the total mineral production :

Coal. —Next to those of the United States and China, the coal
reserves of Canada are the largest in the world, and amount to
nearly million million tons. The coals are of all classes, ranging
from anthracite to lignite. Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British
Columbia, and Yukon Territory produce bituminous coal only;
Saskatchewan, lignite; and Alberta, bituminous, sub-bituminous
and lignite coals. It will be seen that the more populous and
industrial provinces, Ontario and Quebec, are far from the coal
supplies on the east and west, which are about 2,000 miles apart,
so that these provinces are largely dependent on the more accessible
supplies of coal in the United States. Conversely, some of the coal
produced in Alberta and Saskatchewan is sold in neighbouring
United States markets.
The order of importance of the different provinces as regards the
tonnage of their coal production during 1929 was as follows ;
Alberta, Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Saskatchewan,
New Brunswick and Yukon.
Recent developments include the examination, by the Ontario
Department of Mines, of the Onakawana lignite deposit on the
Cochrane-James Bay Railway, which was found to cover two
square miles and to contain 40,000,000 tons of lignite of similar
quality to that mined in Southern Saskatchewan. A plant for
distilling Souris Valley lignites and briquetting the coke produced
is at work in Saskatchewan. In Alberta, new deposits of lignite
have been opened up at Willow Creek and at Wallace. In Ontario,
at Port Stanley a $3,000,000 coking plant is to be erected.
A large number of coal deposits in Alberta, British Columbia
and Yukon remain undeveloped as commercial conditions do not
warrant their exploitation.
Gold.- —At the present time Canada is the third largest gold pro-
ducer in the world, but it seems not unlikely that before long the
United States will yield the second position to her. All the
9043 B 3


provinces, excepting New Brunswick and Saskatchewan, are gold
producers, Ontario producing over 84 per cent, of the 1929 total of
1,928,308 oz., British Columbia 8 per cent., Quebec 4J per cent.,
and Yukon 2 per cent. The quartzose ores of Kirkland Lake and
Porcupine are the main source of Ontario’s supply. In British
Columbia, although a small proportion of the output is derived
from alluvial and quartzose ores, the main part is recovered as a
by-product in the treatment of complex sulphide ores. Much of
the production of Quebec comes from rich gold-copper sulphide
ores, while in the Yukon the small output is mostly recovered by
three dredging companies, but promising lode deposits are known.
Gold-mining in Nova Scotia began in 1860, but most of the mines
closed down some time ago, almost all for want of capital and
before modern methods of treatment were known. Bene wed
attention is now being given to these mines. The Nova Scotian
gold belt extends for 275 miles along the Atlantic coast, and the
gold-bearing rocks of the province cover an area of 6,000 square
miles.
Copper. —Canada is the fourth in order of importance as a world
producer of copper, and is the largest Empire producer. One-half
of the production comes from British Columbia, one-third from
Ontario and one-sixth from Quebec.
Most of the British Columbia output of copper is derived from
low-grade copper-pyrites ores, while that of Ontario is obtained
from the nickel-copper sulphide ores of the Sudbury district.
Developments recently carried out at the Frood and the Frood Ex-
tension mines have added considerably to the copper and nickel
reserves of the Sudbury region. The new mill will have a daily
capacity of 8,000 tons and the new smelter 5,000 tons of ore or
concentrates.
The copper smelter of the Noranda Mines in Western Quebec
started operations in 1927, and is now treating about 1,800 tons of
ore per day mainly from the Horne copper mine, averaging about
7 per cent, of copper and $3.68 gold per ton. A copper refinery is
being built in Montreal East.
Arrangements for copper refining are also being made at Copper
Cliff, Ontario, and the Flin Flon Mines, Manitoba.
The chalcopyrite-blende ores of Western Quebec are referred to
under “ lead and zinc below.
A discovery of copper ore has recently been made near Lake
Opomiske, 40 miles west of Lake Chibougamau, Quebec.
In 1929, the output of copper ore (metal content) amounted to
110,768 long tons, valued at T 8,872,069; and the preliminary out-
put figures of 134,386 tons for 1930 show an increase of 21.3 per
cent, over the output for 1929.
Nickel. —Canada produces over 90 per cent, of the world’s output
of nickel, which is obtained almost entirely from the nickel-copper


sulphide ores of the Sudbury district, Ontario. A small amount of
nickel is also obtained as a by-product from the silver-cobalt-nickel
ores of the Cobalt district.
The Sudbury ore averages about 3 per cent, nickel and 2 per
cent, copper. At the Creighton mine the nickel content is about
6 per cent. In the lower levels of the Frood deposit, diamond-
drill holes have disclosed ore containing about the average amount
of nickel, together with 20 per cent, of copper. The proved ore
reserves below the 1,400-foot level of the Frood mines amounts to
134,673,000 tons, of which 43,562,000 tons consist of high-grade
ore.
The average grade of the total reserves is 2.39 per cent, of nickel
and 3.62 per cent, of copper. Over 10,000,000 tons of high-grade
ore were added to the Frood reserves as a result of development in
the lower levels completed in 1929. Recent work in the 2,800-foot
level shows much greater width, and evidence of extension along
the strike.
The concentrator, originally planned to treat 4,000 tons of ore
per day, is being enlarged to treat 8,000 tons. The first unit of
the electrolytic plant at Port Colborne came into operation in 1926;
five new units have been added since, and a sixth unit will be
erected in the near future. The completed new plant will have an
annual capacity of 43,200 tons of electrolytic nickel, 18,000 tons of
nickel contained in oxides and salts, and 60,000 tons of blister
copper.
At the Falconbridge nickel mine, 1,367,000 tons of ore are now
developed, and a 250-ton smelter is probably now in operation.
Matte will be produced and sent to Eristiansund, Norway, for
treatment.
In 1929, Canada produced 49,230 tons of nickel, valued at
£5,541,680.
Cement. —The Portland cement industry of Canada began in
1889. The largest production is in Quebec and Ontario, there
being smaller outputs in Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia.
In 1929, there was a production of 12,252,203 barrels and sales of
12,284,081 barrels, valued at £3,952,430.
Lead and Zinc. —Nearly all the lead and zinc produced in Canada
in 1929 came from the Sullivan mine, near Kimberley, British
Columbia, the lead concentrates being treated at Tadanac, 8.C..
and the zinc concentrates in the electrolytic zinc plant at the same
locality. The mine has been worked to a depth of 1,500 ft. on the
dip of the vein. About 6,000 tons of ore are concentrated daily by
differential flotation.
Several independent companies are producing zinc concentrates
at Sandon, Zincton, Silverton and a few other districts in British
Columbia. These concentrates are shipped to Trail (Tadanac) for
9043 B 4


further treatment. Lead-zinc ore of good grade is being mined at
the old Monarch mines, near Field, British Columbia, where there
is a 300-ton mill, and the concentrate is being shipped to the
United States.
Among important developments may be mentioned the Eeeves-
McDonald mine at the Pend d’Oreille Eiver, and the Ferguson
mine, near Ingenika Eiver. Development is taking place on the
Flin Flon copper-zinc deposit, near the Flin Flon lake, Manitoba.
A large concentrator and a copper smelter are being erected, and
later there will be an electrolytic zinc plant. About 36,000 h.p.
to run these will be developed from Island Falls, on the Churchill
river. Underground development and diamond drilling indicate
18.000. tons of sulphides, averaging 1.71 per cent, of copper,
3.45 per cent, of zinc, with a little gold and silver. A large
property at Cold Lake, about 36 miles N.E. of Flin Flon, is being
developed. The available reserves are estimated at upwards of
6.000. tons, averaging 2.75 per cent, of copper, 3.39 per cent,
of zinc, with a little gold and silver.
Several other zinc-lead, and copper-zinc deposits are being
developed in Manitoba, while other developments of copper-lead-
zinc properties are being undertaken in New Brunswick, North-
West Territories (on the south shore of Great Slave Lake,
Mackenzie), and Nova Scotia (Stirling, Eichmond County).
In the Sudbury Basin, Ontario, the Errington zinc-lead-copper
mine is being developed. About one million tons of ore are indi-
cated, averaging 6.74 per cent, of zinc, 1.33 per cent, of lead and
1.33 per cent, of copper, and a little gold and silver. The two
principal shafts are 650 ft. in depth. There is a selective flotation
plant, with a daily capacity of 300 tons, and lead and zinc concen-
trates are being produced. Galena is produced at the Galetta mine
in Carleton County, Ontario.
The Tetreault mine, Portneuf County, near Notre Dame des
Anges was, up to the end of 1920, when the mine was closed down,
the only producing lead and zinc mine in Quebec. The daily out-
put was about 500 tons of ore, averaging 9 per cent, of zinc and
3 per cent, of lead. In 1929, the production of zinc amounted to
8,774 tons.
Several zinc-lead properties are also being developed in Lemieux
township, Gaspe County, Quebec. The ore averages 7.9 per cent,
of zinc and 3.8 per cent, of lead. A mill is to be erected.
In the Horne copper mine there is a deposit of disseminated
blende, containing 10 per cent, of zinc. On the Amulet mine,
Dufresnoy township, diamond drilling indicates about 500,000 tons
of ore averaging 2.86 per cent, of copper, and 10.65 per cent, of
zinc. Several other important deposits of copper-zinc ore are being
prospected and developed in North-West Quebec, e.g., in the
Eouyn, Duprat, Boischatel and Desmeloizes townships.


Large deposits of copper and zinc are being prospected and
explored in Saskatchewan, while in the Yukon Territory, the
Wernecke silver-lead-zinc claims on Keno Hill, Mayo district, are
being developed.
Hence in the near future, Canada is likely to show a greatly
increased output of lead and zinc. It is reported that two zinc
refineries will be erected in Eastern Canada, in order to treat the
concentrates from the Sherritt-Gordon, Errington, Noranda,
Amulet and other mines.
In 1929, the output of zinc ore (metal content) amounted to
138,298 tons, valued at £2,171,833 and the corresponding output
of lead ore amounted to 145,769 tons, valued at £3,381,207.
In 1928, cadmium was first produced as a by-product at the
Electrolytic Zinc Works at Tadanac (Trail). In 1928 and 1929,
the production amounted to 491,894 and 773,976 lb. respectively.
The 1929 output was valued at £142,362.
Silver. —With an output of 23,143,261 oz. in 1929, Canada is the
largest producer of silver in the Empire. The chief producing
provinces, namely, British Columbia, Ontario, Yukon and Quebec,
contribute approximately 44, 39, 14 and 3 per cent, respectively,
but a small amount was also obtained from Manitoba and Nova
Scotia. As a result of the discovery recently of lead-silver deposits
in the Mayo district of Yukon, Canada’s 1930 output is likely to
be a record.
Of the British Columbia output, one-half came from the Sullivan
lead-zinc mine at Kimberley and a quarter from the auriferous
pyrites of the Premier mine in the Portland Canal district. The
balance came from silver, copper and lead-zinc ores. In Ontario
85 per cent, of the output was from cobalt-nickel-silver ores of
Cobalt, Gowganda and South Lorraine. Yukon’s output came
mainly from argentiferous lead ores in the Mayo district. About
two-thirds of Quebec’s production came from the Tetreault lead-
zinc mine, now closed down.
Sources of gold-silver ores and silver ores proper are decreasing
in importance; while silver-lead, silver-copper, silver-lead-zinc, and
silver-zinc ores are increasing in importance, so that silver produc-
tion is becoming dependent on the output of base metal ores, but
not in proportion to their output, since the proportion of silver
in the ores mined decreases with depth.
Asbestos. —Chrysotile, the serpentine variety of asbestos, has
been mined without a break in Quebec since 1879, and Canada has
been for many years the largest producer of asbestos in the world.
In 1929, the output was 277,861 long tons, the sales, which
amounted to 273,263 long tons, being valued at £2,692,128. This
represents in amount 70 per cent, of the world’s output; but it
should be noted that 90 per cent, of this is of non-spinning grades,
which, on account of the proximity of a large market in the United


States, have no heavy transport charges to pay and can be readily
marketed.
The Quebec asbestos belt, which lies in the Eastern Townships,
is over 100 miles long, production at present being confined to the
areas around Thetford and Danville. Other chrysotile deposits are
known in Ontario and British Columbia, but there has been no
production from them.
Petroleum and Natural Gas. —The first productive oil well in
the American Continent was one near Oil Springs, Ontario, from
which crude petroleum was produced in 1857. Since then
petroleum and natural gas have been continuously produced in
Canada, the producing provinces in order of importance at the
present time being Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick.
Several fields in Western Ontario are still producing, although
the petroleum output has been decreasing for some years. The
output of the Turner Valley field, Alberta, has, on the contrary,
shown a rapid increase in recent years. At the end of 1929, there
were 35 producing wells in the field, the combined monthly out-
puts being about 90,000 barrels of crude oil. Turner Valley is a
wet-gas field, but by means of absorption plants a good quality
of naphtha (gasoline) is obtained from the wet gas. In 1929, the
Turner Valley production amounted to 981,221 barrels of naphtha
and light crude, and is increasing.
The Wainwright field in 1929 produced 12,332 barrels of heavy
crude from three wells, and the Bed Coulee field is a promising
new field, with five producing wells, which in 1929 produced
1,328 barrels of light crude.
In 1929, Canada produced 28,378,462 thousand cubic feet of
natural gas and 1,120,692 barrels of petroleum, the outputs of both
of these having shown a rapid increase in recent years.
Gypsum. —As a producer of gypsum Canada holds third place
in the world, the 1929 output being 1,081,592 long tons valued
at £740,243. The deposits of Nova Scotia, which are close to
tidewater and can be cheaply exported, yielded over three-quarters
of this total. The other producing provinces were British Columbia,
Ontario, Manitoba, and New Brunswick, and there are large un-
worked deposits known in various other parts of Canada.
In Northern Alberta the large deposit of gypsum between Little
Rapids and Peace Point, which was surveyed by the Dominion
Bureau of Mines in 1916 and later re-surveyed by the Provincial
Geological survey, contains 217 million tons of good quality gypsum.
The manufacture of building products from gypsum is an im-
portant industry of Canada.
Cobalt.— Practically all the cobalt produced in Canada is a by-
product of the silver-mining industry, and is obtained by treating
arsenical silver-cobalt-nickel residues from the Cobalt, South
Lorrain and Gowganda silver camps in Ontario. A considerable


tonnage of residues is shipped to Germany for treatment. A
certain amount of high-grade cobalt ore, however, is smelted in
Canada.
Canada still supplies practically half the world’s requirements of
cobalt; the remainder coming chiefly from the Belgian Congo.
In 1929, the estimated production of cobalt in Canada was
929,415 lb., valued at £368,264.
Platinum Metals. —Neglecting a few ounces of platinum extracted
from black sands, and that recovered from gold-refinery precipitate
at Trail, British Columbia, all the platinum metals produced in
Canada were obtained by the treatment of nickel-copper matte
produced from Sudbury ores. In 1929, the output amounted to
12,839 oz. of platinum valued at £151,602 and 13,717 oz. of palla-
dium, rhodium, etc., valued at £63,375. This output is likely to
be largely increased in the near future with the coming into full
production of the Frood mine. Platiniferous residues from the
mattes will continue to be treated at the refinery at Acton, near
London, England, and to cope with the anticipated extra load
this plant has been enlarged and modified, so that it is now the
largest and most efficient platinum refinery in the world.
Iron ore. —Although Canada is eleventh on the list of iron and
steel-producing countries of the world, producing about 1,000,000
tons of pig iron per annum, she uses no domestic ores. The three
iron-producing centres are at Sydney, Nova Scotia, and at Hamilton
and Sault Sainte Marie, Ontario. Almost the whole of the ore
used by the Sydney furnaces comes from Newfoundland, while
the United States supplies ore for the furnaces of Ontario.
Extensive deposits of high-grade iron ore are, however, reported
to occur on Belcher Islands. Deposits of potential importance occur
also in the Nastapoka Islands, Hudson Bay, and in other parts
of Canada.
Aluminium. —Bauxite has not been found in Canada, but
aluminium is being produced there on an increasingly large scale
from imported alumina. In future, bauxite from British Guiana
will be used. Already Canada is the second largest producer of
aluminium in the world. The works are situated near the new
township of Arvida, on the Saguenay Eiver. A power plant is
being built at Chute-a-Charon, which may ultimately have a
capacity from 800,000 to 1,000,000 H.P. The actual amount of
power developed ultimately will depend on the world’s demand for
aluminium.
Talc and Soapstone. —Deposits of talc and soapstone have been
worked in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. In
Canada the chief use of soapstone is in the form of blocks for
lining the soda-ash furnaces in the pulp mills; the soapstone was
formerly obtained entirely from Norway and the United States,


but attention being drawn to domestic supplies, demands were met
from Eagle Lake, Kenora, Ontario, and from Bobertsonville,
Megantic County, Quebec. Most of Canada’s talc comes from
Madoc, Hastings County, Ontario, the bulk of the production being
exported in a finely-ground form.
In 1929, outputs of 13,847 long tons of ground talc valued at
£37,037, and block soapstone valued at £9,807 were produced.
Felspar. —Deposits of the potash variety of felspar are common
in the pre-Cambrian areas of Canada, but production is confined
to Ontario and Quebec, the 1929 output being 33,506 long tons
valued at £69,583. The bulk of the output is sent to the United
States in a crude condition, but some of it is used in Canada
in a finely-ground form in the ceramic industry, and some in the
making of bottle glass.
Fluorspar. —Fluorspar occurs in Canada both as lump and gravel
spar. At present there are two producing localities, one near
Madoc, Ontario, and the other at Grand Forks, British Columbia.
The production in Ontario is small. The output of the Bock Candy
mine, near Grand Forks, British Columbia, is being shipped to
Trail for use as a flux in lead smelting.
The Canadian production of fluorspar in 1929 amounted to
15,955 long tons, valued at £9,763, and the whole of this appears
to have come from Grand Forks.
Sodium sulphate. —Natural sodium sulphate, or Glauber’s salt,
occurs in the form of saturated brines in many lakes of the prairie
provinces of western Canada. Production has hitherto been con-
fined to the province of Saskatchewan.
An important development is the opening up of Horseshoe Lake,
near Ormeston, Sask., where salt cake (anhydrous sodium sul-
phate) will be produced and sent to Copper Cliff, Ontario, to be
treated with sulphuric acid and thus converted into nitre cake
(sodium hydrogen sulphate), which will be used as a flux in the
refining of nickel.
Salt cake is also largely employed in the manufacture of sulphate
pulp in the paper industry. The imports of salt cake into Canada
during 1929 amounted to about 35,000 tons per annum, while the
imports of nitre cake in that year amounted to about 72,000 tons.
The production of sodium sulphate in Canada in 1929, amounted
to 5,886 long tons, valued at £14,387.
Other minerals. —Among other minerals, mention may be made
of molybdenum deposits near Amos, Abitibi County, Quebec. In
British Columbia also there are a number of molybdenite pro-
perties, one of which, at Alice Arm, east of Anyox, is now being
developed. Some development work was done in 1929 on
molybdenite-bearing veins in the Coquihalla area, near lago, on
the Kettle Valley Eailway.


The deposit of lithium minerals at Pointe-du-Bois 100 miles
N.E. of Winnipeg, Manitoba, reputed to be the largest of its kind
in the British Empire, is being investigated. Up to the present,
only a small production has been recorded.
A deposit of tin ore was recently found to the N.E. of
Winnipeg, Manitoba, and another occurrence has been investigated
at New Boss, Nova Scotia.
Bismuth is now being recovered at the Trail smelter from electro-
lytic residues, the 1929 output being 194,392 lb., valued at £45,031.
Magnesite is quarried in the Grenville district, Argenteuil County,
Quebec. The earthy variety of magnesite, hydromagnesite, occurs
in several parts of British Columbia.
Diatomaceous earth is produced at New Annan, Nova Scotia,
and at Quesnel, British Columbia. Production is expected in
1930 from deposits at Digby, Nova Scotia, and at Martin Siding,
Muskoka, Ontario, Other deposits are known in Canada.
Iron oxide pigments are produced near Three Rivers, Quebec.
Small productions are made in other places in Quebec and British
Columbia. A small amount of phosphate has been obtained for
some years in the form of apatite from the waste dumps of the
mica mines in Quebec and Ontario. Recently, arrangements have
been made to build a plant at Trail to manufacture triple super-
phosphate from the low-grade phosphate of the Crow’s Nest Pass
area; hence Canada’s production of phosphate is likely soon to be
increased.
Abrasive garnet was produced, prior to 1923, from a deposit
18 miles E. of Bancroft, Ontario. Examinations are in progress
of deposits at Labelle, Quebec, 100 miles N. of Montreal, and at,
other localities.
Grindstones and pulpstones are produced at New Bandon and
Quarryville, near Newcastle, in New Brunswick.
A number of deposits of corundum are known near Craigmount,
Ontario, but there has been no production since 1921.
Volcanic dust is worked near Swift Current, Saskatchewan.
Other deposits are known in British Columbia.
Bentonite, a clay-like substance with peculiar physical characters,
is found at several places in Canada, and is likely to prove of com-
mercial value. Kaolin (china clay) has been produced on a small
commercial scale at St. Remi d’Amherst, Quebec, and ball clay
is shipped from Readlyn and Willows, Southern Saskatchewan,
in a crude state to potteries in Ontario and the United States.
Other minerals that figure in the output returns of Canada for
1929 include white arsenic (1,651 long tons), barytes (94 long
tons), graphite (1,304 long tons), salt (294,789 long tons) and
ilmenite or titanium ore (2,190 long tons).

India.
India has a large and varied mineral production, most of which
is exported in the raw state. The principal manufacturing mineral
industries carried on in the country are the smelting of iron ore
and the manufacture of steel, the smelting of lead ore and copper
ore, the manufacture of Portland cement and the refining of
petroleum. In these industries India is able to make use of her
own supplies of coal, magnesite, bauxite and manganese ore, but
as yet only to a small extent.
The chief minerals and metals produced in India are shown
in the following table. They are arranged in the order of value
of output during the year 1928. It will be seen from this table
that, in 1928, about 80 per cent, of the total value of the mineral
production of India consisted of coal, petroleum, manganese ore,
.silver-lead and zinc ores, gold and building materials.

Coal. —Coal is by far the most important mineral produced in
India, the output in 1929 being nearly 23J million tons, which
exceeds the previous record production of 1919, but the value has
declined since that year considerably. India therefore occupies a
position next to the United Kingdom as an Empire coal-producing
country. About 180,000 persons are employed in the coalfields and
the coal is at present almost entirely consumed in the country.
In 1929 over 724,000 tons were exported (excluding bunkers)
chiefly to Ceylon, and about 205,000 tons were imported, mainly
from South Africa. The coal is principally obtained from the
Gondwana coalfields in Bihar and Orissa and Bengal, but the
distance of the fields from the port of Bombay is great. There are
other Gondwana coalfields in Hyderabad, the Central Provinces and
Central India, and Tertiary coalfields in Assam, Baluchistan,
Punjab and Rajputana. The known reserves are considerable, and
sufficient for a great many years, but there is not an adequate
supply of coal suitable for the production of metallurgical coke.
During the last few years India has had a Coal Grading Board,
which issues certificates of quality and has thereby improved the
status of Indian coal in Eastern markets.
Petroleum. —lndia is an important producer of petroleum, with
an output which exceeds a million tons, and represents about 0.7 per
cent, of the world’s production. Although the 1929 production of
1,200,110 tons is the highest recorded, it probably represents only
a temporary arrest of the decline which has set in, and which is
likely to continue unless a new field is found. The principal fields
are the Yenangyaung and Singu in Burma, where there are also
several other fields. The Attock field in the Punjab and the Digboi
and other fields in Assam also contributed to the output.


Manganese ore. —The output of manganese ore has been main-
tained at the level of about a million tons for some years, of which
more than 800,000 tons are exported. In 1929, the output was
994,279 tons and India is thus second to Russia as a world producer
of this mineral. The ore is obtained in hard lumps suitable for
blast-furnace use, and thus has an advantage over the Caucasian
ore, which is mainly soft. In 1928, both France and Belgium
took larger amounts from India than did the United Kingdom.
The Indian iron and steel industry used nearly 70,000 tons in
1928, not only for steel furnaces and making ferro-manganese, but
also in the manufacture of pig-iron. The ore is widely dis-
tributed in the Central Provinces, Madras, Bombay, Bihar and
Orissa and Mysore, but the Balaghat and Nagpur districts of the
Central Provinces are the chief contributors to the output. Large
reserves are available, but the future of the industry depends to a
large extent on its ability to face competition with Russia, where
the costs of production under existing conditions are very low.
Lead, Silver and Zinc ores.— Almost all the silver, lead and zinc
produced in India comes from the Bawdwin mine in the Southern
Shan States of Upper Burma, one of the largest deposits in the
world. The reserves at this mine were estimated in January, 1930,
at over 4 million tons of ore containing nearly 26 per cent, lead,
16 per cent, zinc and 21 oz. silver per ton. The mine is equipped
with a smelter and refinery capable of producing 7,000 tons of
refined lead and 700,000 oz. of refined silver a month. The lead
content of ore produced in 1929 exceeded 102,000 tons. The pig-
lead, bars, etc., produced from this are exported, rather more than
half going to the United Kingdom. About 7,300,000 oz. of silver
were extracted in 1929, which is approximately double the average
for the period 1919-1923; and the production of zinc concentrates
(containing about 50 per cent, of metal) was 58,435 tons, all of
which was exported, mainly to Belgium, but practically none to the
United Kingdom. The Bawdwin mine represents one of the most
important enterprises in the development of the mineral industry
of India, resulting in the creation of a modern industrial township
in the heart of the Shan Jungle only 40 miles from the frontier
of China.
Gold. —The only important goldfield in India is that of Kolar in
Mysore, but the depth of the workings is now very considerable,
and the difficulty of production consequently increasing, so that the
output is gradually but steadily decreasing. While the average pro-
duction for the period 1919-1923 amounted to over 460,000 oz.,
in 1929 it reached only 363,800 oz., but India still retains the eighth
position in the list of world producers.
Building Materials. —lndia possesses vast quantities of rocks suit-
able for use in building and ornamental stone-work, for the manu-
facture of lime, cement and other products used in building con-
struction, and for road-making. The output of these materials is


•only partially known owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
statistics for materials of such diverse types and widespread
occurrence. One of the most important of these products is lime-
stone, of which more than 3 million tons were produced in 1928,
mainly from Bihar and Orissa. The Portland cement industry
has grown very considerably in recent years. Laterite is widely
distributed throughout the Peninsula and Burma, and owing to its
property of hardening upon exposure, is largely used for building
purposes. In spite, however, of the abundance of building stones,
a considerable quantity is imported owing to the cost of transport-
ing local materials for long distances overland.
Salt. —The salt industry of India is of considerable economic and
political importance, salt having been made a Government
monopoly. The excise duty levied is about Jd. a pound. The
output, which includes that of Aden, is mainly obtained by the
evaporation of sea-water in Bombay and Madras, other sources of
supply being the brines and saline earths of Rajputana and rock salt
from the Salt Range of the Punjab and the North-West Frontier
Province. Although the production amounted to 1,709,099 tons
in 1929, this is insufficient for the needs of the population, and more
than half a million tons is imported annually, chiefly from the
countries adjacent to the Red Sea.
Mica. —India is by far the most important producer of sheet
mica and splittings in the world. The output consists almost
entirely of muscovite, which is obtained from pegmatite veins in
the Monghyr, Hazaribagh and Gaya districts of Bihar and Orissa
and the Nellore district of Madras. Export figures indicate much
more accurately than production figures the state of the Indian mica
industry. In the calendar year 1929, the exports amounted to
6,804 tons, of which 4,914 tons was in the form of splittings. Very
little of the mica is consumed in the country, and in 1928 the
exports were taken chiefly by the United Kingdom, the United
States and Germany. The mica industry in India has always been
hampered by the excessive amount of theft at the mines; it is
hoped, however, that the Bill passed recently to license miners and
dealers will reduce this practice. It is a curious fact that although
India possesses a monopoly of shellac and also produces the bulk
of the thin splittings used in making micanite, the manufacture of
that commodity in India has never been commercially successful.
Iron ore. —As a producer of iron ore, India is steadily increasing-
in importance, being at present the second largest producer within
the Empire and ninth in the world, with an output of 2,428,555
tons in 1929. Her reserves of this ore are very large, amounting
to almost three-quarters of those of the United States. The chief
sources of supply are the Singhbhum, Mayurbhanj and Koenjhar
districts of Bihar and Orissa.


The building up of an iron and steel industry has been assisted
by protective tariffs and bounties, and in 1928 more than one
million tons of pig-iron were produced, of which nearly 430,000 tons
were exported, mainly to Japan, but that country has recently con-
tracted for the supply of large quantities of iron ore from Australia,
presumably with the intention of becoming independent of imported
pig-iron. Thus it seems likely that India may lose this important
customer.
If the difficulties which lie in the way can be overcome, the iron
and steel industry of India may become of great importance. The
main difficulties are the dearth of coal suitable for making
metallurgical coke, the fact that much of the haematite of Bihar
and Orissa is in the form of a powder unsuitable for direct use in
blast furnaces and, lastly, competition. An attempt to solve the
first of these in Mysore State by the use of charcoal has not yet
proved entirely successful.
In 1929, the pig-iron production in India amounted to 1,348,175
tons, and the steel production to 575,310 tons.
Copper ore and matte. —The lead-zinc ore of the Bawdwin Mine
contains a small amount of copper, which is smelted and exported
in the form of matte, chiefly to Hamburg. In 1929, this amounted
to 11,300 tons, containing an average of 39.8 per cent, copper.
An important deposit of copper ore is worked in the Singhbhum
district and the ore has hitherto been exported in the crude state.
In 1928, however, the erection of a plant to effect the concentrating
and smelting of ore and refining of the metal was completed and
put into operation. Copper bars are now being produced and the
erection of a rolling mill for sheet copper is contemplated.
India imports large quantities of copper.
Tin and Tungsten ores. —Ores of tin and tungsten occur together
in Burma, especially in the districts of Tavoy and Mergui. Before
the war India was the world’s chief producer of tungsten ore, but
China has now attained this position. The Indian production has
greatly declined, and were it not for the fact that the tungsten ores
occur with tin ore, the production would probably be negligible.
The tin ore production in terms of metal remains roughly stationary
at from 2,000 to 3,000 tons a year, varying with the price of tin.
Other metallic ores. —Among other metallic ores produced in
India, only chromite, which is obtained in Baluchistan and Mysore
to the extent of some 50,000 tons a year (49,565 tons in 1929), and
nickel ore, obtained by the Burma Corporation, are of any import-
ance. The latter is exported in the form of speiss to Hamburg for
treatment. In 1928, nearly 3,000 tons were obtained containing
about 25 per cent, nickel, 15 per cent, copper, 3 to 4 per cent,
cobalt and 32 oz. of silver per ton, while the output in 1929
amounted to 3,065 tons.


Other non-metallic minerals. —lndia possesses important deposits
of several other non-metallic minerals.
Saltpetre is obtained as an efflorescence on the surface of the soil
of the Gangetic plain and is exported chiefly to Ceylon.
The precious stones produced include a few diamonds from
Panna State, a considerable quantity of rubies, sapphires and
spinels obtained from the Stone Tract around Mogok in Burma,
and jadeite from Upper Burma, the world’s chief source of supply
of this stone.
Ilmenite, zircon and monazite occur in large deposits in the form
of sands on the shores of Travancore, ilmenite being in considerable
demand as a source of titanium dioxide for use in non-poisonous
white paint.
Clays of all kinds occur and are used locally for the manufacture
of pottery, bricks, tiles and cement.
Among refractory materials, India possesses magnesite deposits
of great purity in the Salem district of Madras and in Mysore State
and produces crude magnesite to the extent of 20,000 to 30,000 tons
a year, the 1929 output amounting to 23,497 tons. It is dead-burnt
for use in the local steel industry, but is mainly caustic calcined for
export.
Sillimanite from Assam and kyanite from the vicinity of the
copper-belt of Singhbhum are other refractories which are gradually
being more extensively used. The quantity of kyanite available is
stated to be very considerable.
Gypsum occurs and is produced in Eajputana and the Punjab.
Steatite (talc) is one of the most widely distributed minerals in
India. The deposits exploited are mainly those of Jaipur State
and Jubbulpore. Much of the material available is of excellent
quality.
Bauxite occurs extensively in the Kaira district of Bombay and
the Jubbulpore district of the Central Provinces. Nearly 15,000
tons were raised in 1928, but the output during 1929 fell to 9,044
tons. It is used mainly for oil-refining and the manufacture of
aluminium sulphate, but not yet for aluminium manufacture.
There are extensive umvorked deposits in Kashmir and elsewhere.
Other non-metallic minerals worked in a small way include
ochres, fuller’s earth, asbestos, barytes, apatite, corundum and
abrasive garnet.
Irish Free State.
The latest date for which statistics of mineral output are avail-
able for the Irish Free State is 1926, for which year the total
output, including coal, was valued at £498,823.

There are large reserves of peat in Ireland, the area covered by
this material being estimated at about a million acres. About
00 per cent, of the farmsteads in the country are dependent entirely
on peat fuel, the annual consumption of which is estimated at
between six and eight million tons. About 50,000 tons of peat
moss litter and peat mull are manufactured annually in Ireland,
and some 10,000 tons of air-dried turf are used annually for power
purposes.
Iron ores, copper ores, lead and zinc ores and barytes were
formerly mined in Ireland but are no longer produced.

Newfoundland.
The chief mining industry of Newfoundland is that of iron-ore
production. In recent years, however, considerable attention has
been paid to other aspects of mineral development in this
Dominion, especially by the Lundberg electrical or geophysical
method of surveying, supplemented by diamond drilling, a method
that has indicated extensive tracts of mineralization in the Island,
such as the rich zinc-lead deposits near Red Indian Lake.
The economic mineral deposits of Newfoundland include iron
ore, copper ore, silver-lead-zinc ores, pyrite, chromite, molybdenite,

valued at over £500,000, this being the only item of mineral pro-
duction statistics available.
Production of zinc and lead concentrates began in October, 1928,
while results have been sufficiently encouraging to warrant hopeful-
ness as regards the possibility of an early resumption of the copper-
mining industry, for which Newfoundland was once famous.

Iron ore. —The phosphoric haematite beds at Wabana, in the
north-west of Bell Island, in Conception Bay, constitute one of
the largest and most important of the world’s iron ore deposits,
the actual amount of ore in sight being estimated at about 3,500
million tons. The ore as worked averages 50 per cent, or more of
iron and about 0.8 per cent, of phosphorus. The ore is compact,
reddish brown in colour and has a fine-grained oolitic texture.
Three separate and distinct beds are being exploited, namely, the
Upper, Middle (Scotia) and Lower (Dominion), the ore being
shipped in large quantities to Sydney in Nova Scotia, to Holland
for Germany, and to Philadelphia in the United States. The out-
puts for 1928 and 1929 were 1,485,178 and 1,494,452 long tons
of ore respectively.
Silver-lead-zinc ore. —A notable mining development in New-
foundland at the present time is that of the Bed Indian Lake-
Noel Paul’s Brook-Buchan’s Eiver deposit of silver-lead-zinc ore.
In connection with it, a 22-mile railway has been built, a 600-ton
selective flotation plant has been constructed, and a hydro-electric
plant of 2,500 H.P. has been developed on Buchan’s Eiver.
Production started in October, 1928, at the rate of 5,000 tons of
concentrates monthly (one-third lead and two-thirds zinc). During
the year ended 30th June, 1929, 10,501 long tons of lead concen-
trates together with 18,168 tons of zinc concentrates, valued respec-
tively at £104,967 and £114,760, were exported from Newfound-
land to the destinations already shown in the table of exports.
Copper. —Some 40 years ago Newfoundland ranked sixth
among the copper-producing countries of the world. The deposits
worked were of high grade, and no ores containing less than 10 per
cent, copper could at that time be shipped at a profit. The industry

has, however, been at a standstill since 1918; but during recent
years there has been a considerable amount of prospecting work,
with promising results. The ores are of a complex nature, but can
be concentrated by differential flotation, and a revival of the
industry is expected in the near future.
The principal copper areas are :—(1) Notre Dame Bay, north-
east coast; (2) west coast, between the Bay of Islands and Bonne
Bay; (3) Placentia Bay, on the south coast.
New Zealand.
The chief minerals produced in New Zealand are coal, gold, stone
and iron ore. Deposits of sulphur, jade and quicksilver are also
worked, and, among other materials that are produced, mention
should be made of pumice and Kauri gum.
The outputs of the more important minerals during 1928 were as

Destinations of the Principal New Zealand Domestic Mineral
Exports during 1928.
(With tonnages in brackets.)
Coal. —Valuable seams of bituminous coal are worked on the
west coast of South Island, principally at Westport and Greymouth.
The principal companies in the former field are the Westport
Coal Co., Ltd., working the Coalbrookdale and other leases with
an annual output of 450,000 tons and the Westport-Stockton Coal
Co., Ltd., with an annual production of 100,000 to 150,000 tons.
Semi-bituminous coal has been mined at Kawakawa, North
Auckland, for a number of years. Brown coal is wnrked in other
parts of Auckland.
Anthracite coal and brown coal are being worked in the province
of Canterbury, and semi-bituminous coal, brown coal and lignite
in Otago and Southland.
Coal is the most valuable mineral mined in New Zealand. The
total output in 1929 amounted to 2,535,864 tons, including 1,367,164
tons of bituminous and sub-bituminous coal, 1,049,603 tons of
brown coal, and 119,097 tons of lignite.
Gold. —The production of gold in New Zealand has shown a
steady decrease in recent years. It is obtained by quartz-, dredge-,
and alluvial-mining. The most important quartz lodes are situated
in the Hauraki Goldfields, in Auckland (North Island). The
Waihi Gold Mining Co., Ltd., is the principal producer from
workings in the Borough of Waihi. In 1929 the output amounted
to 67,616 oz. of gold and 370,455 oz. of silver.
On the west coast of South Island, the Blackwater mine (Eeefton
district) in 1929 produced 16,201 ounces of gold.
Several other quartz mines produced gold on a relatively small
scale in that year.
Gold-dredging, which originated in New Zealand, is rapidly
declining in importance, only five dredges being at work in 1929,
two on the west coast of South Island, and three in Otago and
Southland. In 1929, the total amount of bullion obtained by
dredging was 12,824 oz., valued at T 52,231.


Alluvial mining is confined chiefly to the west coast of the South
Island and to Otago, the bullion production in 1929 amounting to
9,807 oz., valued at £37,822.
The estimated total gold production of New Zealand in 1929
amounted to 112,542 fine troy ounces.
Iron ore. —Iron ore is being worked at Onakaka, Golden Bay,
in the Nelson Provincial district, by the Onakaka Iron and Steel
Co., which owns a blast furnace.
Pig iron was first produced in 1924, and from that year to
1929 inclusive, the production amounted to 20,054 tons. During
1929, 8,043 tons of ore (limonite) were smelted, which yielded a
production of 4,393 tons of pig iron, value £21,965.
Large quantities of magnetic iron ore, more or less titaniferous,
occur along the sea-shore in the province of Taranaki.
Pumice. —Large quantities of pumice in lump, sand and silt
are distributed through the central parts of the North Island.
The pumiceous sand and fine gravel forming the flood-plain of the
Waikato Eiver, are lifted by dredges, classified and calcined. The
fine material is used in the manufacture of sand-soap, etc., and
the coarse in the construction of insulated walls of meat-freezing
plant, etc.
From 1920 to 1929, inclusive, 25,319 tons have been raised from
quarries controlled under the Stone Quarries Act, the whole of
which is exported.
Sulphur. —Native sulphur occurs in commercial amount in New
Zealand only in the Taupo-Eotorua volcanic zone, and on the
White Island volcano, where it occurs in connection with active
or extinct fumarole-vents. From 1920 to 1929, inclusive,
4,637 tons of crude sulphur were produced. There was no output
from 1922 to 1924, inclusive. Since 1925, the sulphur has been
obtained exclusively from White Island. The mineral, after
treatment, is used as a fertilizer in the Dominion, none being
exported.
Tungsten ore. —Several gold-scheelite mines have been worked
in Otago, and at Wakamarina Valley, Marlborough. The total
quantity of scheelite exported up to the end of 1929 amounted to
2,436 tons, valued at £309,740.
Platinum. —Small amounts of platinum, alloyed with osmiridium,
are being raised as a by-product in working the auriferous alluvial
and sea-beach claims at Eound Hill, Orepulai and Wakapatu,
Southland.
Petroleum. —Oil of good quality, but limited in quantity, was
formerly obtained from wells in Tertiary rocks at Maturoa, near
New Plymouth. A few thousand gallons were raised from wells


at Kotuku, also from a Tertiary formation. In two years, 1920*
and 1921, the production of the Dominion was estimated to amount
to 800 long tons. There has been practically no production since,
but several wells are being drilled in the' hope of striking oil in
depth.
Manganese. —A considerable quantity of manganese ore was
formerly mined at Tikiora, near the Bay of Islands, and several
thousand tons were exported from Waiheke Island. The total
quantity exported from the Dominion to the end of 1929 amounted
to 19,385 tons, of a value of £62,006.
Diatomaceous Earth. —Thick beds of diatomaceous earth occur
in the Whirinaki and Waikato valleys, in the Eotorua district. It
is estimated that in the former valley, more than a million tons is
present, the thickness of the bed varying from 15 feet to 18 feet.
In the latter valley there is a bed up to 15 feet in thickness. At
present these deposits are unworked.
Fuller’s Earth. —About four miles from Whangarei. in the North
Auckland district, there is an occurrence of fuller’s earth. Samples
of the earth were examined at the Imperial Institute in 1927, and
for the direct bleaching of vegetable oils the fuller’s earth was
found to be equal to the Surrey earth. The deposit has not yet
been worked.
Quicksilver. —Mercury deposits are being developed at Puhipuhi
about 28 miles from Whangarei (North Island). At present there
is no production, but an adit level is being driven to cut the
cinnabar-bearing formation at a lower level.
An English company has been drilling an area of about 800 acres
at Ngawha Springs, North Auckland. The necessary plant for
mining the deposit and recovering the mercury is being erected.
Other minerals. —Other mineral occurrences of note in New
Zealand include tin ore, copper ore, kaolin, phosphates and jade.
“ Kauri gum,” a resin derived from the Kauri pine, occurs in the
Kauri peat swamps in the northern part, of Auckland Province in
the North Island. Prom these it is dug in large quantities and
shipped chiefly to the United States and Great Britain for use in
making varnishes, etc. The exports of this commodity during
1929 amounted to 4,937 tons, valued at £267,610.
Union of South Africa.
The Union of South Africa is the world’s chief producer of the
important minerals gold and diamonds. The mining industry in
these two minerals and coal is of long standing in South Africa, but
in recent years there have been some notable discoveries of other
minerals, more especially asbestos, platinum and manganese ore.

It is a notable characteristic of the chief South African mineral
deposits that they cover large areas or extend over long distances;
thus, alluvial diamonds have been found along the Namaqualand
coast for about 300 miles; while inland diamonds have been won
within an area of about 50,000 sq. miles; the Witwatersrand gold
deposits extend for about 70 miles; the coal-bearing areas are
very extensive; the various asbestos deposits in the Pietersburg
district extend for over 60 miles, and those of the Kuruman
district are known to stretch over 250 miles; primary platinum
deposits, the largest known in the world, have been found with
breaks and in varying degrees of richness, for great distances along
the periphery of the Bushveld Complex, and the Postmasburg
manganese deposits extend for 40 miles.

during 1928.
(With tonnages in brackets.)
Gold. —Of the 72.5 per cent, of the world’s output of gold which
is produced in the British Empire, the Rand contributes 53 per
cent. Altogether from 1885 up to the end of 1929, about 240,000.000
oz. of gold, or over 7,300 long; tons, worth not less than about
£1,000,000,000, have been extracted from 730,000,000 tons of ore.
At the present time the metallurgy is so efficient that there is
an average extraction of 97 per cent, of the gold content of the
ore, of which the average recovery is 275. Bd. per ton. The ore
is therefore low-grade, so that its exploitation is a matter of low
working costs. The increasing outputs of the last four years .have
been rendered possible only by a reduction of working costs; these
average 19s. 9d. per ton, and can hardly be reduced much further
under present conditions.


Tbe industry supports directly 22,000 white and 200,000 native
employees and indirectly 250,000 whites and 1,000,000 natives,
and so a huge wages bill is met by it. In addition, about
£14,000,000 a year is spent in stores, of which one-half is produced
in South Africa.
At Germiston there is the largest gold refinery in the world,
where all the Rand gold, as well as that from adjacent countries,
is refined and brought up to 995.5 fineness. Transport of bullion
is almost entirely by aeroplane, as is becoming usual in other parts
of the world. The refined gold is mostly exported to India and
London.
Diamonds. —Since the first important discovery of diamonds
at Kimberley in 1870, the Union has produced over 168 million
carats, or over 33 long tons of diamonds. Two kinds are pro-
duced ; (1) mine stones derived from deposits known as pipes, the
matrix being the peculiar igneous rock kimberlite, from which the
diamonds are freed by special methods; (2) alluvial stones found
in stream gravels, chiefly in the basins of the Vaal and Orange
rivers and along the Namaqualand coast.
The chief pipes at present mined are those in the Kimberley
district of Cape Province, the Jagersfontein and Koffyfontein in
the Orange Tree State, and the Premier in the Transvaal. It
was from the last mentioned that the largest white diamond ever
found —the Cullinan—3,lo6 metric carats in weight, was obtained.
In 1927, the value of alluvial diamonds won was £6,198,769,
compared with the average £1,914,167 for the previous 10 years.
This increase was due to the sensational discovery of several new
fields, the principal being the Lichtenburg field in West Transvaal.
Rich deposits were found also in 1927 at Alexander Bay south of
the Orange River mouth and were worked mainly by the Govern-
ment, which by March, 1929, had sold £2,450,000 worth of stones
and still had £4,000,000 worth on hand.
The Union formerly supplied nearly the whole of the world’s
diamond requirements, its chief customer being the United States,
which buys 80 per cent, of the world’s output of diamonds. The
stones from South Africa are on tfie whole superior in size and
quality to those produced elsewhere, and there is consequently a
preference for them. In recent years, however, the production
of diamonds in the Belgian Congo, the Gold Coast and elsewhere
has increased to such an extent that in 1928 the number of carats
produced in the Union of South Africa amounted to less than
60 per cent, of the world’s output; in 1929 it was 50 per cent.
The restricted buying of diamonds by the United States in 1929
seriously affected the South African output for that year. The
Government levies a tax of 10 per cent, on all diamonds exported,
as well as an income tax, and also in the case of the Premier mine
receives 60 per cent, of the profits.
904 H C 2


A diamond-cutting industry has been established, in South
Africa, but so far not much progress has been made.
Coal. —The gold and diamond mining industries of the Union
could not have been developed as they have been without abund-
ant supplies of South African coal, which, with the exception of
East Indian coal, is the cheapest in the world. The coal reserves
are very large and have been estimated to constitute 90 per cent, of
the total coal reserves of Africa.
Coal mining is carried on chiefly in Natal and the Transvaal
in a large coal-bearing area continuous in the N.E. and S.E. of
those provinces and in the N.E. of the Orange Free State.
At the present time about 14 million short tons of coal are sold
per year, the amounts contributed by the Transvaal, Natal and
Orange Free State being about 8, 5 and 1 million tons respectively,
and the prices at pit’s mouth being about 55., 6s. 4d. and ss. 6d.
per ton respectively. Transvaal and Natal graded coals of first-
class quality have calorific values of 12,500 and 13,900 B.Th.U.,
and ash contents of 13.2 and 7.8 per cent, respectively. The latter
coals are largely exported, after grading, and the railways to the
shipping port of Durban have been electrified recently for the
purpose. They are sent to India, Ceylon, Egypt, Mauritius,
Straits Settlements, Sudan, Angola, Madagascar and South
America.
A Fuel Research Institute to investigate processes for the produc-
tion of oil and other by-products from South African coal is about
to be set up at a cost of £30,000. Many seams of cannel coal are
known which on distillation give high percentages of oil. In
addition to these, torbanites occur over large areas, in some parts
in considerable amount.
Platinum. —The largest platiniferous deposits so far found in
the world occur around the periphery of the Bushveld Igneous
Complex in the Transvaal; and in some parts, as at Lydenburg,
Rustenburg and Potgietersrust, platinum has been found in payable
quantities.
The ores are complex, containing gold and silver in addition to
the platinum metals, and copper and nickel as well, and various
companies have worked out methods for treating them, which show
that this is generally profitable if the price of platinum does not
fall below £lO per ounce. The recent exportation of cheaply-
produced alluvial platinum by the Russian Government has, how-
ever, brought the price below this point, with the result that practi-
cally all South African operations, with the exception of those of
a company operating in the Rustenburg district, are at present in
abeyance.
The platinum industry, which depends on the jewellery trade
for two-thirds of its market, is a very sensitive one, like the
diamond industry, and unless a selling agreement for marketing
purposes is made between producers, stability of production cannot


be maintained. Formerly, there was such an agreement with
beneficial results, but now the Russian Government prefers to sell
independently, and the industry has become unprofitable in South
Africa.
Copper ore. —A number of copper-ore deposits are known in
Cape Province, the chief being those worked in Namaqualand.
These, after operating for 50 years, during which there was an
output of £20,000,000 worth of copper, were closed down in 1919;
but some mining was restarted in 1922.
Cupriferous pyrites from the New Areachap mine in Gordonia
is used for acid-making.
The chief producing copper mines in the Union at present, how-
ever, are those at Messina in the extreme north of the Transvaal,
which are yielding about £500,000 worth of copper per year, as
against about £166,000 worth from Cape Province.
Iron ore. —South Africa possesses a large number of iron-ore
deposits, but so far there has been very little development of them.
The most important high-grade deposits so far found are those at
Buffelshoek along the Crocodile River in the Rustenburg district,
which consist of a series of lenticular or tabular deposits each up
to 1,000 yds. long by 50 ft. thick. The ores contain 60 to 69 per
cent, iron, and will supply the new National Iron and Steel
Industry to be established at Pretoria.
A number of replacement deposits associated with igneous rocks
are known, the most important of which is that at Kroomdraai,
which is a stratiform ore-body 40 miles N.N.E. of Pretoria, the
ore being mostly haematite containing up to 60 per cent, of iron
and 13 per cent, of silica.
The so-called magnetic quartzites of the Pretoria series of rocks
are very persistent and extensive beds of arenaceous ore, contain-
ing magnetite and haematite; one bed extends from Canada
Junction to Potchefstrom. Ore from Karroo beds in the same
series, consisting of black-band or sideritic ironstone and contain-
ing about 44 per cent, iron, has hitherto been used in the iron-
smelting industry at Newcastle, Natal.
Extensive deposits of titaniferous iron ore, containing 14 to
19 per cent of titanium dioxide occur near Pretoria, and also at
Magnet Heights, Secoconiland. These are stated to contain 2,000
million tons of ore, but they are at present of no commercial
value.
Manganese. —Although manganese ores are widely distributed
in the Union, the only important deposits are those found along
the Gamagara Ridge for about 40 miles to the north of Postmasburg
in Griqualand West. The deposits are in the form of sheets and
irregular bodies up to 20 ft. thick, the principal ore mineral being
psilomelane. The ore is very dry and hard and does not crumble.
Large tonnages of 49 to 55 per cent, ore are available. Standard
9013 c 3


railway connection has been made with the loading point at
Beeshoek and a local collecting line is being completed. The ore
will be shipped from Durban, and it is expected that it will be
possible to land it at European ports for less than 40 shillings per
ton. Production commenced in June, 1.930, and to the end of
November about 50,000 tons had been shipped.
Tin ore.- —The most productive tin-ore deposits known in the
Union are situated in the Northern Transvaal, the chief producers
being the Zaaiplaats mine to the N.W. of Potgietersrust, where
the ore-bodies are pipes in red granite, and the Mutue Fides mine
70 miles to the S.S.E. of the former, where the ore-bodies are
irregular replacements also in red granite. The two lode mines,
Leeuwpoort and Eooiberg, in the B.W. part of the Waterberg
district, are among the largest in the world of this kind.
Asbestos. —The Union of South Africa has become a producer
of asbestos of first-class importance, the output having increased
in value from £81,230 in 1922 to £497,393 in 1929.
The varieties of asbestos mined are crocidolite or Cape blue
asbestos, and the white varieties, amosite, not known elsewhere,
and chrysotile or serpentine asbestos.
Crocidolite has been mined for over 20 years at a number of
places along a belt in Griqualand West from 4 to 20 miles wide
and extending for 250 miles north. The fibre, which is not over
2 in. long, fetches up to £25 per ton in London, and the demand
exceeds the supply. Crocidolite occurs with amosite and chrysotile
and has been mined in a belt extending from Chuniespoort to
Steelpoort Eiver in the N.E. Transvaal. Amosite, noted for its
long fibres and the cheapness with which it can be mined, occurs
in the same belt in lode-like deposits which are being actively
opened up.
Chrysotile of high-grade has been mined in the Carolina district of
the Transvaal, and important deposits have been worked since 1921
near Ivaapsche Hoop, 30 miles from Barberton.
The values of the sales for 1929 in the Union of the different
kinds of asbestos were chrysotile, £248,157; crocidolite,
£150,995; and amosite, £98,241.
Corundum. —The Transvaal is the largest producer of corundum
in the world. The mineral occurs in an area of 2,000 square miles
in the Zoutpansberg and Pietersburg districts, chiefly between
Louis Trichardt and Zoemakaar, and in the Low Country to the
east. It is of high abrasive efficiency. The United States is the
chief buyer of this corundum, but on account of the high duty
levied on imported grain corundum, only crude picked material is
sent there. An up-to-date dressing mill to treat reef material and
produce standard gradings has been built, and it is hoped to estab-
lish a substantial trade in this material with Europe.


Chromite. —The output of chromite in the Transvaal has
increased largely in recent years. The ore occurs at various places
along the rim of the Bushveld Complex, in pseudo-stratified
deposits, and has in some cases been traced for long distances, but
only in the Lydenburg and Rustenburg districts is it of sufficiently
high grade for mining. The ores there contain between 38 and
46 per cent, chromic oxide, and are therefore of slightly lower
grade than Rhodesian ores, but they are more conveniently situated
for shipment. Lydenburg ore of 44.5 per cent, chromic oxide
content can be delivered for 40 shillings per ton f.o.r. at Delagoa
Bay, while 42.5 percent, ore can be delivered at 35 shillings.
Other minerals. —A number of minerals of less importance than
those dealt with above are produced in the Union.
Arsenic, which is recovered from gold ores in the Barberton
district, is used largely in compounds employed for making solutions
for spraying fruit trees and dipping cattle. The supply does not
meet the demand.
In 1927, discoveries of beryl with emeralds were made on
Somerset Hill, about 10 miles E.N.E. of Leydsdorp and 14 miles
from Gravelotte Siding, and sales of stones valued at £16,206 were
made in 1929.
Fluorspar of 99.5 per cent, purity, some of which is colourless
and suitable for optical purposes, is mined at Ottoshoop near
Zeerust and at Mabula near Warmbaths in the Transvaal.
A small output of graphite is made occasionally from a deposit on
the farm Goedhoop in the Zoutpansberg district of the Transvaal.
Gypsum is quarried chiefly in Griqualand West and in the N.W.
part of the Orange Free State, at a number of localities.
Muscovite mica of excellent quality is mined from veins which
occur over an area of about 300 square miles which extends for
about 50 miles E. from Mica Siding on the Selati Railway,
Transvaal.
Magnesite is quarried near Magnesite Siding on the Pretoria-
Lourenco Marques Railway. A small local demand only exists for
talc, which is quarried from large deposits near Malelane on the
same railway.
About one-quarter of South Africa’s requirements of sulphur is
recovered from iron pyrites produced in the Barberton district and
from cupriferous pyrites from the Areachap mines, Gordonia, as
mentioned above.
Natural soda is produced in considerable quantities from a salt
pan near Pretoria. The pan is 28 acres in area and the saline mud,
which extends in depth to at least 200 feet, contains 16 per cent,
of anhydrous carbonate of soda together with 15 per cent, of salt.

Mineral pigments are quarried near Newcastle, Natal and Hear
Ivrugersdorp, Transvaal. Veins and lenses of coarse pegmatite
containing galena, gadolinite and allanite, with crystals of the
radium mineral uraninite, occur in the valley of the Black River of
Gordonia, a few miles north of its junction with the Orange River.
British Honduras.
British Honduras, the only British possession in Central America,
has hitherto not been a producer of minerals of economic value.
According to the Government Geologist, the colony consists of
a central peneplain of folded Carboniferous marine beds, with
granitic intrusions, surrounded by unfolded limestone of Tertiary
age.
About 52 years ago, an expedition was made from Garbutt’s Falls
(Belize River, near the Guatemala boundary) in a south-easterly
direction to the coast. An account of this expedition was written
by the Colonial Secretary, who accompanied it, in 1879. In one
locality, gold-bearing quartz from a large reef was found, and the
formation of the country seemed to justify the belief that coal, gold
or silver might ultimately be found.
In 1923, cassiterite was discovered in concentrates from the
stream-bed at the head of North Stann Creek, near the Stann
Creek granite outcrop, to the south of Mullins River, and later,
a much more promising area near the granite outcrop of the Vaca
Pine Ridge (near Garbutt’s Falls). Concentrates carrying
cassiterite and colours of gold have been obtained from the river-
beds and river-banks of the Belize River, which traverses the granite
of that area. The Government Geologist is of opinion that some
of these deposits, after further prospecting, may be found to contain
workable quantities of tinstone.
A new mining law has recently been introduced into the legis-
lature, reserving to the Crown all minerals in future grants, and
with regulations governing prospecting and mining rights, and all
matters connected therewith.
British Guiana.
The chief minerals produced in British Guiana, in order of
importance, are diamonds, bauxite and gold.

Among other minerals of interest occurring in British Guiana,
mention should be made of an interesting discovery of palladium
mercuride which was made a few years ago in the Potaro district.
This new mineral, which was named potarite, has not yet been
found in commercially important quantities, but several nuggets
of substantial size have been obtained, ranging in weight up to
12 grams.

Destinations of the Principal Domestic Mineral Exports from
British Guiana during 1928.
Diamonds. —The diamond workings are practically confined to a
belt of country, from 10 to 30 miles broad, adjacent to the
Mazaruni, Puruni, Cuyuni, Potaro and Berbice rivers. Prom 1901,
the first year for which output was recorded, up to the end of 1929,
the alluvial diggings have yielded 10,969,533 stones totalling
1,699,657 metric carats, the stones averaging six or seven to the
carat, although several large diamonds have been found. During
the last six years there has been a decline in the production of
diamonds, due to the gradual exhaustion of the known alluvial
deposits and to the fact that, in the meantime, no new fields have
been discovered.
In 1929, the output amounted to 937,489 stones, weighing
125,799 metric carats valued at £471,746.
Bauxite. —-Deposits of massive bauxite occur in the sand-clay
belt exposed between Christianburg and Akyma on the Demerara
Eiver. The ore is being exploited at present at Three Friends and
Coomatka, Demerara Eiver.
The first shipment was made in 1917, and from that year to 1929,
inclusive, 1,176,709 tons of bauxite have been shipped, valued
roughly at £1,200,000.
In 1929, 185,151 tons of bauxite (containing at least 60 per cent,
of alumina) were crushed, washed and kiln-dried. Until 1929, the
ore was exported to the United States; but in that year shipments
were sent also to Canada. In addition to the production mentioned
above, there is also an annual output of 30,000 tons or so of lower-
grade material containing 30 to 50 per cent, of alumina, which is
not exported.
Gold. —The gold industry of British Guiana dates from 1884,
when 250 oz. were raised. From 1884 to 1929, 2,681,638 oz. were
won, valued at £9,782,668, but there has been a gradual decline in
production since 1902-1903, due to the gradual exhaustion of the
alluvial deposits.
In 1929, 7,294 oz. of gold was produced, of which 3,851 oz. were
won by dredging in the Minnehaha and Mahdia creeks, while
alluvial washing by hand methods yielded 3,443 oz. The largest
producing area at present is the Essequibo-Konawaruk-Potaro

In addition to alluvial deposits, gold-bearing reefs occur and have
been worked on modern lines in several localities. At present there
is no gold quartz mine actually at work.

Petroleum. —Petroleum occurs in Southern Trinidad, where all
the productive wells have been drilled along a series of flexures,
mainly anticlines, striking from east to west. The most northerly,
known as the Central Eange flexure, is near the centre of the
island, in rocks which are probably of Cretaceous age. The forma-
tion to the south, in which the remaining anticlines occur, is
undoubtedly of Tertiary age.
The production of petroleum in Trinidad from 1920 to 1929,
inclusive, amounted to 6,181,913 tons. The output increased from
285,346 tons in 1920 to 1,193,925 tons in 1929.
Petroleum has been found in Tobago Island, but not as yet in
commercial quantities.
Asphalt. —The Pitch Lake of Trinidad has an area of 137 acres,
and consists of an emulsion of bitumen, sand and water, the
mineral being a variety of asphalt. The deposit has a maximum
thickness of 135 ft., and the reserves a few years ago were estimated
at 9,000,000 tons.


The asphalt is dug out by hand, loaded on trolleys hauled by
cable along a rail track, and then carried by an inclined cable for
nearly one mile to the wharf, where it is tipped into steamers for
export. To render the asphalt merchantable, it is heated to
150° C. to drive off water and the small amount of volatile con-
stituents it contains.
From April Ist, 1911, to the end of 1929, the production
amounted to 3,147,345 tons. In 1929, the output amounted to
219,603 tons.
Other minerals. —Manjak or glance pitch, a variety of
asphalt, occurs as veins and fissures in the Tertiary rocks of San
Fernando and other localities, and was formerly worked at the
Marabella and Vista Bella mines. Since 1920, however, there has
been no production.
Deposits of coal and lignite occur in Trinidad, but are not con-
sidered + o be of economic value.
Gypsum deposits occur in several localities, but remain unworked
at present.
Barbados.
The only minerals produced in Barbados are petroleum and
manjak.
Petroleum occurs in the oil-bearing series, which is thought to
be of Tertiary age. An output of 283 tons of petroleum is re-
ported for 1927 and 1,213 tons for 1928.
Manjak occurs near the crest of an anticline in fissures which
traverse the shales and sandstone of the oil-bearing series. One
shaft sunk in manjak passed into petroleum at a depth of 150 ft.
The mineral has been mined to a depth of about 300 ft., but the
production is now unimportant.
The principal imports into Barbados during 1928 were coal
(301,563 long tons), ammonium sulphate (4,629 tons), common salt
(2,430 tons), and petroleum oils, including motor spirit (791,349
gal.), kerosene (413,534 gal.), lubricating oil (£7,247) and residual
oil (1,392 tons).
Sierra Leone.
During recent years, various mineral occurrences of possible
economic value have been found in the course of the work carried
out by the Geological Survey of Sierra Leone. The more notable
of these are occurrences of iron ore, platinum and chromite; but
ilmenitic black sands, gold and other minerals have also been
found.
The production of platinum from November, 1929, to June,
1930, was 407 ounces, mining being suspended during rains in
July and August. From April, 1930, to August, 1930, the gold
produced amounted to 350 ounces.

Iron ore. —Extensive deposits of haematite and magnetite are
known, of which the Marampa haematite deposits are the most
promising from a commercial standpoint. The main ore-bodies
form two prominent hills near the village of Marampa. The deposit
on the Masaboitanki hill is being developed by shafts and adits.
There is a thin capping of loose boulders of hard ore, beneath
which is a layer of hard red, brown and black ore from 15 ft. to
20 ft. in thickness, which passes gradually downwards into
laminated high-grade haematite. On the Bahia hill, shafts have
been sunk showing high-grade hard ore, having an average thick-
ness of 17 ft., overlying haematite. Analyses show from 56.43
to 63.6 per cent, of iron, 0.71 to 1.90 per cent, of silica, and 0.021
to 0.04 per cent, of phosphorus. Development up to the present
has indicated more than 10 million tons of high-grade ore, averag-
ing 57 per cent, of iron, and, in addition, hve million tons of high-
grade haematite.
Extensive deposits of high-grade haematite and magnetite, with
low phosphorus content, occur in the banded ironstones in south-
west Koinaduga district.
Platinum. —Alluvial platinum is widely distributed in beach and
stream gravels, and promising deposits have been located in the
York district. Nuggets up to about 10 \ dwt. in size have been
found in prospecting. The platinum is associated with a large
quantity of ilmenite, which may prove a valuable by-product of
platinum mining.
An analysis made at the Imperial Institute of the crude
platinum washed from the Big Water, near York Pass, gave ;

Other minerals. —Other mineral occurrences in Sierra Leone
include alluvial gold in the Sula-Kagnari schist-belt, chromite in
talc-schist and serpentine about six miles north of Hangha,
corundum boulders in the Koinaduga district, and titaniferous
beach and river sands, some of which are platiniferous.
The potential water-power resources of Sierra Leone are con-
siderable.
Gold Coast.
The minerals produced in the Gold Coast include gold, manganese
ore and diamonds. Extensive deposits of bauxite of good quality
occur at various localities, and alluvial tin ore has been found in
the beach gravels of one locality.
The outputs of minerals in The Gold Coast during 1928 were as

Gold. —'From 1903 to 1929 inclusive, about 6,600,000 oz. of
gold valued at about £28,190,000 have been raised in the Gold
Coast.
The major portion of the gold output at present comes from
quartz mines, the principal being those at Obuasi, Ashanti. The
reserves at these mines on September 29, 1929, were estimated
at 590,200 tons, averaging 25.2 dwt. of gold per ton.
Another important gold-quartz property is the old Prestea mine,
in the Dunkwa district, near the right bank of the Ankobra Eiver,
Gold Coast Colony, the reserves of which on March 31, 1929,
were estimated at 218,722 tons, averaging 12.49 dwt. of gold per
ton.
A large amount of gold has been raised for a considerable
number of years from the auriferous conglomerate (banket) beds
of the Wassau district, a few miles from the left bank of the
Ankobra Eiver, Gold Coast Colony. The old Taquah mine, which
has produced a considerable quantity of gold, w T as closed down on
9th September, 1928. The Abosso and Adjah Bippo mines are
working, but the Cinnamon Bippo mine, wdiich was formerly
worked, is at present lying idle. There is a 50-stamp mill and
cyanide plant, run by a new power plant at the Taquah and Abosso
mines. The ore reserves at 31st March, 1929, were estimated at
261,206 tons, value 345. 6d. per ton.
The Abbontiakoon mine, which was closed down in 1927, has
been re-opened.
Several dredges were running for several years in the Pra and
Offin rivers, Ashanti, and in the Ankobra and other rivers, but no
dredges have been at work since 1925. From 1912 to 1919, inclusive,
some 45,000 oz. of gold were produced by dredging, but very little
has been raised since then.
Mining of the alluvial deposits near Kijebi was started in July,
1921, and from that year to 1928 some 5,500 oz. of gold have been
raised by that method.
Gold-bearing quartz veins and alluvial gold occur in the Northern
Territories.
Manganese ore. —A large deposit of manganese ore was discovered
at Insuta-Dagwin, near Taquah, on 9th May, 1914, by the Gold
Coast Geological Survey, and assumed much importance as an


Empire source of supply during the war. From 1916 to 1929,
inclusive, the exports of manganese ore amounted to about
2,400,000 tons of wet ore. The industry is expanding, the largest
export being in 1929, with 408,224 tons. The Gold Coast produces
more manganese ore than Brazil, and has taken the third place
as a world producer, only India and Russia being more important.
Diamonds. —The first discovery of diamonds in the Gold Coast
was made at Abomoso, near the Bir'im River, in February, 1919,
by the Gold Coast Geological Survey.
Diamonds were subsequently found to have a wide distribution
in the Gold Coast, where they occur in the gravels of streams and
old marine deposits, but the basin of the Birim River has proved
to be the most important economically up to the present, although
some diamonds are being raised from the banks of the Fra River,
Ashanti, and from a few other rivers and streams.
The Birim diamonds are small in size, averaging about 20 to the
carat, but of good quality, and there is a good demand for them
in the industry.
From 1920 to 1929, inclusive, 2,380,265 metric carats were
shipped to Great Britain. In 1929, the exports of diamonds
amounted to 660,536 carats.
Bauxite. —Large deposits of bauxite (aluminium ore) have been
discovered from time to time at many places in the Colony and
Ashanti by the Gold Coast Geological Survey. The principal
deposits are those on Mount Ejuanema, Kwahu plateau, and on
the Ichinniso, Kanaiycribo and Supirri mountains, near Sefwi
Bekwai.
A number of shafts have been sunk on the Mount Ejuanema
deposit, and the quantity of bauxite on the mountain is estimated
at 4,000,000 tons, containing about 60 per cent, of aluminium,
while the quantity of bauxite available in the remaining three
mountains mentioned is estimated at about 25,000,000 tons.
Tin ore. —Some stream tin (alluvial cassiterite) associated with
alluvial gold, occurs in the beach gravels around Mankofa Lagoon,
Mamkwadi, and has been worked to some extent by natives, but
the quantity of mineral obtained has not been reported.
Nigeria.
The mineral resources of Nigeria constitute a valuable asset to
the country, and important deposits of tin ore and coal, together
with other minerals, are being exploited. Thus in 1929, 74
mining companies and 70 individual workers were operating tin
deposits; the Nigerian Government was exploiting the Udi coal-
field ; one individual was winning gold and another was mining
silver-lead, while one company was producing both silver-lead
and zinc.

The increase in the use of mining machinery has been note-
worthy during recent years, and the introduction of steam shovels
has been of particular interest. A, number of hydraulic plants
have been constructed; and the completion of the new dam and
power house at Kurra Falls will enable the greater part of the
Nigerian plateau to be supplied with cheap electricity.
The chief minerals produced in Nigeria, as shown by their out-
puts during 1928, are as follows :
Sources of the Principal Nigerian Mineral Imports during 1928.

(With tonnages in brackets.)


Tin ore. —The output of tin ore in Nigeria during 1929 was
10,734 tons (in terms of metal), equivalent to 5 per cent, of the
world’s total production of the mineral.
The ore at present being exploited is almost entirely of alluvial
origin, and is obtained from numerous localities on and around the
Bauchi plateau, especially in the granite areas of Bukuru and
Eopp. Other occurrences of note are situated in the provinces
of Zaria, Kano and Ilorin,- the richest deposits being usually
covered with an overburden of sand, gravel or clay of variable
thickness.
Various methods are employed for winning the ore, ranging
from bucket-dredging, gravel-pumping and hydraulicking to ground-
sluicing and tributing, while during recent years steam shovels
and drag-lines have been used to a small extent.
The concentrates contain approximately 70 per cent, of metallic
tin, and are exported to the United Kingdom for smelting. Owing
to the absence of deleterious material, they are much appreciated
by tin-smelters for mixing with low-grade material from other
sources.
An event of outstanding importance to the tin-mining industry
of Nigeria has been the recent opening of the new electrical
installation at Kurra Kalis by the Nigerian Electricity Supply
Corporation.
Coal. —The only coalfield at present being exploited in Nigeria
is that of the Udi-Okwoga district, where the Nigerian Govern-
ment are operating the Udi and Iva mines. The coalfield is stated
to have an estimated area of 1,800 sq. miles, while the coal is
black and of the sub-bituminous variety. Most of the coal pro-
duced is sent to Port Harcourt, where much of it is shipped to
Lagos, chiefly for use on the railways. The neighbouring Colony
of the Gold Coast is also supplied with considerable quantities of
this coal, while a certain amount is used by steamers which make
Port Harcourt a place of call.
Large deposits of brown coal or lignite are known to occur on
both sides of the River Niger near Asaba, and in the neighbouring
districts, but so far there has been no output from these deposits,
although it has been proved that a fuel of good quality can be
obtained by briquetting.
The amount of coal produced during 1929 was 344,937 tons.
Gold. —Gold occurs in a number of places in Nigeria, but
hitherto the production has been small and has been chiefly ob-
tained from the alluvial deposits near Minna, although a certain
amount has been recovered from stream workings in the Horin
Province.
Lode deposits have been discovered at Minna, Birnin Gwari
and at Rimi, but detailed information is not available.

The amount of gold produced during 1929 was 192 troy ounces.
Salt. —The principal centres of the salt industry are at Üburu,
in the province of Ogoja; at Awe and Bomanda in Muri Province;
and in the Geidam and Chad districts of Bornu Province. The
introduction of European salt has, however, adversely affected the
native industry.
Silver-lead-zinc ore. —Silver-lead-zinc ore is being developed in
the Abakaliki district of Southern Nigeria by the Nigerian Base
Metals Corporation, Ltd. It is estimated that above 100 ft. level
in the Ameka mines there are 10,000 tons of zinc ore and 4,000
tons of silver-lead ore. Deep prospecting is being undertaken at
these mines, and small outputs have already been recorded. During
the year 1929 there was an output of 71 tons of lead concentrate
averaging about 90 ounces of silver to the ton.
Other minerals. —Other mineral occurrences of note in Nigeria
include rock phosphate, iron ore, wolframite, molybdenite, mica,
diatomaceous earth, limestones, clays and asphalt.
South-West Africa.
In recent years there has been a considerable amount of
geological and mineral prospecting work carried out in South-West
Africa, and occurrences of a considerable number of minerals have
been recorded, but only a comparatively few of them are known
to be sufficiently abundant to be worth working commercially.
The existence of coal or other mineral fuel has not yet been proved.
At present by far the most important mineral product of the country
as regards value is diamond, of which the known reserves are con-
siderable. Copper and lead ores are also widely distributed and
were smelted by the natives long ago. Vanadium ore and tin ore
are produced in smaller amounts, and deposits of beryl are
known which may eventually prove valuable as a source of the
metal beryllium, the value of which as an alloy metal has recently
been proved.
The chief minerals produced in South-West Africa are as
follows, in order of importance as shown by the values of outputs
in 1928 :—•
Other minerals produced in 1928 include silver (728,165 fine oz.),
gold (541 fine oz.), iron ore (29,456 tons), salt (144 tons), fluorspar
(858 tons), tantalite (6 cwt.), rose quartz (3| tons), and tourmaline
(959 cwt.).

Diamonds. —South-West Africa ranks fourth as a world pro-
ducer of diamonds. Although a large number of kimberlite pipes
similar to those of the Union of iSouth Africa have been discovered,
they have hitherto proved barren of diamonds, all of which are
obtained from alluvial deposits. These, which were discovered in
1908, occur along the sea coast from Conception Bay to the mouth
of the Orange River, extending only a short distance inland.
The diamonds are found in terraces of marine sandstones and in
sandy deposits derived from them. The gravels are dug by hand
or mechanical excavators and concentrated by jigging. The
maximum output was more than million carats in 1913-1914,
and in 1929 it was over J million carats of an average value of
60s. BJd. per carat. The reserves were estimated some years ago
to be 14 to 16 million carats.


Towards the end of 1928 the valuable deposits of diamond
recently discovered in Namaqualand were proved to extend across
the Orange River into South-West Africa, where they contain
larger and finer stones than those found elsewhere in the country.
Copper-Lead ore. —Numerous deposits of copper ore have been
noted in various parts of the country, some of which have been
worked on a small scale for many years. Large-scale workings,
however, have only taken place in the vicinity of Tsumeb and
Grootfontein. At present the only production taking place is at
the Tsumeb and Guchab mines. The ore, which occurs as lenses
in dolomite, contains in addition to copper and lead, zinc, silver,
antimony, arsenic, cadmium, vanadium and beryllium.
A small proportion of the ore raised is exported and some is
smelted locally, the copper-lead matte and pig-lead produced being
exported, and the remainder stored for future treatment. In 1929,
the exports amounted to 53,816 tons of copper-lead ore, 11,229 tons
of copper-lead matte and 3,779 tons of pig-lead, the metal content
of the whole being about 11,700 tons copper, 21,000 tons of lead
and 900,000 oz. silver. Lead is therefore the principal product
of the mines. In the lower levels the zinc content of the ore
increases, but it is not yet being treated for the recovery of zinc.
A Cotterell plant for the recovery of cadmium is in operation and
the precipitates are being stored. The output of these mines has
materially increased in recent years. About three-quarters of the
exported material goes to Belgium and the rest to Germany.
Of the several other copper-ore mines which have been worked,
the Khan mine near Arandis is the most important. Although
well equipped, it has not been worked for a number of years.
Argentiferous galena occurs and is worked in a small way near
Aiais.
Vanadium ore.— Vanadium occurs as mottramite (copper-lead-
vanadate) at several localities in South-West Africa. The principal
producer is the Abenab mine, but the Tsumeb mines and several
smaller ones contribute to the output. The average production
for several years has exceeded 3,000 tons of concentrates containing
18 per cent. V 2 0 5 , but the price obtainable has dropped consider-
ably in the last few years.
Tin ore. —Tin ore (cassiterite) occurs over a large area in a belt
about 40 miles w r ide extending from Otjimboyo on the Khan Eiver
north-westwards to Vis, east of the Brandberg. The ore is
sporadically distributed through innumerable pegmatite veins,
which on the whole have proved poor and patchy in working. In
places within this area denudation of the veins has given rise
to eluvial deposits which have been profitably exploited in spite
of the shortage of water and labour. Production at present is
limited to the output of small syndicates, exploratory and develop-
ment work on a large scale having hitherto been handicapped by


lack of capital. The output amounts to about 200 tons of concen-
trates a year, all of which is exported.
Iron ore. —Extensive deposits of high-grade iron ore are reported
to occur in the western portion of the Kaokoveld, but their
geographical situation has so far rendered their exploitation im-
practicable. A deposit of limonite near Kalkfeld in the Omaruru
district is worked, and the ore sent to Tsumeb for use as a flux in
smelting the copper-lead ore there. The amount railed in 1928
amounted to nearly 30,000 tons.
Fluorspar. —Several occurrences of fluorspar have been recorded
and one at Omburo has been worked for a few years, the output
reaching nearly 1,000 tons a year. Owing to the unsatisfactory
state of the market for this mineral the property was closed dow ; u
during 1929.
Bechuanaland.
The only mineral output recorded for Bechuanaland is that of
gold, from the Tati and Monarch districts in the north-east of the
Protectorate, where gold-mining has been carried on in a small way
for many years. The output of gold has fallen in recent years
from 6,005 oz. in 1923 to 1,686 oz. in 1929. Silver, which is alloyed
with the gold, is also produced, but the output fell from 1,317 oz.
in 1923 to 148 oz. in 1929. Ores of copper and other base metals
are reported to occur in this area, but have not yet been worked,
and a promising occurrence of asbestos is being prospected.
Goal occurs further south, near Palapye, but has not yet been
worked.
In the Bangwaketsi Eeserve, in the extreme south-east of the
Protectorate, occurrences of asbestos and argentiferous galena have
been noted. A sample of the latter examined at the Imperial
Institute was found to be ore of good quality.
Swaziland.
Until recently, gold and alluvial tin ore have been the two chief
minerals produced in Swaziland, but recently there has been an
output of asbestos. Anthracite coal and other minerals are also
reported to occur.
Gold has been mined on a small scale for many years in the
north-west of the Territory at Pigg’s Peak, and at Porbes’ Eeef
15 miles north of Mbabane. The total output from 1920 to 1929
amounted to 5,781 oz. valued at over £25,000, but of late the out-
put has declined. Only Pigg’s Peak is producing at present.
Tin production from alluvial workings in the vicinities of
Forbes’ Eeef and Mbabane has taken place since 1910, but at
present only the latter locality is producing. The output of tin ore

has been fairly regular for some years and amounted to 130 tons
(metal content) in each of the years 1928 and 1929. The total
output of tin ore from 1920 to 1929 amounted to 2,385 tons valued
at £450,000.
There has been much activity recently in connection with the
exploration of chrysotile asbestos deposits in Swaziland, more
especially on the Havelock and Eobolongo Concessions in the north-
west of the Territory. In the south-east of the Territory, about
50 miles east of Mbabane, and 70 miles from Delagoa Bay, deposits
of anthracite of good quality are reported to occur. These may
prove of value at a later date if railway extension should render
practicable their exploitation.
Southern Rhodesia.
Southern Ehodesia yields a good variety of mineral products,
the chief of which, as shown in the output table given below, are
gold, asbestos, chrome ore and coal.
About one half of the country, mainly to the east, consists of
granite rocks, these being traversed in a N.N.E.-S.S.W. direction,
and almost in a straight line, by what is known as the Great Dyke,
which is about 300 miles long and from three to four miles wide.
This remarkable dyke consists of highly basic rocks with which are
associated deposits of chrome ore, asbestos and platinum. •
The values of mineral outputs in Southern Ehodesia during 1928
were as follows :

Destinations of the Principal Southern Rhodesian Mineral Exports
during 1928.
(With tonnages in brackets.)
Gold. —The gold production of Southern Ehodesia in 1929
amounted to 560,813 oz., of which no less than 412,744 oz. was
produced by nine companies.
The whole of the gold output is recovered from quartz reefs or
lode formations, but there are places where it might be possible to
work alluvial ground.
The mining of gold ore has been carried on continuously for
many years, and the output has, on the whole, been well main-
tained. Recently, owing to the exhaustion of several mines, the
output has slightly decreased, so that it is to be hoped some new
mines will be discovered, especially in the S.E. area, which is to
be systematically examined.
Asbestos. —Although the output of gold in Southern Rhodesia
has recently shown a slight decrease, this decrease has been more
than made good by the increased output of several other minerals,
especially asbestos. The asbestos industry is now second in
importance to that of gold, and the colony is probably the second
largest producer in the world, Canada being first.
The asbestos produced is all of the chrysotile variety. The
Shabanie and other mines in the Belingwe district produce one-
half of the total output of the country; the Gath and King mines,


in the Mashaba district, one-quarter of the output; the Nil
Desperandum and Sphinx mines near the Shabanie, and the Croft
Mine at Eilabusi, about one-fifth of the output. These, with a
number of smaller producing mines, are in the southern part of the
country, but two deposits are worked in the north in the Lomagundi
district, near the Great Dyke.
The fibre exported consists of the highest grades only, which find
a ready market in Europe. Confidence in the asbestos industry in
the Colony has been shown by the Railway Administration, in
providing branch lines for the transport of the product to the main
line.
The output in 1929 amounted to 38,066 long tons.
Chrome ore. —At the present time, Southern Rhodesia is the
world’s leading producer of chromite, not only in quantity but
also in quality, and, as far as can be seen, immense supplies are
available over large areas, especially in the vicinity of the Great
Dyke.
Eew discoveries of chromite are being made in other countries
at the present time. The demand for the ore is increasing, and
it seems likeiy that Southern Rhodesia will continue for some years
to be the world’s chief producer of chrome ore. Many of the
deposits now being worked in the country are situated at some
distance from the railway line, but when more connecting branch
lines have been built, the marketing conditions will be consider-
ably improved.
Of the total output of 261,711 long tons in 1929, no less than
187,426 tons came from the mines of one Company, mainly in the
Gwelo district. There are a number of other operators in the
Gwelo, Hartley, Lomagundi and Victoria districts, the chief mines
being in the neighbourhood of Selukwe Peak in the south; but in
the Lomagundi or Umvukwe region in the north, there are still
a number of unworked deposits.
Goal. —Coal has been found in no less than fourteen localities
in Southern Rhodesia, chiefly in the S.E. and in the N.W., but
only one deposit is being worked, i.e., that at Wankie, where a
huge tonnage has been proved. On one area alone of about
400 square miles in area, there is enough coal to supply all the
wants of Southern Rhodesia and Katanga at the present rate of
demand for the next 4,000 years, so there is not at present much
inducement for developing any more deposits in the country. The
coal is the highest in grade produced in South Africa.
The coal output during 1929 amounted to 1,020,446 long tons.
Copper ore. —Copper has been produced in Southern Rhodesia,
but although a number of copper deposits are known in the country,

the total output to date has practically all been recovered from the
Falcon mine in the Umvuma district, which is now exhausted.
It is not likely that any of the other deposits in the country
will be worked at present in view of the large-scale production
which is anticipated from the neighbouring colony of Northern
Rhodesia.
In 1929, the output amounted to 312 long tons (smelter output).
Mica. —A small mica industry has been established in Southern
Ehodesia, 169 tons being produced in 1929. Of this output the
Idol mine near Eusambo in the N.E. corner of the Mazoe district,
produced 34 tons, valued provisionally at £8,751, the remainder of
the output being from the Miami area in the north-west. Ehodesian
mica is of good quality, and has a fair chance of continuing to find
a market in spite of severe competition.
Other minerals. —Other minerals recovered m small quantities in
Southern Ehodesia include ores of arsenic, lead, tin and tungsten,
iron, zinc and antimony as well as diamonds and other precious
stones. Deposits of tantalum minerals, corundum and lithium
mica are also known, and there are occurrences of platinum ore
at the northern end of the Great Dyke.
Northern Rhodesia.
Considerable attention has been paid in recent years to the
mineral development of Northern Ehodesia, a country which
shows promise of becoming one of the world’s most important
copper producers.
The country possesses a variety of minerals of which the most
important are those of copper, lead, zinc and vanadium, as shown
in the following table :

Copper. —Geological mapping, traverse surveys and an intensive
systematic drilling campaign have during the past few years in-
dicated the presence of over 300 million tons of copper ore in
Northern Rhodesia, averaging some 3J per cent, metallic copper.
Seven mines have already been proved, namely : Roan Antelope,
N’Kana, Mufulira, Chambishi, N’Changa, West Extension, and
Bwana M’Kubwa, while a number of other properties show con-
siderable promise. The approximate dimensions, tonnage and grade

of copper ore in the above mines have recently been tabulated by
A. M. Bateman (Bcon. Geol., 1930, vol. 25, p. 380), as follows :
The ore, unlike that of the Belgian Congo (which occurs in the
form of carbonates and silicates), consists essentially of the copper
sulphides chalcocite, bornite and chalcopyrite, together wuth an
appreciable amount of cobalt (about J per cent.), but no gold,
silver or platinum.
The difficulties of labour, cheap fuel, and transport are gradually
being overcome, and by the time the proposed railway schemes are
carried out, transport will probably be adequate for the industry.
Coal is at present being obtained from the Wankie colliery in
Southern Ehodesia. It should be mentioned, however, that
numerous streams are available all the year round in Northern
Rhodesia, and that these can be utilized for hydro-electric schemes.
It has recently been announced that the blister copper produced
in Northern Ehodesia will be exported to England for treatment
in a copper refinery with a capacity of some 200,000 tons of electro-
lytic copper, to be erected at or near Liverpool.
The smelter production in 1929 amounted to 5,466 long tons.
Zinc-lead-vanadium ore. —Important deposits of zinc-lead-
vanadium ore occur at Broken Hill in Northern Ehodesia. The
ore-bodies are regarded as replacement deposits of dolomite, the
estimated ore reserves on December 31, 1926, being given as
follows ; —'
Oxidized zinc ore, 935,000 tons averaging 30 per cent, zinc,
8 per cent, lead and 0.9 per cent, vanadium oxide.
Vanadium, ores, 38,000 tons averaging 8 per cent, zinc,
8 per cent, lead, and 3.5 per cent, vanadium oxide.
Sulphide ores, 164,000 tons averaging 34 per cent. zinc, and
20 per cent. lead.
A flotation plant to recover lead concentrates from the sulphide
ores commenced operation in 1926, and an electrolytic plant in
January, 1928, producing 9,597 and 12,121 long tons respectively
of slab zinc. Power is obtained from a 12,500 h.p. electrical
power station near the Mulungashi Palls, some 35 miles distant
from the mine.

In 1929, the outputs amounted to 22,230 long tons of zinc (metal
content of ore), 1,635 tons of lead (smelter output), and 59 tons
of vanadium (metal content of ore).
Gold. —Gold occurs at a number of places in Northern Rhodesia,
but hitherto the output has been small. The most important de-
posit is at the Matala mine, where operations with a 50-ton mill
were recently commenced. The output in 1929 amounted to 699
troy oz.
Goal. —Coal occurs in the Luano Valley, east of Broken Hill,
and drilling operations are in progress to determine the value of
the occurrence. At present, supplies are obtained from the Wankie
Colliery in Southern Rhodesia, where the estimated coal reserves
are stated to be 3,000 million tons.
Other minerals. —In addition to the foregoing minerals, man-
ganese ore is mined in small quantities in the Broken Hill district
for metallurgical purposes; up to the end of 1929, 19 tons of mica
and 8 tons of bismuth were produced from the Luano Valley, while
silver valued at £50,729 was obtained from lead and copper
smelting; iron ore has been worked recently, and asbestos is stated
to occur between Kafue Station and the Zambesi. The iron ore
production in 1929 amounted to 3,556 tons.
Nyasaland.
The mineral resources of Nyasaland have been actively investi-
gated for some years past. A preliminary mineral survey of the
country was carried out between the years 1906 and 1909 under
the auspices of the Imperial Institute, and in 1918 a Government
Geologist was appointed. As a result, occurrences of coal, bauxite,
lead ore, graphite, mica, asbestos and certain other economic
minerals were found.
Sources of the Principal Nyasaland Mineral Imports during 1928.
(With tonnages in brackets.)


A brief account of what is know T u about Nyasaland mineral
occurrences is given in the following notes ;
Goal. —Coal deposits of Karroo age occur in the northern part
of the country and also in the extreme south-west. In the
northern area the occurrences take the form of small patches of
coal-bearing shales and are most evident in the Mount Waller dis-
trict on Lake Nyasa. In the Eumpi Gorge three seams 2, 5
and 9 ft. thick have been found, the two thicker ones yielding
good coking coal.
In the south-eastern area the fields are larger and have been
more thoroughly investigated. The shale beds containing coal
seams crop out in the Sumbu and the Chiromo districts, and
probably underlie the alluvium of the Shire Valley to the north.
The Chiromo field has been proved by boring to be of small extent
and the seams much folded and faulted so that it offers no reason-
able prospect for economic development. The coal, which is
semi-anthracite, non-coking and usually high in ash content, occurs
in seams up to 12 ft. in thickness. The Sumbu field is much
larger. It occupies an area about 20 miles long by 10 miles wide
close to the Portuguese boundary, the beds dipping gently to the
south-west and rising again to the surface in Portuguese territory
where they form the Tete coalfield. So far, coal seams discovered
range in thickness from 3 ft. 6 in. to 12 ft. and the coal generally
consists of alternations of dull and bright bands.
Numerous samples have been examined at the Imperial Institute
and have generally proved rather high in ash content and some-
what friable, but they have not been obtained from any depth. A
few have been found to be coking coal and to compare favourably
with that produced at Tete and Wankie. Until a more thorough
investigation of the coalfield has been carried out the economic
possibilities of the deposit will remain doubtful.
Bauxite. —Deposits of bauxite have been found on several of
the Nyasaland plateaux but the only occurrence of importance is
that of the Lichenya plateau in the Mlanje Mountains in the
south-east of the country. The main deposit extends over an area
of two square miles and is in places 40 ft. thick, being overlain-
by only a few inches of soil. Analysis has disclosed the presence
of more than 60 per cent, of alumina in some samples, but the
deposits as a whole appear to be of low grade. The plateau is
difficult of access, but considerable water-power resources are
stated to exist in the vicinity.
Limestone. —Many varieties of limestone are distributed over
the country and some have been found suitable for lime burning
for agricultural and building purposes and for cement manufacture.
During 1928, the output of limestone amounted to 245 tons, valued
at £6l, and during 1929 to 288 tons, valued at £72.

Graphite. —Graphite is widely distributed through the country
in schists, but deposits of possible economic value have as yet only
been found near Mkoma Mission in Angoniland where they appear
to be of rather limited extent and transport facilities are unfavour-
able for development.
Mica. —Mica occurs in various districts, and in the Dowa
district there was an output of 125 tons between 1910 and 1916.
Other minerals. —Other economic minerals, occurrences of
which have been noted, include asbestos, silver-lead ore, gold,
iron ore, corundum and clay.
Tanganyika Territory.
The economic development of this Territory has received con-
siderable attention during recent years, and at present valuable
deposits of diamonds, gold, salt, mica and tin ore are being-
exploited. The exports and local sales of the chief minerals during
1928 were as follows :
Silver, gem garnet, ochre and graphite are also produced, but in
less important amounts.

Diamonds. —During the past few years attention has been given
to two important diamond fields at Mabuki, in the Mwanza district,
and at Shinyanga, some 60 miles further south. The diamonds so
far recovered have been largely from gravel deposits in the vicinity
of kimberlite pipes, some of which are known to be definitely
diamantiferous.
Operations on the Mabuki deposits were commenced in 1925,
and some very fine stones up to 53 carats have been won. The
Shinyanga deposits are being actively developed at the Sultan
and Baobob mines, two miles south of Shinyanga. Both these
fields are favourably situated with regard to transport.
Of the total output of 24,432 metric carats in 1929, 23,166 were
obtained from the Mabuki deposits, the remaining 1,266 metric
carats being won from the claims at Shinyanga.
Gold. —The most important gold-bearing regions in Tanganyika
are in Iringa Province ; in Western Kondoa Irangi region, and in
the Mwanza-Tabora district, extending for a considerable distance
to the south and east of Lake Victoria. Both reef and placer
deposits are worked, but the present output is largely derived from
the alluvial diggings of the Lupa, iSira and Mawoga rivers in the
province of Iringa. Auriferous reefs occur in abundance in this
region, while recent drilling operations on the deeper alluvials of
the Sira River are stated to justify their exploitation on a large
scale by mechanical and hydraulicking methods.
The most important gold mine in the western Kondoa Irangi
region is that of Sekenke which, prior to 1914, produced gold to
the value of £200,000.
In 1929, the output amounted to 9,071 troy oz. fine.
Salt. —The main supply of salt comes from the springs of
Urinza, 55 miles east of Kigoma. A small amount is also obtained
from the evaporation of sea water in the coastal regions, while
considerable quantities are stated to be collected annually by
natives along Lake Eyassi and other smaller lakes along the Rift
Valley. Salt has a ready market throughout the Territory and in
the Congo.
The amount of salt produced during 1929 was 7,270 long tons.


Mica. —Good quality muscovite mica occurs in pegmatite veins
in the vicinity of Morogoro and elsewhere in the Uluguru
Mountains. Other occurrences are known in the Pare and
Usembara Mountains, and in the districts of Mpapwa, Iringa and
Ufipa. Ruby mica is worked at Mikesse.
The production is decreasing, being only 29 tons in 1929; it was
161 tons in 1912.
Tin ore. —High-grade alluvial tinstone was discovered at
Kyerwa, in the Bukoba district, in 1924, and since that year the
deposit has been actively developed. The deposit, which is at
present being systematically and thoroughly surveyed, occurs in
altered sediments of the Karagwe-Ankolian System continuous
with the same series in Uganda. Small shipments up to 50 tons
of high-grade concentrates averaging approximately 75 per cent,
of metallic tin are exported. During 1929 only 19 tons of tin ore
were exported.
Coal. —The most promising coal seams so far discovered in
Tanganyika are in the Ufipa (Rukwa) and the Songwe-Kivira
regions. Both fields are remotely situated from existing railways,
but it is stated that satisfactory progress has recently been made
towards the exploitation of the latter deposit.
Other minerals and metals.—Almandine garnet occurs at the
Luisenfelde mine in the Mikindani district, and also in the district
of Hindi; pyrope and beryl are stated to occur in the Shinyanga
district; lead ore is found near Ebndoa Irangi; large masses of
magnetite outcrop in the Ligunga Ridge, north of the Ruhuhu
River, and high-grade iron ore is reported from the Livingstone
Mountains ; soda occurs near Lake Natron ; copper ore is known fo
occur at a number of localities, especially in the Ukinga
Mountains and the Mpapwa district; graphite occurs in the Lindi
district of Lindi Province; china clay occurs in the Magoye
plateau; red ochre is produced near Arusha; amphibole asbestos
occurs in considerable quantity at Mpapwa; and silver is obtained
as a by-product in the refining of gold bullion.
A number of other minerals have also been recorded, while
considerable amounts of stone, lime, sand and brick earth are used
locally for building purposes. r
Kenya Colony.
Of the various mineral occurrences of Kenya Colony, the most
important from a commercial standpoint at present is that of
naturally occurring trona (carbonate and bicarbonate of soda) at
Lake Magadi. This deposit is stated to be the largest occurrence
of trona in the world. Other mineral occurrences in the Colony
include gold, silver, lead ore, corundum, gypsum, mica, limestone,
marble and diatomaceous earth.

(With tonnages in brackets.)
Soda. —The soda deposits of Lake Magadi are situated in approxi-
mately the centre of the Eift Valley and not far from the border
of Tanganyika Territory. The floor of the lake is covered with a
crust of practically pure trona which only needs to be freed by
draining or washing from the adherent liquid to yield a high-grade
material. Vast quantities of the solid crust are available, the
estimated reserves being stated to be 200 million tons, of which 40
million tons have been proved by bore holes over a distance of
30 square miles to a depth of 10 feet.


The material is won by means of two specially designed paddock
dredges, and is piped to a factory about half a mile away for sub-
sequent treatment, including tabling, calcination at 1,100°F.,
pulverization and bagging. The product can then be marketed as
soda ash. The output varies with the demand, but is normally
about 320 tons per day. Provision has been made for an annual
export of 160,000 tons. A detailed description of the Magadi
deposits, together with chemical analyses, will be found in the
Bulletin of the Imperial Institute, Yol. 21, 1923, pp. 431-444.
The quantity of calcined soda exported from Kilindini during
1929 amounted to 55,137 tons, as compared with 78,255 tons in
1928. Of the 1928 exports 47,050 tons went to Japan, 16,300 tons
to Australia, and 2,050 tons to China.
Gold. —Gold occurs in the Southern Masai reserve, and a small
battery was erected in 1926 to treat the deposits near Lolgorien.
Gold has recently been reported north of Kitale. The production
of gold in Kenya during 1929 amounted to 845 fine oz.
Graphite. —Large deposits of graphite are stated to occur in
Kenya, especially in the Taita and Ulu mountains. The mineral
has been worked at Tulimani Hill, in the Machakos district.
Mica. —Mica of good quality occurs in several parts of the Colony,
especially at Kenzi, near Sultan Hamud station, and near Chuka,
on the east side of Mount Kenya. Two tons were produced in
1929.
Diatomaceous earth. —Diatomaceous earth occurs extensively
along the Eift Valley from Lake Magadi to Lake Baringo, the
principal deposits being those near Lake Magadi itself; in Kedong
Valley; near Mile 61 on the Magadi Eailway line ; north of Lake
Naivasha; near Lakes Nakuru and Elmenteita; and in the valley
of the Sugota Elver, north of Baringo. The earth is used for the.
manufacture of roofing tiles which are stated to be made in large
numbers near Nairobi.
Other minerals. —Iron ore occurs in the Sarnia Hills and in
several other localities. Argentiferous galena has been exploited
about 20 miles inland from Kilifi. Limestone and good building
stones occur freely, and valuable clays are found in the Eift Valley.
Gypsum and corundum also occur.
Uganda.
Active prospecting during recent years has disclosed several
promising indications of minerals in the Uganda Protectorate, and
it has been estimated that during 1928 no less than 40 European
geologists, prospectors, and miners were engaged in the country,
the principal search being for possible extensions of the recently
discovered tin-bearing areas in the Ankole district.
The only mineral outputs for Uganda recorded during 1928 were
those of tin ore, amounting to 265 tons and valued at £44,166,
9043 D 2


and salt amounting to 2,034 tons. Considerable quantities of
various other minerals, including salt, iron ore, building sand, road
metal and china clay are stated to be quarried by the natives,
but no details as to the output of these are available.
The sources of imports and destinations of exports for Uganda
are included with those already given for Kenya.
Tin ore. —The recently discovered tinfield in Ankole is at present
being exploited. The deposits at Mwirasando, where a consider-
able amount of exploratory work has been carried out, consist of
irregular masses of pegmatites, quartz veins, etc., carrying cassi-
terite, the concentrates being stated to assay over 75 per cent,
metallic tin. The concentrates so far won have been as follows ;
for 1927, 115 tons; 1928, 265 tons; 1920, 321 tons.
Salt. —Salt is obtained from the salt lakes east of Lake Albert,
particularly in the districts of Toro and Bunyaro, and forms the
basis of a fairly extensive native trade.
Petroleum. —Oil seepages are known to occur in the Lake Albert
depression of the Eift Valley, and the surface indications of oil
are stated to be such as to warrant exploratory operations near
the apex of the Waki dome.
Other minerals. —Gold occurs in the gravels of the Eafu Eiver,
but the deposits so far discovered have proved to be unworkable.
Copper deposits have been discovered at Kilembi on the south
eastern flank of the Euwenzori Mountains, and finely disseminated
chalcopyiite is known to occur in the Nyarodi granite. Bismuto-
tantalite, a new mineral consisting of bismuth tantalate, has
recently been discovered at Gamba Hill, 35 miles north-west of
Entebbe.
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.
A good variety of mineral occurrences is recorded for the Anglo-
Egyptian Sudan, but mining development in that country has
hitherto been hindered by lack of water supplies and adequate
transport facilities.
There are numerous abandoned gold mines in the country, the
only gold mine that is being worked at present being that at Gabait,
where during the 20 months ended September 1929, the gold pro-
duced w r as valued at £29,076. Alluvial gold is won by natives in
various places along the Abyssinian border, notably near Fazogli.
Salt beds occur at various localities and salt production takes
place at Eowaya and Darra on the Eed Sea coast, where the output
during the year 1928-1929 totalled 12,284 tons.
Other recorded mineral occurrences include copper ore at Hofrat
el Nahas; gypsum in the coastal hills from Port Sudan to the
Egyptian border; lead ore at Jebel Kutum and antimonij ore at
Jebel Marra in Darfur Province ; natron at Wadi Natmm; alum
in the Shabb oasis; and lignite of poor quality in the Dongola
Province.


Somaliland Protectorate.
Up to the present there has been no output of minerals in
British Somaliland, excepting salt, which is obtained from sea
water. A number of economic minerals have, however, been
shown to occur and some of these may ultimately prove to be
commercially workable. The following is; a brief account of the
more important of these occurrences :
Petroleum. —An oil seepage at Dagaha Shabell near Berbera,
has been known for some years, and several reports have been
made upon the occurrence; but no drilling has been don© up to
the present.
Phosphate. —A deposit of phosphatic guano occurs on Mait
Island, just off the coast, and was worked for many years by the
Sultan of Makulla for use in fertilizing ground for tobacco culti-
vation.
Mica. —Mica of the muscovite variety has been found in several
areas, notably the Mirsa plateau and the Golis Range. In 1927,
a concession w r as granted to a syndicate to prospect a large area in
the latter district. Much work was done, but although a quantity
of mica was opened up, so little of it was of commercial quality
that the concession -was abandoned.
Salt. —Salt has been produced at Zeilah by solar evaporation
in pans, and there was formerly a considerable trade in the pro-
duct, but the methods adopted were crude and the industry has
declined. It has been shown, however that a high-grade product
could be produced, and a concession was granted in 1928 to a
holder w T ho intended to carry on the work systematically and in
accordance with modern practice. The exports of salt from
Somaliland during recent years have ranged up to 4,120 tons
annually and in 1929 were 3,100 tons.
Coal. —Coal has been found near Ankor and about 100 miles
further east at El Ham-Ham in Eocene limestone, but the extent
of the deposit is unknown and only surface samples have been
examined chemically.
Other minerals. —Other deposits of possible economic value in-
clude silver-lead ore, barytes, beryl and garnet. Considerable
deposits of limestone and marble are also known to exist in the
Protectorate.
Cyprus.
Evidence of ancient mining in Cyprus is widespread, and
numerous slag heaps, believed to be of Roman and Phoenician
origin, are known to occur, those at Skouriotissa and Mavrovouni
being each estimated at about a million tons. The Roman slag
is stated to contain 0.8 per cent, copper, whereas the Phoenician
is said to contain 1 to 1.25 per cent, copper.

A systematic examination of these slag-heap and ancient mining
districts, has led to the resumption of active mining operations in
Cyprus during modern times. Important deposits of cupriferous
iron pyrites, asbestos, umber and gypsum are being exploited, and
the mining outlook of the Colony is distinctly good.
The outputs of minerals in Cyprus during 1928 were as follows ;

Cupriferous iron pyrites. —Large deposits of cupriferous iron
pyrites are being exploited at Skouriotissa and Mavrovouni, the
output from the former locality having steadily increased from
36,789 tons of ore in 1922 to 288,110 tons in 1929, while that of
the Mavrovouni, which reached the producing stage in October,
1929, was 4,320 tons during that year.
The Skouriotissa deposit consists essentially of a lenticular mass
of cupriferous pyrites, 1,850 ft. long and 800 ft. wide., with a
maximum thickness of 140 ft. It has been developed by 45 drill
holes and 30 shafts and adits. A typical analysis of the ore is 1
stated to show 2.1 per cent, of copper and 48.5 per cent, of sulphur.
No appreciable amounts of arsenic or phosphorus are present.
The mine product is broken for shipment'and subjected to size
classification in a plant near Pendayia, on the shore of Morphou
Bay, some 6i miles from the mine. The crushing plant has a
capacity of 1,800 tons per 24 hours, and the sized material finds
a ready market in the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy,
where it is treated metallurgically.
The Mavrovouni mine is situated three miles west of
Skouriotissa mine and 2J miles from the mill and jetty. The
total footage of boreholes sunk on the property at the end of 1929.
was 4,786 ft. The total development of the mine was 7,356 ft.
Asbestos. —Important deposits of chrysotile asbestos of good
quality are being worked at Amiandos, in the Limassol district.
The asbestos occurs irregularly throughout a serpentine rock, and
forms a complex network of veinlets with an average fibre-length
of about i in. The fibres separate easily, and the finished material,
which is widely appreciated by manufacturers of asbestos-cement
and other building products, is conveyed from the mine to the
sea-port of Limassol by an aerial ropeway 18 miles in length.
The production of asbestos during 1929 amounted to 14,110
tons.
Gypsum. —Numerous workable deposits of gypsum occur in
Cyprus, and although the exports of this mineral are steadily de-
creasing year by year, it would appear that the internal consump-
tion is fairly extensive from the number of gypsum quarries work-
ing all over the island. The material is exported both in thei
raw state and as plaster of Paris. The shipments of gypsum
during 1929 amounted to 12,555 tons.
Terra umbra. —Deposits of terra umbra occur in various parts
of the island, but practically the whole of the output is obtained
from the Larnaca district, where the mineral is quarried by villagers
and sold to three exporting firms who either calcine it or ship it
in the raw state. The output is exported chiefly to the United
States, Great Britain and Italy for use in the manufacture of
paint. The exports in 1929 were 6,587 tons, as compared with
5,792 tons in the previous year.
Other minerals. —Other mineral occurrences of note in Cyprus
include magnesite, chromite, salt, ochre, terre verte and building
stones.

Palestine and Transjordan.
The only recorded mineral outputs for Palestine in 1928 -were
1,320 tons of gypsum and 1,628 tons of salt. A list of the more
important imports, showing sources, is given below. The exports
of minerals are insignificant.
Although as yet there is no mineral production of note in Pales-
tine and Transjordan, much interest has been shown recently in
the potash and phosphate resources, brief references to which are
made below.
Sources of the Principal Palestine Mineral Imports during 1928.
(With tonnages in brackets.)
Potash. —As a result of an investigation carried out some years
ago by E. W. Brock, it was estimated that the water of the Dead
Sea contains the following amounts of various salts in millions of
metric tons : —potassium chloride, 2,000; magnesium bromide, 980';
sodium chloride, 11,000; magnesium chloride, 22,000; and calcium
chloride, 6,000.
Operations for the purpose of the exploitation of these salts were
commenced recently. The object aimed at is a series of evapora-
tions by solar heat in shallow tanks, whereby common salt,
potassium chloride, magnesium chloride and magnesium bromide
will be successively precipitated; but in the first instance, attention
will be given to the production of potassium chloride only.
Water will be pumped from a depth of 250 ft., at a point not
far from the mouth of the Eiver Jordan, the evaporating tanks being
placed near by on the right bank. The products will first be trans-
ported by road to Jerusalem and then railed k> Jaffa for export, but
at a later date, if the scheme gets into working order, a railway
may be built along the right bank of the Jordan, to connect with
Beisan on the Hejaz Railway , so that shipments can be made from
the port of Haifa now being constructed.


Petroleum and asphalt. —Emanations of gas and seepages of oil
are known in several parts of the country, especially in the southern
part of the Dead Sea region. Oily bitumen drips from the dolomite
at Ain-gedi and Mas’ada and bituminous sandstone occurs on the
east shore of the Dead Sea and at Jebel Usdum.
Asphalt rock consisting of limestone impregnated with bitumen,
occurs near Mas’ada and in the Wadi Mahawat and elsewhere in
Palestine. On the Transjordan side, bituminous sandstone occurs
east of the Lisan and south of the Mojib. The quantities of
bitumen present in these deposits are unknown.
Bitumen of a jet-black colour and showing a conchoidal fracture
occurs distributed along the shore of the Dead Sea, but is found
chiefly near the Mojib on the Transjordan side or the Ain Jidi on
the Palestine side, which suggests an origin from strata below the
Dead Sea.
Phosphates. —Closely associated with the various bituminous
deposits in the Dead Sea area are extensive deposits of phosphates ,
consisting of beds containing bones, coprolites, etc., which are very
widespread. The principal deposits are found between Khan
Hatrura and Nedi Musa; at Deir Obied, east of Bethlehem; and
Kuru El Hajjar, east of Jebel Fereides.
In Transjordan, extensive phosphate deposits occur, especially
between El Salt and Amman, the capital of Transjordan. A con-
cession has been granted recently for the mining of these
phosphates. It is expected that 36,000 tons of rock will be mined
per year and transported to Haifa by the Hejaz Bailway. It has
been estimated that there are 18,000,000 tons of rock phosphate in
the vicinity of El Salt.
Gypsum. —Gypsum occurs widespread in Palestine, but only one
series of deposits at Melhamiya have proved of commercial
importance. There is a small output of this mineral, and in 1928,,
1,320 tons and in 1929, 1,475 tons were produced.
Rock salt. —A number of deposits of rock salt are known in
Palestine, the chief being a mountain of salt, the Jebel Usdum, to
the south-west of the Dead Sea. A number of exposures of salt
are known along the cliffs bordering the lagoon at the south end of
the Dead Sea, and a concession for working this is in operation.
Salt is being extracted from Mediterranean sea water at Athlit, the
Jewish colony near Haifa. The production of rock salt during 1929
amounted to 1,628 tons, and in 1929, to 2,468 tons.
Other minerals. —Other minerals of note that have been recorded
as occurring in Palestine include sulphur, copper ore, and various
building stones chiefly limestone.
Ceylon.
With the exception of graphite or plumbago, the known mineral
deposits of the Island are not considerable. There are, however,
valuable gem gravels from which precious and semi-precious stones
are obtained in great variety. Apart from these, salt is the most

important mineral product, but it is wholly obtained from sea-water.
On the sea beaches of the west coast there are natural concentrates
of black sand consisting largely of ilmenite, monazite and zircon
which have been exploited under Government supervision, and the
rare mineral thorianite has also been produced in commercial
quantities from gem gravels.
Figures for the production of minerals in Ceylon are not avail-
able. The values of the exports in 1928 include graphite (£203,030 1
and monazite (£555). The value of the output of salt during 1928
is estimated at £200,000. The annual value of the output of gem-
stones is estimated at £150,000.

Destinations of the Principal Ceylon Mineral Exports during 1928.
(With tonnages in brackets.)
Graphite or Plumbago. —The important deposits of graphite in
Ceylon occur in the west and south west of the Island, in a
mountainous area extending some 95 miles from north to south and
about 40 miles wide. The mineral occurs in veins, consisting
often of pure graphite. The veins vary considerably in
width from a fraction of an inch to several feet, some being more
in the nature of lenses. In the larger veins the mineral assumes a
coarse platy crystalline structure, and in the narrower ones it often
forms an aggregate of parallel needle-like crystals set at right
angles to the wall. Accessory minerals include quartz and pyrites.
Most of the mines are not more than 100 ft. deep, and are
exploited in a very primitive fashion. A few exceed 500 ft. in
depth and some of the larger ones are equipped with electricity and
modern machinery. The industry has been in a depressed state
for some years, owing largely to the development during the last
decade of the flake graphite deposits of Madagascar, which has
resulted in a fall in the price of graphite.
The exports in 1929 amounted to 12,739 long tons, as compared
with 14,347 tons in 1928.
Gemstones. —Ceylon gemstones are of many varieties, including
sapphire and ruby, chrysoheryl, topaz, tourmaline, zircon and
spinel, all of which occur in several different varieties and colours.
Almost all the gems are obtained from alluvial deposits in the
south-western portion of the island, chiefly from the Balangoda,
Eakwana and Eatnapura districts. The gem-mining industry is
carried on by the natives in rather crude fashion, all the operations
being carried out by hand. The stones are bought by Moorish
dealers and many are cut and polished locally. The better stones
are exported to Europe and America, and the poorer ones are dis-
posed of locally and in India.
Salt. —The consumption of salt in the Island is about 35,000 tons
a year, of which the bulk is usually made locally and the rest
obtained from Madras. The salt is obtained by the solar evapora-
tion of sea water, the industry being mainly carried on in the Jaffna
district of the Northern Province, at Hambantota in the Southern


Province, at Puttalam on the west coast and at Nilaveli on the
east coast. Up to 1919 the evaporation was carried out largely
by primitive native methods, but in that year the Government com-
menced a reorganization of the industry and began the erection of
more efficient salterns on the north and west coasts. This has
resulted in the improvement of both quantity and quality of the
product in recent years.
Monazite, ihnenite and zircon sands. —At several places on the
west coast of Ceylon there exist natural concentrations of heavy
mineral sands. In the vicinity of Bentota samples contained as
much as 47 per cent, of monazite, and in 1918 an electromagnetic
separator for treating the sand was installed and worked by the
Ceylon Government. Concentrated monazite sand was exported
for a few' years until demand and price fell. Ilmenite and zircon,
the by-products of this concentration process, accumulated in
dumps. There are large deposits of sand mainly composed of
ilmenite, the chief of which is that at Pulmoddai, north of
Trincomalee, where two million tons are said to be available.
These important deposits await exploitation.
Other minerals. —Among other economic minerals there are
deposits of high-grade limestone suitable for the manufacture of
cement in the Jaffna peninsula, while the coral limestones along
the coast are extensively burnt for lime. Iron ores are fairly
widely distributed, but individual deposits are small, the largest
being on the Kiribatgala estate, which is said to contain 50,000
tons. A sample of ore from this locality contained 54.6 per cent,
of iron, and would be suitable for making basic pig iron. Most of
the or© consists of surface deposits of lateritic ironstone, which in
the absence of local coal could not be smelted on the Island, and
could not be remuneratively exported to Europe. Mica of the
phlogopite variety occurs in the vicinity of Kandy.
British Malaya.
British Malaya includes the Straits Settlements, the Federated
Malay States and the Unfederated Malay States.
The Straits Settlements include Singapore, Penang, Malacca and
Christmas Island.
Tin ore is produced in Malacca, but the output is unimportant.
All the Malayan tin concentrates, however, are smelted either at
Singapore by the Straits Trading Company or at Penang by the
Eastern Smelting Company. Ore is also imported for smelting
from the Dutch East Indies, Siam and elsewhere. The refined
tin is known as “ Straits Tin,” and is exported to all parts of the
world.

The tin ore output of the Straits Settlements during 1928
amounted to 45 tons (metal content of ore), the smelter output for
that year being estimated at 100,000 tons. The smelter output for
1929 is estimated at about 105,000 tons.
The Federated Malay States is the most important producer of
tin ore, of which it contributes some 35 per cent, of the world’s
total output.
The country is particularly favoured from a mining point of view,
since many of the ore-bodies are comparatively rich and near the
surface, water for sluicing and other mining operations is plentiful,
labour is cheap, and transportation costs are relatively low. Trans-
port has improved considerably during recent years, and at the end
of 1929 there were 1,037 miles of railway, 2,734 miles of metalled
roads and 161 miles of un-metalled cart-roads, in addition to 1,957
miles of bridle-roads and paths. A main railway from Penang to
Singapore provides transport for machinery, etc., to most of the
important mining districts.
The chief minerals and metals produced in the Federated Malay
States are tin ore, coal and gold. The outputs of these during
1928 were as follows
Silver, tungsten ore, and china clay are also produced in the
Federated Malay States, but in less important amounts.
The Unfederated Malay States include Jobore, Kedah, Perils,
Kelantan and Trengganu. Although the development of these
States is not so far advanced as that of the Federated States,
important mineral occurrences are known, and deposits of tin,
iron ore, china clay, and wolfram are being exploited.
The mineral production of the Unfederated Malay States during
1928 was as follows :
Manganese ore and phosphate are also produced for export in
the Unfederated Malay States.

Destinations of the Principal British Malaya Mineral Exports
during 1928.
(With tonnages in brackets.)
Tin ore. —Tin ore is exploited in each of the Federated Malay
States, the number of mines at the end of December, 1929, being
579, in addition to 707 smaller workings employing no machinery
and less than 50 coolies each. Of the four States, namely Perak,
Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang, the first produces more
than the other three combined, the rich and easily worked deposits
of the Kinta Valley largely accounting for this predominance.

The concentrates won are usually very pure, assaying about
72 per cent, tin, and, with the exception of a small percentage
treated by Chinese smelters, are sent to Singapore and Penang
for smelting by the Straits Trading Company or the Eastern
Smelting Company.
The ore at present worked is for the most part of alluvial origin,
although highly productive veins are being exploited in the schists,
and a variety of interesting deposits are worked in the limestone.
The ore is won chiefly by gravel pumping and bucket-dredging,
these two methods accounting for some 80 per cent, of the output
in 1929. During the latter year, the proportions of output won
by various methods were as follows :
At the end of 1929 there were 105 bucket dredges in operation
and 10 under construction, as compared with 89 bucket dredges in
operation and 21 under construction in the previous year.
Since 1912 there has been a gradual decrease in the percentage
output by mines under Chinese management; thus in 1912, 80 per
cent, of the total output of tin ore of the Federated Malay States
was obtained from Chinese mines, whereas in 1929 only 39 per
cent, of the output was derived from this source. On many of the
Chinese mines the most primitive appliances are used, but there
has been an increasing tendency during recent years to instal more
modern equipment, although dredges have so far not been used by
the Chinese.
In consequence of the increasing difficulty of discovering new
dredging propositions in Malaya, efforts are continually being made
to improve the design of dredges with a view to decreasing working
costs and so making possible the development of low-grade proposi-
tions that would otherwise be unprofitable to work. The total
number of dredging companies in the Federated Malay States at
the end of 1920 was 79.
Occurrences of tin ore are known in all the Unfederated Malay
States. Most of the output during 1928 was obtained from the
States of Trengganu and Johore.
In Trengganu, tin ore occurs at the Bundi mine, near Kuala
Kemaman and at Bukit Tawang. Other deposits occur in the
vicinity of the Kemaman, Paka, Dungun and Trengganu rivers;
where lode and alluvial deposits have been found.
In Johore, tin is won by gravel pumps at Jemaluang and by
suction dredges in the Tingkil valley. Other occurrences are known
in the State, and there is reason to hope that further discoveries
will be made.


Tungsten ores. —Valuable deposits of tungsten ores occur both
as lode and detrital deposits in the Federated Malay States, the
present output being largely obtained as a by-product of tin
mining.
The chief localities where wolfram occurs are Bukit Eembian
in Perak; Ulu Klang, Ulu Langat, and Ulu Ranching in Selangor;
and Titi in Negri Sembilan. Scheelite occurs at Ampang and
Pulai in Perak and at Ranching, Ampang and Sungei Besi, in
Selangor.
Wolfram occurs in the Bukit Rachi mine in Redah and also
at Dungun and Chendrong in Trengganu. During the year ending
June, 1929, the exports of wolfram from Redah amounted to
73 tons, the exports from Trengganu for that year being valued
at £3,875.
Gold. —The only gold mine working on a large scale in Malaya
is the Eaub Mine, near Eaub, owned by the Eaub Australian Gold
Mining Company. The ore body is very irregular in width and
variable in value, and occurs as lenticular veins in calcareous shale.
The average grade of the ore is less than 3 dwt. of gold per short
ton, the output of gold in 1929 being 23,303 oz. The deepest and
best known shaft is the Bukit Roman, which is 940 feet deep.
Small quantities of mixed gold-tin ores are recovered at several
localities, notably at Batang Padang in Perak, and Malay
fossickers are stated to obtain negligible quantities of gold in the
Lipis area in Pahang.
Iron ore. —Important deposits of iron ore are known to occur
in the Unfederated Malay States, particularly in the States of
Johore and Trengganu, where a Japanese company is exploiting
haematite at Bukit Medan and Machang Satahun respectively.
The ore is exported chiefly to Japan. Iron ore of good quality,
containing 65 per cent, iron, is stated to occur at the Dungun mine
in Trengganu. An extensive deposit of haematite is reported to
occur at Temangan, some 40 miles up the Relantan River.
The long seaboard and proximity to Singapore of the State of
Johore are promising features in connection with the future develop-
ment of this State. During 1929, 743,209 tons of iron ore were
exported from Johore.
Manganese ore. —A deposit of manganese ore containing from
25 to 30 per cent, of manganese is being worked at Machang
Satabun in Trengganu. The exports of manganese ore from
Trengganu during the year ending June, 1929, w r ere valued at
£33,740.
Coal. —In the Federated Malay States, twn seams of non-coking
coal of good quality at Batu Hrang, near Ruala Lumpur, on the
Eawang coalfield are being exploited. The coal appears to be of
the lignitic or sub-bituminous variety. It is used chiefly by the
Federated Malav States railways and mines. Since 1915, over

41 million tons of coal have been produced. The reserves are
estimated to amount to at least 12,000,000 tons.
China clay. —China clay of good quality is found over extensive
areas in the south of Johore, and a small pottery and kiln under
Japanese management were erected in 1921 within eight miles of
Johore Bahru.
More recently, the Sungei Perpat deposits have been exploited
with a view to working up an export trade of India. There is a
growing demand for the clay for use as a filler in rubber factories
in Singapore. In 1926, 337 tons of china clay were shipped from
Sungei Perpat to Singapore. In 1928, 985 tons were exported
from the Unfederated Malay States; in 1929, 741 tons.
Phosphate deposits. —Phosphate deposits of importance are
wmrked on Christmas Island which lies about 190 miles south of
the western extremity of Java. These deposits are similar to those
occurring on Ocean Island. They contain on an average about
80 per cent, of tri-calcium phosphate. The output, which amounts
to about 120,000 tons annually, is exported to Japan.
Many of the limestone caves in the hills of North Kedah and
Perils contain rich deposits of phosphate which have been worked
for manure for some considerable time. Material from caves in
Bukit Kubang Tiga and Bukit Sinam contains 9 to 12 per cent,
of phosphoric acid, but material from other caves may have a
phosphoric acid content varying from 13 to 28 per cent.
The exports of phosphate from Perils during the year ending
June, 1929, amounted to 422 tons.
British Borneo.
The chief mineral outputs of British Borneo during 1928 were
739,227 tons of petroleum in Sarawak and 60,779 tons of coal in
North Borneo.
The values of the mineral exports from British Borneo during
1928 -were as follows :—•


Petroleum.— The petroleum-producing field of Sarawak is in
the Miri district and is of Tertiary age. Production began in
1912. The crude oil is delivered by a pipe-line to Lutong, where
a refinery was erected in 1917 and 1918, as well as a tank storage.
There are two 8-inch submarine pipe-lines for the shipment of
products.
Prom 1913 to 1919 inclusive, the gross output of crude oil
amounted to 444,269 tons. Subsequent years have shown a pro-
gressive increase from 148,633 tons in 1920 to 748,405 tons in
1929, or from 1920 to 1929 inclusive, a gross total of 5,394,509
tons.
In North Borneo, there are indications of petroleum in the
Elias Peninsula, and in the neighbourhoods of Kudak and Cowie
Harbour. Several deep wells have been sunk in the Elias Penin-
sula. Oil of good quality has been discovered, but not yet in:
commercial quantity. Drilling operations are in progress.
In the State of Brunei, drilling is in progress in the Tutong and
Belait districts. Two wells are now over 3,000 feet in depth,
but, up to the present, oil in commercial quantities has not been'
struck.
Coal. —Coal is the only mineral which is at present being mined
on a large scale in North Borneo. In 1901, 58 outcrops of coal
were found in the Serudong valley. In 1903, further deposits
were located in the Silimpopon River, a tributary of the Serudong.
and in 1905, a company was formed to work the Silimpopon seams.
The total reserves were then estimated at 98,000,000 tons. There
is an up-to-date plant on the mine, the gross output of which,
from 1920 to 1928 inclusive, amounted to 665,000 tons, or an
annual average of 74,000 tons.
The mines are worked by Chinese, under European supervision.
The coal is brought by a light railway from the pit-head to a load-
ing station on the river, and is then towed in barges to a depot on
Sebattik Island, which is accessible to large ocean-going steamers.
The chief coal mines of Sarawak are situated at Sadoug. The
coal is of Tertiary age and occurs as outcrop seams. It is used
for local and bunkering purposes, the output amounting to nearly
20,000 tons per annum.
Lignitic coal of Tertiary age occurs in the island of Labuan.
A syndicate was formed in 1928 to prospect and develop the
coal deposits in the Katendang range in Sarawak. The concession
extends over an area of 50 square miles, and is estimated to con-
tain 10,000,000 tons of coal.
Coal has up to the present been the only mineral worked in
Brunei. It was mined for some years at the Brooketon colliery,
owned by His Highness the Rajah of Sarawak. From 1920 to 1924,
inclusive, the output of coal amounted to 111,300 tons. In 1924,
the production amounted to 18,323 tons, 8,000 tons of which was
consumed at the colliery, the remainder being exported to Labuan


and Singapore. Mining ceased in 1924. A few hundred tons of coal
exported since has come from stocks.
Gold. —Auriferous deposits occur in the neighbourhood of Bau
and Bidi, in Upper Sarawak, 15 miles south-west of Bashing,
the capital. The gold occurs as irregular deposits in limestone,
and as impregnations in shale. For some years the deposits were
worked successfully. In 1905-1906, two mills, having a total
monthly capacity of 18,000 tons of ore, were running at Bau and
Bidi. Some years ago, however, the mines were abandoned,
chiefly on account of water trouble.
The gold produced since has been raised entirely by natives.
In 1926, there was an export of bullion containing 249 ounces of
gold, but there appears to have been none shipped since that year.
Gold in fine alluvial deposits occurs on the east coast, in the
vicinity of Darvel Bay, in North Borneo. In 1898, dredging
operations were conducted on the Segama River, but were later
abandoned. Prospecting for gold has been renewed recently, but
as yet there is no production.
Antimony Ore. —Antimony ores, chiefly stibnite, were formerly
produced at Bidi and other places in Sarawak. The veins were
worked from 1859 to 1915 inclusive, when approximately 30,000
tons of ore were raised, of the value of upwards of one million
sterling. No production has been recorded since 1915.
Manganese Ore. —Manganese ore was discovered at Tanjong
Batu, in the Maruda district, and was worked for a time by an
exploration company. The output in two years amounted to
65,000 tons, but the workings were subsequently abandoned owing
to shipping difficulties.
Quicksilver. —In Sarawak, cinnabar occurs in auriferous alluvial
deposits, in detritus, and, near Tegora and Gadong, in clay-
phyllites. The yield from alluvial and detrital deposits from 1868 to
1886 amounted to 13,620 flasks of quicksilver. There are no records
of production since 1886.
Other minerals. —Copper pyrites (chalcopyrite), sometimes asso-
ciated with zino blende and arsenopyrite, occurs at Karang and
in other localities.
Chromite occurs in small quantities at several localities.
Laterite occurs abundantly in the vicinity of the Lower Labuk
River, and at Karang.
Papua.
Gold was discovered in this territory in 1887 on the Laloki River.
Since then gold has been found in every division of the territory.
Copper ore has been exploited, and promising indications of the
occurrence of petroleum have received much attention in recent
years. A small amount of osmiridium has been recovered, and a
number of other economic mineral occurrences are known.


The mineral outputs during the year ended June, 1928, included
2,408 oz. of gold and 861 oz. of osmiridiuxn.
Gold. —The total output of gold in Papua from 1888 to the
end of June, 1828, amounted to 552,480 troy oz. valued at
£1,740,596.
At the present time practically no gold is recovered except in
the Louisiade and Murua fields, the output having dwindled to a
very small amount. Although most of the rivers of the territory
have been declared open for gold-dredging, for which prospects
are good in some places, especially with the confluence of streams
near the foothills of the principal ranges, no dredging has yet been
carried out. The high cost of transport has probably acted as a
deterrent in most cases.
Copper ore. —Copper ore has been produced chiefly in the Astro-
labe mineral field, in the Dubuna mine. A smelter has been
erected at Bootless, and the erection of an aerial railway from
Laloki to the coast was under consideration, but the nature of
the ore available, the high costs of extraction, and the low price
of copper recently necessitated the closing down of operations.
The total value of copper ore and blister copper exported from
this territory to June 30, 1928, was £366,405.
Petroleum. —The discovery of petroleum was first made in the
upper reaches of the Vialala Eiver, Gulf Division, and since then
a number of geologists have visited this area and made recom-
mendations for boring operations there, as well as in other parts
of the territory. At the present time, five companies have conces-
sions and are drilling for oil.
Osmiridium. —Osmiridium has been frequently recovered with
gold in the Northern Kumusi and Central Divisions. At the
present time it is being collected in small amounts, the estimated
output in the year 1927-28 being about 37 oz., valued at £550.
Other Minerals. —A number of other minerals known to exist in
Papua include coal, lignite, galena, graphite, natural sulphur,
blende and precious stones. There is evidence that large beds of
coal exist in the upper Kikori. Lignite was found in 1924 on
Smoky Creek, a tributary of the Era River. Lead ore (galena) is
known to occur in Woodlark, Misima and other divisions. • Zinc
ore (blende) has been found in a number of places, especially
Woodlark, Misima and the Gira. A number of deposits of iron
ore are known. Magnetite occurs on the south coast of Woodlark
Island near Sililoi, and haematite in the Eigo district. Some
excellent red oxide of iron has been exported. Appreciable
quantities of sulphur have been reported to occur in the volcanic
areas of the lamalele district, and it has been estimated that 42,000
tons are available on the surface near Seymour Bay.
Papua is abundantly supplied with water power, its reserves
being estimated at 10,000,000 h.p., but no use so far has been
made of it.


New Guinea.
Gold is the only mineral produced in New Guinea. The gold
deposits of the Territory consist of alluvial deposits in the beds of
creeks and rivers, raised beach deposits and lode formations which
generally run in a N.N.W. or S.S.W. direction. No important
deposits were known before 1928, but in that year were found the
Edie Greek plateau deposits, the richness of which may be judged
from the fact that, in the four years following their discovery in
February, 1926 to March, 1930, about 9J tons of fine gold was
produced by the crudest of hand methods only. Other gold-mining
is carried on, but at a lower altitude, on Nami, Eorang and Wan
creeks and on the Bulolo River, of which they are tributaries, as
well as on the upper tributaries of the Watut and Waria rivers.
Prior to 1927 communication between the coast and the work-
ings was by various trails across the mountains, all material being
carried by natives. The trail from Salamoa, for instance, is about
60 miles long, the journey, a most trying and difficult one, taking-
eight days. Since 1927, transport has been largely effected by
aeroplane services organized by a number of companies, the
journey from Salamoa only taking about one hour; eight or nine
aerodromes and landing-places have already been built in different
parts.
All gold-mining operations are carried on to the west of
Huon Gulf in the Morobe district, and the field is now' known as
the Bulolo Goldfield. This is being actively developed at the
present time and is of considerable interest from the standpoint
of potential gold production.
The output of gold from New Guinea for the year 1928-1929 to
June, 1930, amounted to 87,542 J ounces valued at £188,177, of
which 79,748 ounces valued at £179,433 exported.
Other mineral occurrences recorded in New Guinea include
osmiridium in the upper waters of the Waria, Francisco, Markham
and Eamu rivers; platinum in the Baining district of New Britain,
and also associated with gold in the Kabenau River which flows into
Astrolabe Bay ; tin and copper ores in the Baining district; sulphur
in a number of localities in the volcanic region, notably at Tavurvur
in Matupi Bay, Pangalu, and at Garau Harbour; magnetic iron ore
(72 per cent, iron and 0.04 per cent, phosphorus) in Kavit Range
in the Baining Mountains near the coast; phosphate on an island
of the Purdy group; broton coal near Astrolabe Bay, S.W. of
Madang, and also in the southern part of New Ireland; and mica
in various localities.
A considerable search has been made for petroleum, and at the
present time several concessions for drilling are held by different
companies, but results so far have not been satisfactory except in
one instance, although the geological conditions are favourable.
Several other concessions are held by companies searching for coal.

Western Pacific Islands.
Ocean Island and Nauru Island are important producers of rock
phosphate. The former island is a part of the Gilbert and Ellice
Islands Colony, while the latter is administered under mandate
from the League of Nations. In 1920 the right to work phosphate
on these islands was secured by a Board of Commissioners appointed
by the Governments of the United Kingdom, Australia and New
Zealand. The three Governments are entitled to allotments of the
output of phosphate for home consumption only in the proportion
United Kingdom and Australia 42 per cent, each, New Zealand
16 per cent.; but the United Kingdom does not avail itself of
supplies of this raw material because cheaper supplies are available
nearer at hand. Usually, Australia takes 70 to 75 per cent, of the
output and New Zealand 20 to 25 per cent., the rest being sold
elsewhere.
In 1928 the combined production was 543,715 long tons and in
1929, 552,835 long tons, so that the islands occupy the fifth position
in the list of world producers of phosphate rock. It has been
estimated that about 100 million tons of high-grade phosphate is
available on the islands, of which one-third is on Ocean Island.
The grade of the phosphate is high, cargoes from both islands
having consistently averaged from 85 to 88 per cent, of tribasio
calcium phosphate.
