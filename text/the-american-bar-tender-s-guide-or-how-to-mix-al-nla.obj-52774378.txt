PREFACE.
This is an Age of Progress ; new ideas and new
appliances follow each other in rapid succession.
Inventive genius is taxed to the uttermost in devising
new inventions, not alone for articles of utility of
necessity, but to meet the ever-increasing demands
for novelties which administer to creature-comfort and
afford gratification to fastidious tastes.
A new beverage is the pride of the Bar-Tender, and
its appreciation and adoption his crowning glory.
In this entirely New Edition will be found all the
latest efforts of the most prominent and successful
caterers to the tastes of those who patronise the
leading Bars and Wine-Booms of America, as well as
the old and standard favourite beverages, always in
general demand.

HINTS AND RULES
FOR BARTENDERS.
1. An efficient bartender’s first aim should be to
please his customers, paying particular attention to
meet the individual wishes of those whose tastes and
desires he has already watched and ascertained; and,
with those whose peculiarities he has had no oppor-
tunity of learning, he should politely inquire how they
wish their beverages served, and use his best judgment
in endeavoring to fulfil their desires to their entire
satisfaction. In this way he will not fail to acquire
popularity and success.
2. Ice must be washed clean before being used, and
then never touched with the hand, but placed in the
glass either with an ice-scoop or tongs.
3. Fancy drinks are usually ornamented with such
fruits as are in season. When a beverage requires to
be strained into a glass, the fruit is added after strain-
ing ; but when this is not the case, the fruit is intro-
duced into the glass at once. Fruit, of course, must
not be handled, but picked up with a silver spoon or
fork.
4. In preparing any kind of a hot drink, the glass
should always be first rinsed rapidly with hot water ;


Havelock Tobaccos. Dark and Aromatic.
if this is not done the drink cannot be served suffi-
ciently hot to suit a fastidious customer. Besides, the
heating of the glass will prevent it from breaking when
the boiling water is suddenly introduced.
5. In preparing cold drinks great discrimination
should be observed in the use of ice. As a general
rule, shaved ice should be used when spirits form the
principal ingredient of the drink, and no water is em-
ployed. When eggs, milk, wine, vermouth, seltzer or
other, mineral waters are used in preparing a drink, it
is better to use small lumps of ice, and these should
always be removed from the glass before serving to the
customer.
6. Sugar does not readily dissolve in spirits ; there-
fore, when making any kind of hot drink, put sufficient
boiling water in the glass to dissolve the sugar, before
you add the spirits.
7. When making cold mixed-drinks it is usually
better to dissolve the sugar with a little cold water,
before adding the spirits. This is not, however,
necessary when a quantity of shaved ice is used. In
making Cocktails the use of syrup has almost entirely
superseded white sugar.
8. When drinks are made with eggs, or milk, or both,
and hot wine or spirits is to be mixed with them, the
latter must always be poured upon the former gradually ,
and the mixture stirred briskly during the process;
otherwise the eggs and milk will curdle. This is more
particularly the case when large quantities of such
mixtures are to be prepared. Such drinks as “ English
Rum Flip,” “ Hot Egg Nogg ” and “ Mulled Wine,”
are sure to be spoiled unless these precautions are
observed.
9. In preparing Milk Punch or Egg Nogg in
quantity, the milk or eggs should be poured upon the


Havelock Tobaccos;
Finest Quality.
wine or spirits, very gradually, and continually beating
the mixture in order to mix the ingredients thoroughly.
10. When preparing cold Punch, the bowl should be
placed in a tin or metal vessel about the same depth
as the height of the bowl, the space between the bowl
and the vessel being packed with ice, and a little
rock-salt sprinkled over the surface, which has the
effect of producing a freezing mixture, much colder
than the plain ice. Towels may be pinned around the
exterior of the vessel, and the exposed surface of the
ice trimmed with fruit or leaves, giving the whole an
attractive appearance.
11. In case brandy, whiskey, or other liquors are to
be drawn for use direct from the wood, the cask
should be placed upon a skid, a substantial stand made
expressly for tlm purpose, and kept in a place where
the temperature is moderate and uniform.
12. Bottles containing liquor should be kept lyino-
down, in order to keep the corks moist, and prevent
the strength being lost by evaporation.
13. Casks containg Ale or Porter should be tapped
before placing them on the skid, and then allowed
sufficient time for the contents to settle and become
clear before using.
14. Champagne requires careful treatment. It is
not advisable to place more at a time on ice than is
likely to be used, because if removed from the ice and
again allowed to get warmer, a second icing injures
both flavor and strength.
15. When champagne has been well iced, it requires
a good deal of care in handling the bottles ; cold ren-
ders the glass brittle, and less able to withstand the
expansive pressure of the contents.
16. Bottles containing champagne, or any other brisk
wines, must be kept laying down ; if in an upright


Havelock 7 ObAOOOB. Petail Price, 6d., 1/- & 1/6 per ping.
position for any length of time, the corks become dry,
and the gas is liable to escape.
17. During the process of cooling sparkling wines,
the bottles should not be placed in direct contact with
the ice, because that portion of' the bottle which
touches the ice cools more rapidly than the remainder,
causing unequal contraction and consequent tendency
to crack.
18. When sparkling wines are served in the bottle
they should be put in an ice-pail, and the space be-
tween the bottles and pail filled with ice broken small.
When the bottle is entirely surrounded by ice, the
liability of cracking from unequal contraction does
not exist.
19. When Champagne is in occasional use, being
served by the glass or for mixing beverages, it is a
good plan to place the bottle on a rack, the neck
sloping downwards, and insert through the cork a
corkscrew syphon provided with a cut off* or faucet, by
the use of which a small portion may be drawn off* at
a time without allowing any escape of the gas.
20. Mineral waters contained in syphons should be
cooled gradually, and not allowed to stand in contact
with the ice. Although the syphons are constructed
of very thick glass, this very thickness, while affording
complete resistance to the expansion of the gas con-
tained, is the more liable to crack from unequal
contraction, when only one portion of the syphon is
touching the ice.
21. Cordials, Bitters, and Syrups should be cooled
gradually, and not laid upon ice. A moderate degree
of coolness is sufficient for these preparations, as they
are only used in small portions for mixing and
flavoring.


Havelock Tobaccos. Dark and Aromatic.
22. Claret, Rhine-Wines, Sherry, Port, etc., require
special attention. Their temperature should not be
too cold; and, when poured into glasses, the bottle
should be steadily handled, so that any sediment that
may be in the bottom of the bottle is not disturbed.
Bottles containing these wines, when laid away, should
be placed on their sides, to keep the corks moist.
23. Whiskey is usually kept directly on ice, but
brandy and other liquors require only a moderate
temperature'. Fine old Cognac loses its “ velvet” when
chilled.
24. The refreshing qualities, and flavor of Lager
beeer depend very largely on the manner of keeping
and handling. Casks or kegs containing it should be
kept at a temperature of about 40°. Lager is always
in its best condition when it comes from the brewer’s
ice-house. When carted through the streets on a hot
summer’s day, the temperature is quickly increased,
and it must then be stored in a refrigerator for three
or four days in order to reduce it to a proper temper-
ature before using.
25. When the consumption of a keg of beer is suf-
ficiently rapid, it is best drawn directly from the keg,
the first glass drawn being rejected. The tap must be
thoroughly cleansed before using; and, as soon as the
beer ceases to run freely, a vent is placed in the bung.
When, however, the keg has to stand in use for some
time before it becomes empty, a considerable amount
of gas will escape every time the vent is opened, and
the beer will soon become “flat, stale and unprofi-
table ”at least for the consumer. To obviate this, and
to keep the beer tolerably fresh to the end, the vent is
not used, but a tube is inserted in the vent-hole,
leading to a receiver or cylinder containing air, com-
pressed either by water-power or a hand force-pump.

This exerts a continual pressure on the surface of the
beer, and prevents the gas from rising. Too great an
amount of air-pressure should be avoided, because the
beer will be driven too forcibly through the tap, and
fill the glass with more froth and less beer than a
thirsty drinker would care to pay for.
The air in the cylinder should be drawn from a
pure source, by means of a tube, if necessary, leading
to the open air. The air in a cellar or even a close
apartment is rarely pure, and would have a decidedly
unwholesome effect on the beer.
26. Bottled Beer should be kept in a cool place or
in a refrigerator not in contact with the ice. The
bottles ought to stand upright, so that any sediment
will settle to the bottom. It is. therefore, not advisable
to pour the last dregs of the bottle into the glass.
27. Syrups are peculiarly attractive to ants, flies,
and other insects ; they should therefore, be kept in
closely corked vessels; and, when in bottles for use,
be kept in a cool place, properly corked, a rubber
cork being most convenient, and the bottles standing
upright in water. In this manner the bottles will be
out of the reach of insects of every kind.

For convenience, these proportions are mixed and kept
in a bottle, and a wine-glassful is used to each tumbler
of Tom and Jerry, instead of brandy plain.

»Sugar does not readily dissolve in spirits ; it is necessary, therefore, in making
hot toddy or punch to put in the water before the spirits, or at least sufficient of
the water to entirely dissolve the sugar, taking care to warm the glass before pour-
ing boiling water into it.
The best Hot Whisky Punch is made with pulverized rock-candy. This is
preferable to sugar, for any hot drink made of whisky or brandy.
fWhen this beverage is made for a number of persons to be used at table, it ought
always to be made with boiling water, and allowed to concoct and cool for a day or
two before it is put on the table. In this way, the materials get more intensely
amalgamated than cold water and cold whisky ever get.

Tea Punch.
(Use heated metal bowl.)
Take \ pint of good brandy.
\ pint of rum.
| pound of loaf sugar, dissolved in water.
1 ounce of best green tea.
1 quart of boiling water,
1 large lemon.
Infuse the tea in the water. Warm a silver or other
metal bowl until quite hot; place in it the brandy,
rum, sugar, and the juice of the lemon. The oil of the
lemon peel should be first obtained by rubbing with a
few lumps of the sugar. Set the contents of the bowl
on fire ; and while flaming, pour in the tea gradually,
stirring with a ladle. It will continue to burn for
some time, and should be ladled into glasses while in
that condition. A heated metal bowl will cause the
punch to burn longer than if a china bowl is used.
Punch a la Ford.
(For bottling.)
(A recipe from Beuson E. Hill, Esq., author of “ The Epicure's
Almanac.")
Take 3 dozen lemons. ,
2 pounds of loaf-sugar.
1 pint of Cognac.
1 pint of old Jamaica rum.
The lemons should have smooth rinds. Peel the
yellow rinds off quite thin with a sharp knife, place
them in an earthen vessel; add the sugar, and stir
thoroughly for nearly half an hour with a flat piece of
wood, to extract the essential oil. Pour boiling water
on, and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.


Havelock Tobaccos. Park and Aromatic.
Cut and squeeze the lemons, straining the juice from
the pips. Place the pips in a jug and pour boiling
water upon them to obtain the mucilage in which they
are enveloped. l
Pour one-half of the lemon juice into the syrup,
strain the water from the pips, and add it also to the
syrup, taking care also that the syrup is not too watery.
Next, add more sugar or more lemon juice, to make the
mixture according to the taste. Lastly add and stir
in the above amount of spirits to every three quarts
of the lemonade, and bottle.
This punch improves by age if kept in a cool cellar.
Punch. Jelly.
Take 1 quart of Punch a la Ford.
3 ounces of isinglass.
\ pint of water.
Dissolve the isinglass in the water, boiling ; add it
while hot to the punch, and then pour into jelly-
moulds, taking care they are not disturbed until the
jelly is completely set. J
In a similar manner, orange, lemon, or calf’s-foot
jelly can be converted into punch jelly, by using Punch
a la Ford, prepared with less lemon juice.
Punch Jelly is a very insinuating and deceptive
refreshment, because its strength is not appreciated
when partaking of it, and it must therefore be indulged
in with becoming moderation.

PREPARED PUNCH AND
PUNCH ESSENCES.
A glass of punch, with all the et c teras, is an excel-
lent thing ; the main difficulty about it is that, outside
of a well-appointed bar-room, the necessary ingredients
are not usually found ready to hand at the moment
when they are indispensable; and, even under the
most favorable circumstances, it is not every one that
knows the precise proportions and happy blending of
flavors that constitute a perfect glass of punch.
The enlightenment of the present day is full of
short-cuts to comfort, and all the impediments in the
way of enjoying a social glass of punch, compounded
according to the latest discoveries of the art, are ob-
viated by having a bottle of the desired nectar in a
concentrated essence form, ready brewed in exact pro-
portions, and nothing needed but a moderate supply
of hot or cold water,, or ice, to adjust it to the correct
strength and temperature, and a glass to receive the
welcome libation.
The following recipes for concocting the latest and
most improved varieties of punch are intended for
bottling for ready use. *
Directions for preparing such ingredients as are of
a compound nature will be found in the preceding
pages'.
