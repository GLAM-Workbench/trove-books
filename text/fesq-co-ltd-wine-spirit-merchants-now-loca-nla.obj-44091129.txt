EVERY REMOVAL BRINGS
REMINISCENCES
811 T is but natural that,
as one leaves the
home where many
years were spent,
there should come re-
miniscences of events
which mark the passage of
the years, even as the blazed
trail marks one’s journey
through the virgin forest.
Sentiment finds but little
space in modern business. The
old must give way to the new
- businesses and men, must
move with the times.
But it may be pardonable,
on such an occasion, to retro-
spect a little and to tell briefly
how the present firm of Fesq
& Co. was founded, and the
conditions under which it strove
and progressed.


A BIG “DEAL” IN RUM !
Going back to the days
when primitive buildings, strag-
gling beside poorly defined bul-
lock-tracks, comprised the City
of Sydney, we learn that the
enterprising GovernorMacquarie
set about many reforms in con-
struction and it is interesting
to record what an important
part spirits rum, particularly
played in his transactions.
Deciding that the growing
city needed an hospital, but
lacking the financial means, he
commissioned three well-known
citizens to erect the building,
and undertook to pay them by a
grant of 60,000 gallons of Bengal
Rum from the King’s Store.
They were, further, allowed to
land, duty free, for a term of
three years, all ardent spirits
required for a chain of public
houses which they built in the
city area to supply the needs of


the convicts and others who
worked on the job. Rum bought
by the syndicate for 3/- was re-
tailed at 40/- per gallon. Thus,
in 1824, the “ Rum Hospital,” as
it was called, was erected and it
it is estimated that the total
concessions to the enterprising
three amounted to £lOO,OOO.
Rum was for many years
an important article of barter
and it is held that what are
now valuable estates changed
hands for small supplies of the
coveted spirit.
With the passing of the
years to the period of the early
forties came more frequent
transport and an increase in the
variety and quality of Wines
and Spirits so that the blending,
breaking down and distributing
became quite a specialty, pro-
viding the opportunity which
George Fesq was not slow to
grasp.


THE TANK STREAM IN 1848
The Tank Stream had its source in “a spongy swamp" between King and Park Streets, and laterally towards
George and Castlereagh Streets. The bridge in the centre shows where Bridge Street now lies. The Stream
entered the harbor just beyond the end of the row of houses in the centre of the picture. The fence indicates the
position of Pitt Street, as at present.

KING STREET, SYDNEY, IN 1848
THE OLD TANK STREAM
Where the busy Pitt Street
now runs through the heart of
Australia’s largest city, the
Tank Stream ran placidly to
the Circular Quay. It was near
the head of this stream, or at a
site corresponding with the pre-
sent entrance of the Sydney
Arcade in King Street, that
George Fesq first commenced


his enterprise as a Wine and
Spirit Merchant in 1848.
By this time the City had
grown considerably and boasted
several “ important thorough-
fares.” It was then as now, a
maze of straggling by-ways
having neither plan nor sym-
metry, but unquestionably
picturesque.
The population of Sydney
in the early forties is given as
between forty and fifty thousand
that of N.S.W. being about
130,000.
The Wine and Spirit busi-
ness evidently flourished, for
the year 1858 marked a removal
to larger premises at 377 George
Street. It is of this period that
the first authentic record exists.
In 1861, George Fesq was
located at 375 George Street; in
1864, at 387 George Street; and
in 1867 and until 1871, the busi-
ness was controlled by Fesq
& Birrell at 387 and 393 George
Street.


The years 1875-1880 saw
George Fesq and John Rose
trading as Fesq, Birrell & Co.—
this time at 423 George Street.
From 1887 till ’9l, the busi-
ness was cortducted at 257 and
269 George Street, under the
title of Fesq and Co.
In 1898, premises were taken
at 111 Pitt Street—these being
vacated in 1910 for the removal
to 44-46 Clarence St, where Fesq
& Co.Ltd.remained until Kurnell
House was completed in 1920.
It may be mentioned, in re-
ference to the early days of the
Company, that George Fesq was
not afflicted with “ a rover’s
temperament,” but that the ap-
parent “alterations” in the
George Street addresses were
due to the system then in vogue
of altering street numbers as
new buildings were erected on
vacant blocks.


THE FESQ BUILDING AT
274-6 KENT STREET.
is a spacious, modern, brick-on-
stone structure of five floors.
The Cellars are devoted to the
storage of Champagne and other
sparkling wines, still wines and
Lager. The whole of the ground
floor is occupied by the offices.
The third floor carries case
goods and the Packing and De-
spatch Departments. The fourth
floor is given over to the vats
and bottling, and the top floor is
occupied by stocks of Bottling
Supplies, Jars and empties.
Modern in its every feature
it provides commodious and con-
venient housing for the great
Wine and Spirit business which
has developed out of that
humble beginning made by
George Fesq, near the banks of
the Old Tank Stream.
