TART OF THE REDSTONE HERMITAGE, NEAR ARELEY KINGS,


PREFACE.
HISTORIC WORCESTERSHIRE an attempt has been made
to collect and arrange, in chronological order, some of the
JL||| most important and interesting facts relating to the history of
:4as& " the county of Worcester ; while each section is complete in
itself, the whole book will, it is hoped, afford a fairly comprehensive
review of the history of the south-western portion of mid-England. There
are, however, many important incidents which, for want of space, have been
omitted. The narrative has not been brought beyond the year 1651,
although later events have been mentioned occasionally. Tradition, legend,
and folk-lore of necessity occupy an important place in a volume intended
for popular reading; but the causes underlying the social, political, and
religious changes which have passed over the county, from the time that
the Roman legions first entered the Severn valley down to the day of the
memorable fight, when, for the last time, the Cavaliers and Roundheads
met at Worcester, have been diligently sought for, and will, in most
instances, be found recorded. The sources of information are sufficiently
indicated in the foot-notes.
During the twelve months occupied in writing Historic Worcestershire,
I have received much kindness and hospitality from the inhabitants of my
native county, to all of whom, both individually and collectively, I beg to
tender my hearty thanks.
The thanks of the publishers and author are due to the ladies and
gentlemen who have kindly assisted in making the volume complete, either
by placing photographs and engravings at their disposal, or in giving infor-
mation, Acknowledgments are specially due to the Right Honourable The
Earl of Coventry: The Right Honourable Viscount Cobham; Sir Hugh and


Lady Gilzcan-Read ; the Misses Lines; the Revs. W. R. Atherton, E. Badger,
J, R. Burton, E. R. Dowdeswell, C. B. Holland, D. Vawdrey, and J. B.
Wilson ; Messrs. John Amphlet of Clent, W. B. Bickley, John Brinton,
A. B. Badger, John Corbett of Impney, J. A. Cossins, Joseph Hill, E. W.
Hopewell, Joseph Littlebury, G. Preen, James Nott, Sam Timmins, and
the late John Noakc. To Mr, John Cotton thanks are especially due,
not only for the interest he has taken in the work and for the help he
has rendered, but also for several excellent illustrations.

Owing to the philanthropic spirit of John Corbett, Esq., of Impney, female labour in the
fait works has been abolished. The inhabitants of the district caused a memorial window to

tEbe <3arben of England
aIEAUTIFUL for situation, the joy of the whole county,
Malvern I The Malverns are the highest and oldest hills
in Worcestershire, hence the most fitting starting-point for
Historic Worcestershire.
To reach the top of the hill from the town of Malvern,
we may go by the way of St. Anne’s well, by zigzag paths of
gradual ascent, or by the sUep winding valley between the North Hill and the
Worcestershire Beacon, till we reach the crystal spring, at the foot of the sugar-loaf
hill, higher by a thousand feet than the sea-level. Here the path turns
southwards, along a rough and stony foss, called by the natives “The Duke
of Gloucester’s Ditch,” in memory of that mighty hunter Gilbert de Clare, an
ancient lord of Malvern Chase. Another five hundred feet or so of climbing,
past portruding masses of volcanic rocks, hoary with age, verdant with a growth
of moss and lichens and stained with mineral silicates ; past banks “ whereon
the wild thyme grows, and the nodding violet blows,” among the bracken;
past dumps of “fuzzen,” as the rustics call the golden blooming gorse, which
here is ablaze with yellow blossoms in July and August, long after the
more common variety has ceased to bloom in the valleys below; at last, after
a short scramble up the rugged rocks, the summit of the “bald hill” is
reached.


Here there is always a refreshing breeze, and the air is pure and light
Had we made the ascent on an April day, when the sun was brightly
shining after a shower, and distant objects appeared near, we might, if especially
fortunate, have caught a glimpse of the top of the Mendip Hills full sixty
miles away, and of a high hill in Wiltshire almost as far off. Eastward, the
most distant summit that meets the eye, like a cloud upon the horizon, is
Bardon Hill in Leicestershire, The stormy hills of Wales, rising crest above
crest against the western sky, are best seen at sunset, when the golden orb
of day sinks behind the Black Mountains in the Brecknock Forest, and the
Peak of Pen-y-Cader is sharply defined against the glowing sky.
The glittering streak of water, sometimes visible towards the south-west, is
not the sea, but only a wide reach of the river Severn before it opens out
towards the Bristol Channel.
PASS BETWEEN THE WORCESTERSHIRE REACON AND THE NORTH 1TT1.1., MALVERN.
When Lord Macaulay referred to Malvern in his soul inspiring lay “The
Armada,” he wrote with knowledge, for he had stood upon the summit of the


Worcestershire Beacon and viewed with delight the distant prospect; he was
well within the mark in saying :
“ Till twelve lair counties saw the blaze on Malvern’s lonely height.”
A circle of sixty miles radius from Malvern includes portions of eighteen counties,
and the beacon fire, certainly, could be seen from Arthur’s Tower in Wilts, and from
the highest peak of the Mendip Hills; and, yet, the Malverns are not a very lofty range.
The terraced citadel, crowning the Herefordshire Beacon, rises thirteen hundred
and seventy feet above the usual level of the Severn, and the rocky summit
of the Worcestershire Beacon is only about fourteen hundred and forty feet
above the river.
Seated here then, w ith almost the whole of the county spread out before us, let us
try to call up some of the scenes in the geological history of Worcestershire.*
We are on some of the oldest rocks in the British Isles: here, at St.
David’s, the Wrekin, and in the north-west of Scotland, like islands out of the
sea, they rise through younger rocks, from a platform which extends throughout
the British Isles. Many a geological record has been inscribed on them, and
only with difficulty is it that we learn from them anything of the early age
when they were formed. What we do find is that in the far-off childhood of
the earth, the great processes of its life went on at Malvern and elsewhere
much as they do now, that lands were made, existed, and were worn away; that
volcanoes poured forth lavas, that the rocks so formed were altered, bent, broken,
and wrinkled into mountains, of which to-day only the uttermost wrecks remain.
Passing from this dim picture in which the outlines are so indefinite,
we turn to the next and see before us the waters of a sea stretching far and
wide, and covering almost the whole of Great Britain, but here, at Malvern,
beating against an island of the old rocks which extends northwards to the
district of the Lackey Hills. Around the island, sand and mud are being laid
down, which will form the quartzite of the Lickey, the green sandstones
of the Raggedstone, and the black shales of the Valley of the White-leaved
Oak. In the waters, growing together in forests which vie in size with those
of the giant sea-weeds, graceful sea-lilies wave their sinuous arms, trilobites

burrow in the mud, or curl into balls for protection against the terrible beaks
of the ancestors of the octopus, and in places, banks of coral fringe the
islands as they do to-day in the warm, clear waters of the Pacific. As these
creatures die, their skeletons accumulate to form the limestones of Dudley and
Abberlcy and of the undulating ground to the west of the Worcestershire Beacon.
For many a thousand years does this sea endure, but at last it rolls away
and a new scene is before us; dry land has taken the place of the sea, the
region which one day will be the British Isles lies in the heart of a great
continent, and in places there are great lakes. One of them lies to our west,
over Hereford and Western Worcestershire; in it water-scorpions, six feet long,
struggle for existence with grotesquely shaped fishes clad in armour of glittering scales,
Ages pass, and again, north and south of Worcestershire, there lies a deep
sea; in it are deposited the limestones and grits which shall form the Mendips
and Pennine Hills. Century gives place to century in untold numbers, and
at last another era arrives. The waters have grown shallow, England is a
network of lagoons and sluggish streams winding through low swamps hidden
under thick forest growth; there the gigantic scale-trees tower upwards
and the seal-trees widely spread their forking branches, dropping each
year their myriads of spores into the tangled growth below of ferns
and giant “horse-tails.” Year by year in Worcestershire, as elsewhere, trees
die down and decay into richest mould, which accumulates foot by foot
Now and again the swamps become covered by water, for the region is
gradually sinking; the mould is buried under sand and mud, which thicken
and thicken until at length they rise above the water into a new swamp; soon
it is covered by another forest growth, to decay and be buried as before.
And thus, as age follows age, are accumulated the materials which are to form
the coal measures of Dudley, Halesowen, and the Forest of Wyre.
Again a change greater than any which have gone before: the flat strata are
thrown into huge folds, and ranges of lofty mountains arise, the Pennine to the north,
the Mendips, 15000 feet high, to the south. The climate, too, has changed and be-
come arid, and now for long ages in Worcestershire there will be but desert wastes
where shifting lines of dunes drift before the burning winds, while here and there
for a lime a lake will form, into which will fall the fragments shattered from the


mountain crags* Such a deposit we see in the breccia of Clent and Abberley.
Later on, a larger late forms over Worcestershire, extending far to the north;
no streams run out of it, the stagnant waters become loaded with salt and
lime: at times, when the evaporation is very great, these are thrown down
and give rise to the rock-salt and gypsum deposits of Droitwicb, while the
sand and mud brought in by the rivers are coloured by the widely diffused
iron, and form the red sandstones of Bromsgrove and the sheets of red marl
which stretch from Malvern to Tewkesbury, Birmingham, and Warwick, giving
the landscape that warm, red colour so characteristic of Worcestershire scenery.
And now another change: the sea creeps up from the south, breaches the
great barrier of the Mendip range and uniting with the salt lake converts it
into a gulf. For many a long age again does this endure, now smaller, now
larger, until the Malverns are submerged in an ocean of profound depth. In
these waters are deposited the blue limestones and clays of Tewkesbury and
Pershore, then the yellow oolites of Bredon, last the white chalk,, long since
washed away from the county; ammonites float over the waves in their beautiful
shells, battles are fought at Worcester and Evesham by the fierce sea-reptiles,
bat-like creatures hurtle through the air, and other reptiles, half-birds, jumping
like kangaroos on hind legs and tail, pursue their prey on the shores of
Malvern when it emerges from the waves.
But still the geological changes ring, the sea retreats and land appears,
formed by the white chalk. In the subsequent ages, while the clays which
underlie London, and the sands of Bournemouth are forming in the lagoons
of southern England, and lavas are streaming over Antrim, here, in Worcester-
shire, the land is being carved into much the shape which it has now.
Valleys are cut and the rocks gradually washed away; the chalk disappears
entirely, the oolites and lias very largely, the escarpment of the latter moving
eastwards from Malvern to the line where runs the bulwark of the Cotswolds.
The older rocks are uncovered, and often, in virtue of their superior hardness,
resist attack better than the younger and softer beds j thus have originated
the hills of the Lower Lickey, Abberley, Dudley, and Malvern.
Yet another picture; we see Worcestershire now covered for nearly the year
round by ice and snow, instead of by tropical plants, while the mammoth


and woolly rhinoceros replace the antelopes and three-toed horses : the sea, too,
a last time invades the county, and runs up between the Malverns and the
Cotswolds into the valley of the Dee. Glaciers creep down these straits from
the high ground and break int i icebergs, carrying far into Worcestershire the
boulders an d debris which have fallen on them from the mountains of A ales.
But at last the land emerges from the waters, covered with the debris which
has been scattered over it; the glaciers disappear, the Severn, diverted from
its ancient course into the Dee, bends southward and cuts its way past
Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth to Worcester and the Bristol Channel. The veil
of sand and gravel is slowly worn away from the old land-surfaces which they
have covered, until at length, but for the dense forests which spring up and
the marshes left by the retreating sea, the scenery which meets the eyes of the
Ancient Britons, who come with their polished stone implements along the river
valleys of Worcestershire, is almost exactly that which we view' to day.
Within historic times the tide flowed higher up the Severn than it does at
present, and Longdon Marsh, where sea shells and salt-marsh plants are still
found, w r as once a tidal back water of the river.* The Marsh formerly covered
more than ten thousand acres of land, and even now, that a great portion
of it has been drained and enclosed, it is one of the wildest tracts in Wor-
cestershire. The forests disappeared, the furnaces of Droitwich consuming much
of the timber, the land was brought under cultivation, first by the early
settlers, then by the Monks, and finally by the post-reformation farmers.
We, who now look on Worcestershire, may well exclaim, Ditrina gloria run’s /
The glory of the county has in it something divine. .Looking eastwards from
Malvern, across the valley, we recall Mrs. Browning's lines.
“All the fields
Are lied up fast with hedges, nosegay-like ;
The hills are crumpled plains, the plains parterres.
The trees, round, woolly, ready to be clipped,
And if you seek for any wilderness
You find, at best, a park.
A nature tamed."

impress of their characters upon the land wherein they dwelt. It is the
association of fact and legend with the places around us that gives a charm
to travel, localising historical events, and impressing them upon the memory.
With the living map still before us, we may mark most of the places in
the county associated with its history; every village has a story, every town
a chronicle. From this hill-top we may open the book of history and read
of the men whose deeds stand there recorded by the hand of Fame, Above
the thin veil of smoke where Worcester extends its city streets along the
Severn side rise the slender spire of St. Andrew’s and the grey Cathedral
tower. Many a saintly bishop, many a holy monk, many a great noble, and
many a worthy citizen sleep beneath the shadow of that tower. St, Oswald,
reformer of monasteries, St. Wulfstan, best and greatest of Saxon clerics, King
John, granter of English liberties, Arthur, Prince of Wales, enshrined in sculp-
tured marble, the gallant Sir John Beauchamp, the nonjuror Thomas Maurice,
whose grave is marked by the single word u mlserrimus,” most wretched;
Bishop Hough, defender of the English Constitution, Lord Dudley the munifi-
cent, and Lord Lyttelton the worthy scion of an illustrious house.
It was at Worcester that the Romans planted a fortified station to guard
the Severn ford; it was there that King Alfred’s daughter rebuilt the old
walls which the Danes had breached; there the Conqueror kept the Christmas
festival; there King Stephen gave his royal ring—an Easter offering; there
Henry 11. last wore his crown before placing it on the Altar of the Church;
there Queen Elizabeth was entertained right royally; there for the last time
Cavalier and Roundhead met on the battle-field ; and there, in the piping times
of peace, King George 111. extended his royal favour to the musical festival
of the Three Choirs, and encouraged the manufacture of beautiful Worcester
porcelain.
Further down the river, to the south, the low and massive Norman tower
of Tewkesbury Abbey Church marks the junction of the Severn and the Avon
and the boundary of Gloucestershire and Worcestershire.

tower and a single ruined arch marking the site of the once wealthy Abbey
where Eoves, the Saxon swine-herd, saw the beatific vision, and Clement Lich-
field, last but one of an illustrious line of mitred abbots, resigned his office
rather than surrender his House to the will of Henry VIII. Near Evesham
is the field upon which Simon de Montfort, dear to Englishmen, fell fighting
for English liberties. At Pershore, only a few miles distant, formerly stood
another noble Abbey, protecting the bones of a fair Saxon Princess St.
Eadburga. A portion of the Church yet remains as a memorial of the piety
of Saxon Christians.
Fladbury and Bredon monasteries have shared the same fate as Pershore,
but the trenches of the Roman camp, crowning the summit of Bredon Hill,
remain a more' enduring monument. Nearer Malvern the village of Hanley,
once famous for a castle, held by the Beauchamps and by “Warwick the Ring
Maker,” and memorable as the home of persecuting Bishop Bonner, retains little
of a fortress but the name.

the wide-spreading Chase of Malvern, full of memories of forest laws and

HISTORIC WORCESTERSHIRE.


Each English shire exhibits in a more or less marked degree some
characteristic distinguishing it from other portions of the country. It has been
truly said of Worcestershire, that it combines within itself more of the elements
of English life than any other county. Here are the mines and hardware
manufactories of the north, where countless implements of iron and steel, from
a tiny needle or fish hook to a gigantic bridge are made; the teeming popu-
lation and the numerous trades of the “ Black Country,” as well as the pastures,
cornfields, orchards, hop-yards, and quiet villages of the southern plains.
Art industries flourish in the towns; gloves, carriages and the dainty porcelain
of Worcester, the delicate glass of Stourbridge, and the luxurious carpets of
Kidderminster, are as celebrated as the Worcestershire hops, fruit, and flowers,
products of the rich meadows of the vales of Severn, Avon, and the Teme,
products which long ago earned for this favoured county the title of " The
Garden of England.”


Gbe TRomaus in Worcestershire,
A|A HEN the Romans commenced the conquest of Britain
orcest:erii^re did present many attractions for them;
/nWAW/C die greater part of the country between the Foss Way and
a^vern Hills was covered with forest and morass through
which the sluggish waters of the Severn, and its tributary the
Avon passed, often flooding the lands and spreading a rich
alluvial deposit over the low-lying meadows. Upon the hill tops, or in clearings
in the forest lived the people of this almost impenetrable country, a hardy
Keltic race, known to us only by the Latinized names given to them'by their
invaders : these clan names, indeed, were numerous, but probably there were
fewer dynasties and peoples in Britain in historic times than would appear
from the long lists that have come down to us.* Some of the names are
descriptive only of the particular part of the country occupied by the tribes
referred to and have no race significance. This seems to have been the case in
Worcestershire and in the counties contiguous to it. But Worcestershire as at
present defined was unknown in the time of the Romans. The tract of land
now called by this name appears to have formed part of the territories of four
ancient British tribes,-“the Cornavii, the Dobuni, the Silures, and the OrdoviceSj
This information is derived from the geography of a Greek writer who lived
in the first part of the second century (a.d, i 39 -1 6i), Ptolemy of Alexandria,
whose observations, however, are not very precise, as may be judged by the
following literal translation from the original Greek;
*C. H. Pearson. Historical Maps of England, 5869.


“ More to the east than these (the Ordivices) are the Cornavii and then
towns Deva (Chester). (The station of) the Twentieth Legion (called) the
Victorious, and Uriconiutn (Wroxeter).”
“ More easterly than these (the Demetae, of south-west Wales) are the
Silures, whose town is Bullacum (perhaps Usk in Monmouthshire), next to
them are the Dobuni and the town Corinium (Cirencester).”
“ South of these (the Brigantes of Yorkshire) but the most western are
situated the Ordovices among whom are the following towns, Mediolanium
(perhaps Llan-Vethlin in Montgomery) and Brannogenium (probably Ludlow).”
According to the antiquary Camden, the Cornavii were the people dwelling
on the horn of land stretching from the Mersey on the north, to the Avon
on the south ; from the Severn and the Dee on the west to the Derwent
and the Tren 1 : on the cast. The Cornavii therefore, if this statement be correct,
occupied the greater portion of the present county.
The Dobuni, who dwelt in the Severn Valley, chiefly in Gloucestershire,
and, also, in Oxfordshire in the upper valleys of the Thames, derived their
name from their home in this deep country. The Welsh dwfn meaning the
deep, the f being a Welsh permutation of £, it is easy to understand how
the name took its Latin form.
How far the Dobuni penetrated into Worcestershire we do not know; the
Avon seems to have formed a natural boundary- to their country on the north.
The Silures of South Wales, a brave . and warlike people, appear to have
claimed the land eastwards as far as the Severn, Malvern Chase being
probably a debatable country between the clans. The Ordovices, called by the
Roman historians, a timid people, lived in North Wales, but their territories seem to
have extended to those of the Cornavii and the Silures, and at one time they may
have occupied the wedge-shaped piece of land between the rivers Severn and Teme.
There is little doubt that the Silures and the Cornavii belonged to the same
stock; they were the Kymry, and it seems most likely that the greater part
of Shropshire, Worcestershire, and Gloucestershire was peopled by this race at
the lime of the Roman invasion. There appears also to have been a
connection of some kind between these people and the brave tribes in the
cast, and it is significant that both Caratacus and Yorligern, both connected


with eastern Britain when we first meet them later in their history fall back on
Wales for support. At present the history of these tribes is shrouded in
mystery, and it is impossible to define exactly the boundaries of their respective
territories, because those boundaries were constantly changing. Probably the
tribesmen dwelling in this midland district were not very numerous, since there
are few traces of Roman settlements in the county, and no Roman remains
which will at all compare in extent with those in the neighbouring counties of
Gloucester and Salop. It is well known that the Romans settled only where
there was a population to govern and to tax, or where the earth would yield
her riches to their industry. In this land there were no towns of much
importance, and not much to be gained, so the Romans, after they had
conquered it, sought the higher district of the Cotswolds and the more open
valley of Gloucester, leaving Worcestershire chiefly to the Kymry who had taken
refuge among the woods and inaccessible hills.
On the other hand it is certain that Worcestershire was not all swamp and forest and
that at some time during the 400 years of Roman occupation the conquerors made
roads through the waste places, planted military stations along the roads and rivers
and settled at Worcester, at Droitwich, and at Alcester, a little way across the
present county boundary. From a number of small objects of Roman workmanship
dug up here and there upon the line of the old roads we may learn something
of the manner of life led by the Romans and the Romanized Britons in Worcester-
shire. A bronze statuette of Jupiter found near the border of Herefordshire, a
bronze household god (Penates) found at Worcester, and an ivory ticket which
admitted the citizens of Alauna, or Alcester, to their theatre, testify to this district
having been a seat of Roman idolatry and civilization. An inscribed stone at
Kempsey, bearing the name of the Emperor Constantine the Great, points to the
early introduction of Christianity into this part of Britain, while bright and
wholly unworn gold and silver coins of Constantius, Julianus Valentinianus,
Valens, and Gratianus, part of a large deposit of such money, found near the
Littletons, recall the troubles which beset the Lower Empire necessitating the
concealment of a Roman military chest, or, perhaps, a miser’s hoard.*

At several places along the Severn, where beds of cinders and scoriae yielding iron
have been found, it is supposed the Romans established iron furnaces, using wood
from the forests to feed the fires; since it was easier to bring ore to the forest than to
carry timber to the mines. The value of the red Worcestershire clay was evidently
known to these wonderful people, since a Roman kiln and many specimens of
Roman pottery have been unearthed at Worcester. But, undoubtedly, the most
important industry fostered in this county by the Conquerors of the World
was the making of salt at Droitwich. Near to that town tesselated pave-
ments have been laid bare, proving it to have been a Roman settlement.
The rectangular camp surmounting the hill at Hanbury seems to have been
occupied first by the Britons and afterwards by their conquerors;* it may

have been the camp of the garrison stationed at the salt town and have
served the same purpose as the fortification at Oldbury, near St. John’s

of our county.* From Hanbury Churchyard the view over the beautiful pastoral
and woodland county is still as fine as any in Worcestershire; the prospect
can be but little altered since the
days when the Roman Legions en-
camped upon this favoured spot.
Slight as are the traces of the Ro-
man occupation of Worcestershire,
still less are the vestiges of the
older inhabitants, but enough is
left to enable us to picture the
kind of life they led. The
grave! beds and ancient river
bottoms yield remains of animals
of the chase, and of tools and
weapons used by our British
forefathers, and we may even
take a peep into the dressing
room of a native warrior, and
examine his paint pot and the
paint wiih which he adorned his
body before going into battle.t

their shell-like boats of wicker framework, covered with oiled cloth or leather,
on the ancient British plan.
Among the animals which roamed over Worcestershire, as elsewhere in England,
in prehistoric times were the river-horse, the mammoth, and the reindeer.
Bones of the river-horse and the mammoth and the antlers of a reindeer have
been found in gravel beds along the Avon. The reindeer may have been
drowned in attempting to cross the river during flood time or in a migration
to, or from, more northern latitudes, and its existence here points to the
change which our climate has undergone. In later times the red deer, wild
boar, and wolf made lairs in the forest, where their bones have been found.
A bronze bracelet, a slate wrist-guard used to protect the wrist from the
rebounding bowstring, a number of bronze celts, and polished and bored stones,
dug up in various places, help us to form an idea of the adornments, weapons
and pursuits of the Britons. At Tutnall {? Toot knoll), near Bromsgrove, arrow
heads of flint, ring stones for nets, and a large stone hammer have been
discovered; in the gravel bed at Daddley, east of Worcester, a few flint celts
and amber beads have been unearthed, and at Grimley, near Bever Island on
the Severn, a stone axe, which may have been a mighty weapon of some
prehistoric hunter.
The plains and hills furnish a few names of British origin, Pendock,
Pengethly, Pencraig. Pen, a head, a term applied to hills; Powick (Poincgwic
in a Saxon charter) may be derived from Pone a hill; Pull Court, the Rhydd ;
Tut hill, hill of observation ; Ankerdine, properly Onkerden, the fort on the hill
with steep sides; Malvern, Moel-vern, hill of judgment, a place of ancient
sepulture, perhaps of worship also; Hob Hill, near Beoley, popularly supposed
to be the hobgoblins' home. The hills, moreover, furnish not names alone,
but many entrenched camps,—lasting evidences of the handiwork of our
Keltic ancestors,“-earthworks which, owing to their elevated situation, have
escaped the levelling effects of cultivation better than the structures in the
valleys. The county people still point to mounds and ; ‘burys” on the
uplands as silent witnesses of many an ancient battle. But no better
example of a British stronghold can be found in this county than the camp
on Malvern hills. Some say that at Cadbury Banks, in the parish of


Eldersfield, six miles from Tewkesbury, may be seen remains of defences
similar to those of a British town described by Roman historians. Gadbury is
an isolated hill, about sixty feet high, of an irregular oval shape, slightly rounded
at the corners, about 39 ° yards long by 112 wide; a rampart and a ditch
surround this area. The top is level, and the sides are steep and
thickly covered with trees, except on the south-west and part of the
south-east sides. A hollow way, or deep lane, leads into the enclosure on the
south. The twisted branches of an old yew tree hang over the path, giving
it a weird aspect in keeping with the historical associations of the place.
Looking at the hill from a distance, no one would suppose that there was
any land free from wood at the top, and the hollow way is deep, almost
hidden, and hard to find. Here the ancient Britons may have built their
wattle and dab huts, herded their cattle, and dwelt securely in their forest
amphitheatre, till the Romans tracked them home, after some daring raid,
perhaps, and revenged their insults by a general massacre.
The name —Gadbury (? God’s hill, cf, Gad’s hill)—seems to have a religious
rather than a military significance, and to be of Saxon origin ; like Wcdnesbury
(Wodensbury) it may imply that the hill top first fortified by the Britons had
been used as a place of worship by their conquerors in later times.
The position of Gadbury had no strategical importance, and the place was
abandoned, but there was another British settlement on a little mound by a
ford or passage of the Severn, which seems to have attracted the Romans ;
that settlement is now called Worcester.
No vestiges of the primitive buildings of the British town can be found,
hut language, more enduring than the works of man’s hands, testifies to the
British origin of Worcester in the place names of the old city.* These
Kyraric names cluster about the river banks. Do/day, a street on the eastern
side of the Severn, signifies <f the house in the meadow at the bend of the
river.” Cold Comfort , an ancient horse and footway in St. Clements’ is
Coei-cwm-ffordd, 11 the road through the wooded hollow,” Turkey , a street

mark the site of the fort that guarded the ford of the Severn, Bedivardine ,
at the western entrance to Worcester, is supposed to mean “ the fort within
the encampment of the quickset hedge." If this be so we have quite a
picture of the home of our Keltic ancestors answering to the description given
by Cscsar of the enclosed villages in the forests, a mound, a palisade, a
prickly hedge, no mean defence even against Roman soldiers.
In underground Worcester, six feet below the present surface of the soil,
lie the remains of the Roman town, bonded w r ork underlying later masonry,
roofing tiles marked with familiar potters' marks, clay water pipes, fibulae of
bronze, coins, and various smalt articles of Roman workmanship. But, perhaps,
the most incontestable proof of all, a street pavement of adamantine hardness,
made of iron cinders, lime, and coarse gravel, underlies the present High
street and Broad street. Old buried roads lie under the more modern roads
at Sidbury and at Hylton Road; the former being twelve, the latter six feet,
below the present level.
It remains for future generations to thoroughly explore the hidden treasures
of the buried city, Worcester, like Silchester, may yet furnish proof
incontestable of the extent to which Roman civilization and refinement had
spread in this remote province of the empire fourteen centuries ago. It is
by no means improbable, although no evidence has yet been brought to bear
on this point, that the church of Worcester, as is the case in so many
Roman cities, occupies the site of an ancient Pagan temple, and that where
the music of the Christian service now echoes through the vaulted aisles
the priests of Jupiter, or of Diana, offered sacrifice to the deities of ancient
Rome.
It is remarkable how completely the remains of Roman settlements have
disappeared from the surface of Worcestershire. This disappearance, perhaps,
may have been caused partly by the low and treacherous ground chosen by
the Romans for their military posts along the Severn and Avon, and partly,
perhaps, by the industry of Saxon husbandmen and of the monks and their
tenants. It is believed that there are at least two important stations lost in
Worcestershire; the one Ad Antonam, stated by Richard of Cirencester to
have been ao Roman miles from Glevum (Gloucester), and 14 from Alauna


(Alcester), the other Upocossa, or Ypocessa Civitas of Ravennas. Ad Antonam
is believed to have been on the hank of the Avon not far from Evesham, but
its exact site is not known. Coins, pottery, and other indications of a Roman
population ■ have been found upon the high ground about the Littletons and
Offenham. At Harvington Mill a cinder bed and other indications of an
ancient smelting furnace have ■ been found.* Stukeley, an antiquary who,
visited the spot in the eighteenth century, judging from earthworks, &c., then
existing, thought that at Upton-on’Severn he had found the lost Upocessa.

In Worcestershire there are many old roads, some, once among the most
important highways in the land are now reduced to footpaths through fields
and in some instances lost entirely, while others still retain their traffic as of
old. To understand the purpose of these ancient roads we must traverse
distant shires before ive come to our own, we must also consider the habits of
the people by whom the roads were made. From the remains of ancient


settlements and by comparing the habits of the Irish and the Keltic
Highlanders of Scotland in the middle ages with the little that is known
about the early inhabitants of Britain, it is possible to form a fairly correct
idea of the mode of life and degree of civilization of the Britons. These
people lived in septs or clans collected round a petty chieftain, each clan
being nominally dependent on some more powerful ruler who had induced a
certain number of clans to acknowledge his sovereignity, but there was no tie
of union stronger than that of kinship or the temporary interests of war.
In times of danger the people took refuge with their chief in the forest
fastnesses, or upon hills in the least accessible places in their territory, in
places like Malvern, Clent, or Bredon. They lived in villages or wics, in
huts or caves in the rocks and not in towns as we understand the term,
although some of the villages, Cadbury or Worcester for instance, must have
been of considerable extent and better protected than the smaller collections of
huts, but the manner of life of the people was patriarchal, not corporate.
Under the Romans, on the contrary, the chief people lived in cities and
towns, defended by lofty stone walls, and possessing independent municipal
government, republican in form, but united under the Empire through the fiscal
government of the province to which they were tributary. The cities were
inhabited chiefly by foreign immigrants who were expected to defend themselves
if attacked.
Under the Romans the country was unimportant, the towns important. It
was from places like Gloucester, Cirencester, and Chester that the military
expeditions started when a fresh portion of the province had to be conquered,
or an insurrection subdued ; and after a colony had been founded one of the first
things to be done was the repairing or making of the roads connecting it with
other centres of population. From the Roman camps roads diverged in several
directions, and some of these ancient ways after a lapse of nearly two thousand
years may yet be traced in Worcestershire.
In like manner tracks also diverged from the British camps. The British
roads were often ridgeways, that is they followed the ridges of the hills where the
country was open and an enemy could be seen from a greater distance than in
the plams below, a track not liable to floods, not likely to afford an ambush

to an enemy, or a lair for a wild beast. Such a track, perhaps, may be seen
at Redditch, from Headless Cross to the valley near Alcester (there is a barrow
by the side of it at Cookhill), another leading from Eastnor to the British
Camp at Malvern, and a third along the Marl Cliff above the ruddy banks of
Avon and the moss-grown mill at Cleeve. Some of these old tracks run near
to the straightcr Roman roads, indeed in some cases the Romans appear to
have repaired the ancient tracks.
When the Romans left Britain there must have been a perfect network of
good roads extending all over the country; from military station to military
station, from town to town, from city to city, from coast to coast; they may
yet be traced, intersecting one another in every direction.
The Saxon kings placed four of the chief roads under special privilege. Edgar
(973-975) did this, the Confessor and the Conqueror confirmed it, hut when
the King’s Peace was extended to all the highways in the kingdom early in
the twelfth century, the exact routes of the old roads were soon forgotten, and
now it is hopeless to attempt to reconcile the various accounts of the Monkish
Chroniclers, since each writer traced one or more of the I runk roads tor a
time and then branched off into some old track more familiar to him than
the great highway. Nor is this all, various writers give the same names to
totally different roads. Thus the subject becomes complicated and difficult to
unravel.
Partly, perhaps, owing to this confusion, partly to the antiquity of the roads
themselves, names to which they have no just claim have become attached to
some of them locally, most of these names appear to be of Saxon origin, but
here in Worcestershire vestiges of the older I-atin appellations appear still to
linger.
The Romans called their roads Via Co ns id a res, Via Regia: , Vice Pretoria,
Via Miliiares, and Via Salaried and by special names, as Via Julia , the road
from Bath to the Severn. Pliny is our authority for the Via Salarta or Salt
Way,* and his testimony is important since we have two Salt Ways in 'Wor-
cestershire, and one of them is called by the country people Sale Way to this
day. The name of the Worcestershire Road called Icknield Street, Rycknield

Street, and locally Eagle or Iccle Street Lane, may perhaps he a corruption of
a tribe name, but this is doubtful. On the contrary, there is no doubt about
the Port Ways, which have retained their old name unaltered for nearly two
thousand years. For example there is a Port Street at Bengeworth near Evesham,
a Porlway at Hcoley, another at Kcmpsey, and a third at Fladbury, all connected
with Roman roads or stations. The term Street and Foss apply to the manner
in which the roads are constructed. Livy speaks of Vi® Stratse, roads pitched,
or paved with stones. To the Britons such roads were Ystrced, whence our
Street.t Ihe first operation in Roman road making was to remove the surface
soil and make a fossa, or ditch, to receive the gravel and other hard materials.
A similar word ( fossatum ) is used in old charters down to the 15th century to
denote, not a ditch, but a causeway.];
A glance at the map will show us that Worcestershire lies almost in the
middle of a square, formed by four great Roman roads. Upon the north the
Watlmg Street running north-west from London to Wroxeter, extending in its
full length from Richborough or Dover to Chester and Carnarvon. Upon the
south, a branch of the Akeman Street. The main line of the Akeman Street
runs from London westward through Silchester and Bath to the Severn, but
t e road bifurcates near Newbury, runs north-west through Cirencester and

Surrounded by the counties of Gloucester, Hereford, Salop, Stafford, and
Warwick through which these four roads pass, Worcestershire would have been
isolated from their traffic had it not been for two other roads which intersected
in the north of this county. The first is now called the Icknield or Rycknield
Street, but it should not he confused with the true fcknield Street which runs
from near Wantage to Icklingham on the borders of Norfolk, and was so called
from the Iceni (Icceni —Ikkens), the people dwelling in East Britain, into
whose territories the road went. In charters of the roth century it is called
the Icenhilde Weg, /. e., The War path of the Ikkens; or, Iceni, This and
the Midland Icknield Street may have been connected, but the former is a
much more irregular, and therefore perhaps older, path than the latter. If the
Midland Icknield Street were continued across the Foss Way it would cross
the Icenhilde Weg on the Berkshire Downs, and probably enter the west gate
of Sil Chester, hut no certain trace of this road has yet been found. Dugdale
states that it passed from Bidford in a south-easterly direction to Stow-on-the-
Wold, thence to Burford, and over the Isis at Newbridge direct to Wallingford,
and thence to Wincester and Southampton.*
The course of the Midland Icknield Street is very difficult to follow, and in
places all traces of it are lost, but its general direction northward from Bidford
is fairly apparent. We have, however, to account for two western deviations.
Cirencester forms one of the corners of our square of roads, and from it on the
north, proceed two ancient tracks—(i) the Foss Way, (2) the White Way. If we
follow the Foss for some seventeen miles we come to Bourton-on-the-Water. The
remains of a large Roman villa arc situated here, close to the river Windrush,
near the junction of the Foss Way and Buckle Street, Leaving the loss
Way our road passes north-west by Wagborough, above Upper and Lower
Guiting, at which place are barrows on each side of it, then passing through
Cutsdcan, a detached part of Worcestershire, and along the ridge of hills above
Snowshill; leaving Broadway Tower on the west it descends the Cotswolds near
Willersey and Saintbury Camps, having approached the true line of the Icknield

Street, it either crossed it, or else diverged again towards Evesham. The Buckle
Street from Boulton to Snowshill is about twelve miles in extent, and
it makes a bow-shaped curve three miles to the west of Condicote, If
the road had continued straight from Cutsdean southwards it would
have joined the White Way and so have entered Cirencester, From the
Foss Way to Bidford the road is known by the not very euphonious
name Buggilde Street. At Weston-sub-Edge it is still called “Buckle Street,”
it passes the village of Buckland, also by Brockbill, and Buggyhin, now called
Bcckyhill. In a Saxon charter* dated a.ix 7 oy, certain boundaries are described
as “running along Bugghilde Strectc, in Staihtan Hyll,” in another charter it is
called “Bucgan Street” (a.d. 967), In Gloucestershire the road is raised in several
places near Kineton Thorns, and where so raised it has a uniform width of
about eight feet.t
We have now to account for a second branch road westward. From Bidford
Bridge across the meadows there is a raised road forming part of the Buggilde
Street. It then appears to have passed into Marl Cleeve, and up the end of
the hill out of that village. “From that point along the terrace there is a
low, but well-defined embankment which looks like Roman work, but it is
lost when the road leading from North Littleton to the Fish and Anchor Inn
crosses the terrace.”! Mr. Tomes, of Littleton, however, has traced the road
(with the exception of half a mile, where it is lost over the cultivated ground
below the hill) to Bengeworth east of Evesham. The road continues to
iewkesbury, thence to Gloucester, thence, probably, it crosses the Severn and
finally reaches the sea at St. David’s. It is this road which has misled so
many topographers, both ancient and modern, and has caused the statement
to be made that the Rykmeld, or Tcknield Street, went from St. David’s to
Scotland, via Wall near Lichfield.
I here is some doubt as to the exact point where the Icknield Street
the Toss May , hut the road through ’Weston Subedge appears to he
on the true line, and it forms the county boundary at Honeybourne. The
road is in Worcestershire at Cooper’s Lane, then for half a mile it is in
Gloucestershire and enters Warwickshire at Bickmarsh Lodge.

Roads marked thus
Douhtfnl portions thus
In this map only a few of the most important Roman roads are marked. The road along
the east bank of the Severn is not marked. A Roman road runs through dent in the
direction of Droitwich, another through Ombersky, a third near Kidderminster, m the direc-
tion of Wroxeter and Chester, and there arc others of less importance.
The lines represent the general direction of the roads only.


The main road still points northwards from Bidford to Wixford, where it
passes in a hollow-way to the oust of the church, thence to Alcester, once a
Roman town of sufficient importance to be mentioned by name, “Alauna,” in
the earlj geographies, thence through Jpsley to Beoley, where it again enters
Worcestershire. At Beoley we can trace the lines of fortification of one of the
Roman stations upon this great highway.
And now the road after passing the village contracts, till it becomes
a narrow time-worn track between deep banks, the grass grows green
upon the path, the brambles spread their trailing branches from the high
hedges, and umbrageous limbs of great oak trees make the road dark at
midday. A grey and time-worn homestead, quite in keeping with the
antique aspect of the road, is the only human habitation hereabout. The
path descends to the valley at the foot of Weatheroak Hill, and a stone marks
the spot where a brutal murder took place on this remote and lonely lane.
Past the hamlet in the valley the old track of the road, like the bed of a
torrent, deep and rugged, skirts the modern way till it emerges on the more
open land upon the hill top, whence it can be traced partially through the
parish of Kings Norton to Selly Oak, to a fortified station, at Metchley, a
bow-shot across [the boundary of Worcestershire. Thence the road passes
through Birmingham and Sutton Coldfield, where a most perfect stretch of
it exists—a wonderful memorial of engineering skill and enterprise, sixty feet
wide across the bogs of the Coalfield on a solid foundation, it has a gentle
slope from the centre and on each side is bounded by a ditch ; it has
remained undisturbed since the time of the Romans—to Wall near Lichfield
upon the Wading Street. From thence it proceeds by an almost direct course to
the neighboured of York, and so on its way to Scotland.
This road, he it Rycknield, Icknield, Eagle, Bugghilde or Buckle Street, is
the direct road from the South of England through the Midlands to Scotland
by way of York, it is marked at regular intervals by entrenched stations; tumuli
and beacon hills are found upon its course; in places it has the appearance of
" “ 7* WhCreVer k CrOSSeS ° ne other great roads the junction

a little; along some portions of its course irregular trackways, usually 11 ridgeways,”
run nearly parallel to it: it is mentioned as a boundary in Saxon charters,
and lastly Roman remains have been ■ found all along its course proving it
incontestably to be a Roman military road.
Another Roman road ran from Gloucester through Tewkesbury to Worcester
and Wroxeter, along the east bank of the Severn. But a third road of great
commercial importance ran from Magna, (Kenchester), on the Western Watling
Street, through Worcester to Droitwich, where it became the Upper Salt Way j
passing thence through Bromsgrove to Birmingham it crossed the Icknield Street
at Selly Oak (? Sale-Icy), passed through Saltley (? Salt-ley) and onward through
Salter's Lane and by Salter’s Croft, Tamworth, above which town a branch runs
into the Icknield Street,* but the main road continued to Lincolnshire, where it
seems to have terminated at Salt Fleet on the coast. Ibis is the Upper Salt Way,
along which the salt was sent from Droitwich to the fishers on the east coast
and thence it may be to the Continent,
Some antiquaries call the Salt Way the Western 'Trackway, but carry it
from Kxeter to Gloucester, along the Severn to Worcester, Droitwich,
Blackrode in Lancashire, and so to Carlisle. A lower Salt Way passed from
Droitwich eastward through Hadsor, by Mcer Hall and Bradley Green, through
Feckenham and Inkberrow, by Muzzy Hill, north of Hoohery Green, thence
across the Ridgeway to Hanging "Well, Bunkers Hill Barn, to the Icknield
Street north of Alcester, Probably it still continued eastwards through Strat-
ford-upon-Avon, and so across the Watling Street to the east coast, or at least
to Colchester, hut this part of the course lias not been traced.
Mr. Allies and others who have written on this subject make the Lower
Salt Way join the Icknield Street, and say that at Middle Hill the Icknield
Street is called Salt Way. Doubtless, the Icknield Street may have taken some
of the traffic in later times, but there appears to have been a lower deviation,
and the name Salt Way is given to a road joining the Foss Way and Akeman
Street about halfway between Bourton-on-the-Water and Cirencester. In Isaac
Taylor’s Map of Gloucestershire, dated ISOO, the Salt Way is shown running
near Ashton-under-Hill, Dumbleton, aad Toddington, to TTayles; no traces of it

arc now to be found there, but its ascent of the Cotswold Hills is visible. And
Mr, Witts* has traced it through Gloucestershire in a line almost parallel to
the Icknield Street. It runs attended in its course by tumuli past Hawling,
Salperton, and Hazleton, crossing the Foss Way between Northleach and
Stowell Park; thence it proceeds by Crickley Barrow to Coin St. Aldwyns,
where it crosses the Icknield Street, leaving Gloucestershire at Lechdale on its
way to the coast of Hampshire. In a Saxon charter, dated a.d. 969, it is
mentioned as “Scalt Street.”
There are other British and Roman roads in Worcestershire, especially in the
western and north-western parts of the county, but those already mentioned
are the chief. Their existence tends to show that previous to Roman times
the early inhabitants here, as in other parts of the Island, had need of good
roads for military and commercial purposes. The improvements made by the
Romans are distinctly visible; their roads followed the old tracks in the main,
but the Roman engineers knew how to overcome difficulties of construction,
to build bridges, and to plant defensive stations better than the Britons.
In the course of ages many changes and modifications have occurred, but
v-e may still trace the tracks along which the British warriors marched to
battle, or conveyed the mineral riches of their country to the sea coast, there
to he bartered to the Eastern merchants who moored their ships in many an
English haven, ages before Julius Caesar landed beneath the cliffs on the shore
of Kent. The fortified stations along the Icknield Street or the Severn Road
remind us of the conquest of Britain, and of the perfect military system
practised by the Romans. No less are we reminded of the valour of our
ancestors and their resistance to the Invaders, necessitating such elaborate
precautions for the safety of the newly founded Province.

H JSntisb Ibero.
IROM the time of Cnesars first invasion of Britain nearly a
V) century passed before the Romans again tried to annex this
o island to their Empire. Tn the year a.d. 43, the Emperor
yj Claudius sent his general Aulus Plautius in command of four
legions, with auxiliaries and cavalry, numbering in all some
tribes and take possession of the country.
At first no resistance was made by the Britons, and the Romans penetrated from
the south coast as far as Silchester, then a British stronghold, but afterwards the
Roman town Caleva; thence to Cirencester, which they named Corinium. Tn
the mean-time a confederacy was forming among the clans, and Caratacus and
Tngodumnus, sons of King Cunobelinus, were elected to the chief command.
The Britons, and the Romaßs met on the battlefield, the Britons were
defeated and their chief town now called Eexden, near Colchester, taken. The
result of this defeat was that certain clans, dwelling in Gloucestershire and the
contiguous districts, separated themselves from the confederacy and submitted to--
the Ramans, who built two cities, one Camuloduum (Colchester) in the east,
the other Glevum (Gloucester) in the west. Thus Gloucester became the chief
city in the Severn valley and the base of all military expeditions' in the west
and midlands. Cirencester too was a strong and important city.
The Emperor Claudius had come from Rome with reinforcements, he was
present at the taking of Camulodunum and is supposed to have stayed for


some time in (llourester, mid to have received the submission of the dans to
the east of the Severn, that is in Worcestershire and part of Warwickshire, and
to the south of the Thames.
When the campaign was over Aiilus was recalled. No sooner had the
genera! returned to Rome than tlie Britons began to trouble the colonists and
to over-run the lands of the submissive tribes. In a.d. 50 a new proprietor,
Ostorius Scapula, arrived. It was winter, and contrary to the expectation of
the Britons the general at once commenced operations. The first thing to be
done, was to protect the conquered country from incursions by the still

unsubdued tribes. Ostorius at once began to build a line of forts across
the country from the Severn in dm south-west to the Xen, a river flowing
into the Wash, in the north-east. this chain of forts brings us home to
Worcestershire.


The line along the Severn guarded the western frontier, keeping in check the
Silures of South Wales and the Ordovices of North Wales. The line along
the Avon and the Nen through Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire
to Norfolk, protected the south of England from attack by the northern tribes.
The Roman sentinels upon Bredon Hill and the Cotswolds looked out over
the Worcestershire Vale between the river and the hills to Malvern, where the
Britons upon their lofty rock-hewn citadel held in defiance the conquerors of
the world, and to distant Clent where the tribesmen had another settlement.
On the north-east their eyes must have glanced over the Forest of Feckenham,
and the dark Warwickshire Arden, where the Roman out-posts faced the line of
British earthworks, remnants of which still remain as witnesses of the fierce
resistance made by the ancient inhabitants of this land against the attacks of
the invaders.
This Midland forest country is full of poetic memories of Robin
Hood and Maid Marian; of Touchstone and Audrey, of Rosalind, Celia,
and Orlando, and the melancholy and philosophic Jacques, and of the
Elizabethan poet whose bones lie peacefully by Avon's side, but there are
sterner memories of the resistless Romans and the awful battlefields where the
mail-clad legions of Italy and the enduring Thracian, Dalmatian and Egyptian
auxiliaries fought side by side against the Keltic warriors. Nor was the Avon
the only stream along which hard-fought fields were won, the Severn too flow's
past many a Roman camp and early British earthwork between Shrewsbury and
the sea. By Severn side, or by the banks of Teme, Caratacus directed the
building of the stupendous hill fortresses which were a wonder to the Roman
engineer eighteen hundred years ago, and are still a wonder to the English
engineer of the present day. It was to hold these works in check that the
Severn forts were built.
Starting from Gloucester, the first Roman post to the north, on the borders
of Worcestershire, was, probably, at Twyning, on Towbury Hill, a mile or so
beyond Tewkesbury. From the irregular shape of the earthworks this has been
supposed to have been a British fortress originally, and afterwards occupied by
the Romans. Roman remains have been found at Ripple in this neighbourhood.
About ten miles further up the river is Worcester, an undoubted Roman

settlement, and four miles to the south of the city is the Roman camp at
Kempsey. Here again the Romans may have pitched upon the site of an
earlier fortification, but time has left few traces of Keltic or Roman works
beyond the banks enclosing an irregular four-sided area overlooking the river.
In a gravel pit near, a British or Romano-British cemetery was found many
years ago; and in 181 S, an inscribed stone was dug up within the camp.
From this inscription it appears that the Emperor Constantine the Great {a.D.
306-337) was here commemorated. “ Valerius Cohstantinus, —Pious, Prosperous,
Invincible, Supreme Emperor.” * This camp, probably, was not an early one,
judging from Its plan.

Worcester has little to show in evidence of Roman occupation, but that
little is sufficient proof. Camden believed that £< Worcester was founded by the

Romans when they built cities, at proper intervals, on the east side of the
Severn to check the Britons on the other side of the river. It formerly boasted
Roman walls. It has now (16th century) a tolerably strong wall.”
In the Saxon chronicles, a British town called Caer Guorangon is mentioned,
and this is supposed to have been the forerunner of the Roman station,
Brannogenion Civitas of Ptolemy, Identified by Camden as Worcester, hut
Hrannogenion is now thought to have been either Ludlow or not
Worcester.
Where the next fortress in the Severn chain was situated we do not know
exactly, probably it was about half-way between Worcester and Upper Arley.
At Arley, on the borders of Staffordshire, in a strong position, may yet be seen
the remains of a rectangular camp. There may be two more stations to complete
the Hue northwards towards Wroxeter, but with these we are not now concerned.
Wroxeter, the Roman Uriconium, commanded the county where Caratacus was
making preparations for resisting the invaders, but Arley and Worcester were
no less important from a strategical point of view, from Worcester and
Droitwich, across the forest of Beckenham to Alcester, on the confines of the
Midland Arden, the chain of outposts was continued.
From Alcester, the Roman Alauna, to the spot where the Watling Street
crosses the Avon to the east of Rugby, near to the camp which afterwards
marked the Roman station of Tripontium, there are traces of Roman earthworks
facing a well-marked chain of fortified posts and tumuli. These tumuli, which are
frequently seen both in Worcestershire and Warwickshire, appear to have been
used for the purpose of signalling by fire by night and smoke by day. These
are the beacon hills where scouts and sentinels watched in times of danger; in
Worcestershire they are often called toot hills, and are generally situated near to
ancient roads or tracks. They are believed to be of British origin, but some
of them seem to have been utilized, if not made, by the Romans.
From Gloucester to Wroxeter, from r lewkesbury to the Watling Street, the
two chains of military out-posts have been traced. Ostorius was the first
to cover and protect the conquered territory with this line of forts. By
gradually advancing these lines, after fighting a series of battles the Romans
soon brought the whole of Britain south of the Tyne under subjection, but
35
A BRITISH HERO.


it was in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, and Warwickshire that the first
chain of forts was made. Thus Worcestershire became essentially a border
country.
No sooner was the line completed, than the Iceni, a people dwelling within
it, who had not been conquered, but had submitted of their own free will, rose
in arms against the Romans. After a great battle the Iceni and their allies
were beaten, and the Romans marched against the Cangi, who are supposed
to have lived m Carnarvonshire. From the pursuit of the enemy in the west,
Ostorius was recalled by the rising of the men of Yorkshire, whom he also
defeated. Leaving there a colony of veterans, in a well-fortified camp, to keep
the vanquished Brigantes in subjection, Ostorius next turned towards Wales
where the Silures, bravest of all the Britons, and the Ordovices had made a
league and elected Caratacus their leader.
How anxiously must the sentinels on the forts along the Severn have
watched the movements of the tribes on the other bank. The smoke ascending
from the top of Malvern Hills in full sight of Worcester, would warn them
that the great campaign had commenced. It was then that the Severn forts
became of great importance. It seems to have been the policy of Ostorius to
advance his western line of defence through Monmouthshire, Herefordshire, and
Shropshire, from the Bristol Channel to Chester, where in after times we find a
road guarded by a series of strong stations between Wroxeter and Usk, but
the county between that road and the Severn had first to be conquered.
It is probable that Gloucester was the base of these operations, and that
Ostonus commenced the Silurian campaign from the south, since Tacitus states
thac before the expedition started, a colony of veterans was planted at
Colchester to protect the east part of Britain against the Iceni. After contesting
the ground in the south for a time, Caratacus moved the seat of war to the
not. i; where upon the mountains in Shropshire and on the borders of Wales
he had orttfied camps, protected not only by earthworks and rivers, but by
stone walls of great extent.

by over 700 broad. Here, bn Croxal Knoll, or, as some have supposed, at a
somewhat similar fortress at Breidden Hill on Severn, or at Caer Caradoc,
the British hero Caratacus made his last stand against the invaders; the
fortress was carried by assault, and his people were slaughtered by the better
armed and disciplined Romans. Caratacus fled into Yorkshire to take refuge
with his step-mother the Queen of the Brigantes, who, hoping to curry favour
with the Romans, put chains upon him and delivered him up to Ostorius.
The General sent him with his Queen and children to Rome, whither his fame
had already travelled. For nine years he had withstood the best general Italy
could produce, and now, though a prisoner in an enemy’s country, and in the
presence of Claudius the Emperor of Romo, surrounded by all the pomp and
magnificence of the capital of the world, he showed no signs of fear. It was
then that he asked the Emperor the question which Tacitus has recorded, and
which now is familiar to every English man and woman, “How r is it that you, who
dwell in such grand palaces, envy us poor Britons our thatched cots ? ” His
chains were struck off, and he and his family were set free.
Probably the British hero did not return to the land of his nativity, but
died in exile. Some writers have supposed, but have not proved, that Caratacus
was a native of Worcestershire; and there is an old tradition that Claudia,
who is said to have been his daughter, was instrumental in bringing the
Christian religion into this country. All this, however, is very doubtful.*
The rout of the Britons in Shropshire, gave the Romans the greater part of that
county, and of Worcestershire west of the Severn, but though Caratacus had
fled, the Silures were by no means conquered. From their mountain fastnesses
they issued when least expected, harried the Roman stations in the Wye valley,
and retired to the hills again, when the troops from the neighbouring towns
and posts along the Severn came to relieve the soldiers in the new line of
forts. It was, however, at the beginning of the campaign that Worcestershire
became the theatre of w r ar.
Between the advance tine of the Romans in the Wye valley, and the old
line of defence along the Severn, the British had several strongholds, particulaly

two great camps on the Malvern Hills, one on Midsummer Hill, the other on
the Herefordshire Beacon, both upon the present boundary of the county. Of
the first and older of the two, it has been truly said :—We may at once
dismiss from our minds any notion of its being of Roman, Romano-British, or
of Danish origin, as it possesses not a single feature of the works usually
attributed to any of those people; but on the contrary, it does possess
characteristics of a period prior to any of them.”* The camp gates are

on the Malven. Hills. G


The Beacon camp consists of a central citadel with two irregular wings.
The highest and most conspicuous part of the citadel, more than 1000 feet
above the plain, is a deeply entrenched oval 178 feet long by ito feet broad,
placed due east and west, apparently out of conformity with the natural shape
of the rock in which the surrounding foss is excavated. There is no doubt
some occult reason for this arrangement connected with the ancient religion of
he early inhabitants of Britain. The hill may have been a place of worship
before it was a camp, and on that account its defence would be the more
stubborn. It is said to have been “the seat of council and of judgment, the
fountain of divine oracles, and a sacred temple, wherein were practised the
awful mysteries of the Druidical religion.” This may have been so, but there
is no doubt about the hill having been used for military purposes, and it remains
to-day the most stupendous hill-fortress in the Midlands.
When Caratacus was arranging the defences of the eastern border of his
territory overlooking the wide valley of the Severn and the Roman outposts,
he would probably consider the Midsummer Hill encampment insufficient to
protect that side of Siluria, and would make stronger works upon the more
commanding heights of the Herefordshire Beacon, one mile further north. To
the west upon Wall Hills near Ledbury, are the remains of other camps and an
extensive British settlement, while on the eastern side was, it is said, the old
town at Gadbury. The wings of the two Malvern camps are large enough to
hold many thousand people and large herds of cattle, Caratacus. or whoever
fortified the Beacon camp, expected the attack to come from the east, and on
that side he made the works the strongest, but when the enemy appeared they

place of their assault upon the Malvern fortress, where the breach then made
remains to this day. Fearful must have been the fight. Tacitus (Annals
Book XII.) has left an account of the storming of a similar British hill-
fortress.
The British warriors crowded on the hill-side awaiting the arrival of the
armour-clad Romans, Upon the narrow ridge-way the auxiliaries first advanced,
the legionary soldiers following. Here the British charioteers had little chance of
exercising their skill. The assailants avoided the strongly guarded gates, and
the concave portions of the wall where the garrison could inflict heavy injury
with their slings and darts on both sides.- The assailants made a bee-line for
the centre of the great western rampart, which being convex was unprotected
by any other portion of the works, and though naturally the steepest, actually
was the weakest point in the fortress. Here, however, was an out-work which
first had to be taken. With shields locked the soldiers advanced and took
it, and their next attack was upon a little sally-port or water-gate. Here the
fighting must have been hard, and many a Roman sword and spear was
sheathed in a Briton’s body. Having fairly got a footing in the first foss,
thrown down the rampart of earth, a second rush w r ould carry the second
vallum, where we find a hundred feet of it destroyed.
The light and heavy armed soldiers pressed upon the crowd of British
warriors, the former assailing them with darts, the latter fighting foot to foot,
slaughtering all within their reach with sword and spear, till the line was
broken; for the Britons had neither breast-plate nor helmet to defend them
from Romans’ weapons. From this point, up the steep glacis of the
citadel must have been a stiff climb, but the Roman soldiers accomplished it,
throwing down nearly the whole of the northern vallum and nearly filling up
the foss below.
After the battle, the Beacon camp seems to have been abandoned. In course
of time the moss and turf grew over it, protecting with a verdant covering
the signs of man s handiwork, and of the fearful drama enacted there eighteen
hundred years ago. So that although there arc no written records of the fight we
are still able to trace the terraces of the camp, the hut-circles which 'once
sheltered the garrison, the chariot road, the water tanks, the gates and the


amphitheatre, and to mark the breach upon the western glacis where the
assailants stormed the fortress.

! county and diocese of Worcester, as at present consti-
tilted, are but parts of a greater whole, that greater whole
being the land and diocese of the Wiccii or Hwiccas.
There are several theories to account for the origin of
this name, the most probable being that which would
make the Wiccii the people engaged in the manufacture
and distribution of salt, saltmen in fact.*
Sir William Camden says, “ this name, if it was , not given them from
the winding course of the Severn (in Anglo-Saxon called Wic) was taken
from the salt-pits, named iviches in the old English language. 1 ’
The Ordoviccs (Ordo-wics, higher-wicii), who lived in part of North
Wales and perhaps in Cheshire, arc mentioned by a writer of the 2nd
century,! but I have been unable to find an}?- notice of the Wiccii before
the 6th century. Whether they were Britons or Saxons is not known,
probably they were a mixture of both. There is ample evidence to prove
that the Saxons knew the value of the Worcestershire brine springs, and
that they called the people dwelling in this district the Hwiccas.
'The word, wic fgwic, wick) h found In Cymric, Anglo-Saxon, slid NotSc; its priimtty meaning seem! to
have been a siaho/c, Willi the Anglo-Saxons it was a station or an abode on land, a house, a village, but
with the Northmen it was a station for ships, hence a creek or bay, (The sea-rovers derived their name of
vik-ings, or creekers, from the wicks or creeks in which they anchored.) Salt was formerly made by evaporating
sea water in shallow wiches or bays, as the word bay salt testifies, and in course of time places where salt was
made Came to be called i vies, whether they were on the coast or inland. For this reason the Kev. Isaac
laylor ( Words and Places, pp, 10:1-2) says that the names of the salt towns ate derived from the Norse gnd
not from the Anglo-Saxon. The two chief salt producing counties arc Cheshire and Worcestershire, and in bath
we find many place-names ending In wich or wick. In Domesday Booh we read of salt works at Wicf*

In the collection of charters belonging to Worcester Monastery, made by
Heming the Monk,* is one whereby TEthelbald, king of the Mercians, grants
to the Christian family (of monks} at Wigranceastre (Worcester) a piece of
land used for salt works on the south bank of the river Suluuearpe, called
Lootwic and Coolbeorg, suitable for three aisuii, and six chimneys {camtm),
in exchange for others on the opposite bank. The date of this charter is
about a.d. 716,f
The salt industry is, without doubt, much older than the Bth century,
but the charter proves that it was of importance in the Saxon times,

The Severn Valley, however, even in

of the lands of Britain, a ‘ land of hills
and dales, watered by soft flowing streams,
and abounding in rich pastures ; a land
which, under proper cultivation, would
become most fruitful. Indeed, in the
southern parts it was already fruitful, and
no part of Britain was wealthier than this.
This land, from the river Axe to the
valley of the Trent and the estuary of
the Dee, was one of those princedoms
by the union of which England was
formed: it was governed by its own
kings, who lived in the cities and towns; afterwards it had its own ealdormen,

the West Saxons.

In the year Anno Domino 577 the heathen hosts had overrun the valley
of the Thames, when Ceawlin, a great Saxon warrior, thirsting for fresh
conquest, looked upon the valley of the Severn and it seemed fair to him.
Three kings of. three cities of the plain bad formed a league against the
invaders; Corinium (Cirencester) and Glevum (Gloucester) lay, the one on the
eastern, the other on the western side of the Cotswold Hills, while Aquae Solis
(Bath) guarded the valley of the lower Avon.
Advancing through Wiltshire, by the great road from Silchester to Cirencester,
the Saxons encountered the Britons on the hills at Dcorham (Dyrham). The
conquering Saxons, like the conquering Hebrews of old, carried havoc and
destruction from city to city; as they did unto Bath and her king so did
they unto Cirencester and her king; as they did unto Cirencester and her
king, so did they unto Gloucester and her king. The kings were slain
and the cities desolate. How long this state of things lasted we cannot tell
exactly. Bath was a ruin for 300 years, but Gloucester was set up again
within a century.*
By the battle of Deorham (a.d. 577) the Britons of Devon and Cornwall
were separated from their kinsfolk across the Severn, and the first step towards
the conquest of the Midlands was taken.
Six years passed, during which the Saxons must have been busily engaged
in settling in their new home. Some of the vanquished people may have
lingered round the homesteads of their Saxon conquerors; many may have
escaped to their friends in the still unconquered lands.
Early in the year 583, just thirteen years before St. Augustine landed in
Britain, Ceawlin and his brother Cutba, with many followers, again set out to
conquer new lands. They marched along the east bank of the Severn by the
road which the Romans had made between the fortified stations, having the
river on the left and the Forest of Arden on the right. Soon the chiefs
came in sight of the walls of the Roman town —'Worcester, called by the Britons

Severn, and sheltered by hills on the north and cast. Worcester fell before
the Saxons, as bath and Gloucester had already fallen. The march continued
up the Severn to Bewdley, where the valley contracts and hills begin to appear.
Still the people fled before the invaders. A few miles further up the river,
Uricomum (Wroxcter), the white town in the valley, with its wall; gleaming
among the green woods, seemed to offer a templing shelter to the Britons, and
Kyndylan, their king, gathered his warriors together on the lofty Wrekin. But
when he saw the beautiful town in danger he rushed down the mountain and
fought hand to hand with the strangers. Fatal mistake, for the Saxons killed
him and many of his people; then having sacked the city, they left it a
heap of smouldering ruins.*
Turning northwards, the brothers bore down upon Chester, but the king of
Powys met them "on the way and beat them in a great battle, in which Cutha
and many of his followers were slain.
In the words of the Saxon Chronicle :
“ Ceawlin took many towns and countless booty, and wrathful he then returned to his own.”
He returned into the Severn valley, but the land which he had flooded
with blood, and the cities which he had ruined, offered no shelter for the
destroyer: back he must go past Uriconium and Worcester for the host of
Brockmsel, King of Powys, pursued him as an avenging fury.f
For eight years longer Ceawlln reigned in the lower part of the Severn
valley, from Bath to Bewdley; he had colonized with Saxons parts of Gloucester-
shire, Worcestershire, and Herefordshire. Then his people (who arc called the
Hwiccas) rose against him in rebellion, making Ceolric, son of his slain brother,
their king. So Ceolric allied himself with the Britons, and advanced against
the old chieftain, who had turned to bay on the Wiltshire Downs. Then was
there great slaughter at Wanborough (near Swindon), and Ceawlin was driven
out.
In this way was Worcestershire first invaded by the English under their
leader, Ceawlin, the West Saxon, and for these reasons was it called the Land
of the Wiccii.

B' OK.CESTRRSHIRE is traditionally associated with the early
Ijh missionary labours of the Apostle of England, St Augustine,
who probably passed through this county on his journeys
||& to and from Yorkshire, and held his celebrated conference
with the British bishops hereabout.
The exact spot at which this meeting assembled is not known ; the honour
being claimed for several places. In the yth century the province of the
Wiccii included Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, and part of Warwickshire, and
the boundary of the land of the Wiccii and of the West Saxons often varied.
Beda, the only early historian who records the event, is too vague in his
account to render much help in settling the poind
In the second hook of u The History of the English Church” we read i
“ Augustine, with the help of King Ethelbert, drew together to confer with him the
bishops or doctors of the next province of the Britons, at a place which is to this day-
called Augustine’s Ac, that is Augustine's Oak, on ihe borders of the Wiccii and West
•Saxons.” *
It is generally believed, though upon slight evidence, that the Synod was
held at Aust, or Aust-Cleve in Gloucestershire, by the Severn, at the passage
for ferry boats between England and South Wales, where in later times Edward
the Elder met the Welsh prince Leoline; but we may reasonably suppose that
there is some foundation for the Worcestershire tradition.
The meeting was held under or near an oak, a tree sacred from time
immemorial, and often marking the place of assembly of a tribe or clan.
*Beda. Historia Ecciesiastica Gentis Anglorum. Bk. 11. c. 2. y. 81, Giles' translation. [Ac, id csl rubur
Augustin! in confinis Ilwiccioruni et occiilentalium Saxonuiu.]
Henry of Huntingdon’s account is quoted from Beda.


There is nothing improbable in the conjecture that the Saint as he journeyed
preached to the people at certain well-known and convenient places, and,
since there were no public buildings, the shelter afforded by the spreading
branches of a great oak would be welcome both to preacher and people.
On the other hand, it is likely that the tradition has taken root in places
where Augustine never trod, and as it is nearly thirteen centuries since he
left this island the truth or falsehood of the local traditions cannot be proved.
Camden, living in the reign of Elizabeth, knew no more about the exact
locality of the conference than we do, nevertheless he fixed it “at a
place in Worcestershire not exactly known/’ and adds that “after some
squabbling about the observance of Easter, the preaching of the Gospel, and
administration of baptism according to the ritual of the Romish Church, the
bishops separated with as little agreement as before,’ 7
At four places in Worcestershire the tradition is found. Near the village
of Alfric, on the promontory of Old Storage, or in the dale below, it has
been suggested that Augustine and his “ family 77 met the native clergy. This
conjecture may be dismissed, because it seems to have originated with Sir
Henry Spelman, who fancied that in the name Alfric as given in some old
map Acfric he had found the Ac of Beda.* Another suggested site is
“ Haustake,” or “ Ossuntree,” i.e. the village Martin Hussingtree, near Droit-
wich.
At Hartlebury still stands the “ Mitre Oak 7 ’ a venerable tree associated by
tradition with the same meeting. The tree is at least five centuries old, and
measures 29ft. round the base. In the year of the Queen’s Jubilee (1887)
Dr. Philpott, Bishop of Worcester, planted a sapling from the old oak in a
field on the opposite side of the way. The land upon which the Mitre Oak
stands is held on the condition that the tree shall not be interfered with.
Divested of the halo of tradition the Mitre Oak appears as an ancient land-
mark of the possessions of the Bishop of Worcester. Nothing was more usual,
even in Saxon days, than to mark a boundary from tree to tree, or stone
to stone, and many are the boundary trees mentioned in our earliest English
charters, as well as in the parish perambulations of more recent times. In

support of this it may be remarked that when Queen Elizabeth came to
Hartlcbury she was met at “ Mitre Oak ” by the Bishop of Worcester and
the neighbouring gentry. Had not the tree marked the boundary of the Bishop’s
property it would not have been the scene of this historic meeting.

At Rock, a hilly parish
noith-west of Bewdley, another
famous oak was standing till
1 735, and here the tradition
has been firmly fixed for cen-
turies. In Saxon charters the
name of this place is Thaer

corruption become Rock ; that
is, a consonant has been affixed
to the old name, the letter
“R ” has slipped from the

Ac became The Rac
and finally Rock. In Fomes-
day Book the name is Halac,
i.e. (?) Holy Oak. The name
Aka, as an alternative to
Rock, survived till quite re-
cently. The Rev. J. R. Burton
has referred to this in l< A
History of Pewdley,” (Appendix, p. x.) where among the baptisms at Ribbesford
we read:

The natives still call it, emphatically, The Rock. In Saxon times this extensive
parish included Abberley, now severed from it.

much older. Emanuel Bowers states in his “Large English Atlas,” published

about 1670, that Rock is noted for an oak under tbe branches of which
St, Augustine held his conference with the British clergy. The story is
repeated by the Rev. T. Cox in Magna Britannia (p. 228), published in 1720,
and again by Bishop Percy, in a letter dated 1797. The Bishop’s letter reads
as follows :
“ When the new turnpike road wa? first made in 1753 the gate being set up at the
Apostle’s Oak, the gatekeeper, till his house was built, took shelter in the old hollow
trunk, in which he made a fire that caused it to be burnt down. I remember being
told this by Mr. Meysey, Rector of the Rock, about the year 1754 or 1755 when I was
on a visit at his Parsonage house.”*
Dr. Nash writing in c. 1799 confirms this account of the destruction of the
tree, and adds :
“Certain it is here was a hollow oak lield in great veneration by the country people,
and called the Apostle’s Oak,”
A sapling from the Apostle’s Oak is said to have been planted on
Abbcrley Hill, in the midst of a thicket.f This sapling grows on the spot
where the aged hollow trunk stood in 1735, about a mile from “The Hundred
House ” and 100 yards to the left from the present highway, but close to
the old road, from Ludlow to Worcester, the track of which may still be
traced. It is an important fact, that the ancient oak marked the boundary
between the dioceses of Hereford and Worcester, and therefore was not unlikely
to be chosen as the spot where the bishops from different dioceses might
assemble.} Of the seven British bishops who met St. Augustine two pre-
sided over local churches, one at Hereford, the other at Worcester.
Cardinal Newman, in his life of St Augustine, has taken much trouble to fix
the date of the Saint’s journey through the Midlands. If the meeting occurred
on the journey to the north, the probable date was a.d. 602, but, if on the
return journey, it would be about a year later, a.d. 603, or 72 years before
Saxulf, Bishop of Mercia, founded the first Saxon Church at Worcester.
At the time of St. Augustine’s visit, the Mercians still worshipped their

heathen deities. Christianity, indeed, may have ■lingered about the borders of
the province of the Wiccii, but heathendom was dominant. When the monks
appeared in procession, preceded by a cross-bearer, and protected by the
influence of King of Kent, they were allowed to pass through
the land in peace; but scarcely had the echo of their footsteps died away
when the tribes revolted against the supremacy of the King of Kent, and
acknowledged the overlordship of Rredwald, of East Anglia.
Augustine, like Caesar, visited this country, and departed without altering
the condition of the people of Mid-Britain, but he had opened the way for
succeeding missionaries; he had forced a broach in the wall of heathendom,

Worcestershire there are no prehistoric stone temples such as
are found in counties farther south and north. The nearest
stone circle, the Rollright Stones, time-worn and moss-grown,
/jCS may be seen upon a bleak ridge of hills in Oxfordshire,
near the junction of four counties, Worcestershire being
I o ne. There are, however, on Eredon Hill some rude unshapen
stones popularly supposed to be connected with the religion of earlier times.
These stones are called the King and Queen, and the Banbury or Eambury
Stone; they bear no sign of human interference, and appear to be simply
natural rocks denuded and perhaps displaced by landslips or the falling in of
a cavern roof.
The King and Queen, standing pillar-like near the summit of the hill above
Bredon's Norton, are two great masses of white oolitic rock composed of
fragments cemented together by a siliceous liquid*; around them in ruinous
disorder lie boulders of the same kind of rock. The earliest notice of these
stones may be found in a document of the time of Edward 1., wherein “ a
great stone hanging under the hill 1; is mentioned in an agreement made
between the Earl of Warwick and the Bishop of Worcester respecting the
boundaries of the free-warren of Hardwick, a hamlet of Brcdon.f
Within living memory a manorial court was periodically proclaimed at the King
and Queen, and immediately adjourned to the more hospitable shelter of the
village inn, “ The Royal Oak,” where feasting succeeded the perfunctory ceremonies

of the Court Leet. It was customary to whitewash the stones previous to opening
the court, a practice supposed to have been a relic of an ancient ceremony of
lustration.* Could the antiquity of this whitewashing be proved it would
strengthen our belief in the sanctity of their stony majesties.
There is a narrow passage between the King and Queen such as in former
times was often used for
passing people through,

charm away aches and

serve the purpose equally

a custom of passing rickety children through trees was in vogue till recent
times. In the Gentleman's Magazine for October, 1804, is an engraving of an
ash tree growing by the side of Shirley Street (part of the Stratford Road a
few miles from Birmingham) in Solihull Parish. The ash had been split when

two parts of the tree grew together again, and this was taken as ,an omen of
the child’s recovery.

Another interesting object is to be found on Bredon Hill: the Bambury
Stone, a monolith 20 yards in circumference and yards high, stands in a
hollow within and near the edge of the ancient camp which crowns this hill;
like the King and Queen it is a mass of inferior oolite. Three other stones
lie east and west nearly in a straight line with the Bambury Stone.
The great hollow about the stones may have been excavated when the camp
was made, or it may have been formed by the infalling of a cavern roof ;
landslips have occurred in the vicinity, and a cave mentioned by an old writer
as existing near the Bambury Stone has entirely disappeared.* Early in the
present century a landslip, a little to the w r est of the great stone, revealed a
quantity of buried wheat, an ancient store, perhaps, of some long forgotten
garrison of Kemerton Camp, whether British, Roman, or Sason it is impossible
to tell, since there are signs that the place was successively occupied by all
three.
Whether or not the Bambury Stone was held sacred by the heathen
people wffio entrenched themselves on Bredon Hill can scarcely be determined
now ; such stones were often held in veneration, and it is not improbable that
his one may have served as an altar for the camp in which it stands.
A w r ell knowm antiquary, t who, in his enthusiastic reverence for this ancient
stone, believed it to be one of those Ambrosia; Petrie, stones dedicated to the
worship of the gods, and anointed with holy oil, in pre-Roman times, —which
are found in many parts of Europe and Asia, has taken much trouble to
prove his theory from the derivation of the name.
The first consonant in Bambury is, it is said, simply an accidental affix (it
being a vulgarism of the county to prefix a consonant to words commencing with
a vowel), thus Bambury, it is argued, might easily be the same as Ambury.
Against this theory it may be objected that in Gough’s “ Camden ” (Ed. 1S06)
the word is printed Banbury; but if the form Bambury or Banbury be accepted
t will bear a more simple explanation.
Ban is a British word meaning high, it is found in the familiar instance

word does not enshrine the memory of some old warrior, a Beran or a Banan,
who entrenched himself on Hrcdon Hill ? + Speculation upon derivations is
useless without a knowledge of the ancient forms of the words; in this case
the earliest appearance of the name Bambury with which I am acquainted is
in Map, dated 1820, too recent to be of any value. In the old
Ordnance Map the name is written Banbury, in Derham (1716) Bemsbury,
and in Nash (ryßi) Bern bury.
Worcestershire people are proud of the scenery around Bredon Hill, and
many years ago a neighbouring land-owner built a Prospect House near the
Bambury’ Stone, From this tower on a clear day there is a fine view; to
the south and cast are the Cotswolds and the Broadway Hills; to the
north the wooded slopes beyond the Avon where an exiled Prince lives in true
old English fashion ; westward the Malvems, no hills more lovely in their
graceful outline, often varying in aspect, sometimes appearing mountainous,
sometimes gently undulating.
Ihe people of the vale have a strong regard for Bredon Hill, it is their
playground where their annual races were run, many are the traditions and
historic associations connected with the towns and villages which cluster round

a monastic barn sufficiently capacious for a church, and a church with a history
dating back to the dim Saxon days when Eanulphus, grandfather of King Offa
the Terrible, here founded a monastery in honour of St, Peter, endowing it
with lands at Cofton, Rednal, and Bromsgrove. Offa, himself, granted it to
the monks of Worcester in the year 780. The charter is extant to this day.*

at Bredon till the days of Queen Elizabeth, when the Crown despoiled them
of both church and lands. These lordly prelates enjoyed themselves in hunting

SITE OF EVESHAM ARBEV, FROM THE EAST RANK OF THE AVON.
St J6coWfn of IKHorccstei.
BT. ECGWIN, third Bishop of the Wiccians and first Abbot
of Evesham, was in many respects remarkable among the
Englishmen of his day, yet his name is now scarcely known
beyond his native county, nor does it appear in the Dictionary
of National Biography. It has been claimed for Ecgwin that
he was the first Englishman who wrote an autobiography.*
If true, this fact alone should preserve his memory from oblivion ; how he came
to be Bishop of the Wiccians may now be told.
Some thirty years after St. Augustine left the southern midlands there arose a
king of the middle English, Penda by name, who girded himself to war against

Evesham Abbey,” preface.


his neighbours; so strong was he that he united the people of the Upper Trent,
the middle English of Leicester, the Southumbrians, and the Lindiswaras into
one kingdom of Mercia, and also took from the West Saxons their possessions
along the Severn, that is the land of the Wieeians (including the present county
of Worcester), which henceforth formed part of Mercia.* The date of this
change w T as the year 628, after the fight waged by Penda against Cyncglis and
Cwichelm.f Eadwin, of Northumbria, pursued CadwMlon through Worcester,!
Penda allied himself with the Britons, and their king Cadwaillon helped him
to defeat the Northumbrians at the battle of Hatlield (a.d. 633). King Penda,
being a heathen, fiercely persecuted the Christian folk till the year a.i>. 655,
when he was slain in battle. Afterwards the Marchmen chose Wulfere, Penda’s
son, to be their king. Wulfere had received the faith of Christ, first that he
might marry Ermengilda, daughter of Erconbert, King of Kent, “in whom
centered the blood not only of all the Saxon kings, but also of the most
glorious saints.” Subsequently he became a Christian by conviction.
There is a beautiful and touching story told of the conversion of
this king Wulfere.li At his marriage he pledged himself to suppress idolitary
throughout his kingdom \ but found it difficult to keep this promise because
the Mercians were still much attached to the worship of Thor, Woden, and the
gods of Walhalla. His sons, however, under the training of their Christian
mother, had renounced idolatry. One day, whilst hunting, chance led Prince
Wulfad to a hermit’s cave, where he found St. Chad at prayer before a
ruddy-carved crucifix. From that day the young prince and his brother became
the Saints disciples, till Wcrbode, a fierce heathen, persuaded the king that they
were conspiring against him, and murdered the lads in their father’s presence
while they w r ere kneeling to receive their first communion. After this the
legend relates how St. Chad, by a miracle, converted Wulfere, It seemed that
the king followed Chad to the Abbey of Peterborough, where one day, after
praying for a long time, the Saint hung his chasuble on a sunbeam, ■which

supported it so that it fell not to the ground. King Wulfcre essayed to hang
his gloves and belt upon the same sunbeam, but could not, whereat he was
confirmed in the true faith.
Wulfere ruled wisely, putting in practice the Christian precepts, so that after
his time the Britons were no longer killed or enslaved, but were suffered to
remain among the English, and were protected by special laws. Thus it
happens that in those parts of Britain which the English won after their
conversion many British place-names still survive, and this is the case in
Worcestershire, which, being in great part a woodland country, escaped some
of the effects of the first storm of invasion.*
Wulfere began to reign in the year a.d. 659, and sat upon the throne of
Mercia full seventeen years, daring which time he extended his father’s kingdom
from the Humber southwards to the English Channel, and westward to the
Wye. This king called to him several holy bishops, who, however, had no
fixed abode, but about the year a.d. 670, Jaruman, bishop of the Mercians,
died, and Ceadda, better known as ’ St. Chad, was, at the king’s request,
appointed to the vacant see by Archbishop Theodore.t Ceadda, by birth a
Northumbrian, had been trained by Aidan in an Irish monastery. He was
one of a family of four brothers, Cynibill, Cealin, Cedd, and Ceadda, all
priests, the last two being bishops. Tor the head-quarters of the church
in Mercia Ceadda chose a verdant dell ivhere the crystal waters of a little
lake fell over a barrier of sandstone rock. To Ceadda the voice of Nature
was the voice of God, whether in the crashing thunder, or in the sweet
cadence of falling water; and so he was led to build his church and make
his home beside the waterfall at Lichfield, where the brook runs towards the
river Trent, After two years and a half of ceaseless missionary work he died.
To him succeeded AVinfrid and then Saxulf, who built the first Saxon Church
at Worcester ; but in fact the mantle of St. Chad descended upon St. Ecgwin,
who continued in the south of Mercia the work which St. Chad had
commenced in the north.

People,” Ed. 1853, p.

The kingdom of Mercia was too large a fold to be tended by one bishop,
so, after some opposition from M infrid, it was decided at the council of
Hatfield (a.d. fiSo) that it should be divided into five parts. The bishopric
of Hereford had already been constituted (a.o. f>73)- Lichfield, Leicester,
Sidnacester (Lindsey), and Worcester were the new. dioceses.
WORCESTER CATHEDRA!., FROM THE NORTH-EAST
The See of Worcester appears to have been co-cxtensive with the Wiccian
Province, and its bishop bore the name of the people, not of the city, for
as yet they were called bishops of the Wiccians (Hwiccas), not of Worcester.*
Oshere, Prince of this Province, besought King Ethelred, Wulfere’s successor,
to ratify the decree of the synod, which, being done, Worcester was chosen
* When the WiCtclan Diocese wat first shaped out of the huge Diocese of Lichfield, it roughly comprised the
whole of the present County of Worcester, the whole of Gloucestershire, east of the Severn, and the greater part of
the Feldon (open country, as distinguished from the Arden or Woodlands) or Warwickshire, south-east of the Avon.
The cities of Bristol and Gloucester were included in the Diocese of Woicester till the reign of Henry VIII., when
they were given over to the new See of Bristol. See “ Diocesan Histories, Worcester,” by the Rev. J, Gregory
Smith, M.A., and the Rev, Phipps Onslow, M.A.; p. 6-


as the place of the bishop’s residence. That a bishop should place his stool
beside the king’s throne was contrary to the English custom. Saxon bishops
usually chose a retired spot, away from the din of arms and the intrigues
of the court, and it is probable, therefore, that while Gloucester was the usual
residence of the Wiccian king, Worcester was a place of less importance ; but
one fact is clear, English folk must have been dwelling at Worcester at that
time. Worcester and Gloucester stand as the two chief places of the
Wiccian land; Worcester being first in ecclesiastical rank; Gloucester first in
temporal importance.*
Prince Oshere is also credited with the foundation of monasteries at
Whittington and Ripple; at the latter place the remains of three fine stone
crosses are popularly supposed to mark the boundary of a sanctuary. Osric,
Oshere’s brother, founded Gloucester Monastery, and lies buried, it is believed,
in that city. It is worthy of notice that the early Wiccian churches were
dedicated to St. Peter.
Ihe early bishops of the Wiccians were Northumbrians, trained in Hilda’s
Monastery, at Whitby. Talfrith, the first elected bishop, died before his
consecration, iiosel, the second, held the See eleven years, and then abdicated
in favour of Oftfor, a younger man, who, however, died within a year of his
consecration. Thus the way was opened for Ecgwin, and he was elected to
the vacant See in the year 693, hut was not consecrated till the following
year.t
Ecgwin, we are told, was a prince of the royal house of Mercia, and a
relative of King Ethelred; when he first appears upon the scene he is a
young priest, wdio has renounced the pleasures of the world in order that he
may labour as a Christian missionary among his heathen kinsfolk the people
of Mercia. He is an enthusiast, in great favour with both king and clergy,
and in all respects a suitable man to be entrusted with the care of the

great Wiccian dioccsc ; but he is unwilling to become a bishop. The king, the
clergy, and the people urge him to accept the mitre and the pastoral staff;
ultimately he consents, and is duly consecrated by Archbishop Brithwald.
Ecgwin next appeared as a great preaching bishop, very zealous to
convert the heathen, he fearlessly denounces the wickedness around him, he
declares the sanctity of marriage, advocates a reform in morals, and in
consequence makes enemies, who accuse him of being guilty of the
very faults he blames in others. The exact nature of these charges is
not specified, but complaint is made to the king, and also carried to Rome
and laid before the Pope.
The young bishop, however, is undaunted, he will vindicate himself before
the Pontiff. Both king and Pope command him to set out for Rome.
In those days a journey to Rome was attended with dangers and
difficulties; an ordinary man would have thought the hardships by the way a
sufficient penance for many sins, but, Ecgwin magnified the gravity of the
charges made against him, and not content with the ordinary pains of
pilgrimage, determined that his legs should be shackled with irons, as be-
fitted an accused man. The irons being placed upon the bishop’s legs, and
locked, Ecgwin himself threw the key into the Avon at a place then called
Hmddingpol, where in after years arose the stately Abbey of Evesham, a
lasting memorial of Saxon energy and piety.
The bishop and his attendants embarked at Dover and in due time arrived
at Rome. The advent of the English pilgrims was, says the legend, the
signal for all the bells in Rome to ring of their own accord a peal
of welcome.
At the bridge across the Tiber, Ecgwin told his followers to wait for him
vchile he went to St. Peter’s to pray; they might, said he, fish in the river
for perhaps they would take a small fish.
It happened even as the holy man had foretold, and great was the
wonder and delight of the pilgrims when one of their number hooked a
middling-sized salmon and threw it on land; after a little while they laid
the fish at the feet of their master, who, when he saw it, gave thanks to
Christ, When the brethren were preparing the salmon for the evening meal,

behold another miracle, for they found within the fish the very key which
Ecgwin had cast into the Avon! The bishop having released himself from his
fetters, presented himself before the Tope, to whom he submitted his case,
and obtaining full absolution and acquittal, returned home to be reinstated
in his bishopric.* He was received into favour, entrusted with the education
of King Ethelred’s sons, and, as a mark of royal approval, the gift of a
monastery at Fladbury was bestowed upon him. St. Werburga, a saintly
princess, daughter of King Wulfhere, is said to have persuaded her uncle
King Ethelred to give Ecgwin another present, namely the land around the
place where the key had been cast into the river The grant appears in
Evesham Abbey Register under the year a.d. 701, and the miraculous liberation
was commemorated throughout the middle ages by symbolisation upon the
shield of the Abbey, which bore : ™
“ Azure, a chain in chevron wilh a bolt in the dcster ami a horse lock in the sinister,
between three mitres labelled or.”

studies and to preaching. He was present at the Council of Clovisho in
a.d. 716, and died in the “odour of sanctity” on the 30th of December, Anna
Domini 720.* His day is observed in the Calendar on the nth January.f
The Church of Norton, built by one of Ecgwhrs successors, still commemo-
rates the saintly bishop: it is dedicated to St. Ecgwin, and within it is a
fragment of a finely carved stone lectern, of 12th century date, whereon
St. Ecgwin is represented in the attitude of benediction. This stone was dug
up on the site of the Abbey, and formerly occupied a place in the Chapter
House.
Miracles were not wanting either before or after Ecgwinb death to establish
his reputation as a saint. On one occasion, says the Golden Legend, he
healed a dumb man, on another he saved a ’ friend from shipwreck. At
Alcestcr the smiths inhabiting the old Roman town turned a deaf ear to the
bishop’s preaching, drowning his voice with the clang of their hammers.
Ecgwin foretold their destruction, which • happened a few years afterwards when
an earthquake swallowed up the town, leaving no vestige of the Roman
buildings, or of the Woden-worshipplng smiths who had derided the preaching
of the gospel.
Many of the foregoing particulars were put into writing in the 11th century
Ip cicdulous and zealous monks, who collected the oral traditions. Without
impeaching the good faith either of the saint, or his biographers, who, doubt-
less, faithfully recorded the traditions us repeated to them, we may remark
that in the course of ages a story loses nothing in the telling.

Gbe Swineherds Vision,
a MI ST lies upon the woods beside the stream of Avon; it
is among the trees, and upon the sluggish waters. All
is hushed and still. The river flows silently on towards
the Severn, and not a breath of wind makes ripples on
its surface, or rustles the leaves of the forest along its
banks.
Seated beneath the spreading branches of a venerable oak is a rough and
shaggy figure, his appearance quite in keeping with the primaeval woods around
him. His dress shows that lie is a Saxon herdsman. This ’ man is Eoves,
guardian of the herds which roam in the Black wood, given by Ethelred, king
of the Mercians, to Ecgwin, Bishop of the Wiccians, and the Christian family
of monks serving God at Worcester.
The land is quite uncultivated, over run with brambles, clouded with fogs,
and none save Eoves and his three companions—Yinpa, Trottuc, and Cornuc —
dwell therein. One of the swine from the herd has strayed, and Eoves has
long sought for her. At last, on this day he has found her lair far in the
woody wilderness on the banks of Avon ; weary with the quest, he is now
resting beside the ruins of an ancient Christian church destroyed by the
Pagans at their first coming to Britain. This spot has a peculiar attraction for
Eoves ; it is peaceful and remote from the habitations of men. The stories
he has heard of fairies, hobgoblins, and wood-sprites, who haunt the hills and


lurk in the fares I trades, here seem doubly true, and so he meditates upon
the old myths, wandering if he shall ever see the supernatural beings in whom
he, though a Christian, still believes.

Present!}-, out of the stillness of the forest,
there arises a strain of music, a sweet and
heavenly song, like the chanting of choristers
in the choir of a great cathedral, ever-increasing
in volume till the whole forest seems filled
with celestial harmony.
Eoves listens with delight, wondering whence
the music comes, for he can see no one. After
a time the mist about the ruins seems to take
form the form of a beautiful lady and two
attendant damsels, all apparelled in brightly shin-
ing raiment. She in the midst is taller and
more beautiful than her companions.
The vision grows more and more distinct,
each line, each lineament becoming clearer and
dearer, glowing with life and colour, brilliant with celestial light. Then, like
a fleeting rainbow, the forms begin to fade; even as Eoves ga/es, the harmony
ceases, and the vision vanishes.
The sun, which at length has pierced the mist, is now beaming upon the
spot where the figures appearedthe birds break forth in song : the clouds,
lifting above the woods, roll away in great billowy masses across the now
clear sky.
Has Eoves been dreaming, or has he indeed seen a vision of angels ?
It is clear, even to his simple mind, that the matter is inexplicable by
ordinary reasoning. He must report what he has seen to the head-man of
his district, and together they will seek the holy Bishop who, perhaps, will
explain the mystery.
Fifteen miles of rough woodland lie between the Avon and the Severn, and
it is late in the afternoon when Eoves appears before the gate of St,
Peter’s monastery at Worcester.

'The Bishop listens to the swineherd's story, and resolves to accompany him
to the spot where the vision has appeared ; so after prayer and fasting Bishop
Ecgwin, Eoves, and two of the brethren of the monastery, set out towards the
Avon, walking barefoot together, devoutly singing psalms. When the little com-
pany arrives at the peninsula or hornute by which the river flows, the Bishop
leaves his companions, commanding them to wait for him. Alone, he seeks the
place where the heavenly visitants had appeared; falling upon his knees, he
prays that to him also may the vision be vouchsafed. Nor are his pravers in vain.

she holds a booh, and in the other a golden

There can be no doubt now that the

has sanctified the spot by her presence.

The visionary gave place to the substantial : a church and monastery arose
at Roves-holm, and for eight centuries the monks of the vale played an im-
portant part in the economy ot Worcestershire.

At a council held at Alne (Alcester) in the year 709 the royal charter for
founding the Abbey was confirmed,* and in 714 the church was solemnly
dedicated to the honour of the .Blessed Virgin. An ancient writing records
that in a short time St. Ecgwiu had acquired 120 farms for his church \ t
other gifts were added, and the possessions of the house became so vast, that at
the dissolution the annual income reached os. od. ; a sum representing
nearly a year, according to the present value of money.
Ihe influence of this Abbey reached far beyond the pleasant vale of Avon, and
as time went on, Evesham became the parent of many other religious houses.

was the revival of the monasteries of Wearmouth. Jarrow, Whitby, and

soil—at Odensee, in Denmark—another offshoot of Evesham took root and

The example set by tst. Ecgwin at .Evesham was followed by many a pious
Christian throughout the Wiceian land, and under the protection of the bishops
monasteries arose in pleasant spots beside the Severn and the Avon. Great
tracts of land were given to the monks by the Mercian kings, and these lands
were brought under cultivation, till the desolate wilderness became a fruitful
garden. Churches were raised in many places ; Kladbury, Brcdon, and
Pershore monasteries became centres of useful activity, and schools of religious
learning.

Ikmfl (Ma the terrible.
FFA was Alderman of the Severn Valley before he became
King of Mercia, and, in consequence, is closely connected
with the history of Worcestershire. Thingferth, his father,
claimed kinship with the kings of Mercia, and ruled as
under-king, or alderman, of the Wiccian land, till Heornred.
a usurper, drove him out. Sonic old writers say that Offa,
whose name was Winfrith, remained in his native land, and that Heornred slew
him not, because he was lame, blind, and dumb from his birth too weak and
deformed to be a rival.
After that a strange thing happened r Winfrith opened his eyes, and saw;
straightened his limbs, and walked; essayed to speak, and spoke. From that
lime he grew strong, and became a mighty warrior.
Then men said, “U! this youth is like Offa of old, who spake not till
Rigan came to fight against Wjermimd his father.” Wherefore, thenceforth they
called him, not Winfrith, but Offa ; and the people flocked to him and made
him their captain.
I hen Heornred summoned his warriors, and fought against Offa, but was
slain; and the people made Offa their king.
After he ascended the Mercian throne in a.d. 758, Offa made Tamworth
his capital ; but he appears to have had many palaces, and to have given
his name to several places in the Mercian land. Thus at Offchurch. near
Leamington, it is said his son Prince Frennmd met a cruel death, and there,
dose to his palace, in the sylvan scenery of Warwickshire, the King founded a
church in memory of the martyred hov.


THE VILLAGE STREET, OEFENHAM.




Among the Saxons, however, Offa was not an uncommon name, so it does
not follow that all places bearing this name are connected with the great
Mercian King; but the names Offmore Wood and Offmore Farm in Clent,
may possibly commemorate King Offa himself, since the land in Clent was in
the King’s demesne, and these places are near to the traditional site of a
royal hunting-lodge upon the northern side of the bleak Clent Hills.*
At Offenbam (pronounced Uffenum), a village upon the table-land above the
Avon, a mile or so before the river bends round the promontory of Evesham,
King Offa is said to have had a palace, and on that account the place was
called Offenham. Tn Domesday Kook the name is so written. The village
is on high ground commanding extensive prospects over a rich and varied
country, Roman and Saxon remains have been found there, and from early
times it was the residence of the lordly abbots of the neighbouring monastery.
Indeed, if the evidence of the Evesham charters may be relied upon, the
village bore the name Offehara in the year 709, which was before the birth of
Offa of Mercia,f
Nevertheless Offa the Terrible is known to have visited this neighbourhood,
he had extensive dealings with the monks of Worcester ; he spoiled the churchmen
of their lands sometimes, and sometimes repenting, made restitution lavishly.
He bestowed many farms, even whole villages, upon the church. Once in

Crept home, to Worcester Monastery, he came to Fladbury with all his lords,
and as he was there well feasted by Bishop Filhcre,! we may be sure he
knew tire flavour of Worcester venison and Severn salmon.
It was as a mighty warrior, and a fierce, vindictive foe, that Offa of Mercia
earned his title of “Terrible;” but under his strong rule the Wiccian land
had peace. The Welsh, hemmed in by Offa’s Dyke, that great earthwork
extending from the Wye to the mouth of the Dee, troubled the Severn
Valley no more in his clay. Churches began to be built in manors, and
in course of time these churches became parish churches, with parishes co-

extensive with the manors. Offa set. up an Archbishop of his own at Lichfield,
and established the supremacy of Mercia, but bis influence lay in his own
strong personality, and when he died in 796 the power of Mercia declined.
Kcnwulf, his successor, was prosperous, but after him came some weak kings.
Early in the ninth century Egbert, King of Wessex, claimed the over-lordship
of Mercia and obtained it, but it is worthy of remembrance that it was the
Wiccian Offa who first ruled England as one nation.

Cbe Icgcnb of St. Ikenetm, Iking anb flDartgr.
ENELM of Mercia, like other Anglo-Saxon kings, is said to
have been a descendant of Woden, the half-historical, half-
mythical hero-god of the Teutons. His father’s name was
Kemvulf; bis mother’s, CElfthrylh, .at least, so it is recorded
in the ancient chronicles ; but whether or not Kenelm was
a real personage is doubtful. However that may be, a garland
of legend and romance has been woven by laving hands around the figure
of the boy-king. Seven churches in England were dedicated to his memory,
and his shrine for centuries adorned the choir of ‘ Wlnchcombe Abbey, whither
pilgrim devotees wended their way to view the relies of the . martyred and
saintly child.
What should have led to the invention of a tale like this, if nothing of
the kind ever happened, is a difficulty not yet solved. Perhaps King Kemvulf
did leave an infant son, who was murdered as the story relates ; but the boy’s
position as king could scarcely have been established, because it was then contrary
to the custom of the English to choose either children or women to reign
over them. Certain it is that Kemvulf was an actual king, and that his
brother Keolwulf succeeded to the kingdom, but after two years was deposed
by one Beornwulf, of whom little is known.*
Amid the wild scenery of Clenl, in Worcestershire, upon the bare hillside, an
ancient chapel and holy-well, sacred to St. Kenelm, remain abiding evidences
of an age of faith ; the rural and peaceful aspect of the spot .presents a
striking contrast to the black and busy homes of industry northwards of the hill.

Florence of Worcester, writing late in the nth century, certainly regards
Kenelm as a real person, and while gravely recording the destruction by fire
of the English school at Rome in one paragraph, in the next, with equal
good faith, describes the miraculous circumstance of Kenelin’s martyrdom.

And raise my lay, and Lid lire rocks resound

The Golden legend in its antique English relates that: —X
“Saint Kenelm, martyr, was king of a part of England by Wales.
His father was king to fore him and was named Kcnulpe, and founded the
Abbey of Wynchcombe, and sett therein monks, and when he was dead be
was buried in the same Abbey ; and at that time Wynehcoinbe was the best
town of that country. ........ ...
This King Kenelm was King of Warwikshyre, Gloucetreshyre, and Wur-
cetershyre : and the bishop of Wurcclrc was bishop of those three shires.
Kenulf, his father, was a full holy man, and Dornemyllc
and Qucndrede were sisters of Saint Kenelm, and Kenulfe, his father, died
the year of our Lord viii. c. xix.
Then was Kenelm made King when he was seven years of age, and his
sister Dornemyld loved him much, and they lived holily together to then-
lives’ end.
But, Quyndre, that other sister, turned her to wickedness, and had great
envy at her brother Kenelm, because he was so rich above her, and laboured
with all her power to destroy him, because she would be queen and reign
after him, and let make a strong poison and gave it to her brother. But God
kept him that it never grieved him.
And when she saw that she could not prevail against the king in that
manner, she laboured to Askeberd, which was chief ruler about the king,
and promised to him a great sum of money, and also her hand in marriage,
if he would slay this young king, her brother, and anon, they accorded in
this treason,"

The legend oe st. kenelm, king and martyr.


The legend then relates how the little king had a marvellous dream, wherein
he saw a tree so tail that it touched the stars, so bright that it resembled
burnished gold, the branches were covered with blossoms, fruit, and burning
lights. d’he king climbed the tree, and anon, Askeherd, his governor, came
and hewed it down, so that it fell with a great crash. Then the king made
for himself white wings, as of a dove, and flew up to heaven.
Kenelm told this dream to Whvene, his nurse, who interpreted it to forebode
his death.
Soon afterwards Askehcrd took the young king to hunt in the thick woods
upon the Client Hills,* and the hoy, being weary, got down from his horse to
rest, Then Askeherd began to dig a pit wherein to bury the lad, but Kenelm,
awaking, told him the labour was in vain, for that was not the appointed
place. Then the king gave the man a small rod, telling him that at the
place he planted it there he would die. So they rode on far into the wood
till they came to a hawthorn tree, and there Askcberd planted the rod, which
forthwith bare leaves and waxed a great ashtree, and there Askehcrd smote off
the young king s head ; and, anon, his soul was borne up to heaven in likeness
of a white dove, but his body was cast into a deep pit in a valley between
two hills at Client.
Then Askeherd returned to Quendrodo and told her all that was done,
whereof she was full glad; and, anon, took on her to be queen, and charged,
on pain of death, that no man should speak of Kenelm. And his holy body
lay long time in that wood called Clent, for no man durst fetch him thence
to bury him in hallowed place for fear of Queen Quendrede,
And it was so that a poor widow who had a white cow drove it to pasture
in Clent wood daily; but the cow leaving the wood sought the valley, where
Kenelm was buried, and lay all day long by the kings grave without food,
hut when evening was come she returned home, and the milk she gave was
twice as much as that of other cows. Wherefore the place was called
“ CowbageA
Clci.t, being a Danish word. meaning fiend, a projecting, craggy rock, could no* well have been given to
the district till after Kenelm's time; but the synonymous British word "Pen" still survives in Pen Orchard, a
farm near St. Kenelm’s Chapel, arid upon the traditional site of a hunting-palace or the Mercian kings.


Now it happened on a time when the Pope sang Mass at Rome in St.
Peters Church, suddenly there came a white dove and let fall upon the altar
a scroll, and these words were written thereon in letters of gold :
“ £u Client, hi Cotobacie, |ieuclme liyughont,
|£jieth uuhcc a thorn, his hcbc of shorn.” *
And when the Pope had said Mass he showed the scroll to all the people,
but there was none that could tell what it meant, till at last there came an
Englishman and he told it openly before all. Then was the feast of St. Kenehn
hallowed that day through all Rome.
And, afterwards, the Pope sent his messengers to England to Wylfryde,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and bade him with his bishops go and seek the
place where the holy bod)' lay. The place was soon known, because of the
miracle that was shown by the white cow ; and the archbishop, with other
bishops and many people, came thither, and dug up the body with great
solemnity. And forthwith there welled up on that spot a fair spring, which is
called St. Kenelm’s Well unto this day, where much people have been healed
of divers maladies.
Now, while the body was being borne along by the people of the province
of Gloucester, an armed band of the people of Worcestershire came up, and
a dispute arose between the men of Gloucester and the men of Worcester as
to who should have the body. And there was among them a full good
man, who gave council that all should lie down and sleep (for the weather
was then -right hot), and whichever of the two shires should wake first might
take the body and go their way. To this they all agreed. The place where
they rested was called Pyriford.t
* " In Klenc kaw bathe Kenelm Kvnehearne,
LITH UNDER THORNE HEALED BV HEAUED."
In the Latin version of the Legend the verse runs
“ In ClenTho vacc.-e vali.i Kenelmus regis natus,

THU LEGEND OF ST. KENELM, KINO AND MARTYR.


it so happened that the Abbot of Winchcombe and all his men awoke first,
and they took up the holy body and bore it forth five miles towards
Winchcombe before the others arose. Moved by anger these followed with
all speed and drew near to the fugitives, who, calling on Kenelm, rushed
along a narrow path into a wood, till they came in sight of the abbey of
Winchcombe in the vale below, and being with heat and labour and thirst
nigh dead, they prayed for comfort. Then the abbot put his cross into
the earth, and forthwith a fair well of water sprang up, whereof the)' drank
ami refreshed them much. Then they again took up the body, and the monks
came in solemn procession to receive it, and with great joy and mirth bore
it into the abbey, whereupon, it is said, the bells rang without man’s hand.
Quendreda chanced to lie standing in the upper part of the west end of
St. Peter’s Church when she saw the multitude running down the hill.
Demanding what all this ringing meant, she was told * how her brother
Kenelm was brought with procession into the abbey, and that the' bells rang
without man’s help. -Seizing a psalter she thereupon began to sing the 108th
Psalm backwards, mockingly, and when she came to the verse “T.et this be the
reward of my adversary,” her two eyes fell from their sockets on to the page
where she was reading. Soon after she died wretchedly, and was cast out
into a foul myre, but the body of St. Kenelm was placed in an honourable
shrine, whereon many mighty miracles were wrought.
Thus has the story come down to our day from the far off Saxon times,
it would be presumptuous to brand it as mere fable, although there are many
discrepancies to be reconciled, and marvels to be believed. In the opinion
of one of the most competent archaeologists now living* it is not improbable
that the story had some basis of fact; that bones, supposed to be those of
Kenelm, were deposited at Winchcombe, and that these bones were taken
from the neighbourhood of Clent.
Since no other abbey had any special interest in St. Kenelm, it is probable
that the legend was written at, or for, Winchcombe, and since Florence of
Worcester, who died in a.d. jliS, quotes this story, it is also probable that

given at length ; also a good translation of the legend from the Bodleian MS.


it was written before the year hod, but the oldest MS. extant, the copy in
the Bodleian, is not earlier than a.d. 1150. '
The position of St. Kenelm’s chapel, on the northern slope of a deep valley
between two hills, corresponds with the description of the place where the
bones were found, and it may be that these bones were dug out of one of
the ancient barrows which are known to have existed near this spot.
Some years ago, when excavations were made at Winchcombe Abbey, two
stone coffins were discovered near the east end of the church ; one was of great
si/.e and contained the bones of a tall man ; the other was small, as if
intended for the remains of a child, and within it were some hones and a
rusty long-bladed knife. These remains were believed to be those of King
Kenwulf and his son St. Kenelm, hut there is little evidence to support this
belief; the coffins were rilled without being inspected by anyone competent to
judge of the period to which the interments belonged. The long-bladed knife
found in the smaller coffin corresponds with the spear-head (which is invariably
by, or sometimes under, the skull), or with the knife usually found near the
breast in Saxon interments ; for it was the custom of the Saxons to bury weapons
with their dead.
It is, however, unlikely that the remains found in the stone coffin were
those which were enshrined and carried from place to place as the hones ol
St. Kenehn.
In 1149, after Winchcombe monastery had been destroyed by fire, the relics
of St. Kenelm were sent on tour through the neighbouring counties, in order
to raise money for the rebuilding of the monastery; and on one occasion the
bones were again brought to Clent, but whether this was done when the
chapel was dedicated is not known.
The walls of this romantic and lonely tittle church hear traces of the wmrk
of Norman builders. The south doorway has mouldings with bird-beak ornament,
and a tympanum, whereon is represented a crowned t figure, seated within a
vesica-shaped aureole supported by tw r o angels- On the exterior of the south
wall, between the porch and the east end of the nave, is a rudely-caned
stone bearing the figure of a priest, popularly believed to he a portrait of St.
Kenelm. From beneath a large stone, a little to the east of the chapel, a

tTbe Stealing of tbe Sanctus 36e1l
RADITION, ever tenacious of the gruesome, has preserved a
Mj story of tire horrible flue of a sacrilegious Dane who stole
the Sanclus Hell from Worcester Cathedral,
b'pon a disastrous and long remembered day during the
period of the Danish invasion a black boat, manned by northern
sea-rovers, came up the Severn and anchored beneath the city
walls. At sight of the ferocious strangers the monks and most of the citizens
fled for safety to the woods. The men of the Raven landed, took whatever
valuables they found in city and church, murdered the few old people left
behind in the houses, set fire to the place, and returned to their ships, carrying
their booty with them.
One man, more avaricious than the rest stayed behind to steal the Sanctus
Bell. Now the Sanctus Bell was heavy, and when the thief had lowered it
to the ground he had much ado to carry it away. While he was bending
beneath his burden, the people of the city returned, and caught the thief
red-handed. Furious with rage at the insults and injuries they had received, the
monks and citizens fell upon the pirate and speedily flayed him alive; his skin,
when tanned, they nailed upon the inner side of the great west doors of the
Cathedral, as a warning to the sacrilegious in general and to marauding Danes in
particular. Portions of skin may yet be seen protruding from beneath the
massive rails of the old door, now relegated to one of the cathedral lumber
rooms.
This tradition, if not absolutely true, has a foundation upon facts no less
strange than the popular story of the Danish robber.


A similar tradition is common along the cast coast of England, where
Danish raids were frequent ; it is also found upon the banks of the Medway,
the Severn, and the Thames, in places where the Danes are known to have been.
At the picturesque hamlet of Hadstock in Essex, the story is still handed
down among the peasantry, who, till fifty years ago, were wont to direct
strangers to the north door of the little church, where, beneath the Norman
ironwork, pieces of human skin might then be seen, A portion of this skin
was exhibited at the Society of Antiquaries in 1789.
At Copford another Essex village, the same legend is told. John Dean
Rector of Copford from 1689 to 1714, in his “Church Notes” refers to a
tradition of the church having been robbed by Danes and their skin nailed to
the door, which tradition was told him in 1690 by an old man of Colchester,
who had heard it in his youth.*
On the Norman doors of the church of Castle Iledingham are some iron
hinges and scrolls, behind which have been found remains of leather, resembling
parchment. There is a tradition in the locality “ that the door was covered
with the skin of a foreign robber, who attempted to sack the church.”t
That keen observer of men and manners, Samuel Pepys, waiting in his
Diary under date April 10th, r66i, remarks :
“‘To Rochester, and there saw the cathedral . , . observing the great doors of the
church, as they say, covered with the skins of the Danes."
The tradition is now lost at Rochester.!
In the cloisters ar Westminster Abbey upon the three doors of the re-vestry,
and upon the door of the Chapel of the Pyx—-the ancient royal treasury —may

of the souls of living Christians, than with the skins of dead Danes ; but a Rochester antiquary has kindly informed
me that beyond the statements made by Pepys nothing of the tradition is now known,

portion of hard dry skin, which he submitted to an expert* for examination,
with the result that Mr. Quekett, the expert, declared the skin and the hairs
upon it to be of human origin,!
Some fifty years ago, Albert Way and Jabez Allies, Fellows of the Society
of Antiquaries, obtained specimens of leather taken from the doors of Hadstock
and Copford churches and from Worcester Cathedral; these specimens were sent
to Mr. Quekett, who, after microscopic examination, reported that all three were
undoubtedly human skin, the hairs upon them were human, probably of a
light-haired person, % The same conclusion was arrived at by another expert
working independently.lf
Upon the doors of some churches built during the Norman period, mystic
figures in wrought-iron, of ruder character than the ornament with which they
are associated, arc occasionally found. These ornaments appear to have originated
with the Danes. The grim tradition which records that Danes’ skins were
nailed to church doors, has, perhaps, perpetuated the custom of stretching
dressed skins of scarlet hue over the wood and under tinned or gilt ironwork
to enhance their decorative effect.s
As to the antiquity of the great doors of Worcester Cathedral, upon which
the skin was fastened, authorities differ: some supposing they were made in the
tqlh century, others that they are of Norman, if not of Saxon workmanship.
Certain it is they have an ancient appearance ; they are massive and unadorned,
except by plain bands of iron, and bear traces of having been altered after
they were made. The curved top of the doors corresponds with the arch-
line of the old west doorway, which was Norman' work of the 12th century.
In the 14th century the great north porch was built, and then, probably, the
old west doors were removed to the new porch.
* Mr. Qiwkett, of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons,
t On August 27th, iS3S, Mr. Clark visited Westminster and found pontons of the skin still remaining on
11 an old disused door in the corridor by the entrance to the Chapter House."
{ The Museum of the College of Surgeons, Lincoln's Inn, Loudon, possesses the three specimens of skin
obtained by Mr. Way from Worcester, Hadstock, and Copford. In the Museum at Audiey End are two pieces,
one from Worcester, the other from Hadstock, a third is preserved in the Chapter House, Worcester, and a
fourth is in the possession of J. Noake, Esq., J.P., of the same city.
11 Ey (he kindness of Mr. J. Noake, Lite writer has been allowed to examine a portion of the human leather from
Worcester Cathedral door. The relic might be mistaken for a piece of an old boot ; it is of a rusty brown colour, and
the man from whose body it came must have been au exceedingly thick-skinned person.
3 Mr, J, Surkie Gardner, ‘'lronwork," South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks, 1893, p. 4S,


The two western bays of the nave escaped the fires which destroyed the
cathedral in the 13th century, and it is not impossible that the doors referred
to may have belonged to even an earlier building. However, that may be, they
are extremely interesting relics of the ancient church ; and deserve a more
honourable resting-place than the one they at present occupy in a lumber-
room leading to the library.*
For the punishment of sacrilege many laws have been enacted. In King
Alfreds’ time, robbery of a church was punished by fine, and the cutting-off
of the guilty hand; this penalty, however, might be commuted- The Anglo-
Saxon and Norman laws often inflicted barbarous punishments, flaying,
excoriation, maiming, and scourging. In the laws of Henry I. (1100-1135), h was'
enacted that if any man slew his lord there should be no redemption, but by
scalping or having, .so the punishment of flaying was well-known in the 12th
century.
In the only instance —at Westminster—where the origin of the human leather
nailed to a door has been accounted for, the punishment seems to have
been inflicted in the 14th century. Dean Stanley believed that the facts
connected with the tradition at Westminster were too stubborn to be con-
tradicted; they are briefly as- follows. in the summer of 1303, King
Edward T was on his Scottish wars, and bad reached Linlithgow, when he
heard the news that the immense hoard on which he depended for his supplies
had been carried off from the Treasure House at Westminster Abbey.
The Abbot and forty-eight monks were sent to the 'Lower and a long trial
took place.t At length the Abbot and the rest of the fraternity were released,
but the charge was brought home to the Sub-Prior and the Sacristan, who had
helped one Richard de Podicote in the robbery. It is probable that these
men were flayed alive and their skins fixed upon the. door of the Chapel of
* In reply to an inquiry as to the dale of these interesting doors, I received the following communication from
Mr. J. Startle Gardner, the chief authority on English Mediaeval ironwork:—
"The hinges on the Worcester doors are very much plainer than would be expected in a cathedral at an early
period, though quite two-thirds of the Norman doors remaining have nothing more elaborate, I atn afraid there is
nothing in them to indicate the date, but of course the human skin must be early and ought to settle the date of
the doors, as it is not conceivable that new ironwork would have teen applied to old doors in the century
without removing the leather.”

the Pyx, the Treasury; savage trophies to remind the monks of the fate of
their covetous predecessors.*
But it does not follow, because in a single instance the barbarous
custom of nailing skin upon a church door was put in practice, in the 14th
century that the Worcester tradition of an earlier practice is false. Wc know
that the Danes sailed farther up the Severn, even to Bewdley, where they took
the village of Ribbesford, whose inhabitants were required to provide Worcester
monastery with fishing nets and hunting implements.!
How the sea-rovers came up the Severn and destroyed the monastery at
Decrhurst, how they came to Worcester leaving behind them a track of blood
and fire, pillage, and devastation, so that Bishop Werefrlth had to leave his
see and become an exile in a foreign land, is recorded in ancient writings of
the Priory, Heming the monk relates how the heathen Danes preyed upon
church lands and goods. The silver and gold ornaments of the altars were taken,
the clasps and covers of books, the chalices and crosses melted, and the tenants
of the church black-mailed. For such offences as these, flaying was, in those
barbarous times, a not unusual punishment. X
Whether the skin upon the old doors at Worcester be that of a Dane or
not, the fact remains that it is human, and must have been placed there ages
ago, as a terrific warning to all evil doers.

_r HERE is at Oxford, in the Bodleian Library, a venerable MS,,*
S'!
j Ml which must rave an especial interest for Worcestershire
people : it is supposed to be the very copy of Pope
Gregory’s treatise on the Pastoral Office given by King Alfred
the Great to Werefrith, bishop of the Wiccians, with an
injunction that it should not be removed from the Minster.f
“ Alfred feasted on the delights of learning, like a bird bringing goodly
morsels to her nest, like a bee gathering honey from every dower,” says Asser
the biographer. Washing his people also to take delight in books, the king

t The specialists whom I have consulted, say that the writing of this MS. is not early enough t 0 **
contemporary with Alfred, but it may be a very ancient copy. Although I cannot claim a special knowledge
of this branch of paleography, it appears to me, from a careful examination of the MS. with documents in
the English hand of known date, that it corresponds with writing dating from about a.d. 9-20, It cannot be
earlier than A.D. Eyo, because Piegmund is referred to £s Archbishop, and he was not appointed till that y ear '

provided them with literature. The choicest Latin works known to him he
either himself translated, or caused scholars, some of whom came from France
and Germany, and some from Mercia, to translate into the Saxon language,
the language of his people.
For history Alfred took Orosius, a Spanish historian of the sth century,
whose work claimed to be a universal history, and w r as the only book of the
kind available. He added to Orosius a sketch of the new geographical
discoveries in the north, and a narrative of two brave sea-captains, Othere
and Wulfstan, whom he sent to the North Sea and the Baltic on voyages
of discovery.
For the history of his own land he took selections from Beda’s “ Ecclesiastical
History,” giving them a West-Saxon form.
For philosophy the king translated “ The Consolation of Philosophy,” written
in prison by Boethius, Minister of Theodoric the Ostrogoth.
For theology, still holding fast to English traditions, Alfred chose Tope
Gregory’s treatise on the “Pastoral Office.” This book was at Canterbury
among those given by Gregory to St. Augustine ; when it was translated, and
several copies made, the king sent one to every bishop m his kingdom. Two
of these copies are believed to be extant,* viz., Bishop Wulfsige’s of Sherborne,
and Bishop Werefrith's of Worcester.
The preface to the Worcester copy is so interesting that it is here given
at some length, not only as showing what was the state of learning in England
one thousand years ago, but also on account of its direct bearing upon local
history. It proves that in those early times Worcester was regarded as one
of the centres of civilisation, and her church selected as the resting place of
a valuable manuscript, the gift of England's wisest king—Alfred the Great.
It proves, moreover, that Alfred intended the monastery to become a school
for children of the upper classes of his Mercian subjects ; a school which has
been continued under varying conditions down to the present day. The Danes,
indeed, had plundered and ravaged the land, but Alfred restored prosperity and
order even to this remote corner of his kingdom.

The king’s prefatory epistle runs as follows:
►i* Tins Book shall to Wigora cestre.*
“King Alfred bids greet Bishop Wrerferth with his words lovingly and with friendship; and
I let it be known to thee that it hath very often come into my mind what wise men there
formerly were throughout England, both of ' spiritual and secular condition, and how kings,
who then had the government of this folk, obeyed God and His messengers, and how they
preserved peace, morality, and order, at home, and at the same time increased their land
abroad, and how then they sped, both in war and wisdom ; and also the religious orders,
how earnest they were both in teaching and learning, as well as in all the services they
should do to God.
And, how men from abroad sought wisdom and instruction in this land, and how we must
now get them from without if we would have them; so clean was learning {at the tune of
my fallen off among the English race, that there were very few on this side of
the Humber who were able to understand their rituals in English, or even to turn a letter
from Latin into English; and, I think that there were not many beyond the Humber, So
few there were of them that I cannot remember even one south of the Thames, when I first
took to the Kingdom.’ 1
The king then commands Were frith to disengage his mind from worldly
things as often as possible that lie may bestow his wisdom in heavenly matters
upon the people about him, and the letter continues
“When I called to mind all this, I remember how I saw, ere that all in them was laid
waste and burnt up, how the Churches throughout all England stood filled with treasures and
books, and there was also a great multitude of God’s servants. But they knew very little
use of those books, for that they could not understand anything of them, because they were
not written in their own language, as if they had said, 1 Our forefathers who exe-while held
these places, loved wisdom, and through it got wealth, and left it to us. In this, wc may
still see their tracks, but we know not how to tread in their footsteps, because we have lost
both that wealth and that wisdom, for we would not incline our hearts after their example.’ ”
Alfred then inquires, How 7 was it that the good men of old did not trans-
late some of their books into English ? ■ He answers his question by the
remark, “They did not think that men would ever become so careless, or
that learning would so decrease ; of set purpose they let it alone, washing that
there might be more wisdom in the land and more languages known.” But
the king remembered the example set by the Greeks and Romans, who had
translated the choicest books of other nations into their own language, and he
determined to provide a store of knowledge for his people, so that all English

boys, sons of freemen, rich enough to devote their early years to study, might
learn to read English books ; then youths of particular aptitude might further
be taught Latin. The letter continues : -
“ When I remembered bow the knowledge of Latin had formerly fallen away throughout the
English race—though many knew how to read writing in English—then began I among other
unlike and manifold businesses of this kingdom, to turn into English the book which is named
in Latin, Pas'oralis, and in English, The. Shepherds Book, one while word for wand, another
while meaning for meaning, so far as I learnt it with Plegmimd, my Archbishop, and with
Asser, my Bishop, and with Grimbold, my Mass-Priest, and with John, my Mass-Priest,
After I had learned them so that I understood them with the fullest comprehension, I
turned them into English; and to each bishop’s see in my kingdom, I will send a copy;
and on each is an lestel,* that Is of the value of 50 mancuses.
And, I bid in God's name that no man take the Kstel from the book, nor the book front
the Minster. It is uncertain how long there may be so learned bishops, as now, thank God,
there are nearly everywhere. For this reason, I would that the books should remain at their
place, unless the Bishop wall have them with him, or Lhey be anywhere lent, or some one
write others by them.”
The letter concludes with a few verses of poetry, probably composed by Alfred
himself, describing how Augustine brought the works of Pope Gregory across
the sea, how Alfred translated them and sent them to his bishops.
The manuscript is beautifully written in several hands ■ the reduced facsimile
at the head of this section will give the reader some idea of English hand-
writing of the period.
Bishop Werefrith, to whom King Alfred wrote tins letter, had been trained
in Worcester Monastery. He was ordained bishop on June yth, a.d. 873.
About that time the Pagan Danes were troubling England exceedingly, and
Werefrith, being a lover of peace and of a studious disposition, left his
diocese and made his way to France, where, either at the court of Charles
the Bald, or in the shelter of a secluded monastery, he remained in exile till
Alfred recalled him to England in the year 885, the year in which the Kings of
Wales are said to have made peace with Alfred. Worcester being a border see, it
was important that a man on whom the king could rely should be bishop there.
Ten years before Werefrith had gained a concession for his diocese from
Ceolwulf, “ that weak thane,” whom the Danes made King of Mercia.
So the diocese of Worcester was exempt from providing food for the king’s

horses and their grooms,* a very necessary concession, because the Danes had
in the preceding year reduced to subjection the whole kingdom of Mercia, the
horrors of war had been felt throughout the land, and especially it would seem
in the country of the Wiccian.s. Some say that King Alfred fought the Danes
at Alfrick, five miles north of Malvern, pointing to Ravenhills in that parish

At the time of Bishop Wercfrith’s return Worcester was desolate, or at least
ruinous. The city and monastery had to he rebuilt before the people and the
monks could again take up their abode there i so the bishop spent some time
with the king translating books and assisting Plegmund, afterwards Archbishop
of Canterbury, who also was a Mercian by birth. Werefrith’s special task was
to translate the “ Dialogues of Pope Gregory; to this book also Alfred wrote
a touching preface, in which he calls the translator his true friend, and writes
pathetically that there is need for him (Alfred) to turn his mind to these
heavenly things amid his earthly troubles. Truly the troubles of Alfred, like
those of David of old, were of no common order. On the other hand
Alfred had a full share of blessings, among which his daughter, the Princess
Ethelfleda, may be counted not the least ; her marriage with Ethelred, Alderman
of the Mercians, caused the Princess to spend the greater part of her time
in the Midlands, where “ The Lady of the Mercians” was instrumental in
ejecting much that was useful and beneficial to her subjects. Ethelred’s
position as ruler in Mercia differed from that of the old kings, whose race
became extinct about that time ; he was simply Alfred’s Viceroy, appointed
after the Peace of Wedmore (a.d. 878), whereby Western Mercia had been
given to Alfred, so that it became Iris, not as dependant state, but as a part
of his kingdom.
The city of Worcester was re-bulk after it had been destroyed by the
Danes, and a fortress and a monastery rose side by side. Ethelred and
Ethelfleda granted to the citizens their first charter.*
Alfred, probably, held a Witenagemot, or great assembly, in Worcestershire,
either at Worcester or at Droitwich. Bishop Wercfrith was present, and is
mentioned in a charter which was then signed ; it is not dated, but Kemble
assigns it to about the year a.d. 894, it runs somewhat as follows:
Ethelraed, the Alderman of Mercia, and Princess Ethelfleda {daughter of Alfred), at the
request of We refrith their friend, command the Turh f at Worcester to be built, and also
- Hetning. No document of this kind of an earlier dale than the reign of Richard I. is now extant at
Worcester Guild Hall, nor L 3 this wonderful since Ethelred's Charter relates to the church rather than to
the city. Charters are said to have been granted to the city by Wulfere (659-676), OlTa (753-796), and Edgar
(958-975).

God's praise to lie there upraised ; and they grant to God and St. Peter at Worcester half
their right, both in market and in street, within the Byrig and without, Were/mh, the
Bishop, and his family, promise to perform certain services for the health of the souls of
the Alderman and the Princess. But the wain-shilling and load-penny, that is the toll of
a shilling on a market cart and a penny on a horse load, arc to go to the King’s hand
as they always did at Saltwich, that is Droitwich.
This deed was witnessed by King Alfred and all the Witan in Mercia. It
fixes the date, within a few years, of the refounding of the monastery and
city, it provides for the building of fortifications, presumably the castle mound,
it is the most important record relating to the early history of Worcester.
Some years earlier, the Witan had assembled at Droitwich; this early
glimpse of the salt-town is obtained from a concession grunted in the year
a. ix 888, and bearing Alfred’s signature,* from which it seems probable that
the king himself was present at the meeting. Indeed, it is probable that
Alfred mapped out the shires in Mercia, which fact, Professor Freeman thought,
gave rise to the fable that Alfred divided the whole of England into shires, t
Just as Mercia was split up into five dioceses by Ethelred, so was it now'
parcelled off into shires by Alfred (probably), and in each case a city gave its
name to a shire ; the land of the Wi reams became the shires of Worcester,
(Gloucester, and part of Warwick. Across the border, in Wessex, in vain we
may seek for a city which gives its name to a shire, for in Wessex the civil
divisions are older than the ecclesiastical, but in Mercia, excepting some modern
changes, the ecclesiastical divisions are older than the civil.
In conclusion, let us try to draw a mental picture of the great king
riding into Worcestershire; he is surrounded by nobles, warriors, and. literary
friends: he brings with him, perhaps, one of those ambassadors, whom he
sent with alms to Rome and India, so that he may talk with him of the wise
customs of the nations of the East. Sweet perfumes and brilliant gems, presents
from Indian princes, he bestows upon the churches he visits on the w'ay, where
some of these gifts are kept as precious relics till as late as the 12th century,
We may imagine Ethelred and bis noble wife, the Princess Ethelfleda, riding
out to meet the king, and the affectionate greeting between father and daughter.

How the court was held at Hroitwich, and the king sat in council with his

Co see their king and gazed at him as he rode through the Worcestershire
forests.
The memory of great King Alfred should he held in reverence by Worcester
folk today, for to him, more than to any other man, they owe the refounding
of their ancient city, the refounding of their ancient church and school, and
in all probability the planning of their shire as it substantially exists to this
day. While looking at the pages of King Alfred’s book, they should remember
that he who gave it also gave them Worcestershire.

St. Smnstan ant> St. ®swa!s.
HERE is no necessity for introducing St. Dunstan in this
narrative before a.o. 957, in which year the people of
Mercia and Northumbria rebelled against Edwy, King of
'iSgf England,, and proclaimed his brother Edgar King of the
country northwards from the Thames. Dunstan, who was then
in exile at the monastery of St. Peter’s. Ghent, was at once
recalled to take the place of chief councillor to the new King of mid-England.
Soon afterwards Kinewokl, Bishop of Worcester, a man of deep humility
died. He it was who bought twenty hides of land at Alvechurch, and gave
them to the church at Worcester, a possession which the Dean and Chapter
retain in part to this day. Dunstan was preferred to the vacant See, and
Odo, Archbishop of Canterbury, consecrated him. In the following year the
bishopric of London also was given to him, so that he held the two sees conjointly
for a year and a half, being Bishop of Worcester altogether about three years
only, hut that was long enough to enable Dunstan to comprehend the needs
of the province.
Now at that time King Edgar was hue a lad of sixteen, and the govern-
ment was virtually in the hands of this great churchman, in whom were
united the skill of an artificer, the wisdom of a philosopher, and the resources
of a statesman. A man of wide perception, of cultivated tastes, of well
regulated habits, Dunstan stands alone as the one capable leader among the
Englishmen of his day.
In the year 959 Edwy All-fair died and Edgar was chosen to succeed his
brother, so the divided kingdoms were united again.


The Archbishop of Canterbury was in that year frozen to death whilst
crossing the Alps on his way to Rome, whither he was travelling to receive
the pallium. Dunstan, finding no one so able
as himself to hold the primacy, took it, and
Unis united in his own person all the chief
offices in the State ; but to hold two important
bishoprics as well as the primacy was too much even
for a man of Dunstan’s capability; so Oswald,
the Archbishop’s faithful friend, was inducted to
the See of Worcester. From tire days of Alfred
to those of Dunstan little progress had been
made towards a higher state of culture, either
in Church or State. The Northmen had re-

and the canons attached to great churches led sensual
and worldly lives, quite at variance with their holy
professions. During his exile, and subsequent journey
to Rome, Dunstan had seen the benefits of the
stricter rule of monastic life instituted Ly St. Bene-
dict, and generally adopted on the Continent; had
seen how the monks worked at various useful
occupations making wildernesses into gardens, barren
heaths or pestilential swamps into cornfields, orchards,
vineyards, or rich pastureshow they Instructed
the young, multiplied books, and worked at useful arts and industries; living by
strict rule, and not in the lax fashion of earlier times.

He knew that reform nmh begin with the teachers, and in the spirit of a
great statesman, set himself to the task of establishing the Benedictine
monks in England—first, at Winchester; secondly, at Worcester, If regarded
in the light of an allegory, there may be some truth in the old fable, which
relates how St. Dunstan took up the tongs and caught the Devil by the nose,
as subsequent events at Worcester show.
The new Bishop of Worcester became Dunstarfs instrument in effecting
the reforms. Oswald, —a man nearly allied to an Archbishop of York, nephew
to Odo of Canterbury, and related by marriage to the Emperor Otho 1.,—0f
Danish descent, as handsome in person as noble by birth, had been in-
structed in all the learning of the time. He was first made a secular Canon
of Winchester, but left that place to become a monk of the Order of St.
Benedict in the monastery of Fleury on the Loire, where he was ordained
both deacon and priest.
It was in 960 that Dunstan suggested to the King that the young monk of
Eleury was a fit man upon whom to confer the See of Worcester. Nine years
passed, during which the bishops worked quietly for their end. The King,
under the tutelage of his prime minister, had become a wise statesman, and as
anxious for social progress as any one in iris kingdom, ’ At last the time had
come for Dunstan and Oswald to give effect to their designs.
More than two centuries before King Edgars time, the Council of Clovesho
(a.u. 747) had recommended the rule of St. Benedict, but the Chapter of
Worcester preferred the order of secular canons, and about that time the
secular college of St. Peter and the monastic society of St. Mary, which be-
fore had been one and the same, became distinct foundations.* During the
period of anarchy, caused by the Danish intrusion, both establishments became
disorganised, and the canons, who appear to have been the richer, caused no
little scandal by their unseemly conduct, at least, so say the monkish chroniclers.
Of the regulars immediately preceding Dunstan’s days we have no trace;
perhaps they had become extinct, or nearly so, in Worcester.
Dr, Stubb., Worcester in Sth Century." instituted the order of Crowns about the middle of the
sih century. To this order, after a la* fashion the canons of Worcester belonged.


The cathedral clergy were the parochial clergy of the city. The cartons,
like monks, had a common dormitory, and a common refectory ; they lived
in a cloister, but retained a life-interest in property, did not wear die monk's
cowl, and could marry if they chose to do so.*
the essential difference between a cathedral and an abbey-church is this:
die abbey-church is intended tor the use of the monks dwelling in seclusion
in the abbey, the cathedral is the chief church of a district! and the canons
exist in order that the services ot the cathedral may be maintained.t At
Worcester the bishop was the head both of the canons and the monks.
bishop Oswald brought about his reform by a consistent policy : first he
impoverished the canons by granting leases of their lands to his friends.!
but to deprive the seculars ot their wealth was not enough, it was necessary to
supplant as well as to undermine the college. A new church arose beside
the old one on the spot where the churchyard now bounds the Cathedral
choir on the north,j|
Before ten years had expired, Oswald had so far completed his work, that
Winsige, the churchward of St. Teters, peacefully handed over the keys, deeds,
and possessions of his college to the bishop, and retired to pass three years
-of prohibition at Ramsey Monastery. later lie became a monk, and was
installed Abbot of St. Mary’s,
Only two out of eighteen canons of Worcester omitted to sign the episcopal
Charter of a.d. 977, and the benedictine rule then established remained the
chief power for good or evil in the county for the next six hundred years.
Obedience, labour, worship, were the three leading principles of the Benedictine
monk’s life; for St. benedict counted labour second only to the salutary
discipline of obedience. Karlier teachers believed the foundation of individual

t It has been calculated that he gave away in this way, for a period of three lives, 190 hides of land, whereas the
whole Hundred of Oswaldslow contained but 300 hides. This Ecclesiastical Hundred contained all the possessions;
jointly belonging to the bishop snd the Monastery of St. Mary. King Edgar gave all the manors belonging
thereto immunities, and consolidated them into one hundred, which has ever since borne St. Oswald's name.

liberty, and as a consequence
equality. Handicraft, study,
and religious exercises were
enjoined with no rivalry, and
the golden rule established
that a monk should prefer his
brother's good to his own.
But there was in this system,
beautiful as it appeared, a
fatal flaw. That which was
possible to St. Benedict and
bis little circle of enthusiasts
dwelling on the mountain top,
was impracticable in the great
world below. It was impos-
sible for all men to become
monks, or for all monks to
become perfect men.
Worcester is but an early
example of the change which
was taking place all over
England. The decree: —“That
the Seculars for their concu-
binage and lascivious lives
should be turned out, and
the sober and chaste monks
should be put in their places,”*
was published in a.u. 9G9, and that year marks the incoming of the Benedictines,

Worcester, sub. Anno 969,


Westbury-on-Trim had long been noted for its monastic laxity. There
Oswald settled twelve monks from Fleury, under his old friend nnd fellow-
student Germamis. From Westbury he sent nut a little band of monks to
re-organise Ramsey, in Huntingdonshire. At Winehcombe, at Pershore and at
Evesham regular monks also supplanted the secular canons, but not without
resistance was this change effected. After the death of Edgar, Alphere of
Mercia tried to efface Oswald’s work, and succeeded in restoring the seculars
both at Evesham and Pershore. Oloucester alone of all the greater
monasteries withstood Oswald’s endeavour to set up a stricter rule, and it was
not till the nth century that the Penedictines got a footing there. In the
Dioceses of Ely and St, Albans the Bishop of Worcester succeeded in bringing
about similar reforms, and in a.d. 97 2 he was promoted to the Archbishopric
of York, but he administered the affairs of that province chiefly from Worcester,
where he was better able to counteract the conservative influence of the Mercian
Prince Alphere.*
Archbishop Dunstan died in the “odour of sanctity/' “on Saturday, the four-
teenth of the calends of June (19 May), in the first indication, in the year
988,” writes Florence the monk, anti four years later the same chronicler
records :
“a.d. 992.--St. Oswald, the Archbishop, departed this life, and soared to the
blissful kingdom of heaven, in the fifth indication, on Monday, the second of
the calends of March (29 February), and was interred in the Church of St.
Mary at Worcester, which he had built from the foundations.”
William of Malmsbury relates that the day before the Bishop died he stood
at his door, steadfastly" gu/.ing on the sky, nnd shedding tears. M hen asked
why he did this, he replied “ Suffer me, my brethren, to look up to the
place where I intend to go, for I must shortly put off this body, and the
time of my r dissolution drawetb near.'’ At which they wondered, because he
* Os wait! was the first of four bishops in succession who held the See of Worcester together with the Arch-
bishopric of York. This may be accounted for by the fact that the power of Wessex grew feeble, and the
more northern parts of England were rising in importance, so that it became part of the policy of the English
kings to preserve the union between northern and southern England by means of one official interested in these
two parts of the kingdom. .
To Oswald we owe the foundation of the historic school of Worcester. From Fleury he invited Abbo, the
greatest scholar in Gaul, and set him over the monks of Ramsey. Germanus, Fulbert, Ednotk, are ike names
of other learned monks to whom, and to their successors, we owe the old English Chronicle.


appeared in good health. Going into the Oratory, he called together the
brethren, and received from them the holy unction and the sacrament. The
next day he, according to his custom, washed the feet of certain poor people,
and then kneeling down to say the hymn Glmia Pain', peacefully gave up
the ghost.

St. Oswald, who appears to have directed the work personally, was vexed at
this, and prayed that the cause of the hinderance might be made known to
him; immediately his eyes were opened, and he saw seated upon the stone
a little black devil, who, with obscene gestures, derided the panting workmen.
The Saint rose to the occasion, and exorcised the evil spirit, by the sign of
the cross ; then the stone, which eighty men could not move before, was by
three persons easily lifted up, and put in the place intended for it.

EFORE the tme of accurate geological knowledge people
!% vHD ](fi| WCIC wont to re^er any strange phenomenon to super-
S natural, or diabolical agency ; thus, wonder-stories, delightful
in their naivetl\ have become common all over England.
WM mythical and traditional lore giants and devils
are frequently convertible personages. The feats performed by
giants in Cornwall, such as hurling huge rocks and striding across valleys, are
more usually attributed in the Midlands and the north to the evil spirit;* there
must be a reason for this. Many of these awful beings seem to be little more
than degraded forms of the original Aryan personifications of the forces of nature,
altered according to the religious systems from which they have been viewed.
It is, however, difficult to understand why the making of the Wrekin
should be assigned to a giant, while the creation of an isolated rock, known as
“The Devil's Spittleful/’ a few miles lower down the Severn valley, between
Kidderminster and Ecwdley, should be ascribed to Satan.
* C. Hardwick, “Traditions and Koik-Lorc,'’ iipz ( pp. 205209,


The Devil's Spittlcful has an artificial, almost an uncanny, appearance when
viewed from the south-west; a conical mass ol sandstone, some forty feet
high, rises abruptly out of the surrounding heath. The length over the top
of the mound, from base to base, is 320 feet, the circumference, at the base,
S"i feet. A broad ditch, now dry or nearly so, but bearing abundant traces
of having formerly contained water, almost encompasses the hill; a thick-set
grove of fir trees covers the steep sides, and between the tree trunks can be
dimly seen the entrance to a gloomy looking cavern. The dying branches of
an ancient yew, contorted and snake-like, partly conceal the moss-grown rocks
above the cave, which, although not so large as might be supposed from
the appearance of the entrance, contains the remains of a hearth and
chimney; the black incrustation upon the roof and walls indicates that this
strange house has served as an abode of man, and there are traces of other
chambers in the cliff.
When, or by whom, these dwellings were hewn out of the solid rock is
not known, but their existence points to a condition of domesticity very
different from that of the present time. Whether the caves were the abode of
primitive man, or of outlaws and hermits in the middle ages, or even of some
poor cotters since the Reformation, is hard to determine; but, judging from
appearances, the rock was formerly an island in a lake or marsh —a suitable
retreat for people seeking an asylum among the swamps and forests of the
Severn valley.
The natives of the district relate the following legend concerning this
curious isolated bill :
L ‘ Showing that how the ohl original Nick
Sought on the Hewdley folk to play a trick,
In which, I’m glad to say, he was defeated,
And by a crafty cobbler fairly cheated. - ’*
A cobbler, who had been to Bcwdley to fetch some boots to mend, found
himself belated among the hills a mile or so from Wribbenhall, in the
“Foreign” of Kidderminster.
O. Griffith, Prologue to “The Devil’s Spadeful/' Reminiscences and Record?, tSSo, p.


The night was so dark that cobbler Tom could not sec the way, so he
lay down upon a sandy bank to wait till morning.; presently he fell asleep,
and must have slept some time, for when he awoke daylight was
breaking. Beside him was standing a strange looking old man, carrying a
huge spadeful of earth. “ How far is it to Bewdley ? ” asked the stranger.
The cobbler suspecting that he had to deal with one of evil designs, replied,
guardedly, “It is a long way, a long way!”
“ Oh, indeed,” said Satan, for he it was, “ I have come a great distance
and have missed my way among these hills. Can 1 get there before
sunrise?” “No,” replied the cobbler. “Do you mind telling me what is
your business at Bewdley?”
Satan, thinking it would be best to humour a man who might be a
useful guide, replied: “The people of the town have grown 100 good and
prosperous of late; I have permission to drown the inhabitants, by blocking
the Severn with this spadeful of earth, hut the work must fie done before
sunrise; I have lost my way, and the time is .nearly up.”
The cobbler bethought him that il would be no sin to mislead Satan, so
holding up the bag of old boots, he emptied the contents on the ground.
Quoth he, “Do you see these old hoots? Call me a sinner if I’ve not worn
them all out since I left Bewdley town. You won’t get there to-night, or
to-morrow either.”
Just then the sun rose above the horizon; the Prince of Darkness perceiving
tins, dropped die great rock a mile from the river, and disappeared. The
rock remains there lo this day, and is popularly known as the Devil’s

Ipersborc Bbbe\n
KRSHORE, noted for the fertility of its land, and for a precious
w'fj) W fragment of u venerable abbey, is a pleasant country town,
beautifully situated in the Avon Valley, five miles west of
Evesham.
Wj To the abbey founded at Pershore, according to William
of Malmsbury, in the year 604, or, as more reliable
historians say, in 689, the town owed both origin and prosperity: after the
dissolution, though retaining privileges of fairs and markets, the place “went
very much to ruin, and was in great poverty,”* till about the middle of the
iSth century, when it was practically reconstructed, and is now one of the
neatest little towns in Worcestershire.
Since the prosperity of Pershore depends largely upon the fruit harvest, it
is said that plentiful years produce an independent spirit among the natives,
who reply to any stranger chancing to ask the name of the place:--
“ Pershore! where do ye think ? ” Should the fruit crop fail, the desponding
ejaculation is : —“ Pershore, God help us ! ”
Secular canons at first held the monastery, but before the end of the 10th
century St. Oswald established Benedictines there as w r ell as at Worcester,
Evesham, and Winchcombe; the church, originally dedicated to the Virgin,
St. Peter, and St. Paul, was dedicated anew in honour of St. Mary, and
also St. Edburga, of whom it may be well to give a few particulars.
Edburga, the saintly daughter of Edward the Elder, from early childhood
showed a predilection for religion. One day her father offered her glittering
jewels and gold in one hand, and a Gospel-book and chalice in the other.
Edburga chose the book and chalice.

performing many good
works in that sphere
of life. She died in
“ the odour of sanc-
tity,’ 1 and was buried
with her ancestors in
the Royal sepulchre
at Winchester, but
some of her bones
were purchased at a
great price, brought
to Pershore, and en-
shrined in the Abbey
Church there. This
was a pecuniary ad-
vantage to the Mon-
astery, because the
reputation of the
royal virgin, and the
miracles wrought at
her shrine, . attracted
devotees.
How great was the
religious zeal of the
Saxons in Worcestershire may be seen by tire number of religious houses
suppressed before the Norman Conquest. These were the Monasteries of Block-
ley. Bradley, Brcdon, Cliffe, Daylesford, Fladbury, Hanbury, Kempsey, Peni-
tanham (? Pensham, near Pershore), Ripple, Sture-in-Usmere (Kidderminster),
and Wittington. Besides these, there were in the diocese nine suppressed
monasteries in Gloucestershire and three in Warwickshire, making a total of
twenty-four. ,
Monasteries being then so numerous, it is not surprising to find that


ecclesiastics played an important part in the early history of Worcestershire. The
Saxons, emerging from a state of fierce barbarity, reached the pleasant fields
of England. Now, at last, the tribes had found the Isles of the Sea and
the uttermost parts of the West. Wanderers no longer, subservient to destiny,
they subsided; laying aside sword and spear in order to wield spade and
reaping-hook, they became peaceful agriculturalists, devoted to their village com-
munities, as enthusiastic in their piety and love of religion as formerly they
had been fierce and cruel. They had lost much of their warlike nature when
the Danes came. Their manner of life was changed. They became a prey to
the northern invaders, just as the earlier inhabitants of the land had fallen a
prey to the Saxons themselves at their coming.
The Danish invasion seriously affected the monasteries. Many of the smaller
houses were abandoned, others were absorbed into bishopries or greater religious
institutions.
In the early history of Pershore we have an excellent example of the vicissi-
tudes through which most ancient monasteries passed. The Abbey, founded in
this sequestered Worcestershire valley by an early Saxon prince, fell a prey to
the rapacious Danes, survived a fiery ordeal, and received the Benedictine rule,
Worcester and Evesham Monasteries alone in all the county could be com-
pared with it for number and richness of possessions. Edward the Confessor,
seeking endowments for his great foundation upon the banks of the Thames, cast
an eye on this wealthy monastery by Avail’s shore, and deprived it of more than
half its broad acres, bestowing them upon Westminster Abbey. The Conqueror
confirmed this grant. Hence, in a great measure, the important place held by
the Church of Westminster in the Domesday Survey of Worcestershire.
For the use of tenants on Westminster lands the Confessor founded St.
Andrew’s Church, adjoining the abbey at Pershore, but the monks retained the
right of burying the people of many of the neighbouring villages, and St.
Andrew’s was attached to the convent about the year 1337.
Kings John, Henry 111., Henry V., and Edward 11. granted the abbey many
privileges. Edward I, visited the town, and stayed there eight days in izSt, and
again in 1294. Henry 111. granted aid to the monks after a fire in 1223,
and gave (hem the right to hold a fair on St. Edburga's Day—July 7th.

PERSHORE ARBKY.


Owing to these and many other benefactions, Pershore maintained her place
among the great abbeys of the county, and has to be reckoned as one in that
remarkable group of Benedictine monasteries (rivalled only by another group
in the Fen country), for which Worcestershire and Gloucestershire are famous.

It is probable that these western
Benedictine houses were con-
tinued and added to by the
Normans for political as well as
religious reasons. The abbeys
formed a line of defence against
the Welsh. More than once
were the tenants of the churches
called to arms to defend the
passage of the Severn, or to
meet the enemy in open field.*
That the monks of Pershore
took a proper share in educat-
ing the youth of Worcestershire
is proved by the fact that at
Gloucester Hall in Oxford there
was a cell where the novices of
Pershore Abbey lived during the
time they were being instructed
at the University. This Glouces-
ter Hall, now Worcester College,
consisted of a group of houses,
or cells, each belonging to one
of the great Benedictine monas-
teries in the Midlands, but forming collectively a college. John Stan well, the
last Abbot of Pershore, was prior of Gloucester Hall in 1501/t
J. W. Willis-Bund, Esq,, F.S.A., has investigated this matter in an excellent paper, 11 The fplitical Reasons
for the Worcestershire Monasteries. 1 hirty-fifth report of the Worcester Diocesan Architectural and Archaologicat
Society, p- 20, it. seg. t ißjr.
t To this day some curious customs, supposed to have been in use among the novices of the older institution, are
observed at Worcester College ; for instance the Scouts (College servants) hammer the stairs of each cell to awaken
the slumbering students in the morning.


To the monks of Pershore and to those of other monasteries is probably
due the establishment of parish churches in many places where they held
possession.
Turning to the pages of Domesday Book, we find that among the chief posses-
sions of Pershore were Beolege and Gerlei, representing the modern Beoley

AN ABBOT OF FERSIIORE-
This stone la now built into the south wall of Beoley Church.

and Yardley. The churches of
both places retain traces of their
ancient connection with the
Abbey. At Beoley, upon the
exterior of the south wall, near
the west end, is a stone rudely
carved to represent an abbot,
believed to commemorate a
former prelate of Pershore ; while
the line old parish church of
Vardley is dedicated to the
royal virgin, St. Edburga, whose
relics^found an honourable shrine
within the stately abbey church,
beside the gently-flowing Avon.
Of that stately and beautiful
abbey church, a monument of
mediaeval architecture, rivalled in
the county by Worcester Cathe-
dral and Malvern Priory Church
alone, a large portion remains.
The church resembles the cathe-
dral in being built on the plan
of a double cross. When per-
fect the interior measured nearly
400 ft. in length. 'The nave, like
that of Tewkesbury, was famous
for the massive cylindrical


columns, sixteen in number (at Tewkesbury there are only fourteen), which
supported the arcade. This portion of the building formed the parish church
of Holy Cross. It has long since perished, with the Lady Chapel, the cloisters,
and all the convent buildings. A transept, lantern-tow T er, and choir alone re-
main.
Few finer lantern-towers than that at Bershorc can be found in England. It
resembles, in respect of structure and architectural treatment, the tower of
Salisbury Cathedral : in fact, so striking is the likeness, that Sir Gilbert Scott
believed the same architect designed both towers.
Ihe south transept, which is very early Norman, if not pre-Norman work, is
the oldest part of the fabric now standing. The nave w r as built in the nth
century, the choir in the 13th (1339), and tire tower in the 14th century.
When that destructive whirlwind, the Reformation, swept England clean of
all monasteries, William and Francis Sheldon, representatives of an ancient
Worcestershire family already holding lands at Beoley, received as their share
of plunder the possessions of Pcrshore Abbey. The church being in part
parochial was not altogether destroyed.
Owing to the loss by fire of most of the abbey records few of its legends
have come down to our times.
A strange story, however, is told of Folhert, first abbot of Persbore. After
Tolbert’s death in A.m 988, the Abbot of Wmchcorabe and some monks
who sat watching the corpse were startled at seeing it rise upon the bier.
I he, monks fled, but Abbot Germanus remained and conjured the spirit that
the cause of its return should be made known.
Ihe spirit replied that, St. Benedict had carried it to heaven, where the
sins of its past life had been pardoned by reason of the fervent prayers of St.
Oswald, and that the cause of its return was to acquaint the world that
Oswald was one of the greatest saints.
Germanus questioned the spirit as to the appearance of St. Benedict in
heaven. The spirit replied, that the holy saint looked “most beautiful, and
was most nobly clad of any ; shining with precious stones, and attended by
innumerable multitudes of monks and nuns, all most beautiful.”
After living half a day, the spirit again departed,

noteworthy that the first matter recorded concerning the
citizens of Worcester in the eleventh century is a protest on
SpWA their P art a g a ' nst fhe tyranny of a foreign ruler. The lull
significance of this protest cannot be understood without
recalling some of the chief incidents. of the preceding years.
After the peace concluded at Olney Island on the Severn,
between Edmund Ironside and Cnut (Canute), the Dane did two things to
ensure order and good government in his newly-acquired kingdom; he created
Earls, and raised a small standing army of Hus-carls.
The Earls were to rule as viceroys in the English provinces. Mercia Cnut
gave to Edric, but, when that traitor confessed the murder of King Edmund,
he was slain, and Eeofric, famous in story as the husband of Cady Codiva,
was set up in his place. East Anglia fell to Thorkell, Northumbria to Eric,
Wessex to Codeine,


The Hus-carls were the first soldiers regularly kept and paid in England;
they were picked warriors, Danes, Englishmen, and others.
At the end of the year 1035 King Cnut w T as dead, Harold Harefoot, his
son, ruled in Northumbria and Mercia. Earl Godwine and Queen Emma held
the southern part of England for Harthacnut (Hardecanute), who tarried in
Denmark, Lyfing, Bishop of Worcester, stood beside Godwine as his chief
adviser, and Earl and Bishop were then the recognised leaders of the legitimists
or patriotic party. Earl Leofric of Mercia was Harold's chief supporter, and
had advised the division of the Kingdom,
Alfred and Edward, sons of King Ethelred, had been living in exile for
over twenty years in Normandy, where their mother’s brother, Duke Richard,
had befriended them, Richard died in 1026, and now their cousin Duke Robert,
and their step-father Cnut, had both died in tire same year. This was an
opportunity for the exiled Princes to return to their native land.
Attended by many Norman knights, the Ethelings crossed the channel and
arrived at Winchester where Queen Emma, their mother, was then living.*
Probably Alfred thought to make terms with Harold Harefoot, and to
obtain a share of the kingdom; at all events he obeyed a summons to repair
to London to confer with the king. Edward more prudently stayed at
Winchester with his mother.
Suddenly the great Earl Godwine, who had before favoured the cause of
Harthacnut declared himself a partisan of Harold, and coming with a strong force
seized Prince Alfred while on the way to London. Many of the Prince’s
attendants were taken prisoners and barbarously treated; some were blinded, some
scalped and tortured, some had hands and feet cut off, some were sold into
slavery, altogether six hundred men were tortured to death at Guildford.t

t Horenoe of Worcester, Chronicle, stih. a.i>. 1036. Some modern historians, including Green, say that the
massacre was don? by Harold's men, hut Florence distinctly states that the Earl was the perpetrator cf the
crime.


Upon the news of this horrible massacre reaching Winchester, Queen Emma,
with all haste, sent back her son Edward to Normandy lest he should share
his brother’s fate.
Prince Alfred was hurried away to the eastern counties where the wide
waters of the fens lessened the chances of escape or rescue; fearing that this
precaution might not be enough the Prince's persecutors plucked out his eyes,
and in a mutilated state he was taken to Ely monastery and handed over to
the custody of the monks, who fed him on bread and w r ater. Fortunately,
the poor Prince’s sufferings were of short duration; he soon died, and the
monks, who had before treated their guest with scant courtesy, buried him
honourably in the south porch at the west end of their church.
After this, since Harthacnut appeared indifferent, Harold Harefoot was elected
King of all England; Queen Emma was banished; Earl Godwine and his
friend Lyfing, Bishop of Worcester, became chief ministers of the King.
The patriotism of Godwine has been greatly praised by modern historians,
but if the plain words of the Worcester Chronicle are read with unprejudiced
eyes, the character of the Earl appears despicable indeed: a time server,
traitorous, unscrupulous, cruel, and a nepotist, there cannot be any doubt that,
if he did not actually cause, he could have prevented, the murder of Prince
Alfred.
What of Lyfing, the friend and adviser of Godwine? Was he, too, impli-
cated in this horrible crime ? Perhaps the best answer to this question is the
verdict of “ not proven.”
Lyfing was a monk of Winchester, afterwards, as abbot of lavistuck he
accompanied Cnut to Kome; was the chosen bearer of that famous letter to
the English, in which the king avowed his repentance and expressed the hope
that he might be able to renew Ids life and govern according to the dictates
of mercy and justice. As a reward for services in this and other political
business, Lyfing received the bishopric of Creditor! in Devonshire, and on
the death of his uncle Brithwold, bishop of St. Germans in Cornwall, he
obtained that See also.
After Cnut’s death, Lyfing joined Godwine in supporting the claims of
Harthacnut; subsequently he inclined to Harold, and became the bmg s


personal friend. Thus he obtained the See of Worcester, to hold in plurality
with his western bishoprics.
The murder of Alfred took place in a.d. 103 d. Harold Harefoot died in
1040. Thereupon the English sent messengers to Harlhacnut, then at Bruges
with his mother, Queen Emma, and shortly before midsummer the new king
landed in this country.
Like the stork in the fable of “The Frogs asking for a King,” Harthacnut at
once began to prey upon his subjects. He demanded a great reward for his
Danish seamen, and levied a tax on the whole of England, “a tax so bur-
thensome that scarcely anyone would pay it,”* Then, being, greatly angered
against Earl Godwine and Bishop Lyfing for conniving at the death of the
Libeling Alfred, his half-brother, he brought them to trial. Bishop and Earl
appeared before the Witan, and were formally accused of being implicated in
the Prince's murder, vElfric, Archbishop of York, preferring the charges.
Godwine, acting on the old aphorism that “every man has his price,” bought
the king’s favour with a gift of a magnificent gilded war-ship, fully manned
with eighty chosen warriors, all - well armed, and adorned with golden bracelets,
each bracelet weighing six ounces. Moreover, he swore most solemnly that, not
by his counsel, nor at his instance, were Prince Alfred’s eyes put out: he had
simply obeyed the commands of his lord, King Harold. Most of the chief
men in England said this was so, and Godwine was pardoned,
Lyfing, however, was less fortunate: he was deprived of his bishopric and
Archbishop /Elfric w T as made 'Bishop of Worcester in his stead. This appoint-
ment was not acceptable to the citizens of Worcester. Lyfing was a popular
bishop, and withal, an eloquent preacher. He had gained the hearts of his
people. Many were unwilling that the See should again become an appendage
to the Northumbrian archbishopric. Probably Earl T.eofric, the monks, and
citizens were in accord, for when Archbishop Aslfric came to Worcester, the
people would not receive the man who had betrayed their hero.f
Such was the state of popular feeling when a detachment of the King’s Hus-carls
arrived in Worcester city to enforce payment of the ship-money or Danegeld.

During Harold's reign the central power showed signs of degeneracy and
the cities had grown strong. The men of Durham had repulsed a raid
made by Duncan, King of Scots. The men of Worcester, In like manner, if
report speaks truly, had checked an inroad of Welshmen, at Rhyd-y-groes, now
called “The Rhydd,” near Upton-upon-Severn, where Gruffydd, King of North
Wales, w r as defeated. The cities then had a right to consideration.
This Danegeld fell heavily upon the citizens, the amount of its imposition
had been steadily increasing till it became unbearable.
Vast hoards of coins, minted in England, between the reigns of Edgar and
Edward the Confessor, have, from time to time, been unearthed in Denmark,
Norway and Sweden, proving, incontestably the truth of the accounts of the
great sums of money drawn from England by the Northmen, either as plunder
or tribute, during the latter part of the 10th and first half of the nth
centuries, Worcester was one of the cities which enjoyed the privilege of
minting coins; this mint was in operation for about 230 years, from the reign
of Ethelred 11. a.d, 978, till the time of Henry 11.,* and many coins bearing the
imprint of Worcester mint have actually been found among the northern hoards.

It was in the month of May, 1041, that the Hus-carls came to Worcester
to collect the tribute. On Monday, the fourth day of the month, the
citi/ens arose tumultuously and with force resisted the brutal conduct of the
soldiers, Beople from the country joined the town’s folk, and Che riot became
general. Two of the officers, header and Thurstan, seeing their men out-
numbered, took refuge in the monastery, but the infuriated mob hurst into
the sacred precincts and murdered the Hus-carls in an upper room of the
Minster tower.
When the tumult was over, people began to fear the consequence. They
were, however, allowed ample time to prepare for the coming storm.
Summer and autumn passed ; it was not till November mists began to
lie upon the low lands that news came of the approach of a great army,
led by (Jodwine, Leofric, Si ward, and all the greatest Earls of England.
The wrath of Harthacnut waxed strong, and his commands were, to put to
death all the inhabitants, to plunder and burn the city, and to lay waste the
whole province.
The country people fled before the advancing army. The soldiers found
empty villages and farms, and when they arrived before the gates of Worcester,
the city was deserted. It was, as it were, a city of the dead; neither man,
woman, nor child remained therein.
Where the Sahvarpe joins the Severn there is a wallow-fringed island, the
ancient name of which suggests, if it docs not record, that the beaver was
formerly an inhabitant of Worcestershire streams. There are no beavers in
England now r . Geraldus Cambriensis, who wrote in the 12th century, says
there were none left in his time in any part of Britain, save only in the
River leifi in Cardiganshire but Bevereye (Bever Eyot, now pronounced
Bev-ery), may well have been a home of this extinct amphibia. On this
island, sheltered by the forest of Omberslcy, protected by a morass and the
deep waters of the encircling Severn, the citizens of Worcester had entrenched
themselves in a W'ell-provisioncd camp. The memory of this entrenchment is
still preserved in the name <! Camp,” given to the adjacent lock and weir,*
For some of the foregoing particulars I am indebted to an article entitled "Lyfing the Tatnot,'’ by an anony-
mous writer in a local newspaper.


The Severn was not then, as now, sluggish and artificial, but ran in a broad
and rapid stream, shallow in some places, running over pebbly beds ; in others
forming deep pools, and occasionally spreading out over the adjoining lands
in vast tracts of marsh and bog.
For four days the enemy ravaged the surrounding county, collected such
valuables as the people could not remove, and attacked the island camp.
Four times the army was repulsed by the bravery of the defenders of TJevereye,
and only a few prisoners were taken. On the fifth day (November ifith),
having looted and burnt Worcester city, the soldiers marched away, loaded
with plunder ; but honourable terms had been made for the citizens, who were
allowed freely to return to their desolate homes, and Bishop Fyfing, having
paid a heavy line, was restored to the See of Worcester,
A few months after these events Harthacuut died suddenly while feasting in
a house at Fambeth. Then Godwine and Fyfing led the party which placed
Edward, son of Ethelred, on the throne of his ancestors. Three years later
Bishop Lyfing, called “The Eloquent,” and “The Patriot,” also passed away. In
his high position as bishop of three bishoprics, Lyfing remained steadfast to
his friend, Earl Godwine, through ah the troubles of the days of Harold and
Harthacnut. William of Malmsbury considered him ambitious, arrogant, one
who studied nothing more than to gratify his own wishes. 'Whatever else may
be said of him, it must at least be admitted that he was a true friend.
Ever since the days of Lyfing and the brave defence of Bevcrcye Isle,
Worcester citizens have enjoyed a reputation for loyalty to the English throne.
Then it was they first began to earn for Worcester the proud title of “ The
Faithful City.”

aT Malvern, upon a ledge of rock by' the side of a ravine
leading to St. Anne’s Well, amid a grove of sycamores
and wild cherry-trees the Hermit Werstan built himself a cell.
All that is certainly known about Werstan is that
he was a monk of Deerburst, and that when the
Danes destroyed that monastery he fled through marsh and
forest to the solitude of Malvern Hills, where, upon a natural terrace, high
above the oaks of Malvern Chase, he lived a holy and a solitary life.*
So recently as 1825, portions of this hermitage, incorporated with a cottage,
were standing. Many encaustic tiles and carved stones adorned the little
building; in the orchard rude cists containing human bones were constantly

found; the ancient deeds belonging to the house proved, without a doubt,
that this was the site of the recluse’s cell, for in them the place was called
“The Hermitage."! The cottage and all visible relics of the anchorite’s
dwelling have now disappeared; a villa and a formal Italian garden occupy
the spot, which, on account of the beautiful prospect there to be obtained,
is named after an Italian ducal villa—ll Bello Sguardo.
Although all written records of the events have disappeared, the story of
the martyred hermit may yet be read upon the pictured panes in the
venerable Priory Church.
In the clerestory window on the north side of the choir, nearest the tower,
enough of the beautiful 15th century glass remains to enable anyone who
cares to read the legend of St. Werstan to do so with tolerable accuracy.
It is a simple story of a holy life, celestial visions, and a noble death for
conscience’ sake. The first pane represents a man kneeling in attitude of prayer;

by some oppressive lord of
neighbouring territory, sent a


messenger to intercede with King Edward, and thus obtained lawful possession
of the little plot whereon the celestial vision had led him to build his oratory.
Certain it is that in a charter granted by Henry I. in 1127, among other
possessions of the Priory of Great Malvern, lands given by the Confessor are
mentioned, although no regular Priory existed there before tire conquest.*

The legendary history of the founding of the Priory runs as follows:
Two men, Guido (the William of the window?) —supposed to be a Dane,
and perchance in some way implicated in St. Werstan’s murder, and Aldwyn,
who lived at Malvern a little before the time of the Conquest, determine to
set out on a pilgrimage to the Lord's sepulchre at Jerusalem,
For this purpose, Aldwin seeks permission from his bishop, St. Wulstan,
who dissuades him from going, saying—“ Aldwin do not thou go to Palestine,
for thou shalt see that God will do great things for Malvern.”

There was an early con-
nection between the Abbey
of St. Peter, Westminster,
and Malvern Priory, the
exact nature of that connec-
tion seems to be doubtful,
and was a subject of dis-
pute between the liishop of
Worcester and the Abbot
of Westminster so early as
the 12th century, but the
Pope finally decided in favour of Westminster; wherefore Malvern is usually
regarded as a cell belonging to the great foundation of King Edward the
Confessor.
It is said that a Malvern hermit first suggested to Edward the Confessor,
the founding of Westminster Abbey, and when Urso, the Sheriff of Worcester-
shire, determined to establish a religious house at Malvern, he made it a
dependency of Westminster; this he did before the death of the Confessor,


It was this small monastic cell which was re-organlscd by Aldwyn, with WulstaiVs
sanction, and, perhaps, with the help of the Abbot of Westminster.* William
of Malmsbury slates that the Benedictines were established at Malvern in 1083.

In "Memorials of Westminster Abbey" Dean Stanley relates the story of Ihe Malvern hermit’s vision;—
There was in the neighbourhood of Worcester, 11 far from men in the wilderness, on the slope of a wood, in a
Cave, deep down in the grey rock, s holy hermit of great age, living on fruits and roots." One night, when
after reading tn the scriptures, “ How hard are the pains Of bell, and how the enduring life of heaven is
sweet,” he could neither sleep nor repose, St. Peter appeared to him bright and beautiful like a clerk, and
warned him to tell the King (Edward the Confessor), that he was released from Ins vow of a pilgrimage to
Rome, and that on that very day, his messengers would return from Rome with the Pope's absolution. More-
over, the King should establish a Benedictine Monastery af Thorney, two leagues from London on the site of
an ancient church, which should be “the gate of heaven, the ladder of prayer, where those who served St.
Peter should by him be admitted into Paradise.”
The hermit wrote an account of bis vision, sealed it with waJi, and brought it to the King, who compared
it with the letter just received from Rome, and determined to obey the commands of the apparition.


HANLEY CASTLE CHURCH, I-'ROM THE SOUTH-EAST.
H &uecn ? 6 IReveiigc-
MID the thick and tangled forest covering the plain between
W/M Malvern Hills and the Severn, and extending from Worcester
nearly to the gates of Gloucester, Brihtric, son of Alfgar,
* iatl a hunting lodge near the ford of Hanley.
' W I —j In after times this moated timber-built manor house gave
place to a stone-built Norman keep, Hanley Castle, an important fortress
commanding the passage of the river and the road from Herefordshire, running
across the hills and through Malvern Chase into the vale of Worcestershire : but
at the time when Brihtric lived at Hanley, Edward the Confessor sat upon the
English throne, and the possibility of a Norman baron being lord of Malvern
Chase was not contemplated.
Brihtric, son of Alfgar, who owned lands in all the western counties, from
Cornwall to Worcestershire, ranked high among English thanes. His grand-
father, Haylward, called Meaw or Snow, on account of the fairness of his


complexion and his flaxen hair, flourished in the time of Athclstan. In the
year 980, he and his wife, /Elfgifu, founded a monastery at Cranborne, which
he gave to the Monks of Tewkesbury Abbey, who acknowledged him as patron.
Alfgar lived in the stormy days of Edmund Ironside.*
In 1016, Alfgar fought in the battle of Scearstan, when the English met
the Danes on the borders of Worcestershire. Eor two days Englishmen and
Danes contended for victory. On the first day, at sun-set, the armies, for
very weariness of fighting, withdrew of their own accord. On the second day
King Edmund, fighting most valiantly in the front rank, and at close quarters,
had nearly defeated the Danes, when Edric Streon, the traitor, perceiving that
the English were prevailing, struck off the head of one Osm;cr, whose features
and hair resembled Edmund’s, and, holding it up, shouted, “ Ely,' English!
Ely, English ! This is Edmund ! ” This ruse succeeded, and the Danes were
not beaten that day. The thanes, Almar the beloved and Alfgar son of
Mcaw, who ought to have supported King. Edmund, deserted, taking with them
a vast throng of people, and the suu set a second time upon an undecided
field, t
When Alfgar died his vast possessions passed to Brihtric, his son, who seems
to have inherited the family complexion, as well as the family manors, since,
like his grandfather, he 100 w r as called Meaw—Snow.
There came a day when Edw T ard, king of England, found occasion to send
an ambassador to Baldwin V., Count of Flanders, and his choice fell upon
Brihtric Meaw; nobly born, wealthy, handsome, except the king there was no
richer man in England.

a detached part of Worcestershire, is the place. The name Chimney being a translation Skorsteen,
Ce?7mik Sckorsteen, a chimney), a name derived from a house conspicuous from the fact that it had a chimney,
a luxury rare m Saxon times.
Camden and Stow agree in placing the battlefield la the ncighbnurhood of the Four Shire Stone, and they
are probably correct, a quantify of human bones have been dug up at Dorn, near this spot, believed by a local
historian to be those of men slain in this battle. Florence gives the best description of the battle (sub anno
1016), but seems to have blended two accounts. The account in the Saxon Chronicle is very brief and Edric i
stratagem is not noticed, Henry of Huntingdon gives an account of a similar ruse, but eonmets it with the
battle of Offington, a little latet—(Henry of HujlUngton. Bolin's Anti Library, p, toy).


When the young ambassador arrived in Flanders his noble carriage and
manly beauty attracted great attention; and Matilda, Princess of Flanders, fell
madly in love with him.
This Princess had a noble lineage, her mother, Adela, being daughter of
Robert, king of France, and her father claiming direct descent from Alfred the
Great. Her father’s state was one of the richest. Her personal charms com-
manded admiration, so much so that her hand was sought in marriage by
some of the greatest princes of Europe, but she refused all suitors. Matilda’s
aUections were centred upon Brihtric; the gentle disposition of her father
found no reflex in her character. Passion triumphed over modesty and the
haughty Princess revealed the love which a humbler maiden would have con-
cealed.
Brihtric, preferring to woo rather than be wooed, refused the hand which
the Lady of blunders extended to him. His conduct was no doubt regarded
as extremely foolish, and in the end this rejection cost him both lands and
life; he possessed so fair a heritage, in the most fruitful part of England, that
he was esteemed a worthy consort for the daughter of a Count, but, after
this, Baldwin’s Court was scarcely the place for him to sojourn in, so he re-
turned to England and tried 10 forget Matilda, but Matilda did not forget
Brihtric.
Among Matilda’s suitors was William Duke of Normandy, her cousin, whose
disposition was cast in the same imperious mould as her own.
In accordance with the etiquette ot those days William did not conduct his
courtship personally but sent ambassadors to Baldwin to arrange the marriage.
Matilda, still headstrong and wilful, told the deputies, in plain language—more
forcible than polite—she would not marry the Duke, and taunted him with
the disgrace of his birth. Baldwin the .Gentle softened the reply, but the
actual words were probably reported to William.
Ibe courtship lasted for seven years. Then, if the legend may be trusted,
William lost patience, and in a fit of exasperation mounted his horse and rode
to Bruges, where he met Matilda returning from service at the Cathedral. The
Duke seized his cousin by the hair and with his -whip beat her furiously, then
robed her in the gutter till her fine clothes were covered with mud and


drenched with water. After this rough wooing Duke William rode away,
Matilda was, however, won. She said she was convinced of the strength of
the Duke's attachment and was willing to become his wife, A loving wife
and a good mother she proved. “A singular mirror of prudence and the per-
fection of virtue ” is William of Malmsbury’s estimate of the character of the
Queen of William the Conqueror,*
All this, however, is a legend. The story of the long courtship of William
and Matilda is told by freeman, Matilda was probably a widow at the time
of her marriage with the Duke.
Now comes the dark sequel of the story, borne out by facts extracted from
among the dry entries of the Domesday Survey. The page of history becomes
tinged with the colour of romance. Revenge, cruel, pitiless and calculating,
clouds the otherwise bright name of Queen Matilda, making us hope that the
circumstantial narrative is exaggerated and partly an emanation of the chronicler’s
vivid imagination.
For fourteen years Matilda had enjoyed the greatest happiness as a wife and
mother, yet, if the old monk’s words be true, she had treasured the bitter
memory of the slight which had been put upon her by the fair-haired English
thane.
After the fight at Hastings Duke William became King William, and Brihtric
was then a subject of Matilda's husband. Being wealthy, an Englishman, and
in all probability opposed to Norman innovations, the Lord of Hanley was a
marked man. At the Queen’s request, it is said, in the first year of the
Conqueror's reign, and by means of agents, for she had not then set foot in
England, Erihtric was seized at Hanley, in Worcestershire, on a day when he
was celebrating the completion of a chapel which he had caused to be built
for the benefit of his tenants and retainers. St. Wulstan himself was at Hanley
that day, and had hallowed the chapel; he doubtless had sat at Brihtric’s
festal board. Then came the order for arrest, and mail-clad Norman soldiers
hurried the Lord of Hanley from the forest glades of Worcestershire to a
noisome prison at Winchester where he died. His lands were then given to
Matilda,
* JSorne writers sny the assault took placo at Eille, in the Palace there, and not in the streets of Bruges.


This is the story of a Queen’s revenge. It has this much corroboration
from history that the lands of Brihtric had a special tendency to fall into the
hands of Queen Matilda.*
From Domesday Book may be gleaned a few undoubted facts relating to
Brihtric Meaw. In that record his name stands out among the great Saxon
landowners as one marked for spoliation.
In the Worcestershire survey, Brihtric’s name appears as tenant of the
Church of Worcester at Biselege (Bisley co.. Gloucester) and Burgelege, and in
both entries the concluding words are: —“ Now it is in the King’s hands.”
In Gloucestershire, among other possessions, he held the Manors of Fairford,
Avening, Thombury, and Whitenhurst, lands at Tewkesbury and Bislcy, At
the latter place he leased some land from Bishop T.yfing. In Worcestershire
he held Hanley, but the entry appears in the Herefordshire Survey (180 Q,
and his name as tenant in capitt does not appear in that of Worcestershire.
These brief passages in Domesday Book contain the following significant words: —
“ The above mentioned lands were held by Bnhtric and afterwards by Queen
Matilda.” Brihtric also owned salt works. Incidentally, and not without a grim
sense of humour, it is recorded that the Norman Sheriff of Worcestershire and
Gloucestershire, Urso de Abetot, had dealt so hardly with the men of these
works that instead of producing 25 sextarii of salt a year, as they did formerly,
they could then produce none at all (163 Q.
Sir Henry Ellis, in his “Introduction to Domesday Book,” gives a Jong list of
Brihtric’s lands in various counties; also the possessions of his numerous namesakes.
In a Waltham charter, printed in Kemble’s “Codex Diplomaticus” (N. 159),
Brihtric’s name appears among the witnesses with the title of “ Princeps,” indi-
cating his high rank.
The unknown author of the continuation of Wace’s Chronicle, writing in the
reign of Henry 111, (1216-1272), and probably copying an older author, gives
the earliest extant version of the Romance of Brihtric and Matilda.
“ Maude, Except the king was there no richer, man ;
Who when a maiden. To him the maiden sent a messenger,
Loved an English lord, Ifi.s love for her to obtain,
Brihtric Maw was his name, But Brihtric refused Maude. ”f
*A. E. Freeman, The Norman Conquest. Vol. iv. 162, 762, etc,
t Wactj MS. Cotton VitMlius, A.X., fol 129. British Museum,


The poem then relates how Matilda married Duke William, and in time
became Queen of England; how she revenged herself by having Brihtric
arrested “at his Manor of Hanley,” on the day when St. Wulstan hallowed
the chapel, and how Brihtric died in prison “by treason;” that when he was
dead the king seized his inheritance and gave a part of it to Robert Fit/,
Ha mom
The poem clearly states the manner in which the lands passed from the
thane to the king; Brihtric dying without issue the estates escheated, t.e.,
were forfeited to the king, who granted most of them to the Queen. So far
the poem and the survey agree, but in the latter there is no reference to
Robert Fitz Hamon in connection with Brihtric’s lands. The poem is un-
doubtedly inaccurate In this detail, but it is a fact that in the reign of
William Rufus, a little later, Robert Fitz Hamon received Tewkesbury and
great tracts of land lying partly in Gloucestershire and partly in Worcestershire,
which lands formerly formed part of the inheritance of Brihtric,*

history, Worcester sent forth the man who linked the old
order with the new, As Here ward the Wake was the last
representative of Saxon Chivalry, so was Wulstan the Saint
the last of a long and illustrious line of Saxon ecclesiastics.
Equally the friend of Kings of two widely different dynasties, Wulstan’s
figure stands conspicuous among the great men of his time. He was at once
a religious enthusiast and a man of action; being entirely honest his word
might be absolutely relied upon, but he had the faculty of recognising the
inevitable, could accommodate himself to circumstances, and in fact was, in
this respect, an archetype of the Vicar of Bray.

In the year 991 St. Oswald granted to bis faithful man /Elfstan one manse
at Iccntune (Long Itchington, in Warwickshire).* dElfstan took to himself a
wife, Wulfrigu, and so became the father of Wulstan, who was born in 1008.
After some years of married life, JElfstan and Wulfrigu separated, being minded
to dedicate their last years to God, he became a monk at Worcester, and she
entered a nunnery at the same place. Their son, Wulstan, was put to school
at Evesham Abbey, and then sent to Peterborough, where one Erwen, a
learned man and a skilful writer and illuminator of books, became his
tutor.
It is said that the lad was “ mightily taken with a Sacramentary and a
Psalter fairly written and having the first letters of the sentences curiously
depicted” by his master; he sadly grieved 'when for lucre-sake Erwen parted
with these examples of his skill, giving the Sacramentary to Cnut and the
Psalter to Queen Emma. Isy a curious chain of circumstances both books
ultimately became Wulstan’s; Cnut gave them to the Emperor Conrad, whose
son, Henry 111., presented them to Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester, when that
prelate was ambassador at the Imperial Court at Koln, Ealdred, upon his
return, bestowed the precious manuscripts upon Wulstan, who thus, after a lapse
of 30 years, had his wishes gratified.
No life is entirely free from romance, and even saintly Wulstan has a love
story; he was one day smitten by the charms of a dancing girl, but his
monastic training had taught him that it was sinful to gaze upon a woman
with the eyes of a lover, so he checked his passion. Retiring into the
seclusion of a wood he lay prostrate on the earth and bewailed his fault with
great contrition. The youth who thus withstood the temptation of “ the beautiful
fiend,” excelled in athletic exercises. To this early training, probably, was due
that physical strength which enabled him in after life to manage the affairs of
his large diocese and to cope with the difficulties surrounding a Saxon prelate
in the nth century.
Wulstan remained a layman from diffidence as to his own fitness for the
ministry till he was 26 years of age, but then yielding to his mother’s prayers

and the advice of Bishop Brihteag he took monastic vows at Worcester, and
was ordained both deacon and priest speedily.
He now began that rigorous course of life by which he gained a great
reputation for sanctity. He fasted for three days at a time, kept long vigils,
and mortified the flesh in various ways.
A story is told about him at this period, to the effect that he had a special
liking for roast goose, a luxury rare among the Saxons, who usually boiled their
meat. One day when he was engaged at his devotions in the church the
savour of roast goose penetrated from the kitchen and tickled the olfactory
nerves of the enthusiast and disturbed his meditations; thereupon he vowed to
abstain from flesh thenceforth, and to live on herbs, or at most a little fish.
From being “child master” in the Monastery, a position which shows that
King Alfred's injunctions regarding the education of the young had been observed
at Worcester, Wulstan quickly rose to be Chanter, Treasurer, and Prior. This
was the highest office in the Cathedral-Monastery, for the Bishop acted as
Abbot, so the Prior was immediate head of the society.
Troublous were the days when Wulstan was. a Monk at Worcester.
When the mob broke into the Monastery and slaughtered the Danish huscarls,
Wulstan was present, he witnessed the brave defence of Bevereye Island and
the sacking of the city and Monastery, he was still a monk when Bishop
Lyfmg died (1044-5) an( i Ealdred was appointed to the episcopal chair.
In those days the Welsh, under their King GrufTydd of South Wales (not to
be confused with his namesake of North Wales) made frequent inroads into
Herefordshire and the western parts of Worcestershire.
Taking advantage of the absence of Earl Swegen, in 1049, the Welsh crossed
the Wye and invaded the territory of Bishop Ealdred, who, calling together
the men of Worcestershire, went out to meet the Welsh; but there were
traitors in the camp who carried secret information to the invaders. In the
early morning Gruffydd and his Welshmen surprised the Bishop’s people, slew

Next year Ealdred crossed to Flanders and brought back Earl Swegen, partly
perhaps with a view of keeping the troublesome Welshmen in check, for with
all his faults Earl Swegen had a watchful eye upon the restless Gruffydd*

Holy Father at first refused to confer this vestment upon Ealdred, although
he granted the favour for Westminster, accusing the English Bishop of simony
and of holding too many benefices.
So the Bishop of Worcester and his company left Rome. Scarcely had they
reached the open country when a band of robbers fell upon them, seized all
their baggage and left the Ambassadors to return to the City as best they
could. At this the rage of Earl Tostig waxed hot, he vehemently denounced
the misgovernment of the Papal dominions, and was loud in his threats of
reprisals. Finally it w r as agreed that Worcester should be given up. Ealdred
returned to England wearing the coveted lambs’ w'ool and sapphire pallium.

Ealdred received the Legates and brought them down to Worcester to spend
Lent and to await the King's reply at the Easter meeting of the great
assembly. The Cardinals were lodged in the Monastery, and Prior Wulstan
proved himself an excellent host.
Now at that time the election of a bishop to succeed Ealdred was proceeding.
The monks and people generally were in favour of Wulstan. Archbishop
Ealdred hesitated between the Prior and aEthelwig Abbot of Evesham, who
had acted as bishop’s deputy. The Legates’ voices turned the scale in Wulstan’s
favour, Hvlfgar of Mercia and Earl Harold lent their support and the approval
of the assembly was unanimous. Messengers were at once ordered to ride at
full speed to Worcester to bring the Prior before the Witan. Wulstan came,
and amid shouts of dissent pleaded his unfitness for the office. Shrinking
from the temporal and spiritual responsibility, he declared with an oath he
would rather lose his head than become a bishop.
After this scene in the assembly, a holy hermit, by name Wulfsige, who
had lived in solitude for more than 40 years, came and sharply reproved the
Prior for his stubbornness; Wulstan being warned also in a dream, at length
yielded and was consecrated at York by Ealdred on September Bth, 1062,
but he promised canonical obedience to Stigand, nominal Archbishop of Canter-
bury, this vow he renewed to Eangfranc, Stigahd’s successor.*
No sooner was Wulstan consecrated than he assumed the style and dignity
of a great prelate. Then, or a little later, he retained ■ a body-guard of knights,
a precaution necessary because the Welshmen W ere invading Herefordshire,
Earl Harold, with an army, pursued Ciruffydd to Ehuddlan and again put the
Welsh marches in a state of. defence.
We next hear of Wulstan attending the consecration of Westminster Abbey.
Directly afterwards, when Edward the Confessor was dying and Harold ruled
in England, the simple-minded Bishop was chosen to be the Earl's companion
on a diplomatic journey to the north.
* Freeman .says that the Legates were the bearers of a Decree of Suspension against Stigand, Archbishop
of Canterbury. The Authors of Worcester Diocesan History Say that owing to Norman influence at Rome the
Pope witheld the pallium from Stigand under the pretext of his being a pluralist (p. 45), The same charge,
however, was brought against Ealdred, who was compelled to resign the See of Worcester, so it is evident
that the Pope was averse to piuralista at that time.


Harold and Wulstan conducted their mission successfully, the province was won
without bloodshed, and Morcar, brother of Edwin EarL of Mercia, received the

Earldom of Northumbria, an appointment
which gained for Harold the support of
the house of Leofric.
Then came the short reign of Harold,
the great fight at Hastings, and the
ever-memorable victory won by William
of Normandy and his warriors,
Harold being dead, the bishops, with
Edwin and Morcar, Earls of Mercia
and Northumberland, came to London
and elected Edgar the Etheling king.
Probably Wulstan look part in this
election, for when William crossed the
Thames at Wallingford and threatened
the two great earldoms, Edwin and
Morcar retreated to their province.?. Lon-
don gave way, and the Etheling with
Bishop Wulstan and the other English
leaders came to Berkhampstead, where
they offered submission to the Norman
duke. Wulstan was present at that
stormy scene, amidst which William
the Conqueror was crowned king of
England,
Although submissive, the Bishop saw
the necessity of combination, and we
find among the documents of the time
immediately succeeding the Conquest,
one which proves that he was the leader of a movement for the preservation
of the Benedictine monasteries in his province.* From this document it appears
w J3r, Thomas. “A Survey, See,” j>, too. Appends, p- 3- Hickesii Di&sert. Eps-.t, p. 10, 20,


that Wulstan and the abbots of seven great Benedictine houses viz : —Evesham,
Chertsey, Bath, Per she re, Winchcomb, Gloucester, and Worcester, promised to
be true to King ’William and the lady Matilda £ for God and for the world,’
and they bound themselves to be as if‘the seven minsters were one minster,
to be true to one another as if they were one monastery, one heart, and one
soul; that they would sing masses weekly for all the brethren, and perform
other acts of charity.
Owing probably to this submission William was at first a friend to Worcester
monastery; in the first year of his reign he gave the Bishop the village of
Cnllaclyfe, a member of Wolvcrlcy, as a thank offerings and that prayers might be
said for the health of his soul, and the souls of all those who had helped him
in getting possession of his kingdom. But this policy of conciliation was quickly
changed to one of stern repression when the King found himself more firmly
established and obliged to satisfy the claims of his Norman followers.
Under the pretext that people had used the monasteries as repositories for plate
and money, William gave orders For religious houses to be searched and their
treasures confiscated. 1 his visitation fell heavily upon Worcester, where the shrines,
books, and other ornaments of the Church were stripped of their golden adornments,
In the same year, 1069, Crso de Abetot, the Norman Sheriff, while carrying out
the Kings orders to build strong castles in suitable places, encroached upon the
monks’ burying-ground, widening the castle ditch at the expense of the Church’s land.
Wulstan being powerless to interfere sent for Archbishop Ealdred, who examined
the ground and rebuked the rapacious Norman to his face,
“Highest thou Urse
Have thoj Hod's curse,”
were the words the venerable Archbishop hurled at the Sheriff. The Chroniclers
say the curse ’ took effect and the Sheriffs son died young, so that the lands
unjustly acquired passed from bis family.
Urso was the chief of a band of Norman spoilers, who fell upon the Lands
of the Church m Worcestershire. Unfortunately, too, the Churchmen quarrelled
among themselves. Ealdred had retained twelve Worcester Manors during his life,
and now they were claimed by the new Archbishop of York, Wulstan appealer]
and made goad his claim.


Ihe Abbot of Evesham, a wise man skilled in the law and in favour with
the King, commenced vexatious litigations with Wulstan about some lands over
which the See of Worcester claimed rights. The dispute was settled by the
Domesday Commissioners ; the sentence iti Wulstan’s favour being ratified by the
County Council of those days, and recorded in the pages of Domesday Hook
(xo86) among the other privileges of the Hundred of Oswaldslaw.
It is curious to compare the Chronicles of Evesham and Worcester respect-
ing the conduct of Abbot vEthelwig towards the Bishop; in the Worcester
history he appears as a spoiler and an enemy, in the Evesham Chronicles he
is Wulstarfs faithful friend, lending him two marks of gold and giving him
another when he needed money to carry on the law suit with Thomas, Arch-
bishop of York. He also exchanged some lands and gave others for the benefit
of the See.*
In the midst of all these troubles a personal attack was made upon Wulstan
by his Norman opponents; he was accused of being unlearned and therefore
unfit for his office. His friends feared for his safety, but he was confident,
spending his time in prayer, till called upon to vindicate himself before
Lanfranc at Westminster; then he arose from his knees and, through an
interpreter, for he knew not the Norman tongue, boldly declared his loyalty to
his Church and Sovereign. One account adds that Wulstan placed his staff
upon the tomb of the Confessor, saying he would resign it to none other than
the king who gave it. The staff remained firmly fixed to the stone and could
not be moved till Wulstan again took it up.t He was acquitted and from
that time became the friend of Lanfranc.
So great was the degeneracy of both English and Norman clergy at that time,
that pious Wulstan “ shone as a bright star amongst them.” His simple manners,
however, did not accord with the tastes of those haughty Norman prelates with
whom he associated, and his plain dress of lambs-wool was conspicuous among their
rich furs and splendid embroidery. Geoffry, Bishop, of Coutances, once took
him to task on this matter. The courtly Norman remarked that Wulstan really
ought to wear something more respectable; some costly fur of martin, or of
* Fretmari. Vol. v. f

sable. The Englishman replied, with rare irony, that the skins of such shifty
animals might do for experienced men of the world, but as for himself, plain
lamb skins would suffice. “believe me, my lord,” said he, “I have often
heard ‘Agnus Dei : sung, but never ‘ Cattus Dei..'” This incident happened
when Bishop Geoffry was Wulstan’s guest at Wick, in Worcestershire.*
The political importance of the great Monasteries became manifest in 1074,
when Bishop Wulstan, and Abbot zEthelwig of Evesham, summoned the tenants
of the Church to assist the Sheriff Urso de Abetoc and Walter de Lacy in
quelling the revolt upon the Welsh border. This revolt was in reality the
beginning of tire struggle between the Crown and the Baronage. William had
destroyed the great Saxon Earldoms which had overshadowed the throne, and
this attempt at their restoration showed the wisdom of his policy.t
Contrary to the King’s commands, Roger, Earl of Hereford, son of William
Eitz-Osbern, gave his sister in marriage to Ralf de Guader, who had been
rewarded for his services at Hastings with the Earldom of Norfolk. This
marriage was celebrated with much pomp at Earl RalPs castle in Cambridge-
shire, and the occasion was made an excuse for a gathering of discontented
barons. Earl Roger was collecting his forces in Herefordshire, so that a move-
ment might be made simultaneously from the cast and w r est. But one of the
conspirators turned traitor and advised Lanfranc of the whole plot. Two
Norman bishops with a large army of Normans and Englishmen at once
marched against Earl Ralf, and routed his forces near Cambridge.
Wulstan, zEthdwig, and the Sheriff, with their vassals and a general muster
of Worcestershire men, set out to prevent the Earl of Hereford from crossing
the Severn and so caused the collapse of the rising. This action of WulsUm’s
shows that he was regarded as the temporal lord of Iris great diocese. William
never appointed an Earl of Worcester and the Bishop discharged many of the
duties of an Earl.
In 1084, Wulstan commenced one of his greatest works, the rebuilding of
Worcester Cathedral. He had re constructed the Abbey Church of St. Peter at
Gloucester, and virtually founded the Priory of Great Malvern, but the building

of a cathedral, according to the massive architectural style of the Normans, was
a matter requiring much patient labour and an expenditure of large sums
of money. In live years the church was roofed, it was built to the South-
West of St. Oswald’s Church, and parts of it: remain to this day, a memorial
of the ceaseless energy of Wulstan, and of the solidity and grandeur of
the edifice he planned. In the crypt, or vaulted under-croft, with its
slender, well-proportioned columns, Wulstan held a Synod in 1092, to decide
the claims of the two churches of St. Helen and St. Alban to priority in

the city, when it was proved that the Cathedral was the mother church of
Worcester.* In that same crypt, five hundred and fifty years later, the soldiers
of the Long Parliament stored straw for the horses stabled in the church above.
* The Cathedral is the Mother Church of the Diocese, St. Helen's is the Mother Church of the City of
Worcester. The Synod decided that St. Helen's had been the Mother Church of tlie City Com the days of
King Ethelred. (See ''Dugdale’s Monaslicon Anglicanum,” Vo I. r, p. 60g.)


We, who are now living, are able to ga/e upon a building fully eight centuries
old and still in much the same state as when the Saxon monks fixed the key
stones of those strong arches. In point of date it ranks next only to
Winchester, and is one of the four apsidal crypts in England.
When St. Oswald’s church was pulled down, upon the completion of the
new Minster, Wulstan shed tears, because, as he said, though they were then
able to build more glorious churches people were far behind their fathers in
holiness and humility.
There is another relic—a personal one —remaining of Bishop Wulstan, viz.,
a parchment deed, with seal attached. This deed he offered on the altar of

hides (about 1800 acres) of land at Alfeston

it is stated that being desirous of increasing the
honour and dignity of the monastery erected by
his predecessor St. Oswald, he had not only built
and ornamented the church of Worcester, but
had increased the number of monks from 12
to 50.*

promontory overlooking the Severn, William the Conqueror had died and
his son, William Rufus, had ascended the throne. The barons seized
this opportunity of again rising in arms under pretext of supporting the
claims of the King’s brother, Robert, and early in Lent, roBB, withdrew to
their castles to make ready for a general rising after Easter. Odo, the King’s
uncle, fortified Rochester ■ Geoffrey, Eishop of Coutances, held Bristol; Robert
de Mowbray stormed Bath; Ral])h de Mortemer, Bernard du Neuf-Marche,
Roger de Lacy, Osbern (son of Richard Scroop), and Roger (Earl of Shrews-
bury), uniting their forces in the west, marched through Herefordshire into
Worcestershire, declaring that they would burn the city of Worcester and the
monastery, and so take vengeance on the inhabitants for their loyalty to King
William. “On hearing this,” says Florence, “the Reverend Father Wulstan,
Bishop of Worcester—a man of deep piety and dove-tike simplicity, beloved
alike by God and the people he entirely governed, faithful to the King as his
earthly lord under all circumstances —was in great tribulation; but soon rallying,
by God’s mercy, prepared himself, like another Moses, to stand manfully by
his people and city,” *
The tenants and retainers of the Church were called together from all the
manors in the Hundred of Oswaldslaw, the citizens armed, and the Bishop’s
body guard prepared for active service.
One of the biographers has given a picture of the manner in which the old
Eishop comported himself under these trying circumstances.t
He went among his tenants and exhorted them; he would not dine in
private, but sat down in his public hall with his boisterous soldiers and re-
tainers, to restrain them by his presence from any unseemly conduct. When
the wine flagon came to him in turn he pledged them in a little cup of
wine, pretending to drink, and in the midst of the din repeated to himself
passages from the Psalms, and offered prayers for deliverance from danger.
Meanwhile the Normans, taking counsel, entreated the bishop to remove from
the Monastery to the Castle, saying that his presence would inspire confidence
—for they loved him much—and he consented.
* Florence of Worcester, sub. anno, ic33.
t William of Ma-lmsbury. De Gest. Pont, Vit. St. Wulstan, p. =59.


Then he commanded his retainers* the garrison, and the citizens who were
all assembled, to go out and meet the enemy on the other side of the
Severn. On his way from the Monastery to the Castle he met the troops
arrayed for battle.
“ Go,” said he, “my sons, go in peace, go in confidence, with the blessing
of God and mine. Trusting in God, I promise you that no sword shall hurt
you this day, no disaster, no enemy. Be firm in your loyalty to the king,
and do valiantly for the safety of the people and the city.”
Inspired by these words the loyal men of Worcester crossed the bridge,
which had been repaired, and advanced in the direction of Powick, where they
saw the enemy rapidly approaching. Already the Bishop’s grange and barns,
which lay in the way, had been set on fire. Upon hearing this Wulstan was
sorrowful that the property of the Church should be wasted; he held a council,
and by the unanimous voice of ail present he was asked to pronounce a curse
upon the enemy.
Florence, who may have been an eye witness, states that a miracle ensued.
“The enemy, who were dispersed in parties through the fields, were instantly struct with
such feebleness in their limbs, and loss of eyesight, that they were scarcely able to carry their
arms, or recognise their comrades, or discern those who were advancing to attack them.
* * * * * *
They had lost their wits, so that they neither had the sense to effect a retreat, nor to seek
any means of defence ; but being by Cod's judgment given up to the fate of the reprobate,
they easily fell into the hands of their enemies. The foot soldiers were put to the sword,
the knights and their mounted followers, English, Norman, and Welsh, were taken prisoners,
the rest in their feeble slate barely managed to escape.
The King's liege-men and the Bishop's retainers returned home in triumph, without the loss
of a single man, thanking God for their preservation, and the Bishop for his salutary counsels,”
Towards the close of his active life, Wulstan restored the wasted monastery
of Westbury in Gloucestershire, bestowing upon it those ancient possessions
which had been alienated and which he had recovered either by process of
law or by purchase with his own money.
He also founded a noble institution in the suburbs of the City of Worcester,
without St. Peters (or Sidbury Gate), the Hospital of St. Wulstan, —now called
The Commandery, from its masters assuming the title of Preceptors, or Com-
manders, perhaps in emulation of the Military Priors of the Knights of St.
John of Jerusalem; although this hospital never belonged to the Knights


of St. John. A Master, two Chaplains, and. five poor Brethren professing the
Order of St, Augustine, at first composed the little society*

CALLED THE COMMaNDEEY. WORCESTER.
In 1294, among other
alms-deeds, the Society
maintained 22 poor sick
folk in the infirmary.
During five centuries the
Brethren of St, Wulstan’s
Hospital continued their
good work, sometimes
receiving legacies for the
benefit of their institu-
tion, sometimes engaging
in tiresome law-suits. In

used it as a town house.
Although the buildings of St. Wulstan’s original foundation have long since
perished, portions of the present structure are of some antiquity.

though much injured, retains beautiful carving, and spandrils filled with tracery;
at the west end of the hall is a screen and gallery, at the east end a dais and

various attitudes and mystic flowers), a scroll with the word " (Eunaiiutt,” the
motto of the house.
It is said that the celebrated staff, with which the holy founder vindicated
his right before the Conqueror, was long treasured in this house, being used
by the Brethren in the collection of alms for the Hospital/
During Wulstan’s long episcopate, he had founded many churches and
persuaded others to follow his example. He had stamped out the terrible
slave trade at Bristol, and had regularly visited the w r holc of his great dioccsc.
No man ever begged of Wulstan in vain, and he constantly practised the
virtue of hospitality.
When Wulstan reached the 87th year of his age, and the 33rd of his episco
pate, he died and was buried in that noble cathedral which he had built from the
foundations. In course of time men recognised him as a saint, and his tomb in
the Cathedral choir became an object of veneration. It is no fanciful or supernatural
power which entitles him to be ranked among the saints. He trod humbly in
the footsteps of his Divine Master, and achieved, so far as it is possible for
imperfect humanity to achieve, the standard of divine excellence.

Cbe Chronicle of Chronicles.
■ HEN Norman Barons were leading armed retainers to battle,
and war or hunting were the chief amusement of the wealthy,
a studious monk, Florence of Worcester, in the retirement
of the cloister, recorded upon the fair vellum pages of a
hook events then happening in the busy world outside. Nay,
more than this, the monk began his narrative at the com-
mencement of the English invasion, chronicling incidents long past as well as-
those of days in which he lived,
English traditions remained undisturbed within the monastery by Severn’s
stream, and it was natural that St. Wulstan—last representative of the national
hierarchy,—when he found that the English tongue was being forgotten, should
have suggested to the literary monk, Florence, the necessity of translating the
records of the English folk into Latin, the universal language of the learned;
thus saving from oblivion the early history of the nation.*
Florence, the monk of Worcester, undertook his task in a spirit of true
patriotism. “His example,” says the Bishop of Peterborough, “was followed by
others of greater literary power and wider judgment; but Worcester may claim,
to be the source of that great line of Latin Chroniclers to whom we owe
our knowledge of England of the Middle Ages.”f
The whole of the personal history of this early Worcester Chronicler, now
known to us, is contained in a short account of his death written by his

pupil, John, a monk of Worcester, who continued the chronicles after the
master had laid down his pen.
“ A.U, it 18, Dom, Florence of Worcester, a monk of that monastery, died
on the nones (7th) of July. His acute observation, and laborious and diligent
studies, have rendered this Chronicle of Chronicles pre-eminent above all others.’
“His spirit to the shies, to earth his body given,
For ever may he reign with God’s blest saints in heaven.”
The fact that Florence had access to a version of the Anglo Saxon Chronicle,
now lost, invests his work with peculiar importance ; the Worcester Chronicle,
indeed, is accepted as one of the chief authorities for Early English History.*
Historians have taken considerable trouble to ascertain the sources of
Florence’s compilation :—From A.D. 455 to 597, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
is followed. From A.D. 597 to 732, Beds’s “History”; then the Chronicle
.and the “ Lives of the Saints” ; later Asser’s “ life of Alfred,” and some short
extracts from Abbo.
From A.D. 940 to 971 the “Fives of Dunstan, Oswald, and zEthelred are
relied upon, and then again the Chronicle, which is amplified from .other
sources. In this period some events relating to Worcester arc recorded, making
the work of great local interest. For foreign events Florence used the Chronicle
of Marianus Scotus, a learned Irishman, who lived in the latter half of the
nth century, and died at Mentz about the year 10S3; but Florence continued
the work of Marianus, supplementing it with many valuable facts, the result of
his own keen observation of contemporary events down to A.D. 1117.
To his Chronicles the industrious Florence added a list of Popes, of the
70 Disciples, of the Jewish High Priests, of the English Archbishops and
Bishops, and the genealogies of the English Kings. His work was continued
by several scribes; the first continuation of the Monk John possesses great
local interest, because the historian was an eye-witness of some of the chief
events of the civil wars of Stephen’s reign, which he chronicled with minute
detail. No more vivid word-painting is to be found in the book than the
description of the fearful scenes witnessed by John during an assault on Worcester
by the partisans of the Empress Matilda; the panic-stricken citizens sought

refuge in the Cathedral, heaping treasure chests and household chattels in the
nave, while the monks continued chanting in the choir, and the infuriated
soldiers rushed through the streets setting fire to the houses, and slaying or
taking prisoner the hapless stragglers remaining in the city or suburbs.
Among such scenes of war and misery was the Chronicle of Chronicles
written; it deserves to be more widely read than it is at present, but it
awaits an Editor who shall translate and illustrate it, so that it may once
again become a book delightful, not to a few scholars alone, but, to all in-
terested in the history of their native land and the patriotism of their fore-
fathers.*

g— O visit Ribbesford on a glorious day in early summer, when
the brilliant-hued meadow grass, and the tender shades upon
tlie foliage of the forest trees are ripening to a deeper
-kPIm & rcen t when the air is laden with delicate scent of lime
blossoms, and the perfume of many flowers greets you as you
enter the churchyard garden, to visit Ribbesford on such a.
day is a rare delight—a joy to be long remembered.
The little church, grown grey by Severn’s side, is rich in memories of the
past. It stands within the ancient Marches of Wales, and to this day the
rectory forms part of the diocese of Hereford, although the parish of Ribbes-
ford, including the town of Rewdley, was made part of Worcestershire, so long
ago as the time of Henry VIII.
The great house of Mortimer, Lord of the Marches, held the Manor of
Bewdley in the 14th century, and a stone coffin, with the arms of Mortimer


carved upon it, proves that at least one of this powerful race found a last
resting-place in Ribbesford Church.
When, in 1499, Prince Arthur, then President of the Marches, visited
Tickenhill, and celebrated his marriage with Catherine of Arragon in the palace
chapel, he must have passed this quiet spot as he rode to hunt in the sur-
rounding woods. Queen Elizabeth also lodged in the neighbouring palace, and
in the stirring times of the Civil War, King Charles I. twice halted at this place.
At the old moated mansion, adjoining the churchyard to the south, lived in
the 17th century, Sir Henry Herbert, Knight, brother to the philosopher, T-ord
Herbert of Cherbury. Though the moat of Ribbesford House is dry, its
gates, draw-bridges, and towers destroyed, and only a disfigured fragment of the
once lordly manor house stands, the memory of the Herberts is perpetuated
in the noble avenue of limes, and the cherry orchard, planted by the old
knight after a quaint conceit to represent an army drawn up in order of battle.
The truth of saintly George Herbert’s lines is here exemplified:
. . the memory of the just
• Smells sweet, and blossoms in the dust.
Within Ribbesford’s wood-encircled churchyard may be found memorial stones
to many generations of “stout Severn watermen,” bringers of merchandise from
Gloucester, or from Bristol along the great midland water-way, before the steam
engine commenced to annihilate time and distance.
Beneath the old church porch, half-hidden by sweet-scented honeysuckle, is a carved
tympanum of Norman date, more curious and interesting than any similar stone
within the county; upon it are represented an archer, a salmon, and a hind,
carved in low relief.
An old tradition associates this stone with the following legend :—Robin of
Horsehill, a hunter, skilful in woodcraft, and a good bowman, was one day in
the meadows below Ribbesford Church, when he saw a hind coming down to
the river to drink. The hind was upon the opposite side of the stream, near
the Hermitage of Blackstone.
Robin bent his bow, the feathered shaft flew across the Severn, just at that
moment a salmon leaped up from the water, and the arrow passed through the
fish, killing the hind also.


There is nothing very improbable in the legend, it may be a relic of the
days when the deer roamed in Wyre Forest, and hunting and fishing were the
chief occupations of the country folk.
The carving most likely commemorated some hunting exploit of a long
forgotten local Nimrod ; who Robin Horsehilt was nobody seems to know. In
the Worcestershire forest districts, traditions of other mythical and mighty
hunters are still handed down, Callow T , Sir Rylas, Robin Hood, and his
Satanic Majesty, who is said to have kennelled his hounds at Halesowen, and
to have hunted on the wild hills of Clent. Carving and legend were known
to few r beyond the borders of Worcestershire till chance brought a great art
critic to the spot.
One Sunday morning, in the summer of 1877, John Ruskin stood beside the
north porch of Ribbesford Church, listening to the singing of the hymn, as the
sound came through the open door (the door with the sculptured tympanum),
Ruskin wondered at the strangeness of device,* admired the architecture of the
litttlc church, and called the attention of the friend who had brought him
to this lovely spot to the extremely interesting freehand work of the tracery, and
he pleaded for its preservation. Since that day the church, the window, and
the Archer Knight of Ribbesford have become famous. \
A local worthy, George Griffiths, whose name deserves to be held in honour
for his noble efforts to restore to their original purposes the funds of our old
endowed schools, wrote a ballad upon the legend of the Archer Knight. In
this romantic fiction it appears that the Norman Lord of Tickenhill had a
beautiful daughter who lost a valuable ring in the Severn. The old Lord declared
that whosoever would restore the ring should marry the fair Honoria. Robin
of Horsehill hearing this took his bow, and went off to the woods in sorrowful
mood, for
. . Long his love had dwelt upon
The best of womankind.”
* The strange creature said to be a salmon, has also been called a seal and a beaver ; bat the good folk of
Bcwdley and Ribbesford are unanimous in their opinion that it is a salmon. After a careful examination of the
carving I am convinced that the natives are right. The creature’s so called fore-legs are simply fins and the artist
has represented the fish in the act of leaping,
t John Ruskin s letter to the Editor of the Kiddevtiilnsier Tithes (dated Brantwood, July 27th, 1877-) Quoted
by Griffiths.


Presently Robin espied a doe on the opposite side of the Severn, he took aim.
“Just as he pulled his well tried bow,
And as his arrow flew,
Upleaped a salmon—thus the doe
And salmon both he slew.”
Within the salmon was found Honoria’s ring. Robin at once restored it to
the fair owner, claimed the promised reward, and thus obtained his heart’s
desire.*
* The Rev. J. R. Burton in his “History of Bewdley” (p. fig, 70) inclines to the belief that the Ribbes-
ford carving is an emblem of the Christian redemption“ The human soul, personified by the deer, or other
animal, is fleeing from the pursuit of a huge monster—typical of the evil one—when the Saviour intervenes
and slays the enemy. * * * This, too, seems to be the teaching of the carving on one of the capitals,
a bird is swooping down on a fish, coming to the rescue, however, is a larger bird, which, in turn, swoops
down upon the robber and delivers the fish. * * * Now, the fish is the well-known emblem of the
Christians."
The design on the tympanum is so unusual that, although it may have a religious significance also, it is
not improbable that it was suggested by an event in local history, as tradition affirms.

FAC-SIMII.E Of THE FIRST ENTRY (2ND COLUMN) IN THE WORCESTERSHIRE PORTION OF
DOMESDAY BOOK.
Ulnfcer tbe Conqueror,
OMESDAY BOOK : the name has an ominous sound, almost
A V sufficient to deter the uninitiated from venturing to raise the
% I ponderous cover of the volume; but in these days most people
C-f are aware the many interesting particulars which may be
s gathered from the concise entries of this wonderful old re-
cord. No picture more vivid of the political, economical,
and social condition of England at the period of the Norman settlement can
be obtained from any other source, and, since the returns arc conveniently
arranged according to counties, the characteristics of each shire may be studied
separately.
We will open the book and glance at the thirteen pages devoted to Wor-
cestershire. It will be noticed that the entries are written in contracted Law-
Latin and arranged neatly in double columns.
In the first column arc noted particulars relating to the coinage at the local
mint, rents and customs, great divisions of land, punishments and fines for
offences, military service, &c.
Then follows a list of twenty-eight principal land-owners — tenants-in-capile —
who held directly of the king.


With the second column the ordinary entries commence. First, we have
tire King’s lands, then the vast possessions of the Church, and, lastly, the
holdings of the lay proprietors. Each entry gives the name of the manor, its
chief members and area; the name of the tenant-in-capife , usually that of the
under-tenants, both in the Confessor’s time and at the time of the Survey ; how
much land was in demesne; the number of ploughs; particulars of population,
officials, mills, fisheries, nests of hawks, salt works, extent of wood-land, meadow
and pasture; the past and present value of each holding of land, &c. Like
all William’s work the Survey bears the stamp of completeness; it appears to
have been used for purposes of taxation, and Florence of Worcester states the
land was sorely harassed by the distress which ensued therefrom.
Domesday Book describes Worcestershire at two periods; first, in 1065, before
the Confessor’s death; second, in 10S5, after the establishment of the Norman
rule. A comparison between these two estimates shows how, by means of con-
fiscation, the land passed from the Anglo-Saxons to their Norman conquerors.
King Edward had reduced the crown lands in this county by liberal gifts to
churches, especially to Westminster Abbey, but he held the manors of Clent,
Tardebigge, Chfton-on-Teme and Kyre, beside salt works and houses in Droitwich,
and money rights in the city of Worcester. The King’s thanes held lands at
Hanley, Hadzor, Belbroughton, Hagley, Witton-in-Droitwich, Udccote, and
Tunuredele.
Edward the Confessor’s queen, Edith, had a small estate at Elmley Lovett,
and her thanes held lands at Stanford.
The great Saxon earls had possessions in various places; Godwine owned the
manor of Wichbold, and land at Belbroughton; Earl Edwin held Dudley, Broms-
grove and Beneslic, with salt-pans at Droitwich, and a money payment at Wor-
cester; Earl Algar probably held Lindridge and Rock, and his mother, the famous
Lady Godiva, who had estates at Brotune and elsewhere, bequeathed some of her
lands to St. Mary’s, Coventry. She was probably dead when the survey was taken.*
Harold son of Godwine (never called king in the survey, but simply earl), is
said to have possessed Inkberrow unjustly, A certain woman, Eddiva by name,
held Chaddesley, an estate of three thousand acres, beside five salt pans at
*W. d« Gray Birch, F.S.A. “Domesday Book,'' p. 95.


Droitwich, and property in Worcester. Who Eddiva was is not positively known,
but it has been conjectured that, since Eddiva is the Norman form of Edith,
she may have been the sister of Edwin and Morcar, widow of the Welsh
King Gruffydd, and afterwards Harold’s Queen. It is certainly remarkable that
this lady was the only Saxon land-owner, who retained possesssion of estates in
Worcestershire, in 1085. Other Ediths appear in Domesday Rook, they, however,
have no claim to represent the widow of two kings, a fact which strengthens
the Worcestershire lady’s case.
So clean a sweep having been made of the chief owners, it is not sur-
prising that the under-tenants should have disappeared also. Some hundred
and fifty names of Saxon tenants are recorded in the survey, but, in 1085,
scarcely ten remained. From this it is clear that Domesday is primarily a
record of confiscation; moreover, in this county, the change had often been
attended with loss, and in man) - places the annual yield was less than it had
been in Saxon days.
Turning to the second picture, we see the county as re-organized by King
William, who had taken into his own hands the estates formerly held by
King Edward and Earl Edwin of Mercia, regranting some, but retaining
possessions in Droitwich and Worcester, as well as Bromsgrove, a manor of
3,600 acres.* The manors of Kidderminster, Tardebigge, and Clent were in
the King’s hands, also the manors of Kinver and Swinford, for which the
Sheriff of Staffordshire was accountable—making a total of upwards of 11,000
acres, exclusive of the four royal forests, which were extensive.
The ancient possessions of the 1 Church were left undisturbed j indeed, the
politic Norman increased Church lands in Worcestershire, using monasteries to
strengthen his government. Experience had taught the King that English monks
were both reliable and pliable ; that it was easier to deal with a monastery than
with a baron; that Church vassals were equally useful in quelling rebellious
lords, or in resisting Welsh border raids. The Welshmen’s wild incursions upon
the Church’s lands caused the monks to dread the Cymric race, while they
hated the doctrines maintained by the still independent Welsh Church.
In Domesday, land is generally measure 1 by the hhie t a variable quantity which was regulated by the
fertility, and arabUily of the land to which the term applies. In this section the hide is computed at about
120 acres,


At the head of the religious houses stood the monastery of St. Mary,
Worcester, owning nearly 50,000 acres, chiefly in the ecclesiastical hundred of
Oswaklslaw, over which the Bishop had exclusive jurisdiction, both religious and
civil, to the exclusion of the ordinary rights of the crown, thus holding an
almost unique position amongst the great land owners of the kingdom. These
lands were shared between the Bishop and the monastery; the Bishop holding
the eight largest manors, the monastery the remaining seven.*
DESECRATED NORMAN CHURCH, KKTHERTON, ELMLEY CASTLE.
Ncthcrtou belonged to the Church of Worcester. Robert tire Conqueror’s steward held n
hides there at the time of the Survey, and afterwards built his Castle under Bredon Hill. The
body of the Church is Norman, the chancel and bell-turret, Early English. It is now used as
a cow-shed.
Next in importance came Evesham Abbey, which, in addition to estates in
Northampton and Gloucestershire, owned 18,000 acres in this county and a
peculiar jurisdiction in the Vale of Evesham.
The 12,000 acres possessed by Pershore Abbey, the third Benedictine monastery,
made up a total of upwards of 80,000 acres. Malvern Priory is not mentioned
*W. H. Hale, M.A., Register of Worcester Priory. Camden Society, Vol. 1865. Introduction, p. iv.


in the survey, an omission which proves it was of slight importance before the
Benedictines settled there in 1083. Westminster Abbey owned the Royal
Manor of Pershore, containing 24,000 acres, and other lands, amounting alto-
gether to over 40,000 acres. St. Mary’s Priory, Coventry, held Salwarpe, and
the Canons of Wolverhampton had a small Worcestershire estate.
In addition to these possessions of old foundations, six new ecclesiastical hold-
ings are recorded, hirst two alien Abbeys, St. Dyonisius, now called St. Denis,
near Paris, and the Abbey of Cormeilles, near Rouen. The Bishop of Here-
ford held 3000 acres. The Conqueror’s brother, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux,
12,000, the greater part of which he had taken from Kvesham Abbey, and granted
to the grasping Sheriff Urso, who had become one of the principal tenants of
the Church, to the great detriment of the monks. The' Abbey of (doucester,
and that of St. Cuthlac at Hereford, both had property in Droitwich.
The grand total of Church possessions can have been little short of one-
fourth of the cultivated area of the county -a vast estate —still the holdings
of the lay proprietors were much greater ; but the Norman landlords being
chiefly non-resident, as their Saxon predecessors had been, religious communities
were paramount in Worcestershire.
Although the Church was not despoiled of her lands, it does not follow that
the inmates of the monasteries remained undisturbed ; in most abbeys a con-
siderable number of Normans seem to have been added to the brotherhood,
and the Saxon tenants of the Church almost entirely disappeared. It was thus
that the strangers preyed not so much upon the Church herself as upon
Churchmen.
For many years before the Normans landed in England, a conspiracy had
been maturing at Rome, having for its object the subjection of the too in-
dependent Anglo-Saxon Church to the Pope, and of the Anglo-Saxon people to
the Duke of Normandy. The knowledge of this explains much which other-
wise would be inexplicable in William’s dealings with the Church in Worcester-
shire.
In distributing land in this county amongst his followers, the King seems to
have been influenced chiefly by the consideration that he was dealing with a
frontier shire. Ihe Welsh border was only a day’s march from Worcester, and


it was important that the border-lords, whose castles kept the wild Welshmen
in check, should, in times of danger, be able to draw retainers from estates in
neighbouring counties. Altogether there were in Worcestershire fourteen lay
tenants-in-chief, nine of whom kept watch and ward in border keeps. Included

in this list were the great names of Mortimer, Scroope, Laci, and Todeni, men
whose descendants figured prominently in the history of later times.*
That this county was regarded as a suitable district from which reserves might
*J. W. Willis-Bund, Esq., F.S.A. (“ The Domesday Book of Worcestershire," Transactions of Worcester Diocesan
Architectural Society, 1833.) his written an exhaustive and valuable paper upon the political aspect of the Survey,


be drawn in times of need is clear from the passage relating to military service
at the beginning of Domesday Book: —
“ Whenever the King; marches against the enemy, and anyone remains behind, after having
been summoned, he shall, if he he so far a freeman as to transfer himself and his land at will,
be at the King’s mercy, as regards all his lands.
“ If he be the freeman of any other lord and refuses to go against the enemy, and his lord
take another man as a substitute for him, he shall pay a fine of 40s. to his lord But if no
one will go he shall pay 40s. to his lord and his lord shall pay the same sum to the King.”
For administrative purposes the Sheriff, Urso de Abetot, and the Bishop, St.
Wulstan, stood side by side, and no earl was appointed. The Sheriff lived in
the ancient castle at Worcester, doing much as he liked, continually quarrelling
with the monks, and acting in a highhanded manner towards other people.
He practically farmed the county from the King, to whom he paid a fixed
rent, and sometimes, as stated in the Survey, lost thereby.
The Bishop’s temporal power being much increased caused that prelate to
assume somewhat of the character of an earl; he presided in a court of his
own, retained a body-guard of knights, and twice collected his vassals to fight
in the royal cause. He managed both temporal and spiritual things well,
making himself personally acquainted with the new land-owners, exhorting them
to benefit their vassals and inducing some to replace the little wooden churches
attached to their manors with substantial stone-built edifices; none of these,
however, are noticed in the Worcestershire survey, but fifty-nine priests are
mentioned. Monks were numerous in the county, yet the existence of one only
is recorded, and that one was at Evesham, where the inmates of the Abbey
then numbered at least one hundred.*
The great abbeys had been planted in the southern part of the shire, amid
the fruitful, well watered, and thickly peopled vales ; in the north, where,
owing to the extensive woods and less fertile nature of the land, the pop-
ulation was somewhat scanty, church lands were few, and monasteries were
not.
This northern district required a resident baron to govern it, and we find that
the King appointed William Fitz Ansculf, one of his followers, to perform the
duty; Fitz Ansculf built himself a strong keep upon the lime stone ridge at

Dudley. He was a wealthy man, the recipient of ninety-one manors, of which
twenty-five in Staffordshire, five in Warwickshire, including the Manor of Bir-
mingham, and fourteen
in Worcestershire lay
within an eight mile
radius from Dudley
Castle.

ing of 1071, portions

DUDLEY CASTLE, THE KEEL AND GATEWAY FROM THE COURTYARD, there WRS a primi-

of the places he received. It is written in Domesday Book that;
“ The same William (Fitz Ansculf) holds Dudley, and there is his castle, Earl Edwin held
this Manor. There is I hide. In demesne is i plough, and 3 villeins, and 10 boors and a
smith, with 10 ploughs. There are 2 serfs and 2 miles of wood. In the time of King
Edward it was worth £ 4, and now A 3 is its value.”
It is evident from this entry that in 1085; Dudley Castle was in Worcester-
shire ; for convenience of its lords it was in later times included in Staffordshire,
an arrangement which still holds, but the town of Dudley has ever been
counted in Worcestershire, with Fitz Ansculfs other Manors of Northfield,
Frankley, Weoley, Hagley, Cradley, Swineford, and Bclbroughton. The family
founded by this lordly Norman is still represented by an Earl of Dudley, but
the ancient barony is in abeyance. *
Not only does the Domesday Survey show the manner in which our county
* Sit William Dugdale speaking of William Fitz Ansculf, says, “Whether he had issue or not, or what
became of him I could never discover.” (Baronage, vol. i, p. 431). It is probable, however, that he had a
daughter Beatrice, who married Fulk Paganel, whose great-granddaughter, Hawyse, married John de Somerte,
whose son, Roger de Somerie, rebuilt Dudley Castle in 1263, and also fortified Weoley Castle, Northfield. See

p. 415.


was reorganized by the Normans; it also throws a flood of light upon the
commercial and social condition of the people.
There were three important towns in Worcestershire. Worcester, seat of civil
and ecclesiastical government, a fortified city with a market, and many houses,
some belonging to the Sheriff, and some to the Bishop; the latter had ninety
houses appropriated to one of his manors, and the Sheriff paid 100 shillings
for twenty-five of these in the market place. Evesham Abbey had twenty-eight
houses in Worcester, five were “wasted,” and there w r ere three houses belonging to
the Church of Hereford, for which a rent of thirty pence was paid. The census
of the burgesses of Worcester is not given, but eight burgesses are mentioned.
In the taxation of the county the city was rated at fifteen hides. The Sheriff
paid £2s ss. od. by weight for the city, and 4s. od. by weight for the
King’s demesne manors and the county' also by weight, and or a
Norway hawk; and to the Queen 100 shillings by tale, and 20 shillings for a
sumpter horse. These jQx'j and accrued from the courts of the county
and the hundreds, and if the fines failed to realise these amounts the Sheriff
had to make them up out of his own purse.
The fines for offences appear heavy. Should a man break the King’s peace
he was outlawed; but if it had been “given by the Sheriff” the fine was 100
shillings. For “forstel,” a sudden assault, or for “heinfare,” fighting after com-
mitting a murder so as to injure a servant, the fine was the same, 100 shillings.
Concerning Pershore, a town which had grown up around the ancient Abbey,
we are told little, but there were twenty-eight burgesses there belonging to the
monks of Westminster, who were lords of the manor.
At Droitwich, then an important commercial centre, there were 113 burgesses.
In addition to numerous furnaces appertaining to many manors there were three
salt pans, owned by as many manufacturers, who paid 300 mittas* of salt, and
received in return 300 cart loads of fire-wood from the royal wood-wardens.
Salt being then the most important, industry in Worcestershire, it is not
surprising that there are many entries relating to it in the Survey, but the
manufacture of salt was not confined to Droitwich alone; many villages, in
east Worcestershire, and in Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire, had salt-pans.
* A vutta— B or 10 bushels; it was also used by the Saxons as a measure of wheat and ale.


Honey was an important commodity also; Warwickshire was the centre of
the honey district, but Worcestershire folk seem to have been bee-keepers, and
the survey records several payments in honey.
Fisheries are mentioned, and eel stews, also several vineyards.
Among the chief occupations may be noted those of the miller, smith, and
hunter; at Hanley, Mathon, and Dudley, there were smiths; there were mills
in most manors, and woods varying from half-a-mile to three or four miles
in extent. One hunter held land in Earl Roger’s Manor of Hala.
The social position of the parish clergy in those days, if the Survey may
be taken as an authority in this matter, was indifferent, judging from entries
like the following:—“Nine beasts, a priest, and three villains.” The object of
Domesday, however, was not to ascertain the condition of the Church, or her
ministers, but chiefly to obtain a basis for taxation. Thus, every manor was
stated to contain so many “hides,” and the “geld” or tax was made upon
this return.
Land in demesne was estimated differently; not by its extent in hides, but
according to the number of “carucm” or plough-teams, of villains, of boors,
&c., belonging to it. In four instances only, are the number of hides in
demesne given.
This shows that, in addition to the payment of hidage, there was a further
tax upon personal estate, namely: the tax called “ carucagium,” occasionally
levied by the Anglo-Norman kings to the distress of their subjects, and it
justifies the complaint of the monkish historian, “ that there was not a single
ox, or cow, or swine, which was not set down in the census.” *
These minute particulars furnish important evidence upon the condition of the
people, the tenure upon which they held their land, and the system of culti-
vation then in practice. The village community had not lost its rights and
customs. In many places the system of common pasture was maintained, and
the acre strips of ploughed lands in the open fields were cultivated according
to the ancient tribal system, which had been in practice from time immemorial.t

With regard to the social condition of the people of "Worcestershire, it is
clear that by far the greater number were Bordarii , or Boors, —cottagers who
rendered occasional service in return for their maintenance, numbering 1728;
next stand the Vtllani, who held the folk-land for their support, but were in
servitude to the lord of the soil, there were 1520 in the whole shire. Far
below these numerically are the Burgesses, of whom 15 1 are recorded. Under
tenants numbered 129. This county is distinguished by having more Ancilliz
(female serfs) than any other English shire. Out of a total of 407 specified
in the record Worcestershire had 101, while in the adjoining County of
Stafford there was one only. There were 677 serfs, 73 ox herds, 41 cottagers,
33 knights ( Radmans ), 4 freemen, and a few swineherds, stewards, and foreigners,
one huntsman, one bedel, one sea captain, and one widow.

Earl Maleran.
SHEN the apple of discord was thrown into England, upon the
death- of Henry L, chance planted in Worcestershire a parti-
cularly sour crab, namely, Waleran de Beaumont, one of the
friends and chief advisers of Stephen.
Under the strong Norman rule, the Western Midlands had
enjoyed a long peace. In the city of Worcester, however,
there had been trouble enough, owing to frequent fires, caused by the houses
being almost all timber-built, Worcester, in the 12th century, had this much
resemblance to a modern American city ; it' arose with astonishing rapidity
after each conflagration. On July rgth, 1113, there seems to have been an
unusually great fire, since the city, the cathedral, and all the other churches,
and the castle were destroyed. One monk who had rendered great service to
the monastery, with two of his servants and fifteen citizens, perished in the
flames.*
Fearful though the conflagrations were, they were trifling compared with the
hardships inflicted upon the citizens during the civil war of Stephen’s reign,
when Worcestershire was the scene of perpetual fighting, and the city was
sacked and burned, and twice suffered the terrors of a siege. Much of this
trouble was brought about by Waleran de Beaumont, who became a scourge to
the Midlands, ;
■* Florence of Worcester. Sub. anno, 1113.
To this day there are in the city several ancient stone-built vaults or crypts, constructed, probably, by
merchants in the middle ages to preserve their goods from fire, In- a ■ lecture on “Ancient - Worcester, 0
delivered by T. J. Burgess, F.S.A., February, iB3?, the following passage occurs:—“Beneath the shop of Mr.
Griffin and Messrs, Fildes are two beautiful crypts, groined, and with moulded capitals. There are crypts
near the Guild Hall, and several in the neighbourhood of Bull-Entry.”


Waleran and his twin brother Robert were the sons of Robert de Beaumont,
Count of Meulan, or Mellent, in France, and Baron of Beaumont, in Normandy,
related to the kings of France, and to the ducal houses of Austria and Nor-
mandy. The elder Robert was one of Duke William’s companions in arms at
Hastings, and led a charge against the English at the commencement of the
battle. When William marched into the Midlands, in 1068, Robert’s services
were rewarded with grants of land in Warwickshire, and his brother Henry,
called de Newburgh from his birthplace, was made Constable of Warwick Castle,
and first Norman Earl of Warwick; he departed this life in 1123, while his
elder brother, Robert, died in 111 S, leaving his sons, then about fourteen years
old, to the guardianship of King Henry I.
The boys received a good education, and, in company with their guardian,
visited Normandy in 1119. In 1123, Waleran turned rebel; driven from one
stronghold to another, his last retreat was the Castle of Beaumont, which he
was compelled to surrender, and, being made prisoner, remained in close con-
finement for five years. Both he and his brother were, however, present at
the death of Henry I.
No sooner had Henry Beauclefk breathed his last, than Waleran de Beaumont,
forgetful of his obligations to the' old King, declined to hold his fiefs “under
the distaff” of the Empress Matilda, and hastening to England, became so
warm a partisan of Stephen, that he obtained a promise of his infant daughter
in marriage.* From that time Waleran and his brother became Stephen’s chief
advisers, heading the opposition to the powerful Bishop of Salisbury, and the
still more potent Robert, Earl of Gloucester.
At the commencement of the war (a.d. 1138-9) Stephen marched from
Somersetshire northwards, towards Shrewsbury. Passing through Worcestershire,
he came with his whole army to Dudley Castle, then held for the Empress by
Ralf Paganel, who had inherited the lordships of William Fitz-Ansculf. It was
so strong a fortress, and so well defended, that the King’s efforts to take it
were in vain, and being unable to prolong the siege, he desolated the sur-
rounding country, and collecting large herds of cattle from the Baron’s manors,
proceeded to Shrewsbury. Meanwhile, Ralf Paganel made terms with Stephen,
this marriage did not take place. Waleran de Beaumont is said to have married Elizabeth de Wontfort.


TRIPLE GATEWAY, DUDLEY CASTLE.
This gateway, the principal entrance to the castle on the south, is of somewhat unusual con-
struction, and was probably altered and added to at different periods. It formed part of the
defences strengthened or re-built by John de Somery, early in the 14th century, and was re-
paired and beautified by the Duke of Northumberland in the 16th century. The Norman
castle being demolished in 1174 (owing to the rebellious spirit of the Baron Gervase Paganel),
Paganel’s successor, Roger de Somery, received licence “to make a castle of his manor house at
Dudley and the like of his manor at Weoley,” in 1263. —C. Twamley, “History of Dudley
Castle,” p. 82.


and Dudley Castle remained a maiden fortress, till demolished by order ol
Henry 11., in 1174.*
THE PKIOIiY, DUDLEY (from an old engraving.)
A little later the famous battle of the Standard was fought, wherein David,
King of Scotland, and the partisans of Matilda were defeated, but Stephen was
. not in a position to take advantage of this victory and the Scots soon re-
assumed the defensive by laying siege to Wark Castle. This fortress had been
taken by Earl Waleran, and tire garrison he placed therein - made a desperate
resistance.
Before the close of the year 1139, Stephen had conferred upon Waleran de
Beaumont the Earldom of Worcester, in the hope that he would counterbalance
the influence of Robert, Earl of Gloucester.
* Florence of Worcester. Sub. anno, 113 S. Half Paganel married a daughter of Earl Ferrars. In 1140,
Matilda made him governor of Nottingham Castle, and he is said to have instigated Robert, Earl of Gloucester,
to enter the town and plunder the inhabitants. Repenting of his evil deeds late in life, he intended to found
a Priory at Dudley for the good of his soul, which pious intention was put into effect about the year 1161 by
his son, Gervase, who married Isabel de Beaumont, daughter of Robert, Earl of Leicester. The monks of
Dudley were of the Clugnlc Order. Unlike most Clngnic houses in England, Dudley Priory was not colonised
from France ; it was a cell under the Priory of St. Mllbuga, at Werdock,


The star of the House of Beaumont then appeared in the ascendant ; Waleran
and Robert, representatives of the elder branch, were Earls of Worcester and
Leicester respectively; their cousin, Roger de Newburgh, was
seized of the great Earldom of Warwick. There was not
then in the Midlands a more powerful family than that of
Beaumont, but in the same proportion that the power of the
barons increased, so did the King’s power decline. In the
tendency to establish men like the Beaumonts, the weakness
of Stephen’s policy was manifest.
Instead of being a promotor of peace and prosperity, the
new Earl brought fire and the sword, desolation, and all the
attendant horrors of civil war. From the account of the
monk John, who continued the chronicle of Florence, we
learn many facts relating to events happening at Worcester
during the time of Earl Waleran’s rule.
In Easter week (1139-40), after the Earl’s appointment,
Stephen came to Worcester with a magnificent retinue, and
w r as received with great festivity by the clergy and the people.
The King attended service at the cathedral; after prayers,
taking the royal ring from his finger, he laid the glittering
jewel upon the altar. On the morrow, the ring was returned
to him by consent of the monks. Wherefore the King re-
marked with surprise the humility and devotion of the flock of
the Church of Worcester.
The restless monarch, after a short halt, marched on to
Ludlow to besiege the castle there, returning by way of
Worcester, he went towards London, but being recalled to
quell some disturbances among his troops, he passed through
Worcester a third time, and then retired to Oxford.
The summer passed peacefully. On the first of August, 1140, Matilda,
and the Earl of Gloucester landed at Portsmouth. Stephen with more courtesy
than prudence, ordered the lady to be honourably conducted to her friends at
Bristol. Early in October the Empress came to Gloucester, where she was


well received. About that time tidings were brought to Worcester that vengeance
would be taken on the people of the faithful city, and that ere long the
enemy would advance -to attack them. Terrified by these reports, the citizens
consulted as to what was best to be done, The Earl was absent, and, ex-
cepting the castle and some forts on the south, the city was then defenceless.
Milo, the constable, had joined the Empress; Bishop Simon, a timid priest and
a foreigner, stood aloof. Under these circumstances, the citizens determined to
take refuge in the cathedral, and' to place themselves and their families, in
sanctuary, A monk, who was an eye-witness, has described what followed : —*
Then might be seen crowds of citizens carrying their goods into the church. Oh, wretched
sight!
Behold the principal conventual church of the whole diocese is turned into a hostelry for
townsmen, and little room is left for the servants of God in a building converted into a
warehouse for furniture.
The chant of the monks is mingled with the wailing of children, the sobs of infants at the
breast, and the lamentations of sorrowing mothers.
Oh, misery of miseries to behold ! The altar is stripped of its ornaments; the crucifix is
taken away, and the image of Maty, the blessed mother of Jesus, no longer adorns the
sanctuary.f Curtains and vestments are hidden away in the recesses of the wall. All that
gave pomp and magnificence to services and festivals of the Church has vanished, lest the enemy,
coming in suddenly, might plunder the very temple of God.
Between the citizens of Worcester and. of Gloucester there seems to have been
a rivalry similar to that between the Earls of the two places. The men of
Worcester were loyal to Stephen, and the men of Gloucester seized the oppor-
tunity of the presence of a large body of troops, led by their Earl, to vent
their spleen upon the Faithful City.
At day-break one morning in the beginning of winter, while we were chanting lauds in the
church, the long dreaded evil tidings were brought. The city of Gloucester had risen in arms,
a countless host of horse and foot were marching on Worcester to attack, to pillage, to burn.
We, in alarm for the treasures of the sanctuary, put on our albs, and, while the bells were
tolling, bore the relics of Oswald, our gloiious patron, in solemn procession out of the church,
and carried them through the cemetery, even while the enemy were rushing from gate to gate
through the streets of the city.J
The Empress’s troops first make an attack on a strong fort near the castle. Our people
bravely defend their position, repulsing the soldiers. Then, seeing the fire beacons blazing to
* Florence of Worcester, first continuation, ad, 1139-40,

sanctity. Miracles began at his tomb about a.d, izoo,


the north, the enemy try to force an entrance in that quarter, and there being no fortifications
there, the gate is forced, and the host rushes tumultuously in.
Alas ! mad with fury, they set (Ire to the houses. Fortunately, they do not burn all ; but
immense plunder in goods from the city, and in cattle from the country, is carried off, besides
many prisoners, coupled like hounds, are dragged into miserable captivity.
These things are done on the first day of winter, wduch will doubtless be very severe to the
w'retched sufferers.
In the week following these events, Earl Waleran arrived in Worcester to
find his city a heap of smouldering ruins. Touched by the sight, the stern
soldier mourned over the desolation, feeling that the injury done to the citizens
was an insult to himself. Burning for revenge, he descended upon Sudeley
Castle, then held by a partisan of Matilda. “If it be inquired,” wrote the
chronicler, “ what the Earl did there, the reply is such as it is scarcely fit to
record, returning evil for evil, he seized the people, the goods, and cattle, and
carried them off to Worcester.”
Soon aftenvards, the King set out from Oxford with a large army. When he
came in sight of Worcester, he mourned over the ruins as the Earl had done.
Then, on the principle of locking the stable door after the horse has been
stolen, Stephen appointed a new Sheriff and Constable of the castle, in place
of Milo of Gloucester, who had gone over to the enemy.*
The King’s choice fell upon William, son of Walter de Beauchamp, of Elmley
Castle, grandson of Urso de Abetot, and a member of a family notorious for
their adhesion to the cause of Matilda. But it is probable that William de
Beauchamp had married a relation of Earl Waleran’s, and if so the reason for
his appointment is clear.t
* Rymer. Ed. 1739 p, 4, gives a Charter of Matilda's (date 1141) making Milo of Gloucester Earl of Here-
ford, as a reward for his services to herself.
t Hugh de Beauchamp, companion of the Conqueror, obtained great possessions in England, but his name
does not occur in the Worcestershire portion of Domesday Book. His third son married Emeline, daughter of
Urso dc Abetot. Urso’s son, Roger, succeeded to his father’s honours. In a fit of passion he commanded a
royal officer to be slain, for which offence ire was banished by Henry 1., who gave his estates and honours
to bis (Robert’s) brother-in-law, Walter de Beauchamp, who appears to have been deprived of bis office on
account of his disaffection towards Stephen. Milo of Gloucester was appointed in his stead (Florence). From
an original charter, belonging to Mr. W. B. Bickley of Birmingham, I find a de Beauchamp—the Christian
name is illegible—conveys lands at Salwarpe, which ,c Amioia dc Meulcnt, formerly wife of William de Beachamp,
my grandfather, gave," &c. The date of the charter is about noo —1220. William de Beauchamp, William’s
grandson, was then living. It was he who married Isabella Manduit, and so obtained the Earldom of Warwick.
It is also remarkable that in the Lechmere Charter (given on p. 772), Earl Waleran called William de Beauchamp
his son. This favours the supposition that Amicia de Meulent (Mellent) was the Earl’s daughter, although no
existing pedigrees mention her, so far as I am aware.


In January, 1141, Milo, ex-constable of Worcester Castle, began to ravage
Gloucestershire, whereupon Stephen and Earl Waleran came again to Worcester
for the purpose of checking Milo, and driving out some of the hostile garrisons
in Herefordshire.
Mindful of the injuries done to Worcester, the Earl thought this an opportunity
for making reprisals, so he attacked Tewkesbury, and burnt the magnificent
manor house of Earl Robert, within a mile of the walls of Gloucester, Waleran’s
stern disposition seems to have been softening about that time, for, —
“Yielding to the supplication of the abbot and monks of Tewkesbury, he spared their pos-
sessions. Having taken much spoil and many prisoners, he was moved by clemency to order
the release of the captives, and permit them to return to their homes. On the morrow he
returned to Worcester, declaring to all that lie had scarcely ever made such a conflagration,
either in Normandy or England,"*
During the next few months, King and Earl made rapid marches from one
side of the county to the other. At Lincoln, they were overtaken by the Earl
of Gloucester with a force larger than their own. Stephen fought bravely against
fearful odds, but Earl Waleran and his knights fled at the first charge made
by the Imperial troops. Stephen was taken prisoner. The Earl of Worcester
hastened to assure Matilda that he would be faithful to the captured King, but
he soon wavered, and in 1143 assisted Geoffry of Anjou to besiege Rouen.
The change of disposition, which had commenced when the rough warrior
listened to the prayers of the Abbot of Tewkesbury, was now more manifest.
Waleran determined to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Probably he was led
to do this in the hope of expiating some of those sins, or similar ones, which
the chronicler feared to record. Before starting (a.d. 1145), he entrusted his
lordship of Worcester to his brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, and William de
Beauchamp, the Sheriff.!

[Seal gone, ]
It was then, probably, or after his return from the Holy land, that Waleran
founded an abbey for monks of the Cistorsian Order at Bordesley, in the
fertile Vale of Arrow, part of Beckenham Forest. The credit of being the
founder of Bordesley has long been given to the Empress Matilda, who urn
doubtedly granted a charter, couched in similar language to that of Earl
Waleran, a charter which was actually witnessed by him. Thomas Habington
remarked that :
“She whose fame soundeth most in the foundation of Bordesley Abbey is
Maude, daughter of Kinge Henry the fyrst, and wyfe of Henry the Emperor,
and mother of Kynge Henry the second; yet hee who layde the fyrst stone of
this charitable worckc (I thinke) was Wallcran de Bellomonte or Beaumont.” *
Robert, Earl of Leicester, also was a benefactor. Only a few heaps of grass
grown stones remain of the buildings of this once flourishing abbey.
Earl Waleran’s foundation charter reads as follows :
“Waleran, Earl of Mellent, to all sons of Holy Cluirch, both present and future.
Know ye that I have founded the Abbey of Bordosleia, of the Order of Cistercians, in honour

A second charter of the Earl, addressed to the Bishop of Worcester,
varies slightly from the former document: —
To the most reverend father and venerable lord Simon, by the grace of God, Bishop of
Worcester, and to all the sons of Holy Church, both present and future, Waleran, Earl of Mellent,

Upon his return to England, Waleran declared himself a partisan of Matilda,
and refused to surrender Worcester when Stephen appeared before it in 1150.
The King took the city, but not the castle, and in 1152 he renewed the
siege, intending to form a blockade. By the treacherous council of the
Earl’s brother, Robert, he was induced to destroy two forts which he had

built, and Waleran was at liberty again. This is the last we hear of him in
Worcestershire.
Waleran had given offence to his nephew, Robert de Montfort, who, upon his
arrival in Normandy, captured him and kept him a prisoner at Orbec, till he
restored to him his fief of Montfort.
When Henry II came to the throne, the Earl again appeared at Court, and,
in 1160, was one of the witnesses to a treaty between the King of England
and Louis of France. In the following year Henry seized his estates. He
died five years later (1166). By his wife, Elizabeth de Montfort, he left a son,
Robert, who succeeded to his French honours, but not to the great English
Earldom of Worcester, which he had forfeited.

f I] * n ie * r course among broken masses of old sandstone rock,
|f|i ar ° assoc ’ a f "’ith a curious legend.
Whelpley Brook, near Stanford Bishop, meanders through a
secluded glen, called Jumper’s Hole. Upon the surface of
the sandstone slabs at the bottom of this glen, circular and semi-circular indenta-
tions appear at intervals. Similar markings may be seen upon the rocks of
Sapey Brook, and, it is said, in other places, between Stanford Bishop and
Clifton-on-Teme. These markings somewhat resemble impressions made by
horses’ hoofs and patten-rings upon mud. According to popular belief, they are
tracks left by St. Catharine’s mare and colt, and their appearance is accounted
for by the following story
St. Catharine Audley and her maid, Mabel, while travelling in Worcestershire,
had their mare and colt stolen, upon which the saint prayed that wherever
the animals and the thief trod, the marks of their feet might be left as a
means of tracing them. The thief, it seems, was a girl wearing pattens, who
took the horses down several brooks to avoid detection. Hence the marks of
patten-rings and horses’ feet visible to this day. By means of these miraculous
markings, the animals were tracked and found at Ledbury.*
* The versions given by Mr, Noahc, “Notes and Queries for Worcestershire," 1856, p. 194, by Mr. J, Allies,
"Indentations in the Old Red Sandstone," and hy Mr. E. Lees, “ Pictures of Nature," pp. 140-44, are sub-
stantially the same.


Mr, J. S. Haywood, writing to the editor of Berrow’s Worcester Journal. ,
many years ago, gives a slightly different version :
St. Catharine, sister of St. Kenelm, was a great saint, who cured all
manner of ailments. In her rounds of doing good, she abode with her
brother at Clifton and at Clent. While upon one of her visits to Clifton,
the devil was so ‘ rampagious ’ at seeing the good she did that he was set
upon stopping her progress, and in the night stole her mare and colt; thinking
that no traces of them should be found, the sly old rascal took the animals
down Sapey Brook; but St. Catharine prayed that whatever way they went
their foot-marks might be left behind, and there they are. The mare and colt
were found at Ledbury, and a hospital dedicated to St. Catharine arose on
the spot where the horses were sheltered.
In the Worcestershire parish of The Rock similar markings appear upon the
stones of Dick Brook. The . legend here takes a different complexion. The
church, so it is said, was being built on the opposite side of the brook from
where it now stands, but in the night the stones were carried across the brook
to the high ground, and there deposited by a mare and foal, the marks of
whose feet may still be seen imprinted on the stones in the bed of the
stream,
The obvious absurdity of the legend, and the confusion of details, may be
taken as the rough husk surrounding a kernel of truth, and as tending to
prove the antiquity of a story invented to explain a natural phenomenon.
The confusion between the good Dornemyl, sister of St. Kenelm, king and
martyr, and Catharine Audlcy, may have arisen from the fact that the
church of Clifton-on-Teme, which is near some of the “ tracks,” is dedicated
to the boy saint, but it is hard to see any connection between his satanic
majesty and a girl in pattens. The allusion to pattens, however, probably
refers to a medieval practice of placing upon stolen horses, or upon the horses
of fugitives, iron shoes, sometimes circular like pattens, and sometimes cloven
to resemble the hoof of a cow, thus baffling pursuers. Several shoes of this
description have been found in Worcestershire.*
* I have recently seen, dragged ttp from the moat at Birt's Moreton Court, near Tewkesbury, an object of
iron, which I believe to have been used as a bailie for a horse.


Geologists see nothing remarkable in the so-called “ tracks." They are simply
‘potholes,” formed by the action of water. The stream forms little eddies,
in which pebbles and sand are whirled round and round, scooping out hollows
larger or smaller, as the case may be. In the first instance, perhaps, a pebble
may have been loosened and washed out of the sandstone, and the small hole
thus left gradually enlarged till it assumes the dimensions of a horse’s hoof.
In the case of the “patten-rings,” possibly concretions of marlstone and other
soft matter have been washed out of the cavity.
Many amusing theories have been formed by antiquaries to account for these
“pot-holes.” It has even been suggested that they are really “tracks of ante-
diluvian mares and colts,”* but the simple explanation given above admits of
little doubt as to its correctness.
Catharine Audley is a local saint, her name is not to he found in the calendar, nor her
biography in the pages of Alban Butler, she must not be confounded with St, Catharine of
Ricci, nor with her namesakes of Bologna, Sw'eden, Sienna, Genoa, and Alexandria, the latter
of whom was tortured on four wheels furnished with sharp knives. Catharine Audley (de Bohun?)
lived in the reign of (?) Edward 11. (1307-1327). In obedience to a revelation that she should
not rest till she came to a towm where the hells should ring of themselves, Catharine and her
maid, Mabel, wandered from place to place, till, following the tracks of her stolen mare out
of Worcestershire into Herefordshire, she came near Ledbury, where she heard the bells
ring though no ringers were there. At Ledbury she determined to spend the remainder of her
life. She and her maid built a hermitage and lived on herbs and milk, w'hich latter they
obtained from a farm called “'I he Hazel,” half a mile away from their retreat.
The King, out of respect for her piety and her noble birth, granted her an annuity of /30. f
To this day there is a piece of laud near the town called “Catharine’s Acre,” and close by,
another plot called “ Mable’s Furlong.” In the Parish Church is a chapel dedicated to St.
Catharine, and in the High Street a School or Hospital of St. Catharine founded by Bishop
Hugh Folliott J in 1232, many years before the local saint was born.
During the centuries which have passed since Catharine Audley built herself a hermitage at
Ledbury her name has naturally been confused with that of her more famous namesake, the
Princess of Alexandria, whose day was observed on November 25th. The 23rd of November,

St. Clement’s Day, was one of the ancient quarterly periods of the year,* and the Dean and
Chapter of Worcester Cathedral closed their audit on the 25th. It was their custom on that
day to distribute amongst the inhabitants of the college precincts a rich compound of wine, spice,
&c., called “The Cattcrn Bowl,” a survival of a very ancient custom of hospitality. In many
villages in the county hoys and girls used to go round to the farm houses on St, Catharine’s
Day asking for apples, &c., and singing a quaint carol.
In Mr. Noakc’s exceedingly interesting, and now rare, little book entitled, “Notes and Queries
for Worcestershire” (p. 2t6), two versions (Nos. 1 and 2) of the rhyme or carol usually sung
on St. Catharine’s Day in Worcestershire are given as follows:
(I.) (2.)
Catt’n and Clement comes year by year, St. Clement’s! St. Clement’s! a cat by the ear!
Some of yr. apples and some, of yr. beer ; A good red apple—a pint o’ beer !
Some for Peter, some for Paul, Some o’your mutton, some o’ your vale! [veal]
Some for Him who made us all. If it’s good gie us a dale [deal], -
Peter was a good old man, If its naught gie us some saut [salt] !
For his sake give us some :
Some of the best and none of the worst, Butler, butler, fill the bowl—
And God will send yr. souls to roost. If >’° 11 fill h °f the best,
God will send your soul to rest ;
Up the ladder an! down with the can, But if you fill it of the small,
Give me red apples and I’ll be gone. The Devil take butler, bowl, and all.
“The ladder,” Mr. Noake remarks, “alludes to the store of apples, generally kept in a loft;
and the can, doubtless, to the same going down into the cellar for beer.” The custom of
“going a Cattaring,” is said to have been revived in Worcester when Queen Elizabeth visited
the city on St. Catharine’s Day, but it is, probably, a survival of a much older custom of
carrying the image of the saint in piocession and of singing a Latin hymn. Mr. J. Bolter
Briscoe, of Nottingham, has recorded another version of the carol (No. 3)» a fourth was sung
some years ago at Chaddesley-Corbet (No. 4), another rhyme described the route to be taken
by the young folk who indulged in the frolic. The following were the places to he visited: —
“ Astley, Arley, Denley, Shrawley, Hartlebury, and Emley,
Milton, Torlon, Tilton, Charlton, Holt, Hallow, Grimley.”
(3)
If you’re within, If you fill it of the best,
Open the door and let us in, God will send your soul to rest;
And when we’re in But if you fill it of the small,
We won’t come out The Devil take butler, bowd, and all.
Without a red apple Our bowl is made of the ashen tree,
Rolled up in a clout. Fray, good butler, drink to we !

»■ ARVELLOUS as a compilation, though unreliable historically,
the Brut or Rhyming Chronicle of Lazamon marks an epoch
in the development of English literature; it is in great part
an English translation of the fabulous history of England,
V \ compiled by Robert Wace, a Norman clerk, who translated
into romance verse the Latin Chronicle of Geoffrey of
Monmouth. In the Brut we read of the flight of hEneas and his companions
from Troy, and of the settlement in England of Brutus, a mythical grandson
of the Trojan Prince; of the Court of King Arthur and the mighty deeds of
the Knights of the Round Table; of the prowess of Cadwallader and of many
other fabulous and romantic personages.*
* The word Brut is said to be derived either from Bruins, traditionally first King of Britain, or more
probably from " bruti,” & rumour or history, from which derived our word “ bruit."


Although, when viewed simply on its merits as a literary production, it is a
dull rhymed rhapsody, barbarous, halting, disjointed, with no continuous ideas,
“babbling in little confused and incomplete phrases after the fashion of the
ancient Saxons,”* the Brut has, nevertheless, a special value to philologists and
historians. It is a monument of our language; less than fifty Norman words
occur in over thirty thousand lines of Lazamon’s poetry. Even the old poetic
construction remains the same. The alliterative meter of the older verse is
scarcely affected by the new rhyming terminations; the similies are those
familiar to Englishmen from the writings of Caedmon; the descriptions of
battles and sports, such as were delightful to the old Saxon warriors.
Lazamon shall tell his own story, who he was, where he dwelt, and how he
came to write a poem which gave expression to the national spirit of the
English people, then awakening to a consciousness of their own responsibility
and power.
There was a priest in England named Lazamon, Leovenath’s son, may the Lord be gracious
to him! lie dwelt at Emley, at a noble church upon Severn’s bank, near to the Radestone;
pleasant it seemed to him to read books there, and his thoughts were busy with a plan to
write a poem which those around him might understand. lie wished to tell of the noble deeds
of the English, of the names of the famous men who fust possessed the land after the flood
which came from the Lord and destroyed all mankind, except Noah and Sem, Japhed and
Cham, and their four wives wiro were with them in the ark.
Lazamon began to journey through the country in order to collect copies of the great manu-
scripts which w'ere to be his authorities. First he took the English book that St. Beda made,
another he took that St. Albin wrote, and Austin who brought baptism to the heathen. The
third book he chose w T as the chronicle of a French clerk named Wace, who wrote skilfully
and gave his book to the noble Eleanor, King Henry’s Queen.
These three books Lazamon laid before him, with loving care he viewed them and turned
over the leaves. May the Lord be merciful to him ! Presently taking his pen in hand he
began to write and to set the true words together. {The Brut, Stanza I.)
Till recently there have been doubts as to the locality in which Lazamon
lived. The doubts have now been removed by Sir F. Madden, who has edited
and published the two earliest MSS. of the Brut, and by the present Rector
of Areley Kings, the Rev. D. Vawdrcy, to whom is due the credit of a
*R* A. Taitie, His. of Eng. Lit., 4 vols., 1877. Vol. 1, p. 123. Mr. Taine seems to under-estimate
the value of the Brut, regarding it simply from a literary point of view, he probably is to error in calling its
author a monk. Lazamon himself states he was a priest. Compare with this the more comprehensive criticism
of J. R. Green, “Hist, cf Eng, People,” ed. 1892, Vol. 1, p. 22?.


remarkable archaeological discovery. There are two Arleys near the Severn, one
above, the other below Bewdley —Upper Arley being in Staffordshire, while
Areley Kings is situated in Worcestershire, on the western side of the river.
Here “the noble church” stands upon “Severn’s bank,” near “the Radestone,”
exactly in accordance with the description in the poem, consequently Ernelei
is clearly identified with Areley Kings.*
The view from this high churchyard somewhat resembles the beautiful prospect
which meets the eye from the summit of Hanbury’s church-crowned hill —a
prospect upon which Old Habington descants (see p. 15) —only we have here
the additional advantage of a shining river, flowing through green pastures
towards the sea. In the early 13th century, the land was less cultivated than
it is now, but the landscape upon which Lazamon gazed was, probably, no less
beautiful than that familiar to us in the 19th century. It might well seem good
to him to read the service and to study in a place so pleasant.
To the south-west are the Abberley Hills, and the park and court of Witley.
Westward are the tree-covered slopes towards Ribbesford and Bewdley. On a
clear day the bright reflection of the rising sun may be seen sparkling upon
the windows of Ticknell Palace. Upon the opposite bank of the river lies the
modern town of Stourport, and beyond it the bare headland of Hartlebury
Common with, here and there, a gaunt fir-tree, rising above the gorse and
bilberry hushes. At the foot of the hill on 'which the church is built, stands
a typical old Worcestershire mansion embowered in lofty elms, and showing
every sign of a prosperous and well-ordered home. At this house, it is said,
Prince Rupert once made his head-quarters when marching along the old road,
from Worcester towards Wales—a road which descended to the river at a famous
ferry by the Redstone Hermitage.
There is a widespread belief that in this rock-hewn hermitage Lazamon lived
and wrote his Brut,f but the tradition is not supported by the poet’s own
statement, and there is no evidence (so far as I am aware) of the existence

of the Hermitage at a period so early.* Lazamon, who lived at the end of
the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century, “read books,” i.e., service-
books, and also other books, according to the context, at the “noble church”
at Areley; parts of that church dating from late in the nth century are

still standing, and Lazamon’s name has been found upon the stones. When
the church was partly rebuilt in 1885-6, a walled-up north doorway was opened;
within it was found, still hanging in its original position, the Norman oaken
door, with large C-shaped iron hinges, and a massive wooden bolt, 2-ft. 4-in.

Library,” p. 31 ; Nash, vol. 1, p. 41 ; Laird, “ Beauties of England and Wales,” Worcestershire, p. 275.
Lazamon is said to have been born at Astley (the adjoining parish to Areley), the parish in which the Redstone
hermitage is situated. His father is supposed to have been a Worcestershire man, but beyond the slight
reference to him in the Brut I know of no other. The person with a similar name recorded in Domesday
Book can scarcely have been he.
Under “ the land of Eadulf de Todeni ” in More, Leitenof held the manor and could go where he would.
Under 1 the land of William Fitz Ansculf* in Bellem, Leuenot held the manor from King Edward the
Confessor.
T, he old timber building to the south of Areley Church is now used as a stable, it formerly served as a
school, and may have been a priests' house, but it is modern as compared with the chutch of Lazamon's time.
The present rectory may be two centuries old. In the garden is a study built by a former rector who, as
an inscription over the door testifies, there sought a retreat from domestic worries.


long. When the floor of the aisle was taken up, several dressed stones were
found in and near a rubble wall beneath. These stones evidently had formed the
steps and lower part of a circular Norman font; the step being a circle of 5 feet in
diameter. The Rector placed them in his own garden, where one day, after heavy
rain, traces of letters were noticed upon the moulded plinth of the font, and
when a thick coat of paint and whitewash had been removed and the fragments
arranged in position, the following inscription became distinctly visible :
INSCRIPTION ON BASE OF FONT, ARELEY KINGS’ CHURCH.
The stone is fractured at the part of the poet’s name where the third letter came. Probably
the missing letter was “ 3,” a sign which, in this instance, represents gh , having a sound re-
sembling In ordinary type this letter is represented by e ; in the older MSS., the form is
Lajamon (MS. Cott. Calig, A. ix.) and Laweman (MS, Cott. Otho. c.xiii ), but of late, in print,
the name has usually appeared Layamon. Sir F. Madden, however, prints it correctly “ La3amrm.”
The stones have now been replaced in the church and again used for the
purpose for which they were originally intended.
There can be no doubt as to the antiquity of the inscription; the character
of the letters shows that they were cut in the 13 th century, the thick coat of
paint and the position in which the relics were found preclude the possibility
of fraud. These, then, are the veritable stones of a Norman font. The
inscription must have been cut by some one who revered Lazamon’s memory,
and, wishing to hand down to posterity the knowledge that the good priest
and author lived and laboured in this pleasant Severn-side village, engraved his
name upon the imperishable stones within the church.*
* The thanks of the author are due to J. Brinton, Esq., for kindly placing at his disposal some useful
notes relating to Lazamon and Are fey Kings, as also to, the Rev. D. Vawdrey, M.A,, for information respecting
the discovery of the inscription, &c.


£be Hast Crowning ot Ibenn> tbc Seconb.
T m WaS a CUS^°m Borman Kings to celebrate the three
great festivals in one or other of the cities of Southern
England. On those occasions the King appeared clad in robes
41 sta,:e and wearing the royal crown; he attended service
oublicly in the Cathedral, or Monastic Church, and presided
over an assembly of his Councillors. This wearing of the
crown was a coronation, though not in the modern and restricted sense of the
word.
There being no fixed capital, the King could hold his Court where he
chose; Winchester, Westminster, and Gloucester were equally favoured, and
sometimes Worcester was given the preference. When the affairs of Wales
required attention, Worcester became a convenient place at which to com-
mence an expedition or conduct negotiations. The pleasant surroundings of
the city, its situation on the Severn, and the sanctity of its church, hallowed
by the memories of Oswald and Wulstan, may also have recommended it to
both kings and courtiers.
Edward the Confessor ordained that as often as he, or his successors, should
wear the crown at Worcester the chanter should receive from the exchequer
half a mark, and the Monastery a hogshead of wine, and 100 simnels (cakes),


The same; payment was to be made to Westminster or Winchester, as the case
might be.*
At 'Winchester, Westminster, Gloucester, and Worcester the Norman Kings
had houses. The royal house at .Worcester, built within the castle ward, upon
what is now College Green, must. have been a pleasant habitation \ the noble
river flowed below its walls, the castle mound and formidable keep . protected it
on one side, the monastery and fair Cathedral adjoined it on the other. The
western windows looked out upon the river, and before them stretched the
fertile Severn valley to the woods of Malvern Chase, where the blue hills
showed their outline against the western sky.t
The castle at Worcester was a fitting residence for kings, if we may judge
from the only portion of the ancient buildings now remaining—Edgar’s Tower
—a noble gate-house built about King John’s time. To this palace came
sometimes, it is said, William the Conqueror and Henry 1., to keep the
Midwinter festival. Stephen, also, was a frequent visitor. Hither came Henry 11.,
and his Queen Eleanor, to keep the Easter festival in the year 1158. The
King and Queen attended service in the Cathedral on Easter Day, and at the
offertory took off their crowns and offered them upon the altar, “vowing that
they would never in all their lives wear them again.”]: Thus was a time-
honoured custom —that of wearing the crown—broken by a king who hated pomp,
but thought it prudent to throw a religious glamour over an act which might
otherwise have been unpopular.
The king observed his oath; though afterwards he caused his son, Prince
Henry, to be crowned, and, like old Lear, divided his dominions, nominally at
least, among his children.
* Mr. J. Noake, “Worcestershire Nuggets,” p. i, quoting “Annals of Westminster."
t The King's house at Worcester was granted to the Monks by Charter of Henry 111. It stood upon the
land taken from the Monastery by Urso de Abetot, and is thus described in the Charter: —
“ Ye part of ye Castell of Worcester which lyeth on ye north side of ye same castell wherein our house
was situate, and which is of our fee, reaching to ye part of the said castell which is of the fee of Walter de
Beauchamp,” Stc., &c. [Habington’s MSS. quoted by Mr. Noake, The Monastery and Cathedral of Worcester,
pp. 50-51.]
The Pope’s Legate, Gnalo, and the Earl of Pembroke, had given this part of the Castle to the Monks,
‘‘for enlarging their court, on yt day when the bodie of Lord John, our king and father, was commanded to
his sepulchre in the Church' of St. Marie of Worcester."

King, as an empty title, in nowise satisfied Prince Henry; in 1173 he and
his brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, took up arms against their father to compel
him to relinquish the reins of government. At last Henry’s youngest and best
beloved son John joined in the impious struggle, and the old king, driven
from place to place, reached Chinon and there expired. Thirty years had
passed since the outward signs of royalty had been put aside in the choir of
Worcester Cathedral, upon the very spot where, in after years, the body of
King Henry’s undutiful son John was laid to rest before the high altar.
EDGAR’S TOWER, WORCESTER.
The date of the construction of the so-called “Edgar’s Tower” is fixed at a.d. 1204, by
an entry in the “Roluli de Liberate,” quoted by Mr. Noake, “Worcestershire Nuggets,” p. 46,
Doubtless this building replaced an older gateway, but both Habington and Thomas refer to
it as “ King John’s Tower.” It has been repaired at various times, and has had windows
inserted. Ihe lower is now used as an office and muniment room for the Bishop’s Registrar.
The marriage licence of William Shakespeare, and the ancient records of the Monastery, are
among the chief treasures kept in Edgar’s Tower.

For so he will’d it.
King John, Act v. t Scene vii.
ROM the first year of his reign until his death in 1216, King
/ J°^ n was a rec l uent visitor at Worcester, often coming twice
r in a y ear > as * n I2 °4> when he met Llewellyn, Prince of
W Wales here. His journeys were made with astonishing
rapidity; he attended personally to the business of the
country—hearing cases, settling disputes, acting as a judge
as well as a king. Sometimes he held his Easter court at the Faithful City;
sometimes he came here for the Christmas Festival. Kinver and Feckenham
forests were his favoured hunting grounds. There are still extant orders for the
repair of the king’s house at Feckenham, “ against the tempests and the wintry
weather.”
Great supplies of corn and wine were sent at his order from the royal store
at Bristol or Gloucester, to Worcester, Bridgenorth, or Kinver, and for the feast
on Mid-Lent Sunday, 1205, the king’s purveyors sent to Worcester quantities of
sturgeon, herrings, ginger, spices, and other provisions.- At .another time the
steward of Wilton was commanded to send to Worcester 1000 ells of linen for
tablecloths.
In July, 1209, when the Worcestershire lanes were shady, and the delicate
perfume of elder flowers mingled with the scent of new mown hay, King John
came to Hanley Castle. He was there again in 1213, when the November
mists began to appear upon the meadows.


Again, in 1215, King John held his Christmas court at Worcester, and took
counsel with his barons upon matters of great importance to the future pros-
perity of England, The meeting at Runnymede on June 9, and the signing
of the great charter, was the sequel of the meeting at Worcester six months
before.
In the last year of his unhappy reign, when harassed by his nobles and
menaced by a formidable foreign rival, John came to Worcester on August 16,
Here he signed an order to the citizens of Worcester to pay to Walter de
Beauchamp owing from them, that it might be distributed in alms.* On
the 19th he had gone down the river to Berkley from whence he wrote a letter
to the Governor of Worcester Castle as follows :
“The King to all &c.
“Know ye that we have given license to John Marescall, that if Louis with his army, or his
army without him, shall come to Worcester to besiege the castle of Worcester (so that that
siege cannot be raised without an army) that he (Louis) shall not place his body (?) of troops
(corpus suum) in that castle of Worcester ; whilst, nevertheless, he (John) may let such people
into it, as with honour and independently may guard that castle,
“Witness myself at Berkel (Berkley), 19th August.”t
From Berkley, John went to Bristol, and thence to Bradford-on-Avon, where
he wrote another letter to the Earl of Pembroke, commending to his care
Warren Pieche his (the King’s) groom, who lay sick at Worcester. The Earl
was to provide the sick man with game and other provisions, till he was
fully restored to health.
Accustomed to regard John as inhuman, this touch of tenderness comes upon
us almost like a revelation. Perhaps the cruelties of John were not so much
inherent as the result of the barbarous tendencies of the age in which he
lived. His reign was a continual straggle with the Pope and Clergy, who
opposed him because he tried to free England from Papal authority; with the
Irish, who regarded him as a foreign usurper; with the barons, who hated him
because he was autocratic; and with the King of France, who regarded him as
a dangerous rival. There is no cause to wonder at asperities of character in

HISTORIC WORCESTERSHIRE.


a king so persecuted. Moreover, the monkish historians were much prejudiced
against John, and therefore presented him and his actions in the worst possible
light.
By September the first, the King had reached Cirencester on his northward
march, and from that place he sent a “ safe conduct ” to enable Silvester de
Evesham, the newly-appointed Bishop of Worcester, to join him. A few days
later, the King had reached Lincoln, and turning southwards, marched through
Peterborough, Croyland, and Lynn. Turning towards the north again, he marched
to Wisbech, resolved to attempt the dangerous passage of the Wash.
He crossed the broad sands at the mouth of the Welland in safety, and,
pausing upon the further side, saw the returning tide overtake a long train of
sumpter horses and baggage-wagons, No efforts of drivers or of horses could
extricate the heavy carts from the quicksands in which they were sinking. The
waves rose higher and higher, soon the baggage train, wagons, horses, and men
were hidden beneath the surging waters.
Passion ungovernable, took possession of the King. The loss of the crown
jewels angered him, still more the loss of the supplies of money and arms,
wherewith he intended to equip and pay his troops—his only hope in the
contest against Louis the Dauphin and the disloyal barons. Exhaustion followed
the paroxysm, and a fever began to waste the King’s frame.
Weary of fighting with rebellious barons, weary of going hither and thither
through the land without rest for body or for mind, weary unto death, King
John came on the night of his losses to the Abbey of Swineshead in Lincolnshire,
in bitter grief he entered the Abbey, where, it is said, he straightway surfeited
himself with peaches and new beer; though a later story tells how a crafty
monk, wishing to save the honour of the Abbot’s sister, of whom John was
enamoured, poisoned some pears, “ whereof the king did eat, though the jewels
about him sweated —a sure sign of the presence of poison,” * It is to this
story that Shakespeare alludes :
Hubert. The King, I fear, is poison’d by a monk;
I left him almost speechless.
* The popular story of this poisoning may be true or false, but it was not told till half a century after the
event, and then appeared in several versions.

Next morning the King was able to continue his journey to Sleaford Castle,
and upon arriving there dictated a letter to the new Pope, Honorius 111., to
whose care he commended the interests of his children. Though suffering
greatly he left Sleaford, and rode in a horse-litter to Ne\vark-on-Trent. Being
sensible that he could not live many days,- John there confessed his sins and
made his will. Three days afterwards, on October 19th, 1216, he died.
The will made by King John on his death-bed at Newark-on-Trent, is still
kept in the Chapter House at Worcester Cathedral.
From the facsimile here given it will be seen that it is a small, beautifully
written, document; the writing being a good example of the current or charter
hand, as distinguished from the more formal book-hand of the period. There
is no doubt but that this MS. is an original attested copy of King John’s
will. The document bears marks of having had four seals attached to it by
means of slips of parchment. The seals, however, have disappeared,* probably
they were removed at the time when the MS. was in private keeping.
In general arrangement the will resembles that of Henry ll,t but it is much
shorter and couched in more general terms, doubtless owing to John being
“ unable at the time of his illness to consider separate details.”
It was quite natural that the document should have been deposited at Wor-
cester ; it was the direct evidence that the monastery was entitled to the
remains of the dead king. In 1228, the right of the monks to retain the
king’s body was disputed, and the Pope wrote to the Bishop of Worcester,
saying it ought to be removed to Beaulieu, an Abbey founded by John, with
the idea that it would contain his tomb, “The disturbance between the king
* This will was lost for a time, but was restored, with other papers belonging to the Dean and Chapter, by
Mr. E. Cayley. When the Archaeological Congress met at Worcester in ISBI, a printed sheet describing the
will was circulated among the members. This description, however, was full of errors.
t Printed in Rymers “ Focdera ” Ed- 1739, vol. i.. p. 19, It is, of course, possible that the Worcester
document may be only the first part of the will, each part would be separately witnessed, and this part relates
to Worcester especially; but, on the other hand, the terms of the will and the circumstances under which it
was made, seem to account for its brevity.


THE WILL OF KING JOHN.

and the barons,” the Pope said, “had drawn John far away from that house,
and occasioned his burial elsewhere.”
The monks of Worcester, however, could produce the will—indisputable evidence
of their right to a possession which brought a considerable revenue to their
house, and they retained the body of the king.
Translation of the Will of King John.*
I, John, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and
Aquitaine, Count of Anjou, hindered hy severe illness, and being unable at the time of my
ilfness to consider separate details, so as to make my will dealing with my affairs separately,
commit, according to law, the arrangement and disposition of my will to the fidelity and
disposition of my faithful (subjects) whose names are subscribed, without whose advice, while
they were present with me, even when I was in good health, I should arrange my will in
nothing whatsoever; that whatever they shall faithfully ordain and dispose concerning my affairs,
as well in making satisfaction to God and the Holy Church for the ills and injuries done to
them, as in sending help to the land of Jerusalem, and in providing support for my sons, for
the purpose of obtaining and defending their inheritance, and in rewarding those who have
faithfully served us, and in making distribution to the poor and to religious houses for the
health of my soul, be ratified and confirmed.
I pray also that whoever shall give them counsel and assistance for the carrying out of my
will, receive the grace and favour of God ; but that whosoever shall infringe their arrangements
and disposition may incur the curse and indignation of Almighty God, and of the Blessed Mary,
and of all the saints.
Firstly, therefore, I desire that my body be buried in the Church of St. Mary and St.
Wulstan of Worcester, and 1 appoint the following arrangers and disposers:— The Lord
G[ualo], by the grace of God, Cardinal Priest hy the title of St. Martin, Legate of the
Apostolic See; The Lord P[eter], Bishop of Winchester; The Lord R[ichard], Bishop of
Chichester; The Lord S[ilvester], Bishop of Worcester; Brother Aimery, of St. Maur ;
W[iluam] Mareschal, Earl of Pembroke ; R[anuli*h], Earl of Chester; William, Earl
de Ferrars; William Briwer, Walter de Lascy, and John de Monmouth, Savai.ric de
Mauleon, Falkes de Breante.
In accordance with the tenour of his testament, John’s burial took place at
Worcester, and is thus referred to in a MS. Book of the Priory of Worcester,

Among the records of the Exchequer, there is an account of money paid for
several pieces of silk delivered to the Earl of Pembroke, and by him given to
the Prior of Worcester, for covering and adorning King John’s tomb.* In a
letter to the justiciar of Ireland, Henry 111. refers as follows to the solemnities
of his father’s funeral :
When, therefore, at the bidding of Him whose wishes both death and life obey, our Lord
and Father (may his soul rest in heaven) left this light, we wish you to know that after his
death, his obsequies having been solemnly performed in the Church of the Blessed Mary of
Worcester, we summoned many of the magnates of our kingdom to assemble at Gloucester, &c.f
During King John’s last visit to Worcester he had cause to fear that some
of the leading men of the county would join the standard of Louis the
Dauphin. In 1205, he had made William de Cantilupe seneschal of Worcester
Castle, although part of that fortress was of the fee of Walter de Beauchamp
the Sheriff; In 1205, Walter de Beauchamp was excommunicated with many
other English barons, and his name appears in the interdict, which Bishop Mauger
assisted in proclaiming. J . The Bishop then fled to France, and died in the
Cistercian Abbey of Pontigny, the refuge of Becket. [| For a reason, which
does not appear, de Beauchamp was pardoned, and John wrote to his seneschal
the following letter about the guardianship of his Castle
“ The King to William de Cantilupe greeting.

time he may go to Lord Gualo, Legate of the Apostolic See, to ask of him the benefit of
absolution, and to return to us absolved, And we command you to deliver the keeping of

him that he had committed to John Marescall
“our Castle of Worcester, with the county and
all its appurtenances, also all the forests of
Worcestershire.”* A few weeks later the castle
was in the possession of some one (? William,
son of William Marshall), who declared in
favour of the French Prince. Then came the
Ear] of Chester with an army, whereupon the
soldiers in the castle fled to the cathedral for
sanctuary, but were forced thence by the king’s
soldiers, who pillaged both city and monastery.
The monks were even compelled to melt down
the costly shrine of St. Wulstan in order to
pay a fine of 300 marks laid upon them “ for
submitting to Louis the Dauphin.”!
While Worcester was being pillaged, King
John was busy in the Eastern counties.
Directly after the Earl of Pembroke again
returned to his allegiance and was taken into
favour by the dying king, whose body he and
Bishop Silvester caused to be brought to
Worcester, and there interred before the high
altar, and between the shrines • of St. Oswald
and St. Wulstan, where it yet remains. In the
reign of Henry VII., an altar tomb was built
around the royal sarcophagus, and the lid of the
coffin, with its sculptured effigy, was placed upon
a marble slab upon the top of the tomb.

t An. Wig. sub anno, ni6. Quoted by Thomas, p. 125, * suppose William, son of William Marshall, to be
the second Earl of Pembroke, who was one of the 25 oarons appointed to enforce the observance of the great
charter. Dr. Thomas states that it was William who declared in favour of the Dauphin.


This monument, the first of the series of English royal effigies, is a fine work of art, and
the best example in England of monumental sculpture at that period; a true and undoubted
authority for royal costume, and a perfect representation of the body as buiied beneath.
The effigy is carved in grey marble, and was richly painted (it is now resplendent with
barbaric gold). The dead king appears to have been a well-built man, with a broad and intelli-
gent face. He wears a golden crown set with jewels, a dalmatic of crimson, lined with green,
the neck and cuffs edged with gold, and the border jewelled ; the tunic is cloth of gold.
The garments are girt about with a jewelled belt ; on the hands are jewelled gloves, a ring
is on the middle finger of the right hand, which supports a sceptre, while the left hand
grasps a sword, the scabbard of which a lion at the king s feet seems to he drawing; the
hose are red, the shoes black, and the spurs golden. At the head of the monument St. Oswald
and St. Wulstan are represented swinging censers.*
When the King’s tomb was opened on July 24, 1754, and again on July 17,
1797, the monarch’s body was found within a stone coffin, dressed exactly as
represented in the effigy, except that the gloves were wanting, and in place
of a crown a monk’s cowl covered the head. Some fragments of embroidery
remained upon the robe. The left arm was bent towards the breast, and the
hand grasped a crumbling sword. This arrangement of the royal corpse agrees
very nearly with the directions for the ceremonies to be observed at royal
funerals, drawn up in the 14th century, and included in the “ Liber Regalis ”
of Abbot Littleton of Westminster. With respect to the “ Monk’s cowl,”
about which many speculations have been made, there is nothing very notice-
able. It is recorded that Robert Lord Berkeley, one of King John’s contem-
poraries, was also buried in the same kind of garment. Perhaps the Abbot
* This description is based upon that given by Fairholt in a paper read before the Archaeological Congress at
Worcester in 1848. In the 18th century there was a tradition that the remains of King John had been interred
in the Lady Chapel, This probably arose from the coffin having been placed there during alterations. In a
report written, probably by Dr. Thomas, in 1754, upon the opening of the royal tomb, it is stated that, after
clearing away the rubbish, and removing one end and a panel at either side, the elm boards covering the
coffin were raised, presenting to the favoured spectators the body of King John, habited so as to be almost an
exact counterpart of the effigy above. The exposure to the atmosphere caused the speedy destruction of
the royal remains, which mouldered to dust before the tomb was closed again. In this manner have many of
the royal tombs been desecrated by inquisitive men with no real sense of veneration.
The bodies of our Norman kings were roughly embalmed, being slashed with knives, and then well salted,
after which they were wraped in ox hides. William the Conqueror, Henry 1., and the Empress Matilda were
thus embalmed. From the 13th century, royal and noble people were embalmed in a better way, being covered
with cere-cloths of waxed linen, which effectually excluded ihe air ("The Tombs of the Kings of England," by
T. C. Wall, iBgr)
The Abbot of Croxton embalmed King John’s remains. There is a story that when the coffin was opened
a great grub was found in the wax used to preserve the body; this grub being secured by an ardent fisher,
and by him used as a bait, attracted one of the largest salmon ever caught in the Severn.

original authorities,” by William Chadwick. Pub. J. Russell Smith, London, 1865.

certain charm attached to its use.

Among other benefits conferred by John upon the county, the grants to
Droitwich and Bromsgrove must not be forgotten. To Droitwich he granted a
charter and farmed the manor to the burgesses; to Bromsgrove he gave a
market every Tuesday, and fairs on Midsummer Day (the feast of the dedica-
tion of the church\ and October the first.

THE HAMLET OF BLAKESHALL, WJLVERLEY, WITH DISTANT VIEW OF ROCK-HOUSES.’
{Photographed March, 1894.)
Gbe (Trusafcer's IReturn,
SSEolberUg, anl)
BOLVERLEY, near Kidderminster, is a place of some interest
and considerable natural beauty; ridges of sandstone reck
intersect the parish, and rise into little peaks, or rounded
and grassy knolls, giving to the landscape a picturesque
The river Stour, passing from Kinver, flows by the
now silent forges at Whittington and Cookley, through green meadows,
bordered by well-wooded hills, to the little village of Wolverley, that lies at
the foot of a steep rock upon which the Parish Church is built. Above the
village, on the one hand, stands Wolverley House; on the other, Wolverley
Court, —two fine old mansions, associated with memories of bygone days.


Jn striking contrast to these large and stately houses are the rock-dwellings
which abound in this district, where the red sandstone is easily worked and
hollowed out into habitations, more or less comfortable, but strangely out of
keeping with modern ideas of house-building. In comparatively few places
in the world are civilized people found still living after the manner of
primitive man
“In hollow holes, like swarms of tiny ants,
In sunless depths of caverns ;
but in the Severn district,
where Worcestershire bor-
ders upon Shropshire and
Staffordshire, the peasants
have lived in caves from
time immemorial down to
the present day.
Wherever a suitable rock
is found, windows and door-
ways are cut in the face
of the cliff; within cave
opens out of cave; chim-
neys ascend through the
solid rock; kitchen, bed
room, store-room, stable, all
are excavated out of the
heart of the red hill; while
fruit-trees and vegetables,
or a tangled mass of grass
and bramble grow overhead.
In one instance a winding
path ascends over the roof
of a lower dwelling to a
cave-house on a higher plat-
form. Elsewhere may be
THREE ROCK-HOUSES, BLAKESHALL, WOLVKRLEY,
seen cottages built against the cliff, the fronts of brick, the inner rooms scooped


out of the rock. Some of these caves are dry and warm; others, owing to
the porous nature of the stone, become very damp in winter, and for this
reason have been abandoned.
Wolverley parish registers record occasional deaths from the falling-in of a
cave roof, and now and then a dangerous mass of rock is purposely dislodged
to prevent accidents.
The most picturesque group of rock-dwellings is to be found at Blakeshall,
a hamlet of Wolverley, in a natural amphitheatre, below the earthworks of an
ancient camp.
Two other groups of rock-houses are close at hand ; one on the opposite hill,
called “Vale’s Rock,” has a date, 1794, carved above the caves; this is not
an indication of the date of the excavation. Another terrace of rock-houses is
situated between Wolverley and Blakeshall, and the gardens belonging to the cave-
dwellers slope down from the platform before the houses to the high road.
In summer, when roses and honeysuckle are in bloom, the bright flowers and
green leaves make a beautiful harmony with the red rock for background.
Primitive though these rock-dwellings may appear, they are, in many respects,
infinitely superior to the small houses in the crowded courts of great cities.
In this village a remarkable legend of the crusades has been preserved as
an oral tradition by the country folk, The hero of the romance is a warrior
of the knightly family of Atwood, a family seated at Wolverley as early as the
reign of Henry 111.
UcQEnb of the liuight of SHolbedej].
Wolverley Court belonged to the Atwoods, one of whom is said to have been
a crusader, and to have tarried so long at the wars, that his lady at home,
supposing her husband had died, was about to marry again.
One morning the milkmaid at the Court went down to the meadow to milk
the cows, taking with her an old dog. The dog ran before the girl, and
presently, by barking, directed her attention to a man, lying asleep upon the
grass—a form, in appearance, more like a wild animal than a human being,—
emaciated, shaggy, and fettered with iron.


She sits in the eastern turret Till behind her dies the sunset,
Of that castle rugged and grey, And darkness the fair view fills
And ever her watch is eastward kept, That she looks across from its English walls,
Jill the long day dies away; To its circling English hills.
The Watch of the Crusades.
Ihe dog appeared to recognise this strange-looking object, fawned upon it,
and continued barking until the girl went back to the Court and told her
mistress what had happened.
Ihe lady listened to the maid's story and returned with her to the place
where the dog still kept guard over the stranger. The man, being now-
awake, greeted the lady as his wife, but she was alarmed and incredulous;
then, in confirmation of his identity, he produced half of a broken ring,
which at parting, unknown to anyone except themselves, the husband and wife


bad broken, each keeping half. The lady found her portion of the ring and
placed it beside that which the man held out to her. The two parts matched, and
thereby was the lady convinced that her long-expected husband had returned.
A smith was sent for, and the knight released from his fetters. Great
was the rejoicing at the return of the wanderer, and eagerly did his friends
and tenants listen to the relation of the crusader's marvellous adventures.
The soldier of the Cross had been taken prisoner, and kept for a long time
in a dungeon, till, one night, as he prayed to be delivered from his miserable
state, an angel, or, as some say, the Virgin Mary appeared and spoke words
of comfort to him ; then he seemed to lose consciousness, till aroused by the
harking ol the dog, when he found himself no longer in prison, hut lying in
the meadow below his own house at Wolverley.
Though in a trance, the knight bad an indistinct remembrance of moving
through space, but being of too humble a heart to imagine that an angel had
been sent to carry him, he declared that a swan had brought him through
the air; he had perceived the feathers around him. For this reason, and as
a memorial of God’s mercy, he caused himself to be pictured in stone on his
three monuments in Worcester Cathedral, Kidderminster Church, and Wolverley
Old Church, with a swan for crest upon his tilting helmet, and the faithful
dog, who alone remembered him as he lay in his chains in “the Knight’s
Meadow,” he had carved in marble at his feet, that the animal’s sagacity
might not be forgotten.
Another circumstance the knight remetnbered also. It seemed to him that
as he descended to the earth he touched with his foot a church steeple;
wherefore he gave the land at Wolverley to Worcester Cathedral.
The Crusader promptly disposed of the rival who sought his wife in marriage,
and then devoted his time to works of charity, bestowing the manor of
Wolverley, with many broad acres, upon the Church.*
* This legend was first narrated to me by a descendant of the Atwood family ; afterwards an old man, Mr.
Thomas Pender, a native of Wolverley, who remembered the legend being told to him by his mother and grand-
mother seventy years ago (/.«■., about 1824), repeated the story to me one evening in July, 1894, while standing
upon the bridge by the Old Forge at Wolverley. “It is a very strange story altogether," 'aid he, “it was a
general belief and common conversation seventy years ago, hut now it is almost forgotten. The man was found
in the meadow below the lock, and it is still called ‘the Knight’s Meadow.’” Upon “The Knight’s Meadow*
there was at one time a rent charge ; the money arising therefrom was paid to someone who should “ keep the
irons polished and show them to all who would like to see them."


At Wolverley Court the iron fetters, said to have been worn by the knight,
are still shown, also the mutilated fragments of an alabaster effigy—relics
removed from the old church many years ago, when it was rebuilt by a
predecessor of the present Sir F. Winn, Knightf Only the head, body, and
feet of the old warrior remain. t Upon the surcoat, the head and claws of a
rampant lion with two tails may still be seen. This is the ancient device of
the Atwood family, and appears emblazoned in stained glass in the staircase
window at Wolverley Court ;— Gules, a lion rampant double queues argent. . Crest;
a swan issuing from a ducal coronetS
Respecting the origin of this legend there appears to be a diversity of opinion.
By some it is said to have been an invention of monks to account for their
possession of certain lands. It is indeed evident that the story has been elabo-
rated and altered in the course of years.
The episode of the faithful dog brings to remembrance Homer’s story of the
return of Ulysses, and can be paralleled in many places, especially where there
happens to be a mediaeval monument with a dog or Hon carved at the feet
of the effigy. The story of the broken ring is an old favourite, appearing in
many forms. The allusion to the swan seems to point to a northern origin,
or may have been invented to account for the Knight’s crest; and the
wanderer’s foot striking a pinnacle in descending may have been borrowed from
an oriental romance. *
Philosophers have almost persuaded themselves that a story told in most
parts of the world cannot by any possibility be true. They argue that history
cannot repeat itself in several wanderers like Ulysses, whose dog alone recognised
t Once while the family were away a fire broke out at Wolverley Court, and the Vicar of Wolverley (the
Rev. C. E. Rowland, M.A.) removed the fetters from the hall to a place of safety. After the fire the fetters
were replaced in the hall,
t Mr. J. Noake, “The Rambler in Worcestershire, ’’ vol. 3, 1554, p. 240, where a version of the legend by Mrs.
Sherwood is referred to,
§ This crest, or one very like it, was borne by the Beauchamps. Thomas Beauchamp, third Earl of Warwick,
is represented upon his great seal, c. 1343, wearing a swan for crest. May not the Atwoods have assumed the
swan crest after their alliance with the Beauchamps y
In reference to this crest, Dr. Thomas remarks (Survey, p. 92), in his description of the monument between
the fifth and sixth pillars of the north aisle of Worcester Cathedral, “All which arms being newly painted,
deceive all understanding beholders, persuading that this was Beauchamp, Baron of Powyke, whereas his crest
under his head, being as ancient as the monument, and the same with Sir John Atwood's, who lieth buried at
Wolverley, doth most plainly declare, that this was John Beauchamp, son of Sir John Beauchamp, of Holt, who
in an office taken after the death of Sir John Atwood, knt., 15 Ric. 11., was found to be his next heir.".
If tradition may be believed, this is in fact Sir John Atwood's monument.


the long absent master, and consequently such tales are false.
On the contrary, most of these legends have an historical foundation—history
having a strange knack of repeating itself, with variations. Of such legends
that which Emerson said of history is applicable—
“ The identity of history is equally intrinsic; the diversity equally obvious. There is at the
sur r ace infinite'variety of things; at the centre there is simplicity and unity of cause.”
It was not unusual for a Crusader, returning from his long toils of war and
pilgrimage, to find that his friends in the old home had given him up for
dead, and that his wife, like another Penelope, was beset by suitors. It was
no unusual thing for a knight, liberated from a long imprisonment, to give a
portion of his lands to the Church as a thank-offering for his deliverance.
Such incidents are likely to have happened repeatedly in England, Germany, and
France during the middle ages.
Sir Walter Scott founded a romance upon a similar legend of the Crusades,
and in the introduction to “ The Betrothed,” notices the tale of “ The Noble
Moringer,” a German legend, closely resembling that of the Knight of
Wolverley. The same story is told of an ancestor of the Earls of Balcarras,
in Scotland, and of Hugh, son of Richard, Lord of Hatton, in Warwick-
shire.* Some of these versions may have been recorded by monks in the
15th or 16th centuries, but it does not follow that the monks invented the
story. The Noble Moringer appears in a manuscript chronicle of 1533, and
Hugh de Hatton is the hero of a romance penned in the 15th century.
According to Dugdale, Sir Hugh held the lordships of Hatton and Wroxall,
under Henry dc Newburgh, Earl of Warwick, soon after the Conquest. A
curious point to be noticed is that Sir Hugh and the Knight of Wolverley
bore the same arms, namely, on a red shield a white lion with two tails.
These were the arms of the Monlforts of Beaudesert, of which family the
Knight of Hatton is thought to have been a member; they were also the arms
borne in the 14th century by the Atwoods, and in the 13th century by Simon
de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, “from whom they (the Atwoods) are descended.”!

It is probable that the Knight of Wolverley, of whom the legend is told,
was Sir John Atwood, founder of a chantry at Trimpley, a hamlet of Wolver-
ley, for whose soul, and for that of his wife, the l«ady Lucie, prayers were
to be continually said at St, Mary’s Chantry. ;, ,
The effigy at Wolverley Court may possibly represent this old warrior, who
died in 1392, and was buried in Wolverley Church. A monument, if report
can be relied upon, was also erected to his memory in Worcester Cathedral,
between the sth and 6th pillar of the north aisle of the nave. After his
return from the Holy Land, Sir John Atwood is believed to have taken
monastic vows, to have become Prior of Worcester, Abbot of Evesham, and
Bishop Elect of Worcester. He certainly founded the Chantry at Trimpley, of
which nothing now remains.*
* Like many of their knightly neighbours, the Atwoods were known by various names: in Norman French,
du Bois; in Latin, de Bosco; in English, Atte Wode, Attwood, Atwood, and Boys. They were, there is
little doubt, a branch of a noble Norman house, but partly owing to the multiplicity of their names their history
is difficult to trace.
From various sources I have been able to glean the following facts relative to this family;— ,
. . . . L)e Bois, a monk of Worcester, 1212 (Nash).
Laukentius de Bosco. or du Bois, of Trimpley.
Robert de Bosco, living 1327, had the wardship and marriage of John de Beauchamp, son and heir of
Richard de Beauchamp, of Holt (Burton).
Lucia de Bois, of Wolverley, married Thomas de Littleton, of Coulsdon, c. 1300.
John Attwood (Boys), had license to celebrate divine service in his private chapels at Wode Acton, Wol-
vardle, and Trympeleye, for a year, Jan. 19th, 1357 (Burton).
Sir John Atwood, founder of Trimpley Chantry, 1370 —his wife’s name was(?) the Lady Lucie. In 1381,
Sir John Atwood, brother of Lady Beauchamp, was the patron of Trimpley Chantry (Nash), and again in
1385. Sir John was buried at Wolverley, in 1392, and John Beauchamp, son of Sir John Beauchamp,
of Holt, was the next heir (Burton). This Sir John is supposed to have been the Crusader.
John Atwood, Esq., patron of the Chantry, 1450.
John Attwood of Wolverley, living 1501, benefactor of Bordesley Abbey, 1535.
Samuel Atwood of Wolverley, trustee of Sebright's Charity, i6tB, refused knighthood, 1630. From 1630 to
the present day, the pedigree is almost complete. Although the elder branch became extinct, descendants ot
the family are still living.
John de Evesham (? de Bosco), 5.T.8., was presented, with six other monks, by the convent at Worcester,
April aist : approved the next day by the Bishop. He died, March 17th, 1370, and was buried in the nave
of the Cathedral. He was elected, but not consecrated, Bishop.
William de Boys, who was a monk of Evesham, succeeded Abbot Chyryton as Abbot of that house. He
was, according to Nash, of the ancient family of Attwood of Wolverley. Elected on the calends of January at
Avignon by Pope Clement VL, and nstalled at Evesham on the day of Pentecost, 1344. (May’s “History of
Evesham," p. 118).
If these dates are correct, John de Evesham, who died in 1370, may have been the Crusader, and Sir John
Atwood, who died in 1392, his son. Some day additional facts may be discovered, and the mystery, which
surrounds the identity of the old knight, for ever dispelled.

XFORD was astir with a new intellectual activity;
the lecture rooms of Edmund Rich and
IJmOk. Robert Grosseteste were thronged with ardent
Ills IBBf ; the Dominican and Franciscan Friars,
Wm by their preaching and lecturing, were en-
deavouring to arouse a fresh veneration for
religion ; Roger Bacon was busy with his ex-
periments in science ; Duns Scotus and Ocham were the
living representatives of Scholasticism ; the thirst for
knowledge, the passionate devotion to religion spreading
among people of all ranks of society, caused youths from
near and distant counties to seek in Oxford the instruction
for which they longed.
Attracted by this magnetic influence, two boys left their
homes in Droitwich, and travelling to Oxford, enrolled
themselves among the students of that famous university.
One of those boys was destined to become Prior of the
Monastery at Selborne; the other, Bishop of Chichester
and a Saint, whese festival is to this day observed in both Roman and English
churches.


Richard de la Wyche, or de Burford, was the son of Richard and Alice dc
Wyche; he had an elder brother, and a sister. From infancy, Richard had
manifested a dislike to gay diversions, and at Oxford he associated with youths
as poor as himself, and almost as enthusiastic in their devotion to religion and
learning.

When Richard had completed his course at
Oxford he returned to Droitwich. Probably his
father was then dead, for his brother had suc-
ceeded to the small patrimony. Being careless,
or dissolute, the elder brother had involved him-
self in difficulties, and the young Oxford student
took upon himself the management of the estate,
working as his brother’s bailiff till the prosperity
of the family was restored. But, while tilling
the land or grafting fruit trees, Richard’s thoughts
were busy with higher things, and having put
his home in order he set out for the University
of Paris, where he hoped to acquire knowledge
to enable him to work in a larger field than
that owned by his brother in Worcestershire.
At Paris he shared his room with his Worcester-
shire friend, John, and another companion. These
poor students possessed so small a stock of clothes
that when one went to a lecture the others stayed
at home, having but a single ' warm tunic and a
gown between them.
From Paris Richard returned to Oxford, and, having taken his master’s degree,
travelled to Italy in order to perfect his studies in canon law; begging his
way, most likely, as was then the custom of poor scholars. At the University
of Bologna he gained a professorship, but after spending a few years there he
again betook himself to Oxford {a.d. 1235). The fame of his learning and
piety had gone before, and he was well received by his former teacher, Edmund
Rich, then the primate, and by Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, both


invited Richard to become their chancellor; he accepted Archbishop Edmund’s
offer and remained faithful to his friend and master, even to the end of his
bitter exile.*
After the death of his patron, Richard took shelter in a Dominican Friary
at Orleans, where be studied theology and was ordained priest. He was next

the diocese of Canterbury, but, in 1245, he was elected
Bishop of Chichester in opposition to a nominee of
King Henry 111. The King, being enraged at this
disregard of bis authority, confiscated the revenues of
the see. Richard proceeded to Lyons, where he
met the Pope and obtained a confirmation of the
appointment and was consecrated. Then returning to
England he became a homeless wanderer in his own
diocese, travelling across the woods and downs of Sussex
in the performance of his episcopal duties. Simon,
the priest of Tarring, offered Bishop Richard hospi-
tality in his vicarage. At Tarring, in the intervals
of his journeys, Richard employed himself with planting,
pruning, and grafting fruit trees, an art in which he
had excelled in the days of his youth passed amongst
the orchards of Worcestershire.! That the Bishop was
grateful to his friend Simon is proved by the follow-
ing extract from his will: —I

st. Andrew’s church, droitwich.
The Bishop’s administration of his diocese was marked by various reforms
and especially by a new set of statutes which he drew up with the aid of his
Chapter. One of Richard’s biographers has recorded that :
“The severity with which he enforced ecclesiastical discipline was as great as his tenderness
towards the suffering and needy. ”
In 1253 Bishop Richard undertook to preach on behalf of a Crusade, and
for that purpose commenced a journey along the south coast, but as he drew


near Dover, where he was to consecrate a church in honour of his former
master, now a canonised primate (St. Edmund Rich), bodily infirmities prevailed
over his spiritual strength, and he fell sick and died,
When the body was being prepared for burial, those who were present saw
with amazement that the Bishop had worn next his skin a horse-hair shirt,
clasped about with iron bands to increase the weight and discomfort.
Reverently were the remains of the enthusiast carried back to Chichester and
there buried before an altar which he had himself dedicated to St. Edmund.
It was soon reported that miracles had been wrought at the Bishop’s tomb.
In less than nine years a deputation of ecclesiastics, carrying a letter from
Prince Edward (afterwards Edward I.) went to Rome to report the circum-
stances to Pope Urban IV., who on January 22nd, 1262, at Viterbo, declared
Richard to be duly numbered with the saints. This business cost the Church
a small sum in comparison with the value of the offerings made to
the shrine of the new saint. On June i6th, 1272, the body w r as removed
from the grave, placed in a silver-gilt chest, and with great pomp enshrined,
Kinf Edward and all his court being present.
St. Richard’s day is still celebrated on the 3rd of April—a “ blackdetter day ”
in the Prayer Book Calendar, but both he and his work have almost passed from
remembrance.* Few there are who know that Droitwich had any connection
with this excellent example of a mediaeval saint. The people of Droitwich,
however, long held his memory in veneration, on account of some benefits
which he conferred upon them, and in Leland we read :
“ The salt springs did fayle in the time of Richard de la Wich, or Burford, Bishop of
Chichester; and afterwards, by his intercession, it was restored to the profit of the oukl course ;
such is the superstition of the people. In token whereof, or for the honour that the Wiche-
men and saulters hear unto this Richard, their countrieman, they used of late tyraes on his daye
to hang about the sault springe, or well, once a year with tapestrie, and to have drinking,
games, and revels at it,”f
* In the Cloy Almanacs St. Richard's day is distinguished by a sign representing a ploughshare; and in
Callot's “ Images,” he is following a plough, in allusion to his early life in Worcestershire. St. Richard has
also been represented holding a chalice. A story is told that after he became bishop he fell down with the
chalice in his hand, but the wine was miraculously preserved from being spilled. (See The Calendar of the
Prayer Book. Parker, iSjo.) In the Catholic Church of St. Hubert and St. Richard at Hadsor, in the east
window, there is a figure of the local saint to whom this church is dedicated.
f Leland, quoted by J, Chambers, " Biographical Illustrations, 1 ’ 1820, p. 25.


Habington, commenting upon this custom, while allowing that the town
of Droitwich, being the birthplace of the saint, may have something to do
with the institution of the ceremonies, is persuaded that “ this feaste begun
first for some benefit bestowed on these springs, because the chiefest showe of
this solemnity is at the salt wells.”
In the Lansdown MSS., p. 231, Aubrey comments on this old practice of
well decking :
“This customs is yearly observed at Droitwich, in Worcestershire, where, on the day of
St. Richard, they keep holy-clay, and dresse the wells with greene boughs and flowers, One
yeare, in the Presbyterian time, it was discontinued in the civil warres, and after that the
springe shranke up, or dried up for some lime ; so afterwards they revived their annual
custome, notwithstanding the power of the Parliament and soldiers, and the salt water
returned again, and still continues. This St. Richard was a person of great estate in these
parts, and a briske younge fellow that would ride oyer hedge and ditch, and at length
became a very devout man, and after his decease was canonized for a saint.”
From these quotations it is clear that the cult of St. Richard was not
neglected by the people of Droitwich. In St. Andrew’s Church, to the north
of the chancel, there is a chapel dedicated' to St. Richard, and upon the
capitals of the tower piers adjoining it, grotesque’heads and, foliage, exquisitely
carved, have fortunately-escaped the hands ■ of iconoclasts, though the fittings of
the chapel have long ago been destroyed. From the architectural style of parts
of the churches of St. Andrew, Droitwich, and St. Michael, Stoke Prior, it
is evident that considerable additions rvere made to these buildings, between
the years 1220 and 1250, by an architect of great ability; the towers especially
having several features in common. There is no doubt but that the whole of
this work was done during St. Richard’s lifetime, and probably at the bidding
of Bishop William de Blois.
While St. Richard w T as attending to the affairs of the church in the south
of England the See of Worcester w'as held by one of the foremost ecclesiastics
of the time, Walter de Cantilupe, the friend and adviser of Simon de. Montfort.
When civil war could no longer be avoided this great feudal-prelate openly
joined the Barons and commenced to fortify his manor house at Hartlebury.
After the battle of Evesham Bishop Cantilupe retired to Blockley. Being very
ill and under the ban of excommunication he desired to make his peace with

st. Michael’s church, stoke prior.*
* By the kind permission of the Vicar of Stoke Prior I have examined this most interesting church, now
being repaired at the expense of John Corbett, Esq,, of Impney. On the north side of the chancel there is a
small vaulted chamber, on Norman foundations, but re constructed in the 13th century. Over this chamber is
another, probably, at one time, the abode of a recluse. Some human hones and fragments of carved alabaster
were found beneath the floor ( of this little room, and upon the south wall, partly hidden by the vaulting of
the chamber below, a small piece of Norman fresco-painting, apparently the decoration of a semi-circular
window-head, was uncovered. The colours, red and yellow on a white ground, were quite brilliant.


RUINS OF THE REFECTORY, (?) HAT.ES-OWEN ABBEY.
{Engraved from a draa/iig made by the Sate Mr. H. H. Lines in ISI7-)
Ibalcs^weit
N a valley south-east of Hales-Owen, upon a slight eminence,
sheltered on all sides by higher ground, but so situated that
glimpses of distant country can be seen between the hills,
stand the tall ruins of the only Premonstratensian monastery
in Worcestershire.
Without doubt the monks chose a fertile and most beautiful
place; they were attracted by the presence of running water, so necessary for
their mills and fish-ponds, no less than for protection in those lawless times.*
Prom the Abbey gate-house the white-robed canons of Hales looked out across
a moat upon the neighbouring town. Westward, through an opening in the
trees, the dark headland of Clent could be seen; and, southward, at the end
* The river Stour rises in two main tranches—one near Wolverhampton, the other from several springs on
the north-east side of Clent Hills. These latter brooks run through Hales-Owen Abbey pools and form the
Stour—a river working more water-mills than any other stream of its size in England. Another tributary rises
on the soulh side of Clent Hills passes through Telbroughton and joins the Stour near its confluence with the
Severn,


of a valley, whose green sides sloped to the still waters of the Abbey pools,
the long, bare ridge of Bromsgrove Lickey bounded the prospect; while, towards
the south-east, the tree-capped knoll of Frankley rose above the pastures. Upon
the east and north, high ground protected the monastery from rough and
chilling winds. In this favoured valley, King John founded an ideal abbey.
The early history of the monastery may be briefly told. When William the
Conqueror gave “Ilala” to his kinsman, Roger, Earl of Shrewsbury, the Earl
caused it to be included within his own county, though it lay in ’Worcester-
shire fully twelve miles distant from Shropshire. The Manor remained a detached
part of Shropshire till the present century, but the parish has always included
parts of Worcestershire.
In the year 1102 the Earl of Shrewsbury’s estates were confiscated, and among
them the manor of Hales, which, in 1177, was given by Henry 11. to his
brother-in-law, David ap Owen, Prince of Wales, husband of Princess Emma.*'
Their son Owen, probably, became lord of Hales in 1204,+ and the place has
ever since borne the name of this Welsh prince. X At the present time the
picturesque little town with its ancient houses clustering around the venerable
church upon the verge of a ravine, in appearance at least, belongs more to
Wales than Worcestershire.
Upon the death of Prince Owen, the manor again passed to the crown, and
in October 1215, King John granted it to Peter des Roches, Bishop of Win-
chester, “ for the building of a religious house of whatsoever order he shall
think fit.” || The Bishop’s choice fell upon the reformed Augustinians, called,
from their original home in Picardy, the Canons of Premonstre, and familiarly
known as White Canons, from the colour of the habit they wore. This order
of monks was founded by St. Norbert of Cleves in 1120, and, according to
tradition, an angel pointed out the site of their first monastery in the forest of Couchy,

I Dr. Lyttelton slates that the earliest reference to Hales as " Hales-Owen " occurs in the Manor Court Roll,
56, Henry iii. (1172}. Probably it was so called to distinguish it from Hayles in Gloucestershire, but the
derivation of Owen from Olwin, the name of the Saxon tenant, is as absurd as the etymological guessing of
F. Edmunds, “Traces of History in the Names of Places," p. 187, “Hales Owen,” equivalent to “ Halla’s
Own,” (See J. R. Holliday's paper, p. 50), and that of W. Harris, “History of Halesowen,’’ p. 4, who supposes,
without a shadow of evidence, that the first Abbot was named Owen.
|| Original Charter among Lord Cobham's evidences at Hagley.


The White Canons came to England in 1143, settled at Newhouse in Lin-
colnshire, and thence sent out branches to Alnewye, St. Agatha, Welbeck,
Burlings, Welford, and Croxton. King John favoured the order, and confirmed
his grant of the manor of Hales to them,* It was the Premonstratensian
Abbot of Croxton who attended John in his last illness, embalmed his heart,
and bore it to his own monastery on the moors of Staffordshire.
In 1218, a little band of monks from Welbeck arrived at Hales-Owen to
take possession of their newly acquired land. The building of a monastery was
not the labour of a few months, it usually extended over many years, each
generation of monks taking pleasure in improving and beautifying the buildings.
The conventual church at Hales, however, remained at the Dissolution in
much the same state as the builders left it in the 13th century, for, although
there were additions of chapels and various embellishments, the massive fragments
of outer avails still standing prove that the church, as at first planned, was a large
and imposing building, with immense lancet windows, groined roof, and lofty aisles.
That which was done was well done. There was no stint of money from
the royal coffers.t The monastic buildings had arisen at the bidding of the
royal founder and his son, but when Henry 111. died the royal patronage
ceased, and it was left for succeeding abbots and neighbouring barons to orna-
ment the walls with fresco and brigbt-hued tapestry, to fill the tall windows
with storied glass, and to pave the floor with tiles upon which the romance
of Tristram, and the story of Richard Cceur de Leon appeared side by side
with the arms of benefactors, and the sacred symbols of religion.
The original endowments consisted of the manor of Hales, including houses
in the town, and the advowson of the church, with its chapels of St. Kenelm
and Frankley. Very soon the tithes of these churches were appropriated to the
monastery, as in later times were the tithes of Walsall, Wednesbury, and Clent. +
Clent church came into the monks’ possession in the time of Bishop Wulstan
de Bransford (i337'49)> and the petition then presented gives interesting details. II
* Translations of this and the Charter of 1215, both at Hagley, are printed In “The History of Hales-
Owen," hy William Harris, and in Latin, Nash, vol. t, p. 510.
t In an Inquisition (Hundred Rolls, 2 Ed. i.) it is stated that Henry 111. confirmed his father's gift, "and
Jirst built ike now existing house.” This statement is supported by a series of entries in the Pipe Rolls, from
i2tq to 1245, recording payments made hy the bishop of Winchester, towards the completion of the building.

Owing to the situation of the abbey near a public road, the monks were obliged
to exercise great hospitality. The petition refers to the slender means to support
this expense, the monastery having lately suffered great loss by the accidental
burning of many houses in the borough of Hales, and also to the coldness of
the people's devotion to the head of St. Barbara, the olferings to which in
former times had brought much money to the treasury.
Unless there had been mismanagement, it is hard to see why the Abbey
should have been poor, but it must not be forgotten that the great hospitality
was a constant expense to the house. At a visitation, held in 1489, when the
number of canons amounted to seventeen, of whom four were resident at
distant churches, it is recorded that the weekly consumption of wheat and rye
for bread was 20 bushels, that in one year, 1110 quarters of barley, 60 oxen,
40 sheep, 30 swine, and 24 calves were consumed.*
Matthew Paris states that at the death of Peter des Roches great treasure
came to the Abbey of Hales from the Bishop who had been instrumental in
founding • that house. And in an inventory, taken on the death of Abbot
Bruges in 1505, we read of
“vessils, basyns, ewers, and great chargers of silver/’
beside salts, bowls, standing cups, and goblets all of silver, processional crosses
of silver gilt,
“ a schryne of St. Barbara’s hede of sylver and gylt, with crosses and bedds upon it,” &c. &c.
The Abbey had assisted Edward I. with men-at-arms in his first war against
Wales, yet at the Assizes of 1392, the Charter of King John was produced to
prove that the house was exempt from this service of sergeanty.t
The Manor of Hales included five subordinate manors, Cradley,
(Salop), Romsley, Ludley, and Oldbury; and the townships of Hasbury, Haun,
Cakemore, Hill, Warley, Ridgacre, Lappall, and Illey, all owing suit and service
at the Abbot's Court of Hales-owen. The monastery was actually the Manor
House, a name it still retains.

half, and Azya de Asebury, his tenant, holds half a one. “In the last war the Abbot had withdrawn the
aforesaid service,” said Hugh de Leather, who prosecuted for the King, The jury, however, held that the
Abbot was free of that service, and so was his tenant Azya.


CARVED STONE COFFIN LID OF AN
ABBOT, OR CANON OF HALF.S.
{Found among the ruins of Hates-Owen Abbey ,
and now placed in the old (?) infirmary of the
Abbey.}
Edward I. granted one of the Abbots
license to fortify his house, and although
the battlemented walls are gone, the wide
moat, still partly filled, proves that the
Abbey was well defended ; but there is no
record of it having been used as a fortress.
Some of the early abbots sat in Parliament,
from 1294 to 1314, as the writs still extant
prove, yet there is no account of their
doings there. The Newspaper Press and the
gallery--reporter had then not arisen.
Except a few fragments of massive masonry,
some weather worn carved stones, some ancient
charters, a chartulary, and sundry scattered
references in the national records, little is
left wherewith to reconstruct the history of
the vanished Abbey. Would that the whole
story of this Abbey could be told) the
romance of many successions of white-robed
monks, who here sought shelter from tur-
moil of the outer world, knelt in silent
prayer within the stately church, or paced
the terrace walk beside the moat.
We are able, however, from some legal
inquisitions and Assize Rolls to catch a
glimpse of the monks and of their dealings
with their tenants and neighbours. The
abbot ruled the manor as well as the
monastery ; every man on the estate worked
for him at stated times, and no man died,
or gave his daughter in marriage without
the lord, the abbot, taking his accustomed
fee. At that period payment in service


was being changed into a money payment, and the abbot and his tenants
had a long fight over this matter.
From an inquisition taken in 1276, in the time of Abbot . Nicholas, it appears that the
tenants of the manor held, by the payment of 4od, yearly for every yardland, and by suit of
court at Hales, from three weeks to three weeks, and if in court anyone made default, he
was to forfeit 6d., and after judgment given, 12d.
On the decease of every tenant, the best beast, except a mare, was due for a heriot. Also
the lord claimed half the goats, hogs, and bees, and horse-colts.
Upon coming into possession of his lands the heir paid two year’s rent as “a relief,” at the
rate of half a mark for a virgatc, or yardland, and 4od. for half-a-yardland, and so on.
All the tenants were obliged to plough the demesne lands six days yearly for a whole yawl-
land, and three days for half-a-yardland, and to sow the corn and oats ten days yearly for a
yardland, and five for half-a-yardland, and one day besides freely for which they were wont
to have a repast at the manor house.
They were also to mow the lord’s grass, and to fence his garden at Hales when necessary.
Because there was no mill on the manor in King John’s days, tenants might grind their
corn where they pleased.
If any of the tenants married their daughters out of the manor they paid the lord 25., but
if within the manor 12s.
These were the ancient services of the manor when King John held it, and he granted it. to
the monks, subject to the same services.*
A decision in favour of tbe monks was then given, but in 1327 the con-
tention was finally adjusted ; the abbot agreeing to accept a yearly sum of
money in lieu of the old predial services.
The Assize Rolls for 1272 and 1292, throw some light upon affairs at Hales-
Oweu, and it must be confessed that the conduct of tbe monks and of their
tenants was not always creditable. The reports of visitations made by superiors
of the Order at a later date give no very pleasing picture of the internal life
and discipline of this secluded monastery.! At the Assize of 1292, the Abbot
had to appear in no less than seven cases connected with his house.
The Manor of “ Hales Oweyn ” came by twelve jurors before the king’s justices
itinerant at Shrewsbury in 1272, and the first case presented was as follows : —t
Thomas de Overeston and Henry de Noueton, servants of the Abbot of Hales, were together
in a certain mill belonging to the Abbot, and a dispute arising between them, Thomas struck
Henry with a certain hatchet on the head, from which blow on the morrow he died, and Thomas

immediately fled, and was suspected. Therefore was demanded and outlawed. He had no chattels.
The Manor came not to the inquest. Therefore it is in mercy, and the twelve jurors falsely
presented this plaint and, therefore, are in mercy.
By the accidental death of Joan de Wermesley, a Worcestershire lady, who
was killed by the overturning of her cart in a wood in the Manor of Hales-
Ovven, the church gained the value of the cart and the six oxen which drew
it, as deodand.* Another case throws further light upon the ancient custom
of deodand. Thomas de Waleshale fell from a cart without the vill of Hales
so that he died. The verdict, “accidental death,” was given, and the value
of the cart and two horses which drew it was presented at eight shillings, of
which the Abbot of Hales received half and the Coroner of Worcester the other
half, because the accident happened on the boundaries of the counties of
Worcester and Salop.
The dangerous state of the county is show r n by the fact that, in 1273 certain
“unknown malefactors” came to the os-stall of Philip de Wilinghurst, and wounded
Henry his son, causing his death. Men seem to have been commonly armed
with swords and axes, and even the Abbot’s immediate dependants used these
weapons murderously. One day at the Abbot’s grange at Farleigh, Philip de
la Hulle quarrelled with John de Brokgrave and smote him on the head with
a sword so that he died. Philip fled and was outlawed.
On another occasion, Brother Henry de Brokton, a Canon of Hales, and
some other people took Thomas de Hasebury, a free man, and led him to
the house of the Abbot’s beadle, and there detained him against his will for
two days. The reason for this detention is not' stated.
Before the Justices Itinerant at Shrewsbury, in the 20th year of the reign
of Edward I. (1292), came some thirty or forty men, whose names stand
recorded in the Assize Roll.
Among this rabble were John Hoch of Dudley, Thomas Lench, called shoemaker ; John, the
smith of Clent \ Thomas, the chaplain of Dudley; Simon, the priest of Clent ; Nicholas de
Shykernoke, Thomas in the Spelstou, Adam Snowe, William Atte Wall, all of whom were
assembled at Ilalylcy (? Ilagley), and a contest arising between John Hoch and John le New
of the Ahbot of Hales, John Hoch shot John le Kew with three arrows, whereby on the fourth
day he died.
* Deodand \deo dandum\ Anciently, whatever was the immediate cause of the death of any reasonable
creature was forfeited, and the price given to the church that prayers might be said for the soul of the person
killed. In more recent times the deodand was given to the king to be applied to pious uses. A Deodand must
be presented in court by a jury of iz men, and its value staled.


Then John Iloch fieri, and being demanded was outlawed. Thomas de Lench and all the
others likewise fled, and were followed by the county, the hue being raised, and the Sheriff
commanded to take Thomas de Lench and his companions. The vills of Hampstede and
Rommesley came not fully to the inquest and were therefore in mercy. Afterwards Thomas
de Lench and some of his companions came and defended themselves, and the jury acquitted
them, but because they were present and did not seize the said John Hoch they were in
mercy, so they paid a fine of 405., and each for the other were pledges. The others who
came not, though not suspected were in mercy. *
The next case vividly brings before us the lawlessness of the times, a robbery
is committed at one of the Abbey granges ; the robbers are caught by a monk
and the Abbot’s bailiff, who accept a bribe, and allow the malefactor to escape;
fearing the consequences, the monk turns robber, escapes, and is outlawed.
The jury present that Thomas de Blakeleye and Robert his brother broke into the grange of
the Abbot of Hales in the night lime, and stole one quarter of oats valued at i6d.
The thieves were afterwards taken by the Abbot’s bailiff and Brother William Ic Ihmte,
canon of the Abbot. 'lhomas Walreven, the bailiff {who afterwards died) took from the
robbers 305., and permitted them to escape, but they were captured and hanged.
Therefore the Sheriff was commanded to take William le Hunts,
Then came the Abbot of Hales saying that William le Hunte, his canon, had fled from his
house, and had stolen and carried away goods and chattels from the monastery to the value of
he had not returned. Wherefore the Abbot prayed that he might not be called to
answer for any trespass done by his canon before the said canon had been convicted upon the
said trespass.
The Sheriff testified that William le Hunte was not found, and hath withdrawn himself, and
was suspected. He was thereupon demanded and outlawed. He had no chattels.
It would seem that the monks were not very popular in the neighbourhood,
possibly because they tried to restrain some of their more reckless neighbours,
exacted services, and acted the part of police somewhat too rigorously.
It was presented that William Petit, “who is dead and came not,” Robert Beley, and
Brother William dc Shereburn (a convert), servants of the Abbot of Hales, took Roger Ketcl
of Illeleye, and imprisoned him and put him in the slocks, and in such way detained him for a
day and a night, that within a month following he died. Also the said Robert and William
beat and ill treated Alice, the wife of John Yediylh of Kakemor, so that she and the twins
which she bore, died within a month.
Then came the Abbot of Hales 'and Brother William before the court pleading the privilege
of most holy church, and placing themselves for good and bad upon the county.

John te Kew was not the Abbot of Hales, as stated by -Mr. Newton-WoodwaixUllall (“ The Art Student,”

Kcwe


The jury said that in truth William Petit, Robert le Beley, and Brother William took Roger
Ketel and two other villains of the Abbot, who were disobedient and rebellious, and put them
in the stocks, but Robert Xetel died a natural death, and not by reason of illtreatment, and
as to the beating of Alice, Robert and William never did beat her or molest her in any way.
Therefore they were acquitted.
In their agricultural operations lire monks, like all reformers, met with
opposition. Wastes had to be ploughed up, fields fenced, and watercourses
confined to proper limits. These innovations were naturally viewed with dis-
approval by the public, who ventilated their grievances at the Assizes.
When the Abbot caused the king’s high-way to be ploughed up at Port-
marchclde toward Ocitheford to the length of a furlong, and in breadth thirty
feet, and when he included in his park in the Manor of Hales fifty feet of
another public road, he was cited before the court for obstruction. The
obstruction was acknowledged, but, said the Abbot, the way was useless and
deep; it lay on his own proper soil, and he had made a new road, straighter
and more to the advantage of the county. The Abbot’s testimony was
strengthened by that of William do Hugcford, Robert Corbet, Adam de
Brampton, and others.
The court allowed the Abbot’s plea. He might go without day, but was in
mercy because he had done this thing without license.
Leaving 'these old and musty law proceedings we turn to a more pleasing
phase of monastic life. ’Hie Abbey owned various outlying farms, which were
cultivated with assiduous care, and to this day bear traces of the handiwork of
monks who knew so well where to choose sunny and sheltered dwelling-places.
There were at least ten of these granges, or demesne farms, belonging to the
Abbey, as well as several cells, or smaller religious houses, over which the
Abbot exercised control. The granges at War ley, Hill, Owley, Farley, Whilley,
Uffmore, Rudhall, Blakeley, and New Grange, lay in the parish of Hales-Owen.
Then, in addition, the Abbey owned lands in many other parishes even so
far away as the Tenches, where they had reclaimed forty acres of forest-land,
given them by Warin de Upton and Hawise, his wife.
It seems to have been customary for the monks to cultivate most of their
farms themselves; others were of course let to tenants, a practice which
became more general as time went on. One of the pleasantest of the Abbey

pensing true English hospitality. Sir Hugh was elected first member of

Parliament which the Abbots, who possessed Warley, had formed nearly six
centuries before. Sir Hugh also restored the name “ Abbeyto Warley, and
revived the knightly order which its tenants had not possessed since the
Fokerhams left it in the 14th century, and which was conferred upon him in
1893 by the Queen,
There are many gaps in the historic records of the place, but it is clear-
that the Barons of Dudley were anciently lords thereof.
Robert de Somerie in 1292 died seized of the Manor of Wernlegh, in the county of Worcester,
then held by William de Fokeiham by the service of one knight’s fee, valued at £6 17s. Bd.
per annum—( A 7 ash). ,


The Fokerhams held Warley in 1308, for in that year Sir William Foker-
ham inherited from his father —
“The Manor of Wernlegh with all his lands and tenements in Wernlegh, Ruggacre, Cakemore,
Langley, and Wallaxhall, with the chantry of Beendhall, belonging to the chapel of St. Katherine.”*
K ORTH FI ELD CHURCH.
(The Pound and “Great Stone” in the foreground.)
* The Chapel of St. Katherine at the east end of the north aisle of Hales-Owen Parish Church is generally
called the Warley Chancel.


The “ superiority ” of Warley was still held by the lords of Dudley. In
1321 the last of the Someries died, and his lands being divided between his
two sisters, Margaret, the wife of John de Sutton, had for her share Dudley
Castle, many Staffordshire Manors, and the town of Dudley; while her sister
Joan, the wife of John de Botetort, had the other moiety of the estates,
including the Manors of Northfield and Warley. Weoley Castle, in Northfield,
became the chief seat of the Botetorts, and from that time the Fokerhams
disappear from Warley; some of their lands were sold to John Lyttleton, of
the Frankley family, and Richard, son of Sir William Fokerham, resided
principally at Stockton-on-Teme. Of this knight we know little beyond the fact
that his arms were, or. a bend engrailed sable , and that he was probably
related to a Berkshire family of the same name.*
The next important event in the history of Warley was the granting of a
license in Mortmain, in 1328, to enable Joan Botetort to bestow the Manor
of “Wervclcyc” upon the Abbot and convent of Hales-Owen. Twenty shillings
of the rents arising from the Manor were to be distributed to the poor every
year at the Abbey gate. In return for this bounty prayers were for ever to
be said for the health of the soul of the Lady Joan.f
When the Canons owned an outlying manor like Warley, they usually built
a little chapel near their grange, for, while attending to temporal affairs, they
seldom forgot their religious duties. The existence of a chapel at Warley
Grange is proved by an entry in an old rent roll of Hales-Owen Abbey, A.D.
1490, from which it appears that the chapel was dedicated to St. Michael, and
adjoined “ Warley Grange.” J
Although all outward signs of ecclesiastical buildings have disappeared, the
Monks’ Chapel at Warley is still commemorated in the name “ Chapel Field,”
and the site of the ancient grange in the “ Moat Field,” both in the upper
portion of Warley Park.
* The old manor house of the Fokerhams is assumed, by Dr. Nash, to have been situated near the farm,
now called Brandhall, and in his time foundations of ancient buildings were occasionally met with in ploughing
the “Chapel croft.” In the “ Lyltleton Charters," recently printed, are many references to the Fokerhams,
commencing with Richard, temp. Henry HI., who had a son Sir William, 1304, who had four sons, Richard,
John, Reginald, and Thomas living, 1332. There was another, Roger, living c. 1380.
f Sir John Botetort, Baron of Weoley, was buried before the high altar of Hales-Owen Abbey Church, He
bequeathed his plate and jewels to adorn the altars of the church.

At Warley there are still traditions of subterranean passages the monks
liked good drainage, and constructed their underground waterways high and
wide enough for a man to walk down; of a ghost—the grey lady of Warlev—
the restless spirit of a murdered heiress, whose shadowy form is still believed
to wander betimes in the park, embodying, perhaps a lingering remembrance of
one of those white canons, to whom the grange formerly belonged. Be that
as it may, ghostly traditions are common in many parts of Worcestershire,
and the spectral form is usually called the w T hite or the grey lady.
In old days, Warley was held upon kitchen tenure, i.e., by a payment to
the king’s kitchen. The hereditary privilege extended to the owners, being the
right of hawking and fowling from Warley to the gates of Shrewsbury on con-
dition of supplying pheasants and wooden platters for the king’s table.
In the 15th century there is evidence that the tenant of Warley paid the
Abbot 435. and 4d. rent, and from another entry in the Abbey rent roll—
Item. —Recpt., pro Herbagio de Chapel Field apud Wernley vendit xs.—
it appears that the herbage of the chapel field at least w r as sold by the monks
themselves.
The freehold of Warley has, for over a century-and-a-half, been held by the
Galtons, who were early' bankers in Birmingham, and whose name—from the days
of the famous Mary Galton (1778 to 1856) down to Sir Douglas Galton,
K.C.8., LL.D. —has been honourably distinguished in art, science and literature.
The Warley Galtons were members of the Society of Friends, but after the
Oxford movement they joined the Catholic Church. The late owner was Miss
Jane Galton, who, in 1894, attained her 81st year. The present owners are
Captain and Mr. Hoivard Galton.
Still later in the history of the Abbey, the Old Austin Priory of Dodford,
near Bromsgrove, which, previous to 1464, had become so reduced that only
one canon resided there, was given to Hales-Owen Abbey, and, like Tichfield
and Tullum, became a cell to the larger house. Some interesting remains of
this old priory are incorporated in the farmhouse at Dodford, where, in the
kitchen, the tiles arranged in the form of a cross upon the floor, the huge open
chimney, and the massive walls appear to be quite as old as the 15th century.
At Dodford the monks had a water-mill, which probably adjoined the Priory.


The hast act in the history of Hales-Owen Abbey is its dissolution in 1538,
when it was granted to Sir John Dudley, afterwards Earl of Warwick and Duke of
Northumberland. The Duke granted a lease of a part of the estates, including
the monastery, to George Tuckey, in consideration of his good and faithful service.

late unfortunate husband had conveyed the manors to Edward Blount and
George Willoughby, recovered the estates, Ambrose Dudley, her son, inherited
part of the property by bequest, another part went to her daughter Katherine,
and another to her executors—Sir Henry Sidney and Sir George Blount, John
Somerville, and Mannow (? Marrow). After the attainder of Ambrose Dudley,
the estates were escheated to the Crown, and then regranted to the executors
mentioned above.
In 1555, Sir Robert Dudley, Queen Elizabeth’s celebrated favourite, was in
possession, and then alienated the estates to Thomas Blount and George Tuckey,


esquires, who granted them in various lots on leases of one thousand years to
several purchasers. These Blount and Tuckey leases are still in force. The
Manor of Hales-Owen was sold to John Littelton of Frankley, whose descendant,
Lord Cobham, still holds it.
The speedy demolition of the Abbey is evident from the following entries in
the Hales-Owen churchwardens’ accounts for 1539 : —*

For three centuries the Abbey had endured; for three centuries the monks
had worked, not always blamelessly, perhaps, but in the main well. They and
their work are forgotten ; their names have perished with them, but truth is
eternal, and, so far as those monks worked truly and well their work is
eternal.

HT-» misguided by foreign favourites, oppressed his people,

not wanting; Simon de ■ Montfort, Earl of Leicester, became
the foremost man in the realm. Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, and
Walter de Cantilupe, bishop of Worcester, were the wisest of Earl Simon’s
advisers.
Early in the year 1263, the Earl of Leicester, acting as head of the Barons’
faction, entered into an alliance with the discontented Welsh, and took possession
of the chief passages across the Severn.* Worcester, true to her traditions,
was loyal to King Henry, so the city was besieged and taken by Robert, Earl
Ferrers, who was supported by Peter de Montfort of Beaudesert, and Richard
de Montfort, one of the Earl of Leicester’s sons.t Owing to the Bishop’s in-
fluence, the Cathedral was not plundered, but the city was sacked, and the
Jews and some Christians also slaughtered. t
* Bishop Creighton, Life of Simon de Montfort, p. i 3 S.
t Dr. Thomas, An Account, &c., p. 133,'quoting Ann. Wig,, sub. 1263. But Matthew of Westminster states
that the Barons entered Worcester without any opposition or barrier, although the King had sent a letter to the
citizens commanding them to keep the city safely. The sacking of the city and the fact that Prince Edward after-
wards made it his headquarters support the statement of the local annalist.
I In 1218. Henry 111. wrote from Oxford to the Sheriff of Worcester commanding that all Jews there, whensoever
they walked or rode within or without the city of Worcester, should have affixed to their upper garments, on the
breast, two white marks (tabulas), made of cloth, parchment, &c., as a sign to distinguish them from Christians.
The slaughter of the Jews during these civil wars was very fearful.


A few days later, King Henry 111. wrote to his Chancellor, Walter de Merton,
and Bishop Cantilupe, commanding them to come to him to consider the terms
of peace proposed by the Barons. A meeting was held at Bracldey, near
Oxford, but the terms were refused, and both parties prepared for war.
On the Sussex Downs, above the town of Lewes, King Henry sustained a
defeat and was taken prisoner on May 14th, 1264. Then for twelve months
Earl Simon, acting as dictator, ruled in the king’s name, till at length it be-
came impossible for English nobles to submit to this enforced regency, and an
appeal to arms could be avoided no longer.
William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, Earl Warenne, and a large company
of knights, landed in Wales on May 10th, 1265. The young Earl of Glouces-
ter, Gilbert de Clare, had already taken up a position in the Forest of Dean,
and many discontented barons were flocking to him. Earl Simon, taking with
him the King and the two Princes, set out from London for the Marches of
Wales, travelling by way of Northampton, Winchcomb and Gloucester. On May
13th he reached Hereford.
On the 28th of May Prince Edward, under pretence of trying the paces of
a horse, which had just been given to him, rode out of the city of Hereford,
attended by Robert de Ros, Thomas de Clare,' Henry de Montfort, and a
small guard. The afternoon was spent in racing with his attendants, till the
horses were thoroughly tired, when, as evening approached, Prince Edward dis-
mounted, and leaping upon a fleet horse which had been kept fresh for him
meanwhile, galloped away.
“Good day, my lords,” he cried, “and tell my father I shall soon see him
out of ward.”
Two knights, with four shield-bearers, who were in the plot, followed the
Prince towards a thicket. Suddenly a troop of horse-men, emerging from the
thicket, closed round the fugitives, and the party rode away northward. Pursuit
was hopeless. The leader of the troop, Roger Mortimer, conducted Prince
Edward to his castle of Wigmore, and Henry de Montfort returned to
Hereford to tell the tidings to his father.
The escape of Prince Edward gave the Royalists a great advantage over
Earl Simon; their efforts at concerted action were unavailing so long as the old


King and his sons were prisoners, but with Prince Edward at their head they
gained a leader whom they could obey, and their cause assumed an appearance
of lawful resistance against a usurping noble.
In a proclamation issued in the king’s name and dated at Hereford, May
30th, 1265, a brief account of the landing of the Earl of Pembroke and of
the Prince’s escape is given • barons and knights, with horses, arms, and all
their men, are cited to meet the King at Worcester forthwith, to help him
against the rebels.*
On the 7th of June a similar proclamation was made, ordering the arrest of all
rebels, and summoning the levy to meet the King at Gloucester, not at Worcester,
because the bridge there was broken down, and the way difficultt On the
following day the King was made to address a letter to the Bishop of London,
desiring him to excommunicate the advisers of the Prince and all who had led
him to disregard his oath. X The tone of these proclamations and letters verges
upon despair.
Meanwhile Prince Edward was at Ludlow, where the Earl of Gloucester and
Earl Warenne, with their troops, joined him. He was made to promise to
uphold the old institutions of the country, and not to admit foreigners to
office.il From Ludlow the Royalists removed to Worcester.
Earl Simon sent to secure Bristol, but he was too late. All the cities and
towns from the mouth of the Severn to Shrewsbury were held by the Royalists ;
Gloucester, Worcester, Bridgnorth, Shrewsbury and Chester had declared for the
Prince. All the boats on the Severn were secured, and the fords guarded.
Thus was Earl Simon hemmed in by his enemies and cut off from communi-
cation with his friends.
In this extremity a hasty treaty was made with Llewelyn, Prince of Wales,
who in return for certain concessions agreed to aid the Earl with a military
force.§ In the following week de Montfort had marched to Monmouth (June
28th) and then to Newport, where he tried to cross the Bristol Channel, but
was prevented by the Royalists’ ships.

From Monmouth he sent urgent letters to his son Simon and other friends
to come to his aid. Those friends, however, were dilatory, or not prepared;
the younger Simon seems never to have realised the need of promptitude.
When the letter reached him he was besieging Pevensey and guarding the

across the Malvern Hills and through the Chase and so avoided the direct road
to Worcester, which was guarded. He arrived opposite Kempsey, four miles below
Worcester, on a Sunday evening, and, crossing the river, lodged at the Bishop’s
manor house while his troops were being brought across in boats. Probably
Kempsey was the only place along the Severn not secured by the Royalists,
and it was doubtless owing to the advice of Walter de Cantilupe that the
passage of the Severn was made there. Bishop Walter had come from his Grange
at Blockley to meet Earl Simon, he was with him at Evesham on the follow-
ing day, and remained with him till the battle began.
On Monday, Simon and the king reached Evesham, probably by way of
Pershorc ; they had marched twelve miles from Kempsey when the monks
of Evesham came to meet them, and offered the hospitality of their house.
Simon, impatient to join his son, wished to continue the march, but King Henry
was weary, and having of late lived on the rough food of the Welsh mountains,
desired to dine at the Abbey table, Doubtless there was design in the delay.
While de Montfort and King Henry were enjoying their dinner at Evesham,
Sir Simon the younger had left Kenilworth and reached Alcestcr.
“And would not budge thence before he had dined.
Those two dinners doleful were, alas 1
For many were the good men thereby slain,”
sings Robert of Gloucester, who thus describes the energetic movements of
Prince Edward.
“ Sir Edward and his army were at Worcester then,
And they hail trusty spies who told them of Sir Simon’s carelessness.
So that Sit Edward, and the. Earl of Gloucester also,
And Sir Roger de Mortimer, and many more good knights beside,
On a Lammas night—Saturday night it was—
Out of Worcester went, with right good pace ;
To Kenilworth they came in the dawning;
They brought Sir Suuon and his men ill-tidings.
In bed they found him, when they entered the town ;
Of soft awakening they took little heed.
To well clothe them they gave them no time,
Of their foes they slew many, and of chief men they took some,
♦ * * *
But Sir Simon himself, among all his enemies,
Hardly escaped naked into the castle.”
2 33
THE BATTLE OF EVESHAM.


Nevertheless, Sir Simon lost not all his power, but so many horses were
captured that the very foot boys of the Prince’s army were provided with the
steeds of knights. The Prince did not stay at Kenilworth, or possibly his
triumph might have been turned into a defeat. He carried off his booty and
prisoners to Gloucester (?) and then returned to take Earl Simon by surprise.
In ignorance of what had happened, Earl Simon remained that night at
Evesham Abbey, Early in the morning of August 4th, when Bishop Canti-
lupe had said mass in the Abbey Church, the Earl prepared to continue the
march; and waited only for the king to finish breakfast before giving the
order to advance.
Meanwhile, Nicholas, the Earl’s barber, famous for his skill in heraldry, had
ascended the Abbey bell tower to reconnoitre.
Evesham lies on a promontory, surrounded on three sides by the Avon;
on the fourth, northwards, rises the higher ground, now called Green Hill.
Down the slope of this hill the Alcester road descends towards the town, and
by that road it was hoped Sir Simon was approaching. In the grey light of
the morning distant objects could not be distinguished clearly, till suddenly a
gleam of sunlight revealed the glittering armour of ranks of horsemen drawn up
upon the brow of the hill, Nicholas told the Earl what he had seen, and
added that he thought he spied the banners of his friends.
“It is my son,” de Montfort said, “fear not, but view them carefully, lest we be inter-
cepted.”
Nicholas looked again and saw the banner of Prince Edward behind those
taken at Kenilworth which at first had been displayed.
“We are all dead men,” cried Nicholas, “ for it is not your son, as you supposed, but the
King’s son on one side, the Earl of Gloucester on the other, and Roger Mortimer on the
third.”*
Simon de Montfort was intercepted. The Prince’s troops blocked the nor-
thern road, and prevented the junction of de Montfort’s army with his son’s
reinforcements. Roger Mortimer had crossed the river and seized the bridges,
so that retreat was cut off. ■
The advance of Edward’s army called Earl Simon to the front. He saw

how skilfully the troops were disposed and touched by soldierly pride he ex-
claimed :
“By the arm of St. James they come on in wise fashion, but it was from me that they
leamt that order. Now let us commend our souls to God, for our bodies are our enemies.”
Then drawing together his little army he gave to everyone leave to depart,
entreating Hugh Despenser, Ralph Bassett and other lords to escape, and so
save themselves for better days. They all refused to leave him. His son
Henry begged him to flee and leave him to fight the battle.
“Far be it from me, ray son,” said the Earl. “I have grown old in wars, and my life
hastens to an end. There is something in my blood which tells me my forefathers never fled
nor wished to flee from battle. Do you, my son, retire, lest you perish in the flower of
youth. You, who are to succeed me (God grant it), and succeed to our race, illustrious in the
glories of war.” “No,” said Sir Henry, “If you die I have no wish to live,”
THE BATTLEFIELD, EVESHAM.
(Shewing the Abbey Manor, lately destroyed by fire.)
Then these English heroes prepared to meet death while fighting for English
liberties.
The two armies were now drawn out in order of battle, Prince Edward’s
host occupying the higher ground, with the villages of Norton and Lenchwick
behind, and the river on either flank. Earl Simon’s force was stationed in the
fields without the town,


While these preparations were being made the sky had become darkly overcast
and the distant rumbling of thunder presaged a storm. Suddenly the wind
arose, the rain descended, and a vivid flash of lightning was followed by terrific
thunder, crash succeeding crash, as the storm swept over the Vale of Evesham.
To the terrified spectators it seemed as if a battle were being waged in the
heavens, and by the English people generally the storm and the shock of an
earthquake accompanying it were taken as direful omens.
The tempest continued till two in the afternoon, and until that hour the
armies remained inactive. Prince Edward’s men were the first to advance,
charging down hill to the loud sound of trumpets. The Barons gathered together
in a close body that they might offer the most desperate resistance. Six
thousand Welsh foot soldiers, forming a large part of de Montfort’s army,
fled before the impetuous charge of the royalists, and seeking shelter in the
fields and gardens, many were butchered like sheep, some were drowned in
crossing the Avon, and the remainder escaping to Tewkesbury, were slain as
they passed through the streets.
But Earl Simon and his knights stood firm; time after time were the
Prince’s soldiers driven back; time after time did their leaders rally them and
renew the charge.
Earl Simon “fought stoutly like a giant for the liberties of England.” His
son Henry was wounded, his cousin Peter dc Montfort, and his friends Ralph
Basset and Hugh Despenser were slain beside him. Fighting desperately one
by one the little baud of knights around the earl fell, till he was left alone.
He had nearly reached the hill-top when a lance thrust brought his horse to
the ground. Still fighting, wielding his sword with both hands, and dealing
mighty blows on every side as his foes closed around him, he heard their
cries, “Yield! yield!”
“Never will I surrender to dogs and perjurers; but to God alone,” was
Simon s answer. At last, being mortally wounded by a blow from behind, he
fell amid a crowd of assailants. “It is God’s grace” were the last words
spoken by the Patriot as his head sank upon the grass of the hill side above
the Avon.
Henry de Montfort, though wounded, still continued fighting, but it was not


long before he fell, and his brother Guy, weakened by wounds, was taken
prisoner. Darkness alone put an end to the slaughter which continued till
nine that night. So fierce was the contest that contemporary writers speak of
it as a massacre; Robert of Gloucester terms it “the murder of Evesham, for
battle none it was.” One hundred and sixty knights, many noble youths, and
four thousand men of the Barons’ army were slain,* Sir Hugh Despenser, the
Chief Justice of England; Sir William de Mandeville, Sir Ralph Basset, Sir
John de Beauchamp,t Sir William de Valence, Sir William Devereux, Sir
William de Bermingham, and Sir Henry and Sir Peter de Montfort, died on
the field. King Henry, clad in plain armour so that he could not be distin-
guished, wandered about the fields, till at length, being struck by a soldier,
his visor fell and he exclaimed “ I am Henry of Winchester,” whereupon he
was joyfully rescued by his son.
Prince Edward was present when his friend and cousin Henry de Montfort
was buried by the side of his brave companion Hugh Despenser before the
high altar of the Abbey Church. But Earl Simon’s body was dishonoured by
his barbarous foes; dismembered and mutilated, the head and hands were sent
as a trophy to Lady Mortimer at Wigraore, The legend runs that the
messenger on his arrival at Wigmore Castle found the lady attending mass at
the neighbouring Abbey ; he entered the Church, and as he told Lady
Mortimer the news, the priest was elevating the host. At that solemn moment,
the hands of Earl Simon were seen to clasp themselves in prayer above the
messenger’s head, though they were afterwards found in the bag sewn up as
before. Lady Mortimer was so alarmed at this occurrence that she sent back
the hands to Evesham.];
The monks of Evesham gathered the other remains together and buried them
in their church; De Montfort’s tomb soon became celebrated for the miracles
wrought there; a list of 212 cures effected at the tomb is extant; pilgrims

lor the de Montforts Henry had no mercy; their only hope of safety was
in flight. The Countess of Leicester was no longer treated by the king as a
sister, but as the wife of a rebellious baron. Hope of resistance there was
none, so the Countess with her daughter, the Lady Eleazror de Montfort, set
out for France, where King Lewis received her kindly; she survived her
husband ten years, and died in 1275. Her sons, Henry, Simon, and Richard

were then dead, Guy was in his cell doing penance for the murder of Prince
Henry of Alemain, Amaury, the youngest, alone remained at liberty, her only
daughter, the Lady Eleanor, was the affianced bride of Llewelyn Prince of
Wales.
The romantic story of this unfortunate Princess well illustrates the import-
ance of Worcester as a frontier city before the subjugation of Wales.
When Earl Simon was at the height of his power Llewelyn had been his ■
guest at Kenilworth Castle.* Earl and Prince had much in common ; the one
desiring to give to the English people freedom and good government, the other
to bind the Welsh people together into a power strong enough to resist any'
attack from without; each relied upon the other’s help.
At Kenilworth Llewelyn met the Lady Eleanor, and found pleasure in her
company, till admiration ripening into love, the Prince proposed to marry
her. Though they had now waited for ten years, and Eleanor was no
longer the daughter of the greatest nobleman in ‘ England, but poor, fatherless,
and an exile, Llewelyn was still ready to fulfil his promise. Shortly before her
death the old Countess had given her consent to the match and the marriage
had been performed by proxy early in 1275, then Llewelyn sent an escort of
Welsh knights to conduct his bride to Wales.
Early in 1276, Eleanor and her brother Amaury embarked with their escort,
but the vessel in which they sailed was captured by four ships from Bristol
and the lady and her brother sent prisoners to Windsor.
Edward I. had succeeded his father in 1273, and in 1276 his relations with
Llewelyn were strained. He paid his first visit to Worcester in that year and
again demanded the homage of the Welsh Prince; for two years Llewelyn had
refused to perform his homage. The king appears to have hoped to bring
his proud vassal to submission by retaining his bride. It was in vain that
Llewelyn demanded the lady’s restitution, offered large sums of money to the
king for her ransom, and besought the Pope to interfere; but he refused
Edward’s terms, comprising unconditional homage, the restitution of lands, and
the rebuilding of castles which he had destroyed.. In his wrath he complained

bitterly of the wrong and insult done to him in a time of peace, and at
length, it is said, he prepared for war, and making a raid upon the English
border, burned several towns and killed the people.
This was King Edward’s opportunity; he had long been intriguing with
Llewelyn’s subjects and corrupting the Welsh chiefs with bribes and promises.
Gathering a large army the king departed from Westminster after Easter, 1277
and appears to have gone to Worcester; for all who held land of the king in
'chief, or owed him service, were summoned to Worcester on the feast of St.
John the Baptist (Midsummer Day), with horses and arms. Roger Mortimer
was appointed captain of the expedition.
With wonderful rapidity the English army marched into North Wales.
English ships blockaded every port, and Llewelyn, driven into the fastnesses of
Snowdon, was starved into submission. On the 10th of November, Edward
dictated his hard terms at Rhuddlan Castle, but nearly a year elapsed before
he performed his promise of releasing the Lady Eleanor. Returning, in December,
from his Welsh campaign, the king spent nine days in Worcester, sending
thence “ a safe conduct ” to Llewelyn to enable him to come to London,
doubtless, that he might meet his bride. But the marriage was still delayed,
and did not take place till October, 1278, when Edward, with the King of
Scotland, spent four days in Worcester, and Eleanor and Llewelyn were married
at the door of the Cathedral, amid great rejoicings, on the 13th of the month.
The Kings of England and Scotland, the Earl of Leicester and a great
gathering of nobles witnessed the ceremony, though many doubted the policy
of the match.*
On the following day the bride and bridegroom departed from ’Worcester
joyfully, and so passed to their own country, Alas ! their troubles were by no
means over ; it was ominous that while the , marriage bells were ringing the
King had urged Llewelyn, with flattery, to subscribe a charter of extradition.
Llewelyn signed it “ smitten by the fear which may overcome a steadfast man.”t
“The Princess of Wales and Lady of Snowdon,” as Eleanor then called her-
self in her letters, seems to have tried to keep up friendly relations between

her husband and her cousin, King Edward I. In 12S1 she paid a visit to
Windsor, but did not succeed in preventing a renewal of the war.
On the night of Palm Sunday, 1282, David, Llewelyn’s brother, surprised
and took Harwardine Castle, in Flintshire, then held by the English ; a
general insurrection ensued and Llewelyn, like a second Caratacus, made a
last effort to free his land from the invader.

In haste King Edward came to Worcester, seven days he
tarried in the City making preparations for the expedition,
three days he spent at Hartlehury Castle, where the lordly
prelate, Godfrey Giffard, was his host. From Worcester the
King sent letters to the bishops and many of the abbots
commanding them to help him with men and arms. From
Hartlehury similar letters were sent to all the lay lords and
magnates of the realm to meet the King at Rhuddlan.*
Llewelyn held the mountain district of Snowdon with the
stubbornness of despair, and inflicted a heavy loss upon the
English at the passage of the Menai Strait. But he had to
contend against one stronger than himself; brave, active, and
strenuous though he was, his opponent was equally vigorous,
and had greater resources at command. Llewelyn was better
able,to conceive than to carry out an elaborate policy,f
Through the autumn and winter Edward kept his army in
the field, terrible though their sufferings were; he also levied
new troops with the intention of attacking the enemy in the rear.
Llewelyn advanced to meet the invading force, and had reached the Valley
of the Wye near Builth, when his guard was surprised by Edmund Mortimer,
and as he was hurrying forward to direct the skirmish, without waiting to put
on his armour, Adam de Frankton, one of Mortimer’s men, slew him.
Llewelyn’s head was at once sent to the King, who ordered it to be taken
to London, after being exhibited at Anglesea. The Londoners received it with

the sound , of trumpets and cornets, crowned it with a silver crown .and carried
it through the streets. In the evening it was crowned with a wreath of ivy
and placed upon a lofty pole over the gate of the Tower of London.
The Lady of Snowdon had died in giving birth to her only child, on June
19th, 1282. The child, the Lady Guenciliana, was afterwards brought to King
Edward, who caused her to be immured in the convent at Sempringham, where
she died a nun in 1337.
Wales having been subdued and some appearance of order restored, Edward
returned to Worcester on the 22nd of March, 1289.* He was received by
the Bishop and Chapter in solemn procession. On the morrow, having
heard the Mass of St. Wulstan, he proceeded to “Humeiton” (? Himbleton)
and dined ; he lay that night at Fcckenham, where an enquiry was made con-
cerning those who had transgressed in hunting in the forest. Many people were
imprisoned, and the Bishop and Prior of Worcester were fined, the one 500
marks, the other 200 marks, for the sport they had had in hunting the King’s
deer. In this manner did the iron-handed Edward deal with his subjects.
Godfrey Giffard (a.d. 1268-1302), one of the most lordly prelates that ever presided over the
See of Worcester, came of a noble family, and maintained the state of a great feudal baron.
He completed the fortifications at Hartlebury Castle which Cantdupc had begun, and Nicholas
of Ely had continued. He fortified his palaces at Worcester and Wydindon in Gloucestershire,
and built large houses at Wick and Kempsey. When travelling on visitations, or to confirm or
to administer justice, he rode escorted by a retinue of at least a hundred horsemen. His passion for
the chase led him to incur the King’s displeasure and reproof for hunting in the royal forest of
Feckenham, adjoining his favourite manor of Alvcchurch. His Idve of splendour reaching beyond
this life prompted him to plan for himself a stalely sepulchre.
Striking though the contrast was between the asceticism of earlier bishops, and the magnifi-
cence of Cantilupe and Giffard, the baronial bishops were nevertheless useful in their day, but
after Edward I. reorganized Parliament the need of ecclesiastical statesmen existed no longer.
“The State,” says Bishop Creighton, “began to train its own officials, and the people had
a means of obtaining some sort of redress for their wrongs.”
* Edward I. was a frequent visitor at Worcester and a great benefactor to the church on account of his
veneration for St. Wulstan. Before starting upon an expedition to France in 3333, he sent his clerk with a
royal offering to the blessed Wulstan, to wit, a chain of gold, aud two golden cloths for the high altar; and
on that day the Chapter ordered that every week three masses of St. Wulstan should be said till the King
returned again in safety. On the Ist September, 1294, the King came hither late, hut he heard verses made
in praise of St. Wulstan, and on the morrow, after mass, offered at the Saint’s shrine four gold buttons and
six marks. It is recorded that he sometimes came by water, at others he passed through the forests, doubtless
for the purpose of hunting. Once, while kneeling at St, Wulstan’s tomb, he vowed,to maintain three monks
and two lights there “as a reward to blessed Wulstan for all that he hath done for me by his prayers.”
(Dr. Thomas, “An Account,” etc., p. 151.)


The luxurious magnificence of bishops continued lili the 16th century, though much of their
power had been taken from them. Giffard seems to have been an able man, and to have
helped the people of his diocese. He beautified the cathedral, and in 1282 laid the first stone
of a pavement for the streets of Worcester, at a time when pavements were almost unknown
in English towns. But his proud spirit kept him constantly in trouble. To obtain money to
meet his great expenses he fined offenders heavily. He quarrelled with Archbishop Beckham,
and with the monks of his own monastery. He disputed with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of
Gloucester, about hunting rights in Malvern Chase, and is said to have left his mark upon
Malvern Hills, where “the Earl of Gloucester’s ditch,” still shows its rugged hanks and
furrow's upon the side of the Worcestershire Beacon. lie withstood the all-powerful Beauchamps
when they claimed privileges in the Hundred of Oswald slow.
TOME OF CROSS-LEGGED KNIGHT, ALVECIIUECH CHURCH.
lii Giffard’s time the men of Worcester began to take a more active part in the management
of civic affairs. Henry 111, had granted a charter to the town. Bridges were built across
the Severn and the Teme; trade became prosperous, and lines of pack-horses frequented the
“ salt-ways,” which passed through Droitwich in several directions ; barges plied along the
Severn ; salt, fruit, tvoollen goods, and, possibly, fish were the staple commodities of the county ;
Robert of Gloucester, who wrote in the 13th century, says:—
“In the county of Canterbury most fisb U,
And most chase of wild beasts about Salisbury I wis,
At London ships most, and wine at Winchester;
At Hartford, sheep and oxe; and fruit at Worcester."


The frequent wars with Wales adder! no little to the danger of the roads. The evil deeds
of <l certain malefactors unknown,” or of other lawless men whose names were known, figure
conspicuously in the Assize rolls of the period. In the Worcester Assize roll of 1275, among
many other cases there is one relating to Franldey, a parish not far from - the Bishop’s manor
house at Alvechurch. It appears that certain unknown malefactors came in the night to the
house of William Lumbard, chaplain of Frankley, and, breaking in, killed the chaplain, and
fled. Because the townships of Frankley, Cofton, Northfiehl, and Norton, made not pursuit
after them they were "in mercy.”
John Wawe and Ralph Smith were accused, but the jury acquitted them, saying that Thomas
Cole, and Robert his brother, were guilty, and were beheaded. "Therefore, it should he
enquired of their chattels upon Oswaldslow. Their chattels were presented upon Oswaldslow.”
Also the Sheriff was ordered to take Thomas de Offraore, accused of the death of William
Lumbard, and he took him not, and it having been witnessed that he was wandering in the
town of Worcester, "therefore to judgment of him.”
In 1292, there was fighting in the cathedral itself between two rival processions. Blood was
shed so that the cathedral had to be "reconciled,” i.e., cleansed with solemn ceremonies.
Bishop Giffard is said to have died at Alvechurch ; he was buried in Worcester Cathedral.

JM eve the ploughman.
“Ac On a May mornyng’ on Malvern bulks,
Me byfel for to slope' for werynesse of wandrying.”
■NE May morning, a poet lay down upon a sunny bank by
a brook side. Before him stretched an immense verdant
plain, bounded by distant hills, and dappled with the shadows
of fleecy clouds sailing across a dear sky. He listened to
the singing of birds, and the murmuring brook, until lulled to
sleep, and then he saw a vision, mystic and prophetic : a fair
meadow peopled with
All manner of men' the meene and the riche,
Wcrkynge and wandrynge' as the world asketh.
Ploughmen labouring, merchants seeking to thrive in business, minstrels getting
gold for their glee, friars and jugglers going about among the motley crowd of
pilgrims to the shrine of Truth. Their guide is neither clerk nor priest, but
honest Piers the ploughman, who admonishes all to do right, act justly, and
labour industriously. The rich man must not deal harshly with the poor, nor
must the poor cease to labour. Justice and industry are the key-notes of the
ploughman’s sermon.
The place where the dreamer dreamed is Malvern, and the dreamer himself
is Wille Longland, the only English poet of the 13th century, whose mystic
visions made a perceptible impress upon the history of the times in which he
lived. His poem is an allegory and a protest against the corruptions of
medieval society. He sees Corruption—the “ Lady Mede ” brought to trial—
and the world repentant at the preaching of Reason.


The vision soon became popular with the common people, and passages from
the wisdom of the Ploughman were used as texts by the leaders of the peasant
revolt.
Little is certainly known concerning the life of the poet. He is not men-
tioned by any contemporary writer. Bale states that his name was Robert
Longland, * and that he was bom at Cleobury Mortimer. The date of his
birth is fixed at about 1331. It is believed that he received his education at
Malvern Priory. Four times in the visions Malvern is mentioned by name.
The place must have been very dear to Longland; he loved the hills, and
the mist; he found in the Priory seclusion, and “ books to rede and to
learne.”
It has even been suggested that he was elected Prior.i He passed to the
university, and in time became a secular priest; married, not very happily it is
to be feared.
“ And aslceth leve and lycence’ al Londun to dwelle,
To singe ther for simonye" for selver is swete.”
He has portrayed himself at this period as a great gaunt figure, dressed in
sombre garments. He is sad and miserable, makes no new friends, but writes
and re-writes his visions. What is the end of this weary soul? Wc know not;
although there are some grounds for believing that he left London, where he
had led a life so troubled, and returned to the Worcestershiie hills and the
scenes associated with the happier memories of his youth.
*ln the poem, the author is always addressed ,'as “Wille." A line in one of the Visions contains a suc-
cession of words, which put together in reverse order, give the name Wille Longland :— 11 I have lyved on ionde ,
quoth I ; my name is Long Wille.’'

r I) were not ie case * n Worcestershire, a county noted of
Ifl \ for ts woodlands.
Four great forests were included within the shire, but
although much of the forest county was thickly wooded, it
was not entirely covered with trees. By the 13th century many thousand acres
had been reclaimed and cultivated ; still, for judicial purposes, this land lay
within the royal forest, and was subject to special laws. There were, however,
arge tracts of primaeval wood, and to this day Worcestershire retains the
reputation of being one of the most beautiful and sylvan counties in England.
Feckenham Forest occupied the district around Droitwich, extending from the
Foregate of Worcester on the south to Bromsgrove on the north ; from the
river Stour on the west, to the town of Feckenham on the east. Henry 11.


greatly enlarged the ancient boundaries, adding many manors, villages, and
hamlets thereto, but in the 14th century these added places were disafforested—
by which is meant, not the cutting down of trees, but the freeing of the district
from very harsh forest laws,
Ombersley Forest comprised the county between Feckenham Forest and the
rivers Severn and Stour.
Horewell Forest commenced at the south gate of Worcester, reached to
Throckmorton on the east, and to a point near Tewkesbury on the south,
thence along the east hank of the Severn back again to Worcester,
Malvern Chase extended from the river Teme on the north to Corse Forest
on the south; and from the Severn on the east to the top of Malvern Hill
on the west.
Forests belonging to other counties impinged upon the margin of this shire.
Wyre Forest, though chiefly in Shropshire, extended down the Severn to Eewdley;
Kinver Forest skirted the Staffordshire border near Stourbridge; Corse Forest
approached the boundaries of Malvern Chase, on the Gloucestershire side;
and the great Warwickshire Arden stretched along the eastern boundary of our
county.
Here and there remnants of these forests remain, where they have been pro-
tected by the enclosure of a park; but in some places not enclosed, notably
at Dodderhill Common, between Stoke Prior and Hanbury, the ancient forest
trees in all their grandeur may still be seen; monarch oaks and towering
beeches, spreading their long branches protectingly above a green and tangled
growth of under-wood and fern.
Of old lime many mighty hunters chased the stag or wild boar in the
Worcestershire forests; of some of these hunters we have authentic records,
though of others nothing beyond vague and shadowy tradition remains.
For instance, it is known that the border family of Corbet, settled in Wor-
cestershire and in Shropshire since the Conquest and still represented in this
county, were famous hunters. One of these gave his name to Chaddesley
Corbett, and another settled at Impney near Droitwich in the heart of the
forest. In 1281, Edward I. gave permission to Peter Corbet to hunt wolves
in all forests, parks, and other places in the counties of Worcester, Gloucester,

and Salop. Somewhat later, license was granted to William Corbet to hunt
foxes and hares in the great cover of Feckenham.
Queen Philippa, in the 14th century, granted the custody of Feckenham
manor, forest, and park to John Atte Wode, probably one of the Wolverlcy family
of that name.
Callow, the hunter, on the other hand, is a more mythical person than the
Corbets, or John Atte Wode. He has, however, left his name in Upper and
Lower Callow fields in Bromsgrove; in Callow's Leap, a precipice near
Bridge’s Stone, Alfric; in Hither and Further Callow Field, and Callow’s Piece,
in Martley; in Callow Lane, Stoke Prior j and Callow’s grave, near Tenbury.
Harry-ca-nab, said by old folk to have been the Devil’s huntsman at Hales-
Owen, is little more than a spectre. He and his master used to ride on wild
bulls, and hunt wild boars on Bromsgrove Hills, according to tradition.*
Robin Hood, bold outlaw and popular hero, received as much veneration as a
saint, and his memory is preserved in many local place, names. In Chaddcslcy
Corbett there is a field called Robin Hood’s Oak, where an aged oak formerly
stood, and at Monk’s-Path Street, on the borders of Yardley, a modern
mansion preserves the name of an ancient cottage called Robin Hood, where
the outlaw is supposed to have been hospitably received when hunting in the
surrounding woods.t Robin Hood’s Day (May 1) was observed by the country
people till the 17th century. Once when Bishop Latimer was riding from
London into Worcestershire, he wished to preach at a village on the way, but
finding the church door fast locked, had to tarry there half-an-hour and more.
At last the key was found, and one of the parishioners came, saying :
“ Sir, this is a busy day with us, we cannot hear you ; it is Robin Hood’s day. The
parish are gone about to gather for Robin Hood. I pray you let (hinder) them not.”
“I thought my rochet should have been regarded,” the Bishop said, “though I were not;
but it would not serve, it was fain to give place to Robin Hood's men.”|
With the ballads about Robin Hood, Worcestershire has no connection.
In the neighbourhood of Bromsgrove, however, a legend is current about Sir

Humphrey Stafford of Grafton killing a wonderful wild boar, which lived in
an enchanted castle, and destroyed all who passed that way. The legend runs
that Sir Humphrey released from enchantment and the power of the boar a lady,
whom he afterwards married, and that as an act of piety he built Bromsgrove
Church, in which he was afterwards burled, and founded an abbey near it.*
This legend appears to be connected with the ballad of Sir Ryalas, the Jovial
Hunter of Bromsgrove, which the natives of the forest district used to sing,
eighty or a hundred years ago.t
Two versions of the Bromsgrove ballad are given by Mr. Allies in his book
upon the “Antiquities and Folk-lore of Worcestershire.” The less ancient of
the two commences as follows :
Sir Robert Bolton had three sons—
Wind well thy horn, good hunter !
And one of them was called Sir Ryalas,
For he was a jovial hunter.
A variation of this is given by Mr. Maund of Bromsgrove, who substitutes
“ Sir Rackabello ” (PBellocampo, t.e. Beauchamp) for “ Sir Robert Bolton.” The
older version mentions no names, and commences in the first person :
As I went up one brook, one brook—■
Well wind the horn, good hunter !
.1 saw a fair maiden sit on a tree top,
As thou art the jovial hunter.
1 said, fair maiden, what brings you here ?
Well wind the horn, good hunter !
It is the wiki boar that has drove me here,
As thou art the jovial hunter.
Tire hunter answered that he wished he could see that wild boar. The
lady told him to well wind his horn, and the boar would soon appear. Putting
Iris horn to his mouth, he blew cast, west, north, and south, so that the wild
boar heard the blast. Whetting his tusks, and crashing through the oak and
ash as he came along, the boar presented himself before the jovial hunter.
*W, A. Cotton, “ Bromsgrove Church, ’’ p. 68. The latter part of the story referring to the founding of an
abbey probably arose from the founding of the Stafford Chantry.
t J. Allies, “Antiquities,” pp, 314-123.


T hey fought live hours one long summer's day—
Well wind the horn, good hunter !
1 ill the wild hoar he yell’d, and he’d fain run away,
And away from the jovial hunter.
Oh ! then he cut his head clean off!
Well wind the horn, good hunter !
1 hen there came an old lady running out of the wood,
Saying, you have killed my pretty, my pretty spotted pig,
As thou art the jovial hunter.
Then at him this old lady, she did go—
Well wind the horn, good hunter !
. And he dove her from the top of her head to her toe,
As lie was the jovial hunter.
In Bromsgrove churchyard this old lady lies—
Well wind the horn, good hunter !
And the face of the boar’s head there is drawn by,
That was killed by the jovial hunter.
In the other version, the wild woman attacks Sir Ryalas after he has sheathed
his sword. “ She thought in her heart she had torn hint through,”
Then Sir Ryalas draw’d his broad-sword again—
Wind w r ell thy horn, good hunter !
And he fairly split her head in twain,
For he was a jovial hunter.
The ballad ends as follows :
In Bromsgrove Church they both do lie—
Wind well thy horn, good hunter !
There the wild boar’s head is pictur’d by
Sir Ryalas, the jovial hunter.
It is a question whether the ballad, in the form in which it has descended
to us, was not suggested by the crest of the Stafford family—a boar’s head,
carved in alabaster upon the tomb of Sir Humphrey Stafford in Bromsgrove
Church, though that crest may have originated in some great feat done by
one of the Staffords in earlier times, and the ballad in its primitive form may
have commemorated an exploit of a more ancient hunter in the glades of
Feckenham Forest.*
* The ballad is not peculiar to Worcestershire ; it is found in other counties further north. The Bromsgrove
version, though obviously corrupt and wretched doggerel, has, nevertheless, a certain historical value.
253
THE JOVIAL HUNTER OF BROMSGROVE.,


The Staffords settled at Grafton Manor, near Bromsgrove, in the reign of Edward 111. Sir
Ralph Stafford having married Maud, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Sir] John Hastings, to
whom Grafton then belonged. Sir Ralph was succeeded by his son, Sir Humphrey, who
married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Sir John Burdett.
The eldest son of this marriage—a second Sir Humphrey—married Eleanor, daughter of Sir
Thomas Aylesbury. It is this Sir Humphrey and his lady who are represented on the beautiful
altar tomb in Bronisgrove Church, and about whom the legend is related.
Sir Humphrey was slain in Jack Cade’s rebellion in 1450, and figures in Shakespeare’s play
of Henry VI. (Part 2, Act iv.)
“ This monument of victory will I bear,"
exclaims Cade, putting on Sir Humphrey’s brigandine. After the battle, when Archbishop
Stafford and the Duke of Buckingham went to Elackheath to treat with Cade, they found
that popular leader ' arrayed in the splendid armour of their kinsman, and they knew that he
was dead. There was no mistaking the armour, of which Sir Humphrey had been so proud,
“his‘brigandine set with gilt nails, his' solet, and his spurs”—(Hook’s "Lives of the Arch-
bishops,” quoted by W. A. Cotton, "Bronisgrove Church,” p. 70). -
This armour is probably represented upon the Knight’s tomb. Around his neck is a collar
of SS, and his head rests upon a tilting helmet, surmounted by a boar’s head crest.
The Lady Eleanor long survived her husband, and, in 1479, founded a chantry in Eroms-
grovc Church that prayers might be for ever said for the good estate of the king, the queen,
herself, and Sir Humphrey her husband, and Humphrey, Thomas, Elizabeth, and Joyce, their
children. Thomas Lytelton, Justice of the Common Pleas; John Catesby, Sergeant-at-Law;
and other trustees were appointed.—(W. A. Cotton, " Bromsgrove Church,” p. 62.)
This third Humphrey Stafford fought under the banner of Richard 111, at Bosworth Field;
he survived the battle, was attainted in November, 1455, and executed shortly afterwards. His
brother, Thomas, was pardoned, but his estates were forfeited. Grafton passed to the Talbots,
who figure conspicuously in later history.
From an inquisition (MS. copy, posses. W. S. B.), taken at Bromsgrove, in the second year
of the reign of Henry VII, (i 486), the following facts relative to the Staffords’ Worcestershire
possessions may be gleaned:—The Manor of Grafton and its park, granted to Sir Richard Guilford
and Sir Gilbert Talbot were worth 20 marks a year. The Manor of Upton Warren, granted to
the same, £4. A rent arising from three houses in Bromsgrove, 205,, granted to J. Pymp
and J. Darell. Six messuages in King’s Norton, granted to the same persons, £3 ; two
messuages in Kidderminster, 20s. ; six messuages in Droitwich, £4 ; and one in " Kekyawyche,
40s.

associates this house with the name of Warwick the King
Maker—Richard Neville, and it is commonly reported that he
was born at Salwarpe: this is improbable.
Salwarpe Manor was annexed to the barony of the Castle of Worcester, and
was the inheritance of the Beauchamps, having descended to them as heirs of
Urso de Abitot. The Nevilles did not possess the estates of the Beauchamps
till after the death of' Henry Beauchamp, Duke of Warwick, in 1445, when
Richard Neville, in right of his young wife, Anne, daughter of Richard Beau-
champ, Earl of Warwick, succeeded to the lands and title of the Beauchamps.


On the other hand, there is very good evidence —namely, the Rous Roll-
in favour of Sahvarpe being the birthplace of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of
Warwick, father-in-law of the King Maker.
On the 28th January, 1381, Richard Beauchamp was born at the manor
house at Sahvarpe, in the county of Worcester*
King Richard 11. and Richard Scroope, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield,
were his godfathers; from them he received his Christian name. In 1401,
Richard’s father, Thomas, Earl of Warwick, died, leaving him his earldom with
his benediction, and
“a bed of silk embroidered with bears, and his arms and all that belonged thereto; a
.... wrought with the armes and story of Guy of Warwick ; his sword, harness, and
ragged staves; and a coat of mail, sometime belonging to the famous Guy; with his cup of
the swan, and the knives and salt cellars for the coronation of a . king, which should remain
to his said son, and his heirs after himAf
When twenty-three years of age, Richard Look part in a tournament at the
coronation of Jane of Navarre, Queen of Henry IV., and about the same time
helped the King to repulse the Welsh, who had crossed the border into
Worcestershire, and marched as far as the parish of Great Witley, where an
ancient earth-work on Woodbury Hill is said to mark the place at which Owen
Glendower encamped. Earl Richard took the Welshman’s banner, and drove
him and his forces back to the mountains.
At Shrewsbury (1403), the Earl fought for the King, performing prodigious
feats of valour in his encounter with the Percies.j
After these exploits, Earl Richard made a vow to visit the Holy Land, and
travelling into Italy, set sail from Venice. After many adventures he arrived at
Jerusalem, where “a noble person called Baltredam, the Souldan’s Lieutenant,”
came to him, saying he had read of the famous Sir Guy of Warwick in

The badge of bear is believed .to have been assumed by the Beauchamps and derived from their ancestor
Urso , the Norman Sheriff of Worcester. The ragged staff was at first a separate badge, and so appeared on
the tomb of Earl Thomas at Warwick, and upon the armour of Richard Beauchamp’s followers as depicted
in the Rous Roll (Mr, Cotton, Julius E. IV., art. fi, Brit. Mus.)

a book of their own language, and also confessed to him that he was a
Christian; “ whereupon the Earl gave him a gown of black puke furred, and
had much discourse with him, for he was skilful in sundry languages.”
Having set up his arms on the north side of the temple, Richard returned
home by way of Italy, turning aside, however, to visit Russia, Poland,
and Germany. No sooner did the “father of courtesy,” as the Emperor
Sigismund called him, appear at Court again than he was appointed to serve
Prince Henry, afterwards Henry V 7.
We next hear of him in 1414 actively engaged in suppressing a Lollard
rising. Many Worcestershire families seem to have received the Lollard doctrine,
and in the thick woods of Malvern Chase some of the persecuted sect found
shelter. Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, their leader, is said to have been
in hiding at Birds Morton Court, near Tewkesbury, and there seems to be
no reason to doubt the truth of the tradition.
from hunting Lollards, Warwick turned to protect Calais, of which town he
was made captain in 1416. We need not follow him through the French wars,
wherein he won a name second only to that of King Henry V. He negociated
the marriage between that monarch and Catherine of France. His virtues and
accomplishments caused him to be chosen as tutor and governor to the young
King Henry VI., whom he made upright, learned, and conscientious. He died
on 30th April, 1439, and lies buried under a most beautiful tomb at St, Mary’s,
Warwick, in the centre of the Beauchamp Chapel, which he founded.
It is with the worthiest and most esteemed of the English nobles of his day
—“the gracious Warwick”—that Salwarps is especially associated, but in later
times the King Maker, becoming lord thereof, may indeed have visited the
place in company with his wife the Countess Anne.
The Manor of Salwarps, with its noble park and a wood of 120 acres, continued in the
possession of Richard Beauchamp's heirs till after the death of the King Maker at the battle of
Barnet. The unfortunate Countess Anne, after living in great poverty for some time, at length
transferred all her lands to King Henry VII. —(Dugdale, p. 299), The Worcestershire posses-
sions are set down in the deed as follows; “ Albotley, Shraveley, If Imley-Lovet, Salwarpe,

In 1546, the Manor of Salwarjrc was alienated by George Wall, and others, to Sir John
Talbot, knt., who conveyed it to Mr. Gilbert Talbot, his eldest son, by his second wife
Elizabeth Wrothesley (Nash).
Salwarpe Court is so well preserved that it is hard to believe the existing house is that in
which Richard Beauchamp was born; parts of the building maybe as old as the 14th century,
but great alterations appear to have been made by the Talbots in the 16th century.

with the ancient history of the manor we are not now concerned. Still, in
passing, we may just spare a few moments to glance at the church, a modern
building, containing some interesting old monuments, chiefly to the Dowdeswells,
and surmounted by their arms — or, a Jesse wavy between six billets sable . Here
are mural tablets to Roger Dowdeswell, 1633; Richard Dowdeswell, .1673;
William Dowdeswell, a general in the army, Governor of the Bahamas, and
M.P, for Tewkesbury, 1828. A more elaborate monument is that to the
Right Hon. William Dowdeswell, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Rocking-
ham Administration, 1765-6. The long epitaph was written by Burke, his
intimate friend, who said that though eulogistic, every word of it was true. On
the western wall of the nave are two brasses—one, a plate, has a finely en-

lately been faced with red brick. The chief feature in the house was the hall,
20 feet wide, and long in proportion, with a fine open timber roof, supported
by a handsome arch of oak, still to be seen in one of the bedrooms—the
present bedroom floor having been inserted in the hall, probably a hundred
years after the house was built.*
In this hall the household lived; meals were served at the great table, the
master and his lady sat at the upper end, the children and servants lower down.
Here, in the winter, songs were sung, and good old stories told round the
blazing fire. Here, after supper, the servants slept on benches, or on the floor,
while the master and his family retired to the privacy of their apartments on
the upper floor in the wings of the house. One of these wings, that to the
west, was pulled down early in this century; but the eastern wing, with over-
hanging upper story and well-carved barge boards in the gable, remains in ex-
cellent preservation, Payne’s Place is in every way a good example of the
house of a substantial Worcestershire yeoman of the 15th century.
Not much is known about Master Payne, he is believed to have been related
to the Paynes of Rodborough, in Gloucestershire, and like them to have been
a clothier by trade. His presence at Pushley shows that he was an adherent of
the Earl of Warwick, and the bear and rugged staff, and the badge of the bull
of Neville, carved upon a beam, now adorning a cottage at Church End, but
formerly in Payne's Place, would seem to point to his adhesion to the noble
tamily, whose cognisance he placed upon his house, and in whose manor he
was living while Richard ■ Neville was making and unmaking kings. It is not
likely that this substantial trader took any active part in the wars of the Roses,
but though he went not to the wars, the wars came to him.
■* When the great halls went out of fashion the/ were generally converted into ordinary rooms and a bedroom
floor inserted. In the time of Elizabeth, perhaps earlier, the walls of some of the best rooms were often adorned
with a kind of fresco, called by contemporary writers, "water work." At Payne's Place the timbers of the
bouse formed strips down the walls, svitb white plaster between them. The timbers were coloured brown, leaving
the plaster visible. Probably the walls were then covered with hangings, but above the hangings a painted
frieze extended round tbs room, ibis frieze being divided into panels by a frame work in colour. The smaller
panels contain shields, bearing the initials A.S. and M..S. (for Anthony and Mary Stafford, who owned the
house in the time of Queen Elizabeth), and the date 1577. between the shields pious couplets admonish
the reader—
"To lyve as wee shoulde alwayes dye it were a goixlfy trade,

HISTORIC WORCESTERSHIRE.


On Saturday, May 4th, 1471, the King Maker was no longer alive to lead
the Lancastrians, and the Duke of Somerset had assumed the command of
Queen Margaret’s little army.
On Friday, May 3rd, the Queen arrived before the gates of Gloucester,
but Edward, Duke of York, had sent a message to the Governor, Richard
Beauchamp, son of Lord Beauchamp, bidding him “keep the town and city”
for him, and refuse admittance to the Lancastrians: Beauchamp obeyed. Had
Gloucester opened her gates, the Lancastrians would have crossed the Severn
and joined the force which Jasper Tudor was bringing up from Chepstow.
'Thwarted in- their design, Queen Margaret and Somerset marched on to Tewkes-
bury, and there encamped without the town in a strong position, defended
by dikes and hedges, “a right evill place to approache as could well have been
devysed.”
While the Lancastrians were marching to Tewkesbury, the Yorkists following
an ancient road along the ridge of the Cotteswolds; descending at Leckhampton
Hill, and came “ unto a village called Chiltcnham,” where Edward learned that
the enemy had taken up a strong position in order to give him battle. After
a brief halt, lie commanded his troops to advance to within three miles of the
Lancastrian camp.* Early on Saturday the fight commenced; before nightfall
the Queen’s troops were completely routed by the Yorkists.
'There was at that time no bridge across the Severn at Tewkesbury. 'The
passage of the river might be made at the Upper nr Lower Lode, where fords
had existed from early times; but an army could not cross without great
danger and delay, so the Lancastrians had no retreat. A road led from the
Upper Lode, through the fields, in the direction of Bushley, and actually passed
through the hall of Payne’s Place.!
The Yorkest Chronicle, quoted by Holinshed, states that ;
“On Tuesday the vii, day of May, the Kingc {Edward IV.) departyd from Tewkesbery to-
wards the citie of Worcester, and on the wayc he had certayne knowledge that Queen Margaret
was founded not far from thence, in a powte religious place where she had hyd hirself, for the

t The Rev. E. R. Dotvdeswel! informs me that a right-of-way from Tewkesbury to Bushley, through Payne’s
Place, where the doors on opposite sides of the hall were seen when the house was restored, has been claimed
and acknowledged within the memory of people lately living.

QUEEN MARGARET’S FLIGHT,


surty of her person, the Saturdaye, erlyc in the morninge, after her sorme Edwarcle, called
Prince, was gone to the field, for to withdraw herselfe from the adventure of the battayle, of
whom also he was assured that she should be at his commandment.”
It has been thought that Deerhurst was the Queen’s hiding-place “ the
powrc religious place,” but as the way thither lay across the battlefield, and
towards the Yorkist army, this is improbable. We have the testimony of Speed
to prove that Margaret went in the opposite direction :
“Queen Margaret in this fatal day of battle fled towards Worcester.”
There were two roads which the fugitive queen might have taken, one by the
ancient bridge across the Avon, and so over the My the; the other by the
Ford at the Upper, or Lower Lode to Bushley, and into the wilds of Malvern
Chase. Local tradition, and our sense of what is probable, both approve of
the latter course.
Local tradition, recorded in a note by Miss Cooper of Tewkesbury, who, in
THE LOWER LODE, A FERRY ACROSS THE SEVERN NEAR TEWKESBURY.
1820, wrote a poem upon the battle, states that in her extremity Queen Margaret
forded the Severn, her horse being guided by two monks. Having safely


crossed the river, the fugitive Queen crossed the boundary into Worcestershire,
and presently arrived before the door of the mansion house at Bennett’s
End. Here good Master Payne and Dame Ursula, his wife, came out to
meet their Queen, offering the hospitality of their house, and entreating her to
remain and rest that night. Their hospitality was accepted —at least, so says
tradition—and they prepared for their Queen’s reception a room in the east
wing of the house, on the first floor —doubtless their best room,—with its great
window, looking out towards the battlefield, and the old grey tower of the
Abbey rising above the willow-fringed streams; a chamber which is still called,
in memory of that night, “ The Queen’s Room.”
The probability of the tradition being true is strengthened by the fact that
the Manor of Bushley belonged to the Countess of Warwick, and consequently
the Queen would be among friends as soon as she reached Bushley, and,
having crossed the river, she would be in comparative safety, though within
sight of the m'elee, and within hearing of the boom of the culverins.
Next morning, or late that night, news of her son’s death on Tewkesbury
held—for it is- now well established that Prince Edward was killed during the
battle —reached the sorrowing Queen. Her hopes were for ever shattered; the
neighbourhood of Tewkesbury was too dangerous to remain in; a safer hiding
place must be found. Leaving Payne's Place by devious ways, the unhappy Margaret
sought that poor religious house, probably Little Malvern Priory, in the wildest
and most secluded part of the forest, whither her equally unhappy daughter-in-law,
Anne of Warwick, and her friends, the Countess of Devonshire and Lady
Catherine Vaux, had already fled. In that sanctuary Margaret remained for
three days, when her old enemy, Sir William Stanley, tracked her to this hiding
place, and conducted .her thence, probably by way of Worcester, to the King,
who had removed to Coventry.* •
* For much valuable information respecting Payne’s Place and its associations, I am indebted to the Rev. E.
R. Dowdeswell, who in an account of Payne’s Place, in " the Longdon, Bushley, Queenhill, and Holdfast

expenses of maintaining the Queen when in prison.

OAK PARLOUR, EIRT’s MORTON COURT.




There was no room for monasticism in the policy which had arisen with the
new monarchy, so Henry VIII. and his minister, Thomas Cromwell, resolved
upon the suppression of monasteries. The smaller houses being the weaker
and worst managed were first dissolved, the greater monasteries quickly
sharing the same fate, as the policy of the despotic Tudor developed.
In many parts of England, notably in Worcestershire, an attempt had been
made to reform the small and badly managed priories within whose walls the

licentiousness which
disgraced ordinary so-
ciety had crept like
the miasma of some
noisome swamp.
Good Bishop Alcock
(1476-1487) applied
himself diligently to
this work and upon
coming to his new
diocese in 1476 soon
discovered that the
monks of Little
Malvern Priory were
not so strict in their
discipline as they
ought to have been.
He accordingly visited
the house and find-
ing it ruinous, re-
built it, beautified
the church, and paid
the greater portion of
a debt which the
Prior had contracted. He then wrote to the monks, solemnly admonishing
them to avoid dissolute living; monks should not live like laymen, nor like


vagabonds’their conduct had brought “ disworship ” on the church, ■ He exhorted
them to live in holy obedience to the discipline of their order, and to maintain
the daily worship of God, never to go out into the fields without urgent
cause, and in no case without a companion. The monastery was. reformed,
but its existence was simply prolonged for half a century.
The ruins of Little Malvern Priory stand in .a wild glen below the Here-
fordshire Beacon. The tower, the chancel of the church, and a few
crumbling walls remain, to attest Bishop Alcock’s skill in architecture.
In 1544, Henry VIII., granted the Priory to Richard Andrews and Nicholas
Temple, the rents were then valued at 2 d. a year, representing
over £2OOO of our present money. The chancel of the monastic church was
afterwards used for parochial worship. The picturesque Priory House is now
the mansion of the Berington’s, to whom it descended from the Russell’s.
Doubtless, the monks of this sequestered monastery found life monotonous,
and the strict discipline enforced by their benefactor irksome; some of the
brethren may even have relapsed into their former errors, for a legend has
been preserved concerning the penance of one of their number.
TThc |£cjjcuh at
A certain monk of Little Malvern Priory having sinned and being penitent
was ordered by way of penance to crawl on his hands and knees from the
Priory gate to the summit of the Ragged-Stone Hill, and there to recite a
number of prayers.
The distance to be traversed—about three miles, a tedious genuflec-
tionary pilgrimage to make, and painful under any circumstance since the way
led through the forest, across the rough ground at the base of the hills, and
then up the steep and stony side of the hill itself.
As the erring monk could only be absolved from his offences by this
severe penance he started on his pilgrimage, attended, doubtless, by some of
his cowled brethren to see that he went truly over the ground. By painful
effort he crawled through the woods and along the hill side to the base of
the Ragged-Stone Hill, his garments were rent by the thorns and brambles,
his hands and knees cut by the sharp stones, still he persevered, and at


length he began the ascent of the steep and stony hill, truly a grievous trial;
the way grew more difficult, as the penitent crawled upwards over the sharp
volcanic stones, and through the prickly gorse bushes. The sun, which had
been high in the heavens when he set out from the Priory, was now sinking
towards the west, casting a long, dark shadow from the Ragged-Stone Hill
over the plain of the Severn Valley.
The monk saw the shadow resting upon the forest below him, he noticed
how it grew longer and longer, throwing its dark mantle over the plain
almost to Bredon Hill, which lay upon the opposite side of the Severn in
glorious sunshine. The shadow, however, brought no relief to his aching
limbs, and before he reached the summit of the hill he lost patience. In the
anguish of his soul and the pain of his lacerated knees he suddenly arose
and vociferated a terrible curse upon the hill he was climbing, and upon all
those upon whom its shadow should thenceforth fall.
Nothing more is remembered of the wicked monk; he would have been
entirely forgotten except for the curse which he left upon the Ragged-Stone
Hill; the memory of that unholy imprecation has been treasured up by tradition
and remains to the present day to augur coming evil to the dwellers
in the country between the blighted hill and the Severn. When the
lengthened shadow of the Ragged-Stone is thrown athwart the eastern land-
scape, then woe betide those who unwittingly get within it I
The shadow falls at times upon Birt’s Morton Court, a moated manor
house, famous in story and still beautiful, though no longer the home of
gallant knights as of yore. Birt’s Morton was, as the name implies, formerly
the home of the Birts or Brutes, whose heiress marrying a Ruyhall, the
manor passed to that family and then to the Oldcastles, and so to a noble
Cornish family named Nanfan. Sir John Nanfan held the high office of
Esquire of the Body to King Henry VI. Sir Richard Nanfan, his grandson,
was a man of mark, both in his native county and abroad; in acknowledg-
ment of services rendered to the house of Lancaster he was made Sheriff of
Cornwall and of Worcestershire, and afterwards Captain of Calais in the time
of Henry VII, Growing old, Sir Richard gave up his honourable office
abroad and retired to his Worcestershire estates, living chiefly at Birt’s Morton


Court. At that time Sir Richard is said to have employed as chaplain,
or private secretary, a young man of great talent, one Thomas Wolsey, after-
wards the great minister of Henry VIII. It so happened, as the story runs,
that one warm afternoon Wolsey had wandered into the garden beside the
broad moat at Birt’s Morton Court, when, being overcome by the heat, he
fell asleep over the book he was reading, and while he slumbered the
shadow of the Ragged-Stone fell upon him. This, it was said—after the
event, of course—indicated the ruinous fall that closed the Cardinal’s
brilliant and haughty career.*

our English princes have died in early manhood,
before the golden promise of their youth could be realized;
such was the fate, of Arthur, Prince of Wales, eldest son of
M J|j Henry VIL Upon this young prince the expectations of the
nation centred, for in his veins the blood of the rival Houses
of York and Lancaster mingled, and should he reign - there
could be no possibility of a renewal of the terrible strife between the. roses,
white and red. ' .
Prince Arthur was born at Winchester, in i 486, and shortly afterwards
Bishop Alcock of Worcester (1476-87) baptised him with due solemnity.; It was
intended that the young prince, when old enough, should exercise authority in the
Principality of Wales. To the Welsh people, who cherished the memory of their
brave rulers, this prospect of again having a prince of their own was hailed
with delight. At that time they were governed by a Lord President, and a
Council of Wales. The Council held its meetings at- Ludlow, Bewdley, or
Worcester, as might 'be convenient. At’ Ludlow and Bewdley the President
had a castle and a palace, and Worcester was the chief city on the Welsh
border
In former times, since the border barons ‘could not always be relied upon,
the- Bishops of Hereford and of Worcester especially had taken an active part in
guarding the Marches, but their power gradually declined as .the organization of
the State grew more perfect. The improved condition of the Welsh Marches
led to the establishment oL the ■ Court of the President • and. Council, of Wales,
in 1478. This Court lessened the political importance of the Bishops, and, in
1497, after the death ’of Bishop Morton, the revenues of the See were . devoted

the Papal Court. For
forty years Italians, re-
siding chiefly at Rome
were titular Bishops of
Worcester, the affairs of
the Diocese being man-
aged by a suffragan and
a vicar-general. It
should be remembered
that the appointment of
Italians. to this See was
not an act of Papal-
aggression, as it is gener-
ally believed to have
been, but the deliberate
policy of the English
sovereign, who, requiring
a resident ambassador
at Rome, applied the
princely revenues of
Worcester to the sup-
port of that official.*

affairs of state, as well
possibly as personal
reasons, brought Henry

may have been thought good for him. There is an old tradition that
Henry VII. lodged in the room over the Priory gateway, and it has also been
said that this king so much admired the situation of Malvern that he and his
sons beautified the church with stained glass windows “to a degree of
magnificence that made it one of the proudest ornaments of the nation.” *
The shattered fragments of these windows remain, and, fortunately, the kneeling
figure of Prince Arthur, and of his Worcestershire friend, Sir Reginald Bray,t
may yet be seen. In Habington’s time the figures of the king and queen
also were perfect, but these have since been destroyed.
It was important that the Prince should marry, so his politic father entered
into negotiations with the King of Spain for the hand of Princess Catherine of
Aragon. After long delay, the marriage was at length arranged. The Prince
was at that time staying at Ticknell Palace, a stately house, built chiefly of
timber, and having a great court and garden with several outbuildings, the site
altogether occupying two acres. § It stood upon a hill above the pleasant town
of Bewdley, and about it was a fair park, well wmoded with 3500 large oak
trees, and stocked with 180 head of deer.t

used by Prince Arthur, is preserved in a private collection at Malvern.

{ The Prattinton MSS., at the Society of Antiquaries, contains the following note respecting Tlcknell: — 11 This
house, with the adjoining park, was destroyed in the late times of usurpation.—(Add. to Camden’s “ Britannia,”
1695). So much of the house as I remember standing was part of the east side on the brow of the hill towards
the town. It consists of the gate-house, with a dwelling on the south of it, wherein Jived Mr. Edward Best

from the Rev, J, R. Burton’s “History of Bewdley” (18S3), we learn that about twenty years after the death of
Prince Arthur, Ticknell Palace was repaired by Henry VIII, as a residence for his daughter, the Princess Mary.
In the reign of Edward VI., Ticknell belonged to Lord Seymour, brother of the Protector Somerset, who probably
acquired it on his marriage with Queen Catherine Parr. When Seymour was executed (March 20, 1549), the
manor reverted to the crown. The survey taken after the execution of Charles I. when the furniture from all
the King's palaces was sold, describes 11 Ticknell House with a green courtyard, garden, and offices, and
containing by estimation 3 acres, very much out of repair, and valued for the materials at .£797 4s. od.”
About 1738, most of the old house was pulled down. There is, however, a drawing of the gate-house made
by Dr. Stukcley in 1712, and reproduced in Severn Walker's "Antiquities." Some of the inner walls of the
old palace are still standing, and In 18S0, a lady’s shoe of the Tudor period was found behind the wainscot.
In 1873, Ticknell was purchased from the Crown hy Mr. Joseph Tangye,

PRINCE ARTHUR.


Contrary to the prevalent belief, the actual marriage of the heir to the
English . throne with the Spanish Princess did not take place at Bewdley, though
the marriage by proxy was celebrated there, as tbe following account taken
from contemporary records proves :
On the morning of May 19th, 1499, at nine o’clock, after first mass, it
being Whit-Sunday, the Prince received Roderic Gundersalvi de Puebla, Proctor
to. the Lady Catherine, daughter of the King of Spain. After the formal pre-
liminary courtesies, de Puebla produced a license signed by the Princess, and this
having been read, the Prince put out his right hand, and took hold of the
right hand of the Proctor. Then the Prince’s Chamberlain, Richard Poole, held
both their hands conjoined, while Prince Arthur declared that he received the
Proctor in the name of the Lady Catherine, and in her person, as his true
and lawful wife, promising from that hour so to treat and consider her. The
Proctor repeated the same words, and the marriage by proxy was completed.*
The betrothal had taken place at Woodstock, on August 15th, 1497.
The marriage was ratified by Henry VII, at Calais, May 28th, 1499, but
the Princess did not arrive in England till the autumn, the actual marriage
taking place in St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, upon November 14th. The bride
was just 18 years of age, the bridegroom only 15. At first the Council
objected to the union of this very young couple, but Henry overcame their
scruples, and wrote to the King of Spain that he had sent the Prince and
Princess down to the Marches of Wales, there to keep their court in one of
the most salubrious parts of his kingdom.
At. Ludlow Castle, or at the little palace on the hills overlooking the Severn
and the town of. Bewdley, Prince Arthur passed most of. the short interval
between his marriage and his death. He was the last Prince -of Wales who
actually ruled in the Principality, and under the direction of wise counsellors,
such as Sir Reginald Bray, Sir Griffith ap Rice, Sir Richard Croft, or Bishop
Smyth, his rule proved beneficent. Among other matters, he arranged a long-
standing feud between the towns of Bewdley and Kidderminster,!

HISTORIC WORCESTERSHIRE,


On the and of April, 1502, Prince Arthur lay a-dying in Ludlow Castle. As
soon as life became extinct, Sir Richard Poole, the Prince’s Chamberlain, and
the other members of the Council present, sent a letter to the King at Green-
wich, discreetly entrusting the missive to a Friar. After spending over a fort-
night on the journey, the Friar came early on the morning of the 20th to the
King’s bedchamber, and announced the sorrowful tidings.
In the meantime the corpse was “boyled, well sered, and conveniently dressed
with spices and other sweet stuffe .... This was so sufficiently done that
it needed no lead, but was chested. The chest was covered with a good
blacke cloth, close sewed to the frame, with a white cross and sufficient rings
of iron to the same.”
On St. Mark’s day the procession went from Ludlow to Bewdley, and the
contemporary chronicler remarks :
“It was the foulest cold, windye, and rainey daye, and the worst waye that I have scene,
yea, and in some places they were faine to take oxen to drawe the charre, so ill was the waye,
as soone as the corpse was in the chappie of Beaudley, and set in the quire there with such
lights as there was room for, the dirge begunn. That done the lordes and others went to their
dinners, for it was a fasting daye.
“In the morne, the Earl of Surrey offered at the Mass of Requiem a noble in manner as
before, at which masse season there was a general! dole of pence—of two pence to every poore
man and woman. Every church that the corpes remayned in was well furnished of scochions
of my Lord’s armes, both of mettall and colour, and every parish church, or religious place
or order, that mett the corpes with procession, and range their belles, had a noble or gould,
foure torches and six scochions of armes.” *
The way the procession went from Bewdley is not stated, but probably it
passed over Bewdley bridge,t and so to Hartlebury, Ombersley, and Claines.
Sir Richard Croft and Sir William Overdale, stetvard and controller of the
Prince’s horse, rode before to Worcester, and suffered no man to enter the
city gate until the procession arrived. At the town end the friars met the pro-
cession, and censed the body. Here a halt was made, fresh shields of arms
were put upon the car and fresh torches given to the torch-bearers, while the
gentlemen rode tw 7 o and Jwo. At the Foregate the bailiffs and- the honest men
of the city were waiting with the Bishop’s officers, and a goodly number of

f There is a tradition that the procession crossed the river at the ferry by the Red-Stone Hermitage.


secular canons, in grey garments, with rich copes; many clergy, choristers, and
citizens, bearing torches, lined the street. When the funeral arrived at the
Cathedral precincts, three bishops received it, and the coffin being taken out
of the car was placed under a canopy, and carried in procession to the church.
Here were assembled the Abbots of Gloucester, Evesham, Chester, Shrewsbury,
Tewkesbury, Hayles, and Bordesley, with most of the local nobility and gentry.
“The hearse,” writes the chronicler, “was the goodlyest and best wrought and
garnished that ever I saw.” There were. about it iS lights, two great standards,
many smaller standards of the armis of the Prince,’ in all “100 pencills of
divers badges.” That night there was a goodly watch of lords, knights, and
esquires, gentlemen ushers, officers of arms, yeomen, and many others. It would
be tedious to recount all the minute details of the elaborate ceremonial per-
formed at the burial of Prince Arthur. There was, however, one curious
ceremony which must be noticed. ■ The son of Lord Kildare, escorted by the
chief officers of the household, and clad in the Prince’s armour, rode into the
Cathedral upon the Prince’s horse, bearing the surcoat, shield, sword, and
crested helmet of the dead youth. The Abbot of Tewkesbury, being gospeller,
met the knight as he entered the choir, and received the war-horse as an
offering; the rider then and was led into the vestry. Probably this was
the grandest funeral ever witnessed in Worcester Cathedral, eclipsing that of
King John, and accompanied with all the pomp of heraldry, and the stately
ritual of the Pre-Reformation Church.
In the afternoon a great dinner was provided, and, on the following morning,
a proclamation was made openly in the city “ that if any man could shewe
any victualls unpaid in that county, that had been taken by any of that noble
Prince’s servantes before that daye, they should come and shewe it to the
steward, and cofferer, and they should be contented. . . . Thus
God have mercye on good Prince Arthur’s soule.”
Over the grave of the young Prince, King Henry VII. caused to be built
one of the finest chantry chapels ever designed in England, and though this
monument has suffered at the rough hands of ignorant iconoclasts it still retains
much of its sculpture, and is the chief ornament of the choir of Worcester-
Cathedral. In the reign of Elizabeth the interior was plastered over, thus


preserving the beautiful tracery from further mutilation. At the end of the 18th
century, upon the plaster being removed, the original decorations of the chapel
were brought to light again.

His father, Sir Richard had been Privy Councillor to Henry VI., and though his estates were at Eaton-Bray,
in Bedfordshire, he settled at Worcester, and lies buried in the north aisle of Worcester Cathedral. Sir Reginald
held the post of steward of the household to Sir Henry Stafford, and when his master’s kinsman, the Duke of
Buckingham, had concocted with Bishop Morton (Alcock’s successor at Worcester) the plan of marrying the
Earl of Richmond (afterwards Henry VIL), to the Princess Elizabeth, an 1 the Earl's advancement to the throne.
Bray was chosen as a fit person to conduct this most important business. The treason prospered and became no
treason. Bray fought at Bosworth, and was amply rewarded. He became knight of the garter, constable of
Oakham Castle, one of the trustees for the dower of Catherine of Aragon, and 3 personal friend oT the royal
family. Knowing these facts, it need cause no surprise that his poi trait should appear with those of the
King, Queen, and Prince in the Malvern window. Sir Reginald was well skilled in architecture, having
designed, as it is said, St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and Henry VJl.’s Chapel, Westminster. (See “Die. Nat.

HE WELT. GRANGE, HEAR EKOMSGJROVE. THE SEAT OF I.ORD WfNDSOR
(From an old Engiaving-lSt/i Century.)
Sir Hnfcrcws HflUnfcsor’s £jcbanoe*
HERE is a story told by Sir William Dugdale and repeated
a'&Mm by Dr, Nash to the effect that Henry VIIL, acting upon
the advice of his minister, Thomas Cromwell, adopted the
ready expedient of forcing the newly-acquired Abbey lands
upon those of his nobility who were suspected of enter-
taining a lingering affection for the monasteries; thus lessen-
irithe chances of opposition to his arbitrary measures and preventing the
monastic lands from reverting to their former uses.
The king, so it is stated, one day sent a message to Sir Andrews
Windsor that he w T ould visit him at his house at Stanwell, in Middlesex. . Sir
Andrews being of noble ancestry; Otho, or Other, a powerful baron in the
time of Edward the Confessor, had a son, Walter, Castellan of Windsor, in
which office he was succeeded by his son William, called de Windsor, which


thenceforth remained the family surname. Walter Fitz Otho was the progenitor
of the Windsors, Fitzgeralds, and Graces. Sir Andrews was a courtier, and
had been employed on weighty State affairs; at the Battle of Spurs he had
been made a knight banneret; he had attended Princess Mary, the king’s
sister, on her matrimonial journey to France in 1514, and had taken an active
part in most of the expeditions of war or ceremony during King Henry’s
reign. : In : 1539 he was summoned to Parliament,, as Baron Windsor of
StamvelL. It was, therefore, in no way remarkable that King Henry should
express a wish to dine with a subject so well known and nobly descended.
A magnificent entertainment was provided by Baron ‘ Windsor for his
autocratic monarch, who expressed himself well pleased with the reception ;
he liked the place so well, he told his host, that he was resolved ; -to ( have
it. - • ; '■
The Baron’s astonishment may well be imagined : his expostulations were
useless. Stanwell had been the Windsors’ home for upwards of four centuries,
but at the King’s word, for no apparent reason, it must be resigned. The
Royal lawyers came and informed the Baron that the documents for the
transfer were prepared, that the King simply desired an exchange of Stanwell
for the lands of the lately-dissolved abbey of Bordesley, in Worcestershire ;
this exchange would be advantageous to the Windsors. There was an
alternative, namely, decapitation. Being a discreet man, the Baron yielded
to the inevitable with the best grace he could, signed the transfer, and took
his departure from the home of his ancestors, leaving behind his whole stock
of Christmas provisions, which he had laid in on an unusually lavish scale,
for, said he, the King shall not find it bare Stanwell. The King, in recom-
pense, made him keeper of his great wardrobe.
It was in 1543 that Henry VIII. granted to Lord Windsor the manor of
Bordesley, with “ the lordships of Bordesley, Tarbccke, Reddiche, Strech
Bentley, Cobley, Tutmill, Burland, and the grange of Hewell, with the rectory
of Tarbeck and the advowson of St. Stephen’s, Bordesley.” From that day
the Windsors have been counted among the nobility of Worcestershire, having
resided chiefly at the abbey grange at Hewell.
In Habington’s time there were standing of the ruins of the ancient abbey


“ only a fayre raysed and decaying chappell and a greate owlde gate, which
letting in her foes hath let out her fryndes.” *
There is now nothing left of the abbey but grass-covered mounds of rubbish and the banks
of the monks’ fish-ponds. From among these mounds, fragments of wrought stone, roofing
tiles, encaustic tiles, and glass have been recovered, sufficient to prove that the old monastery
was a stately building of stone with a red-tiled roof. There is extant an order of King
Edward 111. relating to the Stone of Scone, now in the coronation chair at Westminster Abbey,
dated from Bordesley Abbey. Other English monarchs occasionally visited this monastery,
which lay in the midst of the forest upon the borders of Worcestershire and Warwickshire,
and was a convenient hunting centre. Guy da Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, nick-named by
Piers Gaverston —The Black Dog of Arden—bequeathed his body to the monks of Bordesley,
and was interred in the monastic church. Although the situation of Bordesley Abbey in the
green vale of Arrow was beautiful, its new lords preferred the somewhat higher ground at
Hewell, which was their principal residence when the Gunpowder Plot conspirators attacked the
house, on their way from Dunchurch towards Wales, taking thence such arms as they could
find. At a subsequent period, and after extensive alterations made in 1758, the old grange
was rebuilt, and its appearance in the eighteenth century is represented in the engraving
at the beading of this chapter. A new mansion, on a better site, has been built within
the last ten years ; and the old house was blown up during the festivities in honour of the
Shah of Persia, who was the present Lord Windsor’s guest in July, 1889.

HEN Queen Elizabeth had been seated
upon the throne of England nearly seven-
teen years, word was brought to Worcester
that, in her progress through the realm,
her Majesty would visit the Faithful City.
Thereupon, a meeting of the Common
Council was held in the Guild Hall to
consider what was to be done on the
occasion. The Chamber Order Book
records:—
I. Imprinms ; for as much as it is reported that
the Queen's Majestie will come to this citie, hit
is agreed that before her Majestie’s comyng the
four' gates shall be sett in some decent color, viz.,
in an asbe color, with her Majestie’s arms both
within and without.
11. Item that every person having any dong hills
or myskeyns and tymber within the Liberties shall
cause the same to be carried away within ten
days next : and so shall kepe clean their soyles, and pave the same with all convenyant
spede: and that every inhabitant of the Foregate Street, the High Street, the Broad Street,
Newport Street to the end of the Libertie, the' Leech Lane, Sudbury Street to the end of
the Liberties, there shall provide gravell for their soyles.
There are in all seventeen items passed by the Council at the meeting. It
would be tedious to give these at length; they provide for the whitewashing
of the houses, the painting of the Guild Hall “ very comely with colors,” and


with “ gelding the Queen's arms,” the re-gilding of the four maces and the
Alderman’s staff, the setting-up of two stages for “ pageants,” the one at the
Grass Cross and the other in St. Alban’s Street end, at St. Helen’s Church.
Then Mr. Bell, as “ deputy to Sir John Throckmorton, Knight, our Recorder,”
was to be spoken with “ touching the oration, and to be rewarded for his
paynes.” Also, the Grass Cross and the statue of a king at Sidbury Gate
were to be “ set in colors.” On the day- of the Queen’s visit, Mr. Bayliff,
the Aldermen, and the High Chamberlain, clad in scarlet, were to have “their
horses in reddyness at Salt Lane end in the Foregate Street to meet her
Majestic and to bear their maces on horseback before her Majestic.” The
twenty-four members of. the Council, if they had been Bailiffs, were to wear
scarlet gowns faced with .black satin, with doublets of satin, while the others
were'to “be dressed in murrey and gray.' “The forty-eight in their livery gowns
cf velvet tin.’ grayhe, r fair and -comely, with the. rest, of the Freemen and every

Bishop. Alighting at a farmhouse* without the gates, that she might attire
herself, Elizabeth presently appeared before the expectant citizens m all the
splendour of embroidered gown, lace ruff, and jewel-bedecked head dress. From
Worcester, Elizabeth rode out to visit the neighbouring gentry, to hunt in their
parks, or feast in their dining-halls. Mr. Habington, the Queen’s cofferer,
* “ Whystons Farme.” From the garden of this house a large pear tree in full fruit was removed and placed
at the Cross on this occasion. This was probably done because of the ancient celebrity of Worcestershire
pears. It is said, but without authority that I can find, that Elizabeth upon seeing the tree ordered the
black pears to be added to the City arms. This coat, if appearance count for anything, is more ancient than
Elizabeth’s time.

entertained her in his new house at Hindlip ; in his park of Hallow she
hunted, and with a bow killed one buck and hit another. Having spent ten
days in Worcester, Elizabeth proceeded towards Gloucester, taking leave of
Worcestershire subjects “at the uttermost part of the countrie between Elmley
and the castle of Suydley.” It was during these festivities that the Queen
is believed to have first taken notice of Sir John Pakington, of Hampton

Lovett and Westwood, and to have invited him to Court, where, “ for his
brave looks,” she made him a Knight of the Hath. A portrait, hanging
in the Hall at Westwood, represents Sir John as a handsome man of
great stature and abnormally long legs. Sir John lived magnificently, sharing
the Queen’s favour with the Earl of Leicester, being called “ Temperance ” and

the spoils of the monasteries. A former Sir John, who died in 1550, had
been an eminent lawyer : he had two daughters, one married to the notorious
Sir John Scudamore, the other to Sir John Lyttelton, of Frankley. To his
brother Ilumfrey he devised the manor of Chaddesley Corbet; to his second
brother Robert, Hampton Lovett and Westwood, with the park and ancient nunnery
there. This Sir Robert was the grandfather of the Queen’s favourite.* The

accordingly he resorted to various means of obtaining money: among other
favours he received from the Queen a monopoly for starch, which led to
disputes with certain dealers in this useful commodity. In 1592, appeared

seen in the accompanying bird’s-eye-view. At the Dissolution, the nunnery of
Westwood, then valued at Bs., was given to the Sir John Pakington of
that day, whose seat was Hampton Lovett hard by, which manor he had pur-
chased from Lord Monteagle. The old manor house being destroyed during
the civil wars, in the reign of Charles 1., Westwood was subsequently enlarged,
the wings and towers added, and became the chief residence of the family.
WESTWOOD HOUSE, WORCESTERSHIRE,
The house stands on an eminence, over-looking the Severn Valley; the pros-
pect being bounded on the west .by the chain of Malvern Hills ; the view
from the fore-court on a clear day is beautiful beyond description,, and at
evening-time, 'when' darkness steals over tT\e plain, and the shadows deepen,
the old mansion becomes weirddike and awe-inspiring in aspect.
A garden-house, or pavilion, formerly stood at four of the angles, of the
octagonal court. The front court retains its two pavilions, and in the middle
is a gateway, with a lodge on each side, carrying between them a perforated


screen, wherein the mullets and wheat garbs, the armorial bearings of the
house of Pakington, form the chief ornament; above is an elevated, oaken-
framed canopy, with a pyramidal roof of ogee outline. The great hall, the
staircase, and the magnificent saloon are the chief apartments of the mansion.
In this house lived “ the good Lady Pakington,” the reputed author of “ The
Whole Duty of Man,” the most famous devotional book of the 17th century.
Here, dwelt also the worthy fourth baronet, Sir John Pakington, who repre-
sented Worcestershire in Parliament for thirty-seven years —viz., from the age of
iy till his death, in 1727, aged 56. Sir John was, it is said, the original of Sir Roger

EFORE the Dissolution of Monasteries a- great part of Wor-

W j these large estates were parcelled out among people having
influence in the county and elsewhere. One result of
this redistribution of land was the rise to greater affluence
of numerous families from among the better -class of tenantry,
copy holders and small free-holders. This sudden accession of wealth sometimes
ended disastrously, and plunged the descendants of a long line of well-to-do
ancestors into abject poverty.
The older generation of land-owners managed their own estates; the younger
employed bailiffs, while they themselves spent their time according to . the
fashion of the age in which they lived, careless of their affairs, so long as
money was supplied for their present needs. When the last acre was mortgaged,
and the last guinea spent, the fall was pitiable in the extreme.
The records left by the Heralds, who visited the county four times between
1530 and 1682, furnish reliable information upon the sudden up-growth of :the
class of landed _ gentry, after the Dissolution of the religious houses. At the
first visitation, in 1530-3, only 26 Worcestershire families, bearing arms, entered
their pedigrees in the Heralds’ books. At the next visitation, in 1569* no
less than 53 pedigrees were recorded; so that in thirty-five years the number
of county families in Worcestershire had about doubled. By the time the
Heralds paid their last visit, in 1683, the 15 chief owners of the Domesday

freeholders, for it must be remembered that tire visitations do not contain the
names of all the landed gentry, though heraldry stooped to meet the classes
emerging from obscurity.*
The civil wars of the 17th century caused the downfall of many families
then beginning to recover from the effects of the Reformation. The loyalty of
Worcestershire was proverbial, but most of the gentlemen who were not “out
with the kingfigure as active partisans of the Parliament, The profligacy
of the reign of Charles 11. completed the havoc made by the rebellion.
The story of the family of Grevis of Moseley, is a typical example of the
rise and decay of the landed gentry in Worcestershire,! So far as this county
is concerned, the Grevis’ have ceased to exist among the gentry, although a
cadet of the house has carried on the name in a distant county, t and des-
cendants of the ancient stock still live upon the soil, over which their ancestors
exercised a lordly right.
An imperial descent has been claimed for the house of Grevis, but no evidence
of this is now known, and no pedigree of Grevis was entered in the early
visitations. The imperial double-headed eagle, borne on a silver shield, or
as a crest by the squires of Moseley, points to a high descent, and to this
day the eagle is borne by other Midland families, named Greaves, Greeves, or
Greves. Whether or not the blood of the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire
flows in the veins of the Grevis is now of small account. The first certain
fact known about the family is that they were people of substantial means,
living in Worcestershire and Warwickshire before the Reformation, the name

belonged to the better sort of yeomen, or small squires, who busied themselves
with home affairs, and lived peaceful and quiet lives on their estates, far
removed from the centres of political activity or civil strife. Now and
again a cadet of the house may have armed himself, and followed his over-
lord to battle, but no record is left of any doughty deeds performed, or
martial honours won, by any member of the family. Towards the end of the
15th century, there is evidence that the Grevis’s were becoming wealthy land-
owners. The following extracts from the Register of the Guild of St. Anne,
Knowle, prove that they were settled in this and the adjoining county before
the 16th century; — .
A. D, 1456. —Thomas Grevys and Alice, his wife, of Knolle.
. a.d, 1495-6. —John Greves and Margery, his wife, of Norton.
A. D. 1493. — John Grevis, syngulman,
a.d. 1506. — Thomas Grevys and Isabella, his wife, of Norton.
A.D. 15 it.— Isabel Greves, wife of Thomas Greves, of Norton.
The next entry relative to the family, states that Thomas Grevys (probably
a son of the last-named -Thomas) was one of the masters of the guild, a
position seldom attained by any but substantial men. This was in a.d, 1520,
the 12th year of the reign of Henry VII I.' .
■Thomas Grevis, like a worthy guild-master, brought with him to the annual
meeting of the guild all his friends, neighbours, and tenants, or at least as
many as he could persuade to join the religious and social society, over which
he was elected to preside. The benefits of the guild were many, including
temporal relief in dimes of sickness or distress, and masses for the repose of
the soul after death. No less than 134 Moseley and King’s Norton people
enrolled their names in the register of the guild of St. Anne, in that year
of grace, 1520.
Seven years before, that is to say in the year 1513, Thomas Grevis had
joined with his neighbours in rebuilding Moseley Church. A note among the
Prattinton MSS., at the Society of Antiquaries, states that—
“ John, Prior of Worcester (John Weddesbury, 1507-1518), at the instant labour of John Middle-

st. mart’s parish church, moseley.
This “steeple,” the only portion of the ancient chapel of Our Lady at
Moseley now remaining, has a picturesque west window—an excellent example of
late perpendicular work—worthy of careful preservation. Doubtless, Thomas Grevis
and Isabel, his wife, viewed that traceried window with delight, and regarded
the tower as in some measure a monument to themselves. Isabel, the wife
of Thomas Grevis, is supposed to have been one of the sisters, or daughters,
of John Middlemore of Hazelwell, Isabel being a common Christian name in
that family. If this be so, and the probabilities are in ’ favour of the alliance,
then we may account for the tide of prosperity which bore the family upwards
for three succeeding generations. The Middlemores ranked high among the

wealthy landowners settled in the north of Worcestershire, and possessed some
influence at court.
William Habington notes that “ this (Moseley) is the inheritance of Grevis, whose monuments
in King’s Norton do witness so much;” and in another place: “After such as inherited here
[i.e., King’s Norton) from their ancestors, I will come to those rvho, when King Henry VIH.
had dispersed the lands which were devoted to religious houses among his favourites and
followers, received the same, either in gross from the King, or by retail from his patentees, of
whom the lirst here was Sir Rafe Sadler, Knight, to whom the King (35 Henry VIII., 1543)
gave the Manor of Monihrlls in King’s Norton, which, before the dissolution, belonged to the
College of West bury, near Bristol. . . . . ; and, lastly, Thomas Grevis, the son and heir of
Thomas Grcvis, had some parcels of land (20 Eliz., 1577-S), belonging to the Manor of
Monihills.” (I’ratlinton M.S.) In another place Hahinglon adds. “Three miles cast from
Kingesnorton is the chapped of Moseley handsomely buylded and hath in the cast wyndowe of
the body thereof, party per pale indented argent and sables, quarterage azure, a trend fusil ley
or. Breminghm.”
Besides a portion of the Manor of Monihull the Grevis family probably
obtained grants of church land elsewhere. Evidently they were people of im-
portance in their own neighbourhood. Thomas Grevis seems to have thought it
incumbent upon him, for the honour of his house, to have a new coat of arms
devised. He applied to Heralds’ College, and in due time obtained a grant
of arms from Garter Wrothsley in 1528. The Heralds granted a new crest —
a squirrel sejeani bendy sinister of. four argent and sable , holding between his
paws an escalop shell £?>a—as well as arms ■ but the descendants of Thomas
Grevis appear to have been dissatisfied with the grant, for they discarded the
squirrel, and assumed the ancient device of their ancestors — an eagle displayed
with two heads sable.
It is needless to trace the family tree through all its branches. During the
reign of Elizabeth, the squires of Moseley increased in wealth, and the tide of
prosperity reached its - highest point in the days of Sir Richard Grevis, who
received knighthood from the hands of James I.
Sir Richard married a worthy woman of royal descent, Ann, daughter of
Thomas Leighton of Watlesborough, in Shropshire, by whom he had a numerous
family. His mother was the daughter of Richard Green of Wykin, near
Coventry. Sir Richard served as High Sheriff of the county, in 1604 ; he
was a Justice of the Peace, and Deputy Lieutenant to King Charles I. in his
Principality of Wales, and appears to have been in all respects a model


knight j fond of hunting, hospitable, a staunch supporter of Church and King,
yet humane enough to shelter the Puritan clergy in his neighbourhood from
the religious persecution of the times ; a good landlord, and a shrewd man of
business, increasing rather than lessening his patrimony,
Thomas Hall, Pastor of King’s Norton, who knew Sir Richard, gives an
interesting glimpse of the Knight of Moseley, in an address to his beloved
parishioners, prefixed to a quarto tract, entitled “The Pulpit Guarded,” and
dated at King’s Norton, January, 1651.
“ Tis your glory and my comfort, that when other people, hy their pride and censorious-
ness, by their sects and schisms, are a dayly vexation and heart-breaking to their ministers,
yet you have been unanimous, though you be a great body, and many of you a knowing
people, having enjoyed the means in one part of the parish for almost fifty years together,
and that by a succession of very eminent and able Divines, conformable Nonconformists,
conformable to the Canon of the Scripture, though not to the Bishops Canons : Where the Lord
raised up that valiant and religious knight, Sir Richard Greavis, who, hy his wisdom and
courage, sheltered these reverend ministers from those Episcopal ' storms, which otherwise had
fallen upon them,”
Sir Richard Grevis made a will, dated June 20, 1632, in which he mentions
that the greater part of his freehold estates were already settled upon his son
Thomas, except his lands in Warwickshire. He leaves to his second son,
Edward, all his lands and tenements in the parish of Solihull, the free warrens
of Yardley and Solihull, lately granted him by the King; and the lease of the
manor and parsonage of Solihull, which Samuel Marrow, Esq. (Lord of the
Manor of Birmingham), and Thomas Marrow, gent., had leased to him for 99
years. To his son, Richard, he leaves all his lands and tenements in Bicken-
hill, Lyndon, Castle Bromwich, Little Bromwich, Bordesley, and Sutton Coldfield,
in the county of Warwick, and the lease of the Manor, of Lee, in the parish
of Yardley. To his youngest daughter, Mary, he leaves leasehold houses and
lands at Sheldon. To his daughter Merrell, he leaves but 40s. “to buy her a
ring,” and 10s. to each of her children. Merrell being married to Edward Owen
of Woodhouse, in the county of Salop, had most likely received a substantial
dower, and this may account for the smallness of the bequest.
Fortunately for himself, the wealthy old knight died just before the civil war
commenced. He was buried in the chancel of King’s Norton Church, under

FAMILY VICISSITUDES.


a fair tomb of alabaster. This monument now (1894) removed from the
chancel to the tower is a fine example of a class of memorial sculpture
common in Worcestershire. Life-sized effigies of Sir Richard and his lady rest
upon a handsome altar-tomb, the panels of which contain the arms of Grevis
impaling Leighton with 10 quarterings, and Grevis impaling Green. On the
wall above the tomb, are the small kneeling figures of the four sons and
four daughters of this worthy couple, canopied with olive branches; while
below the figures, issuing from the shield of Grevis and Leighton, are two
clasped hands. Two vine tendrils, rising from the top of the altar-tomb, pass
through the clasped hands, and extend upwards, till they reach a projecting
cornice, along which they spread, forming an ornament of leaves and bunches
of grapes. The olives and the vines seem to allude to the words of the
Psalmist: —
“Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the side of thy house;
Thy children, like olive plants round about thy table,” —Psalm cxxviii. j.
Beneath the groups of children are the following quaint lines: —
Whom neither bribes, nor servile fears have swaide
From Vertuc’s centre, in this urne is laid.
The aire was justice that his body breathed,
And peace its being, till his sou! had leaved;
Being just in peace, he spent his time, his paines,
And therefore justly now in peace he reignes,
On the left side, on another tablet, the inscription continues: —
His hart was fixed on heaven, and he stood,
Not for his owne, but for his countries good.
His mind was nobly balanced, not to sell
His soule for wealth, yet us’d his tallant well,
Wherefore his name hath broke detraction’s fetters,
And well abides the touch in golden letters.
This is engraved on “ touch stone ” in gold letters, wherefore the last allusion.
Thomas Grevis, Sir Richard’s eldest surviving son, married Mary Ward, daughter
of one of the Norfolk family of that name, and a kinswoman of the Queen’s
goldsmith, whose only son, Humble Ward, married the heiress of the Buttons,
barons of Dudley. This alliance accounts for the entry in King’s Norton
register ;


“May 19th, 1663, Charles Grevis,' baptised; godparents, Sir Roger Bargaine, Thomas
Archer, Esq., and Lady Ward.
This Charles was son of Sir Richard's youngest son, Colonel Richard Grevis,
whose wife was the daughter of Thomas Henshaw, citizen of London, probably
a friend of the Queen’s goldsmith.
The resources of the family were first crippled during the civil wars, when
Colonel Richard Grevis and his elder brother took up arms for the King; but
the names of these brothers do not appear amongst those who compounded for
their estates. There are, however, several “ orders ” concerning them.
On Januaiy 22, 1652-3, Colonel Greaves was allowed to have six months’
liberty, on renewing his former security, and on condition that he abode at,
or within, five miles of his mother’s house (at Moseley) in the county of
Worcester, and appeared when demanded.
On April 29, 1652, an order was granted by the Council of State, on the
petition of Richard Graves, that liberty might be given him to remove with his
mother, Lady Ann Grevis, from Moseley, in Worcestershire, to Coventry, and
there to remain on the former terms.
Thus it would seem the Colonel reversed the order of things, and sent
himself to Coventry, instead of being sent to that city by the Puritans, who
at that time were accustomed to keep Royalists in durance there.
Thomas Grevis died in 1675, leaving no male issue, so the estates passed to
his nephew Richard, son of Colonel Grevis. This Richard made an alliance
with the old Royalist family of Winford of Astley. Sir John Winford, the
bride’s father, fought at the battle of Worcester, and compounded for his estate
with the Parliamentary Commissioners for 135., but did not live to see
h:s daughter married, though he left,her a marriage portion of Richard
settled upon her an estate at Yardley, and entailed upon his family the greater
portion of his King’s Norton and Yardley property.
Very soon the squire and his lady found their income inadequate to meet
their expenses. In 1655, a mortgage was obtained on some outlying portions
of the estate, but death claimed Richard Grevis in 168 S, and he was gathered
to his fathers in the family vault at King’s Norton. His brother, Benjamin,
succeeded him; a prudent man, who for a time stemmed the tide of ruin,


but died without retrieving the fortunes of the house. Benjamin married twice,
first, Jane Hunt of Ilarborne, in Staffordshire, a lady of good family, connected
with the Cloptons of Stratford. His second wife was the daughter of Booth
Allestry of Witton, of ancient Midland stock.
With Richard Grevis the fortunes of the house began to decline. By
his will he directed that certain estates in Moseley should be sold “to pay
his debts”—ominous words—and for the payment of the remainder he empowered
his wife to fell the timber upon all his estates; and, further, if that were
insufficient, the whole of the estates were to be chargeable therewith.
Squire Richard must have spent a merry life, and it may be that the names
of some of the old inns upon his estate recall the amusements in which he
took delight, and in which he wasted his substance, according to the fashion
of the age. The “Fox and Dogs,” upon the King’s Heath, is no longer a house
of refreshment, but "the “Bull’s Head” and the “Fighting Cocks,” exist to this
day at Moseley, reminding the wayfarer of the old sports of bull-baiting and
cock-fighting, precursors of the athletic games of modern England.
Benjamin objected to felling the timber, some of which was as fine as any in
the county, and by other means provided money for paying his brother’s debts.
After Benjamin’s death, in 1733, his son, Richard, continued the downward
course. A long string of sales and mortgages followed. A windfall from the
Hunt family of an estate known by the curious name of the “Ruck of Stones,”
at Harborne was soon mortgaged and sold. Had this single farm been kept till
the present time, it would have yielded a large income, the land having become
part of Smethwick, and upon it hundreds of houses have been built.
The last Richard Grevis died August, 25th, 1759, aged 63 years, and, except a
heap of old mortgages, and the following brief notice in Aris’s Birmingham
Gazette, there is little record left of his doings:—
“On Saturday morning died, at Moseley Hall, near this town, in the 63rd year of his age,
Richard Grevis, Esq,, one of His Majesty’s deputy lieutenants and justice of the peace for the
county of Worcester. He was a gentleman of polite understanding, humane and courteous
deportment, adorned private life, with every virtue, and cultivated a calm universal benevolence
for all mankind.”
This is the portrait of a fine old English gentleman, but it is only one side


of the picture; behind is an incubus of ever-increasing debt. A curious con-
trast is presented by a notice in the same Journal of the death, thirty years
later, of the son and heir of this last Richard Grevis of Moseley.
After the old squire’s death, disputes arose between the trustee and the testator’s
widow, the latter refusing to accept the interest of in lieu of dower,
and the former declining to act in the trust Henshaw Grevis, the heir, seems
to have been forced by circumstances and disposition to submit to the lengthy
arrangements of his father’s will, and in the year 1766, the “capital messuage,
called Moseley Hall, with all the lands, &c., thereunto belonging,” and estates
in Yardley, King’s Norton, and Harborne were sold, the debts paid, and the
small remainder divided between the children. The second son, Charles,
receiving his portion, entered the army, married an heiress and so continued
the family name. The eldest son, Henshaw, was compelled to mortgage the
last remnant of his estate in 1770, in order to pay the balance owing to the
trustees. He was then reduced to abject poverty, and was working in a gravel
pit at Moseley. The “ abstract of title,” dirty and stained by the red gravel upon
the hands of the fallen squire, is carefully preserved by a gentleman at Moseley,
as a memorial of departed grandeur, and the fleeting nature of riches.
In 1782 Henshaw Greaves had betaken himself to Birmingham, where he
lived in a back house, on the south side of Edgbaston Street, for which he
paid three guineas per annum, or rather less than is. 3d. per week. Four years
later, Henshaw figures as a defendant in the Birmingham Court of Requests.
His appearance there has been graphically described by William Hutton, the
Birmingham historian, who happened to be judge of the court at that time.
The account is full of quaint philosophy and humour, and no apology is needed
for the length of the quotation. *
11 There is nothing more common in the decline of prosperity than, that the idea of a gentle-
man is all that is left of the gentleman ; this is the last spark in the dying embers of grea ness.
There is nothing more detrimental than this idea, for it prevents a man entering with spirit
into that drudgery necessary for existence. He feeds upon a departed shadow, when alas ! a
shadow is sometimes all he has to feed upon.
* The original passage may he found in an amusing and scarce book, entitled, M Courts of Requests,” by \V,
Hutton, Birmingham, ISO 6.


“Among 170 defendants called before the court, July 21, 1786. was Henshaw Grevis,
Esq. Struck with a name with which I was well acquainted, I asked if the person appeared ?
when a meagre figure, near sixty, came forward, and behaved with all the humility of manners
that fancy could paint j the silent tear seemed to rise in his own eye, and demanded mine.
Though his whole apparel could not be worth eighteen-pence, I well remembered to have seen
him, thirty years before, completely mounted, and dressed in green velvet, with a hunter’s cap
and girdle, at the head of his pack. Like Actceon, he had formerly hunted with his
own hounds j perhaps, like him, had been devoured by them. At other times, the arms he
carried were a gun and ornamental pouch; his companions were his dogs, and the regions he
commanded—the earth and the air. But now his gun was metamorphosed into a spade; his
companions were common labourers upon the turnpike road ; and the principal scene of action
was a gravel pit.

. “His family had produced many amiable characters. They figure in history as commanders
in the civil wars under Charles I.; and, however contrary the sentiment, as succouring the
ejected ministers, who, in 1662, were discharged from the establishment by the violence of the
times. I asked him how long his ancestors were residents at Moseley Hall ? He answered,
nearly from the Conquest.

“ The debt charged upon this unhappy son of adverse fortune was seventeen shillings. It
appeared to be a security to the plaintiff to cover a misdemeanour of the son, which the
court, out of tenderness, did not choose to enquire into.
“As fate, therefore, seemed particularly to mark him for destruction, beyond any of his race,
for his ancestors, being strangers to poverty, could not dread its effects, and his successors,
inured to penury, will not regret the loss of that affluence they never knew, and as he
alone, the sport of adversity, was tantalized with the pleasing views of prosperity, and then
plunged into the depth of distress, the court, out of compassion to fallen greatness, charged
the payments at the low rate of two shillings a month; postponed the first for three months,
and recommended lenity to the plaintiff, who rather exulted in his calamity, and whose heart,
seared by poverty, had lost every tender feeling.”
The old man, who appealed for sympathy to William Hutton, died three
years later. The entry of his burial in King’s Norton Parish Register, reads:
“Ancheath Grevis,” which is an obvious error.
In Arises Birmingham Gazeiie t on Monday, August 25th, 17S8, appeared the
following announcement:—
“On Friday last, Henshaw Gravis, who, though he was heir to one of the oldest and most
opulent families in this neighbourhood (through the dissipation and extravagance of his parents),
died in the humble capacity of distributor of this paper to and in Leicestershire.”
Henshaw Grevis had five daughters, all of whom married ; their descendants
are still living in the neighbourhood. Tire “ son ” mentioned by Hutton,


probably, was a son-in-law, for Henshaw’s only son, Richard, died under two
years of age, and was buried at King’s Norton.
Moseley Hall, a stone-built mansion, standing in the midst of a beautiful park,
was enlarged by John Taylor, the Birmingham banker and manufacturer, who
let it to Lady Carhampton, the mother of Anne Lutterell, the beautiful Duchess
of Cumberland, Neither years nor infirmities (she was blind), nor the alliance
of her daughter with royalty, were able to protect Lady Carhampton from the
fury of the Birmingham roiters, in 1791. The house in which she lived
belonged to a dissenter, and it must be destroyed. A Birmingham corres-
pondent to the London papers thus records the event: —
" Last night (Saturday, July 16th, 1791), the people of Birmingham were the trembling
spectators of the tremendous conflagration of Moseley Hall, the property of John Taylor, Esq.,
but in the occupation of Lady Carhampton,
"Fortunately, Lady Carhampton, who is blind, was removed to a place of safety by Sir
Robert Lawley, who took her in his own carriage to Canwell.
It would seem as if Fate had determined to remove all traces of the Grevis
family from Moseley. The last heir had died in poverty and obscurity; the
family mansion, which appears to have been built in the 17th century, was
burnt in 1791, and the older timber-frame house in the village street, probably
the original home of the family, and known in later times as “ Burrish’s,” from
the name of the then tenant, was demolished in 1842.* But Moseley Hall
was rebuilt; some of its blackened walls being incorporated in the new house
may still be distinguished in the present mansion, which was purchased from
the Taylor family by Mr. Richard Cadbury, in 1891, and now, after many
vicissitudes, serves the purpose of a home for convalescent children.
*“ The ancient Mansion House stood near the present Lodge, it was built entirely of wood, and wattled
between the timbers, no bricks appeared except in the chimneys. The rooms were walnscotted with oak, and
there was a great deal of carved wood-work about the house. There was a moat at the back, and the fold
yard and shedding for the cattle were In front next the road, fenced by a low wall. The land belonging to
this house extended to where Park Hill now is, and was fenced from the read by a hedge with trees in it.
The road was much wider than now, and there was a margin of turf three or four yards wide. This estate
belonged to Robert Blayney, who sold it in 1542 to James Taylor, for about .£3OO per acre. The old house
was immediately (184 a) pulled down by Mr. Johns, who had the materials (I had some of the timber and
cleft oak laths). The fields were thrown Into the park, and the present high wall along the road erected.”—
(“Pencil-note Recollections of Moseley" in 1819, by the late Thomas Eickley). This wall has lately (1893) been
removed, and the road widened again. Some of the old panelling was removed to the new farm house a
little below the present Chantry Road; at the demolition of the farm in 1892, the panelling was bought for
the Hall of the Guild of Handicraft (Lawrence Street, Birmingham),

landscape is beautiful.
In a remote corner of the forest, some six miles from Droitwich, are four
villages —Huddington, Himbleton, Oddingly, and Crowle—all of which have
interesting historical associations. At Crowle, the Priors of Worcester had


a manor-house,' and there Prior Moore retired on an ample pension, when
the storms of reformation swept monastries from England. At Oddingly,
in the present century, a horrible and cold-blooded murder was committed
by some of the parishioners, who caused their Vicar to be shot, because
the poor man demanded the payment of a heavy tithe.
Huddington and Himbleton are equally famous from their connection with
the family of Wintour, two members of which were deeply implicated in

ton may yet be seen the mansion
of the Wintours, and the little
church containing their monument; at
Himbleton the stained glass windows
of the church still retain fragments
of painted glass, with the armorial de-
vices of this ancient house. The story
of the Gunpowder Plot is too w T ell
known to be repeated here, but it
is not so generally known that in this
moated manor house, while the lords
thereof were plotting in London, there
were anxious women waiting to hear
news of the mysterious adventure, which was to give liberty to the oppressed
adherents of the old religion.
Behind the house there is an avenue of trees called “ Lady Wintour’s
Walk,” where, according to a tradition believed in the village, the lady was
accustomed to await by night the furtive visits of her husband ; and, -even
now, the headless spectre of Lady Wintour is said to pace up and down
beneath the shadow of those old trees,* Yet another tradition lingers in
this neighbourhood : It is said that, in November, 1605, the Wintours had
collected a great store of arms and ammunition, and many horses at Hud-
dington Court, to be in readiness against. the expected rising. When the

watch was kept at one of the upper windows; if the messenger, when he
reached a hill at some little distance from the court, weaved his hat all was
well, but if the express came down hill with his hat on his head, it was
a token that the plot had miscarried, and that everyone must shift for
himself.
HUDDINGTON COURT, NEAR DROITWICH.
When the plot was: hatching, Catesby went from Bath to Huddington,
on a visit to Robert Wintour ; and, sending for Humphrey and Stephen
Littleton of Holbeach, informed them of his proposed expedition to join the
Archduke with a troop of 300 English horse in Flanders, and offered to
give Stephen Littleton the command. What further schemes Catesby
revealed may well be guessed, but the Flanders expedition provided an
excuse for the preparations soon afterwards made at .Huddington.


The head of the family at that time was Robert Wintour, or Winter,
as he is now usually called. His ancestors had long been settled in
Worcestershire, and w T ere at Droitwich in the time of Henry VI. He had
married the daughter of John Talbot of Grafton, a man of great wealth and
influence in the county. By reason of this marriage the Wintour’s estates
ultimately came to the Earls of Shrewsbury.* The Wintours were not
small county squires, as is generally represented, but people of great wealth
and noble descent. One of the family, an uncle of Robert, is famous in
history for the part he played in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, for
which brave act Queen Elizabeth granted him the Manor of Lidney in
Gloucestershire. The Wintours were connected with the Nevilles, Throck-
mortons, Catesbys, Treshams, Hungerfords, and Cookseys, and were entitled
to quarter upon their shield the arms of some of these families.

Robert and Thomas Wintour were both

and taken prisoner; Robert escaped, and
after many adventures on the borders of
Worcestershire, was at last captured. From
Holbech, Stephen Littleton and Robert Win-

early they came to the house of one Perkes at Hagley. A present of

receive guests upon whose head there was a price, and, bringing them to
a barley mow in his barn, he hid them there for nine days. On the
ninth night, it happened that a drunken friend of the farmer’s finding
himself belated came to the barn. The adventure is described in the
Harleian MSS. (No. 560) as follows :
“In the dead time of night, when quiet sleep locks up the lids of all eyes, and no doubt
did the same to Winter and Littleton, if men in such fears are capable of the honest mind’s
commodity, comes Poynter to the barn, and climbing up upon the mow, with as much dread
to himself as amazement to the others, he fell down into the made hole upon them. Their
perplexity in this strange adventure on the one side, and his no less on the other, meeting
in such unexpected hap together, the black-faced night so countenancing the case that neither
party knew how or which way to resolve themselves therein.”
HAGLEY HALL, WORCESTERSHIRE.

In the morning, the farmer came and explained matters, but the con*
spirators thought it prudent to keep their uninvited guest, and they con-
tinued altogether in their hole among the straw for four days longer,
when Poynter, under pretence of dressing a wound on his leg, slipped out
of the barn and escaped.
Now it so happened that Mrs. Littleton had about that time gone to
London to explain the reason of the empounding of several horses, belonging-
to Sir Everard Digby, which, after his flight, pursuit, and apprehension,

were found straying upon her lordship. Humphrey Littleton, taking advan-
tage of his sister’s absence from Hagley, and fearing that Poynter might
betray the fugitives, brought them that night to Hagley House, and let
the cook into the secret, telling him “ because it was so late to kill some
hen or chickens about the house to serve and fit the present occasion.’’
Full nimbly did the cook bestir himself, and after supper sought
his mother’s cottage in the park, and advised that good dame to betray
his master’s guests. Next morning the house was searched and the con-
spirators captured. Both the Wintours were executed, and poor Dame

Yet another old Worcestershire house must be referred to in connexion
with the Gunpowder Plot—Hindlip Hall, the seat of the Habingtons.
Hindlip was a new house when Queen Elizabeth visited it in 1575? an d


the date 1572 on one of the windows probably marked the year of its
erection. Unfortunately, the fine old mansion has been pulled down; it
was one of the most remarkable houses in England, and had a most
romantic story ; within its venerable walls were secret chambers more
numerous and more cunningly contrived than in any other mansion. Here the
Jesuit priests, who had received the confessions of the conspirators, found
an hospitable asylum, and here Sir Henry Bromley tracked and captured

Mr. Habington, through the influence of powerful friends, escaped with

probably owe a most valuable collection for the history of Worcestershire ;
for Habington, though he could not cross the county boundary, visited
every parish within it and made notes of what he saw and heard.


THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY.
Thomas, Lord Coventry, was born at Croome D’Abitot, in 1578. He was the son of Thomas
Coventry, Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and having raised himself to his high office
by his great knowledge of the laws, and having adorned it by the most expert and impartial
correction of the offences of them, he died when law and equity were themselves hastening
to dissolution. He was buried at Croome, January 14th, 1639.

Worcester fcudng the Civil Mar
ST the commencement of the Civil War, in 1642, -in less than
a month after the unfurling of the royal standard upon the
breezy hill at Nottingham, Worcester became the scene of
the contest between the King - and Parliament. Two causes
operated to bring Worcester into prominence during the Civil
War; First, the geographical position of the place upon the
Severn, at one of the passages into Wales ; second, the traditional loyalty of
the citizens. Gloucester was a stronger city, but Gloucester was at heart
republican. It is significant that the opening and closing scenes of the intestine
strife were enacted before the gates of Worcester.
Instructions for the Commissioners of Array had been issued in June; those
for Worcestershire being addressed to “ our trusty and welbbeloved Edward
Lord Dudley and Thomas Lord Coventry.” Lord Dudley’s ilbhealth prevented


his taking an active part in the war, but Lord Coventry, son of the great
Lord Keeper, suffered much for his faithful devotion to the royal cause. Sir
Thomas Littleton and Sir Henry Herbert, both active Royalists, were attacked
by a party of horse sent by “ Fox the tinker,” from Edgbaston to Ticknell
Manor, Bevvdley, in May, 1(144, when Sir Thomas was taken prisoner. To
satisfy the military requirements, iSs. od. was assessed on the county
monthly; this w r as afterwards raised to monthly (printed agreement in the
British Museum). The city of Worcester was slightly fortified, and a rate of
per month w T as levied on the city.
Clarendon states, that no sooner had King Charles removed from Nottingham
than Essex withdrew with his army from Northampton and marched towards
Worcester,* wherupon Prince Rupert with his cavalry, at the King's command,
advanced towards that city. The Prince arrived at Worcester first, and his men,
weary with their long march, were resting, when a strong party of dragoons,
forming the advance guard of the Parliamentary army, under the command of
Nathaniel Fiennes, son of Lord Say, came, very early in the morning, to
surprise the town, wdrich lay open enough to have been entered in many
places, though in some it still had old decaying walls ; and, at the entrances
into the city, w r eak and rotten gates to be shut, but without either lock or bolt.
The small guard w'hich the Prince had set, concluding all to he then secure,
had gone to rest, so that the enemy approached to within musket shot of the
wall without being discovered. Seeing the gates dosed, and not knowing what
force might he within, Captain Fiennes ordered a retreat. The Royalists were
by this time aw*are of their danger and, saddling their w'earied horses, set out
in pursuit of the flying enemy, but could not overtake them.
The temperament of the cavalier being sanguine, the gravity of a situation
w r as seldom realized till too late, so it happened on this occasion that, instead
of attending at once to securing their position, the gallant Princes, Rupert
and Maurice, having rested and breakfasted, went forth to the Pitchcroft, —a
green field by the river—without the walls, there to amuse themselves and
their soldiers with shooting at effigies of the Parliamentary leaders. Lord
Coventry, Sir William Russell of Strensham and Sir John Byron accompanied

the Princes. Meanwhile, the enemy had quietly surrounded the city, and
suddenly, a party of 500 horse attacked the Royalists, who retired in confusion
into the town, followed by their assailants, under the command of Colonels
Sandys and Austin. The battle was continued in the streets, and, at midnight
the Royalists evacuated the place, though claiming the victory. * On the
following day, very early, the Mayor and Alderman sent one Master Ray,
captain of the trained bands of Worcester, to Essex to inform him that the
cavaliers were gone, and to beg him not to deal harshly with the citizens.
Master Ray was kept till the truth of his report could be verified, and then
the Earl entered Worcester —his soldiers pillaged the city and Cathedral. The
citizens were forced to pay a ransom of and to guarantee a loan of
to Parliament. In the Market Place a gallows was erected, and
some of the chief citizens, convicted of being in arms for the king, were
hung thereon. The Chamberlain’s accounts for the year contain the following
significant entry:—

The writer states that the skirmish began “about foure of the clocke in the afternoone," and the reason of
the fight “ that the cavaliers had very cunningly sent a report to those jo troop, pretending it came from

The year 1643 was an eventful one for Worcestershire. The King, having
made Oxford his head-quarters was in constant communication with his loyal
subjects in this county, and the fortifications of the city were strengthened by
Prince Rupert. Three hundred men were , daily employed in the trenches,
and an order was passed that all strangers, ministers, as prebends, deans,
singing men, or any, whatsoever, living within the fortifications, should send a
man, or pay a shilling a day on neglect; every man to bring a spade,
shovel, or pick-axe. Charges were made for gunpowder, fuel for guards,
bricks for mending the city wails and the tower on the bridge, for a chain
drawn across the Severn, for a hogshead of claret, twenty gallons of sack, and
a tierce of white wine, presented to Prince Maurice when at Upton; in all,
jQxb 17s, rod. Such charges were often repeated, for the citizens had to
pay both sides.
In the meantime the Queen, having returned from Holland, landed in
Yorkshire, and was marching southward with reinforcements. On Sunday,
July 9th, the heroic Henrietta Maria arrived at Walsall, in Staffordshire, and
on the next day, continuing the march, entered Worcestershire, and halted at
King’s Norton—her own manor—where a lodging was provided for Her
Majesty’s reception, at the ancient timber-built house, adjoining the Church-
yard, on the south side.*
About the Queen rode an escort of gallant cavaliers, and behind came 3000
horsemen and 30 companies of foot soldiers, guarding a long line of baggage
wagons, and a train of artillery. On Monday night, July 10th, the army
encamped around the village of King’s Norton. Next morning they were on

this old house still stands; the room, on the first story, in the north wing with a window looking out upon

Oratory," wherein is a recess in the wall said to have contained a crucifix. Many years ago, when the Lea
family lived here, a letter addressed to, or written by, Queen Henrietta Maria was found, behind a mantelpiece
in one of the rooms. This was related to me by one of the family who had seen the letter. Tradition
associates the house with Queen Elizabeth, but from an entry in Dugdale’s Diary—£d. Hamper—there is no
doubt that the Queen of Charles 1. did stay at King’s Norton, and probably at this house.

WORCESTER DURING THE CIVIL WAR.


CHURCH OF ST. NICHOLAS AND ANCIENT SCHOOL-HOUSE, KING’S NORTON.
(From a Drawing by Oliver Baker.)
The ancient timber-built grammar school was probably built in the latter part of 14th, or early in the 15th,
century, and doubtless was connected with one of the chantries. It was used as a school-house before the Refor-
mation, and probably also as a priest’s house. The school was continued with a smaller endowment by King
Edward VI. This most Interesting building has recently been carefully repaired in part: funds are wanting to
complete the work. The east window is one of the few remaining examples of wooden tracery.


the' march again, and before nightfall had crossed the county boundary into
Warwickshire, and reached Stratford-upon-Avon, where the Queen lodged at Shake-
speare’s house, New Place. Prince Rupert arrived soon afterwards and escorted
his kinswoman to the field of Kineton, under Edge Hills, where King Charles
was waiting to receive her. Thence they marched to Oxford in triumph. The
Queen had proved herself a better general than the King; the martial qualities
of her valiant father, Henry IV. of Trance, seemed to have been inherited by
Henrietta Maria, and the successful march from Yorkshire to Oxford stands out
from among the unsuccessful or blundering achievements of the Royalists like
one bright star in a clouded firmament.
In the year 1644, while Essex and Waller were besieging Oxford the King
escaped, and by forced marches came to Worcester, Waller following him. The
loyalty of the town and the affections of the gentry of the county, who were
living there for better security, provided him with money, and shoes and
stockings for his soldiers. After a few days’ rest, Charles passed on to Rewdley
that he might keep the Severn between himself and Waller, but .when that
general marched up the river to a point between Shrewsbury and Bewdley, the
King suddenly returned to Oxford by way of Worcester and Evesham, and
defeated Waller at Copredy Bridge. While at Bewdley, Charles sent orders to
Prince Rupert to relieve York, and this led to the defeat at Marston Moor.
He also sent 3000 horse to relievo Dudley Castle then being besieged by the
Earl of Denbigh.*
Sir William Waller appeared before Worcester, and sending bis herald, or
“ Drum,” to the gate demanded the surrender of the city. The inhabitants
resolved not to admit the messenger, and signed to him to go away; but
when he would not return without delivering his message, he was shot.
Waller was so enraged at this, that he at once attacked the town, there
being nothing but an old gate, without bridge or work before it to oppose him;
but the citizens received him with such firmness that he was obliged to re-
treat with the loss of several officers and about twenty men. An entry in the
city accounts before quoted gives the following:—
The Rev. J. R. Barton, "A History of Cewdley," p. 40.


To the countrymen and soldiers who came to assist when the City was besieged by Sir
W. Waller and his army, £2 iSs. Bd.
Two purses to put in that was given by the City to his Majesty, Sd.
One ditto to Prince Rupert, containing Tioo, 4<.h
Ditto to Prince Maurice ~ ~ 4d,
Six axle-trees for his Majesty’s carriage, 4s.
To two guides for his Majesty’s carriage to bewdley, 4s. 6d.
Nothing of importance occurred at Worcester during 1645, the city was held
by Prince Rupert, and for a short time Prince Maurice filled the post of
Governor. The townspeople disliked the repeated demands for money, which
they could ill afford to pay, and the Prince called upon his troops to compel
the people to pay; nt one time there were 1800 soldiers in the garrison.
The King passed through the city on his march from Shipston on-Stour towards
Hereford. On 17th June, after the defeat at Naseby, be stayed again at
Jiewdley ; but Ticknell Palace had suffered so much at the hands of “Tinker
Fox” that the King was obliged to sleep at the Angel Inn in Load Street.
Hartlchury Castle was then being strongly fortified, and Colonel Sandys impressed
men from the district to help in the work.
On May nth, the King marched from Inkborough, with his own regiment of
foot and horse guards only, to Droitwich, the rest of the army being that night
at Bromsgrove. His majesty stayed at. Droitwich till Wednesday, and, meanwhile,
Prince Rupert sat down before Hawkesley House, King’s Norton belonging to
Mr. Middlemore. On Wednesday, Charles came to the leaguer before Hawkesley,
and just as be appeared in view the garrison delivered up the house on con-
dition that they should be spared the insults of the soldiers. The garrison
declined to fight when they saw the King. The house was pillaged, and then
set on fire.
The year 1646 brought fresh trouble to Worcester, Governor Washington
had succeeded Sir Martin Sandys, and . when Fairfax summoned him to
surrender the city he refused, and the blockade commenced. A heavy
assessment of weekly, for one month, was levied during the siege.
Waller encamped on Rainbow Hill, and when he was called away, Major-
General Reynesborough succeeded to the command. During June and July
the city was closely invested, the garrison bravely defending . their position.


Sometimes accidents happened to their own ordnance, as on June 2nd, when
a great iron culverin burst at St. Martin’s gate, and wounded the best
engineer, more frequently the enemy wrought destruction in the city, cannon
balls struck the Bishop’s palace, and Sir Rowland Berkley’s house, or falling
upon more humble tenements, killed the occupants in their beds. The guns
on the city walls, or on the quay, played upon St. John’s, killing people
in their houses, or battering down the church steeple.
Occasionally the garrison made a sally—a drunken dare-devil Cavalier, one
Captain Hodgkins, called “ Wicked Will,” with sixteen horse, attacked the
besieger’s court of guard in St. John’s, killed one man, and returned to the
city in safety, though so drunk that he fell twice by the way, and, being
half-asleep, was carried over the Severn in a boat.
WORCESTER HALF-CROWN, “ SIEGE-PIECE ” OF CHARLES I.
No public coins minted at Worcester are exlant from the 13th century till the troublous
times of Charles 1., and this half-crown—specimens of which are very rare, and valued at
from to £q ios., according to state of preservation—is the only Worcester siege-piece
known. It is creditable to Charles that he did not debase his coins, even when, from necessity,
some of the coins were struck by a common blacksmith.
The Worcester half-crown is in imitation of the established type with additions—the pears of
Worcestershire—to indicate the place of minting. Frequently loyal subjects contributed their
plate to supply the King’s necessity. Samuel Butler, the Worcestershire poet, alludes to this
in “ Hudibras,” Canto ii. } pt. i., as follows:
" Did saints for this bring in their plate,
And crowd as if they came too late? ’ t
And when they thought the cause had need on’t,
Happy was he that could be rid on’t.
Did they coin pots, bowls, and flaggons,
Int’ officers of horse and dragons 1”*
* See W. A. Cotton, "The Coins, Tokens, and Medals of Worcestershire,” p. 39.


Later, on July 6th, Captain “Wicked Will” made a second sally; behaved
most gallantly, and brought in seven prisoners.
An old journal kept by some one in the city during the siege records -
“All quiet this day, except about twelve o’clock the besiegers shot four pieces into the
town, and killed a poor man and his wife in bed in the Trinity.
Railing language passed between the guards on both sides; the besiegers calling the towns-
men Washington’s bastards (he was then Governor), Russell’s apes, &c., and the besieged calling
their enemy traitors, bade them go preach in a crab tree, &c.”
There is in the Bodleian Library a tract entitled—
“ A Copy of the Articles for the Surrender of the City of Worcester, with all the ordnances,
arms, and ammunition therein to Major-Gen, Rainsborow. With a copy of a Letter sent from the
Governor to him, and the manner of the Mutining in the Toun, which occasioned the same.
And how Sir Wm. Russell is to be delivered to the mercy of the Parliament, and the enemy
to deliver all their armes after they have marched a mile out of Worcester.
These are perused by the Original Papers, and published according to Order of Parliament.
London : Printed for F. Coles, 1646.”
The truth of the matter was that the citizens of Worcester only
surrendered when they heard that their King’s fortunes were hopeless. On
July 16th, Governor Washington sent a letter with an offer of surrender ;
“in conformity to His Majestie’s commands we doe not decline the rendring
of the city upon honourable and equitable conditions.” On July 19th, the
articles for the surrender of the city were signed ; they provided that the
City of Worcester with all forts, ordnances, arms, ammunition, stores, &c.,
be delivered “ without wilfull spoyle,” to his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax,
or his representative, on the 22nd of July, 1646, at xo o’clock in the
morning. That the Governor, the garrison, and all persons that will, shall
march out of Worcester with their horses, arms, and baggage to any place .
within a mile of the city, all horses and arms, except those allowed, to be
then delivered up ; all soldiers to be disbanded, and those who promise
never more to bear arms against the Parliament are to be allowed:—To
have the General’s pass and protection to go to any place they like with
all horses, arms and baggage properly belonging to ' them. Each Colonel
with three horses, each Lieut-Colonel and Sergeant-Major with two horses,
each Captain, Lieutenant, and Cornet with one horse. Every person not
under the rank of an esquire three horses and all arms and goods


properly belonging to them to be carried on their horses. All soldiers with
their swords and such baggage as they can carry.
Further, the city was not to be plundered, but Sir William Russell, then
residing in Worcester, was exempt from any benefit of these articles.
It was not till 1648 that any serious disturbance again took place in
Worcestershire, but in that year an association of “ divers knights, collonels,
gentlemen and others for the king” was attempted. If “A Letter from
the Committee of Worcester” contained in a 4to tract, of which there is
a copy in the British Museum, may be believed, the Governor of Hartle-
bury discovered a design of the cavaliers of Worcestershire, Salop, Stafford,
and Herefordshire for surprising Hereford. Colonel Dudley, Sir Francis Oatley,
Colonel Lane, Major Eliot, The Giffords of Chillington, Major Harcot, one
Broughton (Parson, of Wolverley), and divers others were in the plot to
surprise “ Dawley Castle and an house of Sir Bazill Brookes, near adjacent.”
Captain Jenet coming to Wolverley to the house of Parson Broughton there
found in a cornfield behind the house half an hundred-weight of powder, &c.,
and took Major Harcot and brought him prisoner to Hartlebury Castle. The
plot was discovered, and when the conspirators assembled they were captured.
Worcestershire folk at last grew tired of fighting, and, after Cromwell’s
death in 1658, we find neighbours sinking their old differences for the sake
of peace.

was appointed Secretary to the Lord President of Wales and Steward of Ludlow Castle. His
genius was remarkable, but he was not able to acquire a competence, and died in poverty in
1680. One of his admirers —Alderman Barber—caused a monument to be erected to his
memory in Westminster Abbey. Butler’s most enduring monument is the poem, “ Hudibras,”
a cavalier burlesque of the extravagant ideas and rigid manners of English Puritans during
the Civil War and Commonwealth.


OXR OF THE OAK BEDROOMS AT “THE COMMANDERY/’
Cromwell's Crowning flDercp.
ORCESTERSHIRE has borne a full share of the hardships
of war ; the city of Worcester has been besieged and
F captured many times, but the remembrance of all former
J sieges sinks into insignificance beside that of the Battle
of Worcester—Cromwell’s “ Crowning Mercy,”—last and
best known event in the military history of the Faithful City.
It was on the 22nd of August, 1651, that Charles 11. entered Worcester
with his Scotch a#my, and although the inhabitants had suffered severely for
their loyalty to his unhappy father, they welcomed the young monarch
heartily, proclaimed him King with due solemnity, and prepared to risk their
lives and what remained of their shattered fortunes in a last effort to restore
an absolute monarchy. This attachment of the citizens to their king, at a
time when most other cities and towns threw off their allegiance, and


the tide of popular feeling ran in favour of a republic, is remarkable ; but
even in loyal Worcester there were traitors to the King’s cause, and many
of the county families were either unable or unwilling to join the forlorn hope.
By order of the Common Council the gates were thrown open ; the
small parliamentary garrison fled to Pershore, and Charles entered the city
unopposed, being received at the Guildhall by Mr. Lysons, the Mayor,
and Mr. Bridges, the Sheriff.
In extreme haste the old fortifications were again strengthened, help being
demanded from the county, as appears from the following document,
addressed “To the constables and tything men of Salwarpe : —”
“CHARLES R.
“ You are hereby required to send out of your parish thirty able men, to work at the fortifi-
cations of this city, and in regard of the necessity to begin to-morrow morning (Monday, at
five o'clock), whereof you and they are not to faile as you tender our displeasure. Given at
our court at Worcester, the 24th of August, 1651.
“And you are to bringe with you spades, shovels, and pick-axes."*
On Sunday, August 24th, Mr. Crosby, an eloquent divine, preached in the
cathedral styling Charles, “in all causes, and over all persons, next under
God supreme head and governor,” and thereby offended the Scots. Generals
Leslie and Middleton began to be at variance ; Leslie growing more and
more sullen. After nightfall, Lord Derby with 30 horsemen entered the city ;
he was expected to bring reinforcements, but having met with reverses in
Lancashire, could not fulfil his promise.
On Tuesday, the 26th of August, Charles held a review on Pitchcroft of
such loyal subjects as came in answer to his urgent summons sent out a
few days previously. The attendance was not promising.
First came Francis Lord Talbot, afterwards Earl of Shrewsbury, with about
sixty horse; Mr. Mervin-Touchet, his lieutenant-colonel; Sir John Packington,
Sir Walter Blount, Sir Ralph Clare, Sir Roland Berkley, Sir John Winford,
Mr. Ralf Sheldon of Beoley, Mr. John Washburn of Witchinford, with
forty horse ; Mr. William Seldon of Finstall ; Mr. Thomas Acton, Captain
Benbow, Mr. Robert Blount of Kenswick, Mr. Robert Wigraore of Lucton,

Battle of Worcester, enables us to understand the position which Charles
had to defend. On the west is the river, and to prevent an out-flanking
movement on the part of the enemy, the bridge at Upton must be secured.*
The Teme, a western tributary of the Severn, may be crossed at Powick
Bridge, and Severn itself by Worcester Bridge. The city stands high above
the river, and the cathedral tower rises above the city ; there are walls and
gates; a fort—Fort Royal—has been constructed on the high ground to
the north of the London Road ; trenches extend thence to the city walls,
enclosing the suburb of Sidbury ; a little to the south-east is Red Hill.
Leaving Monk to guard Scotland, Cromwell had hastened southwards, and,
on August 27th, reached Stratford-upon-Avon, thence he marched through
Evesham and Pershore, towards Worcester, staying at Mr. Simon’s house at
White Lady Aston, and finally, taking up his quarters at Judge Berkeley’s
house at Spetchley ; his army encamping on the heights of Red Hill, near
Perry Wood. This army consisted of 30,000 men, and in ' all 80,000 were
believed to be within easy reach. There could only be one ending to this
affair; Charles was driven into a corner by an ' army. immensely larger and
better officered than his own; defeat was inevitable.
On the morning of Cromwell’s arrival, General Lambert, with a small
detachment came down to Upton Bridge, which Massey, who knew the
district, was supposed to be guarding. The middle arch had been blown
away, but for the convenience of the workmen, a plank was placed across
the gap. Massey’s careless soldiers, supposing all to be secure, were drinking
at an inn on the western side. Eighteen or twenty of Lambert’s dragoons
dismounted and “ straddled across ” the plank—or as some say, the parapet —
reached the other side, hastily repaired the bridge, and got possession of
Upton Church. General Massey, in great consternation, hastened from his
comfortable quarters at Severn End (Mr. Nicholas Lechmere’s) ; and a smart
fight commenced, in which he was wounded, and his men driven back on
Powick, by the steady courage of Lambert’s soldiers, who came across a ford
to support their eighteen brave comrades who had gained the bridge.
* The Bridge at Upton was the only one between Worcester and Gloucester. Leland in his “Itinerary”
speaks of a bridge of wood at Upton; it is mentioned in an Act of Parliament 20 Henry VIII., 1529, and
again In 1606, in an Act of James I.’s time, by which Act the bridge was ordered to be repaired.

On the 29th, after nightfall, fifteen hundred picked men, wearing their
shirts over their armour “ for distinction,” or rather, perhaps for disguise,
passed out of the city gate, with the intention of taking the Parliamen-
tarians by surprise; but one Guise, or Guy, a Puritan tailor, informed the Lord
General of the design, and the enemy were prepared. Many Royalists were
taken prisoners, and
Major Knox was slain.
General Middleton and
Sir William Keyth led
this absurd adventure.
Next day the unfortu-
nate tailor was hanged.
On the 30th Lambert
sent a company to
plunder Mr. Hornyold’s
mansion, Blackmore
Park, and to attack
the garrison at Mr.
Lygon’s moated house
at • Madresfield.
Very early on the
morning of September
the 3rd Cromwell was
in the field making
preparations for the
coming battle. In after
times a story was re-
peated by the credulous,
to the effect that he
THE OAK STAIRCASE AT 11 THE COMMANDERY.”
had an interview with a supernatural being wearing flaming armour. The
interview is said to have taken place at a cottage on the skirts of Perry
Wood, and Cromwell is fabled to have sold his soul to the Arch Fiend
as the price of victory, and an extension of a few years of prosperity


If there be a grain of truth in the legend, it is that the Lord-General
and one of his officers were concocting the plan of action in that lonely
cottage, while the army lay asleep around the camp fires.
As the morning dawns, General Fleetwood begins constructing a bridge of
boats across the Severn, and another across the Teme, less than a mile from
the city. It is not till the afternoon that the bridges are finished and
troops begin to pass over to the western side. Meanwhile, Charles has been
holding a council of war on the roof of the cathedral tower, has watched
the building of the bridges, and the passage of the troops. At 3 o'clock
the fight begins, Fleetwood's men attacking the Scots, and driving them from
field to field, and from hedge to hedge, to the bounds of the suburb of
St. John’s.
“In great force,” writes Carlyle, “for new regiments, horse and foot, now
stream across the Severn bridge of boats to assist Fleetwood ; nay, if the
Scots knew it, my Lord General himself is come across 1 did lead the van
in person, and was the first that set foot on the enemy’s ground.’ ” —(Oliver
Cromwell’s Letters).
The King, seeing the danger, comes down from the tower, and commands
all to their arms ; he goes in person to Powick Bridge, to instruct the High-
landers to maintain their position, and they bravely obey, as well as circum-
stances will allow. Montgomery is dangerously wounded, and his ammunition
spent ; so he is forced to retreat, leaving Keyth a prisoner at Powick Bridge.
Piscotty's Highlanders advance to oppose the forces crossing by the bridge of
boats ; but what can 300 badly armed men do against thousands of well-
armed regulars ?
Charles had hastened back to the city, hoping to gain an advantage
while so many of the Parliamentarians are across the river, and all the
horse, and as of the foot as can be spared, march out of Sidbury
and St. Martin’s gates to attack the host on Red Hill. The charge of
English and Scotch chivalry, led by Charles himself, is irresistible; the
Roundheads are giving way, one charge of Leslie’s horse may change the
result of the conflict ; but Leslie moves not. Again the Royalists charge.
The Lord General has called up his reserves, and the old Ironsides stand

firm, while the ranks of the Royalists waver ; they have spent their
ammunition, but are ready to charge again, and are fighting with the buts
of their muskets, or with swords and pikes.
Foot by foot the Royalists are driven back, fighting desperately as they
retire. At last they waver, break, and fty. “My Lord General did ex-
ceedingly hazard himself riding up and down in the midst of the fray,” said
an eye-witness. "As stiff a contest, for four or five hours, as ever I have
seen,” writes my Lord General to Mr. Speaker Lenthall. But valour availeth
not, and the brave Scotch and English Royalists fly helter-skelter into the
town bearing their king with them. At Sidbury gate there is a block—a
cart has been overturned, and Charles is obliged to dismount and crawl
between the wheels. In Friar Street he pulls off his heavy armour, mounts
a fresh horse, aud rides up and down, calling upon the soldiers to rally.
Meanwhile, my Lord General has stormed Fort Royal, and slain the little
garrison—but not before he had offered them quarter, “ whereto they returned
no answer, but shot.” The guns of Fort Royal are turned against the
town, where confusion reigns ; many Parliamentary troopers enter with the
Royalists, and fighting continues in the streets and suburbs, especially is the
old castle mound obstinately defended by the Scotch, till they obtain quarter.
Some of the English gentlemen rally at the Town Hall, and a desperate
fight goes on in High Street, also around the Commandery in Sidbury.
Still Charles rides up and down, hat in hand, calling upon his men to rally,
till, seeing them throwing down their arms, he exclaims :—“ I would rather
that you should shoot me than keep me alive to see the sad consequences
of this fatal day.” Then he orders the gates to be shut, and takes council
with his friends as to the best means of escape. The trusty Wilmot—after-
wards Earl of Rochester—advises flight, and Charles inclines to the belief
that he may reach London before the news of the battle can be carried
there. At last, near 7 at night, the King rides out of Worcester through
St. Martin’s gate, and with him ride the remnant of his gallant little army.
A mile without the city, he and a few friends leave the high road ;
after a halt at Barbourn Bridge, turning their horses’ heads towards the
north.


During his residence in Worcester, it is said, the King made his head-
quarters in Corn Market, near the north end of New Street, at a large
house, parts of which are still standing. Here, in the bedroom fronting
the Corn Market, he held a council with his officers, and here when the
battle was over he was closely pursued by Colonel Corbett, but effected his
escape at the back door just as his pursuer entered by the front. Such is
the tradition.
Their exact route to Kinver Heath is difficult to follow, indeed, it is evident,
from the various accounts contained in the Boscobel Tracts, that the fugitives
lost their way, but they crossed the ford of the Salwarp at Hawford Mill;
passed by the Mitre Oak at Hartlebury, and proceeded by Chester Lane
and Greenhill to Broadwaters.* Kidderminster they avoided, but the party
rode through Stourbridge, charging a little guard of Parliamentarians who
opposed them. They were soon across, the borders of Worcestershire, and
had entered Staffordshire, to which county their, further adventures belong.
When the labours of the day were done, Cromwell penned' the following
letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons ;
‘‘For the Honourable William Lenthall,• Esquire, Speaker of the
Parliament of England : These,
“Near Worcester, 3rd Sept., 1651.
“ (10 at night),
“ Sir, —Being so weary, and scarce able to write, yet I thought it my
duty to let you know thus much. That upon this day, being the 3rd of
September (remarkable for a mercy vouchsafed to your forces on this day
* See “ Historic Warwickshire,” by T. Burgess, Ed. J. Hill, p. 185 (Midland Educational Co.) It may be
worthy of notice that tradition associates many old houses in the Midlands with the escape of Charles 11. from
the Battle of Worcester. Under Clent Hill, not far from Huanington Station, is “Good Rest Farm,” so called,
it is said, because Charles rested there. Not far away, on the brow of the hill near Quinton, is Owley, or
Howley, Grange, formerly a possession of Hales-Owen Abbey. In the kitchen of this old and decaying grange,
suspended from the great beam before the fire-place, hangs a spear, or pike, 15 feet long, and armed with an
iron head a ft. 5 in. long. Tradition has it that Charles was hiding in the chimney of this house, when Oliver
Cromwell was seeking for him. The soldiers searched the house, and when they came to the chimney, an owl
flew out; whereupon they said “there can be no one there,” and then they took their departure, Charles
coming out from the hiding-place, left the spear behind as a memorial of his escape. The possession of the
spear is said to render the farm tythe free.
Though the story is highly improbable, so far as Charles is personally concerned, it most probably has a
foundation in fact. This much is certain, the spear is there— l have seen it, —and it is of a kind in use during
the Commonwealth period. Speculation upon its origin, without the facts being known, would be futile. It is
to be hoped that the spear may never be removed from Owley Grange.


twelvemonths in. Scotland), we built a bridge of boats over Severn, between
it and Teme, about half-a-mile from Worcester, and another - over Teme,
within pistol-shot of our other bridge, Lieutenant-General Fleetwood and
Major-General Dean marched from Upton, on the south-west side of Severn, up
to Powick, a town which was a pass the enemy kept. We, ‘from our side
the Severn,’ passed over some horse and foot, and were in conjunction with
the Lieutenant-General’s forces. We beat the enemy from hedge to hedge,
til! we beat him into Worcester.

MADE HIS HEAD QUARTERS DURING THE BATTLE OF WORCESTER.
“ The enemy then drew all his forces on the other side the town, all blit
what he had lost, and made a very considerable fight with us for three
hours space, but in the end we beat him totally, and pursued him to his Royal
Fort, which we took, and indeed have beaten his whole army. When we
took this fort, we turned his own guns upon him. The enemy hath had
great loss, and certainly is scattered, and run several ways; we are in
pursuit of him, and have laid forces in several places, that we hope will
gather him up.


“ Indeed this hath been a glorious mercy, and as stiff a contest for 4 or
5 hours as ever I have seen. Both your old forces and those new raised
have behaved themselves with very great courage; and He that made
them come out, made them willing to fight for you. The Lord God
Almighty frame our hearts to real thankfulness for this, which is alone His
doing. I hope I shall, within a day or two, give you a more perfect
account.
“ In the meantime I hope you will pardon, Sir,
“Your most humble servant,
“OLIVER CROMWELL."*
The crowning mercy is complete—Worcester taken, the Royalists routed,
Charles fled. In the city thousands of prisoners are penned up in the
cathedral ; carcases of horses and corpses of men make the streets horrible;
Lords and gentlemen are being plucked from their lurking holes. The
Earls of Derby, Lauderdale, Cleveland, and Shrewsbury, Lord Wentworth,
generals; Leslie, Middleton, and Alexander Forbes, who commanded Fort
Royal; Robert, Earl of Carnworth, the Earl of Kelly, Sir John Packington,
Generals Montgomery and Piscotty, and many more are prisoners, some of
them wounded desperatel}'. The Duke of Hamilton, whose horse was shot
under him at the first charge, is dying in the Commandery. Hundreds of
other men of less note, whose names are not recorded, are djdng or dead.
Such is the price paid for the restoration of order.t
