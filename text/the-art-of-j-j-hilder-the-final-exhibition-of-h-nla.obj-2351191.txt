Landscape Study
THE ART OF J. J. HILDER
The Final Exhibition of his
WATER-COLOURS AND PENCIL STUDIES
>
June 7th to 18th, 1927
FARMER'S EXHIBITION HALL, SYDNEY, N.S.W.


The Art and Fame of J. J. Hilder
I confess, in recalling jinker jaunts in Kuring-gai Chase, and one lamp-lit dinner-table, that my
impudence was very great to think of this man as my delightful friend rather should I have
worshipped. Yet any beauty-lover can know him as he was, for we have a corner of Hilders
in our National Gallery. And in this corner we can see, too, the increasing mastery of the spirit.
There are many who, loving beauty, would jealously guard it and hold it for their own. It is
these who may now gratify such a desire, for Mrs. Hilder has made this showing of her husband's
most beautiful works.
T. GARRETT.

Australia may well be proud of Jesse Hilder, for he is entirely her own by birth
and training. His art was intuitive; what instruction he received, and the
inspiration he got from other men's wor\, helped him but little towards self-
development. His water-colours show the strong individual note of the true
romantic artist; they are not li\e anything done previously in Australia or else-
where. His achievement would be remarkable in any circumstances

Pencil Study
Hilder had that passionate delight in colour which is the gift of the Gods, and
cannot he imparted by any teacher. For the greater part of his thirty-five years his
chief interest was the expression of beauty in colour. With only a brief period
of instruction in the art of drawing, he did not really begin his painter's career
until he was twenty-six.

Dora Cree\
The activities of man, his passions, desires and quenchless curiosity, Nature's
infinite, varied moods—these, tinged with the beauty underlying life, have ever
been the foundations on which the artist has reared a treasure house of delight for
the tired spirit of man.
JULIAN ASHTON, "The Art of J. J. Hilder."

Pencil Study
There are many painters, but few artists, and only lately, but with growing cer-
tainty, is it being realised that Hilder has uncovered a feast of beauty that can
never be entirely lost.
