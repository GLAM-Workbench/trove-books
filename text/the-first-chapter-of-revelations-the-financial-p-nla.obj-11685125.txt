THE SECOND CHAPTER OE REVELATIONS.
LAND SETTLEMENT
AND
IRRIGATION, &c.
years since, a lady friend of the writer was giving her little
nephew some instruction in Bible History, and she�said, "So
my dear, Adam and Eve were turned out of the garden of' Eden
and had to go and dig the ground." " Auntie," said the little
boy, " where did they get their spade ? " This was a conundrum which
Auntie could not answer, and will prove a difficulty which many who
talk so glibly about "placing the people on the land " will have to deal
with.
To begin with : The Government have not any funds which they
nan legitimately use for placing people on the land, nor the prospect of
any. Many people prooose that the �90,000 voted for immigration
should be devoted for the purpose ; but the Government have not
this yet, and in any case it would be necessary to have a vote of the
House to apply it for this purpose, and the new clause in the Audit Act
would not meet the difficulty, as it only gives the Government authority
to use any funds in hand to complete contracts already commenced ?
while the Revenue, which Mr. Glassey proposes to draw on, is not
sufficient to meet current expenses, if that much, and is not legitimately
available. �
The second question that arises is : Who are the people to settle
on the land with any prospect of making a profitable investment ? It is
quite evident that very few of the " unemployed," judging from late
experience, would be suitable. No doubt many of them would go on the
land for the declared object of learning farming, if supplied with" comfort-
able quarters, full rations, and light work, with good wages added. But


these are not the stuff of which farmers are to be made. Independent
of the fact that they have been demoralized by town life and ? long-
sleevers,? a man to make a farmer requires to have been brought up in
the country, or to have a natural taste and talent for the occupation.
It requires hard and continuous work, early and late, poor fare, and
exposure to all weathers ; it fosters, however, the feeling of self-depend-
ence and hope which stimulates a man to action and supports him in
difficulties, with the prospect of future independence as a reward, and
the possession of the coveted land and property which he can call his
own and hand down to his family ; and gives a man the proud position
of being self-made, and one of tnose who produce the wealth and form
the back-bone of a colony.
Many of the unemployed alluded to, whom so many people propose
to utilize on the land, would have no objection to go and stay as long
as suited them, living on ? Government pap ?in the mean time. The
effect of this diet is to take the back-bone out of a man and ruin him
for the future. If, however, he will work at a fair price and any
practicable plan of land settlement shall be adopted, employment may
be found for a largo number of the unemployed for a long period in
clearing and fencing land and building humpies for the intended occu-
pants ; such expense to constitute a lien on the land, to be repaid by
the incoming tenant before obtaining his fee simple. The difficulty will
be to get the unemployed to work at a price which will not smother
the tenant.
The only plan that can be adopted to get over this difficulty will
be to fix the rate of payment, and make the refusal a bar to any further
employment or Government relief.
Before talking of settling, selling, or in any other way utilizing the
land comes the question of
Irrigation.
This is a necessity ,and without a comprehensive, practical, and practic-
able Bill, supplemented by a
Water Conservation Bill
the writer would not take a present of the best piece of land in the
colony, or recommend any other man to do so, with a view to cultiva-
tion ; or, indeed, for grazing purposes at present.
( Extract from First Chapter of Revelations.')
? In dealing with our Land Asset, a complete revision of our policy
will have to be initiated from a practical point of view, ignoring all
?wildcat? theories and Utopian ideas, keeping in view the develop-
ment of the productions for which the soil and climate are suitable,
so as to give employment to the greatest number, and create an export
trade and a large home demand, besides attracting capital. In the case


of this colony, population should be looJced on as our great source of *
wealth . All efforts to check this with a view to retain a monopoly for
the present occupiers should be resisted.
? To valise the value of our land, the first step should be to inau-
gurate a compi ehensive and complete system of irrigation and water con-
servation. This would at once give an increased value to our Land
Asset, and render a large quantity saleable which is now valueless, and
should, if properly woiked, become in time a large source of income, as
well as forming a sinking fund towards the payment of our loan liability.
It has been toe opinion of some high authorities that irrigation
should have preceded our railway system, or at least have gone hand-in-
hand with it, but the error has been already committed, and it should
now be the i first duty ?of our Government to repair it at once, and
that thoroughly, not by the shilly-shally expelient of 4 artesian bores,?
or the establishment of water trusts, which latter have proved *a
failure in the colonies of Victoria and New South Wales, and might be
abused foi political purposes, as our railway system has unfortunately
been, but by the adoption of a comprehensive Irrigation Bill, based on
that of the State of Colorado in America, whereby the water of the State
Jias been declared the property oj the people , to be utilised for their benejit .
Nothing short of this will satisfy the people of this colony.'
?After the fiasco committed by the Governments of this colony with
regard to our railways, the people will be averse to trust any Govern-
ment wnh funds for the purpose of carrying out a system of irrigation
even if a loan could be floated, which is more than doubtful in our
present financial position, when, as Mr. Macrossan savs, 4 out bori'owing
powers have come to an end.? Still, for such a profitable investment, and
with such good security as the Government would be in a position to
offer, theie should not be any difficulty in attracting the necessary
capital from outsiders. This was the opinion of the late Mr William
Westgarth. The sale of land in any quantity as a source of revenue
will puzzle cleverer men than Mr. Tozer ; and the difficulty of getting
it settled by the right sort of people is a question involving outlay, and
where or how the fund for this purpose can be raised is a 4 hickory nut ?
which will puzzle even Sir Thomas MTlwraith to crack. The land
policy of our different Governments is a disgrace to our public men.
The prospects of the present generation have been sacrificed for the
benefit of posterity, which is suggestive of the memorable question of
Sii Boyle Roach in the Irish Parliament, 44 What has posterity done for
us A large quantity of the best land in the colony has been locked
up for a whole generation on long leases to squatters, and to satisfy
Mr. Dutton?s Georgian craze , backed up by Sir 8. W. Griffith embodied
in the Land Act of 1884, which is a 'conundrum ??hard to understand ?
Taken from an abstract-point of view, there is no doubt that the


people who have come out to this colony as farmers have been in the
majority of cases induced to do so ? under false pretences? ?not having
been fully informed of the nature ot the climate, - which consists of a
succession of periodical droughts and floods ? the concealment of which
facts has had the same effect as if there had been deliberate false pre-
tences. These remarks are not intended to bring any charge against
the memory of the late Mr. Henry Jordan, who, no doubt, acted up to
his instructions, and very likely did not realize the position.
A Committee of Inquiry would astonish most people, but would
not remedy the mischief which has been done, or restore the lost capital
to those who have suffered.
Few people have realized the fact, that our water is one of our
most valuable assets, without which our land asset is of little value
comparatively. But under our present law the Government cannot
give a clear title to the former, and under our present Land Laws only
an unsatisfactory, if not doubtful, title to the latter, of which a large
portion is locked up on long leases under a ? Georgian craze.?
People are, however, waking up to the necessity of bringing our
land into cultivation on the one hand, and selling large areas on equit
able terms to meet the requirements of the Government. How are
these objects to be accomplished %
The ?Village Settlement" plan is apparently the favorite one at
present, but to this there are several objections; indeed, the small
amount of encouragement it has met with, except in a few cases, does
not seem to hold out any inducement to go on with it,
The plan for land settlement proposed by the writer several years
since, was to encourage practical men with growing families and moderate
capital to take up land in proportion to the size of their families and
amount of their capital on an improving lease. If this were fully carried
out, at the termination ot the lease, give them the land in fee simple.
If from any cause the stipulations were not carried out, let the land at
once revert to the Government, paying to the outgoing tenant a
proportion of the money spent and value of the improvements, the
Government getting the benefit of the balance to remain as a lien
against the new tenant, which -would be equitable to all parties, and
prevent on the one hand paities occupying land for speculative purposes,
and cn the other hand protect them from investing their capital and
labour without a prospect of some return, but in no case require any
payment from the tenant in the first instance. After mature consideration
there does not appear to the writer any objection to adopting this as one
of the plans available.
The principal objection to the village settlement plan is the proposal
for central residence, for which there does not appear any necessity of
advantage. Let each occupant live on his own selection at the the most


suitable point, setting apart a site for a township in a central situation for
the necessary stores, places of public worship, schools, etc, for a group of
small farmers within a moderate distance of the township. This is the
plan which has been adopted in Utah and the United States generally.
One of the dangers to be guarded against is that of ?? Land Hunger,? to
make use of an American expression, which tempts people to occupy
more land than they can thoroughly cultivate.
In treating of this part of the question due allowance must be made
for the difference in climate, and the nature of the crops which will pay
to grow between this Colony and America, but the objection holds good as
to land hunger, and must be borne in mind in developing the colony.
In Utah, the location of new immigrants is decided before arrival, and
instead of being allowed to waste their time and means in the towns,
they are at once sent on to their destinations before they have contracted
bad habits. As the Mormon church owns the land, and enjoys a perfect
despotism, it has the power of carrying out its arrangements ; and,
judging from the result, has been successful in bringing the land into
a high state of cultivation and settling a large number of prosperous
towns, but as the circumstances of our colony and people are so difficult,
it would be little use as a precedent.
In considering the settlement of land in this Colony, the experience
gained so far ought to satisfy people that farming on the Old Country
plan, or growing Old Country crops will not pay ; both must be adapted
to the climate and soil with a due consideration for the probable outside
demand. The prices received by the American farmers for grain exported
have left them a very small return, and as they have such advantages in
point of freight and distances in their favor, it is scarcely worth while
discussing the advisability of growing these crops with a view to export.
The same remarks apply to Hog products. In fresh meat we can
successfully compete, for the reason that owing to the increased Home
(American) demand and other causes, we can for the present produce
this on much lower terms, leaving a margin in our favor after paying
extra freight and expenses and allowing for the extra time in reaching a
market, and if properly managed in the Home market better prices will
be obtained than heretofore for Australian meats.
Another consideration with regard to these crops is, that they
require the cultivation of large areas of ground with all the attendant
expenses. Experience has proved that there is no chance of competing
with our neighboring Colonies in these crops, and must therefore turn our
attention to others suitable to our soil and climate in which we may
successfully compete with the whole world. These require only small
areas, from 10 to 100 acres, or less, and would consequently lead to a
denser population, which, distributed in small groups with central towns
as distinguished from villiage settlements, would supply the necessary


labor for utilising them, such as gathering crops, canning. &c., which
would give profitable employment to the rising generation, bring them up
in industrious habits and inculcate a love for their pursuit and a tendency
to stick to it. This would be a great point gained, and would lead to a
permanent settlemert of the land on the same lines, and decrease the
temptation to town settlement, which is a curse to this Colony as well as
others, and has largely contributed to the production of anew class called
" The Unemployed, " which, in the Old Country and America degenerate
into
TRAMPS.
To follow up this subject, it would be necessary to exceed the limits
of a pamphlet, and it would suffice to summarise it by stating that as a
substitute for what is called village settlement the writer would suggest a
number of groups of settlements from two to three miles square round a
central town, so that the necessary labor could be concentrated at any
given point when required for gathering in the irregularly maturing crops
and for canning and preserving purposes at the central township.
Two square miles would represent 2560 acres divided into
100 farms of 10 acres each, 1000 acres
50 ? 20 ? 1000 ?
50 ~ different areas 560 ~
2560 acres,
200 families represent 1000 population.
Three square miles would represent 5760 acres, divided into
200 farms of 10 acres each, 2000 acres
100 ? 20 ? 2000 ~
100 ? different areas L 760
5760 acres.
400 families representing 2000 jmpulation.
Either of these would supply the necessary labor.
Now that people of this Colony appear to have got over the
unreasoning objections to the term syndicates, which at one period was
like shaking a red rag in the face or a bull, these may be carried out by
this means, or by Government, if controlled by restrictions which would
limit their power to abuse their influence. As to working out the
arrangements on the German plan of Land Banks, &c., they are out of the
running; we have to deal with a different class of people and must take
them as they are, and in every way different surroundings, crops, &c.
We have in point of fact, no precedents of any practical value to guide
and assist us, except in the fruit growing and wine-producing States of
America. At the same time we have a large number of crops which
would pay to grow at a profit of from �lO to �lOO an acre on small
farms of from 10 to 40 acres, or less, highly cultivated, out of which more
money can be made than on 160 to 640 acres in America and Canada,


which can be run by white labor, these, including fruits, will run up to
about 50 per cent. A few of the leading ones may be named without
increasing this pamphlet beyond readable limits?not including sugar.
Coffee.?There is not any reason why in time this colony could not
grow enough to supply the principal European consumers, and even
America, the largest consumers ? per Capita ? perhaps in the world who
consume pure coffee.
Chicory, which is used so largely as an addition to coffee in the
colonies and Europe.
Tobacco only requires proper attention in growing, the qualities
required, and proper curing, to make the colony one of the largest
exporters in the world.
Cocoa.?ls simply a question of time to build up a large export
trade to compete with South America in an article of increasing
consumption.
Cocoa Nut Oil.?lnstead of exporting copra this might be crushed
here, thus securing the extra profit; as also growing the nut
Palm Oil, to which the same remarks apply.
Pea Nuts.?Known by the name of ? Monkey Nuts? in the colony,
and imported largely as ? Ground Nuts? from the west coast of Africa
into England, where they are converted into oil. They pay well to grow,
and the demand is almost unlimited
Date Palms will pay in some places.
Olives will also p�y, and many others.
It will also pay to encourage our Mining to the fullest
extent, if for no other purpose than that to supply consumers for our
agricultural and other produce, as well as attracting capital and increasing
the value of our exports.
A very sensible article which appeared lately in the ?Daily Telegraph,?
of Sydney, suggests that the people of this colony eat too much meat,
and are deficient in the art of cooking it, which is a fact ; also, that there
are many valuable vegetables which are not grown in the colony which
might be grown to great advantage, and others which are not grown in
sufficient quantities to bring them within the reach of ordinary consumers
Among these may be named Sweet Corny which is grown extensively in
America, and is extensively canned for home consumption. Seakale, one
of the most delicious vegetables grown, which if brought within the reach
of ordinary' consumers, would pay at least �lOO an acre. Asparagus , the
same remarks apply, and several others ; but the object of this pamphlet
is to be suggestive ; therefore, fruit growing, and the unlimited industries
arising out of it, will be left for future treatment, California has made
itself one of the richest states in America by fruit growing. The value
of her exports of these, with wine and brandy, exceed the whole of those
of this colony. The exports of this latter from France, even since the


vine disease appeared, have been �12,000,000 ?twelve million a year ;
while supplying a wholesome drink for a population of thirty-seven
millions. The back-bone of Spain and Portugal has been their wine
exports. Germany is also a wine exporting country, besides supplying a
large home demand, and in the Cape of Good Hope colony this industry
is increasing, but the writer has not been able to obtain any reliable
statistics. The moral effect of making this colony a wine consumer is a
question which is well worth the consideration of the advocates of
temperance.
As to our tropical and semi-tropical fruits and the various uses
that may be made of them with the different industries growing out of
their cultivation, there is scarcely a limit which time may not develop,
or the number of the population and extent of the employment which
they will give particularly to the rising generation. Fruit growing
necessitates close settlement, as small areas of land, highly cultivated,
offer sources of wealth to numerous families, whilst large tracts of land
in America and other countries, only afford a bare living to a sparse
and widely separated population. To enumerate these fruits and the
new uses to which they may be put, would require an entire pamphlet,
and it would be impossible to estimate the value of the export trade
which would grow out of the application of intelligence and capital,
to develop the natural resources of this colony.
Proposals have been made to sell large blocks of land, as much as
1,500,000 acres, to meet the immediate requirements of the government.
These things are not to be done in a moment, and without syndicates
are out of the question, but there is not any reason why with proper
restriction they might not be made the means of settling up large blocks of
land, and introducing outside capital as well as a large producing
population whose success would depend on their own good management,
for which the syndicates would be responsible and on which their profits
would depend. A ? Forfeiture Clause? depending on the fulfillment of
their engagements would be a sufficient guarantee, and would protect the
colony from any abuse or loss in introducing the system. A preference
should be given to Californians and other Americans acquainted with
fruit growing and wine industries, as well as the management of
irrigation. As to the limit of the blocks of land and other details, it
would be premature to offer an opinion, although there have been
proposals to rush into the thing by parties whose object it would appear
to be ?to float public companies.? This subject will be treated on
more fully under the head of Irrigation.
The question of settling up our land on the lines laid down by Mr.
Riithning, as well as establishing co-operative relations between
employers and labour on the German system, may be dismissed as
chimerical , and however creditable to his heart does not say much for


his head. This colony has to deal with things and population as they
exist, and not attempt to " discount the future."
If Mr. Riithning wishes to reduce his theories to practice let him
get up a German syndicate to purchase a large block of land and intro-
duce the proper class of people to cultivate it and established their own
Land Bank. If properly worked it ought to pay, and perhaps set a good
example to some of our own people. The writer knows how successful
the Germans have been in the neighbourhood of Chicago in growing
vegetables, and in other places as vignerons ; and there is no reason to
suppose that they would not be equally successful in this colony.
One of the great mistakes made during the administration of Sir
Thomas Mcllwraitli in 1883, was the veto put on the introduction of the
LAND GRANT RAILWAYS.
This arose from gross ignorance, and Sir Samuel Griffith availed him-
self of this to get into power ; also, of the colonial objection to the word
syndic te, by which it was proposed to carry it out. He (Sir Samuel
Griffith) also repudiated the agreement entered into with the Earl of
Denbigh and others by the Mcllwraith Government by which certain
expenses were guaranteed to the disgrace of the colony, for which they
(the syndicate) have still a claim as a debt of honor. ISow that the
people of the colony appear to have got over this senseless scare, there'
may be a chance for the adoption of this plan, which may materially aid
in the settling of the land. Although the plan was abused in America,,
the means by which it was done are before us for our guidance. There
need not be any difficulty in carrying the plan out here to a successful
result. The difficulty will be to get British Capitalists to go into it with
a case of repudiation staring them in the face. People here do not know
or do not remember the case of repudiation of the bonds of the state of
Mississippi in America, which for years affected the value of American
securities to the extent of many millions, and is not even now forgotten.
It may have appeared a clever dodge of the Griffith ministry to shelve this
claim, but the day of retribution will come when the men who have been
cheated out of their money may be those whose assistance we shall
require. ?
The plan on which the American Land Grant Railways was carried
out was this : The Government made over to the Railway Companies a
number of alternate sections of land on the line of the proposed railway
at the upset price of a dollar and a quarter (five shillings) an acre,
extending for a fixed distance from the railway on both sides of the line,-
to become the property of the railway as it was built, the Government
retaining the alternate section. As the progress of the railways depended
on the sale of their alternate section for funds to continue their lines, it
was their interest as well as necessity to sell these to the best advantage ;?
they, therefore, gave every facility to intending purchasers to inspect the


?and by free passes, etc. The advantages of railway communication with
outside markets at once gave an increased value to the land, which readily
sold at double the price, and in many cases much more than the upset
price. In the meantime the value of the alternate sections held by the
Government increased in the same proportion without any outlay on
their part, and more than recouped them for the original grant to the
railway companies, independent of the advantages of getting the land
settled. It was a grand idea, and has borne its fruits ; without it there
would be millions of acres of land still lying idle, and several of the
leading railway lines between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans would not
have been built at the present day. When this plan was proposed by
.Sir Thomas Mcllwraith he was met with the objection that it was a land
grabbing scheme, etc, by those suffering under a craze. Now
the people of the colony have got over this to a certain extent, and there
is a prospect of Land Grant Railways being carried out where the
opportunity offers, which will necessitate the introduction of foreign
caiptal, and open up and settle the colony.
Before adopting any of the proposed plans for settling the Colony,
the wisest plan would be to repeal all existing land laws and begin de
novo. '1 he plan of amending?otherwise tinkering?old Acts is like
? putting a piece of new cloth into an old garment.? With a clear start
so as to enable the Government to enter into engagements to carry out
the new state of things, and particularly io deal with land likely to be
brought under the effect of Irrigation, so that the people will get the
benefit of the increased value and not a set of land jobbers. This need
not affect the liabilities incurred under the existing land laws, although
the new laws might contain a proviso enabling the Government to curtail
or foreclose many of the long leases existing and free some of the land
locked up at present so as to ensure immediate settlement ?even if it were
necessary to buy up existing rights in some cases it would be the cheapest
plan in the long run.
When Sir Samuel Griffith, in reply to Mr. Agnew?s strictures on the
Land Act of 1884 threatening its repeal, said the then Government ?had
not the pluck to do it.? He may find that a new House and a new
Government will have the necessary pluck.
IRRIGATION AND WATER CONSERVATION.
Before entering into this part of the question, the writer distinctly
and unreservedly states, as admitting that with a Bill such as he
can propose, properly and honestly worked, a royalty for the concession
of water privileges with the increased value of land and facility for sale,
will, in the course of a few years, pay the whole revenue reguirements of the
Colony and furnish a sinking Jundfor the gradual extinction the debt.
This looks a big thing to promise, but it is a fact?and not a theory.
The carrying out of this plan would cause an immense influx of


capital and give employment for a long period to many thousands of
people, besides holding out attractions to the right sort of settlers who
will all bring more or less capital into the Colony.
At the present moment the law does not provide any title to parties
proposing to carry out irrigation works, the question of riparian rights
would crop up and lead to endless litigation asin the State of California,
which was working under the old English law. consequently any attempt
to carry out irrigation works at present would only lead to loss and
disappointment ; also, all the details for carrying out and applving
irrigation are premature. The report of Mr. Deakin to the Victorian
Government gives very valuable information with diagrams for buildinc
dams and weirs, &c., but first, it is necessary to have a Bill.
The writer was one of the first to call attention to the importance of
this question on his arrival from the West of America in 1885 by a
number of public lectures and letters, in consequence of which he was
accused of " drawing the long bow also, of being troubled with " water
on the brain." To this he replied that "he wished it were infectious."'
But at last he believes the infection is spreading, and trusts the disease
may become general. However. Mr, Deakin's report, which appeared
shortly afterwards, more than confirmed his statements and relieved him
of the charge of medacity.
Although the great drought ending in 1885 was estimated to have
cost the Colony almost, if not quite as much, as the existing debt, and
there lias since been a second, the loss by which has not been estimated,
nothing in the shape of legislation has been done. Sir Samuel Griffith
certainly introduced a Bill in 1886, the principal objects of which appeared
to be to define what constituted running water or dry water courses &c.
If carried, it would have led to a first-rate crop of litigation, but luckily it
died a natural death. There have also, during the same period, been two
floods, doing an incalculable amount of damage ; yet no attempt was
made to utilize any portion of the thousands of millions of gallons of
water which were allowed to run to waste. So much for the foresight of
our legislators. It now remains for the people to take the matter in hand
and make it a " test question " with any proposed legislator.
Many farmers are under the impression that it will be necessary for
each irrigator to supply his own plant. It would be as reasonable to
expect him to build a mill to grind his own wheat.
It must be borne in mind that iirigation to be carried out success-
fully mu�t be done on a large scale to pay a fair return to the investors
and enable the consumers to obtain the water at a price they can afford
to pay ; although, one consumer near Melbourne states that he has found
it profitable to pay as much as eight pounds a year per acre. This is an
exceptional case and may, most probably, be a maximum rate.
The practical views of Mr. P. McLean, Under Secretary for Agri-


culture, are well worth attention. The establishment of Agricultural
Colleges, with the appliances for giving intending settlers and young
people a sound and practical education in the industries suitable for the
the colony, are what are wanted at present. Universities afterwards,
based on a knowledge of the dead languages, are out of date ; these
ought to be buried now that they are dead, and keep alive the living ones.
The Museum attached to the Agricultural Department, under the
charge of Mr. F. M. Bailey, will also do much to educate the people, as
well as the lectures of Mr. Loudon at the Acclimatisation Gardens, and
in addition, if procurable, a college of professional fruit preservers and
vignerons from California and other fruit growing and wine producing
States in America. These are what we want, and will be worth all the
outlay.
Mr. A F. Bell, Civil Engineer, who writes as an authority on
irrigation, is premature in his details, also not quite correct in his state-
ments with regard to the application in the States of Colorado and
California, in which he states that the water is turned loose on the land
in some places to find its level, thus over saturating part and partially
wetting remainder. The writer has been in every part of the former
State and never saw irrigation so applied ; nor did he ever hear of it in
California. Mr. Bell proposes to raise the levels of our rivers 10 to 20
feet to secure a fall and save expense of pumping. He appears to forget
that we have two enemies to contend with?drought and floods. His
plan in providing against the first would aggravate the effects of the
latter, and leave, periodically, miles of his irrigated land periodically
under water and sweep away his ditches.
In the future special Loans may be raised for exceptional purposes
on proving to the London capitalists that they will pay ; otherwise no
Loan for any purpose should be sanctioned by our local Parliament.
This is the Second Chapter of Revelations, and, owing to the effect
which has been produced by the First Chapter, it is to be hoped that it
will meet with careful consideration. The fact, that the First Chapter
has not, so far as the writer is aware, produced a single comment from the
Press, much less an analysis or objection, is a proof that he has succeeded
in one of his objects, and that he has given them a particularly hard
i( hickory nut ? to crack, and that his statements have been unanswerable
This chapter goes forth on its merits.

SECOND CHAPTER OF REVELATIONS.
NEW ITALY.?A pamphlet written by Mr, Fred Chudleigh Clifford,
manager of the Queensland Trade Protective Society, A.M.P. Buildings'
in which he describes the establishment and progress of a colony formed
by a small body of Italians in New South Wales, is worth the attention
of the people of this colony, when we are threatened with an immigra-
tion of the same nationality. It may be stated that the object of Mr.
Clifford is noc to advocate or encourage Italian labor specially, but to
show what can be done by " pluck and perseverance," (he might have
added frugality and sobriety), and to state the result of the introduction
of a handful (200) of Italians into New South Wales, under the
most adverse circumstances. They were penniless, destitute, and
ignorant of our language. They were the survivors of three hundred
who left their native country with a view to form a colony in New
Ireland, under the auspices of a marquis, Dr. Rave. For particulars of
the failure of this expedition, I must refer to Vr. Clifford's pamphlet.
Howeve*-, the result was that they arrived in Sydney, April, 1881, and
after several proposals to settle them on the waste lands, were scattered
over the colony as laborers One of their number, whose name deserves
to be recorded, named Rocca Comminiti, found himself in the district
of Richmond, between the Richmond and Clarence Rivers, in 1882
where with the savings of his year's wages, he selected 40 acres in
a district of heavily timbered land, not considered capable of
supporting a bandicoot. The result was that the remainder of his
fellow immigrants were attracted to the place, and there is now a
settlement called New Italy, comprising a population of three hundred
cultivating an area of three thousand acres, independent and self-
supporting, with a school house and church, producing crops with which
they are acquainted, the foremost being grapes, which selling their
wine at two shillings per gallon give a return of �2O per acre, with
every prospect of forming a large colony. Mr. Clifford's pamphlet reads


like a romance, but he has seen what he describes, and his pamphlet
has been published by the Government Printing Office, Sydney.

It must be borne in mind that the immigrants described were from
the north of Italy, a totally different race from the Southerners, who as
rule are Lazzaroni, and have furnished the race who have given rise to
the disturbing element in New Orleans and other parts of America,
who, in addition to their improvident habits, have imported their
peculiar institution of Mafia, which led to the lynching lately of some
of the leaders in New Orleans.

of Mr. Clifford?s pamphlet without acknowledgement. Is this the way
the Boomerang derives its inspiration %
