A Current Biography of
CHARLES LLOYD JONES
by Bartlett Adamson


CHAPTER I
charles A Modest Man with
LLOYD
JONES a Multi-Track Mind
A creative artist, as revealed in this, the first of a series of three articles,
can become an Old Master. Mr. Charles Lloyd Jones is versatile
in his inspirations. Himself a painter of distinction, a man of varied
cultural interests, his magnus opus is the most progressive department
store in Sydney.
Here is a somewhat contradict
tory character.
He comports himself like a
gentleman, yet he is known to be
an artist. Everything he does is in-
stinct with artistic niceness, yet he
is recognised in three continents as
a business magnate. In actuality he
certainly is a business magnate, yet
he comports himself as a gentleman.
He does not wear a cigar canted
from the corner of his mouth at an
angle resembling a ship’s derrick.
He does not go roaring around
the premises and leaving a trail of
sacked personnel behind him.
He does not inhabit a vast office
full of telephones, dictaphones, and
other phoney contraptions.
He is Charles Lloyd Jones, or
Charlie Lloyd Jones to friends, and
as Chairman of Directors of David
Jones Limited, of Sydney, he is the
big noise of the establishment. But
he is the quietest big noise that ever
strolled through the cloisters of
commerce.
Of course it .might be said that he
inherited his status, that he is a
figure-head rather than an adminis-
trator, that the main factor of
success is some factotum or other.
That is a point to examine.
But first let’s have a brief survey
of the history of the rise of David
Jones Ltd.
It is essential in considering
Charles Lloyd Jones.
It is also a history of the rise of
Sydney and to some extent also the
rise of a nation.
When Sydney was five years old
a David Jones was born at Llandillo
Faur, Carmarthenshire, Wales. He
grew up, as even Welsh children
are apt to do, learned the foreign
English language, and was appren-
ticed to the drapery trade.
While still a youngster he went to
London and worked in a drapery
establishment. Big department
stores had not then been invented.
The largest shop in London at that
time employed only sixteen hands.
In time David Jones married, had
a family of four daughters and four
sons, which suggests a nice sense of
balance, and finally came to Aus*
tralia as partner in the firm of
Appleton and Jones, 36 Pitt Street,
Sydney, a prosperous business in a
prospering port.


But the partners quarrelled. Ac-
tually Appleton upset the applecart.
David Jones made an historic
move to the corner of George Street
and Barrack Street, opposite the
Post Office, a two-storey building
with living quarters above the shop.
It was a valuable site. For corn*
parison, business allotments in Pitt
Street, south of Bathurst Street,
could be got for £1 each. In George
Street, in the vicinity chosen by
David Jones, allotments were worth
up to £6O a foot. The business was
situated on the same corner as that
occupied to-day By the George
Street store of David Jones Ltd.,
which, however, is no longer a one-
floor shop with living quarters on
top.
Ihe fortunes of David Jones
fluctuated with the fluctuations of
the city, declined in the depression
of 1842, rose in the gold-rush years,
failed in 1863, was revived by the
help of one of the sons and was
continued prosperingly by another
of the sons, Edward Lloyd Jones.
Old David Jones, aged 80 died
in 1875. He had lived to see the
family venture firmly re-established.
But it had begun to take on a new
character.
In 1876, Edward Lloyd Jones
visited England, was impressed by
the enterprise of William Whiteley,
the original universal provider, and
proceeded to introduce in the
Sydney store a similar development.
David Jones had founded the
store. Edward Lloyd Jones depart-
mentalised it.
But he did more than that. He
matrimonialised himself.
Edward Lloyd Jones married
Helen Ann Jones, no relation. She
was born at West Maitland, N.S.W.,
daughter of Richard Jones, founder
of the West Maitland Mercury
and a director of Commercial Bank
of Sydney.
They had three sons ; Edward
Lloyd Jones, Charles Lloyd Jones,
Eric Lloyd Jones.
As though following the father s
example, Edward, who was married
twice, on each occasion married a
Jones. Eric also married a Jones,
and finally Charles married a Jones.
This multiple-Jones family had
thus fortified the Celtic strain which
old David Jones had brought with
him from his native Wales.
That has probably been an im-
portant factor in the success of the
business enterprise, since the Celtic
strain, whether in its Cambrian,
Caledonian, or Hibernian fo rm,
carries with it, so often, an endow-
ment of vital qualities which makes
for success not only in business but
in almost any form of activity.
Those qualities include imagina-
tion, intuition, initiative, courage,
tempered by caution, quick decision
and energy to support it, impres-
sionability plus a quality of realism
and an ability to be practical, which
is invaluable in any business enter-
prise.
The history of David Jones Ltd.
is largely a history of Celtic qualities
in action, and these qualities are
observable in the career and per-
sonality of Charles Lloyd Jones, son
of Edward Lloyd Jones, son of
David Jones.
He was born at Strathheld,
Sydney, on May 28, 1878, and in


the course of years went to Manor
House School, London, and Home-
bush Grammar School, Sydney,
where, as he explains it, he spent his
time not learning anything and
doing so with pretty good success.
Dr. George Sly, master of Home-
bush Grammar School, told his
parents that he had no chance of
passing the junior Certificate Ex-
amination, which at that time was
the gateway to higher education.
It is probable that the boy's long
absences abroad with his parents
were an unsettling circumstance,
but the fact is fairly evident that
Charles Lloyd Jones had no
academic aptitude.
Nor, in those early days, did he
show any signs of commercial
aptitude either.
He was a dreamer, slight of build,
but with a robust unorthodoxy in
his ambition. He wanted to be an
artist. Very likely the Celtic strain,
too, was responsible for this.
His parents insisted that he
should make another attempt on
the Junior Certificate. His mother
was anxious that the boy should not
lightly bring disgrace upon the
family name. It was no doubt rather
horrifying that a boy of hers should
be anything so disreputable as an
artist.
But the Headmaster was frank in
assuring her that the boy was little
good for anything else, or words
to that effect.
Charles Lloyd Jones, at the age of
seventeen, thus became a student at
Sydney Art School, under the great
Julian Ashton, and there mixed,
associated, or consorted, with such
characters as Elioth Gruner, George
Lambert, 1 hea Proctor, Sid Long,
and others of similar type.
“In this company,” Charles Lloyd
Jones explains, “I soon found how
much I had to learn. I studied
poetry and history and the arts. It
was a task I imposed upon myself
to overcome my ignorance. I realised
that it was necessary to educate my-
self if I wanted to understand art
and to take my place in the cultured
world.”
* * *
So he started seriously to study,
not only art, but the arts, in the
unorthodox school of Julian Ashton,
whose methods produced not aca-
demic machines but creative per-
sonalities. It would seem that the
failure of young Charles Lloyd
Jones at Manor House School was
due to the school rather than the
pupil.
About this time tragedy intruded
itself upon the family. The father,
Edward Lloyd Jones, was killed in
a railway accident at Redfern
Station in 1894, just as Charles Lloyd
was embarking on his art career, the
eldest son was recalled from the
country where he had taken up
pastoral interests, and he, with the
late J. G. Thompson, carried on the
control of the store.
Meanwhile, after a period at the
Julian Ashton School, young
Charles Lloyd Jones decided to go
to England to continue art study.
There, among other ventures, he
bought a brown-sailed trawler for
£3OO and spent some time sailing
around the coast of England paint-
ing sea-scapes and shore-scapes, im-
proving his art technique and at the
same time satisfying a love for the sea.


CHAPTER II
CHARLES
LLOYD
JONES
A Modern D reamer
Nobody has ever seen Charles Lloyd Jones flurried. Quietly composed
he strolls through the Big Store, but with the seeing eye which notes
everything. He may frequently be seen unobtrusively taking his
luncheon in the restaurant, one of the crowd. At receptions to notable
visitors that he attends he will be observed with the more artistically
inclined chatting and nodding his understanding of their point of view.
Me never monopolises the talk and is the best listener to anyone laying
down the law. That, however, doesn’t mean that his own views are
affected because somebody happens to be emphatic.
HIS ambition while in England
as a young man was to
exhibit in the Royal Academy and
to follow a career as an artist.
But having reached the age of
twenty-four without having suc-
ceeded in his assault on the Royal
Academy, the practical side of his
temperament asserted itself. He
decided that there was no guarantee
as to his future in art, and got a job
in London in one of the branches of
trade with which the family store
dealt, became a qualified cutter in
London, returned to Australia, and
went to work, as a cutter, in the
factory of David Jones.
This was useful experience, but
young Charles Lloyd Jones had de-
cided that he was cut out to be more
than a cutter.
While abroad he had visited
U.S.A. and had been very im-
pressed by the new development
taking place in advertising methods,
just as his father, a generation
before, had been impressed by the
new developments in merchandis-
ing methods.
Charles Lloyd Jones, a young
man whose life so far seemingly had
tended to jump from one thing to
another, told his brother that he
would like to be in the advertising
department. Fate must have over-
heard. The Advertising Manager
fell ill. Charles Lloyd j ones went
into the Department and stayed
there.
His practical experience as a
cutter was helpful. His travel ex-
periences in America were even
more so. His art training was an
invaluable asset.
His various dissociated activities
were beginning to fall into place
and form some sort of ordered
pattern.
He introduced the story into
advertising, an innovation in Aus-
tralia at that time. It was rather
staggering to the local conservatives,
but it got results.


David Jones had founded the
store, Edward Lloyd Jones had
departmentalised it. Charles Lloyd
Jones advertised it, proceeded to
modernise it, finally metamor-
phosised it.
In 1906 the firm became a public
company, David Jones Limited, and
young Charles Lloyd Jones became
a junior director.
By this time the development of
the store at the corner of George
and Barrack Streets had become
impressive. The size of the building
had increased greatly, the number
of employees had moved into the
four figure bracket. The growth of
the store had paralleled the growth
of the city. Its work had become
part of the history of the city.
For example, the elaborate uni-
form which decorates the statue of
Governor Phillip in Sydney Botanic
Gardens was based on a model uni-
form designed and made by the
David Jones' store.
Again, the uniforms for the
N.S.W. Lancers, the famous Sudan
Contingent of iBBj, were also made
by the same store. These were the
first khaki woollen uniforms made
in the Empire.
And just as the life of the store
had become part of the life of the
city, so, too, it became part of the
life of Charles Lloyd Jones. In turn,
his life and personality became
equally part of the life and per-
sonality of the store.
This has become particularly
noticeable with the march of the
years in relation to the artistic side
of the character of Charles Lloyd
Jones. Commercial activities have
not submerged the aesthetic in-
terests inherent in him. They have
been, rather, a collateral activity,
with the result that the artist ex-
presses himself in the businessman,
and, in turn, the businessman con-
tinually expresses himself in terms
of art.
This has given character to the
store so that, in many ways, it is
unlike other stores.
Likewise, it has given character to
Charles Lloyd Jones, so that, in
many ways, he is unlike other com-
mercial magnates.
As the store progressed so he
became more and more the
dominant figure, or, to state the
point, perhaps more correctly in
terms of cause and effect, as Charles
Lloyd Jones became more and
more the dominant force, so the
store progressed.
He was appointed managing
director in 1919 and became chair-
man of directors in 1921.
Naturally, during the develop-
ment of the store, there have been
important personalities in mana-
gerial position and, also naturally,
it was current town-talk from time
to time that Charles Lloyd Jones,
being so steadfastly interested in
art, could not be the driving force
on the commercial side, that he was
in control as a matter of inherited
status, the company being largely
a family affair, that this manager, or
that, was the vital factor, and that
the company would soon be in
distress if the managerial chair were
to be vacated.
But this manager left, and that
manager left, in the normal course
of events.


Yet the company continued to
progress and Charles Lloyd Jones
continued to take an ever more pro-
minent part in directing it, till to-
day he emerges clearly as the force
which has made David Jones
Limited one of the hve largest con-
cerns of its kind in the British Empire.
By about 1924 it became apparent
that the enterprise had quite out-
grown the premises at George-
Barrack Streets corner, notwith-
standing the great extension which
had marked that building.
A new site was acquired. It was
between Elizabeth and Castlereagh
Streets, with frontage on Market
Street. Part of this land was occupied
by somewhat ancient shops, includ-
ing one identity known as Mandel-
berg’s second-hand store.
No one associated that part of the
town with shopping, especially with
shops catering for a fashionable
clientele. Many prophecies were
made that the move would prove
disastrous. But the company went
steadily ahead.
One unexpected obstacle was the
Mandelberg section. The lessee re-
fused to vacate the premises, and
finally legal steps had to be taken to
get possession.
This caused quite an amount of
excitement. Had Mr. Mandelberg
desired to give David Jones Limited
a free advertisement he could hardly
have done better, since the affair
created quite a stir and received
wide newspaper publicity.
The new David Jones’ Store was
opened in 1927, and although this
step did have an adverse effect for
the time being on the fortunes of
the company, it quickly justified
itself and the foresight which had
prompted the move.
This venture, which looked at
first so much like a gamble, and an
unwise one, illustrates some of those
Celtic qualities which make up the
personality of Charles Lloyd Jones.
It was a venture which showed in-
tuition, imaginative vision, and
courage to back that intuition.
The opening of the new store did
not mean the closing of the original
premises in George Street.
In 1938, to mark the centenary of
David Jones, yet a third store was
opened, in Castlereagh and Market
Streets, this time diagonally opposite
the second store, with which it forms
an integral part.
During the war this third store
was used by the Munitions Depart-
ment as Sydney headquarters, so
that, here again, the history of the
David Jones was linked closely with
the history of the city.
With the three stores and auxiliary
establishments, David Jones Limited
employs more than 6000 hands, in-
cluding 2000 men and boys.
Annual turnover is approxi-
mately £9,000,000, and the capital
value of the firm is £4,364,213.
Yet Charles Lloyd Jones, the
governing personality in this huge
undertaking, was unable to pass his
Junior Certificate Examination, and
set out in life to be an artist, not a
commercial man.
This might merely mean that he
has business aptitude, a faculty at
times having no relation to educa-
tion, much less aesthetics.
But Charles Lloyd Jones is to-
day recognised as one of Australia’s
leading cultural figures, and is also


regarded as an artist of considerable prominent influences in his career,
achievement. But they are only two lines of
Commerce and art have been activity.

CHAPTER 111
charles Aii Harmonious and
LLOYD
jo nes Civilised Life
Of all words which have gone to the bad, “service” is to-day in the
worst disrepute. It has been used and abused to convey great willingness
to charge more for anything performed with a smile. But you can get
the genuine article where it isn’t paraded as the trading virtue which
it has not. Best way of estimating its sincerity is to examine the works
of the merchant class outside their own business. Charles Lloyd Jones
stands this test. In this, the third and concluding article on this remark-
able man, you will discover unobtrusive devotion to the advancement
of the more worthy interests of his fellow citizens.
AS a Sydneysider, it is natural,
though not inevitable, that
he would have been keen on a
morning swim, that he should play
tennis, and that he should be an
enthusiastic yachtsman.
H e is a member of Royal Sydney
Yacht Club, and has owned many
yachts, and on one occasion he tried
to win the Sayonara Cup, which is
run over a 21-mile course on
Port Phillip. To enter for this he
sailed his yacht from Sydney to Mel-
bourne, but was unsuccessful in the
race, a fact which would not disturb
the philosophic suavity of Charles
Lloyd Jones, for whom the first need
in contentment is to attempt some-
thing. He has always been a lover of
music, and with Ernest Wunderlich,
the late Sir Arthur Rickard, and
Henri Verbruggen, when the Con-
servatorium of Music came into be-
ing, founded the body which later
became the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra.
Another aspect of practical in-
terest ill cultural matters is illus-
trated by the fact that he was co-
founder, with Sydney Ure Smith
and the late Bertram Stevens, of
Art in Australia and The Home,
two publications which introduced
a new standard of aesthetics to the
buyers of Australian periodicals.
He is still to-day chairman of
directors of S. Ure Smith Pro-
prietary Ltd.
The theatre has been another
sphere of active interest with him.
He has held public offices such
as president of the Retail Traders’
Association of N.S.W.; president of
N.S.W. Kindergarten Union; pre-
sident of the Cancer Research Cam-
paign which raised £lOO,OOO for this
fund.
He organised and pioneered the
Australian National Travel Associa-
tion, was interested in the Chamber
of Commerce, and the Institute of
Public Affairs.
But his most impressive work in a
public sphere was done when in
1932 he was appointed chairman of

Jones, after looking over the great establishment with A4r. and A4rs. Jones


the first Australian Broadcasting
Commission—a recognition of his
public standing and of his cultural
status. The high quality of the work
of the Commission reflected the
unobtrusive yet dynamic influence
of the chairman.
In this regard it is interesting to
observe that this influence in its
business aspect expresses itself not
only in the efficiency with which the
store is run, and the niceness of
taste displayed even in the most
modern innovation which might be
introduced, but in the personal
character which seems to demark
the store from so many other busi-
nesses and which undoubtedly de-
rives from the philosophy of Charles
Lloyd Jones.
He holds a deep conviction that
a business must be something more
than a matter of making money,
that it must have a public sense of
responsibility, an intimate interest
in the welfare not only of its share-
holders, but of its employees and
equally of its customers.
He believes that there must be
the personal note, that the human
consideration must be paramount.
It is this belief which makes him
easily approachable to any member
of his staff and which enables him
unostentatiously to stroll about the
various departments of the estab-
lishment, the big noise who makes
no noise, the boss whose presence
causes no embarrassment to the
employee.
One incident illustrates the im-
pressive unobtrusiveness of Charles
Lloyd Jones.
During the visit to Australia of
Field-Marshal Lord Montgomery of
Alamein, dominant military per-
sonage of a vast empire, a visit was
made to the Store, and the Field-
Marshal was shown over the pre-
mises personally by Charles Lloyd
Jones.
This in itself was testimony to the
standing of the firm and of its
chairman.
But Lord Montgomery was so in-
terested and impressed that he took
the trouble to send, in his own hand-
writing, a letter of appreciation
which is at once a commentary on
the character of the Field-Marshal
himself and of his host on that
occasion.
It is reprinted here facsimile not
only because of its interesting con-
tent, but because the hand-writing
itself is so characteristic.
Here, once again, this firm makes
an interesting link with history.
Although Charles Lloyd Jones is
essentially urban and urbane, with
a harbour-side home at qy Ocean
Street, Woollahra, Sydney, he
makes contact with rural life by
owning a farming property, “Sum-
merlees,” at Sutton Forest, near
Moss Vale.
But there is a strong suspicion
that his interest there is artistic
rather than bucolic.
This part of the Southern Table-
lands of N.S.W. contains some of
the most beautiful scenery in the
State, especially scenes of the
pastorale type, and there Charles
Lloyd Jones becomes essentially and
unreservedly the artist.


One of his paintings of this
region, called "Afternoon Light,”
was bought by the National Art
Gallery, Sydney, in 1941. It is
a landscape in oils, showing white
clouds in a soft blue sky, and is in-
stinct with the tranquillity of a
Sutton Forest day.
Another of his paintings was pre-
sented to the National Gallery in
1937 at the request of the Trustees.
This is "Auckland Blue,” a study of
blue water against a dun landscape.
Yet another painting by Charles
Lloyd Jones, "Canberra Mail,”
hangs in Melbourne Art Gallery.
Usually he gives his paintings to
friends, or keeps them for his own
enjoyment, but his work is not the
mere amateur efforts of a man filling
an idle hour, nor the relaxation of
a businessman. It is work done with
energy, enthusiasm, and having a
fine quality of unobtrusive technical
excellence.
It is a general opinion that Charles
Lloyd Jones, had he persisted in art
as a career, would have been a land-
scape painter of impressive per-
formance.
Daryl Lindsay, when he pur-
chased "Canberra Mail for Mel-
bourne Gallery, remarked, collo-
quially but perspicaciously:
"Charles Lloyd Jones is a damn
sight better painter than he thinks
he is.”
He has a wide artistic tolerance,
with a judicial attitude toward con-
temporary work and an alert in-
terest in even the most bizarre per-
formances by those who claim to
be moderns, although he is honest
enough to declare that he cannot
understand the freak stuff. In that
he is probably on common ground
with the freakists themselves.
He continues to exhibit with the
Society of Artists and bases his own
standards of judgment on the sure
ground of such old masters and
master technicians as Rembrandt
and Velasquez.
On the side of art as a public
activity he shows practical aware-
ness, has introduced an art gallery
as an important educational feature
of the store, and is a Trustee of
the National Art Gallery.
Notwithstanding his multiple in-
terests and the official and social
calls which these make necessary,
Charles Lloyd Jones maintains an
almost leisurely demeanour.
He seems to stroll through life,
interestedly, reflectively, genially.
He is a man of neat build, average
height, with hair silvering and some-
what thinning, with a complexion at
once youthfully fresh and with an
underlying tone of swarthiness. His
eyes are blue, with an expression
notable for unhurried alertness and
latent humour.
He has an easy and friendly smile
and his voice harmonises with his
personality, quietly impressive, un-
assertive. He automatically invites
an expression of points of view other
than his own.
Needless to say, his dress also
harmonises with itself and with its
wearer.
He certainly does not look old
enough to be 70 or thereabouts,
probably because he has remained
young in his thoughts and in his
attitude to life.
To judge by Charles Lloyd Jones,
there is much to be said for having a
multi-track mind.
