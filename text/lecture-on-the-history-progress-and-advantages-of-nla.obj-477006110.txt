SAYINGS’ BANKS.
There is a trite old proverb “ take care of the pence and the pounds will
take care of themselves,” the force of which neither its use nor its antiquity has
in any degree abated, for it holds as good in these days of progress, and at the
antipodes as in the old country, and as it did in the olden times. And, as an
evidence of the practical extension of the principle involved in the maxim, we
need only point to the great increase of institutions designed not only to secure
the savings of the people but to afford a profitable investment for them. The
desire to promote the welfare of the working classes (the bees of the human
hive) is one of the strongest evidences of the social progress of the age in which
we live, and the growing concern of those who are in circumstances of ease and
comfort to promote the well-being of their less favoured and more numerous
brethren, affords us the best assurance of the continuance of this feeling
Those, whose daily subsistence is dependent upon their daily toil, have
peculiar claims upon the public interest, and it is a moral obligation on the part
of men who, by station or acquirements, are in a position to command the
attention of society, to foster and encourage habits of providence, which tend
perhaps as much as any of the moral virtues to increase the self-respect and true
happiness of their less fortunate countrymen.
It is not in the turmoil of political excitement that the welfare of the
working classes is to be promoted ; it is not by leading them to believe that they
are an oppressed and injured people, that their social progress is to be advanced;
it is not by indoctrinating them with ideas of imaginary grievances, that their
habits of self-respect are to be cherished ; it is not by these means that we can
best contribute to promote the object we profess to have in view, namely, the
well-being and advancement of our fellow men. No —our first aim should be to
inculcate those habits of industry, temperance, and prudence which raise the
moral standard of a people—which contribute to individual happiness, and are
found the greatest safeguards to the maintenance of law and order.
Give a man something to lose and you give him something to protect; let
it be property or let it be character, you give him an interest in himself, in his
own well-being, and advancement in the social scale: you find him possessed of
a degree of self-respect which an improvident man never can acquire ; you find
in him a good husband, a good father, and a good citizen.
Second only to the educational establishments of a country to promote
good citizenship are the institutions upon the history and the progress of which
I have undertaken to address you this evening; and it would form a very inte-
resting subject of inquiry to analyse the statistics of the Savings’ Bank in this
colony, so that we might arrive at a correct classification of the depositors accord-
ing to the trades and occupations to which they belong. Statistics of this nature


form a true index to the social well-being and progress of a community ; for as
accumulations are made in a greater or less degree, so may we judge of the
wealth, comfort, and advancement, or the reverse, of the great bulk of our
fellow-men.
This inquiry, however, I have neither the leisure nor the means of prose-
cuting ; but I have thought it may not be uninteresting to sketch the history
of the rise and progress of these institutions at home, and to make some few
observations upon the progress of our own very valuable establishment.
It may not be generally known that Savings’ Banks are of English origin,
and are amongst the inventions of the present century. We owe their institu-
tion to the exertions of a benevolent lady, Mrs. Priscilla Wakefield, residing at
Tottenham, near London, who in the year 1604 induced six gentlemen to
receive deposits from labourers and servants, and to he responsible for their
safety and return, when needed, to the depositors, with 5 per cent, interest
thereon, provided the sum were not less than 205., and had remained a year at
least in their hands ; deposits of not less than Is. were received.
In 1808, eight individuals, of whom four were ladies —you see to what an
extent we are indebted to the ladies for the introduction of these valuable
institutions—took upon themselves the like responsibility at Bath, engaging to
pay 4 per cent, interest upon all deposits up to .£5O, hut limiting to .£2OOO,
the whole sum to he deposited. In the same year, Mr. Whitbread tried, hut
without success, to procure legislative sanction for a plan whereby the small
savings of the industrious labourer and artizan would be placed under the safe-
guard of public commissioners.
The first “Savings’ Bank” regularly organized (so far as I can trace
them) was “the Parish Bank Friendly Society of Kuthwell” in Dumfrieshire,
established through the exertions of Mr. Henry Duncan, in 1810 ; and it was
mainly owing to its success that many other institutions were formed upon the
model of that at Buthwell, so that, before any legislative provision was made
for their encouragement, there existed seventy savings’ banks in England, four
in Wales, and four in Ireland.
In the year 1817 two acts received the Koyal assent, for encouraging the
establishment of hanks for savings in England, Wales, and Ireland ; hut it was
not until 1835 that these institutions were placed under legislative regulation in
Scotland; a circumstance which in all prohality is to he ascribed to the facilities
given by bankers in that part of the kingdom for the profitable deposit with
them of small sums.
Under the Acts of 1817, the sums deposited were placed by the trustees of
each hank in the hands of the Commissioners for the Deduction of the National
Debt, who thereupon issued debentures for the amount bearing interest at the
rate of 3d. per cent, per diem, or A 4 lls. 3d. per cent, per annum.
It was customary for the trustees to allow 4 per cent, only to the depositors,
retaining the balance of the interest to defray the necessary charges of the
establishment for office rent, clerks, &c.
The progress of these Savings’ Banks, after receiving the sanction of the
Legislature, became a matter of national importance, not only as affording means
for judging concerning the actual and comparative condition of those classes of


persons who made deposits from time to time, but also as incentives to prudence,
and in some degree, too, as security for good citizenship among a very numerous
body now numbering more than a million of our fellow-subjects, who are thus
made to feel that they, too, have an interest in the stability of Government, and
something to lose from acts of violence.
In the thirteen years following the passing of the Act of 1817, no less a
sum than .£15,677,503 was deposited with the Commissioners for the Reduction
of the National Debt, the greater part of which appears to have been perma-
nently lodged, since the sum remaining in deposit in the year 1830 is stated to
have been £13,507,565, in the names of 412,217 depositors. In 1836 the
depositors had increased to 599,326, and the sum deposited to £18,805,884,
In 1840 there were 798,055 depositors, and the deposits amounted to
£23,471,050. In 1846 there were over a million depositors, and £31,743,250
deposited. This sum was calculated to be equal to 245. per head upon the popu-
lation of England, Wales, and Ireland; and 10s. Id. per head on that of Scot-
land. The comparative smallness of the deposits in Scotland arose, not from
the absence of a disposition to save, for the thriftiness of our countrymen north
of the Tweed is proverbial, but from two causes —first, the system of allowing
interest on very small sums deposited in private and joint-stock banks; and,
secondly, the more recent connection of Savings’ Tanks with the Government in
that part of the kingdom.
The advantage held forth by the Government, as an inducement to the
working man to save a portion of his earnings, was greater under the Act of 1817
than it is at present. There was no restriction then placed upon depositors as to
the amount of their savings, and they might make investments in as many
different Savings’ Banks as they liked and could effect. In time, however,
persons, not contemplated by the law in framing the Act, finding they could
secure a higher fate of interest than was yielded by investments in the public
funds, used the Savings’ Banks to an inconvenient extent. The Act ol 1824
was, therefore, passed limiting the amount that might be» deposited the first
year to £SO, and all future yearly deposits to £3O, with the further restriction
that no person should receive interest upon any amount beyond £2OO, and that
no person should be allowed to have deposits in more than one Savings’ Bank.
In 1828 the rate of interest was reduced to per cent, per diem, or £3
Bs. s|d. per cent, per annum; the largest sum to be received in any one year
was 4'30, and £l5O the largest sum upon which interest would be paid to any.
one depositor.
In 1833 the Savings’ Banks’ laws were made to extend to the Channel
Islands, and in 1835 they were made to embrace Scotland.
The latest Act, I believe, for the regulation of these institutions was passed
in 1844 : it further lowered the rate of interest to per cent, per annum,
reducing to 2d. per cent, per diem, or £3 0 lOd. per cent, per annum, the
allowance to depositors.
It was feared that the reduction of the rate of interest might be found to
exercise a baneful influence upon the savings of the people ; but the result has
proved otherwise. By the latest returns made to Parliament it appears that
the total number of Savings’ Banks in the United Kingdom at the end of the


’Y-a, 6
year 1855 was 591. The annual expense of management was £113,423;
the number of accounts open was 1,301,422 ; and the total amount deposited
£34,135,525, being at the average rate of £26 4s. 7d. per head on the
depositors, and about 30s. per head on the estimated total population.
When we think of this enormous capital, exceeding as it does that of tlie
Bank of England, made up too of small savings, we cannot fail to perceive the
great commercial, as well as social, importance of these institutions.
So ill, however, had this money been farmed by the Commissioners for the
Reduction of the National Debt that in the year 1843 they had less stock by
two millions than the capital pai l to them ought to represent; and in 1850
Sir Charles Wood stated pub'icly that the loss to the Government by this
mysterious management of the funds of the Savings’ Banks had amounted to
no less a sum than two millions and a half. The belief is, that the operations
by which the funds of the Savings’ Banks so seriously suffered were necessitated
by the financial exigencies of the Government between the years 1834 and
1843. The deposits, however, being invested on the responsibility of the
Government and in public securities, the loss does not fall upon the depositors.
The nation will have to make good the deficiency which, by a perpetuation of
this mismanagement, is supposed at the present time to exceed five millions
sterling.
This enormous loss may be accounted for in the following manner : —ln
prosperous times money is saved ; in bad times it is wanted. In prosperous
times, of very necessity, the funds are high ; in bad times the funds are low ;
—therefore, if money is invested at (say) 98 and sold out at (say) 92, we may
readily imagine how easily, under such a system, five millions may have been
dropped in the investment and re-investment of a capital exceeding thirty millions,
distributed over the period of twenty years.
It cannot be disputed that a system of speculation, by which so large a loss
has accrued to the nation, is an unsound one, and the fact of a new Savings’
Bank Bill having been introduced by the Chancellor of tli£ Exchequer during
the last session of Parliament to remedy this evil, proves that the employment
by the Government of the funds of the Savings’ Banks, as they have hitherto
been used, is opposed to established principles of finance, and calls urgently for
reform.
I have perhaps dwelt too long upon the history and progress of Savings’
Banks in the mother country ; too long certainly to admit of my giving even
passing notice to the progress of similar institutions in other European coun-
tries, in the United States of America, or in the other colonies of the British
Empire. An extended enquiry of this nature would occupy a much greater
space of time than I would venture to trespass upon your attention, even if I
had the leisure myself to prosecute the inquiry; suffice it to say, that they
have become of universal establishment in all civilised countries.
Mr. Porter, in his valuable work on “ The Progress of the Nation,” says,
“ The advantages of Savings’ Banks considered only in their economical effects
are very great, but these advantages sink into insignificance in comparison with
the moral benefits they are calculated to confer. On the one hand, the feeling
of honest independence which must to some extent be felt by every depositor,


cannot fail to have a beneficial influence upon his character. ’ He is no longer
forced, at the first approach of sickness or adversity, to become a candidate
for the pauper’s portion, but can draw upon a store of his own accumulating lor
subsistence. On the other hand, every person who entrusts his savings to
these institutions becomes by that means additionally and personally interested
in the stability of the institutions of the country in which he lives.”
Such being the opinion of a great writer on political economy in the
mother country, with which you will pardon me that I fortify myself—for
there’s nothing like having a good authority on one’s side —i will proceed to
give you a'sketch of the rise and progress of the New South Wales Bank,
founded upon the principles of its English prototype, and you will be able to
compare the amount of success which has attended our own institution with that
which we have seen to have been achieved at home.
I think I shall be able to show you that the Savings’ Bank in Sydney has
attained a degree of popular favour and support unprecedented in the history of
these establishments in the mother country; and that the superior advantages it
offers for the investment of the savings of the working classes constitute it one
of the most valuable institutions in the' Country.
The earliest approximation to a Savings’ Bank in this colony, so far as I
have been able to ascertain, was, as in England, of private institution. It was
established in 1817 or 1818 by Mr. Robert Campbell, one of the oldest and
most respected merchants of those days, but whether of his own motion, or at
the instigation of Governor Macquarie, I have been unable positively to learn ,
for you must recollect that we are now going back to the dark ages of the colony,
to times which many good colonists of the present day wish to sink into obliv ion,
but for my part I think they are not without their moral —for if within the
period allotted to a single generation, from such beginnings so marvellous a
social and material progress has been made, what may we not expect to be the
result of the industry and enterprise of another generation, under the happy
auspices of that civil and religious liberty which we so abundantly enjoy ?
We will assume Mr. Campbell to have been (as I believe he was) a man of
philanthropic views and benevolent disposition, who, to induce the prison popu-
lation of those days to lay by what little they might earn by extra labour, and
by gratuities for good conduct, opened a sort of liliputian bank for the receipt of
deposits, upon which he allowed a certain rate of interest (some t h or 8 per cent,
I believe). It is certain that the prisoners’ money (under the sanction of the
Government) was handed over by the surgeon-superintendent of each ship, on.
arrival, to Mr. Campbell, who, acting as treasurer, was made responsible for the
funds so deposited. The scheme thus came to be known as the Prisoners
Bank” ; but of the extent of its operations, of the details of its management, and
the amount of good it effected, I regret that I have failed to obtain any satis-
factory information.
The first movement for the establishment of a regular Savings’ Bank
originated with Mr. George Miller, and was instituted under the Act 2, Wm.
IY. No. 13, during the administration of the late Sir Richard Bourke, in the year
1832. The Governor was president, and a board of nine trustees was appointed
to manage the affairs. They consisted of the late Judge Dowling, vice president;


the present Mr. Justice Therry, Colonel Shadforth, Mr. Wentworth, Thomas
Walker, James Chisholm, William Macpherson, John Blaxland, and E. Deas
Thompson—names all known and highly respected in this community. They
held their first meeting at the Court House, King-street, on the 26th July, 1832,
and conferred the office of accountant on Mr. George Miller.
The loan of Jg 100 was made by the Government to enable the trustees to
commence operations, and Mr. James Chisholm granted the use of a room in
his house in George-street, gratuitously, for 12 months, for an office.
The Act of Council authorised 5 per cent, interest on deposits not to
exceed £lOO, and restricted the trustees to loans on mortgages, or good bills,
having not less than three names, at 8 per cent, interest. No loan to exceed
<£soo.
In the four months and a half, which ended the year 1832, the sum of
£2981 was deposited by 157 depositors.
In the year 1833, the deposits increased to £l-5,255, and the number of
depositors to 2549. In this year the funds deposited with Mr. Campbell, as
before stated, amounting to £2295 were transferred by order of the Government
to the bank, and from this period, I believe, that gentleman ceased to carry on
the arrangement which for fifteen years may be supposed to have conferred
great benefits on the unfortunate outcasts, for whose use it had been projected.
In the year 1834, the original Act was amended by the Act 5, Wm. IV.,
No. 16, by which the number of trustees was extended to eighteen, and this Act
was again amended and consolidated in the year 1839, by the Act 3 Victoria,
No. 12.
In the year 1838 Branch Banks were established in Parramatta, AVindsor,
Maitland and Bathurst, and in seven years from the first establishment of the
Bank in 1832, ending with 1839, the number of depositors had increased from
157 to 4163, and the deposits from £2981 to £106,182. This sum does not
include the deposits in the Branch Banks established the previous year, which
amounted to between £7OOO and £BOOO.-
Now, considering that the population of the colony in 1839 did not exceed
114,000, of which number nearly one-third were in servitude, these figures show
a large degree of success for the operations of sc short a period—being at the
rate of about twenty shillings per head on the total population.
A short Act was passed in 1840, known as 4 Vic., No. 15, legalizing
certain acts of the trustees, not provided for in former Acts, and in the following
year—lB41—another Act was passed, known as 5 Vic. No. 5, establishing a
Savings’ Bank at Port Phillip, distinct from the institution in Sydney, of which
I may°have a few words to say by-and-by. All these different amending and
extending Acts following each other from year to year, show the progress of the
institution and the anxiety of the Government of the day to provide for its
conduct on sound principles.
In the three years from 1839 to 1842, the deposits increased over 50 per
cent., namely, from £106,082 to £165,171, and the depositors from 4163 to
5493.
You all know the disasters which overtook the colony about the period at
which I have now arrived —disasters having their origin in extravagance and


over-speculation, and bringing bankruptcy and ruin upon all classes of tbe com-
munity. Our imports had doubled our exports for several years past; in 1839
they were in excess more than a million and a quarter, and in 1840 and 1841,
over a million and a half; whilst the amount invested in land, the price of which
was then 12s. per acre, was .£316,626 —an amount that (with all our plethora
of gold, and pastoral, mining, agricultural, and commercial wealth) the sales have
never reached since, except as I find, in the year 1854, when the sales reached
£319,583; and in this year we shall find a corresponding falling off in the
deposits in the Bank.
The failure of the Bank of Australia, which had fed the mania for specu-
lation by a wholesale system of discounting and in which many of the leading
merchants and settlers were involved, occurred in 1843, and caused a panic
among the depositors in the Savings’ Bank. A rumour was circulated that the
trustees had been discounting bills with the funds of the bank to an unsafe extent.
It was known that some of the trustees were involved in the downfall of the
Bank of Australia—confidence was destroyed—and on the Ist May, 1843, a
run was made on the Savings’ Bank, the doors of the institution were besieged
by clamorous depositors, and £22,666 was withdrawn from the bank in two
days—a sum, perhaps, more difficult to raise at that period than ten times the
amount would be at the present time. At the end of the year, no less than
1837 depositors were found to have withdrawn their savings, amounting in the
aggregate to £50,000. This was a sore trial to the institution, but it stood the
test nobly. The resources of the Bank were found so ample and elastic, that
no difficulty was experienced by the trustees, even in those hard times, to meet
every claim as it came in.
To restore the public confidence the Government introduced a Bill into the
Council prohibiting the discounting of bills ; and this mode of employing the
funds of the Bank has not been resorted to since. As a substitute for it the Ac t
known as 7 Vic., No. 6, provides that two-thirds of the funds shall be invested
in Government securities, and one-third in good mortgages.
Confidence, however, was not soon restored ; the effects of the panic were
felt for several years, and the depression under which the colony laboured up to
the year 1850 did not permit the deposits to reach what they lost in 1843.
In each of the years 1845 and 1846, two short Acts were passed for the
further regulating the management of the Savings’ Banks both in Sydney and
Port Phillip. One of the Acts of 1846 authorised the expenditure of £3OOO
upon the building of suitable offices on a parcel of land granted by her Majesty
for the purpose; and the present commodious building in Barrack-street,
Wynyard-square, was completed at a cost of £3OOO, and opened for business
in January, 1850.
In ldso, a Branch Bank was established at Singleton, a fact which affords
a strong indication of returning agricultural prosperity in the district of the
Upper Hunter, and of the restoration of that confidence which had been
destroyed in 1843.
The returning confidence was more strikingly evinced in the following year;
as we find in 1851, the depositors had increased to 5550, being 57 more than
in 1342, and the deposits reached £199,261 ; that is, £34,090 in excess of


what they were nine years before. The population of 1851 was 187,243, so
that the amount deposited was at the rate of =£2 Is. 3|d, per head. Thus,
again w e see the establishment advancing in numbers and prosperity, and
enjoying the confidence and favour of the community.
W e must not, however, in connection with this improvement in the affairs
of the Bank, fail to notice the extraordinary discovery which distinguishes
above every other the year 1851, and which will ever form the most remark-
able epoch in the history of the Australian colonies. The discovery of gold,
in the early part of that year, as it gave an impetus to the languishing energies
of the people, had a wonderfully favourable effect upon the Banking Institu-
tions of the country, in which we find the Savings’ Bank largely partaking ;
for the following year, 1852, the returns exhibit the enormous addition of
£200,469 to the deposits, and an accession of ’ 995 to the number of depositors,
being at the rate of over £IOO per head.
During this year a Branch Bank was established at Goulburn, to supply
the wants of that thriving district.
The year 1853 witnessed a further addition to the deposits in the Central
Establishment of £152,610, and an increase of 1350 to the number of depo-
sitors. Taking the two years, 1852 and 1853 together, w'e find, in a popula-
tion not exceeding 200,000 persons, no less a sum than £353,079 deposited in
the Savings’Bank by 3345 depositors; being at the rate of £lO5 lls. Id.
per head on the depositors ; and £1 ss. 3d. per head on every man, woman,
and child in the country —a fact, I believe, unparalleled in the history of these
institutions.
In the year 1853 the Act of Council, under the provisions of which the
Bank is at present managed, received her Majesty’s assent by the hands of the
late Governor, Sir Charles Fitz Hoy.
By it all the former Acts were repealed, and their provisions amended and
consolidated : the trustees are incorporated into a body corporate or politic,
and are made capable in law to sue and be sued. All land and hereditaments,
bonds, mortgages, and other securities belonging to the Bank are invested in the
trustees for the benefit of the depositors, with power to take, hold, and convey.
The Governor is President, and the Board of Management consists of eighteen
trustees (of whom one is. appointed Vice-President), besides the managing
trustee ; five trustees form a quorum ; and no trustee is permitted to deposit or
borrow money, nor directly nor indirectly to receive any salary or emolument
from the funds of the Bank, save and excepting the managing trustee, by whom
the daily business of the Bank is conducted, and who gives security for the due
and faithful discharge of his duties. The expenses of management are, of
course, defrayed out of the profits of the institution. And it is a very remark-
able fact that, with an amount of business exceeded only by two or-three of the
most wealthy banking institutions in this city, the cost of management last year,
in town and country, amounted only to £2791.
The trustees are empowered to make rules for the conduct and manage-
ment of the affairs and business of the Bank, subject, however, to the approval
of the Governor, and also to regulate the rate of interest to be paid to the
depositors from time to time.


Suras of money as low as one shilling, up to <£2oo, arc received, but
interest is payable upon no sums less than twenty shillings. The ordinary rate
of interest paid to depositors is 5 per cent, per annum, and the trustees are
empowered to limit the interest so as not to be payable on the surplus of any
account exceeding £lOO, if they think fit.
The law provides for the.investment of the funds of the bank by deposit
in the Colonial Treasury, or in any- of the banks of the colony, at such rate of
interest as may be agreed upon, or in the purchase of debentures or other
public securities. It also provides that any portion of the funds, not exceeding
one-half of the whole moneys deposited, and in sums not exceeding £5OOO to
any one person, may be lent on, mortgage of real estates. Investments in bank
bills are also authorised under certain restrictions, if they offer profitable em-
ployment of the funds of the bank. lam not aware, however, that this last
mode of investment has been resorted to of late years ; good mortgages and
Government securities being plentiful and offering a profitable rate of interest.
A balance sheet is prepared every year, containing a true statement of the
deposits in the bank, and of the balance to its credit at the end of the year,
which, after being certified by the trustees, is submitted to the Governor, and
published in the Government Gazette. The Governor appoints district trustees
for the country branches, and the trustees in Sydney appoint the district
accountants, who are required to give security for the duly accounting for
moneys deposited in their hands, which moneys they are required to remit
monthly to the managing trustee in Sydney. It will thus be seen that every
possible means is devised for the secure custody and profitable investment of
the funds deposited in the establishment whether paid in Sydney or in the
country branches. As an evidence of the confidence of the public, it is suffi-
cient to state that the balance sheet of the institution on the 81st December,
1856, showed a sum of £667,420 15s. 2d. at the credit of the bank.
This sura is at the rate of £64 6s, 7d. per head for each depositor, and
£2 IDs. Ifd. per head on the total population of the colony—the depositors
being as 1 in 25 of the total population.
I must here stop to point out what I believe to be a novel feature in the
management of Savings’ Banks, and that is the establishment of a “ Reserved
Fund.” It is intended as a sort of safety valve to the institution, to meet any
contingencies that may arise out of the common way, such as any sudden
demand or run upon the bank, similar to that which we have seen to have taken
place in 1843 ; a contingency unprovided for in any other institution of the
kind, and certainly not to be apprehended again in the instance of our own
establishment. This fund is fed annually out of the profits of the bank, after
paying the fixed rate of interest upon the deposits.
The present amount to the credit of this fund is £83,684, which has
accumulated since the year 1853, at the same time that the usual rate of interest
has accrued to the depositors without any abatement. No greater instance of
the prosperity of the bank, or of the success of its management can be adduced
or called for.
We have seen that, in 1841, a Savings’ Bank was established at Port
Phillip, and it may be interesting to compare the progress made by that iustitu-


tion with what we have shown to have been made by our own. It would not
unreasonably be inferred, from the rapid advance of Victoria in wealth and
population, that the Savings’ Bank in Melbourne would be found participating
largely in the general prosperity, more particularly so, as the mining wealth of
the colony has been produced principally by that class of persons for whose use
and benefit institutions of this kind have been established ; and yet what has
been the result ? How different to that which might have been expected. I
find by a return made on the Ist July, 1855, fourteen years after its establish-
ment, that the number of its depositors was only 2502, and the total amount
of deposits only .£173,088, being at the rate of £69 3s. 7d. per head on
the depositors, but barely 10s. per head on what may be assumed to have been
the total population of the colony at that date ; that is, about £2 per head less
than we have seen to be the total amount of deposits in our own establishment.
We have reason, I think, to be satisfied with the result of this comparison,
for it affords evidence of a degree of successful industry, combined with pru-
dence highly to the honour and credit of our own community.
Branch Banks have lately been opened at the following places in this
colony, Newcastle, Wollongong, Sofala, and Brisbane, but none of these have
made much progress as yet.
Of the branches in working operation, that established in Windsor in 1838
has been the most successful. Parramatta follows next; then Maitland ; and

The statistics ot Savings Tanks in Great Britain snow very remarkable
fluctuations, and as wide a range as regards the proportion of depositors to the
population, the average sums deposited, and the sums deposited per head of the
total population, as has been shown to exist in New South Wales.
I have prepared a table exhibiting a few of these fluctuations, and the
range in different counties in the four great divisions of the Empire ; hut it is
quite unnecessary that I should occupy your time by going over the figures.
You can look at them for yourselves. I will only stay to point out the singular
coincidence that the proportion of depositors to the total population is exactly
the same in the metropolitan counties of England and Scotland, and the metro-
politan district of New South Wales, viz., 1 in 9.

I am afraid I may have wearied you with the figures which have been
introduced of necessity into this paper. Statistics are
dry reading, but in the
confined, for the most part, to their own districts—it will be seen that the
district of Windsor far outstrips the others in the amount deposited, in the pro-
portion of depositors to the total population, in the average sum deposited, and
in the sum deposited per head, of the total population.
To what cause the greater success of the Windsor Bank is to be attributed,
lam not at the present moment prepared to say. Whether arising from the
exertions of the local directors, or from the more industrious and thrifty habits
of the people, it bears evidence of an amount of industry, prudence, and prospe-
rity, of which it would be gratifying to find more frequent instances in other
districts, not less favored by nature.
The statistics of Savings’ Banks in Great Britain show very remarkable
fluctuations, and as wide a range as regards the proportion of depositors to the
population, the average sums deposited, and the sums deposited per head of the


absence of facts accurately recorded and methodically classified we cannot
safely draw comparisons. It is to tabular statements of facts and observations
carefully collected that we look in the present day to rectify erroneous theories,
and to deduce principles which affect the interests and well-being of mankind.
Supposing your patience not to be already exhausted I will take leave to add
a few remarks bearing upon the advantages which Savings’ Banks offer to the
small tradesman, mechanic, artizan, and to the working classes generally for
the investment of tlieir savings, as well as upon the public gain which individual
savings bring to the community at large, and the elevating moral effect which
habits of prudence cannot fail to produce.
You have already been enlightened as to the principles upon which the
institution in Sydney is conducted, and the facilities afforded for the reception
of savings not less than 2s. _ .
Now, there is hardly a small tradesman, mechanic, or labourer in the
country, who under ordinary circumstances cannot, if he will, lay by his 20s.
per month, or say his <£lo per annum.
He must remember that this is not an unproductive deposit, but that, by
yearly accretions of interest, in the short space of 14 years, the sum will be
doubled, and this without any risk, expense, or trouble on his part.
Let him extend his deposits over the spaces of five or ten years, to £IOO or
£2OO, in his own name or in those of his wife or children, and he will find
himself growing a rich man.
He has something to look to if evil days come upon him ; and how much
more independent, manly, and elevated will his feelings be than those of his less
provident neighbour, who, when the evil day arrives, finds himself exposed to
the cold charity of the heartless world around him, and reduced to take refuge
beneath the sheltering but humiliating roof which the country provides for the
helpless and needy.
There is no one who contemplates the position of the two men, who would
not condemn the thriftless folly of the one, and praise the independent foresight
of the other —the one is an encumbrance, whilst the other is a credit to his
country and a blessing to his family. He is deeply interested in the mainten-
ance of the laws and institutions of his country, and lifts its voice with manly
pride in their cause. He is elevated in the social scale, and his self-respect
makes others respect him.
These remarks apply personally to the individual depositor, and here lies the
advantage which Savings’ Banks and Friendly Societies have over institutions
for Life” Insurance, viz., that the individual not only makes provision for his
family, but creates a fund which is available at any moment to meet reverses
(whether arising from sickness or otherwise) which may fall upon himself.
I would not be understood to disparage the benefits held out by societies for
life assurance, the value of which it is impossible to o\ er-estimate. On the
contrary, I should be glad to see the peculiar advantages of these societies and
the principles upon which they are worked popularly treated by some gentleman
thoroughly acquainted with the subject, and served up for your information on
some future occasion. My object is merely to show in what way advantageous
to the depositor himself the Savings’ Bank differs from Assurance Societies.


These advantages, however, are not confined to the individual himself, since
deposits are permitted in the names of infants, so that on the birth of a child
the father may open an account in his or her name, and the sum so deposited
will go on accumulating and form a handsome provision for the child on its
launching into the world, at a time, perhaps, when the father’s means of helping
his children may not be so good as they were when in the full vigour of health
and manhood.
And what a consolation would it not prove to a parent, broken down, it
may be by sickness or misfortune, that in the days of his prosperity he had
been enabled, and under Providence disposed to lay by something, if only
a little, as a provision for the wife of his bosom, and for the helpless little
ones whom he can no longer assist, and may be about to leave behind him. I
say that man’s emotions, if he possesses any right feeling, nay, even the com-
monest feelings of humanity, must be those of calm resignation. He feels that
he has done his duty whilst God gave him the ability, and he commits himself
and his family with perfect confidence into the hands of Him who ordereth all
things for our good ; who is a father to the fatherless, and upholdeth the cause
of the widow. The extent to which the advantages held out by these institu-
tions have been availed of, bears gratifying evidence that the feelings I have
endeavoured to describe have no small influence in this community.
Of the 46,536 depositors who have opened accounts with the Savings’ Bank
in this city of Sydney, since its first institution in 1832, who can tell the
amount of misery and destitution their timely providence has been the means
of averting ? Who can tell the amount of wealth and independence to which
their thrift and industry have led.
In a young country like this, whose history is comprehended within the span
of a single lifetime, having out-lived the stigma of its origin, and just budding
into life and beauty, with a destiny to fulfil which as yet we view but dimly—
it behoves those who occupy positions of influence to inculcate by precept and
example those duties and virtues which conduce to the happiness and prosperity
of the people.
Habits of industry and providence are amongst the most valuable moral
qualities; and many a man whom you now see in the enjoyment of ease and
opulence in this city of yours, will tell you that he owes his success in life to
the exercise of these habits, and that he was encouraged to them and
strengthened in them by the advantages which the valuable institution, of which
I have been speaking, offered for the investment of his savings. And what
must be the effect upon the character of a people where these habits are not of
individual but of universal practice ? It must elevate them in the social scale ;
it must beget those feelings of self-reliance, and self-respect which lead to noble
achievements and command the respect and admiration of mankind. And look
to the eflect that the accumulated savings of a thriving and industrious people
must have upon the material prosperity of the nation in which they are found ;
the impetus to enterprise, the incitement to individual industry and prudence,
the accession of wealth, the extension of commerce, and, what is of more value
still, the raising of the moral tone and character of the community.
What a field do the trackless bounds of this vast continent teeming with


richness, and wooing the stalwart arm of industry present to Australian activity
and enterprise to work in ! With no depressing influences to keep us back; no
accumulation of wretchedness and penury festering in our streets and devouring
the profits of our toil; with no material obstacle to retard our progress, what is
there to prevent our becoming a great and happy people ? Let us, then, be
true to ourselves, and by the exercise of all those manly virtues which have ever
been the characteristics of our race, let us strive to direct the energies and the
enterprise of our countrymen into those channels which will advance and ele-
vate us in the scale of nations—which will contribute to individual happiness
and contentment, and prove that we know how to value the blessings and the
freedom which under Providence we so largely enjoy.
Many of the most zealous supporters of Mechanics’ Institutes in the
mother country have long and earnestly urged the expediency of annexing
Savings’ Banks to these institutions. lam not aware whether their views have
in any instance been brought into practical effect, but the suggestion shows the
estimation in which they are held by men who are foremost in promoting the
moral, social, and intellectual well-being of their fellow creatures, and it has
given me confidence in introducing the subject of Savings’ Banks to your notice,
that I was not travelling beyond the range of subjects appropriate to the occa-
sion, nor inviting your attention inconsiderately to the history and working of
one of the most interesting and. valuable institutions which this colony
possesses.
And now permit me, before I close this paper, to give expression to the
gratification it has afforded me to meet you here this night. I could not resist
the pleasure when it was proposed to me to do my little—small though it may
be, to promote the interests of this admirable institution. There is much in the
design and constitution of this and similar societies to enlist the warm sympathies
of every enlightened colonist. In a country advancing as this has done at high
pressure speed, where a course of industry and enterprise has elevated many to
opulence ; where large numbers are drawn together by the golden attractions it
presents, and where the means of education are so inadequate to the requirements
of the people, it is most expedient that institutions of this character should meet
with active and hearty support. The influences of European civilization and
modern enlightenment are here made to tell upon the working and industrious
classes of the community, penetrating and vivifying the whole mass, and
diffusing a new spirit and higher feelings into the dry recesses of laborious toil.
In the busy and engrossing occupations of this city it is well that there
are those who, like your excellent President, devote themselves to the advance-
ment of education, and to the promotion of the higher objects of man’s exist-
ence. In the eager pursuit of wealth we are too apt to forget that there are
higher aims and nobler aspirations within the heart of man seeking for
ascendancy; and it is to encourage these aspirations, and to promote these aims
that institutions of this kind are so valuable : they afford food for the manly
intellect and encouragement to the exercise of manly virtue.
The clerk and the professional man—the mechanic and the operative may
here find improvement, which will throw a charm over the weariness of his
labour, and enjoyment that will lighten his daily care. The youthful aspirant


after fame may here find food to satisfy Ms cravings, and scope for the expansion
of his intellect; and here may he ripened into greatness the genius which
shall inspire some future Australian Hampden to the regeneration and advance-
ment of his country.
Looking to the past progress of this country, to what height may not our
aspiration for its future greatness soar when the civilization of its still untrodden
wastes shall have attained its full development; and what I would wish to
impress upon you all is the deep responsibility which rests upon you in your day
and generation to help on that glorious destiny, which, like the dim shadow of a
man’s hand, can as yet but faintly be distinguished on the verge of the far horizon.
We have all our allotted work ; let us not stop in the career of usefulness
assigned to us. Depend upon it, our highest aims are all attainable if we are
true to ourselves, if we will only rise to what we might be. Each one of us,
no matter how humble his calling, or how contracted his sphere, can do much ;
not by overweening notions of his own capacity, not by endeavouring to escape
from the sphere which a wise and merciful Providence has assigned to him, but
by an honest and conscientious perseverance in the discharge of his duty, to
smooth the troubled elements of daily life, and to minister to the happiness and
advancement of his species. Let us know and feel that upon our efforts—upon
our exertions in the cause of instruction and of virtue, depends the character
which will be stamped on our successors ; —if by example and by precept we
inculcate habits of industry and self-reliance, prudence and virtue upon our
children —if, by the promotion of education, by fostering and extending the range
of such institutions as these, we give a right direction to the aspiring tendencies
of the youthful generation by which we are surrounded; if we strive to elevate
their aims, and to cultivate their intellects, to kindle the genial lamp of know-
ledge until it illuminates the darkest corner of the land, till there shall be no
abode of ignorance unenlightened, no home of honest industry uncheered, no
solitary shepherd’s hut without a gleam of that glorious light which the great
truths of Christianity impart,—then may we, whilst we judge of ourselves with
humility, trust that we are raising up a generation that may become in the eyes
of surrounding nations, and above all, in the eyes of Him who judgeth not as
man judges, a wise and understanding people.
