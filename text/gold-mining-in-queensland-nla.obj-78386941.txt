QUEENSLAND.
\Reprinted from the British Australasian.]
This, the youngest of the Australasian Colonies, has only just completed
the first quarter of a century of its existence; yet its leap into power
and importance, its development of wealth and natural resources, and
the discoveries made of its auriferous and other mineral treasures, have
already been so vast, so remarkable, that rendering anything like a
faithful description of the known resources and prospective development
of this young and vigorous portion of our Empire may appear to the
British public in the light of an effort of the imagination. But to those
who have had experience of Queensland?s immense resources we are
dealing with what is already a well known fact. The geographical posi-
tion of the Colony, with its enormous sea-board of 2,500 miles, its prox-
imity to New Guinea and command of the Torres Strait, is destined to
give it a powerful and increasing influence among the-governing powers
of the Australasian group; while its climate and its resources, about
which we shall have a great deal more to say on other occasions, ad-
mirably adapt the Colony to be the happy home of millions of people.
Queensland in its tastefully arranged Court at the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition makes an excellent display of its mineral wealth, but certainly
the most prominent and attractive section is that illustrative of its
gold production. It should be premised that in Queensland the auri-
ferous gold-bearing country stretches over about 1,000 miles from north
to south, and in places is several hundred miles in width. A well
arranged twelve sided stand has been erected in the centre of the main
Court, showing specimens of gold ores from the various and often
widely separated goldfields of the Colony, the principal of which are the
Palmer, Eavenswood, Charters Towers, Norton, Rockhampton, Etheridge
and Gympie. The last being the oldest of these goldfields, we will
commence our description with it, and will express in passing a word of
regret that a greater number of mines from this rich field are not repre-
sented in the collection befoi e us. Gympie does not lack enter-
prise in the Colony. Gympie is the southern goldfield, and was opened
up in 1861, upon the discoveries of a Mr Nash. According to the report
of the Hon. A. C. Gregory?? The general strike of the rocks # on the
Gympie goldfield is N.W. and the dip S.W, the auriferous veins or reefs
average a little W. of N. but the band of the greatest auriferous develop,
ment is parallel to the strike, or N.W., crossing the reefs diagonally,
so that the productive portion of each is seldom of any great length, and
* Direction of the strata.


is sometimes cut oft: by slides in the rock which dip N.E. and bear
N.W.? There is on the Gympie goldfield a European population of
6,935, of whom 1,450 are engaged in quartz mining. From the annual
reports of the Department of Mines, the total crushings and yields of
gold are given for the past ten years, which fully show the stability and
richness of this goldfield.

The total production of gold from the Gympie goldfield up to the end of 1885
has been 1,129,963 ozs of gold.
The above table is a truly splendid record of results. The Gympie
exhibits of ore are samples of gold quartz from five of the leading mines :
?? Nos. 2 and 3 South Smithfield Gold Mining Company,? ? The Ellen
Harkins Gold Mining Company,? ? The Phoenix Gold Mining Com-
pany,? ? The Phoenix No. 1 North and Nos. 3 and 4 North Glanmire,?
and the gold therein is visible to the least practised eye.
Charters Towers makes a large display, and exhibits samples of
gold ore from the following mines:?The well known ?Mosman,
the ? North Australian and Eastward Ho,? ? The Bonnie
Dundee,? the ?Hope,? the ?Day Dawn Prospecting Claim,? the
? Victory,? ? Alexandra Hill,? the ? Day Dawn Block and Myndham,
? No. 1 and 2 South West,? and the *? North Queen ? Gold Mining
Companies. The general exhibits of gold ores from this field above and
below the water level, together with samples of the enclosing locks of the
quartz veins, diorite dyke stones, and gangue of the lodes are shown by
the Charters Towers local committee. From Rishton, a rising goldfield
near Charters Towers on the Burdekin River, the Disraeli Syndicate Gold
Mining Company, an English concern whose offices are at 138 Eeadenhall
street, exhibit samples of excellent ore that will average over 2 ozs of gold
per ton. This company are engaged in completing the erection of a large
crushing and other plant, and the result of their operations will be
watched with interest. As, so far as the home market is concerned, the
Disraeli is a pioneer undertaking, it is quite possible that with good
results obtained by the first English company formed for gold mining on
this field, we may see the introduction of a large amount of British
capital into Queensland ; and evidence from the bulk samples of gold
ore on view, the really magnificent record of dividends, the general
average yield of the entire Colony, and the actual results which will be
obtained from the crushings at the Queensland stamp mill, now com-
pleted in the exhibition itself, will be the means of creating a widespread
inteiest in the Charters Towers and other Queensland goldfields.
Mr R. L. Jack, Government geologist, says : ?? The Charters Towers
goldfield includes an area of 1,700 square miles. The collection of reefs
when mapped out on paper appear to follow a definite system; they
form a sort of horseshoe bend with its convex side to the south, and
underlie towards the centre of this curve at allorw r angle. At piesent

visible gold is a rarity in the reefs; but experience shows the miners
what class of stone yields most when crushed.? Mr Gold-Warden
Selheim refers to the fact that up to the present ? nearly all the interest
is owned on the field, the formidable obstacles in developing the mines
have been overcome principally by local enterprise, and that the rewards
go to local shareholders. Combination must henceforth take the place
of individual efforts in the majority of ventures, if the field is to have a
chance of displaying its wonderful resources to their full extent.? No
better evidence can be given of the growing importance of Charters
Towers as a goldfield than the recorded facts as to the gross production
of gold since its opening in 1872, as shown in the following table:?
Yield

The yield for Charters Towers for the
year
1885 was 134,650 ozs, while the gross
amount, including that from the Cape Eiver field, makes a grand total of
1,315,221 ozs of gold.
This gives a general average of over 1 oz 13 dwts per ton since the
opening of the field, and as will be seen steady progress is made in the
quantity of stone raised and improvement in the yield as the mines
deepen. This has been recognised as a favourable characteristic of this
field, and, as proved by the year 1884, and what is known of 1885 also,
that the average yield of Charters Goldfield is now close on 2 ozs of
gold per ton, or a higher average than any other gold field in Aus-
tralia. The depths of the mines range from 200 ft to over 1,000 ft.
From Ravenswood the Ravenswood Gold Smelting Company exhibits
samples of ores from the following mines ; ?? General Grant,? ? Sunset,?
and the ? Black Jack.? This company also exhibits half a ton of ingots
containing lead, silver, and a large percentage of gold; also another
sample from the ? New England Mine.? Mr Duncan Mcï¿½ae exhibits
samples of coarse and fine jigged ores and hand-picked blende. Ravens-
wood, like Charters Towers, is connected by rail with the port of Towns-
ville, making it convenient for the economical shipment of pyrites. In
year 1884 622 tons of mundic quartz were dispatched, which yielded
3,603 ozs, or nearly 6 ozs of gold per ton. Ravenswood is noted specially
for its large quantity of pyritous ores, and the best method for their
treatment is a question that materially interests this goldfield. The
ore raised and treated from this field in 1884 was 13,202 tons, pro-
ducing 11,828 ozs of gold, or an average of 17 dwts 22 grs per ton, and
the gross yield of gold for 1885 was 176,641 ozs. The total production
from this field has been 307,580 ozs of gold.
The Norton Goldfield is represented at South Kensington by samples
of gold ores from four mines?the ? Advance Prospecting Claim,? the
?FramptonUnited,? the ?Mount Goody,? and the ?Never Never.? The
Advance Prospecting Claim shows one block of auriferous mundic stone
weighing 1 cwt 2 qrs 16 lbs, and a group of blocks of auriferous mundic


stone. Three claims are on the reef. The calcite vein in the lode forma-
tion is well marked in all the three claims. The Frampton United show
specimens of auriferous spongy silica. The Exhibitor notes as follows :
?? This reef is a large mundic vein, and splits in places into three or
four veins; they are formed by ?horses? in the throat of the upcast.
These specimens are taken from places where the splits take place, and
are like pumice stone, they are so light.? The lighter the specimens, the
richer the return for gold. The Mount Goody exhibit auriferous pyrites
and sphalirite, with a few quartz crystals, pyrites and galena, and pyrites,
sphalirite, and galena. The Never Never shows mispickel and iron
pyrites, and other specimens oi an interesting nature.
From the Etheridge goldfield, samples of gold ore are shown from
five mines. The Cumberland Prospecting Claim has given its three
fortunate shareholders 40,000Z per man during the last five years. There
is a sample of auriferous mundic, from 250 ft in depth. We read :
? The reef is at present 9tolo ft wide. The pyrites is described as
dark free mundic, which assays from 10 to 15 ozs of gold per ton.? The
Cumberland, No. 1, North, show auriferous mundic ore from the 180 ft
level. The reef is 9ft wide. The stone of this reef has assayed as
high as 27 ozs of gold per ton. Extensive machinery is in course of
erection for the treatment of the ore. The New Zealand Prospecting
Claim Company, exhibit auriferous mundic in a sample of 56 lbs taken
from 130 ft in depth. The reef is nearly vertical, 3ft wide, and assays
15 ozs of gold per ton. The Titania Reef, No. 1, shows auriferous
mundic ore from the 60ft level; and the No. 2 South Titania, fine
samples of auriferous mundic. The reef is from 3 to sft wide. The
mundic is described as being rich dark and intractable. A quantity
has been sent to England for treatment, and it is said the assays give
57 ozs of gold per ton. The total production from the Etheridge and
Wooegar goldfield was 290,566 ozs of gold.
The Palmer goldfields are represented by four mines, the ? Viking,?
the ? Hit or Miss,? the ? Queen of the North,? and the ? Comet.?* This
rich goldfield is situated on the Palmer River in the Cape York
X?*
Peninsula, and is the most northerly goldfield of Queensland. In extent
the auriferous belt covers some 2,000 square miles, and at its first
development was populated by some 20,000 people, of whom nearly
18,000 were Chinese, who were attracted there by the rich deposits of
alluvial gold that spread over a vast extent of ground. Payable gold
has been found in the bed of the Palmer, and its tributaries for a distance
of over 100 miles. Some excellent quartz reefs have been dis-
covered, but hitherto, in consequence of the small population
of Europeans, little quartz mining has yet been done, but
what has been is of a satisfactory character. The Viking
shows bulk specimens of auriferous quartz from 60 ft in depth,
and from Mr Warden St George?s Report, 170 tons of quartz
yielded over 244 ozs of gold. It is a slate and sandstone formation.
The Hit or Miss shows nice specimens of auriferous quartz. The mine
is 175 ft deep, has crushed 1,207 tons of stone for a yield of 3,572 ozs of
gold, equal to nearly 3 ozs of gold per ton. The Queen of the North
has specimens of auriferous quartz and arsenical pyrites. The mine is
at Normanby, 75 miles from Maytown, and the pyrites is said to be rich
in gold, the last 100 tons gave 2 ozs 4 dwt of gold per ton from a reef


16 in to Bft thick. The Comet has on view specimens of auriferous quartz
at various levels, andiron pvrites in a slate wall. The bulk specimens are
from 180 ft in depth, the reef 2ft thick. The result of crushing up to
August, 1885, has been 1,665 tons of stone, giving a yield of 3,619 ozs
7 dwts, or over 2 ozs of gold to the ton. The total production from the
Palmer goldfield up to 1885 has been 1,256,604 ozs of gold.
The Rockhampton goldfield is the nearest goldfield to a sea-port in
Queensland, being only 22 miles from Rockhampton, and is likely to
attain high fame in the annals of this Colony, if not indeed, as ie poit
affirms, standing out pre-eminent amongst the marvels of the world s
gold discoveries. The opening out of the ? fabulously rich Mount
Morgan Mine, enables them to show some large and remarkable speci-
mens of their gold ore, limonite, which is averaging 7oz of gold per ton.
In Mr Jack?s (Government Geologist) description of this mine in his
report to the Queensland Government, he says ? Mount Morgan
itself contains gold in a very unusual, I believe a quite unprecedented,
formation.? The mine is the summit of the mountain, 1,225 ft above
sea level. The work, apart from prospecting or exploring operations is
carried on in two quarries or faces. No. 1 cuts into the hill from a level ot
about 25ft below the summit, and is designed simply to remove the top
of the mountain for the purpose of passing it through the stampers.
No. 2, or Magazine Quarry, presents the aspect of a ?siding load, cut
out of a Steep hill, and attacks the auriferous deposit at a level of about
100 ft below No. 1. The central portion of the upper cutting is a large mass ot
brown hematite ironstone, generally in great blocks (up to some tons m
weight) with a stallactitic structure, as if the iron oxides had gradually
filled up cavities left in the original deposit. The ironstone contains gold
of extraordinary fineness, which, however, after a little practice, can be
detected in almost every fresh fracture. The ironstone is more or less
mixed with fine siliceous granules. Gradually to right and left ot the
central mass the silica more and more replaces the ironstone. It is a
frothy, spongy, or cellular sinter (rock precipitated in a crystalline foim),
sometimes so'light from the enlargement of air in its pores that it floats
in the water like pumice. Fine gold is disseminated throughout this
silicious deposit, as well as in the ironstone. Near the west end of the
cutting is a vertical dyke of kaolin, mixed with fine silicious granules,
passing into pure kaolin, with some silicates of magnesia, including a
fine variety of French chalk.? Mr Jack selected a number of specimens
characteristic of the various deposits of the upper cutting. These, when
assayed by Mr Karl Haiger, City Analyist, Brisbane, gave the following
result: ?
Stalactite brown hematite from middle cutting, 6 ozs 11 dwts of gold per ton.
Siliceous sinter veined with quartz, 4 ozs 5 dwts of gold per ton.
A mixed mass of ironstone and silica from the level of the road east of the dyke,
5 ozs 3 dwts of gold per ton.
Iron-stained siliceous sinter from west side of dyke, 10 ozs 14 dwts of gold
per ton.
Other samples assayed by Mr Haiger, selected from the town cuttings,
yielded as follows: ?
Brown hematite, 3 ozs 6 dwts of gold per ton.
Bed hematite, 6 ozs 16 dwts of gold per ton.
Aluminous rock from west of dyke ; no gold.
Siliceous sinter from among the aluminous rock, 3 ozs 15 dwts ot gold per ton.

Estimates have been indulged in as to the worth of the gold contained
in this remarkable freak of nature
and if we mention them we do so
with the reservation all such estimates require. That this foibidding-
looking stone is very rich in gold we know ; but it is said that within
Mount Morgan, from the tests alre
adv made, the ore above the present
workings has been calculated to produce gold to the value of J, 000,000/,
and the entire mount something like three times that value.
With these records and the evidence before us of the extent and ic-
sources of the Queensland goldfields, we record the conviction that tnis
Colony is destined to become the richest gold-mining country of the
Australasian group. Dispersed around this great display of gold ores
are selected specimens of golden
quartz exhibited by the following
P-cntlemen Mr Barker, Charters Towers ; Mr Hugh Mosman, one ot
the original discoverers of the Charters Towers goldfield; Mr William
Pritchard Morgan, late of Charters
Towers, and now of 1 Queen Vic-
toria street; Mr George Cavey, of
Charters Towers, and now of the
Ponlars. Brinklev, near Newmarket;
Messrs Reckett and Mills, Mount
Britten, Queensland; Mr Jacob Pearen, of Gympie; and another case
by the Queensland Commission.
Mounted on the central display is
the trust rum of a pyramid, which
represents the actual quantity of gold obtained from the mines ot this
Colony since the discovery in 1861, and up to the end of 1885 :
Total 4,8+0,564 ounces, or 148-18 tons.
Value
.. ï¿½17,623,284.
This gold is remarkably pure, and 10,000 ozs retorted at the Sydney
Mint is found to be free from silver ?a minute trace excepted.
After a careful study Mr Jack comes to the conclusion that ? nothing
but a thermal spring in the open air could have deposited the material
under consideration. The frothy siliceous sinter agrees in every respect
with the deposits of New Zealand and Iceland geysers, and of the still
more wonderful hot springs of the Yellowstone National Park.?
SECTION OF MOUNT MORGAN.
The average yield has been 1 oz 10 dwts 16 grs of gold per ton, which
is the highest average of any gold producing country in the world. It
was designed and arranged by Mr J. Longden, engineer to the Queens-
land Commission, and this gentleman has also been actively engaged in
the erection of a five-stamp crushing mill for the Queensland Commission,
which is now in operation, and' serves to illustrate the process of
crushing, amalgamating, and so forth. The Queensland Commissioners
are to be congratulated on the compendious and instructive catalogue
of the minerals exhibited, from an advanced copy of wdiich we have
gathered much information.


THE QUARTZ CRUSHING MILL.
One of the most interesting ceremonies in connection with the Exhibition
took place on the afternoon of June 5 in the starting of the Queensland
quartz crushing mill for the reduction of auriferous ores, thus practi-
cally illustrating the mode of extracting the gold from its matrix. The
Queensland Government, foreseeing the special advantages likely to
accrue to their Colony from a practical display of their vast auri-
ferous resources, decided some months since to erect a quartz-
crushing mill with all the necessary appliances for the treatment of
auriferous ores and saving the gold. The five-stamp mill was manufac-
tured by Messrs Walker" and Co., Limited, Maryborough, Queensland,
and is an excellent specimen of their gold-crushing mills, and has been
most efficiently erected by Mr J. Longden, engineer to the Queensland
Commissioners. The starting of the machinery took place in the pre-
sence of Mr Garrick, Q.C., C.M.G., Agent-General for Queensland, and Mr
Dicken, Secretary, and among the visitors were the Hon. Finch Hatton
and two well known gold-mining experts, Mr Thomas Cornish, M.E.,
and Mr Thomas Collingwood Kitto, M.E. The machinery worked
smoothly and effectively, and the sound of the stampers soon attracted
a large audience. To show the energy of the Queensland authorities,
a large supply of auriferous quartz has been sent from the principal
goldfields. The well-known Charters gold field, we are informed, are
sending as much as five hundred tons to keep the quartz mill supplied.
The operations of the more primitive style of tub and cradle washing
was watched with special interest. The alluvial earth is put into a wooden
tub (a cask cut in two) which is then filled with water and the
earth worked up with a shovel until the clayey matter becomes
dissolved and separated from the gravel. When a tub of dirt is thoroughly
washed the digger generally shows up the prospect of gold it contains,
by tipping his tub and running off the water throwing it gently back-
wards and forwards a few times, and a practised hand will soon show
whether the dirt is termed ?payable? or not. The dirt being washed
enough is taken out in small quantities and put in the cradle, which
the digger rocks with one hand and pours water on the gravel while
it is in motion. Under the hopper is a slide with a lip or ripple
inclining to the upper end of the cradle, which being placed on an incline
the gravel runs off leaving the gold in the slide or first ripple on the bottom,
nuggets, or coarse pieces, too large to go through the holes perforated in the
hopper plate, are picked out by hand; and while watching the operations
we saw a nice coarse fl ittened nugget, about J of an ounce in weight,
picked out from the stones. When the tub of dirt is all cradled off the
digger collects what remains on the slide and bottom of the cradle, and
pans off with a tin dish in a tub of water, and thus collects the gold.
Of course the Commissioners in Queensland have not sent poor
stuff to illustrate the operations of crushing and washing; but there
is so much quartz and gravel that is rich in the Colony that their task
has not been a difficult one. The difficulty and the expense have been to
get it to this country.
