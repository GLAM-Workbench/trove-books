FEDERATION.
Of that great Brotherhood I sing?
The dream of all the troubled years
The antidote for strife and tears,
Which none may hold an idle thing.
Some vision of that better time
Inspires a singer slow of speech ;
May mightier prophets rise to preach
? One Brotherhood for every clime ! ?
One high design, one common birth,
One God the Father of us all,
May be confessed, when great and small
Stand equal brothers on this earth.


Not equal in the secret plan
That marks the individual soul ;
But equal on the larger whole
That binds us to our fellow man.
Be this my theme till there arise
Some master-singer to his age,
Whose stirring words and glowing page
Shall claim the nations? ears and eyes,
And move the universal heart
Towards Freedom, Brotherhood, and Peace
For still our brothers wait release,
Still human brothers live apart.
In sullen hate and silent scorn
The common sons of earth pass by,
The noble lord with haughty eye,
The nobler labourer, British born.
The owner of the glove-clad hand,
Perched on some pile of current coin,
Still scorns with horny hands to join,
In manly grip round sea and land.


To grind the toiler in the dust
While stately mansions round you rise.
To steel the heart and blind the eyes
Will wound respect and weaken trust.
The moral sage hath somewhere said,
That ? Half the truth is but a lie,?
Which only Falsehood will deny,
To shield its ancient serpent head.
And half the right put for the whole
Is wholly wrong, it seems to me ;
Or license would be liberty
And half the race attain the goal.
To strike for Justice if it mean
The Justice that relates to one,
Gan only end where it begun,
Or leave a greater gulf between.
The Anarchistic son of hell,
Whose only heaven is to be freed
From law and duty, king and creed,
Would smash the Cosmos like a shell


.Nor like a Decius lead the way
Until the higher good be won ;
Alas, the Decian G-ens has gone
And Brutus walks the earth to-day !
The Regicide is in the land,
As Freedom?s guardians these appear ;
Ah, Liberty, thon well may?st fear
To grasp these monsters by the hand !
A bastard brood surrounds thy shrine
With iron hands and wooden head,
To every nobler impulse dead?
Not human these, much less divine.
Ah, human born but fallen low,
Long have ye striven with kith and kin,
And hated concord more than sin,
Say, brothers, shall it still be so?
Or high or low to curse one?s kind
Is surely treason to the State ;
No people ever thus grew great
In skill of hand, or power of mind.


Since man is man and earth is earth,
Let each regard the common good
And bnild the perfect Brotherhood
On Justice, Truth, and sterling Worth.
Let there be striving each for each,
Oue solid effort each for all,
Till barriers burst and factions fall.
Till hands around one Empire reach.
Vain lord that struttest round thy lands ?
? Ours ever since the Conqueror?s time,??
Whereon to tread is held a crime
For those whose only name is ??hands
Did ever vision cross thy mind
Of Brotherhood with every man ?
That this was Nature?s sacred plan
Who made us each to love his kind ?
That those who meekly call thee ? lord,?
And scarcely feel their soul their own,
Whose heads in service white have grown
Have right to speak one manly word?


That these have right to speak with thee
On every question of the day,
Of shorter labour, longer play
And, speaking freely, still be free ?
VIII.
0 merchant prince, a master worse?
Still human, if a millionaire ?
If thou keep back thy brother?s share,
Shalt thou escape a brother?s curse ?
If thou oppress the growing child,
The ill-clad girl of tender years,
?Twere sad beyond the depth of tears
Should this young soul become defiled
From very want ??twere sad for thee ;
A tear may fall on thine own floor,
And grief may enter thine own door?
Heaven keep thy child in purity !
0, brother man, ?tis only great
To be a helper of thy race ;
The orphans? thanks is more than place,
Or power, or honors of the State.


The time will never come, you say,
When all the earth shall live in peace,
When greed and tyranny shall cease,
The world will never see the day.
0 prophesy no more, my friend,
The immortality of Wrong ;
The weak shall yet become the strong
And Right shall triumph in the end.
The world is wiser than of old,
The world is better, I believe ;
?Tis something that at last we grieve
That man has been to man so cold ?
So cold while kingdoms rose and fell;
That men could sing while martyrs bled.
And burn the bones of heroes dead,
That Dante placed the Popes in hell.
?Tis something that men feel the wrong
And wildly ask, ? Must these things be
As they have been eternally,
And wars create our noblest song ? ?


Where is the minstrel who can sine:
O
A song diviner than as yet
Has been to any music set,
Inspired by some more noble thing
Than Ilion burnt or Alba built ?
? Peace hath her victories/? one said,
But captive was his genius led
To sing the song of human Guilt,
Of war above and sin below ;
And few have loved the song so well
He sang of Heaven as that of Hell;
O minstrels, shall it aye be so ?
Our Nestor sang one single note
Of Federation for the world,
But later something harsh he hurled
Which dukes and millionaires may quote
I will not quote it, though I love
The aged singer more and more ;
Heaven bless the bard who nobly wore
The whitest flower in Virtue?s grove.


0 singer, yet perchance, unborn,
Whose ear shall catch a nobler strain,
Come forth to sing the end of pain,
The world has been too long forlorn !
It waits for thee to sing of Peace,
Of Concord, Plenty, Purity,
The whole earth fair as Arcady
With all the hills and streams of Greece.
The nations yearn for such as thou
To voice this growing, wild desire
That stirs like pent, volcanic fire ;
The garland waits thy god-like brow.
They wait for thee, for men are dumb
Upon the eve of some great change ;
Come with thy voice of greater range,
O tarry not! the time has come !
They watch about the temple door,
They gaze into the rosy east,
Assured?the greatest and the least?
That golden ages lie before.


But still you say that ? Sin is sin,
And men are human, captious, cold.?
Dear friend, the kingdom came of old
And men were slow to enter in.
Stand not aloof in cold disdain,
Press in and others too will come ;
Speak words of hope, or else he dumb
?Tis wicked only to complain.
A world at peace fulfils the plan
Of Nature?s Lord, and thus it seems
Our wildest socialistic dreams
Spring from the common hope of man
What man desires and Heaven decrees,
Is destined sometime to appear ;
I prophesy its advent near,
And watch upon my bended knees.
The Good this hour we may possess,
The Better on the coming day ;
The Best may not he far away ;
Live for the best?seek nothing less !


In far Judaea once there spoke
The Prophet of the human race,
Yet those who looked upon His face
Were sometimes slow to hear His yoke
But now we think His words were true
His programme of the common Good ;
And when we dream of Brotherhood
The vision is not wholly new.
XIII.
Be patient, brothers, ? truth is great
And will prevail,? of old was said,
Though buried long it is not dead :
?Twill blossom though it blossom late.
Forbearance, brothers, only thus
The shining heights of Good are won,
Th better Era just begun
Is for our children, not for ns.
The Present built upon the Past
Is debtor to each by-gone age ;
The future saint, the future sage
Will labour, but it shall not last.


?Tis but a part of what shall be.
The painted flower becomes the fruit,
The branch is debtor to the root,
And all is one wide-spreading tree.
The tree of life is ever green,
Though sometimes growing almost wild
But now the times are not so mild,
The priming-knife is whetted keen.
Lift not thy hand against its rind,
Nor think that thou dost live alone !
The tree must grow as it hath grown,
And each is part of all mankind.
? The half is greater than the whole,
The fittest only should survive ;
Ont on the drones that fill the hive,
These cabbage-growths devoid of soul! ?
A dashing phrase, my learned friend,
Is often only half-way true ;
Your epigram is nowise new,
And whither do such doctrines tend ?


The present time, as every time,
Is only evil more or less,
And myriad hearts yearn to redress
The customs that encourage' crime.
Believe in this, believe it more?
That every heart holds something good.
And let it well be understood
That love can find the secret door.
Believe in this, believe it more?
That man is man where?er you go ;
Proclaim this gospel high and low
Of Brotherhood from shore to shore !
Believe in this, believe it more?
That nobler deeds will yet be done,
And greater victories yet be won
Than this old earth has seen before.
Believe in this, believe it more-
That God designed each human hand
To drive the pen or dress the land,
And daily leave some honest score.


The evil rests not with the times,
Nor chiefly with the laws of States,
Nor with the fools, nor with the Fates,
Nor even with Swinburnian rhymes,
But with the greed and pride of men,
The sins that mark both rich and poor,
The scrambling on the social floor
Like famished tigers in a den.
The evil lies at every door,
In greater or in less degree ;
Think not it wholly rests with me
Although I happen to be jtoor.
Curse not the singer of these rhymes?
I speak the truth in simple verse?
Curse not thy fortune, neither curse
The common customs of the times ;
But look within and strive to make
The kingdom of the heart more pure
Here lies the evil, here the cure?
Live ever for thy fellows? sake.


High Priests of Science on whose brow
The Rainbow of Discovery rests,
Your triumph round the world attests
That brighter days are breaking now.
Ye midnight shepherds of the sky,
Who walk across unnumbered years,
Your victory o?er the straying spheres
Proclaims the newer Order nigh.
And ye who search the wondrous earth
And see what man had never seen,
?Tis yours, like gods, to stand between
One Age?s death, another?s birth !
And mark the ebb and flow of life,
The framing of this ordered world ;
?Tis yours to trace the flEons, hurled
In Nature?s cataclysmic strife !
And ye who steer the ship of state
Amid the swirling tides of Wrong,
The long-mute millions round you throng,
Nor will they longer silent wait!


liise up iu all your manhood strength
To weld in one the Human Race:
The streaks of dawn shine in your face.
The time to act has come at length !
