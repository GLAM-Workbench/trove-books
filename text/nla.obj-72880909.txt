THE NAUTICAL FETE
i- u-~n
It is quite impossible for any fete to nave been
more elegant, and tasteful, th in the ball and supper
which look place on board her Majesty?s ships Ere*
tms and Terror, on Tuesday last. The entertainment
was given by the officers, in compliment to the
officials, civil and military, and inhabitants, for the
attentions shewn them during their stay here, so
mat every respectable person they were acquainted
with was invited. It is said there were upwards of
three hundred persons present, and that so many
sat down to supper. The two ships were moored
- ead and stern together, and were brought within
about thirty-five yards of the shore in the Govern-
ment Domain. An excellent carriage drive was
made to the spot. The ball ship was the Erebus?
he supper one the Terror , and the approach to the
omer was over a bridge of boats, which was co-
rei ed m with canvas and flags?ornamented with
shrubs, and formed a continuous avenue, lighted
"wi i numerous lamps. The serjeants of marines of
the vessels were stationed at the entrance. The
company were received at the end of the passage,
which was the mam deck of the ship by several naval
o cers, in full dress, and the female part of the vi-
sitors were conducted to apartments to arrange the
f wreaths of flowers,? which it is said are now
so fashionable. The Erebus was beautifully fitted 1
up for dancing, and reflected the greatest ingenuity
and taste on Lieutenant Bird, who we learn was
the most active officer on this occasion. The whole
length of the ship was ornamented with flags, the '
royal standard in the centre, At the bead was a
well fitted up refectory, where the Captains? stewards
unushed the necessary essentials of cold punch,
negus, and lemonade. The apartment was lighted |
y many brass chandeliers, containing sinumhra
lamps, and numerous smaller ones were extended
.it the sides ail round. The hatches were covered
wntii baize of various colours, and were used as
testing places ; they appeared to resemble the squabs
and ottomans in the drawing-room. There was
not the least vestige to shew that the visitors were
then? b � ard ' 6XCept the deck * llow ff erent
make known that the artiste retained on this occa-
sion wa* Mr Whalan, the mess-man of the 51st
regt. Mr Gardener the pastry-cook in Macquarie-
street was emploj-ed as the confectioner. The wines
consisting of hock, claret, champagne, and humble
port and sherry were literally in abundance, and of
the most recherche kind. The arrange uments altogether
of the Terror could not have been I Tetter.
The mode adopted in lighting; the supper room
was inimitable, for, independent of numerous chan-
deliers formed of swords and cu.V, lasses neatly fixed,
holding hundreds of wax lights, There were arranged
all round the sides numerous -small mirrors, each
containing two lights, which reflected double form-
ing the moat brilliant light t&at could possibly be
conceived.
The white ensign of St Geo rge
? The meteor flag o k? England,?
with the Union Jack, was in the middle of the sup-
per table, it was decorated with laurel. The cham-
paigne circulated most freely. Captain Ross pro-
posed the first bumper ?To tbh Health of the
Queen,? which was drank with the usual honors -
all the company continued standing while the na-
tional anthem was performed by the fall Band. The
next toast in succession by Captain Ross was ? His
Excellency the Lieutenant Governor,? to which Sir
John Franklin responded, by observing that the day-
set apart for the festive occasion by Captain Ross
was one that Englishmen might well be proud ? it
was the anniversary of one of the most splendid
naval victories that adorned the pages of our history
?it was a day rendered historical by the battle of
the Shannon and Chesapeake ?and it was also a day-
considered sacred to science by the discovery by the
gallant officer wio had proposed his healh, of the
North Magnetic Pole. Lieutenant Kay next
claimed the privilege of proposing the health of a
distinguished lady, who he was confident were she
present would be pleased and delighted; he would
add to the toast ? The Ladies of the Colony,? more
especially those ? bright eyes? that were assembled
on this occasion, ?Lady Franklin and the Ladies
of the Colony.? Sir John Franklin, in behalf of
Lady Franklin, returned thanks.
Major Mamvvaring, of the 51st regiment, after call-
ing the attention of the company to the many naval
victories that swelled our national calendar, and
bringing to the recollection the number of scientific
persons it had produced, asked for a bumper to the
toast of ? The British Navy.?
Captain Crozxer returned thanks, and concluded
a sailor-like reply, by giving the company assembled
his country welcome?
? Cead mile fealtheadh. ?
4 < ls fc h e glassy deck, without a stain.
Where on the watch the staid Lieutenant walks,
Look on that part which sacred still remains,
tor the lone chieftain, who majestic stalks.?
Around the main-mast was a raised canopy for
e quadrille band, and at the stern was constructed
a ligjit and elegant orchestra, in which the band of
the olst regiment played different airs, while many
couples moved on in the ? spirit-stirring waltz.?
At the termination of the head of the ship were
seen tlie Royal Crown, and the letters V. A.,
worked m flowers, at the opposite end was a por-
raitot the Queen, festooned with native and other
| ornamented bouquets. It was remarked that a 'lady
was present who bore an extraordinary resemblance
i *�, the P lct ure. Dispersed in different par* s were
"V �ba ot Eving shrubs, and in every direction
were ornamented flowers?a border of fern leaves
extending the whole length of the car,opy. The
ui esses of the ladies were most elegant, many were
o be seen in light blue costume, w*a presume in
compliment to the donors of the parhv. One of the
fair ladies was overheard playfully to express her
t esiro to go to sea with the ships as at present ar-
rangetl-?? not the least objection lassureyou,? said
the gallant son of Neptune. Another of the softer
sex was heard to whisper with a sigh some poetic
verses, which were probably from Moore?
-1 ve wish this little Isle had wings,
And we were wafted off to seas unknown,
H here not a pulse should beat but ours.
Far from the cruel and the cold.?
His Excellency said, he had been requested by
the worthy chairman to move to the ball apartment,
but he could not do so without calling on all present
to join in drinking ? Captains Ross and Crozier,
the officers of the Erebus and Terror, and with the
permission of Captain Ross, he would add, ? the
crews of the vessels. The speaker paid some high
compliments to the commander of the ships, and his
friends, Messrs.Bird and M'Murdo?the first Lieute-
tenants of the two vessels. He had observed how
every sailor on hoard had entered with emulation
into the preparations, which had reflected so much
credit on all.
Captain Ross replied, and spohe in high com-
mendation of the assistance he had always received
from his colleague, and the officers of the ships. He
dwelt in terms of warm approbation on the seamen
and said, that if the commander did not do his duty*
he would be urged on by his officers, and if they ne-
glected theirs, they would be even forced forward by
the crew.
The company then withdrew to the dancing apart-
ment, and the votaries of Terpsichore continued their
amusements, while some of the gentlemen were
urged to continue t heir attention to the God of Bac-
chus, and long after morning dawn were the amuse-
ments contiued. All the officers of both vessels
were present, with the exception of Lieutenant
Phillips, who very kindly took charge of the Obser-
vatory. It was without any exception the most
splendid gala ever given in this town, whether as
regarded the fittings up of the ship, the quality of
the supper, and last, though not least, the attention
and politeness of the entertainers. Truly it may bo
said?
A third asked for the ? eye of blue,? adding that
suie y she would be present in such a fair}- scene.
V\ uen six bells rang a move was made through to
tUe /error, and here surprise was depicted in the
countenances of numbers, which the music struck
up by the hand could not dispel
? The Roast Beef of Old England, O !?
Tables appeared in every direction, covered with
the choicest viands, and with equal gaod taste, red
appearing as the prevailing color of the flas:s that
adorned the place consecrated to gastronomy. The
supper was the best ever seen in the province?
there M as blended the French style of variety with
the English fashion of plenty?both as regards the
rarity of the different dishes the cookery, and the
pastry which was equally correct. As we fully
agree with the celebrated Dr Kitchener, who says, i
a Eve cook is worth ten times more than a
(lead general/ it is only doing an act of justice to f
? The lamps shone o?er fair women and brave men
A thousand hearts beat happily, and when
Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again .
And all went merry as a marriage bell.?
