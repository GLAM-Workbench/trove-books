UNSOPHISTICATED RHYMES,
EXACTLY TO SUIT THE TIMES,
DOCTOR DORIC.
DEDICATION.
It is to custom we must look,
For dedication?s in a book.
A book, respectable for sale,
Must haye a head, as well as tail ;
And patrons may have pigmy Trollops,
Messrs, and Mesdames Molly Jallups ;
And now, like greater minds I ween,
We, too, may dedicate and dream,
For dreams are often all our treasure ?
A glorious gift from the great Giver,
? Leading through nooks and sinnonsities
To literary curiosities.?
And now in ship-shape we have got ?em,
We dedicate to Kiginbotham ;
We give as widow gave her mite,
Honour to Geordie ?ever bright.
A gen?rous foe, a trusty friend,
Accept these lines we now have penned.
Thu power of the purse to the people dear,
Then why should we be the anomly here ?
Monopoly, too successful we fear,
In the southern hemisphere?
Sir Patrick, brought knighthood, down to
small beer.
Oh, granny dear?
Thou British granadier?come here,
And give one good cheer?
One loud huzzah I
To liberty and just take the liberty?
In Australian wilds drear,
And the ropes of straw, that we fear,
Will disappear, and Boss-Cokie-Law
No more to the front will rear
The savage spear at col. Shakspeare.
POETICAL. POLITICAL, PROVERBS,
AND PASQUINADES,
Translated from the ? King of Spades.?
Satire, as a tonic good,
Taken as it should,
A fine effect on blue blood.
Even verses, escaped from hearses,
AVould have the millionaire noble again ;
Not scheming and warring to the blood
For demoniac reign,
Begrudging brat and cat fat;
Gammon ingrained into the very grain.
Many men in early days wanted hanging,
To the country?s gain,
Who would now make the people submit
To their social shame.
Co-ordinating with mammon,
Tricked for land, dodged for the dub.
And all mighty Knights, now of the Wash-
ing Tub,
Climbed up to the apex by back stair and
blather.
Chivalrous knights we vow, rather
Greed and gain, to them no shame,
Upon the brazen brow gain;
They are the country?s death order,
Invoking the fate of the cities on the plain,
Bitumen and brimstone will be our rain,
When only the Lord-God-Almighty-Dollar
reign.
Mammon rampant, running rapidly to seed,
Many religions, yet only one creed?
Greed, greed, gain the stain.
A plain preacher without a swagger,
Like Christ would be slain,
And the chief rulers and high priests
Will say, ? Amen.?
But they are all there at the fasts and the
feasts,
Not like the publican plain ;
God be merciful to me, poor sinner.
Meantime graspers, mocking, vain,
And basking in rich trimmings,
Begrudging a morsel, far less a dinner.
Such knights, with honors bright,
Give me not the loan of a limmer.
Monopolising God?s fair earth,
And trampling on the sons of God, and the
second birth;
Yea, verily, the salt of the earth,
The son of God, had nowhere to lay His
weary head.
And our Sire Hob-Nob hath cursed the
globe,
And on the people would tread,
That a loving God had made,
And Sir Robinson Crusoe?s to be at the Go-
ment?s head.
Now shop in each orthy?Orthodox Church,
The people, by law, left in the lurch,
Editors, priests, pastors, and parsons, now
not much worth;


Not God, but self, we proclaim,
Mammon, and sin, and the devil reign,
Till poor Virtue is proved insane ;
Co-ordinated into hell for gain.
Arise, 0 God ! arise,
In righteousness, and sweep the grubs of
avarice oil like so many blow-flies.
Holy, holy Lord God Almighty,
Blessed be Thy name ;
For forty years robed wear
In law?s name,
But not robed of thy sacred robe,
We plead before Thy Fane.
What is knight, or what am I,
Beneath the magnificence of thy sky,
That we should shut our ears to the people?s
cry till they die 1
Mercy, becomes the high,
And is the prerogative of the Most High.
Nothing selfish in His rule,
Co-ordinate talk monopolises all our
wool.
And making a rank tool
Of poor John Bull?oh, fie,
To co-ordinate and veto the small fry.
From worse to bad we can?t admire
England?s prime desire,
For war, and backing up the prophet?s
flag,
And our defences mar by shallow sugar
bags,
Nothing too bad to be tarred.
Heaven, we loose our liberty ;
Come Russ ?the Christ be glad,
When fortune at the flood they drove us
mad.
We lived not in vain,
But many hearts we have made glad
By but one word in truth?s name;
Nailed the flag,
And freedom did proclaim.
But cant is now well understood ;
Britain at back, a Mahomedan war,
Sin, not as black as tar,
The Turkish bonds before the Caesar ;
Or even the bright and glorious morning
star ;
The devil?s ducats, or the big war.
Does culture know it ?
Do the banks in ranks go it 1
Do the parsons practice as they blow it ?
Not a bit. Only the poor poet
At his big wheelbarrow,
Bigger than the big wigs,
Or the rebel to the marrow ;
For justice and mercy not in the co-ordi-
nate deed,
But an avarice-stricken people, and our
country bleeds.
Riches run rampant,
The road robber on his steed?
The country?s call.
Be true in her hour oï¿½ need,
For if you fall,
You fall indeed;
This, the focus of hell, greed.
Let the evil days come,
The graves, alammy cold,
Then gone for ever, the glutton and the
gold,
And the ravisher of riches rampant and
bold.
Then the old story,
The good shepherd and his fold,
Ashamed of the hearts that are icy
cold.
With mammon at the Treasury, clutching
up the gold,
From youth till hoary and old ;
Yea, till the funeral bell tolled,
To the accusing Angel we are sold.
The antediluvians went to Noah to have a
a chart;
They would not build an ark,
But wanted his shirt ;
They called it a lark,
And he was thence to depart,
And leave them all the land and water,
Just like the Australian laud shark ;
Dead-lookers and ruin he would scatter,
Selfish as dirt,
The land they lost.
It got flooded with water ;
They got drowned to their cost,
And not much matter ;
Doomed by the Lord of Hosts
After all their big boasts,
Our postediluvians, learned a trick or
two;
Not after the British model,
But from a Sydney and Tasmanian Jew
A constitution coddle.
Being mostly old chums, they were up to
a trick,
To stick to the runs,
The State coach should stick,
And not todel or trodel.
Thus Australian Shylooks
Betrayed the Queen.
In the interests of poor people?s bullocks
She would not cross the stream
Amid the Botany hillocks.
And they hunted up a Big Jack ?
A great sticker for the Pope,
With the Liberator scream.
He a free Constitution making.
Why wonder we are without a home,


And all but God forsaken,
The people rule their own bread and
bacon.
The most insolent men we now do see
Came out here as poor as mice ;
Some from Tipperary and Dundee?
Experts at skinning the louse ;
And all honourable men, quite as a matter
of course,
Cast the pay away as a last resource,
To be recouped in an indirect way.
Over the many those m ammonites brood.
Once they were loafing in the wood,
Blunderbussing a blaokfellow
To save themselves a mouthful of food,
Who owned all the land whereon they
stood.
None such now to plead law potent and
good,
Sharp practice at every flaw.
The letter, not the spirit, they draw.
Are these the men to rule over us aw !
For forty years under their clutches we
have been.
No wonder now why we look lank and
lean.
Hey presto a pension we soreem,
But Sire Jonathan, old skirts,
Did not take a disinterested swim.
Not so green as they look,
And the McMullooh?s iron hand ;
But the natural overflow
Of the coup de flock,
Or coup de main
Of land sharks rushing the grass and land
To the colonial?s ruin and shame,
Damning by a stroke of woe,
That Law Trick should reign ;
But heaven will not always
Decree this British law 1
A dead-lock, and the iron heel you know;
?Tis Boss-Cokie-Law
Fit for an Indian squaw ;
Britain or Homan, now only a name,
For the almighty dollar lost to all shame,
When co-ordinated the people they
proclaim
Eoman count a great count, if big account
at bank;
Great as draper or hatter.
Like Javey, up the ridge he will mount,
Even if a bloated squatter, green as Dan,
Or the Dutchman on the potato and save-
loy machine.
But Bunkum didn?t put the pop before the
Queen ;
Only mesmerised Jack till we thought he
was going to keen.
?Another Dan 1? How the Emeraldersdid
stare when he let off this steam,
And found what was lost on the Australian
coast.
An exile green,
A jewel rich and rare?rabid ;
The speech of a mayor, sleek as a
bear,
Nevertheless he is all there
To humbug the people in honour of Clare ;
And the great man took the rub,
Nor mistook his gracious grub;
All hail big mug.
On this occasion the mayor was only
a sub,
And he fell down and worshipped a knight-
washing tub,
Like a cow at a fair.
Oh, sub, sub, Jack and pop-Popery,
To the poor begrudging the plough ;
Had ever small pitty an adorer of wealth,
To the failing health thou must feel
gritty,
And thy glazed eye, to be constrained,
To look to God for pity.
Thou well may yawn ; ere the dawn
There might be no more of Jack,
This is all going to be printed as an
allegoric fable;
The public to pick out the knowledge if
they are able.
Fancy and fiction may not be stable,
Yet as crutches help the unstable,
Like pigs to get into the co-ordinate poke.
To bear with us awhile, as a jock
The Muse must still beguile the mass,
Though our Hudibras may not please
The man with the bran new tile,
Who writes for grub, and grass by the
mile.
On the batter, like a squatter,
And a monopolist of the dubs,
Mews and news for editor?s grub,
He is death to the Muse.
With lubricating oil,
Profits, not truth they choose,
All to win, and nothing to lose.
Apologists for squatters? stews and Ricker?s
scabby cookoo;
But his tucker stable?our Ducker able
A motion made on the table,
Despite the Upper odds,
That he is both willing and able
To make them open the roads,
But dead-locks croak the big bully frogs.
Rich rollers of logs, but Ducker is Ducker,
Not the common bread and butter ;
By hook or by crook he will bring them all
to book ;


Unrighteous law, ever unstable,
The devil danced as long as he was able;
But old sable managed the flaws of the
road.
Talk co-ordinate and righteous law,
They have taken wings, and flown awa?,
And now we sing
Communion in the Upper Hall,
Has stolen the horse, looking the stable,
And monopolising the grass while they are
able.
Ookie-Lease-Law, righteousness runs only
on the Upper Circle ;
Law tricks we bless, and the members who
dine on turtle.
This is the flare that?s up,
Stirred up by Sir Sirloin and Sir Tup,
Parliament to corrupt,
Shortly to legislate for themselves.
Look up from the muck,
Ye men who dig and delve ;
There are some good Samaritans, not all
With pitchers at our wells.
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.
God bless our noble Queen,
That she may mend our laws ;
Avarice here, land sharks keen,
O, may she clip their claws;
Then we?ll be more serene
Under righteous laws.
Oh, may she keep us from the maws ;
To her we long have given applause,
From the full heart our loud hurrahs.
God save the Queen.
God save the horns green
Over almost all this land ;
Yea, a host of Wooleys have been
Bising the Iron Hand
In the name of the Queen,
Till the people are so lean
That they scarcely can stand.
Oh, may she keep us from the blues,
Who wade in mud to Peterloos,
Mandarin buttons to scabby cookoos ;
Bonds of blood for Shylook, Jews.
God save the Queen.
Hark how the knight-birds scream,
And the co-ordinates reply,
We have got of land the cream.
Let the people die, ?tis all serene,
Mesmerised on a saveloy machine.
God save the Queen.
And the horns green,
Jtuled as squatting mutton ;
By avarice keen,
The great land glutton,
And Jack-of-the-Stalk,
The cook of the walk
Ever since the days of Dutten.
Land curse there have been,
And left us not worth a button,
Down from the days of scabby mutton.
Serfs we have been,
Done like a dinner ;
The sons of the limer monopolised all the
grass green,
But God save the Queen.
THE DEAD-LOCK.
A Constitution, conceived in sin,
And wrote by sinister hands,
May well make the angels grin,
When swindled of all our lands,
The State a wreck,
By honourable wards,
To take eifect when forwards
Who shall have the upper hand of purse ;
Oriental oracles weild the magic wand,
Co-ordinate with freedom you understand,
From bad to worse.
Avarice proscribes to barn sands and ranges,
But God avenges,
He never changes;
He has in dead-lock
Not mercy in the Upper lot.
Purse-proud?all the virtue they have got,
Pure all?l am a fraud not;
Weighed in the balance, some found want-
ing ;
The public good mere canting ;
Nebuchadnezzar?s greed in grass
Has brought the people to a pretty pass;
A glorious Constitution, sacred and civil,
Which sends the public creditors to the
devil.
Oh, unblushing avarice,
You may lead a House,
Muzzle Britons, mum as a mouse ;
With our sheep and lands your brats now
brouse,
But soon to the silent land
Vetoed shall go some knightly house,
Dear at any price,
A colonial shice.
Councillors, with consummate skill,
Have got under a cloak ;
British liberty they would kill;
They have the people by the throat;
All honourable men kill, or burk a bill
If it don?t put money into their own till;
If not they can have a dead-look.
We don?t believe in anarchy, or mock


We are not the Big-House fool ;
Now look at monopoly, and say
Are they truly fit to rule,
Wantons in misrule,
Presuming on our mercy.
The big tyrants in our day
Were the graspers of land and wool,
Special rights ever their way ;
And the honest they did tool
By loafing lawyers and scribes fresh from
chicanery?s school;
Our rights and liberties they did ignore
Till we wonder why we are still in the land
to the fore ;
Never turned traitor like rebel to the core,
But meekly bore the Australian flag of free-
dom to the fore
Ground to the dust.
A poor greenhorn,
With co-ordinate lust,
Still tramping on his corn,
T?other said the Cape-o?-Storm,
A dead-lock to capitalists a capital joke,
Twenty-five million acres to be done at one
stroke,
Payment of members the cloak ;
The people, to the undertakers, their hope ;
With the corrupt members they might
fatten the flock,
Pay themselves, and what not,
God save the green.
Dead-locks were made for dummy thieves,
When in the den their senses were taking
leave ;
Laud sharks can?t God deceive,
And plead the legal to a fallen Eve,
Who had no vote.
Blessings are sometimes sent in deep dis-
guise,
And in the dead-look we may find a prize ;
So be we wisely act, nor shut our eyes
Unto the teacher, celestial wise.
God save the queens,
And the saveloy machines.
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I WAS a king outside of a ring,
And I very soon let them know so,
Par from the estate,
Up to Heaven?s gate,
Only poor Robinson Crusoe.
He never felt for his adopted land,
Only felt for an Iron Hand ;
To suit the age, nobles would oblige with
hobbles bland
To monopolise the land,
You understand.
By a magic wand,
How sage in a world we know ?
Oh, poor Robinson Crusoe.
At the pyrean spring I did gladly sing,
My heart with music overflowed so,
That the unclean thing
Tried to shoot me under the wing?
What think you of Robinson Crusoe 1
He never felt for the people of the land,
Only felt for the Iron Hand,
When hobbles were to do the block for us
bland,
And monopolise all the land by a sinister
hand,
How grand in a world of woe?
ph, poor Robinson Crusoe.
THE HONORABLE HUMPTY DUMPTY.
Humpty Dumpty had a great run,
Not in battle it was won,
Nor the cattle bought for an honest sum.
Said a dummy father to his Duffer son,
Brand ?em,
And don?t turn up your nose at a slum ;
Far out of the gutters your seed and breed
first sprung,
But for money you still out a mass of dung.
MY LOVE HE HAS A RED RED NOSE
My love he has a red red nose,
He is a little scribe,
But, as the world goes now,
The leader of the tribe.
He long hath been our land sharks? pride ;
No secret to disclose,
He sold himself to bullock hide
All for a feed of brose.
He long had worn a seedy coat,
And shabby was his tile ;
Righteousness to him was rot,
He wrote rubbish by the mile.
What to him was a nation?s woes,
The truth he could beguile.
Thus his toes, no more expose,
Togged out in first-class style.
And now he rules o?er Caxton?s fort,
Armed all cap-a-pie ;
Like a Norris or a Nount,
The niggers all shall die.
Good Lord, deliver us from shame,
Injustice ruled thus far.
Arise, 0 God, and reign.
And still the scar to sin,
0 bright and glorious morning star,


KLABK, O? SUNBURY.
Honok to whom honor is due,
And a meed of praise to the few,
Who, like Sir Wallaby?s knights, true,
Would enoble the bullocks? red blood into
the black or the blue.
In Sunbury Klark, not a bit of gammon,
Nor parsimonious to slave,
Two thousand pounds to the Indian famine
Liberally in one day gave,
While the other mamoths in mammon
Were plotting liberty, and land to
betray.
Such is the world?s way ;
In an ignoble House
Bullock drivers the people would enobjp,
Who would steal and skin a louse.
Like a lark into eostaoies we went
?Neath thejether of blue
Our heaven hero sent
Amid a mercenary crew ;
Not cent percent,, or Shylook Jew,
Constituted, like Constitution, for the
few;
Dons the Tamminy Ring could do.
But not rise in the sight of God like you,
THE FUTURE OP THE AUSTRALIAN
RAGE,
SCARTUS LARK.
Refulgent light, where all was dark,
Vox populi to be eaten up
To make more room for Tup
In the School of Art.
British freedom to depart
For more than lords the upstart,
Who landed on those shores, like the dove
from Noah?s ark,
But Fox done me out of my part.
Oh, Soartus, in literature thou soorn?st to
tell a lie ;
For facts and figures thou would?st even
dare to die,
Grave, solemn as psalmist, and obdurate
thy romance,
A ranger in upper sky thou dance ;
Tho? the devil be at thy elbow,
Thou never stoop to look askance ;
And when thou deign?st to strike the lyre
below
Thou oharm?st us so, we glow
In the heart or the liver,
That we must go ;
Sip the Tiber or the River Po;
All beautiful singers, Italians, you know,
Oh, Soratus, thou art no dunce,
From Sydney to Melbourne tbou rodest once
On a mule?s tail
Amid a furious storm
Of Scotch kale.
All hail, a friend and brother,
Life not fail, Christians love one another,
Till our jokes become stale.
Oh, Soartus, to be destroyed by the Legis-
lative land shark;
The people pure long felt the dart,
Sincerity a parody pot to Scart,
All dummying and dodging at Mammon?s
Mart.
Oh, Soartus, thou art a man of mark,
Greater than Brete Hart,
No mystery or tart.
Thy ancestors did embark
With Noah in the ark,
And, as they floated in the dark,
They got a start,
For the dogs began to bark ;
Thank?e says Noah to old Scartus,
The Australian dingo don?t bark ;
No fear, answered old Soartus,
All bite, no bark ;
I wish you saw them at a laud mart,
Not a bit for the poor as big as a tart.
Greed, monopoly, and dummy grass,
Another thermopoly, said one of this class;
He would slaughter the people
With the jaw-bone of an ass,
Hang them all up to the steeple in a mass,
Without saying mass.
Another crises, another flood,
The sous of hisses to be blue blood,
And the people left to chew the cud.
Oh, lub, dub, and mud.
PUNCH?S ROY AT,,
An attraction to the Loyal Knight A La
Paunch, in Caucus.
Laud Legerdemain Legalised in one Act.
Scene First:
An Upper Chamber dedicated to avarice in
fine fettle,
Mammon gloating where serfs war to settle.
They should squat on land not fit for their
cattle.
Programme :
Righteousness and Shoddy.
Overture on a tin kettle.
A duet by Milesian Dans.
Editor Goosey, goggling over the songs,
Heads you lose, tails I win,
By Skin and Bones.
Good laud not good for good people,
By a greedy grasper from Hong Kong,
Punching bullocks and muching law now
about Goelong.


Enter, Sir Falstaffi, attended by Jack Bag,
And Sir Sugar Bag, riding on Sanobo?s
nag, , . ,
And Sir Barnacles, of big brags ;
The confab fish-fag, and freedom to the
big Toddy-Tag,
The humble servant of Shoddy. _
Protestations now were handed in
By Sir Hawaii, Sir Lary, _
And Sir Satin, and Sir Sin
Against any more larriking,
Or kin larri with a grin.
All duly deposited in a box of tin,
After prayers the business did begin.
The chairman was Sir Sirloin Will;
He spoke of some confounded bill
That he intended soon to kill
By hook or crook,
And then he swallowed a gill
Lest he should take the fluke.
Thus primed he turned, addressing Brag ;
Sir Knight, your beef and mutton,
Inspectors say, are in a scab,
But you don?t care a button.
Long on the look, though caught by fluke,
Though checked by Sanners-Mutton,
Now richer than duke,
Though a patriot (hookj.
Hear it, 0 Squatter Dutton,
?Tis over the sovereigns we groan.
Where are all the rebel and the marrow
bone ?
The thousand sovereigns put to rights
All Ireland?s wrongs.
And Brummegum knights,
Taking it out of the Australian mites,
Good as the Saxon drones.
Mitchells wrote not for nigger rights,
Duffers not rebel songs,
Mighty speeches, eloquence flights,
At last came down on our mutton ;
No fear of. fast, you little Celtic
glutton,
For forty-eight?s do look spruce in the new
Windsor button ;
Peacocks in every yard strutting
Martyrs to the throne ;
The Pension must be a great relief
Unto the spinal bone,
For it might come to grief,
As a Liege-in-Chief to Rome ;
But the plumes and the feathers you now
disport,
Too innocent to disown.
In the upper regions there was great joy ;
They called him their curley-headed boy.
A statesman, heaven sent,
Without alloy,
No need to repent,
While the Treasury cloy.
Rich and rare, the gem he wear,
But, hush, that roar reminds of Wombwell?s
bear.
The Caucus all stood up to stare,
When the other great Don arose,
Huge a* a whale when in mid-ocean he
blows,
Spouting the vapoury periods from his
sonorous nose;
Blending piety and poetry as the mingled
waters rose,
But did disclose
That he had lost his tail,^
Merely when he was taking a dose,
When sitting upon a rail.
He said that though he was an artful old
chap,
He was caught in a trap ??twas ;
A tarish to knighthood sore ;
He was left not a stump,
At the Battle of Bogusmore.
But what grieved him worst of all,
Sir Barnacles never had such a fall,
Or the Caledonian Sugar Bag, in his tartan.
Had still the desired resort?the Porridge
Pots to Scarting,
Or the Duke of Argyle?s post to scratch on
Before the gagging days with half a sarkon.
But I, who would have ruled with His
Holiness the world all,
To have no help for my spilt milk?at all,
at all;
Even the faithful count, my oountship but
a Caterwall.
Oh, Caledonian, stern and wild,
Thou art an old arrant coon.
At a table he was busy marking,
His eye was fixed on an old half-crown,
His aoooustics busy hearkening ;
His usually mild eyes wild and sparkling,
He felt so riled that his speech was start-
ling.
Gentlemen, he said, we must conform to
the rules of the gagging order ;
We are not freebooters, like jocks across
the border,
But gaggers in league with squatters,
And squatting princes? power of wool,
Who dummy in hordes, sir.
We rule for sheep, not men, before the
Lord, sir,
And win estates by gagging people?s throats.
Working unrighteousness at auction, and
at Roups,
We became distinguished to dazzle the
masses,
Knights prate porridge, butter milk, and
molasses,


Are not all Balams riding colonial asses ;
We have enlisted the rank and file of the
Cossack, <
So rank our monopoly, for forty years we
have had every tussock ;
Almost nothing for our sheep and steers,
And when poverty-stricken people died, we
shed no tears.
We do not go co-ordinate with sweet grass,
Only co-ordinate to lead by the beak the
Now, Jacose gave one of his solid sonorous
growls.
And frightened out of a roost the most of
the stuffed fowls.
He denounced them all by his soul, not
made of Milesian patriotic mettle.
By his big bag he would not let Joe Kim
settle, or any other foreign cattle ;
He was ever ready to battle ;
He scorned sugar bags for scratching his
(sic) dignity;
He would not be appeased, he was in the
blues.
Sir Shamus was no match for him amid the
Kadoos.
In benignitly strike, saith Sir Shamus, but
forgive the scratching ;
As I live you?re a tartar worth catching;
But this is contagious, now you can?t refuse;
Let us rub noses like the good Mendose,
And be amiable, as the turtle doves,
Or the Simese Twins?
We two co-ordinate chums.
But Jackoododo jauntily the sword would
draw,
Thought he could give him Ookie-Learv-
Law,
After the manner of Joe Kim.
Preserve us all, Sugar Bag was afraid ;
Renegades are the worst rivals in the
poetical trade ;
Through freedom or blood to wealth they
would wade,
And he wished he could undo all that he
had formerly said
As a democratic leader of the Lower grade;
Yet the Iron Hand beat Jack the ï¿½Giant
Killer at gag,
Both blood spillers for the veto rag?
Tyrants to the tiller, and the man that
humps the pilgrim?s swag.
To speak the truth, fit rulers for the old lag.
Didn?t I make the squatters glad, saith
Sugar Bag;
The people shut up with the gag, no big
brag, but gag ;
Their backs about to be burdened like an
old nag,
When I begin to quake that 1 shall soon
have to hump my own swag, I gad,
In bouncing, or tete-a-tete,
There is only Jaokoo, a match for me.
I now shall shake his hand, and lay down
the gloves;
And they were about to bill like the two
doves
The dear turtle doves?but just as they
were about kissing,
Barnacles interposed that knighthood was
now a special blessing,
And that each colonial knight was on his
own hook a fishing.
He quoted the Dublin Nation.
The days of chivalry were gone,
Save and except the devilry in his own
rebel bone ;
Receiving a thousand a year for his old
rebel song ;
About Saxon swine, and his great wrong.
When here we were startled by a prolonged
groan,
And found it proceeded from the body
of a great dollop of a Don.
Another scream, and, stiff as a corbey,
This the end of a patriot greater than
Darby.
We shut his mouth, and closed his eyes,
And then we hunted out the big blow-tties.
In Dungaree we wrapped his precious body,
And then consigned him to a six foot boby,
Who wished that sooner he had gone to
pot?vain hope.
Large tears fell fast from all selectors? eyes,
Until the Murray stream began to rise.
All nature moaned ?a patriot politician
dies.
Peacock was dear as Burly Jack was wise,
Meek and mild we sied,
Tho' despot and dummy ever were his
pride,
And to His Holiness allied.
The poorer classes never were his side,
But rank monopoly was all serene,
And not one Norah dear would give a solo-
Keene.
She said we were not a bit too green,
Called for a mayor to find a ma-
chine,
To hearse him to the boiling down in
steam.
For every law he made a curse to us have
been??
And yet he got the blind side of the Queen
We took a nobler of colonial whiskey,
And thought a selfish soul was rather?risky
When old scratch would feal a little frisky?
But let him rest?our quest?dusky. J ?

THE INQUEST.
Cause of death loss of tail,
Took the dumps and turned pale ;
Conscience maketh cowards of us all.
Took the horrors?pats not at his call,
To create a panjundrun for pat.
Only the greenest of the green now caught
in his squatting trap.
No more the big the mighty man will hail,
The lesser joints of his once pliant tail;
Other liberators now in the field ?the old
oiligenious state to wield.
Ashes to ashes, dross to dross,
When a great man dies??tis every ones loss.
We give no loss by this big boss,
Doomed us to the monopoly and Moloch?s
dream;
Initiated and established Ireland?s curse
Man, woman and child sacrificed in Austra-
lian wild to greed sheep and steer,
That one or two be knights, oh Antinela
hear,
The Emigrants wanted by sinister hands,
Who denied the people one rood of good
land.
As the dirge is sung by an old bulley frog,
Let us all be gay, this his constitution is
gone to decay.
And knighted be nighted the devil wont
puy,
For this son of the sod?
We stuck up in effigy a dummy like a
squatter on a log.
God Save the Queen.
IN MEMOEY OF THIS NOB.
When Serge the good began to pray,
He hoped in the dark abode
The devil would not lead him astray ;
For on this globe he has been many a
long day.
Now all the Honourables sent forth the
shout of hip hip hurrah !
Free speech shouts an old Scotch fogy,
Invincible we are now as a body,
The pillars of the earth may shake
But we are impregnable and no mistake,
Our own bread we ever did bake.
We represented ourselves and a sprinkling
of shoddy,
And that is the truth so help me bobby?
Deeds black ?of many ?told,
Tricked the land and almost the gold.
God knows we are sinners old?
When the breath stopped?to the devil
sold,
All forfixety of tenure and a pound an-acre,
And our poor adopted country sold to the
undertake?,
The poor man not a bit for a garden.
We renting millions for a half-a-farthing,
We drove the people to the barren ranges;
And now the Eternal lives and avenges.
Justice and mercy never changes,
And we all go down one stream ;
But the curse of God does cry where avarice
hath been.
Seizing Australia in the name of the
Queen,
Our noble minded land-sharks culled all the
cream ;
The temporal or eternal good of the people
never once entered into their dreams.
As squatters selfish as pigs
To become freeholders they became prigs?
Bobbing the very roads?yet cry sacred
property to the gods.
Bobbing the land like any common felon
Where God intended millions of people to
dwell on.
But hark ! that shout the people are awake.
Our devils doubt?they made a grand mis-
take to rob the people who on God doth
wait,
And well they may when moral mountains
shake.
All is not gold that glitters in the state,
Sackcloth and ashes may avert the fate of
Sodom on the plain ;
Avarice awake?
God does reign,
And the measure you meted out to others
may be meted to yon again.
Amen.
Nobles, sic ! hang down your heads with
shame,
What if your souls you loose ;
Will the Big Estate be gain 1
Oh blind bard of Chaos,
Not blind as a bat, or greedy as a squatter,
Though all was dark and drear,
Thy soul was not sold to matter.
Like Eulers here,
Without God fear,
Euin and desolation they scatter ;
For forty years they have shut the ear?
And said no matter.
Give Dives a drop of water,
We are more merciful than we appear.
DE IKON HAND,
How it and de comeyde-man could not stand
At de Esquaba Exhibition,
God created de lands


Now held in tradition.
By de Iron Hand mines do drunk do under-
stands,
But not drunk as vone lord de vidler ;
And der constitution flourish wid de nobler.
De oomeyde-man dare Dives dribbling
preddy fair,
Tho? he could nod catch de blue devils in
Order order, law and order,
Theory and practice we cannot aford, sir.
Inversion de law at antipodes
When integral members more than half
sees,
And comeyde-man can do as him please ;
When he sees de cat jump him sneeze?
nothing like grease.
Order order, law and order,
Theory and practice we cannot aford, sir ;
Drunk, drunk, drunk as a lord, sir,
Red and blue noses we don?t record, sir.
De first constitution in Dummy Land,
Fundamentally sprang from de pig, de co-
ordinate pig,
To become a freeholder he become a prig ;
And he ruled de land like de common
felon,
Where God intended millions of people to
dwell on.
Not taxing demselves?but de poor man?s
bread and butter,
And apply de gag if only one word dey
utter ;
We rule de ass for de grass?don?t grow de
figs.
Nodting like de Iron Hand
To kig poor people in de gutter,
De glorious Cookie Boss Constitution,
Like de Phcenix renews its youth, or can
make de fat pig deal fatter dan butter ;
And de poor prig great deal flatter if he be
de luminary wid de wig,
Poor pigs and poor prigs small matter.
Dem like black fellows dog wid spare hair,
But the burly knight who took de lion?s and
de many people?s share,
We can bear softly.
And de sainted tho? tainted with the man-
ners of a bear,
And so avaricious, God?s earth now wid
himself should share.
Order order, law and order,
An de great slay here without de sord, sir,
A dummy brigadier across de border.
Lor sir??
How the oomeyde-man doesstare and glare;
Order order, law and order.
When de colonial swipes are on de board,
Den de House in full accord, sir,
A de justice what avarice will afford ;
Souls take thine ease thy barns are well
stored.
By de quart or by de gill,
British freedom he would kill,
Potent vat, den potent still;
Look how red him in de gil,
How much comeyde-man eke may swill,
Oh hear us, de House knows he is ill,
And yet would trust such as him wid dis
bill;
Melicans have stars and stripes?
But colonials go in de swipes,
Hick-up and stagger.
De comeyde-man plays more larger,
And arrogance out a great swagger
All around de gagger.
They worked no jobs,
No not so much as one bragger
To rob the public roads.
Oh robbery, contemptible in the low estate,
But robbery becomes grand when great ;
And sleek parsons will prate?a mistake
Dat Providence guards de mercenaries at
Dives gate.
Order, order, law and order,
Rights and liberties now but a word, sir,
For gold and de land people go to hell?s
brink,
Mine wonder what Queen of England think.
Eights and liberties all in de trust
Of de comeyde-man and de malt and de
must,
Him like good lager tills belly like to bust ;
And avarice rampard in unholy lust,
Exalting mammon to the highest position,
Ignoring the precepts of the Great Physi-
cian.
Oh ye worshippers of mammon,
Who think it no crime to gammon God ;
And jumped up snob,
Unholy the ground you stand on,
You miserable four bob.
A special pleader going the whole hog,
Spitting out venom like a toad,
Him I will exalt who is a counted base.
But de comeyde-man wid malt was in de
And a pettifogging lawyer?minus the robe,
In a base dared to call the live majority de
mob?
De little two legged legal snob.
Tom titmouse would be a great god,
When starting in life small load ;
But in own estimation great globe.
Doing very dingy and very dirty jobs,
Thousands of pounds for pettifoggs to
squeeze.


Labour cheap, dear sheep, and nothing
for the people to eat;
Stocked with law and lots of cheek.
Order order, law and order,
Theory and practice we can?t aford, sir,
De people are now de land sharks lodger,
And Berry but a plodding sodger?
Waring with a motley crew,
Disgustingly rich like our Irish Jew.
The people soarse know where do choose
Moral scab among de cuckooes,
Ireland?s tyrants God forsaken,
Australian scrubbers now are aping,
For Burley-Burley left the draping,
And went a constitution making ;
The basis mammon, money-scraping,
A moral earth-quake now is gaping.
It led the van from bondage,
But will inherit not the land ;
To realise the fact of his great sin,
By last account we hear he is in to repre-
sent tin ;
And the new standing orders are flying at
de mast,
And the dead are to bury the dead of the
past,
And high handed avarice is invited to hold
fast,
Iniquity in their unhallowed grasp,
Throttle freedom till she is a aghast.
Perjurers usurping the lands as in the past,
And God?s creatures are asking how long is
this to last.
Order order, law and order,
Theory and practice we can?t aford, sir,
Would put you on de bed, sir.
Dat oomeyde-men are standing on der heads
sir,
When dey can?t stand on der own leg, sir ;
Sergeant-at-arms take him away
Without demur ?more lager, hip hip hurrah
By de red reamen Iron-will rules to-day.
Boss-cookies and dummies, perjurers now
throw off de mask?
But oh mine got, how long is greed to
grasp,
Order order, law and order.
Bobbed of land and law by St. George,
Swindled and sold at the lawyer?s forge,
Keturn to the charge, and make disgorge ;
Hicup and stagger more lager, and more
swagger,
More Iron Hand,
And old Sugar-bag the gagger buys more
land ;
This is coming it grand.
Apostrophising de first dead-look,
Long tongue Darling, Sugar and Sand,
Pension to every homey hand ;
Never turned coat when turned grand.
But de comeyde-man?s eyes glares
In de cries of chair, chair ;
He was spioious of de blue devils every-
where.
Oh oomeyde-man sacred and sage,
Velly good garitor in de Age ;
In de gutter one mighty roll,
No savey de cage or de cole hole.
Beating Blondin without de balancing pole,
Unparallel?d agility climbing to the top
of the electors? roll;
Hide your diminished head old King Cole,
Order order, law and order,
More slaughter than de sword, sir.
Dives call on de people to pay,
No discussion, but yea ;
Down went de mud wall,
Holland dikes and all.
But man?s mission was to pay taxes,
And to crawl to de owners of properties ;
What a fall, eating wormwood and gall,
From renagades road robbers all ;
And de five hundred gaggers, becoming
sleek,
Dncorrupting pure lambs, the owners of
sheep.
But deep was calling unto deep,
The storm was brewing which will sweep
Avarice from off the highest seat ;
For God slumbers not, nor does He
sleep,
Hence the people are awake.
The land was made for many men?s sake,
And righteousness in power will rectify
mistake ;
No more Cock-Bosses law
To swallow the laud, aw?hurrah ;
Except a few allotments to stop our maw.
Gigantic swindles long in every breeze,
And oomeyde-man down on his knees,
Doing the dot to the I?s and the Tee?s.
That Iron-wills might do as they please?
In wilds in the southern seas?
Where the strongest arm the right to
seize.
Our share, only an allegory, but rather
torey ;
Facts and fictions making up the story,
Yet giving God all the glory,
As Moses did in the ancient story.
Viewing the promised land, head hory,
Leading bondsmen to the land of the
free ;
So young Australians we have lived for
thee;
Be ye brave as Britons, your glory I now


Believe in God, He is not shop to me or Though the cannons thundering roar
thee, I hope. Britons shall be free.
Like our presidents over a gunny-stump,
worshipping the Dolar or the Hump,
With sacks and satchels and windy whistles;
Exalting at expense of our dear land
of thistles;
Rats leave the ship when the ships of state
go down.
A bloodless revolution is the most profound,
And good deeds done accounted naught by
sir clown.
To Providence, now look down,
Mercy and truth are met to gather ;
Political loafing now gone forever,
To deserts, far over the Murray river;
We are all children of the Great
Giver,
Let avarice frown, brand him with a white
liver,
For him was made hell?surely not for
ever.
HIVES AUSTRALIAN,
We won t tax ourselves saith one great prig,
We will tax the men who dig ;
The moral law of mercy not worth a fig.
The land sharks man would swallow aw
And swallow Tigg.
Political economy saith Cockie-Boss,
Takes all the profit and none of the loss ;
The richest land in Australia was got on
cross,
Not Calvaries cross saith Cockie-Boss.
Disgustingly rich we are and will endow
joss.
I have plenty of money saith a dicing
squatter?the old boss,
Who monopolised from God?s creatures all
the land and water ;
And others have plenty of Dummies.
What of the soul?s loss ?
The root of this evil is greed of money,
In cant and content called dross.
BRITONS FREE.
Britons on the southern shore
Strike for freedom as of yore ;
Your fathers ever win the score
Amid the nations free.
Are we free ?
Britons avarice on this shore
Wild as wolf or savage boar ;
Reveling in the peoples gore
And tell them they are free.
We free ?
By the God whom we adore,
By the dead we do deplore ;
Truly free ?
Britons greater Britons be
King the tocsin over the sea ;
This the year of jubilee
To Britons brave and free.
A grave or free ?
Britons be you true and good
Who dwell beyond the sea ;
Britons shed their best blood
That Britons should be free.
Swindlers were the Queen?s trustees,
So long the game agoing ;
For forty years they swindled free,
Hurrah for Charley Bowen.
We him exalt, a British salt,
A genuine Sir agoing ;
Not colonial beer or malt,
But a brave British Governor.
Not the ruler of a class, or.
His god a bank account;
Or swindling the peoples grass,
And then the high horse co-ordinate
mount.
Knights whose chivalry clash,
Are not from honours fount;
But Brummejen smack like Romey?s Count,
Would ride him over the mass,
To monopolise the grass.
And they found governor restive rather ;
Rogues as rulers he could not endure,
Selfishly robbing the Queens poor ;
To them he was good father.
In state above the stile of our floor,
He would rule as a ruler in right ;
A parliament, a real parliament awakes the
birds of night,
He looking up to the Eternal,
Not afraid of the infernal.
Not law tricked his coat,
Like the co-ordinate knight we got ;
Living or dead from God no fleeing,
Blood was shed by the All-seeing,
For the poorest subject, not object,
The Governor rules in God?s stead,
Not like a bailiff bum
In the state slum, far above our No. 1,
Where God gives, should mercy refuse,
Our rulers were but old clothes Jews.
And we muse over the long listless night,
Our earth is earthy as a cabbage
knight?s,
Under God's shadow not fight
For the Queen?s poor subjects,
Like the man who humps his swag ;
Precious knights who does the big, big
brags,


Knights colonial riding the colonial nag.
At last all dead,
Where now to fall and rest the weary
head.
Only to the One, the real Owner of the run,
Who died and bled, not for some ;
And showed us how to live,
To love and to look up, drank the cup,
And asked Him to forgive,
For only thus true happiness
O man, live ;
Avarice saith never, while I can get the
lajt stiver.
But loving not fearing, the Almighty
Saith aback, fallen man, to the Maker we cry
Not riches, but hope rather, more fully
can we die,
Dead-locks the dead fly.
NOAH IN THE ARK.
When the anger of the Lord overwhelmed
a world in sin
Noah?s soul was calm, for he had the peace
of God within,
Dwelling apart from the unclean thing.
Peering into the abyss of boiling ocean,
dark and dim,
He saith this is the legitimate result of sin;
But the mastiff by his side was trembling
with fear,
Dreading the dead bodies floating to him
Outside the ark the elemental storm,
Terrific, and dark as night before the morn,
When the Arch-Angel will blow the re-
surrection horn,
Summoning to life the lost earth born.
Down into the depths poured the unearthly
flood,
To drown and wash from souls the stains of
black iniquity.
It was fearful to see that boiling sea,
To all time a lesson it will be to those in
dummy perjury.
KING KASEY.
King Kasy, and may it please you
To take a bit of fun ;
Our contemplation?s not to tease you
If you are your mother?s dutiful son.
Thy laurels do not dose me,
Bravely in battle won ;
Greater bedad than Corporal Fasey,
Who beat the British drum.
All honour to thee, Kasey,
Thy chivalry was right,
To selectors rather hazy,
To the dummy a knight; with them thou
never got tight.
Thou did decry a land shark bite,
Rabid as penal, and sent to Pen fridge over
night.
King Kasey, sublunary things
Give much trouble to more than kings.
But men-monsters, mammonities, who did
monopolise in rings,
Pay pecant paper scribes to sing;
God?s gift to man, just what it brings
In hard cash, no account of sins.
King Kasey, there are tips and tribes for
every treason,
And arrogance that won?t listen to reason,
Selfishness in season and out of season ;
And lawyers glide to council, outs or ins,
To give the devil, or to clip his wings.
King Kasey, a squirrel hooked with a por-
tentious sum ;
Un-booked he booked it,
And left you to whistle on your thumb ;
The squirrel out, and Kasey goes in,
Kasey and crazy looking for tin.
King Kasey, people said ?twas a goodly
haul,
Yet, 0 King Kasey, there was the writing
on the wall;
Nemesis, lo ! was on the run.
It was no go, and the barrister had to sub-
cumb;
Manacled, like a felon, to our very door.
When the righteous man ought to shine
more and more.
King Kasey not initiated in the new and
legitimate way to find cash ;
He should have studied law of white-
wash ;
Drive his coach and six through the Act,
Snap his fingers, and pay not a rap ;
And in that line of business become Quite a
Nap,
Or an Honourable Diel Black, or White,
Or bloated squatter to monopolise all the
map, not a bit for Mack.
King Kasey, the moral code only for fools
a blight,
Pound out knowledge since we banished
God out of the schools,
And to the big estates to be made the tools;
Some day new crop of heathen bulls
Will make havoc among the toadstools.
Literary lumpkins on morocco may loll;
As parsimonious rich parents say to
Bachelor Jack, ?tis all tol lol;
A liberal education at the expense of Jack?s
small roll ;
Logic for ever to shove him in the hole.
King Kasey you have shed tears,


And you love the pretty, pretty dears.
Yea, a lady fair?you even loved henhouse,
And you loved her cat when bounding
after a mouse ;
You are now a crowing king full grouse.
Yet selectors pliant, with cap in hand,
Trembling beneath thy magic wand,
Would grudge the rood whereon thy dwell-
ings stand,
Nor deign to own they knew thy loving
hand.
This was King Kasy?
A new version of Eeade-a-ma-asey.
King Kasey, take it easy,
Or the Bungaree savages will drive you
crazy.
?Tis Kasey go out, Kasey come in,
Kasey you?re fat, Kasey you?re thin,
Storms without, confusion within,
And the land sharks would swallow you
body and skin;
And this is the life of Kasey a king.
King Kasey, the burden of my song,
Is long life Ire wid ye, and iudgery long,
Till thy appointed time, and when gone,
Our annals filled with thy sweet story,
And I, thy poet sage and hoary,
singing thy praises, O glory ! glory !
At an obelisk, a full ten story,
Eecording, 0 king, you were never a
Tory.
King Kasey, this is tall talk in an humble
way ;
Each would be the centre of gravity
Even if baleful as Black Thursday.
But, King Kasey, you know what makes a
king,
?Tis the sweet little cherub that beats the
heart-felt string,
When conscience calm would look on death
and sing,
0, Death, where is thy sting ?
To meet thy God full ready to take wing,
With holy spirits messenger unto the King.
King Kasey, an unfeeling heart, though it
sat upon a throne,
Not worth a blackfellow?s dart,
And it I would disown,
Even if Dan was supreme and wagging a
False jaw,
In early days the white the black would
scan,
Monopolists of all the grass, the wool, the
meat, the corn ;
But justice stern was wrung
By the people en masse, and the stump
orator?s tongue.
But, Kasey, thou did?st not minister unto
the big estate,
Therefore 'tis not meet that thou should?st
cremate,
But have Christian burial, and wait,
Though time is money, according to St.
Gumy.
To economise thy ashes, they would scatter
To re-create the rooks and other matter ;
They grudge, 0 King, thy little liquor
Th at nature?s laws might procreate much
quicker.
Thus, King Kasey, life?s battle is done ;
Thy plumed trophies in our halls all hung.
Memento mori,
Kasey, fife and drum, ?
Australia Felix,
And roads all round the run ;
No mere false pretences,
But fences, square miles,
From the rising to the setting of the sun ;
And homes for humble toil amid the woolley
Who kicked great poet Wild Lands
Off vast runs;
All the way from Highlands, done by dums.
With Kasey king, King of the Cannibal
Islands.
Benevolent was the land laws of Botany Bay
And sweet Tasmania,
Human happiness the sum,
When righteousness was mum and I undone.
A CO-OKDINATE BULLEY.
He bulleyed at Brighton?
Hurray, hurray !
Stuffed the meeting,
They say, they say,
Where the Buffalo Bull was coercing for
wool,
Britons not Britons?
Hurray, hurray !
In the interest of order and law, do you see,
A purse-proud bully would murder me, and
Britons free,
When my friend said not just yet, cockie,
I would even kill the fellow,
The Bull did bellow,
The brute would slay,
Co-ordinate hands in the public till;
They seized the land the people should till,
And the State cows? milk in the gutter spill;
They stuffed the meeting?
Hurray, hurray I
And bullied the British
Away, away;
And staffers from Flinders Lane, a whole
What a shame ?
Hurray, hurray I


Britons not Britons,
They say, they say ;
Sheep to feed in the street ?
Hurray, hurray !
Till God says. Avarice, not all thy way ;
Justice and mercy,
Not for people in past day?
Hurray, hurray !
FATHER BLAZES OB NEW WINE IN
OLD BOTTLES.
Blazes, ancient of Cimerian days,
Hasey and blasey ever always ;
Tradition still points to Father Mike
As president of the bituminous bike,
Who telegraphs to save Blazes with a grin ;
Havelock, all damned and bolted in,
As Bismark and Briton are in a Papal
storm,
Fast?ning the Vatican Bull by the horns ;
And the old Catholics are all so glad
That the infallible Papacy gone cracked
in the head.
Superstition is rank, we all know,
Reverences love beefsteak like the crows;
And would strangle freedom as a butcher
would the ewes ;
They are dreadful foes,
They feed on man?s despair and woe.
Men will suffer, and must suffer long,
When spectres stand between their God
and song ;
As between the land and man stood their
sanctified Sir Dan,
We have suffered by a Roman Count too
long.
The Catholic conscience, in the senet of
black strap,
Devoutly dooming us into a priestly trap,
Where mock humility much venom cover
For scarlet avarice to pray upon a brother.
Love to God, and love to man, a little child
can understand,
Where there is no premeditated sham.
Poor Biases, you have had your day,
Working hard after a Popish way,
To teach the children their A B Cay ;
And that Saxon brats, and Kilkenny cats
Should tear each other, and slay,
But thy triple crown came tumbling down,
And bigotry was hooked away ;
The little brats with their cricket and
bats,
Now may learn to love at play,
And the real Catholics, in their hearts, are
shouting hurray,
Whatever the Roman priest may say.
An ancient Church, made up of doctrines
In conclave sat, and thus decreed for you :
We, the only true and holy Church, now
meet,
As tailors three who lived in Tooley street.
It has taken us centuries nineteen the
Rubicon to cross,
And now infallibly we have founded Joss ;
Grand Lamina, Juggernaught, or Pope,
The Idols christened, and it matters not.
As superstition rampant stalks the globe,
The Ultramontane goeth the whole hog;
The Jesuits vary ever, as the phase is,
With blessed fetishes the verdant ever
pleases.
But, hark ! the cock how free he crows,
A regular Britisher, we know,
Thinks ? Liberty with life was given,
And life itself the inferior gift of heaven.?
He stands erect as free born man ;
Ere slavery in the world begin 1
And he is not afraid to speak,
Lest he should lose the bit to eat.
With diffidence that name is limned dear
As sable prizes the greater Blazes here ;
Skilled in all lore and plots as vasty deep,
So love we Blazes that we now must
We trust you?ll attentively give ear
Unto the voice of Briton?s chanticleer?
An ancient Catholic, not like Roman
serviles here,
Ever in Briton?s land freedom held dear,
Flesh of our flesh, bone of our bone.
Despotic now the creed of Rome,
British barons ever were bold?
Freedom to Britons, more precious than
gold ;
Absolute to Rome they never sold,
Protestant pluck was in the barons of old ;
The new Catholics not the fold ;
The barons bold that bailed up King John
are the Catholics that I sprung from.
Dear sir, I know, you are ever willing
To plead for those whom avarice is
killing;
A patron noble, bright be thy sun
In places higher than can?st behold a
And when thy little span of life is o?er,
In deep sincerity thy loss I would deplore ;
A priest thou be in the wrong coat,
let germs of religion true you?ve got,
For when thou hymn thy prayers up to God
No labourer will respond thou out him
down a bob or shilling ;
There are more modes of killing a dog
besides his blood a spilling.
A freeman?s blood is coursing in thy veins,


Home's manacle?s methinks thy soul dis-
dains ; ,
Enslaved thy mind, enslaved thy all,
Is he a man who asks a priest to crawl ?
A slave to whom, to God or to one who may
be fool or rogue.
An earth clod, as god on earth to
reign;
Shame that man shall blaspheme.
Wonderful Almighty, infallible is He
Who made the spangled heavens, and all
things that we see ;
Popes and prelates to dust they will return,
And we, too, Blazes will be food for worms;
Not all thy sophistry or splendid masses
Can gull mankind to stupid asses ;
Kadoo, canonicals in crazes,
Not half so good as you, dear Father Blazes.
DOLLAR WORSHIP.
Our noblest man, profoundest scholar,
Is but a mouse without the dollar ;
And men, like the Hebrews of old,
Will worship a calf if it is made of gold.
But when fortune?s wheel will take a turn
Those Pedlingtons their god will spurn.
Huxley, that sage once probed for souls,
His ?verdiot is they were tadpols
Hatched in the limbo of old Mammon,
Until the devil could not stand ?em.
Proud as Lucifer, and full of gammon,
Those cast ashore with Cook?s pigs,
They ran wild, and turned prigs,
Ragged and wretched as their own rigs.
Robed now in state up in a house,
Like dummy cocks they crow full grouse;
Larger than Lords, they stuck to pay,
Like him who didn?t fight, but ran away,
away
Unto our fungus aristocracy,
Who plotted deep in early days,
And kept the people at bay, to rot if
may,
Their simple negative away all my run.
John Bull could not brag, my gun,
Land, gold, liberty, all torn away,
And thee left out in the cold during all this
foul play,
Witnessing the artful become an aris-
tocracy,
Principally by chicanery, and legal flum-
mery, and law, leary law,
All jaw and swallow all, perjury, nock-out,
dummy, and all manner of flaw ;
(sic) Law entrenched in law transmogrifi-
Purton, typ. Melb,
Dollar almighty their deification.
This be pattern, British noble,
Colonial bullocks out of hobble,
And wise men will sometimes think
That jumped-up pride is on the brink
Of some foul pestilential stink;
What great prerogative will arise,
Nobles without self-sacrifice,
Whose emblem in heraldic stamp, grub
colonial in. a ramp,
With crowns Upon the noble head made up
of gilded gingerbread.
Cash makes the man, the want of it the
fellow, %
The virtues all but leather and prunella.
These be the gods to whom we fall, and on
our marrow bones must crawl.
THE LAST ROSE OP SUMMER.
The roses of summer will bloom and fade,
And virtue die if we degrade
By marrying for money.
This is the commercial shade,
The meanest of the mean to trade.
What are the joys of a beautiful maid
To fat, and fortunate widows ?
Political economy here too array,
Men marrying marshes and meadows.
Last year a nice young man
Married a widow with plum and jam,
And took her to the altar.
She could in speech falter?
The last rose of summer left blooming alone.
Not a sound tooth was in her head
That she could call her own.
She sied, I could have died,
But I left that alone.
?Tis God that disposes
The pinks and the poses
From the cottage to the throne.
He and the widow did not long rub noses ;
She don?t know now where ho is gone.
Such a life she him led,
He skeddadled and fled,
And left his dreary home,
Never, no never a word he said,
Not even good-bye, John.
0, Sammy, my dear, the philosophy here
Is plenty of sugar and jam.
We crucify a Saviour, dear,
Apostles we burn and hang,
And, another word in thy ear,
We have less real than sham ;
True as gospel, Sam, my dear?salam.
