FITTE I.
DRAMATIS-PERSONAE.
AUS -TRA - LIE 7 Handsome young ladies
EU-RO-PEB ) in Drawing-room attire.
VANGELINE ; Handsome Australian maid — fair
complexion.
NARM - BEE - RA ; Aboriginal — a handsome young
Goo - re - arl.
EUMALGA : A koo-a-koo-ka — her name means
forehead; hence intelligence. Native.
BURAM - BIN: A name applied to the early British
settlers — some are adults, some are
children.
ABORIGINES : Some little, and some grown Natives.
J ERE AM : Native name for star Sirius, also applied to
the Bird of Paradise. Appearing in this
performance as enchanting Sirens. Heads
and faces like beautiful girls with feath-
ered bodies — no arms, but folded wings,
tiny short legs, small bare feet.
BUN YIP: An amphibious animal — an extinct specie
of the great White Seal. It had a sweet
voice. Its cry was like that of the articu-
late human voice.


At the assemblies of the Aborigines their ancient
Legends came much into evidence. No Proroomawas
celebrated with more enthusiasm than the festive dance
of N’Yarrin (the Native term for the Pleiades). When
that group first appeared in the early morning sky they
danced with joy: for they knew spring time was nigh.
Then they commenced to hunt the pheasants for their
tails were then in full plume. In their Dramas the Blacks
impersonated people, animals, birds, and the sun, moon
and stars things animate and inanimate alike, and
gave a sense of life to all mentioned.
PROROOM A - PARLBMA.
PROLOGUE: The Soul of Literature is an imag-
inative IDEA. To convey an Idea on, various means
may be employed. To do it the sculptor uses his chisel;
the artist his brush; the musician his instrument but
in Literature we employ grammar and composition.
At the age of eighteen I became imbued with the
thought that I would like to compose a Drama. But
years went by before I could discover an Idea; and
when I gained one a quarter of a century passed .away
before I thought of an appropriate way to express it.
When at length the Idea did come to me I found it
could be enclosed entirely in one word: Origin.
Then it gradually came to me that* such an Idea
could only be clothed with Originality. With this
thought before me I proceeded little by little; and what
follows is the full issue of my attempt.

THE DEWMAH.


SCENE I: The Stage-view from auditorium.
Centre tiny table, two chairs —covered in floral. To
right artificial shelter affords safety to Jeream in
shrubbery. To left imitation-rock parapet 18 ins.
high —so back forms 45 degrees. At the right angle
waterfall into supposed pond behind parapet that ob-
scures Bunyip. The back wall is a landscape in moon-
light with a blue sky, and moving white clouds with
the Pleiades just peeping up from the horizon.
Silent Show : (continues from 4to 9 minutes) Jeream
merge from shelter, and Penguin-like strut across the
stage peer over the parapet to enchant the Bunyip,
but they are shy, and take much coaxing. Then the
Bunyip rise up cautiously, their faces full on to the
audience; but Jeream are in profile all the while. The
scene now is so impressive as will almost survive the
death of the beholder.
Enters AUSTRALIE : —Bunyip surprised, flop over
the parapet, the spray from water rises to visible heights.
The Jeream flutter to shrubbery —is seated as if
dejected.
Enters Eu - ro - pee.
Enropee : Hail! Beloved I greet thy tenderness.
Australie: Thy tenderness to me so dear is thine.
Buropee : Whence thy coming and where is thy wurley.
Australie: In nature still with no embellishment
My wurley is as thou canst well observe
In the wattling of my own solitude.
Buropee: Too beautiful art thou for solitude,
Enjoy thyself: and let the hour be thine,
And nature’s favours are all now with thee.
Hush to a calm is thy auditorium—
Reserved alone for the illustrious.
Select to the brave, and just heroic,
And where only the most desirable
Can meet within appreciable court.
THE DEW MAH


Australie : Nomenclature, and Native literature
Such as we have is all but solitude
—The song of birds, and the voice of Bunyip.
I have them here gathered all around me.
Buropee: Thine is the desirable privilege—
Well exceeding the most rapturous choice,
Receive the cup charged with thine own glory.
Be thou consoled and let thy soul be thrilled.
Know that the too modest retirement
Which hitherto seems peculiar to thee
Does not always meet the best occasion.
Give thy spirit opportunity now,
That thy soul may reach immortality.
The spectators gaze towards thy circle,
The rivulets still contain the Bunyip.
In thy forests flourish the sweet Jeream,
The voice that’s past is the prophetic note
Of Time unborn disclosing things to come.
Tell the Bunyip to me in gladsome tale
How it sported in frolic with the whale.
Australie: Tradition says in Lake Eyre there sported
—Till that great well did in its time dry up—
With the monster the noble Diprotodon,
The dear Bunyip of the great olden time,
Of the early Pioneers of the South Coast.
The Blacks often imitated the voice
With great effect and fine accomplishment.
The Black Whale always hovered round the
coast
—Became extinct; killed by early whalers.
When the swordfish or the dreaded shark
Did attack him, the Bunyip did cry out.
This would bring the whale to shallow water.
Some occasions the whale would throw itself
Right up upon the dry surface of sand,
And there stranded would be eaten by Blacks.
Buropee : I imagine it a great feast would make?
THE DEWMAH


Australie : It did; the Blacks ioined in from miles around.
I grow timid; the- Bunyip may be here —
Hearken, I hear strange splashing near.
This place is sure the seat of mystery.
Buropee : Tush! Naught to harm an innocent young
soul.
Australie: But Nature’s moving and alive just now,
Investigate that yonder shrubbery.
Whistle, if they be birds they will sing, dear,
Then quiz beyond the parapet that’s near.
[Europee does so. The Jeream come forth
in a cluster, and sing at once. The Bunyip
rise, one at a time. They are dripping with
water. Seven of them in turn address Aus-
tralie direct; one is an awkward clown —
foolishly flops over, and cries out of turn.]
Jeream ( Sirius ) : Enfant trove!
The land of thy birth—
The fairest of Nations,
The sweetest of earth.
Unknown to the tropics,
Nor seen in the snow—
Thy praise we’ll resound
Where ever we go.
Ist Bunyip : L’AUSTRALIE ! Thy origin was a mystery,
But with Creation’s dawn begun thy history;
Didst thou from Nebula come just thither
to go?
Canst thou not tell the interested were it so?
Was pre-natal period the eternal chime
That consummated with angelic peal of Time?
Then in infant days didst thou struggle all
alone
Until a Hamtic people sought thee for their
home;
For since those weird people crossed the
bluish main.
Thy coast —with time abiding—ever is the
same.

THE DEWMAH


Jeream : Enfant trove!
The land of'thy birth—
The fairest of Nations,
The sweetest of earth.
Unknown to the tropics,
Nor seen in the snow—
Thy praise we’ll resound
Where ever we go.
2nd Bunyip : Vive I’Australie most surely know
With thy prospective soil.
Cereals may its issue be,
Or fountains charged with oil.
Delve well down beneath the surface,
There the miners may find
The very richest of metals
That is known to mankind.
For iron-bark, and jarrah wood
Thy forest will be famed;
For silky oak and yellow wood,
And other woods, unnamed.
Who bade thy aquatical hold
To take in such a store
Of oyster-pearl, and other fish
~ That none could boast of more.
O come to this young country
And help us now to fill
A nation that is well removed
From all the Powers of ill.
Jeream: Femme seule!
The land of thy birth—
The fairest of Nations,
The sweetest of earth.
Unknown to the tropics,
Nor seen in the snow—
Thy praise we’ll resound
Where ever we go.
THE DEWMAH


3rd Bunyip : Vive I’Australie with thy manifold charms.
Be in thy wooing cautious to proceed:
For the outer world nestles great alarms
From which thy settlers truly once were
freed.
In thy nursery raise no plantation
That’s foreign to us, or thy home-made
creed;
Cultivate but naught from any nation
Politics; rank weeds to blossom in strife.
Copy none but be Colonial home
Made experience in exalted life.
What made strife in land other than thine
own
Will tell thee plainly it had better lie.
Whether in book form, or by living band,
Tell foreign agent to allow to die
But adopt culture native to our land.
Jeream : Parfaite en beaute!
The land of thy birth,
The fairest of Nations,
The sweetest of earth.
Unknown to the tropics,
Nor seen in the snow,
Thy praise we’ll resound
Where ever we go.
4th Bunyip : Vive I’Australie, I prophetically see
An Empire immortal established by thee.
The Statesmen whose duty ’tis thine to
t awake
Have a part in a work that all may
partake.
Why hug so the coast line as seems wont
to thee
When in Centeria great fortunes there be.
Develop that country, and open its mines,
THE DEW M A H


Myriads would go there once they con-
struct lines.
People Centeria—no force on the earth
Would challenge thy right to the land of
thy birth.
Jeream : Femme ideale!
The land of thy birth—
The fairest of Nations,
The sweetest of earth.
Unknown to the tropics,
Nor seen in the snow,
Thy praise we’ll resound
Where ever we go.
Sth Bunyip : Vive I’Australie with a climate so fair.
Landscape of verdure, and hygienic air,
Fame of thy beauty will pass with renown,
Famous will'be of each hamlet and town.
Fashions of Melbourne are lovely to see,
Graceful in manner, as graceful can be.
Greater Sydney contains well featured men.
Handsome its fair sex a million and ten.
Not scorched by the sun nor frozen their
curls.
How handsome thy boys! How sweet are
thy girls!
Jeream : Femme mariee!
The land of thy birth—
The fairest of Nations,
The sweetest of earth.
Unknown to the tropics,
Nor seen in the snow,
Thy praise we’ll resound
Where ever we go.
6th Bunyip : Vive I’Australie in scholarship noble.
Thy children shall be known and respected
As any we see. The banner unfurled
Will settle a place enrolled with delight
THE DEW MAH


In infinite grace. Of childhood so rare
As soon will inspire the love of mankind
That kindleth fire of homes with a child
So dear to caress; and sweet little heart
On bosom to bless. A child in cradle
God’s gift is to man to see its dear care
To best that he can. Exceeds all delights
With heart of true love, parental fondness
—Sweet gift from Above,
Jeream : Matrone ideale
The land of thy birth—
The fairest of Nations,
The sweetest of earth.
Unknown to the tropics,
Nor seen in the snow,
Thy praise we’ll resound
Where ever we go.
7th Bunyip : Vive I’Australie how diligent I’ve been.
Place in firm record the good I have seen.
In Southern Hemisphere nigh to the Pole,
Lies country that grips the Central soul
For art, and scholarship it may abound,
From Alice itself Springs musical sound.
Talent bestowed beneath surface to find:
And fountains below will flow through the
mind,
Where is a circle known standing on feet,
Austral Circle is the Circle Complete.
(All Retire).
(Curtain lowered, scenery and half stage
is obscured.)
THE DEW MAH


SCENE 11. Landscape, on canvas, grass, a few
trees and endless plains extending away
to the horizon.
Enter: EUROPEE and AUSTRALIE.
Australie: Oh darling! How those song birds sang,
’Twas sweet to hear their melody.
But yields despair to know they’ve flown.
Since the Bunyip too have vanished
To the places from whence they came,
Let us then be up and moving
To light a garmbury that’s bright,
To attract some nautic monster,
Recalling back the days of yore
From deep, tempestuous waters,
To battle conflict on the shore.
Europee : Ah! Bustle not thyself dear Australie,
For bustling may advance reason.
Oft doth it move so swiftly in its stride
As to disregard the use of knowledge.
Life’s best blessings come with easy effort.
That which is achieved after hard striving
Is oft scarce worthy of the enterprise.
Hatred and affection are but sisters;
Their origin is of the same impulse.
Hatred is love straying from its ideal
—Open confession of lost energy.
Bitter things are unworthy of the wise,
From the sweetness of life good flows with-
out discord.
Enters VANGELINE.
Australie: (rises up) Dear Vangeline, thy coming is
sweet,
Thou art with Grace and evangel to greet.
Europee: To us thou art a most delightful change ;
What is thy mission, to whom is thy call?
THE DEW MAH


Vangeline: Thy reception heralds pleasure to me,
May it please thee I draw no distinction
To the Burambin also Orroka.
Buropee : Thy cause Ritual or Evangelic?
Australie : Let origin decide it all to thee.
In Europe; Christ has never yet been
preached;
Its names for week days show it’s pagan still.
Infant Baptism was a heathen rite;
The world needs an Evangelic message.
Buropee : Yes! Christ obeyed the baptism of John
And inspired mention in four Gospels;
That serves to all an immortal preface,
It was the baptism of repentance.
Get back to Christ and leave all ritual
Of man where it first originated.
Evangelical preaching is needed.
Interpreted:—Man must be born again,
(All Retire ).

La Mythologie de I’Australie
FYTTE II.
SCENE I. —A little grassy flat surrounded by small
bushes. On the canvas appears a small rise, where a
neat little stringy-bark cottage stands. So constructed —
bark is bound to invisible rafters with green-hide. The
roof is held by sapling poles crossed, and pegged to-
gether on the ridge, also to slightly larger poles running
horizontally across the roof.
Enters: EUMALGA with ORROKA children —
these sit down to form a class. All are dressed some-
what indicative of Native custom.
Enters: NARMBEERA — he and EUMALGA
gently embrace, and brush their faces together; but
they do not kiss. The lights become dim, and a fresh
view appears on the canvas — a round circle showing
a Queensland sky after dusk, about January 25th —
illuminated.
Narmbeera: Hi-jeu gwerdah thou art my darling!
Blackness and beauty are twin sisters—
Born of such' a world as we see above.
Illuminated by the camp fires of the
glorified
Who on the plane of darkness, and space,
Kindled lights of encouragement for us.
Eumalga: Are thy inspirations always of so great a
world ?
Narmbeera : Nah! Gwerdah! But we may look up.
Bumalga: Now tell these children a simple story,
Narmbeera: In the days of volcanoes, when the great
peaks of the Victorian Western plains were active,
and before that when Urda — the giant wombat,


and the marsupial lion (a creature of yellow skin
fur with regular black stripes across his back
a stiff tail that stood straight erect from his hind-
quarter, and in size hardly bigger than a medium
dog) two men, War and Bunya contended. War
was a benefactor, and among many other useful
things, he taught the Orroka the art of repro-
ducing fire. The origin of fire and life are much
associated in the native mind. Having fulfilled his
useful career in this world, War joined Monana
on the glorified plains of Gurrandallal. Bunya
remained and corrupted the Orroka by instructing
them in evil deeds. To punish him War gained
permission of Monana to kindle Wargan (the star
Canopus). From it he lit a garmburrie, and flung
it to the earth. It fell on Bunya’s touri like a
meteor which went into eruption. Roaring noises
became deafening; poisonous fumes filled the air;
and the earth reeled as flames leaped from earth
to sky.
Bunya just sniffed the air, and fell to the
ground paralysed with fear. His counsellors drew
nigh to him, and as they did they realised that the
final ascent was inevitable. They advised him to
banish fear with courage, and not to forget his
weapons, or the Hugar Real-ah (the soul’s path-
way), and Bunya took flight to the starry regions.
He essayed to follow the Milky Way, but the evil
deeds wrought in his lifetime assumed the form
of a monstrous emu and were there to meet him.
The emu’s note arrested Bunya’s attention ex-
cited by its call he looked back, and when he
saw the monster that was after him he dropped
his woomerah and spears, and. made for a tree.
The stars called the Southern Cross is the tree
that Bunya climbed. For being a coward he was
turned into an opossum, and since has been doomed
to stay in the tree. The Two Pointers we call the
THE DEWMAH


Tear-kah, are two huntsmen who were sent to slay
the emu which they did. The deep'black patch
near the cross is the wicked Tkingal (emu) which
the Tear-kah killed. When they threw their spears
at it they struck the cross at points marked by
two nearest stars one at the side, and one at
the foot of the cross.
Eumalga ; Hush! Break off quickly ! Here is Vahgeline.
Come in; welcome. My home is still
primitive.
Nartnbeera: My dwelling is wherever I sit down.
Eumalga: (to Vangeline) Narm, was just discoursing
to the children. ,
Vangeline : Don’t allow me hinder in thy programme.
Narmbeera: Divergence is sweet; I prefer to sing.
Vangeline: (ironically) Then let us have a sweet song
by all means.
Narmbeera: (winking at Eumalga) Perhaps the lady
doubts I can do it.
(Placing Ms. on Piano) : The song and music are
my composing.
(To Valentine) : Thou to the instrument and we
are off.
(Sings): Mingling fears with changes in years;
Or heart made glad in joyful hope.
Well hath it been said good for man
to wed,
Should fancy fall within his scope.
(Chorus) Joy there is in love:
Descends from above;
Sweetest time that’s known to man.
Good to love and lose:
Yet better to choose;
Hold to selection when you can.
THE DEWMAH


Set me to find girl of the same mind;
To share life’s joys with such an one.
That’s fascination in expectation,
That some tender heart may in time be
won.
(Chorus repeated).
Captivating dart —spring within the heart;
Where real affinities abound.
Brightest is the rose-courting to propose.
Delightful wedding bells to sound.
(Chorus repeated).
Vangeline: (smiling) The song suggests a kindred
interest.
Perhaps my intrusion spoilt a romance.
I’d give a sovereign to have only heard
The converse between ye before I came.
Eumalga : (gives a deep, hearty laugh)
Maybe! But then you know, you never know.
Bring the Burambin then we’ll proceed
Where we broke off in love or tradition.
(Exit Vangeline) .
When they return we will kiss and embrace.
Narmbeera : That will awaken more romance than classic.
On the stage of life a kiss is worth more
Than a sky full of classical romance.
Eumalga : We’ll give them both, and see the sure result.
( Knocking without)
Oh come in—most precious unto ourselves.
Re-enter Vangeline with Burambin and
all squat down zvith the coloured children
on the grass except Narmbeera and Eumalga.
Narmbeera: None study the heavens as when lovers
greet.
THE DEWMAH


Bumalga : Speak Nairn., upon this starry scene to us.
Say what they do portend in measured
lines.
(They embrace politely, and kiss simply).
Narmbeera: Hi-jeu gwerdah! Please grant me thy lead.
Bumalga: Starlight in majestic darkness,
Who informed thee to unfold
To our weary mortal vision
Such a glimpse as we behold?
Could thy stars but now inform us
We should here no longer stay:
But we are content to tarry
Till we reach the Milky Way.
Then Gurandal-lal our heaven
Shall to us become more real,
When the Real-ah is our Pathway,
And the Gidgee is our steel.
Like the Tear-kah the great huntsmen,
We shall with the spear that’s thrown,
Send announcements of our coming,
Till we make the tidings known—
To those safe beyond thy precincts,
Where Merrin-al-ing loves to dwell,
Where there is no thought of sorrow
And there are no pains of hell.
Vangeline: Beautiful! Here pause a minute for me.
How wouldst thou express cloud so rising
Or rare thing. How would Natives say:
Comet ?
Narmbeera : Mutta-mutta thunder tigor lightning.
Goon garriner; cloud rising.
Cumba Wallan rain falling.
Goon dare (a star with a tail to it) —Comet.
Jeream lies to east by north from zenith,
Dazzling vision with resplendent brightness.
Wargan’s fire, to east by south replies,
THE DEW MAH


Their lights are seen to Numa and Muna
—The two guardians of the yam-stick stars:
So that Natives who have wandered away
Can find Tellin-Berri, and dig for bread.
In the east is Jubin who missed his tribe,
And there got crushed in coil of monstrous
snake.
His light warns us to keep good fellowship.
Gub-jah are two huntsmen of the north-east
—Like the twin Tear-kak of the Southern
Cross,
Triangulum Nimbin is their Gunyah.
800-gil-ee in the north are handy reach.
The N’Yarrin group yields those little spears.
Now then glance half way between west and
south,
You see that magnificent orb Ginbi,
Half way between it, and lower Tear-kah
Always gives a true position—that’s south.
The two white clouds termed—the Sign of
the South,
Are two sandhills, the home of Umarl,
And we knew those clouds by name as
Mil-100.
What some call Triangulum Australie
Is the famous iguana Umarl’s nose,
So thou canst trace the outline of his tail.
The Black Patch close notable group
Doongi—
Is the great Tkingal who pursued Bunya.
This big emu was speared by the Tear-kah.
The constellation termed the Southern Cross
Is Doongie the tree that shelters Bunya.
The season is young to see the Mangool,
Winter time shows him to good advantage.
Then he is near zenith in the Real-ah.
His shyness led him to conceal his head,
But in black outline can be seen his tail
THE DEWMAH


With which does he control the winds and
tides.
Or is this as Aryan astronomers say by
the moon?
However, fishermen Blacks watched its
movements.
Children! Fishermen stars appear at dawn.
Night out fishing, and come home at
morning.
Children (responding) Yes sir! Oh tell us one more
to conclude,
Lest we venture on the Great Walk About.
We love Dewmah, and are loth to leave thee.
Narmbeera : Goo-rool-gool sends forth continued rays,
Star of Destiny—the reddest of the group,
Rises just-before the planet Mullin.
Until it rises fate is uncertain —
Not prudent for any Blackman to boast
In business venture, courtship, or in love.
This from the Dewmah would silence the
boaster.
Jun ja ying. Gnoor-am-ing.
Thugoo Gooroolgool barg-gandah.
Keep quiet, and listen.
Wait till Gooroolgool gets up.
In English idiom the equivalent would be:
—May be! But then you know you never
know.
(All retire).
THE DEWMAH


SCENE II. —A new bark cottage built in primitive
settler’s design—showing a cosy little front doorway—*
long forms under each window—grassy lawn in front
A little table, and stools for service of visitors on
the lawn.
Enters: VANGELINE, and is followed by BURAM-
BIN children.
Vangeline: Now dear children be seated happily,
I’m expecting visitors old and young;
Be bright, gay, and cheerful while they are
here.
Enters: NARMBEERA, EUMALGA, grown
PRIMITIVE NATIVE PEOPLE and some
NATIVE CHILDREN.
Nannbeera: We are happy to return your visit.
Vangeline: Most happy are we that ye all came here,
For people’s sake what can we here now do.
Narmbeera : Memorise, recall, recapitulate,
What we know best we say effectively.
I.
Vangeline: What place on earth is sweeter
To reflections of the mind,
What friends are ever dearer
Than they we were wont to find
In land we call our birthplace,
Though we leave it oft to roam?
Yet we retain a fondness
For what was our early home.
While sitting by the fireside,
As I often used to do,
My mind went back to Seaton
And to friends my parents knew.
A town in Northern Gippsland,
Where the packers used to load;
I thought of our old homestead,
And a rose bush near the road
THE DEWMAH


11.
Our house was not pretentious,
But was strong on every side,
Rough timber was the frame work,
And the stringy-bark and hide
Supplied the material
Of which the dwelling was made.
Unlettered were they who built
But pioneers to the trade.
They raised for us a dwelling
Where the clay, white native loam,
Perished the tender cuttings
Where the roses used to bloom.
There withered many garlands
And a great deal that we sowed;
Yet flourished one strong cutting
In the rose bush near the road.
111.
Friends passed our old homestead
Who went almost every way—
Admiring little else,
But I often heard them say:
I would I had that rose bush
Over house it doth entwine
With multifloral flowers,
Makes me wish that it were mine.
A friend we had, a teamster.
And his teams were often wild,
I saw him on frosty morns
At the time I was a child.
If the whip came off the handle
He would use it as a goad:
’Twas taken from the bramble
Of the rose bush near the road.
THE DEWMAH


IV.
A charming, fair young damsel
Came upon the evening shade
And there she met our plowman—
Seeking rose bud or the maid.
Though her life had been sunshine,
With its sweetness came a gloom:
Alas! He moved to glory,
And was carried to his tomb.
Years rolled by, and we removed,
To a far, and distant place
Where I met the young widow,
Who retained her youthful face.
Naught she knew of flower talk,
Or the multifloral code,
But understood the meaning
Of the rose bush near the road.
V.
For thirty years I wandered
That I may new pastures seek;
Nothing else I came across
Compared to -Welles’ Creek:
So took me back to see it
When the night was. dark and still,
At Sundown I left Heyfield,
And I walked with a good will.
Yet darkness came upon me
And of moon there now was none,
But I found that dear old spot
Where my lamp of life begun.
I entered our old harbor—
Like a ship that had been towed,
For though there were no beacons—
I found rose bush near the road.
THE DEWMAH


VI.
The dwelling was abolished
With recent owners of place.
Now of our former homestead
There remained but scarce a trace.
I wept in childish fashion
And the night was cold and still,
Yet I could not leave the spot
And walk on to Seaton Hill.
I wandered round the rose bush
Until coming of the dawn,
Just to increase my knowledge
Of the place where I was born,
But naught disturbed the calmness
Save the music of a toad
Occupying little pond,
By the rose bush near the road.
Narmbeera : (to Vangeline) Hast thou prepared little
ones for Drama?
Vangeline : Yes! entitled Faith, Hope, and Charity.
Narmbeera : Well, it all begins at home I suppose.
Go ahead! Who will be the first to rise ?
Vangeline : FAITH is the first to stand up. Proceed,
child!
Though some thousands went to hear,
None had any cause to fear;
The powers over others he did sway
His talents he directed,
So he was not suspected
To hurt where the powerful often may.
He worked for Enmore people
In a Church with no steeple.
After, around the world he made a tour
To tell there is Remission
That’s stated in Commission,
The Blood of Christ to cleanse both rich
and poor.
THE DEW MAH


That was his avocation
Announcing how salvation;
In the terms that are laid down in Holy
Writ.
The Believer to comply.
To obey not argue why
George Walden was a man of holy grit.
Vangeline : HOPE is the next in order to say thy piece:
No sweet name of medical fame
Is more honoured than Austral son,
Who baffled ill with surgeon skill,
And completed what he begun.
When work was o’er upon the shore
Of the sea he spent his leisure.
From many wave he chanced to save
A sweet tiny shell to treasure.
His Christian life was free from strife.
His recording was pure and clean,
His noble deeds like fruitful seeds
In verdant garden by the stream.
Let Verco be, and Joseph C.
In terms for our sons to honour.
Reward will wait upon the great
If they should not see to-morrow.
Vangeline : CHARITY, thy time has dawned; do
speak now:
One there was whose deeds of love —
Prompted by Celestial Dove:
Which flitted from the sky above
—His name being Campbell Edwards.
Great in thought; in actions kind,
Noble, devoted to mankind.
Rare spiritual to find
—The same being Campbell Edwards.
Boys he taught to work the ground
—Love may evermore abound;
Make good use of what they found
—The fame of Campbell Edwards.
THE DEWMAH


Narmbeera : If love is greatest, why is it placed third?
Vangeline: Think! It needs Faith and Hope to pro-
duce it.
Narmbeera: I fear we are becoming too advanced,
The smaller folk are being fatigued.
Vangeline: What wouldst thou I should give them to
learn ?
Narmbeera: Some simple historical incident,
Rendered in most childlike simplicity.
VANGELINE produces a blackboard, pegs it
on stand, and writes upon it with chalk
on both sides.
Narmbeera : (smiling approval) Why that would make
a little Cantata!
As you are pleased, suppose we all sing it:
ALL: A are the Australians England they went.
B are the Bowlers who with them we sent.
C was the Cricket they went for to play.
D is Don Bradman to show them the way.
Troll - lul - la. Troll - lul - la.

THE DEWMAH


SCENE lII.—A number of mia mias, on plain
country of conical design, made of grass—dried and sup-
ported with sticks—forming a little group of dwellings.
A small number of Black children only, gathered to a
circle, Eumalga to the centre. Arrives VANGELINE:
Eumalga: Lovely thou didst come! Dear comfort of
grace.
Vangeline : A harbinger of love art thou to me.
But what of Narmbeera, where is he to?
Eumalga : Gone for a Walk About —I do miss him.
He may be beyond the Never-Never.
But we must proceed with what is pressing.
Vangeline : What Text Books hast thou for young in-
struction ?
Eumalga: None to rest upon except the Dewmah —
It is a collection of Fairy Tales,
Chiefly romances—saying things unknown.
This compiled by the Elders is passed on
Verbally until they knit in the mind
From whence it is recovered as objects
That gave it origin may be noticed.
Just as thou wouldst recover past
Old facts, by reading them over again.
Same principle. Thou hast type, we objects.
Same thing page from one, page from the
other.
Vangeline : But surely it would vary by descent.
Eumalga: Yes! So thy books vary by revision.
The Church of the Apostles is obscured,
Modern ritual has wiped it clean out.
Vangeline: (fidgets uneasily) Let the children have what
thou hast gathered,
But in Native Legend how came it so
That fire, and life are associated?
THE DEWMAH


Bitmalga : It requires a man to relate that.
A maiden must keep within her own sphere.
—lt is learned by reference to things un-
known.
All we know is Creation dawned in sleep.
One day a youthful couple awakened;
—That’s all there’s known; they found they
were right here.
The white crow was their first companion.
Having no speech he taught them by action:
Fire to them would be their chiefest need.
To illustrate comfort he made a nest —
Using a chip, and some gathered dry moss.
To adjust these, by using his strong bill,
Violently tapping the chip through the moss
He produced fire that kindled the nest.
The couple travelled, tired, slept again.
And Runya awakened in cold darkness,
He felt something like a fleshy substance
With woolly tinder, and having no beak
—Like the crow —using such means as he
had,
With a violent action he pierced the tinder,
And reproduced fire and life in one hit.
The grass under them became ignited
And the bush got alight and burnt all black.
The crow and people stayed black ever since.
But lo! The children have wandered away.
I.
Coo-ee! (The children return to EUMALGA).
Now children heed to what I say:—
In safety seek for joy!
He from his elders went away,
A foolish little boy.
And stole a puppy from the stream;
Then to the camp he went,
THE DEWMAH


But mother bunyip in one glean
Closed up that sad event.
Turned into swan, and floated high,
Blacks in lake of water
Now spend their nights in saying why
Vex an angry daughter?
11.
War or Wargan will high up soar
To say his invention.
He calls but to repeat War! War!
To attract attention.
Bur-run-gum Blacks were tall, and straight,
And huntsmen of renown,
They lived away on Dawson Stream
E’er Queensland knew a Town.
They practised some curious arts
And were a constant dread
To animals of lonesome bush
And birds just overhead.
111.
When Blacks assembled by their fire
The bush would often ring
Bright laughter from the native camp,
But birds could barely sing.
Yet reptiles, and the famous birds
For ever shall make known
Their quarrel with those wondrous Blacks,
And efforts of their own.
Bil-el-blew thought he had a scheme
On an effective plan.
Yet he would not disclose his thoughts,
Nor venture near to man.
THE DEW MAH


IV.
He silenced all his powers of speech—
Cast off all form of mirth;
Since it was hardly safe to screech
While the Blacks were on the earth.
Said Brogie Fm of awkward make,
And of a most ungainly size,
I am not very fleet of foot,
And can not always quickly rise;
But I’ll suggest if you agree
That Garra shall go on,
And you will tarry here with me
Then we may hear a song.
V.
But I’ll come in when all is o’er,
Your noble work complete,
Then right unto the clouds we’ll soar
To watch the Black defeat,
Said Garra you are wondrous kind
But grant me this request
That Koo-Koo in yonder tree
Will sit upon his nest,
And let him hold that laugh of his —
To which he does give vent;
Else we shall one and all be killed,
Or out of this be sent.
VI.
So we’ll away and you obey,
Our sharpness now to prove,
Though some may say they came to stay
We may create a move.
It was a great eventful day
When Garra did so speak.
THE DEW MAH


In cover to those wondrous Blacks
He toddled on his feet.
But lodged within the giant gum
The ’Burra could not see
Manoeuvres in the Native camp
From light within the tree.
VII.
So on a branch he came to perch
And Garra took a start.
He signalled hold that laugh of yours
Or else I’ll break my heart.
Then ’Burra saw him peeping in
Between the Natives’ feet,
And when he saw a Blackman move,
He signalled a retreat
But the Goo-re-arl turned around
Then struck poor Garra down.
And to this day his top-knot shows
The blood upon his crown.
VIII.
A boomerang thrown into air
It knocked the ’Burra o’er
—To show mark, lifts his head,
And laughs for ever more.
The Blacks continued with their games
And to themselves they said:
Those birds that sought to learn our tricks
Are now both lying dead.
So to their wurleys they crept off
And thought their breakfast sure,
But birds regained their strength again
Fled past their pursuer.
THE DEWMAH


IX.
Back to the other birds they went
So then to fly away,
And always were they wont to talk
Of exploits of that day.
The Natives were a contented folk
—Never thought of sorrow.
They had sufficient for their day
—Cared not for to-morrow.
When all the Blacks had gone to sleep
The reptiles then did move,
The secrets of that wondrous camp
They thought it fair to prove.
X.
So they collected on a hill
Not very far away,
Determined to invade that camp,
Before the coming day.
Now Yumba was the diamond snake
And he to Merri said:
You are the Chief of reptiles now
Since Crocodiles are dead.
But Merri wrinkled up his brow
And thought he would retire;
Yet to the camp he’d like to go
To steal some coals of fire.
XL
Then Merri learned that smaller folk
Than he would have their say,
To danger’s camp they could rush in
While he might lie at bay
Bnung-ar-um; a jealous wretch —
Goongoo was his rival,
THE DEWMAH


Goongoo thought he would fetch
Warri-mee survival.
While Bnungarum was speaking,
He stole away from sight,
Away unto the Native camp
He crept for all his might.
XII.
The Goongoo went unto the fire
And found it almost out,
But what remained he gathered up
Then turned himself about.
He saw his rival coming on
No distance in arrears:
Because he could not get away
He seized him by the ears,
So when the children ask of you—
His frill is always long?
Just tell them how his ears were pulled
By one he thought to wrong.
XIII.
Bnungarum the stubborn foe
Was larger of the two.
It was a somewhat sultry night
No refreshing breeze blew.
Nor was this all the Goongoo got
On that eventful night,
His skin was pricked; his mouth was burnt,
The bush was set alight.
A patch of prickles was his bed
His prickly coat will tell,
He’s worn those prickles in his skin
Since he among them fell.
THE DEW MAH


XIV.
The Blacks awakened from their sleep
Found the bush was burning.
The native game had all gone off,
No prospect of returning.
Their Goorearl was awful sick
And much inclined to He;
But others said we have no food
We’ll not stay here and die.
Good Brogie, knew he was alone
He flew down near to him,
“Baal budgaree” said Goorearl
My eyes are very dim,
XV.
Said Brogie: What I do for you
That you no longer pine.
Shall I fly away? Get a yam?
Upon which you may dine?
Budgaree! Go! In speed be gone,
I bid thee hasten back.
And sure enough he found a yam
And brought it to the Black.
And Brogie’s fame shall e’er remain
In the Brungum land,
In cave that’s light by water’s bright
He leads a life that’s grand.
XVI.
Still mischief sometimes pursues path
Of those who will forget.
The way of honour is soon lost
Where trifles do upset.
One day a nice group of maidens
Came to that lake to bathe.
THE DEWMAH


And Brogie seized what they put off
Then flew unto his cave.
By magic art a stone he rolled
Right square across the door,
And though they called and begged of him
He’d show out never more.
XVII.
But by chance a dark eyed virgin
With precious brilliant stone
Which shone in resplendent glory
In lustre of its own.
Now this precious gem she offered
To Brogie if he’d take
And exchange it for those garments
He had taken from the lake.
He embraced her liberal offer,
The gem was always placed
Just beside the little doorway
Of dwelling ..which he graced.
XVIII.
Now Yumba thought to poke around
To see how Brogie fared,
And when he saw the diamond
At brilliancy he stared.
He had no hands that he might clutch
The diamond in his grasp;
Nor had he claws—as eagles have
Around it for to clasp.
Yet on his noted little head
He thought he could but try
And balance there the precious gem
Since value was so high.
THE DEWMAH


XIX.
He succeeded that little feat
Then crept away with art,
The gem was balanced on his head
Till reached his lonesome part.
And from that night right until now
That diamond may be found
Upon the noted head of him
Who creeps upon the ground.
Wlhen Brogie missed his diamond —
In most towering rage
He flew from his happy dwelling
To accuse th’ dusky sage.
XX.
The Goorearl became excited,
The bird was nearly dead,
For he got a most tremendous blow
Where the bump is on his head.
The blood streamed down his feathers
Where still it can be found
Ever since he received that stroke
Which felled him to the ground.
Learn the object of this romance,
Do as the Natives say:—
Never strive to poke around, when
Its best to lie at bay.
(All Retire).

Pendant que I’Australie est
en Reve
FYTTE III.
SCENE: A cottage in Bourke.—Nice homely
furnishing and surroundings.
Enter: EUROPEE and AUSTRAUE:
Ruropee : Oh, how glad am I to greet thee —Darling!
Australie : A stream of love to the desert art thou,
But maids alone are Council incomplete.
We here can’t charm Statesmen with our
affairs.
The Legislative trains of Australia
Are always and forever still concerned
How Europe should be governed and con-
trolled,
Though that beats the best talent they have
there.
Ruropee: Never mind I expect Eumalga here—
She’ll likely tell us what’s most needed,
Then we the instrument to pass it on.
Australie : That’s alright but why can’t we have a con-
ference
Of Premiers say to meet at Birdville,
At Bourke, and Camooweal to discuss
The development of the Never-Never
—The most essential thing to our Nation
And a call most urgent to our Empire
And could be reached with considerably


Greater ease, and less expense than Geneva.
But sleep is now my greatest requisite.
(Reclines on couch — sleeps; EUROPEE re-
tires and is seen no more).
—Pendant que I’Australie est en Reve.
{Scene closes).
SCENE II: Seat by small table in centre of Public
gardens at Bourke, many people are moving to and fro.
EUMALGA is seated on Park form by the table.
Arrives VANGELINE:
Vangeline: Dear Gwerdah! Glad thine appointment kept.
Thou art so like thy namesake —Eumalga,
Of historic note when Mitchell came here
That the vision of it now comes perfect.
Eumalga'. May thy coming create an impetus
Of historic rivalry to Batman
Who made agreement with the old Natives
Where the great City of Melbourne now is.
Vangeline: Is thy soul in good comfort and sweet grace?
Eumalga: The Grace of Christ is my soul’s possession.
Vangeline: Then is it well, my news is not cheerful.
Eumalga: Is it that Narmbeera has pain, or died?
Vangeline: It is! Died of starvation, and of thirst,
Far out in the Never-Never country
Where many good Australians have perished
From Burke and Wills to your present hero.
On a walk about one of my mission
Found him dead, and this missive stick by
him.
THE DEWMAH


Eumalga : [Weeps, takes the missive stick and examines
it]. So here it is :
[This is a true reproduction of missive stick —
carved by a native, and reveals the ideographic
method of writing among the Aborigines.
[Translation —Reading from Right to Left.
First symbol represents back of the right hand—
means “I myself No. 2, “Going Away”—The
camp is upside down —the man moving off. No. 3,
“For Good” —the end of the long line of life and
still travelling. No. 4, “Die”—a camp fire —The
centre burnt out. No. 5, “Sky”—after death.
No. 6, “Good-bye”—Two men at the door stand-
ing at angles. No. 7, “This world”—from earth
up to Doongie and above it. — That’s where he’s
going. No. 8, The horizontal bar at the top end
equals a full stop; it means “that’s all.”
Eumalga: Dear Vangeline thine is the influence
To awaken Australie from slumber.
Vangeline: But where is she to? Why is she not here?
Eumalga: In cottage; in dreams; talking in her sleep.
THE DEW MAH


Vangeline: Then I will go in to awaken her.
But let me hear thee first before I go.
Eumalga.: In midst of much conflicting thought is mine.
How can Australia become a Nation
That will compare in strength to the mighty ?
It requires three times its population.
Same administration for white and black
Will wholly eliminate the blackman.
He needs a special Government centre.
This should be conducted by Burambin
Answerable to Federal Government
With an official Office in each State.
Make the chief Native Depot Kimberley
To be Aborginal Capital,
And make all white men stand back from
the town
As they make my people in Alice Springs.
Have in Kimberley more than Mission
Schools
—Secondary, and University
That Natives may be their own magistrates
And solicitors, teachers, and chemists.
Dutch have done all this for Indonesians;
And they are now seventy-five million strong.
Then soon overcrowding their own Islands
Will infiltrate, and eliminate us.
They will trample under foot our Legends,
And displace our Fairy Tales with their
Koran.

THE DEW MAH


SCENE 111. Interior of Bourke cottage —Cosy
furnishings. Australie lying on the sofa —dreaming and
talking in her sleep.
Enter: VANGELINE and EUMALGA.
Vangeline: [Brushing Australias cheek with her own
face ]
Awaken dearest —Time is so urgent.
Australie : f Sits up—Looks drowsy hut then speaks] .
The purpose of our frequent flights to that
romantic state:
For interest rivals what is termed the unseen
hand of fate.
O Dream! Thou the solie production of
man’s unconscious time.
When few seconds are more precious, with
fancy more sublime
Than hours of meditation, arranged in daily
plan
By somewhat unproductive mind, in the
Paradise of man.
O charm of slumbering moments, away
from toil and strife,
How weary would existence be, were there
no dream in life
Hie thee hither while I tell thee of those
things that I saw.
And when I have done remember, I still could
tell thee more
Of the Paradise of Visions, and their
intrinsic worth:
To inhabitants who’re scattered o’er this
extensive earth.
—Pendant que I’Australie est en Reve,
Vangeline : Then spare the Poem, and get down to prose,
Save the dreams, and come to realities.
First dream Premiers’ Meeting, Standard
Gauge;
—The Federal Colossal Lunacy.
THE DEWMAH


Proposed outlay two hundred million pounds,
Would not carry one extra passenger;
Nor increase revenue one lone shilling.
Extend from Bombala to Camberwell,
And you have a uniform gauge at once
From Brisbane to Melbourne via Canberra.
A hundred miles less opening new lands.
Leave whole present Victorian system
Unmarred, unaltered, intact as it stands.
—Pendant que I’Australie est en Reve.
Australie: Dear Vangeline my answer to thee is:
There is no such thing as a “Standard
Gauge.”
One gauge is as good as another.
And the Victorian gauge best of all.
Don’t mar with an adjustable axle
Or middle rail the already perfect;
Maintain, hold to thy respective difference.
Melbourne has the most beautiful system
Of suburban construction that is known,
A matchless ideal of engineering.
What lies at root of cry for uniform
Is abominable administration
And incivility at Albury.
It needs a station of Brisbane design.
Dismiss island platform, and awkward posts.
As tickets are examined on the line,
At Albury only one thing to do:
—Civil, polite, transit of passengers,
Engineering skill could so devise it.
Train for advance could be stationary.
An incoming drawn perfect opposite
Could then step into their new compartment
As easily as to step off a train.
—Pendant que I’Australie est en Reve.
Vangeline : (To Bumalga). It is now opportune for thee
to speak.
THE DEWMAH


Bumalga ; Subject is not worth our debating out.
It’s not Federal, but a State affair.
A Southern concern, and so, leave it there.
Uniform gauge to advance Australia
Is like asking for uniform weather
And there is the same chance of getting it.
Urge construction of a three foot six line
From Bourke to Derby; via Camooweal,
Dredge, and cut out bends in Diamantina
Then go for Bradfield scheme to irrigate
By gravitation the Never-Never.
And Birdville by connection with Manree
Becomes the Chicago of Australia.
Why this periodic cry for more houses
In the over populated cities?
Melbourne and Sydney require no new
homes,
Colonisation should begin at home.
Why canvass Europe for a strange people
When two hundred thousand married couples
Would .gladly leave our Cities for Inland
If the State Governments opened the way.
Give to my people what has been pleaded
—Of English parentage from Orphan
Schools,
Youthful Indian agriculturalists—
To train our Aborigines to farm,
Not make gardens, but big plantations.
Save our people that they be no longer
About seeking frogs and lizards to eat.
But train them to be big proprietors,
Tropical farmers to equal greatest—
The world’s best while Australie lies
dreaming.
THE DEWMAH
