The Church’s Word to Australia
in a “ Century of Unrest.”
Fathers and Brethren, —
The high honour the Presbyterian Church of Australia
has done me appeals to me, already sufficiently burdened,
as a grave responsibility. I will try to fulfil the claims and
duties of this sacred office in the same spirit of brotherly
trust in which I myself have been trusted.
The Church in a Century of Unrest
The most philosophic member of the present British
Government, Lord Haldane—since then Lord Chancellor of
England —has termed our century “A century of unrest.”
He did not refer mainly to the danger of external war. That
danger always threatens. To-day, indeed, its aspect, should
it come, would be fraught with untold horror and ruin,
Britain and the German Fatherland—each with its expanding
commerce, each with its beneficent science, each with its clear-
eyed knowledge—these two mightiest and Protestant Empires
—why should not the world, the seas and lands be wide enough
for the traffic and merchandise of both ? Why, despite the
problems of national place and honour, should nations that
lead the van of human civilisation be so dominated still by
such passions and “such boastings as the Gentiles use,” that
their journals venture to mutter the wild, mad, pagan name
of war ? We Australians know—perhaps better than they
know in the Homelands —that, wherever Germany and Britain
touch on the mission field, it is for common brotherhood;
for the advance of that free Word of God that giveth life.
We know that where France’s authority touches our mission
field, it is often to hinder, baffle, or blight. In God’s name,


and in man's name, we plead that the great peoples of Britain
and of Germany, in their honourable rivalry, may- still have
their energies guided into the paths of peace. And yet we
know that all Europe is but a chain of great armed camps,
latent centres of Titanic destruction, more terrible in power
because the finest results of modern science (which should be
used for man’s uplift and brotherhood) have been invoked as
new forces for ruinous war.
The Social Unrest.
But it is about “unrest” of another kind Lord Haldane
speaks—that social unrest, within the corporate life of each
modern nation and State, which sets class against class, and
neighbour against neighbour; and, by leaguing men, rank
against rank and “combine” against “combine,” tends to
sunder the very bonds of common citizenship; to cut in twain
those ties which unify peoples into coherent and heroic and
magnanimous nationhoods, motived in a common memory
and hope, and fearless against a common doom.
Have we nothing tb say as to this in our own land—we who
are the spokesmen and representatives of the “Kingdom of
God” amongst men? We! who remember that, even in the
Old Testament days, every prophet “stood rooted in the soil
of his own time,” and spoke daringly into the needs and
wrongs, the sufferings and sin of the people round him;
further, that, just in proportion to their intense evangelic
message to man’s soul was the indignation of the prophets’
cry, protesting against wrong done to man’s body, the greed
of wealth, the strong drink, the mis-used justice, the love of
riot, and of wanton sport, the lust, the tyranny, the proud
avarice that trod down the bodies and homes of the toiling
and of the poor, the wrong done to the unfriended girl and
the defenceless widow. “Woe to the drunkards of Ephraim.
Woe to them that join land to land and house to house, till
they be placed alone in midst of the land ! Woe to them that
grind the faces of the poor; and justify the rich and wicked
for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous
from him!”
We are of the blood spiritual of those prophets of Jahveh,
who first woke a conscience in a nation, because they made


men know God’s character, and therefore the character God
demands in men ; first made men know that a nation of men
is God’s human child and “son”; and that its people must
be brothers man unto man. More than that! We are of the
heart’s blood of that mightier Prophet in whom the men
that knew Him thought they saw God’s own face at last, and
touched God’s love; and who called the gear-gathering, avari-
cious man of wealth—amid all his,luxury—“a fool” because
he had no riches of kinship to the unselfishness of God, nor
any thought of that unhoused and suffering poor man outside
his “fence,” to whom the dogs of the city were more brotherly
and thoughtful than his rich fellow-citizen, with all his
barns and his wealthy “brothers,” and his much-stored
“goods laid up for many years.” What, therefore, are we
to say to these things ?
Three Answers the Church Can Give.
I. One thing —to begin with —we can say. It is quite easy
to say, and quite safe, viz., that “the Christian Church is
taking a wrong attitude when it allies itself with either the
forces of capital or those of labour.” That was said by a
clever working man in a Melbourne Church last Sunday. We
thank him for saying it; we commend him, also, for going to
church and taking his place of work and speech in the church
as a working man ought to do. His sons and daughters (to
mention no higher motive) will, thereby, have a better chance
of a career of honour and influence in a healthy, progressive
British community.
But it doesn’t go far. The “fool” who went on building
his “barns” would have said the same: “The clergyman,
shrewd fellow, ought not to ally himself with Capital or
Labour”; and he would have gone on “faring sumptuously
every day”; and Lazarus would have been still left to
the dogs!
That saying is merely negative. Moreover, it covers so
little! For “Capital and Labour” by no means make up the
whole of life —though they so often think they do. Between
“Capital” and “Labour,” and all round them, are the
thousand ramifications of a complex human society which they


profoundly, often terribly, affect—that wide and varied and
often suffering public which “economists” call “the con-
sumer,” but which may truly be called “the people.”
The “Kingdom of God,” brought near to man in Christ
Jesus, makes its appeal to all men and to the people. It
claims men of all kinds and climes. It makes no distinctions
in its message or in its love. It is the only power known to
the modern world that has this unique quality. It is the
quality shown as clearly in the career of “General” William
Booth, that soldier-organiser of Jesus Christ, who died the
other day—having gained the admiration of, not only the
submerged poor whom labour “combines” banned, but also
of emperors and kings—as clearly seen in him, I say, as in
Christianity’s first hour in St. Paul, who sent back the con-
verted slave Onesimus to his gentleman-master to be no longer
a bondman, “but a brother beloved and profitable” to man
and to God; or seen in John Knox, who, in vain, tried to
keep the rich revenues of the ancient Church from the grip
of the greedy barons, that it might be a permanent national
fund for the education and uplift of Scotland’s people and
toilers, and for the maintenance of a trained Christian
ministry, which should bring life and cleansing to man’s soul,
and therefore power to the nation, through the healthful
bodies of its people, made wholesome by the habits of clean
living and the purity of family life. It was Thomas Chalmers,
of Scotland, the preacher of Christ, who^ first (says J. S. Mill)
drew attention to the cording industrial problem and the
wrongs of the toiling masses. It is still the Christian Church’s
workers who pierce into the slum with hands of rescue, making
no distinction between white and brown; and who far away
lay down their lives in disease-haunted lands to save and
uplift the darkened. Over against such practical, purifying
pity, how empty a thing seems the boasted charity of an Aus-
tralian Government in a compulsory “Maternity Bill,” which
puts themselves to no trouble or cost, and which draws the
ruthless line —not at morality, not as against the wronger of
girlhood —but to rigidly exclude and ban any woman—how-
ever purely wedded —who is cursed by any tinge of “colour,”
any shade save that of the European and now enfranchised
Jew. The mother-pangs, the mother-love, are in their case to
evoke no pity and secure no succour. What a hollow farce,


in the name of “charity” and pity and Labour ! What a
too transparent trick to catch votes at a coming political
scramble!
ll.—The Church’s Second Answer
Now, a second thing we can say—(in the name and by the
example of that Christ who—in the same breath —refused to
be a compulsory legal judge between two brothers angry
over the division of the inheritance—the “capital” and yet
spoke against all unbrotherly greed the Parable of “The Rich
Fool” —“Take heed and beware of all covetousness”) we are
here to assert and preach and live those new principles of
Divine, self-sacrificing love, which, constraining men’s hearts,
cause them to hold their power and property and skill as a
stewardship for other men, as well as a reward for their own
endeavouring. Thus the message of Christ, though it takes
sides with no class, but is for all classes, yet sows.into men’s
souls new motive-forces and thoughts of the Divine justice
and love, which fruit by-and-bye into practical forms of civil
freedom and habits of magnanimous citizenship. We need
not wonder, then, at the prophecy spoken (according to the
last English mail) by a well-known democrat member of Par-
liament, that the toiling masses of England will find their
true refuge, soon, in the Christian Churches —not in the
schemes of political leaders and agitators.
lII.—A Third Answer,
A third thing also we can say, that our deepest sympathy
always will be with the toiling, the struggling, the poor. They
ought to be nearest to Christ’s call. For “Mammon,” or the
pride of life, has not dulled their hearts, or made them incap-
able of feeling the sense of the soul’s need.
I believe, moreover, that the toilers are always very open
to words of manful, human reasonableness, if only their wire-
pullers would let them alone, and if approached with courtesy
and with open hand and kindly voice. A single concrete
example (I said recently) is worth volumes of theory. I know
in New Zealand a capitalist at the head of a great industry.
He has never had a quarrel with his men or women. He


respects their Union, he allows them to share in profited yet
he has grown rich, and they have kept self-respecting and
contented. Or take another example; it is also a Presby-
terian employer. In our last prolonged strike, the head of a
great industry, once a poor man himself, took his turn on
Sunday morning with his fellow church managers—several of
them his employees —at the door of God’s house, and joined
with them in showing strangers into pews. They gripped
hands at the door of God’s House as brothers in one undying
family. I do not doubt that man —if left to himself and
apart from the “combine” —would have gladly met in con-
ference with the men, and they could have ended the ruinous
trouble. I have large faith in the human face, the human
voice, the human grasp of hand —the courteous respect for
another man’s attitude —it smooths away a hundred diffi-
culties. And the reason why deputations and conferences so
often fail is, they are made in public, and the disputers talk
to “the gallery” instead of man to man. So long as the
voice of man speaks truth to man—as Carlyle says —there is
the perennial fountain of all good and all chivalry.
The Field for Brotherhood.
But who are “the poor” ? We who preach to men —and
whom the empty-headed declaimers so often idly defame,
are poorer far in gear than these so-called “Labour men
who vote themselves and others solid yearly revenues. And
we whose parishes dip down into all life’s varied needs know
too well that the poor and toiling are never spelled or com-
prehended by the political word Labour. The clerk that
drudges from year to year on a pittance on which he cannot
decently marry, while the shareholders draw big dividends;
the educated governess on half the wage now of an autocratic
cook; the hard-working wife with her bairns about her, and
her often shiftless man besides; the small tradesman finding
himself being beaten out of the unfair battle by your big
“protection’’-supported “combine”—these are but a few of
the hundred aspects of life’s inequality which front and at
times daunt us.
Australia’s Disillusionment.
We pleaded eloquently for a Federated Australia because
■for one reason —it would lessen Parliamentary expenses,


posts, salaries, costliness, offices. Lo! these political patriots
on both sides are steadily multiplying posts, increased
salaries, expenditure, increased taxation; and still the cry is
increased “protection.” It is not a cry of party politics;
both sides seem equally hungry for it. But (while all this
builds up, as in other lands, monopolies, and makes increased
wages only mean vastly -increased cost of living), we that feel
for the people are forced to protest that this cruel cost of
living and increased taxation and “wild-cat” expenditure are
becoming intolerable to the “consumer,” the genuinely
toiling and struggling and poor. We cannot build a great
Australia thus.
I allude to this matter specially because a clergyman’s
home is the kind of life-centre where this can be tested. The
cost of living under our protective system has terribly
increased. But a clergyman’s stipend, fixed by unlucky habit,
does not increase. Our Presbyterian clergy are less scan-
dalously underpaid than the ministers of other Churches.
And yet my own heart is often pained, and at times dispirited,
by the quite inadequate sustenance congregatoins give to their
ministers. I can afford to speak on this subject as many
others cannot. It would not advantage myself. And I say
the time has come when our laity —many of them enriched
under the benefit of fiscal systems and abundant rains—should
take concerted action, and be proud to do it, regarding
adequate support for an adequate Christian ministry.
Australia’s Need.
“Religion is the great State-building power” —says the
eminent historian, Sir J. R. Seeley. “ There never was a
nation except where there was first a Church.” And a nation
ever since the great Reformation day, has meant the nation’s
school. And religion, being the great State-building power,
has suffused the education of the home and of the school.
You have, perhaps, read how, at the recent notable
“Moral Congress” in London, that assemblage of leading
educationists (including a number of Agnostics), resolved that
Bible lessons must be an integral element in the curriculum
of all national schools. Professor Adams, of the London Uni-
versity, the foremost educational authority in British lands,


regards that as an accepted truth of our education in the
coming time.
Now, you who come from other States—New South Wales,
Queensland, Tasmania, West Australia—and who seem to me
specially prosperous-looking and contented —are in a more
intelligent and advanced educational position, in this vital
matter, than we in Victoria. New South Wales has in its
schools those notable “Irish Scripture Lessons” which were
used for years in the National Schools of Ireland, and regard-
ing which its most revered Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Dublin, the late Dr. Daniel Murray, used these remarkable
words in concluding the hearty approbation he gave to these
lessons:
“They are so constructed that they may be used in com-
mon by all the pupils. The notes, therefore, that are appended
to them do not advocate the discriminating doctrines of any
particular class of Christians. It would be unfair in us to
expect that a book to be used at the time of joint-instruction
should unfold any peculiar views of religion. The sacred text
which it contains supplies much of sacred history, and much
of moral precept, with which it is highly important that all
should be acquainted; while the notes which are added are
such as can give no just cause of offence to any other denomina-
tion of Christians.” —(“Life of Archbishop Whately,”
vol. ii., pp. 265, 266.)
Now, no one unacquainted with the ways of Roman
Catholic controversy could explain how, a few weeks ago, the
Roman Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, speaking to the
Premier of Victoria, declared that those very lessons were
“most unsuitable.” And the declaration of a more vehement
champion of the Roman Catholic propaganda in Victoria is
that “they will not tolerate the introduction of Bible lessons.”
They are “Protestant.” Now, here is a notable thing. That
more eminent Roman Catholic Archbishop in Dublin declared
they “contained much of sacred history and much of moral
precept with which it is highly important that all should
be acquainted.” Further, they “could give no just ground
of offence to any denomination of Christians !” The explana-
tion of the change is that the ultra-montane regime, with its
Doyle, and Cullen, and Moran, came in, and we are here face


to face with it. So we have in Victoria to beat back this
dark reaction, and to put our State in line with the modern
spirit of education. It is no longer a question here “Which
system of Scripture Lessons?” but whether the State School
children of Victoria are to have any Scripture knowledge and
atmosphere at all.
The Ne Temere Again.
Kin to this matter (as the White Book informs you), your
Public Questions Committee, on behalf of the whole Church,
protested strongly against the Papal Ne Temere Decree. I
have had to write much on that subject, and will here add but
a few words. I have never met a Roman Catholic layman
or woman who did not intensely dislike that decree. And I
do not think the priests like it. It has struck Rome a hard
blow. The “Scotsman” newspaper, the leading journal of
that realm, declares:
“No sane man can be of two minds as to the iniquity of
the 'Ne Temere’ doctrine, which is but another illustration of
how priests manufacture sin.”
But, when the attempt was made by a Romanist Arch-
bishop, in the most Romanist Province of Canada, to apply
that immoral decree, and to sunder a happy marriage, and to
illegitimise the daughter of that union, you know how a
righteous Roman Catholic Judge of the Supreme Court Bench
in Quebec declared that marriage valid, and that daughter
legitimate, and so, affirming the decree a mere “ecclesiastic
sentiment,” he barred out that cruel attempt at priestly
tyranny. But let every Protestant minister guard well his
young people, that they have nothing to do with these Papal-
ruled proselytisers and breakers of troth in these British
lands. It makes tragedies.
The Nation’s Race-Decay.
Another far darker and more difficult subject it is my duty
to speak of. All the Churches, and the medical faculty and
the Government, too, must grapple in some way with it. It
is brought under your notice in the Report on Religion and


Morals. It is the rapid extirpation of our race, a horrible
development of secret crime, the killing of the nation’s life —
“the child born and the child unborn’’ —as the medical
authority quoted in your report says. That race-murder is
proportionately far. greater than all our increase by immigra-
tion. It is far more deadly to the life and hope of the British
Empire than some dreadful, long-continued war with some
mighty European power.
We are indeed glad for the support of any Church—
Protestant or Catholic —or any public body that will take
part in banishing this diabolic mode of crime—the kind of
crime and vice which atrophied, at the heart, the ancient
empire of Pagan Rome. An effort has, indeed, been made to
claim for one Church —the Roman Church—through its con-
fessional-special immunity from this hideous mode of child
murder ; or, rather, power to prevent it. Statistics, however,
do not, as yet, bear out this allegation. It is a pity and a
wrong to introduce the sectarian question at all into the
discussion of this terrible thing. It is not the Churches that
are involved at all, but what Scripture calls “the world, the
flesh and the devil’ ’ : —the prevailing mood of animalism and
love of passionate sport and cowardly avoidance of life’s pain
and duty —it is this, with its pagan atmosphere breathing all
round our Churches, that makes this hideous danger to-day.
The most eminent statisticians recognise the influence of
religion in opposing this national murder; they point out, too,
that it is “among the better off classes’’ this mode of crime
prevails most widely, and with most callous indifference to the
laws of God and man. It is simple and peasant peoples that
are, as yet, practically untouched with this method of secret
murder. Always, that is true, with one bright exception —
Holland—most highly educated and most religious of the
peoples of Europe, and which has the noble pre-eminence, as
yet, in freedom from this crime. (I hold the statistics in my
keeping, and can give them if challenged.) And here is an
instructive thing. Presbyterian Holland, Lutheran Finland,
Lutheran Norway, Orthodox Russia, Catholic Ireland—these
stand nobly free as yet from this crime. And yet other
peoples, both Catholic and Protestant, give an alarming
decline. Catholic France and Protestant England, and


Catholic Belgium and Mixed America and Australia stand
lowest of all. Alas, England, that once was almost highest
in “fertility rate,” has fallen lowest in Europe, except
France. And Australia is as England.
In face of this respectably-clad mode of murder, the
medical faculty is itself appalled. The medical profession
is, perhaps, the most sacred in the world, as sacred, at any
rate, as that of the clergyman. Both stand between human
life and death, with its weird after-death. And in the main
medical men are honourably worthy of the great call and the
unique power of life and death given to them by the
community and by science. But there are ghouls in that great
profession, who, with human hands, do devilish deeds. And
there are fathers and mothers who do not seem to be human
—do not seem to have awoke to the dreadful fact that this
thing is murder, the basest kind of murder. One can forgive
a murderer who slays his strong resisting enemy; but God’s
deepest curse and damnation must rest upon the parent—the
mother—who deliberately slays within her the child of her
own blood, the fruit of her own life and passion, that she
herself—a callous coward —may go free. Unless we can stay
this crime, the doom of cur nation is near.
Australia and Christianity.
Now, I must not close this address without speaking of
the matter which I meant to make the main subject—the
present spiritual need of Australia —Australia and Chris-
tianity. The census returns prove that race-decay has not
vitally affected, as yet, our Presbyterianism. It has notably
increased; but of that marked increase in our nominal
numbers, how many are livingly joined to our Church’s faith,
and life, and work ? And how many are giving of their means
to our Church’s need? And how many are giving—a finer
gift —themselves, when very young and plastic, or their sons,
when young, to be shaped for the holy ministry ?
I said, “Religion is the great State-building power.” And
St. Paul asks, “How shall they believe without a preacher?
And how shall he preach except he be sent?” “Sent” —
trained, then sent! Look at this vast Australia—on its map !
—that far West, that far broadening North, that hilly,


rugged Tasmania, that dry, sparsely peopled South Australia,
with its patches of rich wheat lands. Then those fertile
regions of Southern Queensland, of New South Wales, of
Victoria, with their untold possibilities, and their already
crowded capital cities !
But New Zealand’s city churches and our own city
churches are eagerly scrutinising what effective preachers we
have—carefully examining what training they had, what
university degree they have, what kind of living force, what
manner of deportment and of power. For our churches 'are
w r ell aware that in our day, no man can hold his place and
shape iand mould the souls and thought and life of men, and
win them to belief in God and in the certainties of the Unseen,
unless he has first shaped himself, and has thought these
things through, and is a master of these Scriptures, the record
of God’s higher revelation to men, record of that living Word
of God which, like a sword, is “ quick and powerful,” but
sharper and of deeper thrust when fitly wielded, and can
pierce into the disceruings and psychology of the heart. And
no man can wield it but the trained swordsman, trained from
a boy; trained from his youth. To heal men’s bodies, you set
yourself to train the healer of men when he is young; it
needs all the romance of youth to lift him above the dull
materialism of the process; to thrill him with the fellowship
of the saving of life.
To make a deft angler, you find him as a boy, and beside
his actual river, and his eye and hand grow agile, as a
perpetual habit.
Need of a Skilled Ministry.
There seems indeed to be a loose, lazy notion abroad that
anyone can be an evangelist; an}mne can preach—this
hardest, greatest, highest of all things; that you can turn a
half-aged potstick-wielder into a swordsman, a potstick into
a quivering, keenly ductile, burnished sword. Oh, no. We
need not go so far as Melancthon in declaring about the
ministry that ‘‘the good man is the learned man”; yet the
history of all God’s Kingdom tells that the lesson of Christ
must be learned for victory. He took young lads, keen,


inspired souls, whose hearts John the Baptist had already
stirred and deepened, as the ploughshare cleaves the
quivering soil. Then He kept them by Him on His
tours and in the private traning, and in company-
men that knew two languages and the spiritual voice
in each, and only gradually sent them out to test
themselves, two and two; and-later He schooled them by
the agony of the cross, and transformed them by Pentecost.
Then came St. Paul, and in the measure of his training
and his knowledge so was his power, and his patience, and his
strength. So it was with Luther, Calvin, Knox. So it was
with Wesley and Whitefield, and Chalmers, and Guthrie—
these, men of the university, whose learning got fused into
the higher learning which is in the face of God to him that
knows.
And Dr. Wilbur Chapman, in impassioned tones, urged
upon our students; “If I could I would go back to the
university and seminary, and take, above all, that three
years’ course in Old Testament and in New Testament
language and exegesis over again. No one can be a great
evangelist to-day, or is stable or safe, unless a thorough
scientific knowledge of Holy Scripture is his background.”
And the Church —and its parents —its mothers must find
us boys to be shaped in school, in university, then in Hall—
with the life romance still in front. No more of your half-
aged, half-disheartened men, with their household cares of
wife and wean crushing them down, to begin this training for
the high, great calling of the holy ministry. It is the young
that go ! It is the young Isaiah that sees the vision of the
Eternal —the awe of Jahveh, the Redeemer —and His
outgoing train of purpose too wide for any local temple, and
cries with cleansed repentance-scorched lips —“ Here am I,
send me.”
And why should our best go to Korea or afar, and leave
only the less fitted behind ? That foreign field is sacred; its
call potent and great. But, what will that avail, as Prof.
Flint says, if you lose the white-faced, broad-browed races?
Save Australia, and we shall save the East.
But why could not I find a man to go to Kalgoorlie,


though a mans© stood waiting, though a stipend of £3OO a
year made at least a sustenance sure ?
The reason is obvious ;it is threefold : (1) All the romance
is being woven round the foreign field. (2) We are not find-
ing, and sending into our halls lives young enough, unencum-
bered enough. And the noble institutions of Ormond College
and St. Andrew’s College do not touch our future ministry.
(3) And, above all, the men our system is training are men
already hampered, fixed down in life. We neglect St. Paul’s
great word: “No man that warreth entangleth himself with
the affairs of this world that he may please him who hath
called him to be a soldier.”
And why won’t our men of wealth open their eyes, their
hearts, their hands, and do this great thing to make Aus-
tralia ? For without this it can not be made. They die —
these wealthy men from Scotland and from Ulster—men
proud of the gallant sacrifice of their forefathers. They leave
behind, at times to more foolish sons —£400,000, £300,000,
but nothing save at times a driblet to God, or to build the
Kingdom of God, in the new isle-continent that made them
rich.
And why won’t mothers cease from the empty, imaginary
heroisms of their sentimental fiction-reading, and, by their
life-effort and influence, mould their sons and daughters to
build a nation for man and God ?
Oh, we can save Australia if you will give us young lives,
young men, and if you will give adequate maintenance for
evangelists, pastors, teachers for the perfecting of the saints;
for the work of the ministry; for the upbuilding of the body
of Jesus Christ.”
