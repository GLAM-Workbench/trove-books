H E various Productions both of Nature arid Art,
here offered to the Public, have been many Years
in collecting; and the Want of a Catalogue of them
has been frequently complained of by Perfons vifiting
.
the Mufeiim; fitch a Catalogue being not only ufeful
O/ O j
to the Virtuofo whilfl infpecling the Collection, but
neceffary to affift the Memory afterwards. Thefe
Confiderations, and the repeated Requefts of many,
/
have induced the Proprietor to form a Catalogue,
with the Price affixed to each Article, Donations
excepted , which he hopes will in fome Meafure anfwer
the End propofed; though he does not prefurhe to
think it free from Error. He muft therefore rely
on the Candour and Indulgence of the Cdnnoiffeur,
to confider the Difficulty of Compiling a correCt
Catalogue of the Articles in a Collection fo extenfive,
and to excu.c fuch iviiftakes as he has not been able
to avoid.
