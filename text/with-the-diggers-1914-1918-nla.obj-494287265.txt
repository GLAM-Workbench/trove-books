WITH THE DIGGERS
1914 - 1918




Foreword
Ever since the formation of THE FOURTH
DIVISION A.M.C. ASSOCIATION it has been the
wish of the Members that we should have
some permanent record to the memory of our
Fallen Comrades: The following pages are
the expression of that wish. They are
intended primarily as an acknowledgment by
those who Returned of their pride in the
brave and faithful Un-re turned.
The Rolls of Honor contain the names of
One Hundred and Eighteen (116) Members of
the FOURTH, TWELFTH, and THIRTEENTH FIELD
AMBULANCES, A.1.F., who made the Supreme
Sacrifice.
This memento, which though slight in
itself, is expressive of boundless sympathy,
is also tendered to those whose thoughts
inevitably turn with pride mingled with
sorrow to the West where the Great Ones are
gone, in the hope that they will find in
their sorrow a new pride in those whose
memories they fondly cherish, and' a new link
with their never-to-be-forgotten dead.
The compiler desires to extend his
thanks to the Digger artists and to a number
of other modest helpers for their assistance,
helpful suggestions, and practical support.
MELBOURNE, August 9th, 1333.




Lest We Forgt'
Perhaps we shall never quite he free of the
memory of the sinistei shadow of yesterday, nor
even move in the light of the new day without some
reminder of the sorrow that has come to many a home,
hut the bitterest hour of our anguish is past and
our sorrow is softened hy the sacred pride in those
"who lie in some foreign field" a pride we knew
not before. That is the heritage they bequeathed
to us. They would not have it otherwise.
Therefore let us hail the new day gladly; for by
their sacrifice we live,by their heroism do we see
the gleaming fields of peace, through the memory
of their endurance and honor shall we solve the
problems that confront us. They have given us new
worlds for old, new values of life and death
From them we have caught the spirit of high
endeavour, and learned that life after all i_s a
great adventure with sacrifice for others.
If they could look at it so, even through the
murky veil of tragedy that encompassed them, shall
we do less?
(S.J.S.)
The blood of valiant sons was shed
That we might dwell ’neath peaceful skies,
Keep green their memory; they are not dead,
On their ideals ourvnationhood shall rise.
r
•••• • • •
They sleep elsewhere in their eternal youth,
With flag o’er them, God’s flag of truth.
They live in hearts. To them our homage give
For glorious deeds that we might live.
Fred Johns.

"OUR ASSOCIATION."
Tilo Fourth Division A.M.C. Association was formed from Members of the
4t> 12t?° AW Medical Cor P s of the Fourth Division,i.e.
f J iDt.., and 13th Held Ambulances and A.M.C. Details. These units were formed
m Bs.pt from Sections-of older Ambulances of the First and Second Divisions
supplemented by Reinforcements. The Ambulances drawn upon to form the nucleus
01 the 4th, 12th, and 13th Field Ambulances were the 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th Cur
Association, therefore', comprises members who served from the outset with the
A.x.r. .and saw service on Gallipoli,
From Bs.pt our Units proceeded to France when the A.I.F. moved over there
and there served till the end of the War, ’
r + ,-, our As s°ciation Banner today bears the names of most of the famous A.I.F.
battles, indicating that our Units served therein.
Our Soils of Honor contain, the names of 118 of our Comrades who made the
Supreme Sacrifice. ‘
After demobilization need was felt for the means of keening alive the spir-'t
of the A.1.F., particularly the-splendid spirit of brotherhood between men in all
walks of life which active service taught us, and for fear that ex-soldiers may.
as in pre-war days, again revert to conservatism tinged with class distinctions’
as a result of mingling only with men in their own sphere of life, and lose the
spirit of tolerance which made, the A.I.F. so successful, and should reflect the
enefit of our Countiy in our civilian life—Associations of ex-Soldiers were formed.
lii our case the men of the 12th Field Ambulance were the first to move, and
a meeting of members formed the 12th Field Ambulance Association in July 7 1919,
The first Social Re-Union took place on 27th September, 1919 in the form of a Dinner
at oargent s Cafe, Blizabeth Street, Melbourne, at which 180 members and visitors
wore present,
\
At a Smoke Bight held on 4th December, 1919, it w&s decided to invite the
4th and 13th Field Ambulances to join with the 12th, and as a result the present
ssociation was formed. Since then at least one function has been held each year
and at the present time we hold our principle Re-Union on each Show Holiday Bve 7
■and the General Meeting which also takes the form of a Get-Together Bight each
Anzac Eve,
Apart from Social Re-Unions the Association endeavours to extend financial and
moral support to Members in need, and takes an active interest in our incapacitated
friends and casual nospital cases. For this and other purposes a strong Committee
meets each alternate month,
A similar Association has been formed in South Australia, and with this
Association and also Members of the 4th Division A.M.C. in other Stages,
in contact. Individual Members entertain Interstate Visiters and visit members
when possible in the other States, This is necessary as our Units were formed by
men from every State in the Commonwealth.
(Cent.)


You are earnestly exhorted to support your Association to keep alive
spirit of the A. I. F. and Old Comradeships for your own pleasure and benefit,
likewise that of your Old Pals, and also for the .good of our fair Country and
our sons and daughters who are to inhabit it. You can best do this by
attending all functions and.bringing along a few old FOURTH DIVISION A.M.C.

"WHY THE SOLDIERS SANG"
Delve back into history - even in to the din distant Ages, and it will
be found that Soldiers, whether inarching or in Camp or whenever other oppor-
tunity offered, gave vent to their feelings in song. This applies not only
to British Troops, but to Soldiers of all nationalities. The troops of Alex-
ander the Great, HaMibal’s mercenaries, Caesar’s legions, we are informed by
historians, all sang. All their songs have been forgobten and lost to us.
Even the sohgs of the soldiers participating in the South African Campaign
are almost forgotteri today, and words and music are difficult to secure.
The Soldier Songs of the World War vdll not readily be forgotten by
those who took part in the Campaign, Possibly, to the civilian who was not
priveleged to share the joys (?) and sorrows, some of them, especially* to
the thoroughly genteel, will appear vulgar ani even coarse. They who have
this opinion miss the point and fail to realise that these songs were not
sung jn any such spirit, and further, such a glamour of men cries is woven
round them that they have become to the Soldier something a tin to what loanns
are to the ardent church-goer. A Digger He—Union or fellowship meeting with-
out some of the old favorites would be a "dud' 1 . Lot us illustrate: An
association of well meaning ladies have established an "Anzac Pellowship of
Women" in London, At their last meeting, April 2 sth, 1233> the musical pro-
gramme was excellent from a musician’s point of view, but drew protests
from the "Diggers" invited to enjoy a couple of hours of fellowship. As one
put it "We don’t mind a bit of gloom at the Cenotaph and at the Church service.
That’s right and proper, but it ain’t fellowship." He then went on to demon-
strate their idea of it by singing, in which he was joined by his cobbers,
"Pack up your troubles" , As an encore "Tipperaiy' 1 followed. Probably had they
sung "Mademoiselle" the listeners been shocked, but, contrary to
general supposition, only a very small proportion of sungs sung by the troops
are improper in subject or in language, and then the obscenity was merely
technical, because, although gross and foul words were employed, they were
used habitually as mere intensives. Ninetynino times in a hundred there was
nc thought in the soldier’s mind of the literal and obscene meaning of the
word upon his lips.
Soldiers sang in the last War for the same reasons as their counterparts
in history and mainly for the same reason as a bird in healthy condition
sings. Probably at no time in their lives were they so physically fit, and
they sang to express this physical elation. Some who had never sung before
joined in the chorus. Others gifted with a good singing voice added to a
sense of humour were God—sends in the fact that they lightened, many a
lagging footstep on the march and chased away the bogie of depression in the
cheerless trench and hut.
They sang, too, to express in an indirect way their feelings and senti-
ments. The open expression of sentiment regarding wives, families, and sweet-
hearts would court trouble. Singing expressed these feelings in an impersonal
way. Indeed, there were songs for all occasions. The War with it’s mock
heroics, it’s flag-waving and speech making, were the subject of some bitter
ditties. The Military System with its "full dress parades", saluting and
punctiliousness in trifles came in for its share of humorous banter..
(Cont.)


these may bo coupled songs specially- directed at the virtues (?)
of Superior Officers especially Sergeant-Majors.
Cogitation on their civilian life and its blessings compared with their
existing condition!
11 Dreaming of things they did mth balls and bat,
And mocked by hopeless longing to ±egai.i
'Bank holidays, and picture shows, and spats,
And going to the office in the train.
led the Soldier to sing such songs as " wlien this blasted War is 0\ er , an.i
11 1 -want t o go Home 1 ’ •
Other occasions, such as Celebrations of Drink (of happy memory) brought
to life songs suitable to such occasions. Who does not remember
sions, bo you teetotaller or not? Don't you remomoer Here'S to .he jood Old
Beer? 1
Dc vou remember, too, when llonsense ar.d Burlesque were in the air? Those
were joyous occasions and called for songs and encores. Singing of ‘clips class
was to the Soldier w.iat the theatre, concert hall and cinema had been .0 him in
his civilian, life.
Certainly 1914 —1918 days were unique. They will, pray G-cd, never bo
repeated. The songs of the period were in keeping with the times, xiany of
the old favorites are here. The compiler offers them to you hoping that they
will bring back to you in these piping days of Peace happy recollections of
some occasion, pleasant thoughts of cobbers, and help to preserve that lellow-
ship that existed to such a degree in the A. 1. P. Cnocriol

Our Comradeship lives still.

Back home in Tennessee,
Just try .and picture me,
Eight on my Mother’s knee,
She thinks the world of no.

Make me love Mol her more,

And friends I used to know,
Wliy they’ll be right there to meet me,

On Wednesday a, Bus sax;
On Thursday I gang pot wi’ a Scottie,
On Friday the Captain of -'the crew;
But on Saturday I’m willing
To make a man of any one of . you.
Sunday I walk out with a Bo’sun,
On Monday a Rifleman in green,
On Tuesday I choose a ”sub” in the ’’Blues”
On Wednesday,- a Marine.
On Thursday a Ferrier from Tooting,
On Friday a Midshipman or two.
But on Saturday I’m willing
If you’ll only take a shilling,
To make a nan of any one of you.
BACK HOMS BT TEHEESSEE. (Parody)
Digger 1 ' s version.
Way down in the old Front Line,
Oh, that will do for nine*
Amidst the rain and snow,
Gone are the pomp find show.
All I can think of tonight
Is the parapet of white;
Bombs are dropping, Sells are popping,
Ho relief in sight.
The run we ought to get
Han not been sighted yet.
1 5 me sure we’ll get trench feet
With nothing hot to eat.
We’ve used the bombs they gave us,
And there’s no dug-out to save us.
Till we get back, Till we get back.
To our old Estaminet,
In nineteen thirty-three,
Just try and picture me,
In Aussie o’er the sea.
That’s where I*de like to be;
All I can think of tonight
Are the fields of snowy white.
Freezing, snowing, Machine guns going,
Berlin out of sight.
The Fritzies in the trench,
Behind then leave a stench,
I’de like to see my wench,
Hot the one who parleys French,
She’ll be right there to greet me,
If she’s not too old to greet me.
When I get back, When I get back,
In nineteen Thirty-three.
WE EAVEHT SEEK TEE KAISER.
We haven’t seen the Kaiser for a

terrible time.
We cane to France to see what he was
doing.
The A,I,F. will be his blanky min.
We haven’t seen the Kaiser for a
terrible tine.
He must have been blown up by a mine
(we hope so)
He was the leader of the German Band,
So hang him—he’s no cousin of mine.

The Sergeants they get bread and cheese,
And mop up all they can,
But all the poor old privates get
Is bread and jam.

There’s fighting to be done,

Chorus
Boys of the Dardanelles,
They faced the shot and shells.
Down in hist fry their fame will go,
Our children’s - children their daring

Australian lads in kharki and in Blue
Have shown the world what they san do.
How they fought and fell,
The cables daily tell,

In the City you work so hard.

That you’re wasting so much time,
With your lips close to the telephone,
When they might be close to mine.
Kitty she was pretty,
Kitty she was witty,
She went to the City
Where they tried to pull her leg.

Thinking to be witty,
Hit her on the titty
With a hard boiled egg.

No blood fine as mine in China.
At night when lights are low
He wanders to and fro.
He’s a robber of the Orient
And he’s filled with Chinese sentiment.
At night when lights are low
He wanders to and fro.
He’s a master of the art,
He can steal the ladies’ heart;
love he’ll plunder, he’s a wonder,

Shelling the' trenches and strafing

We started with fifty odd non-coms

We started-with fifty and got back
with ten,
And if this blinkin’ depression don’t
end very soon,
Ther’ll be nobody left in the Ruddy

Hi toor al li ooral lil aye.

ONWARD. CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS.
Onward, Christian Soldiers,-
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ the loyal Master
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See-, His banners go:
Chorus,
Onward Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
-Going on before.
At the sign of triumph
Sathn’s host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers,
On to victoiy.
Hell’s foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices.
Loud your antems raise. (Chorus)
Like a mighty any
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading
Where the Saints have trod.
We are not divided
All one body wo.
One in :hope and doctrine,
One in charity. (Chorus)
t hi
Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
’Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise
And that cannot fail. (Chorus)
Onward, then, ye people,
Join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honor
Unto Christ the King,
This through countless ages,
Men and Angels sing. (Chorus)
Amen.
FOR THOSE AT SEA..

Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,

For those,in peril on the sea.

0 Christ, whoso voice the waters heard,
And hushed their raging at thy word,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
And calm amidst its rage did sleep;
0 hear us when we cry to thee
For those in neril on the sea.
0 Trinity of love and power,
Our brethren shield in danger’s hourl
From rock and tempest, fire and foe.
Protect them wheresoe’er they go;
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
Glad hymns of praise from land and
sea.

THROUGH THE FIGHT OF DOUBT AND SORROW.
Through the night of doubt and sorrow,
Onward goes the pilgrim band,
Singing songs of expectation;
Marching to the Promised Land,
Clear before us through the darkness;
Gleams and burns the guiding light,
Brother clasps the hand of brother;
Stepping fearless through the night.
Onfc the light of God’s own presence,
O’er His ransomed people shed;
Chasing far'the gloom and terror,
Brightening all the path we tread;
One the object of our journey,
One the faith which never tires,
One the earnest looking forward,
One the hope our God inspires.
Onward, therefore, pilgrim brothers,
Onward with the Cress our aid]
Bears its shame, and fight its battle,
Till we rest beneath its shade;
Soon shall come the great awakening,
Soon the rending of the tomb;
Then the scattering of all shadows,
And the end of toil and gloom.

There are girls he married secret,
asking no permission to,
for he knew he wouldn’t get it if he did;
There is gas and coals and vittles, and

And it’s more than rather timely there’s
a-kid.
There are girls he walked;witn casual.
They’ll be sorry now he’s gone,

Although you knew the price that you
.And ho might have to pay,
Now ho has gone for ever
You vrould not have it said
An Australian Mother whimpered
Because her son was dead.
Eg wen his Gross in Flanders—
How proud you were, that day;
lour eyes were Bright as though the light
Cf Heaven shed its ray.
There*s another cross in Flanders
Where he is laid to rest,
Hut only nears can tarnish
His Cross upon your Breast.
1-Tot yours the joy of Battle, —
Only the griefs and fears;
Hut the hero’s grave of the son you gave
Is wot By a nation’s tears.
Ye afflicted Women of Australia
ITo more misunderstood-
Your sacrifice shall ever Be
As a crown of Motherhood.

The skies that arched his land were blue,
His bush-born winds were warm and sweet,
And yet from earliest hours' ho knew
The tide of victory ani defeat;
Prom fierce floods thundering at his birth,
from rod droughts ravening while he played.
He learned to fear no foes on 'earth
"The bravest thing G-od ever made:"
The bugles of the Motherland
Hang ceaselessly across the sea,
To call him and his lean brown band
Td shape Imperial destiny;
He went, by youth’s grave purpose willed,
The goal unknown, the cost unwffiighec.,
The promise of his blood fulfilled— —
"The bravest thing G-od ever made:".
We know—-it is our deathless pride.*
The splendour of his first fierve blow;
How, reckless, glorious, undenied^
He stormed those steel—lined cliffs we know;
And. none who saw him scale the height
Behind his reeking bayenet-blade
Would rob him of his title-right-
"The bravest thing G-od ever made:".
Bravest, where half a world of men
Are brave beyond all earth’s rewards,
So stoutly none shall charge again
Till the last.breaking of the swords;
Wounded or hale, won home from war,
Or yonder by the Lone Pine laid,
Give him his due for evermore
"The bravest thing Gcd over made:".

Watch with dreed for news each day,
White-faced mothers, worn with weeping,
Think of one thing when you pray.

God has known your boy since childhood,
Guarded, loved, him day by day,
Would he leave him Just when duty
Called him from, his home away!
He who knows his;country needs him, '
He boy, who longed to fight,
i'or the sake- of those who suffer
Will be precious in God's sight.

Living, wounded, dead, or missing,
Eace the words one must be true;
Through your prayers be very certain,
God is with : him——and with you.
EIGHTEEN YEARS TODAY.

”Tell me why you're dreaming, daily,’
Said ry little son to me,
So I told him all about it,
As he sat upon my knee. •
I told Mm of that Sunday morn,
? Twas eighteen years today,
When the nen of Australasia,
Joined; the mighty fray.
? How they landed on that Eoreign shore,
And foughtthat gallant fight,
Of how they nobly ,won the day.
And put the Turks to flight..
We saw the cliffs before us,
To be scaled ’mid shot and shell,
■ And our' comrades fell around us
I remember it so well.

There are some who*ll sleep forever
On a Mil that ! s called Lone Pine,
And the twenty-fifth of April
Will be famous for all time.
And so to keep their memory green,
We march each Anzac Day,
To pay tribute to those Heroes
Who gave their lives that day.

Sez I: My Country? Mine? I likes their cheek.
Me mud—bespattered by the cars they drive,
Wot makes my measly thirty bob a week,
And sweats red blood to keep myself alive]
Fight for the right to slave that they may spend,
Them in their mansions, me in my slum?
No, let ’em fight wot’s something to defend:
3ut me, I’ve nothin’ —let the Kaiser'come.
And so I cusses ’ard and well
3ut......wpt- the ’ell Dill? Wot the ’ell?
Sez I : If they would do the decent .tMng,
And shield the missis and the little ’uns,
Why, even I might.shout God save the King,
And face the chances of them ’ungry guns.

Today some boys in blue was passin’ me,
And some of ’ben they • 'ad no legs to walk,
And some of ’em they ’ad no eyes to see.
And—well I couln’t look ’em in the face,
And so I’m goin’ to declare
I’m under forty—one and take me place
To face the music, with the bunch out there;
A fool you say] Maybe you’re right.

TK3 , AUSTRAL InlT wAT. (j. Alex. Allan)
11 The gameness of these Australian troops who have followed immediately on the
ieels of the G-emans fairly warms your heart. On Thursday, Below Bapaume, an Australian
lame walking in across country, over the grass of a paddock, stepping quickly. He might
lave Been one of the hands on a at home huriying Back from work to tea,. .Presently,
iis message delivered, off he went. Back the same track without fuss and without orders,
just doing Australia’s work in the old Australian ’way:"
Official Press Representative Bean, from France, 19/3/ 1 17«
&.s I came southward from burned Bapaume,
over the meadow grass,
A chap with a note-book ’opped aside,
waitin’ to let me pass.
11 ’Day to you, Sydney” ’e says to me, an’
I says to ’im sho'rt, ” Good-day I
I’m doin’ a bit of a job for ’Aig, in the
old Australian way.”
!l ’lTrryin’ like:” ’e says again; an’ I says
to ’im, "Struck it, Steve:
I’d sooner wake than I’d talk, I says, an’
’e saw the bars on ny sleeve;
An’ over my shoulder, as on I swung,takin’
a final look,
I see ’im suckin’ ’is pencil soft, an’
making notes in ’is book;
An’ rnixin* in with the C.O’s, message,

"Carry on, cobber:”• ...
(It says to me) .
r' " ”ln the old Australian way:”
There’s some-.of us come from the cattle-
lands, an’ x some from the ’arrow’s tail,
in’ seme ’ave served in a dry—goods shop,
an* others ’ave served in jail;
There’s raco’orse owners an’ pigeon—shots,
an* blokes from the. Might—’Ave—Been,
G-rinnin:’ or serious, slim or stout (but the
most of ’em’s long and lean),
’Andy as most to a job, per’aps, but death
on the after—fuss
An’ the name of the land that fathered us
is the name that will do for us:
Oh, many (an’ crook:) are, the roads we
tread, yet jail roads lead to Home,
in’ we’re doin’ our job in the way we did
the jobs that we ’ad at ’ome;
Though quite a number ’as bank .accounts
(an’ some ’ave never a tray),
Don’t fancy you’re cornin’ to pat our ’eads,
or ’and us a small boquet.
We’re f ini shin’ up,
As we started out,- -
In the old Australian way.
We’ve dared the dark an’ the rippin 7 wire
for joy of the raidin’-rush,
We’ve cracked it ’ardy, beddin’ down in
the thigh-deep frozen slush,
An* the paper—bloke ’e ! as touched it off
as "an incident of patrol” .
When we chivied the German rabbit out from
*>
’is burrow an’ funkin’ ole.
'We’re evenin’ up (an’ we’re doin’ it quick)
the gaps in our reckonings,
But we’d rather you choked before you said
we walked like ancient kings.
We’re sick to death of "the Anzac touch”
an’ the blitherin’ ” l earts of oak,”
Which is settin’ the standard much too ’igh
for the plain Australian bloke;
For the ’And that sends us the jumpy night
an’ the most un’olesome day,
’S made us no bloomin’ bric-a-brac —S
shaped us of workin’-clay,
To carry on
(You’d ’ave us so)
In the old Australian way:
Oh, whether we’re schoolin’ the shell-
scared teams, waitin’ the word to go
(An’ it ain’t like steerin’ a timber—team
on the flank of the Dorrigo),
Or whether we’re racin’ an’ floppin’ to
shoot ahead of the whipped advance
(Oh, I’ve shot breakers at Manly,too, but
they wasn’t a circumstance),
Or try in’ to read your family name on
one o’ their blasted shells
(Oh, the buryin’—party’ll dig—in your disc,
if they can’t find nothin’ else),
Or wallowin’ belly-down in the mud ) wi'oh'
the cutters set to the wire,
Or floggin’ a Army Service cart through
the zone of their scourgin’ fire,
Or bumpin’ back with the broken ; stuff in
a stretcher or motor-dray,
There’s never a squeak, though you listen
’ard, or a premature ”’Ooray:”
For we’ll carry it through
(As we used to do)
In the old Australian way:

RAIDING (Continued).
Trained? Yes, fine—like racers for the Cup;
Yonder lies the winning post, still as
death as yet
Fritz and his machine-gun (pup-pup-pup-
.puh—up;)
Soon enough you 1 11 hear 'em sweep down
the parapet., :
Toss- aside the sandbags that smother up
the sap;
Coming back—'if_ we come back—we'll pack
'em snug- again:
Past the. gate to No-Man's Land, pouring
through the gap,
Charge and scream like forty fiends,
■ yelling through the rain.
Ducking pas t the duckbo ards, st akes and
rusty wire,
Common swad, and officer, men as good as you;
Sooner have our slippers on, sitting by
the fire;
Rather be at home in bed but there's work
to do!
Holes: 'Ware holes: Look and leap and pass—
Quick; stride quick where the rotting
bodies lie,
Crashing tlirough the ribs of men in the
hip—high grass.
Cursing, sweating, stumbling—hear their '
lines reply: v . r
Hear the scary gunfire break: See the
Very lights:
Race and squatter through the mud (is, it
mud or glue?) •. \-
Pritz, you're where we'd like to be on
these winter nights; rj
Shame to drag you out at all—but we're HEC
wanting you:
Rip and fumble through their wire, swing \1
and tear and shift,
Pall and lie or find your feet (some are
lying 5ti11)....
Poot and fist and butt drive home, club A
and side-arm lift r
Ho, the hounds of war are out, smelling
for the kill:
Back: Strike back; Mad and fighting-
_ blind:
Home, turn home and chence your way
'across!
Many a gunner and .his gun lie in smash
behind
Many an empty funic—hole beneath the
parados:
Scatter for the .lines again, dodge
and run and step,
Crawl, and thread the welcome grass,
till the trench you win;
Press the wound and struggle on, and
if. you should drop.,
Pind a friendly shell-hole and we'll
bring you in;
Ducking to the duck-boards through the
sally port,
Near a score of us went out ten are
overdue.
Nine of us with aught to lose (time
- and Joy are short)
Call again and call for men, we ! ll be
here for you:


THE - RECORD.
If you can spare a mini t, Boss;
(Thailks; Mine’s a glass of ale),
I’d just like you- to listen to
A simple soldier’s tale
A tale o’ King and. Country,
Of cannon, shot and shell,
And a -gallant Khaki soldier
Who served his Country well.
When the call came from the 'Omeland
I saw me duty clear,
I left me lodgin’s and me Pals.
Horse-racin’, work and beer;
I did me duty noble,
The Huns was on the go,
When the Kaiser heard about me,
And a sniper laid me low.
- 1 v ......
Me left arm hung quite helpless,
So they passed me out "unfit,"
And I came back to Orsetrailyer
Peelin’ proud I’d done me "Pit,"
And idie crowd ;had heard- about me,
Por they cheered and cheered like mad;
There was whisky and refreshments,
And the whole darn world felt glad.
But the gladness didn’t linger,
When I started out next day,
To touch Defence Pay-Office
Por me little bit o’ pay;
ihe clerks was pert and cheeky,
With Pomatum on their ’air
And swore, by holy Dinkum; ’
That my money wasn’t there.
Tney said they couldn’t trace me,
Though I called and called again,
lill, at last, one clean—shaved Johnny
With a little bit 0* brain,
And a great big round-faced dial
Lookin’ like a risin’ moon,
Says; "You was ’killed in action
On the^twenty-eighth of June:"
; (Harold Hansell )
*You silly moon—faced poley cow,
J*m..stand in’ here.," I said;
Says he;. '*l ’ave your ’record,’
ind theyjve passed you out as ‘dead;»
And ‘dead 1 you*ll darn well have’to be
Our ’records’ all is true,.
And we ain’t a—goin’ to change ’em
lor a Khaki brute like you.”
■You bet; i raised a ’oly row,
And gave ’em all "what for;"*
You bet. i fussed unoil I see
The Minister o’ War.
Sa; : s ne; "Send for his ’Record;’
And when it come he said;
’My .iriond, you ’ave ny sympathy;
Rrave ’ero you are dead:"
That’s how they treat a soldier, Boss:
Who donned their darned Khaki,
And fought well for his Country
In them lands across the Sea, *
Where he pinked the Him by thousands
To say nothing of the Turk;
Then tell ; im; "..Died in Action;
Better go and look for work;"
So I’m sorter "gone to Glory?’
And a sorter left behind; * 4 . ..
T’m striving ’ard for Justice"
And the Publick’s -very kind*
They shout me meals and , dicker,
And a bob or two a day;
They’re sorry for me ’orful late—
A man root’s "Passed away,"
Records Corporal:-" Y ou was killed in
a cti on on the twenty— eighth of June".


GOOD OBD NO. 9. (J• M.Harkins)
If your head is acMng and your bones
are very sore,
A cough tears your chest like p. blunt
cross-cut saw,
Or if your back feels if ’twere going
t** break,
And with the shivers you tremble and ;
shake,
Perhaps it’s bronchitis,- consumption,
or gout,
Lumbago , neuritis —-you’re ill without
doubt;
It may be the stomach, liver or "flue",
The kidneys, digestion, heart trouoloybco,
A chili Dr a. cold may have ycu in tight
:grip,
A touch of asthma or just-the plain "pip" .
A corn or 1-union may cause you much pain.
.It may be toothache cr neuralgia again,
Rheumatics, anaemia or appendicitis,
Or just•common or garden tlreditus;
Wliab ere ycur complaint, pray don’t lose
your head,
He won’t cure that, or a limb you nave

But if you’ve one of the aforementioned
ills,
Our M.O* mil cure you Mlh No. 9 pills.
A NEW VERSION (Joke Arroll)
Old Madam d’Otsox
Went to the grub—box
GMps for the Diggers- .to cut, sir;
But when she got > the re
Eini porames de terra, ‘
So the poor Digs koonagutzer.
Uprose the suffering Warriors
In awful, righteous wrath,
They slew -him- there, with dismal air,
ind cast Ms carcase forth.
Then quoth the oldest soldier,
"So there ’s an end to that;
Tnus perish they who—liars —say
They haven : t got - one•chat.
"Your troops are. full of spirit]"
Said the Frenchman, "Oui,tres bon."
Too right," the Q,.M_. said,- " they 1 ve

THE CHAT 1 S PARADE.
(o »M.Harkins)
When the soldier, fagged and weary,
In surroundings that are dreary,
Aside lays he ; his rifle and grenade,
Seeks solace in forgetful slumber,
From shell—crash and battle J s thunder,
ITis then the ‘'chats' 1 are mustered for
parade ' j .
At the dojible about bis back
In a most irregular ..fcraok
They make for the -parade—ground on his
spine.
'Then there they will nevkr keep still,
Undisciplined they, stamp at will,
And up and down they march in ragged line.
Round his ribs they do manoeuvre,
Curses issue from the soldier,
There 2 s di visions by the score, be declares,
Eoing artillery, formation
Without Ms approbation,
He wriggles and he twists and loudly
swears •
Through long, dark night they carry on, '
At the charges they become tres bien,
The soldier to disperse them madly tears
With savage fingers at Ms skin,
As he prays for the morning glim,
In darkness, though-? the victory is tneirs.
The morn at last breaks good and clear,
Light is**this "Amy's" one great fear, .
They retire warn flannel trenches,
But not too long there they linger,
Eor the soldier’s thumb and finger,
Houts them out with unregretful wrenches.
But no victory is there wen,
Eor again reinforcements cone,
And in darkness of night again attack;
So on the fight goes——on and on,
They are almost like the lion I
Their foul deeds are performed beMnd
the back.

THE LONE PINK CHAcIGB. (8.1i.H.)
(One of the’special values attached to
this poem is the fact that it was
written in the captured trenches
immediately after the engagement.)
The boys of the First Brigade stood to
their arms;
Prom the lines of the foeraan rang out the
alarms. " ■' ■—
We crouched as we waited the shrill
whi st le blast,
Bach knew that the effort might well be
his last.
The signal rang out, ani we sprang to the
work,
With bayonets in line, and each face to
the Turk;
And we thought every gun in the universe
talked,
As the reaper, grim death, took his toll
as he stalked.
The wounded fell-prone, ne’er again would
they rise,
Por the shrapnell sowed death as it rained
from the skies;
But - the remnant pushed on, and ♦ame up -
with the Turk,
Great gaps in their ranks, but in stern
mood for work.
Some Turks stood their ground—there were
some who had fled,
But we harried them well, and the trenches
ran red.
They plied us with shot and the dread
hand grenade,
Yet slowly, but surely, our progress we
made.
Por six days and nights raged the battle
apace,
And each showed the other the dash of his
race.
But a silence crept over the trenches one
: ■ night,
And we knew, when it deepened, that we
owned the fight.
Not a hand grenade thrown-r—not a shot
from a gun,
wo breathed for a- 1 space-—-Done Pine had
been won, !
She 7/as only a shoemaker’s daughter
but she gave him a frightful welt.
GETTING- BACK. (8.1i.H.)
I*ve heard men say, when in the camp,
Or on the sea, or on the tramp,
The tales they*ll tell to folks at home
If they win through, and cross the foam
•And get safe back.
Some cariv with them day and night,
A souvenir of some big fight.
To show to friends where they have fougi
On fields where victory’s dearly bought-
If they get back.
.»hile thunderous- cannon rend the skies,
They face the foe with steady eyes;
Though some get through, there*s some
must go,
Who try conclusions with the foe.
All can’t get back.
Our boys who fell have left.a name
Upon the priceless lists of fame;
The memory of those brave hearts dear,
Is all I ask as souvenir,
If I get back,

WAR NEWS FROM THE PRESS.
Some of the war news is very perplexing
and only that I am most trustful and never
douht anything that I read in the "Baptist
Banner" I should look upon the following
news items as suspiciously as a crow does
at a man with a gun:—
The G-ermans have taken Cascara on the
Dutch frontier, and are likely to soon rust
the Dykes in Holland.
Later: The War Office admit the talcing of
Cascara, hut douht the ability of the
Germans to hold it foi long.
Latest: The Germans are evacuating every-
where.
Later still: The strain on the German rear
is something terrible.
The Germans have invested Hamur. Later on
the. Allies will invest the war. indemnity
they will take from Geermany.

SCOTS OP THE HIV ERIKA. (Henry Lawson)
The boy cleared out to the city from his
home at the harvest time
They were Scots of the Eiverina, and to
run from home was a crime.
The old man burned his letters, the firet
■and last he burned,
ind he scratched his name from tho Bible
when the old wife’s back was turned.
A year went past, and another. There were
calls from the firing-line;
They heard the boy had enlisted, but tho
old man made no sign.
His name must never be mentioned on the
farm by Gundagai
They were Scots of the Eiverina with
ever the kirk hard by.
The boy came home on his "final," and
the town-ship’s bonfire burned.
His mother’s arms were about him, but
the old man’s back was turned.
The daughters begged for pardon till the
old man raised his hand
A Scot of the Eiverina who was hard to
understand.
The boy was killed in Plunders, where
the best and bravest die.
There were tears at the G-rahame home-
stead, and grief in Gundagai;
But the old man ploughed at daybreak
and the old man ploughed till the mirk-
There were furrows of pain in the orchard
while his household went to the kirk.
The hurricane lamp in the rafters dimly
burned;
And the old man died at the table when
the old wife’s back was turned,
Lace down on his bare arms folded he
sank with his wild grey hair
Outspread o’er the open Bible and a
name re-written there.

Seek now thy heart and question which

The deeper Hell of two which offer thee,_
The Hell of War. that honour could not shun,
Or that which goes with duty left undone.
Kell, though it he of fury, fire and pain;
The Hell of War thou suff‘rest not in vain.
The dead shall live hy memory through the
years,
Their resting place hedewed hy Angela tears.
And they that live, returning to their land,
Shal} through the years to come, in honour
stand.
And of the joys of Peace in full partake,
As those who suffered much for duty’s sake.
Hut—they who stayed behind to count the
cost,
To argue ''this is gained" or "that is lost,"
And holding hack, bethought them-of some
gain,
At cost of those who suffered fire and pain,
Shall not in future years in council stand
To legislate the future of their land
Hor still in blissful peace their ways
pursue
Because, while others died, this peace they
knew.
And they shall live forever in that state
Of Hell, whose terrors never shall abate.
Tormented conscience and a tortured mind
That through eternity no peace shall find.
POGE WORDS.(Louie Samuels)
There are four words,the sweetest words
In all of human speech,
More sweet than all the songs of birds,
Or lyric poets teanh.
This life may be a vale of tears,
A sad and dreary thing
Pour words, and trouble disappears
And birds begin to sing. a i ...*
Pour words, and all the roses bloom,
The sun begins to shine;
Pour words, will dissipate the gloom,
And water turn to wine.
Pour words,will hush the maddest row,
And cause you hot to grieve
Ah, well, here goes,you’ve got them now!

HIS MATE
There’s .a broken battered village .
Somewhere up behind the line,
There’s a dug-out and a bunk, there,
That I used to say were mine..
I remember how I reached them,
Dripping wet and all forlorn,
In the dim and.dreary twilight
Of a weeping summer morn.
All that Week I’d burled brothers,
In one bitter battle slain,
In one grave I laid two hundred,
God: 'what sorrow and what rain:. .
And that night I’d been in trenches,
Seeking out the sodden dead,
And just dropping them in shell-holes,
With a service swiftly said,
Por the bullets rattled round me,
But I couldn't leave them there,
Water-soaked in flooded shell-holes
Reft of common Christian prayer.
So I crawled round on my belly,
And I listened t.o the roar
Of the guns - that hammered Thiepval,
Like big breakers on the shore.
Then there spoke a dripping sergeant,
when the time was growing late,
"Would you please to bury this one,
’Cause ’e used to be my mate?"
So we groped our way in darkness
To a body lying there,
Just a blacker lump of blacfciess,
With a red blotch on his hair.
though we turned him gently over,
Yet I still can hear the thud,
As the body fell face forward,
And then settled in the mud, .
We went down upon our faces,
And I said the' service through,
Prom "I am the Resurrection"
To the last, the. great 11 adieu I ’.
11 1 hope the newt war is fought .with
the hight ..spirit , !,i ' . t
**lt will be if the- hum -issue’s not

. ‘ HI 3 MATE. (Cant) .
V/e stood up to give thc : Blessing,
And Commend him to the Lord
when a sudden light shot soaring
Silver swift and like a sword..
At a stroke it slew tho darkness,
Plashed its glory on the mud.
' • And I saw the sergeant staring
At a crimson clot of blood.
There are many kinds of sorrow
In this world of Love and Hate,
But there is no sterner sorrow
Than a soldier ! s for his Mate.
PRATER BEFORE Ah' ATTACK
It ain’t as I ’opes ’E’ll keep me safe
While the, other blokes goer down,
It ain’t.as I wants to leave this .world
And wear an ’era’s crown.
It ain’t for that as I says my prayers-
■ Then I goes to the attack,, .V ■
But I pray that whatever comas my‘way
I may never turn me hack.
I leaves the matter o’ life and death,
To the Bather who knows wheat’s best.,
And I prays that L still may play the-man'
whether I turrs east or west.
I’d sooner that it were east, ye know,'-
To Blighty and my gal Sue:
I'd sooner be there, wi f the gold in ’er’air
And the skies be’ind all blue,
But still I pray I may do my bit.
And then, if I must turn west,
I’ll be unashamed when my name is named,
And I'll find a Soldier's rest.
ON THE FIELD DP HONOUR.

Hide your deep pain, and proudly lift your

Put my tunic underneath 'im,
'Ow's that, chummy? That's the tack:
Guess we’d better make a start now,
Beady for another spell?
Best be goin', we won't 'urt ye,
But 'e might just start to shell*
Are ye right, mate? Off we goes then.
That's well over on the right ;
Gawd Almighty, that's a near 'un:
'Old your end up good and tight,
Never mind, lad, you're for Blighty,
Mind this rotten bit o' board.
We'll soon 'ave ye tucked in bed, lad,
'Opes ye gets to my old ward.
No more war for you, my 'earty,
This'll got ye well away.
Twelve good months in dear old Blighty,
Twelve good month! if you're a day,
M.O.'s got a bit o' something
What'll stop that blarsted pain,
'Ere's a rotten bit o' ground, mate,
Lift up 'igher up again,
Wish 'o'd stop 'is blarsted shellin'
Makes it rotten for the lad.
When a feller's been and got it,
It affee's 'im twice as bad.
'Ow's it goin' now then, sonny?
'Ere's that narrow bit o' trench,
Careful, mate, there's some dead Jerries.
Gawd Almighty, what a stench:
'Ere we are now, stretcher-case, boys,
Bring 'im aht a cup o' tea:
Inasmuch as ye have done it
Ye have done it unto Me.

"I’m going to join the Colours, _ Dad;. I A...A

"But you’re only a boy, Young fellow My Lad;
You aren’t"obliged.to go,"
"I’m seventeen and a quarter, Dad,
And ever so strong, you know," :
"So you're off to franco, Young follow. My Lad,
And you’re looking so fit and bright,";.

And I’m awfully proud *to go."
"Why don’t you write, Young Fellow I/y Lad?
I watch for the-post each day;
And 1 mi as you so, and I’m awfully sad,
And it’s months since you went away*
And I’ve had a fire in the parlour lit,

Till my toy comes home; and here 1 1 sit
Into the quiet night",
"What is the matter Young Fellow My Lad?
Wo letter again today,
Why did' the, postman look so sad,
And sigh as he turned away?
I hear them tell that we’ve gained new ground,
but a terrible price we’ve paid:
God grant, ny boy-, that■ you’re safe and sound;
but Oh I’m afraid, afraid,"
"They’ve toll me the truth,. Young Fellow My Lad:
You’ll never come back again,
(di God] the dreams and the dreams I’ve had,
And the hopes I've nursed in vain])
For you passed in the night 1 , Young Fellow Mg Lad,
.and you proved in the cruel test
Of the screaming shell and the. battle hell
That ny boy was one of the best,"
"So you’ll live, you’ll live, Young Fellow My Lad,
In the gleam of the evening spar,
In the wood note wild .and the laugh of the child,
In all sweet things that are, ;
And you’ll never die my wonderful boy,
while life is noble- and true;
For all our beauty and hope .and Joy
We will owe to' our' lads like you."

i EACH, DLESSED iEACE. (Edward Dyson)
Here in the flamin’ thick of things,
With Death across the way, ’n’ traps
What little Eritz the German flings
Explodin’ in yer lunch per’aps,
It ain’t all glory for a bloke,
It ain’t all corfee ’ot and stoo,
Hor wavin’ banners in the smoke,
Or practisin’ the-bay’net stroke
We has our little troubles, too,’
Here’s Trigger Hibb bin seein’ red
’N 1 raisin’ Cain because he had
Hack in the caverns in his ’ead,
A ’oiler tooth run ravin’ mad.
Pore Trigger up ’n» down the trench
Was jiggin’ like a blithered loon,
’N* every time she give a wrench
You orter seen the beggar blench,
You orter ’card him play a tooii.
The sullen shells 'was pawin’ blind,
A-feelin’ for us grim as sin,
While now ’n’ then we’d likely find
A dizzy bomb come limpin’ in,
hut Trigger simply let ’er sizz.
He ’ardly begged to be excused.
This was no damn concern of his.
He twined a muffler round" his phiz,
’H’ fearful was the words he used.
Lest we be gettin’ cock—a—whoop
Ole ’Ans tries out his box of tricks.
His bullets all around the coop
Is peckin’ like a million chicks,
Put Trigger when they barks his snout
Don’t sniff at it. He won’t confess
■They’re on the earth—ignores the clout,
’N’ makes the same old song about
His brimrain’ mug of bitterness.
They raided us there in the mud
One day afore the dead sun rose.
Me oath, the mess of stuff and blood
Would- give a slaughterman the joes I
And when the scrap is past and done,
Where’s Trigger Hibb? The noble youth
Has got his bay’net in a Hun,
While down his cheeks the salt tears run.
Sez he to me; "Gorbli’—-this toothl"
(Cent.)
A shell hoist Trigger in a tree.
We found him mfctherin’ jis jor,
"if this ache’s goin’ on," sez he,
"So ’elp me, it’ll spoil the warj" :
live collared Trigger on his perch,
They wired his molar to a bough, '■ .
Then give the anguished one a lurch,
’N’ down he pitches. Prom that birch
Eis riddled tooth is hangin’ now.
This afternoon it’s merry »ell;
Grenades is conin’ by. the peck;
A big gun times us true ’n’ well,
And, oh] we gets it in the neck.
They lick out flames what reach a mile,
The drip of lead will never cease,

He sports .a fond ’n’ foolish smile—

mud and DUST. (H.Bekhoff)
An Aussie tramped the muddy road,
’Mid snow and rain and sleet,
The rain was running down his back,
And oozing from his feet.
He carried sack and rifle
And ammunition, too.
He wore his helmet "at alert"
As all good Aussies^do.
With rations in a haversack
And tucker sodden through,
He used some dinkum lingo,
As all good Ahssies do.
At last he turned a corner, :
Saw a notice on a tree,
And waded to his neck in mud ;
To see what it could be,
■;
I cannot now remember
Exactly what it said,
It didn’t seem to please him,
Eor this is how it read:
As on you plod your weary way,
Consider our desire,
For if you kick up too much dust,
You’ll draw artillery fire.


THE WOUND.
(Harold Han sell) .
There’s Voices on the river and the
mountain,
There’s Voices out across the dreary
plain,
That’s mostly callin’ when a chap aint
heedin’.
But sometimes if you list eft they
remain,
And that is why I sit beside the river
ns it slowly winds it’s way towards
the sea,
Nor its dreamy Voice is ever calling
■ callin’,
And this is what the river sez to me:
She come from 11 over West, 11 near Black
Swan diver,
And she 11 stool beside 11 when things were-
anyhowl
A little Nurse, with Irinks to socthd
yer liver,
And Lord! her hands were coolin’ on
yer b^ow,
The music of her footsteps was beguilin’,
She had Mercy for the very boards she
trod,
When she kissed 'em, Diggers 11 go in’
VTest 11 went smilin’,
To speak her name before the Throne
O’ God'. ?
I might have 11 spoken. 11 ever there in
"Blighty, ll^
But pals were 11 going West, 11 .most every ,
da *'’ /
So I merely said:—' vVeliJ So iongj
Little Sister,
I’ll call in at your farm in W, i, !l
And she looked at me with eyes a kind
o’, misty, .
Just give a little sigh and clasped
. hand,
And I got work again across the
channel,
Transferrin’ Bosch’s to the Better Land.
’ Twas four years later that I struck the
Homestead,
And G-odi the good old '’Aussie' 1 sun shone
great,
As hidden by the bushes at the roadside,
I watched her standin ‘ there beside the gate,
With Sunshine, hove, and Happiness about her,
And ''Hone, 11 all round the tidy little farm,
Withy her hush end-—lucky Digger—close beside
her,
And a laughin 1 . cromn 1 baby on her arm.
And this is why • one 11 Digger 1 ’ ever wanders .
From the city to the Dush,across the plain,
dor I know her answer, —had I only l! spoken,' l
And the Wound that I think healed, bursts
out again,
And the diver with its Voice is callin’,
callin’,
Woile I listen to its quiet sympatly,
-Is it winds amid the blue—gums and the
wattles,
And this is what the river sez to me;
She come from ''over West,” near Black
Swan diver ,^
And she 1 stood beside 11 , when tilings were
anyhow 1

A little Nurse, with drinks to soothe yer

I OPT GO OUT AT NIGHT-TIME.
(Patrick Macgill)
I oft go out at night-time
When all the sky’s a—flare
And little lights of battle
Are dancing in the air.
I use my pick and shovel
To dig a little hole,
And there I sit till morning—
A listening—patrol,
A silly little sickle
Of moon is hung above;
Within a pond beside me
The frogs are making love;
I see the German sap-head;
A cow is lying there,
Its belly like a barrel,
Its legs are in the air.
The big guns rip like thunder,
The bullets whizz o'erhead,
But o'er the sea in England
Good people lie abed.
And over there in England
May every honest soul
Sleep sound while we sit watching
On listening patrol,
THE TOMMY’S LAMENT.
I fancy it’s not ’arf ny chance
To go on plodding ’neath my pack,
Parading like a snail through Prance,
My house upon iry bloomin’ back.
My wants are few, but what I need
Ain’t not so much of bully stew,
Nor biscuits, that’s a mongrel’s feed,
But, matey, just ’twixt me and you—
When winks the early evening star,
And shadows o’er the trenches come—
I wish the sergeants brought a jar,
And issued double tots of rum.
BEPOBE TEE CHARGE.
The night is still and the air is keen,
Tense with menace the time crawls by,
In front is the town and its homos are seen,
Blurred in outline against the sky".
The dead leaves float in the sighing air,
The darkness-'moves like a curtain drawn,
A veil which the morning sun will tear
Prom the face of death,—We charge at dawn,

A ’and grenade or mortar as it leaves

You can see an* ’ear it cornin’, so you
simply steps aside.
The aeroplane above you may go droppin 1
bombs a bit,
But lyin’ in your dug-out you’re unlucky
if you’re ’it.
W*en the breezes fills your trenches

you’ll drill the beggar clean.
W’en man and 'oss is chargin’ you, upon

An' catch the 'oss's breastbone with
an ijich of two of steel.
It’s sure to end its canter, ah’ as the

The rider pitches forward an* you catch
'in as 'e drops.
It’s w’en ? e sees 'is danger, an’ 'e
knows 'is way about
That a bloke is damned unlucky if 4’s
knocked completely out.
But out on Active Service there'are
dangers everywehere,
The shrapnel shell and bullet that comes
on you -unaware, maid,
The saucy little rifle is a perky” little
An' w’en you've got ’er message you ’ave

LETTERS.
(Patrick Macgill)
When stand-to hour is over we leave
the parapet,
Arl scamper to our dug-out to smoke
a cigarette;
The post has brought in parcels and
letters for us all,
And now we'll light a candle, a little
penny candle,
A tiny tallow candle, and stick it
to the wall.
Dark shadows cringe and cower on
roof and wall and floor,
And little roving breezes come
rustling through the door;
Wo open up the letters of friends
across the foam,
And thoughts go back to London, again
we dream of London
We see the lights of London, of
London and of home,
We've parcels small and parcels of a
quite gigantic size,
We've Devon cream and butter and
apples baked in pies,
We’ll make a night of feasting and
all will have their fill—
See, cot-mate Bill has dainties,
such dandy, dinky dainties,
She’s one to choose the dainties, the
maid that’s gone on Bill.
Oh! Kensington for neatness; it packs
its parcels well,
Though Bow is always bulky it isn't
quite as swell,
But here there’s no distinction ’twixt
Kensington and Bow,
We’re comrades in the dug-out, all
equals in the dug-out,
We’re comrades in the dug-out and
fight a common foe. (Cont).
LETTERS ■ (Cent),
Here comes the ration party- with tins
of bully stew—
-11 Clear off your ration party, we have
no need of you.:
"Maconachie for breakfast? It ain’t no
bloomin’ use,
We’re faring far, far better, our gifts
from home are better.
Look here, we’ve something better than
bully after Loos,"
The post comes trenchward nightly; we
hail the post with glee,
Though now we’re not as many as once
we used to be,
For some have done their fighting,
packed up and gone awav,
And many boys are sleeping, no sound
will break their sleeping,
Brave lusty comrades sleeping in
little homes of clay.
We all have read our letters, but one’s
untouched so far,
An English maiden’s letter to her
sweetheart at the War,
And when we write in answer to tell her
how he fell,
What can we say to cheer her? Oh, what
is now to cheer her?
There’s nothing left to cheer her
except the news to tell.
We’ll write to her to-morrow and this
is what we’ll say.
He breathed her name in dying; in peace
he passed away
Ho ’words about his moaning, his anguish
and Ms pain,
'Then slowly, slowly dying. G-od! "Fifteen
hours in dying!
He lay a maimed thing dying, alone upon
the plain.
We often write to mothers, to sweethearts
and bo wives,
And tell how those who loved them have
given up their lives;
If we’re not always truthful, our lies
are always kind,
Our letters lie to cheer them, to solace
and to cheer them,
Oh: anything to cheer them, the women
left behind.


KITCHENER OP KHARTUM.
(m,W. Carman)
To such as in the Newspapers or/ "
elsewhere have blamed him.
You who fought fear since you had •
him to lead
In the cold anguish of your first distress,
And took the labour of his life t-> make
A bulwark for your years of idleness;
Clung to his name, sheltered behind
his strength,
How dare you judge him failure or success?
You who were each an Empire went your ways,
Shuddered at death and laughed at thought
■ of war,
And when it came, knew nothing; called
to him
To keep the Terror from your flimsy door;
You who had tied his Hands through
strength withheld.
And knowledge flouted, years and
years before.
You you took all he gave; ho who took up
Burden of Empire-that was yours to bear,
And walked through hells you’ll never
know to find
The hard—won wisdom of a soldier there;
And went out into' silence on the sea,
And left his memory to your keeping
here.
You
You that are each this England, you who live
As England lives, by such great travailing,
Have you at this high hour no better gift
Than your safe smug disparagement can bring?.
He that died, died for England; England lives
And you are England; that’s the bitter thing,
’AFTER THE JAR ’
After the war perhaps I’ll sit again
Out on the tarrace where I sat with you,
And see the changeless sky and hills beat blue
Aid live an afternoon of summer through.
I shall remember then, and sad at heart
Por the lost day of happiness we knew,
Wish only that some other man were you
And spoke ray. name as once you used to do.

LIGHT HORSE)
(Trooper Cerardy)
Though f days were bloody and dread nights
were' long • '
On mountain treks beyond the Jordan Valley,
The skylark’s joyous burst of morning—song
Was ever your reveille.
Now crimson poppies nod beside the road
You followed, when Damascus was a treasure;
Before you cast aside your shoulder-load
Por days of life and leisure,
• ••••!«
Your tracks through Sinai are overblown,
And scars of strife in Palestine are
hidden;
In Lebanon the grass has overgrown
The magic miles you’ve ridden.
PREMONITION
(Robert S. Lasker)
11 If I should fall, do not grieve for me.
I shall be one with the sun and the wind
and the flowers. 11 (Leslie Coulson),
If I should fall, ray presence may be
'Sought
In all the teeming beauty of the earth.
With every lovely thing that Cod has
wrought
I shall be one, and find it it new birth.
Therefore, within the shadow of the-wind
Upon green meadows, or in April grass
And flowers, who wills ray presence
still might find.
, Which shall inhabit these until
Time pass.
Seek in the gold and purple of the west,
Seek in the sunshine of a summer’s day,
Seek in the ocean’s silence and unrest
If you would find me; and, while seeking,
say:
11 Hq loved all these he loved all
lovely things;
And from them now his living spirit
sings.’ 1


THE. DBSTHOYBR. .
(Will Lawson)
She raced away down the sunset track,
Beyond the nines and the boon;
The spray flashed red on her turtle-back
To the v/hirr of her engine room.
Her funnels spouted their smoke—plumes black—
She looked the Spirit of Doom,
Along her'Sides the. wavelets hissed,
As she opened out her speed,
They fell astern to snarl and twist,
And writhe in her wake and bleed.
Hers was a force no a:as resist,
.And she gave them little hoed.
Away in the west the red sun sunk
To drown in the heaving flood;
And,fast with never a noisy crank
Or piston rod a-thud,
Her stern set low in the high wave—bank—
She swam on a sea of.blood.
Into the night, when the sun had gone,
The fast destroyer flew,
And never a side-light gleamed or shone,
As the pale stars grew and grew.
What errand grim dii she speed upon?
Only her captain knew.
Through the sweeping seas she clove a track
Into the blinding gloom-
Stumpy-funnelled, sinister, black—
She was the Spirit of Doom,
And the keen spray hailed on her turtle—back,
To the throb of her engine-room.
Back to our forts the destroyer crept,
As the. dawn rushed in aflame;
Her stacks were blistered, her decks sea-swept,
But she licked her lips as she cane;
And she took her place where her comrades slept,
Like a hound that had killed its‘game.


MISSING BELIEVED KILLED
(OH BEADING A MOTHER'S LETTER)
'Twere heaven enough to fill my heart
If only one would stay,
Just one of all the million joys
God gives to take away.
* «•
If I could keep one golden dawn..
The splendour of one star,
One silver glint of yon bird's wing
That flashes from afar;
If I could keep the leant of things
That make me catch my breath
To gasp with wonder at God's world
And hold it back from death,
It were enough; but death forbids.
The sunset flames to fade,
The velvet petals of this rose
Pall withered —brown—'decayed.
She only asked to keep one thing,
The joy-light in his eyes:
God has not even let her know
Where his dead body lies.
0 Grave, where is thy victory?
0 Death, where is thy sting?
Thy victory is ev’rywhere,
Thy sting’s in ev'rything.

There’s a Jerry over there, Sarge:
Can't you see ’is big square ’ead?

And just fix that blinkin’ sight.

THE SECRET
Yon were askin’ ’ow we sticks it,
Sticks this blarsted rain and mud,
’ow it is we keeps on smilin’
when the place runs red wi’ blood*
Since you’re askin’, I can tell ye,
And I thinks I tells ye true.
But it ain’t official, mind ye.
It's a tip ’twixt me and you,
Eor the General thinks it’s tactics,
And the bloomin’ plans ’e makes:
And the C,O, thinks it’s trainin’.
And the trouble as he takes,
Sargint-Major says it’s drillin’,
Aiid ’is st raf fin’ on parade;
Doctor swears it’s sanitation.
And some patent stinks ’e's made.
Padre tells us it’s religion.
And the spirit of the Lord;
But I ain’t got much religion,
And I sticks it still, hy Gawd.
Quarters kids us it’s the rations,
And the dinners as we gets:
But I know what keeps us smilin’.
It’s the Woodbine Cigarettes.
Por the daytime seems more dreary,
And the night-time seems to drag
To eternity of darkness,
when ye ’aven't got a fag.
Then the rain seems some’ow wetter.
And the cold cuts twice as keen,
And ye keeps on seein’ Bodies,
What the Sargint ’asn’t seen.
If ole Pritz ’as been and got ye,
And ye ’ave to stick the pain,
If ye ’aven’t got a fag on,
Why, it ’-arts as bad again.
When there ain’t no fags to pull at,
Then there's terror in the ranks.
That’s the secret -(yes,l'll 'ave one)
Just a fag and many Tanks.
"The officers dine in most glorious state
On viands that are costly and rare,
The sergeants feed from a white china plate
And of dainties they too get tlieir share,
The Diggers get duff—at least new and then
And are healthy ! tis plain to be seen, -
But all ranks agree,they hope ne'er again
To gaze on a Haricot Bean."

GALLIPOLI
Upon the margin of a rugged shore
There is a spot now barren, desolate,
A place of graves, sodden with human gore
That Time will hallow, Memory consecrate.
There lie the ashes of the mighty dead,
The youth who lit with flsmo Obscurity,
Fought true for Freedom, won through rain
of lead
Undying fame, their immortality. over,
The stranger wand’ring when the war is
The ploughman there driving his coulter
deep,
The husbandmen who golden harvests reap—
From hill and ravine, from each plain and
f cover.
Will hear a shout,see phantoms on the marge,
See me again making ,a deathless charge.

Then five-and-fifty pairs of heels
Together smartly click,
’Mid murmurs from admiring throngs
n l*hew: Section ITive is slick; !f
Fall in upon your N. 0.0.”,
The order is obeyed.
(Be not Binned, though fallen on
He never needs First Aide)
But he, good mar., whoe’er ho be,
Assigns us each a task,.
And some get light and easy jobs.
Others—-more than they ask*
Six men in deep humility.
Before I tis seven o’clock,
Go down on hands and, knees to scrub
The ’Administrative Block:
For seven successive morns they writhe
In anguish sore to sea.
But on the eighth each man falls sick
With chronic Housemaid’s Knee.
A score of men are marched ’’two deep”
T ewards the Comp ’ny ’ s me so,
And what they find awaiting there
Appals them, I confess,
For while the bitter wintry air
Coagulates their blood,
They peel the epidermis
From the soil-beladen "spud.”
But five and fif£y hungry lads
Complete their basks at length,
And swiftly glide to breakfast
To recover wasted strength.
Their bully beef and bacon
They attack with frantic glee,
Or stab the sulky ’’submarine.”
And wash it down with tea.
Many a wife in days, to come.
When strife at length is o’er.
Complacently will sit and watch
Her hubby scrub the floor.
And as.he slices carrots
And removes potato eyes.
She'll murmur, "War is, after all,
A blessing in disguise.”


THE PENSIONER
f lm and me was kids together,
Flayed together, went to school,
Where Miss Jenkins used to rap us
On our knuckles wiv a rale,
When we left worked together,
At the Fact f ry, mailin' jam,
Gawd ? avc mercy on us women;
I ! m full up today I am,
Well 1 minds the August Monday,
When : e said ’o loved me tnie-
Undcrneath the copper beech tree,
With the moonbeams shining through.
Then we walked down by the river.
Silent-!!ike an 7 and• in ’and,
Till we 'jame there by the Ketch Inn, ■
Vhere them two big willows stand*
There r e caught rac roughly to f iir.,
And ‘is voice was ’oarse and wild,
As *e whispered through ’is kisses,
"Will ye mother me my child?”
An* I took and kissed and kissed ? im,
Sweet as love and long as life,
Mowed while .breath was in my body
I would be 'is faithful wife-
An’ X seemed to see ’is baby.
Smiling as : e lay at rest.
With ’is tiny * and a-clutching
At the softness of my breast.
Gawd above, them days-was ’cavcn
I car. see the river shine
Like a band of silver ribbon:
I can. feel ! is 5 and in mine,
1 can feel them red l ot kisses
On my lips or on my ’air,
I can feel ‘is. arm tight round me,
Gawd; I tell ye it ain’t fair.
Look ye what the war’s done at ’im.
Lying there as still as death.
See : is mouth, all screwed and twisted,
With the pain' of drawing breath:
But of course I l ave a pension,
Coming reg’lar every week.
So I aint’ got much to grouse at—
I suppose it’s* like my cheek.
Grousin’ when a grateful country
Buys my food and pays my rent.
I should be most ’umbly grateful
That my John was one as went.
Went to fight for King and Country,
Like a ’ero and a man,
I should be most 'umbly grateful,
And just do as best 1 can.
But my pension won’t bay kisses,
An ’e * 11. never ki s s again, ,
f E ain't gob no kiss in’ in 1 im,
Aint ? got nothin* now—but pain®
Not as I would ever • change l im
For the strongest mail alive-
while the breath is in my body.
Still mi mother s im—-and strive
That I keeps my face still smiling,
Though my ’eart is fit to break;
As I liyes a married widow*
So I*ll live on for ’is sake.
But I says Let'them as makes ’em
Fight their wars and mourn their dead.
Let their women sleep for ever
In a loveless, childless bed*
No—l know —• it ain’t right talkin' 9
But there ’s times as I am-wild#
Gawd; you dunuo• ow I wants it
’Cw I wants—a child—’is child*
THE SIT HIT.
When there ain't no gal t© kiss you,
And the postman .seems to miss you,
And the fags have missed an issue.
Carry on.
’when' ye’ve got an. empty belly,
And the ’’bruiy's” rotten smelly,

When the Boche has dene your chum in.
And the sargint '• s done the rum in.
And there ain't ho rations coming,

And the shrapnel shells are shrieking,
And your blood is slowly leaking.

From a Christmas Letter.
" I was eatin' Christmas puddin' in the mad,
When a whiz zhang 'it me collar wiv a thud,
An' I honestly expected that me hits 'ud be collected,
But my luck was in-the beggar was a dud.”
"I say, cobber, got 'ny room in
there for me an' another bloke?"
"When we had to thaw our hoots
before we could put them on our
remarks were not pleasant to
hear.”


MEDICAL OFFICER: "Well, my man, what are you bach here for?
DIGGER: "Well Sir, the Sergeant told me to go to
Hell, so I come bach here."

"Court Martial?" said the Potato-Peeler. "It’s something like the Military
Cross spelt backwards. ’Taint quite so greet a honner —and twice as easy
.b. : • to get."
Old Dad is fairly off his head
Out at Bulgandra Flat;
He’s roaming all around the town
In Sunday coat and hat.
He’s had a letter from the Front,
From his young son, Big Ben—
"l’m goin to be C our t-Marti ailed, Dad:
On Saturday at ten, ”
"Great snakes:" cries Dad; "now that
will show
The grit that's in our race;
He’s only been a fortnight there
And yet he’s took his place
Among the mighty of the land.
Ain’t they quick-sighted men?
They’re goin’ to make Court Martial
Of my own son, young Big Ben,
"I knew that Ben would make his nark
When he got to the War:
I guess he took command o’ things
And give the foe ’what for;’
Or else took charge of the canteen,
And wouldn’t quit it when
They gave the order to retreat —
My hero son, Big Ben,
"The parson read the letter,
And he looked quite pleased,you bet:
He said ’Whatever Bon deserved
That same he'd surely get;
And that the sword came, after all,
Quite second to the pen.’
Which brought such comfort to my
heart
From my own son, Big Ben,
' (Cont.)
There is an old Trooper called Durham,
Whose pace is like that of a wor—urn,
But the day is in sight
When we’ll enter the Bight,
Then to hell with the ship and the
fir—-im."
"I guess he'll chun tip with ’The Hobs,’
And shake hands with the King—-
Perhap’s he'll have to stay to lunch
And then he asked to sing;
And if he is, By Holy Smokes
They will hear something when - . -
He* s had. a glass of beer or two—
My only son. Big Ben,
"When Ben comes to Bulgandra Flat,
With all the foe passed out,
The Concertinas will tune up,
The Band of Hope will shout:
•All Ale; All Ale: Court Martial::: 1

He-comes hack to Bulgandra Flat
My hero son, Big Ben.”
THE JESTED IN TSS. THSITCH.
(Leon G-ellert)
That just reminds me of a yarn;
And everybody turned to hear his tale.
He had a thousand yarns inside his head..
They waited for him, ready with their
mirth
And creeping smiles, then suddenly
turned pale,
Grew still, and gazed upon the earth.
They heard no tale. Ho further word
was said.
And with his untold fun,
Half leaning on his gun,
They left him dead.
During the freeze in France in 1916,a
Tomrry officer slipped on the duckboards.
He got up, turned to a grinning Aussie,
and exclaimed, n I suppose that is what
you Australians^would call a gutzah?"
"ify —oath, that was a —snifter,”
said the Aussie,


THE JESTER IN THE TRENCH.
(Leon G-ellert)
’That reminds me of a yam,’ he said;
And everybody turned to hear his tale.
He had a'thousand yams inside his head.
They waited for him* ready with their mirth
And creeping smiles, —then suddenly
■ tunned pale,
Crew still, and gazed upon the earth.
They heard no tale. No further word
was said.
And with his untold fun, ;
Half leaning on his gun,
They left him dead. '
THE CROSS. (Leon Cellert)
•II
•wear a cross of bronze,* he said,
*And men have told me I was brave.’
He turned his head,
And, pointing.to a grave,
’They told me that ny work of war was done.’
His fierce mouth set.
! And yet, and yet ?
He trembled where he stood.
’And yet, and yet
I have not won
That broken cross of wood!’
THE CHIPPIE. (Leon Cellert)
He totters round and dangles those
odd shapes
That were his legs. His eyes are never dim.
He brags about his fame between the tapes,
And laughs the loudest when they laugh at
him.
Amid the fights of snow he takes a hand;
Accepts his small defeats, and with a smile.
He rises from the ground, and makes his stand
With clumsiness, but battles hard the while.
So quick to see the pain in fellow men,
He chides them;yea, —and laughs them into
youth;
And yet, when death was near to one, ■
’twas then
About his kindly heart we leamt the truth.
Since nowadays of cheer there is dearth,
’Twas smiles or tears, and.sc he chose the
p mirth.
A ITIGIIT ATTACH. (Leon Gellert)
Be still. The bleeding night is in t'
suspense
Of watchful agony and coloured though]
And every beating vein and trembling
: sense,
Long tired with time, is pitched and
. overwrought.
And for the eye, the darkness holds
strange forms.
Soft movements in the leaves, and
wicked glows
That wait and peer. The whole black
landscape swarms
With shapes of white and grey that no
one knows;
And for the ear, a round, a pause,
a breath,
A distant hurried footstep moving fasl
The hand has touched the sliny face o:
death.
The mine*, is raking at the ragged past,
....... A sound of rifles rattles
from the south,
And startled orders move from mouth
to mouth s
THE ATTACK AT DAWN. (Leon Gellerj
’At every cost, 5 they said,’it must,
be done. *
They told us in the early afternoon.
We sit and wait the coming of the sun.
Wg sit in groups,—grey groups that
watch the moon.
We stretch our legs and murmur half in
sleep,
And touch the tips of bayonets and yavs
Our hands are cold. They strangely grot
and creep,
Tugging at ends of straps.We wait the
dawn.
Some men come stumbling past in single
file,
And scrape the trenches side and scatte
sand*
They trip and curse and go. Perhaps we
smile.
We wait the dawn:,...The dawn is close
at hand. (P.T.0.)


THE ATTACK AT DAWN. (Cont).
A gentle rustling runs along the line.
’At every cost.’ they said, ’lt must
be done,’ :
A hundred eyes are staring for the sign.
It’s, coming; 100k;....0ur God’s own
laughing sun;
THE DEATH (lean Gellert)
I’m hit. It’s come at last. I feel
■ a smart
Of needles in...My G0d.,..1’m hit again;
No pain this time...,no pain..and yet...
■- my heart......
Where is ny heart? ’Tis strange I feel
no pain.
The night is still, the night is •.
very still.
I feel the April rain upon my hair,
I see the lights upon the yonder hill
Agleam and shining..in the silent air,
Gow soft the grasses seem how soft
and cool;
How long the valley looks her long
: and deep?
How warm the rain; I feel a little pool
Beside ny hand. I feel..... Can this

Can this be sleep.;.. .this buzzing in

THE THOUSANDTH MAN.
( Rudyard Kipling,)
One man in a thousand, Solomon says,
Will stick more close than a brother,
ibid it’s worth while seeking him half
your days
If you find him before the other.
Dine hundred and ninety-nine depend
On what the world sees in you,
But the Thousandth Man wi 11 stand your
friend
With the whole round world agin "you,
’Tis neither-promise nor prayer nor show
Will settle the finding for ’ee.
Dine hundred and ninety-nine of ’em go
By your looks or your acts or your glory.

THE RETURN,
(Patrick Maggill.)
There’s a tramp 0’ feet in the mc-min’,
There’s an. oath from an N.C.0.,
As up the road to the trenches
The brown battalions go:
Guns and rifles and wagons,
Transports and horses and men,
Up with the flush of the dawnin’,
And back with the night again.
Back again from the bar tie,
Prom the mates we’ve left behind,
And our officers are gloomy
And the IT, G. 0, ! s are kind;'
V/hen a Jew’s harp breaks the silence,
Purring an old refrain,
Singing the song of the soldier,
11 Here we are again; ll
Here we are:
Here we are;
Oh; here we are again:
Some have gone west,
Best of the best,
lying out in the rain,
Stiff as stones in the open,
Out of the doings for good.
They’ll never come back to advance or
attack;
But, God; don’t we wish that they could:
THE PLY.
(Patrick Maggill.)
Buzz-fly and gad-fly, dragon-fly and blue,
Uhen you*re in the trenches come and visit
you,
They 'revel in your butter-dish and hiot on
your ham,
Drill upon the army cheese and loot-the
; . arny jam.
They’re with you in the dusk and the
dawning and the noon,
They come in close formation, in column
and platoon.
There’s never zest like Tommy’s zest when
these have got to die:
Por Tommy,takes his puttees off and strafs
the blooming fly,
STRAP’ THAT PLY,
(Patrick Maggill.)
(Bui ]y- -G-renay,)
There’s the butter, gad, and horse-fly,
The blow-fly and the blue,
The fine fly and the course fly.
But never flew a worse fly
Of all the.flies that flew
Than the little sneaky black fly
That gobbles up our ham,
The beggar’s not a slack fly,
He really is a crack fly,
And wolfs the soldiers’ jam.
So strJT ’ that fly; our motto
Is ’’Straf ’ him when you can, 11
He’ll die because he ought to,
He’ll go because he's got to,
So at him, every man;


RECESSIONAL .(Eudyard -Kipling)
God of our fathers, known of old.
Lord of our- far-flung battle line.
Beneath whose awful Hand we hold
Dominion over-.palm end pine—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget:
The tumult and the shouting dies;
The captains and the kings depart:
Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,
An humble and a contrite heart.
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet.
Lest we forget—lest we forget:
Ear-called, our navies melt away;
On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Lo, all our prmp of yes&erday
Is one with Nineveh and Tyre*.
Judge of the Nations,• spare us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget.
If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,
Such boastings, as the Gentiles use,
Or lesser breeds without the Law—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget lest we forget:
For heathen heart that puts her trust
In reeking tube and iron shard,
All valiant dust that builds on dust,
And guarding, calls not Thee to guard,
For frantic boast and foolish word —
Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord:
Amen.
BEFORE ACTION. (Leon Gellert) -
We always had to do cur work at night,
I wondered why we had to oe so sly.
I wondered why we couln’t have our fight
Under the open sky.
I wondered wby I always felt so cold.
I wondered why the orders seemed so slow,
So slow to come, so whisperingly told,
So whisperingly low.
I wondered if my packing-straps were tight,
And wondered why I wondered ...Sound
went wild
An order came,,,.l ran into the night,
Wondering why I smiled.
THE BURIAL. (Leon C-ellert)
Vilhat task is this that so -unnerves ne noi
When pity should, be dead,and has been del
Unloose that sheet from round the piercei
brow;
What matter blood is seen,for blood is re
And red’s the colour of the clammy- earth,
Be not so solemn, There’s no need to p]
But rather smile, —yea,laugh;lf pure,thy
mirth
Is right .He laughed himself but yesterday
That pay—book? Take it from him,Ours a if
No gold can ever pay. That cross of wood
About his neck? That must remain, and yet
He needs it not, because his heart was gj
We’ll house him 'neath these broken shri
dig deep.
He’s tired, God knows, and needs a little
sleep.
THE DIGGERS. (Leon Gellert)
The diggers are digging,and digging deep
They’re digging and singing,
And I’m asleep.
They’re digging and singing, and swiftly
they’re swinging
The flying earth as it falls in a heap.
And some of it scatters and falls on ny
head;
But the diggers dig on. They can only di
They can only sing, and their eyes are 1
Their eyes are big and heavy as lead.
They dig and they sing and they think
I’m dead.
The diggers are digging,and.filling the
hole.
They’re sighing and sighing,
; They pray for my soul.
I hear what they say, and from where I.
am lying.
I hear a new corporal calling the roll*
But the diggers dig on and fill in W t
The diggers dig on, and they sweat -and
they sweat.
They sigh and they sigh,and tbeir eyes
are.wet.
The brown earth clatters and covers W
'head;
Then I laugh and I laugh, for they
I’m dead.

high from the sweep of the cloud
line as the clouds than the cities

trail that is fretted with fire: __
Unseen from the groynes s he low us, who r
the cannonades challenge and roar, f gp?-?. hr?
Wo ride on the the stream of the sunli
on the breast of the cloud-wrack we soar,
Through the folds of the fog in the lower,
through the glare of the uppermost spaces, %
We drive with the blindness about us and itogg/jl
buffeting wind on our faces. & (
The stave that the singing propeller,
the wind in the wires is humming, />
Chants death to the junctions below us, the fe
camp that lies dark to our coming,
The threat that we bring shall you wake to,
the doom of your fattest |
With the beat of our engines’ approaching,
the slant of the silk in our pinions
fate’s falcons that watch where you^cower,
down-swooping, reversing and checking—
The eyes of the army for seeing, the beaks
of the army far packing: • •
far down on the white of the roadways, the
green of the meadowland grasses,
A serpent winds laboring onward—the brown
of the column that passes:
A thrust on the piloting-handle, the rush
that descends, and decreases,
The joy of the hawk o’er the quarry, the
dick of the bomb that releases,
Your vapor—balls ringing me harmless, my
answering gunner’s derision,
Burst limbers and screaming of horses, the
shreds of the shattered division,
p orn fragments that cumber the roadway, rune
panic unloosed and unknowing,
Blind fear that goes hotfoot for safety, nor
stands on its order of going.
Swift spies of your camouflaged cannon, your
bough— woven screens that dissemble,
keen hunters we haunt your reserve-lines, your
convoys and troups that assemble.
Small respite or rest, shall grant you,
poor leisure for ruing or recking-
The eyes of the army for seeing, the beaks
of the army for pecking.
A speck on the ri-m of the ether, a mote
on the distant blue showing,
A formlessness merging and forming, a
shapelessness shaping and growing;
Drag back on the lever;Short mercy on
him who shall dally delaying,
Scant shrift to the one who waits under
while the foemen may stoop to the
slaying;
The palm unto him who shall bear it
the race to the speediest runner,
fate compass the course lest they ram us
G-od steady the gun and the gunner;
G-one past; And a bare yard between us?
Cross-fire that still rattles and
dwindles?
Hard down to the right, lest we lose him
where his rocking plane circles and
spindles;
A shot through the tank —arid to earthward,
in smoke and smother of fire,
G-oes reeling a crumple of fabric, a
tangle of metal and wire;
Winged prophets are we of disaster, rod
"bringers of ruin and wrecking—
The eyes of the army for seeing, the
beaks of the army for pecking.


Right as ninepence, thank ye kindly,
There are umpty worse than me,

If my bloomin' eyes could see.
But they can’t, sir, that’s the noosance,
I’m as blind as forty bats,
And I’’as to work by feel, sir,
Like ye does at night for chat§,

On a bloomin’ night patrol.
When I got a blinkin ’ whizzbang
To myself and got it whole.
Yes. the last thing as I seed, sir,
Were a burst of silver light,
And it went and left the darkness,
’Cause it took away my sight.
There was me and old Bill Drury
And ’e got one through the ‘ead;
We tried : urd to fotbh ’im back,sir,
But it weren’t no bon — ! e’s dead.

That I still ’ave go* my life.
There are times I wants to see, sir*
Like a beggar wants a meal,
But when I remembers Billie,
Then I ain’t disposed to squeal,
For I’ve got my legs and arms, sir, ..
And these ’ands is willing still,
I can do ray .job of work yet;
I can do it—-and I will.
There’s just one thing I’m afeard on,
Will .they find me work to do?
That’s the thing as makes me worry,
Same as it would worry you.
When this blarsted war is over,
And we settles dahn again
To the makin’ of the money,
Will they still remember then?
Yes, I know they’ve been and promised,
But it’s easy to forget.
When thq shoutin’s done and over,
There’s accounts to settle yet.
There’ll be thousands same as me, sir,
Out to do what work they can,
Not disabled, but like me, sir, -
Not just everybody’s man.
Will they find us jobs to work at
Where two ’ands can earn their pay,
For a wage enough to keep us
Free from debt, and pay our way?
WORRY (Cont.)
That’s the only thing as worries
When I sits me down to think,
Will I get my charnce of ’one, sir,
And enough to eat and drink?
OLD AND new YEARS .
* ' (Fred Johns) .
Gone the old years, sorrow laden,
Bearing with them streams of tears
Shattered hopes for many thousands,
Untold griefs, years filled with fears.
Gone old years with memories
Of the bitterness'of strife,
Of suffering and miseries,
And the infamies of life.
Come the new years, richly laden
With the choicest gifts of heaven,
With peace on earth,goodwill to men, —
Fruits of noble service given.
Come new years with remembrance
Of those who paid tremendous price;
Our resolve’s to prove worthy
Of all"who made their sacrifice,
A MOTHER UNDERSTANDS .
(G.A.Studdart Kennedy).
Dear Lord, I hold my hand to take
Thy body, broken here for me,
. Accept the sacrifice I make,
My body-broken, there, for Thee,
His was my body, bom of me,
Bom of my bitter travail pain,
And it lies broken on the field,
Swept by the wind and : the rain.
Surely-a Mother understands Thy thorn—
■■ crowned head,
The mystery of Thy pierced hands-—-the
Broken Bread.

THE HOME-COMETS
(j% Alex. Allan)
Four summers since, in a waning year,
You marshalled us, eager to save mankind.
Do you recall? Is the vision clear,
The sequence plain in your ordered mind?
Ye have weltered and plodded and dug
and "bled.
Labored, with sweat and our wounds for fee,
That the little lands should he freed
• (you said),
And the world made safe for democracy:
Ze have fought your fight; you have
said your say—
There is a "bill to pay:,
Leader and servant, through "blood and
doubt,
Striving(you told us) should win to ’
light,
.hid the gristing of gladness would
issue out
Prom the mills of the Master that
grind aright.
Gai i we should garner from grief and loss.
Htlp would be near when the poor man cried,
Fire of battle should purge dross,
And the seed of the lowly be jys tilled.
These were your words: If your words
were true,
iThat do you mean to do?
Docile and drilled in the ancient ways,
Lighbly unquestioning, simply true,
ffc have-fought (how we fought;) for a
flag, a phrase.
The seeming of■Eight, and a king or two,
Tou said (you remember) that afterward
The song of the world, in a sweet, new
chime,
Should smother the dissonance evil-starred
That lived in the old, sad, bitter time,
Masters, we grieve if we do you wrong—
But the waiting is overlong:
T7e can tarry awhile, who were ever used
To waiting till hope in the heart grew'
- r sick;
Yet power that is laggard is power abused—
And the clouds in the northern sky hang
thick,
A wine that we knew not has poured,and
passed
To fire in the "blood of the world of men—
A strangeness and newness that waxes fast
For ever will wane or "be stilled again,
•Twere better, perchance, to recall today
The pledges we "bore away.
Was there a meaning upon your tongue
More than the clamor of hawk-scared birds—
Fruit in the tree of your promise hung,
Dawn in the heart of your cloud of words?
There is a lesson that, writ in fire.
The school of our warring and working
showed—
A way to the goal of a man's desire,
A shorter, a sterner, a truer roadr
Head it, an then, for your own sweet:sake.
Cling to your word or break.
Wj3 have walked in the darkness where
Terror lives;
The ranks of our muster are gapped and
thin;
Fling us (we earned it) what honor gives
For the worth of your word and our trust
therein.
There i s never a need for a man to crave
Who has learned of a way that:a man may
take;
Yet pay, for the faith that a day may save,
For your pride and our own, and the
land’s fair sake:
Was it. my masters, "but sham and show
You mouthed, four years ago?.


A SONG OP THE CHRISTMAS HEATHER. •
(R.W.Service)
It isn't the foe that we fear;
--.lt isn't the bullets that- whine;
It isn't the business career
Of a shell, or the burst of a mine;
It isn't the snipers who seek .
To nip our young hopes in the bud.
„.No it isn't the guns,
And it isn't the Huns
Its- the MUD, MUD, MUD.
It isn't the melee we mind
That often is rather good fun.
It isn't the shrapnel we find
Obtrusive when rained by the ton;
..... It isn't the bounce of,the bombs
That .gives us a positive pain;
•It's the strafing we get,
When the weather is wet-
Its the RAIN, RAIN, RAIN'
It isn't because we lack grit ,
We shrink from the horrors of war.
We don't mind the battle a bit;
In"fact, that is what we are for;
It isn't the rum-jars and things
Make us wish we were back in the fold.
Its the fingers that freeze,
In the boreal breeze,
It 's the COLD, COLD, COLD I
Oh, the rain, the mud, and the.cold,
The cold, the mud, and the rain;
With weather at zero, it's hard for
. a kero,
Prom language that's rude to refrain;
With porridgy muck to the knees,
With shy that's a—pouring a flood.
Sure the worst of our foes,
Are the pains and the woes,
Of the RAlN,'the COLD, and the MUD.

PLANNAGAN -1 S HOLL CALL.
(Hichard Morton)
"Sergeant Plannagan call the roll”
The officer said to Pat,.
And in salute the sergeant's hand
Plew upward to his hat;
He called the roll, and counted all
The men he'd got in line,
Then said "There should he forty, sor—
There 1 s only thirty—nine. u
Sergeant Plannagan scratched his head,
And counted all again,
He murmured "Porty can't he made
Prom thirty-nine, that's plain;
One rascal is an absentee,
Some scum not worth his salt!”
"Pind out,” the captain sternly said,
"And tell me who's in fault”..
Sergeant Plannagan in two twos,
All smiling in delight,
Came running to his officer,
"if ye please, sor, it's all right;
There's no one missing, not at all,
And no one breek the rules,
But I forgot to call myself—
It's me and you's the fools I”
GOD'S BUSINESS.
■ - ■■ ■■ - ». ■ .
We ask too much the help of skies
In some unholy enterprise,
And salve our conscience with the thought,
When we have won, that God has wrought.
So we have prayed for aid divine,
Both sides of ev'iy battle—line.
And yet the clash of fighting clans
Is not God's business. War is man's.
I doubt if G-od has ever stood
On bloody ground and thought it good.
If cannon ever made him glad,
Exultant o'er one fallen lad.
No matter which battalions win,
I know G-od thinks that war is sin,
Concerned alone the thing shall cease.
War is man's business. God's is PEACE.


SONG OF TUB PADKSS,
(j. Alex, Allan)
jiy mother 'eld by Greenfield's faith —
. my father 'eld it toO —
in' I bred close to my mother's side, as
a decent bloke should do;
in' Baptist, Greek or Methodist, wowser
or Pharisee,
Scotty or Saint or Plymouth Rock, they
was always one to me;
I 'ave loved the smell of trees an'
grass, the river Elidin' by,
The chatterin’ birds among the leaves,
the streaky sunset sky,
The shine of seas beneath the moon, the
tracks of 'ill an' wood,
in' all of nature's 'andiworks I've
sought an’ found 'em good,
I've took no stock in 'ymns or sects, .
Bibles or bickerin',
For I never leaned to the nosey side,an' ■
I done no buttin' in;
I've riddled the Ten Commandments through,
I've reckoned life a joke,
Yet I think 'B'll see it the same as me,
looking out for the decent bloke.
But what a straight-out 'ead like me can
never figure out,
Is what these 'ot prayer-merchants 'ere
are raisin' Cain about.
They're workin' by the text—book, an' the
text-book's just the sjme,
Wo matter what's their creed or lurk or
Bible-punchin' name.
It's got me rattled there an' back, for
it's most exceedin' odd,
An' I 'ate to,think :'ow the 'ole thing
looks to a God like the swaddles' God;
Oh, our sportin', fightin' Padres, fledged
;from ‘Oxford, 'ere or Rone —
I can 'ear them-goin’ crook about the
.padres back at 'ome;
They’ve f chewed the bully—cud with us,
they've bore the battle's brunt
With Tom an' Dick an' 'Arry,'ave our-
padres at the front.
Oh, they wear no linen overcoa*- with
lily docks to match,
But you'll know 'em by their 'earty grin
an' little shoulder-patch.
They will kid you, p'raps, an' chiack, but
they never rub it in
About the ‘brimstone waitin’ for a bloke
in mortal sin.
They'll sing you 'ymns an' comic songs,
an' now an' then will shove
A fist well 'id (an' just as wells)
inside a boxin' glove,
For a swado don't 'old with prayin',but
I've stacked against a few
That would swing a 'ealthy knuckle for
the padres that we knoo.
They 'ave been with us through mud 'an
dust an' trench an’ trampled wire,
When the ground was spittin' earthquakes
an' the sky was beltin' fire;
They 'ave listened to our tales of 'ome
an’ tarts an' wounds an' grief;
They 'ave dined on ration-fabbit,while
we scoffed their ration-beef;
They 'ave rigged impromptoo concerts,
where they knocked the flamin' soul
From a grand pianner collared from some
German bunny-'ole;
They never flashed the frozen stare, or
gave the icy dock
They was cobber to the colonel an' the
regimental cook.
They was thoroughbreds, though sometimes
short of brush or currycomb—
But I'H bet their ears are burnin’ for
* the padres back 'at 'ome:
I've come from the West to my father's
'ouse, an' I find the landscape thick
With, "You're the son of a Calathump:",
an' "You’re a bloomin' Mick:"
I 'ave struck the row that never dies,
the yap that will not cease,
Which is 'ard, an’ a little more than
'ard, on the broodin' Dove of Peace,
I’m safe at last in my father's 'ouse,
an' my spirit's goin' sore
For ths 'omeiy priests of the creedless
creed I knoo in times before —
The chapel where never an al*ar showed,
that never a pillar decked;
The creed of the church that 'ad no walls,
the sect that 'ad no sect;
.An' I reckon that if there's any creed a
bloke should 'ang to —-well,
It's the one that the padres peddle there
in the livin' Flanders 'ell;
. (Cont,)


SOUG- QEr THE PADRES, (Continued)
If any faith is the only faith, you
can take the ci.l .from me
It’s the dinkum one that the padres

An 5 once or twice to myself I’ve said,
as I’ll say it ’ere again,
That the padres 'ere are pardres, but
the pad-res there are men;
Oh, they ain’t no kings at; the gnyver
spun from pamphlet, text an’ tome,
But I’d like to ’ear what they’re
savin’ now of the : padres back at ’one;

I believe in the spirit of Anzac,
Aid may it for ever abide,
Till it flows through the whole.of ...
creation
Like a terrible, wonderful tide.
Till it floods every heart with its
beauty,
Till it fills every soul with its song,
for that is the only true Credo
For which an Australian need long.
I believe in the spirit of Anzac,
The spirit that ever inspires
All those who are willing to suffer,
The spirit which lighted the fires
That blazed on the hot sands of Bgypt,
France, Belguim, G-allipoli’s heights,
The spirit of him who is willing
To turn down his own little lights.
I believe in the spirit of Anzac,
The spirit of do and of dare,
The spirit of him who is striving
Himself with all others to share,
That is a creed worth defending,
Worth loving, and living for, aye,
A creed no man need be ashamed of,
A creed for which all men might die,

It took up all his bally time, so we? called

Bach usta take ’im near three weeks —an’
they kept getting bigger.
Well, as was only natural, his kids got

An’, as yer know, the Smith family has
grew and grew and grew,
How these kids grew up to be men, an’ then
there come this war.

We lived on good old marmalade,
Hard biscuit and some crust.
We’ve dossed upon the railroads,
In the carriages de Luxe
And done a trip through Egypt
In some open cattle trucks.
In waterproof and blanket
With bad weather and a sigh
We huddled up together
Each prepared to sleep or die.
We've dossed upon the troopships
That sail the mighty foam,
Thinking of our loved ones,
And dreaming we were home.
We've struggled for positions
Among cargo, oil and coal,
And for a decent rock-a-bye
One would have pawned his soul.

You—who are you who cry for Peace at ary
How many of you fought,are scarred, and

Though this be Hell itself,
'Before we list to you we’d have it thrice-
And we are in the line. (W,G,8,)


AFTERMATH» . (Siegfried Sassoon)
iVB you forgotten yet?
j o r the world’s events have rumbled on
since those gagged days,
like traffic checked awhile at the
crossing of city ways:
jnd the haunted gap in your mind has
filled with thoughts that flow
like clouds in the- lit heavens of life;
and you’re a man reprieved to go,
Taking your peaceful share of Time, with
joy to spare,
3ut the nast is just the same, —and War’s
a bloody game....
Have, you forgotten yet? ... •
T.nok down, and swear by the slain of the
i War that you’ll never forget.
Do you remember the dark months; you held
the sector at Mametz,
The nights you watched and wired and dug
and piled sandbags on parapets?
Do you remember the rats; and the stench
Of corpses rotting in front (f£ the front-
line trench,
And dawn coming, dirty-white, and chill
with a hopeless rain?
Do you &v,er stop and ask, "is it all
going to happen again?"
Do you remember that hour of din before
the attack, —
And the anger, the blind compassion that
seized and shook you then
is you peered at the doomed and haggard
faces of your men?
Do you remember the stretcher—cases
lurching back
tfith dying eyes and lolling heads,
those ashen-grey
Masks of the lads ; who once were keen and
kind .and gay?
Have you forgotten yet?.... • ■ •
Look up, and swear by the green of the
Spring that you’ll never forget.
CONCERT PARTY.
(Egyptian base Camp)
They are gathering round....
Out of the twilight; over the grey-blue
sand,
...Shoals of low-jargoning men drift,inward
to the sound, —
The jangle and throb of a piano...
tum-ti—twn...
Drawn by the lamp, they come
Out of the glimmering lines of their
tents, over the shuffling sand.
0 sing, us the songs, the songs of our
own land,
You warbling ladies in white.
Dimness conceals the hunger in our faces,
This wall of faces risen out of the night,
Those eyes that keep their memories of
the places
So long beyond their sight.
Jaded and gay, the ladies sing; and the
chap in brown
Tilts his grey hat; jaunty and lean
and.pale,
He rattles the .keys...some actor—bloke
from town,...
"God send you home”; and then 11 A long,
long trail”;
11 1 hear you calling me”; and "Dixieland” ...
Sing slowly,, .now the chorus., one by one
We hear them, drink them; till the
concert’s done.
Silent, I watch the shadovy mass of
soldiers stand.
Silent, they drift away, over the
' glimmering sand.

THD CORPORAL’S STORY. (H.T.P.)
I was Corporal; in the A.I.D. for years
■■■ and years and years,
And’ I did me bit on the Western Dront
with the Aussie Pioneers,
And I sometimes think that the roughest
job ds ever we 'ad in the war
Was when they sent us up the line, to
build a camp for Corps-.
My oath, that job was a beauty;Parade A.
at ’arf—past nine,
And then we’de work for the rest of the
day,and-- -mind you—up in the line]
Of course, we ’ad a few smokes, and
lunch—time an.hour or more,
But. we’d start again in-the afternoon,
and never get ’ome till four.
We could ’ear our''eavies firin’; and
then on a good, clear day .
We could veiy near see our own balloons,
not ’ardly two miles away;
The Torbs would come over no?; and again,
and often, on starry nights,
I’ve laid in me bed in me dug-out, and
seen his Verey lights.
My oath, that camp was a roughie; a
terrible windy job:
We ’ad casualties every day—l ms
loosin’ me bloomin’ knob, (Cent.)
THE CORPORAL *3 STORY (Cont.)
Bill and Joe Smith got scabies; and poor
old. Jock Mac Kay
Hit his foot with a hammer, and got

Young Em stood under a sheet of iron
that cracked his skull like an egg,
And another chap fell in a barren—pit
and broke his bleedin’ leg...
There wasn’t * ardly a day went by but
somebody got a crack,
And talk about the mob’s morale I—it ,
had. gone to the bloomin’ pack.
Well, one afternoon I was fed right up,
■and just go in’ ’ome at three,
When who should I see cornin’ down the*
track but Divisional G.O.C.
So I thinks! 11 Well, I’ll ’ave a word
with ’im;" and I clicks me ’eel on
*
me boot,
And fetches up right in front of ’im,,
an dooks ’im a smart salute,
"Well, Corporal," the General says,
,"was you wishing to speak to me?
Just come along.into me dug—out;l’m
’avin’ a cup of tea."
So I follows him into ’is little ’ut
and he shows me into a chair,
And says "Well, Corporal, go ahead;
I’ve plenty of time to spare,"
"Well, it’s just like this," I says,
."the boys have been ’avin’ a darn
rough spin,
And if you don’t take ’em out for a
spell, they’ll be turnin’ the war
right in,"
"Good Godj" he says. And I answers,
let tin’ you know the dink,
If it’s mutiny, Sir, you’re after,
they're ’overing on the brink.
They’re wearin’ themselves to a shadier,
and failin’ away like flies,
And you’ll ’ave the mob of them out on-
strike if ever a barstid dies,"
The General sinks his chin in his ’and,
and he says, as he knits his brow,
"Well, Corp,, this matter is very grave:
I’ll give it attention now,
"But, Corporal, what do you think your-
self? Have you anything to suggest?"
"Too right," I says:"Take the boys right
out, and give ’em a six month’s rest.

j on it plank ’em down in Abbeville, or
Corbie; no bloomin’ chanceJ
3ut take ’em away to Cannes or Nice, away
in the South of Prance.
Or very likely old Marseilles would do
the boys quite well;
3ut cut the drill and parades right out,
and give ’em a real good spell,
ind don’t forget,-"I says, "the boys have
been havin’ a dam rough spin,
and they wouldn’t say ’No’ to a dinkum
feed, or a bottle or two of Yin.
md when you get ’em away on leave:
in thirties instead of threes,
feu’ll get the horames right up to the
mark, as easy as shellin’ peas,'
"well, Corporal," the General says, "it’s
really been veiy nice
lo have this bit of a yarn with you,-
and I’m grateful for your advice.
I’ll think the matter over tonight, and
let the Colonel know,
Meanwhile, perhaps you’ll join me in a
snifter, before you go," .....
So I measures out four finders, neat;
and was forcin’ me lips apart,
Uhen a five-point-nine drops into the
camp and I woke with a bloomin’ start.

’’ALL HANDS. 11
(Hecited by Ed.S.Eord, the

There’s a whisper that was borne upon the, breeze,
■Which the same was just a fancy k?nd. of fable.
As a fact the message went across the seas
By that unpoetic agency the cable.
All the same it sent a sympathetic thrill
Through the Anglo-Saxon folk of other lands,
If you’re in for sto.riry weather
Kindly count us altogether,
And be good enough to call all hands.
We hear the bugle calling on the British G-renadiers,
Yi Jq hearken to the marching of the Irish Fusiliers,
The piping of the Highlanders is ringing in our ears,
So be good enough to call all hands.
We mean to take a place among the nations of the earth;
We’ll found a new Britannia, cr we’ll try vath all our

But we don’t forget the country whore our. Empire ha^ Q

And we’re ready when you call all nands. Qf

That the Britain who .is mistress of the seas
Has a growing group of Britains o’er the ocean.
We prefer a reign of quietness and peace,
But now trouble’s come, we’ll show them how it stands
That ten thousand miles of water makes the British all

When you pass "the word and call all hands.
We’re as English as you English, though the water

It is a fine thing to have a friend

Few men or women travel the road to
success without an occasional puncture.
By doing good turns no one ever made
himself dizzy .
The trouble with most people who act
the foci is that they’re not acting.
You won’t push yourself forward by
patting yourself on the back.
Don’t worry if the world seems hard;
think of the man who works in a stone
quarry .
A Stealle is the one greeting that all
the people of the world understand.
Some men impose upon themselves when
they Ids' 1 their memo ri.es.
Quite a lot of women go to the Sales
and buy nothing that they really need.
It is easier t.o provide for the inner
man than the outer woman.
In. the game of life it is better to
score by honours than by tricks.
The only thing that comes to him who
waits is trouble.
To get through married life without
a cross-word would be a puzzle.

Prosperity depends on the nan, not

Wasted energy. There is no goal on a
circular track. Get organized.
Guessing where you’ll get an order is
like betting on the turn of a wheel —
you’re wrong more times than you’re right.

TUB SUM Of THINGS.
"Ismael Dare J*
This is the sum of things——that we
A moment live, a little see,
Do somewhat, and are gone: for so
The. eternal currents ebb and flow.
This is the- sum of work that man
Does, while he may, the bust he can;
Nor greatly cares, when all is done,
that praise or blame hie toils have won.
This is the sum of sight to find
The links of kin with all our kind,
And know the beauty Nature foie's
Sven in the simplest form she moulds.
This is the sum of life——to feel
Our hand-grip on the hi Ited steel.
To fight beside our nates, and prove
The best of comradeship and love.
This is the sun of things that we
A lifetime live greathearted^,
See the whole best that life has meant,
Do out our work, and go content.
If UP ONLY OOULD. (Mary Gilmore) .
Ah: if we could
Plot out the bitter thought, ,
Make life the tiling we should,
And shape it as we ought,
Turn back the brooding eyes
from things long, long gone by;
And, looking upward, rise
Toward a clearer shy}
Hold fast each other’s hands
Nor loosely let them go
Until each understands,
Aid, loving, learns to know.


MAN'S COMMISSION
"(.Robert drowning)
We’re made so that we love
Eirst when we sec them painted,
things we have passed
Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;
And so they are better, painted—
better to us,
Which is the same thing. Art was given
for that;
God uses us to help each other so,
Lending our minds out.
SOLITUDE.
UDlla Wheeler ’Wilcox)
Laugh, and the world laughs -with you;
Weep, and you weep alone,
lor sad old earth must borrow its mirth,
But has trouble enough of its own.
Sing, and the Mils will answer;
Sigh, it is lost on the air,
The echoes bound to a joyful sound,
But shrink from voicing care.
Aejoicc, and men will seek you}
Grieve, and they turn and go.
They want full measure of all your
pleasure,
But they do not need your woe.
Be glad, and your friends are many;
Be sad, and you lose them all
There are none to decline your nectar*d
wine,
But alone you must drink life's gall,
Least, and your halls are crowded;
East, and the worlc' goes by.
Succeed and give, end it helps you live,
But no man can help you die.
There is room in the halls of pleasure
Eor a large and lordly train,
But one "07/ one we must all file on
Through the narrow aisles of pain.
MUST.
Build a little fence of trust around
today,
Eill the space with loving and therein
stay;
Look not through the sheltering bars.
Upon tomorrow,
God wall help thee bear w/hat comes
of joy and sorrow:.

r^dgar A Guest)
What sorrows has a man to toll
If those at home say all is well?
If those he loves report in glee
That health is theirs, what can there he
Of grave anxiety 'and doubt
Nor him. sit and fret about?
Tor what are pain and hurt and care
And all the burdens man must hear
If when the dreary day is o’er
A smiling child is at the door
And at the table where they sit
Is heard the mirth of youthful wit?
Is life a thing to he compressed
Into man’s utmost and Ms best.
Or may' it drift, along or run
Like summer brooks beneath the sun,
Loving the shore line’s fj.owers and trees
Before they join the mightier seas?
What matters loss of place or pride
Or glory on life’s selfish side
If bhose at heme are undismayed
By any petty failure made?
If those we love are halo and strong,
Then nothing can bo very wrong,
EOHGET IT, (A. Hawkins)
Don’t pigeon hcle your worries and so
mind them, But put them where you’ll
have a job to find them.


WOHTH YOpH —( HqHie Mackay)
Sure, you're feet won't find the way long
If you sing a little gay song,
And" there'll never be a day wrong
While you keep this thought in mind':
'When you're passing through a sad time
Or you're living in a bad dine,
If you read my little glad rhyme
Consolation you will find'.
If you want to gain a high place
(So', at least, I've found in iry case),
You must never show a wry face,
For there's conquest in a smile;
Learn the joy that from a jest springs,
Find the beauty of the oest tilings,
Know the "peace that well-earned rest brings,
And make living wfrth your while!
THY.
(Paul Preston)
Try to make your life today,
By cry act, each word you say,
Tasks you do, and thoughts you pen,
Helpful to your fellow men; .
Act and word, endowed with wings,
Hake or mar so many tilings.
Try to show to , every man
All the courtesy you can;
In the office, workshop,, street,
Be polite to all you meet, . •;
Of all bitterness -and scorn
Let your character be shorn.
Try to bring by kindly grace,
Happiness to every place
Yilheresoe 'er your lot is cast
For the moments fleet so fast
That the time in which to bless
Bvery hour grows less and less.

Y7e learnt the creed at Hungerford,
We learnt the creed at Jourke;
We leamt it in the good times,
And learnt it out of work.
We learnt it by the'harbour-side
And on the billabong:
"Hu matter what a mate may do ,
A mate can do no wrongJ' 1
He's like a king in this'respect
(Ho matter what they do),
And, king-like,shares in storm and shine
The Throne of Life with you.
Tie learnt it when wo were in gaol,
And put it in a song:
"Ho matter-what a mate may do,
A mate can do no wrong!"
They'll say he said a bitter word
When he's away or dead.
We're loyal to his memory,
Ho matter what he said.
And we should never hesitate,
But strike out good and strong,
And jolt the slanderer on the jaw—
A mate can do no wrongl

heart become the wife I . may the wife

And it’s much the same with me.

Beneath, and a book of rhyme,
.and a coddlesome girl that sings a bit,
But don’t sing all the time;
That’s all I ask, and it’s only just;
Bor it’s all that I hold dear—
A bough .and a book and a girl and a crust;
That, and a jug of beer.
Then I’ll cuddle my girl and I’ll quaff

As we sit on the leafy floor;
And when the book and the beer jug fail;
I’ll cuddle ny girl some more:.
Bor jugs give out and books get slow,
But you take my tip for square
Though the bough and the book and the
beer jug go,
The girl, she’s always there.
I’m sick of the sound of ny fellows’

I’m sick of their schemes and shams;
Of trying to choose when there ain’t
no choice,
And of damning several damns;
So, give me a girl that ain’t too slow.
You can keep your book of rhyme
And your bough and bread and your beer.

And I’ll cuddle her all the time.

ENGLAED YET. 141 •
rHeniy Lawson)
She’s England yet: The nations never
know her;
Or, if they knew, were ready to forget.
She made new worlds that paid no homage
to her,
Because she called for none as for a debt.
The bullying Bower that deemed all nations
craven,
And thought her star of destiny had set,
Was sure that she would seek a coward ! s
haven
And tempted her, and found her England yet;
We learn our England, and we soon forget,
To learn again that she is England yet.
They watched Britannia ever looking forward,
But could not see the things her children
saw.
They watched in Southern seas her boats
pull shoreward,
But only marked the eyeglass, heard the
"Haw:"
In tents and bungalows, and outpost
stations,
Thin white men ruled for her, unseen,
unheard,
Ten millions of strange races and far
nations
Were ready to obey her at a word.
We learn our England, and in peace forget,
To learn in storm that she is England yet,
She ! s England yet; and men shall doubt
no longer;
And mourn no longer for what she has been.
She’ll be a greater England and a stronger—
A better England than the world has seen.
Our own, who reck not of a king’s regalia,
Tinsel of crowns, and courts that fume and
fret,
lire fighting for her—fighting for
Australia
nnd blasphemously hail her "England Yet;"
She’s England yet, with little to regret
Ay, more than ever, she’ll be
England .fet;


. L dT SOMETHING GOOD BE SAID.
When over the fair fame of friend or foe
The shadow cf disgrace shall fall;instead
Of words of blame, or proof of thus and so,
£et something good be said.
Forget not that no fellow being yet
May fall so low,but love may lift his head,
Even the cheek of shame with tears is wet,
If something good be said.
No generous heart may vainly turn aside
In ways os sympathy; no soul so dead
But may awaken strong and glorified,
If something good be said.
And so I charge ye, by the thorny crown.
And by the cross on which the Saviour bled,
. And by your own soul's hope of fair renown.
Let something good be said.
(James >7. Riley)
SOMETHING EACH DAY.
Something each day a smile,
It is not much to give;
And the little gifts of life
Make sweet the days we live.
The world has weary hearts
That we can bless and cheer,
And a smile for every day
Makes shnshine all the year.
THINGS TO FORGET.
If you see a tall fellow ahead of a crowd,
A leader of men, marching fearless and proud,
And you know of a tale whose mere telling
aloud
Would cause his proud head to in anguish
be bowed
It’s a pretty good plan to forget it.
If you know of a skeleton hidden away
In a closet, and guarded and kept from
the day
In the dark: and whose showing, whose
sudden display,
Would cause grief and sorrow and lifelong
dismay
It’s a pretty good plan to forget it.
If you know of a thing that will darken
; • - the joy
Of a man or a v/oman, a girl or a boy;
That will wipe cut a smile, or the least
way annoy
A fellow, or cause any gladness to cloy
It’s a pretty good plan to forget it.
CHRISTMAS GREETINGS.

Mother dear, your boy’s grown up,
And from you gone away, ;
And yet you never were more dear
Than on this Christmas Day:
God guard and bless you,Mother mine;
Great joy be yours, I pray:
TO A FATHER.
Dear old Dad, I give you greeting
On this joyous Day of Days.
You have been the best of fathers,
And deserve no end of praise.
May your life be always happy:
Carking care flit far away:
Dear old Dad, I give you greeting
On this joyous Christmas Day.
«TIS USELESS TO REGRET.
There's many a plan that comes to naught,
There’s many a light gone out;
And disappointments,griefs, and cares,
Have hedged us round about;
And many a sad mistake, we’ve made
Throughout our lives, and yet
We’ve done the very best we could;
’Tis useless to regret,
For out of evil good has come.
And out of darkness light; •
And all wrong-doings in this world,
Some day will be set right;
And though we have not reached the height
Attained by others, yet
We’ve done the best we could, my lad;
s Tis useless to regret.
We’ve tried to live like honest folks,
To do our duty well,
Gainst evil things to take our stand,
In goodness to excel,
0 judge yourself not harshly, lad,
Nor at misfortune fret;
We’ve done the best wa could, and sc
'Tis useless to regret.


WHAT IS SUCCESS? ( ...
What is success? To gain a-share of gold?
To have one’s wealth in envious accents told?
To see one’s picture flaunted .in the Press? / -
All, there be those who label this success.
What is success? To win a little fame?
To hear a fickle world applaud your name?
To be accounted as a genius? Yes,.
And there be those who label this success.
But have we not another standard still
To judge a man of character and will?
Are gold and fane the only measures tried?
In all the world is there no test beside?
All, yes. The man who meets,with courage grim
The daily duties that devolve on him,
The petty,mean,heart-breaking cares that tire
The patient soul that never may aspire
Howe’er so cramped the field wherein lie works,
He has not failed—the man who never shirks,
The man who toils for years without a break,
And treads the. path of pain for others* sake.
' ' '
There is a myriad, of such men today,
Who, all unnoted, walk the we ary way
Upon their shoulders still'the cross may press,
But who wall soy- they have not won success?
A HOME SCNG-. V
We read within a poet’s book
A word that starred the page,.
M Stone walls do not a prison' make,
Uor iron bars a cage; 11
Yes, that is true, and something more:
You’ll find, where’er you roam,
That marble floors and gilded walls
Gan never make a home.
But every house where love abides
And friendship is a guest,
Is surely Home, and Home sweet Home,
Por there the heart can rest.

HOW?
Bid you tackle the trouble that came
your way
With a resolute heart and cheerful 9
Or hide your face from the light of day
With a craven soul and fearful?
Oh, a trouble’s a ton, or a trouble’s
an ounce,
A trouble is what you make it;
And it isn’t the fact that you’re hurt
that counts,
But only how did you take it?
You are beaten to earth? Well, well,
what’s that?
Come up with a smiling face;
It’s nothing against you to fall down
flat,
But to lie there —that’s disgrace.
The herder you’re thrown, why, the
higher you bounce;
Be proud of your clackened eye.
It isnt the fact that you’re licked
that counts,
It’s how did you fight—and why?
EVERY BAY
Every day we move and live
Is a time to get and give,
Get whatever we can earn,
Any lesson we can learn,
G-ive unstintingly our best —
Labour, knowledge, service, rest.
Every day which comes and goes
Opportunity bestows
For the working of some plan
For the betterment of nan,
And whoever shirks his share,
Of life’s bliss is unaware.
Every day of gloom or shine
Is a day to make divine,
Hot to use for selfish ends,
But for all that moves or tends
towards mankind’s undoubted goal,
Universal self-control,
MIND YCUH Om BUS HIES a.
The reason why men who mind
their own business succeed is because
they have so little competition.
E^EHIEHOE
They told me over and ever again
The things that I had. cc learn,
They struggled to save me the needless
pain
Of many a sting and ‘burn,
But I was young, and I would find out
The truth of the dangers they talked
about.
And now I know what they know, and I
Have children of my own.
And the day will come when they* 11 want
to try
Their strength in the danger zona,
For the way seems level and straight
and fair
And they can't believe there are briars
there.
But should they take what I wouldn-1
take,
In spite of the needless tears?
Should age regret that it cannot make
A short cut through the years?
How sad, were youth if it really knew
As much as the worn-out oldsters do*
In spite of the truths which the
grown-ups know
And the thick books on the shelves,
It is well that the youngsters still
must go,
Some lessons to learn themselves.
For a horrible sight would a young man be
Weighed down by the wisdom of seventy-three,
BAM
Hover say die, say Damn
It isn-t classico It may be profsiua.
But we mortals have need of it
Time and again.
And you’ll find you’ll recover
From fates hardest slam
If you never say Bio, say Damn*
So long as there is work to do
there will be interruptions—breaks in
its progress and it is part of ore’s
character growth to bear these timely
or intimely interruptions without any
break in good temper or courtesy.


AFTER TOIX'
There isnt any happiness in happiness
itself,
There isnt any knowledge in the looks
upon, the shelf-.
You may buy them by the dozen, but unless
you read them through.
All the wisdom of their pages will be just
dry rot to you ...
For the only lasting lesson is the one you
work to learn,
And the only worth-while pleasures are the
ones you have to earn.
If never care disturbed us none would
value peace of mind,
Gold became a precious metal just because
it’s hard to find.
If it weren ? t for stern old duty we should
never value play,
It takes, long months of labour to make
‘sweet a holiday.
So be patient through your trials and be
brave in times of doubt,
You will reap new fields of gladness when
youv ’e worked your problems out.
! Twas an Irishman I’me certain who this
quaint assertion dropped,
"I’me glad my tooth is aching,’Twill be
grand when it is stopped".
There’s philosophy for trials. It’s the
cold and driving rain
That sets -us all rejoicing when the sun
comes out again.
For if hearts were never troubled and if
none a burden knew,
We should all go round complaining there
was nothing left to do.
mil HOT SMILE . :
What’s the use of grumbling?
It doesnt pry. the bills.
It doesn’t cure our aches and pains
Nor help our other ills.
We can grumble every morning
And go grumbling on till night,
But if we just'start smiling
It helps to set things right,
NEVER EXPLAIN.

46. BOX ON.
(Jos. r.O’Carroll) •
The ong has sounded, you take your
stand
In the midst of the ring of Life,
”Box on” is your first and yora last
command
As you enter the wordly strife.
”Box on.” Be careful, keep off the
ropes,
Are words from seconds —your
f riends,
Encouraging words that strengthen your
hopes
In the fight on which all depends,
”Box on”. Lend a hand to the man
who ’s down.
Strike not, assist him to rise,
’Tis as easy to smile as it is to frown —
The smile brings you nearer the prize.
"Box on.” Play fair, though the fight
be long
And the punishment be severe,
If your cause be just end your heart
be strong,
The verdict you need not fear.

WHY?
; want to ask a question—
fill some one tell me wiy
len can sin and sin again,
[eep sinning till they die?
bid no one seems to question,
bid no one seems to care; g.;
Jut still we call bhem gentlemen,
)ery this none would dare.
Jut- woman, gentle woman,
Jhould she but chance to stray,
fo matter, oh, how little,
’rom the straight and narrow way.
’or her there's no returning
!till downward she must go;
here's none to save or pity,
here's naught for her but woe,
[en may drink and sport and gamble,
laise the devil night and day,
ill they're known all o'er the country
iy the wrecks that strew their way ;
it ill they'.re welcomed and they're courted,
[f they've money all the more
Snd the mothers over all the land
)pen wide to them their door,
ie's your* son and-she's your daughter,
lurely he's as much to blame,
hat's sin for man is sin for woman
hey should suffer just the’same,
toy, oh why, will some one tell me,
hould the woman stand it all?
if you analyse the subject
ou can bet man caused the fall;
'hat's the thing rhat mystifies me,
bn't some person kindly tell
hy the men are all forgiven
nd the women go to Hell?.
he Frenchman likes his native wine;
he German likes his beer;
he Englishman' likes Ms half-and-half
ecause it brings good cheer,
he Scotchman likes Ms whisky;
he Irishman likes it hot;
he Australian has no national drink
o he drinks the whole lot.
3eer is mostly frbth and bubble,
hi sky makes you moan,
ine's another word for trouble,
Inkie's on its own.
AND THIS SHOULD BE ODE DAILY PRAYER. •
Teach me that sixty minutes make an
hour, sixteen ounces make a pound, and
two hundred and forty pennies make a pound.
Help me to so live that I can lie down at
night with a clear conscience, without a
gun underneath ny pillow, and undaunted
by the faces of those to whom I have brought
pain. Grant that I may earn my meal ticket
on the square and that in earning it, I
may do unto others as I would have them
do unto me. Deafen me to the jingle of
tainted money and the rustle of unholy
skirts. Blind me to the faults of other
people but reveal to me my own. Guide me
so that each night when I look across the
dining table at my Mother, who has been a
blessing to me, that I may have nothing
to conceal from her. Keep me young enough
to laugh with little children and sympathet-
ic enough to be considerate of old age,
arid when comes the day of darkened shades
and the smell of flowers, the tread of
soft footsteps and the crumbling of wheels
in the yard, make the ceremony short and
the epitaph simple
Here lies a man,

VTho gives his word and keeps it,
vThom dogs and little children instinctively
• - love•
Whom the toughest chaps call a white man.
Who never hits below the belt.
Who never lies to women.
Who never kicks when he loses.
Who guards his own wigwam, and doesn't
prowl.
Who sees the other chap's point of view..
Who never crawls to anyone.
Whom the other men's wives are safe with.
Who doesn't steal children in doorways.
Who loves football, racing, poker, cricket,
bowls, gardening, swimming, walking,flirting.
Who never takes money he knows another
chap can't afford to lose.
Who pays his tailor sometimes.
Who realizes that Ms wife isn't a house-
keeper, or a plumbing expert,or a laundress.
Who looks you in the. eye ..arid-doesn't"dodge.
Whom you want other chaps to know.
Who pulls out at the home corner and lets
another fellow have the inside running
on the straight,

OPPOHTUITXTY.. (Walter Malone)
They do no wrong who say I come no more,
When once I knock and fail to find you in;
Por every day I stand outside your door, .
And bid you wake,*, and rise and fight to win.
Wait not for precious chances pass away;
Weep not for ages" on the wane I
Each night I burn the records of the day;
And sunrise eveiy soul is born again.
Though deep in mire’ wring uc.t yoor hands
and weep,
I lend my arm to all who say "l canj"
No shamefaced outcast ever sank so deep
But yet might rise and be again a mani
Dost thou behold thy lost ycuthiall aghast?
Post reel from righteous retribution’s blow,
Then turn from blotted archieves of the past,
And find the future’s pages white as snow.
Art thou a mourner? House thee from thy spell;
Art thou a:sinner? Sins may be forgiven;
Each morning gives the wings to flee from hell,
Each night a star to guide thy feet to Heaven.
IT’S NO IN TITLES. (Bums)
It's no in titles nor in rank;
It’s no in wealth like Lon’on bank,
To ■purchase peace and rest;
It’s no in making muckle mair;
It’s no in books; it’s no. in laar,
To'make us truly blest;
If happiness hae not her seat
And centre in the breast,
We may be wise, -or rich, or great,
But never can be blent:
Nae treasures, nor pleasures,
Could make us happy lang;
The heart aye’s the part" aye,
That maks us right or wrang.
POHGIVENESS.(Tennyson)
0 man, forgive-thy mortal foe,
Nor ever strike him blow for blow;
Por all the souls on earth that live
To be forgiven must forgive.
Porgive him seventy times and seven;
Por all the blessed souls in Heaven
Are both forgivers and forgiven.
A THING- OP BEAUTY. (John Keats) x 49.
A thing of beauty is a -joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases Jit will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will
keep .
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Pull of sweet dreams, and health, and
quiet breathingj
Therefore, on every morrow, are we
wreathing
A flowery band to bind us' to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman
dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o’er—dark-
ened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite
of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the
pall
Prom, our dark spirits. Such the sun,
the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a
shady boon
Por simple sheep; and such are
daffodils,
With the green world they live in;
and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert
make '
’Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest
brake,
Hich with a sprinkling of fair musk-
rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the
. dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we'have heard
or read;
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven’s
brink.
CHARACTER. (Othello)
Good name, in man and woman,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls;
Who steals my purse, steals trash;
His something, nothing;
’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been
‘ slave to thousands:
But he that filches from me my good
name,
Hobs me of that which not enriches him,
And makes me poor indeed.

Sweet is the journey on friendship’s road.

Perfected in self control,
Whose words are fruit of gentle thought

Whose deeds are such as can he given
The benediction of high heaven.
How rare it is to find a man
Who day hy day does all he can,
At home, in business, in the streets,
To cheer and succour folk he meets,
And who would rather suffer loss
Than fail to share another's cross.
How rare it is to hear a word
Which cheers one like a singing bird,
To feel the clasp of hands that we
Are sure from selfish ends are free;
And yet, though rare as winter flowers,
Thank God these virtues can be ours.

HUMOROUS
VERSES


PARMER BILL’S BLUNDER.
Ere Parmer Bill to London went
He called upon his future bride;
”Say, lass, what shall I bring thee back?”
The dear, good-hearted fellow cried.
The maiden smiled. Pull well she loved
Herself with pretty things to deck,
”oh, thank thee kindly, Bill,” she said;
”Well, bring me something neck.”
The match has now been broken off;
Of reconcilement there’s no hope.
The maiden can't forgive poor Bill
Por bringing her a cake of soap,

A ROMANCE IK A TUITHEL.
The train clanked on, and the sun was high,
I mused and smoked and read,
I envied the cattle fleeting by, diy,
Por I’d naught to drink, and was more than
And swelled and sore ny head.
We reached the tunnel, the lights were out,
A lady's voice I heard,
”oh, Charlie, dear,now stop—get out,
You’ll drive me mad, without a doubt—
You’re too bold, upon ny word,”
I tried to peer through the hole the lamp
Was meant to occupy,
But the car was dark, and the wicked scamp,
Who was plainly one of the forward stamp,
Still made the lady cry;
”oh, leave ny skiits alone, you scamp,”
Was still the lady's ciy.
But the broad daylight, it came to light,
It floored me, I confess,
Per a maid of fifty met ny sight,
Her dog was tugging with all his might
At the hem of his owner’s dress.
The scene I'd pictured turned out right,
Which relieved me, I confess.
There was a young Hun of Berlin
Who picked up a bomb with the pin;
When he took the pin out he w:s sent
with a clout
To the place all Huns should bo in.

I dreamt there wasn’t any snow, or rain,

And saw a German shell descend that
proved to be a ”dud".
I dreamt I saw a who didn’t

And a great big Gotha overhead whose
engines didn’t hum;
I thought I saw Old Bill himself, digging
in a trench,
And heard our own interpreter really
speaking French;
I dreamt I played the Good Old Game,
won five bob on the crown,
And saw our anti-aircraft guns bring a
Hun ’plane down;
And I thought I saw a driver who really
couldn’t swear,
And got a shirt from ” Divvy” baths clean
enough to wear,
I dreamt I had come money, fully twenty
pounds,
And cane across a village that wasn’t
”out of bounds”.
I dreamt I saw a real M,P. who hopped
the bags with dash
And a soldier on a base—job who wasn’t

I dreamt we' ; d really won the war and
finished Bertha Knapp,
And my blankets weren't inhabited.

SURRY HILLS PASTORAL.
"How, you children," said the teacher,
"Tell me what does mean."
But an answer didn’t reach her;
Seemed the question bowled ’em clean.
Then she tried again:"How, laddie,
You’re the one that’s always bright,
"What does Mummy say to Daddy
When he reaches home at night?"
That’s where Laddie got a notion
That he understood her now.
He replied, without emotion:
"’Drunk again, yer rotten cow!"
TRAGEDY OF THE EGG-.
"Eating more than he was able,
Willie died at breakfast table.
’lf you please', said sister Meg,
’May I have his other egg?".
-<
Willie in the best of sashes
Fell in the fire, was burnt to ashes.
Bye and bye the room grew chilly,
But no one cared to stir up Willie.

Sisters and Brothers have I none;
Father’s wage will support but one.
REVISED VERSIOH.
Mary’s little nanny-goat .
Ate "Osh—Eosh" from the walls,
And when the little kiddies came
They all wore overalls.
PATCH OF HUT BHO'.cNf HUE.
Two girls gay met a boy one day,
His legs were briar—scratched,
His clothes were of blue, but a nut
brown hue
Marked the place his pants were patched.
They laughed with joy at the blue-clad boy
And his patch of nut-brown hue.
"Why don’t you patch with colour to match?"
They said "Why not with blue?"
Don’t be coy, ny blue—clad boy,
"Speak up," and they laughed with glee.
When he hung Ms head, as he bashfully said:
"That ain’t no patch, that’s MB."
JaEE'S PROPOSAL.
Jake was a very wordy chap,
who always spoke right out,
And yet no matter what he said,
His talk was round-about; '■ -
Therefore when he proposed,
He drawled: "G-race, I’d be glad,
If, when you^start your family,
You’ll let me be their dad!"
MARY’S CAT.
Mary had a Tommy cat,
It warbled like Caruso,
A fellow swung a bat,
And now it doesn’t do so.
NURSERY RHYMES.
-The basliful chap, held in his lap
A babe, that laughed in glee;
He longed to die—Ms mouth was diy—
But, oh, how damp Ms kneel
Mary wears a lovely skirt;
Short and bright and airy.
It never shows a"speck of dirt—
But it shows a lot of Maty.
I love little Flossie,
Her fur—coat’s so warm,
If he knew all about it
Her father would storm.
DEAD EARH3ST.
I asked a young lady if she would wed,
With a smile in her bright roguish eyes,
she said:
"G-o, ask father."
How she knew that I knew
That her father was dead:
And she knew that I knew
Of the life he had lei.
So she knew that I knew
What she meant when she said.
Tf G-o, ask father' 1 .

OUR BIBLE STORIES.
Adam was the first man, he Med.. iu-
lonely life,
He took a slat and dressed it up and
had it for a wife;
Eve was fond of apple-sass, and had
to have a bite,
So the angel with fiery sword chased
Y them out of sight.
Old folks, young folks, all you
darkes come,
Come to the Sunday, school and make
yourselves at home;
Please to check your chewing-gum and
razors at the door,
And you’ll hear some Bible stories
like you never heard before,
Adam was the first man, Eve was his
spouse,
They quit eatin’ fruit one day and
went to keepin’ house;
Now Adam’s life was happy and
• peaceful in the'main,
Till Eve she had a little son, and
went to raising Cain.
Jonah was. a sailor, so runs the
Bible tale,
He shipped,in the steerage of a
trans—Atlantic whale;
He did not like his quarters, they
were not the very best,
So Jonah pressed the button and the
whale he did the rest.
Samson was a,strong man of the
John L. Sullivan school,
He slew the bold Philistines with
the fragments of a.mule;
A gal named Delilah filled him.full
of gin,
Then she cropped his whiskers, and
the coppers ran him in.
David was a fighter, a gamey little
cuss,
Along came Goliath allocking for a
fuss; .
David saw' he’d have to fight or else
he’d have to dust,
So he shied a rock at Golly, and
busted in his crust.
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,
In the fiery;furnace, standing jih':a;row;
Belshazzer thought that ho had put those
chi Hun on the blink,
But one by ’one they all-came out and
hollered.for a drink.
Esau was a farmer, a wild, and woolly rake,
His father sold him half a farm and half
■to brother Jake; :
When Esau.saw the title to his farm land
wasn’t clear,
He sold it to his brother for a sandwich
and a beer,
Noah was a sailor of great and wide
renown,
He used to sail the ocean, till a mountain
ran him down;
He never had a compass and he never had
a sail,
So I think it’s mighty lucky that he
lived to tell the tale.
Daniel was a fellow with a cast-iron hide,
Lions tried to eat him, but they couln’t
get inside;
When Darius came around and looked into
the ring,
"I fooled you once, 1 ' said Daniel, and
the drinks were on the king,
Solomon was a wise man, he had a lot of cash,
Queen of Sheba came along, and Solly made
a mash;
Solly thought that royalty was greatly
underpaid,
So he took to writing proverbs, though he
was a king by trade,
Elijah was a prophet, who visited country
fairs,
To advertise his business with a troop of
dancing bears;
He sold a king a prophecy, and every
afternoon
He went up in a parachute and a painted•
fire balooh.

THS TRAGEDY.
The cow stood on the tramway track,
The driver rang the boll;
But the silly creature turned her back,
. And heeded not his yell.
The driver strove to stop the tram,.
But the brakes went wrong somehow,
There came a crash, an awful smash,
And the air was full of cow.
The bones and hoofs and horns and hair
. Were scattered in a flash;
Some here, some there, some‘.everywhere—
It was an awful smash.
One teat fell on an ’old maid's lap,
The sight her bosom thrilled;
She cried aloud to all the crowd:
’’Good God: the guard is killed”.
IP. . .
If you can see a pretty calf and never
get a thrill 9
If you can.go to work each day and
never kid you're ill,
If you can pay y*ur income tax and
pay it with a grin,
And never go to dancing halls or other
dens of sin,
If you can keep teetotal and you never
even smoke,
If you can shun wild women and can
spurn a naughty joke,
You'll be a man some day, ray lad,
But not, I fear, like your old dad.

THE FOOxl LI TILL PLY ,
A poor little fly flew by the door
And flew right into a‘grocery store,
He sat on the cheese and sat on the ham,
Then he vriped his feet on the grocery man.
When the grocery .man saw what he had done,
He loaded up his gatling gun,
And chased the fly. all over.the place
And tried to shoot him in the face.
But the little fly was far too slick
For he showed the grocery man a trick;
He flew around the room, and then ,
Went over and sat on the ham again.
And when he had finished his dirty work,
He flew over and lit on the lady clerk,-'- .
Then he started to stroll across her knee,
It tickled her so much she laughed with glee.
His rapid motion made her sigh,
And then she said 11 Oh,.- mei Oh, ny, 1 ”
She slapped her leg, and.held her breath,
And the poor little fly was crushed-to
death.
If you rest, you rust.
If you thrust —you bust.
No rest —• no rust.
No thrust no bust,


DEPIiESSIOi:. ‘ u
If all the seas were made, of Deer, and
all. the land was Cheese,
Anl Crayfish grew already cooked like
leaves upon the trees;
If banknotes fell instead of. rain, and
all the- grass was Gold.,
If Summer .days were not too'hot, nor
winter ones too .cold.
If houses sprouted in the night, and
motor cars cost nil,
And everyone was full of Vim and no one
ever ill.
.If fowls laid ninety eggs -a day, and
work was just a crime,
And everyone lived three thousand years
and nine.
If every man had thirty wives and all
of them were dumb,
And diamonds grew like hazel, nuts and
cows provided run.
If cigarettes were three feet long and
politics were barred,
And loaves of bread were thick as logs
and measured by the yard.
All well! *Twould : be a merry world
But some perverted owl
Some pessimistic b fool,
Would find some cause to growl,

WHAT IS A BOY?
What is a boy?
He is a person who is going to carry on
what you have started.
to sit right where you are sitting
and attend to those things you think so
important when you are gone.
You may adopt all the policies you
please, but how they will be carried on
depends on him,
Hven if you make leagues and treaties,
he will have to manage them.
He is going to sit in your seat in
Parliament and occupy your place on the
Supreme Court Bench.
He is going to move in and take over
your prisons, churches, universities,
courting houses and corporations,
Yhen you have done, all your work is
going to be Judged and praised or
condemned by him.
dour reputation and your fortune are
in his hands -
He will read the books you write or
sell them to the secondhand man.
He will assume control of your cities.
Just now the future Prime Minister is
playing marbles, and the most famous actor
of his day is complaining because he does
not want to go to bed.
Hot your contemporaries and fellow
citizens, but the boys out there in the
school yard, are going to say whether
af-cer all you were a grand and noble hero
or a blatherskite.
It -s the boy who wj.ll amend your ruleS,
alter your creedvS, laugh at your mistakes.
He may think kindly of you, and say
you did fche best you could, or he may not.
Watch your step 3
All your work is for him, and the fate
of the nation and of humanity is in his
hands.
So it might be as well to ray him some
attention.
Dr .Frank Crane in the Photo—'Engrav-
ers Bulletin*
