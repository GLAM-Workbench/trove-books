NEW SOUTH WALES
HEALTH RESORT
The influence of the Australian climate upon
health and longevity is a subject of very con-
siderable interest and importance. That its
influence is of a decided character may be in-
ferred from the distinctive effects produced in
the vegetable world and among the lower
animals, also from the evidences of racial
characteristics already manifesting themselves
amongst the native-born population. The re-
presentative Australian of the future will pro-
bably have a physique marking him off from the
inhabitants of all other parts of the earth’s sur-
face. Evidences of tjiis are familiar to us, and
the climate, which is evolving a special type of
man, must also now be producing special effects
on longevity and health.
It is not clear that the death rates in Aus-
tralia are low at every age. That they are at
most ages we know, but the mortality of born
Australians at advanced periods of life is yet


an unascertained quantity. Repeated actuarial
investigations have shown that in the colonies
of New South Wales and Victoria the death
rates are decidedly lower in childhood, early
manhood, and middle life than in the United
Kingdom. In the colonies, however, the higher
the age the larger the proportion of British-
born population, and the less value are the
statistics as indicative of what is likely to
happen in the future among the purely Austra-
lian-born. The wanner a climate is, the
quicker people mature, and it is a fair inference
that the earlier they mature, the sooner they
will descend into the vale of years. Hence it
may be that Australians, enjoying as they do
greater immunity from death at the earlier and
middle periods of life than those in cooler
latitudes, will he stricken down more rapidly
after the age of fifty-five is passed. The low-
ness of the death i-ate at the ages previous also
must tend to bring about a suspended mortality,
which is likely to swell the number of the
deaths at higher ages. It remains true beyond
a doubt that the mass of the people here have
a distinctly higher vitality than those at home,
and Australian children inherit a fairer pros-
pect of life and health than those probably of
any European country. It is, however, when
the death rates from particular diseases are
compared, that the value of the climate as a
health resort is made apparent, and I hope to
bring clear evidence to show that in New South
Wales we have a natural sanatorium of high


excellence in regard to some of the most
destructive diseases that afflict mankind.
Very little literature exists for the purpose
of attracting attention to the strong points of
our climate, and a study of the facts impresses
on the mind that we have been unduly reticent
on the subject. Those who have resided in the
United Kingdom know how strenuously the
claims of various places are upheld as regards
their good effect on health. It is the same
with Continental resorts, whether their special
attractions are mountain air, mineral waters,
or medicinal baths; all are engaged very
seriously in pushing their claims to public
patronage. There does not appear to be any
good reason for hiding our light under a
bushel, unless it be that it is deemed advisable
not to encourage persons coming to live here
who are not amongst the most robust. If the
cause of humanity, however, calls for their
admission, I know of no plea so strong that can
be brought against it.
Of the various divisions of Australia, New
South Wales may, on the whole, be credited
with being the most suitable as a health resort
to persons living jn the United Kingdom.
There are certainly in other colonies districts
which surpass in salubriousness considerable
portions of this one, but taking them in their
entirety the palm may fairly be awarded to
New South Wales. I have the direct authority
of our Government Astronomer for saying that;
as compared with Victoria, it is cooler in


summer and warmer in winter. The same may
be said of it in comparison to South Australia.
Queensland and Western Australia are out of
the running. As regards Tasmania, its salu-
briousness is most effective to those who come
from a warmer climate, whereas my object
is to consider what is suitable to those who
come from a colder one.
Dealing now more directly with our subject,
I would point out a few of the chief character-
istics of our climate. We have an atmosphere
of extreme purity, largely due to the extreme
dryness of the country. Marshes and swamps
are rare. The eucalyptus forests drain the
land, and their absorbent powers are remark-
able. As the gum trees are evergreens also,
there is little decaying vegetable matter where
they grow. Moreover, it is a virgin country,
with it's soil but little charged with those waste
products which accumulate as the density of
the population increases. Severe cold is never
experienced except in the limited area of the
very highest spots; the summer heat may be
largely avoided by change of residence; and,
lastly, there is the glorious endowment of sunny
days which accompanies the entire round of the
seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
New South Wales, in common with many
other parts of Australia, is much cooler than
places in the corresponding latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere. This fact is too well
known to require further reference. The
extent of the variation is, however, worthy of


particular notice. For example, the mean
temperature of Liverpool (N.S.W.) is 59.9, and
that of Nice 60.1 —practically identical, while
the latter place is nearly 10 degs. further from
the equator. Forbes (N.S.W.) has a mean
temperature of 62.7, and Toulon of 62.3, whereas
the difference of latitude is again nearly 10
degs. In these comparisons the places named
are at the sea level, or nearly so; elevation,
therefore, is not in any way the cause of the
great variations. Taking the colony as a
whole, the mean temperature from forty-five
stations scattered over the entire territory has
been found to be 59.3 degs., or only 1 deg.
more than Paris. The highest reading of the
thermometer recorded in Paris is 106.5, and of
Sydney 108.5.
As regards equability, New South Wales com-
pares satisfactorily with European places with
equal mean annual temperatures. Indeed, if we
compare places similarly situated, and with
equal mean average annual temperatures,, we
find the advantage greatly on the side of the
southern lands. For example, Eden (N.S.W.)
and Naples have each a mean annual tempera-
ture of 60.3, but the difference between the
summer and winter temperatures is 16 degs.
for Eden, and 26.8 for Naples. In Sydney the
variation between the summer and winter
temperatures is 16.8 degs. At Barcelona, with
a mean annual temperature of half a degree less
than the New South Wales metropolis, the
difference between the mean summer and winter
temperatures is 26.1 degs.


The climatic conditions of the colony admit
of easy division into three zones running from
north to south for its whole length. First, the
coastal strip ; secondly, the elevated tableland
and mountains, varying in width from 120 to
200 miles; and, lastly, the extended area of the
western plains. In the division lying between
the mountains and the sea we have a climate
tempered by the sea breezes, with a generally
abundant rainfall. In the tablelands the heat
is mitigated by altitude, and the average rain-
fall is moderate, though plentiful in some parts.
The western districts again are characterised
by greater heat in summer and more cold in
winter; also by general dryness and absence of
wind.
To illustrate the main features of these re-
spective zones, I have calculated the average
figures derived from a considerable number of
representative places in each of the divisions.
The figures are as follows :

The materials for this summary were obtained from
“The Health and Progress of New South Wales,” ed.
1895-6.


This table summarises the principal facts
about the climate of the colony. At the extreme
right-hand column we have the evidence of the
familiar fact that the further we go from the
coast the smaller the rainfall. It may be added
that the western slopes of the tableland have
decidedly less than the eastern, and the extreme
western districts receive less than those be-
tween them and the mountains. The next
column to the left shows that the further from
the Pacific we go the greater the daily range of
temperature. If we take out the differences
between the summer and winter temperatures
also for each division it will be seen that the
annual range of temperature follows the daily
range in increasing with remoteness from the
seaboard. While there is very little differ-
ence between the average annual temperature
on the coast and in the western regions, the
latter are on the average 5.5 degs. warmer in
summer and 2.5 degs. cooler in winter. The
extent of the effect of altitude is clearly seen,
and the statistics reveal the interesting fact,
which I have not seen alluded to before, that
the temperature of the tableland differs much
more from that of the coast in winter than in
summer. For example, taking a particular
instance, a change from Sydney to Mount Vic-
toria would give the visitor in summer an
average temperature 6 degs. lower, but in winter
of no less than 12 degs. lower.
With the view of gaining precise information
on the effect of the variations in these divisions


on that great destroyer of human life—phthisis
—I first of all grouped together the population
estimated for the years 1895, 1896, and 1897 for
the registration districts,
using
the facts given
in the annual volumes of vital statistics pub-
fished by the Registrar-General,
and
then
arrived at the mean. A similar course
was
followed as regards the deaths
registered from
phthisis in the same districts for these years.

will be seen that
result of the calcula-
tions shows that the deaths per 10,000 living are
less than half in the tableland compai’ed with
that of the coast; also that the western dis-
trict is less favourable than the high central
one. The Hawkesbury and Nepean district
has been isolated, as it includes, with Camden,
Penrith, and other places, only a few feet above
the sea level a number of towns on the moun-
tains, including those on the western line as far
as Katoomba.
It does not appear that there are any con-
siderations which can very materially affect the
main results arrived at. The figures for the
coast include the great public asylums for
aged people at Parramatta, Liverpool, and Rook-
wood. Probably the majority of the persons
living in them have been drawn from the

coast districts, but were the deaths from phthisis
in these institutions altogether eliminated it
would only reduce the deaths per 10,000 from
9.5 to 8.2, making the rate still double that of
the tableland. The question then arises as to
whether the distribution of the population in
the three divisions is so different as respects
age, that it would considerably interfere with
the comparisons made. I found that light
could be obtained on this point from statistics
given in the last census report (1891). From
returns there given I have calculated the per-
centage of the population in the respective
districts of the colony at the ages during which
consumption is a prominent factor in the general
death rate, and also before and after those
ages. Broadly speaking, phthisis causes many
deaths at all ages from fifteen to sixty-five.
It is much less noticed at the higher ages, very
much on account of the increased destructive-
ness of other diseases. The distribution of
the population during the consumptive ages
and before and after was found to be as
follows: —
Percentage op Population at Different Age
Periods in Main Divisions op Colony.


As regards the figures for the tableland and
the coast the statistics show that the percentage
of persons exposed to risk of death from con-
sumption does not materially vary. The western
district has a greater proportion of the popula-
tion at the central period of life, and this
partially, but only partially, accounts for
the deaths there from consumption being
relatively more numerous than in the table-
land.
There is still substantial evidence that the
tableland is superior to the western plains for
consumptives. The advantage of the drier
air of the west is more than counterbalanced
by the beneficial effects of atmosphere at
high altitudes. This conclusion is the more
worthy of notice at the present time, as it is
proposed to erect a Consumptives’ Home
in the west, whereas these figures point to the
greater suitability of such a site as the one
lately chosen at Yass'.
We have now to refer to the important class
of respiratory diseases, prominent among which
are bronchitis and pneumonia. Proceeding
on similar lines to those followed in connection
with phthisis, I have tabulated the deaths
from this group in the respective registration
districts for each of the years 1895, 1896, and
1897, and calculated the mean. The following
are the figures:—

It will be noticed that the effect of the climate
on this class of diseases is entirely different to
the case of phthisis. For diseases of the respira-
tory system the coast is best, mainly on account
of the greater equability of the temperature.
The further from the coast the greater the daily
and yearly variations of the thermometer, and
the greater the mortality. The great fact is
here shown that while the average of deaths out
of 10,000 living in the colony is only 14.3, that
for England is no less than 37.6.
In a change of climate, such as coming from
an average English town to the tableland of
New South Wales, we have undoubtedly a
powerful remedial agent for chest complaints,
and one, moreover, for which no satisfactory
substitute exists. The earlier the stage of the
complaint the more satisfactory will be the re-
sult of the change. To persons predisposed to
phthisis, or who have had one or two slight
occurrences of haemoptysis, or premonitory in-
dications of some other lung trouble, our
mountain territory offers its restorative in-
fluences. They can come here with the great
advantage of being able to follow the same
vocations they have done at home, surrounded
by people of the same race and language, and
living under the same flag. If these facilities
were absent, it would in many instances bar
the possibility of their availing themselves of
the better climate, and consequently their days
would be shortened. It would be of value to
ascertain, were it feasible, the number now


living in the colony who arrived here with a
well-defined constitutional defect, but who
have engaged in business life, and at the same
time regained health and vigour. Probably all
of us can easily recall having met those who
have had this experience. There can be no
doubt that a number of lives would be saved
annually if the good points of our mountain
climate were better known at home.
It appears that in proportion more males
than females come to Australia for the benefit
of their health. Of the recorded deaths from
consumption in New South Wales in 1897 of
those who were born in the United Kingdom,
274, or 72 per cent., were males, and 109, or 28
per cent., were females. This is a decidedly
higher ratio of male lives than is obtained if
the deaths of the two sexes are taken from all
causes of death, the figures in the latter case
being 63 per cent, and 37 per cent, respectively.
Probably young women frequently shrink from
undertaking alone a long voyage and residence
in a new and distant land. Perhaps also, amid
the stern realities of life, male lives being the
better producers, are taken more care of.
As regards respiratory diseases, the climate
of the colony is very favourable. The disparity
between the mortality here and at home in the
case of infantile deaths being most striking,
children in England subject to bronchitis would
have a much better prospect of getting rid of
the tendency to that complaint in Australia.
This might be the determining cause of many


families coming here were the superiority of
our climate in this regard more known. When
it is remembered that respiratory diseases are a
most considerable factor in the total death rate,
that in the United Kingdom they carry off
annually the vast number of 130,000 persons,
and that the mortality here is less than one-half
what it is there, the enormous importance of
the climatic influence needs no further com-
ment.
With respect to other diseases, the pure air
and genial weather of Xew South W ales will
in many instances have a very beneficial effect.
Their influences, however, are not so powerful
as in those I have mentioned, and they are
hardly amenable to statistical investigation.
They come more exclusively within the sphere
of the physician to determine and explain. In
our splendid climate we have what may fairly
be regarded as one of the resources of the
colony, one, moreover, which is beyond the
vicissitudes of trade or the fluctuations of
tariffs, but, nevertheless, one which will per-
ennially enhance the welfare of the people.
