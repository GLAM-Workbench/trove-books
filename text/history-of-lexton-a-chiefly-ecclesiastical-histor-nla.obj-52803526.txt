HISTORY OF LEXTON
A brief History, chiefly Ecclesiastical, of the Village of
Eurobank, now the Township of Lexton, from the earliest periods
down to the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of the Presbyterian
Church at that place. November 15th & 16th 1908, By a resident
of upwards of 53 years standing.
By vay of preface, I think it but right that a few words
should be said as to the origin of the village and its founders,
and that anything which may proceed from my pen may be depended on
being correct*
David Anderson, a great chartist, one of the founders, was
born in the ancient and historic town of Dunfermline, Fifeshlre,
Scotland in the year 1807, and in due time learned the Mason trade,
and went to Edinburgh to work at his trade, where he soon found that
the dust from the Craiglelth stone did not agree with his chest, which
was naturally weak, and was susceptible to pulmonary diseases* On
that account he had to abandon his trade, and in the later thirties
was admitted into the Glasgow Post Office as a letter carrier, and
was there for several years. %t instead of his trouble leaving
him, it gradually grew worse, and he was laid up with a very
severe illness, burst a blood vessel, and on his recovery he was ad-
vised by his medical attendant, the late celebrated Laurie, to
leave the Home Land aid try his fortune in Port Philip. N.S. Wales,
Australia, which was considered a great feat in those days. Acting
on Dr. Laurie*s advice, he, along with his wife and three little
boys sailed in the good ship "Robert*'Bon”from Greenock on the Clyde,
and landed at Melbourne in about U-l. but their youngest child died
during the voyage of nearly six months. They had endured con-
siderable hardships while on board, and on reaching Melbourne they
had a lot more to put up with, as that place, as well as the whole
of Port Philip Settlement was at a very low ebb, provisions scarce
and dear, houses the same, and as Mr. Anderson said in his first
letter home "little better than plgstyes.”
He soon got a billet with a settler at Moonee Ponds, stayed
there for some time, and on recruiting his strength a bit, he got
a Job at the building of the first Bank, and Goal and some other
notable places, and while so engaged he met with one William Miller,
Mason, from Dunnichen, a village in Plrfarshire, Scotland. After
working some time together as they saved some money and
decided to enter into partnership, and go hawking. So they obtained
a large bullock dray fitted up like a store, and put ina general
stock of goods, mostly supplied by the late Charles Williamson,
Drapcrji Collins Street, who latOr on Joined the firm and continued
a partner until the end. Anderson & Hiller travelled over a large
track (300 miles) of country embracing the Pyrenees Mountains &
Ranges. After one or two trips, and having had a good look at the
country, and observing the Junction of the roads from Pt. Fairy,
Wimmera, Richardson & Avoca districts at Lexton, they decided that
it would be a good locality to start a place of business on, and
ultimately settled on what is known as Burnbank Creek, during the
winter of lBb-5, and at the end of the same year, opened the Burnbank
and the Pyrenees Store, also a Blacksmith*& Wheelwrlght*s shop and
other useful works, and did a good business for many years. I first
heard of Burnbank about the middle of May through a letter
from the late Mr. Anderson to his sister, who happened to be my
mother, %*ho lived for upwards of 70 years in the town of Kinrop, and
died in her 92nd year. From that letter I got the particulars as
to the foundation of Burnbank, which was named so in remembrance of
a suburb of Glasgow, where Mr. Anderson used to go fishing In his
spare hours. In the same letter he asked father and mother them


they would let their oldest son, David, come out t©Australia. At that
time David was In the middle of his apprenticeship at the blacksmlth-
ing trade. He sailed for Melbourne In April reached Eurobank
in August of the same year, and found his uncle on his death-bed,
after being on a six months trip to Sydney for the benefit of his health
which proved of no avail, and. he died on September 12th, aged h 2
years. My borther on writing home, by way of Church news, said
that there had been a minister there, but he had left, and that
church service was conducted in Aunt*s and the court house by a young
man who had been bred to the Ministry in Wales, but had come to
Australia in search of better health, and was then acting as Tutor
in the Anderson family and for some others*
The young man was Mr. Vftne Wern, son of the great Welsh Con-
gregational preacher of that name, and was for many years on our
House Mission Staff, after being some time Head Teacher in the
"Common School 11 here. . v ” , ;
At the tifie Mr. Williams was first at Burnbank, the Rev,
Thos. Hastle of Buninyong, 36 miles away, had the oversight of this
place, and I am told, came here occasionally bn ministerial duties.
I may Just mention that I had never hear much of our first minister
Rev. McQillvary, only that he had been here and gone. Now I come
to something personal.
1 sailed in the good ship "Salem” from Liverpool on Feby 19th
and after a flar voyage of 8U- days, duly arrived at Melbourne on May
16th 1855* After spending a few days among some of my friends, I ;
started for Burnbank, or Lexton walking most of the \iay. After
spending two days at Learmonth, not named so at that time, where
the people were Just putting in their first crops, I reached texton
on Sunday 27th of the same month. * The people were Just gathering
about the door of a wooden building which was at that time used as
a court house, as well as a meeting house for Divine Worship, and
rather remarkable that the first manl should meet was our late
Minister, the Rev. Alexander Adam, who appeared at the doorway and’
spoke to some Sunday scholars in these words "Come all in young
folks, the service will begin in a few minutes". Of course I Just
passed on th my destination nearer the centre of the township, but
I never forgot Mr. Adam*s first words. ' Next Sabbath, along with
a friend, I went to the Kirk for the first tin© in Victoria. A
few Sundays before leaving the Auld Kintra, I attended a Free Kirk
in the highlands of Perthshire when I saw what I consider a rather
uncouth congregation, most of the-people being clad in homespun
Sodden Greys, the Precenter with a rough grey coat, big red neckchlef
and one on the palm of his hand, on which rested his Psalm Book.
But what I saw at Lexton put the Highlands right in the shade, the
people being clad in all the colours of the rainbow, several of the
men having on checked Jumpers. There was a good table end chair
for the Minister, but the forms were made out of rough slabs with
round sticks for legs. In the back corner beside a smouldering
fire, sat a blind man and his dog. They had been invited in for
shelter* Weill that may seem correct enough. When the people
had assembled, two mounted policmen in full uniform came in and
sat down. 1 did not know \fhether to be scared or the reverse.
At length the Rev. Adam rose and gave out a part of the 36th Psalm
from the S?th verse. "They mercy Lord Is in the heavens." There
being no Precentor, the Minister acted as such himself, and a fine
sweet voice he had. He began that grand old tune French- now
known as Dundee in our more modern books, but before half the
people had Joined in, the dog in the corner struck up in quite a minor
key, and set up such a melancholy howl and kept at it, as I never
before or since heard. On reaching the end of the verse the
Minister intimated that we would sing no more under existing circum-
stances. He read the other Psalms. So ended my first Sunday
at the Kirk in Lexton. As lamin a kind of humourous strain or
mood, I think that I may as well tell you of the first wedding that
I had to do with here. About the end of the Summer *56, I was
Contd. HISTORY -OF- LEXTON


taking a stroll one evening after tea, and nearing the house of my
aunt, Mrs* Anderson, who had retired from business and had built a
private residence for herself and family, I saw her, two other
ladies and a gentleman coming out at the door, and. on meeting me
Auntie turned back and unlocked her door and whispered to me that
"this was a young couple, who along with the gentleman’s mother,
had come some 150 miles from an up-country sheep station to get -
married, and they were on the way to get the Rev, Mr. Adams to per-
form the ceremony. But Mr. Adam had some time before left the
township and had gone to live in the manse, two miles distant, on
Dr’s Creek, so that was a good step, and the house repairers being
at work, and everything in confusion, the Minister, glad to get in
to a quiet corner, had gone to bed by the time the wedding party
had got there. However, the Minister was not disagreeable, and
got up and soon made the young folks happy by uniting them in the
Holy Bonds of Matrimony. The party got back to Lexton where I
was keeping house for them, about 11 p.m. After drinking health
and happiness to all concerned, we all retired. So ended ray first
wedding in Victoria. , V
Now I must go back a bit after this disgression. When I arrived
here I found the Rev. Alexander Adam already settled in the lexton
charge and preaching here every Sunday morning, excepting one
Sunday in two months, when he had to go to Woodlands, and was
obliged to go on Saturday afternoon. The other stations were nearer,
so he rode out to them after the morning service, and preached in
the evenings. Our first services here were held in what was then
called the Court House, which had originally been built on Crown
Lands as a store, and is now being used as a stable at our local
Hotel. Towards the end of *55 another store, with dwelling attached
became vacant. It was more central and convenient to the public,
so it was rented, to be used as a Church and Day school, and was
fitted up with suitable seats and desks, ant? pulpit, and was in
bur possession until we got into our own building. John Wedherspoon
presiding at a stall at our Bazaar in *59 along with Mrs. Weir#
In the early part of *55 business was very flat and lang-
uid ing, but in September the Fiery Creek Rush broke out, which set
things moving at a great rate, and the result was the formation of
Main Lead, Raglan and Beaufort. Most of the subscribers to the
Lexton charge resided in these localities, as it was found that a
large proportion of our Minister’s time was expected to be spent
there, and of course there was less for Lexton, which consequently
suffered. A word in passing. I may say that our present Precentor
began during the year *56 to lend a helping hand to the Minister *
in conducting the singing, and early in the year *57 took the matter
entirely into his own hands, and still continues to do so, He was
not exactly a new chum in that line, as he had had considerable ex-
perience as an amateur in some of the old Antiburger Kirks in Scot-
land, and on coming here, took up the job without being naked.
During the yeatf *56 steps were taken to bring our day school under .
the Denominational Board, and a committee was appointed for that
end. I have no official record, but I think the following names will
be found correct. The Re#. Alexander Adam, Geo. Watson,
Thomas Clapperton, Walter Fairlie, David Gray, Andrew Wallace, and
John Mylrea (not sure). About the beginning of this same year,
our Minister got possession of the Manse on Doctor’s Creek and
lived there with his family for some ten years. Then he went to
Beaufort. The old Manse and paddock was rented to a neighbouring
farmer,, and was accidentally burned to the ground a few years later.
There is no house there now, but the land is let and is a consider-
able help to our Stipend Fund.
About the beginning of the year .’57, steps were taken for
the build in:

of a church and\ vestry, to\be also used as a day school. A con- ,

Government. A building committee almost identical with that of
the school was formed to>see\the works carried into effect* A bricl
building was decided on, \all materials to be provided by the
Committee* Tenders ye£ftcalled for labor only, and two offers
were sent in, one being £BO, the other £l6O, the one too low and
the other too £l2o being reckoned by competent judges to be
a fair price. The committeein a great strait, but accepted

our materials proved to be of inferior quality, and the workmen / /
incompetent and, unscrupulous, about scamping their workv~'Bnd their
extra charges, and, long before the building was finished, it was
beginning to give way and part of it had to be taken down and re-
built* The result was that the Lexton Church got the name of
being the ugliest building in the township, and was continually
in want of repairs. . However, the place. as it-was, got
finished and was opehed for public worshipv/ph November loth 1857 by

quite a success* A few months later on, It was,found necessary to
brace up our building with planks along under the eaves and four
tie rods from side to side, which cost about £l5 and that added to
the debt already on the CJhurch. >
It was decided to get |up a Bazaar of all kind of work 'bad things,
to clear off the same* The Bazaar duly came off in tbe\summer of
*59 and was held in the Assembly Room connected withi/the &exton

about £BO was realised which cleared away the debt, to comme-

Our first Communion took place on June 26th, Rev. A. Adams
officiating and Rev* Geo. Kackie preached the Preparation Sermon on
the Thursday evening before. There were 18 communicants present.
In July *6O our Road Board was formed, and in August our
Cemetery Trustees were appointed after long delay. Four years later
on the Road Board was formed into a Council. After Mr. & Mrs. Crowther
had been here for some time, it was found that there were several
upgrown lads that were rather far advanced for our day school and three
families joined together and succeeded in securing the services of our
old friend Mr. Wm. Werne, our tutor of 10 years before, who had during ;
these intervening years been employed as a store-keeper at Navarre,
but was about retiring from business. He proved of great service
to the church for several years by taking up some of our now many
vacant Sundays, end helping Mr. & Mrs. Crowther in the Sunday school.
In *6l Mr. Crowther having gained promotion, left for a better situ-
ation, and we were not so fortunate in our next couple* In *62
the Heals Common School Act came into force in September. Just
before that date the Wesleyan Methodists started operations here.
Our 3rd Tea Meeting was held in the summer of *63, the Revs. ;
Hugh McKall from N.S.Wales. Wra. Henderson, A. Adam and others taking
part. In July the Wesleyan Church was opened, the Rev., now
Dr. Fitchett, preaching the first sermon in the forenoon and Rev.

transacted business in the Manse on Dr*s Crook. (There were no
more Tea Meetings held for the long period of 36 years). Hr* Weir

In *66 t'# passed over to the great majority on July Uth,
aged 71, and about the end of the same year Rev. A. Adam left the
Manse on Doctor’s Creek and went to the new Manse at Beaufort.
107 nothing remarkable happened. *6B our old respected mother of
Burnbank, Mrs. Janet Anderson, passed away tinder rather sad circum-
stances, on Feby, 22nd, aged w. During this year the people about
expressed a desire to have a married couple in the day school, Mr•
Williams being a single man. He resigned and made arrangements for
getting on our Home Mission Staff, and left the school about the
beginning of September, and although paying us an occasional visit,
was pretty well clear of Lexton. - *69, 70 & 71 were uneventful
years in our church, so I pass on to * 72, when, owing to family
matters. Mr. James Robertson, our Collector d; Treasurer, was obliged
to visit Scotland, and along; with several members of his family,
left early in March in the S.S. "Great Britain". Before leaving
here Mr. James Gray was appointed Acting Collector & Treasurer
during Mr. Robertson’s absence, but has attended to these duties
ever since. On June sth old Thomas Robertson of Mt. Mitchell
passed over to the majority at the advanced age of 87. 1 He was con-
sidered to be the pioneer of our Parish, was one of our first com-
municants, and long erne of the trustees of our church property, and
his descendants are our main supporters, v :

operations here, hsd the use of our church for their first service,
and then got the use of the court house until their own church was
opened. . ■, V' ; r

In the beginning of *7** the State School Act came In force,
and we were paid 30/“ per month for the u?e of ovt churchbuilding by
the Education Dept, for 17 months. May 23/1875* The Anglican
church was opened and the new State school on the following month.
We now had the church to ourselves, having got rid of the day school*
For some years wo were only having service once a month and then at timed
a vacant Sunday. Our church was in a very dilapidated state, and
what do do with it was the question. It was not worth repairing, and
some considered that it would be wasting money to build a new church
for one service a month. But there was one connected with the con-
gregation who said within himself, why not g**t another service?
and quietly he approached our minister on the subject, who replied
that an afternoon service could be given, as a deserted digging could
bo given up. Our subscribers were next sounded as to giving a little
more money, and allwere agreeable, and.in the first week of Jany *76
our minister was written to asking him when he came on the 3rd Sunday
to give us a sermon on Christian duties in general and church building
in particular, which he accordingly did In his very best style, from
the Ist chapter of Haggai. Then he asked the people to look round
and see if the discourse would not apply to ourselves, the place being
hanging in rags, at the close of the service, the Minister daid, I
have two intimations to make, that on the Ist Sunday of February at
3*30 in the afternoon a service would be conducted, and to be continued
on the Ist Sunday of each month until further notice, and that a meet-
ing of the congregation to be held next evening, to take into consider-
ation the state of the church building. The meeting was duly held and
it was resolved, that the old building be taken down to the foundation
(that and the floor were considered quite good), also that the old
pulpit and precentor*s desk might be used in the new which
was proposed to be erected. A building committee was to raise
or get subscriptions and see the work executed. It was estimated that
£5OO would be required. The collectors went to work with a will,
so that by the beginning of *77 the committee considered they were
in a position to be able to start operations, and instructed the late
Mr. Jackson of Beaufort to prepare plans and specifications for the
proposed works, and designed the present fchurch, which is neat, comm-
odious and substantial.
To begin with, the committee ordered 20,000 Ist class bricks
to be made and burned, the old bricks to be used inside the walls.
Tenders were then called for the rest of the materials and labour,
excepting the seats, which were to be made by separate contract.
Only one tender came in, that or V/m. Phelan of Talbot, which, being
considered reasonable- was accepted, and on the 17th of June we met
fear the in our old church. Our Anglican friends having of-
fered us the use of their church during our re-building operations,
we assembled in their church on Sunday afternoon, July Ist,
(We gave them a donation of £5), I took up the collection that day .
for the first time, by going round with the plate, which we found a .
great improvement, and we have continued to do so up to the present
time, Mr. Phelan, being an able and energetic contractor, found
Ist class materials and workmen, who under the superintendence of
James Gray, who had been appointed clerk of works, and having favour-
able weather got so well on with the works, the same contractor having
got the job of making our new seats, made after sample seen at the
Primitive Methodist Church, Talbot, said to be the best in the district,
that a month before the time specified in the contract, our new church
was finished, but was allowed several weeks to dry. Arrangements were
made for the re-opening on November 18th, that day 20 years from the
opening of the original building, The Rev. Thos. McKenzie Fraser of
Geelong conducting the service. In the morning he preached an able
discourse from these words. Ex. 20.2 I *." "In all places where I
record my name, I will come unto thee and I will bless thee" and went \
on to prove that neither place nor name mattered much, but in the
truth that was proclaimed, and that while this pulpit lasted, you may .
depend that no uncertain sound would be heard there-front, , In the
evening he preached a still more remarkable sermon from Judges 7 & 7,
HISTORY OF lEXTOH


from Judges 7& £• "By the three hundred men that lapped, I vlll save
you” and in introducing his subject he compared the Israelites in
Gideon’s time to the Scots in the days of Wm. Wallace, but the suffering
of the Israelites were intensified in a far higher degree. Then he
spoke of the qualifications required for the proper performance of any
duties, that there was no Instance on record of a soul being converted
without human agency, and that these agents required certain qualific-
ations, that these could only be acquired by training and so on.
That sermon had been remembered by many who were then little
boys, the talk of the soldiers and battles suiting them. The collec-
tions that day were £9*ls* 0.
On balancing accounts, we found that after everything was
paid, we had over S7O in hand, and we resolved to proceed with the
fencing of the church grounds, 2 acres, without delay, and that was
accomplished by the end of April *7B. There being still a balance of
£3«10. 2* in the Building Committee’s hands, it was paid into the
general funds of the congregation, and the church got a coat of paint
costing £*+.l2. 6. at Easter time *79. *7B Psalms & Hymns were intro-
duced. ,
About this time, our Precen tor who had hitherto sung by way
of his subscription to the Stipend Fund, applied to be paid a salary,
and he would pay a subscription, so the committee agreed to pay him
£6 per year and he gives £h per year to the Stipend Funds for himself
and family, and some of his family keep the church clean free. *B2

to, the tables were removed and the stage put in piece. The concert
or after meeting was begun by the Rev. C, Neville taking the chair
and asking the people to 3 oi E in singing two verses of the 100th Psalm.
Then the Rev. Mr. miley of earmonth to engage in prayer, after which
the chairman proceeded to give a history of our Lexton church from
its very earliest days. The Rev. L. HcGillvary having settled at
Burnbank In 18**8, he belonged originally to the Relief Church and
that body had united in ’**7 with the United Secession Church, and
became a part of the United Presbyterian. He did not stay long
here, as we find him at Port Fairy in ,l *9.
Contd. HISTORY OF LEXTON


Then we had a Mr* (Anglican) for about a year. The
Rev. Thos* Hastle of Buninyong having the Lexton district in his charge,
and came on ministerial visits occasionally up to the time that Rev*
A* Adam was settled here, about *s3f and was here for close on h 6
years*,
The Chairman then gave a brief sketch of the early days of
the charge, and pioneers of the district who were the main supporters
of our minister* It give some of the names of the original subscribers
to the stipend funds. Messrs. Wilson, Clapperton. R. ®imson, Wsn,
Lewis, A* Russell, C* Williamson, J. Slmsoh, Robertson & Sons Mr* Affleck
Bradshaw and others, but to James Gray, his wife and family must be
given the honor of keeping the Presbyterian flag flying at Lexton.
He commenced leading the singing in 1856 and still fills the Precentor*s
Desk* Mr. Legg, Smiley, and Barber then gave suitable addresses*
The Rev. John Walker gave his famous lecture on Presbyterianism in ;
many lands, and kept the audience convulsed with laughter| but all
through the lectruct was very instructive, and the whole proceedings
were enlivened with sweet strains of music contributed by Miss Allen
from Ballarat, Kiss Jean Rorke and a quartette from Beaufort. The
local Precentor was not in good form having a bad cold, but at the
same time he was kept quite busy. *
The whole affair may be pronounced a success, and resulted
in a credit balance being left in the hands of the committee, amount-
ing to £l5. 9* o*j which they have decided to expand on repairing
and painting their church property.
Appendix* I would Just make a few remarks as to the origin of this
rather scattered manuscript. A few weeks before our Diamond Jubilee
Celebrations came on, our present minister, the Rev* C. Neville, who
has not been long amongst us, asked me few particulars
concerning our congregation, so that he would have something to make
a speech out of* Hence, I have not said much about our other churches
or general history of the place.
