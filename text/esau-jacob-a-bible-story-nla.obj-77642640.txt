A BIBLE STORY.
A brace of sons old Isaac owned —
The elder, brave and free,
Was always on the hunting ground,
When not upon the spree ;
The younger quite a different boy,
The most discreet of lads :
So Jacob was his mother’s joy,
And Esau was his dad’s.
Now, Isaac being old and blind,
And imbecile almost,
It came to pass, as we shall find,
Rebecca ruled the roast.
Poor Esau often had to want—
She kept the pantry keys,
And never gave him half a slant
To steal the bread and cheese.
But prudent Jacob undertook —
For tucker’s sake, or pelf—
To stay at home and help to cook,
And also help himself.
Now Esau was afield one day,
And hunting deer or hare—
Tho’ which the history does not say,.
But he found neither there.
Returning—hungry, we suppose —
As through the house he went,
He in the kitchen popped his nose,
Attracted by the scent.
Jacob had made pease-porridge hot,.
The smell of which was grand,
And so poor starving Esau thought
Relief was just at hand.
But Jacob said“ It all is mine ;
You shall not touch the pot,
Unless your birthright you resign—
Then you can have the lot.”
And what could starving Esau do,
Just in the hour of need ?
The same, I think, my friends, as you—
Cave in, and have a feed.


Now Isaac, finding that his race
On earth was nearly run.
Called Esau to his sleeping place,
And thus addressed his son :
4i Go take thy bow and quiver, lad,
And slay a deer or two ;
Make after that—but not too fat —
A bit of Irish stew.
" I’ll bless thee then in herd and flock,
Thy brother’s lord thou’lt be ”
Said Esau, “ That’s the way to talk,
That suits me to a T.”
VIII.
Rebecca, always on the prowl,
Heard every word that passed—
To Jacob she narrates the whole,
And Jacob stood aghast.
M Haste to the flock and fetch a kid,
And I shall quickly stew it 5
Now, Jacob, do as you are bid,
Or else you’ll dearly rue it.”
Jacob, who was an arrant sneak,
And timorous withal,
Replied, My voice is apt to squeak,
Not gruff like his at all 5
Besides, with hair, he’s like a bear,
But soft and smooth my skin.
He’ll twig the trick.”—“ Oh, fiddlestick 5
On my head be the sin.”
Rebecca made a splendid stew,
Delightful to the taste,
And on the hands of her young Jew
Some kid-skin she had placed 5
And on her neck she fixed the hair,
For Esau’s coat she rah —
Away then went this precious pair
To cheat a blind old man.
And Isaac wakened up with glee,
’Twas the hungry hour of noon;
And how the dickens, son,” said he,
Found you the grub so soon.”
“ The Lord, my father, sent it soon ;
Old Isaac answered not,.
But being hungry grabbed the spoon,
And eat a frightful lot.
And then they plied him in his bunk
With claret, port, and sherry ;
We won’t say that a saint got drunk,
But—-simply—he was merry.
■


XIII.
He placed his hand on Jacob’s neck,
Detecting not the sell,
And said, “ You have got Jacob’s squeak,
But Esau's hide I smell.”
He told him to be rich and great,
He blessed and gave him all;
And at the base impostor’s feet
His brother was to fall.
XIY.
And God allowed the full amount
Of blessings which were given,
Which proves that honesty don’t count
In either earth or heaven.
Now Jacob scarce had left the bed,
When Esau came there too,
And he had wine and he had bread,
And a genuine mess of stew.
“ And will my father rise and eat,
And bless his first-born now.” —
Old Isaac turned white as the sheet,
And answered, “ Who art thou ?”
“ I am thine Esau, and have here
The meat which thou dost like;
I never see thee look so queer,
What’s up with thee, old Ike ?
XVI.
Old Isaac, gasping for relief
To stomach and to brains,
Let out a dreadful yell of grief,
And rage and colic pains.
“ Who was it counterfeited thee P
Who did it, and who durst ?
And made me swill till I am ill,
And feel about to burst ?
XVII.
“ Thy brother Jacob —that young Jew —
With wheedlings and caressings,
Has crammed me full of Irish stew —
I’ve crammed him full of blessings.”
Loud and exceeding bitterly
Cried Esau in his grief—
“ Hast thou no blessing left for me,
My father and my chief ?”
XVIII.
“ Thy brother he hath taken all—
He came with subtlety;
That blessing I may not recall,
What can I do for thee.”
’Twas little now he had to give,
But what he had he gave ;
“ Thou, Esau, by thy sword shall live,
Be fortunate and brave.”


XIX.
And furthermore the blessing spake—
“ ’Twill come to pass at last.
When thou art strong, from off thy neck
Thy brothers yoke thou’lt cast.”
’Tis difficult to tell in verse
This touching interview,
Which Isaac wound up with a curse—
For he cursed the Irish stew.
Now in the well did Esau swear
His brother he would souse,
So mother sent her husband’s heir
To Uncle Laban’s house;
Away went Jacob then by night,
Consoled by buns and cheese,
And when at length he saw daylight
He felt more at his ease.
XXI.
A troop of angels also came
To cheer him in his grief,
Who said Q-ehennah was their home,
And Beelzebub their chief.
Now Jacob near a well did pass,
Where flocks were drinking water,
And thither came a pretty lass—
Old Laban’s youngest daughter.
XXII.
He said —" Love, I’m your aunty’s son,”
Took one kiss (or a dozen) —
Away she ran,
And told Laban
She was kissed by such a nice young man.
Who said he was her cousin.
XXIII.
Laban came out and took him in—
He was good at that we know ;
For not only those of his kith and kin,
But any man
Would that same Laban
Take in, were he friend or foe.
XXIV.
To win fair Rachel for his bride
Did Jacob undertake
With Laban seven years to ’bide —
And all for her sweet sake.
• He tended both the flocks and herds,
In weather calm or blowy,
Fed pigs and all the farm-yard birds—
Was wood and water Joey.


XXY.
And when the seventh year was out,
Then Laban made a feast.
Inviting all the folks about—
Some four score souls at least.
When next morn's sun well nigh arose,
He Jacob leads to bed,
Who wished to elevate his toes,
And stand upon his head.
XXVI.
He sobered soon at what he spied
Within the nuptial bed ;
He glanced one moment at his bride,
Then started up and fled.
For pretty Rachel was not there,
But in her place a fright—
An ugly devil with red hair,
Pug nose and sandy blight.
XXVII.
He bawled for Rachel. Laban said —
“ My son it cannot be ;
The elder sister first must wed,
The younger after she.
I promise when this week is o’er
You shall have Rachel too,
If you will serve for seven years more—
Which he agreed to do.
XXVIII.
Brown sheep and speckled goats, we read,
Were Jacob’s own to be —
With speckled rods he made them breed
Their colors constantly.
At length he said to Rachel—“ Spouse,
Not much at ease I feel;
I think we’ll hook-it from this house—
Is there anything to steal P
XXIX.
" Yes, father’s images, my dear,
Four-and-twenty carat gold ;
And oh, he’s such a lot to spare—
Why leave them here to mould ?
They’re here and there, and everywhere,
From basement to the garrets —
u My dearest wife, star of my life,
Do steal that bunch of carrots .”
XXX.
Now, Laban being not at home,
The time was very fit,
So Jacob gathered all his own,
And much of Laban’s kit.
And flocks and herda, and farm-yard birds,
The girl with sandy blight,
■Camels tall and children small—
And stole away by night.


- j
XXXI.
When Laban reached his own domain,.
You bet there was a scrimmage 5
He mounted in hot haste again—
He was robbed of every image.
The object of his haste was plain—
You can guess it, I suppose —
He wished his treasures to regain,
And pull his nephew’s nose.
XXXII.
But Laban had a warning sent,
Which Jacob did concern —
His figure head thou shan’t affront,
Nor meddle with his stern.
So when he overtook the train,
He said —“ My heart it grieves
To think we’ll ne’er embrace again ”
And then he searched the thieves.
XXXIII.
Fair Bachel, from her camel, said—
“ My father and my friend,
I feel so sick, I’m much afraid
I dare not now descend ;
For I am certain I’d be worse
Should I attempt to move —
Else had I hastened down, of course*
To shew respect and love.”
XXXIY.
Old Laban searched for half a day*
Without the least success ;
At length he had to go away,
Obtaining no redress.
He mourned for many a day, alack*
So much his Gods he wanted —
’Twixt Bachel and her camel’s back
She had the carats planted.
XXXV.
Now Jacob found that he must go
Through injured Esau’s land,
Be, therefore, parts his train in two,
So that, you understand,
Should Esau’s forces fall on one
The other would get clear
And scarce was this manoeuvre done
When Jacob’s spies appear,
XXXVI.
And said —“ Lord Esau moves this way*
With at least four hundred men.”
Jacob took gems, which came, they say.
From a place called Brummagem ;
And all the scrubbers he possessed,
Which were not fit to drive,
He to the spies said — u Do your best
To deliver them alive.”


XXXVII.
>
Behind his present Jacob crept
With cringing fear and hate,
When in the van a dust-cloud swept—
Soon he will know his fate ;
For in the centre of his band,
Which neared the paltry thief,
Bode Esau, every inch a man —
The lordly robber chief.
XXXYIIL
Jacob, who gammons glad suprise,
Half dead with fright the while,
Applies an onion to his eyes,
And weeps in copious style;
Drawing near with many a quake,
At Esau’s feet he fell—
" My lord, a little present take;
I hope you’re pretty well.”
XXXIX.
Before him Esau sees the knave
Who blighted his young life —
Through him was he an outlaw drave r
To live by war and strife.
He has the traitor safe at last,
For to his feet he crept,
How acted then this wild outcast ?
He kissed the rogue and wept.
The present Esau would not take
(His loss was not severe),
And Jacob doth a promise make
To visit him at Seir.
The brothers then once more salute,
And Jacob lifts his head
Like one, who at the gallows, foot,
Has had his pardon read.
And blessed by God, approved of man,
The undisputed heir
Has flocks and herds, wives, children, lands—
But which do you prefer ?
The outlaw living by his sword,
Great hearted, princely chief ;
Or Jacob, favored of the Lord,
The swindling, lying thief.
