ON THE OCCASION OP THE LAYING OP THE FOUNDATION-STONE
OF THE
STATUE OF HER GRACIOUS MAJESTY THE QUEEN,
THE
ROYAL PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR.
[3 August, 1881.]
HENRY HALLORAN, Esq., C.M.G.
She sits upon a distant throne, in the far land of the North,
Where ocean speaks in thunder tone, and tempests wander forth ;
A land where men of might abide, and women fair as day,
?Midst memories of renown and pride, which may not pass away,
And where in every loyal breast She?s honored and revered,
Too mighty to be unconfessed, too righteous to be feared.
Here in a land of summer blooms and skies of stainless blue,
Each loyal subject aye assumes to love Her as is due ;
And feeling Freedom?s breath of light around him and above,
To honor Her is his delight, to name Her is to love ;
Not with the false regard of slaves, who freedom have not known,
But with a pride of soul that braves all traitors to the Throne.
Spring puts her timid fingers forth, for still tho? bright ?tiscold,
And blossoms linger yet;
The sap thro? vines is rising, for the mid sun now is bold,
And darts his flame-shafts thro? both rind and mould ;


And the great night dews whet
The sense of life with influence untold.
If dumb things?trees and flowers?
Wake to the touch of Nature?s quickening powers,
And love and yearn ;
Shall we not cherish, in these hearts of ours,
Some great awakening sense
Of what we all enjoy,
And each in turn
Offer his thanks for Heaven?s unbounded grace,
That doth so well dispense
The flowers of Freedom in the lap of Joy ?
Here where Her Royal Consort?s Statue stands
Above the passing throng
All the day long,
Uttering His mild commands ;
Here, where the multitude,
On festal days,
Looks up and says
?Albert the Good,?
And each in spirit prays, ?
? Good is to be Great;
? Such be my child, 0 God ! whatever be my fate?
Here place we now
The wedded statue to complete the scene ;
Here, e?er we bow
Within each neighbouring shrine,
Place we our Queen ;
And each in silence vow
? ? Her God to serve, for Her God shall be mine,
?And She my Queen.?


With what a noble confidence She sends
Her children?s children to our distant shore ;
She knows that we are friends,
And faithful to the death would make amends
For what we still deplore.
And so, in wandering o?er the turbulent main,
The Royal Princes, on this happy day,
Are here their parts to play,
And treasured in our hearts shall they remain.
Then give them welcome, ye who stand around ;
Ye who have honor in your silver hair,
Stainless of name, and righteous in your ways;
Maidens far more than fair,
Tho? fairer none may be,
For Beauty is, in this bright land, your dower ;
Join all in this glad hour,
And rend the spring-tide air,
And shake the steadfast ground,
With one great blessing, one great cheer of praise
To Her our Queen and Her?s, on land and sea.
If in our hearts we hold
Her stainless image?need we this to tell
Of what we all hold dear ?
But should our hearts grow cold,
In some remoter year,?
Or if they should rebel,
What dread reproach should we not gaze on here ;
How gaze and be untrue?
How owe nor pay as due ?


Then set it up on high, my friends, on high,
And let each passer by
Say to himself, in journeying on his way,
? It was a blessed day,
When She, Victoria, in her maiden pride,
Came to hold sway
Over Her mighty Empire free and wide
So Heaven guard Her still;
Heaven guide Her righteous will,
For this, do we and all Her subjects pray !
Then one cheer more,
?Till over sea and shore
The distant echoes fade and pass away.
Mowbray, 1 August, 1881.
