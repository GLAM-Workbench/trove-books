So after a few sniffs here and there
I amble down to the front gate and
fetch his paper.

This is where I shine. The boss
thinks Fm pretty smart but I like
doing it because he is a great scout.

But my joy is short lived for he bids me
goodbye and goes off to some place called
work without me. Why doesn?t he stay
at home ? We could have had a lovely
time together if he had.

Instead I?m forced, out of sheer
boredom, to tear up an
old slipper.

But after a while this, too, gets
rather dull. So I?m tempted to
slip out for a bit of a walk,

So after visiting my favourite spots
I see that great oaf Bruiser from
next door, but I disdainfully pass
him by.


It is now half-past five so I?ll just
have forty winks in the boss?s favour-
ite chair before he returns at six.

Holy Smokes! It?s six o?clock. I?ve
overslept myself. He?ll be home and
I won?t be at the gate to meet him.


But I meet him coming up the gar-
den path. Gosh! Fm glad to have
him home again. It seems like a
lifetime since I saw him this morning.

Everything is going fine and we?re
both pretty happy, when he sees that
slipper I chewed up this morning.


With a face like thunder he holds it out
as if waiting for me to explain. But my
bones turn to water and I can?t do any-
thing but stare at him with my soul in
my eyes.

frown disappears. He smiles and pats
me on the head muttering something
about ?Don?t do it again, son.?

And now with the boss at home and a

is complete. I lay me down to sleep.
SO GOOD-NIGHT, FOLKS!
