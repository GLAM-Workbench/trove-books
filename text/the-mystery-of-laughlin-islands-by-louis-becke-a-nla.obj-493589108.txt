THE MYSTERY OF
THE LAUGHLIN
ISLANDS:
A TRADITION OF
THE WESTERN PACIFIC.
r
PART 1.
THE OFFICIAL VERSION.
On the morning of the 10th of
November, 1794, the Resolution and
Salamander , storeships, were lying at
anchor in Port Jackson harbour.
The vessels had discharged their
2


cargoes and had bent sails to get
away to the whale fishery. Whal-
ing at this time was just beginning
to flourish, and most of the convict
transports and clumsy storeships
after discharging their freights at
Port Jackson, sailed away on a
whaling cruise.
It was a close, steamy morning,
and a heavy mist still hung over the
harbour and concealed the shore
from view, when Mr. William Irish,
the master of the Salamander came
on deck and asked the mate if the
hands had finished breakfast.
“ No, sir,” answered the officer,
“ not quite.”
“Well, hurry ’em up, Wilkins.
That flash gentleman over there,”
pointing to the spars of the Resolution
that towered up about a cable’s


length away, “ seems in a damned
hurry to get away before us. Now
I would like to get away first, just
to spite him. He is a lowlived
swab.”
Mr. William Irish did not like
Mr. John Locke the master of the
Resolution , and was not diffident in
expressing his dislike upon every
possible occasion.
The master of the Resolution was
a gentleman of no small importance,
and of considerable personal attrac-
tions. This was his own estimate
of himself. Mr. William Irish—a
short, stout man with a leathern-
hued complexion - held different
opinions. We know this because
on one memorable occasion he thus
expressed himself to a sergeant of
the New South Wales Corps, who


had boarded the Salamander on press-
ing official business.
“ I call myself Bill Irish. lam
a-plain man, with no damned non-
sense about me ; but I am honest,
and I am a master mariner, and
left the King’s service with a clean
record, as Governor Collins can tell
you. Locke—who is a swab —calls
himself ‘Captain’ Locke, oils his
hair, and curls his blarsted whiskers,
and is a blarsted liar. You can
search my ship, sergeant, from the
fore-peak to the lazarette, and if
you find any of your infernal jail
birds aboard o’ me, I’ll give you a
cask of rum ; but if you take my
advice you’ll search the Resolution.
And when you board her tell her
flash captain that I say he is a liar,
and be damned to him 1 ”


And then, turning to his mate,
Mr. Irish told him to assist the
sergeant and his men to search the
ship tor convict stowaways, adding,
“ And the first one you get lug him
up on deck, and then get a cask of
rum up from the lazarette and put
it in the sergeant’s boat.”
Sergeant Day, being a soldier
and a man of few words, took the
remarks of the master of the Sala-
mander very quietly, merely observ-
ing—
“ That is all very well, but it is
my duty to search,” and then he
stopped suddenly, and exclaimed,
pointing to the Resolution , whose
hull now came out clearly as the
breeze dispersed the fog—“ Why,
he’s getting under weigh.”
“ Serves you right ! I told you


he was a rascal anil a liar. Now
you’ll be very neatly sold. Told
you he was going ashore to dinner
with some of the soldier gentlemen,
to-day, did he ? He’s sold you very
neatly. His anchor’s underfoot, and
you can’t catch him.”
“ I’ll try, anyhow,” said the
sergeant, and then his face fell. He
had sent his boat ashore to report to
his officer that he had searched the
Resolution fruitlessly. Turning to
Mr. Irish, he asked him to lend
him one of his boats.
Don’t see why I should ; but I
will though, because the infernal
liar told you I had ’em aboard of
my ship.”
The sergeant was halfway down
the side-ladder while Mr. Irish was
speaking, and he was followed by


Sergeant Jones and a couple of
privates who had remained on
board when the boat had been sent
ashore to report.
“ Two hands jump into that boat,”
sang out the master of the Sala-
mander. “ I don’t want them red-
coats cruising around the harbour in
one of my whaleboats, with no one
to look after them,” he added.
In a few moments the boat had
shoved off, and was pulling hard for
the Resolution ; the boat’s crew con-
sisting of two seamen from the
Salamander and the four soldiers.
Even as they shoved oft the Resolu-
tion s maintopsail was sheeted home,
and the cook of the Salamander , a
personage with a snow-white cap,
and an exceedingly dirty face, and
who, when on shore, was a patron


of sport in the neighbourhood of
Whitechapel, called out as the boat
was being urged on by the rowers —
“ Even money you doesn’t catch
er ; pull your damndest, you red-
aated sons of guns ; even money, I
iv, you doesn’t catch her.”
Now as this is a perfectly true
:ory, we will, at this stage in the
■lling of it, “put in,” as they say
m the courts of law, the affidavits
of certain individuals who took, part
in the affair. First comes the—
AFFIDAVIT OF WII.I.IAM IRUH.
Mr. William Irish, master of the
ship Salamander, came before me
and voluntarily deposed that, having
been furnished with a copy of a
letter which it was necessary to
write to the Lieutenant-Governor,


for the purpose of obtaining permis-
sion to receive on board such persons
as he had shipped belonging to the
Colony, and being officially desired
to communicate the same to Mi.
John Locke, master of the Resolution,
and undertaking to do so, he accord-
ingly supplied him with a copy of
the paper he had received, as above
mentioned, explaining at the same
time to the said Mr. Locke the
necessity there was for his obtaining
the Lieutenant-Governor's written
permission to take any person from
the Colony.

eleventh day of November, 1794.

The next document is the
AFFIDAVIT OF WILLIAM DAY.
William Day, Sergeant in the
New South Wales Corps, came this
day before me and voluntarily made
oath that he had the charge of the
guard which was placed on board
the Resolution storeship by order of
the Lieutenant-Governor for the
purpose of preventing convicts or
other persons being received on
board without permission : that on
the morning of the departure of the
said ship from this harbour, infor-
mation was sent down to the
master, John Locke, that some
convicts were missing from the
Colony and were supposed to be
secreted on board his ship ; that he
assisted with the sergeant who came


on board in searching the said ship,
but without effect 5 that he went
from her on board the Salamander to
search that vessel ; the while on
board he perceived the Resolution
getting under weigh, on which he
returned to her and caused the
master to come to an anchor, telling
him he could not go to sea without
having received a certificate ot the
number of persons he had on board
belonging to the Colony ; that
having sent up the pilot and the
boat to receive the Lieutenant-
Governor’s further orders, that as
soon as the boat was out of sight
the master again got up his anchor,
notwithstanding the remonstrances
of this deponent, who urged him to
wait the return of the boat ; that
the said John Locke made use of


niany execrations, refusing to wait
under an idea that he might be
ordered to return to the Cove ;
that the Salamander s boat in which
deponent had boarded the Resolution
then returned, the ship by this time
being between the Heads, and this
deponent with his party having no
means of leaving the vessel ; that
the said John Locke repeatedly
asserted with many horrible curses
that he would not furnish this
deponent with a boat from the ship,
but that he would certainly land
him and his party on some desolate
part ot the coast if he persisted in
waiting for a boat from Sydney ;
that (irmly believing that Mr.
Locke would put his threats into
execution, he with some difficulty
made himself heard, by the men in


the Salamander s boat, who returned
and took him and his party in ;
that going down in the cabin just
before this deponent left the ship he
perceived the surgeon (Mr. Black-
burne) and second mate (Mr. Gib-
son) filling several cartridges with
powder, which he supposed were
intended to be made use of in case
any boat should attempt to come on
board the Resolution ; the master
having repeatedly sworn that no
boat should board her ; that at the
time this deponent lett the Resolution
she was eight miles without the
Heads of the harbour. And further
this deponent saveth not.
(Signed) Wiu.iam Dav.
Then followed the same signatures
of the officials who had taken Mr.
Irish’s affidavit.


After this came the
AFFIDAVIT OF DAVID JONES.
Sergeant David Jones, of the
New South Wales Corps, personally
appeared before me and made oath
that on Sunday morning, the 9th of
this instant month of November, he
was sent on board the Resolution
(John Locke, master), then at
anchor just above the South Head
of this harbour, with a message from
the Lieutenant - Governor, which
message was to inform the master
that the Lieutenant-Governor had
heard that he (John Locke) was
about to quit the port without
having received a certificate of the
number of persons he was permitted
to receive on board belonging to the
Colony, and that he was not to


take any person away without the
Lieutenant-Governor’s permission ;
that this message being delivered to
Mr. Locke, he replied to this de-
ponent that he did not think he had
any business with a certificate ; that
deponent, on telling Mr. Locke that
he was ordered to search for a
woman of the name of Morgan,
the master of the Resolution said
she was not there—he knew nothing
about such a person ; that having
searched for the space of four hours,
during which time the woman could
not be found in this ship, this
deponent went on board the Sala-
mander to search that ship, and that
while he was there he perceived the
Resolution to be getting under weigh,
though he had communicated to the
master the necessity there was for


his waiting until he heard further
from the Lieutenant-Governor.
(Duly signed, witnessed. See., See.)
After Sergeant Jones’ statement
comes another which tells this
story from another point of view.
This is the
AFFIDAVIT OF GEORGE BANNISTER.
George Bannister (a free man)
came before me on this day, the
eleventh of November, 1794, and
voluntarily deposed that on the
night of Saturday the Bth instant,
Mr. Stephenson asked him to go
out in the boat to fish the next
morning ; that he is accustomed to
fish with Mr. Stephenson ; that
accordingly he went with him ac-
companied by one Kelly, Thomas


Vicker, and John Toft ; that they
procured bait in the North Harbour
anil went without the Heads to
their fishing-ground, where they
remained until the Resolution went
out ; that the ship stood directly
out to sea, and that when they had
nearly lost sight of her they saw her
make a tack and stand towards
Broken Bay ; that when she had
run nearly the length of Broken
Bay she ran down along shore,
heaving to several times ; that a
little time before sunset the ship
being near Cabbage Tree Beach,
round the North Head of this
Harbour. Mr. Stephenson proposed
to Kelly and the others in the boat
to go on board the Resolution ; that
this deponent refused to be concerned
in taking a boat belonging to any
3


one, and declared he would not go 5
that this deponent and Toft refusing
to row alongside the ship the other
three men rowed the boat alongside ;
that they had previously perceived
people on the foretopsail-yard look-
ing at the boat with glasses, and on
their coming alongside, the master,
Mr. John Locke, asked them what
they wanted ; they said they had
some fish to sell ; that he gave them
half-a-gallon of liquor for the fish ;
that he (John Locke) then asked
Mr. Stephenson if he had seen a
boat off there ; Stephenson said,
Yes, the boat he (Mr. Locke)
wanted was there ; the master then
called him into the cabin ; that in
about ten minutes he returned with
some wine, some cheese, and some
bread, and told this deponent and


the others to pull into Cabbage Tree
and meet a boat they would find
there j that they rowed into Cabbage
Tree, and not finding the boat there
they returned to the ship, and
Stephenson, Kelly, and Vicker went
on board, and this deponent with
Toft returned with the boat up to
Sydney Cove ; that just as they left
the ship they saw a boat lowered
down from the ship and saw two
lights hoisted, one at the stern of
the ship and one on the foretopsail-
yard ; that Kelly took the fishing
tackle belonging to the boat with
him into the ship, saying that it
might procure them a fresh meal at
sea, and that the Lieutenant might
be damned for all the fish he (Kelly)
would ever catch for him again ;
that the ship appeared to stand old


when they left her, at which time
she might be about five miles from
the land to the northward.

PART II.
WHAT HAPPENED ON BOARD THE
"RESOLUTION.”
From the foregoing it will be
seen that the storeship Resolin'.on
hail on board of her certain persons
escaped from the Penal Settlement
at Sydney, and that John Locke,
her master, had connived at their
escape. 'Phis much is told by the
official records of the Settlement.
What remains of this story is pieced
together from information not offici-
ally available.
'The Resolution is standing to the


N.N.E., with n fresh breeze abeam
and every stitch of sail set. Mr.
John Locke, “ who oils his hair and
curls his whiskers,” is walking the
poop of his cumbersome old ship,
and the crew, under the orders of
the mates, are lashing the movable
objects on deck and generally getting
things ready for sea before the land
is lost sight of. The surgeon, Black-
burn, as Sergeant Day calls him ‘in
liis affidavit, is seated in the cabin
and whistling softly to himself,
every now and then glancing through
the cabin doors, which open on to
the main deck, as if he expected
to see some one come in.
Captain Locke is a fine figure of a
man, a trifle over six feet In height,
not more than six-and-thirty years
of age, showily dressed, shining and


perfumed, and altogether justifying,
by greasiness of face and head and
general fashion of grooming himself,
that serious allegation of the master
of the Salamander in the matter of
hair and whiskers.
Presently, the land being pretty
well out of sight and the night hav-
ing fallen enough for the man at the
wheel to have asked for a light for
the binnacle, Mr. Locke went to
the cabin skylight and called down—
“ Step up on deck a moment,
Blackburn, I want you.”
Mr. Blackburn rose in a leisurely
manner, and made his way to the
poop.
u Here I am. What do you
want ? ”
'The surgeon of the Resolution is a
very different-looking person to her


dashing master, being a little man
of very uncertain age and of an
exceedingly dry and parched aspect,
save for his nose, which resembled
that of one of the “shocking ex-
amples ” that temperance lecturers
occasionally bring upon the platform
with them to illustrate the curse of
drink. Certainly no one could
accuse Mr. Blackburn of greasing
his hair or whiskers, though his
voice would have been all the better
for oiling—judging from its tones,
which were not unlike the hoarse
note of a molly-hawk or booby.
Captain Locke walked to the
beak of the poop, followed by the
surgeon.
“ Well, we are in for it now,
Blackburn. I didn’t bargain to
bring away half the infernal Colony


for the sake of this woman. What
the devil shall we do with them ? ”
“ My dear sir, I have thought of
that. Of course it is inconvenient ;
but I assure you that it was un-
avoidable, and we can remedy the
matter later on.”
“ That’s all very well ; but the
whole thing is out. That Jack-in-
office chief gaoler, governor, or
whatever he calls himself, will re-
port the matter at home, and we
shall be tried for it.”
“Pooh, pooh! my dear sir. In
the first place, the whole matter will
be forgotten by the time we get
back ; and, by your plan, supposing
it is not forgotten, there will be no
evidence against you, while you will
have my evidence in your favour.”
“ 1 think you might have told me,


fack, that we were clear of the
Heads, and have let me out of that
stuffy cabin of yours before this.”
This from a woman who had
suddenly come upon the poop from
the cabin by way of the ladder on
the larboard side. She was coarsely
dressed in the plain shawl and stuff
grey gown of a convict. Her un-
graceful attire did not, however,
disguise her great personal beauty.
She was about six- or eight-and-
Iwenty, tall, dark, and perhaps just
a trifle too stout. Her black eyes
and dark flush under the pale olive
skin of her face, suggested the gipsy
blood in her veins, her speech, in her
every movement.
“ Sen ! that miserable little rat
below,” she said, in quick, imperious
tones quite audible to the surgeon,


;irul indicating him with a nod of her
dark head.
Mr. Blackburn was thereupon
requested by his captain to go below,
and with a deprecating but un-
pleasant smile at the woman, did
so.
“ Well, Miriam, my beauty,” said
Captain Locke, “ the job’s done so
far, though I don’t think the worst
of it is over. What the devil are
we to do with all these Government
chickens ? ”
“ Jack,” said the woman, playfully
pulling hi? long auburn whiskers,
the mizenmast conveniently hiding
the caress from the view of the man
at the wheel, “ you think yourself
a clever man, but, upon my word,
|acky boy, you’re a fool.”
“Oh ! come now, my beaut)'. ]


am sure I’ve brought the affair off
verv well, and— —”
“Listen to the man !” and the
woman shook her shapely forefinger
mockingly in his face. “He enters
the port not two months ago, a
highly respectable and virtuous—no.
I’ll allow, Jack, you were always a
black sheep from the first. Well,
to put it fairly, when you came to
the Cove a couple of months ago
you intended, after swindling the
Government out of as much stores
as you could, and driving a little
trade on the sly with the officers,
you intended to go away decently
and catch whales ”
“ Yes, but you ’’
“ Exactly, Jack dear ; but I
caught you , and in a week made
you alter all your plans, convert


your nasty old whaling ship into
“ Well, you witch,” and Locke
seized her hands in his and looked
down into the handsome, mocking
face, “ and did I not plan the whole
affair and carry you oft beauti-
fully ? ”
“ Why, you great stupid ! I
arranged the whole matter ; but
you, by your clumsiness, let half
your crew, including that little worm
of a surgeon, know all about it ;
and now, because you have had to
take on board half his friends and
their friends, you want to take credit
for spoiling my plans. Jack, you
have bungled the matter.”
Captain Locke looked very un-
comfortable, and pulled his whiskers
vigorously.


“ I don’t know how it came
out, Miriam. I was obliged to take
the second mate and Blackburn into
the plot —they suspected what we
were up to from the first.”
“ Well, we won’t argue about the
matter ; let us make our arrange-
ments.”
“■All very tine. What are the
arrangements to be ”
u Leave everything to me. Come
somewhere where we can talk, and
I will tell you what to do.”
“■ You will take command of the
ship, eh ? ” said Captain Locke,
playfully.
“ Precisely, my ducky.”
He laughed, and then went below,
followed by the woman. As they
passed Blackburn, sitting at the cabin
table, drinking rum and water, she


looked over at him, and said,
sweetly—
“lt is a beautiful night ; why
don’t you go on deck again, Mr.
Blackburn ? ”
The little-surgeon looked at her,
and again smiled, in a weazel-like
manner.
“ Oh, of course, Mrs. Morgan, if
you wish it.”
Twenty-eight days later, at four
o’clock in the afternoon, the Resolu-
tion was oft a group of nine low-
lying, densely vegetated coral islands.
The land had been sighted about
noon, about ten miles away on the
lee beam, and Captain Locke had
immediately bore down for it. But
the breeze that day had no heart in
it ; and at two o’clock, with the
land still three miles distant, the


ship lay rolling about in a dead
calm. Sometimes, as she rose to
the long sweeping roll of the south-
east trades, those on board caught a
momentary glimpse of the snow-
white beach that fringed the lee
side of the nearest island. Back
from the beach line was a dense
forest of cocoanut palms, with here
and there a cluster of the grey-
thatched houses of a native village.
At two o’clock Captain Locke
came on deck, and took a long look
at the land. Then he went below
and sent up word for Mr. Barker,
the mate, to come below.
Mr. Barker has not yet been in-
troduced. He was an elderly man,
a rough, but yet quiet-spoken, old-
fashioned salt, who had been a long
time in pickle, and looked it.


When the mate entered the cabin,
Captain Locke was seated at the
table studying a chart, and occa-
sionally looking at a closely-written
sheet of foolscap.
“ Sit down, Barker,” said Captain
Locke, with a quick, evasive sort of
glance at the weather-tanned features
of his subordinate ; and then, lean-
ing back in his chair and thrusting
his hands in his pockets, he spoke
rapidly, with his eyes turned away
from those of the man to whom he
was talking.
“ Barker,” he began, “ I have sent
for you to tell you our plans, and I
want you to fall in with them, and
let us have no bother.”
“ Aye, aye, sir. Thank you
kindly. You have been very good
to me ; anything you please.”
4


“ Very well. Do you know these
islands here ? Do you know any-
thing of the people ? ”
“ I suppose they are savage, like
the rest ; eat shipwrecked sailors,
but safe enough to put into for wood
and water if the boats’ crews are
well armed and keep their weather
eye lifting.”
“ Oh, no, Barker ; you are quite
mistaken about these particular
islands. 1 know a) about them ”
(this was a lie). “Why, man,” and
he looked at the paper he held in
his hand, “these islands are well
known. Those Dutchmen, Le
Maire and Schouten, discovered ’em
in 1616—nearly two hundred years
ago—anchored here, and stayed a
month or so refitting ” (another lie).
“ Then Captain Cook spent a week


there, and some of his men ran
away, being so much taken with
the amiable character of the natives”
(more lies) ; “ then the Scarborough
transport called here on her way
from New South Wales to Batavia
a few years ago ” (the one true
item), “ and I heard the master
of her say that the people are the
finest lot of natives he ever fell
across. You see his report of the
place gives the correct position—
latitude g° ig' 5" S., and longitude
1 53° S°'- Damned smart fellow,
the master of the Scarborough. I
knew him when I was running to
the West Indies in the Zillah."
“ Yes, of course,” assented the
mate. “ You see, sir, I know
nothing of these parts, not having
been here before. But what might


you be a-considering of, sir ? We
has plenty of water aboard, sir.”
“ That is it,” and Captain Locke
shifted uneasily in his seat, and his
fingers toyed with the pencil he held
in his hand ; then, with his eyes
bent upon the paper before him, he
resumed, “You see. Barker, when
you told me your sad story, I was—
damme if 1 wasn’t very much
touched ; and your appeal to me to
rescue your daughter, so unjustly
transported to New South Wales,
determined me to make the attempt.
But, damme, Barker, I did not bar-
gain to take away a whole shipload
of convicts besides your daughter.”
“ No, sir. God knows we are
indeed grateful to you for what you
have done.”
“ Very well,” and again Captain


Locke’s eyes wandered, but never
sought those of the anxious mate.
“ Now, I don’t want to remind you
of what I have done for you. But
it has become necessary now that
you should do something for me.”
“ Most a-willingly, sir. Why,
sir, I will do anything you ask ! ”
“ finite so, Barker. You see the
case is this ” —anil then for the first
time Captain Locke’s wavering eyes
made a bold effort, and looked into
the mate’s. “ You come to me in
England with a very sad story, and
offer to give your life and your for-
tune —such as it is—and all the rest
of it, if I will carry away your con-
vict daughter. Damme, man, you
touched my feelings most damnably.
Well, after we get to sea, you hand
me a hundred guineas to work the


oracle with the official people at the
Settlement. You quite understand,
Barker, that I am a gentleman. I
am not the man to pocket money
for the service I have rendered you,
eh ? ” and then, conscious that in
this matter he was telling the bare
truth, Captain Locke’s eyes looked
straight into the mate’s working
features.
“ Oh, yes, sir, I know you are
above such a thing as that.”
“ Very good. Igo to all sorts of
trouble, and get your daughter on
board ; but through this business I
get hopelessly entangled with this
Morgan woman and her gang, with
the result that I have to bring her
off and five men as well ; so that I
have seven convicts on board.”
“1 am very sorry, sir. I thought


that—that that you took some
pleasure in Mrs. Morgan’s—in Mrs,
Morgan’s company.”
“ Oh, well, of course, she is very
well ; and I made some sort of love
to her while we were at Sydney ;
but —devil take the woman !—she
fell so hopelessly in love with me,
that I have been forced to take her
and half the infernal Settlement on
board to please her.”
“ I am very sorry, sir, that I have
got you into such a mess, sir ; what
can be done ? ”
“That Is what I am coming to.
The fact is this, the whole crew, led
on by the second mate and surgeon,
have got frightened, and, by the
Lord Harry, I’m frightened myself.
I can’t take these people to England
—we should all be ruined.”


The mate’s face paled visibly, and
he half rose to his feet and then
sat down again. Hitherto his
humility had been painful for even
Locke to witness. He had been
ready to fall at his commander’s
feet in gratitude for the restoration
of his daughter. Now, his honest
soul was tortured by a horrible
doubt. Placing both his shaking
hands on the table, he gazed with an
expression of intense anxiety into
Locke’s shifty eyes.
“ Not to England ! ” he said, with
a catch in his breath.
“ No, not to England. lam
going to land them here —every one
of them. All hands insist upon it.
It has got to be done.”
Barker sprang to his feet. “My
God ! you can’t be such a villain,


Captain Locke ! My daughter shall
go to England ! You don’t mean
to say that you would betray us like
.this ? ”
The man had changed. All his
former servility had disappeared, and
a dangerous look came into his eyes.
Locke began to get frightened, and
looked it, although he had a loaded
pistol in the breast of his coat.
“ Oh come, Barker, I can’t stand
that sort of language. lam master
of this ship you know.”
“ But your promises ? What is
to become of my unfortunate
daughter ? Good God ! Captain
Locke, would you land her among
cannibals ? Better for her had she
never escaped from the Settlement
if this is to be her fate.”
He had come round to Locke’s


end of the table now, and was stand-
ing beside him, speaking quietly
enough, but yet with suppressed
anger and fear struggling for mastery
within him.
“Now, now, Barker, that is non-
sense. I can assure you that not
the slightest harm will come to any
one landing here. The natives are
quiet, wouldn’t hurt a child. And
your daughter, with the others, can
remain here until the next ship
comes along—a matter of a few
month*—and then get away again as
shipwrecked people. Anyhow, I
can’t and won’t risk any more, and
take these people further.”
The old seaman passed his hand
across his brow in a dazed manner,
and then spoke in husky tones.
“ Captain Locke, for God’s sake,


sir ! ... Look here, sir, I have
struggled and slaved and saved my
every penny to raise that hundred
guineas to get my daughter away
from that convict hell ; . . . and
now, just as we have met after
three long years, you would part us
again ! ”
Locke, still seated in his chair
and feeling the butt of his pistol,
screwed up courage enough to look
into Barker’s face.
“Certainly not. You will go
with her.”
The mate stepped back and
drew a deep breath. “You damned
scoundrel! May God Almighty
punish you for this,” and then with-
out another word he turned on his
heel and walked out of the cabin.
A minute after Locke followed


and gave orders to the second mate
to lower away the waist whaleboat.
Assembled near the ladder was a
party of five men and one woman,
getting ready to leave the ship.
The woman was Barker’s daughter.
What her offence had been for
which she was transported to Botany
Bay does not here matter. She was
tall and dark like Mrs. Morgan, but
not beautiful like her.
This was the first time she had been
seen on deck in daylight during the
twenty-eight days’ voyage from Syd-
ney Cove. She had ate and drank
and slept in her father’s cabin,
waited upon by him with the ten-
derest solicitude, and he lying upon
the cabin deck just beneath her bunk
had pleasantly dreamed of the happy
life they would lead together once


more in England. Only at night-
time, when it was her father’s watch,
would she come on deck, and.then
the timid, shrinking creature would
sometimes remain with him till he
was relieved, fleeing below, however,
on those few occasions when either
Locke or Mrs. Morgan had come on
deck.
The boat was ready, so the second
mate reported to Locke in a whisper.
Silence had been maintained so far.
The crew, gathered for’ard in a
group, were looking sourly at the
five men and the woman, when
Barker stepped out of the cabin,
carrying a bundle of clothing.
For a moment he looked at the
men for’ard and then spoke.
“ Well, lads, this is a poor way to
serve me like this. If you are


honest men you would stand by me,
if only for the sake of an innocent
woman.”
Some mutterings followed, but
none of the men answered.
The old mate gazed scornfully at
them for a moment or two and then
stepped over to the group by the
ladder and took his daughter’s hand.
Suddenly he stepped out again and
looked up to Locke who stood at the
beak of the poop.
“ Where is that woman Morgan,
Captain Locke ? Why is she not
here with us to share our fate ?If
these five people are escaped con-
victs and endanger ■ your safety, how
does it fall out that she, who is also
a convict, remains on board ? ”
Locke descended to the main deck
and came so close to Barker that


those near him could not hear what
he was saying, and answered —
“ She remains with me ; get into
the boat, and let us have no more
fuss, or I will not answer for your
safety.”
“You villain!” the other ex-
claimed, “ I understand you now.
I see through your infernal plot. I
have heard of the lying yarn you
have told the crew. But lam glad
that woman of yours remains with
you. She is not fit to be near my
daughter. But don’t make too cer-
tain John Locke, that you have
won ; for, by God, I might get back
yet ; and when I do, look out.”
“ Into the boat, all of you,” said
Locke, turning away.
They went down the side, the
five convicts first, then Barker and


his daughter, the painter was let go,
the ship’s sails trimmed to catch a
faint puff’ that began to ripple the
glassy surface of the water, and then
the boat pulled shoreward in the fast-
gathering darkness.


PART III .
MR. IRISH GETS SQUARE WITH HIS
ENEMIES.
In the month of December, in a
year early in the present century,
Mr. William Irish, once master of
the Salamander , but at this period
retired from the sea and proprietor
of a highly-respectable tavern in the
East End of London, was surprised
in his inn parlour by a visit from
a little man, shabbily dressed and
looking blue with the cold, for he
had no overcoat and was but thinly
clad.
5


“ You don’t remember me, sir,”
said the little man, suddenly stepping
into the room from the bar and
standing in front of Mr. Irish,
who was sitting in an arm-chair,
dozing in front of the fire.
“ No, I don’t.”
“ My name is Blackburn,” smiled
the little man, affably. “ 1 was sur-
geon of the Resolution when Locke
took those convicts away.”
“ I knew he had ’em, damn him.
I say, Folly.”
“ What do you want, Irish ? ”
and Mrs. Irish, a little creature
with black, beady eyes came out of
the kitchen.
“ You remember that damned
oily fellow Locke } him that I told
you was an infernal liar ? ”
“ Yes, I remember your yarn ;


him that you was always talking
about, brought his ship to Plymouth
or somewhere and then disappeared
with a woman he had stolen from
Botany Bay, and left the second mate
to take the ship to London. If that’s
him you’ve got there, I don’t want
any dealings with him.”
“ No, this isn’t him ; but this
chap was the surgeon aboard the
Resolution''
This conversation was carried on
in very loud tones, Mr. and Mrs.
Irish having contracted the habit of
hailing each other in this fashion
when the lady had assisted in the
navigation of a coaster in which th.sc
two had made their last voyage to sea.
Mr. Blackburn did not appear to
relish this publicity, and entreated
Mr. Irish not to talk so loud.


“ Oh, I see,” bawled Irish, “ you
was in it too, was you, eh ? ”
“ Well, not exactly that, but ”
“ What’s he wanting, Bill ? ” in-
terjected Mrs. Irish, leaning against
the doorway and eyeing the little
man critically.
“ Just a few minutes’ private con-
versation with your husband, Mrs.
Irish, if you please.”
u See what he wants, Irish, and
don’t you be giving your money
away. 1 know what a fool you
are.”
“ Clap a stopper on that tongue of
yours, Polly. 1 am quite able to
take care of myself,” replied the
ex-master of the Salamander with
much dignity.
Mrs. Irish disappeared, and then
Mr. Irish got up and shut the door


and said: “Now, Mr. Sawbones,
pay out what you’ve got to say and
have done with it.”
“ Well, the fact is, I have reason
to believe that you don’t like Mr.
Locke ; is that so, Mr. Irish ?”
“No, I don’t like—that is, I
didn’t like him. 1 have never seen
him since he was in Port Jackson
with me, and I never want to see
him again. He’s a liar, and I told
the Sergeant of Marines to tell him
so. He spun a yarn about me having
a woman convict aboard my ship
while the lying swab had her aboard
his. I never did him no harm.
What did he want to tell blarsted
lies about me for ? ”
“ yuite so,” and the little man
blinked and nodded violently, “quite
so, Mr. Irish. Well, he behaved


very badly to me also, and so did the
woman he brought away. They
cheated me out of a lot of money.
I was weak enough to help them to
get away a whole lot of prisoners
and he cheated me, and cheated the
second mate, and he cheated the
mate.”
“ What’s that got to do with me ?
Serves yon damned well right for
breaking the law.”
“Yes, that is ijuite true, Mr.
Irish, and we have all suffered for
it. The second mate was drowned
the next voyage as a judgment upon
him for his sins, and I am pretty
near starving ; but yet that wicked
convict woman is rolling in riches.”
“ Look here,” and Irish looked
hard into Mr. Blackburn’s blinking
countenance. “there’s something


curious about her. If she was the
woman he brought to England, who
was the woman that he was said to
have landed on an island some-
where ? I’ve heard the yarn from
two or three whaling captains.”
“ That was the mate’s daughter,
sir. We took two women away
from Port Jackson. No one but
Locke, Barker, and myself knew
that the mate’s daughter was con-
cealed on board till after we got to
sea. We arranged with a lady—an
officer’s wife—who had befriended
her to make out that she had
wandered out from the Settlement
and been lost in the forest, and the
savages had got her. She was a
very good woman and was sent out
for some trifling offence, and the
officer’s wife, for whom she was


working, helped her father to get
her away.”
“ It’s a pretty rum yarn ; I don’t
understand it.”
“ The mate was a very respectable
man, too, Mr. Irish, and he gave
Locke a big sum of money to take his
daughter home ; then that scoundrel
met the woman Morgan, and was
so fascinated by her that he got
her on board. Then, to keep the
thing quiet, he had to take on board
five of her male friends ; then,
when we got to sea, he concocted a
fine plot to get rid of the lot.”
“ I always knew he was a blasted
scoundrel.”
“ He got me and the second mate
to tell the crew, just before we got
to a group of islands in the South
Sea, that the mate, for whom out of


compassion he had taken the
daughter on board, had plotted with
the five convicts to take the ship.”
“ Then you lied, too. I knew
that mate ; Jim Barker was his
name. He was a very straight-
forward, good seaman, and 1 never
heard what became of him.”
“ Well, we told the crew that the
mate and the convicts had plotted
to take the ship, and that that
woman Morgan had given us warn-
ing, and that Locke wanted them to
keep quiet because he was going to
turn the tables on them. When, a
few hours later we were pretty close
in to the islands, Locke told the
crew that the time was at hand, and
we put the mate and his daughter
and all the convicts, except Mrs.
Morgan, into a boat and cut them


adrift. Then Locke took the ship
to Plymouth by way of Batavia,
and the first night after we got in he
and the woman went on shore and
we saw no more of them.”
“It seems to me that the whole
lot of you ought to be hanged.”
“ Our conduct was very wicked,
Mr. Irish. Well, let me go on,
please. A few days ago I saw
Locke anil had some talk with him,
and that’s what I came to sec you
about.”
“ Saw Locke ! What the devil
is he doing here ? ”
“He is a ruined man and nearly
starving, and was lookin for a shop
when I saw him. That woman
threw him over as soon as she got a
footing in London. She actually
drives a carriage now, and is living


with some lord, and Locke whines
about it, but is too much of a fool
to inform against her.”
“ Why do you come here and tell
me all this ? I don’t want to have
anything to do with any of you.”
A green light came into the little
man’s blinking eyes.
“ I am going to get square with
him, and with that woman too, and
I want your help. I am sure you
will be glad to be revenged upon the
scoundrel.”
“ Oh, that’s your idea is it ? And
how did you find all this out, and
who told you to come to me ? ”
“ I have heard people say you
were very bitter against Locke for the
lies he told about you. You know
the people at Port Jackson always
were in doubt as to whether the Sal a-


wander did not carry off some of the
convicts, and they say your owners
quarrelled with you over the
matter.”
“Yes, that’s true enough 5 but
how did you find me, and what do
you want me to do ? ”
“ Locke told me you kept this
place. The poor, wretched scoun-
drel, several times, had thoughts of
coming to you for help, but he sai l
he had enough self-respect to keep
him back.”
Irish glanced contemptuously at
the surgeon, but merely said—
“ Oh, did he ? Well, what am I
to do ? ”
“You see, Mr. Irish, I can’t ap-
pear in the business. I was suspected
of having helped to bring those
people away. But this is what I


want you to do : You go to the
woman. She is rich. You know
her secret ; get all the money you
can out of her ; she’ll bleed freely
enough, 1 warrant. If you don’t
want the money, I do. I have been
defrauded by Locke and insulted by
her. Then you can lay the autho-
rities on the scent of Mr. Locke. He
will never reveal where she is, so we
shall have her at our mercy, and she
will prove as good as a banking ac-
count to us.”
“ A very beautiful idea of yours,”
“ Will you carry it out ? ”
Mr. William Irish thought for
some two or three minutes before he
replied, the other man fidgetting in
his chair and watching him narrowly
all the while.
Presently the old sailor spoke.


“Look here. I’ll join you. It will
be a good way for me to get square
with that infernal scoundrel. But
I’d like to make some improvements
in the plan. First of all, find Locke
and send him here to-morrow night
at eight o’clock. Can you see him
to-morrow ? ”
“ 1 could find him now if I wanted
to.”
“ Very well. Find him to-morrow
and send him here. lam going to
treat him well, and so you can tell
that I bear him no ill-will and will
be glad to prove it to him ; it will
come all the harder on him, do you see,
when he finds himself in Bow Street.”
The little man gave an appreciative
grin.
“ I see your idea ; but be careful
you don’t frighten him off.”


“You leave that to me. Mean-
while I’ll see the woman. This is
Monday. I’ll see her about Friday.
Where does she live ? ”
Blackburn wrote the address down
and handed it to Irish, who put it
in his pocket, and then resumed—
“ I can’t go to her before Friday ;
but 1 fancy if you come here to me
on Saturday night the whole thing
will be arranged, and you’ll have a
pocket full of guineas. I suppose
we go halves ? ”
“ Certainly, Mr. Irish, I am a
gentleman ”
“ I can see that."
“ And you’ll act square with me,
Mr. Irish. You have been deeply
wronged, you know, and now is your
time to get righted.”
“ Never fear, Mr. Blackburn.


Come into the bar and have a glass
of ale.”
A few minutes afterwards the
little surgeon had slipped away into
the darkness, with a few shillings
given him by Mr. Irish to keep him
going till he got more from Mrs.
Morgan.
The ex-master of the Salamander
looked after him and gave vent to
an oath.
“ The infernal little traitor.”
At eight o’clock on the following
evening a tall, big-framed, but thin
and wretchedly dressed man was
ushered into Mr. William Irish’s
parlour and asked to see the land-
lord.
Presently Irish came in, and
closed the door behind him.
“Ah, how do you do, Captain


Locke. Look here, I take back all
the words I’ve spoken against you,
and forgive you all the harm you’ve
done me if you can do one thing—
look me square in the face and tell
me you ain’t guilty of a cruel and
accursed crime. John Locke, you
are a cold-blooded murderer.”
The man turned his haggard face
to Irish and sought to say something,
but his voice failed him, and then
his eyes fell.
“You can’t deny it, man. God
knows I always thought you to be
an unprincipled swab, but I never
thought I should hear that you had
turned seven human beings—one of
’em a woman—adrift among savages.
Good God, man, did you never have
a mother ? ”
The once dashing captain of the
6


Resolution had sunk into a chair
and covered his face with his
hands.
“ Aye, hide your face, John Locke,
the curse of your evil deed is begin-
ning to come home to you. You
and the she-devil that was a partner
in your guilt ought to hang to-
gether.”
Locke rose up and faced the other,
and Irish saw that the man was thin
to emaciation and looked twenty
years older than he really was.
“What you say is true ; but I
was the worst. I have suffered
enough. I will wait here while you
send for an officer.”
Irish did not answer fora moment,
then he said—
“ Where is Mrs. Morgan ? She
is equally guilty.”


A flush came into Locke’s pale
face.
“I won’t tell you. She has be-
trayed and ruined me, but I am not
going to see her harmed.”
Irish’s face softened. “ You
damned fool. She will come and
see you hanged and laugh at you.”
“ May be,” said Locke, calmly,
“but all the same I’m not going to
see her harmed,”
Irish went to the door and call-
ing to his wife said—
“ Polly, this gentleman and me is
going to have a long talk ; don’t let
us be disturbed.”
Then closing the door again he
motioned Locke back to his seat.
Two hours afterwards John Locke
with a curious quaver in his voice
said, as he rose to go —


“As God is my judge, William
Irish, I will not fail you.”
The old seaman held out his hand
to the ex-captain of the Resolution,
“ I believe you, Locke, and if you
want to try and meet your Maker
with a clean sheet, you have got to
find out what has become of those
people you turned adrift on that
island. As for the convicts, if they
had their throats cut I won’t be
sorry, but there’ll be a heavy score
agin you if that poor woman and her
old father have perished through
your wickedness.”
Locke bent his head, and then
turned towards the door, when
Irish stopped him.
“Here, man, wait a bit. Here
are a couple of guineas to carry you
along till I have seen this woman.


Come here again on Saturday night,
and then I can tell you what she
says. As for that little swab of a
surgeon, I’ll soon put a stopper on
him.”
“ Good-night,” said Locke, hold-
ing out his hand with his face
averted j and he added, almost in a
whisper, “ and God bless you, Irish.”
Then pushing open the door he
walked quickly away.
On the Saturday night at six
o’clock, John Locke again came to
Mr. Irish’s parlour. He was now
decently clad, and had some of his
old swaggering style about him.
“ I can get just the ship I want,”
he said ; “ she is a small brig, and,
as she Is very old, the owners will
sell her cheap. The Government
will give her a freight of stores for


Port Jackson, if the surveyors will
certify that she is fit to make the
voyage.”
“All right, Locke. But sit down
and listen to my news. I went and
saw Mrs. Morgan.”
“ Yes,” said Locke, quietly.
“ She’s living in great style, I can
tell you. Well, I made short .work
of the business. She defied me at
first, but as soon as 1 mentioned
your name she stopped.
“‘Did Locke send you here?’
she asked me.
“ ‘ No,’ says I ; ‘ although you
robbed and deceived him, he told
me he would never say a word
against you that would bring you to
harm.’
“ ‘ Poor Jack,’ says she, %\ ith a
laugh, ‘he was too fond of me,


and spent his money on me like u
man.’
“ ‘Well,’ she said, after a bit, ‘I
suppose you’ve come here to get
money out of me to make you hold
your tongue.’
“ Then I says very gently : ‘ Look
here, Mrs. Morgan, you and John
Locke are murderers—you and he
have the lives of seven people to
answer for, one of them a woman
who never harmed you.’
“ She got a bit white then, and
then I told her the yarn that Black-
burn had spun me.”
‘“lt’s true enough, Mr. Irish,’
she says, getting up and going to the
window. She stood there for a
moment or so and then slews round
sudden.
‘‘ ‘ I’m a bad woman, it’s my


nature to be bad ; but I am sorry
for what happened. Do you think
the savages have killed them all i'
“‘Like enough, Mrs. Morgan,’
I said ; ‘unless what Locke says
about the people being a very in-
offensive lot is true.’
“ She sat down again, and then I
told her what Blackburn had pro-
posed to me to do. That made her
wild, and she looked like a she-
tiger. However, after a bit she
calmed down, and says to me
again—
“ ‘Well, Mr. Irish, what are you
going to do with me, sell me to the
Bow Street officers ? ’
“‘No,’ I said, I don’t want
blood-money neither does Locke.
But if you want to help to make
amends for the wickedness you have


done, you will spend some of your
money in trying to find out if
Barker and his daughter are alive.
If they are dead they may have
poor relatives in England.’
“‘You’re a good man, William
Irish,’ she said. ‘Tell me what to
do, and I will do it. How much
money will be wanted ? ’
“‘ Five hundred guineas,’ I said.
“ ‘ Come here to-morrow and you
shall get it—more if you want
it.’
“Just as 1 was about to sheer off
—well satisfied—she asked me what
you were doing, and if you were in
want of money.
“ ‘ Badly,’ I said ; ‘ but he
wouldn’t take a shilling from you.
He’s going out, please God, to try
and see if he can find these people


alive and bring back Barker and his
daughter to England.’
u She squirmed a bit, ami then
said in a low voice : ‘ I’d like to
give Captain Locke some money,
Captain Irish. He—he, he spent
all his on me.’
“Next day I went there again.
She wasn’t there, but the money
was there for me—five hundred
gold and a letter for me, enclosing
one to you ; here it is,” and Irish
handed it to him.
Locke broke the seal, and read —
“ Dear Jack, —You and Me did
a Dirty trik to the Mait an his
Doughtar, for wich Gods judmint
mite fall on Us. I hope You will
Find Her dear Jack, I want
to take what Mr. Irish has For


You. Good-bye Jack lam getin
Old now but I am no hipocrit and
will Never be Pious. Good-bye old
Jack Yours
“ Miriam Morgan.”
“ And this is for you too,” and so
saying Mr. Irish handed Locke four
£SO Bank of England notes. “ She
enclosed ’em in my letter for
you.”
Locke pushed them aside ; “ 1
don’t want her money, Irish, I ”
“You are a fool, Locke. She
means it in good part, and besides
she’s only doing the square thing.
She skinned you, and she wants to
give you some of your money
back.”
Locke’s face reddened. He pushed
the money over to Irish : “ When I


want a guinea I’d rather ask you for
it, Irish.”
For nearly an hour more the two
men, once enemies, sat and talked,
Locke had bought a chart, and with
an eager light in his eyes he was
showing Irish the course he intended
to make after leaving England.
Irish had pointed out to him that it
would never do for him to enter
Port Jackson again, he would be
arrested the moment he dropped his
anchor there. And so the plan of
taking out a cargo of stores had to
be given up j and it was decided to
fit the brig out as a whaler instead.
If he could find no traces of the
people he had abandoned on the
island, the brig was to stay out on a
whaling cruise till she was a full
ship and then return to England.


At eight o’clock a knock came to
the door, and at a sign from Irish,
Captain Locke quietly slipped out
into a back room. Then Irish
opened the door and admitted the
ex-surgeon of the Resolution.
“ Ah, is that you, Mr. Blackburn ?
Come inside ; 1 was expecting you.”
“Well,” said the little man,
eagerly, “how did you get on ; have
you got any money ? ”
“ You just sit down and listen,
and don’t interrupt me till I’ve
finished.”
“Certainly, certainly, Mr. Irish.”
“ I went and saw Mrs. Morgan
that was ; 1 have also seen Mr.
Locke. I told ’em both about your
coming to see me, and I got out of
’em all I wanted to know about you;
also I got some books and papers of


yours from her which will soon make
you see the inside of Newgate once
they are made public.”
“ What the devil ”
“Sit still, man, or I’ll twist your
skinny neck. You are a most in-
fernal scoundrel, Mr. Sawbones, a
bigger one than ever Locke was.
Now just listen. Mrs. Morgan and
Locke mean to do the square thing.
Locke is going out to the South Seas
to try and find those people that you,
you infernal rascal, helped to maroon.
The whole thing is going to be put
right and ”
“By God, will it ? I’ll be even
with you if 1 go to jail myself.”
“No need, Mr. Sawbones. I have
arranged all that. Locke and me
have been afore a magistrate and my
lawyer has fixed the whole affair up.


We thought of you. 1 told the
magistrate that you would be at
my place on Tuesday next, and he
is going to have you arrested. You
have got three days to get away ; so
if you take my advice you’ll start
now.”
“Curse you for a ” the rest
of Mr. Blackburn’s remarks were in-
audible, Mr. Irish laughed so loudly,
and ere he had ceased the ex-surgeon
of the Resolution was out in the
street. This was the last seen or
heard of him.


PART IV.
ON THE LAUGHLIN ISLANDS.
At daylight, one clay in the month
of August, 1836, a cry of “ Sail ho ! ”
was called from village to village
along the sandy beaches of the
Laughlin Islands, and the brown
men and women and children
swarmed out of their thatched huts
to look for the ship. The islands
are but low, perhaps not ten feet
above sea-level in the highest part —
and so, although the ship had been
but ten miles distant the previous
evening, she had not been seen by


any one on the island. Jnst as the
red sun had cleared the eastern sky-
rim they saw her topsails showing
through the groves of cocoanuts on
the southern point, and then in a
few minutes she came into full
view. From the number of boats
she carried the islanders knew her to
be a whaler, and a loud cry of delight
rang through the village when she
hauled up her courses and lay-to, to
wait for the canoes to bring off sup-
plies.
Only some three or four ships had
ever before visited the islands, and
the open, friendly manner of the
natives and the delight they showed
at meeting white men and the desire
they expressed to have one to live
among them was beginning to get
known among the whaleships that
7


cruised about in those latitudes sixty
years ago. It was for this reason,
and that he wanted to buy some hogs,
that Captain Abraham Warren, of
the Macedonian of Nantucket, deter-
mined to make a call at the island
before working his way northward
along the east coast of New Guinea.
Taranoa, the leading chief of this
group of nine islets, was the first to
hoard the whaler, accompanied by
half a dozen of his young men. His
simple pleasing manners and desire
to serve the American captain in
every possible way, expressed in
perfectly intelligible English, de-
cided Captain Warren to accept
his invitation and spend part of the
day ashore.
A boat was lowered from the ship
and Taranoa, sending his canoe


ashore with a message to his people
to prepare food for his guest, got in
the boat with the captain and piloted
her ashore.
For some time the master of the
Macedonian felt dazed by the noise
of the welcome afforded him. He
noticed that every native insisted
upon shaking hands with him,
English fashion, and also that many
of them showed unmistakable traces
of European blood in their veins
The women, in particular, were
very light in colour, and, indeed,
many were not as dark as Creoles.
After the chief had managed to
get his white guest through the
crowd of natives that hung about
him, he brought him to his house
and placed a rude chair for him to
sit upon, while the women of his


family placed food before him 5 the
captain motioned to the chief to sit
near him and talk.
“Like white people?” Taranoa
said, in answer to a remark of
Captain Warren’s ; “Oh yes, sir ;
every ship that comes here the
captain say native here got skin
like the white man.”
“Where did you learn to speak
English ? ” asked the American
presently.
“ I have been to sea, sir—sailor
man on board whaleship—English
whaleship belong to Sydney.”
For nearly an hour the captain
remained with his native host and
then expressing a wish to have a
look about the island, Taranoa at
once offered to be his guide.
They set out a few minutes later


and Taranoa, leading the way, took
the white man to every point that he
thought would interest him. As
they were returning to the village
along the path that led through the
cocoanut grove on the southern side
of the island, the chief pointed out
to the American a cluster of native
houses, and said that that was the
place where the white men once lived.
“ 'White men ! Did any white
men live here, and in those houses ? ”
“Yes. A long time ago ; but
they not live in those houses there.
Houses belong to white men fall
down long time ago.”
After they had returned to the
chief’s house Captain Warren ques-
tioned Taranoa about these white
men. At first the chief hesitated,
but then told him this story :


“ A long time ago, in his father’s
time, before he (Taranoa) was born,
a ship had come in close to the land.
The wind had died away and Kilagia,
his father, and four other men had
launched their canoe to go out to her,
when the breeze sprang up, just as
darkness had fallen, and they saw the
ship turn round and sail away. So
Kilagia and those with him turned
back, but scarce had they dragged
their canoe up on the beach when
they heard the sound of oars, and
running back they saw a boat close
in. All the people ran out of their
houses, some with torches in their
hands, and they saw that there were
six men in the boat and one woman.
The white men were all very much
frightened and feared to step out of
the boat at first, but Uranu, Kilagia’s


oldest wife, ran out into the water
and taking the white woman’s hand
in hers placed it on her bosom as a
sign of friendship and goodwill. So
then they all came out, and the people
took them to Kilagia’s house anil
gave them food and drink. The
chief of the white men was named
Paka ; the woman, who was young,
was his daughter Paka was an old
man ; his head was white ; and all
that night his daughter held his hand
in hers and shook and trembled it
one of the island men looked at her.
But they meant them no harm, for
Kilagia told the people that these
white men must not be hurt, as the
gods had sent them at the time of
the new moon, which is a lucky
time. By and by, as the days went
by, Kilagia and the old white man


Paka swore a friendship and became
as brothers, and Kilagia built him a
house for himself and daughter and
gave him slaves to work for him.
The other white men were not good
men, they were bad men. But yet
Kilagia gave each one a wife from
among the village girls and all went
well for a time. But one day, when
the white woman—whom her father
called Neli —was alone, one of the
five men came to her and said
she must be his wife. He was a
big man named Kelli, and much
feared by the others, but the w'hite
woman spoke scornfully to him and
said he had a native wife already.
Then she ran away and he ran after
her. While he pursued her she cried
loudly for her father, who ran out
from his house to meet her. She


sprang into his arms, but he put her
aside, and drawing his knife, he
sprang at the big man and thrust it
first into his stomach and then into
his throat. The other four men
then tried to kill Paka with their
knives, but Kilagia and his men
came to his help, and they over-
powered the four white men, and
then binding their arms and legs
with kafa (cinnet), they took them
to the edge of the reef and cast them
to the sharks which quickly devoured
them. All these five men, so Paka
told Kilagia, were prisoners who had
run away from prison in Sydney. All
the wives of these five men bore
children—born after the fathers were
given to the sharks. When a year
had gone Paka took a wife, the
daughter of Uranu, Kilagia’s chief


wife. She bore him a child, and
the white woman nursed it and
loved it as much as did its mother.
Nearly every day the old man and his
daughter would walk together round
the island and look out over the sea
to see if any ship was coming. But
after a time the old man ceased to
look ; he began to love the son born
to him by the daughter of Uranu.
Then, too, in time, the daughter ot
Paka cared no more to look out over
the sea for a ship j she told Kilagia’s
wives that she cared not to go back
to her own country again—it was
only because her father once desired
it that she looked seaward with him
for a ship. After she and her father
had been living on the island for
nearly three years the white woman
took a husband, a man from the


island farthest north of all these.
His name was Kavirua, and although
not a chief he was rich in land and
houses and canoes. They had many
children ; and then when Paka, the
old white man, died, his daughter
came over from the north island
and took his body away and buried
it near the place where she lived.
As’ the years went on she forgot
English talk, and although two
whaleships called a year or two
after her father died she went not
near them, but lived and died as one
of the island people.”
That was Taranoa’s story and
Captain Warren listened to it with
the keenest interest.
“ If you like to come with me I
show you the place where the old
white man and his daughter are


buried,” resumed Taranoa. “After
the woman had been dead a year
another ship came. She was a brig,
and her captain was a big tall man.
He and my father made friends and
the captain said he had come to
search for the old- man and his
daughter. Then my father told him
all that had been done and showed
him the place where they were buried.
Come with me and I will show you.”
Entering a canoe with the chief
and four natives the captain of the
Macedonian an hour later was landed
on the north island. A short walk
through the groves of palms brought
them to a cleared spot in the centre
of the narrow island. A little to the
right - hand side were two grassy
mounds close together, and to Cap-


tain Warren’s surprise at the head he
saw a weather-beaten headboard with
an inscription painted on it in English.
Over the headboard was a small
shed, thatched with pandanus leaves,
evidently built by native hands to
protect the inscription from the
fierce rays of a tropic sun.
“Who did this?” he asked of
Taranoa.
“The big captain who came to
seek for them. He stayed here
with us for three days. He and
the ship’s carpenter made this board
and wrote words upon it, and we
promised him to care well for the
graves.”
The American leant down and
read the lettering, which, from the
effects of time, had in parts become
almost undecipherable ;

The captain of the Macedonian
took off his hat and for a minute
or so stood in silence over the
lonely graves. The sinking after-
noon sun sent long arrow-like
shafts of light through the plumed
and silent groves of palm tree, and
the throbbing of the surf upon the
outer reef rose and fell in a soft and
murmuring cadence. Then, with
slow step and a thoughtful face, he
turned away.

net.
This elaborate and exhaustive work has been some
years in preparation under the editorship of Mr. William
P. P. Longfellow, whose name is a guarantee both of
scrupulous accuracy and of literary excellence. No
pains have been spared on the part of either publisher or
editor to obtain the most exact and most recently deter-
mined data concerning the many hundreds of architec-
tural monuments described, and the book is unique both
in its scope and execution. The wealth of illustration
not only illuminates the descriptive text, but decorates it
so effectively as to produce a superb and sumptuous
volume, as well as a useful and instructive dictionary of
the subject. The form and presentation of the work are
in keeping with its unusual and ornate character, and
constitute a fitting dress for a book that has a distinctly
aesthetic as well as a purely scholarly side and purpose.

No writer lias as yet made tin’s period the special
object of his studies ; the few who have written about
it have done so superficially and imperfectly, so that
Cattaneo had the difficult work of retracing Art-history
for nearly six centuries. That this work is recognised
as a standard volume is proved by there already being
French, German, and Italian editions of it. The
English edition is a translation from the Italian, and
contains all the illustrations of the original printed in
Venice by the famous house of Ongania.
CLIMBING REMINISCENCES OF

Alpine Club. Profusely Illustrated. With
Map. by 6J. Cloth, 2is. net. Also an
Fdition on Japan paper bound by Zaehns-
dorf, ss. net.
This work of the well-known Italian climber is pub-
lished in the hope that it may be of use to the increasing
number of English mountaineers who devote themselves
to rock-climbing. In the absence of such an English
guide to the Dolomite region, it is thought that this hook,
describing, as it does, the mountain routes followed with
great accuracy and detail, may supply a want that has
long been felt. It may likewise serve to make better
known a most picturesque and interesting district to
English travellers, and to familiarize them with the
beautiful scenery of the Dolomites.

IN THE KINGDOM OF THE SHAH.
Being the Journey of a Medical man through
Persia. By E. TREACHER COLLINS,
E.R.C.S. Demy Bvo. About 264 pp. 37
Illustrations. 12s.
The author, who went to Persia as oculist to the
Prince Zille Sultan the eldest son of the Shah, and
Governor of Isfahan, describes his journey with his wife
across the great tableland of Iran, from the Persian
Gulf to die Caspian Sea, by caravan, by carriage, and
by chappar horses. The book is full of local colour,
and depicts the customs, arts, superstitions, myths, and
religious beliefs of the Persians. It further touches on
such burning questions as the railway to India, the con-
dition of the Armenians, and the effects of Christian
missions in Mahommedan countries.


THE COURTSHIPS OF QUEEN
ELIZABETH. By Martin A. S.
Hume, F.R.H.S., Editor of the “Calendar
of Spanish State Papers of Elizabeth ”
(Public Record Office). Demy Bvo, cloth,
with Portraits, price 12s.
The author, who is perhaps the highest authority on
Elizabethan foreign policy, has utilised his knowledge of
the State papers to construct a connected account of the
extraordinary series of negotiations for her marriage,
which the Queen during a great part of her life used as an
important factor of her national policy. The diplomacy
of Elizabeth was so unscrupulous, so complicated, and
so tortuous, that ordinary historical text books hardly
attempt to explain it. 'The plan of the present work is
to follow closely through all its turns and twists one clue
of the labyrinth, and thus to give a clearer idea than has
hitherto been presented, of the methods by which the
foundation of England’s greatness was laid. The fact
that the book is bright and interesting does not detract
from its real historical value.

This volume will supply a chapter hitherto missing in
all histories of London. Mrs. Holmes has interested
herself in the Metropolitan Burial Grounds for many


years, ami not only gives antiquarian details about those
that still exist, and tells much about those whose sites
have altogether d sappeared, but also supplies valuable
information about their treatment in the past, the legal
action that has been taken in connection with them,
their present condition and their probable future fate.
The book is written in a chatty style, and the informa-
tion is well up to date.

ENGLAND’S WEALTH IRELAND’S
POVERTY. By Thomas Lough, M.P.
With Diagrams. Demy Bvo, cloth, 7s, 6d,
This book is an enquiry into the economic aspect of
the Irish Question. It does not touch directly upon the
question of “ Home Rule,” but is confined to an investi-
gation of the causes which have led to the present Irish


depression in trade and agriculture and the decrease of
population. Mr. Lough has devoted prolonged con-
sideration to this part of the Irish problem, and he was
one of the witnesses examined before the Royal Com-
mission on the Financial Relations between Great
Britain and Ireland. The book will contain numerous
diagrams and tables illustrating the economic conditions
of the country.

Kogazzaro, Author of “ Daniele Cortis,”
“11 Mistero d’un Poeta,” &c. Translated
from the Italian by F. Thokold Dickson.
Crown Bvo, cloth, 6s. [Ready March i st.
'l'he scene of this powerful story is laid in a haunted
castle in one of the wilder mountain districts of Lom-
bardy. Here dwells the beautiful heroine, Marina,
Marchesina di Malombra, w th her old uncle, a grand
seigneur of the finest type of Italian noblemen. A
family vendetta warps the character, anil darkens the life
of Marina, and its sinister effect influences the course of
her attachment to the young author, Corrado Silla. A
nobler and a purer nature, Edith, also loves him ; and
the story may be briefly summarised as the unconscious
struggle of two antagonistic influences on a man’s life.
If there is much that is sad and tragic in the tale, it has
also its brighter side. Many vivacious and amusing
figures cross the scene, there are lively sketches of life
below stairs, ami, outside the castle walls, the super-
stitious peasant, the parish priest, the bourgeois official,
the country doctor, are painted with great skill, and not
a little humour.
THE AFRICANDER: A Plain Tale of

trated. Crown Bvo, cloth, 6s.
The value of this tale of actual experiences in South
Africa is greatly enhanced by recent events. Chapters
in it deal with Boer characteristics, the salient features
of his life that go to make him what he is, a strange
survival of patriarchal times (with not a little of
patriarchal moralitv), the Boer War, and methods of
attacking him. Details concerning sport, adventure, gold
ami diamond digging, anil Kaffir Wars, complete this
entertaining volume.

PADDY’S WOMAN, and other Stories.
By Humphrey James. Crown Bvo, cloth,
6s,
This book contains not one but several stories. The
title conies from a prominent one amongst them. And
yet, though they are many, they are not wholly distinct
and disconnected. On the contrary, there is not only a
certain homogeneity running through, but the stories
even lead to one another, the principal characters recur,
and are developed, and the final tale serves as a denou-
ment to the whole. The disjointedness, consequently, is
perhaps not greater than between the chapters of an
ordinary novel. Besides, the aim of the book seems
better served in this manner. The Author wishes to
give to use his own phraseology—something Irish,
likely-looking, and not wholly unreadable. For this
purpose he takes a number of characters from the sphere
of life, and from the professions and occupations that
best embody the racial characteristics of the people in
their most sincere and sympathetic manner, and around
these characters he weaves stories which, in the dramatic
interest, are condensed and mouvemcntccs, and in which
the characters are allowed to develop themselves. The
obvious ingenuousness of the narrator (in whose judg-
ments and appreciations of the characters introduced the
judicious reader will probably not always feel called
upon to concur) must be a testimony to their truth and
element in their freshness.

SILVIO BARTHOLI, Painter. By
Emma Bentley. Crown Bvo, cloth, 6s.
There are few who know Italy who have not felt the
charm of the real artist’s studio ; the fac s that look
down upon us from the walls, with their varied tales of
love and hate, of suffering and of hope, the old well-
worn furniture, familiar to us in the pictures we love so
well, the unfinished canvas on the easel. Here is the
painter, with his hopes, aspirations, patient working out
of his ideal, even by his failures. Hence Silvio Bartholi.
While the figure of the venerable priest, Pending his
path of faith through the varied difficulties that the
present age has woven around it, will surely have an
interest for those who want to go below the surface in
considering the great question of the Unity of the

A WINNING HAZARD. By Mrs.
Alexander, Author of “ The Wooing O’T.”
Crown Bvo, cloth, 6s.
An interesting love story, full of human nature, good
and bad characters, lively conversation, and exciting
incidents, is appreciated by all classes of readers. Few
novelists have obtained so warm a place in the hearts of
lovers of good stories as Mrs. Alexander, the Author of
“ The Admiral's Ward,” “ By Woman's Wit,” “ The
Wooing O’t,” &c. She is a woman of sympathetic
nature, cheerful disposition, and with considerable in-
tuition. Mrs. Alexander was born in Ireland. Her
father was a member of the famous Kildare Hunt. She
values greatly a portrait of a paternal ancestor, Lord
Annaly, painted in his peer’s robes. He was one of the
Gore family, of whom no fewer than nine members sat
in Parliament before the Union. Jeremy Taylor and the
Rev. Charles Wolfe were practically the only ancestors
of Mrs. Alexander to whom she can point as distinguished
for literary inclinations. Mrs. Alexander is a leisurely
writer. She says she can do her best work in London
(where “A Winning Hazard” was written), and that
the great city "inspires her.” To know Mrs. Alexander
is to love her, and her books contain much of her in-
dividuality,

(3) OUR JUVENILE OFFENDERS.
By W. Doi.gi.as Morrison, Author uf
"Jews under the Romans,”
In this volume Mr. Douglas Morrison, the General
Editor of the Series, will deal with the extent and charac-
ter of juvenile crime. He will show the effect of sex ami
age on criminal tendencies, and will describe the geo-
graphical distribution of the juvenile criminal population.
He will discuss the physical and mental characteristics of
the juvenile offender: his parental condition, his social
condition, his economic condition. Finally, he will deal
with the institutions at present inexistence for reclaiming
the young criminal, and the methods which are most


likely to be successful in attaining tins result. Mr.
Morrison has a vast amount of personal experience behind
him, and his work will derive additional interest from
the fact that he is dealing with a subject which he knows
at first hand.
MODERN POLITICAL ORATIONS.
Edited by Leopold Wagnek, Author of
“ Names and their Meanings.” Crown Bvo,
cloth, 6s.
Contains: Lord Salisbury—Joseph Chamberlain —
John Burns—John Morley-—Lord Beaconsfield —W. E.
Gladstone John Bright Chas. Bradlaugh T. P.
O’Connor —Lord Brougham—Lord Palmerston -Richard
Cobden Daniel O'Connell —Lord Macaulay—Robert
Peel —Duke of Wellington.
The published speeches of individual British statesmen
have long adorned our library shelves, but this volume
is a distinct new departure. It embraces the finest
examples of Political Oratory of the Victorian Era, that
is to say, from Lord Brougham down to Mr. Asquith,
the present Home Secretary. While the Editor’s aim
has been to include only such speakers as could justly
claim to be orators in the accepted sense of the term,
preference has been given to those speeches, in or out of
Parliament, which created the greatest impression upon
the public mind at the time of their delivery. A work of
this nature should prove very acceptable to politicians,

POEMS AND SONNETS. By J. A.
OSBORNE. With Portrait. Foolscap Hvo,
cloth, ss.
As appears from internal evidence, most of Hie poems
in this little book were written nearly half a century ago.
Not for seven years only, but more nearly seven times
seven, they have been held back. A long and laborious
interval of professional life separates the authorship from
the publication of them, so that the writer may be re-
garded now, and regards himself, rather as the editor than
the author of the hook. They are offered to the public
at last in deference to the wishes ot others who would
not be satisfied -with less in the Author's lifetime, ami
threatened more after his death.

THE STATEMENT OF STELLA
MABERLY. By Herself.
In this narrative “Stella Maberly” tells the story of
the crime of which she is accused, and attempts to
palliate her deed by representing herself as the victim of
a supernatural and strangely horrible persecution, which
she was justified in resisting by every means in her power.
The story is lucidly written, and there is li tie to indicate
the actual state of the writer’s mind beyond the extra-
ordinary nature of the delusion in which she is apparently
a firm believer.
The Publisher has undertaken to keep the Author's
identity a secret for the present.
PAUL HEIN SI US. By Cora Lystek.
This study of Teutonic egotism, appears at a time
when the English mind is largely occupied with the
latest and most sensational development of German
bumptiousness. It is an unvarnished study in black and
white, by one who has long resided in the Fatherland,
of a typical young German of the middle class, a harmless
voting man, swollen with an overweening idea of his
own importance, inflated with the gross vanity which is
fast becoming his country’s curse. How poor Paul,
deeming himself irreproachable, and woefully wickedly
destitute of the saving grace of humour, aspires to fame —
(an acquisition of the English language)—and fortune —
(that of a homely, unattractive, hut extremely sensible
voung woman)—is succinctly related in this unpreten-
tious volume,


GINETTE’S HAPPINESS. Being a
Translation by Ralph Derechef of “ Le
Bonheur de Ginette,” by Gyp.
*** The original of this work has run into nine editions
in France.
The very talented lady, the Comtesse de Martel, who
writes under the pseudonym of “ Gyp,” has so • niversal
a reputation lor writing dialogue of unequalled brilliancy
and wittiness, that it is superfluous to insist on this
feature of her work. It is perhaps less generally known
that Gyp ” can divise a story of the most genuine
human interest, and tell it in masterly style. Her latest
novel offers abundant proof that she possesses these
faculties in a very high degree. There is infinite pathos
in her sketch of the loveless life, and brief spell of
happiness of Ginette, while this serious note is not
allowed to interfere with the humorous interest amply
provided for by the development of the minor characters.

THE SELECT PLAYS OF SIR JOHN
VANBRUGH. Edited, with an Intro-
duction and Notes, by A. E. H. Swaen.
This new volume of the Mermaid Series contains all
the origitial plays by John Vanbrugh, one of the four
great Dramatists of the Restoration, with copious notes
enabling the general reader of the present day to enjoy
to the full comedies that have been praised for their
humour by no less a critic than Leigh Hunt. A special


feature of the Introduction -will be the new light thrown
upon Vanbrugh's birth, parentage, .and marriage. At the
present time we are able to fix the dates of many
important events in the author’s life, and to replace
many erroneous conjectures by facts. In size and general
arrangement the book will be an exact counterpart of
“ Congreve " and “ Wycherley," whilst the text is, too, a
faithful and unexpurgat d reprint of the plays as
originally brought upon the stage.
NEW WHEELS IN OLD RUTS: An
Account of a Pilgrimage to Canterbury via
the Ancient Pilgrims’ Way. By Henry
Parr. With 50 pen and ink sketches by
F. W. R. ADAMS. Crown Bvo, cloth, 3s. 6d.
A wild, almost deserted track, running through the
heart of Kent, and perhaps British in origin, is tradi-
tionally associated with the pilgrims to the Shrine of
St. Thomas of Canterbury. Some of the most interesting
antiquities and scenery to be found in the county lies
upon the route. The book includes descriptions of
Otford, Kemsing, Wroth am, The Stone Circles, Kits
Coty House, Boxley, Lenham, Wye, Chilham, Ac., Ac.
After the precedent of Chaucer and Erasmus, the author
beguiles the tedium of the way with humorous narrative,
sometimes at the expense of his fellow pilgrims. A map
is provided for the guidance of any who may be induced
to follow in the explorer’s footsteps.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CROWDS.
By Gustave Lebon. Crown Bvo, doth,
3 s. 6d.
Under the title of the Psychology of Crowds , M.
Gustave Lebon has written a work in which he discusses
the wild excitement and passionate excesses into whjc|i


assemblages of people are liable to be betrayed. A
crowd, he says, becomes a single person, as it were, and
is capable of perpetrating atrocities which each of its
individual members would shrink from. The impulse
seettis to spring from one dominating mind, and to be
communicated by an unspoken suggestion to all the
others, so that they act with the utmost unity and a
consentaneous purpose. It is a form of collective
insanity, and while it lasts those who are carried away
by it appear to be incapable of thinking rationally, or
of being amenable to any kind of self-control. Hence
the crimes of the Reign of Terror, and massacres like
those which have just occurred in Armenia.
The JOURNAL of JOACHIM HANE ;
Containing his Escapes and Sufferings
during his Employment by Oliver Crom-
well, in France, Irom November, 1653, to
February, 1654. Edited from the Manu-
script in the Library of Worcester College,
Oxford, by C. H. Firth, M.A. Small
crown Bvo, cloth, 3s, 6d. net.
This is p,n account of the adventures of a Cromwellian
officer employed by the Protector as a secret agent in
France. It is printed from a contemporary manuscript
in the Library of Worcester College, Oxford. Hanc
was arrested, threatened with torture, and escaped by a
miracle, and went through as many hairbreadth adven-
tures and hardships as one of Mr. Stanley Weyiran's
heroes. The editor’s preface explains the nature of
1 lane’s secret mission, and gives an account of his life.
Extract from The Times, January nth, 1895; —“In
this ‘Journal of Joachim Hane,’ Mr. C. H. Firth, the
learned editor of the Clarke Papers, edits a minor Crom-
wellian document from a manuscript in the Library of
Worcester College, Oxford. . . . ‘lt is probable that
Hane s mission was more military than political, anti
that he was rather a spy than a political intriguer.’
However this may he, few readers will hesitate to agree
with Mr. Firth that ‘the story of his escapes and wan-
derings is so vivid and picturesque that it seemed worth
rescuing from entire oblivion, even though it throws little
light on the dark places of Cromwell's foreign policy,’ ’
