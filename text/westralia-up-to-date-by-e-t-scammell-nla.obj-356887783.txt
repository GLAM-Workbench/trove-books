(INCORPORATED)
To be opened in COOLQARDIE on MARCH 21st, 1899
UNDER THE DIRECT PATRONAGE OF THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.


WESTRALIA UP-TO-DATE
The Colony of Western Australia has made a Record Progress during the
last Ten Years, and her Industrial Prospects were never so bright as they are
to-day.
The Products of the Colony not only include GOLD, but COAL, COPPER,
LEAD, TIN, and PEARLS; while vast FORESTS of HARDWOOD TIMBER and
immense areas of AGRICULTURAL LAND, suited to cereals and fruits of every
description are found within her borders. The more thoroughly, therefore, the
resources of the Colony are developed, the larger will be her revenue, and the
more satisfactory the Returns on the Capital invested in her various Industries.


GOLD.
In 1886 the output of Gold was 302 oz., valued at £1,147 I2S * od. In 1897 the output was
674>993 oz., valued at £2,564,976 12s. gd., while The Returns lor the 10 months of this year, ending 1
Oct. 31st, are 843,072 oz., worth £3,203,675 14s. 6d. The total output to date is 2,482,692 oz.,
or 76 tons, i cwt. 3 qr. and 11 lbs. (avoirdupois) of Gold, valued at £9,445,332 14s. 6d.
It is estimated that the yield for 1898 will be fully one million ounces.
Western Australia has attained the leading position as a Gold producer in
Australasia, and, as her great auriferous resources are further developed and better
Gold-saving methods are adopted, she anticipates taking the first place among the
Gold producing Countries of the World.


COAL.
Large areas of Carboniferous Country have been discovered in the Colony, the principal
of which, up to the present, are those of the Collie district, situated about 25 miles East of Bunbury,
and connected by a branch line with the South Western Railway. Professor McCoy of the
Melbourne University, writing to the Premier, the Rt. Hon. Sir John Forrest, on June 27th of this year
says— “ The portion of the boring-core which you sent me from the Collie, near the
Port of Bunbury, is an excellent bituminous coal, and being, as you informed me,
3 ft. thick, is of great commercial value.” The Coal has been tested, with highly
satisfactory results.
COPPER, LEAD, AND TIN.
Copper and Lead are found in large quantities in various parts of the Colony, particularly in
the Northampton district, near to Geraldton; while Tin is obtainable at Greenbushes, near to Bridge-
town, on the South Western Railway. The Ores are of high grade.


TIMBER.
There are over 20,000 000 acres ot Forest land in Western Australia, or between
30,000 and 40,000 square miles—the area of Great Britain. The matured and marketable Timber in
these Forests is estimated to be from 60,000,000 to 70,000,000 loads, valued at £120,000,000 sterling,
Jarrah, the paving wood par excellence, occupies an area of some 8,000,000 acres, while Karri, only-
second to it in importance and value, covers 1,200,000 acres. Among the other Hardwoods of the
Colony, Tuart takes the first place, but Wandoo and other Timbers are of considerable
Commercial value.


AGRICULTURE.
Western Australia contains Millions of Acres of land suitable for cultivation.
The following Returns, recently issued by the Agricultural Department, show the productiveness of tne
soil. Wheat averaged in 1897, 10.44, Barley 13.63, and Oats 17.44 bushels to the acre ; while Potatoes
gave 3 tons 15 cwt, to the acre. Some of the Farms have been cultivated for many years without any
dressing beyond ordinary stable manure. The Area of Arable land for 1897 was 65.67 per cent, greater
than that of 1896, while the expansion of Agriculture this year promises a still larger per centage over
1897. The Rainfall for 100 miles or more from the coast is sufficiently large and constant to ensure
successful Agricultural operations, so that for 30 years or more, while the seasons have varied, a failure
has not been known. Large areas of land may be cleared at a comparatively small cost; but, in
most instances, as in some of the lands of the S. W. division, the heavier the cost of clearing, the
more valuable the soil,


FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.
The possibilities of Pruit Culture in the Coastal lands of W.A. are practically unlimited. All
kinds of extra tropical fruits can be grown in abundance, —grapes, oranges, kernel fruits and stone
fruits particularily. There are, at a low estimate, 5,000 square miles of land, omitting unsuitable
portions, favourable to grape cultivation ; while the areas suited to orchards are as large as they are
varied. Vegetables can be grown in the neighbourhood of the coastal towns, and in the alluvial
soils of the river banks, to a degree that is almost incredible.
PASTORAL LANDS.
There are extensive areas suited to the production of Stock, especially in the Northern Districts
of the Colony. But efforts are being made to encourage this industry in the neighbourhood of the
Goldfields, where, notwithstanding the small average rainfall, there are many thousands of acres of
land suitable for the purpose. During the past 10 years the number of Horses, Cattle, Sheep and Pigs
have increased from 50 to 200 per cent


CLIMATE. POPULATION. REVENUE.
The Climate varies according to the latitude. In the South West it is temperate and com-
paratively cool, as this district, in its agricultural and forest belt, possesses a rainfall of from 25 to 37
inches per annum. In the Eastern and Northern Divisions the climate is much hotter, but the atmos-
phere is dry, and the air is pure and bracing, while in some parts a heavy night dew tempers the heat
and materially assists vegetation.
The Population of Western Australia has increased fourfold during the past ten years, and
now numbers over 170,000. This, however, is but a bagatelle—a mere trifle—compared with the vast
area (about a million square miles) and enormous resources of the Colony, which urgently call for the
teeming millions of the older Countries of the World.
The Revenue of the Colony has advanced from for the Year ending June 30th, 1892,
to£2 ,754,746 for the Year ending June 30th, 1898.


CONCLUSION.
These facts speak for themselves, and show that Western Australia is
not only, as it has been termed, a Land of Promise, but a Prosperous Land,
and a Land of Assured Success.
