IRISH HISTORY:
ITS LESSONS TO ENGLAND.
The Irish question is with us in great prominence this year. The
debates in Parliament are full of it; the newspaper columns overrun
with it —the Irish question, the question which Ireland is putting to
England —and that question, shortly stated, is this: An island
endowed with great natural advantages, with admirable harbours,.,
with some of the best grazing and pasture land in Europe, with
great water power for factories and mills, which has been under
England’s complete control for 300 years, and which has been
under her undivided control for the last eighty years, is yet in a state
of chronic discontent and poverty, and regards the English Govern-
ment as a foreign Government. To state the facts is enough to
suggest that a remedy of some sort is needed, and the Irish question
—the question Ireland is putting to England—is, “ What will you
do for us ?” But far more important than the question of Ireland
is, what will be the English answer.
What Answer will England give to Ireland ?
The House of Commons will have to give that answer within the
next month or two ; it is not improbable that you, the electors, will
be called upon to answer that question again within the next four
or five months. It will be one of the most momentous questions
that has ever been put at a General Election in the United Kingdom,
and it will be a question that will require and demand the most
careful consideration at the hands of every elector. It is with the
view of giving you materials to enable you to form a judgment upon
that question that I propose to-night to recount the leading facts of
Ireland’s connection with England, and I propose to do that, as far as
possible, out of the mouths of English governors of Ireland them-
selves, in order that you may not be able to say, by-and-by, “We
have heard very admirable things to-night, but they have been
quotations from Irish sources, and Irish quotations and Irish


opinions are unreliable.” I shall give you the opinions of the
English themselves, and out of their own mouths they shall be
judged. For there is a great danger that in the English answer to
this question we may be tempted to say it is all the fault of the
Irish, because, as Mr. Gladstone said, people appear to suppose
that the Irish had a double dose of original sin to begin with, and
that that accounts for all that has gone wrong since. Or people may
entertain that other belief, that “ God made the world, but the
devil made Ireland,” and that that is why it has gone wrong. Well,
there is a proverb that a bad workman always blames his tools ; and
a Greek philosopher has said that when the sheep go wrong, the
shepherd is to blame; so that it is just possible England may be
inclined to dwell too much upon the faults of the Irish and too little
upon her own faults.
England’s Control oyer Ireland.
Although England came to Ireland as a conqueror 700 years
ago, it is only in the last 300 years that she has had complete con-
trol over Ireland. For the first 400 years, until the reign of
Elizabeth, English authority only extended over a small portion of
the island ; but it prevented the tribes or clans of Ireland from
uniting into a nation, and kept them at war with each other. In
the reign of Elizabeth, by wars of extreme brutality, England com-
pletely conquered Ireland, and in connection with those wars a
great part of the land of Ireland was confiscated. The Irish dress
was abolished by Act of Parliament in 1536, the way the people
wore their hair was altered, and it was provided by the same Act
that everybody should speak the English language. In short, as
Sir John Davis, writing in 1620, says : —“ It was manifest that such
as had the government of England did intend to make a perpetual
separation and enmity between the English and Irish, pretending,
no doubt, that in the end the English should root out the Irish.”
And that view of the way in which the English performed their
duties has been expressed by Mr. Froude, a historian who will not
be suspected of extreme partiality for Ireland, who wrote :—“ The
Irish were not to be blamed if they looked to the Pope, to Spain,
to France, to any friend in earth or heaven, to deliver them from a
power which discharged no single duty that rulers owe to subjects.”
That was the beginning of the English government of Ireland.
The Irish Rebellion.
The confiscation of the land went on, and in 1641 there was a
great and terrible rebellion of the Catholics in Ireland, who
believed, rightly or wrongly, that there was a project on foot to root


out the Catholic religion ; and that rebellion continued more or
less for eleven years. Between 1641 and 1652, out of a population
of 1,460,000, no fewer than 600,000 persons perished by the sword,
pestilence, or famine, half-a-million of whom were Irish, and 100,000
English. The rebellion was suppressed by Oliver Cromwell,
whose method was effectual at the time, though it would hardly be
adopted again. It consisted in giving no quarter to those who
opposed him, and it made peace in Ireland at the cost of a terrible
loss of life and with a fearful legacy of hatred for the future.
So awful was the devastation, that down to quite recently one
of the most terrible maledictions that could be pronounced in
Ireland was, “The curse of Cromwell be upon you."
The Ownership of Land.
That Cromwellian settlement was accompanied by a complete
change in the ownership of the land. Before the Rebellion of 1641,
the Catholics owned nine-tenths of the land; after 1652, the
Protestants owned from two-thirds to four-fifths; and from that
settlement of the land dates the time when the landlords became
out of sympathy with the tenants. Then at the Revolution the
Irish supported James 11., and when they laid down their arms to
his successor, William 111., it was in accordance with the Treaty
of Limerick, by which the Catholics were to have religious freedom
and to retain their land. How those promises were kept you must
judge by the sequel.
The Irish Parliament.
The Irish Government at this time included a Parliament sitting
in Dublin. At that time a Parliament sitting in Dublin was not con-
sidered to break up the unity of the Empire ; but that Parliament
was of rather a curious character. Although the Catholics in Ireland
were two-thirds of the population, none of them had votes, and
none of them were allowed to sit in it as members. It only met
every two years, and its duration was for the King’s life ; so that
one Parliament lasted thirty-three years, during which time there
was no General Election. These particular Parliaments could not be
said to represent very the people of Ireland; but, if they did, there
were plenty of safeguards against their doing anything dangerous to
England. By an Act known as Poyning’s Act every Bill they drafted
was first of all submitted to the Irish Privy Council, mainly composed
of Protestants and Englishmen, who might reject or amend it; and
then it was submitted to the English Privy Council, and if they
rejected it, nothing more was heard of it. If they altered or
amended it, the Irish Parliament might take it or leave it; they


could not alter it back again. Then there was a further safeguard,
in that the English Parliament, in which Irishmen were not repre-
sented, claimed the right to legislate, and did legislate, for Ireland
without consulting the Irish people at all; and many of the laws of
which Ireland complained most were passed by this English
Parliament in which Ireland was not represented.
Protestant Ascendency maintained by Penal Laws.
The population of Ireland contained a very small Protestant
minority, under one-third of the people being Protestants ; but the
policy of the English Government towards Ireland was to maintain
this minority at the expense of the Catholic majority, to maintain
what was called Protestant ascendency; and that was done by a code
of laws known as the Penal Code, which I do not propose to
characterise, though one might use violent language about it. It
applied to two-thirds of the inhabitants of the country. In the
first place, one of the great objects of the Penal Code was to
deprive Catholics of all life as citizens. No Catholic might vote
for a member of Parliament, or sit in Parliament, or be a member
of a corporation, a lawyer, a magistrate, a grand juror, or even a
member of a vestry. He could not be a sheriff, a soldier, a game-
keeper, or a constable. No Catholic could possess or carry any
arms, or serve in the Army or the Navy. In a number of towns no
Catholic could even live, and the town of Bandon was so proud of
this that, as an inscription for the town-gates, Dean Swift wrote —
“ Jew, Turk, and Atheist
May enter here, but not a Papist.”
To which another couplet was added by his Catholic servant —
“ The man who wrote these lines spoke well ;
The same are written on the gates of hell.”
No Catholic could own a horse of the value of more than £ 5, and
so strictly was this law enforced that any Protestant meeting a
Catholic had the right, on tendering him £ to obtain possession
of that horse. On one occasion a Catholic gentleman drove into a
market town with a pair of rather fine horses, and a Protestant
offered him £lO for them, and demanded to buy them ; and the
owner was obliged by the law to sell them. But rather than com-
plete the sale the Catholic drew out his pistol, and shot both horses
dead on the spot. To such an extent was this Penal Code carried
out, that the Judges laid down, in 1759, that “the law does not
suppose any such person to exist as the Irish Roman Catholic, nor
can they breathe without the connivance of the Government.”
Having been deprived of their position as citizens, the Catholics


were next kept in ignorance. No Catholic could be educated at
the University; he was not allowed to keep a school, to act as
usher in a school, or as a private tutor outside a school; £lO re-
ward was offered for the discovery of any Roman Catholic school-
master, and it was a penal offence even to send children abroad to
be educated. Then the Catholics were to be deprived of their
land. No Catholic was to buy land, inherit it, or receive it as a
gift from a Protestant. No Catholic was to hare a house or land
on a lease of more than thirty-one years ; and if any informer dis-
covered that those laws had been violated, and informed against
such person, the house or land was confiscated, and became the
property of the informer; and the Catholic Petition of 1777 declared
that “ there are a set of men who make it their employ to pry into
our miserable fortunes.” It is this practice which explains the
hostility to informers in Ireland. Any Protestant who married a
Catholic, or who suffered his children to be educated as Catholics,
was treated as a Catholic as to his land. Every marriage celebrated
by a Roman Catholic priest between a Protestant and a Catholic
was null and void, and the priest was condemned to be hung. If
the Catholic was a lady and the heiress to the property, the land
went to the next Protestant heir. The effect of these laws was that
the landlords were Protestants and the tenants were Catholics,
and no sympathy existed between them.
A System of Bribes and Spies.
Then there was a gigantic system of bribes to Protestants, and a
system of spies on Catholics. If the eldest son of a Protestant
became a Catholic, it reduced the father from the position of owner
to that of tenant for life. If a Catholic wife, however unfaithful,
left her husband and turned Protestant, he was at once compelled
to make her a separate allowance for her maintenance ; and so if
any child, however young and disobedient, professed himself a
Protestant, he was entitled to receive an allowance at once from his
father, and was removed from his father’s control; sc that there
was a direct bribe offered to Catholics to turn Protestants. No
Catholic could be the guardian of a child; so that all Catholic
orphans were brought up as Protestants. Then, with regard to
Catholic worship, all priests - must be registered, and it was penal
for an unregistered priest to celebrate a service in any way. Any
priest making a convert to Roman Catholicism was punished; any
priest turning Protestant received a pension from the State. There
were rewards for the discovery of unlicensed priests, and no
Catholic bishops were allowed in Ireland under penalty of being
hung, drawn, and quartered.


The Degradation of a Nation.
Now this Penal Code was not the persecution of a small sect, but
the degradation of two-thirds of the nation. I will only quote
two opinions on this state of things, and they shall be the expres-
sions of Englishmen and of Tories. Arthur Young, who travelled
in many countries in the last century, wrote: —“ The scope, purport,,
and aim of the laws of discovery, as executed, are not against the
Catholic religion, which increases under them, but against the
industry and property of whoever professes that religion.” Dr.
Johnson wrote :—“The Irish are in a most unnatural state ; for we
see the minority prevailing over the majority. There is no instance
of such severity as that which the Protestants of Ireland have
exercised against the Catholics.”
Persecution of the Presbyterians.
But it was not merely against the Roman Catholics ; for this
one-third of Ireland that was Protestant was divided into two halves,
one being Episcopalian and the other Presbyterian, and the one
half persecuted the other. The Presbyterians were excluded by the
Test Act from Parliament, from corporations, and from public
offices ; marriages by their ministers were irregular, and conse-
quently the Presbyterians supplied the bulk of the emigrants to
America, and fought against us there. As Grattan says : —“ What
we trampled on in Europe stung us in America.”
Scotland and Ireland.
About the time we tried the experiment of government by a
Penal Code, Scotland began the experiment of being governed by
the Union, and since the Act of Union she has progressed in an
extraordinary manner, as compared with Ireland, a result which is
usually ascribed to the vices of the Irish character and to the
virtues of the Scotch.
The Church of Ireland.
But let us see whether England dealt with Scotland and Ireland
in the same way as regards their Church, their education, their
trade, or their land. In Scotland the Established Church was the
Church of the vast majority of the nation ; in Ireland, she was the
Church of about one-seventh of the people. The Irish Established
Church was the Church of the poor, in the sense that the poor paid


and in no other ; for the Church was supported by tithes, and
the particular tithes that were paid fell very heavily on the poor,
because the Irish Parliament, composed of Protestants and land-
lords, passed a resolution which exempted from tithes all the
pasture lands which were held by the great Protestant landlords,
and threw the tithes on tillage and ploughed land which was held
by the small tenants, who were usually Catholics. What was the
consequence ? About forty years ago a Catholic landlord could
say: —“ I pay tithes in eight parishes. In the whole of these
parishes there is not one church or glebe, or one single resident
clergyman. lam not aware that there is a single Protestant in the
whole eight parishes ; and I do not believe that Divine service,
according to the Protestant ritual, has been celebrated in any since
the Reformation.” And those parishes were not exceptional, for
there were 199 others in an exactly similar position. And this
Established Church of Ireland was not even established for the
benefit of its Irish members, for all the well-paid posts in it were
given to Englishmen. In 1725 an Archbishop said that the
Government under one Viceroyalty had disposed of a year
to strangers, and not £ SOO to natives of Ireland. The Bishops of
that Church were habitual absentees. A Bishop of Down held his
diocese for twenty years, and never, came inside it, but sold the
benefices in London. As Archbishop Bolton said, “ A true Irish
Bishop had nothing more to do than to eat, drink, grow fat, grow
rich, and die.” And Dean Swift penned the bitterest epitaph upon
the Church when he wrote: —“ Excellent and worthy men have
been selected on every occasion of vacancy. But it unfortunately
has uniformly happened that as these worthy men crossed Hounslow
Heath on their way to Ireland to take possession of their bishop--
rics, they have been regularly robbed and murdered by the high-
waymen frequenting that common, who seized upon their robes and
patents, came over to Ireland, and are consecrated in their stead.”
That is from a Dean of the very Church concerning which the
statement is made.
Education in Ireland.
In Scotland an admirable system of parish education was estab-
lished from the first, and it has made her one of the best educated
nations in Europe. But in Ireland the education established in
1733 was that of the Charter Schools, which were founded on this
principle:—“To rescue the souls of thousands of poor children
from the dangers of Popish superstition and idolatry; and their
bodies from the misery of idleness and beggary.” Free education
was to be given, provided it was Protestant, but no one who wished
for Catholic education could get it in Ireland; and, in the words of


Campbell, “a Papist would suffer any loss, except that of his
child, rather than send it to one of these schools ” —which Campbell
calls “the bigotry of these deluded people.” And when John
Howard, the philanthropist, who did such a great and noble work
in English prisons, went to Ireland, about 1780, to inspect these
Chartered Schools, he found “the children sickly, naked, and half-
starved ”; the state of the schools he described as being “so
deplorable as to disgrace Protestantism, and to encourage Popery
in Ireland rather than the contrary.”
How did England deal with the Trade of Ireland ?
Now Scotland had from the first Free Trade under the Union.
Ireland had capacities for certain industries, but not many. She
had admirable pasture land and admirable harbours. The trade in
cattle was an important one for Ireland ; but in 1665 the English
Parliament prohibited the importation into England of Irish cattle,
sheep, pigs, dead meat, butter, and cheese. Why ? Because the
English landowners complained to the English Parliament that the
Irish competition lowered their rents. Irishmen, deprived of this
trade, turned to wool, for which they had great natural advantages,
but in 1699 the English Parliament forbade the exportation of Irish
wool to any country whatever, and 30,000 Protestant families were
thrown out of employment by that Act, simply because the English
manufacturers said that the Irish wool trade interfered with theirs.
Well, then the Irish people turned to linen. England did not
manufacture linen, and they thought that at least they
would be safe here. But it turned out that the Dutch
also manufactured linen, and had been accustomed to exchange
their linen for English wool. Therefore it was feared by the
English manufacturers that if Irish linen supplanted the Dutch
linen, the market for English wool would be lost, and so the English
manufacturers again came to Parliament and succeeded in prevail-
ing upon Parliament to so hamper the Irish trade in linen by a
system of restrictions and bounties that the trade was checked.
‘Next the Irish tried glass, whereupon the English Parliament, in
1744, decreed that, “ whereas the exportation of glass from Ireland
may be of great prejudice to the manufacture of glass in Great
Britain,” it should be prohibited. As I said before, Ireland had
good harbours; but owing to the action of the English Navigation
laws the shipping trade was extinguished. She also had fisheries;
but Folkestone and A 1 deburgh sent petitions to Parliament, saying
that they were “ injured by the Irish catching herrings off Wexford
and Waterford, and selling them in the North Sea,” and they
desired Parliament to prohibit all fishing on Irish coasts, except in
English boats, manned by Englishmen. But this was too strong


even for an English Parliament; the Irish were left at liberty still
to fish on their own coasts, which was something to be thankful for,
though Parliament prohibited Irish boats from fishing in the New-
foundland fisheries. Now, gentlemen, need I describe to you what
was the consequence of a system like this ?
The Testimony of English Observers.
I am anxious to tell you, not in my own words, but in quotations
from a series of English or Irish Protestant observers, who saw
Ireland during that century. Bishop Nicholson, in 1718, writes :
“ Never did I behold such dismal marks of hunger and want as
appeared in the countenance of most of the poor creatures I met on
the road.” One of the bishop’s horses died on the journey, and it
was, he says, at once torn to pieces by sixty people, who consumed
it raw. In 1720 Dean Swift writes: —“Whoever travels in this
country and observes the faces and habits and dwellings of the
natives, will hardly think himself in a land where law, religion, and
common humanity is professed.” And Doctor Sheridan, in 1728,
declares that “ the poor are sunk to the lowest degree of misery
and poverty —their houses dunghills, their food the blood of their
cattle or the herbs of the field.” With reference to that expression,
“ their food the blood of their cattle,” there is a curious Irish
proverb which explains that. The county of Kerry is one of the poorest
of the counties of Ireland, and one of its proverbs says that “ Kerry
cows know Sundays,” because that was the day the cattle were
partly drained of their blood to give food to the Irish peasants.
Bishop Berkeley, writing in 1735, expresses a doubt “ whether there
be upon earth any Christian or civilised people so beggarly,
wretched, and destitute as the common Irish.” And Skelton, in
1750, asserts that “ whole parishes are desolate, the dead have been
eaten in the field by dogs for want of people to bury them.
Thousands have perished—some of hunger and some of diseases
occasioned by unnatural food.” Coming to a later period, in 1787,
a leading member of the Irish Government—Fitzgibbon—writes:
“ The lower order of the people in Munster are in a state of oppres-
sion, abject poverty, sloth, dirt, and misery not to be equalled. I
know it is impossible for human wretchedness to exceed that of the
miserable peasantry in that province. I know that the unhappy
tenantry are ground to powder by relentless landlords. They have
not food or raiment for themselves —the landlord grasps the whole.”
No wonder that an English observer —Dr. Campbell—wrote in the
same year: “We keep the Irish dark and ignorant, and then we
wonder that they can be so enthralled by superstition. We make
them poor and unhappy, and then we wonder that they are so prone
to tumult and disorder.”


The Key to the Irish Difficulty.
And that brings me to what is now and has been for a long while
the key to Irish disorder—the Land question. English legislation
with regard to the trade of Ireland had left the Irish hardly any
outlet for their industry but the land, which accounts for what is
known as “land hunger” in Ireland —the hunger for the only
means of living—and also explains why an eviction from land is
in Ireland frequently “a sentence of death.” Dean Swift, 150
years ago, in 1732, said: —“It is the usual practice of an Irish
tenant, rather than want land, to offer more for a farm than he
knows he can ever be able to pay; and in that case he grows
desperate and pays nothing at all.” That sentence might be almost
written now. But then there were, and are, additional evils. There
were absentee landlords, who lived and spent their rents out of the
country and never came near it; there was a complete lack of
sympathy with the tenant, who was handed over to a system of
middlemen, whose only interest was to collect the rents and to get
as much as they could for themselves. Lord Chesterfield, the Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, wrote in 1760 :—“ The poor people in Ireland
are used worse than negroes by their lords or masters, and their
deputies of deputies of deputies.” And Arthur Young said; —
“The landlord of an Irish estate inhabited by Roman Catholics is
a sort of despot, who yields obedience in whatever concerns the
poor to no law but that of his will. A landlord in Ireland can
scarcely invent an order which a servant, labourer, or cotter dares
to refuse to execute. Were they to complain, they would, perhaps,,
be horsewhipped. If a poor man lodges a complaint against a
gentleman, or any animal that chooses to call itself a gentleman,
and the Justice issues a summons, it is a fixed affront, and the
Justice will be infallibly called out.” Again, Mr. Froude, who is
not likely to be over favourable to the Irish tenants, says:—“ The
landlords of Ireland cared no more for the souls and bodies of
those who were committed to their charge than the drivers of a
West Indian plantation for the herds of slaves whose backs were
blistering in the canefields.” And then the misery of the Irish
tenant was further complicated by another cause. A trade in cattle,
forbidden with England, sprang up with the Continent, and it
became the interest of the landlord to have as much land as
possible thrown into pasture, which paid no tithe, and so he turned
out the tenants to make room for the cattle. John Wesley said :
“ The gentry are continually driving away hundreds—yea thousands
—by throwing such quantities of arable land into pasture, which
leaves them neither business nor food. Thus it is that man dis-
peoples many parts of Ireland.” From this has come that practice
which is unfortunately too common now, and wh ; ch is utterly inex-


cusable —the houghing and mutilating of cattle. That practice
sprang up in Connaught between 1711 and 1713, when the people
found themselves turned out of their land by the cattle, and they
attacked the cattle that turned them out. It appeared again in
the great Whiteboy insurrection of 1761, when murrain on the
Continent had increased the demand for Irish cattle.
Whiteboyism.
Before that time the discontent had been silent and underground,
but then it blazed up for the first time, and the Viceroy (Lord
Chesterfield) ascribed Whiteboyism “to the sentiment in every
human breast that asserts man’s natural right of liberty and good
usage, and that will and ought to rebel when oppressed and
provoked to a certain degree.” The Whiteboys attacked inclosures
of commons, tithes and tithe-jobbers, the turning out of tenants
for cattle, and the confiscation of tenants’ improvements. There
were few murders and no highway robberies in the movement,
and it had no religious bearing, A leading Protestant peer
■(Lord Charlemont) said: —“The real causes of Whiteboyism were
exorbitant rents, low wages, want of employment, large farms let
to monopolising land-jobbers, who sub-let for five times
their value among the wretched starvers upon potatoes and water;
taxes, tithes, which the Catholic, without any possible benefit,
unwillingly pays, in addition to his priests’ money; misery, oppres-
sion, and famine.”
Coercion.
What was the remedy the Government applied ? There was an
English king of whom it was said, “ His mercy went ever before
his sword.” But here the sword of England went far before her
justice. The Whiteboys complained, in 1760, of tithes and the
land question. Tithes were dealt with in 1838 and 1868, and the
land question in 1870 and 1881. There was no hurry in remedial
legislation. But, in the same year (1760), the Government passed
their first great Coercion Act, and a pursuit grew up amongst the
Irish gentlemen of hunting the Whiteboys with bloodhounds,
which was found exceedingly amusing—for the bloodhounSs. No
remedial measures were passed at all; coercion was considered
sufficient. Yet the Lord Lieutenant wrote thus in 1770 : —“I hope
to be excused in representing to his Majesty the miserable situation
of the lower ranks of his subjects in this kingdom. What from
the rapaciousness of their unfeeling landlords, and the restrictions
in their trade, they are amongst the most wretched people on
earth.” And the Knight of Kerry declared, in a sentence that
might be written to-day : —“ The great rents of this country belong to


persons resident out of Ireland, whose agents are severe in collecting
them; the lower orders are in a state of distress beyond anything
known in the memory of man.” But still coercion and no remedial
measures. The tenants who were driven out to make room for the
cattle squatted on the land and subdivided it into small plots, and
there they were harassed by the middlemen for rack-rents ; by
absentee and alien clergy for tithes to a church to which they
did not belong; and for the dues which they willingly paid to
their own priests. A writer of the time says : —“ The landlords
first and sub-ordinates get all that is made of the land, and the
tenants for their labour get poverty and potatoes.” The Devon
Commission, which reported in 1843, said: —“We cannot forbear
expressing our strong sense of the patient endurance which the
labouring classes have generally exhibited under sufferings greater,
we believe, than the people of any other country in Europe have to
sustain.”
From Injuries to Arms, and from Arms to Liberty.
But between 1778-82, nearly 100 years ago, the Irish got some
relief, and it will be interesting to see why they got it. Some
of the restrictions were removed from trade, some concessions
were made to the Catholics, the English Parliament renounced
all claim to legislate for Ireland, and, by the repeal of Poyning’s
Act, the Irish Parliament was freed from the supervision of
the English and the Irish Privy Council. Why ? In the words
of Grattan, “ Ireland’s progress was from injuries to arms, and
from arms to liberty.” What England had refused to reason she
gave to fear, and the armed Volunteers obtained from England
what eloquence in Parliament had not been able to do. When
first the removal of restrictions on Irish trade was suggested, every
town in England went mad. Burke was turned out of his seat for
Bristol for even suggesting that there was anything in the Irish
demand. It was said at the time that “a foreign invasion could
scarcely have created a greater panic.” But the Protestants and
the Catholics in Ireland united in their demand*. Grattan, himself
an Irish Protestant, said : “ The Irish Protestant could never be
free till the Irish Catholic had ceased to be a slave ; ” and he asked
his Protestant brethren the question, “ Are we to be a Protestant
settlement, or an Irish nation ? ” England was at that time
engaged in a war with France, and owing to the demand for troops
for the French and American wars, she had none to spare for
Ireland. The Protestants got leave to volunteer and to arm, and
the Protestants of Ulster—“loyal Ulster”—were the foremost in
arming. These Volunteers, as they were called, once armed,
rapidly grew in numbers to 50,000 men, and they used their arms
and the weakness of the English Government to demand by armed
force what England had refused to eloquence. The Dublin Volun-


teers promenaded the streets of Dublin with two cannons, labelled
“ Free Trade, or this,” and under this pressure in 1779-80 Lord
North gave the Irish partial Free Trade. Then the Irish Parlia-
ment refused to vote supplies to England; as the member who
moved that resolution said: “ England has sown her laws in
dragons’ teeth; they have sprung up in armed men.” They had
risen now to 80,000, and the Lord Lieutenant was obliged to
confess that he had no authority in Ireland. In 1781 the English
Army, under Lord Cornwallis, surrendered to the insurgents in
America, at York Town ; and the next year delegates from 143
Ulster regiments met in the Church at Dungannon, and unanimously
passed a resolution in favour of legislative independence, complete
Free Trade, and complete religious toleration. That was “ loyal
Ulster.” The Lord Lieutenant wrote home that “ there was not a
magistrate or revenue officer who could venture to enforce an
English law. There was not a jury in the kingdom that would
find a verdict under a British Act.” Then came in the Ministry of
Lord Rockingham and Charles James Fox. As Grattan passed
down the streets of Dublin, to move for the legislative independ-
ence of Ireland, they were lined with armed Volunteers, and his
motion was carried unanimously. The Lord Lieutenant wrote to
the Home Government: “If you delay or refuse to be liberal,
government cannot exist here in its present form, and the sooner
you recall your Lord Lieutenant, and renounce all claim to the
country, the better.” Under this pressure the English Parliament
unanimously accepted the legislative independence of Ireland, and
the Act of 1783, in which they granted that independence, is a
curious one in the light of the present debates. It sets forth that
“ the right to be bound only by laws enacted by his Majesty and the
Parliament of Ireland shall be and is hereby declared to be
established for ever, and shall at no time hereafter be questioned.”
“ For ever” was eighteen years.
Grattan’s Parliament.
Now some of you may be inclined to say, “If Ireland had a
Parliament, why was it that Parliament did not prosper, and why
was it taken away ? ” Well, there was a Parliament in Ireland from
1782 to 1800, and this Parliament, usually known as Grattan’s Parlia-
ment, because he was a prominent leader in it, was absolutely inde-
pendent of the Parliament at Westminster, which had no power what-
ever of legislating for Ireland. This Parliament had several faults.
In the first place, it did not represent the people. For nearly half
of its time no Catholic had the right to vote, so that two-thirds of
the people could not vote; and during the whole of its existence
no Catholic could sit as a member. Then the boroughs, which
returned two-thirds of the members, were pocket boroughs. One
of the members —Thomas Sheridan —said: “Are there not many


among us who could not find the way to the place they represent
who never saw a constituent, who were never in their borough, who
at times cannot remember the name of it ? ” In several of the
boroughs there was no elector living; in others there was only one.
The lords who owned the boroughs were known as “ Parliamentary
undertakers.” One family owned thirty boroughs, for which they
could return anybody they liked; ten people returned fifty
members, and two-thirds of the House were returned by a hundred
people ; while in the House of Lords, owing to the absentee
peers, the bishops had a very large influence. Naturally, with
members returned in this way, there was not much responsibility to
their constituents, and consequently there was a great deal of
systematic corruption and bribery. Grattan said ; “ The Minister
sells your Lords, and he buys your Commons.” Curran said: “The
sale of peerages is as notorious as the sale of cart-horses in the
cattle-yard; the publicity the same; the horses not warranted
sound, the other animals warranted rotten,” Said another writer:
“ The majority of Irish peerages are connected with memories, not
of honour, but of shame.” There is a confidential despatch
marked “most secret” from the Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of
Rutland, to the Home Government in 1784, and this is what he
says : “ The peers under the new constitution have more power
than before. Greater attention, therefore, and more expensive
influence, will be required if we mean to direct its progress in the
right way. A share in the lucrative favours of the Government
must be set aside for the purpose of gaining attachments in that
House.” In the Commons there was no shame felt, and no secret
made at all. Fitzgibbon boasted once that half-a-million had been
spent in breaking Parliamentary opposition, and it might be neces-
sary to do it again. One member said —and the House applauded
him for it —“ Did I ever give an honest vote in my life ? ” Then we
have the Whip’s book for 1784. There were 300 members in the
House, and the Government Party numbered 186, all of whom
were accounted for in the Whip’s book. Eighty-six pocket
boroughs had been bought by grants of peerages or pensions;
12 represented pocket boroughs that the Government owned; 44
were placemen, who held positions of advantage, and voted for
the Government in return ; 32 members had promises not yet ful-
filled, and had to vote on this occasion to earn their rewards ; and
12 only out of the 186 were put down as not having been
registered among the applicants for peerages, places, or pensions,
and as supporting the Government “on public grounds.” There
was the regular Opposition of 82, of whom 30 were pocket boroughs
that had not yet been bought, but were in the market; 52 repre-
sented the popular party, and there were 32 waverers. Then there
are notes in the Whip’s book upon various members. Here is
one :—“ H.H., son-in-law to Lord A., and brought into Parliament
by him ; studies the law ; wishes to be a Commissioner of Barracks,


or would go into orders and take a living.” Here is another:
“ H. D. applied for office, but as no specific promise could be made,
has lately voted in opposition. Easy to be had if thought
expedient.” “L, M. refuses to accept per annum. States
very high pretensions from his skill in House of Commons
management. Expects per annum. N.B.—Be careful of
him.” And so on, through a long list of names. A Parliament
like that could not be much good to anybody. Though places and
pensions were restricted in England, such restriction had never
been applied to Ireland, for the Government found it convenient
to buy members by places and pensions, and so the number of
placemen and pensioners sitting in the House was nearly half of
the Parliament. Then there was no responsible Ministry. The
Lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary were responsible, not to
the Irish, but to the English Parliament; so that if the Irish
House condemned them, they had only to come back to England
and account to their masters, the English Parliament.
“ United Irishmen.”
The English Government resisted Catholic emancipation, and
accordingly another society was formed, similar to the Volunteers,
and known as the United Irishmen. That was in 1791, and that
society was founded again by the Protestants of “ loyal Ulster,”
whose success in the matter of the Volunteers had entitled them
again to take the lead. They sought Catholic emancipation, and a
complete reform of the Legislature. In 1793 they obtained so much
Catholic emancipation as Catholics could hope from the English
Government, and Catholics were entitled to vote for members of
Parliament, though they could not sit in the House. In 1795,
Lord Fitzwilliam was sent over; he was in favour of complete
Catholic Emancipation, and determined to carry it; the Irish Parlia-
ment was willing to co-operate with him, but was prevented from,
doing so by the English Government, who recalled him. Then
the United Irishmen, defeated in Parliament, took to underground
and revolutionary means, which ended in the Rebellion of
That rebellion was suppressed in the most savage and brutal
manner by the English Government, and what took place was a
disgrace to any country. Sir R. Abercrombie, the Commander-in-
Chief, said : “ The Army is in a state of licentiousness which must
render it formidable to everyone but the enemy.” Lord Cornwallis,
the next Commander-in-Chief, wrote : “ It shall be one of my first
objects to soften the ferocity of our troops, which I am afraid, in
the Irish Corps at least, is not confined to the private soldiers. The
Militia are ferocious and cruel in the extreme when any poor
wretches, with or without arms, come within their power ; in short,
murder appears to be their favourite pastime. The principal


persons of this country, and the members of both Houses of Par-
liament, are in general averse to all acts of clemency, and would
pursue measures that could only terminate in the extirpation of the
greater number of the inhabitants, and in the utter destruction of
the country. The words ‘priest’ and ‘Papist’ are for ever in
their mouths, and by their unaccountable policy they would drive
four-fifths of the community into irreconcilable rebellion. The
conversation of the principal persons of the country tends to
encourage this system of blood, and the conversation even at my
table, though I do all I can to prevent it, always turns on hanging,
shooting, burning, &c.; and if a priest has been put to death, the
greatest joy is expressed by the whole company.” That man, who
came to Ireland with the intention if possible of doing justice to
Ireland, was called by the Irish Protestants “ Croppy Corny,” and
“rebel,” Yet, in spite of all these disadvantages, Fitzgibbon, a leading
member of the English party, could say of the Irish Parliament
and its work in 1798: “There is not a nation in the habitable
globe which has advanced in civilisation and commerce, in agri-
culture and manufactures, with the same rapidity in the same
period as Ireland since 1782.”
How was the Act of Union passed ?
Pitt, the English Minister, recommended the dissolution of
the Irish Parliament for two purposes—one to get rid of the
corrupt borough-mongers, who would not reform themselves, and
the other to protect Catholics from the Protestants of Ireland ; for
he hoped the English Parliament would at once give Catholic
Emancipation. But there was only one method of carrying an
Act like that through a Parliament of the men it would injure in
their pockets, and that was bribery on a wholesale scale. Lord
Cornwallis, the Lord-Lieutenant who carried it, says : “ My occu-
pation is now of the most unpleasant nature, negotiating and
jobbing with the most corrupt people under heaven. I despise and
hate myself every hour for engaging in such dirty work, and am
supported only by the reflection that without such a Union the
British Empire must be dissolved.” But he adds significantly;
“ The word Union will not cure the evils of this wretched country ;
it is a necessary preliminary, but a great deal more must be done,”
and he goes on to apply to himself Swift’s lines —
“ So to effect his monarch’s ends,
From hell a viceroy devil ascends;
His budget with corruption crammed,
The contributions of the damned,
Which with unsparing hand he strows,
Through courts and senates as he goes ;
And then at Beelzebub’s black hall,
Complains his budget is too small.”


The last two lines were carried in practice by the Secretary to the
Lord Lieutenant, Lord Castlereagh, who was appointed to that post
for the extraordinary reason that “he was so unlike an Irishman.”
He estimated the cost of passing the Act of Union at nearly a million
and a half of money, which was thus distributed:—,£7s6,ooo for
the purchase of boroughs; £'224,000 for the county interest;
£200,000 to barristers; £75,000 to purchasers of seats; and
£"200,000 to the people in Dublin. That was his estimate, but he
found that he actually had to pay £"7,500 for each seat bought; the
owner of each borough with two seats got £ 15,000, and £1,260,000
in all was paid to the owners of boroughs ; besides that forty-seven
peerages were created, and many pensions and places were pro-
vided. As was said at the time, “ the whole unbribed intellect of
Ireland was opposed to the measure ” ; but it was carried, and the
Act of Union, which united Great Britain and Ireland under one
Parliament was passed. We are told that Mr. Gladstone’s Bill is
a “ repeal of the Union.” It is so to this extent, that, if it be
carried, Irish affairs will no longer be dealt with by the Parliament
at Westminster, but, as before 1800, by a Parliament at Dublin.
And why should we cling so fondly to that Act of Union ? It was
born in bribery and bolstered up by bayonets; it was unlovely
in its birth, and unsuccessful in its life ; to the countries it professed
to unite, it has brought not peace but a sword ; and I for one shall
assist with joy at its death and burial, only regretting they have
been delayed so long.
What have been the Results oe that Union ?
By the history of the last eighty years must that Union be judged.
Take, first, the religious question. Pitt and Canning, then in power
in England, anticipated that the English Parliament would at once
remove Catholic disabilities ; but owing partly to the action of the
King, and partly to the House of Lords, Catholic Emancipation was
delayed for thirty years, and not passed till 1829. In 1828
O’Connell was returned for County Clare in face of the opposition
of the landlords, and the Catholic Association, directed by him,
was as powerful as the Volunteers in time past. The Duke of
Wellington, whose Ministry passed Catholic Emancipation, justi-
fied it by the necessity of averting civil war. Out of 30,000 English
infantry, 25,000 had been for some years previously kept in Ireland
Sir R. Peel said that he chose Catholic Emancipation as the lesser
of two evils, the other being incessant agitation in Ireland. Eman-
cipation was given, and the Catholics were free, but it was accom-
panied by a disfranchising measure with regard to the 40s. free-
holders and the tenants who had voted against their landlords, and
had returned O’Connell. Sir Robert Peel said: “The weapon
which the landlord has forged with so much care, and has hereto-
fore wielded with such success; has broken short in hand.” To


quote Lord Anglesea: “ The 40s. freeholders were first established
for electioneering purposes. As long as they allowed themselves
to be driven to the hustings like sheep to the shambles, without a
will of their own, all was well. But the moment these poor people
found out the value of their tenure, the moment they exercised
their power constitutionally, that instant they are swept out of
political existence.” Mr. Brownlow, an Ulster member, said:
“From 1793 to 1825 the county voters were not free agents. They
were driven by their landlords to the county town, and locked up
there until they gave their votes for their landlords’ favourite
candidate.” And Archdeacon French, writing in 1825, declares :
“ I have seen herds of voters driven to the poll, like cattle, by a
man with a large whip, riding on a mule.” Mr. Stanley, the
Irish Secretary, said: “ The 40s. freeholders were practically
nothing more than a part of the live stock upon the estate of the
landlords.” But now the “ live stock ” had rebelled, and voted
against their landlords; and Sir Robert Peel discovered that
“the present exercise of the 40s. franchise is liable to abuses,
which require decided and uncompromising reform. The landlord
has been disarmed by the priest.” No wonder Lord Holland
wrote: “I am not over fond of the influence of the Roman Catholic
priests, but if the people are to be driven to the poll at elections
like gangs of slaves, or herds of cattle, it may be as well that they
should be driven by drivers of their own choice.” However, the
40s. freehold was raised to £\o, and 175,000 voters were dis-
franchised for voting against their landlords.
Then came the Question of Tithes,
which had started Whiteboyism seventy years before. They were
still paid by the Catholic poor, although a commutation had been
suggested by leading statesmen for many years—by Pitt in 1786
and in 1800; by the Duke of Bedford in 1807 ; and by Lord Althorp
in 1824. The population now was about 8,000,000, and consisted
of 1,510,000 Protestants —including 850,000 Episcopalians, and
660,000 Protestant Dissenters —and 6,420,000 Catholics, the latter
paying for the support of the Church of the 800,000 Episcopalians.
In forty-two parishes there were 122,000 Catholics, and 320 Protes-
tants. No wonder that the peasants resisted tithes ; and they did it
with a vigour far surpassing anything we hear of now. In the
struggle known as the Tithe War, between 1831 and 1838, at
Carrickshock, eleven policemen were killed and seventeen
wounded, and many peasants were killed and wounded. At Gortroe
twelve peasants were killed and forty-two wounded, and many
police were wounded. In Doon one cow was sold with the assistance
of five companies of the 92nd Highlanders, sixty men of the 12th
Lancers, a strong force of police, and two pieces of artillery, and
in the presence of 4,000 peasants, who afterwards had a skirmish


with the police, and naturally got the worst of it, many being
wounded. Ultimately a compromise was proposed by which tithes
were to be commuted, and a part of the superfluous revenue of the
Church was to be taken away. In 1833 was first introduced a
particular clause applying the revenues of the Church of Ireland to
national purposes, called the Appropriation Clause. That clause
was thrown out in the Lords. In 1834 the Tithe Abatement Bill
was introduced and thrown out in the Lords. In 1835 the
Appropriation Clause was again introduced and rejected by the
Lords. In 1836 it was again introduced and again rejected by the
Lords. In 1837 the King died, and in 1838 the Government at last
were obliged to get the Bill passed by abandoning the Appropria-
tion Clause, and that clause did not pass until 1868, in the Irish
Church Act.
Why was the Irish Church Disestablished ?
Why was that Act of 1868 passed ? Mr. Gladstone has told us :
“the influence of Fenianism was this —that when the tranquillity of
the great city of Manchester was disturbed, when the Metropolis
was shocked and horrified by an inhuman outrage, then it was these
phenomena came home to the popular mind, and produced that
attitude of attention and preparedness on the part of the whole
population of this country which qualified them to embrace, in a
manner foreign to their habits in other times, the vast importance
of the Irish controversy.” And so it is a fact that the Irish Church
Act was enabled to be passed by a murder at Manchester and an
explosion in London. Well, Catholic Emancipation was supposed
to place Catholics in the same position as Protestants; but it is one
thing to have the letter of the law, and another to have the spirit.
The Protestant Ascendency in Ireland has been' strictly
MAINTAINED.
Protestant ascendency was defined in 1798 as “a Protestant King,
a Protestant Parliament, a Protestant hierarchy, Protestant electors
and Government, the bench of justice, the army and the revenue,
through all their branches and detail Protestant.” At the present
time three-quarters of the population of Ireland are Catholic, yet
only three Irish Viceroys have been appointed since 1700, and all
of them, by statute, have been Protestants. The Chief Secretaries
have almost always been English and Protestant; and Lord
Castlereagh, the most prominent exception, was appointed because
“he was so unlike an Irishman.” The Privy Council to-day is
Protestant. Of the twenty- nine officials at Dublin Castle, twenty-
seven are Protestants. The magistracy in Ireland are almost
entirely Protestant. In the county of Fermanagh, Ulster, the


Catholic population is 47,000, and the Protestant 37,000, and there
are seventy-seven Protestant magistrates and one Catholic. In
Cork the Catholics are ten to one of the Protestants, and yet
there are 286 Protestant magistrates against 107 Catholics, and
the Government officials in Cork consist of 1,190 Protestants and
185 Catholics. Then take the Irish Constabulary; there are 227
Protestant officers and only forty-five Catholics. In Belfast, out
of a population of 200,000, there are 60,000 Catholics, and yet
there is no Catholic in the Town Council, and only one or two
Catholics in the employ of the Corporation. That is the way in
which, while the letter of the Act of Catholic Emancipation has
been passed, the spirit of Protestant ascendency has been maintained.
The Franchise.
The Irish Reform Act of 1832, which Sir Erskine May calls “the
least successful of the great Reform Acts,” only raised the Irish
electorate in counties from 26,000 to 30,000. In 1835 and 1837,
Bills to assimilate the English and Irish franchise were thrown
out by the Lords; and in 1841 and 1848, similar Bills were
abandoned. In 1850, the percentage of voters to adult males —
which in England was 28 per cent., in Wales 32 per cent., and in
Scotland 25 per cent. —was only 2 per cent, in Ireland. Registra-
tion took place once in eight years, and a man must pay some
fifteen taxes before he could be registered. In 1850, a proposal to
reduce the/' 15 rating franchise to £S was defeated by the Lords,
who substituted £l2, enfranchising thus only 50,000 instead of
144,000 voters. Up to 1885 the borough franchise in Ireland
stood at though England had household suffrage since 1867;
as a consequence, while one-seventh of the borough population in
England had votes, only one in eighteen had a vote in Ireland.
Under the Franchise Acts it was only last year that Ireland had
justice done to it. English corporations were reformed in 1835.
The Government in the same year proposed a measure for the
reform of Irish corporations, which, though Protestant, were full
of abuses; but it was too late for the Lords to pass it that year. In
1836, the House of Lords rejected 106 out of the 140 clauses, and
proposed to abolish all corporations as likely to become “ normal
schools of agitation,” though they had never objected while the cor-
porations, though corrupt, were Tory and Orange nurseries. In 1837,
1838, and 1839, the Lords made amendments which caused the Bill
to be dropped, and at last, in 1840, the Commons were obliged to
give in, and the Lords had their own way, and fixed the municipal
franchise in Ireland at £lO, though England had household
suffrage. This £lO rating meant /20 rental; as a consequence,
Belfast, with 208,000 people, has 5,700 municipal voters; while
Newcastle, with only 145,000, has 26,250.


The Land Question.
The attempts to deal with the Irish Land question have been
constantly frustrated by the English House of Landlords. The one
great attempt made to govern Ireland justly in 1835-41, under
Lord Mulgrave and Thomas Drummond, was frustrated by the
action of the House of Lords with respect to Tithes, and the
Parliamentary and Municipal Franchise. In 1830 they had thrown
out a Bill for reclaiming waste lands as introduced too late in the
session, though eight days after they passed a stringent Coercion
Bill through all its stages.
The Duties of Property.
In 1838, when Mr. Drummond was Secretary for Ireland, he used
these words :—“When the character of the great majority of serious
outrages occurring in many parts of Ireland is considered, it is
impossible to doubt that the causes from which they mainly spring
are connected with the tenure and occupation of land.” And then
he adds a sentence which ought to be engraved on every landlord’s
heart: —“ Property has its duties as well as its rights. . . . To the
neglect of those duties in times past is mainly to be ascribed that
diseased state of society in which such crimes take their rise; and
it is not in the enactment or enforcement of statutes of extra-
ordinary severity, but chiefly in the better and more faithful per-
formance of those duties, and the more enlightened and humane
exercise of those rights, that a permanent remedy for such disorders
is to be sought.” That letter was suppressed by the landlords of
Tipperary because they thought it was a dangerous one. Since the
Act of 1828, sub-division, which now gave no votes, had no benefits
for the landlords, and evictions to consolidate holdings took its
place. These evictions were effected without a thought for the
future fate of the tenant, or any compensation for the improve-
ments he alone had made. The Devon Commission reported in
1843 in favour of compensation for tenants’ improvements; but
when the Tory Government introduced a Bill to give effect to it, it
was thrown out by the House of Lords. A similar Bill was thrown
out by the Lords in 1853-54, and in 1853 Sir J. Napier said:—
“It is notorious that every leading statesman has given an avowed
sanction to the principle of a Tenant Compensation Bill for Ireland,
but it is notorious that the House of Lords will pass no such
measure.” And it was not till 1870 that such a measure—though
even then an imperfect one, owing to the mutilations of the House
of Lords—was ultimately passed, thirty-seven years after the Devon
Commission had reported in its favour. And even since the Land
Act of r 881 evictions have been constant.


What does an Eviction Mean ?
In seven years—between 1849 and 1856 —a million and a half of
people left Ireland for America, a quarter of a million of whom
had been evicted. Again I quote Grattan’s words: “ What you
trample on in Europe will sting you in America.” Speaking of
evictions, Professor Cairnes says : “ Most frequently the evicted
tenant has for himself and those dependent upon him absolutely no
means of support, or place of shelter outside his farm. The evic-
tions have almost invariably taken place for the purpose of con-
solidating farms; even where non-payment has been the legal
ground, the pulling down of the tenant’s house has been an almost
constant incident in the scene —an incident too generally performed
in the sight, if not over the very heads, of the retiring family, who
are thrust forth, it may be, in mid-winter, frequently half naked
and starving. In the rare instances in which they have saved
enough to procure them a passage to New York, they will probably
emigrate at once ; where this is not the case they will cower, often
for days and weeks together, in ditches by the roadsides, depending
for their support upon casual charity.” This is what is meant by
an eviction in Ireland, and since the Land Act of 1881 there have
been 60,000 people evicted in Ireland, and last year 18,000. Do
you wonder that there is discontent ?*
No Delay in applying Coercion Acts.
And now I come to a class of Acts there has been no delay in
applying. Coercion Acts have been as plentiful as blackberries.
Only during thirteen years since the Act of Union was passed has
Ireland been free from Coercion Acts, and only two years since
1883 have been without them. I was struck by reading Mr.
Chamberlain’s remark in a recent speech: “If you are going to
carry this scheme in opposition to the wishes of one-fifth of the
people of Ireland, how are you going to enforce it ? Are you
going to apply coercion to the loyal and law-abiding popula-
tion?” To which I would say that if they are law-abiding they
will not need to be coerced to obey the law; and I would ask,
“ What about the four-fifths who have been habitually coerced
since the Act of Union ? ”
The Moral.
Now at the end of fairy tales and lectures there comes the
moral, and I think you have sufficient intelligence to draw the
moral of this lecture yourselves.
* 1878 to 1885: writs for eviction, 20,958; writs for rent, 43,756; and each
of these covers a whole family.


In the first place, we never have yet tried the experiment of trusting
the people of Ireland. We have always assumed that we knew better
what was good for them than they did themselves. Is it not time
that we tried the experiment of letting them govern themselves ?
The one thing essential for the remedy to be applied to the present
crisis is that it should satisfy the people of Ireland.
Secondly, when we have tried to give them remedial measures of
justice they have been always too late. Catholic Emancipation was
passed at least twenty-nine years too late. The Devon Commission
reported in favour of a Land Bill in 1843 ; it was not till 1870 that
the Bill was passed. The Tithe War took place in 1831; it was not
till 1868 that the Irish Church Act was passed. How can we
expect that Ireland should look with gratitude on measures delayed
so long ? The remedy that we offer now will lose all its efficacy, if
we delay it till its concession excites no gratitude.
And then, thirdly, where these measures have been passed , what has
been their immediate cause? Whether they were passed for this
reason or not, Ireland has been always able to say they have
been conceded to agitation, and not to justice. The justice
of the thing was the same thirty years ago as at the time
when they were passed. Tithes were dealt with because of the Tithe
war; the Irish Church Act was passed only after the Clerkenwell
explosion; the Irish Land Act only became law after a system of
outrages in Ireland; Grattan’s Parliament was won by the Volun-
teers ; Catholic Emancipation was conceded to the “ United Irish-
men.” Said Macaulay, “ The Irishman was taught that from Eng-
land nothing is to be got by reason, by entreaty, by patient endur-
ance, but everything by intimidation. That tardy repentance
deserved no gratitude, and obtained none.”
Fourthly, does it not occur to us also that coercion has been proved to
be useless ? It has been tried eighty-five years, and it has not
succeeded. Lord Cowper, whose Jast appearance in public was at
the exhibition of a happy family at the Opera House, boasted that
he had driven discontent beneath the surface ; the very worst place
he could drive it to. In the words of Burke : “ I hope that mutual
affection will do more for mutual help and mutual advantage between
the two kingdoms than any tie of artificial connection. lam con-
vinced that no reluctant tie can be a strong one, and that a natural,
cheerful alliance will be a far securer link of connection than any
principles of subordination borne with grudging and discontent.”
And now I wish to end with the remarks of one of the greatest
friends of Ireland in this century —the remarks of John Bright.
Eighteen years ago there was an outbreak of Fenianism in Ireland,
and the Government brought in a Coercion Bill. John Bright then
said, in a speech of remarkable truth and prophetic force : “ There
is no statesmanship merely in acts of force and acts of repression.
And worse than that, I have not observed since I have been in
Parliament anything on this Irish question that approaches to the


dignity of statesmanship. There have been Acts for the suspension
of the Habeas Corpus Act, like that which we are now discussing ;
but there has been no statesmanship. Men, the most clumsy and
brutal, can do these things; but we want men of higher temper—
men of higher genius—men of higher patriotism, to deal with the
affairs of Ireland.” And he goes on : “ All history teaches us that
it is not in human nature that men should be content under any
system of legislation and of institutions such as exist in Ireland.
You may pass this Bill, you may put the Home Secretary’s five
hundred men into gaol —you may do more than this, you may
suppress the conspiracy and put down the insurrection—but the
moment it is suppressed there will still remain the germs of this
malady, and from those germs will grow up, as heretofore, another
crop of insurrection, and another harvest of misfortune. And it
may be that those who sit here eighteen years after this moment”
—in January, 1886 —“will find another Ministry and another Secre-
tary of State ready to propose to you another administration of the
same ever-failing and ever-poisonous remedies. I say there is a
mode of making Ireland loyal. I say that the Parliament of
England, having abolished the Parliament of Ireland, is doubly
bound to examine what that mode is, and, if it can discover it, to
adopt it.” And then Mr. Bright went on, in another prophetic
passage, thus : —“Take the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Is there
in any legislative assembly in the world a man, as the world judges,
of more transcendent capacity ? I will say even, is there a man
with a more honest wish to do good to the country in which he
occupies so conspicuous a place ? Suppose it were possible for
this man, with his intellect, with his far-reaching vision, to examine
this question thoroughly and to say for once —whether this leads to
office and to the miserable notoriety that men call fame which springs
from office, or not —* If it be possible, we will act with loyalty to
the Sovereign and justice to the people ; and if it be possible, we
will make Ireland a strength and not a weakness to the British
Empire.’ ” The Chancellor of the Exchequer to whom that appeal
was addressed is now the Prime Minister of England. He has
answered Mr. Bright’s appeal. At the close of a life spent in the
service of his country, the most distinguished feature of which has
been his ever-widening trust in the people and the conferment of
just measures too long delayed on Ireland, he has taken up Mr.
Bright’s challenge. He has framed a measure which he believes
will settle the Irish question; and what I ask you to-night is to
remember that a measure framed by such a man deserves your
most careful consideration. I ask you to consider it between now
and the General Election, and then deal with it in the spirit of Mr.
Bright’s remark, that if possible you may make Ireland a strength
and not a weakness in the British Empire.
