PROGRESS AND RESOURCES
OF
NEW SOUTH WALES.
I. DISCOVERY AND EARLY HISTORY.
The Portuguese claim to be the first civilized people who discovered the
continent of Australia, and it is probable that long before any systematic
attempt was made to explore the coast line, Malays and perhaps Europeans,
on their way to the markets of the East, sighted the rugged, uninviting
shores, but the first explorations in Australian waters of which there are
any authentic records were made in 1600 by the Dutch in a ship called the
“ Duyfhen,” from Bantam. Other navigators after this visited the Great
South Land at intervals, many of the expeditions being attended with tragic
vicissitudes, but no attempt was made either to colonise or form trading
stations in the country until after the return of Captain James Cook and
Sir Joseph Banks, who had in the “ Endeavour ” made extensive explorations
and surveyed the East coast of the continent, which they called New South
Wales. Their report of the country attracted the attention of English
statesmen to the vast territory which was occupied only by a race of black
savages, and in 1787 it was determined by the English Government to form
a penal settlement on the East coast, which had been taken possession of by
Cook in the name of Great Britain. Tn January of the following year the
“ first fleet ” cast anchor in Port Jackson, and Captain Arthur Phillip, the
Governor of the colony, set to work to land those under his care at Sydney
Cove.
During the early days of settlement almost insurmountable difficulties
were met with, and more than once the little band of pioneers were on the
verge of destruction from starvation. But as time went by and land was
put under cultivation the prospects of New South Wales greatly improved.
Immigrants arrived in considerable numbers, and the penal establishment
became transformed into a colony of free settlers. Eor some years growth
was cramped by the mountain barrier which runs a short distance from the
coast the whole length of the country, and which no one had been able to
penetrate, although several attempts to do so had been made. The rapidly
increasing flocks and herds of the settlers became too numerous for the
restricted pastures, and in periods of drought the losses from want of grazing
land were lamentably heavy.
In 1813 this disadvantage was removed by Messrs. Blaxland, Wentworth,
and Lawson, who found a pass over the mountains and caught a glimpse of
the fertile plains beyond. A road was soon made, winding between craggy
summits and bare precipices, and all obstacles to expansion being gone, the
settlers in large numbers drove their sheep and cattle to the new-found
territory. Eor the first forty years of the colony’s existence the government
was placed almost entirely in the hands of a Governor appointed by the
A


English Secretary of State, but in 1828 a small Council was created to
advise him, and thenceforward the constitutional liberties enjoyed in Great
Britain were gradually conferred on the inhabitants of New South Wales.
Although the powers and duties of the local Council were enlarged from
time to time, that body was for some years a nominee, and not a popular
assembly. As the people increased in numbers the demand for autonomy
became louder, and in 1843 a new Constitution was granted, establishing a
Council two-thirds of the members of which were to be elected by the
inhabitants and one-third nominated by the Crown. At this time the
Colony passed through a trying ordeal, and experienced a period of acute
depression in which its pastoral possessions, the chief source of wealth,
almost ceased to have any marketable value. The enormous growth follow-
ing the discovery of the pasture lands in the interior had caused reckless
speculation and unreasonable inflation of prices, and there followed a
corresponding collapse of financial and commercial enterprise. But in spite
of the gloomy outlook the agitation for entire political freedom continued,
and in 1850 the colony was invited by the English Government to draw
up a Constitution for itself, suitable to its special requirements. While
these events were occurring Mr. Hargraves, who had visited the Cali-
fornian goldfields but had returned to New South Wales, discovered gold in
payable quantities near Bathurst, and the prospects of the settlement were
suddenly completely changed. A mighty rush of population from all
quarters of the globe took place, and for a short time the whole colony was
engaged in one big gamble for gold But the fascinating attractions of the
goldfields permanently benefitted New South Wales, for they
country under the notice of the more enterprising spirits of the old world
as a suitable place in which to form a new home. In 1856 a Constitution
creating two Houses, one elective and one nominee, came into operation,
and the advantages of Responsible Government have since been enjoyed by
the people. Under the new conditions there has been wonderful develop-
ment in every department of national prosperity. Steam communication
with Europe was established in 1853, and 19 years later a cable was opened
for the transmission of messages between England and Australia. The
country is traversed by great trunk lines of railway, and public works of
all descriptions have been vigorously pushed forward, while commerce and
industry have increased with marvellous rapidity.
11. PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION AND CLIMATE.
New South Wales falls into three great natural divisions—the eastern
seaboard, 38,200 square miles in extent, the central plateau, embracing
84,900 square miles, and the western plains, which cover 187,600 square
miles. At a distance, varying from 25 to 120 miles from the coast, a range
of mountains from 3,000 feet to 7,000 feet in height stretches from north
to south, rising abruptly on the eastern and seaward side and sloping gently
towards the plain lands of the interior. The coast-line is indented with
numerous fine harbours, and many streams flow down the eastern slopes of
the mountains through districts undulating with hill and valley, and, after a
course bordered by rich alluvial flats adapted to every kind of cultivation,
discharge into the Pacific Ocean. The tableland or central plateau, which
is 100 miles in breadth at the southern extremity, gradually narrows towards
the north until it is only a few miles across. The western watershed is
drained by several large navigable rivers, which wind a sinuous course
through the distant plains.


The coastal region has a mild and pleasant climate, resembling that of
Southern Europe, but the average temperature has a smaller range and the
winters are far less severe ; indeed, the natural salubrity of the Pacific Slope
is unsurpassed, even by the famed resorts of the Mediterranean seaboard.
The town of Kiandra on the southern plateau has a temperature corresponding
to that of Dumfernline, in Scotland, while the climate of New England,
situated on the tableland more to the north, is as near perfection as possible.
The western plains are not so pleasant, the summer in some places being
very hot, but the air is dry and the nights generally cool and refreshing.
The winters even in this portion of the Colony are most enjoyable, the mean
reading of the thermometer being 52 3°, and the sky usually clear and bright.
The rainfall varies in different localities from 63‘2 inches on the northern
coast to 13-7 inches on the western plains.
The seaward side of the Great Dividing range averages about 48 inches,
the tableland 32 inches, and the western interior 17 inches per annum.
ill. SETTLEMENT.
At various stages of the country’s progress and development, widely
different systems for the settlement of an industrial population on the lands
of New South Wales have been in force. In the early days land was alie-
nated by grants, orders, and dedications solely at the discretion of the
Governor. In this way, grants, frequently of extensive areas, were made in
favour of naval and military men and free emigrants. In 1831, a change
was effected, and regulations for the sale of rural lands and urban allotments
by auction were introduced, the minimum price of country lands being fixed
at ss. per acre. In 1837, the minimum price was raised to 12s. per acre,
and in 1843 the rate was further increased to 20s. per acre, with liberty to
select at the upset price country portions offered and not bid for, or the
deposit on which had been forfeited. This system lasted until the abrogation
of the order in Council, and the introduction of new legislation by the Par-
liament of New South Wales. Previous to the Act of 1861 becoming law,
alienations of land had been as follows: —
Acres.
Area alienated under Surveyor-General Oxley, previous to Ist January,
1828 1,617,542
Total area of land alienated as per return and Government Map, 1837 ... 4,418,758
Total area of land alienated in all forms previous to 1861 7,338,539
The circumstances of the Colony were greatly altered by the discovery of
gold, and the question of land settlement had to be dealt with in an entirely
new spirit to meet the wants of a class of immigrants of a different type
to those contemplated by former enactments. The measure of 1861 was
intended to facilitate the settlement of an industrial agricultural population
side by side with the pastoral tenants by means of free selection in limited
areas before survey. To this privilege was attached the condition of bona
■fide residence, and the land was to be sold at a fixed price, payable by instal-
ments, or partly remaining at interest. Unconditional sales still took place,
and, during the twenty-three years the Act of 1861 was in force, 23,470,140
acres were sold conditionally, and 15,572,001 acres by auction, or otherwise
without conditions. In a very large number of cases the land selected, or
purchased, reverted to the State, so that the absolute area sold or in process
of sale, when the Act of 1884 came into operation, amounted to only
40,157,562 acres.


There were originally regulations under which any person might apply for
a license to occupy runs on Crown lands, the extent of which was only
limited by the boundaries of the surrounding stations. The fee or rent was
£lO per year for a section of 25 square miles, or 16,000 acres in extent,
£2 10s. per annum being charged for every five additional square miles.
The Imperial Act of 1847 rendered it lawful for the Crown to make or alter
regulations for the sale and occupation of waste lands, and almost imme-
diately an entirely different system for pastoral occupation was introduced.
Hitherto the tenure had been a yearly one, and the fee paid calculated on
the extent of land occupied, but now fixity of tenure for a term of years was
substituted, and the rent was based upon the stock-carrying capacity of the
runs. The country was divided into three parts —the settled, the inter-
mediate, and the unsettled districts. Eor the last division the term of the
pastoral leases was fixed at fourteen years ; in the intermediate division, at
eight years ; and in the settled districts the yearly tenure was retained. The
licensing fee was at the rate of a minimum of £lO for 4,000 sheep, or a
corresponding number of cattle ; and £2 10s. for every additional 1,000
sheep, or an equivalent number of cattle. In the settled districts lands were
let for pastoral purposes only, in sections of not less than one square mile,
at an annual rental of 10s. The Occupation Act of 1861, which abolished
the orders in Council, again changed the system, and limited the tenure of
pastoral leases to five years in the unsettled and intermediate districts,
leaving the whole of the pastoral leases open to free selectors. The Act of
1861 was, after many amendments, repealed in 1884, and a new Land Act
passed, which was amended in 1889. Though differing widely in many
important particulars, these measures maintain the principle of free selec-
tion before survey, but with an essential difference. Under the Act of 1861
the whole area of the alienated lands was thrown open to free selection, the
result being that grave difficulties were created between the pastoral and
agricultural settlers, but while retaining selection before survey, greater
security of tenure was afforded to the squatters by the new law. The
whole colony is now divided into districts, under the charge of local Land
Boards and Land Agents, and a Land Court has been established to hear
appeals against the decisions of the local Boards.

IV. PASTORAL INDUSTRY.
When the first expedition landed at Sydney Cove the live stock in
possession of settlers comprised only one bull, four cows, one calf, one stallion,
three mares, three foals, twenty-nine sheep, twelve pigs, and a few goats, but
the suitability of the country" for pastoral pursuits soon induced the most
enterprising of the colonists to turn their attention to the breeding of sheep
and cattle and the growth of wool. Captain Macarthur made special efforts,
by systematic selection and the importation of the best sheep procurable, to
improve the strain, and after a short time was rewarded by the production
of a fleece of very fine texture, which met with a ready and remunerative
market among English manufacturers. The difficulties ot transport in these
early days were very great, but numerous importations were made from India
and elsewhere. Some rams and ewes of a very fine breed, which had been
presented by the King of Spain to the Dutch Government, were successfully
brought from the Cape, and a few years later some additional specimens of
the same noted strain were obtained by Macarthur from the Royal flocks in
England. Thenceforward wool-growing became the most important industry
of the country, and the number of sheep depastured has increased very
rapidly. The progress of sheep-breeding may be seen in the followinrg
table :

The ratio of increase for the whole period has been 7.8 per cent, annually,
but in some years there was an actual decline. Were it not for the losses
occasioned by droughts the flocks of the colony would doable themselves in
four years, but the loss from the cause named is sometimes very heavy. In
1884, for instance, it is estimated that owing to the absence of increase from
lambing and the extraordinary mortality among breeding stock, the loss
through the adverse season must have amounted to at least 8,138,000 head,
which at ss. each is equal to £2,034,500. Were there not some check of
this description it is not improbable that the flocks of New South Wales
would soon reach the stock-carrying capacity of the country, but the
capabilities of the Colony in this respect are very hard to gauge, for with the
advance of settlement they may be greatly increased by water-conservation,
irrigation, and the of drought-resisting plants and shrubs.
The climate is so genial that there is no necessity to house stock which
may be safely left in the open air even during the winter months. The old
method of tending sheep was to place them under the charge of a shepherd
and let them wander at will unconfined, but it has been found that a station
can be more economically worked, and that better fleeces and a higher per
centage of lambs can be obtained by the subdivision of the run into paddocks.
At the present time about 98 per cent, of the sheep are paddocked, the small
balance being still under the care of shepherds. When the sheep are
sheared the wool is packed at the station in bales weighing 450 lb., from 4 ft.
6 in. to 5 ft. 3 in. in length, and 2 ft. 2 in. in depth and breadth. On arrival at
the port of shipment these bales are “ dumped ” in a hydraulic press, and when


stowed in the ship are less than half their original length. About 99 per
cent, of the wool is now shorn in the grease, and the weight thus obtained
averages 5 lb. 9 oz. per sheep and 1 lb. 15 oz. per lamb, but if washed the
weight of fleece is reduced to about 2 lb. 14| oz. and 1 lb. 4| oz. respectively.
Some years ago only about half the wool annually produced was shipped
from New South Wales ports, the balance being exported to Europe, via the
ports of the neighbouring provinces, but owing to improved railway commu-
nication the proportion has increased to 72 per cent. The navigable state, or
the reverse, of the rivers of the interior governs to a large extent the place
of shipment of' the clip from the far western districts of the country.
The pastoral interests are so extensive that the fluctuations in the value of
wool in the consuming markets greatly influence the national prosperity.
Thus, if the prices of 1884 had ruled in 1886, the growers of New South
Wales would have got nearly £2,000,000 more than they actually received ;
and, although in 1888 nearly 48,000,000 lb. more wool was exported than
five years previously, the sum received was £509,000 less, so that by the fall
in values the country lost something like £2,082,000. The maximum price
obtained in London during the last twenty years for Sydney-shipped wool
was 26fd per. lb. for scoured in 1875 and the lowest 12d. per lb. in-1886.
Things have improved somewhat of late, but prices have not approached the
maximum mentioned above. There is annually a large exportable surplus
of sheep for meat amounting to about 4,850,000 head, but as yet but little
has been done in the way of opening up a trade with Europe. More activity
is now being shown, however, and there is every project of a large export
of frozen and tinned meat taking place in the near future.
The profitable returns afforded by sheep-breeding induced many pastoralists
to substitute sheep for cattle on their properties, and since 1875 there has
been a decline in the number of cattie depastured. The change that has
taken place in the relative positions of the two classes of stock may be
gathered from the fact that in 1861 the value of cattle was about £7,000,000,
and the value of sheep not half that sum, but in 1891 the value of the last-
named stock had increased to £20,868,000, while the cattle were worth only
about £11,459,000, although the price of the latter had risen while sheep
had depreciated. The course of cattle-breeding is shown by the following
figures, which represent the number of beasts depastured in each of the
years named :
Year. Head of Cattle.
1860 2,408,600
1870.... 2,195,100
1880 2,580,000
1892 2,046,300
Dairy-farming has made great progress recently, more especially in the
South Coast districts. In 1892 there were about 343,500 cows, which
yielded approximately 123,000,000 gallons of milk. By the introduction of
cream-separators, a saving of about a third of the quantity of milk necessary
to make a pound of butter has, in many instances, been effected, and during
the year 18,362,900 lb. of butter, and 5,506,100 lb. of cheese were made
at factories or on farms. There is still a considerable importation of these
articles, so that the industry might be profitably extended.
The abundant pastures which were available caused horse-breeding to
become a promising enterprise in the early days of settlement, and excellent
thoroughbred Arabians were introduced from India. All the good work that
had been done in improving the strain was, however, destroyed at the time


of the gold discoveries, when the pick of the horses of the country were
withdrawn to adjoining provinces. Since 1870 much of the lost ground has
been retrieved, and all classes of horses have improved, but the increase in
numbers is not nearly as rapid as that of population. There are at present
about 459,800 horses, comprising 143,500 draughts, 196,300 saddle, and
120,000 light harness, and of these 65,000 are thoroughbreds. Australian
horses are unsurpassed for hardiness, swiftness, and endurance, an 3 there is
a probability that before long a considerable market will be found for them
in India and China.
Swine-breeding has been much neglected, and, owing to the high returns
yielded by this stock, it is surprising that more progress has not been made.
In 1860 there were 180,700 head in the country, and these had only increased
to 253,200 in 1892. The greater number are kept on the dairy farms to
consume the surplus milk, and about 6,009,600 lb. of bacon and hams were
cured in the 12 months.
The total capital value of stock and pastoral property is estimated to be
£153,991,0 0, consisting of £72,629,000 for land, £44,437,000 for improve-
ments and plant, and £36,925,000 live stock.
There are 53,744 sheep and cattle runs, of which 36,146 were enclosed and
32,474 were also wholly or partially divided into paddocks. The total length
of fencing was 1,689,550 miles valued at £70,623,000 ; and, for the purposes
of watering stock, 31,933 dams have been constructed, worth £2,637,000,
and 31,784 tanks excavated valued at £6,325,700, while 3,744 wells, said to
be worth about £858,000, have been sunk or bored.
The number of persons permanently employed in pastoral pursuits is not
more than 32,400, but in the wool season some 20,000 additional hands find
work in connection with shearing or the transport of the wool. 'Many others
besides those enumerated above are, however, engaged indirectly in this
industry, in such occupations as the preparation of the clip for shipment and
the numerous other matters incidental to the export of pastoral produce.
Such produce amounts to about 60’89 per cent, of the total export trade of
the country, if the value of gold is excluded. The progress made in stocking
the country with sheep and cattle is shown in the following table :

V. AGRICULTURE.
So great a variety of soil and climate is found within New South Wales
that almost any kind of crop can he successfully cultivated. On the hanks
of the northern rivers sugar-cane is extensively grown, and there is every
reason to believe that coffee, tea, and other semi-tropical products would
do equally well. Maize flourishes in the valleys of the coastal region, and
cereals and other crops of cold and temperate climes thrive on the high
plateau of the great dividing range; oranges, lemons, and shaddock, and
most European fruits grow luxuriantly, and in the Hunter valley and


Murray district the vine finds a natural home. Hitherto the superior attrac-
tions of pastoral pursuits have caused agriculture to be somewhat neglected,
and in 1892 there were only 1,179,600 acres cultivated, and as 333,200 acres
were under artificially-sown grasses, land under crop is reduced to 846,400
acres, or less than one acre for each inhabitant, and only 043 per cent, of
the total area of the country. The estimated value of the agricultural pro-
duce for the season 1891-2 was £3,584,490, and regular employment is found
in agricultural pursuits for about 61,300 men and 23,600 women. It would
appear, therefore, that there is an average of 10 acres under tillage to each
person engaged, but many others are indirectly interested. The value of
machinery and implements in use is approximately £1,478,849, or £ll4s. lid.
per acre of land cultivated. _ , , ,
The quantity of wheat grown in New South Wales does not yet nearly
meet the demands of the people for food, and to cover the deficiency of the
locally-grown crops, flour equivalent to 3,193,000 bushels of wheat, as well
as 1.180,000 bushels of unmilled grain have for the last five years been
annually imported. The relative condition of production and consumption
can best be seen from the following table:—

Tli© average amount of flour manufactured annually has increased from
1,788,700 bushels twenty-five years ago to 5,593,400 bushels, the average for
the last few years, representing 70 per cent, of all the flour used. The mean
yield per acre of wheat since 1863 has been 13T0 bushels, the maximum
average 17'37 being reached in 1887, and the minimum 4‘75 bushels two
years later. .
The area devoted to the cultivation of maize has more than trebled
during the last thirty years, and the quantity now grown is not only suf-
ficient to meet the local demand, but affords a considerable margin for
export. The average yield per acre since 1862 has been a little under 32
bushels, but there has been great variation, the produce ranging from 38
bushels in 1870 to under 22 bushels per acre in the following year. The
cultivation of oats has been very irregular, chiefly on account of the uncer-
tainty of sale in the metropolitan markets. The demand for oats depends
largely on the price of maize, the copious supply of which has caused the
area put under oats to remain practically stationary. The yield per acre has
ranged between 11 and 25 bushels, the average for a period of thirty years
being slightly under 20 bushels. # '
The amount of barley sown is at present very small, although there is a
considerable annual import of this grain. It may appear strange that with
the large area adapted for cereai-growing there should each year be a


deficiency between home production and the requirements of the population,
but such is the case. The total consumption of grain of all kinds in New
South Wales, calculated on the basis of the last ten years, amounts to 135
bushels per head of population, or just under 4 bushels in excess of the
local harvests. The yield of wheat is nearly 39 per cent., and of oats and
barley, 72 and 33 per cent, respectively beiow the demands of the home
market, but the surplus production of maize reduces the average deficiency
of the principal grain crops to 35 per cent., and the conditions are, however,
so favorable that it is unlikely that this state of affairs will long continue,
with the advent of population New South Wales should become an exporter
instead of an importer of grain.
There is also room for extension in the cultivation of potatoes, for at
present the quantity produced in the Colony is considerably less than half
the amount required for local consumption. The cultivation of tobacco has
increased very rapidly of late, as may be seen from the following table :

The production for 1890-1 was equal to 1,186,300 lb., a great reduction
on previous crops, and if an allowance of one-third is made for loss from
damage and waste there remains 790,800 lb. to meet the demand for about
1,345,600 lb. But as the Australian leaf, owing principally to faulty curing,
does not compare favorably with the American, the surplus cannot be profit-
ably exported, and the deficiency in the last two crops was more than
supplied by the accumulated stocks from the large crop of 1889 and 1890
still in the hands of growers and merchants. The cultivation of tobacco is
for the most part in the hands of Chinese, few Europeans possessing the
requisite skill and patience for the proper treatment of the leaf.
Sugar cane is extensively grown on the rich land in the low valleys of the
northern rivers. Mills have been erected in the chief centres of cultivation,
and the manufacture of sugar is now actively carried on. Erom plantations
in full bearing from 25 to 32 tons of cane is cut per acre, the annual yield
being worth from £7 10s to £lO. In 1891-2, 8,623 acres were cut, 188,258
tons of cane being obtained. Sugar cane is grown on nearly 900 estates, but
about 20,000 more acres would have to be put under this crop in order to
meet all the demands of the people for sugar.
The growing of vines for wine-making was first commenced in 1828, and
this industry now promises to become one of the most important in the
country. The area suitable for grape-vines is very large, for they thrive
well and bear freely all over the Colony, except in the sub-tropical districts
and the higher parts of the mountain ranges. Prizes were won by New
South Wales wines at the Exhibitions of Paris, Philadelphia, Sydney,
Bordeaux, Melbourne, Amsterdam, and more recently at the Indian and
Colonial in London. During the last thirty years the average annual quantity
of wine made per acre of vines has been 199 gallons, the maximum yield
being 263 gallons in 1876, and the minimum 135 gallons ten years previously.


In 1892, 8,281 acres were under vines, 3,846 acres being devoted to wine
making,’yielding 913,107 gallons of wine. Fruit for market, weighing 3,694
tons, was also cut from 2,148 acres.
Oranges are extensively grown, and cover 11,370 acres. Over 5,000 dozen
fruit have been plucked from an acre of trees in full bearing, and the pro-
duction of oranges has already attained such proportions that there is
annually a large surplus in excess of the requirements of the local markets.
A very large amount of orchard fruits are grown, but there is still room
for extension of this form of cultivation, as nearly £350,000 worth of fruit
is annually imported into New South Wales.
The progress of agriculture, and the increase in area put under the
various kinds of crops can be seen from the following table: —

VI. MINERALS AND MINING.
The mineral wealth of the Colony is enormous, comprising all the principal
metals and other minerals of general utility. Already over £87,000,000 has
been derived from the mines, and employment is afforded to 32,500 persons,
who, with their families, represent a population of 162,000 souls. Gold was
first discovered in payable quantities in 1851, and the thousands of men in
the prime of life who flocked to the country in the hope of finding a fortune
on the gold-fields, beneficially affected every form of industrial progress,
and had a remarkable influence on the subsequent history of New South


Wales. The total quantity and value of the precious metal gained up to the
end of 1891 will best be seen from the following table: —

The largest nugget found was that taken at Burrandong, near Orange, in
1858 ; when melted it gave over 1,182 oz. of pure gold, valued at £4,389. It
is probable that further discoveries of gold will be made, for it is estimated
that the formations in association with which gold is generally met exceed
70,000 square miles in extent. Want of skill and the proper appliances, too,
caused many mines rich in quartz and pyrites to be abandoned in the early
days. Many of them have since been successfully worked, and quartz is
rapidly taking the place of alluvial. Some idea of the great wealth hidden in
many of these gold veins may be gathered from the yield of some of the
mines at a place called Hill End. In January, 1873, TO2 cwt. of gold was
obtained at Beyers and Holtermann’s mine from 10 tons of quartz, and a
slab of vein stuff and gold weighing 630 lbs., and estimated to contain £2,000
worth of metal was also taken from the same mine. The mint returns for
the gold obtained in this mine during 1873 from 415 tons of stuff were
16,27963 oz., value £63,234 12s. Urokman’s Company of the same place
raised in the same year 436 tons 2 cwt. of stone which yielded no less than
24,079 oz. 8 dwt. of gold, worth £93,616 11s. 9d.
About 10,458 Europeans, and 708 Chinese, were engaged in the seach for
gold, 4,748 being on alluvial, and 6418 on quartz workings.
The authority to dig for gold costs only 10s. per year, and entitles its
possessor to take up ground for mining, and to occupy a i acre in a mining
township, or 1 acre outside a town, for a business site.
Up to 1882, very little silver had been obtained in the country, but since
that year there has been an enormous increase in production. The value of
silver and silver-lead ore extracted up to the end of 1891, was £11,302,095,
£3,619,589 of which was won in the year last mentioned.
The fame of the Silverton and Broken Hill mines has become world-wide.
In the Barrier Range District, which lies to the west of the River Darling,
near the border of South Australia, silver deposits extend over an area of
about 2,500 square miles. The deposits worked by the celebrated Broken
Hill Proprietary Company are phenomenally rich. A ' complete smelting
plant on the latest and most approved principles has been erected, and the
services of competent managers, whose experience has been gained in the
silver-mining centres of the United States, secured. Erom the commencement
of operations in 1855, to the 31st May, 1892, the company treated 984,350
tons of silver and silver-lead ores, which yielded 36,512,445 oz. of silver,
and 151,946 tons of lead, valued in London at £8,252,138. Dividends have
been paid amounting to £3,880,000, bonuses amounting to £592,000, and


properties valued at £1,744,000 have been parted with; so that the total
payments made to shareholders have reached £6,216,000. Many mines
which give great promise are not fully developed, and a large increase in
the production of silver, should there he a recovery in price, is not impro-
bable. The 7,645 men mining for silver and silver-lead in 1891 procured
the metal to the value of £486 each.
Tin is another important product of New South Wales. . The total value
of this metal obtained to date is £5,675,663, but a combination of dry seasons
and bad prices has injuriously affected the tin-mining industry in the past.
There are more Chinese than Europeans employed in tin-mining, the numbers
being 1,146 and 805 respectively.
The disturbed state of the copper market, with prices inclining to fall, has
seriously interfered with the development of the country’s wealth in this
metal. In spite of these disadvantages, over £3,481,923 worth of copper had
been obtained up to the end of 1891, and a slight improvement in the market
seems to have given fresh impetus to enterprise in copper-mining. About
481 hands are now engaged.
Although the country is rich in every description of iron ore, but little
progress has been made in the development of these resources. That there
is an enormous field open will be at once apparert when it is remembered
that the average yearly import of iron and iron manufactures by New South
Wales is about £2,030,000, and that of Australasia about £6,316,000, equiva-
lent to 170,000 and 530,000 tons of pig iron respectively.
Many other metals, including antimony, manganese, bismuth, cinnabar, and
platinum are also found. In non-metallic minerals the country is equally
rich. Coal was first found in 1797 by a sailor named Clark, who had been
wrecked upon the coast, and in the same year Lieutenant Shortland discovered
coal deposits near the mouth of the River Hunter. In 1826 the Australian
Agricultural Company obtained a grant of 1,000,000 acres of land and the sole
right of working the coal seams which were known to exist in the Newcastle
district, and several mines were opened up and profitably worked for a number
of years. In 1847 the monopoly expired, and coal-mining has now become one
of the principal industries of the country. Newcastle, the port of shipment,
s provided with over two miles of wharves, furnished with cranes and shoots
capable of loading 16,200 tons per day. Every week vessels leave the harbour
coal-laden, not only for other parts of Australia, but for China, India, the
Pacific Slope of North and South America, Mauritius, The Cape of Good
Hope, and elsewhere. Excellent coal is also obtained from the seams worked
in the Illawarra district and other parts.
Coal is distributed over an area of 23,950 square miles, and is now the
most valuable mineral product of the colony. Already 53,902,781 tons have
been raised, valued at £25,809,041, or a little over 9s. 6d. per ton. The

There were 103 working coal mines in 1891, giving employment to 8,718
men below and 2,102 above ground. Tbe total output was 4,037,929 tons,
or 373 tons for each person employed in or about the mines, and 463 tons
for each miner underground. The price of coal has fluctuated greatly. In
1854, at the time of the Crimean War, and while the gold fever was still
raging, 20s. 6d. per ton was reached, but in 1849 only 6s. was obtained.
The average price at the pit’s mouth for the last 10 years has been 9s. Id.
per ton. The annual consumption of coal per head of population has in-
creased greatly in New South Wales of late years. In 1876 it was 15 cwt.,
and in 1191 30 cwt., the advance being chiefly due to the increased demands
for railway locomotives, steamships, manufacturing, gas, &c.
Kerosene shale is found in considerable quantities, the best qualities
yielding 150 gallons of crude oil, equivalent to 18,000 cubic ft. of gas per
ton, with an illuminating power of about forty-eight sperm candles. The
mines were opened in 1865, and since that year 653,041 tons have been
raised, worth £1,416,982, an average of £2 3s. sd. per ton.
Diamonds and gem stones are to be found in various localities, but the
mines have not yet been worked to any great extent. Marble, limestone,
granite, building stone, fireclays, and all building materials are to be met
with in great abundance.
VII. FORESTS AND FISHERIES.
Very nearly the whole surface of the country is covered by forests, the
only exceptions being the extensive treeless plains clothed with salt bush,
scrub, and grass, which are to be met with in the Monaro, Lachlan, and
Murrumbidgee districts. A great variety of both soft and hard woods is
available, and many of the specimens are of exceptional durability and


beauty. In. the following table a comparison is drawn between specific

varieties of Europe and elsewhere.

Ia spite of the great natural wealth of the forests, the reckless and indis-
criminate destruction of the best species of trees which settlers and timber
getters perpetrated until recently, threatened the future of the supply. The
Government has now taken the matter in hand, and has restricted timber
getters by stringent regulations. Several plantations have also been formed
on forest reserves, and a large number of young trees are annually raised
and distributed throughout the country.
The tidal waters of New South Wales abound with every description of
edible fish, and the numerous bays and estuaries along the coast are pecu-
liarly adapted for breeding grounds.
Oysters are excellent, and were very plentiful, but the beds have been
seriously damaged by the indiscriminate manner in which they have been
stripped. The fishing industry has not yet been properly developed, but
the application of a little capital and intelligence should produce very
remunerative results.
VIII. MANUFACTURES.
The development of manufacturing industries in New South Wales has
been somewhat retarded by the superior attractions offered by mining and


pastoral pursuits for the investment of capital, hut some steady progress
has, nevertheless, been made. The principal classes of work being as

About one-sixth of the whole population is at present dependent on the
manufacturing interest. The number of hands given above will appear
small when compared with the large establishments in Europe and America;
but in New South Wales the sparseness of the population over a large portion
of the country, and the nature of the works themselves, have brought into
existence many small establishments. . Work is, however, gradually being
concentrated in large factories, and this movement w r ill probably continue
as the population increases. A large proportion of the factories in the
country, it will be seen, are for the treatment of raw or semi-raw produce,
the fruits of the agricultural, mining, and pastoral industries, and the prepara-
tion of food and beverages.
IX. COMMERCE.
The imports and exports of New South Wales, if measured by value, have
increased nearly four-fold since 1860, or 20 per cent, more than the popula-
The highest value of gross-trade was reached in 1891 when the total of
imports and exports exceeded that of any previous year by more than
£5,000,000. . , . ,

The amounts given above only partially represent the growth of trade, for,
during the period shown, the prices of both imports and exports have fallen
greatly, so that the volume of trade has been to a corresponding degree
increased. #
The best available method of measuring the fluctuations in value and
volume of the maritime trade is by a comparison of the declared value of the
imports and exports and the tonnage of vessels entering and leaving New-
South Wales ports with cargoes. It is not claimed that in this way an exact
measure of the decline in values can be ascertained, but the figures probably
give a very fair indication of the course of prices and its affect on the com-
merce of the country. It must be borne in mind that during the period under
review the character of vessels employed has changed, steamers have taken
the place of sailing vessels to a great extent, and the passenger traffic has
assumed much larger proportions. Many boats, too, do not fill up at New
South Wales ports, but complete their loading in Melbourne or Adelaide.
On the other hand, it is probable that there is no great variation from year
to year in the proportion of vessels clearing with cargoes from New South


Wales ports and filling up elsewhere, and the other elements of possible
error are all changes which have been effected gradually, while the improve-
ments in ship-building and in package of goods has done much by increasin g
the cargo carrying capacity of vessels to counteract the effect on the com-
putation of the increased accommodation now devoted to passengers. If
the values, as disclosed by the Custom returns for the five years 1860—4,
are made the standard of comparison, the fall in the average price of
imports and exports as shown by the process sketched above has been as
follows :

Thus between 1860 and 1891, according to the official returns, goods
to the value of £407,000,000 were imported, and the exports during the
same period amounted to £326,000,000. If, however, the prices of 1860
had been maintained, the total value of the imports would have been about
£1,017,501,000, and the exports £776,000,000, so that, although the country-
lost £450,000,000 from the fall in the price of exports, it grained £610,000,000
on its importations from a like cause, or a net gain of £160,000,000.
There is, however, another aspect in the fall in prices, which is by no means
as pleasant as the one just taken. For money borrowed when values were
higher, New South Wales is now compelled to pay so much more produce as
interest. For instance, for every £lOO lent at 5 per cent in or previous to
1860, it is necessary now annually to send to England about twice as much
exports as in the year named. In this wav, as prices fall, the interest
burthen of loans contracted when prices were higher increases.
The small decline noticeable between the fourth and fifth period in the
above table is due to the rapid rise in wool in 1880, when there was an
advance of 3d. per lb. on the prices ruling in the preceding year. The
increase in the proportion which wool forms of the total exports has been
so gradual and regular that even the great preponderance of this article does
not vitiate, the calculations founded upon tonnage and aggregate value, and
these remarks apply equally to the export of coal. If the movement in the
wool market which is noted above is borne in mind, a striking confirmation
of the substantial accuracy of the price-level is to be found in a comparison
of the fluctuations in value of eleven of the principal articles of export, details
concerning which are published in comparable form in the official returns.
If the prices of these articles in 1860 are made the standard of comparison
and the values then ruling are taken at 100, a decline of 31 per cent, is seen
in the figures for 1870, a slight recovery to 28 per cent, in 1880, and then a
B


further decline in IS9I to 46 per cent, below the prices of 1860. The prin-
cipal exports which have been most affected by the fall in prices can be seen
from the following table, in which the fluctuations in value are traced: —

The distribution of trade has not varied much from year to year, and Great
Britain supplies about half of the imports, and nearly 52 per cent, of New
South Wales exports go to the same country.

Of late years the trade with Germany, Belgium, and the United States
shows a marked advance, the principal reason, doubtless, being the improved
communication which is now afforded by the direct lines of steamers. This
is equally true of the export trade, and each year more and more produce
is its way direct to European and American markets without,


as formerly, first passing through and paying toll to England. The dis-
tribution of the export trade is as follows:

The variations in the proportion of trade with Great Britain are more
apparent than real, the cause in most cases being the navigable state or the
reverse of the Biver Murray. If the river is in flood a large portion of the
Biverina trade finds a nearer and cheaper port of shipment at Melbourne or
Adelaide than Sydney, and the goods thus passing through Victoria and
South Australia are credited to those colonies, although their actual destina-
tion is Great Britain. The value of the combined import and export trade
of each of the principal countries has been :

The imports of New South Wales include a large variety of articles. In
1891 food and drink to the value of £4,650,143, and manufactured goods
worth £10,979,696, at the rate of £4 Is. 4d. and £9 15s. 6d., respectively,


per inhabitant, were imported. The exports consist principally of raw or
semi-raw produce, such as wool, coal, tin, silver, copper, coin, skins, tallow,
and live stock. The nature of the trade can be easily determined from the
following classification :

Wool forms by far the largest item in the export trade, and any variation

country throughout. The growth of the wool trade since 1860 has been as

The large amount of coal exported lowers tlie average value per ton of
exports, being an article of great bulk and small value. In 1891, 2,514,368
tons weight of coal was shipped, equivalent to 1,706,700 tons measurement,
out of 2,872,338, the tonnage of the total exports. The. value per ton of
cargoes imported in 1891 was £9 12s. sd. as compared with £6 4s. 2d. for
exports, so that the latter, from the cause above described, were worth 37


per cent, less per ton than the imports. The average value per ton, including
tonnage of vessels with cargoes and in ballast was £7 9s. 3d. for imports,
and £6 Os. 6d. for exports, but it varies greatly with different countries to
which or from which the goods are exported or imported, as will be seen

In 1891 the total importations of all classes of merchandise amounted to
£22 3s. 1 Id. per inhabitant, and of this £l7 19s. 3d. was retained for home
consumption. In the year named the imports and exports nearly balanced,
for the latter amounted to £22 13s. 6d. per head. Thus the total trade was
equal to £44 17s. Bd. for each man, woman, and child in New South Wales.
The increase of commerce has been very much more rapid than the increase
of population, as will be seen from the figures given below: —

X. SHIPPING.
The records of the shipping trade of New South Wales are very meagre
prior to the year 1825, when eighty-five vessels were entered inwards of an
aggregate tonnage of 24,559, and seventy-five vessels outwards with a total
tonnage of 22,688. Twenty-five years later 976 vessels arrived, amounting
to 234,215 tons, and 1,014 vessels left the ports with a tonnage of 263,840
tons.


Since 1860 the growth shown by the records of shipping has been very
rapid and regular, and the aggregate tonnage of vessels entered and cleared
in 1891 amounted to over six times that of I 860:

The shipping trading to and from the country is almost entirely under the
British flag, and in 1891 no less than 86 per cent, of the entire tonnage
belonged to either Great Britain or British possessions. Determined efforts
have, however, of late been made by shipowners of other nationalities to
secure a share of the New South Wales trade, and well-found steamers, both
passenger and cargo, run regularly for French and German companies.
Of the total tonnage set down as British the larger portion is owned in
the colonies. In 1876 out of 1,969,457 tons of shipping entered and cleared
under the British flag 1,293,813 tons, or 66 per cent., were Australasian ; in
1881 out of 2,563,999 tons entered and cleared 1,543,431 tons, or 60 per
cent., represented colonial shipping; while in 1891 the colonial shipping
amounted to 3,029,067 tons out of a total of 4,902,607 tons, or 62 per cent.
Owing to the largeness of the export trade most vessels coming to our
ports are enabled to obtain return freights, and many ships also come to fall
up with coal or wool after discharging their inward cargoes m the other
colonies of Australia. The tonnage outwards with cargoes has been as
follows, in the years named :

In 1891 no less than 632,617 tons of shipping were entered at New South
Wales ports in ballast, but only 82,956 tons left the colony without cargoes.
Unfortunately, previous to 1876 no distinction was made between steam
and sailing vessels in the records. In the year named the tonnage or
steamers amounted to 43 per cent, of the total, a proportion which had
increased 75 per cent, in 1891. It has been computed from the port entries
of the world that steamers make fifteen trips and sailing vessels only three
in the year, and although for vessels engaged on long passages these figures
are too hifah, the relative proportions of voyages to Australia are about the
same, and the change which has taken place in the character of shipping has
been productive of great economy both of time and labour. , Another change
which has effected considerable saving has been the increase in the average
size of vessels trading to New South Wales; the larger the vessels the fewer


hands required per ton to work her. The average size and the number of
tons to each seaman are given below:—

Thus, without allowing for the more frequent trips of steamers, three
seamen now carry more than five did in 1860.
There are three graving docks, four floating docks, and five patent slips at
Sydney, At Newcastle there are slips, and on the Clarence Eiver a floating
dock, besides which there are other docking and building yards in different
parts of the colony for the convenience of Coasting vessels.
The new graving dock, built by the Government, is the largest single
dock in the world, and capable of receiving vessels drawing 32 ft. of water.
In Sydney Harbour the water is deep enough to allow the largest vessels
to be berthed alongside the wharves and quays, and powerful shipping
appliances and roomy stores are found at all the principal wharves. Eound
Sydney Cove magnificent echelon wharves have been constructed, and on the
south and west sides of Darling Harbour two jetties, capable of accom-
modating the largest ships, have been made, communicating directly with the
railway, which has been carried to the water’s edge. The total wharf
frontage amounts to about six miles.
At Newcastle vessels of 4,000 tons can be safely berthed. The Govern-
ment owns nearly all the wharfage, which extends over a length of about
10,500 ft. There are two slips, owned by private individuals, capable of
taking up vessels of 300 and 1,200 tons respectively.
Staiths, cranes, and other coal shipping appliances have been erected at
Wollongong, Bulli, Coal Cliff, and other ports. Wharves are found at all
the principa] places along the rivers of the Colony, and all ports with a trade
of any importance have their jetties and facilities for shipping.
XI. INTERNAL COMMUNICATION.
In 1846 a meeting was held in Sydney to promote the construction of a
line to connect the metropolis by rail with the city of Goulburn, and two
years later a company was formed, with a capital of £lOO,OOO, having for its
object the construction of lines to Parramatta and Liverpool, with a possible
extension, in course of time, to Bathurst and Goulburn.
In 1850 the first sod of the first railway in the Australian colonies was
turned, but the company did not prosper, and its property was taken over
by the Government. Another company, started in 1853, with the object of
constructing a railway from Newcastle to Maitland, fared no better, and the
Government took over that line also. The works were carried on with
vigour, and in September, 1855, the line from Sydney to Parramatta was
declared open for public traffic, and fourteen years later the extension t®
Goulburn was completed.


During the twenty years which followed the opening of the first line, the
progress of railway construction was very slow, and in 1875 the length of
the lines in operation had only reached 437 miles, or at the rate of about 22
miles per annum. In the last twelve years the rate of increase has greatly
improved ; and, from the end of 1876 to the middle of the year 1892, 1,6551-
miles of railway were opened for traffic, or a yearly average of 107 miles.
Bailway s have been one of the most important factors in the development
of our resources since 1855, and at present represent nearly 22 per cent, of
the wealth of the Colony. The growth of this form of industry has been as
follows: —

The saving effected by railways has been very great. Twenty-five years
ago—before the lines extended far into the interior, and when carriage was
mostly by road —the average cost of moving one ton of goods 1 mile was
about 7i'd.; ten years later the railways had reduced the rate to 3d., and
now the average cost barely exceeds lid.
The progress made in the extension of railway facilities can be seen by
comparing the number of inhabitants to each mile of line open, and the
number of train miles run per head of population :

So that, judged by the length of line, the railway accommodation is ten
times greater, in comparison to population, than thirty years ago. The
increased facilities for travelling have increased the desire to travel, and in
1892 each inhabitant of the Colony made 17T journeys, as compared with
4*7 fifteen years previously. The extension of the suburban lines round the
metropolis has, on account of the large number of persons who live now in
the suburbs, and come to town every day to their work, tended to reduce
the average length of each journey, which was 13‘4 miles in 1879, and in
1892 had fallen to 5‘46 miles; and, as a consequence, the average fare paid
by each passenger has declined from Is. 3|d. to Bd. But fares have been so
reduced that a passenger can now go about thirteen miles for the same
amount as he had in 1879 to pay to go one. The enormous increase which


has taken place in the passenger traffic under these conditions has been as
follows :

Each member of the community spent Bs. more on railway travelling in
1892 than fifteen years previously, the actual receipts for passenger traffic
per head of population having been £L Os. sd. in the first-named year, as
compared with a little over Bs. sd. at the commencement of the period. The
development of the goods traffic has been no less rapid than that of passenger
traffic. The weight of merchandise carried has been as follows :

The above figures, however, do not show the full extent of the increased
business, for the average distance each ton of goods was hauled has of late
years increased very considerably. In 1877 the average distance was about
34 miles, while in 1886, the last year for which particulars are available, it
had reached nearly 54 miles. The average amount of money spent by each
member of the community for the carriage of goods on the railways was,
fifteen years ago, about 17s. 4d., as compared with £1 12s. lid. in 1892,
although in the interval freights had been reduced. The total cost of the
2,185 miles constructed to the 30th June, 1892, was £28,348,900, and the
amount expended on rolling-stock, machinery, workshops and furniture, was
£4,963,708, so that the total cost of all lines reached £33,312,608, an average
of £15,246 per mile.
The railway system of the country is divided into three main arms, each
being really a distinct system. The Southern line, which is the most important
of the three, branches at Junee, running from Sydney 454 miles to Hay, the
capital of the fertile district of the liiverina in one direction, and 412 miles
to Jerilderie in another. There are also several minor branches which drain
into the main line, while a line connecting the Southern and Western systems
from Murrumburrah to Blayney gives almost direct communication between
Melbourne and Bourke. Gfoulburn, a large town nearer to Sydney, will also
be the recipient of several feeding branches. The Southern line places the
four chief capitals of Australia—Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide—in


direct communication, and the mails from Europe can now be landed at
Adelaide and forwarded overland to all parts of Victoria and New South
Wales.
The Western system crosses the Blue Mountains by zig-zag lines, which
are triumphs of engineering skill, and enters the Bathurst Plains, connecting
the metropolis with the rich agricultural districts of Bathurst, Orange, and
Wilcannia; and from Nyngan, 377 miles from Sydney, another branch to
Cobar, the centre of a rich mining and pastoral country. There are also
short lines between Mudgee and Wallerawang, Orange and Molong, and
from Blacktown, via Windsor and Richmond, to the Hawkesbury River.
The northern system originally terminated at Newcastle, but the connec-
tion is now complete with Sydney, an iron bridge 2,896 ft. long spanning the
Hawkesbury River. This line runs through Newcastle and the Hunter
Valley to the rich district of New England, and it then traverses pastoral
and agricultural country via the towns of Tamworth, Glen Jnnes, Armidale,
and Tenterfield, until it joins the Queensland system. Various branches are
projected, and besides the three systems mentioned above there is an
independent line to the Illawarra district, a country rich in coal and
agricultural produce. Schemes for the more complete connection of the
suburbs with the city of Sydney by means of a system of suburban railways
have for some time been under discussion, as also has the extension of the
railway from its present terminus to the waters of Circular Quay.
For the first twenty-three years in the history of New South Wales there
were no postal facilities whatever. The first post office was established in
1810, but the arrangements were of a most primitive character, and no real
organisation was affected until 1825, when tenders were called for the
conveyance of mails between the principal centres of population. The
charges for transmission and delivery were extremely high, and varied
according to the distance carried and the difficulty of access to the recipient.
In 1819 the postage rates were reduced, and postage stamps like those at
present in use were substituted for stamped covers which had existed since
1837. The operations of the post office have continued to increase, and the
improved facilities afforded have had an important effect on the develop-
ment of the resources and commerce of the country. The growth of business
has been as follows :

During 1891 about 8,235,000 miles wete travelled by mail conveyance, the
postal lines having an aggregate length of 31,257 miles, 16,370 being by coach,
2,255 by railway, 11,802 by horseback, 18 by tramway, and 812 by steamer.
The Postal Department delivered 56 letters and 37 newspapers for each
person in the Colony. It is worthy of note that in the last twenty-eight
years the time of transit of the mails between New South Wales and Great
Britain has been reduced by half.
In 1852 there was a contract for a monthly steam mail service between
Sydney and England, the time of passage permitted being fifty-eight days.


But the steamers were very irregular, and scarcely ever up to time. In 1866
a new route was opened via Panama, but after two years the company hold-
ing the contract failed. In 1869 a mail service was inaugurated via San
Francisco, and more recently the Suez service has been increased by the
add tion of theMessageries Maritimes and the North German Lloyds steamers
to those of the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient companies as letter
carriers. The time occupied in the conveyance of mails averages from thirty-
four to thirty-five days, and the steamships of the various lines arrive with
great punctuality.
The telegraphic business shows an increase proportionate to that of the
Post Office. The length of wire in operation, and number of messages sent,

telegraph was opened in 1858, and was 22 miles in length. Now there are
674 stations, and 11,697 miles of line in operation.

The wealth of the people of New South Wales has increased marvellously.
If the value of public works and unsold lands of the State is omitted the
progress has been as follows :

407,400,000
338,400,000
If to this is added the value of the public and municipal estate, £179,300,000,
the total public and private wealth of the Colony is £586,700,000, or £523
per head of population.
The items constituting the public wealth are shown thus:—
Kailways, tramways, telegraphs, and waterworks, sewerage, and £
other revenue-yielding works 44,958,000
Public works and buildings not yielding revenue 20,318,000
Unsold Grown lands . 107,624,000
Eoads, buildings, and other works in municipalities 6,400,000
£179,300,000


The Government railways are valued at £39,975,000, for already the sum
of £33,057,500 has been expended on construction, and in addition there is
a large amount of State lands which have been used for railway purposes,
and not specially paid for.
The public telegraphs are worth about £743,700, and the works in con-
nection with water supply and sewerage are estimated at about £4,240,000.
The present value of the public roads and bridges of the Colony, outside
municipalities, is said to be £10,382,000, and of works for the improvement
of the navigation of harbours, wharves, dredging plant, &c., about £9,930,000,
making a total value of all public property constructed out of general revenue
or loans of, approximately, £65,271,000. From the foregoing table it will
be seen that the public estate is by far the most important item in the esti-
mate of the public wealth. The area of land which still remained in the
possession of the State, being 151,124,000 acres, of which 148,122,200 acres
were leased at a rental of £814,850 per annum. The remaining 3,001,800
acres contain some of the best land in the Colony. If an all round value of
12s. 9d. per acre, a by no means extravagant estimate, is taken, the unsold
State lands are worth about £94,400,000, and in addition to this £13,224,000
is still owing to the State by purchasers of laud under a system of deferred
payments. The next item given in the estimate of public wealth is muni-
cipal, which includes roads and municipal works and buildings. The assets
of the City of Sydney alone amount to £2,671,400, the principal items con-
tained being made roads, £830,000 ; markets and lands, £630,000; town
hall, £350,000; and wharves, £410,000. The value of made roads and
streets in other municipalities is over £1,680,000. The value oi private
property in the Colony is estimated as under: —
£
Land 173,352,000
Houses and permanent improvements 129,800,000
Live stock 35,187,000
Personal property and household furniture 14,637,000
Machinery and implements of trade 9,723,000
Coin and bullion 9,726,000
Merchandise 14,730,000
Shipping owned in the Colony 1,910,000
Mines, including plant 18,340,000
Total private wealth £407,405,000
There are in private hands, outside Municipalities, 43,276,500 acres of
land, valued at £105,204,600, on which about 103,000 houses, worth
£11,830,000, have been built. The mineral lands are valued at £18,340,000,
and the permanent improvements on both purchased lands and lands rented
from the State are worth £72,982,100.
The live stock, valued in the estimate, includes 50,107,000 sheep, 1,741,600
horned cattle, 430,800 horses, and 238,600 swine.
Personal property (such as clothing, jewellery, pictures, carriages, &c.)
represents, as a rule, about 50 per cent, of the value of the house, but in
the above estimate it is taken at only 16 per cent, of the value of house
property.
With regard to merchandise the value of goods and stocks of all kinds in
stores and shops, or at the place of production, is assumed as equal to six
months’ imports and exports combined, and has been taken above at half the
total trade of the Colony for the year.


In the case of shipping the average value per ton is approximately £25 for
steamers and £l2 10s. for sailing vessels.
The amount of property passing through the Probate Court each year
affords an indirect method of guaging the wealth of a country, although the
extraordinary variations produced by the deaths of one or two exceptionally
wealthy persons make the figures unreliable and useless except as a side
light on a more detailed valuation. The number of deaths registered in the
Colony during the last five years has been 71,489, and the value of property
claimed £26,369,571, or £234 per head. Property for Probate purposes is
generally undervalued ; and, if 10 per cent, is allowed for this undervaluation,
and the increment for the last few years is added, the amount of private
wealth arrived at by this means will agree very closely with the estimate
above given. If the five years (1868-72) during which probate duties were
imposed, are compared with the five years ending 1890, the result is as
follows:

This shows an increase of £108,600,000 in the wealth of the people in
the twenty-two years, or an annual ratio of increase of 10'89 per cent, as
compared with 4TO per cent., the annual advance of population.
An examination of the probate returns indicates that the property of the
country has accumulated in the hands of about 41 per cent, of the adult
male population. That is to say that of every 100 men in New South Wales
41 possess property to the value of at least £lOO, which is a much wider dis-
tribution of wealth than is to be met with in most older countries.

The increase which has taken place during recent years is to a large
extent due to the very rapid progress of the railways of the country, which,
although they bring an increased revenue, necessitate a much larger outlay
for working expenses and maintenance. In 1880 there were only 850 miles
of railway line in operation, while in 1891 the length had grown to 2,182
miles. The amount spent on education by the State has also increased
greatly since 1880, when State aid to denominational education was
abolished, and, although not as large now as five years ago, the annual charge
on the general revenue for public instruction is very much higher than
previous to the passing of the Act referred to. The expenditure in 1880
and 1891 may be classified as follows :

The large proportion of the public expenditure required to pay interest
on the public debt is not really as serious as it at first sight appears, for, as
will be presently shown, a considerable part of the debt charges are recouped
out of the earnings of works constructed with borrowed money. At one
time the expenditure on immigration was an important item in the country’s
finances, and in 1884 over £120,000 was spent by the State in helping
settlers to New South Wales shores ; but the Government have now ceased
to assist immigrants, and the amount appearing above is only to complete
contracts. The increase in the expenditure for postal and telegraphic
services has no significance beyond showing the progress made in these
branches, for every increase in outgo is counterbalanced by an equivalent
increase in income. During the years immediately following 1878 there was
annually a substantial surplus of revenue over expenditure —the total
amount so received being £6,400,400. The public revenue has changed
considerably in character since 1860, as will be seen from the table below :

Thus, the revenue derived from taxation, which was over half of the total
receipts in 1860, is now not one-third. The most remarkable feature in
the table is, however, the enormous increase in the revenue for services
rendered, which now forms 46 per cent, of the total public income as com-
pared with 115 per cent, at the commencement of the period. The total
revenue from all sources, with the exception of loans, has been as follows:

Considering the largeness of the public expenditure, the people of New
South Wales are very lightly taxed, for the whole amount collected is under
5 per cent, of the estimated annual income of the inhabitants.
There are four main divisions of taxation, the receipts from each of which
in 1891 were as follows :
£ Per cent.
Customs 2,168,265 74’3
Excise 288,198 99
Stamps 326,778 112
Licenses 133,103 4’6
In 1861 Custom Duties averaged 73 per cent, on the value of all imported
merchandise ; but in 1891 the collections amounted to B's per cent, of the
total importations.

During the last year given £869,631 was collected on spirits of different
kinds, and £120,326 on tea. The duty on beer yielded £81,003, and on
tobacco £277,707.
The income derived from lease or gale of the Crown Lands forms a large
proportion of the total revenue; but the sum obtained has varied greatly,
ranging from 19s 7d. per inhabitant, in 1871, up to £5 2s. lid. six years
later. The land revenue for 1891 may be classed as follows :
£
Sales ... ... ... ... ... ... 1,163,338
Interest on conditional sales... ... ... ... 107,174
Pastoral occupation ... ... ... ... 828,785
Mining occupation ... ... ... ... ... 53,451
Miscellaneous receipts ... ... ... ... 113,888
Total ... ... ... ... £2,266,636
The revenue received for services rendered exceeds that derived from
either taxation or land. In New South Wales the services controlled by
the State are exceptionally important, and the income from this source has
increased rapidly and steadily for many years. Taking the same periods as
have been adopted in the other tables the growth has been as follows :

So far, the revenue and expenditure of the Central Government has been
exclusively dealt with, but there is also a large amount of money collected
and distributed each year by municipal institutions. Several unsuccessful
attempts were made to introduce local government into New South Wales
previous to the passing of the Act in 1842, which established the Municipal
Council of the City of Sydney. The first council was not altogether


satisfactory, and after a few years’ trial, it was superseded by three Com-
missioners. Three years after the appointment of the Commissioners a
new city council was created, and since 1858 the government of Sydney
has remained in the hands of aldermen elected by the ratepayers.
In 1858 the benefits of local administration of local affairs were also
extended to the more densely populated parts of the country, and in 1867 it
was enacted that any district the inhabitants of which might so desire was at
liberty to become incorporated for the purposes of local government. At the
present time there are in New South Wales 163 districts which have availed
themselves of this privilege. Contained within their limits is rateable
property of the capital value of £144,284,800, upon which rates to the
amount of £436,740 are levied.
The increase in value of property within municipalities has been as

To meet this expenditure £417,351 was raised by general rates; £89,865
by special rates for such services as lighting, water supply, and sewerage;
£168,306 as grants from the revenues of the Central Government; and
£12,394 from contributions by inhabitants towards the cost of special services;
and £180,500 from other sources. The balance between income and disburse-
ments was made up from money borrowed for improvement works. In
addition to the ordinary municipalities there is the Metropolitan Water and
Sewerage Board, and if its revenue is added it will give £1,115,550, as the
total amount of taxation for municipal purposes, equivalent to £1 12s. sd.
per head of population residing within the boundaries of incorporated districts.
Turning from the revenue collected for public purposes it may be well to
consider the private income of the people who have to provide the money,
c


The income of persons living or holding property in New South Wales is
estimated at about £62,950,000 per annum, equal to £57 per head, derived
from the following sources :
£
Pastoral Pursuits 13,400,000
Dairy Farming 1,400,000
Agriculture and Forestry 5,650,000
Mining 4,450,000
Manufactures 5,700,000
Professions 2,706,000
Trade and Commerce 8,000,000
Domestic Services 4,680,000
Construction 5,870,000
Transport... 1,800,000
Public Service 1,620,000
Rents of Dwellings, &c 6,120,000
Miscellaneous 1,560,000
It will be seen that the amount obtained from productive pursuits is
equivalent to about 48’6 per cent, of the whole. As has been shown the
revenue of New South Wales is very large as compared with its population,
but it was not to be expected that all the requirements of a young and rapidly
increasing community could be met from ordinary income.
In order to make progress possible, the hitherto untouched continent had
to be opened up. Railways and other public works of an expensive character
had to be constructed, and to do this money had necessarily to be obtained
on the security of the general revenues of the country. The first loan of
£49,500 was issued to provide funds with which to encourage and assist
immigration in 1840, when labour was urgently required ; and during the
following years several other loans were raised for similar purposes, but
they were all paid off within a few years out of ordinary income. In 1851,
however, the loan policy really commenced, and at intervals since that year
money has been raised in this way to the extent of £58,591,303. The public
indebtedness of the country has increased of late years very rapidly, as will
be seen from the following table :

A casual glance at the above figures might seem to justify the suggestion
that New South Wales has too deeply mortgaged her resources, and that the
annual interest, charge, and expense of her indebtedness is an inconveniently
heavy burthen. But the indebtedness of New South Wales cannot he viewed
in the same light as the borrowings of most other countries. In the first
place, almost all the borrowed money has been spent on works of public
utility, and of a reproductive nature ; and, secondly, there is no war debt,
and the rapidity of the progress that has been made in every phase of
material development is unique. The total expenditure from loans at the


close of 1891 was £49,162,507, which is distributed among the following
classes of services :
£
Railways and Tramways 35,582,392
Electric Telegraphs 775,464
Harbours and Rivers Navigation 3,010,888
Roads and Bridges , 701,282
Immigration 569,930
Sewerage 1,701,411
Water Supply . 3,867,788
Fortifications and Military Worts 1,018,679
Other Public Works . 1,934,673
It will be seen that under six of the above heads £43,627,789, or 88 - 7 per
cent, of the entire public debt, has been spent upon works which are at the
present time of a directly reproductive character, while from many of the
other items in the classification a return is indirectly received, although the
exact monetary value of the benefit derived from such works as roads and
bridges, and harbours and rivers navigation, cannot be computed.
The share of the annual interest payable on the debt incurred for the
construction and equipment of railways and tramways amounts approxi-
mately to £1,356,045; the net earnings during 1891-2 from these services
were £1,249,543, leaving a deficiency of £106,501 to be made up by taxation.
Water supply and sewerage works returned a net revenue of £183,467, as
a set-off against an approximate charge for interest on the capital cost of
£208,242, thus leaving a small deficit. It will thus be seen that in New
South Wales, during 1891, the sum of £1,433,010 was available from works
of a reproductive nature, constructed out of loans, which when deducted
from the total interest payable reduces the charge on the general revenues
of the country to £440,573, equal to a capital debt at the rate paid of
£11,560,561.
XV. BANKING.
The banking power of New South Wales —that is to say, the aggregate of
capital and deposits—is now more than five times as great as it was in

It must, however, be borne in mind that some of the money included
above is not used exclusively in the country. The extent of the growth of
the operations of banking institutions may be gathered from the following

The advances made by the various banks of issue to their customers
amounted in 1860 to under £6,000,000, or about £l7 12s. 3d. per inhabitant;
in 1892 over £42,600,000 was so lent, equivalent to £36 11s. 2d. per head.
During the same period the money received on deposit has increased more
than sevenfold, the interest allowed to depositors having only been reduced
one-half per cent, on the rates of 1860: —

The condition of the people is also strikingly illustrated by a classification
of deposits, the number of small sums standing to credit of current account
showing the wide distribution of wealth amongst the great mass of the
inhabitants. In 1892 the deposits for fixed terms and at current account
were as follows :

The extension of banking facilities has caused the amount of coin held in
private hands for ordinary purposes of trade to decline about 25 per cent.,
but it is probable that the minimum amount which is sufficient to meet
present requirements has been reached. The total coin in circulation
amounted altogether to nearly £8,874,000 in 1892 as compared with
£3,000,000 in 1860.


XV. POPULATION.
There is perhaps no more practical test of the prosperity and general
welfare of a country than the voluntary influx of population. The very rapid
increase in the number of inhabitants of New South Wales is a striking
indication of the strength of the inducements which the country offers to
settlers. The population at various dates has been :

When reading the above table it is necessary to bear in mind the fact that
in the period covered, New South Wales has given birth to two Colonies,
Victoria and Queensland, which now contain about 1,150,000 and 400,000
inhabitants respectively.
The district of Port Phillip, or Victoria, was separated in July, 1851, but
in the figures given for that year the inhabitants have not been included in
the population of New South Wales, and this severance of one of the fairest
portions of the country accounts for the apparent decline. Queensland was
erected into a separate colony in December, 1859.
Three causes have combined to bring about the rapid increase in the
number of inhabitants—the excess of births over deaths, the large influx of
unassisted immigrants, and immigrants brought to the Colony partially at
the public expense.
The mean annual birth rate over a series of years is 367 per thousand of
the population, a figure which cannot be regarded as very high if comparison
is made either with the other Australasian Colonies or older countries. On
the other hand, the death rate is a low one, being only 14‘6 per thousand
inhabitants for the same period as has been taken for the births. The total
increase from the excess of births over deaths since 1860 has been 485,072,
while for the last 20 years the net annual increase to the population from
the same cause has been about 2 - 28 per cent.
Since 1860 the number of persons arriving in New South Wales has
in every year exceeded the number of those departing. The greatest
apparent excess of arrivals during any one year was 39,683 in 1855. The
total number of persons arriving in the country since 1860, has been


1,252,475, but 912,522 have left these shores, so that the net gam to popu-
lation from immigration has been 339,958. Included in the figures above given
are those immigrants who were State assisted, and of whom 211,456 have
been brought since the commencement of the system in 1832. Of these
76,749 were adult males ; 81,721 adult females; and 27,150 male and 25,836
female children. Only 2,502 of them were foreigners, the vast majority
being English or Irish.
The proportionate increase to the population from the excess of births
over deaths, and immigrants over emigrants, has been as follows: —

No more eloquent tribute could he paid to the resources and attractions
of New South Walas than the increasing desire shown by immigrants to
make this country their future home. One of the most marked character-
istics of the progress of the last thirty years has been the much more rapid
increase of urban as compared with rural population. In Bn gland, France,
the United States of America, and other countries, totally dissimilar in
natural conditions, the same disproportionate growth of towns and cities is
to he found.
The growth of eight principal towns has been as follows :

The town of Broken Hill did not exist in 1881, and is a good example
of the mining townships which suddenly rise on the discovery of any
rich field.


The growth of Sydney (the metropolis) has been very remarkable. Fifty
years ago there were only 34,825 inhabitants, but at the enumeration in
1891 there were very nearly 400,000. The increase has been as follows :

The increase of the metropolitan population has been nearly half as fast
again as that of the country generally, and Sydney now contains one-third
of the total number of inhabitants of New South Wales.

over the country during the last decade can best be seen from the following

The relative proportion of the native-born to the total population is
increasing rapidly ; and, at the census in 1891, they numbered 725,015, out
of a total of 1,132,234. At the four last enumerations the proportion of
each element has been as follows: —

It will thus be seen that in 1891 no less than 9579 per cent, of the whole
population were British subjects by birth. At the census of 1861 there
were 12,988 Chinese in New South Wales, most of whom had been attracted
by the discovery of gold. Ten years later the number had fallen to 7,220,
and in 1881 an increase to 10,2<>5 was found. At the census of 1891 there
were 13,289 full-blooded Chinese, of whom 156 were females, and 422 male
and 445 female half-casts. The restrictions placed by the Legislature on
the immigration of Chinese have, however, stopped the influx. lor some
time the number leaving has very greatly exceeded the number arriving,
and there is a prospect of the race being entirety excluded at no very
distant date.
An examination of the census returns shows that the average age of males
is 24'7 years, while the average for females is about two years less. The
mean age of the whole population is 23 7 years. If under 15 years is taken
as the dependent age for both males and females there were 217,991 of the
former and 213,198 of the latter. The number of men at the supporting
age—i.e. between 15 and 65—was 373,346, and at military age, between 20
and 46 years, 209,582. The number of women at a reproductive age was
239,503. All these figures are exclusive of the aboriginal inhabitants, of
whom there were 5,097 full-blooded and 3,188 half-castes. The total
estimated population of New South Wales at the end of June, 1892, was
1,182,5u0.
XVI. EDUCATION.
Previous to 1848 the system of primary education in force was purely
denominational. The Government granted assistance to the heads of
religious bodies in proportion to the amount expended by them upon
instruction, but no provision was made for the establishment of schools
entirely under State control. Attempts were made to. modify the system
in force as early as 1834, and five years later a grant was made with the
object of securing undenominational education for the children of those who
preferred it, but no definite steps were taken in this direction until 1844,


when a committee of the Legislative Council reported in favour of the
adoption of the Irish National School system ; and, in accordance with this
recommendation, an Act was passed constituting two Boards, to one of
which was entrusted the administration of denominational education, and
to the other the undenominational or, as it was called, the National system.
This arrangement existed for eighteen years, until it was abolished by the
passing of the Public Schools Act of 1866. This Act provided for two
distinct classes of schools, though all schools receiving aid from the State
were nominally under a Board appointed by the Government, and styled
the Council of Education. The Public Schools were entirely under the
control of this Board, but the denominational schools were partly governed
by the various religious bodies by whom they had been founded. Good work
was done under this system, although, in many respects, it was defective;
but the principle of granting State aid to religious schools became more and
more unpopular, and in 1880 State aid to denominational education was
finally abolished.
By the new Act the entire educational system of the Colony was re-
modelled ; the Council of Education was dissolved, and a Minister of Public
Instruction created in its place. Public schools, to afford primary instruction
to all children without sectarian or class distinction, were established, as
well as Superior Public Schools, in which additional lessons in higher
branches may be given. Evening Public Schools were formed with°the
object of instructing persons who may not have received the advantages of
primary education, and who could not attend the day schools ; and°High
Schools for boys and girls, in which the course of instruction is of such a
character as to complete the Public School curriculum, or to prepare students
for the University. In all State Schools the teaching is strictly non-sectarian,
but. secular instruction is held to include general religious teaching, as
distinguished from dogmatical or polemical theology. The History' of
England and of Australia are to form part of the course of secular
instruction ; and it is further provided that four hours during each school-
day shall be devoted to secular instruction exclusively, but one hour each
day may be set apart for religious instruction, to be given in a separate
class-room by the clergyman or religious teacher of any persuasion, to those
children of the same denomination whose parents may not offer any
objection.
Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6
and 14 years for at least 70 days in each half-year, unless just cause of
exemption can be shown, and parents are required to pay a weekly fee
of 3d. per child, but not exceeding Is.- in all for the children of one
family. The fees, however, may be remitted where it is shown that the
parents are unable to pay. Children attending school are allowed to travel
free by rail.
The establishment of Provisional Schools, and the appointment of itinerant
teachers in remote and thinly-populated districts, is also provided for, as
well as the establishment of training schools for teachers. Parents are not
compelled to send their children to the public schools, but have free choice
in the matter, the State only insisting that instruction shall be given. Great
as has been the material progress of the Colony, its intellectual advancement
has been even more rapid, and in the records of the marriage registers signed
by marks, a most accurate gauge of educational progress is to be found.
The earliest official record of marriages was for the year 1857, when out of
5,804 persons married, 1,646 or 28'36 per cent, were Unable to sign the


marriage register. During 1891 the number of such persons was only 507,
or 3 per cent, of the total number married.

The progress exhibited in the above table is marvellous, and it must be
remembered that of the 507 persons using marks a large proportion were
not born in New South Wales, but arrived too late m life to avail them-
selves of its educational system.
The following table gives the number of schools, both public and private,
and enrolled scholars at different periods. Victoria, it should be remem-
bered, was separated in 1851, and Queensland in 180 .

Owing to the scattered character of the population m nearly all the coun ry
districts, the compulsory clauses of the Public Instruction Act canno e
strictly enforced, but there is every reason to believe that the number o
children growing up in absolute ignorance is very small. At the last tour
enumerations the proportion of persons from 5 to 10 years of age who could
read and write was in every 10,000 as follows :

Taking the persons from 10 to 20 years, a large proportion of whom would

more satisfactory:—

In 1819 a committee of the Legislature was appointed to “ consider and
report how best to institute an University for the promotion of literature
and science, to be endowed at the public expense.” In the following year a
bill, based for the most part on the charter of University College, London,
was introduced and passed. The University of Sydney has now become a most
prosperous and useful institution, and has been enriched by many magnificent
private benefactions, as well as by liberal grants from the Government. In
addition to the schools and directly educational institutions, public libraries
are distributed throughout the country, and the Government gives the
greatest encouragement to everything which tends to enlighten and improve
the people.
XVII. WORK AND WAGES.
The condition of the working classes in New South Wales has been steadily
improving, for, while wages have had an upward tendency, prices have been
declining. Uor purposes of comparison the period of the country’s occupation
can best be divided into eight parts, the first period is that prior to 1821,
when the forced labour of the bond dominated the market; the second, from
1821 to 1838, when there was a large immigration of free mechanics and


artisans, but the assignment system still continued ; the third, from 1838 to
1813, an exceptionally prosperous era, characterised by a great inflow of
British capital for investment. From 1843 to 1851, which comprises the
fourth epoch, there was extreme depression following the inflation of previous
years, which was only broken by the discovery of gold. From 185 Lto 18G1
the country was more or less disorganised on account of the gold-fields, and
from 1861 to 1872 things gradually quietened down after the gold-rush, and
labour returned to the more regular industries. Between 1872 and 1886
there was an overflowing Treasury, owing to the receipts from extensive sales
of Crown lands, and the expenditure on public works was lavish. From
1886 to the present time wages have been steady for the labour of mechanics,
varying slightly from 10s. to lls. per day. The average wages of the three
principal classes of labour have been as follows:

A bare statement of wages means very little unless tbe purchasing power
of the money earned is also shown. It will be seen that the money wages of
mechanics have doubled, the wages of farm laborers have increased two and

It has been estimated that the present income of wagn-earners am mint*
to £28,550,000 per annum, and the whole income of persons livino- or
holding property in New South Wales is approximately £62,950 000 or
£57 per head. A natural result of the prosperity of the people is’ a verv
high standard of living. The amount of grain, meat, sugar, and potatoes
per inhabitant which is required by the principal European countries and
the United States is as follows, if compared with New South Wales
Country.

Potatoes have been included in the above comparison, as in many instances
they are used largely to supplement, or in the place of grain. It will be
seen from the above table that the average inhabitant of New South Wales
uses annually two and a half times as much meat as an Englishman and
considerably more than half as much again as an American, while with
wl ai A t 0 , . nce and Germany the comparison is even more remarkable.
Whether this enormous consumption of meat is a matter for unqualified
congratulation is open to doubt, but it clearly demonstrates the general
material prosperity of the people and the comparative absence of poverty.
Ihis point becomes all the more emphatic when it is borne in mind that to
sustain this high standard of living only requires the earnings of 98 days’
labour per annum, or but 33 per cent, of the total income of the population.
In no other country m the world, with the exception, perhaps, of the United
States, is such a small proportion of the earnings of the people absorbed by
their requirements for food. Thus, in Erance 44 per cent., and in Germany
49 per cent., of the gross income goes for food, representing 132 and 148
days labour each year. In other words, the average wage-earner of New
bouth Waies, with an expenditure of more than £8 per year on food and
drink than the German, still has the earnings of fifty days in the year more
with which to provide himself with luxuries and amusements, while if the
shorter hours of labour which obtain in Australia are also made an element
ol the comparison, the position of the inhabitant of New South Wales
appears all the more satisfactory.
Under conditions so favourable it is not surprising that the savings of the
people have increased nearly tenfold. The total amount of money deposited
with all institutions is £43,357,600, including the deposits in banks, savings
banks, building and investment companies, and the Post Office. The deposits


in savings banks have increased from £557,200 in 1860 to £5,342,100 in
1891.

XVIII. SUMMARY OF PROGRESS.
In the following table an attempt has been made to show, in as brief and
graphic a form as possible, the most striking points in the progress of ISew
South Wales. The year 1860 has been chosen as the earliest date for pur-
poses of comparison, for on the Ist December, 1859, the province ot Moreton
Bay was erected into a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, and
the boundaries of New South Wales have since remained unchanged. An
examination of the statistical information for the years since 1860 cannot
fail to impress the reader with the marvellous growth of this, the mother
Colony of Australasia, in all that appertains to true progress and national
development. If the whole period of thirty years is divided into three almost
equal portions, a comparison of the statistics bearing upon twelve principal
points of the country’s growth show that the advance made has been as
follows: —

Thus it will be seen that during the thirty years under review, population
has increased more than threefold. The public revenue is more than nine
times as large now as in 1860, and if compared with population has increased


128 per cent. "With the extension of commerce and the increase of wealth
banking has more than kept pace, and the banking power, that is the aggre-
gate ot capital and deposits, has grown more than fourfold. Trade "with
places beyond the Country has increased from £12,600,000 in 1860 to over
f or more than 300 per cent. Eailways which were quite in their
mrancy at the beginning of the period, have grown with marvellous rapidity.
e figures given above represent the relative mileage open for traffic in
eac °* the years named, taking 1860 when only 70 miles had been completed
J? the standard. The area under crop is nearly four-and-a-half times greater
, an ears a § 0 > product from the mines during 1891 was more
than 642 per cent more valuable than in 1860. The number of persons
engaged m manufactures has more than trebled, and the live stock has
increased 166 per cent. . With the spread of instruction among the children
l wi e seen that the illiteracy of the people is being rapidly removed, so
a . a re t r ospect affords promise not only of the material prosperity of
the future, but of an equal development of art and literature.
