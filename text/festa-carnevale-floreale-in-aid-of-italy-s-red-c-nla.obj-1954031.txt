FIFTY YEARS have gone by since we started
out to cater for the Clothing needs of
Men and Boys, a period of time that has
marked many changes and much of progress in
the development of this store's service to the
public and the State.
As pioneer distributors of Australian-made
goods we can fairly claim to have fostered
the sentiment of preference for Australian
products, and incidentally also to have aided
in the establishment and growth of home
industries.
The maintenance of our known standards of
quality in all lines of Men's and Boys' Wear, the
assurance that a purchase here represents the
smallest expenditure for the value received, and
the courtesy and attention with which the wants
of our customers are met, are the principles
upon which this business was first established
and is to-day still carried on.
In the complete and satisfactory outfitting of
Men and Boys, we stand first in the field to-day
by right, both of service and seniority.
Our steadfast aim is now and ever shall be
to hold this pride of place.
