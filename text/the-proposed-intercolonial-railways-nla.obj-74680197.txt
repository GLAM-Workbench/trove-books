THE PROPOSED

SOUTH
AUSTRALIAN ADVERTISER
AUGUST 14, 1882.
FROM THE ?
quite within reason to expect that Ade-
laide would become the terminus of the
great mail routes if the proper interco-
lonial railway were constructed, but if we
by a circuitous route went round only to the
principal city we would very likely be left out
in the cold. Mr. Yuill, the manager of the
Orient line, in a recent fetter in which he
combated the idea that his directors had put
a stop to the steamers calling here out of mere
spleen, made the following remarks : ?? By
sending their steamers direct to Melbourne
they save on the voyage over two days in time,
two days in coal, and over two days in main-
tenance of passengers and crew, the last of
itself no inconsiderable item. By the saving
of time they can obtain from shippers to
Victoria, New South Wales, and New Zea-
land increased rates to their ports, which
would more than compensate for any loss on
Adelaide cargo, especially as such loss is al-
most confined to transhipment expenses of
the cargo from Melbourne to Adelaide. The
saving in time will further assist the mana-
gers to increase their sailings or curtail their
fleet. Again, the numerous disbursements
incidental to every steamer, and especi-
ally large passenger steamers, on enter-
ing any port will be saved for one
port Adelaide. As mail carriers also,
the time thus saved will give the Orient
line a correspondingly increased supe-
riority over other contract lines for corres-
pondence to or from Victoria, New Scutl
Wales, or New Zealand.? If the managers o
the Orient company found it to their in-
terest to pass Adelaide by, would not the
managers of the other companies find it to
their interest to do likewise ? If we could
save time by adopting a judicious rail route,
undoubtedly the mails, and with them pas-
sengers and steamers would continue to call
here ; but if we simply gave connection with
the principal port ?and that by a slow and
circuitous route ?would not Victoria (known
to be anxious to monopolise the mail
steamers, and with her population of 850,000,
aided by New South Wales, with her popula-
tion of 800,000), bs able to counterbalance
the claims of the 300,000 people of this colony ?
Taking the rail distance from Adelaide via
the Border to Melbourne at 650 miles, the
journey would occupy over 24 hours. Mr,
Yuill said two days were saved by
going to Melbourne direct, and if they
knocked those two days off and put it
that the steamers would reach Melbourne
only as early as they would reach Adelaide,
would not the saving of one day to the New
South Wales mails and passengers be suffi-
cient to enable Victoria to carry out her pet
scheme, at the cost of a day?s delay, to the
people of South Australia? This arrange-
ment would be carried out on the ground of
the greatest good to the greatest number, and
the mails and passengers would be lost to
South Australia ; and the traffic once diverted
into that route it would be most difficult to
recover. To connect the colonies?taking the
distances from the map between the present

adoption of the line recommended by the ventured to believe that if South Australia
we should have to cover about 130 miles from
Morgan to Wentworth, New South Wales
170 miles from Hay to Wentworth, Victoria
70 miles from Deniliquin to Hay ; and, to
connect Queensland, 75 miles from Sydney to
Newcastle; and 50 miles from Stanthorpe to
Tenterfield. The distances roughly would be ?
Adelaide to Melbourne, via the boroer, 650
miles; Adelaide to Sydney, via the border,
1,170 miles; and the distance, via Went-
worth, would be to Melbourne 700 miles, and
to Sydney 860 miles; so that while the
latter route lost fifty miles in the case of
Melbourne it gained 300 in the case
of Sydney. He had got from a parliamentary
paper some figures that would perhaps be
found of an interesting character. The dis-
tance from Adelaide to Melbourne via Went-
worth was 589 miles; the cost of the line
from Morgan to Wentworth would be
�780,000; the time spent on the journey
would be twenty-four hours; the annual
working expenses for one train per day, Ade-
laide up, would amount to �29,000; the in-
terest on capital to �31,000; and the total
annual cost to �60,000. The line via Border
Town to Melbourne would be 529 miles in
length; the cost of construction for the whole
distance from Adelaide to the Victorian
border would amount to �1,550,00 ; the time
spent on the journey would be twenty-four
hours ; the annual working expenses for one
train per day, Adelaide up, would amount to
�55,000; interest on capital to �62,000; and
the total annual cost to �117,000. A synopsis
of the probable working expenses and revenue
in the case of the line via the border showed
that for the section from Adelaide to Nairne
the working expenses, including main-
tenance and depreciation would amount to
�11,884, and the probable revenue to �67,678.
The working expenses for the section from
Nairne to the Murray Bridge would amount
to �18,395, and the working expenses for the
section from the bridge to the Victorian
border were put down at �57,857. He did
not know whether they might fairly conclude
that the probable revenue, in respect of the
two last-mentioned sections, was so small that
the officers who prepared the return did not
think it worth taking into account; but at
any rate it was not given. With regard to
the question whether New South Wales would
v teet us at the border, he might mention that
i the course of a debate which took place in
the House of Assembly on September 10,
1879, Mr. Fowler made the following re-
marks : ?? He held in his hand an official
report from the Engineer-In-Chief and Sur-
veyor-General of New South Wales to the
Government, bearing on this question. [The
question was the conference upon the inter-
colonial railways.] It was speaking in favor
of the railway from Junee to Narrandera.
The officials said that the line to Narrandera
particularly with an extension on the north
bank to Hay, offers greater facilities beyond
that point for ultimate extension to Adelaide
with advantage to New South Wales than
any other line. Such extension would pro-
bably cross the Lachlan above the Oxley
Marshes and intercept the Darling traffic at
or a little above Wentworth. The Govern-
ment adopted the policy embraced in the
report of their officers and brought in a Bill
to give good effect to it. In introducing it
the Minister of Works said ?? It could not
be many years before our own mails from
South Australia would all be brought over-
land to Sydney, and that circumstance should
be borne in mind; but in whatever way the
question considered it would be seen un-
mistakeably that the proposal he was now
making to the House was one that in the
interests of the colony should be carried into
effect. One of the members of the New
South Wales Parliament, in supporting the
railway, said ??It was the best route, the
shortest to the point they were seeking to
reach, and eventually would be the grand
trunk line to South Australia. Ic was a
pity the line was not constructed earlier??

vernment was pretty clearly disclosed by their

worth. Hay, and Deniliquin, 700 miles.
The Chairman thought Mr. Joyner must
be wrong in his figures. The distance by the
railway which had been constructed from
Melbourne to Dimboola was 251 miles, and
there was a distance of 75 miles from Dim-
boola to the border. From the border to the
Murray bridge there was a distance of 130
miles, and it was 65 miles from the bridge to
Adelaide. This made 521 miles in all. The
distance from Adelaide via Morgan to Went-
worth was 254 miles, from Wentworth to Hay
260 miles, and from Hay to Sydney 460 miles,
or a total of 974 miles.
Mr. S. Bickford could not understand
how the chamber could form an idea that
the route via Wentworth was superior to that
via the south-east. From Wentworth to
Mor* an they had the river to contend with,
and nearly the whole of the country there was
valueless excepting for squatting purposes.
The country too was not anything like first-
class land for pastoral purposes. He believed,
indeed, that it was rated as third-class land.
Therefore if we took the line to Wentworth
we could scarcely expect to gain much traffic,
especially as the river would be running
alongside and competing with the railway. If
we wanted to go to Sydney by railway, and
wished to open up some valuable country, the
line should be taken from Terowie on to the
Barrier Ranges, and from thence to Wilcannia.
By that means we should be opening up
country valuable for agricultural and
pastoral purposes, and would be de-
veloping that country towards the
centre of Australia which we wished to
develop. The Murray was open for nearly
nine months out of the twelve, and all the
wool grown near the banks of the Murray
could be readily brought to market. The
Darling on the other hand was closed fre-
quently for twelve months at a time, Wil-
cannia was situated almost at the centre of
the Darling. It was a large and flourishing
town and was surrounded by an immense
agricultural district. If we were to take the
railway to Wilcannia we would be certainly
doing a considerable amount of good for
South Australia, because by tapping the
Darling there we would be in the centre of
Riverina. Wool came in from the Lachlan,
Murrumbidgee, and the back countries
towards Wilcannia, and he had no doubt
that the time was not far distant when the
New South Wales Government would extend
their railway from Hay to Wilcannia. It
would, to his mind, be the height of absurdity
to take the railway along the banks of the
Murray, and thus compete with the water
carriage.
was certainly in error in stating that the
Lachlan wool would go there. Wilcannia
was nearer to Sydney than to Adelaide, and
the Lachlan was very much nearer to Sydney
than to Adelaide. The greatest portion of
the Lachlan was only 300 miles from Sydney.
We could never carry the wool so cheaply in
South Australia as it was carried in New
South Wales.
Mr. T. Rhodes said the best course for the
chamber to adopt would be to recommend the
construction of a line connecting us with
Sydney, and to leave the question of route to be
decided afterwards. He was quite convinced
from the arguments of Mr. Joyner, from his
own personal observations, and from the fact
that the Hon. W. Morgan, one of our most
able statesman, confidently favored the line
to Sydney in preference to one to Melbourne,
that the interests of South Australia would
best be served by our first being connected
with Sydney, whatever might be done with
regard to Melbourne afterwards. It would,
however, be inexpedient for the chamber to
say at the present time whether the railway
should go via Wentworth or Wilcannia.
(Hear, hear.)
Mr. Gilbert Wood supported the motion,
expressing his belief that ere long both the
P. and O. and Orient Companies would find it
to their advantage to make South Adelaide
their only port of call, so saving the long
voyages to and from Sydney and Melbourne.
By making a railway from Adelaide to the
other colonies along a central route, and pro-
viding proper accommodation for the large
ocean steamers calling here, he felt convinced
that in time South Australia would become
the only place of call, and that the passengers,
mails, and most of the valuable cargo would
be sent from Adelaide by rail to the other
cities of the continent,
*
The Hon. J. Dunn, M.L.C. complimented
Mr. Joyner on the way in which he had put
his case before the chamber, but differed
from him in his opinions on the question. If
it were ever so desirable to connect Morgan by
railway with Wentworth, the New South
Wales Government were not prepared to meet
us in the matter. That could be seen from
the evidence taken at the general conference
held in 1881. There, it seemed, the delegates
had not entertained the idea for a moment ;
? they were not warm upon the question,
to say the least. If a line to Wentworth
I were made it would pass through barren
country so far as the distance between
! Morgan and Wentworth was concerned.
Moreover, we had a river already, and we had
not yet arrived at the time when we could
1 afford to make railways running parallel with
He believed it was worth a great deal of
money. He knew gentlemen who were pre-
pared" to take up tens of thousands of acres
of the land at say 10s. per acre. It had been
said that the line would have no commercial
advantages, but he submitted that it would
tap the valuable Tatiara country. It would
be no very considerable distance to bring
grain from the Tatiara to the Murray bridge ;
and if Victor Harbor was to become the
great port many expected it to be there would
he a place of shipment for this produce.
Even to Port Adelaide the distance would
only be something over 200 miles. Victoria
I was approaching the border with her railway,
and as the Nairne line would in any case be
extended as far as Callington, only a small
gap would be left to bridge over, so small that
it would be a mistake not to provide the
missing link. If better facilities for the ocean
steamers were provided in the shape of an
outer harbor, the steamers would certainly
all call at Port Adelaide, and passengers and
valuable cargo would be put in the train to
be sent to Melbourne and Sydney, He could
not support the motion.
Mr. Joyner, in reply, said it had been re-
presented that the mail steamers going to
Melbourne took from eighteen to twenty-four
hours longer than they would in going to
Adelaide. Now the railway journey from
Adelaide to Melbourne would take twenty-
four hours, consequently the P. & O. Com-
pany, according to Messrs. Elder, Smith, and
Co., could deliver their mails frequently six
hours earlier than they could from Adelaide.
With regard to the statement that the line to
Wentworth would not pay, he would call at-
tention to the amount of goods on the Mor-
gan line which line at times was unable to
carry all the traffic. He quite believed in the
line via Terowie, but he did not think that
railway would tap the intercolonial
trade. So far as the question of cargo
was concerned they found one steamer bring-
ing 300 tons for Adelaide and 2,700 to the
other colonies, while the Marsala, having a
capacity for 4,000 tons, only brought 300 tons
for Adelaide. This showed what an incon-
siderable part of the steamer traffic we had,
and how very little it would take to make
these steamers leave us. He had no doubt
that the south-eastern railways would bring
the wool from the Tatiara country down
to Kingston, instead of going over the
Murray bridge, because people generally
liked to get their produce to the nearest port
of shipment. (Hear, hear.)
The motion was carried unanimously, about
nineteen gentlemen being then present and
one or two not voting. The proceedings then
terminated.
