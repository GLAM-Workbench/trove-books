Foreword
This Review is one of the series of Brief Re-
views of Australian manufacturing industries
issued for general information by the Division
of Industrial Development.
The Review briefly examines the general de-
mand and supply situation in the industry, the
principal factors of production such as labour,
raw material and equipment, and other relevant
matters. It does not purport to be a detailed and
comprehensive study of the industry. It has been
based on the statistics and other data, not being
of a confidential character, which are available in
this and other Government Departments, and on
the results of discussions by the Division’s
officers with various persons associated with
the industry.
The advice and assistance of manufacturers,
distributors and trades union executives, of State
Departments, and of other Commonwealth De-
partments is gratefully acknowledged. Reference
is made in particular to the collaboration of the
Department of Labour and National Service in
the preparation of the section of the Review
dealing with the labour position.
The Division of Industrial Development will
be pleased on application to discuss and, where
possible, to amplify any matters relating to the
industry under review. Such applications may
be made to the Director, Division of Industrial
Development, Wentworth House, 203 Collins
Street, Melbourne, or to the Division’s Deputy
Directors at 119 Phillip Street, Sydney; National
House, Ann Street, Brisbane; and Bank of
N.S.W. Chambers, King William Street, Adel-
aide; or the Senior Representative, Division of
Industrial Development, Australia House, The

BRIEF REVIEW
of the
AUSTRALIAN HARD COKE INDUSTRY
1. INTRODUCTION.
Cokes of various types are produced by the heating of certain
kinds of coal out of contact with the air, or with a very limited
supply of air. Cokes are roughly classified for practical purposes
into “hard” and “soft” cokes. The pre-treatment of the coal
(degree of grinding) and the actual carbonising conditions (tem-
perature and time, and the shape of the chamber) determine
whether a given coal yields the one or the other.
The following table sums up the more apparent distinctions
between the two types of coke:
It is possible to produce a series of cokes of graduated proper-
ties from the same coal by varying the conditions of treatment
and production, but it happens that the actual demand is for
cokes at the extremes of the range.
Hard coke has been manufactured in Australia for almost
one hundred years. It is an essential raw material in the metall-
urgical industries for the production of iron, copper and lead,
and for the manufacture of metal castings. It has always occupied
a place of prime importance in the development of the secondary
industries of this country and will continue to do so as industry
further develops.
Although, for some purposes, soft coke may be used as an
inferior substitute for hard coke, such use is limited coke for
furnace use must be as strong as possible. On the other hand,
hard coke may be readily substituted for soft coke for certain
purposes.
This Review is not concerned with soft coke, except to the
extent that a shortage of this fuel affects hard coke supplies for
those purposes for which hard coke is essential or preferred.
Hard coke is almost wholly carbon, with a small percentage
of volatile material (mostly hydrogen) plus a variable percentage
of ash, which is the incombustible constituent of the coal. Its
strength and hardness are sufficient to sustain the crushing
weight of furnace charges in the smelting of iron, copper and lead,
and in melting of foundry charges in shaft (cupola) furnaces.


The hardness, porosity, chemical reactivity and shatter re-
sistance of hard coke depend on the type and quality of the coal,
and the conditions under which it is prepared and ultimately
carbonised. Rough or excessive handling of any coke tends to
increase the proportion of “fines” or coke “breeze.”
The quality of the coke depends also on the proportion of
ash which is present in the coal. In highly industrialised countries
overseas, where by-product ovens are in general use, these are
generally charged with coal which has been washed (which re-
duces the ash constituents) crushed and screened. In Australia
it has been the practice (except in the steelworks) to use ovens
of somewhat primitive types and to charge them with small coal
(or coal “duff”) obtained direct from the coal mines and crushed
at the cokeworks. This coal is commonly higher in ash than
larger coal from the same seam. The increasing use of coal
from mechanised collieries, with its high ash content, further
aggravates this tendency and has caused a serious deterioration in
coke quality.
Most of the hard coke produced in Australia is made by the
iron and steel industry for its own use in the production of iron
and steel. The coke-producing capacity of the steelworks, there-
fore, is directly related to their capacity for iron and steel pro-
duction; and the planning of coke-making capacity is governed
by the needs of the integrated industry.
The two associated steelworks, The Broken Hill Proprietary
Co. Ltd. at Newcastle and Australian Iron and Steel Ltd. at
Port Kembla, operate large by-product recovery plants with total
capacity for the production of about 1,700,000 tons of coke a year,
requiring approximately 2,850,000 tons of coking coal. Latterly
these plants have been operating at about 80 per cent of capacity.
This Review is concerned, however, with that relatively small
but important section of the Australian coke-making industry
which produces hard coke for purposes other than the production
of iron and steel. These include the melting of metal in foundries,
the smelting of non-ferrous metals and the production of heavy
chemicals. This section of the coke-making industry consists of
small independent producers who are not organised to undertake
the planning of the industry’s productive capacity on the basis
of the probable demand for their product. At the same time, the
individual units have been deterred from undertaking expansion,
mainly because of the shortage of their raw material coal.
Consequently, the supply position, faced with rising demand
threatens to deteriorate seriously and rapidly unless positive
countermeasures are adopted.
This Review is primarily concerned with the relationships
of capacity, supply and demand for hard coke during 1951-52 and
subsequent years. It does not attempt to discuss the technical
aspects of coke production, except insofar as changing conditions
have exposed the inadequacies of the existing means of produc-
tion and distribution.

2. STRUCTURE OF THE INDUSTRY.
The hard coke industry comprises two distinct elements, the
major steelworks which produce coke in their own ovens for
use in the production of iron and steel and the independent
producers, who supply other consumers. The latter are referred
to in this Review as the “commercial producers.”
There are seven commercial producers in Australia, which
are listed in the following table:—
It will be seen that the industry is centred in New South
Wales, where it consists of small independent producers. They
operate plants at least 35 years old. The cokeworks at Bowen,
Queensland, were constructed in 1932-33, but the ovens are
based on earlier New South Wales patterns.
Although the structure of the industry is apparently com-
petitive, under present conditions of continued shortage com-
petition is non-existent. Producers supply only established custom-
ers and some major consumers have negotiated long-term con-
tracts with the cokeworks to ensure adequate supplies for their
own special uses.

3. THE GENERAL MARKET SITUATION.
(i) DEMAND
The demand for hard coke other than for iron and steel pro-
duction comes mainly from foundries and from non-ferrous smel-
ters. These two share almost equally about 90 per cent, of the
demand.
It is estimated that the demand for hard coke during 1951-52
will be at least 226,500 tons. Of this amount about 101,000 tons
will be required for the production of iron and steel castings;
about 94,500 tons for the smelting of copper and lead; the balance
of about 31,000 tons will be required for such important purposes
as the production of heavy chemicals, the production of rock and
slag wool for thermal insulation and the melting of non-ferrous
metals.
In the case of the iron foundries, demand is restricted by
the current shortage of foundry labour. It has been assumed that
sufficient pig iron will be available to fully occupy available labour.
The following table shows the estimated minimum demand for
hard coke in each State according to industry for the year 1951-52.
* Coke for all purposes.
f Coke for all purposes other than non-ferrous smelting.
These demand estimates are based on requirements of coke
of the quality being produced at present and they include normal
losses of coke breeze. In each case the estimates are conservative;
they do not include, for example, additional demands for hard
coke which have arisen as a result of the current shortage of
soft coke particularly for the production of ammonia, soda ash
and carbide by the heavy chemicals industry. Such requirements
are not usually regarded as demands for hard coke as they would
disappear if supplies of soft coke were available. If such demands
were included, the total demand figure would be of the order of
260,000 tons for the year 1951-52.

In addition to the above figures, there is at present an addition-
al non-recurrent demand for hard coke to provide operating stocks,
which are at present negligible. Assuming operating stock to
be about three months supply, this non-recurrent demand would
amount to about 50,000 tons. Such a stock of coke is essential
to normal efficiency.
The pattern of demand has changed markedly since the
first decade of the century. It has reflected the economic changes
and technological progress of the non-ferrous smelting industry,
and the extensive development of iron and steel foundries in this
country. During the past 10 years demand has reflected the needs
of the expanding secondary industries of Australia. The next five
years will almost certainly see a further substantial increase in the
demand for hard coke and also a changing pattern of usage, as
shown by the following table: —
It will be noted that the proportion of demand arising from
the non-ferrous smelting industry is likely to rise substantially;
this is due to major projected developments in this field. It is
expected that demand from the other fields will not show any
similar rapid expansion.
Once again attention must be drawn to the fact that if the
current shortage of soft coke continues the consequent additional
demand for hard coke as a substitute will continue at least at the
present level of about 30,000 tons a year.
The estimated Australian demand for the year 1955, therefore,
is a conservative one, including demands for firm projects only.
There may be other projects which at present are only in the
planning stage which could necessitate an upward revision of
these figures perhaps markedly.
Export Markets
The foregoing estimates exclude any demands which might
arise from other countries.
Immediately prior to World War 11, the Australian industry
had built up a considerable export trade in hard coke. During
the year 1937-38, 36,076 tons were exported, mainly to New
Caledonia, (for the production of nickel) and to New Zealand.
Small quantities were exported to Fiji, the Phillippines and other
Pacific Islands.

Since the war, the steady decline in exports has reflected the
growing shortage of hard coke in this country, as shown by the
following table;—
Exports to New Caledonia for the production of nickel were
maintained at reasonable levels during the war for strategic
reasons, but Australian inability to export coke or coking coal to
this market in sufficient quantity in the postwar period has been
partially responsible for the reduced production of nickel since
1946.
Nevertheless New Caledonia, together with New Zealand
—which at present is forced to obtain a substantial part of her
supplies from other sources at high cost remain as potential
markets. It is possible that demand from these two countries would
be as high as 40,000 tons per annum.
Summary of Future Demand
While the demand for the year 1955 is conservatively stated
as above at 330,000 tons, it is probable that the actual demand will
be substantially higher. A demand of 330,000 tons may be regarded
as a minimum while the maximum, allowing for demands arising
from exports, a provision of working stocks, the shortage of soft
coke and other such factors may be in the vicinity of 400,000 tons,
(ii) SUPPLY
Capacity of Local Producers
The carbonising of coal to produce coke is a batch process and,
in ovens of the beehive or modified beehive type, each cycle takes
about 3 days to complete. The number, size and type of oven,
therefore, determine production capacity. The capacity of the
commercial coke producers in Australia is approximately 207,000
tons of hard coke per annum about 177,000 tons in New South
Wales and 30,000 tons in Queensland.
On the average, Australian coke works recover as hard coke
about 66 per cent, of the weight of coal carbonised. Capacity
production would therefore require approximately 314,000 tons
of coking coal a year or about 6,680 tons per working week.


Production
Production of hard coke by the commercial producers during
1949- 147,900 tons, was at a level of approximately 70 per cent,
of the installed plant capacity of 207,000 tons. The chief reason
for failure to reach a higher level of production was the shortage
of coking coal. In New South Wales, the major producing State,
production of coke was almost 50,000 tons short of capacity,
despite the fact that the Joint Coal Board, in allocating avail-
able supplies of coking coal, accorded the coke works a high
priority.
During the last six months of 1950, allocations of coal to
the works, both in New South Wales and Queensland, improved
and production rose to a yearly rate of 178,000 tons, or 86 per
cent, of capacity. The position deteriorated, however, during
the first six months of 1951 and the production for the year
1950- was only 173,000 tons, or 83 per cent, of capacity. In
the quarter July to September 1951, production was at the rate
of 180,000 tons per year, or 87 per cent, of capacity. This fluctuation
of production reflects, of course, the allocation of coking coal. Even
if the supplies of coal could be increased, the flow would have to be
regular if coke production were to benefit. The cokeworks in New
South Wales lack adequate coal storage facilities and are therefore
very dependent on regularity of supplies. Stoppages at collieries
directly associated with the works cause temporary cessation of
coke production, while the limited flexibility of the transport
system in conjunction with the location of the present works
limits their ability to secure coal from other sources.
Some of the works have insufficient facilities for the storage
of coke after production and this, combined with the acute shortage
of rail trucks, causes temporary bottlenecks and disrupts pro-
duction, The shortage of rail trucks arose from the wartime
deferment of maintenance and replacement and although large
orders for trucks have been placed it will be some time before
rail facilities are adequate. Under these conditions the installation
of additional storage capacity both for coal and coke could mater-
ially assist in maintaining uninterrupted production. The cost
of such installations and the hope that coal supplies would be
more regular have discouraged the producers all relatively
small from undertaking such improvements.
Imports
In the immediate prewar years Australia was a net exporter
of hard coke, but considerable quantities were imported, particu-
larly by Western and South Australia. These imports ceased
with the commencement of hostilities.

The following table shows the fluctuating level of imports
from 1934-35 to 1950-51.
Since the war, the shortage of hard coke in Australia has
become progressively more acute but supplies of coke from over-
seas sources have also been scarce and landed costs have been
high. Since 1949, however, when bulk shipments became available
at reasonable prices (although still more than double Australian
prices) imports have been at a high level, as shown in the above
table.
Not all of this coke, however, has been imported for purposes
for which hard coke is essential or preferred. In the year 1949-50
approximately 17,000 tons was imported to replace soft coke,
also in short supply; and in 1950-51, about 22,500 tons was im-
ported for this purpose. The following table shows the source
and value of imported hard coke for all purposes for the year
1950-51.
It is necessary to ship coke in bulk to obtain reasonable
freight rates and in the past this has prevented the small con-
sumer from importing, unless in concert with other members of
his trade. This involves considerable finance and organisation
often beyond the resources of small trade groups.
An acute shortage of metallurgical coke has recently developed
in Europe, resulting in increased pressure on other sources of
supply. The temporary surplus in South Africa, which was a
major source of Australian imports, has now disappeared.
It is unlikely, therefore, that recent import levels will be
maintained.
* These imports were all hard coke.

Additional Supplies
Although the commercial producers are the normal source
of supply for users other than the steelworks, in the current
shortage the steelworks have made available small quantities of
hard coke to other users, despite their own pressing needs. Over
the past two years about 12,000 tons per annum have been made
available by the steelworks.
Distribution
Coke is distributed by the commercial producers either directly
to consumers or through merchants. The latter practice particu-
larly obtains outside New South Wales. While the coke producers
make some attempt to ensure an equitable distribution among
consumers and States, the lack of adequate transport facilities
has seriously interfered with interstate distribution. Consequently,
the shortage has not been felt so much in New South Wales and
Queensland as in other States, where dependence on New South
Wales supplies creates periodic famines.
The following table shows the distribution to each State of
hard coke produced by the commercial producers for the years
1949-50 and 1950-51. For comparison, the estimated minimum de-
mand in each State for the year 1951-52 is also included and the
final column shows the extent to which that demand could be
met from local sources at the 1950-51 level of distribution;—

This table shows the extent to which shortages of coastal
shipping space and other factors have prevented the equitable
distribution of New South Wales coke. As might be expected
from these figures, coke imported into Australia in recent years
has gone chiefly to those States which have gone short in local
supplies. In 1950-51, for example, some 10,000 tons of coke was
imported into Victoria for use in that State for essential hard
coke purposes. The following table shows the distribution of
hard coke supplies to industries for which hard coke is essen-
tial or preferred:—
Total availability for essential hard coke purposes for the
year 1950-51 fell short of demand by some 25,000 tons, a signifi-
cant proportion of the total. There were, however, some major
factors of distribution which aggravated the position to a very
marked degree. Ihe level of imports, particularly into Victoria,
was much higher at the latter end of the year than in the earlier
months, so that there was a carry over of stock at the end of the
period. The supply during the first half of the year, therefore,
was much further below minimum requirements than suggested by
the above table; and the future outlook for some years is consider-
ably worse.


(iii) FUTURE PROSPECTS
In view of the limitations already outlined it is improbable
that the New South Wales producers could achieve an output ex-
ceeding 90 per cent, of capacity over a yearly period, even if total
coal supplies were adequate. This level of production would make
available approximately 160,000 tons per annum from New South
Wales,
In Queensland, production could be raised to about 30,000
tons per annum given adequate coal and more efficient operation
of the coke works; but it is unlikely that production will exceed
25.000 tons per annum unless the “darg” at present imposed on
production is removed.
On this basis, therefore, a production of about 185,000 tons
is possible for 1951-52, given continuity of production on the
coalfields. It is unlikely that supplies from the steelworks and
from imports will exceed 30,000 tons in 1951-52, leaving a gap
of at least 45,000 tons which there appears little prospect of
closing. This tonnage does not at first glance appear to be very
great but because of the structure of coke usage in Australia, the
shortage is likely to fall to a disproportionate extent on the iron
and steel foundries where a shortage of, say, 20,000 tons would
mean an inability to melt an additional 100,000 tons of metal.
By 1955, moreover, demand will have risen to a minimum of
330.000 tons and the figure may be as high as 400,000 tons. This
is respectively about 120,000 tons and 190,000 tons in excess of
present installed plant capacity. The only known plans for ex-
pansion will only raise capacity to 221,000 tons by 1955.
Notwithstanding the acute shortage, it seems unlikely that
the New South Wales commercial producers will instal additional
plant. Apart from the high cost of installation, relative to the
small financial resources of these firms, serious consideration
could not be given to such a project without a firm guarantee
of adequate coal supplies, an assurance which cannot be given
at present.
The Government of Queensland is now considering the erec-
tion of additional plant in North Queensland. Success of this
project will depend upon obtaining more coal from the State
Coal Mine at Collinsville. The construction of modern ovens,
however, would take at least two years to complete, and no re-
lief from this source can be expected in the immediate future.
Some large users of coke from commercial sources have con-
sidered proposals to establish new coke ovens to ensure adequate
supplies, but it is unlikely that they will act on the proposals in
the next five years.
Until additional plant capacity is installed, it is essential that
every means by which the shortage can be relieved be fully ex-
ploited. The production of hard coke must be maintained at the
highest possible level, and every effort must be made to improve
its quality. In prewar days, hard coke contained about 12 to 15
per cent, ash, but it now commonly carries more than 20 per cent.


Apart from the additional costs imposed on using industries by the
necessity for heavy fluxing to deal with this higher ash content,
there is a reduction of up to 10 per cent, in the calorific value of
the coke and consequently more has to be used. In addition, the
high ash content renders the coke more liable to breakage in transit,
with the consequent production of breeze.
A reduction in the ash content of the coal would therefore
be important in enabling the limited coke-making capacity available
in the critical years ahead to be used to the best advantage.
Where coal lends itself to this treatment, washing offers a
means of reducing the ash-yielding constituents. As a first step,
the erection of a single coal washing unit designed to supply some
or all of the South Coast producers with better charges would
appear to be the most efficient method of improving the situation,
but there are difficulties. Ideally, such a unit should be based on
a single source of coal, and this would involve a change in the
present sources of coal for the coke ovens. This might _be re-
sisted by those producers already associated with collieries and
therefore relatively well-supplied with coal. The project would
also involve some re-organisation of the present system of trans-
port and distribution.
Alternatively, the erection of small washing units by the
individual coke producers might be possible. The producers are
discouraged however from embarking on these projects by the
continued shortage of coal; their resources are small and such
improvements would only be economical if operated at full capac-
ity. In addition, there is little incentive to sink capital into im-
provements of this kind to improve coke quality when there is
no difficulty in selling the inferior product. the
larger producers, interested in maintaining their relative position
in the industry, must give more attention to this problem and
plan ahead to be ready to meet the situation as coal supplies
improve.
Apart from the excessively high ash-content of coke at present
produced, deliveries to States other than New South Wales often
contain an undue proportion of coke breeze, caused by rough and
excessive handling in transit. This condition is more often found
in coke shipped from Port Kembla, where an improvement of
loading facilities at No. I Jetty appears necessary.
4. LABOUR.
No official statistics of employment in the metallurgical coke
industry as defined for purposes of this Review are published by
the Commonwealth Statistician. Figures for Australian coke works
are provided, the coverage is very much broader than the
scope of this Review.
From information available in the Department of Labour
and National Service, it appears that there was, in December 1950,
a total of 206 workers employed in the industry* in seven estab-
lishments, of which two employed fewer than 25 hands each, four
between 25 and 50 hands, and one more than 50 hands.
* Excluding the steelworks.


The industry was in an extremely favourable position in re-
gard to supply. In New South Wales, four firms had no
unfilled vacancies and a fifth had a waiting list of persons seeking
employment; in Queensland there have been no unfilled vacancies
for some years.
Employment in the industry is confined to adult males.
Awards both in New South Wales and Queensland, however,
prescribe rates for youths up to the age of 20 in the former State
and 19 in the latter, after which ages full adult rates are payable.
The labour force is predominantly unskilled, training where
necessary being provided on the job. The usual maintenance
tradesmen and the managerial staff make up the 14 per cent, of
workers in the industry classed as skilled.
Coal dust, heat, unpleasant odours and fumes render working
conditions in the industry unattractive. Moreover, amenities,
though varying among establishments are somewhat inadequate
over the industry as a whole.
There is no separate award of the Commonwealth Court of
Conciliation and Arbitration covering employees in the industry.
Working conditions for most employees are regulated by awards
of the Industrial Commission in New South Wales and the In-
dustrial Court in Queensland,
In New South Wales, the Coke Works (State) Award may
be taken as being fairly representative of conditions in the industry.
Instead of the usual series of classifications and margins for skill,
there is a single minimum rate laid down for all adult male em-
ployees. This rate, which is calculated upon an hourly basis, is
subject to quarterly adjustments according to variations in the
cost of living and over a full working week amounts to a sum
considerably greater than the current basic wage.
As at the first pay period in August 1951, this adult minimum
rate stood at per hour or £l2/2/6 for a standard working
week. In addition each employee is paid the sum of a shilling per
shift for each shift worked at ordinary rates of pay.
The award provides for ten days’ sick pay, three weeks’ annual
leave and nine paid holidays per year. It also stipulates that when,
during working hours, employees get wet through rain and/or
unusual working conditions, they are to be paid 1/6 per shift
extra, and lays down that where necessary protective clothing
shall be provided.
Standard working hours are eighty per fortnight, worked
Monday to Friday in eight-hour shifts inclusive of thirty minutes
crib time. Provision is made for overtime, usually paid at the
rate of time-and-a-half for the first two hours and double-time
thereafter.
The award also provides that where dismissals are caused
by the need for retrenchments, the principle “last to come, first
to go” shall apply both to the termination of employee’s service
and, other things being equal, to any subsequent re-employment.
The principal employee organisations in the industry are the
Australasian Coal and Shale Employees’ Federation in New South
Wales and the Australian Workers’ Union in Queensland.


5. RAW MATERIALS.
Coal suitable for the manufacture of metallurgical coke occurs
in New South Wales in the Bulli and No. 2 and 3 seams of the
Southern Coalfields and in the Borehole and Victoria seams of
the Newcastle field.
Good coking coal also occurs in Queensland at Collinsville
in the Bowen district of the Central coalfields, and in restricted
areas in the Ipswich field. The known black coals that occur in
other States are not good coking coals.
The commercial producers require, for capacity production,
approximately 314,000 tons of coking coal per annum, or about
6,680 tons per week. During 1949-50, deliveries totalled only
224.000 tons, or about 90,000 tons short of requirements.
During the last quarter of 1950, deliveries of coal to New
South Wales commercial producers improved considerably to
an average weekly level of 5,000 tons. Deliveries for the last six
weeks of the quarter averaged 5,100 tons.
This improvement was made possible by the uninterrupted
production of black coal in New South Wales. Improved alloca-
tions were also assisted by the importation of black coal, under
Commonwealth subsidy, by States other than New South Wales.
Allocations for the first six months of 1951, however, averaged
about 4,000 tons per week or little more than 70 per cent, of
capacity requirements; but for the following quarter of the year,
July to September 1951, the deliveries were at the rate of 4,895
tons per week, about 86 per cent, of capacity requirements.
In Queensland, production of coking coal at the State Coal
Mine at Collinsville has been well below wartime levels, despite
the increased demand for coal for all purposes. Deliveries to the
Bowen State Cokeworks during 1949-50 averaged only 630 tons
per week compared with capacity requirements of approximately
1.000 tons per week.
As in New South Wales, deliveries improved considerably
during the last quarter of 1950 to an average level of 867 tons
per week, but for the first six months of 1951 less than 700 tons
per week were supplied on the average. With the exception of
two weeks in August, when a stoppage at the State Coal Mine
restricted production, deliveries for the July to September quarter
averaged 820 tons per week. Mechanisation of the State Coal Mine
at Collinsville would make possible an increase in production far
more than sufficient to enable the cokeworks to operate at full
capacity.
6. EQUIPMENT.
Various types of ovens may be used in the production of
hard coke. These range from the out-moded beehive oven to the
complex by-product recovery oven.
The essential feature of the beehive type of oven is that the
coking process is carried out directly by the heat developed within
the oven by combustion of part of the charge. Modifications permit
the mechanisation of the process and the utilisation of the fuel
gases generated during the process.


Although differing amongst themselves in design and oper-
ation, modern coke ovens are invariably heated indirectly by the
use of vertical or horizontal flues, permitting the gases emerging
from the coking chambers of the oven to be treated for the re-
covery of by-products. These by-products included tar, am-
moniacal liquor and gases. The tar may be further processed
to obtain light, medium and heavy oils and pitch and more highly
refined substances such, as naphthalene and phenols. The am-
moniacal liquor is treated to produce ammonium sulphate and
other derivatives. From the gases, valuable hydrocarbons — 1 in
particular, benzene and toluene may be recovered. Until very
recently, this was the major source of these two valuable chemical
raw materials. Residual gases may be used for steam raising or
for industrial and domestic heating purposes.
In Australia, the by-product type of oven is installed at the
two major steelworks. The ovens of the commercial producers
are of the beehive or modified beehive type. The latter are rec-
tangular in plan, _ permitting the coke to be “pushed” from the
ovens on completion of the process by a mechanical ram. In one
case, the ovens have been adapted to permit the hot gasses emerg-
ing from the ovens to be used as a source of energy to heat the
boilers; in another case alterations to permit the recovery of waste
heat are under way.
Although some consumers, mainly foundrymen, prefer beehive
coke mainly because of its density and hardness these ovens
are particularly unsuited to overcoming the difficulties associated
with the high ash content of Australian coals in fact, they
intensify the problem. These ovens are based on designs which
were abandoned overseas many years ago.
Not only does the use of this type of oven deprive Aust-
ralian industry of valuable chemical by-products, which are per-
mitted to escape into the atmosphere in the form of gases, but
valuable coke is lost by the direct burning of the coal during the
process. The loss from this cause may be as much as 10 per cent.,
or 20,000 tons of coke a year on present levels of production. The
saving of this amount would help substantially to reduce the
present shortage.
The modern by-product recovery ovens carbonise coal in one-
third to one-quarter of the time required by the beehive ovens and
thus are also less costly in time and manpower.
The continued use of the beehive ovens is a direct result of the
conditions under which the industry has developed in this country.
Years ago when particularly good coking coal was available, small
producers were able to produce good coke at low cost, in plant
units which lent themselves to relatively small-scale production,
using unskilled labour and not requiring fine control. On the
other hand, the market for by-products was then limited and the
advantage to be gained from the installation of by-product recovery
ovens appeared doubtful, particularly since the location of the
plants, usually close to the source of coal, would have necessitated
transport of crude by-products to centres at which they could be
further treated.


These conditions have changed to some extent, particularly
in recent years; good quality coking coal is no longer freely avail-
able and there is now a much greater potential market for the by-
products. In spite of these changes, however, no attempt has been
made to replace the existing ovens with those of a more modern
type. This has been due to a variety of factors : the shortage of
coal, which prevents the full utilisation of existing capacity; the
small financial strength of the companies concerned; the labour
problems associated with continuous operation; the inadequacies of
the transport system; and the ability of the small producers to sell
their coke profitably at present. For these reasons, the present
coke producers are unlikely to instal by-product recovery ovens.
Apart from this question, there is an urgent need for washing and
screening facilities even for the present ovens.
7. GOVERNMENT POLICIES.
(i) Price Control.
The price of hard coke was subject to control by the Com-
monwealth Prices Commissioner under the National Security
(Prices) Regulations until 20th September, 1948, when the Com-
monwealth Government vacated the field. Since that date the
price has been controlled by the respective State Governments,
In accordance with the price stabilisation policy laid down
in April 1943, when the prices of all goods and services were
pegged at the then existing levels, control has been operated in
such a way as to preserve the money margins per ton existing
at that date. Price increases have been permitted only when
necessitated by increased costs of production and distribution.
Price variations as between different producers and different
consumers are therefore based on price variations which existed
prior to April 1943, reflecting, on the one hand, concessions pre-
viously granted to particular consumers and, on the other, differ-
ences in the quality of coke produced at that time.
Generally speaking, the price of hard coke in New South
Wales ranges from £6 to £7/10/- per ton, plus freight In Vic-
toria, prices range from £lO to £lO/15/- per ton f.o.r. Victoria
Dock, depending on the port of loading.
The State Coke Works at Bowen sells coke to all consumers
other than to its principal customer, Mt, Isa Mines Ltd., at £5/4/7
per ton ex works.* In the case of Mt. Isa Mines Ltd., the price
of the coke is subject to the terms of a special long term contract.
(ii) Tariff.t
The level of customs duty imposed on imports of coke into
Australia is relatively low. It is charged at a rate of 3/- per ton
when imported from British Preferential countries, and at a
rate of 6/- per ton when imported from other sources.
* l n Queensland, where the major cokeworks is State owned, prices are
set in accordance with the Queensland Government’s policy of encourage-
ment to industry. Price quoted is as at 23rd May, 1951.
f The tariff duty rates mentioned herein are not to be regarded as a formal
statement of the rates which may be applicable in any specified case, but
as illustrative of the level of protection afforded to local manufacture. The
rates applicable in any specified case at any particular time may be
ascertained on application to the Department of Trade and Customs,


In addition, a primage duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem is charged
on hard coke imported from British Preferential countries and
10 per cent, ad valorem is charged on imports from other sources.
In view of the continued shortage of hard coke in this country,
the Comptroller-General of Customs has decided that foundry coke
may be imported duty free under tariff items 449(A)(1) and
449(A)(2), whichever is applicable. This decision operated on and
from Ist January 1951, and applies to foundry coke shipped on or
before 31st December 1951.
8. GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.
The seriousness of the shortage of hard coke in Australia has
in the past been masked to some extent by the shortage of pig
iron and foundry labour. The shortage of pig iron, of course, has
itself arisen largely because of the shortage of hard coke for steel-
works use. Both of these shortages reflect the inadequacy of black
coal supplies.
The minimum demand for hard coke for normal hard coke
usages other than the production of iron and steel is estimated at
about 226,500 tons in 1951-52. In addition there will be demands of
at least 30,000 tons arising from the shortage of soft coke.
Given steady improvement in coal supplies, the commercial
coke producers may produce 185,000 tons during the year 1951-52,
about 75,000 tons short of these requirements. Coke available
from other local and overseas sources of supply is unlikely to
exceed 30,000 tons, leaving an unsatisfied demand of about 45,000
tons.
The situation will become increasingly difficult, particularly
after the year 1953, unless additional coal is made available and
additional plant capacity is installed. The currently planned de-
velopment of steelworks coking capacity is not based on a policy
of regularly supplying outside users either now or in the future.
Demand will rise to at least 330,000 tons in 1955 (perhaps to 400,000
tons) or 120,000 tons (perhaps 190,000 tons) in excess of the
present installed capacity of the commercial producers.
An increase in capacity would, of course, be of little use with-
out an expanded supply of coal to the cokeworks. Any discussions
on hard coke supplies, therefore, must be related to the level of
coal production, which despite a present record rate is still
far below requirements. An improvement in New South Wales
transport is also essential before coal can be supplied at rates
much above the present to the cokeworks in that State.
There appear to be real prospects, however, of substantially
increasing the output of coking coal at Collinsville, Queensland.
Apart from the question of supplies of coal, the present com-
mercial producers are recovering from the limited coal available
considerably less coke than they would with modern by-product re-
covery ovens.


It is clear then that the outlook for coke supplies is extremely
serious and that action should be taken immediately to ensure that
additional supplies are made available as quickly as possible. The
following possible lines of action are suggested:—
1. Increased allocations of coal for the production of hard
coke are essential. On present allocations, the present
commercial producers cannot raise their production. Ad-
ditional supplies are also essential to supply any new
works which may be established.
2. Modernisation of the present New South Wales cokeworks
as far as possible to achieve a maximum output of high
quality coke is urgent and essential. This would involve
the installation of coal-washing and screening facilities
either by the individual producers, or by associations of
them, and the improvement of coal and coke storage facil-
ities at the cokeworks to ensure uninterrupted production.
New coking capacity cannot be installed and brought into
operation quickly and everything should be done, there-
fore, to use, present plants to the full,
3. The present Bowen plant should be modernised and opera-
ted more efficiently. Additional coke ovens should be in-
stalled in the Bowen-Collinsville area to supply southern
markets. There are prospects of obtaining adequate coal
supplies for this purpose from the mechanisation of the
State Coal Mine at Collinsville. It should also be kept in
mind that there may be a future development of an inte-
grated steelworks in this area and that new batteries of
coke ovens would fit in well with such a long-range plan,
4. The large coke-making facilities of the steelworks and
their established efficiency suggests that they should be
encouraged to instal cokemaking capacity in excess of
their requirements to become permanent suppliers of sub-
stantial quantities of coke to the commercial market as
and when adequate supplies of New South Wales coking-
coal become available.
Alternatively, one or more of the large users of coke
from the commercial producers could instal capacity
(possibly in Victoria or South Australia) capable of sup-
plying their own needs and leaving a surplus of coke for
the general market.
Both of these proposals are closely dependent on con-
siderable improvements in transport and on the provision
of increased supplies of coking coal.
5. New coke ovens installed in Australia should be of the
most modern type. The extent to which by-products can
be utilized in any particular case may determine whether
a full or partial by-product recovery plant is added. Even
where recovery units are not at present considered econ-
omic, the modern type of oven should be installed with
provision for the eventual addition of suitable recovery
plant as the market for by-products and gases develops.
