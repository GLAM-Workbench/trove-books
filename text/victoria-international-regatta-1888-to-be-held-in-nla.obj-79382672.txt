SAILING RULES.
Note.? Where in these Rules the word yacht occurs,
it shall refer to any yacht, boat, or sailing vessel
competing in the Regatta.
1. All Races, and all Yachts sailing therein, Management
shall be under the direction of the Sailing
Committee of the Regatta. All matters shall be
subject to their approval and control, and all
doubts, questions, and disputes which may arise
shall be subject to their decision. Their decisions
shall be based upon these Rules so far as they gecismi^of
will apply, but as no rules can be devised
capable of meeting every incident and accident
of sailing, the Sailing Committee should keep
in view the ordinary customs of the sea, and
discourage all attempts to win a Race by other
means than fair sailing and superior speed and
skill. The decisions of the Sailing Committee
shall be final. No member of the Sailing
Committee shall take part in the discussion or Memberg in .

owner, or any one of the crew of a competing
Yacht shall be considered to be interested in
the Race. The Sailing Committee, or any


officer appointed to take charge for the day,

any Yacht be disqualified, the next in order
shall be awarded the prize.
Completing A yacht shall have completed a race as soon
as any part of her hull or spars be on or across
the winning line.
Postponement 2. The Sailing Committee, or officer in charge
for the day, shall have power to postpone any
Race should unfavourable weather render such
a course desirable. Letter Nof the commercial
code hoisted over the flag denoting the Race
shall be the signal that a Race has been
postponed.
Measurement 3. The rating of every Yacht entered to sail
for rating. J ajT
in Races 1, JJL and/Q shall be ascertained by
multiplying the sail area in square feet (as
found in the manner hereafter enjoined) by the
length in feet on the load water-line, and
dividing the product by 0,000 ; the quotient
Fractions to shall be the rating, and any fraction of, or
vdth* excep- exceedin S ? ol > shall count as I*, except when
tions, the rating does not exceed 10 (see Rule 4). The
length shall be taken in a straight line from the
Definition of
length of load fore-end to the after-end of the load water-line,
hne. provided always that if any part of the stem,
or stern-post, or other part of the vessel below
the load water-line, project beyond the length


taken as mentioned, such projection or projec- Definition of

tions shall, for the purposes of the rule, be line
added to the length taken, as stated j and
pieces of any form cut out of the stem, stern-
post, or fair-line of the ridge of the counter,
with the intention of shortening the load water-
line, shall not be allowed for in measurement of
length, if at or immediately below the load-line,
nor above, if within 6 inches of the water
level.
The sail area shall be found by the Y.R.A. Sail Area,
rule, as shown on back of the form of entry for
these races, and all measurements supplied on
form of entry are subject to the check of the
official measurers.
In cases of disputed measurement, or if the Disputes as to
necessary measurements cannot be obtained for sail area
from the sailmaker, the sails can be measured
in the manner following Take the length of
boom from mast to pin of sheave for outhaul,
and length of gaff from mast to pin of topsail
sheet sheave or lacing-hole, as the case may
require ; then hoist the sail with the tack fast
and set the peak and luff up taut, and let go the
topping lifts so that the weight of the boom
comes on the leach of the sail. With a line
and tape measure the leach and luff and the
diagonal C. For the head sail measure the


height from the boom goose-neck to shoulder of
topmast, and the distance from fore side of mast
to cranse iron on bowsprit where cut by line
of topmast stay. For topsail the sail would be
hoisted and marked in a line with the gaff ? then
lowered and the other dimensions taken. From
the measurements so taken a sail plan would be
made and the areas calculated as described.
If, from any peculiarity in the construction
of a Yacht, or other cause, it shall be found by
the Sailing Committee that this rule will not
measure the Yacht fairly, the Sailing Com-
mittee, after making such inquiries as they
consider necessary, shall award a certificate of
rating accordingly.
In races for mixed rigs the rating of Schooners
and Yawls to be reckoned for time allowance as
follows, viz. :?Schooners at three-fifths, and
Yawls at four-fifths of their actual rating ; pro-
vided that in case of a Yawl her mainsail does
not exceed '37 of her total sail area, and that
her mizen is not less than 'O6 of her total sail
area. In the case of a pole-masted Yawl, her
mainsail shall not exceed ?46 of her total sail
area, and her mizen shall not be less than ?075
of her total sail area. In Schooners the foreside
of the mainmast shall at the deck be not
farther forward than the middle of length of the

to mark out the course, if two Yachts are not
clear of each other at the time the leading
Yacht is close to, and actually rounding the
mark, the outside Yacht must give the other
room to pass clear of it, whether it be the lee
or weather Yacht which is in danger of fouling


the mark. No Yacht shall be considered clear
of another Yacht unless so much ahead as to
give a free choice to the other on which side she
will pass. An overtaking Yacht shall not,
however, be justified in attempting to establish
an overlap, and thus force a passage between
the leading Yacht and the mark after the latter
Yacht has altered her helm for the purpose of
rounding.

or other obstruction to sea room, should Yachts
not be clear of each other, the outside Yacht or

that an overlap has been established before an
obstruction is actually reached.
19. A Yacht overtaking any other shall keep
out of the way of the overtaken Yacht ; and a
Yacht may luff as she pleases to prevent another
Yacht passing to windward, but must never
bear away out of her course to hinder the other

sidered that on which the leading Yacht of
the two carries her main boom. The overtaking
vessel, if to leeward, must not luff until she
has drawn clear ahead of the Yacht she has
overtaken.


20. If two Yachts are standing towards a Close-hauled
shore or shoal, or towards any buoy, boat, or shore. �
vessel, and the Yacht to leeward is likely to
run aground, or foul of such buoy, boat, or
vessel (a mark vessel excepted), and is not able
to tack without coming into collision with the
Yacht to windward, the latter shall at once
tack, on being hailed to do so by the owner of Hailing to go
the leeward Yacht, or the person acting as his
representative, who shall be bound to see that
his own vessel tacks at the same time.
21. Any Yacht running on shore, or foul of Running
a buoy, vessel, or other obstruction, may use �
her own anchors, boats, warps, &c., to get off,
but may not receive any assistance except from
the crew of the vessel fouled. Any anchor,
boat, or warp used must be taken on board
again before she continues the Race.

by another Yacht. Any Yacht causing a mark Causing a
vessel to in any way shift her position to avoid aMfUier & posY
being fouled by such Yacht shall be disqualified, tion.
If a Yacht, in consequence of her neglect of

or compel other Yachts to foul, she shall for-
feit all claim to the Prize, and shall pay all
damages.
