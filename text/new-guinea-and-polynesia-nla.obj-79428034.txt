of electricity to the purpose.
We had hoped to be able to give some account of the under-
ground and overhead system of the postal telegraph in London
and our great towns ; but the subject would require a paper to
itself, and our space is exhausted. We have not even room to
discuss the system by which daily meteorological observations
are transmitted from a hundred stations to the Royal Observatory
to be tabulated and arranged. For a similar reason we must
leave unnoticed the application of the electric light to the light-

and the system of time-signals daily transmitted from the Royal
Observatory to our naval arsenals and ports. We only enume-

THERE are few people with any imagination who have not
indulged in the refined pleasure of dreaming over a map.
N 2 " And


And to any remonstrance from the ? practical side of their
nature they would at once answer, that the main features of
their map being correct, it afforded a sure basis for valuable
speculation, geographical or otherwise, I hey would not expect
perfect accuracy of detail in remote and savage countries, but
they might fairly assume that all coast lines, except in Arctic
or Antarctic regions, had been long ere now correctly laid down.
It will be a surprise, then, to such persons, on looking at the
map of New Guinea attached to Captain Moresby?s book, to
find that the coast line of that great island, as laid down in our
Admiralty charts five years ago, was, for hundreds of miles, a
purely imaginary line, in one place running far inland over
lofty mountains, in another equally far out to seaward. It
seems not very creditable to a great maritime power to have
remained so long in ignorance of the very outline of a coast
within eighty miles of her own territories, and in the heart of a
region traversed in all directions by her commerce. We do not
undervalue the scientific results, or the human training, to be got
from an Arctic expedition, but if the latter should be done, the
former should certainly not have been left so long undone.
The first discovery of New Guinea is claimed both by the
Portuguese and the Spaniards. Don Jorge de Meneses, the
Portuguese Governor of Ternate, was, in 1526, driven by winds
and currents upon the coast of ? Papua, and remained there till
the change of the monsoon ; and two years later the Spanish
Captain Alvaro de Saavedra, returning eastward from the
Moluccas, ?cast anchor in a great gulf near certain islands,
presumably on the north coast, which he named Islas de Oro,
Then comes, perhaps, a more definite notice of the country
by the survivors, after mutiny and shipwreck, of Grijalva?s
company, who being rescued from slavery by the illustrious
Antonio Galvano, reported that ? the people of all these lands
are black, and have their hair frizzled, whom the people of
Maluco do call Papuas. There is here a bird as big as a crane :
he flieth not, nor hath any wings wherewith to fly; he runneth
on the ground like a deer; of their small feathers they do make
hair for their idols,? &c.
The difficulties in the way of geographical discovery in those
days were great. Positions were sometimes falsified to bring
them on the right side of the meridian which was to divide the
Spaniard from the Portuguese, Logs and charts were sup-
pressed, and discoveries concealed, lest they should fall into rival
hands, or afford shelter to the terrible Drake, who had now
rounded the Horn, and was on the track of his great enemy.
The habit, too, of ignoring the native names of places often
made


made identification impossible, when the observations of position
were inaccurate. Again, the theory of a great Terra Australis,
which behoved to balance in the south the accumulation of land
in high northern latitudes, was a great stumbling-block to the
early navigators. But truth is strangely greater than fiction,
and the real Australia vastly transcends in importance the old
explorer?s dream, of which geographically it is only a fragment.
All this helps to explain why the early navigators profited so
little by the work of those who went before them. The Dutch
voyager Keyts, for instance, whose account of New Guinea,
though dating from 1678, is still worth reading, says, ?it is be-
lieved that New Guinea is separated from New Holland in
about 10� S. lat. and yet Torres had sailed through the intri-
cate channel which bears his name three-quarters of a century
before. The fame of this exploit was posthumous indeed. His
voyage was performed in 1606, but it was not till 1762, when
Manilla was taken by the British, that his letter to the King
of Spain, describing his discovery, was found by Dalrymple,
who named the straits accordingly. The passage through them
was first surveyed by Cook in 1770.
The Dutch, who had entered on the inheritance of their
Portuguese rivals, were the chief explorers of the 17th century.
Besides the achievements of Tasman, and of the good ship
? Duyfken,? a classic name among the early navigators, we have
the long and daring voyage, by Magellan Straits to the north
coast of New Guinea, of the ? interlopers ? Lemaire and Schouten,
in 1616, whose vessel was confiscated by their jealous and ex-
clusive countrymen.
Towards the end of the 17th century, Dampier, perhaps the
greatest of English explorers before Cook, coming from the east-
wards, closed the land in about 148� E. (some two degrees further
down the coast than any who had preceded him), and coasted
thence westwards, laying down several points and islands. His
observations would have been more valuable had he been trained
in a humaner school, for his free use of fire-arms to ? scare ? the
savages who ? could not, or perhaps would not, understand ?
him, naturally shortened his intercourse with them.
In 1774 Thomas Forrest was sent by the East India Company
to discover whether spices were to be found on any of the
Moluccas or other islands to the east of the Dutch possessions.
He sailed (chiefly to escape the interference of the Dutch) in
the ?Tartar Galley,? a vessel of only ten tons and twenty-five
feet in length, and landing at Dorey on the north-west coast,
spent some time in friendly intercourse with the people.
The sum of our knowledge up to recent times may be said to
have


have been completed by D?Entrecasteaux, who, in 1793, sailed
within five leagues of the islands at the eastern extremity of
New Guinea, but keeping outside them, was unable to close the
coast farther east than 147�. On the south-west coasts impor-
tant observations were made in 1826 by the Dutch Lieutenant
Kolff, and towards the south-east valuable surveying work was
done in 1843-5 by Captain Blackwood in the 4 Fly,? and in
1849 by Captain Owen Stanley, in the 4 Rattlesnake.? The last
as well as the most important and extensive survey is that
of Captain Moresby, who carried a running survey along the
hitherto unknown part of the north coast from the eastern ex-
tremity of the island for 278 miles as the crow flies, to the point
where D?Entrecasteaux?s observations began, and ascertained its
actual eastern limits, though these were more than guessed at by
Dumont D?Urville thirty years before. Captain Moresby also
made a triangulated survey of this and of the adjacent islands,
including a surface of some 60 by 75 miles. This work, though
a good deal still remains to be done, was certainly the most
important piece of marine survey remaining uncompleted in any
part of the globe.
The name of 4 New Guinea ? was probably given to the island
by Ortez de Retes, in 1546, from the resemblance of the inha-
bitants to those of the Guinea coast. The modern name
4 Papua,? perhaps derived from the Malay word pua-pua ,
4 frizzled,? in allusion to the hair of the inhabitants, is applied
by their Malay and other neighbours not only to New Guinea,
but to several of the adjacent islands. The natives themselves,
differing in race and language, could hardly have a common
name for their country, of whose extent, besides, they are entirely
ignorant. Various great districts are known to the natives, and
to the traders who frequent the coast, by special names, and local
terms meaning 4 big land,? are used here and there.*
New Guinea is in close geological connection with Australia.
The shallow waters which separate their shores, and extend some
distance beyond them to the westward, cover an area which in
recent tertiary times must have been dry land. The two
countries are, in fact, almost united by outliers of the great
barrier reef which for more than 1200 miles runs along the
north-east coast of Australia. The waters of Torres Straits,
* Mr. Gill says the people of Torres Straits call New Guinea ? Little Daudai/
and Australia ? Great Daudai; ? but the Eev. W. Ridley, in his work on the
?Languages of Australia,? says that the people of Cape York, comparing their
narrow peninsula with the great mountain ranges of New Guinea, call the latter
? great ? and Australia ? little Daudai.? Daudai is, perhaps, a variation of ? towrai,?
country.
besides


besides being encumbered with reefs and shoals, are studded
with islands, many of them, especially towards the west, of
igneous origin, while others are simply upheaved, the strata
every way from the centre seawards. In short, although
-80 miles in width, the straits afford but two channels available
for navigation.
Few travellers have as yet penetrated the country for any
distance, and a great part of the interior is still unknown, and
consequently undescribed, except by Captain Lawson, whose
? Wanderings,? even viewed as a work of fiction, hardly merited
the attention they received in some quarters. Fortunately, the
few modern travellers whose observations are available are men
of more than ordinary intelligence. They represent nearly
every country in Europe. Among others, Italy sends two natu-
ralists, Signori D?Albertis and Beccari; Russia, Dr. Miklukho
Maklay ; Germany, the learned Dr. A. B. Meyer; Holland,
Mr. Von Rosenberg. Among our own countrymen, Mr. A. R.
Wallace, the distinguished naturalist, resided for some time on
the coast; and much information has been supplied more recently
hy Captain Moresby, Mr. Octavius Stone, and by the Rev. S. Mac-
farlane; also by the Rev. W. Gill, the author of some excellent
papers. But few of these gentlemen have written at any length,
-and we Have only scattered records of their doings. A series ot
these have appeared in 1 Cosmos,? a journal which, in the hands
-of Signor Guido Cora, stands in the first rank as a geographical
?authority. England, however, ought in these matters to be nulli
secundus , not even to the veteran ?Petermann?; and we hope to
see our own i Geographical Magazine ? take this place under
the management of its present accomplished editor.
We need hardly, perhaps, apologise if we now take a rapid
survey of shores so little known, dipping here and there into
the mysterious interior. Our voyage must be a rapid one, for
the island is 1400 miles in length, or, in other words, extends as
far as from the coast of Brittany to the mouths of the Danube,
while its maximum width is equal to that of France. The
southern coast from its eastern extremity to Redscar Head, a
point on the east side of the great Gulf of Papua, is protected
by a series of reefs, forming several land-locked harbours, to
which, however, the access, through openings in the reefs, is not
always simple. To the westward of Redscar Head the coral
reefs cease, and the character of the country entirely changes;
the coast becoming low, flat, and swampy, and the sea so shallow
that a vessel cannot approach within several miles of the land.
Dense forests of tall mangroves fringe the shore, which for
many miles inland is only a few feet above the surface of the
water,


water, and is, in fact, a vast delta, half submerged, and inter-
sected by numerous and wide channels. These bring down great
volumes of fresh water, which extends at low tide many miles to
seaward, and might be taken for large navigable rivers, affording
an easy road into the interior. Most of the rivers hitherto explored
diminish rapidly landwards, their channels, even when otherwise
navigable by boats, being found choked by fallen trees and other
obstacles. Captain Moresby was disposed to think that all the-
rivers will prove to have this character, or to be mere tidal
creeks ; but the Fly River, on the west side of the Gulf of Papua,
is certainly an exception, for Signor D?Albertis has recently, in
a steam-launch provided for him at Sydney, ascended this river
to a point 500 miles from its mouth, and nearly half that distance
in a straight line from the sea. For, the last seventy miles he
was beyond the swampy plains of the coast region, in an undu-
lating country, with mountains in sight to the N.W. Here
his further progress was checked by the character of the stream,,
which had become too shallow, except after rains, and the current
was then too strong to admit of steaming. That this is the true
road to the interior was suggested thirty years ago by Mr. Jukes,
the narrator of the voyage of the ? Fly,? who felt sure that some
large river must flow between the great mountain ranges which
run parallel to the length of the island. Captain Evans, the
Hydrographer of the Navy, who himself served in the ? Fly,? has
always advocated this view, and must be gratified by its realisa-
tion. The mangrove swamps and shallow waters extend hence
along the coast westwards, for hundreds of miles, while all traces
of mountains disappear until opposite the Aru Islands, where
again a lofty range comes in sight, not less than 16,000 feet,
high, and, according to some observers, capped with snow.
The Aru Islands, about 150 miles from New Guinea, lie on
the western limits of the surrounding shallow sea, and a proof
of the depression of this area was noticed here by that acute
observer, Mr. Wallace. He remarked that these islands are
traversed by winding channels?the courses, no doubt, of former
rivers which must have had their source in the lofty mountains
on the opposite mainland of New Guinea, and flowed in this,
direction over the district now submerged. From this point
westwards high mountains are always in sight, and the N.W-
peninsula, or Papua Onim, which is almost severed from the
island by the deep inlet of MacCluer Gulf, is for the most part
of a mountainous character. This peninsula, and especially
the district about Geelvink Bay on the north coast, is one of
the very few parts where the interior is at all well known. Von
Rosenberg?s work contains a good deal of information about
this..


this region, which, with the large adjacent islands, has also
been partially explored by Meyer, Beccari and other travellers.
The mountains, which are mostly clothed with forests to a
height of several thousand feet, are chiefly of granite and mica-
schist, flanked by limestone strata; in the inner ranges, judg-
ing from the pebbles in the torrents, the rocks are volcanic.
The general appearance of the northern coast differs greatly
from that of the southern. This may be partly due to the belt
of volcanic action which extends parallel to this coast and
at no great distance from it. The mountains generally rise
abruptly from the sea, but sometimes a narrow beach or plain of
moderate extent intervenes. Few harbours are to be found, and
the depth of the water close in-shore makes anchorage difficulty
Towards the eastern extremity of the island a series of wide
bays extends, the hills rising, range upon range, towards the
interior, save where some loftier chain at once intercepts the
view; while groups of islands, with more than one active
volcano, fringe the shore. The existence of great rivers on this
side of the island is attested by vast floating masses of
met with far out to sea.
Of the whole island, the part most likely to become of interest
to ourselves is the southern coast from the Gulf of Papua to.
its eastern extremity. The country around Redscar Bay and
Port Moresby, on the eastern side of the Gulf, has been ex-
plored by the English and Polynesian missionaries settled there,,
whose reports do not bear out the expectations formed of its
resources. The soil seems generally poor. Low, rounded, grassy
hills, with higher ranges behind them, sparsely timbered with
Eucalyptus, Pandanus, and other vegetation of an Australian
type, rise from the white coral beach. In the valleys, however,
and further inland, the vegetation is of a more tropical luxu-
riance. The hills are of a recent limestone formation, strewn with
fragments of red flint, and of a non-auriferous quartz, and shells,
of existing species were found by Mr. Stone at a height of 600 feeh
From the higher ridges a grand view is obtained of endless ranges,
of mountains clothed with dense jungle and high forest trees,
above which tower the great volcanic peaks ol Mount Owen.
Stanley, 13,200 feet in height. The whole of the coast eastward
from Port Moresby has recently been visited by Mr. Macfarlane.,
Steaming down between the barrier-reef and the shore, in
waters hitherto unknown, he discovered two valuable harbours,
besides many safe anchorages, and two rivers, by which the
hill country, a few miles inland, may be reached. The country
eastwards becomes much more fertile and more varied in cha-
racter. It is highly cultivated ; carefully-tended flower-beds.
were


were actually seen in the gardens; and the numerous popula-
tion is in many places a fine healthy race, friendly and eager to
trade.
The islands at the extremity of the peninsula, with the ad-
jacent mainland, have been glowingly described by Captain
Moresby. With no affectation of literary art, he yet brings
before us the transparent coral sea with its glittering beach,
dotted with the picturesque huts of the natives, and backed
by hills and mountain ranges of every form, clothed with
luxuriant forest or breezy downs (on which, however, the grass
proved to be twelve feet high), or terraced with careful cul-
tivation. In truth, his powers of descxlption are very con-
siderable. We see the boat anchored in the river for the
night in the heart of the forest, with the ? extemporised penny
readings ? and the songs, the torments from mosquitoes almost
driving the men into the water among the crocodiles; and then
daylight comes, and ? the usual morning prayers,? and to work
again. The intercourse with the natives is often amusing,
sometimes critical; but everything goes well, thanks partly per-
haps to ? luck,? but mainly to the wise precautions and fine
temper of the commander, and to the good humour and admir-
able discipline of the crew, imbued with a portion of his own
spirit. We venture to think he is sanguine in supposing that,
because he found a clear passage northwards between the islands,
he has necessarily discovered the best route between Australia
and China. Even the part surveyed by him is more intricate
than either of the routes now in use, and, as Captain Evans has
pointed out, many unknown impediments may exist in the un-
surveyed waters to the northward. Besides, the atmospheric
conditions of the area to the north of New Guinea are imper-
fectly known. It is not improbably a region of calms, the
trade-wind and monsoon being intercepted or deflected by the
high lands on either side. It may be doubtful whether such
drawbacks do not more than outweigh the alleged gain of 300
miles in a voyage of 5000.
We may here enter a pi'otest against the system pursued by
many discoverers of ignoring the native names of localities.
The memory of a discoverer should always be perpetuated, but
it is unnecessary, if not confusing, to find a harbour, a strait,
?and an island, in different parts of New Guinea, all bearing the
name of Moresby. A bay or headland may often be nameless,
but rivers, mountains, and inhabited islands have their native
names. Many of those in New Guinea are already known, and
though Captain Moresby may be inclined to do battle for the
bevy of Ediths, and Janes, and Hildas, and Ethels, who adorn
his


liis map, we hope their darker rivals will be exclusively adopted
by future geographers. Dr, Meinicke gives everywhere the
names applied either by the natives themselves, or by their
Moluccan and other neighbours, to the various districts, as
well as to the natural features of the island. His work, under
the modest title, ? Eine geographische Monographic,? contains
not only a minute geographical description, but a compendium
of information about the inhabitants of the various groups ot
islands in the Pacific, with an introductory chapter on Ethnology
and other matters, to which his life-long study ot the subject
gives much value.
The fauna of New Guinea is classified by Mr. Wallace * as a
subdivision of the Australian. It extends to the immediately
adjacent islands, and, with certain modifications, as far as the
Moluccas on the west, and the Solomon Islands on the east.
Its close resemblance, both positive and negative, to that oi
Australia, viewed in connection with the great dissimilarity of
the climate of the two countries, is another proof that the inter-
vening tract has been but recently submerged. It differs from
that of the islands further to the westward, the respective limits
of the two fauna coinciding remarkably with the deep sea channel
which separates the two x?egions, whose depth suggests that
they were severed at a comparatively remote period. The New
Guinea, or, as Mr. Wallace styles it, the 4 Austro-Malayan
fauna, is remarkable for the absence of any mammalia larger
than the pig and the dog, and even these may have been intro-
duced by the earlier immigrants. As to the rhinoceros of
Captain Moresby, and the buffaloes of Mr. Stone, we do not like
to dogmatise, but we fear we must relegate them, provisionally,
to the company of the terrible 4 moolla? of Captain Lawson. The
dendrolagus, a tree kangaroo peculiar to the island, is a curious
partial adaptation of that animal to the necessities of a forest
life. In striking contrast to the poverty of the mammalia, are
the variety and splendour of the birds. These are pre-eminently
of a type of their own, with, as might be expected, an infusion
?of a western Malay element. Among the most characteristic are
the splendid group of birds-of-paradise,t found only in New
Guinea and in some of the nearest islands, the megapodidae, or
mound builders, and the cassowai?ies. The x?ichness and speciali-
sation of the pigeons, parrots, and kingfishers, are remarkable, as
is the absence of finches, woodpeckers, vultures, and pheasants.
* 4 Geographical Distribution of Animals,? i. 409.
t It is to be hoped that Mr. Wallace?s forebodings as to the probable dis-
appearance of these beautiful birds may not be realised, but they are eagerly
hunted down, their skins fetching, on the spot , from 10s. to 20s.
Mr.


Mr. Wallace found that the proportion of ? beautiful ? birds was
50 per cent, of the whole, the same as in the Amazon region,
while the proportion in the Moluccas was only one-third. This
is due, he says, in New Guinea, mainly to the number of
parrots, lories, cockatoos, pigeons, and kingfishers ; and to the
absence of thrushes, shrikes, warblers, and other dull-coloured
groups. The character of the reptilia, as far as we know, is
partly Australian, partly of a western origin ; many of the snakes
especially, which are easily transported on floating timber, or
even by canoes, being of the latter type.
The flora is mainly that of the Indian Archipelago ; and
though there is a certain infusion of the Australian element;
the former predominates even in the islands of Torres Straits.
On the more barren and open country to the east of the Gulf
of Papua, Australian vegetation is represented by varieties of
Eucalyptus, Acacia, and Pandanus; and even as far as Hum-
boldt?s Bay, on the north coast, plants of Australian type are
found, A striking feature of the forest vegetation is the
enormous height of the trees, though the species are fewer
than in the large islands of the Archipelago. Its great density
often makes the herbaceous vegetation poor; ferns, grasses,
orchids, and aroids perhaps predominate; then Myrtaceae, aloes,
Urticeae, Lorantheae, and Apocyneae, Tobacco is indigenous in,
the interior, and tradition ascribes to it an illustrious antiquity,
the seeds of the first plant being the miraculous fruit of a
woman named Heva. The sugar-cane grows luxuriantly, the
edible part, Dr. Maklay says, being 14 feet high. Many kinds
of Ficus are abundant, and several new kinds of palm are
found. The sago-palm, if not indigenous, must have been early
introduced. It grows freely in a wild state, and even in cultiva-
tion requires little care. It matures in twelve to fifteen years,
and produces from 2 to 4 cwt. of flour ;* a sort of biscuit made
from this lasts for years, while the branches make a better thatch
than those of other palms. The nutmeg seems indigenous, and
the Massoi bark, a very old article of export to China, is supplied
by one of the Laurineae. Among the principal fruits and vege-
tables in use, but which are said not to be truly indigenous,
are the cocoa-nut, the banana, the durian, and the breadfruit;
the Macropiper methysticum, from whose root the intoxicating*
? kava,? the national drink of the Pacific, is made; the yam, the
taro ( Arum esculentum ), the sweet potato, and the melon, A fine
variety of jute grows wild, and other valuable fibres are in use.
Of the mineral productions of the country little is known. They

may


may be numerous, for the geological formations seem to be of
various ages. On the south-east coast, Mr. Stone observed a
vein of plumbago two miles in length ; and Captain Moresby
?a fine steel sand. His reported discovery of gold in this quarter
has not been authenticated, but it is said that there are gold
washings in the streams of Papua Onim, and a tertiary coal
?of inferior quality in the island of Lakahia, off the south-west
coast; and there are also traces of this in the islets of Galevo
Straits.
The climate of New Guinea is, according to the general
verdict, very unhealthy, though Beccari and Yon Rosenberg
consider this accusation too indiscriminate. The mortality,
chiefly from fever and ague, among the native missionaries on
the south coast, has been enormous. The explorers of the Fly
River all suffered from dropsy, and even in vessels off the
coast, with every precaution taken, fever is common, slight
sores or injuries do not heal, and the vital energies are greatly
depressed. The plateaux of the interior may have a healthier
climate, but in the dry, rocky hill-country about Redscar Bay,
little improvement is found. There must be a heavy rainfall,
extending over a great part of the year. Von Rosenberg says
that at Dorey rain fell on 130 days in the first six months
of 1869, and the amount of vapour in the atmosphere is said
to moderate the temperature. The action of the monsoons,
deflected by the high land, is irregular. The north-west
monsoon discharges its moisture chiefly at the western end of
the island, and the south-east trade wind, intensified into a
monsoon by the radiation from the land and confinement be-
tween the shores of Torres Straits, on the eastern and southern
ranges. The transition between the monsoons is long and
irregular, and these are the most unhealthy seasons of the year.
On the other hand, at Somerset, on the extreme northern point
of Australia, the climate, though of course tropical, is fairly
good ; there is no fever, and the heat is tempered by constant
light breezes. Even the climate of Torres Straits is not un-
healthy, although it is much hotter, and the extent to which
the atmosphere is impregnated with salt renders it trying to
many.*
New Guinea may be called the stronghold of the black Papuan
race, which also forms the bulk of the population in the chain of
great islands extending eastward as far as, and including, Fiji.
To the westward they are found in gradually decreasing numbers
in the islands of the Malay Archipelago as far as Flores (usually

1868.


in the more inaccessible parts), while among their kindred
may be classed the Negritos of the Philippines, the Andaman
Islanders, and certain tribes in the highlands of Sumatra, in
Java, and in the peninsula of Malacca. At the eastern end of
New Guinea, however, the coast for some 150 miles, and the
interior for a further unknown distance westward, are occupied
by a people of very different appearance, an offset, it is thought*
of the fair Polynesian race which inhabits all the other islands
of the Pacific.
The origin of these two races, and their relation to each other
and to the Malays proper, have been the subject of much specu-
lation. Among each we find many divergencies both of physi-
cal type and of manners and customs. But too much stress has
sometimes been laid on these, and sufficient consideration has
not always been given to the powerful effect, acting through
long ages, of varieties of climate and of food, and the different
habits which these engender ; of isolation and interbreeding ; of
the degree of civilisation possessed by a migrating tribe, and the
means, or absence of means, of maintaining it in the new domi-
cile. And to these may be added the great facility for distant
migrations, voluntary or involuntary, among island communities.
The majority of eminent writers on the subject have main-
tained that there is a great ? Malayo-Polynesian ? race, of Asiatic
origin, and comprising, as the name implies, the Malays of the
Indian Archipelago, and all the fair Polynesian tribes of the
Pacific; and further, that these two branches of the race are
sharply separated, as by a wedge, by the dark races of Australia*
New Guinea, and the adjacent islands. But later investigations
have somewhat complicated the question. The relationship of
the Malays and Polynesians is disputed by no less an authority
than Mr. Wallace. He gives an exhaustive description, as
from long residence among them he is so well fitted to do, of
the appearance, character, and habits of the Malays, and?having
first assumed that the Polynesians and Papuans are nearly
related to each other?points out the great difference between
these and the Malays. The Rev. S. Whitmee, however, writing*
from a long acquaintance with the Polynesians, applies to them*
seriatim , every part of Mr. Wallace?s description of the Malays,
and argues with much force that the resemblances are so great

communities,


communities, destitute for the most part of iron and other metals,
as well as of cattle, and nearly all the domestic animals. The
peoples of the Indian Archipelago, on the other hand, have been
in a position to profit by the growing civilisation of Asia, and
perhaps by Phoenician and other influences from the more distant
west. Mr. Wallace contrasts the tendency of the Polynesian to
dwindle away the European with the greater toughness,
in this respect, of the Malay; but the latter was gradually
hardened and prepared to stand the contact with Europeans bv
centuries of intercourse with the higher races of Asia. He admits-
the large infusion of Malayan words in the Polynesian language,
and (probably) of Malayan blood in the race, but denies that
the former is due to the latter. Whatever the structural differ-
ences between the two languages, the onus probandi here would
seem to lie with Mr. Wallace. Dr. Meinicke remarks, as a
curious proof of the relationship between them, that while the
Micronesian branch of the Polynesian race resembles the
Northern Malays of the neighbouring Philippines, the Southern
Polynesians resemble rather the Southern or main branch of the
Malay race.
The differences observable between the New Guinea Papuan
and the Australian may be due, in part, to the deterioration of the
latter, who is also, perhaps, a purer specimen of a primitive black
race, sent, in the expressive phrase of Professor Rolleston, ? to air
the world.? But the nearest affinity of the Australian seems to
be with the Dravidian races of Southern India, and the languages
of this section of mankind indicate rather a northern than a
tropical origin. The Papuan forms of speech, on the other
hand, are clearly, according to Dr. Bleek,* allied to those of the
tropical negro races of Africa, and he finds traces of the same
connection in the languages of Polynesia. The presumption
from this would be that the Papuan race once extended much
farther eastward than at present, and that a Papuan element still
forms the base both of the language and of the population of
Polynesia. It is dangerous to lay much stress on the argument
from language, when we know nothing of the circumstances
under which contact with other races may have taken place,
but physiologists also trace a negroid element far east in the
Pacific, and Mr. Wallace distinctly holds the Polynesians to be
merely a transitional, though well-established variety of the
Papuan race. The outward resemblance of the Papuan to the
African negro was long ago remarked, and the linguistic evidence
of a connection between them justifies those who have always

maintained


maintained this relationship, whether the intercourse lay by
way of India or by a now submerged ? Lemuria.?
It was at one time generally believed that not only in New
Guinea, but in all the larger islands of the Indian Archipelago,
the savage population of the interior was of a distinct race from
that of the coast, and they were known as ? Alfuros.? * This
apparent difference of race may generally be referred to the
very different conditions of their existence ; during Dr. Beccari?s
last journey in New Guinea, however, he found in the remoter
districts in the north of the island a perfectly black race, with
short woolly hair, prominent brows, the root of the nose much
depressed, a wide chest, and protuberant, pendulous belly. Some
of the features of this degraded type suggest a connection with
Australia, but rather, perhaps, with the Aetas of the Philippine
Islands, a savage negrito people who live scattered among the
Malay population, and in general habits resemble the Papuan.
Their origin is a question of much interest. They are, so far
as is known, unlike the African negro, usually brachycephalic;
whereas, Dr. Beccari says, ?the more the Papuan approaches
the negro type, the more decidedly is he dolichocephalic.? But
the form of the skull, taken alone, is not an unfailing test of race,
and Dr. Beccari has found examples of the short, round head also
among the New Guinea ? negroes.? It has been suggested that
the Philippine negrito may have been modified in this direction
by admixture with a brachycephalic ? Mongol ? type from the
neighbouring continent; but this brachycephalism seems to be
generally characteristic of the Oriental negroid type wherever
its remnants are found, from India to Japan.|
Considering the vast interval of time and distance which
must separate the ? Oceanic negro ? from his African brother,
he has many striking points of resemblance, both as to physical
appearance and temperament, with that well-known personage.
He shows the artistic tastes which characterise even the de-
graded Bushman. He has the grin and hearty laugh of the
African, and, though fierce and cruel, is capable of improve-
ment by discipline. Many of his customs, too, are identical
with those of Eastern Africa: such as the various elaborate
ways of dressing and of dyeing the hair; the boring of the
septum of the nose, and filing of the teeth; the raised cicatrices
* This name, which also occurs in the ? Harafura ? Sea, to the north-west of
Australia, has been the subject of much speculation. Mr. Windsor Earl traces it
in the Portuguese word Alforria , ? enfranchisement,? pointing to the fact that these
mountain people were habitually used as slaves by their more civilised neighbours.
tlt may be added that Signor D?Albertis reports the fairer?and, as he considers,
superior?race on the upper waters of the Fly river to be of a dolichocephalic, and
the darker ? Papuans ? at the mouth of the river of a brachycephalic type.
which


which take the place of the tattooing of fairer races; the belief
in sorcery, omens and witchcraft; the extracting of diseases in
the forms of animals, pieces of wood, &c.; and the various
practices?also found in Australia?for testing the courage of
their youths. The peculiar appearance of the Papuan hair (the
long separate spiral curls trained into a huge mop) has long
been remarked, and was supposed?we believe erroneously?to
be due to irregular aggregations of the follicles ; and it is curious
that Marion in the seventeenth century, and Bligh after him,
noticed the same in Tasmania, where the natives, if allied to the
Australian race, had also a large infusion of ? Papuan ? blood,
received probably from New Caledonia; and they are said to
have strongly resembled the Andaman islanders. Mr. Wallace
seems inclined to think the ? mop ? head is a sign of a mixed
race; it is seen among the half-negro tribes who frequent
Aden ; and a close resemblance to the Papuan ? mop ? is de-
scribed and pictured by Prichard* as belonging to the Cabusos
of Brazil, who are a cross between the native American and the
African negro. The race is clearly a very mixed one. Dr.
Muller f observed not only many shades of colour, but various
lorms ol skull and of features, recalling the Malay, the European,
and the negro; often too the high, hooked nose, and strongly
Jewish cast of features, remarked by many observers, and which
is the typical form seen in their ? karwars,? or ancestral images.
We may at all events assume with Dr. Beccari that upon the
negro element in the Papuan has been engrafted another, con-
necting him, like the Australian, more immediately with Asia.
Indeed, he detects in the Papuan of northern New Guinea a
large infusion of Indian blood, due to an immigration many
ages anterior to the Hindoo occupation of Java and the neigh-
bouring islands. It travelled, he thinks, by the Moluccas, where
he traces it in various names, customs, and traditions. This
bears curiously on a theory recently revived that this district
was the starting-point of a great Polynesian migration. Mr.
J. R. Logan | twenty-five years ago argued from the identity of
many names in the islands of Timor and Ceram with those of
Polynesia, that at least one wave of emigration issued from the
island of Halmahera or Gilolo, carrying thence the name of
Sawaii (meaning ?little Java?), which reappears in that or the
allied forms of Hawaii or Hawaiki, in the Samoan Islands, the
Sandwich Islands, and New Zealand. It is certainly more

satisfactory to believe that the population, as well as the ancient
civilisation of Polynesia, followed this route, than to believe, as
some would have us do, that the Sanskrit language?and there-
fore, we suppose, the Aryan nations?had their origin on the now
submerged Pacific continent, and this conclusion is strengthened
by the probable derivation also from Asia of the early inhabi-
tants of Western America.
The general belief in a broad distinction between the Papuan
and the Polynesian does not practically differ much from Mr.
Wallace?s view that they are varieties of the same race, with a
large infusion in either case of a foreign element, and at a very
different stage of culture. They certainly differ very markedly
both in physiognomy and in character ; and at the various points
where they are in contact, as in the New Hebrides, they are in
fierce hostility to each other.* At the same time there are many
striking points of resemblance, and even the differences are often
more suggestive of very unequal degrees of civilisation than of
true race distinctions. The remarkable sameness in the dialects
of the Polynesian language, in islands scattered over a vast area,
compared with the great number and diversity of languages
among the Papuans ?amounting, it is said, to one for every five
thousand people ?only shows a higher state of civilisation. The
hospitality of the Polynesian, contrasted with the barbarous treat-
ment of strangers by the Papuan, proves no more ; we ourselves
are not removed by many ages from the Cornish wrecker, and
the ? rude Carinthian boor.? The Papuan is usually devoid of
the instinct of shame; on the other hand, his women are more
modest than the Polynesian, to whom in their natural state this
sentiment, as a virtue, is hardly known. The skilful navigation
of the Polynesians, and their fondness for the sea, is often
quoted as distinguishing them from the Papuans, and it has
even been remarked that the Papuan race is only found in those
islands which can easily be reached from Asia by timid sailors;
and yet the Fijians and the Papuan inhabitants of the Kei
islands are alike famous among their non-Papuan neighbours
as boat-builders.
The practice of cannibalism, though more prevalent?indeed
almost universal?among the Papuans, has not been uncommon
among the Polynesians. It seems usually to retain traces of a
religious origin, even when indulged, as in Fiji, from mere pre-
ference ; on the other hand, it has sometimes been unknown, even
where, as in the Sandwich Islands, the practice of human sacrifice

has


has been most extensive. It has sometimes originated, as pro-
bably in New Zealand, in the scarcity of food ; but to main-
tain, as Dr. Foley does (i. 196), that it was the universal practice
among the early races of Europe before the introduction of cattle,
is, to say the least, a great exaggeration. It is often practised as
a sign of triumph over an enemy, and sometimes, in Australia,
out of respect to a near relative ; but accusations of cannibalism
have often been founded on the practice of cooking the head of
an enemy, or preparing the body of a friend, merely to preserve
them. The political and social organisation of the Polynesian
is far in advance of the Papuan, and strongly suggests an Asiatic
source, and the practice of circumcision, which is confined
generally to the Polynesians, and to a few of the Papuans within
their influence, is a striking mark of difference. The great Poly-
nesian institution of ? tabu ? is found among the other race, and
they have, besides, many customs in common which coincide re-
markably with those of various tribes in India, Assam, and Bur-
mah. The head-hunting of the Papuan finds a parallel among the
Dyaks of the Archipelago and the Kukis of the Burmese frontier.
Like the Mishmis of North-eastern India, who sacrifice to
the spirits of the mountain and the forest, the Papuan dreads
the Narwoje?a sort of Erl-Konig who lives in the clouds above
the trees, and carries off children?and other spirits of the
forest and of the rocks in the sea ; and, like the Nagas of Assam,
he is a slave to omens and to signs.* In artistic and poetic
taste, and generally in mental activity, the Papuan is perhaps
the more advanced of the two ?in New Guinea, indeed, he is
often far from being an absolute savage. The Torres Straits
islanders now work readily for the pearl-shell fishers, and are
much liked by their employers. On the western coast they have
for centuries held intercourse with Malay and other traders,! an( l
Mohammedan teachers have had some influence. In some of the
neighbouring Kei and Am islands, there are orderly Christian
communities under Dutch or native missionaries. The island
of Salvatti is governed by a Malay rajah, whose troops are en-
listed from the adjacent coasts of New Guinea. His slaves,
as well as those of other rajahs in the neighbouring islands,
* Mr. Windsor Earl (?Journal of the Indian Archipelago,? vol. iv.) quotes
in proof of the Asiatic origin of the Servatti islanders, the use of elephants? tusks
(the animal being unknown to them) at their funeral rites, a practice perhaps
answering to the sacrifice of a tusker on similar occasions by some Assam tribes.
And both preserve their dead in the same way, i.e. by exposing them till the body
ceases to be offensive.

are habitually kidnapped on the south-west coast, which, coupled :
with the tyrannous exactions of their suzerain, the Sultan of
Tidore, may partly explain the ? irreclaimable ferocity ? shown
to foreigners attempting to land.* In all that concerns agri-
culture the Papuans of New Guinea are often on a level with
the Polynesians. They have the same sense of rights in the'
soil, even the more savage tribes who live on the produce of the
wild sago-palm having the forest strictly partitioned among
them. Each village cultivates a portion of the land around it ;
the hillsides are terraced often to the height of many hundred
feet, and the low-lying gardens are carefully drained and
fenced.
In some villages on the south-east coast, part of the population
are fishermen and the rest cultivate the soil, interchanging their
produce, but neither interfering with the labour of the other ; and
there is a certain amount of trade with the interior in vegetable
produce, shells, &c., and also coastwise, carried in canoes. The-
ancestors of the Papuan may have brought the traditions of agri-
culture from Asia, or they may have got them from some early
Polynesian migration, but its original source may be deduced
from the fact that nearly all the fruits and vegetables cultivated
are indigenous to Asia, and?not to the Pacific.
From the Russian traveller Miklukho Maklay, who spent fif-
teen months at Astrolabe Bay, on a hitherto unknown part of the
northern coast, we learn some curious particulars of Papuan
life. He writes enthusiastically of their simple and amiable
ways, and declares that they improve on acquaintance. He-
has named the islands in the bay the ?Archipelago of the
Contented/ and in short has restored (for himself) the ideal of
the noble savage, so sadly at a discount in these prosaic days.
But we fail to see any poetry in the daily life of a Papuan,
gentleman. He rises early, and shivers in his scanty covering
till sunrise. He then ?lingers late over his breakfast and
cigar/ and?what is more difficult to understand?over his-
toilette; in short, he kills time somehow till evening, when his
womenkind return weary from their day?s work in his planta-
tion. His dinner consists chiefly of vegetables, varied on occa-
sions by the flesh of the dog and the pig, with fish, lizards,
beetles, and every kind of insect; a third part of sea-water
being added to the pot au feu in place of salt. Being an
epicure, he usually cooks the dinner himself, and after serving
out the worst morsels to his wife and children, eats the re-

mainder


mainder with his male friends apart. The women, we are told,
though they do all the hard work, and are altogether on a lower
footing than among the fairer race, are not badly treated. They
are carefully instructed in the art of waggling the body from
the hips in walking, and especially practise it when men are
present: ? one touch of Nature makes the whole world kin.?
The children are petted, chiefly by the father, who carves toys
for them?not a common trait among savages. They begin
early to take part in the day?s work, and it is a common sight
to see a little fellow of four years old occupying himself with
household matters, and running, when his mother comes in, to
take the breast. Owing to this late nursing, and the hard life
led by the women, the families are very small.
Two types of houses are found ; one is a large barn-like
erection, sometimes 500 feet long, containing several families.
It has a wide verandah on which they spend much of their time,
and is decorated with carvings and other ornamentation, and with
the skulls of enemies and other trophies. This type of house is
found in Borneo, and also among the Mishmis ol India. Other
houses are built in the Malay fashion, on piles, over the water
when on the coast, but also, in the interior, on dry ground,
while some are built in trees, as much as 60 feet from the
ground. The villages in the Eastern peninsula are well laid
out, and the street is kept scrupulously clean, as is the case, how-
ever, also among the savage Solomon islanders. The wooden
houses are substantially built, sometimes with two stories, the
roof in the form of an inverted boat, made of the leaves of the
Nipa palm, surmounted by a baldacchino; they are painted
and decorated with drawings of animals, and hung around
with weapons, and the teeth of crocodiles and boars. A fire is
lighted below the sleeping-places, as a protection against damp,
and the smoke keeps off the mosquitoes. The marea, or public
building for ceremonies and reception of guests, is found
here as in the Pacific ; no women or mourners are allowed to
enter it.
The use of the betel-nut is confined chiefly, but not exclusively,
to the fair race, as that of tobacco is to the dark. The natives
whom Torres in 1606 described as ?blowing lime from a pipe
to blind their enemies,? and those whom Cook saw ? throwing
something out from a short stick which burned like gunpowder,?
were, Mr. Gill thinks, only smoking tobacco ; but Lieut. Modera
says it is a mixture of lime, ashes, and wood, and used for sig-
nalling purposes.
It is curious how little intercourse exists even between neigh-
bouring


bouring tribes. Captain Moresby tells us that the use of the
bow and arrow, which is general to the westward, ceases sud-
denly to the east of Redscar Bay, near the point where the
territory of the fair race begins, and is not found on either side
of the Eastern peninsula till it reappears on the north coast to
the west of Astrolabe Bay in about latitude 146�. Many tribes,
again, whose neighbours have long been in possession of iron
implements, are totally unacquainted with that metal.
Their tools are wonderfully efficient. They make knives
from cassowary or sometimes from human bones, and from the
bamboo. With their axes, made of a hard stone, or of a thick
clam shell ( Tridacna) they cut down trees, and hew and smooth
great planks 40 inches wide. To the ethnologist this oppor-
tunity of studying a living example of the Age of Stone is of
great interest. They are eager to possess bits of hoop-iron, but
their axes are superior to the average hatchet of the trader. If
the Iron Age was an advance on that of Stone, the Brummagem
Age apparently takes us more than one step backwards !
It is clearly difficult to draw a hard and fast line between the
Papuan and the Polynesian ; and some even of those who, like
Dr, Meinicke, see strong physical differences between them,
maintain that there are not two races in New Guinea. Most
of those who have come in contact with the fair people of the
Eastern peninsula believe they are immigrants who have driven
the aborigines far into the interior; but Signor D?Albextis well
remarks that we are not yet in a position to dogmatise on this
point, and that this fair race may even, possibly, have been
driven into their present position from the westward. As far as
his observations went, he believes the fair people whom he found
in the interior to be practically identical with those of the
Eastern coasts, and very superior to the darker ? Papuans.? On
the coast, however, the fairer race seems to be, in some respects,
degraded, as if by some previous contact with a Papuan popula-
tion. Their languages are many and distinct; the men are often
naked ; they have the septum of the nose bored ; and they are
uncircumcised?all Papuan peculiarities, though some Poly-
nesians have given up circumcision. They have the strange
custom of sacrificing a dog in ratification of friendship?a custom
which prevails also on the northern (Papuan) coast. On the other
hand, their women are more independent than is usual among
Papuans. The scientific instinct, too, is not dormant, for a party
came with ropes of fibre and measured one of our surveying
vessels, carrying off the wonderful record with them ! Captain
Moresby says they are cannibals, but the jaw-bones he saw may
have


have been family relics, for the jaw-bone is treasured among the
Papuans not only as the trophy of an enemy, but as the memento
of a friend. This degradation of the Polynesian race when in
contact with the Papuan is very observable in the Solomon and
New Hebrides groups, where the two races impinge on each
other; yet even here the Polynesians are generally found dis-
tinct, and with their usual abhorrence of their Papuan neigh-
bours. These fine islands have hitherto been little known.
The labour traffic, now that it is on a sounder footing, will pro-
bably be of great advantage to them, for the frequent return ot
labourers who have resided in our colonies will mitigate the
native savagery of the people, aggravated by the atrocities of
which they have been the victims. Not only in these islands,
hut far to the northward and westward throughout the Radack
and Caroline groups, the demeanour of the natives shows too
well the treatment they expect from Europeans. But they can
quite appreciate a different treatment, and the example of a
well-ordered vessel and crew does a good service to the country
they represent. This is clearly shown in Mr. C. F. Wood?s
pleasant volume, which contains some curious jottings of a state
of life and manners now rapidly passing away, and therefore,
as he rightly thinks, quite worth recording.
The author of ? Two Years in Fiji? is evidently somewhat of
a philosopher and citizen of the world, not unduly burthened
with respect for the conventional, but with an observant turn of
mind. His facts, therefore, cannot fail to be instructive, what-
ever we may think of his conclusions. The universal necessity
for work has, he tells us, begun to pervade even the dreamy
isles of the Pacific, leaving no room in the new older of things
for the vagrant ( beach combers ? and loafers of the past. But
there is still many an opening for Englishmen wearied by the
trammels of society. In the island of Rotuma the king w r as
suffering from illness, and had offered his sister, with the half
of his kingdom, to any one who would cure him. Dr. Forbes
did this, and the king stood to his word. The doctor hesitated
a little, but the country was pleasant to dwell in, the people
amiable, and the bride young and attractive. One morning,
however, an alarm was raised that his vessel had slipped from
her moorings. The doctor, with the officers, went on board to
secure her, but they were carried away far to leeward, and unable
to return. The denouement is very disappointing, but a man who
can thus reject a princess and a kingdom must have considerable
faith in his own resources. His narrative of the events which
preceded the annexation of Fiji is clear and impartial. This
step might, he thinks, have been avoided by adopting at the time
1 the


the suggestion made in 1860 by General Smythe, viz. to vest
magisterial power in the British consul, and much mischief
would undoubtedly have been thus prevented.
The resources of the islands are considerable, and although
they may not pay their way for some time, the burthen on Eng-
land is not a heavy one. Unfortunately, although the course
through the group is plain and direct, the local navigation is
perhaps the most dangerous in the whole Pacific. The sig-
nificance of the acquisition lies, first, in the inference which
may be drawn, that England has not yet closed the door against
all future admission to her empire, and, secondly, in the control
thereby acquired over the ? labour traffic.? The importance of
the acquisition, from this point of view, is obvious enough.
Much of the labour is drawn from the islands lying between Fiji
and Queensland, and it is in these two places that, as far as
our control extends, it is mainly employed. As regards this
traffic, Government, while leaving no doubt as to its intention
to put down abuses with a firm hand, has acted fairly and
deliberately. The Pacific Islanders Protection Act (1875),
besides confirming and amending the Act of 1872, also pro-
vides for the appointment of a High Commissioner, whose
authority is to extend to British subjects residing in every
island which is not under the jurisdiction of a civilised power.
This seems a practical and workmanlike arrangement, and to
ensure greater unity of action, the appointment has been vested
in the Governor of Fiji. As, however, his duties will not
permit of his being much away from headquarters, and a modi-
fied �biquity is essential to the success of the scheme, he is to
have deputies who will cruise about, with full magisterial
powers. The moral effect of the knowledge that such officials
exist will of itself be considerable, and the innocent trader will
escape much hardship and practical injustice by having his case
tried on the spot, instead of, as heretofore, at Sydney. But it is
necessary for the effective working of the measure that the
officers employed be men of discretion, and of a cast of mind
at least as much judicial as philanthropic.
The Fijians, who occupy the most easterly limits of Papuan
territory, though in appearance and culture far surpassing any
other member of the race ?an advantage due, seemingly, to some
early admixture of the neighbouring Polynesian blood?are yet
both in physique and in language distinctly Papuan. Their
nearest neighbours to the east are the Tongans, a strong hand-
some Polynesian people. From their better political organisation
they have great influence in Fiji, and, being Christians, have
often exerted it in favour of their fellow religionists there in a
very


very high-handed and oppressive manner. It was hoped by
many of those who urged the annexation of Fiji that this step
would lead to the acquisition of the Tongan (Friendly) and
Samoan (Navigator) Islands. Dr. Forbes has elsewhere* called
attention to the geographical connection between these groups,
which form a triangle whose points are only about 300 miles
apart: they have already many common interests connecting
them with Australia, and their inhabitants are perhaps the
finest members of the Polynesian race ; but the footing recently
acquired by the German Government in Tonga, as well as
certain undefined claims of the Americans on Samoa, might be
an obstacle to a British protectorate.
In speaking of missionary work, Dr. Forbes says that ? a plain
man is apt to be surprised and disappointed ? when he compares
the actual results with what the missionaries claim to have
effected. He protests against the idea that the revolution, within
the last two generations, in feelings and practices, is only, or
mainly, to be ascribed to their efforts. To form a correct opinion
on this subject, we must consider what the condition of Polynesia
would now be if no missionary action had taken place there. As
Dr, Meinicke has well pointed out, society was in a state of
?disintegration. The abominations and social tyranny, every-
where existent, had their sanction in religion, but the beliefs,
of which they were the symbols, had mostly died out. The
mind of the people was thus in a peculiar degree amenable to
any new influence, and readily admitted the superiority of
European civilisation. But it was also, if unconsciously, craving
for some new moral stand-point, and this indispensable con-
dition of existence for any people which has reached a certain
stage of culture, the religious teaching of the missionary?but
not the moral influence of the trader, or the loafer?was com-
petent to satisfy.f The Rev. A. W. Murray may fairly say that
4 it is surely a thing not to be lightly accounted of ? that over the
vast extent of the Pacific ? the principal groups are really Chris-
tian countries, fast becoming independent of foreign aid with
churches and native pastors, schools and training institutions,
and with the Scriptures and other literature in the vernacular.
The type of Christianity taught has not, generally speaking, been
a high one, but this has perhaps brought it the more readily
within the mental grasp of the hearers. Still, a larger share of
general culture than is commonly found is especially desirable in
men who, besides being religious teachers, should be pioneers of

to the Anthropological department of the British Association at Bristol, 1875.
civilisation,


civilisation, and are often advisers in weighty political and social
questions. Meanwhile we need not despair if ecclesiastical like
other history repeats itself. We read of a Fijian tribe beaten in
?war agreeing to accept Christianity, and of others lapsing in
despair into cannibalism after the late fatal introduction of
measles. At Rotuma, Dr. Forbes tells us, the Wesleyan mission-
aries decided (against the well-known text) that it was unlawful
to pay tribute to a heathen king. The latter then, aided by the
Roman Catholics, declared war ; but the question was decided
against him, and he lost his crown in a pitched battle. But
darker events than these would find a parallel in our own early
Christian annals, and we must hope that to the bystanders they
have not been a greater stumbling-block in these times than they
seem to have been to our ancestors. It is difficult not to judge
severely, in such cases, the missionary leaders who have so mis-
conceived the spirit of the Gospel which they profess to teach.
But their difficulties and temptations are often great; they have
been blamed for possessing lands, and for trading, and the objec-
tions are obvious ; but if a mission is to be thoroughly equipped,,
not only as a school for preachers, but also as a centre of European
culture, it cannot in these days dispense with material resources.
The system of ? voluntary offerings,? especially when large sums
are raised in a locality in excess of its own needs,* and of fines
levied (often for conventional offences) from the converts, is liable
to much abuse. Effective supervision might do much to prevent
all such scandals, and the wider sympathies and knowledge of
men which are the fruits of ? sound learning ? would do more.
Both of these might most fitly be supplied by the Church of
England. It must not, however, be supposed that � other denomi-
nations ? have not furnished men of large views and cultivated
intellects. The American Board of Missions at Boston have
sent many of this class; and of those who now represent the
London Missionary Society we have already alluded to Mr. Mac-
farlane, who has given valuable help towards exploration in New
Guinea; Mr. Gill, whose work on the Myths and Songs of the
Pacific, which we noticed in a recent number of this ? Review,?
shows him to be a man of culture and observation ; and Mr.
Whitmee, who has encountered Mr. Wallace, hand impar con-
yressus, on the Ethnology of Polynesia.

bably, on the treatment they receive from Europeans, and on the
introduction of sound hygienic practices. We doubt there being
any ? mysterious law ? by which they must necessarily dwindle
away before a civilised race. Such ? necessity ? may exist in a
temperate climate where the natives, unable to adapt themselves
to new conditions, fail in the battle of life, and are crowded out,
like weeds from cultivated ground, by an increasing European
immigration; but this does not apply to the greater part of the
regions in question. The law, however, by which drink and
gunpowder and debauchery act in diminishing the people is
far from ? mysterious.? Dr. Foley says that ? les trois poisons?
employed against the natives are ?les Jesuites, la Bible et
I?opium.? Of these agents the exterminating action is more
mysterious. When a man writes in this way we are disposed to-
rate his judgment on a par with his good taste, and this writer is
somewhat apt, besides, to be picturesque when he should be
matter-of-fact, and epigrammatic when he should be logical.
That the Polynesians were declining before they ever came in
contact with Europeans, is proved not only by their traditions,
but by abundant traces of more extended occupation. But it is
a mistake, though a common one, to suppose that they are still
decreasing everywhere. The balance, no doubt, is against them,
but in many islands the decline has been arrested, and in some,,
even where, as in Samoa, there is considerable foreign intercourse,
the population is slightly on the increase. Their late attack,
with breech-loaders and a mitrailleuse , upon a British force,
suggests some curious reflections, but not any failing spirit in
the race. A listless apathy, however, the sure precursor of de-
cline, is not uncommon among the converts, and is attributed by
Mr. Wood (no unfriendly critic) to the prohibition of their old
national sports, and the frequent absence of all instruction in
the useful arts of life. Much harm, too, has probably been
done ?to say nothing of violence to the picturesque?by the
capricious adoption of unsuitable clothing. Common-sense,
apparently, is the remedy wanted in these cases. The people
are very sensitive to European diseases, such as influenza,
measles, &c., when first introduced ; but this sensitiveness, or
the virulence of the diseases, may be modified with time.
Meanwhile, many serious causes of decline are gradually
ceasing to operate. Cannibalism and human sacrifices have
disappeared over a vast area, and war and infanticide are far
less common. But many remediable evils remain ; although
the labour trade is under stringent regulation the mortality
caused by it is still considerable, and we cannot estimate, any
more than we can check, the losses from kidnapping by Peruvian
and


and other foreign vessels, or from emigration, voluntary or
otherwise, to the islands under French protection, where philan-
thropic ideas have not been highly developed, and the morality
is in strict harmony with the couleur locale. The complaints
made by the missionaries of the loss of their proteges from the
latter cause are not so unreasonable as might be supposed. The
people cannot as yet hold their own in dealing with Europeans,
and if they are to prosper must be kept for a time in leading-
strings. This fact must be recognised freely, whatever deduc-
tions we may choose to draw from it. As matters now stand, it
is difficult to say which of the two classes of influence we have
described will win the day. The collision between the races,
if unregulated, is like that between the earthen and the iron
vessel. But we believe that if their intercourse could be placed
for a season under strict supervision, the softer race might be-
come hardened, and its energies restored by the stimulating
power ol their new faith, and by a gradual adoption of civilised
habits.
And yet in some of the islands where such influences have
been long in operation, it would seem that the battle is being
lost. This is notably the case in perhaps the most remarkable
of all the groups, and to which the memory of Captain Cook
lends a classic interest. The population of the Sandwich Islands,
which a century ago was probably over a quarter of a million, is
now under fifty thousand, and, what is worse, is diminishing by
about one thousand yearly; and this under a fairly enlightened,
though perhaps not sufficiently despotic government, and where
the white population is friendly and sympathetic. The fact adds a
terrible pathos to the charming pictures of life and scenery given
us by Miss Bird, whose enthusiastic appreciation of natural
beauty is happily matched by her brilliant powers of descrip-
tion. The pleasant, friendly, refined, and often gifted people,
laughing away existence amid scenes of unimagined loveliness,
seem unsubstantial as a dissolving view. The graceful wreaths
of flowers, with which they are ever bedecking themselves, appear
like an adornment for the tomb, while the solemn music of the
everlasting surf sounds like a dirge over the departing race.
Their political capacities are considerable, but they seem as if
paralysed by contact with the European mind, and many useful
provisions of their old laws have fallen into desuetude. An
attempt is being made to extirpate leprosy, one of the chief
scourges of the country, by deporting the victims to a separate
island; but the utter recklessness of the people, and their
gregarious ways, make it difficult to enforce any precautions.
Although friendly and affectionate, and with a strong feeling for
their


their race, the women, from mere dislike to trouble, entirely
neglect their children, and often give them away. Hence the
mortality among them is hardly less than in the days of open
infanticide, and any Government must be helpless in presence
of such indifference. Their energies seem to be reserved for
their amusements. They are fearless riders, and their devotion
to riding as a pastime is curious, considering how short a time
they have known it. They are equally at home in the roughest
water, riding the surf on a plank being the national sport at all
ages.
The whole group of islands has been the scene of volcanic
action. At the western end of the chain, indeed, the action was
submarine, and the islands are due to upheaval only; but in
Hawaii eruptions and earthquakes of terrific violence have taken
place within these very few years, and at the crater of Kilauea,
13,000 feet high, volcanic action may now be seen on a grander
scale than anywhere else in the world. The ascent of the
mountain is no small feat, especially for a lady; but it was
successfully accomplished by Miss Bird, and her eloquent de-
scription of the scene has additional interest from its clearness
and precision of detail. Nor do ? moving accidents by flood and
field ? lose anything by her treatment of them. When we read
of a delicate Englishwoman, travelling for health, riding cavalier
fashion over mountain precipices, scrambling from boulder to
boulder in the raging torrent, or swept away by the rising flood,
we hold our breath, and marvel at the restorative power of the
Hawaiian climate?or the versatility of the feminine constitu-
tion. The authoress gives a curious account of the little island
court, deferentially ti'eated by the great powers of the earth, and
yet only existing by the sufferance of the United States, and we
heartily echo her wishes for the prosperity of this singular and
amiable people.
The question arises, what is the duty of England towards
these races, with whom the rapid increase of commerce and of
emigration is bringing us yearly into closer contact ? There are
many, in Australia and elsewhere, who call on us, as the heirs
of the anti-slavery crusaders, and the natural protectors of all
the weaker races of the earth, to annex the whole of Polynesia,
and to undertake the education of its inhabitants. To Aus-
tralians, the prospect of this vast extension of their future
Empire?to say nothing of their present markets?is naturally
very attractive. The task might worthily occupy the energies of
a great power ; but to perform the task successfully that power
must be supreme within the sphere of action. It would be
unfair to infer from the recent appointment of a ? High Com-
missioner y


missioner? for the Pacific, that any more direct and exclusive
protectorate is contemplated ; but if such a policy were ever
resolved on, the first step taken would probably be only a slight
extension of the machinery of the Act. The subject of further
annexation in the Pacific has lately been much discussed in
connection with New Guinea. Recent discoveries in the island,
followed by rumours of its probable occupation by some foreign
power, caused great excitement in Australia. There was a
general demand for annexation, and petitions to this effect were
forwarded by the different Colonial Governments. People
seemed to become suddenly aware that a vast territory, pre-
sumably of boundless resources, lay within eighty miles of their
coasts. Now the Australian is a man of large ideas. No
Highland laird was ever more jealous of possible encroachment
on his marches, or more anxious to extend them. In England
we are satisfied to claim jurisdiction for three miles beyond our
coasts; in Queensland they extend it to sixty. They still
resent the intrusion of the French in New Caledonia, and it was
they chiefly who urged the incorporation of the even more
distant Fiji. The feeling seems instinctive, and in one sense,
at least, natural, for the establishment of other powers as
neighbours would alter the conditions of her political existence,
and political existence, for Australia, has hitherto meant pros-
perity, The arguments for the annexation of New Guinea are
by no means to be dismissed lightly. It is urged that things
cannot remain as they are, now that the country is becoming
known. Adventurers from Australia and elsewhere will certainly
establish themselves there ; disputes with the natives will follow,
and we shall eventually have to interfere, as in Fiji, amid
complications of land, and other questions, which we might
avoid by holding the country from the beginning. The expense
of annexation, it is argued, would not equal the outlay needed
for the defence of Australia if New Guinea were in the occu-
pation of a foreign power. It is assumed that if we do not
annex it some other power will do so, whose possession of the
northern shores of Torres Straits would imperil the great and
increasing traffic by that route between Australia and India;
and the late diminution of our influence in the Malacca Straits
by the abandonment of our protectorate of Acheen makes it the
more desirable that we should command the other part of the
route. The pearl-shell fishery, now an important branch of
trade, and the trepang, or heche de mer , fisheries extend from the
Australian waters along the banks Avhich line the southern coast
ol New Guinea, and unpleasant complications, such as those we
are familiar with in Newfoundland, may arise if these fisheries
fall


fall into the hands of another power. It is also urged that every
additional holding in these seas gives us an increased control
over the labour traffic.
We must not be held to undervalue any of these arguments
if we say that expectations have perhaps been unduly raised by
a certain want of sobriety and caution in recent accounts of the
resources of the country, and in the conclusions drawn therefrom.
Even Captain Moresby?s very attractive volume has something
to answer for in this respect. While sympathising with the lofty
view he takes of the responsibilities of this country in his
?eloquent plea for annexation, we are bound to say that he does
not give sufficient weight to the practical difficulties in the way.
He does not ignore the difficulties and hardships encountered on
bis cruise, and which were so gallantly shared by officers and
men,* but all is, unconsciously, softened down by the very
sanguine spirit of the writer. We must not forget that his
uniformly pleasant intercourse with the natives of the eastern
part of New Guinea has not always been experienced by others.
His actual knowledge of its resources, again, is limited and
superficial, and hardly warrants his confident assertion that all
the elements of successful colonisation are to be found there.
The hero of Locksley Hall might have found a congenial
retreat amid the gorgeous beauties of nature so eloquently de-
scribed, but we are slow to believe that islands ten degrees from
the equator could in any true sense ? become English homes.?
Many of these, besides, are already inhabited and carefully
cultivated, perhaps to their available limit?and this seems to be
the case also, as far as is known, throughout the Eastern peninsula,
the only part which it has been seriously proposed to occupy.
The natives of the numerous villages will certainly not part
with the lands which they use, and the forest, which is excep-
tionally dense, would have to be cleared by imported labour.
We may dismiss the notion that European labour,would be
possible in such a climate, and we have no reason to suppose
that the natives would be induced to work, even if, which is
unlikely, they refrained from molesting a new-comer. It is not
probable either, that they have much surplus produce to dispose
of, or that they could be easily persuaded to cultivate any
particular staple with a view to foreign trade. The planter,
then, would find greater obstacles to success here than in parts
of Queensland or in Fiji, or in many of the smaller Pacific
islands, while the question of transport for his produce would be

more


more serious still. Though geographically a seeming appendage
to Australia, and on the highway of traffic thence to India and
to China, the south-eastern part of New Guinea is, for com-
mercial purposes, singularly isolated. For more than half the
year the S.E. trade-wind renders it difficult for sailing-vessels,
leaving the Gulf of Papua to make the ports of Eastern Aus-
tralia, and in the height of that monsoon even a steamer cannot
always make its way eastward through Torres Straits against
wind and current combined ; and during the rest of the year
it is hardly less difficult to beat through the Straits against the
N.W. monsoon.* The distances from the south-east coast of
New Guinea to the nearest British port available for coaling or
provisioning are considerable?Brisbane being not less than
1000 miles off, and Singapore or Hong Kong three times as far
?but there would be no very serious difficulty in establishing a
coaling or wooding station in a secure harbour of the fine
district lately visited by Mr. Macfarlane. If such a post were
chosen with judgment, it might become valuable not only as a
port of call, but also as the entrepot of a well-regulated trade
with the surrounding districts ; and a gradual increase of friendly
relations with the people might pave the way to a further advance,,
if that should become advisable. Mr. Macfarlane, while dilating
on the attractions of the country, earnestly deprecates immi-
gration as premature. But though any attempt of the kind
would probably end in failure, it is by no means improbable
that such an attempt may be made, either in the form of a rush
of diggers 4 prospecting ? for gold, or in the more ambitious form
of the 4 New Guinea Colonising Association.? The prospectus of
this Company is a curiosity, and its scheme somewhat startling.
It is proposed to send out a party of some two hundred and fifty
armed men to form a settlement. They are to be under military
discipline, with chaplains and doctors, and the self-elected officers
will, it is hoped, be appointed by her Majesty as 4 Justices of
the Peace for the island of New Guinea.? There is to be Divine
service on Sunday, by which, and by the abstinence from work
on that day, it is expected that the natives will be much impressed.
The money required to maintain the scheme till it becomes self-
supporting is to be raised by debentures on the land, failing
which there remain always the 4 utensils of gold ? described by
* But for this, and for the great difficulty of access through the reefs and islands
to the eastward, New Guinea could hardly have remained so long a terra incog-
nita ; and to these causes may be added, first, the exclusiveness of the Dutch,
who for so long suppressed all intercourse with places to the east of the Moluccas,
and, secondly, the fact that the stream of enterprise has latterly been attracted to
the more temperate regions to the southward.

natives, but which other travellers have somehow not observed.
They are to negotiate with the natives for the sale of land, which
if they will grant, so? The alternative is obvious, and sug-
gested to the Aborigines Protection Society an application to
the Colonial Office, where they were assured that if any acts
of violence were committed, the strong arm of the High Com-
missioner of the Pacific was competent to deal even with the
justices of the peace, and the chaplains, and the doctors. The
Association, which had been scheming to commit the Colonial
Office to a support of this thinly veiled piece of filibustering,
will therefore do well to proceed with caution. It is quite
possible that a large body of men, well disciplined and ably led,
and backed by plenty of money, might establish themselves on
the island with very important results. But any such proceeding,
however well-devised, would obviously be premature until the
interior has in some measure been explored, and we hope this
may be undertaken before long by a responsible expedition.
The unfinished survey of the coast, too, could not be put into
better hands than those of Captain Moresby, aided by a scientific
staff, and with a well-found ship. If the present friendly rela-
tions with the natives can be maintained, many of the diffi-
culties of former days may be averted, and it will be little to our
credit if they are not averted.
In all this we seem to assume that there will be no intrusion
on the part of any foreign power. This contingency is, we
think, much less imminent than has been supposed. But
there is one thing we should certainly resist, viz., the forma-
tion of any more foreign convict establishments, even as near
as New Caledonia. The occupation by a foreign power of any
point on the southern coast opposite to Australia would, after
the recent discussion of the subject, have the appearance of a
menace, and we could hardly permit it. The passage of Torres
Straits, however, would be secured by our holding the Prince of
Wales Islands, and the opposite coast commanded by the occu-
pation of one or two of the islands adjacent. It is difficult to see
how a foreign station on the north coast could appreciably affect
the interests of Australia; but it is always wise to consider
such a question from the sentimental as well as from the material
side, and the occupation of the eastern half of New Guinea by a
foreign power would cause not only serious and, we must admit,
natural disappointment, but also ill-will towards England among
a large party in Australia. Their views, however, are by no
means bounded by New Guinea. Crescit amor terrce quantum
ipsa Australia crescit; and their ? Australian dominion ? would

include at least the whole series of great island groups extending
eastwards from New Guinea as far as Fiji. We should be more
inclined to sympathise with this spirit if it were accompanied
by a willingness to share the burthens involved in such a
policy; but when it was suggested at the time of the annex-
ation of Fiji that, as a general principle, a colony ought to
contribute towards the cost of any measure passed solely or
mainly for its own benefit, or at its own request, the principle
was repudiated by the Australian authorities, on the ground that
they would have no control over the expenditure. But it is
obvious that such control must practically lie with the central
power; and the reasonableness of the suggestion, as well as the
considerate and courteous tone in which it was made by Lord
Carnarvon, has since been admitted by the leading Australian
papers.
With regard to New Guinea, it is clearly desirable not to
precipitate matters, but to leave them in statu quo as long as
possible; to encourage scientific exploration, and to repress
filibustering; to avoid for the present the responsibilities of a
formal annexation, but to enter a caveat against annexation by
any other power. It has been argued that we ought to take
possession of the island, because by no other power would the
interests of the people be so carefully studied. We believe that
in no other country would the sentiment of responsibility be
stronger, but it is doubtful whether, in the management of such
races, we have not something to learn from the Dutch. The
traveller visiting Java from India is often struck by the superior
cleanliness and order of the villages, and the more skilful culti-
vation. Of course there are no inconvenient questions about
liberty, or any affectation of equality between the European and
the native. In some of the smaller islands the system, while
still ?paternal,? seems more philanthropic and disinterested.
Opinions will differ on the question, whether the compulsory
education of a savage race by the introduction of law and order,
and the discipline of forced labour, could ever be justifiably,
undertaken. Many persons will answer that such a system is
repugnant to the genius of Englishmen. We are not concerned
to speculate on the matter. No such responsibility should ever
be lightly undertaken, but in the not improbable case of its
being forced upon us, we should certainly stand condemned if,
with all our own accumulated experience, and that of other
nations, to guide us, and with our unequalled command of
material resources, of political skill, ?and of good intentions, we
failed to solve the problem.
