HOW TO TAKE CARE OF
LEATHER.
(3<4 TANNED hide, before the
JL currier puts the stuffing into it,
is hard and stiff, like a board, no
matter how fine or thin it may be.
The stuffing is made up of a mixture
of oil and greases, worked into the
leather either by the old style of hand
stuffing or the modern method, by
centrifugal force in a revolving drum.
The object of this is to soften and
preserve the leather. Eventually,
the stuffing wears out, works out, dis-
solves or dries out, and the leather
gradually returns to its original hard,
board-like condition. The application
of the right kind of oil restores the
stuffing in a measure, and in some
cases may even make the leather
better than it was originally.
As soon as leather shows any sign
of becoming hard or stiff, it should be
given common sense treatment, for
cracking is not far off, which means
that the dry, rough fibres are begin-
ning to break apart. Oil inside the
leather, coating the fibres, enables
them to slip and move on one another


without harm, whenever the leather
is pulled or bent. In other words, the
fibres are properly lubricated.
Oil makes leather strong, and
keeps the fibres from breaking, and
old leather, when not too far gone,
can be revived by the application of
oil. But no oil can mend the cracks
or make the broken fibres whole.
In stuffing leather, the up-to-date
curriers use principally Petroleum
grease, mixed with a small propor-
tion of animal grease. This compound
makes a very durable stuffing, and it
is not affected by change of atmos-
phere or temperature. Besides, Pet-
roleum Greases are neutral—that is,
they contain neither acid nor alkali,
both of which are harmful to leather.
The stuffing, no matter how good at
first, must wear out, and it is this
that makes the oiling of leather
imperative.
The best animal oil for softening
leather is Neatsfoot, but it is not a
good preservative, because it lacks
body, is not water proof, and, being
of animal origin, it contains free
fatty acid, and it decomposes. Petro-
leum grease compounded with Neats-
foot oil is better. A little Neatsfoot
improves the grease for leather


dressing. Never use Kerosene on
leather.
There are two oils which have been
specially selected and compounded
with a small percentage of Neatsfoot
oil to make perfect leather dressings.
They are Gargoyle Leather Oil and
Vacme Compound Leather Dressing.
Gargoyle Leather Oil has been sold
for 59 years by the Vacuum Oil Com-
pany, who were the first to produce
an oil derived from petroleum for
this purpose, and have remained
leaders in this branch of oil manu-
facture.
Both Gargoyle Leather Oil and
Vacme Leather Dressing are clean,
although the former is jet black.
They are easily applied, and they go
right into the leather and stay there.
They do not “fry out” or “gum” or
evaporate. They do not soil the hands
when touching the leather, nor does
touching it leave any finger marks.
Even the odour of the oils is not dis-
agreeable, for they do not contain
enough animal oil to become offensive
when exposed to warmth and per-
spiration.
These oils are measurably water
proof, but if you apply either of them
to your boots, you cannot expect to


stand in water all day with dry feet;
they resist water as much as any oil
is able without rubber in it. As they
undergo no change, in the leather,
they last longer than other oils. In
a measure they restore the original
stuffing, and thus keep the leather
sound and pliable.
LIFE OF LEATHER.
Everything made of leather would
last three times as long, be stronger,
keep its shape, be soft, clean and
pleasant to the touch, if oiled, as it
ought to be, with Gargoyle Leather
Oil or Vacme Leather Dressing.
HOW TO TREAT LEATHER.
Harness.
Before oil is applied the harness
should be moist. A good opportunity
is provided for treatment after the
harness has become wet through
having been exposed to the rain. The
leather should then be washed with
lukewarm water which has a little
common soap in it. After it has been
drained and wiped and allowed to
hang for a couple of hours until some
of the moisture has evaporated, the
oil should be applied. As the mois-
ture evaporates, the oil will penetrate


the leather. On no account should
the oil be applied to the leather when
it is dry.
The oil should be warm. If when
applied it is cold, the oil will not pene-
trate the leather freely. The tem-
perature of a summer day is warm
enough.
Polish can be applied immediately,
whether on harness or shoe leather.
Use no “harness soap.” Soap is
right as a wash, to be rinsed off; as
a dressing to be left on, it is of no
possible use, and it injures the
leather.
Old harness, if very old and dry,
should be soaked in lukewarm water
for half an hour or more; then pro-
ceed as above.
The finer the harness, the oftener
it should be oiled, and the less oil need
be used. The stockier the harness,
the more oil it will bear.
These oils penetrate leather so
quickly, you may be inclined to put on
too much. Bear in mind the oil that
does good is inside, in the heart of
the leather; it wants no oil outside.
When the leather has that degree of
softness and pliability that belongs to
new harness, it has oil enough. Too
much makes it soggy.


For fancy harness, apply little and
often, and polish daily, just as you
black your boots.
In the case of working harness, if
you want it to last and be as strong
and tough as it can be, oil it once a
month.
Leather Tops.
Oil them before they begin to lose
their lustre, and they will never get
shabby.
Shoe Leather.
Shoe leather ought always to be
oiled after being very wet. This
keeps it soft and sound. It should be
slightly moist when the oil is applied.
A little moisture in leather facilitates
the entry of the oil into the fibres,
and at the same time tends to prevent
its striking through the leather. Do
not, therefore, oil any shoes without
first moistening them.
Hunting and Working Boots .
Use very little and very often; how
often depends on conditions. If you
want them water proof, keep the
leather filled with the oil. You will not
mind, then, if it does strike through,
but always be sure to dampen them
evenly before oiling.
Don’t oil patent, glace, or fancy
leather.


Gargoyle Leather Oil is packed in
4 gallon, 1 gallon lithographed and
quart and pint tins.
It is a black coloured oil and suit-
able for all classes of black leathers.
Vacme Leather Dressing is packed
