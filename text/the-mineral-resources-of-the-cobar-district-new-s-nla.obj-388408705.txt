OOBAR AND ITS MINERALS.
INTRODUCTION.
publishers of this small pamphlet aim at placing
in the hands of speculators, and others interested
in the development of the Mineral Resources of the
Colony, the latest and most reliable information (with
correct maps) of the Cobar Gold and Silver Fields,
and at the same time it is their desire to place on
record the authentic facts relating to the discovery
"and opening up of the same.
COBAR GOLD FIELD.
The precious metal was first found in this district at
the United Hill, about three-and-a-half miles south of
the present township of Cobar, in 1871, by Mr. Henry
Cornish, an old and experienced miner, who, at the
time of the discovery, was prospecting for copper on
ground taken up as Mineral Conditional Purchases under
the .Land Act of 1861. Copper, we may say, was at
that time considered to be the only payable metal
likely to be found in the locality. It is said, and on
good grounds, too, we believe, that the finding of the
precious metal —gold—was due primarily to the fact
that Mr. Cornish required an evening meal after his
day’s arduous toil, and had nothing in his camp where-
with to appease his appetite. Well, it may be wondered
how this could be ? But still the fact remains, that
hearing the melodious notes of a “ ’posum up a gum-
tree,” and thinking this animal might suit him for


culinary purposes, he lifted up a stone to knock it off
the limb of the tree on which it was perched, and his
astonishment may be better imagined than described
when he found adhering to the stone so picked
up a flakey bit of gold as large as a postage
stamp. All thoughts of his hunger vanished, and
after spending a highly excited night, dreaming
of the fortune that he hoped was just within
his grasp, he started next morning for Bourke—l2o
miles distant—to inform his partners, who resided there,
of his and their good luck. Taking several samples of
the stone with him, two pieces were forwarded from
Bourke to Sydney for assay. The return showed that
the stones submitted for examination contained 18
ounces 16 dwts. and 32 ounces 12 dwts. fine gold, re-
spectively, per ton. This result caused the partners to
resolve to prospect for the precious metal rather than
copper.
Cornish then returned to Cobar, work was re-
commenced, crosscuts were put in to test the width of
the lode, &c., and four bags of stone taken as a fair
average of what was in sight, and for the prospectors’
private information, were forwarded to Sandhurst, Vic-
toria, for treatment. The returns gave the following
results :

which were deemed to be highly satisfactory and en-
couraging. After sinking 90 feet on one of the out-
crops, and at that depth putting in a drive about 50 feet
at right angles to the line of lode, the mine, although
showing such good prospects, was abandoned, owing to
tne local prejudice of the copper miners of those days,
and, as far as that is concerned, of the present time,
against the idea of gold being found in copper country.
Of course now-a-days, actual facts go to disprove this


notion, and it is well-known that the best specimen of
gold ever found in the Cobar district was brought to
light out of the Great Cobar Copper Mine. Mb.
Coenish, after prospecting several other likely places
in the district, particularly at the Rock Holes, on the
present Cobar-Nymagee Road, and Mount Collis, on
Curraweena Run, at both of which he obtained fair
prospects, he abandoned all his claims through the bad
financial support he received locally. He then recom-
menced his business in Cobar, which he still carries on
successfully. About eight years later (1879) a Me.
Aethue Leslie, a gentleman whose credentials, as it
afterwards transpired were not of the highest order,
appeared on the scene. He represented, or, according
to some reports, mis-represented himself as a member
of the Melbourne Stock Exchange. His way was tak-
ing, and he received the confidence of many, in both
Cobar and Bourke. But, alas 1 he was a gay deceiver.
Me. Coenish was induced by him to again take up the
land near Cobar, on doing which, Me. Tom Paesons, a
ocal store-keeper, was taken into partnership ; but Mr.
Leslie would not, or could not, but at any rate, did
not do what he promised to perform ; the upshot of the
matter was, to use old Harry’s flowery language, “ the
good old mine was soon hung up again.” In 1887, or
sixteen years after the mine was discovered, it was re-
pegged for the third time, under the name of the “ Oc-
cidental,” by Captain D. A. Pbnhall, who, in con-
junction with Captain Lane, J.P., an old Cobar
identity, and Mr. Cornish, formed a syndicate of 21
shareholders, who now hold and work the mine with
every prospect of its being an auriferous, and, conse-
quently financial success. The Occidental now consists
of two blocks, held under Gold Mining Lease, of five
acres and ten acres respectively. On the former the
auriferous lode outcrops all through it, at the north end
being 60 feet and at the south end 120 feet in width.
The reef is composed of ferruginous deposit—a mixture


of iron ore and quartz, with bunches of red slatey de-
posit between ; and these slatey bunches all con-
ain goid. One striking feature common to all the
mines in the vicinity of Cobar is that the red slate
found in them contains gold, a fact which we think is
unique in the history of Gold Mining in Australia.
Independent of the shaft sunk by Mr. Cornish, ano-
ther shaft has been put down to a depth of 47 feet.
All the stone at grass is auriferous, and it is expected
to realise in bulk not less than 25 dwts. gold per ton.
From recent calculations it is estimated that there are
20,000 tons of gold-bearing stone in sight. A number
of assays have averaged over five ounces gold per ton,
and it only now requires suitable machinery to make
this a fine dividend-paying property.
THE GREAT COBAR COLD MINING
COMPANY LIMITED.
This property of this Company consists of 25 acres,
and is under the management of Captain Peniiall,
who has done much to develop our local gold field. The
Company is formed of 12,000 shares of 20s. each, head-
quarters being in Sydney. The main shaft on the reef
is 60 feet deep, the reef itself being about 30 feet wide,
the trenches sunk across the lode having proved this.
One ton of stone—fair sample—crushed at the Royal
Mint, Sydney, yielded 19 dwts. gold per ton worth
£3 19s. lid. per ounce.
THE ALBION.
This claim consists of 10 acres, held by 14 share-
holders. On the property are two shafts, the eastern
being 75 feet deep, while the western is only 60. Good
prospects have been obtained from these, assays giving
five ounces 10 dwts, gold per ton. This adjoins the
Occidental, and was taken up by Mr. Joseph Wright,
t local hotel-keeper, who richly deserves the highest
credit for the interest he has taken in the mining re-
vival at Cobar.


THE GOLDEN CROWN.
This fine property is held in 300 shares of £lO each,
and consists of 13 acres, on which are two shafts, 50
and 60 feet deep respectively. At present a drive
is being put in to connect the two. Good prospects
have been obtained, and it is likely to develop into a
valuable property.
THE GLADSTONE.
This claim has an area of 15 acres, and is being man-
aged by a syndicate having 50 shares of £5O each.
Assays show 2 ounces 10 dwts. gold per ton.
THE CHESNEY COBAR GOLD MINING
COMPANY. NO LIABILITY.
Without exception, the best property on the field
belongs to the above Company, having head-quarters in
Melbourne. The land consists of three blocks of five
acres each and one of 10 acres, making in all 25 acres
held under G. M. Lease.
50 Acres held as a Water Eight,
100 ~ Freehold Land,
making a total area of 175 acres. The reefs, which are
traceable all through the land under Gold Mining
Lease, have a width of 160 feet on the surface. Four
shafts have been sunk, in all of which payable gold, it
is said, has been found. The 600 tons of ore at grass is
estimated to return, by ordinary crushing, two ounces
gold per ton ; while, if the chlorination process be used
—some of the gold being very fine—an equal quantity
may be expected to be saved from the tailings. Several
bulk crushings have been made from the property.
Two tons from the surface sent to the Sydney Mint
yielded ... 4 oz. dwts. per ton,
while the assay of tailings gave 1 „ 18| „ „
making a total of 6 „ 9 „ „
the gold being worth at £4 2s, Id. per ounce, a very high


standard indeed. In fact, all the silver contained in
the stone was valued by the Mint authorities at only
one penny per ton, thus proving the good quality of the
gold. The bullion assay was ; Gold, silver
A further lot of twenty-eight tons were forwarded to
Victoria. Fourteen of these yielded by ordinary bat-
tery treatment, 1 ounce 17 dwts. gold per ton ; no
assays having been made of the tailings. The other 14
tons were submitted to the chlorination process, which
produced 2 ounces 3 dwts. 15 grs. gold per ton. A
further lot of H tons, taken from a trench on the
property, on treatment gave 1 ounce 2 dwts. gold per
ton ;so that the 31 1 tons fair sample, taken from the
mine and submitted to treatment, gave an average
return of about 2\ ounces gold per ton, which at,
say £4 2s. per ounce value, equals a gross return
of over £9 per ton, a good enough result when there
are by late calculations, an estimated quantity of auri-
ferous stone in sight of 100,000 tons. A further lot of
two tons has been sent to the Melbourne International
Exhibition, where it occupies a prominent place among
the mineral exhibits in the N. S. W. Court. Numerous
assays have been made by Messrs. W. A. Dixon, F.1.C.,
F.C.S., and S. S. Vale, Sydney, W. Thomas, Broken
Hill and Adelaide, and Charles A. Chesney, 8.8.,
Tindarey, Cobar. These have ranged from 18 to 107
ounces gold per ton, while the Department of Mines
assayed a sample, a portion of which is now in their
Museum—no gold being visible in it to the naked eye—
which gave the extraordinary high return, as shown by
the last report of the Department, of over 135 ounces
of gold per ton. This was by far the richest assay made
during the year. The freehold land of the Company
is so situated that it forms one of the best catches
for storm water in the Cobar district, while for a
machinery or residence site it is unsurpassed. Tenders
have been called for the erection of a large gold-saving
plant; and, at present, there is machinery on' the


ground which is capable, when erected, of putting
through about 120 tons stone per week.
A large reservoir, to contain about 40,000 cubic yards
of water, is being constructed, and with the advent of
Mr. Robert Jackson, an old and experienced Sand-
hurst manager, who has been chosen as the future
manager of this property, it is confidently expected
that things will “ hum,” and ere long we hope to hear
of the gold escort being in readiness, after the regular
cleaning up, to guard the valuable produce of the mine
on its way from the mine to the bank for safe keeping.
The local Directors of this Company are Messrs. Ches-
ney and Weight ; the Melbourne directors being well-
known gentlemen who have had an extensive experience
on the gold fields of N, S. W. and the neighbouring Col-
onies. This mine will, without doubt, prove itself to
be a rich dividend-paying property, as soon as suitable
machinery is erected.
The nominal capital of the Company is £lOO,OOO in
100,000 shares of £1 each. Of these 50,000 contributing
shares are issued as considered paid-up to 10s. per share.
CHESNEY No. 2 NORTH.
The area of this property is 30 acres, and is worked
by a Company with a capital £5OO in 100 shares of £5
each. They have only lately commenced work, and
are now sinking a shaft, the contract depth being 100
feet. Three very good quartz and ironstone leaders
were found on the surface, and, as we write, we hear
that good gold has been struck in the shaft. Being
situated on the line of the Chesney reef, it ought to
prove a very good property.
FORT BOURKE SILVER MINING COMPANY.
The operations of this Company have been confined
more to prospecting for silver rather than gold. They
have an area of 20 acres, and they have driven a tunnel
into the mountain for about 300 feet. The Company is
negociating for the purchase of suitable machinery for


gold-saving, as they hare obtained better prospects of
gold than silver. Assays range from 7 dwts. to 19 dwts,
gold per ton.
THE JUBILEE.
Several claims of an area of 23 acres have been con-
ditionally amalgamated under above name. On the
property are four shafts, two down 12 feet each, and
two 45 and 64 feet respectively. At the bottom of
deepest shaft a length of 40 feet has been driven, in
which was discovered a splendidly-formed reef 5 feet
wide carrying good gold. Assays—6 ounces 2 dwts.
gold per ton.
THE GREAT LESLIE.
The area of this property is about 160 acres, situated
about four miles north of Cobar. The company holding
it consists of 32 shares of £5 each. One shaft has been
put down 70 feet, and the sinking prospects are most
encouraging.
THE PEAK.
This field is about four miles south of Cobar, and is,
apparently, the continuation of the Chesney line of
reef. The Arcadian Amalgamated claims join the pros-
pecting claim, on which a shaft 80 feet deep has been
sunk, showing a reef from 10 to 14 feet in width, carry-
ing good gold.
OTHER CLAIMS.
There are quite a number of other claims, but really
So little work has been done on them that it becomes a
hard matter to report as to their prospects. One thing
is certain; in all, or nearly all, gold has been found,
and a splendid opportunity offers itself in many cases
to any speculator who cares to invest a little money in
prospecting. The holders of a lot of claims are men
who have not the capital to work them with a fair
chance of success ; but they hang on, and do the best
they can, believing that in the ground lies a rich for-
tune, which only requires time and a little money spent
to obtain.

BILLYGOE GOLD AND SILVER FIELD.
INTRODUCTION.
¥HE above field is on Tindarey Run, the property of
Messrs. C. A, Chesney & Co., and is situated about
25 miles north of Cobar township. To us it seems a re-
markable fact that many people imagine that outside
the confines of the above pastoral holding neither gold,
silver, nor other minerals can be found in payable
quantities. This is a mistaken idea, as will be seen
when prospecting is systematically carried on at other
places in the district having similar geological forma-
tions as the hills where the precious metals have been
found on Tindarey. The most notable of these are the
Gundabooka Mountain, which extends towards that of
Wuttagoona, Coronga Peak, on the run of the same
name, Collis’s Mount on Curraweena Run, Mount
Bobby, about 25 miles east of Cobar, and the very many
smaller hills which lie between these more prominent
elevations. The whole of the Cobar country is highly
metalliferous, and its position accords in very many re-
spects with the localities where the most profitable gold-
fields and gold quartz veins in the world are situated.
For example (1), the richest of the above have been
found near the borders of present or past oceans. Mr,
Wilkinson, Government Geologist, has shown that
Cobar is situated on the bank of what was at one time
an immense sea (of the Cretaceous period), which ex-
tended north into Queensland.
(2). The rich gold quartz veins have generally been
found in the paloeozoic formation, or are of the same
age. Mr. A. Anderson, a geological surveyor, who re-
cently examined the Cobar district, pointed out that
the silurian or auriferous formation, together with a


few patches of granite, form the base rock of the
country.”
(3) “ All gold-producing regions have been invaded
by extensive igneous action beneath, upon or beside the
formation,” says a well-known writer, and this holds
good in the Cobar district. In our opinion, the gold
reefs at Cobar the deeper we sink on them the richer
will they become, and we consider they are of a per-
manent character, as the depth attained in the Great
Cobar Copper Mine, about 600 feet, proves the existence
of very deep lodes, rich in sulphides.
(4) All present oceans contain gold and other mine-
rals in solution ; so also did the ancient sea, on the
bank of which Cobar now stands.
(5). Oxide of iron in the ore is a good indicator of
value. This we have in the district in abundance.
There must, therefore, have been at Cobar, within
a few yards of each other, all the elements in
nature’s laboratory necessary to supply the gold
to the reefs. The natural sulphuric acid (from
the sulphur) acting upon the chloride of sodium
(in the sea water), in the presence of bi-oxide of
manganese now found associated with the reefs, all
being acted upon by intense heat, caused a reaction,
liberating the chlorine gas —the natural solvent of
gold—which formed with the gold in solution, chloride
of gold. This auriferous chloride filtered through the
rocks, and collected in the natural fissures, caused per-
haps by the subsidence of the ocean, assisted by the
igneous action. Then either the chlorine volatilized, or
what is more likely, seeing there is so much oxide of
iron associated with the reefs, a natural sulphate of
iron (sulphur and iron) was formed which precipitated
the gold in the finely divided state in which it is now
found in the district.


THE BILLYCOE PROSPECTING
SYNDICATE.
It is about nine years since a mining man named
Alexander Rankin, thinking that the appearance of
the country around Billygoe Mountain looked very favor-
able for the existence of the precious metals, entered
into a contract with Mr. James Ramsey, the then
manager of Tindarey Station, to excavate a small tank
on the run. Rankin’S principal object in taking the
work was, while carrying out his contract, to have an
opportunity during his spare time to prospect the
locality for gold. His plant consisted of a wheel-
barrow, a pick, and a shovel. Though useful, certainly
his plant was of a rather simple description for the
work he had in hand. Still, with these implements he
stuck to his work like a man, having even to go to the
station—five miles distant—and on his barrow take
rations and water out to his camp to supply his
weekly requirements. His Sundays were spent in pros-
pecting about the now famous Billygoe, or, as it was
then known as Tindarey Mountain, He met with
success at this, for one day he found a small reef
where the main Billygoe shaft is now situated, from
which he obtained very fair prospects of gold. This
discovery changed his plans somewhat, and he then
engaged Maetin Hendeeson, who is now well-known
in connection with the mine, to assist him. To HEN-
DEESON he gave a share in his new discovery, and they
commenced sinking on the reef. At four feet from the
surface the reef was six inches wide ; at eleven feet, it
had opened out to two feet six inches, while, to their
disgust, at twenty-one feet it had completely pinched
out. The tank contract was then proceeded with and
finished, after which a small syndicate was formed
who assisted Rankin and Hendeeson to work the
claim for some months, as it was very confidently ex-
pected that something good would be discovered on
sinking. Eventually all parties got tired, Hendeesoii






and Rankin sold out, and Mr. Pierce Goold, of
Cobar, then became a shareholder by purchase, and
Henderson was appointed working manager of
the mine. About this time Mr. James Ramsey, who
had been the principal shareholder from the outset,
left the district owing to Tindarey Station having
changed hands. The syndicate then became disor-
ganised, work was suspended, the leases were, forfeited,
and, in fact, there was a general collapse, involving
the loss of a big lot of hard cash that had been spent on
the working. Another partner (Mr. F. H. Elworthy)
then proceeded to Sydney and persuaded Messrs. Hill,
Clarke & Co., the well-known stock agents, to join
him in re-taking up the ground. This they did, and the
land was held by them for some years ; a lot more
money was expended on it when they likewise let the
lease lapse on the advice of an expert whom they sent
up to report. Several other parties also came up from
Sydney to examine the property, but all, without
exception, condemned it—one expert going so far as
to report against it without even taking the trouble to
go down the shaft and examine the mine for himself.
The ground being again open, Mr. Goold, still having
confidence in it, met Henderson and arranged with him
to again re-peg the land. This was done and a syndicate
was formed to work it, consisting of the following
gentlemen, viz., Messrs. Joseph Weight, G.A. Bolton,
E. Holly, W. Middleton, Peter Matthews, M.
Henderson, and P. Goold. It may be mentioned
incidentally that Messrs. Holly and Middleton
retired from the syndicate before anything had been
found. Operations were again commenced and carried
on for seven or eight months without anything being
met with to reward their labors. It also happened that
about this time Messrs. Wright, Goold, and Bolton
had two men named Charles Wolfe and Alexander
Simb prospecting for alluvial gold on the flats adjoining
Billygoe Range, Eight or nine months were spent in


sinking shafts from 50 to 80 feet deep without bottom-
ing on the colour, and the company decided to knock off
this work and confine their attentions more particularly
to prospecting the reef. With this idea in view an
arrangement was made with Wolfe and Sime, giving
them a share each in the reef and 20s. per week wages.
Before this they had been working for their rations
and a share in whatever they found. Messrs. Weight
and Goold had up to this been managers of the mine.
They visited it regularly, and although they were
often laughed at by some of the wise people of Cobar
for the enthusiasm they exhibited over the mining
prospects of the district, yet the mining people there
have very much to thank these gentlemen for the zeal
and energy they have ever displayed in the develop-
ment of our mineral resources, having contributed very
largely indeed to the proud position Cobar now occu-
pies as the centre of an extensive and promising
mineral field. At this stage Mr. C. A. Chesney, C. 8.,
Tindarey, bought a share in the syndicate, and imme-
diately took a great deal of interest In the mine.
Being a practical assayer, he found strong indications
of payable silver in stone that had been taken out of
the shaft some seven or eight years previous to his
buying in. It may be said that prior to this prospect-
ing had been carried on for gold rather than for silver.
On finding the indications referred to, Mr. Chesney
proposed re-organizing the syndicate on a more
extended and satisfactory basis, with the result that a
new company was formed consisting of 100 shares of
£5 each, the old syndicate receiving fully paid-up
shares for their interest in the property ; all money
raised by the sale of the contributing shares going
to work the mine. The new company took charge
on the Ist December, 1887, the honorary management
being placed in Mr. Chesney’s hands ; and in about
one month after that date, gold and silver were struck
in a drive going south at the 90-foot level. Shares

immediately rose from their paid up value of £5 to
£3BO and £4OO. Directors and officials were ap-
pointed, an assessment of £5 per share was levied
(this realized £500), and with this sum and a small
overdraft from the bank, work has been successfully
carried on ever since. The Billygoe Company has
again been reorganized, with a nominal capital of
£5,000 in 5,000 shares of 20s. each, and its head-
quarters are in Melbourne. The main shaft is down
about 120 feet, while numerous drives have been put
in. The stone taken from the mine is in some places

From H tons of stone taken from the 90 feet level
by the present syndicate, and treated at the Ballarat
School of Mines, the average return per ton by ordinary
treatment was :


An equal quantity of stone was sent to Sandhurst for
treatment, the returns of which were not to hand on
publication of this pamphlet.
It is to be hoped that the Board of Directors of the
new company just formed will display that energetic
action which is so characteristic of enterprises eman-
ating from the southern metropolis, in the testing and
opening up of the mine, so that the shareholders may
get at a very early date that which is so anxiously looked
for by all mining investors—a good, fat dividend.
OTHER CLAIMS.
Several of the claims near Billygoe are being actively
prospected, the principal ones being Billygoe No. 1
South, Billygoe West, and Little Billygoe ; but so far
nothing of importance has been struck, although it is
said good prospects have been obtained in all. The
scarcity of water has retarded in a great measure the
development of the field.
COOCAR, OR MOUNT MARGARET.
The above lies about 5 miles west of Billygoe proper.
Several blocks have been taken up there, a few shafts
have been sunk, good prospects have been got, and it
■only requires capital to develope this field.
BALD HILLS.
This is another mining centre on Tindarey Eun, and
lies 30 miles west of Byerock, a station on the G-.W.
Eailway. Gold and silver have been found there.
Assays have yielded 7 ozs. 3 dwts. 8 grs. gold per ton,
and also a good return of silver. One peak of these
hills is locally called Mount Marvellous, and a syndi-
cate hold 110 acres under M. L. round it. The prospec-
ting lease has also given good assays, but so far very
little work has been done in any of the claims. A fine
opportunity is here offered for the investment of a little
capital with the prospect of a fair return at a very early
date.

THE GREAT COBAR COPPER MINE.
The discovery of the above rich mine was accidently
made, in 1870, by Messrs. Campbell, Hartman &
Gibbs, contractors, who hailed from the vicinity of the
Bogan River, and who arrived at Louth, River Darling,
same year. On arrival there it is said they were rather
hard up, and wanted to find the nearest track to Roto
Station, on the Lachlan River, via the “ Priory.” “ Old
Tom ” Matthews, as he is familiarly called—the
“ King of Louth,’’ —it is reported, gave the party a bag of
flour, | of a chest of tea, a bag of sugar, and sundry other
minor things, promising them at the same time when
they arrived at his station, Wuttagoona, en route , they
would also get half a bullock. He sent a black guide
with them to take the party direct to the Priory, and
20


on coming to where Cobar now is they camped for the
night, at a small watering-place which was then
situated not very many yards in front of the place
where the Star Hotel is now built. Troughs for
watering stock had been erected there to conserve the
little water there was. On the ground close to the
troughs a peculiar looking stone was picked up, which
an old man—one of the party—proclaimed to be one of
the richest copper specimens he had ever seen in the
colonies. The party then proceeded on their journey,
arriving in due course at the Priory Station, then in the
occupation of the Messrs. Raleigh, who, it may be said,
spent a fortune in unsuccessful well-sinking in that
country. About here they met Mr. and Mrs. Kruge, to
whom they showed the specimens taken from the tank
site, and the lady, being of Cornish extraction, and
consequently well versed in copper ores, declared that the
specimens shown to her were valuable, being rich in
copper. The old man, it is said, was discharged here,
and the balance of the party returned to Bourke. The
next we hear after the ground was taken up was that
Mr. Becker —an influential man in Bourke in those
days—had bought out the interest of Campbell and
party on behalf of what is now known as the Great
Cobar Copper Mining Co., Limited. We may inci-
dentally mention that the name Cobar is a corruption
of the word copper. Concerning the output of this
mine since the above-named company have been
working it, the following facts made up to time of
issue of last half-yearly balance sheet show that during
the 12£ years the mine has been in full swing,
The ore raised and smelted has been ... 195,000 tons.
From which was produced of fine copper... 22,252 do.
Valued in Sydney at ... ... ... £1,500,000
To produce this the firewood used equalled
850,000 tons, of value ... ... £287,000
While the wages paid to employees
amounted to £1,000,000


Carriage paid on copper to the railway... £BO,OOO
While the return loading from railway to
mine cost £llO,OOO
The trainage to and from Sydney and
railway terminus £140,000
Making a grand total of ... £1,617,000
the greater part of which has been spent in the dis-
trict. Dividends to the amount of £160,000 have been
declared. The average number of men employed
during the period mentioned has been about 400 ; while
the nominal value of the plant in actual use is £BO,OOO
About 1000 tons firewood are consumed weekly, and if
the current half-year’s returns were included the above
figures would show a material increase. E. N. Wil-
liams, Esq., is the popular manager of the mine, and
to his skill and judgment must be attributed to a great
extent the success that has attended the operations of
this Company during his connection with it, for it is
well known, and justly acknowledged by everyone who
has watched its progress, that that gentleman had ex-
ceptional difficulties to contend against when entering
upon his duties as manager some few years ago.

SIMPLE TESTS FOE MINERALS.
As we are rather pressed for space in this pamphlet,
we insert in a condensed though, we hope, in a clear
form, a few simple tests for minerals likely to be found
in payable quantities in the Cobar District.
SILVER.
The chlorides, bromides, and iodides of this metal are
not acted upon by acids, while native silver, sulphide of
silver, antimonial silver, ruby silver and arsenide of
silver are, therefore ores supposed to contain silver must
be treated by two methods to ensure certainty.
(1). If you have a stone which you suspect contains
silver in some form other than chloride, bromide or
iodide proceed to test as follows ; —Pulverize the
stone and boil a little of the powder for a few
minutes in a test tube over a spirit lamp with
some strong nitric acid (aqua fortis). Then filter
through a piece of clean blotting paper into a clean
test tube. Add to the liquid some spirits of salts,
or a solution of common salt and water, drop
by drop, and shake tube. If a white precipitate
forms the stone contains either silver, lead or mercury.
If the precipitate be white and curdy, and in sunlight
turns first violet and then black silver is present, the
white precipitate being chloride of silver. If, however,
very little silver be in the specimen the liquid only
assumes a milky-white opalescent appearance. On
standing for some time, the white chloride of silver
settles to the bottom. To further test for lead, filter
the liquid having the precipitate in it, and pour some
clean water on filter to wash away all traces of acid
from the precipitate which is left on the filter paper.
Then take precipitate, put it in the bottom of a clean
test tube, and add a little ammonia, and heat very
gently. This will dissolve all the chloride of silver,


and if a white crystalline powder be left lead is present.
If, however, the liquid becomes black on the addition of
ammonia this change indicates mercury. The silver can
be again reduced from the ammonia solution to the form
of chloride by the addition of a few drops of nitric acid.
(2). If you suspect the stone to contain chloride or
bromide of silver, put some of the powdered specimen
in a test tube with some of the solution of cyanide of
potassium ; apply heat for a few minutes, filter, and
add nitric acid to the filtered solution. The result will
be if silver be present, the white curdy precipitate of
chloride of silver same as in the first process. In both
the above cases the heavier the precipitate the richer
the specimen, and of course if one gets indications of a
good rich find it is desirable to employ a properly
qualified assayer, so as to get correct per centages of
the metal contained in the specimen under examination.
LEAD
Add to powdered specimen dilute nitric acid, and
boil. Then add spirits of salts ; if lead be present a
white crystalline precipitate appears, which does not
turn dark in sunlight, and is soluble in a large amount
of hot water.
COPPER.
Boil powdered ore as before in nitric acid, and add
when cool ammonia drop by drop. If copper be pre-
sent, the liquid first assumes a greenish hue, and on the
addition of more ammonia it becomes of a magnificent
rich azure-blue colour ; the deeper the color the richer
thespecimen in copper. If iron be present, the blue color
cannot be well seen till the reddish-brown precipitate
caused by the ammonia and iron settles. Then the blue
color appears on top of liquid. This azure-blue color
disappears on the addition of a solution of cyanide of
potassium. We may say that if the clean blade of a
pocket-knife be inserted in the azure-blue liquid it will
become covered with a coating of metallic copper.


NICKEL.
Test for this as for copper. On addition of ammonia,
drop by drop, the liquid shows the greenish-blue ap-
pearance as when copper is present; but, on adding
more ammonia, instead of the azure-blue due to copper
appearing, the liquid becomes more of a violet blue.
Nickel, however, does not coat the blade of a clean
pocket-knife as does copper.
COBALT.
Take two test-tubes, put a portion of powdered speci-
men in each, add spirits of salts to one and nitric acid
to the other. Boil both. In former, if cobalt be pre-
sent liquid turns green, colour disappearing on diluting
with water. In latter case liquid becomes of a light
red or pink color, which does not disappear on dilut-
ing with water.
COLD.
This metal is not acted upon by either nitric acid or
spirits of salt singly, but by a mixture of the two made
by adding one part of the former to four parts of the
latter. This is called “ Aqua regia.” Therefore, to
powdered specimen add some aqua regia, and boil in a
clean test tube for some time. Filter and add solution
of sulphate of iron (green vitriol), when pure gold, if
present, will be thrown down in a highly-divided state
as a brown precipitate. This, on standing, settles down
to bottom of test-tube, and may be made into the solid
state by taking out and smelting on charcoal by the
blow-pipe. As a confirmatory test, if chloride of tin
be added to the aqua regia solution, and if gold be pre-
sent, the liquid assumes a purple red coloration called
“ purple of Cassius.” It is always desirable to first roast
the stone if sulphur be present. The above are both
very delicate tests for the presence of the precious metal
—gold.
