(A DESCRIPTIVE.)
Ye muses leave castilia spring,
While I Glenara?s beauty sing,
Help me to paint both hill and dale,
Or none will listen to my tale ;
Ye deathless powers assist my pen,
While 1 describe Glenara?s glen.
H ere Nature with romantic taste,
The ever changing scene has drest;
Here the hills in beauty tumbled,
Broken rocks in fragments jumbled ;
Here woodland crowns the tow?ring height,
Then open lawns appear in sight.


Here over rocks the river pours,
The spray descends in gentle showers,
Then winding in the dale below
O?erhung by trees so smoothly flow ;
Upon its banks in shady grove,
Numerous flocks incessant rove ;
In careless sport the playful lamb,
Is bounding o?er the verdant lawn.
Upon a mound above the stream
A stately mansion here is seen,
Around it Nature?s rugged face.
Some skillful hand has decked with taste ;
Here Art with Beauty is combined
To please the cultivated mind.
In front is seen the terraced hill,
Is planted out with wondrous skill,
With flowers and trees from every clime,
Here luxurious grows the vine.
In spring when falls the genial showers,
When earth and trees are drest in flowers,
The breeze comes laden with perfume,
By robbing the mimosa?s bloom ;
Nor cares the secret it to hide,
But spreads the tidings far and wide.
The happy birds hop in the trees,
Among the flowers the wandering bees


Are humming at their daily toil;
?Gainst winter hoarding up the spoil,
Grant me such Paradise ye powers
To dwell within Glenara?s bowers
And breathe the honeyed breath of flowers,
Imagination backwards trace
The only rival to this place,
Was Eden?s bloom in earliest hour.
When earth put forth her virgin power,
E?er thorns, thistles, and noxious weeds
Appeared on earth for man?s misdeeds,
Unrivalled here Glenara stands,
Like work of an Enchanter?s hands
Now summer sheds a burning beam
The cattle seeks the cooling stream,
Retired within Glenara?s vale,
Secure from every scorching gale,
In shady bower a cool retreat,
Defence from Phoebus burning heat,
Employ your time with a choice book,
Away from care in some quiet nook ;
Or stroll about among the trees,
Beneath a canopy of leaves,
To the cool river if you wish
Angling, catch the incautious fish ;
Various pleasures here you find,


Enough to suit the various mind.
Now sober autumn comes to reign,
The fields are clad with ripening grain
Autumn here?s a joyful time,
The various fruits to gather in.
For Nature is not stinted here,
Abundance always crowns the year,
With clusters see the loaded vine,
The press o?erflows with rudy wine.
Now harvest treasures fill the stores,
The winter comes, hear how he roars
Upon the hills the trembling trees
Are bending to the western breeze,
Down in Glenara?s sunny glen
The wind just murmurs now and then,
Her fields are ever fresh and green,
Here beauties always grace the scene.

?Gilmore.?
It was on the twenty-fifth July,
The year was forty-one ;
We w'ent on board the ship ? Gilmore,??
Bound for the Australian strand.
Farewell unto our native land
To friends we leave behind ;
Farewell unto those youthful scenes
Engraved upon the mind.
The gripping hand of avarice,
Has forced us for to roam
Unto Australia?s sunny fields,
To seek a better home.
There we?ll be free, no slaves shall he
To any lord or king ;
O?er the sea in that new country,
There will be no such thing.


The purse-proud aristocracy
Among us will never come ;
We will live in peace and plenty
In our Australian home.
With axe we?ll make the forest fall,
And then we?ll plough the soil,
We?ll sow and reap, and then enjoy
The pleasure of our toil.
The Kangaroo we will pursue
Through forest and through fen ;
For surely no one will be there
Claiming it their game.
Our son?s will be a hardy race,
The guardians of our Isle ;
Our daughters will be virtuous
And cheer us with their smile.
No foe, though brave, shall e?er engage
To land upon our soil;
Or if they do, they soon will rue,
And backward then recoil.
May health and wealth attend all those
Destined with us to roam ;
Away, away, the good ship goes
To our Australian home.

some teses.
Dear friend, I?ve thought this while to write
A verse of rhyme or something like
To give my muse some recreation.
Lest she should die of sheer stagnation ;
I had to coax my stubborn muse
For to be plain she did refuse,
And said that I was surely hoaxing
Because she had no need of coaxing.
Who could write this fearful weather,
Very dull and wet together ;
?Twould be nought but melancholy
To write such stuff you know is folly,
Says I, my lass, we must be at it,
Or else we?ll very soon get whipit.
Yon lad among the woody glens
I bear?s been mending all his pens ;
No doubt but he intends to write
And soar away on fancy?s flight:
And try to get into renown
Yon little muddy splashy town.
Our village it must shine the best,
Our creeks and streams must all get drest,
With flowers and foliage by their side,


With sheep and herds at even tide,
With milk-maids singing at the pail
And ploughmen whistling through the vale
With singing birds and humming bees,
With lowly bush and lofty trees,
With gentle slope and towering height
And valleys pleasant to the sight,
Where cottages the slopes adorn
And chanticleer awakes the morn
With gardens full of fragrant flowers,
With cooling shade and sunny bowers
Where lovers live in endless bliss
Enjoying perfect happiness.

It was by a stream where mimosa?s were
blooming,
And scenting the air with their balmy perfume
I carelessly wandered one beautiful evening,
In spring when the flowers were all in full
bloom.
Craig Bank, oh thy charms to me are excelling,
There?s no place more lovely I ever have seen; \
Could I describe all the beauties that?s dwelling
Upon thy fair bosom, so lovely?s the scene.


Within the deep valley the creek lies em-
bosomed,
O?er hung by the bushes the stream glides
along ;
The smooth sloping banks crowned with trees
that are lofty
Would tempt you to wander the woodlands
among.
The birds joined in chorus sang sweet in the
bushes,
The busy flies danced o?er the pure limped
stream,
The water coots rustled among the green
rushes,
Gaudy flowers were glistering in the evening
beam.
Methought as I gazed on this scene of
such grandeur
That nothing could match it since Eden?s first
bloom ;
I felt quite enchanted as forth I did wander
To gaze on the beauties here nature has strewn.
How calm in this spot I could spend my life?s
evening
Away from the bustle and strife of the town ;
With a few choice books and the friend of my
bosom
I?ll ask of dame fortune no greater renown.

As musing I did lie
In Australia wild and woody,
No stars were seen on high,
The night it was dark and cloudy.
Thinking upon the time
When on Scotland?s hills I rambled,
On days that?s past lang syne,
Among the briers and the brambles.
How happy I was then,
Without either care or trouble,
Wandering through some glen,
Where the winding stream did bubble.
Listening unto the song
Of the mellow throated thrushes ;
Their notes they did prolong
On the banks among the bushes.
I never thought of home
?Till the evening sun descended ;
Oft times the eastern gloom,
With its shadows dark attended.
For fancy it was fed,
By the echo from the mountain,
While wandering through the glade
Or along the silver fountain.


Although those days are past,
And with the world I must struggle,
My pleasures still do last,
For I cherish thoughts that?s noble.
Though fortune it does mark
Us for a while to mourn ;
The night be long and dark,
The day it will return.
Let us keep up our heart,
Not give way to melancholy,
Nor brood o?er ills that?s past
For that is surely folly.

Temperance in eating is a very nice thing,
It?s temperance in drinking I mean for to sing;
The teetotal system I never thought good,
A drop of good wine helps digestion of food.
Or a glass of good brandy after you?ve fed,
With another small nobbier e?er you go to bed;
?Twill clear up your head, make your judg-
ment correct.


In lengthening your days, it may have some
effect,
For Solomon says, and he was a wise man,
If nigh to dispair you must take a good dram.
A great Scottish poet who ne?er was at college
Says it opens wit and fills us with knowledge.
With some other great men I also might quote
There?s one I will mention, his name it is Pope,
He says of good wine take an adequate lot,
It cheers up the grave, warms the fire of the
poet.
If I recollect rightly, I think there?s one
Who says with good wine you must nurse an
old man,
When his natural fire has begun to decay,
Artificial heat must be kept up they say,
If you want to live long and wish to be wise
Not drunkard nor totaler I strongly advise
In the midst of the stream your barque you
guide,
I do not like sailing too nigh either side.
There?s many will say, do not touch it at all,
You?ll get a bad habit and very soon fall,
Because a few ships have been tossed on the
shore.
Shall we never venture to sea any more ;
Because this or that man has got a bad wife
Shall we ever after live a bachelor life.
The totlar must have little faith in himself
Or else he?s a miser and fond of his pelf.
Wine is a luxury requiring much labor,
The working classes it greatly will favor,
As the wealthier classes can purchase the most
Because they can better abide by the cost.


New branches of industry we will require
To employ all those who are living by hire.
No doubt the production of grain very soon
Will be in excess of what we can consume,
No foreign market can be found for that stuff,
Must limit production to what is enough ;
And turn our attention to planting the vine,
And with our own labours produce our own
wine.
The teetotal system should we all adopt,
That branch of our business would come to a
stop ;
Th ese remarks I think will convince every
man,
That the temperate system?s the far better plan

Last week I took a trip to town,
?Twas business partly took me down ;
And faith, Sir, 1 got on the spree,
For I took nobblers two or three.


Drinking it always causes drought,
So I kept wetting at my mouth
?Till sense and reason nearly gone,
I took a ramble through the town.
In the left pocket of my coat,
A pair of boots quite new I?d got;
While by a wall I did me prop,
A sharper took me on the hop.
At the boots he made a scramble,
I could nothing do but wamble.
My whip, too, it was silver mounted,
Sure I looked quite disappointed,
To see my property all going,
My phiz I?ll be homewards showing;
Very soon I?ll be a shicer,
In the watchhouse I may lie, Sir.
Such lodgings are not respectful,
Sure the traps are not neglectful
To catch a cove when on the spree ;
And find him lodgings they call free.
But now my mind I had made up,
To go upon the homeward trip,
And when my home I then did reach,
My wife she did begin to preach
To me a very serious lecture,
I would sooner meet a spectre.
So I would have you all beware,
When to the city you repair,
Of nobblers O do take a care,
Or else you may get in a snare.
But when you?re on the homeward route
You then may take another shout;
Some will say I?m talking nonsense,
It?s all true upon my conscience.

Hamilton, thou man of knowledge,
No doubt but thou hast been at college ;
The learning that thy head contains
Tell?s us thy studies were not vain.
When we appear before thy sight,
Our faults are often brought to light ;
And when our heads thy fingers scan
Thou tellest the follies of each man.
And O, how wonderful correct
Our weaknesses you can detect;
The very feelings of the heart,
Are all laid open by thy art.
Sure thy friend will ne?er deceive thee,
Nor thy wife will ever leave thee ;
To go flirting with another,
Which often causes fearful bother.
No doubt the best you can?st select,
And those that?s not, thou mayest reject ;
Though they do their best endeavour,
To get themselves into thy favor.
You?re safe from each designing knave,
Who comes thy patronage to crave ;
Or he may want to share thy purse,
Which, when he gets, you get his curs


For if you lend such friend you?re money,
His friendship then?s not worth a penny ;
He?ll wish you far beyond his view,
He?ll sooner meet old n?k than you,
No doubt the murderer you detect,
And from his hands your life protect,
If sticker-up should e?re advance
I?m sure you know him at a glance ;
Then scour away along the street
As fast as you can lift your feet,
Until you reach some place that?s safe
And there, you then, may slack your pace
From fiends like those and many more
To name would make an endless score,
You?re safe as she, who wears the crown
Of England place of great renown.
Forme I?m wholly left to chance,
No art have I to guard against
The schems of base designing men
Or women rather worse than them,
In foresight I am almost blind,
It?s by experience I prove mankind,
But had I knowledge of your art,
I then might act another part;
I then would know who to credit,
Likewise with whom I should avoid it.
Insolvency become of late,
The ruling passion of the state ;
An easy way to pay our debts,
By giving up a few assets ;
Then swear by Jove that?s every cross
And make a scrawl about our loss.
But now I?ve something else in view 7,
A favor I would ask of you?


Dear Sir, if you would make collection
Of all the members for election,
I mean those gents to represent
Us in the coming Parliament,
And scan their heads with nice precision,
And tell us those we may put faith in,
Then we?ll abide by your direction,
And think them fit for our election.
Your science then will get established,
You need not fear the very ablest
Of all the anti-Phreno tribe
Or those who combat on their side.
David Blair with all his jargon,
Will ne?er upset thy argumentum ;
Your art is safe, you need not fear,
The bombastic stuff of David Blair.*

* Blair?s Lecture, ? Phrenology Exploded,?


Where hazels rife with nuts in clusters hung
By far more prized than either peach or plum.
With berries black and red we stain our face,
Until no likeness of ourselves we trace ;
With thoughtless steps young pleasures we
pursue.
Though oft enjoyed we found them always new.
Upon a flower, a gaudy butterfly
With gorgeous wings would catch the wander-
ing eye, _
With cautious steps to seize the wished for
prize,
We steal along towards it, lo! it flics.
Then helter-skelter every urchin run,
To catch the recreant dancing in the sun ;
?Mong joys like these our early da\s we pass,
Nor ever dream of what?s to come at last.
In thee I see the waterkelpie?s pool,
Where oft we dabbled when let loose from
school ;
And here imagination too might trace,
The waterkelpie watching in the place ;
For in the middle of the stream 1 see <l/ . (?']
A youth bare-legged upon a fallen tree :? Jf~C4
WhostTbranches rise above the shining stream,
Where he sits basking in the sunny beam.
A lady too on margin of the flood,
With rod in hand to catch the finny brood;
A noble yquth is standing by her side, Jpi/j J
In all the manliness of youthful pride: ,
The siren like with her bewitching wiles
Has lured him here within her easy toils.
A sportsman too I see with murdering aim,
Is dealing death armong the harmless game ;


He shows no pity to the feathered race
Who wander far through distant fields of space.
Though swift of wing and use their utmost
speed,
It scarce can serve them in their time of need ;
O shame on him who taught the wicked skill
To give the leaden shower its wings to kill.
The artist has been true to nature here,
Who made this glen-like living life appear ;
The silver wattle shining in the sun,
The soft acacia and the large red gum :
Here gentle slope, and there the towering
height,
With bush and brake and moss grown trees in
sight.
Great Master of the Photographic Art,
Who can to scenes like this such truth impart,
Shall surely gain a never dying name,
Enrolled ?mong heroes on the lists of fame.

Two chieftains both stout and bold,
Did take the field like Knights of old ;
Both clad in mail, from head to heel,
And both were armed with pointed steel
Not with the claymore as of old,
But with steel pens as I was told.


They both were come of ancient breed,
From Scottish hills, far north the Tweed;
One said that he could trace his line
From Fingal of the ancient time :
A chief renowned in Scottish song,
For deeds of might in days bygone.
The other, too, could trace his clan
From some great chief in Highland sang ;
They both had left their native land
And wandered to Victoria?s strand.
Sometime they led a peaceful life,
Tending their flocks ?mong pastures rife ;
When both grew rich with labors fruits
They must go fight about their brutes.
The chief of Helensville, a Knight,
Well known for prowess in the fight;
He had been in many a battle
Where pen and ink the strife did settle.
His shoulders broad, his brain was large,
Good at epistolary charge ;
His eye was keen, his locks were raven,
In former wars he proved no craven.
He was the owner of a steed,
The purest of the Clydesdale breed ;
A ship brought him from Britain?s isle,
The noble horse of Helensville.
He had won honors in his time
Before he crossed the tropic line.
For being the best of all his kind.
About this horse the strife arose,
Which made these chieftains deadly foes ;
O how I wish I had the power,
To describe the deadly shower
Of darts each chief had to repel,


Requiring all his art and skill.
For Cona?s chief, a man of might
Well-known in former paper fights;
No quarter he did ever crave
From any foe however brave.
How well he knew his darts to throw,
Likewise to guard the coming blow ;
He did not feat the verra deil
When armed with paper, ink, and steel.
His wily foe could fence as well,
And every charge he did repel :
Advantage neither chief could gain
All throughout this fierce campaign.
The Clydesdale campaign at an end,
Again the chiefs they did contend.
The seige of Cona next began,
About a bull the story ran,
For Cona?s bull was known to fame,
A gallant brute, Royal Hope, his name,
?Twas said he was of stock renowned,
And that his like could not be found
Throughout Victoria?s fruitful ground,
?Twas doubtful where this strife would end
For Coma?s chief could well defend ;
Though in his camp he was assailed,
In his defence he never failed.
My information here doth end,
But whether they did long contend
See Farmer?s Journal of that time,
It hath recorded every line.

�A Registrar of Slugs.
Dear Sir, this list 1 send to you,
Of all my dogs?they are but few ;
I?ve only one that?s come of age,
The other?s a pup I?ll engage :
The little brute?s a perfect mischief,
And often brings the house much grief.
The other day he killed a fowl,
And goodness how my wife did growl ;
His life wasn?t worth a lawyer?s honor,
If caught when the rage was on her.
At thieving he can have no match,
Except among that scoundrel batch
That?s at the Pentridge convict station
They are the worst in all creation.
The things the little beastie steals,
Are brushes, boots, and cotton reels ;
For what purpose be steals, if any,
It surely must be kleptomania.
He never eats them that I know,
They turn up in an hour or so ;
Therefore he?ll not go on your list,
Till the New Year I fairly trust.
Now I must describe the other,
Of late he?s grown a perfect bother


Imprimis then for his description;
A colley scotch on cats destruction,
Whether the native or domeestic,
He?s sworn to kill it if he (natch it.
His teeth are nearly worn tto stumps,
By tearing at the rotten truinks
Of trees wherein the brutess take shelter,
When he goes at them heltter skelter.
His color it is mostly blaclk,
Around his neck a whitisln track ;
To know him sure you camnot fail,
He?s likewise white on tipi of tail.
Upon his cheek he?s got ai scar,
I think he got in Venus? War
Those wars in which mem oft engage,
E?er they get married andl grow sage.
Captain?s the name of this strange beast,
He?s captain o?er the pup at least ;
His age I think it must be nine,
I?ve known him nearly all that time.
He was a neighbour?s dog of mine ;
Although he?s now in my possession,
I only hold him by permission.
This is a true and faithful list,
You?ll take my word (or it I trust;
With my own hand I?ve signed it truly,
Your most obedient D. Patullo.


Sonnet.
?T was by the margin of a lake
?Mong briers and thorns a tangled brake,
I found a sweet and lovely flower
As ever bloomed in shady bower.
Just such a flower I then did want,
Into my garden for to plant.
This flower it was my chief delight,
It was my care both day and night,
To see no noxious weeds appear
About the place where it grew near.
And when I crossed the briny sea
I took this flower along with me,
Unto Australia?s sunny clime,
Where it became a fruitful vine,
And many flowerets round it twine.
It blossoms still, and fragrance sheds.
And round my little garden spreads
A soft and balmy feeling there,
No flower with it can I compare.
