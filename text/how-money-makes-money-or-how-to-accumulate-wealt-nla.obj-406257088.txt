HOW MONEY MAKES MONEY!
How to accumulate Wealth honestly
and without risk.
HINTS AND ADVICE FOR THE CONSIDERATION
OF WAGE-EARNERS & SMALL CAPITALISTS.
The Proposition considered.
That “ money makes money ” is a jpropositiou generally
accepted as an axiom, so much so, that it has become a pro-
verb. Yet, of all those who so readily assent to the propo-
sition, how few really understand exactly what it means !
How few comprehend hoiv “ money makes money ! ”
The mere knowledge of, or belief in, the fact, or supposed
fact, contained in the proposition, never yet helped any man
to become rich, The knowledge of how “ money makes
money,” if rightly understood and practically applied, is the
finger post which points the road to fortune.
To avoid any possibility of misconception, it may be as well
to explain, just here, that if the proverb above quoted, be
taken literally, it is false. Money, of itself, has no power to
make money, and does not make it; it has no inherent
power of reproducing itself, as an animal or vegetable bas-
in short, it is not money , but human energy that makes
money


The Source of all Wealth.
Land is the source of all wealth; that is to say, land con-
tains all the latent possibilities of wealth. Food, clothing,
building materials, and the raw materials of all manufactured
products must come in the first place from the soil. All our
material necessaries, comforts, and luxuries come, either
directly or indirectly, from the land. But, although land
contains all the potentialities of wealth, or what may be
termed the raw material of wealth, none of these things are
wealth, properly so called, until labour has been brought into
contact with them.
Labour is the Creator of Wealth
Wheat does not grow into a loaf of bread; iron does not grow
into a steam engine; trees do not grow in weatherboard
houses and furniture ; nor do gold and silver grow into coin
and jewellery. Labor takes the raw material and transforms
it into the form of wealth desired. In this work, human
energy is aided to a great extent by machinery, which is itself
the product of labour.
Money is the Medium of Exchange.
By means of this medium, A can exchange a portion of the
products of his labor for a portion of the products of Z’s
labour, without having to go to Z personally to effect the
exchange. In this way, and in some few other ways, which
we need not now stop to consider, money facilitates exchange


and distribution, and therefore production also, and, in doing
this, it becomes of value in such a way, and to such an extent,
that it inevitably attracts to itself some portion of that wealth
which it thus assists to produce and distribute, which is again
exchanged for money. In this sense, and in this sense only,
is it true that “money makes money.”
Money must be Actively Employed.
Money does not make money if it is suffered to lie idle. Let
a capitalist lock up in his iron safe, we will say, £lOO,OOO, and
let it remain there undisturbed for twenty years, at the end of
that time it will still be £lOO,OO0 —not one penny more
than at first.
It is only when money is actively employed in aiding pro-
duction and distribution, either directly or indirectly, that it
has the power of increase. The capitalist knows this, and there-
fore he does not suffer his thousands to remain idle and un-
productive in his iron safe, he keeps his money moving, by
putting it into various reproductive investments, or he
entrusts it to others who do so, and he reaps his reward in the
shape of “ profit ” or “ interest.”
Given a right employment of his money and his thousands
become tens of thousands, as time rolls on, his tens of
thousands become hundreds of thousands, or even millions, if
sufficient time be allowed.
Why the Capitalist does not need to labour.
It is not necessary that the capitalist himself should actively
employ his money, whether he uses it or employs another man


to use it, or entrusts it to some other man to make use of, is a
matter of no consequence so long as it is in use. Hence it is
that the capitalist has no need to work himself, for, virtually,
his money is working for him.
Take the World as it is.
Whether the conditions of existence which allow the
capitalist to lead an idle life are right or wrong, is a question
which we need not debate. The task which we have set our-
selves is not the discussion of ethics ; but the teaching you, if
you are willing to be taught, how to get along in the world
as it is.
That “ money does not make happiness ” is perfectly true ;
but, all other conditions being equal, he who has sufficient for
his needs stands a better chance of happiness than he who
has to fight a life-long battle with grim and crushing poverty.
It is all very well to preach that “contentment is great
riches,” if your conditions of existence are such that you have
all that you can reasonably enjoy, and are trying to make some
poor, half-starved child believe that he or she should be
content with hunger and thirst in place of food and clothing.
But contentment is not riches, either small or great; it is not
even a good substitute for riches. Contentment never
initiated any progress in this world ; it never even helped
along any progressive movement. If you want people to
progress, you must make them discontented, not contented,
with their lot in life, and then show them how to better it.
Hence it is that we purpose teaching you, if you are willing
to learn, how “money makes money.” If you will patiently
follow us through this little book, we undertake to show you
how you may become wealthy by perfectly honest means, and
without running any risk.


We are not going to tell you any fairy tale of how a penny
became a million pounds sterling, or how a poor hoy who
landed in this great city of Sydney thirty years ago, with only a
shilling in his pocket, became one of our “ merchant princes.”
Common Sense.
Believing our readers to be sensible people, we are going to
write common sense. We will commence by laying down a
few incontrovertible axioms.
1. The prosperity of a nation or community depends
upon the general prosperity of the people.
2. All those conditions of existence which assist the
working classes to rise above the necessity of con-
tinuous toil, are valuable auxiliaries in the progress
of our modern civilization.
3. Every institution which helps a man to improve his
social position, and achieve independence, is a good
institution.
In view of these facts, those institutions known as Savings
and Deposit Banks occupy an important position in our social
machinery, and do very valuable work.
That the command of a large amount of capital enables a
man to secure higher profits, all other things being equal,
than can be obtained by the man who has only a small capital
to work on, is a fact so generally understood that it scarcely
needs to be stated.
The man who has only a £5-note to invest rarely has any
chance of embarking in any very profitable venture or enter-
prise. The sum is too small to be of much practical use.
Comparatively, very few forms of investment are open to him ;
and those which are open are not the most profitable. He
must consider himself fortunate if his money returns him a
profit, or interest, of two, three, or four per cent, per
annum.


On the other hand, the man who has £lOO,OOO at command
usually has a very wide choice of investments, and can select
from them many which are highly profitable. With such a
capital at command, it is nothing very unusual for a man to
make a profit of from 20 to 100 per cent, per annum.
Under these circumstances, then, the working man is neces-
sarily at a disadvantage. The few shillings which he can
spare from his hard-earned wages are not sufficient to enable
him to invest directly in reproductive and profitable modes of
utilising money, except in rare instances, and under excep-
tional circumstances.
The Work and Worth of Savings and
Deposit Banks.
Right here, the Savings Bank steps in to help him. His
few shillings, taken by themselves, would probably be as use-
less and impotent in the hands of the Savings Bank as in his
own ; but the aggregate of the amounts paid in by hundreds,
or, perhaps, thousands of his fellow workmen, is a consider-
able sum, by aid of which the Bank is enabled to acquire an
interest in many highly profitable investments.
Thus a small sum which, by itself, would be insufficient
for any profitable investment, becomes, by the addition of
numerous other small sums, capable of profitable employ-
ment.
Consequently, the amount, which in your own hands, would
be unproductive, and therefore unprofitable, is capable of
returning you a profit, when combined with other sums in the
operations of the Savings Bank; and you receive from it a profit,
called “interest,” which it never could have earned if it had
remained in your own hands.


lu this way the Savings Bank does good work. It enables
the working man and small capitalist to secure some of the
profits obtainable from| large investments, which otherwise
would become the exclusive property of larger capitalists. It
thereby tends to equalise the distribution of wealth, and to
hold in check the excessive and oppressive power exerted by
the concentrated capital of the millionaire or other large
capitalist. It helps the wage earner and other wealth-
producer to secure a fairer share of the wealth which he
assists in producing; and enables him to improve his social
position, and become an independent and self-supporting
member of the community, instead of becoming a burden and
drag upon it.
Discrimination Required.
But all Savings Banks are not equally good. All invest-
ments are not equally profitable ; nor are all equally safe: and
it generally happens that the safest investments are the least
profitable, and that those which promise extra large profits
are risky in proportion.
Some Banks do a large amount of very risky business;
these, as a rule, return large profits for a time, but end by
making a smash. Other Banks confine their operations
entirely to perfectly safe business, and invest only where the
security is of the best; these, as a rule, do not make very
large profits, and, consequently, return a lower rate of
interest.
Heuce the different rates of interest allowed by different
Banks, and hence, also, the very different stability of
different Banks.


A Commercial Proverb.
In the' commercial and financial world, it has become a
proverb that “High Interest means Doubtful Security.”
This proverb, as a rule, expresses a literal fact : but there are
few rules to which there are no exceptions : consequently, it
does sometimes happen that very large profits are obtained
from perfectly safe investments; and a Bank which can com-
bine large profits with perfectly safe investments can offer a
high rate cf interest with unimpeachable security.
But, to obtain this desideratum, exceptional business capa-
bilities are required, as well as the command of a large capital.
Hence it is that what are generally known as private Banks —
that is those where the Proprietary consists of only one or two
wealthy individuals, who devote their whole experience and
attention to their own business —have generally been found
so much more stable and reliable than those owned by limited-
liability companies ; where both have been allowing a high
rate of interest.
How to choose your Bank.
It should ever be remembered that absolute security is the
first and most important essential: the rate of interest being
a secondary consideration. Of what benefit would it be to you
to get 10 per cent., say for a year or two, if you then lose your
principal ? Lower interest and better security would be far
better for you. If one Bank offers you only 5 per cent, and
perfect safety, and another offers you 10 per cent, but only
doubtful security; you will do well to choose 5 per cent, and
safety. But if a third Bank can offer you, say, per cent, com-
bined with the very maximum of financial stability, you


would be foolish if you refused the offer, as the extra 3| per
cent, per annum would amount to a considerable sum in a
few years.
An Illustration,
To illustrate this point, we will suppose that you place £2O
on fixed deposit for three years at 5 per cent., and, in another
bank, another £2O, for the same term, at per cent.; and we
will further suppose that you allow the interest to accumulate
in the Bank. At the end of the term your 5 per cent, deposit
will be worth £23 Bs., while your per cent, one will be
worth £25 10s. 10d.; or £2 7s. lOd. more than the other. If,
instead of withdrawing, you allow them to remain untouched
for ten years, the first will be worth £32 11s. 2d.; and theother,
£45 9s. 4d. At the end of twenty years, the divergence will
be still more marked ; the amount withdrawable in the one case
being £53 Os. 2d., while in the other it rises to £lO2 15s. lOd.
An “Eye-Opener.”
To make this point still clearer, we will suppose that your
deposit has in each case been £lOO, instead of £2O ; and we
will call the 5 per cent, deposit “No. 1,” and the other “ No,
2.” At the end of three years, No. 1 is worth £ll5 15s. 3d.
but No. 2 is worth £127 14s. fid. At the end of ten years,
No. lis worth £162 17s. fid.; No. 2 is worth £226 Is. 9d. At
the end of twenty years the difference has increased amazingly,
No. 1 being then worth £265 ss. Bd., while the value of No. 2
has risen to £5ll Bs. fid. : a difference in favour of the higher
rate of no less than £245 17s. lOd , or considerably more than
double the amount originally deposited.


Another Lesson
Of this sum of £5ll Bs. 6d., the original deposit being only
£lOO, the amount of interest is shown to be £4ll 3s. 6d., or
more than four times the amount of the deposit. In the other
case, the interest is only £165 ss. Bd., or considerably less
than double the original deposit.
These facts fairly illustrate the immense advantage of the
higher rate of interest, supposing the security in each case to
be equally good.
They also illustrate, to some extent, how, by means of the
power of compound interest, “ money makes money.”
Tables K and L, at the end of this book, will show the value
at the end of any given number of years, from one up to
twenty, of deposits of £2O and £lOO respectively, at 5,6, 7,8,
and per cent, per annum, compound interest.
It may he as well, perhaps, to point out here the difference
between simple interest and compound interest. For the
benefit of the uninitiated, we may explain that “simple
interest ” is where the interest is withdrawn when due, in
which case, of course, only the interest on the principal sum
is received; “compound interest” is where the interest is
added to the principal sum and receives interest therewith at
the same rate.
We have already seen that the compound interest accruing,
during twenty years, on a deposit of £lOO, at per cent., is
£4ll Bs. 6d. The simple interest on the same sum, for the
same term, and at the same rate, is only £l7O ; consequently
the balance, £241 3s. 6d., is interest on the interest. Similarly
we have seen that, in the other case, the compound interest on
a similar sum for the same term, at 5 per cent., is £165 ss. Bd.
The simple interest on the same sum, for the same term, and
at the same rate, is £lOO ; consequently, £65 ss. Bd. represents
the interest on the interest.


It follows, therefore, that, though even in simple interest
the advantage of the higher rate is not to be despised, the gain
at compound interest is still more in favour of the higher rate.
A Contrast.
The table given below will serve to illustrate the difference
between simple and compound interest, and also between the
different rates.

Tables A, B, 0, D, E, and F, at the end of this book, show
the value, at the end of any number of years up to twenty, of
various amounts, from £2O up to £lO,OOO, at 8J per cent, per
annum. These tables explain themselves.
The above illustrations, and the Tables cited, deal only with
fixed deposits, so we will now turn our attention to the Savings
branch of these institutions.
Making a Start.
It is not of much use to tell a man what £2O will be worth
to him under certain given conditions, if he has not the £2O
to start with ; unless you at the same time show him how he
may obtain that sum : so we now purpose giving some informa-
tion on that point.
There are Savings Banks which will receive any small sum,
from one shilling upwards, and allow interest thereon ; the
amount deposited being withdrawable at call.
In this case, as in that of fixed deposits, the rates of interest
allowed by various Banks differ widely ; and from the same
causes.
We will therefore take the case of a Bank which allows
interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum on such accounts,
and computes the interest on the monthly balances.
it will be observed that this rate is much lower than that
allowed for fixed deposits. That is because the money cannot
be so profitably invested, owing to the fact that it may be
demanded at any time, without previous notice; whereas,
investments which yield large profits usually require the un-
interrupted use of the money for long periods.


What 10s. per Week will do.
We will now suppose that you are able to save 10s, per week.
If you keep it in your own hands, it will amount to £26 at the
end of the year. But if you place it each week in a Bank,
such as that referred to above, it will amount to £26 16s, lOd.
by the end of the year. Withdraw that sum ; place it on
fixed deposit at 8J per cent, per annum; and continue your
saving. By the end of your second year, you have another
£26 16s. lOd. saved ; and you have also your fixed deposit of
a similar amount, which, adding the interest which will have
accrued, will be worth £29 2s, 6d. You now place the second
year’s savings on fixed deposit. At the end of the third year,
your first fixed deposit will be worth £3l Us. lOd.; your second
will be worth £29 2s. 6d. ; and you will have £26 16s. lOd,
in hand, as the savings of the third year ; total, £B7 11s, 2d.
Of this sum all that you have saved is £7B ; the remainder,
£9 11s. 2d., is interest.
Continue this course for twenty years, from the date of your
fixed deposit, and you will find, on the completion of
the twentieth year, that you are worth no less a sum than
£1435 14s. lOd. You have been saving during twenty-one
years ; consequently, you have saved £26 x 21 years, or £546.
Tina sum, then, is all that you would have been worth at the
end of twenty-one years of saving, if you had depended on
saving alone ; but, by taking advantage of the facilities for
investment afforded by the Bank, your £546 has become
£1435 14s. lOd. Deducting from this latter sum the £546
actually saved, you have £BB9 14s. lOd. as the interest on your
savings, or, in other words, as your share of the profits
obtained by the use of your money.
One other point is worth noting, before we proceed further.
We have been assuming, of course, that you have suffered
your interest to accumulate in the Bank ; as the £BB9 14s, lOd


mentioned, is evidently compound interest. Had you with-
drawn the interest as it became due, you would only have had
the nett amount of your savings to withdraw, at the end of the
twentieth year, plus one year’s interest. The total amount
which you would have received as interest on this plan would
have been about £420 ; so the difference between that and the
amount received shows about £469 as interest on your interest.
In other words, the compound interest on your savings during
the twenty-one years is about £469 more than the simple
interest.
What you can do with it.
If you were to allow this sum of £1435 14s, lOd, to remain
in the Bank, at the same rate of interest, it would yield
you an income of £l2l 19s. 7d. per year, without adding
another shilling to it; and you would still have the principal
—£1435 14s. 10d., to leave behind you at death. Or, if you
have no relations or friends to whom you would wish to leave
money, you could invest in the purchase of an annuity; the
amount of which would depend upon your age at the time.
Or you could utilise it in starting some profitable business.
Here, then, you have a fair exposition of some of the ad-
vantages offered by a sound and well-conducted Savings
and Deposit Bank.
Table G, Parts 1 and 2, illustrates what may be done by
saving ss. or 10s. per week, and transferring the amount to
fixed deposit at 8£ per cent, at end of each year. Tables H,
I, and J, show the results to be obtained by a yearly deposit
of £25, £BO, £35, £4O, £45, £5O, £6O, £7O, £BO, £9O, or £lOO.
All these tables are based upon the assumption that the
interest is allowed to accumulate in the Bank to the end of
the term. If the interest is withdrawn, the result, of course,
will be very different ; as already explained.


Practical Application.
Just as it is of not much use to tell a man what can be done
with £2O if he has not that sum ; so, also, it would be mere
folly to take the trouble of explaining the advantages of 84 per
cent, over 5 per cent., if the higher rate was unobtainable.
The next step in our lesson, therefore, is to tell you where
you may obtain this comparatively high rate of interest.
The Austral Banking and Land Proprietary, whose circular
accompanies this work, is now offering the rates of interest
which we have quoted; namely, 6 per cent, on savings, and
per cent, on fixed deposits.
What these high rates mean to the investor will be best
understood by studying the tables which appear at the end of
this book.
Motives.
The main object of the Austral Banking and Land Pro-
prietary in offering these high rates of interest, is the
encouragement of thrift. No pretence of philanthropy is
made in saying this, as some might suppose. It is purely a
matter of business ; business conducted on more enlightened,
far-seeing, and liberal lines than are generally adopted, it is
true, but straightforward business all the same.
To understand this, a little explanation may be necessary.
The Conditions of National Prosperity.
National Prosperity is not obtained by the accumulation of
the wealth of the community in the hands of a few individuals,


to the impoverishment and degradation of the working-classes,
whose labour produces that wealth. The piling up of collossal
fortunes in idle hands, while the mass of the wealth producers
were thereby pauperised and enslaved, never yet produced
national prosperity. The history of all the countries which
have risen to power and importance, only to fade away and drift
to ruin, emphasizes this fact. ✓
National prosperity can be obtained only by the general
prosperity of the majority of the individuals forming the nation
or community.
It is obvious, too, that it is easier to make money, honestly,
in a properous community, than in an impoverished one.
Hence, business men who seek to diffuse prosperity generally
throughout the community in which their business operations
are carried on, are not sacrificing their own interests to a
mistaken idea of philanthropy, as less enlightened people
might imagine, but, on the contrary, are really studying their
own best interests in the most far-seeing and effective way.
Why People Remain Poor.
There can be no doubt in the mind of any observant person
but that there are thousands of people in these colonies who
could well afford to invest in laud, and thereby ultimately
achieve independence, if they would only practice thrift and
economy. Thousands of families fritter away in useless trifles
more money than would suffice to render them independent
in the course of a few years, if saved and invested as here
indicated, or laid out judiciously in the purchase aud improve-
ment of a small freehold.
But, while each week’s or month’s income is dissipated as
soon as received, these people can never become freeholders ;
nor can they ever rise above their present social positions.


On the contrary, the vast majority sink yearly lower and lower
until they become paupers, and burdens on the community in
which they reside ; the remainder are condemned to lives of
continuous and hopeless toil to obtain the means of subsistence.
If these people can be induced to save the money which is
now frittered away on useless trifles, you will soon have them
in the market as customers for small freeholds, to the manifest
benefit of themselves and the community at large.
Hence, the object which the Austral Banking and Land
Proprietary has in view, in endeavouring to encourage thrift,
is seen to be the enlarging of the possible sphere of its already
extensive land business.
Interest and Security.
The highly profitable character of the investments of this
Proprietary enables it to offer the very liberal interest of 8J per
cent, per annum, on fixed deposits of £2O, or over, placed in
its hands for one, two, three, or more years; while the vast
extent of its operations, and its unrivalled facilities for securing
good investments, enable it to profitably employ an almost
unlimited amount of capital.
Its investments in freehold laud already amount to over
£200,000, and the business is daily increasing; so it is evident
that it has ample scope for the employment of a vast amount
of money.
The high rate of interest offered is not obtained by embarking
in risky speculations, nor by any financial jugglery ; but by the
power given by the ability to command a large capital; by
economy in working expenses ; by judicious selection of invest-
ments; and by the advantages obtained by the personal attention
and supervision of the proprietors being given wholly to the
business.


Freehold land being the very best security for the invest-
ment of capital, and the operations of The Austral Banking
and Land Proprietary being confined exclusively to freehold
land, it follows that no better security can be obtained.
Here, then, we have the very maximum of security com-
bined with a rate of interest usually obtainable only from very
risky investments.
Further information on these points may be obtained from
the circular of the Proprietary, which will be found at the end
of this book.
Our Advice.
Those, therefore, who wish to make provision for their old
age, or, better still, to achieve independence before old age
overtakes them, cannot do better than take advantage of the
facilities offered by The Austral Banking and Land Proprietary,
by saving each week or month whatever they can spare from
their income, depositing such amounts in the Savings depart-
ment, where interest will be allowed on monthly balances at
the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, and, at the end of each
year, or other convenient period, transferring the amount so
obtained to a fixed deposit account, which will bear interest at
the rate of 82 per cent, per annum.
Those who are in a position to immediately make a fixed
deposit of £2O or more, of course, need not wait to save up
that amount; these would do wisely in immediately availing
themselves of the chance of obtaining the high rate of interest
offered, before a fall in the market value of money reduces
that rate : for though, in the hope of encouraging thrift, and
thereby enlarging the possible sphere of its operations, The
Austral Banking and Land Proprietary are now offering much


above the market rate, it is not to be supposed that it will
continue to offer the same high rate in the event of any really
important decline in the market value of money.
Worth Noting.
Although we have here dealt exclusively with Savings and
Deposit Banks, and the advantages which they offer, there is,
of course, no necessity for a man to leave his money in the
Bank all his life. If he sees an investment within his means
which will give him higher returns, he can withdraw his
money from the Bank, and re-invest it as seems to him best.
All we insist on is the fact that such a Bank offers to the wage-
earner, small capitalist, and many other classes, the first step
to wealth ; a step which renders all subsequent steps possible,
and practically places within the reach of the wealth-
producers a larger and fairer share than they could otherwise
obtain of that wealth which their energy and intelligence have
assisted to produce: and that it offers to those whose previous
experience has not fitted them to engage in commercial
pursuits, or speculative business, a means of investing their
capital so as to obtain the largest possible returns consistent
with perfect security.

Note.— As the year contains 52 weeks, it is obvious that each
quarter will contain 13 weeks ; each third month, therefore, is
calculated to contain a fifth week: hence the extra rise in
amount. It will be seen that the total amount at end of j ear
is £l3 Bs. 4d. at ss. per week, or £26 16s. lOd. at 10s. per
week. These amounts are now placed on fixed deposit at
per cent, per annum, and the same amount per week saved
during each subsequent year, and similarly dealt with at the
end of the year, with the result shown in Part 2.

To Depositors.
The Austral Banking and Land Proprietary respectfully
submits to the consideration of depositors and the public in
general, the following reasons why it should receive their
confidence and support :
1. It is not a Limited Liability Company, but a partnership
of a limited number of wealthy and successful business men,
whose whole capital is invested in, and whose whole time,
skill, and attention are devoted to the successful conduct of,
its business; and whose liability to its constituents and clients
is unlimited.
2. It carefully avoids all risky business, such as is too often
indulged in by Banks, Land and Building Societies, and other
Limited Liability Companies, and invests its funds solely in
freehold land, which is generally admitted to be the very best
of all securities. Its commercial soundness, therefore, is only
equalled by Government Savings Banks, whose stability is
guaranteed by the Government of the country, but who, owing
to the less profitable nature of their business, are unable to offer
so high a rate of interest.
3. In spite of the unexampled depression prevailing during
the last two years throughout the colonies, the business of this
Proprietary has all through that time maintained a steady, yet
rapid, growth, and has become increasingly profitable.
4. The management is not, as in the case of most Limited
Liability Companies, entrusted to a mere salaried servant, but
is in the hands of one of the chief proprietors, whose whole
capital is invested in the operations of the Proprietary ; whose
whole interest it is to ensure the success of those operations ;
and whose great experience and success in the conduct of the
business sufficiently guarantee his competence to manage the
affairs of the Proprietary.


5. The rate of interest guaranteed to depositors is higher
than can be offered by any other firm or company whose
operations are confined to equally safe business.
6. This high rate of interest is obtained, not by undertaking
risky business, nor by indulging in any illegitimate forms of
speculation or financial jugglery, but by (1) careful and
judicious selection of only perfectly safe and immediately
reproductive investments ; (2) by keeping the capital constantly
employed, and, therefore, constantly “earning;” and per-
mitting no unproductive accumulations of idle capital, either
in cash or property, which merely eat up the earnings of the
active capital; and (3) by minimising working expenses.
This latter is accomplished by employing only thoroughly
competent men, each one of whom is a specialist in the work
of the department under his control, and yet sufficiently
conversant with the work of all other departments to be able to
give efficient assistance in those departments in the event of
any extra pressure of work in any one of them.
7. Balance sheets and detailed statements relating to the
business of this Proprietary, are periodically submitted to the
Board of Reference, which is composed of gentlemen whose
business knowledge and experience are undoubted, and whose
integrity in matters of business is unimpeachable. Any or all
of these gentlemen may be referred to as to the stability,
prosperity, and bona Jides of this Proprietary, and its methods
of conducting its business.
8. Having command of a large capital, having exceptional
facilities for securing the safest and most profitable investments,
conducting its business at the very minimum of cost consistent
with efficiency, and being under no obligation to provide large
dividends for an army of shareholders, nor to dissipate profits
in paying large fees to a numerous body of directors, this
Proprietary is in the fortunate position of being able to allow


to investors a far higher rate of interest than can possibly be
paid by any Limited Liability Company which refrains from
risky business.
9. No “ White Elephants ” or unsaleable properties are
ever handled by this Proprietary, as is proved by the rapid and
highly profitable sales of all properties hitherto submitted by
it. This rapid turn-over of capital is, as every business man is
aware, equivalent to much larger profits on slower sales, and
is, besides, an important element of stability.
10. The heavy expenditure on mere puffing advertisements,
ncurred by nearly all Limited Liability Companies, is entirely
avoided by this Proprietary, experience having shown that the
confidence and recommendation of its numerous clients and
customers are the most effective forms of advertising.
To sum up, the points on which the Austral Banking and
Land Proprietary bases its claims to public favor and confidence
are :
The unlimited liability of the Proprietary; the absolutely
safe character of its business ; efficient management, which
has enabled it to grow and prosper in spite of depressed times ;
economy in working expenses ; careful selection of investments ;
quick turn-over of capital; exceptional facilities for securing
absolutely safe and highly profitable investments; large
capital, and the ability to profitably employ almost unlimited
funds; no sinecures, and freedom from the drag of directors
fees and shareholders’ profits.
One more point deserves notice. Having no directors and
shareholders to absorb the bulk of the profits—as is the case
with all Limited Liability and Joint Stock Companies—the
whole of the nett profits are re-invested, and practically become
a strong and constantly increasing reserve fund. The only
withdrawals from gross profits are, therefore, actual working
expenses—which, as we have seen, are as low as is compatible
with efficiency—and the interest paid to depositors.


Balance sheets and Auditor’s Reports are periodically
forwarded to all depositors, as well as to the Board of
Reference.
Any further information required may be obtained, on
application, by letter addressed to—
The General Manager,
The Austral Banking & Land Proprietary,
Carington Chambers,
SO & 32 Castlereagh Street,
Sydney.
