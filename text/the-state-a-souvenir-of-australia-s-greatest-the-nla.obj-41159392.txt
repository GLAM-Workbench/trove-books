A GREAT theatre is like a great Thought: it is created
in Beauty from Beauty, and its paths are paths of \ *
Joy, of Happiness, of Delight. There can be no
dark clouds to dim its radiance as there can be no sinister
doubts to shatter the wonder of a thought that is so
sincerely sweet and truly great.
So with this State Theatre which we present to you our \
patrons and our friends. To us, the State is both a great
Thought and a great Theatre. ...

The Saracenic or Moorish
exterior of The State becomes
a landmark on the skyline of
Melbourne, the Queen City

It is a great Thought because it has been created from
the brains and hearts of an Australian body of theatre
folk, who, realising the interest taken by Australians in
their places of entertainment, wanted and strove to present
some bigger house of pleasure than has been known in
this city or this Commonwealth. In that aim we found
our great Thought.
It is a great Theatre because it represents the inspiration

of its planners. But more it is a great Theatre because
it is itself.
There is but one State. Never teas a theatre so beautiful,
or its glory so dearly bought but that it fades into
insignificance beside this Florentine garden of music, of
picture, of song.
As you entered, as our Attaches of whom we are
proud, conducted you to your reservations, you saw the
statuary which cost a fortune to procure; the graceful
sweep of the Florentine Garden, the blue of the vault
above you, the tone poem of our interior color scheme.
You will hear the mighty State Wurlitzer organ which
Frank Lanterman at the Major and Renee Lees at the
Minor console will dominate; the State Unit Orchestra
of 30 on the elevator platform, the band on the stage
which Leon Rosebrook will conduct. You will rest in the
melodic softness of the theatre lighting, and your mind
refreshed, will prepare to revel in the living dramas to be
produced, as you sink in the seats which are world-famous.
By your appreciation will we who have made the State
possible know that we have not failed. You are our
critics and by your tastes we shall be governed.

WHILE originality is that which makes men and things, from
cabbages to kings, outstanding, it may, on the other hand,
be that which makes men and things merely bizarre, and
ultimately ridiculous. Thus the wise and proper course is to aim
high, and in this fashion is introduced the State Theatre.
The magnificent proscenium, which is unique so far as this new-
style atmospheric theatre is concerned, finds a place in the gorgeous
decorative scheme. On either side of the proscenium real Cyprus
trees have come to life, and on the dark red tiles of the roof several
white pigeons have found a resting place, creating an atmosphere of
a new and beautiful World which seems to captivate your senses.
Just above the roof of the proscenium is the blue vault of the
Mediterranean sky, with stars twinkling, clouds floating by as if in
silent admiration of the beauty encased in the creeper-clad walls.
High above the gorgeous Florentine proscenium stands Venus di
Medici. A most marvellous copy of one of the world?s greatest
pieces of statuary, this figure, nine feet in height, commands
considerable attention.

THE magnificence of Australia?s greatest theatre ?The
State ?is overwhelming, for the Florentine beauty of
its interior with the great vault of blue sky overhead,
has never been equalled before.
One of the main features of the theatre is the Florentine
Temple in the overhanging garden, located on the right of
the proscenium. You will be amazed at the glory of the
panorama as you look towards the Temple, which has been
built on similar lines to those erected in Florence gardens.
Brightly colored in keeping with the lower walls of the
garden the Temple presents an awe-inspiring sight. White
pigeons and love-birds appear to be fluttering to rest on its
roof, which is supported by five massive carved columns.
In the centre of the Temple and placed on a solid pedestal
is a wonderful piece of statuary ?Venus de Capua. The
original of the statue is in the Naples Museum. The type
is that of Nike writing on a shield the names of those she
delights to honor or the record of their deeds.


Constantly striving for the
goal of perfection-?never rest-
ing on past laurels ?Packard

which led to the introduction
of the first Twin-Six in 1913

achievement ?

have just been introduced ?
Packard presents to the public

years of manufacturing fine
motor cars.

It will be unique in the history of the motion picture

was modelled about the year 1513, and was
originally one of a number of figures intended
to decorate the lower stage of the never-
completed monument of Julius 11.
The genius of the sculptor is particularly
shown in the way in which the figure seems
to surrender himself to the inevitable in an
exhaustion that seems to be more mental than
physical. The figure represents humanity in
its struggle against the limitations imposed
upon it.

there are traces of a shield, and about

Venus De Milo
THIS classic figure, armless and other-
wise damaged, is known to everybody.
It is an anonymous masterpiece, hav-
ing been found in 1820 in the island of Milo,
the ancient Melos. It is now in the Louvre.
This statue has been the subject of a con-
siderable amount of controversy, due largely
to the uncertainty as to what the action of
the arms intended to be and also because of
equal doubt as to the general purpose of the
statue as a figure, or as one of a group. Yet
it could not have received more admiration or
given greater artistic pleasure were it com-
plete and in its undoubted original condition.
In the Louvre the figure has been the
recipient of homage by multitudes of visitors.
The true goddess of love, who made her and
when? Who is she?
In a position of prominence the State copy
may be admired in a niche in the Florentine
Foyer, adjacent to the Pompadour Room.

Atlas
IN Greek mythology Atlas is known
as one who knows the depths of
the sea and keeps the tall pillars
which hold the heavens and the earth
asunder. Later Atlas was represented
as a king rich in flocks and herds and
owner of the garden of Hesperides,
ATLAS
which was turned into a rocky mountain.
Finally he was explained as the name of a
primitive astronomer who was said to have
made the first crystal globe.
The figure, well known through history,
presents a unique picture in its setting on the
wall of the right Stairway at the entrance to
the Florentine Foyer.

Discobolus
Discovered at Coiombaro,
near Rome, by Gaven Hamil-
ton, and placed in the Vati-
can by His Holiness Pius VI, the
figure of Discobolus represents a quoit
player in the attitude of measuring his
distance.
Discobolus is mentioned by Pliny
as the work of the Argive sculptor
Nancydes, The figure described by
competent authorities as an excellent
piece of work, occupies a place of
DISCOBOLUS
importance in the State Theatre.
Above the minor console of the
mighty State Wurlitzer Organ, at the
right-hand side of the Proscenium, it
is placed in a special niche.

MEET Leon Rosebrook, Director of Music for the
great State Theatre.
This man has versatility. Ask Florenz Zieg-
feld, Ed. Wynn, Earl Carroll and the Shuberts ?he
has been Orchestra leader to all four.
He has been musical director for 29 grand operas
and 127 light operas and musical comedies. He has
trained voices, coached choruses, orchestrated special
scores for motion pictures.
You are going to thrill to the tone poem of music
that swells from the Unit Orchestra of 30 under his
magnetic baton.
Then, too, on the stage you will meet him again?a
personality around whom a whole entertainment
revolves. Welcome, Leon Rosebrook.
